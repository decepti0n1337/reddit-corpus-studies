Hmm, that's true, mechanically giving him a leap would be the same. Maybe he should be able to climb on terrain and jump off of it!
---
---
---
The game is trying to tell you something. Go start playing camping Legion! (pls don't tho)
---
He was just depressed and quiet in school bro
---
I don't think size would stop the developers from making it work. He's heavily requested, and can probably make a lot of money.
---
Try Legion Cosplay
---
Iron Will: silence not matter what.
---
Monitor: u are on top of the survivor before they noticed.
---
We‚Äôll make it: is an alternative at borrow time.
---
Stridor(? Nurse perk): counter Iron will.
---
Spies: dude every god damn map has crows.
---
You stop getting BP after 4 shocks or so, no?
---
Doc is an M1 killer who plays screaming goat VFX constantly. 
---

---
Not good at all. Nobody wants to fight him tho.

A massacre
---
A doll that comes to life and starts murdering people. That's horrifying. I don't find ghostface or legion scary, they just dudes with knifes that run.
---
It's just not an exploit. Nowhere is it listed as a reportable offense on any official BHVR material, because it isn't.
---
The bodyblocking you're talking about being a bannable offense is the kind where the Killer blocks people in the basement to hold the game hostage (which they patched out a little while ago I believe)
---
I think that would be too niche and could be useless on maps such as the game
---
Having Steve in the game just doesn't make sense to me as long as he's alive in the show
---
I feel like the devs are wanting to put movable items on every few skins just for the practice even if it‚Äôs completely unnecessary. We must protest this. 
---
We need boob physics.
---
Itson the endgame scorecard where you can report players i believe
---
Really rare, and i just used it instantly to try out pig, and get a 3man swf with only one kill  
---
Hello darkness, my old friend
---
*Shh* no it‚Äôs not haha. This one‚Äôs way smaller. And no traps. Just a doll.
---
but then you have adrenaline and a key
---
Shaun is probably my most wanted DLC for DbD. Let me know if you have any criticisms! And YES! his last name is Riley
---
Oh for sure, I don't think ghost face or legion are really scary either. I just prefer something a little more realistic, yet still scary. Like Michael Myers. (Yes I know he is not completley realistic but is on the realistic side compared to a living doll.)
---
I think you're confusing "hard to play against" with "easy to play".
---
She's hard to master, but it's also very hard to outplay her.
---
That said,  it *is possible*.
---
Devs said that that refers to basement blocking, bodyblocking a survivor into a corner etc. No hook blocking
---
I know right. I would have looped him the whole time and he wouldn't have got any hook points or sacrifices for that matter lol. He may have disconnected instead.
---
As much as I'd want that, it will never happen. 
---
However I will settle for markers in the post game lobby showing who was SWF with who. I've had waaaaay to many people try to lie and weasel out of the truth.
---
Yeah lol
---
2-3 blink nurses are actually fun to verse against. I wouldn't even mind if I die because at least it's a fun match.
---
Beats getting tunnelled by Huntress/Pig/Hag.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really work against a bubba buddy. He still downs one
---
If you want to buy the DLC killer with money DON'T buy Spirit. She absolutely is one of the best killers BUT you can just play the game, farm Iridescent Shards and buy her for free. The two killers you should look at are Leatherface because of his Perk BBQ and Chilli which may be the best perk in the game and Myers because you get a fun killer, descent killer perks and Decisive Strike for survivors which is a must for tunneling killers.
---
Not if you‚Äôre quick enough
---
When you hook 2-3 people within 60 seconds of eachother and you down one of the people who got off the hook first and they still have DS despite hooking 2 others has nothing to do with being a "smart killer" it has to do with the fact that its duration is too long for a "tunneling" punishment since no one tunnels for 60 seconds
---
That's for killer bodyblocking to hold the game hostage. Bodyblocking to prevent a hook or hit is an intended mechanic.
---
It‚Äôs fun cause a few days ago, someone post bout how bad design Game was for killers, while this map is one of the most killer friendly maps(totem spawns was one of the reasons I gave)but if u didn‚Äôt win is cause u played bad, the map still have enough pallets to run a killer around while 3 guys do gens.
---
Im aware. Im just saying it was about to be my first win against him after countless losses and I got glitched.
---
Spoilers cunt
---
Ruin. As a survivor if Corrupt Intervention is going on I just use that time to cleanse totems.
---
I'd personally say that they both have merits depending on the map/totem spawn. Your killer's kit/mobility can make either extremely beneficial. I've seen some killers that are less reliant on perks run bothü§î
---
depending entirely on killer, with hag and trapper getting the survivors to a short few gens are better then having all gens available. every other killer its more likely that ruin is the best choice.
---
I can do you one better. I've had a Killer repeatedly pick up and drop the second last person before doing that. I think it was a D/C game, too.
---
Ooh or or the map would have sitting dolls here and there and Chucky could switch between them and so you‚Äôd always have to stare at the dolls, ready to run if it starts moving out of nowhere! The killer wouldn‚Äôt see where the survivors are though before switching to another doll so it would always be a bit of a guessing game (sort of like with the Spirit when she‚Äôs phasing), but it‚Äôs a fast way to move around the map.
---
Yeah it's so fun to play against a killer with no counterplay when they're good
---
[removed]
---
I think Small Game is really finicky on that map since there's two floors. I swear I get notifications for totems on the other floor.
---
dInG dOng bItCh
---
Nope. Probably lag
---
From what I gather ruin basically makes it impossible for new survivors to fix gens and the rank reset just happened so all kinds of people are playing together
---
If ruin and lullaby are still up and lullaby is at like 3 to 5 stacks its really strong.
---
Open the gate for them for even more, unles you've capped out Deviousness and you probably have.
---
man i dont camp the 2 times i camped was for test and i didn't like it  "the only way to get kills" boi 3 straight games as myers i got 4 kill (some dc because they got downed) without camping you are not just wrong you are stupid if you read the thing i posted you wouldn't say such a fucking stupid shit like this
---
So this reddit page is a bunch of hunky dunky butt hurt killers.
---
Theres killers wanting more buffs, no pallet looping, no body blocking, etc. What do you want from the survivors is my question? You wanna just have them run from you? Thats it?
---
But my controls were inverted, like airplane controls look up it looks down look left it looks left
---
Eh I‚Äôll in good conscious play it out. If I can use my insta heals and talk about it I can‚Äôt necessarily complain about any killers pink or purple add ons.
---
Don't put gag and huntress in one sentence or else.
---
His power would be a Fischer Price step stool
---
You are definitely correct. If you are the dude who made this post and plan on being dedicated and playing enough to the get the nonlicsenced killers with shards definitely listen to the comment above this one.
---
The only killer i dislike is Myres. They only reason is that he's in about 80% of the games I play and they always got for a teir 3 build. Plus it's almost always a new player or someone who wants to ruin peoples day. If i saw some teir one builds I'd love seeing him!
---
I'd hate to see your opinion on Trapper if you think the Hag has a long setup time.
---
Yeah it's the select button on Xbox, share or whatever they call it now.
---
Body blocking is my only complaint, No idea where you pulled that shit from
---
Well there‚Äôs no perk or mechanic. What killer was it?
---
There-in lies the issues, it's anything but a horror game. It's just glorified cops and robbers with no fear at all, it's never even held it. A polished turd is still a turd.
---
No Ed. Lel.
---
That happens to me sometimes too. It's a bug I'm 95% sure. It's annoying but you fix it by turning your controller off and back on again. Or if you're pc you change the setting to inverted then back to normal. I hate when it happens
---
also nerf all their add-ons while we're at it.
---
First comes love, then comes marriage
---
Then a horrible and tragic miscarriage
---
Meg leaves dwight and takes the tree
---
D-I-V-O-R-C-E 
---
(Obligatory not mine, C&amp;H comic)
---
Yeah, that's already on there... PGTW, D, BBQ, and TT was what I was proposing.
---
When someone used decisive
---
i really dont understand how anyone still follows pewdiepie
---
Or tbagging at a pallet, or tbagging the killer in general.
---
I bought the spirit with shards, and I'm not going to lie, I almost regretted it. She must requires more skill &amp; mind games to pull off, definitely fun. Heavily Requires add ons =/
---
I have it currently on Legion, because as Legion you‚Äôre trying to hit everyone all the time anyway to make them go mend.
---
Right now, the set up I have is Ruin, Than, Dying Light, and I forget the last one. It‚Äôs a total ‚Äúslow the game the hell down‚Äù build, and I think I‚Äôm gonna swap Sloppy Butcher on there, may replace Than or a whatever that 4th is
---
So edgy
---
Not saying it's a bad perk, just saying it's redundant on the build he mentioned.
---
Thank you for your services.
---
Just because it's a Jojo meme, I'll grant you this one upvote.
---
I really like that they hid the totems better but I think the totems are a little *too* well-hidden now. Without Small Game it's practically impossible to find all the totems on that map, making NOED practically a guarantee and pretty much giving the Killer a free win if their Ruin is in a semi-decent spot.
---
And yet when I get Badham as Killer somehow my Ruin is always by those fucking cinderblocks or in the basement of the school or that one house with all the lockers by that pile of boxes. .-.
---
Thanks!
---
And the only prescription is..
---
Meg teabagged at a pallet, i dropped her at the hatch,  closed it, and moried her.
---
Toxicity for toxicity. Also are we going to ignore survivors make up 99% of all toxicity in the game.
---
I love you üòò
---
It's the back button, or the one on the left right below the glowy xbox button thingy, or at least that's what it is on default.
---
Protector is too similar to botany knowledge
---
I‚Äôd argue that while you‚Äôre new to the game, learning how it all works, learning how the killers powers work, there is absolutely a fear factor, of course there‚Äôs no fear to be had once you understand everything, that‚Äôs just how all horror games are. Once you grasp everything the game has to offer is when you should move on from the horror aspect of the game and begin to play it competitively, climbing the ranks to face better killers and find a better challenge
---
My chainsaw and its 200% movement speed says otherwise.
---
On ps4 if you hit the touch pad it‚Äôll invert your controls. The doctor also has an add on that may mess with controls in madness 3 if I‚Äôm remembering correctly
---
Same here. I love her. She's my main.
---
Everyone gangsta till *NOED* pops
---
Depends on map and spawn location.
---
he‚Äôs pretty weak overall? compared to meta killers at least. i just meant any killer apart from myers, GF, NURSE, huntress, plague, chainsaw bois, etc
---
That feel when enduring only decreases pallet stun-time now
---
Hoping next week's shrine is a bit better, though I highly doubt it.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea! What platform do you play on? PS4 has no post game chat and it can be difficult messaging Individually!
---
y‚Äôall are downvoting this guy when op agrees lmfao
---
The last 5 days of this reddit page. 
---
Body blocking is a legitimate way to counter a killer. It gives survivors that little edge to escape the hands of the killer.
---
Killers already have so much on their hands. Bbq/chili, discordance, nurses calling, whispers, etc. like you can‚Äôt ask for more and the game has never swayed so much in favor of killers like it has now. If you wanna avoid body blocking, just R1 or M1. Its that easy. Once you hit 1 person blocking, you will be able to hook the the downed survivor. 2 survivors can‚Äôt cover much of the hook to block it properly
---
That sounds more like a you problem than the games fault, the average player should absolutely be a tad bit intimidated by any of the numerous killers coming at them, with god knows what power, solely wanting to fuck their shit sideways. And even if you skip the beginner journey of learning the game, you just move on to the competitive scene quicker
---
That‚Äôs like saying every single character is gay or lesbian
---
That‚Äôs a good idea didn‚Äôt think of that! I‚Äôm pretty good with nea as a survivor main so can definitely save up my BP to spend on the killers
---
That's possibile but with added monitor and abuse that is counted before distressing and calm are added
---
Did you insult anyone recently?
---
I like bloody spirit
---
Do you DC a lot?
---
How?
---
Who are you?
---
That lag tho
---
He hooked my friend earlier in the match but it looked like ge didn't see the hatch, guess he did
---
Thinking of you üôåüèº loool
---
Yeah no I'm poor let me use the shards I've been grinding for months or don't give me licensed content.
---
Did you do anything under the unsportsmanlike tab in the reporting system?
---
Reported to death by toxic players who didn't enjoy losing. Sorry man :/
---
no ed‚Äôs here officer
---
Clown internet.
---
Are we talking in a chase or out?
---
But then he closes the hatch and moris you
---
What does that do? Who has it?
---
In chase , out chase it would be smaller
---
No.
---
I figured it out there‚Äôs a button that inverts it
---
Nothing like loading in with 4 hexes only for some snot survivor to disable every single totem that match.
---
Idk how I can check if I was banned for it. That information is in game.
---
My god just let him pick him up then pallet him.
---
So mathematically his terror radius is 65 meters. That's mathematically
---
Just saw another post here where a dude got banned for nothing but salty fucks reporting him. So maybe? It's so iffy on a game like this where people report you just because they are unhappy that they lost
---
Wow dbd has changed
---
What reason is there for NOT having licensed characters...?
---
That‚Äôs when you slap on your best add-ons and an Ebony.
---
Feels bad man
---
Guess you haven't played Rank 1 where it's just Nurse, Spirit and Hillbilly
---
Sounds like you're usually the first person to get hooked out of your group of friends...
---
Big enough is the answer, i think nothing actually stack multiplicatevly in this game apart from this - legion blades used to stack and it was game breakig
---
It is a joke, never use it.
---
Yeah, it's big. Plain and simple
---
he‚Äôs so fucking goofy though. one of his movies is called chuckys seed. as in sperm. one of his movies is called chuckys cum. he‚Äôs such a redundant and ridiculous character and i personally hate him. his movies are great tho
---
Meh, I think spirit is better than hillbilly
---
It even gives you emblem points now for being hit while the killer is carrying a survivor and they made a perk to counter it, so no, not an exploit.
---
I get off each time I take someone off a hook
---
Honestly, if that hit me as a survivor, I'd have such a "what the fuck" moment that I'd turn into a full potato for a few minutes.
---
Its a hard knock life
---
Thanks everyone for the tips and advice! And thanks for not mocking me haha. I 100% know people will be better than me and when they play well I‚Äôm not bothered as of course they‚Äôre also playing to win, it‚Äôs just when they mock me after I‚Äôve missed a hit or not got anyone all game I feel annoyed because we all started somewhere! 
---
I practiced more with all the advice and see an improvement. I don‚Äôt expect to always be hooking the whole team but I wanna get better to get bp and have a bit of rank progress going on! I‚Äôm a survivor main but want to switch it up, so I know survivor tactics and know that I don‚Äôt always have a consistent outcome in every game it literally depends on many factors, I‚Äôll try remember this as the killer too and just ignore the toxic players that mock me! :)
---
Well, it's all Wraith can do, so you may as well bing bong whenever possible.  Why would you need a reason?  Answer: you wouldn't.
---
You have a better chance of a God damn teletubbies being a killer than chucky.
---
The perk icon lights up when the killer is looking at you within about 40 meters, and it's a universal perk so it shows up in all bloodwebs
---
No, Ed, you can't escape from death.
---
Happened to me once.  I'm in my 40s so pulling down to look up is natural for me, flight games.
---
It‚Äôs a base perk, not any one survivors perk. It tells you when the killer is looking in your direction from a range of 36 meters while also giving you +9 speed to all interactions minus recovering in the dying state. Very good perk, especially against stealth killers. The only killer it won‚Äôt work on is Michael Myers when he‚Äôs in Tier 1 of evil within, works when he‚Äôs in Tier 2 and Tier 3
---
‚ÄúHorror‚Äù
---
that‚Äôs your shitty friends lmao
---
Haha yeah that‚Äôs what I thought of when it happened, I was like ‚Äúwhat are these airplane controls?‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs good, we need Joyce tho
---
PC or XBOX/PS4?
---
My point is that everyone thought she was going to be hard to play, I don‚Äôt get your point
---
Bad killers who can't win against Swf, just need to play more, and gain more experience. I think it's fine if the killer wants to dodge a lobby. He's not obligated to stay. 
---
SWF logo/icon would just encourage killers to dip, instead of accepting the challenge. Killers can't just expect every game to be easy. Work for it.
---
I think my current build is BBQ, Nurses, Thrilling Tremors, and Surveillance. 
---
Probably not the best build I hardly play him.
---
I will say Nurses is absolutely broken on Ghostface similar to BBQ N' Billy. No Terror Radius in stealth mode means smart survivors can't do the "Stop healing when you hear the TR" trick to counteract nurses.
---
Or when the third stack of devour hope pops
---
Youve made them look so cute

Run the patented soloq pipping build. BT cause you can't trust people not to go back down and deprive you of points, Deliverance because you can't trust someone to get you, DS because you can't trust they will have BT also stacks with Deliverance, + Choice of perk I use Dead Hard.
---
Why not "bing bong"?
---
I know it's not canon lol. I guess it's completely possible, you're right
---
HOLD ON, CAN PEOPLE DO THIS ON PS4 AS IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO ME AND NOW IM EVEN MORE ANNOYED
---
I almost always go back for the save when the gates are powered unless there‚Äôs noed, then I open the gate and fucking run
---
I dont read the forums too often, but there are less people on there and post get seen by more of those few people who care. I feel like the people on the forums care more about the game than all the redditors. Posting on the forums will definitely givenyou more feedback.
---
"Give me a shock" *Killers don't have to play by your made-up rules*
---
There is no try. Do or do not.
---
Same. Or Rancor
---
I‚Äôm gonna body block more to make salty op killers like this one saltier. #SWF
---
‚ÄúHey do you guys think we should fix hit boxes and other things wrong with the game?‚Äù ‚ÄúNah, lets just make joining your friends lobbies quicker‚Äù
---
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN WARPING INTO WALLS WHEN THE KILLER GIVES CHASE, AND ONLY WHEN KILLER HIVES CHASE. I WAS PISSED, I NEVER ASSUME CHEATING BUT THIS WAS OBVIOUS.
---
I'm feelin it
---
Where did they all go?
---
Four survivors jump through the hatch. Near impossible for me to get since I have no friends. Its the last one for me. Including the DLC trophies  even though you dont need those for the platinum.
---
I mean there are plenty of stuff survivors do is fun ruining, like brand new parts and insta heals, but funnily enough that‚Äôs the first people to complain about imaginary tunnels.
---
I‚Äôve mad such mistakes claiming that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a huntress or a Freddy because I hear a lullaby but no it‚Äôs all in my head and it turns out to be a billy or something lol
---
Brave words for someone in the insta-bubba distance.
---
The cosmetic released today is her best imo
---
I think it might be a bit of a stretch to say the lower reaction time is a thing, since the survivors have the same issue.  
---
If the darkness is a problem, adjust your brightness either through the game or your tv. The darkness offerings don't exist anymore, it shouldn't be an issue. (Disclaimer: I don't actually recall if you can change it in game. Just saying it anyway.)  
---
The saw has a different hitbox on console? Or are you saying that your aiming is slower due to control stick compared to mouse and you have less room for error? In the former, that's pretty dumb. In the latter... Change your sensitivity and practice, if that's an option. Seems lame, but that's the nature of the beast.
---
I'm guessing I got reported by salty people. I must play too good as killer. But this is the only game I play so me being banned is fucking horrible.
---
They are not the clown they are the whole circus
---
Only you would know that, but it seriously takes A LOT to get banned in this game.
---
A week. But I don't want to wait for a ban that I didn't even deserve or know why I have.
---
I want the huntress to *choke* me.
---
It honestly seems like this reddit is turning into a salt/meme page with very little discussion at all.
---
Even if I try and post something to spark interest, most of the comments are just bullshit that don't mean anything.
---
Anyways, I think I'll move my stuff to the forums now.
---
Thank you.
---
That would be more a Freddy Krueger's thing than a Steve's. hahahaha
---
Honestly if you're playing Huntress, it's often better not to pick up survivors you've downed if you know there are other ones in the area. It's a lot more map pressure to have one downed survivor + one hooked one
---
Or salty people spam reported me because I played too good.
---
You have to have evidence to report someone. I feel like there might be more to this bro. 
---
You can submit a ticket and ask for info on your ban I think. Can‚Äôt hurt to ask?
---
Thanks =D
---
Gotta give those emotes some use, right? =D
---
Proportions. Draw the body first and then the clothing. Drawing the sweater and skirt and THEN legs is a good way to make the body seem off.
---
Im actually being serious. I dont understand why this wasnt here at release. Part of DBD is playing with friends.
---
I'm talking about the in game report. That doesn't require anything except pressing a button, so people can just report you on that for no reason.
---
Oh no no im really good at nurse on console. But problem is theres a big difference from pc than console. I have my killer sensitivity bumped up to max and when your blinking while looking around its as slow as the default turning if you have your sens all the way down. And when she hits some one her turning looks rusted and ragged when your in fatigue time. Its grimy and disgusting to even play nurse on console to be honest. Its not fun either so i‚Äôd recommend pc to play nurse at.
---
You‚Äôll have to email support and ask why, they usually explain.
---
That actually wouldnt do anything. And given your attitude in this post, I'm certainly getting why you would have received a ban, if this is how you act when you are just simply trying to defend yourself.
---
Sick. That's always satisfying.
---
Oh üòõ my bad! I thought you were being sarcastic, sorry
---
Unsportsmanlike conduct is either bottling, lagswitching, or too many DCs. They aren‚Äôt going to ban you for no reason, so you fit one of those. If you‚Äôve never been temp banned before, it‚Äôs not for DCs since I know that has an escalating punishment system. Not sure about the other 2.
---
Meg always looks uncanny
---
Don't you just hate that about Wraith? Also the Insidious Perk.
---
Borrowed Time should be adjusted for proximity, so that Insidious Leatherface and Wraith still trigger it.
---
I mean look at Hag, if you trigger her trap you can get Borrowed Time off its Terror Radius even if she's not in teleport range, but you can't get Borrowed Time off a Wraith staring into your soul?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Conversely if the Survivor is dumb and pulls off someone off the hook 1.5 seconds after the Killer hooks them, is that a fair proc of Borrowed Time, given that the Killer never had the chance to leave?
---
I'm thinking like: "Borrowed Time will proc if the Killer is within twenty meters of the hook or their Terror Radius range, whichever is larger, but can only be procced on a target who has been hooked for at least ten seconds".
---
My P3 mains! I love this.
---
To submit a full ticket that actually gets reviewed they ask you to go to their website on playstation and submit video evidence. I would know, I‚Äôve reported bots via ticket and been asked for evidence before they can do anything. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You shouldn‚Äôt chase people with Hag, unless your running them into traps.
---
You earned it, appeal directly to Behavior if you truly believe it was a false ban, otherwise, shh about it. Its legit against terms of service to even discuss ban reasons publically.
---
Ahh, the game actively screws with your camera speed on console? Man, if that's true, ouch. I am very sorry.
---
*enslaved 4DC
---
I don't bot, or lagswitch. This is my first ban so its not for dcs. I got a week ban though. For my first offense.
---
Recently I‚Äôve been getting frame drops, especially on the new Badham maps, it was perfect before the Bill patch.
---
Yeah, Im not saying all survivors are toxic, not at all, but I run devour hope on nearly all my games and still get called camper. Feela bad. Is it a permanent ban?
---
By Karens you surely meant the plethora of young people acting and transitioning into boomer lifestyle? If they are on reddit, they are cancerous. 
---
I joined reddit to troll my local board on a main account. I‚Äôve noticed reddit attracts the worst kind of house dwellers and uncool house kids who obsess over vidya gim stats. As if downvotes mean ducking anything. Useless internet points to spend making ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù statements on a website of ‚Äúincel group think culture‚Äù.
---
You may want to read make your choice, distance is required from the hook.
---
Yeah it sucks. But billy is the same on console so it doesn‚Äôt matter to me tbh. Billy is speed king!
---
A week. I don't feel I deserve that though for a first time offense.
---
But you can ask for more info on your ban via a ticket on their website. I just had a look :)
---
Cool
---
LoL
---
I did, they are asking for my PS4 id. I don't know where to find that though.
---
I came here asking how to figure out how to get unbanned.
---
I'm making sure I am ready for china's id social point system.
---
Dam nice! Thanks for the info
---
That's a lot of insecurity
---
Go to options (via the cog icon on your PS4) and there will be a long serial number at the bottom. Enter that and give them your screen name. They can tell you from that. 
---
It should look something like this: B142-2chi3-1111 etc.
---
they shouldn't have made ghostface another stalk character
---
The only way to even get a week ban would be to consistently get multiple reports per game, over a long period of time.
---
Sad there's no BBQ.
---
It has happened in actual games.
---
Ty!!!
---
Atleast it makes sense for the teenagers to be small and weak looking but Ghostface is a fully grown adult and he has twig arms. My man needs to work out
---
I'm not saying they will pay for it I'm just saying they can make accurate faces if they have the rights
---
You looped him for 4 gens but no gens got done? 
---
Do you know what you just said
---
Stonks!
---
Ruin would be a good idea because most teams will be able to finish every gen before you get evil within 3 without it
---
Know what else is good for camping a tent
---
Ok good Kobe. But that first one DEFINITELY should not have hit.  Hatchet hitboxes are weird
---
and Temple of Purgation
---
and Gideon Meat Plant
---
and Lerys Memorial Institute
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Lol, this is almost completely downvoted. xD At least *you're* excited! :P
---
Well I'm still waiting for a response, we will see. 
---
Not like I care though. This broke my already low bar for this game. In the week of the ban I'll prob end up quitting so yeah.
---
Yes, or calum.
---
Everybody gangster until the Nurse blink 5 times
---
Thank god
---
Th last one in particular, but the couple ones before it were solid too.
---
thanks!
---
Prestiging means nothing considering how many p3 Claudettes,Neas,Ghostfaces,Wraiths etc. I personally find people who wear prestige clothing on characters like Neas potatoes because of my past experiences. Sucks you got camped but him being p3 means nothing
---
Yeh, I mean I love me Tapp but Strahm was a badass muthafucka. Also maybe higly unpopular opinion (even in my own heart cause I love amanda) but it would be cool to see Hoffman as the pig, like how legion has different caracters
---
You know what?
---
I feel that people try to play Legion wrong, between his **common** addons and perks (Distressing, Monitor and Abuse's chase bonus) he can have a Terror Radius approaching Doctor Worldwide and due to his Feral Frenzy running speed he can reach anybody within it when they're revealed by Killing Instinct.
---
If you can't do something with getting the location of every survivor even inside a locker because you found and hit one no matter how many pallets they attempt to use or windows they try to vault since you vault them faster than they do in Feral Frenzy, getting to not only injure them (forcing them to heal because otherwise when you next find them on a generator you can just regular M1 before they reach a pallet, because Legion is now 115%) but also force them to mend.
---
And you can do that to all four survivors (pairs well with Sloppy Butcher) and completely stall them for 40-50 seconds every time while you chase one.
---
Then maybe you're not playing Legion correctly? Getting to leave survivors permanently exposed if they try to deny your Killer Instinct is a great power, it's like an entire survivor team playing with No Mither, or taking forever to heal up each and every single time, slowing the game down to a crawl since you can keep forcing injuries and mending infinitely.
---
Like seriously Legion gets a good 50 seconds of all the other survivors having to mend+heal to down one of them.
---
Really beautiful, can't wait for more &lt;3
---
When all survivors do is pallet loop tea bag and DC when you do finally catch them. 1 kill is a success
---
OP said gugure kokkuri-san, in case you missed it
---
It‚Äôs a good show, it‚Äôs an anime comedy that doesn‚Äôt have the same cast of cookie cutter SoL characters and that basically makes it a classic.
---
That‚Äôs true, ash is pretty good. But they really did Quentin dirty. IMO Laurie looks better than in the movie, better hair
---
What does p3 mean? I've heard of this term but only when talking about immersed claudettes.
---
That familiar freeze of "Wait, that fucking hit?"
---
Nice stuff.
---
7:30 at least someone can respect Quentin mains!!!!!
---
True, I also thought the same lol
---
I'm 850 hs into the game, i receive reports like every day i play. I received one 5 minutes ago. I don't think they something about it unless cheating.
---
I know it means nothing but what i meant by that is that he is probably a player who put enough time into the game to P3 yet still does stuff like camping
---
He constantly ran towards me all game, despite being injured. I knew he wanted to use ds, so I downed him and left, and eventually came back if he was still downed to hook him. 
---
Also funny thing is his SWF friend called me a ‚Äúcluless virgin‚Äù on my steam profile after he called me a noob ingame.
---
Play Pig. Crouch!
---
wow incredible you have sex and smoke weed, you must have the biggest balls, or maybe huge insecurity issues since literally nobody asked and nobody cares. you don‚Äôt need to lie on the internet to feel better about yourself. i hope this is bait
---
Bait?  I‚Äôm also voicing my frustration. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you read this at all. I also bet you facecamp and bring in moris because you can‚Äôt win without it.
---
Anton Chigurh better be the next killer
---
Does the hatch open at 2 players left? also its totally not cheating, just a nice way to help out your'r'er'ere team
---
I believe the salt flair would be more accurate on this one
---
Hex-Bait. If you fell for it I have no problem annoying you too
---
Try running no mither as your only perk ;)
---
"The strong things the killers can do are unfair, the strong things the survivors can do are balanced" Is the TLDR here.
---
Objection; if the survivors in this game don‚Äôt know how to loop properly (in which they don‚Äôt,) it‚Äôs an easy game for the hunte- I mean killer.
---
It helps when you say what platform you're on
---
We can talk about what I said. Don‚Äôt take the easy way out.   What are your thoughts on what I said?
---
Poggers
---
It's just a little bit broken
---
facecamping makes the game a snoozefest for both sides and moris are a thing to appeal to the killers power fantasies but no i dont really run them (dont really get them either mainly a survivor person i play SWF a lot)
---
I will be making a post about survivors later. But survivors run around a pallet and killers lose their minds.  Killers facecamp and we‚Äôre just as pissed.  But killers being shitty is way more breaking than survivors.
---
Stay on the gen or we won't need the killer
---
downvote because i asked you something? sick
---
With real money? Mikey, but im biased.
---
With shards? Spirit. Ive found her extremely fun and while it does take some time to learn, she is a top tier killer.
---
Whatever you say kiddo, enjoy your baitfest, hope the fishies bite.
---
Playing swf I‚Äôm sure you can agree lobby dodging is fucked up. Killers getting mad because they can‚Äôt loop properly.
---
Camping because of those reasons is not the same as camping for no reason like that guy
---
Amen to that
---
Yh I know what prestiging is as I've done it multiple times, I just didn t know what p3 meant. Imagine having close to 400 hours into dbd and not knowing p3 means prestige 3. Lol I feel so stupid right now XD
---
Appreciate the answer. Yeah spirit definitely looks good but it might take a while to learn her. I almost have 9k shards so I‚Äôll probably buy her and I was gonna buy a killer with money as well so I‚Äôll probably get Micheal then.
---
So that is where the meme comes from I will take a look
---
I might need new glasses
---
I‚Äôm just trying to have a conversation but then there‚Äôs people like you who think everything is about ‚Äúbait‚Äù and ‚Äúattention‚Äù ... instead of saying that, you could have said something contributing. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about being liked or hated. I‚Äôm voicing my frustrations which I‚Äôm allowed to do.  You could have easily said something worth reading or moved on.  Don‚Äôt be that guy
---
Regarding the teleportation/portal deal...
---
Why not make it so you aim where you want your destination portal, and when you make it, it also opens one on any wall/tree closest to you?
---
It would mean you need line of sight of your destination though.
---
Sir excuse me sir do you want a down vote is that what you want cause I will do it I Will do it I will down vote this shit I'm doin it I down voted yer fucked now kiddo
---
Your not wrong
---
That's not against the rules.
---
And she also helped spreadjng the sickness in her rituals by making everyone going to them, killing them indirectly.
---
So basically Adiris killed everyone in her village.
---
I already made my contribution, translating this post for people that didnt want to read your wall of tantrum. Have a good day.
---
Btw this nurse might have been a baby, I was not sure. She had 4 perk slots so I suppose she had a basic understanding. She attempted to camp with insidous but failed miserably and we all got away (this was on the game map)
---
Also tag this as salt, not discussion.
---
Yh I know what prescribing means as I've done it multiple times. Just didn t know that p in p3 meant prestige. Imagine having close to 400 hundred hours into the game and not knowing that. Lol I feel so stupid rn XD
---
I cannot wait for Soviet Ace.
---
The only time it seems truly unfair is against an infinite T3 Myers with Tombstone. You will almost always need swf in order to even have a chance.
---
nice b8.
---
Oh no my life will be ruined if you downvoted.  Sorry I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúFUCK YES KILLERS YOU ALL ARE GREAT. KEEP DODGING. KEEP CAMPING. YOURE AWESOME‚Äù for upvotes.  
---
This comment alone was super weird
---
You deny anything and everything people ask you. You don't need to convince us, send a ticket to BHVR if you believe you're innocent. Keep in mind, disconnecting from games on regular basis could've gotten you banned.
---
I won‚Äôt be tagging this as salt, mom.
---
Probably explains it then. You got heavily reported. No one is enjoying playing games with u. You're bad for the community in general. 
---
Could be why, let's not assume.
---
Same, but even so i'm glad to have him. He's so much fun.
---
Bait* 
---
Words are hard.
---
This happens so much to me that I wish there was a way to bleed out faster. I get knocked down and my teammate gets me back up only for me to go back down over and over, then I get hooked right before I die and it‚Äôs the killer prolonging the game just for 4 kills. I would rather press a button to bleed out faster so I can die and leave the match already. I don‚Äôt even care if I live and escape that match, I would rather start a new one.
---
Play with your food is great too. Just not on Michael lol. Funny how they do that. Give perks to a killer that are good but completely useless on the killer they come with.
---
Maybe if you TL;DR my post correctly then I would assume you could comprehend properly.
---
Yeah the comment that's what's weird in all this ya know what you just earned yourself another down vote yer double fucked now wrath shall fall upon ye
---
Yeah got my doctor perctieged recently (regret it lol) and didn‚Äôt buy him so I think you‚Äôre right
---
Every time a Ghost teabags back at me, we end up forming an unspoken bond
---
We SHOULD be getting dedicated servers next month iirc and that should fix the hitbox problems.
---
I mean sneak behind him and as he swings at the body grab it off and bam there you go
---
Pig or Ghostface however I am a Pig main enjoying Ghostface for now
---
So your saying the afk wasn't slugged just injured? Doesn't seem like an issue to me she probably didn't want anyone to escape and didn't want the afk to bleed out. It's not like she blocked u in the basement or anything and prevented you from escaping/dying
---
Okay
---
I dont think that counts, I mean. Its up to the huntress who she wants to down and hook. I dont think theres any rule that you need to go after the most obvious or easiest target. In fact theres quite a few perks that discourage it like STBFL or borrowed time.
---
Is it too much to ask for survivors to go down when the bar is depleted none of this staying alive if their still mending stuff just die cause you didn‚Äôt complete it in time. With it not going down whilst in the terror radius of legion it gives them ample time to actually mend.
---
S'more?
---
It takes forever to build up though.
---
I'M FUCKING ANGRY BECAUSE I JUST HAD A MATCH WITH A TOXIC CUNTRESS AND IDIOTIC TEAMMATES.
---
ONE DISCONNECT.
---
ONE SUICIDE ON HOOK.
---
ONE GAVE UP AND WENT A.F.FUCKING.K AND THE KILLER FOUND HIM, HIT HIM ONCE, AND LEFT HIM. JUST ME AND 5 GODDAMN GENS, SHE HELD THE GAME HOSTAGE FOR LIKE 20 MINUTES AND I COULDN'T DO SHIT EXCEPT D/C OR SUICIDE.
---
"Y'all are too sensitive." 10 minutes later. "You're fucking stupid for disagreeing with my INCREDIBLY biased opinion"
---
They should have raced.
---
I second this!
---
No, it‚Äôs not. They were just leaving the afk Dwight injured so they could find you first, so you couldn‚Äôt get the hatch. That‚Äôs not reportable.
---
Want game footage, or hand-framed?
---
Skeleton Key + Blood Amber + Prayer Beads
---
And Bill
---
Looks like it worked pretty good in this instance.
---
To be fair...
---
Allow me to introduce N√∏kk, from Rainbow 6: Siege
---
Proceeded*.  Also, looks like Bubba‚Äôs been taking some notes from The Nurse.
---
Well they got a 32 meter head start but sure, go ahead
---
Isn‚Äôt prayer beads a spirit add on
---
I run both. Along with the one where if you look in their direction you get an alert. I feel like together they help me avoid the killer so I can do gens as I get used to the mechanics.
---
Maybe his BBQ didn't show anyone close so he camped or he was worried you guys were going to rush hook? Anyways why can't killers(and survivors) just play the way they want instead of complaining about it
---
Billy meets his future self
---
Super sensitive. Hmm, but aren't you the 1 sensitive to losing a couple of karma points just so you can voice your opinion, you made a second account! Bro. That's the most sensitive shit you can do...
---
I always shitpost, and I don't care if I get a ton of downvotes. Why would I waste time, to voice my opinion over some karma points. Most sensitive shit ever.
---
Never mind I was thinking about the bracelet
---
You're a meme man not a survivor.  If you got to visit rank in a 4 man to rank up it is what it is but getting defensive over people acknowledging the fact that you have a huge advantage in a swf is absurd.  You sound like one of the cartoon characters that stalks Trues lobbies.  The fact that you had to cower behind a smurfs account shows that you know you're full of shit too otherwise you'd man up and own your words.  This whole post just reaks of entitlement and salt.
---
I hope they just change dying light. It kinda rewards tunneling one person superhard and even then is useless if you get a new obsession.
---
While I don't agree with people saying to straight up remove SWF, the argument around SWF comes from the fact that it is much more powerful than solo play. SWF grants survivors what skill alone can't and that's information, which is fairly strong on it's own, and becomes even more powerful when used by the right players. They need to bridge the gap between SWF and solo play.
---
Moris are very powerful offerings, yes instaheals and adrenaline aren't quite as strong as moris. A more comparable item would be keys, both make it so you need to do just less work, with relatively little counterplay from the opposing side. Reworks to unbalanced items on both sides are necessary, this does include instaheals, and *maybe* even adrenaline. The ending statement just seems to be an attack?
---
Facecamping and Tunnelling: Yes, these are widely considered unfun playstyles, which I agree with. They take a lot of what makes the game fun away, but currently, they are more high risk/low~medium reward playstyles, especially considering how much the current meta discourages them. Sometimes the killer needs to tunnel in order to gain/keep pressure, they take the risk of getting hit with borrowed time or decisive strike, but in return, they get a chance to get more pressure. Similar to how survivors do gens fast take the risk of getting hit with NOED. Even despite all of that I still don't like doing those things, but still, people *can* do them, even if I personally don't agree with it, I can always bring things for counterplay if I'm having too much trouble.
---
I don't get your next argument, yes this game is for mature players, yet you seem to be saying some rather immature things in your arguments, by just throwing out insults? I agree there needs to be less toxicity, but fighting toxicity with toxicity doesn't really help. Also, anyone of any age can play this game, and calling a child out for being a child, is just gross.
---
Lobby Dodging is, yes a problem, nothing we can really do about it. Punishing people for leaving before the game starts is just absurd.
---
To me it seems like your problems are issues you have personally with the game and the people who play it, rather than things that are actual issues to a healthy community and game, really this whole post has a lot of negative energy.
---
I turned a no ok into a 4k with billy cause of noed. Felt bad because if you have no kills when the exit gates are on as billy you deserve no k
---
The hips are a little too small but other than that it's great not a fail
---
To me, it would read to me that you like to help others, since her perks are about healing others and such.
---
It's trying to tell you something.  Try chess out, it rules
---
That's a nurse in the back left...?
---
As far as I know rainbow map only shows trappers traps, not hags
---
Have you seen the spirits face? I swear I've seen that in an old episode of scooby doo. Also disembodied ghost with detached limbs walking around killing people with a samurai sword that folds into existence screams realism. My dude, it sounds more like you just don't like Chucky instead of looking for realism.
---
A) I‚Äôm a human being first and foremost. Not some internet meme joke?? That was a weird thing to say. B) I can see why it‚Äôs an advantage but it can‚Äôt be that game breaking.  Not when I‚Äôve been in 4man swf where we got beat to shreds so I doubt it‚Äôs that hard.  You all make it seem like 4man are ALWAYS good. C) Not cowering. Shit, I just wanted to say what I had to say without being disrespected personally. You all can read my comments whether you know who I am or not. Still doesn‚Äôt take away the fact of how I feel.
---
I quite literally asked if the idea of ‚Äòpeople assuming that X or Y character is gay‚Äô got on their nerves as much as ‚Äòpeople assuming that X or Y character is straight‚Äô. Did I say anything else to imply I‚Äôm some sort of rape apologist?
---
Very true.
---
So you want to play a game...
---
*chuckles in Jigsaw*
---
Its fun for the get to do it once in your lifetime factor as long as you dont kill survivors (fun fact both get the bbq stack when someones hooked and spirit becomes unable to move) hag does the hag car thing where she gets stuck in the drawing animation killers couldnt see freddy pre rework and i think distressing on the trapper i did it with had no terror radius because of distressing or w/e maybe lullaby
---
I didn't downvote you.
---
Needs more thicc
---
Ooooooooweeeeeee
---
I mean he's fairly new, and Legion also hasn't gotten many cosmetics either. They've both only received one new set since release.
---
Thing is Jeff actually had a Purple tier skin on release, while Adam strangely didn't.
---
Its ok, i like it on huntress. But its still not shrine worthy imo
---
The comments on this concern me. Are we not adult enough on this 18+ game to have a conversation? I agree the people who play this are very over sensitive and I really love this game. Playing on ps4 I dont run into as many issues because we dont talk but I did have a 10 year old join my online party once. Really this isnt a game for kids. Although with the way you all act.....anyway survivors do crap things too. I know I have in a public match lead a killer to another survivor when I spot them. It's a jerk move but it happens and that will to survive is strong. My point is I understand OPs point. Everyone here whines and complains.
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Gotta learn to look behind you when running
---
He seems stronger from the feats he's done in his movies. Like other horror movies they don't try to dip into the science of it, you just have fun on the ride! No one explains the science of Freddy or Michael. They're just evil.
---
I agree I‚Äôm whining and complaining but everyone‚Äôs comments are just as bad, as if I‚Äôm the only one in the wrong.
---
Uh what the hell? He appeared out of no where.
---
It's less about him being afk, as even of he wasn't afk, the strategic thing to do would be to let him live, that way he can down you without opening worrying about to escaping through the hatch.
---
Go to The main page hit the three dots in the corner then select chamge user flair amd hit edit if you want to customize it
---
Cus its not a single person. Shipping ruins communities. Out of anything I would honestly say its the most annoying shit ever to exist within fandoms.
---
Sorry noobie here. What‚Äôs the issue? Just play a game and then get it?
---
Players will play how they want. Doesnt mean it's not toxic. Bhv should value their games being fun and facecamping is not fun so it would make sence that people would want it gone in some way.
---
Ghostface is pretty fun. I hear Mikey is good too, but requires perks from some of the other killers to be ideal (M&amp;A) for many builds. Spirit with shards is a great investment, she's a blast to play.
---
It's how titled your point. No one can take you seriously about people being sensitive, when the OP is super sensitive asf (karma points, really, really?) That's pretty low bar for someone whose saying most people are sensitive, when you reveal a weakness of yours. I'd take you more serious if you would just be blunt about what you said.
---
I put it in the wrong place. The other comment is deleted.
---
People in these comments don‚Äôt seem to realize he‚Äôs referring to himself being lag-positioned back to his previous spot, allowing him to be hit. Not because of broken hitboxes, just lag pulling him back.
---
That would be hilarious! If you can't get the license to Chucky, you do the teletubbies instead!
---
"Waaaaah, moris aren't fair and I'm being bullied"
---
Take some of your own salt, kid.
---
PainRelivers newest Sawdette video like
---
Yikes.
---
Lmao you literally are fighting my aggression just the same.  You‚Äôre not better for this comment, just saying
---
Yeah I want a stealth killer (sorry wraith) so with money I was going to buy Mikey or ghost face. Mikey seems stronger in the long run but I‚Äôd need a lot of perks from different killers like you said. Hell I just might get both lol
---
What happened?!!
---
Anyways. I could've swore your title sounded more rude. Guess i made a mistake. The karma points did lose me for a bit.
---
I KNOW RIGHT? I GOT ONE FOR JAKE AND HAD 5 GAMES IN A ROW DYING AT OPENING EXIT GATE , THEN HAD A GAME WITH A MYRES WHO LET ME WRIGGLE OUT , I OPENED GATE AND THEN HE FUCKING DOWNS ME JUST BEFORE THE ESCAPE LINE AND STARTS SPINNING ALL TOXIC AND PUTS ME ON HOOK.... EVERYONE ELSE FUCKING ESCAPED AND PIPPED UP , EVEN THOUGH I DONE 3 GENS I DEPIPPED AND LOST RANK
---
I though the time was just 2 minutes flat?
---
Talking in a positive manner! It triggered people to comment and start a discussion. You left a comment didn't you?
---
Try playing both sides regularly for some more insight, that is all. Have a good night.
---
Lol then I‚Äôm sensitive that killers can‚Äôt play better?  I don‚Äôt know what you want from me lol but you‚Äôre sure as hell aren‚Äôt going anywhere with your comments
---
Thank you!!
---
You might be thinking of "virtue signaling" which is a totally different thing. Otherwise you're right.
---
You hate this post so much you commented twice. Now that‚Äôs commitment.
---
She looks like she got hit by a train.
---
Meg please beat me
---
I just can‚Äôt see myself face camping because of something!!! If I did play killer I probably would be decent, fair at least, because I know what it‚Äôs like.  Don‚Äôt give me that shit
---
Good talk.
---
I think he can teleport to gens quicker when you‚Äôre asleep.  
---
Also, equally being asleep and awake will give you an idea where fake pallets and snares are
---
Who's even left to add that can actually work in the game?
---
It ain‚Äôt even a very good flashlight. Makes you wonder how they‚Äôd react if they‚Äôd lost a purple flashlight.
---
Literally all a bubba with half a brain has to do is hold the charge till they unhook and that‚Äôs a free 1-2 maybe 3-4 kills. I know because I‚Äôve been facecamped for running bubbas
---
Because noed is trash, while adreneline is actually a strong perk
---
My last game (like 15 minutes ago) I was playing Bubba (running on Ruin, Franklins, Thrill, Brutal and an Ebony). I caught one of the survivors in the closet and drop him on the hatch. Mind you I was playing with a SWF group who had the word toxic in their gamertags. As soon as I Mori‚Äôd him, the hatch opened and I immediately closed it and right behind me was the last survivor who was trying to make a run for the hatch but failed to jump in. I caught him and got a very salty message from saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a try hard. Get off the game trash.‚Äù
---
No Michael! You habe become to obsessed with the xBox!
---
Barbecue and Chili, a teachable perk from Leatherface (The Cannibal). Helps with tracking survivors and earning bloodpoints.
---
You are not affected by snares/dream pallets.
---
Upside to being awake: If you're awake you can't trigger or see dream snares. The same applies to dream pallets. You are also unaffected by some addons that slow action speed in the dream world. Also, the more survivors are awake, the longer Dream Projection's cooldown will be.
---
Upside to being asleep: You can spot Freddy from a distance, as he will be invisible if you try to spot him long range in the real world.
---
Nurse is easily best survivor
---
Instructions unclear, moried a baby Dwight.
---
It was very unfortunate that Ben Tramer wore both an almost identical mask to Michael‚Äôs AND blue overalls. Like, talk about misfortune.
---
fair enough lmao
---
Happened to me once, after I got hit by a chainsaw. For a moment I thought my monitor just died. That's just end for you.
---
ADAB. This should become a meme. Lol
---
YOU FRIG OFF, BOBANDY!
---
I love the people complaining that they can't pallet loop nurse. I'm over here like "dude that's what makes her such a fun killer. You have to actively try to juke her based on her playstyle to beat her and that's what FUN is"
---
More often than not people don‚Äôt even look at the comment, if it‚Äôs downvoted it‚Äôs bad, sheep mentality
---
DBD is a strange beast. I met a lot of women playing it online, and unlike at least me, who was getting talked shit on since counter strike days, and saw all the insults under the sun, a lot of them just can't take being called a cunt or getting say to go kill yourself. From my jaded man perspective it also seems stupid, that people can't take being tbaged or blinded by flashlight. But on other hand, I'm glad we have a lot diversity here, where different opinions are expressed. And most people who play are teens and they just haven't been molded by a real world yet. Living in a bubble just to find out 99% of people are assholes is hard. And living let's say with suicidal thoughts could be life ending, if after every match you hear "go kill yourself".
---
Freddys map just had 4 or 5 new potential layouts added to it where as before it was always the same and only totems and pallets moved slightly.
---
The game works in Realms, most realms have several maps that can be chosen within that realm but then each of those maps randomize to some degree... the maps are split into tiles which move around why the same map can look a bit different. Then when the configuration is picked the game populates the gens hooks pallets and totems.
---
There are some great videos on it that show how you can run a specific tile and such. Instead learn the tiles when you recognize a tile you'll then recognize if it has a totem where in that tile it will be.
---
Here is the wiki that explains it better you can also do some googling on it.
---

This happens to me way to much
---
r/dbdgonewild is wack
---
He should tho
---
I was also surprised.
---
Yup, I wasn't trying to be a downer or anything mind you. Some are just not aware of all of BHVR other work they just know BHVR = DBD and saw the netflix tease and then assumed it had to be dbd content.
---
Just trying to spread some info in the fog.
---
What is F.U.N?
---
Maybe! If that game also had a Claudette then most likely. He loved to camp lol
---
Spam blinding is not toxic.
---
That thing nobody has playing DBD
---
Ha! So true. Just complaining, and constant raging.
---
No one left behind

And then realize that your a useless teammate that didn't get rid of the dull totems and won't bother to look at the end
---
i saw the flair and i knew what was coming
---
+3 blink nurses are usually trash
---
Blink range nurses on the other hand. Oh boi.
---
Teabagging at the exit gate still is pretty shitty though, especially if the killer hasn't really been toxic. Also, I'm almost 100% sure Ash wouldn't teabag.
---
nice casual sexism
---
Headphones are vital as a killer.
---
Also agree with the previous reply. As a new killer you're going to get stomped, that's just how it is.
---
Play for points and experience not wins and ignore the salt. If someone needs to lord it over a random player they've just beaten on a video game it says something about their overall level of self worth.
---
Ash's main trait is that he's cocky and arrogant, he totally would
---
Nice

I GOT 4 STACKS OF "WGLF" AND THE HOST DC'D. ALL THAT BP GRINDING FOR NOTHING. BHVR HURRY UP WITH THE DEDICATED SERVERS. HOLY SHIT.
---
Ash would 100% teabag.
---
You need to watch the show and movies, or if you have, watch them again
---
the upside of being awake while playing against freddy is that you can see and play the game while conscious. the downside to being asleep while playing against freddy, or against any killer for that matter, is that you'll lose right away and your console will have to turn off by itself via your power save settings.
---
The twist: she is the train.
---
WHAT
---
Well, the argument they make is that those slots are wasted when they could‚Äôve been used for characters from the franchise. A die-hard MK fan is much more likely to want even an unpopular franchise character like Reiko or Havok than say Spawn or Leatherface.
---
Break line of sight. Don't run in a straight like, don't cut back on corners, keep running and sway back and forth. BE VERY UNPREDICTABLE, she's beatable. Don't let anyone tell you she's OP, she's not.
---
Developers: makes a game an purposefully balances it around the fact that players can't communicate vocally.
---
Players: use third party apps and built in console party systems to bypass the balance of the game, skewing the balance to one side over the other.
---
You: this is totally fine and y'all are pussies.
---
Do you not see the problem? I don't want them to do away with SWF, but I want them to balance the game with it in mind.
---
Moris are not common enough to make a big stink about, neither are insta heals imo.
---
You claim you are looking for a discussion, but post cringey insults and make half of your post bitching an moaning about bitching and moaning.
---
An lastly, there have been people just like you every year of this games life claiming the game will be dead within a year, and they've all been wrong as it been out for many years now, what makes you so sure you're right this time?
---
Ruin/tinkerer/whispers/PWYF. 
---
Double pink add-ons obv.
---
Best map would be shelter woods, suffocation pit, backwater swamp, or Ormond resort
---
Note which survivor is the obsession at the start by hitting esc and matching the name to get PWYF faster. Get all 3 stacks ASAP.
---
Shack windows are good for stalk. Pretend to start going around when they're on the other side, then as they pass the window stare at them.
---
If the last survivor keeps going into lockers, you need to try trapping them with a body block. The smaller 2 story building, the "cursed cabin", on grim pantry for example, until the gen is repaired there you can trap a survivor in the lower level. Just make sure to face right on the staircase, as the survivor falls off your shoulder on the left side.
---
Also, rank reset was today. You should wait a bit for an easier time.
---
Inb4 4 D/C
---
‚ÄúUuh‚Äù
---
He also doesn‚Äôt have a terror radius when you‚Äôre asleep so he can easily be right up on your ass since the lullaby is two dimensional now.
---
I play mostly killer and I hate that it feels necessary on many killers. Gens can often pop too fast (no that isn't toxic in my eyes) also slowing gens down won't solve the problem. I wish the game had some secondary objectives of some kind. Maybe not ones necessary to escape but ones that could temp survivors from their objective maybe with blood points or items.
---
Then we can make ruin less meta and run more fun perks.
---
you're pretty lame
---
Nice.
---
When someone finds a bug 
---
after an update
---
ITS THE ONLY WAY FINN
---
Yeah that map sucks, but I always chuckle when I wandering through the bamboo an suddenly get stuck on something an it turns out to be a survivor hiding there.
---
We both just look at each other confused before I smack them and start a chase.
---
I disagree. in fact I kinda think this idea ruins the point of chucky (no offense)
---
He‚Äôs a doll with the soul of a murderer inside. If he suddenly had spider legs and wasn‚Äôt just a doll, he wouldn‚Äôt give the feeling of being a doll, just a crummy ‚Äúdoll suddenly transforms‚Äù gimmick that I genuinely hate. 
---
The only gimmick I can see working for him is some kind of way they can make chucky dolls spawn all around the map, the soul can switch between them at will but the killer can‚Äôt down on second hit, they instead cause that orange bar to occur (the self mend thing, forgot name) and can down on third hit instead. Survivors can sabotage the dolls, but they regenerate a full minute after sabotage and can only sabotage one at a time. There‚Äôs 4 Dolls (6 with an addon active) in total. His Mori has a downed survivor lay on their back, grabbed by the collar of their shirt by chucky, and stabbed repeatedly in the head. Chucky let‚Äôs go of his grip and walks away.
---
Prettygoodjobsofar.png
---
Did the other guy escape?
---
Wanna play a match?
---
I‚Äôd take a Druid character but maybe just as a cosmetic for legion
---
I love any shrine that gives me perks from surv I havent bought. Detectives hunch finally!!
---
Oh, then remove decisive strike as well and make people suffer punishments for their teammate‚Äôs mistakes more often.
---
I‚Äôd like him but idk how they would do it without changing the character a lot it‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs so short but if they do plan to add him it‚Äôll be difficult so I‚Äôd rather they focus more on the game and killers that would be easier to put in than Chucky and maybe save him for later
---
He's one of the only Major horror icons left. I'm sure he's on their mind.
---
REVEL IN THEIR SALT.
---
? Did he escape too?  Guessing he did, but seemed like he didn't make it.
---
Yeah, I just noticed I messed that up. 
---
My bad.
---
I think you make a lot of good points but the way you present them so aggressively is what‚Äôs making people downvote and bash you. And I personally don‚Äôt care about Reddit karma so here‚Äôs my view on some of the points you raised.
---
Swf: I agree that the people making topics about how it needs to be removed or that guy who said something like ‚ÄúWe should be told when the lobby is swf!‚Äù is just ridiculous. Just throw a 25% killer bp gain for every swf survivor in the match. Maybe give killers a small buff when going against a full 4 man. Idk.
---
Moris: They‚Äôre bullshit. You make a good point in that an instaheal or adrenaline don‚Äôt compare at all. Having to hit a survivor one extra time to down them does not compare at all to a killer taking a survivor out of the game after only hooking them once. Especially when most killers will tunnel off hook to use the mori so unless you have BT they only have to hit you one more time to kill you. They need to be only usable on death hook.
---
Facecamping/Tunneling: BHVR‚Äôs stance on this is bizarre and shows their killer bias. Their solution was to lower bp gain the longer you‚Äôre camping. Any killer that is camping doesn‚Äôt give a shit about bp or pipping. They just want to ‚Äúwin‚Äù or be an asshole. BHVR created EGC in large part because killers were getting their feelings hurt about teabagging and survivors not leaving until killers showed up to watch. But yet they can‚Äôt create an animation of the Entity coming up and holding the killer down in place while they camp the hook so a survivor can be unhooked safely or have the hook disappear as a punishment for camping? I‚Äôd even be fine if they had that and made it so it doesn‚Äôt trigger during EGC so they can get their one kill.
---
Lobby dodging: Also bullshit. Survivors aren‚Äôt allowed to see which killer they are going against exactly to prevent dodging. But killers get to see everything. They need to make it so that everyone loads in at the same time regardless of swf or solo status (I know they did this briefly before but they need to bring it back) And they need to not show the killer the actual survivors, just a human shadow silhouette. And have an icon to show if the survivor is holding an item (but not show exactly what item it is). With those ideas in place you wouldn‚Äôt even have to have a penalty for closing a lobby.
---
I could also see them taking a poll, and eliminating some of the 5 original realm maps, before ever stopping production on new maps. 
---
I'm sure the community could comfortably vote on taking away, say atleast one map from: Coldwind, MacMillan, and Azarovs. If no
---
t two. If this were to ever become an issue.
---
Always stay awake if you can. Freddy gets too much power if everyone is asleep.
---
Don't go for the clock if it's across the map though. Ask nearby mate to wake you up or fail a check skill.
---
I‚Äôm not masking it at all.
---
Ahh, you seem to have done got me good sir. Tally ho my fine fellow.
---
3DC 1 Hatch\*
---
The only thing that really bothers me about licensed characters is the Ghostface fuckery.
---
BHVR said since before the very first fucking DLC was released that most DLC would come in the form of chapters, and that ALL chapters would be 1 Killer, 1 Survivor, and 1 map.
---
Then, all because of a licensing deal we get the Ghostface chapter. That comes with... Ghostface?
---
Fuck outta here. Pretty sure even with LF they didn‚Äôt try to claim it was a whole fucking chapter.
---
Do you guys in game report people who DC?
---
A fan of our boy scott jund, a man of class i see
---
I would let them have hatch too after hitting
---
But also at the same time, OP brought a cypress, and when you can pull off a cypress, you use the cypress, can‚Äôt let that burn go to waste
---
Note that it gets harder and harder to wake up via another person because it takes longer and longer to complete the wake up action each time you wake up and fall asleep again. The easiest action is not always the best one.
---
Virtue signaling is more like a humblebrag for political correctness. For a really over the top example, think of someone criticizing a game's racial diversity (all white folks, for instance) in a setting where having a token individual of another race wouldn't make sense. Like... I dunno, something set in a very old feudal Japan, where virtually everyone was, well, Asian. Anime tends to do this and make the chargers look Caucasian. One example is Inuyasha.
---
The only example that has actually happened was a few months ago on Rockpapershotgun. Someone wrote an article talking about the lack of racial diversity in Granblue Fantasy (if you wanted, you could look back in my comment history to find the thread over there. It got locked.) They went on to say that the minority characters were "eye rolling stereotypes" if my memory serves me, and that's just not right at all. So the article came off as nothing more than "Look at me, calling out this game for being unrepresentative!"
---
You obviously haven't played long enough to see this in action.
---
Atleast you have a cute little hat on
---
He doesn‚Äôt need to chill. It‚Äôs a discussion topic. He‚Äôs discussing the topic. He wasn‚Äôt even aggressive or swearing. But fuck him for bringing up an opposing opinion, I guess?
---
Hey, if he's actually good I'll eat my words.
---
Gross, advertising.
---
You got SANDBAGGED. You just don‚Äôt need to throw down pallets all the time also.
---
So you‚Äôre saying he could just crop out that bottom centimeter of image and be fine then?
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people say they would have given her the hatch
---
I am proud to announce the Dweet made it out alive with me. He is safe and sound
---
Honestly DCing on either side is crappy. It makes it harder for each side to pip and just makes the game less fun.
---
Damn. You're my hero &gt;_&lt;
---
Very new to this game. Having a blast although it's taking me some time to figure everything out. This kind of happened to me last night.  Killer brought me to hatch and hit it to tell me to jump in.  What is the reason for this?  I am trying mad hard to learn all the little things and big things but this had me so confused.   Also any guides I should check out?
---
Kate looks like a werewolf mid transformation and sounds like a seagull. Jane and David tho, I feel that.
---
2 mins ain't farming, that's just going for a short game.
---
Can you see blood spots in feral frenzy?
---
F
---
He could. That would look funny though.
---
&gt;Do you people really lack that much of confidence that you can‚Äôt play against people who are talking to each other?
---
As if confidence is the reason SWF is so disliked.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying although giving them a quick ‚Äúunsportsmanlike report‚Äù only takes a second. Longer than it took to load the game to begin with.
---
Now I Killer that makes a wall made out of the entity behind him
---
Actually, I just tested this out. Went into KYF and tried it. The grass does not move, but you can hear it move. 
---
Furthermore, I can‚Äôt get the grass or corn to move with any killer. Corn and grass is not moving with any killer, but it is making a sound with the killers. I wonder if that is a bug or an all around change?
---
I could swear it used to move with killers.
---
Ah, yes. The classic "attempt to turn a corner or jump into a locker" playstyle that doesn't do shit against competent Nurses with meta perks.
---
Literally happened to me today ... NEA.
---
Genitalia should be longer
---
Just curious how does the nurse play into this? Can't any killer do that?
---
I thought I was good at this game but then I decided to play after rank reset, and there were so many prayer beads spirits, camping bubbas and camping huntresses. I have never want to quit this game so bad in my life. I just wanted to get back to purple ranks on survivor D:
---
She‚Äôs the only one who can teleport through agate that hasn‚Äôt opened yet.
---
Oh hey that‚Äôs not too bad. Lol I‚Äôve never even reported anyone yet
---
Despite the fact that she's gotta go through her fatigue stun if she wants to open a locker XD. Locker juking is literally foolproof against nurse.
---
Now, I am not able to get grass or corn to move with ANY killer. Tried in KYF. 
---
With all killers, including phase walking Spirit, I was able to HEAR grass and corn move as survivor, but could not get it to move at all with killers. 
---
It moved fine with survivors. Is that universal now that the environment doesn‚Äôt react to any killers?
---
So does a pink Elephant costume but we're getting that for Clown :/
---
I MET USSYLIS IN A LOBBY AND THE KILLER DISCONNECTED AS SOON AS THE MATCH STARTED
---
THANKS FOR MAKING ME WASTE MY BPS, BABY HUNTRESS
---
There's a lot of randomness involved but usually generator and totem spawn makes it more killer sided from my experience.
---
It's established that Chucky still posses the strength of a full grown man if not greater, Chucky is actually pretty swole my dude.
---
What is this from though
---
EXCEPT YOU FORGET I'M THE ONE PERSON RUNNING WAKE UP SO IT'S NOT THAT BAD OF AN EVENT!
---
Facts
---
The power of seeing a mori or a shroud lol. Most of the times when this happens the killer has an ebony and or pink add ons and the back of my mind I‚Äôm thanking god someone dc‚Äôd out of there lol Bc lord I‚Äôm not strong enough haha
---
Either'd be cool.
---
It depends on the killer, spirit doesn‚Äôt have the same advantage as doctor
---
bro... your name should be FaZe chriswyatt918
---
Fucking tomahawk god
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
There‚Äôs some fair balance on some maps. Other maps the scale is WAY too tilted in one sides favor.
---
Iridescent king? No thanks just use calm and order
---
It's an instinct in this game, you fear the death of your comrades more than yourself
---
Then why does it have the lowest survival rate?
---
How do you post clips like this that play without clicking? I can‚Äôt seem to do it off my twitch clips and it‚Äôs killing meeeee
---
That's the only head I wear for my Nea. It's literally her best head cosmetic since it covers her ugly face
---
Not sorry i wish he killed you..dh is sucks but still saved you ;-; interesting
---
Its irony
---
I actually helped a survivor escaped, because all his mates ragequitted, NONE SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND
---
For survivors the loop is a bit looser. I play both and can notice it. 
---
And all M1 killers are easier to juke when they are on controller. The analog stick is just not as accurate. The wiggle juke when you are close (and the killer is baiting DH) is much easier to pull off when the killer is on controller.
---
I think its the one map I'd truly consider absolutely killer sided. Besides I guess the spirit's map. Feels like you really need balanced landing on that map otherwise you are going to have a bad time.
---
Doctor has no real advantage over spirit. At higher ranks those harder skill checks don't matter. I'd say it's a good map for spirit since her fast mobility means it will be very easy to patrol generators. 
---
Doctor will just get looped at the many pallets and windows.
---
I'll be picking up bloodhound
---
rip pallet, was thrown down for salt and not looped
---
I tested it in the farm map and I could hear the corn move as survivor. Unless her feet sound like crunching grass, then it was her footsteps. 
---
Did you notice that the grass/corn/bamboo now doesn‚Äôt move for ANY killer now?
---
Who knows, it probably has a lot to do with low rank survivors skewing the numbers. 
---
I'm talking about red ranks, where survivors actually know the map and know that they have a shit ton of safe pallets to burn through.
---
I'm pretty sure you're experiencing confirmation bias.
---
But I'm still gonna take the bait and say that Neas are probably the worst in chases and therefore It could be possible that killers are drawn to them.
---
Yea ig, I just seem that adding cross-play would do so much for DBD I‚Äôm the future, its getting a lot more hate then I thought. And hopefully that would mean you could bring your data from console to pc when I make the switch which is in like a couple of months
---
They're talking about the map, not the game as a whole. Lol
---
happened to me twice yesterday, i had a yellow mori one game for a ritual, guess who didn‚Äôt get the ritual
---
yeah i don't know why they didn't call ghostface's chapter a paragraph dlc
---
But she staggers after using Blink. I can see how she cant be looped, but thats it.
---
&gt;maps like institute and Gideon
---
Ah yes, a map that is pretty good for survivors against any non-stealth killer and one of the easiest maps in the game for survivors.
---
Were these intended to be examples of maps that are not survivor sided?
---
Anytime something like that doesn't make sense, "the entity did it". Haha
---
For real tho, the entity "empowers" the killers so they can do things they normally couldn't.
---
Feel like i read that somewhere, anyways.
---
Lmao well thanks for reading ;)
---
Depends if the killer has whispers or not
---
And it‚Äôs getting worse as the time goes on. Your point?
---
LOL
---
She has potential to be, with add-ons. If you ask me, if i outplay you on four blinks ‚Äî and you need the fifth to hit me‚Äî then that‚Äôs the ability making you get me, not you utilizing the ability to get me. Vanilla nurse is fun to go against imo because it‚Äôs a pretty different playstyle than other killers. So-called ‚Äúomega-blink‚Äù nurse and 4 or 5 blink nurse is just overdoing it.
---
UP
---
you're right to believe she sucks. everyone else is just crazy. i heard that for some reason she's good on PC but not on PS4/xbox. but i don't see why that matters
---
Why would you assume that you all are entitled to escape every single game?
---
Personally, I use the Blink to either scare the ever-living shit out of people, make distance, or try and cut off Survivors. I'm enjoying Nurse a lot, tbh.
---
FUCKING SQUADETTE. THAT IS ALL.
---
The Fate
---
I think he was talking about The Game map lol
---
Anyone know the name of the second song? The Halloween theme remix with Jigsaw's voice?
---
"They beat him up in school"
---
That was pretty good.... and oddly enough somewhat accurate
---
No matter who the killer is, if they are bad you can loop them as long as you want.
---
Just finished a 2 minute game against the hag. She planted her copies at any hook and timed us all out
---
The second one I would never use because healing with 3 people is already quick. The last one would be interesting.
---
Saw a cool [video](https://youtu.be/l1RV4nTJBZg) where it's used in a gimmick build.
---
D-daddy is that you?
---
that is what shows when you use a flashlight to destroy traps, bug im assuming?
---
Honestly, I don't think she's op, but I also don't really think she's designed very well lol. It just doesn't seem much like the devs had the games mechanics in mind imo. She's pretty much indisputably the best killer in the game by a long shot, cuz she can just straight up ignore most of the stuff survivors have to gain distance on a chasing killer.
---
That makes sense, and I definitely see that lol
---
Snoopydoopy1103 ive played against you on ps4, that is not your first time playing. ive quit too and blocked you because you gen hump and hook camp. The wait time for a match against you is not worth my time.
---
Its a preference thing. Do you prefer to be a killer or have someone tell the tale. I wouldnt have even if im merciful at times
---
Nope but I wish I could
---
Neas aren‚Äôt the worst, Claudettes on the other hand are always boosted
---
I'm not a game developer I've only dabbled in some programming early in my IT career and my understanding of it is basic at best. However to my understanding its a complicated area of work. It takes time.
---
Maybe do some research on what goes into game development might give you an idea.
---
Big huge games like gta and red dead for example took hundreds upon hundreds of people across multiple studios with a huge budget... and their development time was 5+ years.
---
Point being making games are not easy or fast.
---
Dbd has a smaller team and smaller budget which also plays a roll they can only focus on so much. Also sometimes to make one change you need to put other changes into play first
---
Like dedicated servers will allow them more control in tracking for things like disconnects and matchmaking and so on.
---
Dead by daylight isn't perfect it has its bugs some frustrating others funny and when some get fixed new ones pop up that's the nature of changing coding. but they keep a better pace on content and fixes better then most games. They also are one of the few developers I've seen to have a high level of communication and community involvement.
---
I mean they could do like most big studios and tell us nothing leave us waiting weeks or months at a time between patches with no certain release dates and no idea on where they want to take the game or what they are working on. They could also just not listen to community feedback and release what they want and call it done.
---
But we get a roadmap, we get change logs, we get posts on their plans and what's in progress/status updates, we get live Q&amp;A dev streams. All good info and they usually deliver on what they promise.
---
Heck they already got our money and the games a few years old they could just cut support completely call it done and start a new project.
---
But no we get frequent content and an ever growing and changing game.
---
I also get the frustration of wanting change for the better and sooner then later and I'm not trying to be an ass here and may be coming off like one or some super fanboy.
---
I'm sure they are working as fast as they can they may not be perfect but BHVR has shown this isn't just a cash cow game for them its also a labour of love. 3 years in and they are hoping to keep it going for many more years.
---
not worried about that since I can see anyone in range while in FF, its after I stab everyone
---
I wanna play survivors lmaooo
---
Ur butthole itches
---
I know. I was just using my own confirmation bias to prove my point.
---
Exactly some things just can't be changed in the current environment. That's why dedicated servers taking that hosting from the killer is a big first step in making things better. I can only imagine how monstrous the changes on their side has to be to move it all from a peer to peer framework to a dedicated one.
---
PC and PS4. What‚Äôs your favorite color? Are we just asking random questions now?
---
would you like some fries with that salt?
---
The entire ranking and prestige system was not well though out and needs a complete revamp.
---
Susie has her hands in her sweater so he doesnt need to draw them
---
Had the same thing happen to me today, only happened to a few traps though. No one brought any rainbow maps either
---
I report survivors that give me death threats, call me racist names, or otherwise harass me to PSN administration.
---
Oh and then I laugh my ass off when I read: **"We have taken the necessary action."**
---

---
You just have to be good at running the killer, and by that I mean looping with route planning. When you run OoO you expect the killer to come for you, so you had better be prepared when he shows up. For the perk to be worth running you need to make the most out of the information it gives you, and minimize the penalties of using it.  
---
  
---
One thing that can help you use the perk effectively is to pair it with Jeff's perk distortion. This will allow you hide your aura three times for 10 seconds. There's also a tech you can do with this, since distortion blocks scratch marks as well, where you use OoO to proc distortion and erase your scratch marks.
---
i have all of janes cosmetics
---
At what rank?
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt feel like being downvoted to oblivion cuz you all can‚Äôt handle the truth. 
---
Jesus Christ you're pathetic. You have no right having a go at people in this community when you're terrified of losing a few online numbers that make no impact on your life.
---
My point, is that you have no valid points at all.
---
She's from stranger things
---
Don't be the noob who constantly hides at the slightest heartbeat. Sometimes it's better to stay and finish whatever it is your doing. And don't be afraid to get into chases. Low level survivors usually don't last long in chases, even against low level killers. But the only way to get better at them is to be in them. Looping is probably the most valuable skill you can learn to do. And it will take time. You'll start to notice things you didn t notice before and will get better, it just takes some experience.
---
You seem super sensitive and it shows.
---
I went for tips, I came back with a Huntress fetish
---
*love
---
Can he jump very high? Cause strengh won't be enough to Hook someone.
---
Well every killer should be viable to play, even if they are the worst choice, you should be able to get a 4k against similarly skilled opponents if you play well
---
Omg dude chill 2x haha
---
People that want killer attention wear flashy clothes. Most people confident enough to want killer attention are hard to down. Very low rank killers learn flashy clothes people are hard to down and try to remove them ASAP (only later do they learn to leave them for last and get the low-hanging fruit first).
---
Dont stress too much about dying. You'll die so much as a new player. The first 100 hours gonna be like that and eventually as you play, you will start to learn how the different  maps and loops look like etc. Watch some streamers on twitch is also a good idea and look out for how they run loops and tiles.
---
Just had a devious idea.

For freddy.

If 2 people are a gen, you'll know.

Meh,my second choice would be dr gordon since he did survive.
---
Unbreakable has value.
---
Got everything for Kate. Now im waiting for her next cosmetic
---
for survivor:
---
Don't listen to people that tell you to play claudette for self care. having it teaches bad habits
---
Play dwight and use bond to learn from your allies more easily. watch what others are doing
---
Try to play stealthy as the beginning.
---
Try to do gens close to the middle of the map at the start of the game and work your way from there. there are 7 gens on the map, 5 to be fixed. you can expect a gen in each corner, one in the middle and two next to the walls. do those in the corners last.
---
After getting used to skillchecks, watch a few looping tutorials on youtube and try to engage into chases a bit to get used to being chased. Don't worry if you die. You're here to practice.
---
for killer:
---
Rule number one is to actually play killer sometimes. playing on both sides will help you a lot
---
Don't worry if survivors escape. you're here to practice
---
Try not to stay near a hooked person. Get used to looking for another target ASAP to apply pressure
---
Why would anyone get mad? Is it the price tags that follow them? Because if it‚Äôs that, then people need to stop complaining. Running and developing a game isn‚Äôt free.
---
I pretty much give up looking for ruin on Lery‚Äôs or the Game, i almost never find them on those maps.
---
legit didn't know this after 1100 hrs lol. ty sir
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pathetic!‚Äù 
---
You sound just as mad as I am! Join the club sweetie :-)
---
Anyone who uses the word Toxic is Toxic and cringey
---
I mean, half the time they'll just crouch around and do nothing. I had an urbanly evading Nea against a scratched mirror Myers on The Game map. No, I don't rely on my team because they usually let me down, and the times they do generators, noed exists anyways to make sure that even if the killer did poorly, they still get a pity kill. That's why I consider it a crutch
---
You probably love to piss people off online don‚Äôt you. Stir the pot even worse.  Yikes 
---
I bet you‚Äôre fucking ugly too lmao
---
People who say noed is counterable probably don't play solo survivor, and thus don't have a say in how solo survivors should feel about it
---
Every other killer has to chase, usually with a movement speed of 4.6 m/s, as compared to survivors 4.0 m/s. In other words they catch up at 0.6 m/s. Nurse can catch up instantly. You can't last more than a few seconds if you run away from her in a straight line, unlike other killers. Your only option is to break line of sight, and move around objects. Even then if she guesses right she will instantly down you.  
---
With that in mind, there is still a reasonable amount of counterplay to Nurse's base kit. The problem is when you throw in the addons. Normally other killers addons affect their power, but don't directly affect their chase speed. With Nurse this is not the case. Improving her blinks is the equivalent of improving another killers base movement speed, and drastically affects the game. On top of this Nurse's range addons are bugged in a way that is gamebreaking. First, the range increase doesn't mean charge for longer to go farther, it means charge for the same amount of time and go farther. This means that you get a shitload of charge speed, and can blink the same distance much faster. Again, this is the equivalent of giving another killer a shitload of base movement speed. Second, the downside to the addons, decreased blink accuracy, does absolutely nothing. I've tested this myself in KYF, and it is a non-stat.  
---
Nurse is the strongest killer in the right hands, even without any addons. That should tell you something about the state of balance. If you want to see what it looks like when a strong player plays Nurse I'll give you an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM5vTsjYqXU). Quite frankly I think the question is whether or not nurse is balance before addons. She is clearly broken with the addons she has now.
---
Ok but why isn‚Äôt this post MORE gay??
---
Darn diddle, I am toxic, but you also used the work toxic and that sentence
---
&gt;You probably love to piss people off online don‚Äôt you
---
Inaccurate
---
&gt;I bet you‚Äôre fucking ugly
---
Accurate
---
For now, Avoid chases. Go stealth. So you practice your checkpoints instead without dying. When you get discovered over several hours you'll get good at chases. Definitely look up videos everyday after you're done playing. Spectate people who are good when you die. Learn from them. 
---
Always stay productive. Unless it's absolutely necessary you hide. Run EMPATHY (claudette perk) so you can see your allies at long distances, and have the courage to stay productive. 
---
if you see 1 of your teamates keeping the killer busy (aura that allows you to see hurt teamates at a good distance)- you'll remain productive &amp; cautious. Also so you can determine your role &amp; find your allies when you can't find a generator. EMPATHY-GREEN PERK.
---
Running leaves scratch marks- I recommend a level 3 lightweight (not a 1 or 2)
---
I play on Xbox and we got bill! (: my girlfriend on ps4 has him too!(:
---
I've asked the same question. The popular theme was it's the add ons that make them op, base kit they're just fine.
---
The map has a good idea just poorly executed
---
I'm the person that usually gets most gens done, runs the killer around for the longest and uses every bit of knowledge to my advantage. If we're nearing the end, I do generators. If we're at the start, and the killer is chasing someone else, I will self care(A lot of killers will hit one survivor, then chase another to slow down the game)
---
Especially against spirit, you might not even have time to find a survivor to heal you. And even then, you have to spend time finding them, on top of the 32 seconds total you waste with the heal(16 seconds for one person healing another = 32 seconds, or 32 seconds to self-care)
---
Cant wait for good connections and no lag. Def is going to change the laggy range some killers may have.
---
Then why did you state in a response to Fennery,
---
 "I just can‚Äôt see myself face camping because of something!!! If I did play killer I probably would be decent, fair at least, because I know what it‚Äôs like."
---
This claim is the opposite of what you just said to me, and strongly insinuates you don't at killer at all.
---
So you stand by what? You think killers are pussies for avoiding players that break the balance of the game? That you think DbD will be dead in a year? All you've done is make childish exclamations and resort to insulting anyone that disagrees with your biased, and wrong, opinions.
---
Maybe you should practice what you preach, an act like an adult with some composure an not like some 14 yr old you lost too.
---
I thought. Cya lata!!!!
---
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU FUCKERS T--BAG?
---
IT LITERALLY ONLY IRRITATES THE FUCK OUT OF ME AND MAKES IT EASIER TO CATCH YOU!
---
DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT I AM FUELED BY MY OWN RAGE? MY OWN SALT?!
---
T-BAGGING INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF DYING AND GETTING CAMPED.
---
ALSO, IF YOU T-BAG AND COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING CAMPED, SHUT THE FUCK UP! FUCK YOU.
---
AND FUCK WHOEVER'S READING THIS. I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
---
FUCK!
---
I find that it discourages killers enough that at least some people have turned away from tunneling because they pretty much expect to get stabbed in the neck
---
Yes! Hopefully hitboxes will be more clear too. Especially with the Huntress.
---
I'd rather be ugly than be a sapüëç
---
Xbox has a good amount of people but honestly if u don‚Äôt have friends that play on pc it might be easier to get people to play with on Xbox but if u have pc friends pc is the way to go
---
Op as fuck you mean. The whole team takes it and 4 gens get done within a minute.
---
Also, Camping is a low rank issue, so i suggest you climb ranks to avoid that. Tunneling, albeit an annoyance, is still a strategy an the best choice to target the weaker of 2 targets. So If your teammates are making unsafe unhooks on you, get mad at them an not the killer taking advantage of a bad play on your team's behalf.
---
I play on Xbox but I would have to recommend PC.
---
A lot of the controls for some killers can be frustrating on console, and there are just generally more players on PC, otherwise it‚Äôs a little harder to find lobbies.
---
I'm not disagreeing that it's a good combo, I'm just saying I rarely see it because most survivors prefer to run perks that make their chase easier, as opposed to perks that reward you for being good at chasing
---
Also, I don't get why survivors would complain about it. It's only effective if the killer is effective, and it's a lot better than other options like bamboozle or noed, both which can drastically reduce chase duration
---
I just recently used a map with red twine. It showed hags' traps.
---
Yeah, he was supposed to be added. I couldn't remember if that was still on to-do list or already done though, which was why I said he was the only thing I knew was missing
---
Run empathy or bond over self care. Some people can play properly with self care, but over all most teammates waste time. I use to run it too, and it's definitely a crutch. I really love empathy, cause I can get a lot of information from it. ALMOST better then spine chill as a 6th sense. Bond is good too, but the range lacks on maps that are huge.
---
*Wheezing for 5 minutes intensifies*
---
The hitbox is the same size for every killer.
---
Upvoted for great username
---
I love The Fate. His bio is already prewritten, and the fog took him after the car crash. His ability is a Myers-like stalk system. At Tier 3 a coin is flipped and you can insta down or even Mori certain survivors who've already been hooked.
---
It‚Äôs a high quality one I enjoyed it lol
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Lmao when I get home I'll msg you the other yous name so you can keep an eye out.
---
Yeah I get that alot, no reason to be sweaty until atleast rank 8, cuz then pips get a tad harder to clinch as a Trapper/Legion main lol
---
Thankyou for the help
---
I agree with ya. I really only run Franklin's when I see a key but even if I encounter it it's like whatever it doesn't assist them in a chase or give them tracking.
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Im not gonna argue here so your correct
---
Bond is A tier. Empathy is B tier
---
Bond has surprisingly giant range
---
Any time, love troubleshooting little tech mysteries.
---
I use BT, DS, and Kindred because I hate how many facecampers there are lately. I tack on Adrenaline or Balanced Landing depending on how I feel.
---
I‚Äôm not even sure he went to medical school
---
NO KEYS ALLOWED!
---
NOED is for killers that don't know how to play a specific killer in the game.
---
I'll look into it soon. I'm sure that it will be worth a swap, but I do have my doubts (empathy has made me biased)
---
Definitely been trying to get it in my bloodwebs. Still a 1.
---
G2K
---
Maybe he can drag survivors behind them and swing them up onto the hook. Chucky has inhuman strength. I‚Äôm sure the Devs can think of a creative way for him to carry and hook survivors.
---
Smart Spirits do, because they are heavily reliant on sound.
---
&gt;it might be easier to get people to play with on Xbox
---
Why?
---
That poor hag. Checked every tree except the one you were behind üòÇ
---
I used No Mither for the first time last night and I escaped.
---
I was doing adept David and the killer was afk the whole time
---
Bubbas chainsaw: Can teleport you to the nearest survivor to spook the shit out of them
---
The trailer for Freddy's chapter should have just been a sequence of Quentin's transition into gollum, LOTR style
---
Have Tiffany and Chucky in the game. Tiffany carries Chucky and can attack like normal. The power is she lets Chucky go and you play as him for a limited time. Chucky would move fast. It would be like Spirit and Legion mixed. If you knock the survivor down with Chucky and return to being Tiffany you see the aura of them for a few seconds. Tiffany will have to pick Chucky back up to use the power again. She sees the aura of Chucky when he is down. Maybe even have multiple dolls around like Trapper traps.
---
I‚Äôm talking about a swf ... and bc Xbox has a looking for group post so when ever u need people with mics to play with u just create a post on Xbox.. I don‚Äôt play pc so idk if they have something similar beside maybe discord
---
*your totem is being cleansed. SLAUGHTER*
---
50 levels in and no borrowed time or quick and quiet.
---
Would love a texture pack with every item in different colour and polygons. Might be cool.
---
Doubt he will ever be a survivor honestly. Maybe killer someday but I doubt a survivor
---
Dead hard is probably the best at the moment and is useful pretty much everywhere. Balanced landing is good on maps with a lot of verticality; Haddonfield is a perfect example, but balanced can actually be used with other exhaust perks because it always lessens the landing frames. Sprint burst is pretty niche, it is alright, but you can't move as fast around the map unless you're willing to get caught without having it
---
That serpentine probably killed her Lmao.
---
I would say "Add Jason Voorhees" but Idk what they could do with him ability wise. I would know a few perks that could fit him though.
---
Whenever it is, I have 13 Gruesome Gats I've squirreled away waiting for it.
---
I'm finna make it rain BP on everyone I play with for 13 matches lol
---
*phoenix wright has entered the game* OBJECTION
---
Buy me a pair too.
---
Nah its diaper jake
---
With me, When i call out i say "I think-" cause I dont even trust myself when I see the killer
---
You didnt fail if you ask me. Looks nice!
---
We are not allowed to complain about these because then we would be entitled survivor mains...
---
Anything that can be described with "weeb music"
---
Actually, it's sarcasm. It would be irony if you said it was bad while trying to show how good it was and then failed
---
PC for sure. Better frames, easier control over melee swings and killers like Huntress and nurse. Nothing is stopping you from plugging your controller into the PC if you really wanted to use one. Steam charts is recording Dead by daylight to have about 30,000 players a month so I don't think you have to worry about the amount of people playing.
---
The concept of gen rushing is dumb what else are we supposed to do?
---

---
Damn you beat me to it! Bastard!
---
Chucky is 2 feet tall. It could work.
---
didn‚Äôt feel like actually drawing the killers since it‚Äôs more for that cutesy healing we got the power vibe that the survivors have and the nurse is more of a meme in the background if anything
---
ty, I thought it would be a funny lil addition and all and I‚Äôm glad others like it!
---
This killer isn't using headphones. I can tell you that. Happens to me all the time. (Hag too)
---
And the louder sound of injured survivors will mess that up and make them miss. So good Spirits don't use it because it's hot garbage.
---
GET PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD AND SUDDENLY LEATHERFACE ISN'T ACTUALLY THAT BAD

Stealth and great mind game skills are required to outgame a quality Nurse. She might be able to ignore most mechanics that other killers can‚Äôt but she still can‚Äôt hit what she can‚Äôt see.
---
Nope. Just been losing my items for like 5 games for no real reason lol
---
BS. Doctor ends up 3-genning everyone to death and they never reach endgame.

Changes to [version 1.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cmnti8/killer_concept_the_zealot_possessed_armor/):
---
* Added Add-ons! Had a lot of good feedback for what I could use here, so hopefully, this just fleshes it out more.
---
* Added his weapon, the Morningstar
---
* Added stats for movement and Terror Radius
---
* Updated powers and perks based off of feedback from the last thread.
---
* Made minor change to the artwork to make it look more Crusader-y (Art of Possessed Armor credit to: u/limbound from his post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleRite/comments/ayws9w/battleriteart_my_enrtry_for_the_battlerite_art/))  
---
Sorry the bottom looks so crunched, I started running out of room the way I'd started it off, and I was too deep to rearrange it :&lt;  
---
But otherwise, I hope everyone likes it! As always, I love comments and I try to respond to each reply, positive or negative. Let me know what you guys and gals think!
---
Overall is pretty good, the legs need to be thicker.
---
Nea : *lemme just unhook you real quick*   Hillbillys Projection: REEEEEEEEE- (*poof*)
---
Had that happen to me on and off also. The spaghetti code is bugged somewhere.
---
I can never get a game on ps4 ,sat waiting for a lobby a few days ago for 20 mins
---
I think Hag or Freddy are good middle of the road killers. Playing Hillbilly for endurance might go nice with myers since well. M1 killers tend to eat pallets left and right.
---
I was still actually playing F13: Game, when DBD first released on console. Had been watching PC streams beginning in Jan of that year, so knew it would be a game I'd enjoy once it released. But, because of my love for Michael Myers, and seeing how he wasn't launching with the game, I held off for those 2 months, until his DLC was available.
---
Detectives hunch &gt; small game for this reason
---
Just go claudette but the thing is that the stealth mode doesn't work very well at high ranks
---
Claudette prestige 3. You wont find anything better
---
Tunneling is never needed. Why some killers think they must have a 4K for a win baffles me to this day. There are a few notable exceptions to this but points are generally an indicator as to how good you are st killer. You can get a single kill but still have the most points if handled yourself well and pushed the survivors hard. Tunneling is just a trash tactic noobs do. I only tunnel asshole survivors that screw their own teammates over (sandbagging, hookdiving hoping I‚Äôll tunnel the hooked guy back onto hook), otherwise will never do something so low. Play both, know what it‚Äôs like to have your match ruined by a dickhead tunneler/camper. The devs themselves have always said matches are designed to see the killer get 1-2 kills, never 4. If you have to tunnel to get any kills at all then you need to seriously brush up on playing killer.
---
Can someone explain to me what in God‚Äôs name was Dwight even doing?
---
\*Slow clap\* Only good Claudette is skinned and hooked Claudette
---
I‚Äôm not a high rank player and tend not to get sweaty or try/care to much. But if I decide to bring a mori I‚Äôm using it if I get the chance, haha
---
So it's a feature? Oh, didn't know that
---
Real p3 Claudette‚Äôs blend in with the generator.

---
Haha I understand, I just don‚Äôt wanna go so harsh (gameplay wise) on the new guys.
---
Honestly I am fine with both but my heart will always want Jason they could do the ghostface treatment and just get the mask don‚Äôt care still Jason to me
---
Uhhh me never thought I stood a chance
---
What skin is the 1 with the lava colors on players. Not sure if you understand. Looks like lava cracks on the player. I always thought that was P3
---
That's the sound file that was leaked before Ghostface came out right? It sounds similar to Stranger Things, 80's slasher films, Hellraiser and a lot of other things so it's hard to pinpoint based on that. I personally can't see them associating with Jason with how much drama went on, but who knows.
---
Hey I just want to say that this is really well drawn but Isn't this just Scream Ghostface but with a bigger, looser hood?
---
Deerstalker is the strongest possible flex
---
Idk clipping through another persons body would be pretty weird in a horror game
---
That‚Äôs a fantastic idea for the possum play!! I love it!
---
Thank you for the praise, it‚Äôs really appreciated. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it.
---
They used to be a lot darker and they were horrid as a killer. Especially a squadette with them on say Yamaoka Estate or McMillan.
---
I‚Äôm going off the ‚Äúmachete‚Äù part sounds very Jason like to me
---
Same
---
On PC I‚Äôd say that sounds like Legacy. Otherwise I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre hallowed blight cosmetics from the event a while back.
---
90's Icon pack has probably what you're searching
---
I didn't even realise it could go that high, I thought it called at around 1000
---
Dude, Overwhelming presence takes away 90% of efficiency, while streetwise only gives 25% efficiency, counter each other my ass lmao
---
I don't know the timing of healing but I think that if you have the time to heal with botany knowledge you also have 4/5 seconds more to heal normally. I mean you don't heal during a chase unless you start camping pallets or something. Another thing is that during a normal game, against a good killer, you don't heal by yourself so many times to bring a perk completely dedicated to that. Obviously is not completely useless but a good medikit is already enough, that's why I said I can name 2 perks from almost each character that I prefer to use instead of botany knowledge. (Borrowed,ds, adrenaline,quick and quiet, bond, unbreakable, any exhaustion perk, iron will, resilience, and I could go on but I don't remember half of the perks name I'd like to say xD)
---
Not even close
---
But my ass has been hurting from playing/sitting too long everyday...
---
I thought to myself fuck survivor this is so much better more points no lag and in complete control of the my own game weither I win or lose I can only blame myself for losing and dont have to rely on people ever since then I became a kiler main after being a survivor main for over a year
---
That does present a problem, what would he be called? I also have no clue what his abilities or perks would be...maybe something involving mirrors? If they can work that part in he could be called The Reflection.
---
To be fair, they did focus hardcore on specifically Badham for the Freddy rework. I'd say it's likely that they will eventually work on totem spawns for the other maps that need 'em, especially Crotus.
---
Also noed has counterplay cause you can actually do totems. Keys have zero counter play but it isnt complained about.
---
If you don‚Äôt like Claudette, I think Dwight with black shirt and slacks with the black cap (optional) is pretty fun to use.
---
My stream suggested I run No Mither and Self care at purple ranks. I‚Äôve been playing exclusively with No Mither, Sprint Burst, Resiliance and Borrowed time from rank 11-7. So far so good. I recommend someone try it out. It really improves your looping games if you have only one shot to do it right lol.
---
it shows u have 0 points but only the killer loses all his points
---
PERIODDD!
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Oh im talking like in the picture. Like a texture pack. But I doubt thats allowed
---
It is, unfortunately, two days after Rank Reset.
---
It's always a pretty bad time to play right now, since all the toxic kids get thrown into matches with you, and they're too good to lose but not good enough to win.
---
I mean, I was playing as Killer against these two survivors with full perk builds, while mine was two level 1 perks, Franklins as level 3, and then another one level 2. Got told I was a tryhard sweatstain  because I was using a level 1 ruin and the survivors had never encountered a Legion before. It was my fault they had no idea how his mechanics worked and I should have just let them escape, apparently.
---
You'll always encounter the salt, but it should be better by Monday when the ranks normalize.
---
Keys have zero counter play? Franklins counters all items.
---
I'll play devils advocate as well (in a different vein of discussion though). NOED is shit, it's not good and anyone who thinks it's good is extremely far removed from understanding game balance. It's much more rational to run spirit fury, enduring and run through survivors all game then have to wait for late game to power spike with something like NOED, blood warden. That said, without all perks, I understand running NOED. It's a solid B tier perk that can save your ass, especislly if you're fresh to killer and low ranks. At higher ranks, it honestly falls into the C tier, from my perspective.
---
Some more devil's advocate, hatch is also balanced since it rewards survival. Which is the games objective by the way, not doing gens or earning BP. It rewards the final survivor with an opportunity to survive. Keys are interesting and do throw a wrench into the discussion, but overall I'd say it's a niche occurence where more than 1 escapes and only happens 0.5-1% of games.
---
I'm a red rank vet on both sides, survivor main though but the survivor entitlement meme rings of truth, its obnoxious and incredibly annoying that people fail to grasp that dbd is asymmetrical which means that its balanced 4v1 and not 1v1.
---
I‚Äôve watched someone get unhooked, downed the unhooker, hooked them, down the unhooked guy, and get decisive strike‚Äôd.
---
I guess you could add this Tweet to the list.

---
Just another hex perk to always be looking for. Small games a god send
---
Ah so you're the one on gens than. That's good at least. But I can tell with that build you're definitely trying to be stealthy. Just a word of advice for the future, that type of play style will only take you so far.  Nothing wrong with it if that's your thing. But if you want to hit higher ranks, gotta start playing more aggro imo. Or at least know how to do it well when your time comes. 
---
I just hate claudette tbh, I leave lobbies when I see one ü§£ too many games where they farm hooks, cant loop, basically insta kill themselves on hooks, etc, etc, etc.
---
Me hearing a nurse blink: ok its DC time
---
If you play solo, probably 3 months nonstop. If you play swf, you're F. Swf takes like 10-15 minutes to find a match on ps4. 
---
Solo- takes less then a minute. No more then 2 minutes.
---
Imo there is a counterplay when playing against any nurse if she has no addons
---
imagine breaking into a sprint after head onning someone with dance with me..would been nasty
---
If there's a choice between survivors to go for, I'll go for the immersed Claudette every time.
---
1. It's a dull, no-skill way of playing. By all means be stealthy, but relying on a dark outfit to play the game for you is cheap.
---
2. I have no guarantee I'll spot them again, so it's easier to remove them when I have the choice.
---
&gt; and there isn't anything you can do besides never be found.
---
To make matters worse, there are so many anti-stealth perks in this game that stealth is hardly a viable strategy.

As someone who‚Äôs played nurse for about as long as she‚Äôs been released, she is extremely op fundamentally. There are ways to deal with he rod course, however she is in essence game breaking. The biggest offender here obviously being here teleport. It not only negates core game mechanics that help survivors escape killers (tp through pallets, windows, and terrain) 
---
But in the case of pallets and windows, they‚Äôre actually a disadvantage for the survivor.
---
A good nurse player will see you start the animation for vaulting window of pallet, or pulling s pallet down and have a free hit because it locks you in an animation that makes your position 100% predictable.
---
Nurse is game breaking at its simplest definition( ignoring core game mechanics used to help survivor, instead helping killer) 
---
At least, that‚Äôs the biggest reason I consider her op, but I still love her
---
„ÉΩ(#Ôæü–îÔæü)Ôæâ Good!
---
Bad!
---
Oh yes Hillbilly is not a viable killer discussion lol. (In his eyes which is just entirely wrong)
---
See, THIS looks good, how the fuck they Butcher meg and make Nea a mole rat?
---
Buckle up, you‚Äôre pretty much going to run into super sweaty/ toxic killers every other match. The few killers that actually care about making a game fun will definitely make you appreciate the game more though
---
1. People will still camp and tunnel no matter what you try and do about it. BBQ doesn't prevent camping or tunnelling, it just encourages you not to do so. 
---
2. Simple. Bloodpoints. There are so many counters to BBQ now that it often just straight-up doesn't proc, which of course will lead to more people camping. Therefore, BBQ should be buffed so that it procs more often.
---

When you blink your frame rate absolutely ganks and it becomes really difficult to aim
---
Teaming goes on the brand new level, survivors that literally become the killer
---
I just pick up my phone and don't even move, I already know what they're doinh, might aswell dissapoint them.
---
I'll keep that in mind. Regardless I still get tunneled with meg/camped. If the killer has a mori, it's whatevers. That's just bound to happen.
---
Flip-Flop and Knockout
---
No Mither and Selfcare
---
But riddle me this, the scenario you just created about Franklin's is the same scenario just reversed by taking plunderer and RNGing into a skeleton key. It isnt meta or even good considering various other perk options, it's for item farming. 
---
According to this meta data:  https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bxk4hj/ive_analyzed_data_from_over_800_survivor_chests/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjP-YKXxITkAhWKnp4KHZixADcQrAIoADACegQIAxAH&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_NVBbmvRNP4TQvrT21ZwJ
---
Odds of a usable key are 12% give or take. Essentially meaning that of 3 chests that spawn by default, your odds of at least one key, on average, are around 35% assuming you search all three which is incredibly unlikely! Meaning that its unlikely you actually receive help from this in a real game scenario. If it happens, it's incredibly unlucky especially when you factor in survivor rates vs hatch spawns and the various other minutia.
---
Ah yes, I see you're a man of culture
---
The obvious thing to do is all four survivors bullrush the nurse and start a Sally cult
---
I don‚Äôt really think that perk is too necessary for the build is it?
---
Well, technically The Bible refers too Jesus as being God, the first chapter of John is clear on that lol. Not that it matters.
---
Or, maybe a more logic tip, just search for another survivor and let them play "toxic".
---
Like, why should you get emotions on a troll? Its a poor soul who wants attention. Just fuck them.
---
Maybe you will met again, after you kill the other 3 and found the hatch :) And if not, dude seriously who cares. So people can be proud of a number in front of the name? Just play and chill &lt;3
---
Username fits the comment
---
Yea but sending it also requires you to be good at the game
---
Third one with maybe 2/4/6% might be a little better.
---
Well I mean, I also get very salty when I lose my flsshlight since I'm never stocked on them but this guy is just taking the piss lol
---
Never underestimate gen mither
---
it cant be anymore perfect
---
I want to teach BBQ and Chili to the nurse, huntress and hillbilly. 
---
If I leveled up the a killer to level 50 and still can't find BBQ, is it better to reset the rank or keep going ?
---
Dear the dude on his high horse. 
---
Campin is camping. You can throw all kinds of "logic" but it doesn't change the fact you camp. 
---
Not saying camping doesn't work, in your examples the best move is to camp the hook and get the second kill. Ain't no one denying that. But it is camping. 
---
Saying you need an excuse to not camp is a joke. Give yourself the reason. Have some self respect. 
---
You can play smart and still be a camping bitch. 
---
So you win with your 300 iq camping play. But dont try get everyone to give you a round of applause for doing so. It's still camping.
---
Considering against top top top level survivors only Nurse and Spirit have a chance against them while every other Killer is pretty much fucked, yeah, she's kinda necessary.
---
And btw, the idea of the game is to do the gens and escape not loop the killer around a pallet or window, big difference. 
---
A lot of things work against The Nurse like LoS, Quick and Quiet, Iron Will and Dead Hard just to name a few, if you're down quick vs a Nurse, you're either in LoS or don't make use of the perks stated. While I am against saying a perk build for countering a Killer, these are the best ones and almost 90% of the people who moan about Nurse don't use these perks. The other 10% (So the actual top survivors) is moaning about Omega Blink and Multiple Blink, which does break The Nurse into next level OP just like Prayer Beads does on Spirit. Oh and all of those perks work against Spirit too, the other top killer in the game. Every other killer below them for perks is irrelevant.
---
As a final thing to say, finally the devs got The Nurse "correct", they are changing only **Her ADDONS** next and leaving her power as it is like they said in a recent dev stream. I look forward to hopefully never seeing Omega Blink or 3+ Blink Nurse's again.
---
What would you like better, gulag or the guillotine?
---
Only if you are holding rush button. Rushed opening of the box also causes a noise notification afaik
---
This guy gets it.
---
It is true if you are holding the rush button (Shift, RB, R1). Rank 20 rushing boxes in the basement, RIP
---
They had a stalk-off! Unfortunately Dwight forgot his stalking glasses
---
This is awesome dude! Great work. I‚Äôd love to see a nice trapper drawing
---
Y holding out on Up the Ante tho
---
Only for David and Jake.
---
I pick and choose the rest and waiting for the shards to get to that point.
---
For me leaked sound more like something from jungle. Like papuas music.
---
For real what's the name of your horse? 
---
&gt; my opinion it's not a shitty play but the smart decision
---
I agree 100% but it's still camping. 
---
It's the same as using the UMP 45 and drop shotting on mw2. Its guaranteed to get you the kill. BUT you're still a bitch for doing it!
---
üòÇüòÇ that's so fuckedup
---
Legit tho, I only got the game cause Ghostface was added
---
I guess the stranger things rumour has merit after all.
---
Exactly. Camping is when you stay by the hook with the intention of confirming the kill of the person on the hook in my eyes. When my intention or the killers intention is to find the other survivor in the vicinity then that's not camping but it means we/they are still around the hook area, making saves harder. My point is that if people play smarter and more team minded as survivor then they'll have a better time.
---
It was against a really good doctor too I wanna cry
---
Sacrifice the leader
---
Always buckle up üë©üèø‚Äçü¶±üó£üíÄ
---
But youre saying that the survivors shoudn't be able to loop around windows and pallets and should hide, do gens and escape. You can't both hide and do gens, and the killer will patrol to see what gens are being down, when they found a gen thats being worked on, they're going to look around and most likely find the survivors. And remember, according to you, survivors shouldn't loop so the killer is going to catch up very quickly, ending the chase very quickly, meaning the killer is able to patrol and find other survivors very quickly. 
---
Swf groups succeed so well because they know when the killer is distracted so they can do gens without being worried and there is usually one or two people in the group thats good at looping, buying their team time.
---
ye, its not like you need to justify how you play, but its always good that People learn the difference
---
Maybe its because Jane is THICC
---
I don't play to tunnel or camp or to justify either. But if I hook someone and see scratch marks, then that's just one person that I know is going to be easier to find rather than patrolling gens which can waste so much time, especially on big maps with certain killers. If that person immediately gets pulled then I'll look for who pulled them in most circumstances, trouble is there are many survivors who wont even attempt a save with a killer around, all so some overly-cocky survivor can click his flashlight a few times or someone attmepting a pointless body block. My whole point is it ruins the experience and fun for who ever has ended up on that first hook and all someone had to do was use their brain.
---
At the end of the year PlayStation sends out a email on how much time you spent on games if you sign up for it other than that I wouldn‚Äôt know
---
Thanks man, I‚Äôll give it a go!
---
I think you're right with Wraith and Trapper, but not Doctor or Nurse.
---
Nurse was essentially broken before the Entity found her. She was a compassionate person whose mind broke and she did bad things. I don't think she even understands what she's doing now, but she didn't require much torture because she's so pliable.
---
The Doctor did evil shit before the Entity got him, but yes his appearance suggests he was tortured somewhat. Possibly he killed people out of a desire for control - obviously serving the Entity doesn't do the same thing for him, and he had to be pressured. I think Clown and Doctor are similar except the Clown said 'sure thing boss' whereas Doctor said 'wait hang on this isn't how I usually operate - ow!'
---
I figured we had a lot of blades weapons. So why not the anti-armor weapon of the time? Brutal, just like he is.
---
As nurse she can ai. And ground and blink at spot. I've used this again people who try that tactic and they have called hax for being able to cancel blink
---
you are Not on a Horse, you seem to be stuck in your horses ass.
---
If I know someone is there, I will get them and thats not Camping
---
Okay okay let's clear things up Mr whyiamsomuchsmarterthaneveryoneelse. 
---
So your point 
---
&gt;Looking for a completely different survivor, with ZERO intentions of trying to stop the other from being rescued
---
Your saying why should you go after someone else when they are being dumb and giving you the free down/ free chase / free whatever you foind them. 
---
Yes? Or no?
---
Go slow for me I am not as smart as you.
---
I love it. I‚Äôd play it.
---
Someone gets it. Here's an example of a game I just had with Bubba...the one that prompted this. Thompson's House. Down someone, take them to basement, as I'm leaving basement I hear someone running to my left and see their scratch marks, find them, down them, take them to basement, leave and see MORE scratch marks, find them, down them, basement, meanwhile the first one I took down has gone to struggle and gave up. I couldn't even get out of basement before finding someone else around but I get called a camper. That's not camping.
---
No, I said that the nurse not needing to be looped is something that is new and fresh, because of how she actually is, she can't be looped and literally requires a different style of play that you must adapt to, Spirit is similar. I said that in direct response to people not knowing how to play against her, there's a reason I'm consistently rank 1 playing against these Nurses and Spirits (Solo Queue btw using some of the perks I stated).
---
For pure efficiency, each survivor at the start of the game works on 1 gen each. That's 80 seconds for 3 gens assuming that the other survivor can run the Killer around. If you can't run the killer around for even half that time (which is about the time it takes to do 1 gen when 2 Survivors are on it, fyi), then you, or your team, are really fucking  shit.
---
I'm lucky that a lot of top killers continue to go for me rather than leaving me alone, they have some sort of god complex thinking they should kill all survivors all the time and fully tunnel vision me. I'm not toxic in game in the slightest because that's what I hate the most in DBD, the second is people not knowing how to play against the top 2 killers because that's all that matters. I buy my team time, if you don't, then that is on you, not how good the killer is. Especially at the low ranks lmao.
---
I know when I fuck up in game, I didn't point out I was perfect at it, I just say to myself "I made a mistake" every time I end up giving the killer a free hit or when I mistakenly drop a pallet, it helps me to actually be better at the game and wanting to win and escape because that is the goal of the game. Not to fuck around and take longer to do shit.
---
You are ugly as hell &gt;:(
---
They had more money for better models I assume

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cqo1cq/wth_is_this_exit_gate_glitch_am_i_the_only_one/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Obviously. If your getting stomped then loose with some dignity. No need to resort to being a bitch because you can handle the fact you lost. 
---
Let them escape. Learn what went wrong and move on.
---
Go ahead
---
I am that Spirit, hording 500+ prayer beads, 400+ M/D rings and always using Black Wards
---
I hope it makes things better queue wise. I am not against cross platforms, just trying to acknowledge there will be balance issues complained about. 
---
Also, not sure how they are going to address people like me who already have both set up. Hopefully I can get the BP refunded for one set and it can go towards the other.
---
That was the plan last night, but it got too late to set up. I will try to do it later after work.
---
It is genuinely an amazing show.
---
So what you just told me is "someone is going for an unhook right in front of you? Yeah, let them, if you don't you're a bitch that can't handle being stomped. Just walk away and let them unhook. Think about how you can prevent it next time even though you can literally prevent it right then and there", And to do that every single time it happens throughout the match at risk of my own rank?
---
The only time I see straight camping as a legit strategy is when all gens done and you have someone on hook next to an exit gate and you know survivors are there for the save. If all gens are done and I've got them hooked away from any gates, then I'll head to the gates.
---
I think you misread it, it's to do with healing, not fixeling gens, the third one is gen fixing
---
Meg is bae
---
I won‚Äôt leave if anyone is hooked, unless the killer is face camping with NOED.
---
I‚Äôll take a hit from a non-NOED killer and depend on Dead Hard to make it out all day long.
---
Current players 17000, 25000 peak in the past 24h.
---
Yeah the huntress shows her potential in these situations. She has crazy pressure when survivors are injured or downed. Well played!
---
Seems to be doing it‚Äôs job then.
---
Just because it's the logical thing to do doesn't mean it isn't a bitch move. You're just using logic to justify your actions. Emotions should come into  play when discussing games. Games are formost entertainment and to be enjoyed. Emotions are tied in with enjoyment. If everyone just did the logical thing then I guarantee no game would be any fun for anyone.
---
You can say fuck on the internet, fucker.
---
No, no, YOU'RE EVEN MORE breathtaking!
---
Yare yare....
---
&gt; Considering against top top top level survivors 
---
it's not against top survivors, it's against coordinated swf. And coordinated swf isn't a point of balance since they break a lot of the game mechanics too.
---
someone in the design room wanted to subtly hint at their favorite ship
---
So basically everyone should be stupid and not play logical in the slightest? In a competitive game like dbd? What the actual fuck? Lmao.
---
I bought Myers because he looked like fun from the videos I've seen, he's fun but not always fun.  
---
He kinda lacks variety as his only attack is M1 and his skill involves him slowly following or staring at players.  
---
Against better players he feels slow and you might have trouble actually catching some players. His perks are pretty meh to be honest so you won't really use them on other kills (plus they contradict each other, wtf).  
---
Personal opinion is to buy one of the other killers.
---
I‚Äôve been in this game for a few years and that cycle has alway started out with dick killers that create toxic survivors. In my experience every four killers I get one that‚Äôs not sweaty or a dick. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt play the game like a dick (no instadowns, tunneling, camping, Mori‚Äôs) and while I do sometimes get a toxic message every few days, I‚Äôve received a lot more messages from survivors, even ones I sacrificed, that said they had a great game. It definetly starts with the killer
---
Considering I solo queue like 95% of my games at rank 1, somehow people do what they should be doing, sounds really weird doesn't it? Or maybe you just aren't rank 1 and talking out your ass.
---
Nah man you gotta watch those Survivors unhook right in front of you with dignity. Take the L they're tactically superior to you in every way and if you try to stop them you are being a bitch.
---
No they did 4 gens but In that time I could have done 5
---
Just drag them along the ground in the dying state animation then fucking full vault on top of the hook
---
Niiiice, always feels fantastic!

I do play on Xbox but honestly, it's better to go with PC. Smoother gameplay and easier to control killers and survivors with mouse and keyboard.

Where as I can safely say this is a very well thought out character and well made, the addons alone would be enough to make the killer op. The perks seem to be very strong as well. Now obviously this killer wont be as fast paced as the nurse as the nurse literally teleports but i believe in the grand scheme he would be just as if not better than the nurse. Players becoming broken and exposed for a few abilites, giving hindered for already hitting someone for 30 secs making them get hit again within 5 secs of the first hit, and literal guaranteed bodyblocking that takes 15 secs to disarm then comes back after 30 secs that will end any chase instantly. The broken perk is a make your choice that effects the person hooked so running both would result in insta downs for both the savior and saved. (Imagine just leaving a suit of armor on the person hooked. You can just tp back to it. If you leave three id imagine there would be a total bodyblock that prevents saving) If anything, it shows that the trapper is a very weak killer as this is better in so many ways ei, the trappers traps stay down till he fixes them himself. The teleport itself isnt bad. It is much like freddys tp but he can choose where to place the tps.  But where this is better than freddy is the bodyblock mechanic, its much better than a snare. Especially if they are running the hindered addon. Dream pallets? Dont need to worry about that if there is a literal suit of armor in the way and you have become exposed because of a teleport. Where i like the idea. In execution, this killer would be the most unfun killer to play against as well as an s teir with nurse, spirit, and billy. The only one of the bunch in my opinion needing some type of nerf, the nurse.

---
Yet here you are coming to the complete other extreme of logic=camping....
---
&gt;Same idea
---
Not at all. Without the hatch, it would be objectively impossible for a last remaining survivor to escape. It would create unwinnable situations in which no gameplay is encouraged, at worst leading to that survivor hiding for as long as possible. It would be terrible game design. Hatch is a basic mechanic meant to address this issue. The end game for a killer on the other hand is not objectively unwinnable without NOED. It does not address what would otherwise be terrible game design, and it is not a basic mechanic. (Though I will say that M1 killers are inherently disadvantaged in the end game, and I have thought about making NOED a basic mechanic, without the speed-boost and with giving survivors a totem counter.)
---
&gt;equal reward
---
Also not accurate. The hatch can get 1 player out, NOED can lead to up to 4 kills.
---
&gt;Also noed has counterplay cause you can actually do totems. Keys have zero counter play
---
Why suddenly keys? Keys are items, and while they are complained about and do have counterplay, that is not what you set out to compare. Or should I bring up a bunch of killer add-ons or Moris, which are a lot stronger than keys?
---
You set out to compare the hatch to NOED. The hatch has counterplay: slugging the second-to-last survivor or closing the hatch. A killer can even go out of their way and search for the hatch before it opens, which is about the same level of round-losing time investment as cleansing dull totems.
---
&gt;Kinda reinforces the stereotype that killer things bad survivor things good
---
First you allege you are playing devil's advocate, now you bring up a biased falsity as if it were a common opinion? It's not. Survivors haven't gotten an actually good perk in more than two years. Apart from 1, which was swiftly killed. They have also not gotten new items or add-ons. Well, firecrackers, which are however also old by now, and have also been made mostly useless. The other items and add-ons have only been nerfed. Same for survivor perks: more have been nerfed out of metagame-viability than buffed into it. Killers have gotten decidedly more actually good perks, good perk buffs, good abilities and add-ons and reworks. Killers have more good things than survivors, overall. Nurse and Spirit have pretty busted abilities, there is a considerable variety of pretty busted add-ons, NOED and Bamboozle are pretty busted perks, BBQ's point-gain is pretty busted insofar it enables killers to always have good add-ons, Moris are the single-most busted thing left in the game. What do survivors have that is actually busted? Insta-heals, that's about it. Balanced Landing on Haddonfield, rather niche. Voice comms, which however are not an innate game mechanic.
---
I almost feel the hatch needs to get scrapped. Too many teammates don't do anything just, because they have a key, or the last 2 remain with 1 generator to go. DbD feels more like a game with an objective to outlive everybody else, just to find the hatch. I'm looking at The SC running players who heal within the first 30 seconds of a starting match, and continue to do so several times throughout the game, without doing Jack shit. Crutch players &gt;_&lt;
---
Nurse has now banned med-kits and Self-Care!!! Evil I tell you!
---
I really just meant not having a SWF purple toolbox team that pops 3 gens every 2 minutes while your looped by someone 9 ranks higher than you.
---
After seeing this I gotta buy the ghostface add on
---
Bring in Batman as a survivor
---
it's because the person you're defending stated "Trapper rapes Dwight"

Go to hell, NEVER TELL US HIS NAME SO WRONG AGAIN
---
That‚Äôs happened to me with Legion. I was trying to find final survivor then I see them sprint bursting to the hatch so I run over down them, carry them away and then Mori them. They were in a swf group and inv me to their party and I was screamed at until I left. :D

Fellow artist here that has been drawing for around 12 years... you shouldn‚Äôt hardline. Hardlining is when you just draw what you‚Äôre drawing without initial sketching first (like just doing the outline of her clothes without figuring out where she‚Äôs actually at in there), and it leaves room for a lot of mistakes. The anatomy is a bit weird in this picture, so I suggest sketching out the shape of her body before trying to add the clothes. It looks like you focused more on the torso than her lower body, and so there‚Äôs a bit of a disjunct. Use references for poses to get the anatomy right. and stuff like that.
---
Omg xD I thought Adam was a doctor tbh
---
I was robbed of the Adept Bill trophy on PS4 for this shit. I opened the gate and was home free and the killer dc‚Äôd. I was so pissed. Bet your ass I filed a report.

Bunny Feng plz BHVR

---
Sorry it was really small and blended in.
---
"I think Noed could be reworked to make people less angry". 
---
In the real world- no one cares about feelings or how you feel. That's the harsh truth. 
---
I'm sick of games having to water down difficulty in order to please people. Good games use to make you want to RIP your hair off, they would never give you freebies.
---
People can't strategize properly to not make the same mistake again, and ask for the difficulty to be watered down. That's super annoying for good players who agree that it's fine. If something is balanced, it shouldn't be watered down to please the bad players. If that was the case, their would be no distinguishable difference between a bad/good player.
---
Crutches are often frowned upon.
---
 Noed isn't crutch. It's easily avoidable.
---
 It's understandable if you dislike/hate something= doesn't mean it should be removed to simplify things.
---

Holy shit didn't even think of that lol

It‚Äôs fucking shitty from both sides dude. Just don‚Äôt be a bitch a play the game, win or lose like its a game not the end of your life
---
Idk seems pretty broken for SWF. If a group of 4 all run it, its pretty easy to rush all the gens.
---
I'd straight up run NOED and put an armor right in front of each exit switch as soon as the match started.
---
I saw someone who used a white ward for a yellow toolbox with yellow and brown addons

Plus self care.

Waste a ton of time. To Outlive everyone. Practically useless getting hit after each heal, just to go hide, and repeat.

Oh, even if she had that she got like 9k so 18k and probably de-pipped, when she could have played the game out normally, and gotten 2-3 rescues resulting in more points

Ghost face's mori is still my favorite mori

She must‚Äôve been looking at the ground for several years

yeah, what the fuck is with those corn rows? They look horrendous on her.

And is it in my head, or did they make her model a little beefier when she has that skin on?

You can just look down and aim your blink, besides after the 1st time, it'll be predictable...

Honestly, once you get a sense of the survivor's strategy against her, it's almost clockwork

Well bill has borrowed time which is essential for a savior build and he has unbreakable which is good but he is loud at considering bills a smoker. Claudette has her perks centered around healing yourself(self-care and botany knowledge) and empathy for finding injured teammates and if you should run away. David has dead hard which is a fantastic perk if you suck at chases and We're gonna live forever which helps with the grind. I'd say David or claudette for noobs.(also Meg is good but I find her perks situational like quick and quiet can be ineffective if the killer sees you or triggering  sprint burst on accident. Adrenaline is good though.

I actually had a survivor die to one of my traps the other day, and I had to stop and remember how they could just die in the middle of the trial when I wasn't even near them.
---
How was your second game as Mayars?
---
The grind in this game is absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôve levelled Dwight for Bond, Meg for Adrenaline, Claudette for Self Care, Bill for Borrowed Time, Laurie for DS, and Jake for Iron Will. I haven‚Äôt even started on the Killer side yet. I finally have the perk build I want on my Laurie but it‚Äôs taken me damn near 600 hours in the game to get here.
---
Good nurses will only charge the first blink part way and rely mainly on the second blink. This counters your strategy entirely
---
I can't help myself when I play bing bo- I mean, Wraith.
---
I just had a game where two people dies to my traps lol. Apparently rank 17s don‚Äôt know how to take off traps...
---
A lot of practice against good ones
---
Dude that shit is so annoying especially on fast vaults when you‚Äôre all the way through and still get downed
---
Maan those 2 are the toughest for me. Because it takes timing. They def take skill but theyre worth it if u keep trying.
---
New dead by daylight update! Meg Thomas gains the ability to fuck dweet
---
Does bhvr know about this stuff? I know it's not hurting the game. Just don't know how strict they are.
---
He can't lean! That's breaking the rules!
---
Thanks for the advice, Ill keep practising with them
---
Definitely worth considering 1. Not alot of good huntress and nurse players so seeing that in match especially a nurse because console is rougher and slower? Maybe? But still no one knows how to go against a nurse on console console because barely anyone plays her(on console). 2. Once you get good at them both you have easy matches because most survivors are used to killers that can't deal with looping efficiently (or in spirits case iron will and spine chill) so seeing a killer that denies pallets(or window vaults kinda) make survivors play off their usual playstyle.
---
Meme build gang approves those original perks. Liked.
---
The very few Nurse counters there are all have hard counters themselves in the form of killer perks. If the meta ever were to shift for survivors to run QnQ and Iron Will more, then I'm All Ears and Stridor(one of which is a Nurse perk) will just be used.
---
Nurse is one of the few killers who isn't bound by the meta so she can afford to put perks like this in her build.
---
It still needs refining, but this is just a concept and without it actually going into the game, i think I‚Äôm good on developing it. 
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs giving you inspiration though!! It‚Äôs the reason I did it :)
---
I said that OmegaBlink is an issue with Nurse and the devs are looking at her addons, it pays to read.
---
Feng Min is all around a good survivor to start off with imo. She has Lithe gives you a speed boost when fast vaulting which helps you put some distance in between you and the killer, Technician helps if your not good at skill checks yet and also reduces the sound of fixing a generator &amp; Alert shows you the killers aura when they are breaking a pallet/generator so you know where they are almost all the time. 
---
Nea is pretty good too because of her Urban Evasion which allows you to crouch walk much faster, Balanced Landing helps when jumping off hills/buildings and sometimes even rocks (it‚Äôs happened) because it gives you a speed boost upon landing, Streetwise is... something about reducing charges on items for you and your team when your near them? Idk I don‚Äôt use it.
---
Eh, nothing perfect in its first form, and without a whole development team behind me, it‚Äôs difficult to know what the game needs.
---
But I‚Äôm glad you liked the killer!
---
Honestly, nurse shouldn't have any add-ons, base nurse is tough, but fair, because as long as you manage your distance well, the second blink is always a mind game. Her fatigue should definitely trigger if you attempt a second blink but don't do it tho
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs a good compliment :)
---
Of course, but here's the problem, every othee killer except nurse and spirit are fucked, so what's your solution? Remove more pallets? How do you solve it?
---
What do you mean? Thank you for the compliment?
---
If I got a penny for every cocky no mither self care person who teabagged, got caught and DC'd, I'd have enough to convince Bhvr to punish DCs
---
Yah, but the concept is pretty cool. I would like to see (as a main killer) a killer like that!
---
Oh certainly.
---
And while stealth being meta would be boring and its own issue, stealth being so weak means looping has to be strong which means the Nurse is also strong.
---
Ahhh true, that makes sense. Thank you!
---
Each time someone stops struggling to give someone an instant hatch: "Oh come on you pansy!"
---
I don't get it
---
It means your perks are quite good and would go in my collection of original builds.  
---
Which is good. Like really.
---
Incorrect. Use good headphones and you can use it to find Survivors in their exact positions.
---
Honestly the first killer concept I've seen that could actually work and be pretty damn balanced. Good job OP!
---
Oh! Awesome!! Thanks man, that‚Äôs a compliment I appreciate for sure :)
---
I only do this to useless teammate. They can be useful by minding the killer. Fucking Meg.
---
Such option ded.
---
And of course that beard - the give away of a generous, kind-hearted person.
---
Amazing job, I want Deus vult Freddie.
---
imo, Huntress has one of the best cosmetics so if you also main her, you should 100% buy one for her
---
Lol, bet he must feel like an asshole
---
From my experience as survivor, learning Nurse definitely pays off on console. Ive faced some absolutely beastly nurses. Im not too sure about Huntress though
---
Only spend bloodpoints on her and p3
---
And are you sure that you have that teachable?
---
Cool idea, reminds of The Pursuer boss from Dark Souls 2
---
I saw a ping og 3700 one time
---
I was playing trapper and got someone to the basement then everyone kept coming down and trading hooks and got a 4k
---
Rofl the irony of repeating the same thing other people say when complaining about reposts
---
Going against base nurse is simply just a challenge but it depends how good the nurse and the survivors are. But it it‚Äôs a 5-blink or omega blink nurse, they would have to be more trash than they already are to lose
---
@ R1 Myers can have a hard time without Spirit Fury/Enduring if the survivors are really good at looping, but that‚Äôs every M1 killer. He‚Äôs one of my favorites and paired with Furtive Chase (GF Perk) along with Judith‚Äôs Journal he‚Äôs an absolute killing machine.
---
It happened to me once, after seeing on his video, decided to spread it.
---
Honestly I hope neither, I would like an original killer to spend all my iridescent shards, and I think stranger things wouldnt go well with the spirit of dbd
---
And here, Ladies and Gentlemen, you can see Spaghetti Code in its true and unobstructed form.
---
Balance her add-ons. Which they're doing, 4 and 5 blinks shouldn't even exist. 3 blinks should be a VR add-on at least. Omega blink if it were to still exist, should have drawbacks like slower charge, more fatigue, etc. Instead of just it makes everything better.
---
As for every other killer it seems they are slowly but surely addressing it with map reworks and add-on reworks. Nurse, Doctor, Hillbilly, and Bubba are already confirmed for add-on changes and the devs stated they are going over every map like they did with Badham.
---
Thank you!! I took feedback from the last version, so I am glad people are approving of it :)
---
Quick question, do speed perks increase nurses blink speed. For example, play with your food, NOED, and devour hope with 2 tokens.
---
Good idea! Would love to see some killer coasters
---
That‚Äôs terrifying to think of, but at least he can‚Äôt track you after the scream XD
---
I guess we play different games then because around those ranks, SWF parties of a few rank 1s and one smurfed rank 20 hosting the lobby always play together in the yellow/brown rank territory.
---
Hitboxes when I play survivor feel like...
---
FOR THE EMPEROR
---
I MEAN ENTITY.
---
when you run into a jungle gym but the pallet and the window are blocked by 2 armors.
---
Yo where tf is Herman
---
I've "wasted" Ebony this way on purpose.  Kill 3 and let 1 escape--that's my play style.
---
Yup, can't be hidden, obscured, in a safe location AND active, chasing, running around doing something else.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well...
---
It is only for hits, so with healing, you can trigger it more than a few times and it can combo with a few other perks with it‚Äôs expanded terror radius.
---
Not only is it unironic, it's not even a correct usage of the word.
---
I played with a friend against hag recently, we could see her traps but noone had a flashlight, he was getting hooked and when she put down traps next to him we saw them. Maybe if you see a hag putting down traps you can see them afterwards? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Yes. Even voted you up for Savage
---
Okay, then maybe you could add to it. Maybe it could do an additional effect like Hag's Disfigured Ear add-on that deafens people for a few seconds. Kinda get a hear no evil, see no evil thing going.
---
No Frank from House Party should be the next killer
---
Sure, but that only leaves you three armors to patrol the rest of the map. And once you leave, those pesky kids and kick them in the shins and skedaddle before you can get back.
---
Tapp is the quietest, I believe?
---
Rancor is fun when you're not the obsession.
---
So David can just punt him clear across the map? He still only weighs as much as a doll.
---
im learning so much maybe i can upgrade from baby dwi to normal dwi
---
I never thought about that thanks for the advice
---
I used to use Dark Sense all the time but not so much now, but yeah it gives you a great understanding of where to go next
---
Thabks for the advice I'll try my best to get good with nurse
---
This is epic
---
i got stomped by 4 swf..then received hateful msg by all of them saying kys..
---
I was wondering about that one too
---
I get that, but 6 hits for revealing survivors for 3 seconds (If they are far away it doesn‚Äôt even work) isn‚Äôt really worth it imo. I would either reduce it to 4 tokens or reveal them for like 6 seconds.
---
&gt;You become *obsessed* with one generator
---
"I DUNNO GUYS I JUST **REAALLYYYY** FUCKING LIKE THIS PARTICULAR ONE"
---
I wish they added a Jake outfit in this wave of summer outfits
---
Don‚Äôt they say American black people eat a lot of fried chicken and watermelon? That‚Äôs my understanding. But who doesn‚Äôt like fried chicken &gt;:(
---
HOW DID SHE HOLD THE GAME HOSTAGE, DID SHE BODYBLOCK YOU OR SOMETHING?
---
But my logic is about killers camping. How are you applying it to survivors doing something totally different . 
---
That doesn't make sense. Well to me. You gotta dumb it down rember you clever clogs you. 
---
If you're saying what your doing is the smart move. Like those survivors in your example. Then I agree. The smart thing to do, the logical thing to do is go after the person you know is around the hook. I am not denying that. It is the smart move.
---
Always the SWFs that are visceral
---
Okay but I feel like if through some aligning of the stars we got a JoJo DLC, the killer would be Death-13
---
The devs said you‚Äôre supposed to be able to get hit when you‚Äôre next to the window, *it‚Äôs a fucking window*, the problem arise when lag and animation Dwayne happen and make it look like you ran from the window, but the game thinks your farther back to the window
---
No imagine this right right you ready?  Your doin a gen minding your own business no terror radius its all good your half way there the bam I'M MR MEESEEKS LOOK AT ME now you change underwear
---
badham being a trash map as always
---
NO SURVIVOR PUDDING FOR YOU  &gt;:^(
---
***Out of Szechuan Sauce:*** Your rage only grows stronger when you're denied what you want. Every time a survivor is rescued form the hook, gain a token. After 3 tokens, activate this ability while a survivor is hooked to throw a tantrum on the floor, instantly sacrificing the survivor.
---
*"I'm pickle REEEEE"*
---
In general it's a really good concept for a killer.
---
but the design is a little bit to MMO for my taste, if there were something that catches that gory and creepy vibe for the killer it will fit more the aesthetic of dbd.
---
Aside from that the add-ons are really creative and matches well with the curses knight concept.
---
Yeah I guess so but... why the meat hunks then? Racists are dumb.
---
Ngl I think Im better with huntress on console, so she's definitely learnable.  On the otherhand, Ive heard there is some beastly nurses, but Ive never ran into one, I usually just sigh with relief.
---
HEY MAN JUST LISTEN TO THE BIASED KILLER MAINS, NOED IS BALANCED IN SOLO Q EVEN THOUGH YOU CANT KEEP TRACK OF 5 TOTEMS THAT ALL SPAWN RANDOMLY AND CANT KNOW WHICH TEAMMATE HAS DONE THEM AND THEN ALL THE TIME YOU SPEND LOOKING FOR THEM. PERFECTLY BALANCED
---
MY FIRST RANK RESET WAS TERRIBLE!
---
I WENT FROM GREEN RANKS TO WHITE RANKS AND I HAVE BEEN FACED CAMPED 5 TIMES IN A ROW! IM SO DONE RIGHT NOW!
---
Literally 90% of players who say they are going to report you are morons. Bhvr knows this. Don't worry.
---
It's fun when you have a chance to win.
---
I like the idea but seems way to weak IMO, it's like a Pig without the stealth but a slightly better built in Surveillance
---
It's either gonna be demogragon or w/e Jason or its gonna be I'M MR MEESEEKS LOOK AT ME
---
Yup I said this in one of my earlier posts that they didn't read, adding on though, it's the none default maps like Coldwind, MacMillan etc, although they should be addressed first because you know, infinites are the worst thing about the game :)
---
I would "Adviser" right into the killer lap, loved that perk
---
99% isn‚Äôt always the smartest option, if I see a gate is 99% I will open it as the killer, because I can tell you are planning something, and to deprive you of the points of opening the door.
---
I was in that match sorry bout that
---
As if the idea of dream snares isn't a new concept
---
I like the idea, accept idk who tf Leslie Vernon is
---
it shows both
---
What about killer queen though it makes sense with the character. Ability would be to instantly kill any survivor you've hit last.
---
Adrenaline and NOED
---
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK FOR THE KILLER‚ÄôS CONNECTION IN THE LOBBY IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT. I DODGE GAMES OVER 150 PING OR IF THE KILLER SPIKES UP TO RED PING
---
IF HE HAS A CONSTANT GREEN PING BUT IN THE GAME YOU NOTICE WEIRD LAGGING AND RUBBERBANDING, CHANCES ARE HE‚ÄôS LAGSWITCHING. CHECK FOR IT IN KEY MOMENTS LIKE WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE DOING A GEN AND HE SEES YOU AND IS COMING, WHEN YOU DROP A PALLET OR VAULT A WINDOW, ETC
---
Wheres Adam?
---
"Brainless Cunt" - DbD Rank #1 Player
---
\- Nice day you too wonderful person who can't take arguments from various people. &lt;3
---
Freddy is super strong now, and Leatherface is very underrated at mid to lower levels.
---
I love that you did the exact same chicken t-bag at her before running away haha
---
Because it's survivor objectives, the same way that chasing people is the killers objective. So I'm comparing the smartest gens/unhooks to the smartest chases. Ok, I know you recognise it's the smartest move but you also call it a bitch move, which it is not. Just like a survivor doing the smartest gen isn't a bitch move just because they are making the killer work harder to get to them. That's the comparison I am making. The definition of camping is hiding out, waiting, doing nothing else whilst you wait out someone to walk by so you can shoot them in an FPS or in this case wait for someone to die on the hook. You can't be waiting and camping out whilst actively doing another objective.
---
I'm the guy that brings a green Mori, and just uses it on the first person to get toxic with me. Pointing and bagging at pallets? Unhooking in my face? Clicking a flashlight over and over to try and aggro me? Fine. You wanted the attention, you can have it.
---
Lol that is the best joke from the devs ever
---
Yep, same goes for legion (of course)
---
I‚Äôm still on Part 3, so I‚Äôm not an expert
---
Prayer Beads is the Key add-on, Prayer Beads Bracelet is the Spirit add-on.
---
Take a break then.  When I started playing the 2nd thing I did was level Pig to 50.  ~~1st was get leather to 35~~  After that I played pig a bunch bc shes my favorite, and gave those BP to other better BP grinders.  Its okay to play who you want.  You can prestige them later if they dont have all the good perks you want.  If you get burnt out and quit all the grinding was for naught.
---
I had this too, except I could also see totems, hooks, trappers traps and generators
---
If you can Dodge a wrench, you can Dodge a Nurse
---
Any spaces**
---
This may sound dumb, but do you need a perk for that chance or does everyone have a 4% chance? I‚Äôve never been able to get off the hook myself.
---
Why? It won't give you repair speed
---
From the movie Behind the Mask The Rise of Leslie Vernon. I would recommend giving it watch. Really cool concept for a slasher movie and was actually pretty good.
---
Got to rank 8 as killer lost interest
---
That healing one doesnt look gud

Wdym by "Doing a trophy"?

I was so salty lol. This is the second time someone has done this to me and both times I was able to successfully escape.
---
Thanks Ill try learn both, I have all the perks for huntress I just need pop goes the weasel for nurse.
---
I hate huntress nurse tho I laugh when when I realize it's her
---
It‚Äôs an American thing.
---
About the gates at 99% ‚Äì I do get the idea behind it, but nothing is as frustrating as having a tight chase to the gate just to realize that you simply do not have a second to spear finishing it so you just go down like a blobfish right in front of your way out lol.
---
You do understand how Bubba's chainsaw works right? when he bumps into an object, he goes into his trantrum where he can still down you with his chainsaw
---
Don't let your drinks escape.
---
I've won pretty much every argument, no matter what they've said I am right and your poor little brains can't take facts because you're all garbage. Not to mention one of the ones who argued with me is only a Rank 6-8 and uses Spine Chill, Lightweight and Self Care ahhahahaha
---
*NANI!*
---
Did she get hooked? And did you help her?
---
They hated jesus because he spoke the truth, the survivors hate me because i spoke the truth.
---
*Laughs in Howling Grounds PTSD*
---
Same here. All I know is memes and E N E M Y S T A N D
---
I dont like this person.
---
I usually just want to avoid being Blood Wardened. ;\_;
---
There's no bigger horror than to run into the exit while someone is hooked only to find out: Blood Wardened!!
---
I think Haddonfield is next on the list. Which I'm ok with, since I would agree that Strode Key + Balanced Landing is the most broken combo in this game.
---
As for the maps you mentioned, I hope they get through those quickly as I don't think they need full reworks, just fix the 1 infinite in the middle of these.
---
encouraging people to gen rush? Imma say no.
---
Dude as a former nurse main I literally switched to Ghostface because playing Nurse is like showing up to a cap gun fight armed with a SAW and a grenade belt if you know how to use her. Not only is it not fun to play after a while, it's just not fair to any of the other players.
---
I highly urge you to see the movie Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon.  Great deconstruction of slashers.
---
That's interesting, I thought the killer's lack of any chase assistance (which Billy, Spirit, and Nurse all have) would make him a solid B/B+ tier killer, perfectly well balanced.
---
Amazing use of the original quote there
---
What a cunt
---
Yeah, it has happened to me.   You loop the killer and hoping someone will get the idea and just open the door but they don't.  Then you get hit and camped.
---
It‚Äôs mostly just the i game lore but some things are weird bits of info you only hear on devstreams.
---
4% is the base chance, though there are perks to increase it. I forget the actual percentages though. If you ever hear someone say, "Respect the 4%," that's what it's in reference to.
---
Oh noo..If only you had dead hard
---
He is the same as Michael but gets 1000% faster stall on baby Megs.
---
When I was in a locker he hit me. Then i came out. I didn't come out of the locker myself. Game did that after he "downed me"
---
You don't see the 70+ other comments in this thread? I've answered everyone who commented. This is a change my mind discussion, i don't care if you want me to start the discussion because i don't have to. You have to start it or go away lol
---
Ahhhhh that makes sense. Thank you
---
4th of September is whar I've heard
---
Ok. Thanks for the heads up.
---
the actual percentages only go up to 7. kinda broken if u ask me lol
---
Exactly haha! I guess it could work on higher ranks where your teammates understand your stressed out body language and can time opening the gate correctly but... so far not so good üòÇ
---
I like it. And that's coming from a Legion Main. I love seeing shit like this.
---
me trying to win a match as a trapper after seeing all of otzdarva's trapper videos
---
Glad I could please a legion main üëçüòú
---
Ye all sound logic my dude. Ticks all the boxes. 
---
But I still think it's a bitch move. It's my opinion. I agree with your logic. But when YOU have the option to leave someone alone and not punish them and you dont take it. That's a bitch move in MY OPINION. 
---
By all means do it, as you said it works, it's the smartest move and will get you the kills. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. 
---
If you wanna act like everyone else fine. But dont get defensive when someone expects better of you.
---
I agree with this post. It doesn't matter the outcome of the game. They HAVE to send you a message. I'll kill them all and I won't say a word, but let a few of them escape, and you get an instamessage. Combine that with them wanting you to see them at the exit and teabag. I don't even go to the exit lol.
---
[deleted]
---
I knew this would be asked. For some background, I was going for the person who DC‚Äôd since they were hooked first while this Claudette was being chased. A Dwight + me were healing the unhooked person when Claudette was downed/hooked. After we healed her Dwight ran for Claudette, I found ruin and figured both of us didn‚Äôt need to go. He unhooked her, healed her and the person who was first hooked was being chased again, got downed and DC‚Äôd. I finished the generator and started on a new one when I got caught and hooked and everything else is in this video. Shortly after I got off I was healing myself when Mrs Piggy found me w/ nurses calling, I went down again (Claudette sandbagged my downed body) and then she slugged Claudette while hooking me, found Dwight hooked him and let Claudette escape through hatch. 10/10 best game ever.
---
Kate‚Äôs climbing skin.
---
not really, the game was going as smooth as it can be on this game and suddenly that happened. Lag or connection issues have given me the best rageful moments ever in dbd
---
Oh karma will get to them shortly. The most annoying survivors are ones that get Nut(or cunt ) punch straight by karma or killer that has a Mori and ain't dealing with it today
---
I consider him to be the best of the stealth killers
---
How is this suspicious xD some people just don‚Äôt care about achievements n some do
---
The bloodpoint grind is completely insane and requires multiple thousands of hours to max out all killers let alone survivors. Devs claim with out the grind most players would quit but I've had several friends quit because of the perk grind (and its caused me to take several breaks).  So yes, definitely overwhelming.
---
What really leaves a sour taste in my mouth is seeing streamers with low hours with everything unlocked or thousands of pink addons and you know they cheated to do it.  Shame there is no reward for doing it legitimately.
---
See this is the thing. Don't expect better of the killers, expect better of the dumb survivor that caused it in the first place.
---
Reminds me of a game a couple hours ago. I wasn't doing so well, so I just started setting traps and the survivor would get trapped and rescued over and over again. If I'm not going to be able to get any kills, might as well farm as much BP as I can.
---
Lol same that hag was camping hatch so I did 2 gens (99% them both n popped then after) 
---
Back when old hatch stand off smh
---
Judging by the clip without inputs, it looks like you opened the locker then got hit, you can't get injured when inside the locker, only when entering it. You clearly didn't get hit when going into it, so it must have happeded when you hopped out.
---
You forgot to put /s buddy
---
Okay I‚Äôll repost the next month. Using a different caption, but same template though
---
If you ever wanna sell them...hmu. They look amazing!
---
So what happened? How long did it take for them to popped it?
---
That is just encouraging games to end in 5 minutes, That just sounds like a negative reinforcement to people's playstyles
---
Jesus was black, Ronald Reagan was the devil and the government is lying about 9/11
---
And what was the point in making this post if it was obvious? shit bait dude.
---
2 seconds after the screenshot. I spawned on my ruin
---
Except were not talking about "killers" were talking about you. 
---
And if youre aware that you're purposely punishing dumb survivors then ye. I do expect better of you. Because you know better. They clearly dont.
---
Its the second one
---
And when I play killer some survivors are juking me like Neo, only lagging when I'm getting closer or when I'm going for the sure hit. Of course it doesn't always happen, but when it happens it's annoying.
---
The fact 4 survivors all bringing 4 meta items and 4 meta perks = 1 killer perk should give you an idea of how fucking Noed and this post are.
---
Yeah, in a lot of games there's someone on a hook when it becomes possible to open the exits. 
---
My strategy is usually just to open it then try to save the hooked person, which typically results in a "running for our lives" situation with the killer right behind us.  I feel like it would be a death sentence to try and pull it off without the gate open.
---
No dude im a killer main and i run this singular fucking perk and a 4 man swf with this shit call me trash, and treat me like scum for running noed
---
*laughs in nurse and billy*
---
lore-wise, the killers are trapped just like the survivors. might as well have some fun
---
and congrats you are making super useful discussion thread huh.
---
It showed I was hit in the locker. Clearly. Then it forced me out. I'm not complaining. I just think it's funny.
---
I wanna unsee this
---
You guys take this game too seriously
---
A killer with noed
---
I dont understand why you're getting downvoted, this makes perfect sense
---
I can see where you are coming from and where this killer lacks in chase potential and plays like any m1 killer, it makes up for with the body blocks on pallets and vaults; exposed, hindered, and broken status effects; and the unpunished-camping potential. Effectively this killer doesn't really have to chase much, one hit you are screwed. I know you can try to loop or whatnot, but with the killers ability to bodyblock with the other armors looping is out the window. (The only maps i can see where the killer suffers is the corn maps due to the sheer size of the field, but the killer can still block the few loops the map has) the last reason is once you hook someone you can tp to a new armor and leave the old one in front of the surv. Its a 3 sec tp and you have the ability to synergize to insta down the savior and the saved as I said. So sure, lacks in the chase, but the killer doesnt have to really chase. The tp also applies map pressure as well as you can tp to any armor anywhere on the map at will like freddy to gens. Cross map travel faster than billy with a one hit exposed status with an addon. Thats my reasoning to being an S teir.
---
I know man. The obvious whataboutism made it pretty clear you're a killer main.

They did the same kind of floaty thing for the nurse, shouldn't be too hard to implement imo

Honestly if your playing against a slow killer and the exit gates are decently far apart, you can just get one open in time for them to patrol back.
---
People talking about basement and bubba disappoint me... you don't see the true beauty of this build. 
---
You grab a survivor and go around nonstop attacking while trying to hit another survivor. Its funny as hell.
---
they probably like it, masochist bastards
---
I just cannot juke like that to save my life. Impressive, and well done.
---
you seems really too butthurt to be a constant high rank survivor.
---
No love for Otz? No? Pepehands...
---
Killer is dumb for picking up the guy right in front of rhe Ash with the flashlight eventhough he can see the flashlight lol
---
*1, 2, 3, 4, 5, BOOM gotcha*
---
I play solo survivor every time I play survivor, Mr gatekeeper.
---
can I ask why that claudette did that?
---
Its all about timing, and the Huntress is really slow so its easier to move out of the way and gain more distance. Also thanks!
---
yupo
---
Some people are just too salty about noed in a bad way man. I got called trash after killing all survivors before the last gen was popped and they called me trash for having noed on my perk loadout
---
Gotta throw on Thrilling Tremors for the full set
---
actually hate this, what do they expect me to do, run to the opposite side of the map, just so they can save? yeah no thanks man
---
Nice. Can you tell me the name of the song, please?
---
Yet you were the one that said I was playing like every one else...so make up your mind. And I ain't making excuses for anything because I'm looking at this from the survivor standpoint too. And as you've said it's logical. So I don't need an excuse for something that's logical. Something that actually makes sense.
---
"Why dont you give the dumb inexperienced suviror a chance?" 
---
Because I'm not talking inexperienced players. You want to be one of those whiny entitled survivors that just calls everything bullshit and can't say "Well, unlucky, nothing much else the killer could have done" then be my guest. Maybe you should expect better of yourself? Hmm.....

Why would the Entity call them self?

According to some on here that's exactly what you've to do or your making "bitch moves" lmfao

Shouldn't have joined knowing they were probably going to be really salty

Might be on later today. I‚Äôm just gonna send you a message once I‚Äôm not busy
---
He would have gotten the fastest T-Bag in the West for Chainsawing me on the hook like that. Lol.
---
You're entitled to your opinion. Even if it is just an excuse. But hey, easier to call something a bitch move than it is to just accept something, right? You can leave now. Bye x
---
Sounds good thanks man!
---
True I was rubber handing but at this point of the game this started to happen so i was really salty at that point and thought it was the hitboxes but since I keep rewatching the clip it‚Äôs basically lags fault
---
What messenger do you use that you can send people emojis and stuff? Is this something on PC or something?
---
lol no problem, just dont let it happen again :)
---
Sounds like an interesting idea.
---
BBQ, Shadowborn, Ruin, Haunted Grounds.
---
Beatiuful! Keep up the good work! I think as a next killer you should try to draw Freddy
---
That would be kinda dummy op tho. Vampires are super fast, they can fly, and they are really dark and hard to see. So how would this Vamp work?
---
Well, if you don't wanna join, quit annoying ppl here, go do what you want to do, just don't comment if you're not interested, Or else you'll be reported.
---
Isn't that more a mace than a Morningstar tho? Most Morningstar designs I've see have the ball at the end of a chain
---
Go view all of his work on [his website](https://randowis.com/)
---
Maybe's he getting downvoted by people who want a character and then the bloodweb traps them into getting their teachables and they just express that with a downvote? 
---
I honestly have no idea why anyone would downvote the statement but that's the only counter I could see being made if it's even possible to have two teachables show up in the web before you unlock the other perks.
---
Ever crossed you mind you can't counter her cause you are bad?

Even without the rubber banding if you get chainsawed out in the open from 2 meters behind you, it still won't be because of hitboxes...

"Tryhard" Wraith setup: Brutal Strength, NOED, Ruin, Bamboozle
---
Cookie-cutter Wraith setup: Barbecue, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury
---
You should bring Ruin instead of Iron Grasp. Bloodhound is also not worth using, and something like Nurse's Calling would serve you better indeed. NC is not half-bad on Wraith, given that he has no terror radius in cloak and can therefore sneak up on healing survivors. If you for some reason however like using Bloodhound, you could pair it with Sloppy Butcher instead (unless you are using "Blind Warrior" - White of course, but then Wraith has a bunch of add-ons that change what perks you would optimally wanna be using anyway, so that's a general caveat).
---
Enduring (and Spirit Fury) is particularly nice on Wraith because you want to go for "Windstorm"-lunges through pallets a lot, and because it also halves the stun duration when stunned while cloaked.
---
I ain't even do nothin
---
Yes I totally agree with you at  this point
---
lmao, try to learn playing her. I bet you would catch max 1 survivor on a normal rank
---
Every Wraith runs NOED so you got to keep the tradition going.
---
Everyone is talking about the concept and perks and stuff but can we appreciate the fact that this must have took forever to think of and make.
---
I would have made him 110 speed because he is a 200 pound thing of metal
---
That's innapropriate... Shit. 
---
The only parody of this song that actually matters
---
Yeah. Nurse gets a pass because she has a very high skill cap, so the majority's opinion is that the good nurses kinda "deserve" to dominate the game by having trained for longer than most to reach that state, which is fine.
---
But that shouldn't make us forget that she's completely unbalanced, a model of inventive and bold game design gone very wrong.
---
Appreciate the effort, but this would never work. Anything that increases lunge distance or movement speed should not be in the game, too hard to balance.
---
Poor Julie. Good plays by the team but Julie deserves better &lt;3
---
You might be thinking of a flail.

Doctor, doctor, gimme the news...

You're such a fucking hoe.

Am i in the wrong for tunneling a survivor when they start tbagging me after their first pallet loop?
---
Solo takes less time, although with friends takes considerably longer for me.  I live in Ireland so that could take me longer, but I'll usually spend at least 10 minutes waiting.
---
This is the xbox messenger ^^
---
It WAS a Claudette she‚Äôs with the entity now.
---
Glad to see you used some of the add-on ideas I suggested :) 
---
It looks very well done!
---
What I hate about it Iri king is when I play doctor with it I get super unlucky with the effects of the low tier madness but when I‚Äôm against it I‚Äôm fucked after one shock
---
Do you sell these?
---
Advertising your stream is strictly against the rules, if you are good and intertaining you dont need advertisement anyways
---
Rank reset?
---
Some of you may die, but that‚Äôs a sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make
---
Just modify DBD's version for balanced gameplay. Seriously ez if they go the OC route and not a licensed character. Vampires are cool cuz every culture and media in the world has done them differently in some way so as long as you stick to more well known staples (drinking blood, fangs, immortality, etc), you can play with the rest, they're not real after all. I've definitely seen media where vampires aren't any of the things you described, so DBD could prob pull it off :D
---
I'm pretty sure I have all that on feng
---
I love this. This would be my new main lol
---
.... Clown is not A tier. What?
---
Can‚Äôt even flashlight her
---
Sloppy and Nurse's is good on bing bong. You just smack someone then let them go, only to sneak up on them trying to heal up
---
Thanks man. I‚Äôll try giving Freddy a go then
---
so lucky omfg
---
Perhaps, to go with the flavour of the perk, you get the blind status due to being so wrapped up in the generator.
---
Try uploading entertaining clips and put TTV in your name. Why should people watch you instead of the other hundreds of people streaming?
---
Oh...Well sadly I couldn't get the Stacks in order to Mori ;-;.
---
 Hitboxes when I play survivor feel like...  ( Hitboxes when I play survivor feel like... )
---
Hitboxes when I play Freddy feel like
---
Yeah, it never explained, how you you have to do it. Had to read it on wiki after my first attempt :3 BTW still didn't kill as single person, I'm that bad at charging that big ass gauge.
---
You should check it out, it's an amazing show
---
Omg that's hilarious I've been there many of times
---
Let me guess, you can't argue so you think stupid jokes will make you right?
---
but punctuation is not a language and you never use punctuation and it really confuses me but you could at least spellcheck but it‚Äôs alright everyone has to learn
---
i was able to get to tier 3   4 times.   i wonder how confused all 4 survivors were when they saw that i had tombstone, got to tier 3 4 times  and still didnt kill anyone
---
IM THE ONE ANNOYING HERE?!?!
---
Thats a lot of bs I‚Äôll pass ty 
---
Lol I have 1.3k hrs n have only 60% achievements xD haven‚Äôt adapted killers either
---
He says behind tears, obscuring his vision while he smashes down onto his keyboard. How could anybody dare oppose ThePhilBar, who can‚Äôt even fight a spirit.
---
I think a lot of them are kids, I wouldn‚Äôt take it too seriously.
---
Both on the same Rank though?
---
If survivor can mindgame like you do - you screwed if u new to her. And bracelet do absolutely nothing too if you new.
---
Yes, playing against master spirit is an pain in ass, but it take time to learn her.
---
That‚Äôs so sad
---
What‚Äôs the heart to the right and the dunce hat for?
---
No doubt about the top three. I just haven‚Äôt played a billy that I thought was better than the spirit. Of course, this is probably much different in the higher ranks!
---
Thia would happen to me when I play killer a good swf would mess me up.
---
Dude, if you wanna watch, go ahead, if you don't want to, then go away, it's as easy as that.
---
the perks are called Underperform and it has no effect
---
I‚Äôm bad at killer, this would 100% happen to me.
---
*IRON WILL*
---
How do you counter her?
---
That's really cool, if you have extras I'd trade you for even just 1 of each but I definitely don't blame you if you'd rather keep them I wouldn't want to get rid of them lol
---
don‚Äôt spam the sub with your garbage tho
---
I just picture the entity lowering the hook itself when Chucky approaches the hook
---
^iron ^will ^doesn't ^work ^against ^stridor
---
Most players are fine, but ya I agree this community has some really carcinogenic players in it for whatever reason. I find it worse than LoL was back at its toxic peak some times.
---
LMAO THIS IS SO TRUE XD
---
Perfect
---
Me need sacrifice now
---
Is Billy really S now? I thought Nurse was the only S rank since she completely breaks all the rules of the game and is unloopable on top of that.
---
Let me guess, you can't argue so you think stupid memes will make you right?
---
Idk man, I am a high ranked killer, I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with staying in that rank...
---
Losing line of sight, especially at a corner
---
it's perks not used by the game
---
I like this build. I would like to have a teammate like you instead of self caring morons. But I also want to say that Spine Chill is a crutch as well. I use to use it in yellow and green ranks but now at purple and red there are simply better options. Of course you can still use it, not everyone wants to run meta perks but just be sure you can function without it and not get shifty being in the killer‚Äôs terror radius and not knowing if he‚Äôs coming to you or not.
---
While I agree with this, the other side of the coin is that low rank players arent reliable for healing. Ive chased players around the map trying to get them to heal me before after coming back from a hiatus and my rank got sunk. Low rank players also spend more time lurking around the map so its harder to find them because you cant always just run to a gen. Ive had to run self-care simply because if I didnt I would never get healed.
---
Nurse and spirit both are a struggle to loop and juke around, and a good nurse/spirit will be able to down you quite quick regardless of the survivors own skill because of how they work. If their time can't be wasted in the same way billy's on huntress (2 high tier killers) can, survivors are going to struggle to do gens, especially solo survivors. Looping around pallets and windows is one of the few things survivors can do to escape or waste the killers time, it's one of the few defenses survivors have because of how unreliable stealth is and perks have cooldowns. They both can negate that, they're the two strongest killers because survivors are strongest at looping. You remove the strongest aspect of the game for survivors, there is not much they can do other than attempt to be unpredictable. 
---
Maybe you find not being able to loop refreshing and new, but I and alot of other people find it frustrating, because I'm often not sure what I could have done to extend my life, and there usually isn't a chance to improve or learn because of how quick it happens.
---
The one with a heart is super strong
---
The killer is just making sure he can kill you kinder his whole point in existing
---
Last time a toxic swf spammed me with invites, I joined using my phone and then used my other phone to blast fortnite earrape directly into the mic. Probably got reported but the screaming was worth it :D
---
With Huntress it's the combination of lag and animation desync and a hatchet hitbox. But you can't make hatchet hitbox small because it would be too hard to hit with it otherwise.
---
Bro your already starting off on a bad start with that attitude and mentality of him being against you when he just gave you advice.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main, i was wondering why people woudnt play the survivors with most advantages. Nice looking through my profile because of an argument???
---
If I could get power that strong I would let the Entity choke me over and over üòâ
---
Then there is a problem with the ranking system there are perks made to slow down the game ruin,lullaby,corrupt intervention,ghostface perk,overcharge,etc but honestly to fix the game more objectives that help get us out faster totems don‚Äôt count  and looping is fine the way it is any more nerfs it will be almost impossible to defend oneself
---
You just confirmed what i said before. And I'm not getting angry at a stupid baby, sorry. Anyway i won against a lot of spirit, cause i use iron will. I was just observing that she is not skill based, and not from a survivor main point of view, but from a killer main point of view. And rank 1 killer and sirv btw.
---
Yeah 
---
Idk about the first two meat emojis though, that's a new one
---
&gt; because the premades exist, you need something that can stand a chance
---
no. point.
---
You don't fight bullshit with bullshit. that's your ultimate conclusion on balance for games ? "something is too strong so we need something stronger !! "
---
try again without this kind of subjective point of view.
---
Terrible.
---
Insta heal is a one time thing that gives a survivor more time it doesn‚Äôt thanos snap the killer insta down killers can just down them again but a mori have no counter play literally none
---
For anyone who‚Äôs interested in marketing, this post is a great example of how not to do it.
---
The only thing toxic about this video is the angle it was shot at.
---
when you‚Äôre a bad killer

Didn't get to jump into a game yet but the controls are fine,graphics are smooth it's good so far
---

Not dumb at all! So, someone named Geistra made custom DBD icons. Not sure if I can directly link it atm, but look up 'Geistra sky pack DBD' and you should find it. It's a tad tricky, though, so follow the instructions exactly. You have to replace the image files in the game files. It comes with instructions, though.
---
Doing gens, u?
---
Because you aren‚Äôt getting work done. It‚Äôs a risk and reward type thing. Good survivors understand that sometimes you have to take a risk of not being healed and being one hit to finish a gen/ get some good progress. 
---
Because think about it like this: one person is always in chase with the killer. Good killers will hit someone and rotate for another person. While you self care for 32 seconds (almost half a gen), the guy in chase is giving valuable time to do gens. He‚Äôs also using pallets at the same time to extend the chase. The killer now has you self caring and the other guy creating deadzones (meaning there‚Äôs nothing to work with. You get hit and run over to a tile with no pallet and then go down). So he goes down and here you are fully healed, but soon to go down quick in a dead zone. Sometimes you need to take risks

How can you play this ?
---
killer that gets stronger for every down? when downed can suck blood from survivors. Maybe helps you tier up like michael? maybe m2 is just sucking blood
---
Oh yeah they are definitely worth learning. The irony on console is that they are not played on console as much so a lot of survivors don't have experience against them, so moderate skill on them can be really successful.
---
Run bond or empathy. Most importantly don't be afraid of objectives, just because you're injured. Iron will helps. Resilience is cool too, Although theirs  better options
---
I downloaded it off Google play
---
Its usually more obvious when people are swf on xbox since they often have matching usernames. Or you can just see if they're in a party
---
I'M SO FUCKING TIRED OF BEING FARMED OFF THE FUCKING HOOK RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KILLER.  
---
FUCK YOU PEOPLE.  I JUST HAD A MATCH WHERE I WAS STRAIGHT FUCKING MURDERED BY MY TEAMMATE.  I WENT FROM NOT BEING HOOKED AT ALL TO BEING PICKED UP FOR MY FINAL HOOK IN THE SPAN OF 30 GODDAMN SECONDS.  
---
YEAH I FUCKING DC'D AND IT WASN'T EVEN THE KILLER'S FAULT.  GODDAMN IT.  GETTING FUCKING FARMED ON THE HOOK IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING FUCKING THING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS GAME.
---
I want a peacefull life with Ruin up whole game.
---
Ghost face don‚Äôt really bother me besides when he first came out and was broken I ran spine chill before spirit even came out but that does mean even with monitor a tier one Micheal would scare the hell out of me
---
This
---
I asked this question a few days ago, and no 1 changed my mind about it. In fact they encouraged it. Even I understood that it was a crutch perk. Besides pain reliever, you're the only one who has told me this. Thanks... I did needed to hear this.
---
Anyways, I still have my training wheels on. Currently for my build I need it still. Although in the future, I'll swap it out when I feel more confident or have the teachables I need to make a super build to my playstyle. Mainly need more practice/confidence. 
---
Recently from haitus (a year) saw that SC was getting bashed on. Saw my mistakes reading the hate comments, and immediately took it off. If it wasn't for this community, I'd still be crutching. I was very unproductive when I did use it, and I'm glad i have more room now. It also feels liberating to do necessary actions while being injured. 
---
I run empathy, and see everyone wasting time in the corners. I always wondered why the last 2 gens always took the most time, now I know why. Seeing a lot of the good players not running it is motivating. I like some meta perks, but do hate relying on a crutch. At least with SC out of the way, I'll be more productive. Thanks for the input.
---
Why would I let you win when the whole point is to win for yourself... it‚Äôs a game.
---
Yes please imaging that on a corn map
---
game wise he likes it...? he gives you more BP for it at least. maybe he‚Äôs just misunderstood and wanted everyone to have a nice time :(
---
Right? Especially when your team collectively did 1 gen..
---
Oh? I‚Äôm guessing my art account
---
get all characters first. saw you say you don‚Äôt have kate. maybe not all survivors since some have 0 good perks
---
I dunno, maybe that you feel the need to gloat and try to annoy the person you just went against? If it was a killer player smacking you on the hook and calling you names, you wouldn‚Äôt find it a bit tacky?
---
Can you give an update after you played a couple of matches? Really curious what you think
---
I can agree on the pressure! The fact he can zoom from one side to the other and possibly get an insta down is crazy. The few I‚Äôve played lately just down utilize that much. Most breaking pallets with the chainsaw.
---
AAAAAAUUUUUUGGGHHHHH!!!
---
*Madness Tier 3*
---
You can have fun without teabagging/vaulting to taunt the killer, and without trash talking them on stream. Don‚Äôt have to be toxic to have fun.
---
Ok teabagging sure, using an instaheal and using flash light blinds is not bm. It‚Äôs part of the game. Trash taking on stream isn‚Äôt necessarily BM as the killer can‚Äôt hear that. He thought the killer was coming for him, that‚Äôs why he pallet slammed and jumped over. I don‚Äôt think the vaulting was BM.
---
The hag only trapping that gen. Oh neptune.
---
Can you explain what you mean by using shards as a BP boost?
---
How about Billy, do you know if they help his chain.
---
uh who hates Freddy or Myers, really..
---
You are a very nice person. You made redditors laugh with your stupidity. You're fantastic
---
Myers&gt;GF. He can vault faster than lithe (/s) and has lunge as long and fast as hillbillys chainsaw. Addons are god tier. If you‚Äôre point is that GF is sneakier, then use Monitor and/or furtive chase. Daddy is god
---
I enjoy playing against nurse because of the mind games as well. But I am at a low rank. I just can't comprehend how a really good nurse than knows exactly how far they blink and that sort of thing would have trouble. Even if you lose LOS they still have 1 more blink once they go around the wall right?
---
Well, tbf, they also said that they‚Äôd never make a clown killer and then....
---
how did you get a 4 man with ghostface
---
with monitor too
---
Pretty sure they wouldn't let that pass as the cosmetics aren't supposed to effect gameplay at all so having a cosmetic making him near invisible is unlikely. They'll probably use the mask for something though
---
I ONCE HAD A MYERS SEND ME A MESSAGE THAT SAID "FARM."  SAME FUCKING THING HAPPENED TO ME.  
---
DO YOU REALLY FUCKING SUCK AS NOT ONLY A KILLER, BUT ALSO AS A HUMAN BEING, SO MUCH THAT YOU HAVE TO FUCKING LIE TO PEOPLE TO GET KILLS?
---
Oh my god bro, that‚Äôs so mean. I wonder what post game chat would be like If I try that.
---
How is that op isn‚Äôt that what a basic map or deja vu does?
---
Or just level up Huntress...lol
---
Battle Bubba Build
---
Well I mean add ons determine if powers like Billy‚Äôs chainsaw are faster or anything.  But I guess the 4% more movement speed or whatever from NOED helps when he‚Äôs chainsawing around
---

Great idea, you should make some cosmetics designs (recolor and different armors) As a killer main, I would be down to purchase this boi.
---
They‚Äôve made one nurse and spirit was close to being another
---
The new dark hell ram skin for huntress is really kl also I swear it made her harder to see from a distance

No guessing you play mostly pc right? Cause camping is fairly normal on ps4.
---

---
Games not meant to be fair. THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL YOU!
---
No problem. It‚Äôs a great perk for people who at starting out. I was the same as you, watched PainReliever‚Äôs vid about it and just had to use it. Then I played a game without and felt naked as hell and played worse. Then I adjusted to playing without it. 
---
Usually it gives you a lot of security as only Tier 1 Myers can sneak up on you when you have it. But when you‚Äôre without, you have no idea if the killer is coming to you or not if you‚Äôre in his terror radius. So you hop off a gen and waste time only to learn he was walking past or chasing a teammate. So for that reason I don‚Äôt use it anymore. It‚Äôs like constantly using addons on Billy, because when you can‚Äôt use them you‚Äôre rusty
---
I feel you might have had an easy time. I can certainly say others have the need to learn. I faced off against a spirit last night who had Haunted Grounds, NoEd, Rancor, BQQ. Relatively good perks and it was easy to juke her and get away. As far as I know we were all randoms too.
---
I'm hostile against who is here to joke, and not to debate. Anyways, what you say is true, but a mid-experienced spirit will most likely win even at red ranks; while a mid-experienced huntress, nurse, Billy or whatsoever will most likely lose at these ranks(except omega nurse or 3 blink nurse). And I'm talking by personal experience. I try playing spirit and i figured out that is extremely easy to use her, compared to nurse or huntress or other killers, and she is m even stronger than Billy. Probably you outrun Spirits cause you are a very experienced surv, or cause you face noobs one, but, as you said, vs a good spirit it's very little you can do.
---
What difference does it make? I just said it was in my opinion silly to make such a stretch. Believe whatever you want to believe.
---
That sounds like "the game" a little too much for my liking
---
Did everyone bring party streamers?
---
Something that has helped me when I‚Äôm being chased out the exit is to go through the sides around those brick pillars. Against killers like Billy, Huntress etc who need aim, it can be a life saver.

I would buy  them,they look amazing.
---
I also play on PS4 so some killers are worseon console then on PC. Like Nurse on PS4 is pretty bad. I‚Äôve been playing DBD for a year now and I‚Äôve played against one good Nurse. Huntress is tough on console too.
---
Or all 4 survivors get obsessed with the same gen and then the killer stands next to it.
---
I don't have it yet, but I plan to buy him if it's faster to earn blood points. 
---
You're right, it will depends if I already have what I want on a specific killer.
---
Well, this may come as a shock but the, "killer" wants to KILL you. Some killers are greedy. I know some games I'm petty AF, if you flashlight me I may just tunnel you, camp you, then let your friends farm BP off me just to spite you.
---
I agree with the first 2 changes for sure, but I think #3 should remain how it is now. Her base skill is about mind games so I think putting in the phasing sound when in her radius would greatly diminish her phasing.
---
I was listening to the beginning of 'What He Don't Know' by Anarbor when I saw this.
---
Sounds like a new offering. ‚ÄúSurvivor tendies‚Äù
---
Why would you trade event items for good items? You can bring plunderers and get it easily.
---
i‚Äôm going to find you and fucking stab you with -1.2 seconds cooldown because you‚Äôre not running best for last
---
I'm not going to go through all the killers but this is what I think. 
---
S - Nurse, Spirit 
---
A+ - Hag 
---
A - Billy/Huntress
---
B - Plague, Freddy, Ghostface, Myers, Legion 
---
Huntress isnt A tier on console however.
---
Or have it so it's just Charles Lee ray
---
Hey alright
---
Optimal play is letting all gens get done super quickly so you don't pip.
---
If you get mindgamed as a nurse and lose a chase you're a bad nurse.
---
I, Michael Myers, have a dream
---
Obviously a killer dc is worse in terms of rewards and stuff. But both are equally shitty moves and no one should do that. If survivors had the mentality of ‚Äúuh if I dc it‚Äôs at least not as bad as a killer dc‚Äù people won‚Äôt think twice about doing it
---
As much as I would love the Demogorgon or even some other Stranger Things Killer the fact that this next DLC is also rolling out Dedicated Servers, friends lists, changes to bloodweb and confirmed with a new map I think they would just go 2 survivors and no Killer. Which makes me sad.
---
their wifi router was a potato

Great job sounding like an asshole on this post. This will definitely make people want to come watch you. Don‚Äôt advertise yourself. It makes you look bad.

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I ocassionaly drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at ---ht. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Althought, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Hey they nerfed her clothing so she isn't as hard to see so that atleast says they don't want cosmetics p2w
---
What if it's something made by the entity so it can feel what it's like to hunt personally instead of watching the killers do it
---
And?Why would killers have no chance?Survivors have the hatch as a second chance to get out because they failed to do the gens,so why would the killer have no second chance when he failed to defend gens?

So just 2 survivors as the DLC with no killer, perhaps??
---
Make sure to put lots of work into the hoodie too, way to many legion cosplayers just throw on whatever, but you should try and find a blue or purple hoodie, then distress the hell out of it by making holes and eroding parts with bleach and/or sandpaper. Get some red food coloring and heavily dye the arms around the hands and the front meet the big pocket, get some iron on letters and write ‚ÄúFairview High 1997‚Äù on the front.
---
Edit: that progress on your mask looks great though!
---
Wait a minute; how'd you know I run Hangman's Trick too?
---
AM I BEING SPIED ON!?
---
Billy could be the killer then instead
---
you're right
---
Yeah it was. I kinda just wanted to add insult. He was on the Meg pretty hard.
---
Well now you have something to look forward too! &lt;3
---
The only time I'm hoping for mercy, is after I do 3 gens, get people off the line, then get my first hook to see only one aura (locker fucks) before everyone else goes down as I run around for myself the rest of the game.
---
How would you know this, you ask?  The fuck if I know.
---
I actually think huntress on console is still pretty good! I know I have a lot of success when I play her.
---
21% chance with three attempts
---
With slippery meat, that becomes 42% with all six attempts.
---
‚ÄúgG eNjOy yOuR bAn LaGsWiTcHeR‚Äù
---
&gt; The hatch can get 1 player out 
---
Technically not true. I know you meant at end game, but if theres a key in play theres a 30 second window mid-game where all 4 survs can *potentially* escape; which if you are playing in a swf isnt that hard to coordinate.
---
&gt; Why suddenly keys? 
---
I *think* OP meant that having a key is similar in the sense that if you bring a key you can hide until enough gens are done/enough players die that the hatch spawns and then you can just escape with zero skill. They aren't trying to say keys are unbalanced, just that they have the potential to reward poor play.
---
&gt; now you bring up a biased falsity as if it were a common opinion 
---
It is a common opinion though. You will find a lot of salty players on both sides of the game in this sub, but survs that are trashing killer related things are more common than the other way around
---
Make it so you are Charles Lee ray and place up to 5 of them they walk in a small radius of where you place them . After a given time you can teleport to any doll and can play as that doll with a smaller terror radious or no heart beat and a small piece of music like freddy's lullaby for a short piece of time then you reaaper next to the doll you just were
---
that's what I think too, maybe released shortly after chapter 13, like the ash dlc released shortly after the chapter of the plague
---
so they could release it at halloween, maybe with an event
---
Yeah, I can see that working if there‚Äôs a ST chapter.
---
 [Heres picture of megs clothes and claudettes clothes](https://gyazo.com/349da26b353e7c91795ca0eb87bd4444)
---
I usually play Jane or Bill with this combo and they are way to loud. Jane is like mid orgasm and Bill sounds like hes dying. So Iron Will is a necessity. Plus I like using it during a chase with Nea. Or well when I'm trying to lose a chase.
---
If they do that I'm going to be massively disappointed as I would rather have a new killer and survivor then 2 survivors because survivors are just reskins. Plus I want the damn demogorgon
---
What would you change rule set 2 to? Maybe moderately increase RBT death timer increase jigsaw boxes by 1 and the survivor can‚Äôt see the aura of jigsaw boxes until they are within 10 meters.
---
If it does then they should delete the posts, which they didn't!
---
"If you want something, you can just do it yourself *with a 4% chance!*"

Thank you. Yeah I can‚Äôt see any justification for using that. Might as well just bring bbq
---
Only issue could be that alloyed armor speed boost.
---
Map pressure is key and he can sort of do that. I also love the idea of swapping control
---
YoU ArE UsInG ExPlOiTs. RePoRtEd!1!1!
---
Barbecue &amp; Chilli won't appear for other killers until you've unlocked the teachable - either by buying it on Leatherface/Cannibal at L35 or by getting it in the Shrine.
---
Assuming you *have* the teachable, using Prestige can only ever hurt your chances as it'll reset all your perks to zero. Every maxed out perk you have is one less perk to show up in the Bloodweb, and if you're L50 then you should have quite a few maxed out.
---
Note that there's an announcement coming soon about changes to perks in the Bloodweb - right now it would be extremely ill-advised for you to make any decisions related to perks.
---
Personally I'd save BP, unless you really haven't unlocked Barbecue &amp; Chilli - in which case I'd start spending it on Leatherface/Cannibal in order to get the teachable.
---
I‚Äôm kind of confused by this comment
---
Yes, now take it one step further and realize nurse's entire DESIGN is an issue.
---
Hey if it walks,slashes and oinks it gets a nerf, that or they spin a wheel seeing who gets a nerf and pig has just been unlucky
---
Camping is staying close to someone who got hooked until they die so they can‚Äôt be rescued, and tunneling is only targeting one person.
---
Oh, I'm definitely a bad survivor. I main killer. But if you look at very good players on youtube etc. They get crushed by nurses with add-ons if they know what they're doing.
---
You could have crouched over the traps
---
I‚Äôm ngl I forgot about autodidact haha
---
What?
---
Hope you reported that shithead.
---
Demi refers to Jeff as being god
---
Damnit I had this a week ago. I fixed 2 gens. Came across a totem in a perfect little corner where the killer couldnt see me. So I was cleansing it. All of a sudden 2 survivors came, stood infront of me. I couldnt get out. It took 10 minutes. The 4th survivor got hooked and died cause the other 2 were blocking me. Then finally the killer found us. With 28373 crows on top of our heads. The killer slashed the 2 others and finally I was able to escape. It seriously pissed me off so much. Cause we only had 1 gen left and in those 10 minutes I couldve fixed it and escaped. I did way more than they did. In the end I died and one of the blocking survivors too. But the other one didnt unhook me and he found the hatch. Little sh** faces. It pissed me off. Still does now.
---
So the fastest speed is actually billy at 379% speed (bloodlust 3, almost impossible to pull off) or 334% without bloodlust, both count devour hope, NOED, and play with your food max level. Both of these are unlikely to pay off, but it‚Äôs much better than the nurse as there‚Äôs no fatigue and it‚Äôs one shot.
---
Yup. Plus no one expects it. At least on console. Head on is super rare. Most just run the meta.
---
9% faster Entity progression, 15% increased hook escape difficulty, 9% increased penalty on failed escape attempts. Mind you, all of these stats only apply to the basement hooks.
---
You're probably right, but I just think the demogorgon is so cool that I can't stop myself from hoping.
---
OMG! These are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Maces are also considered holy weapons, so it suits a crusader fighting in the name of god to the extreme.
---
I mean, deliverance will give you a 100% chance to get off the hook.
---
But, you know, it has a few drawbacks:
---
1.  you have to not be the first person hooked.
---
2.  You have to safely unhook someone else.
---
3.  Now you can get off the hook, but you're also broken after you do it.
---
Are there stats posted somewhere? Or did you make that up? Because I would actually really like to see the official stats for the maps.
---
Would've been even better with the Wraith mori.
---
Hey! The LPOTL logo!
---
That is not how additive % chances work haha
---
Yeah I knew about the basement hook part, its a pretty worthless perk
---
That was when I first started playing!
---
My eyes still hurt from all the flashlight blinds.
---
Shut up nerd
---
Hope is a dangerous thing *shrug*
---
Low survivor rank, High killer rank. Doesnt matter, happens regardless.
---
They said they‚Äôre buffing her add ons soon:)
---
He should have a shoulder bash attack.
---
MISERUM
---
This ^
---
Masochits duh
---
Yeah exactly, it's such a surprise for the killer
---
A year ago when I played the ground was green just like that but without the wires pretty interesting
---
Bride and seed were in that wired time before scream and saw but during things like jasone takes Manhattan or the final nightmare where horrors where just comedy's
---
How do * you* think they work?
---
this is a bad idea. We want people to actually start cleansing totems. this perk discourages you from doing that. while running it, you'll either complain when your friends cleanse totems or complain when the killer gets noed.
---
Yep
---
and then call noed OP after we all die
---
I'd say #2 hardest. The coldwind farm is def the hardest because all the pallets line up so nicely and there is still an unreasonable amount of them pushed closely together because of the corn fields. Even unskilled players can loop the killer for a long time there. Then, even after all the pallets are broken, you still have to deal with the corn.
---
I didn't "make it up". It was released in a dev stream a while back.
---
So which do you recommend? I have Laurie unlocked on survivor.
---
They did it to alert the killer to your location. Basically they were just being obnoxious and trying to be funny.
---
.93x.93x.93x.93x.93x.93 for your slippery meat example. Not .07x6
---
imagine all 4 survivors turning into one abomination and exposing the non-injured parts of it to the killer to tank 4 hits before anyone gets downed lol
---
I download them as a video file then upload them. Just screen record or if you use console you can just download them.
---
Nice. Was it all the maps, or just that one? I'd like to go watch it
---
The slice of fried gold looks like a worse kindred.
---
He‚Äôs just saying 6 7% chances doesn‚Äôt equal exactly 42%. It would be slightly less. For example, 2 50% chances wouldn‚Äôt equal a 100% chance
---
I recommend running 
---
-Play With Your food(I think thats the name, its the spider looking one)
---
-ruin/bbq
---
-haunted grounds
---
-Make Your Choice
---
If you find your obsession, you can just unloak and start the chase, then cloak and get a stack for PWYF, then wait for cooldown then rinse and repeat
---
The thing i wanna know is how the hell do you do these so fast, Takes me about 3 to 4 days with enough commitment to do my own.
---
But overall the perk icons have a pretty neat aesthetic too them.
---
I P3'd him as soon as he came out, but I switched back to my P3'd Quentin soon after. Jeff's P3 is literally the *worst* P3 in game, there's like no blood on him at all. When I compare him to my P3'd Quentin or Dwight who are literally stained red with blood, he looks like he just got a papercut with how little blood he has on him
---
Ryuko is my waifu.
---
Its himinoied and seeing how so much of the lore is unknown at the moment it's not that far off
---
*sad uwu*
---
The entity is just neas pawn
---
First page didn't work first but just restarted and now it works... Im stupid sorry and thank you lol
---
My favorite is when I'm the last and I manage to get that super rare unhook, but the camping Wraith immediately downs me and rehooks.
---
Eh, I'm bad either way
---
We already know a killer is incoming, all of the chapters for this year include a killer from what theyve said previously, just some are missing survivors.
---
‚ÄúI need to build my audience‚Äù *insults and berates potential audience* Yep that‚Äôll do the trick.
---
Why are they in .93 integers and not 1.0?
---
Laughs in claudette
---
You have ignored virtually everything I said other than the comments about where to put your posts, so the discussion is over for me. Everybody‚Äôs opinion matters, no matter what. You don‚Äôt seem to understand that, and instead fall into the ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm right‚Äùmentality. You cannot go a post without tryin to one up the other person, and that is why nobody is taking you seriously. For a debate to work, there need to be an even ground and point of view.
---
This is just a horrifically bad comparison.  It's apples and oranges my friend.  NOED is a beginner perk for players new to the game who are still figuring out what it is they're supposed to do in their killer games without the stress of having to play optimally which they don't even know what optimal killer play looks like at that point ie gen pressure and intelligent decision making midchase.  The players that never progress past this and keep it on simply boost rank until they get high enough where they face survivors that kick their teeth in because they never learned the skills necessary to deal with quality survivors or SWF groups.
---
The hatch is a core gameplay mechanic the devs added so that the final remaining survivor isn't a guaranteed 100% 4K for the killer everytime.  The funny thing is the EGC is 90% in the favor of the killers anyways we can close the hatch and we move faster in finding it.  
---
This is just a false equivalency and a very bad one at that.
---
https://i.imgur.com/uhGr0wX.png

Thats damn right mate
---
Naw, I'd much rather just annoy you. Your opinion is wrong, change my mind. I don't have to say how it is wrong, you have to say how it is right and then I'll say whatever is the opposite of what you said. You have to start it or go away lol.
---
That was fast üòçüòç
---
Oh. I forgot I could do that
---
Just short hand for what a percentage stands for (part of a whole). 
---
Could do it as 93%^6
---
You could actually combine Hex: Illusion with Hex: Haunted Grounds and if they cleanse it within 2 minutes then you'll have another haunted grounds on the map. It would also allow for a new russian roulette build which consists of Ruin, Haunted, Illusion and Devour Hope.
---
Is that in this specific scenario, or is that a general rule?  If it‚Äôs the latter I feel like I missed something.
---
Oh wow, thanks!
---
do you have all killers? because they would be priority. I like Pebble guy ( forgot his name) I think it‚Äôs adam? Because auto didact can be fun, and the hook one is a great second chance perk too
---
god those were dark times
---
No problem. Glad I could help. &lt;3
---
idk if i can handle seeing steve die
---
These are the same pig mains that tunnel people with traps on. 
---
I wouldn't exactly expect them to be intelligent when it comes to game balancing.
---
I looked at the past 3 months. it had 40k, 28k, and 27k so I just took 30k
---
He didn't die. Entity brings them back to the campfire
---
I don‚Äôt care if he didn‚Äôt do any gens! I‚Äôm saving that baby god damn it!
---
Spirit's definitely into that shit.
---
I have brought up many ways you can counter spirit. You responded exactly the same the entire time. I am an experienced player, been playing since hag had been released, both on the side of killer and survivor. The reason why I haven‚Äôt brought this up is because nobody asked, much in the way nobody asked you. You say most players agree with you, but as you can see that is not the case. Ironically, the only payers I ever hear claim the spirit is OP tend to be around rank 15. Don‚Äôt pretend you want a debate if you are going to ignore what the opposing party says, and insinuating that other players aren‚Äôt as good as you, or that their opinions don‚Äôt matter because of said skill level, make you look like an asshole.
---
play is alot more casual on mobile than console. ive come across a few stray campers and some visual bugs but its not that bad.
---
It‚Äôs very coincidental that Ben decided to also wear blue overalls alongside that certain mask.
---
Fast like is spirit to down one surv? Yes, that fast
---
It's absolutely obnoxious and if they do it to me, they better hope someone else will unhook them.
---
Meanwhile, in Meg's head:
---
"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck, come on come on come on come on come on, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
---
Chance is static.  If you have a 10% chance to escape, then every attempt you make has a 10% chance to free you.  They do not accumulate.
---
They released escape rates by killer and rank too.
---
Enduring, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher, and Predator. NO ONE CAN HIDE FROM ME MUAHAHAHAH
---
Bing bing boi best boi
---
Funnily enough, players with Object of obsession are the only players I basement camp as Bubba. It's a perk that screams "I'm a dick and want to ruin your fun!".
---
i don't play nurse on console but i do play huntress, i have my camera turned down to about 40-50% to better focus on hitting throws also built in crosshair.
---
Some of them probably don't care. Freddy, Myers, Clown and Huntress are definitely willing and satisfied. Doctor probably is too because some of his addons imply he's continued his experiments even in the Entity's realm.
---
only to die again ;(((
---
So much for respecting the 4%
---
It would be under a million BP to get him from 12 to 35, and bear in mind that he has Barbecue &amp; Chilli as standard - it should be easier for him to farm those BP compared to having to run "perfect" games as your "main" killer(s).
---
&gt; Do these changes will be coming soon ?
---
We're all waiting to find out what the changes are, and when they'll take effect.
---
&gt; ***Bloodweb Changes ***
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; *As the game has grown over the years, the number of perks has grown significantly as well. This can make it difficult for players with many teachable perks to find the specific perks they are looking for. As a part of an ongoing series of changes to address the progression of the game, we will be making a change to the way bloodwebs generate to improve your chances of finding the perks you want while also reducing the total number of bloodwebs required to unlock all perks.* ***We are preparing a communication on this change (and more) which should go out towards the end of the month.***
---
I know he did, but I agree could be trolling, could be serious. 
---
But also maybe he is serious but he isnjustbpart of the project and its not dead by daylight. Sometimes people in companies can have multiple projects or responsibility.
---
But I would really like a stranger things related chapter
---
Mid tier. Definitely not even billy level though
---
Good job, dude. :)
---
where was it said that all the dlc of this year will contain a killer?
---
Since the devs know how the game actually is and since it's only her addons, maybe you need an evaluation on how to actually play against her.
---
It all depends on what the license holders are willing to give.
---
The first ability is a bit weird in terms of cooldown of 2 minutes and the ghouls dying after 1 minute (I guess a complete undead army of like 10 ghouls would be a bit nuts) but the perks seem cool.
---
Hex: Entity's Eyes can work as a trap totem like Haunted Grounds. 
---
Paralysis seems like a counter to flashlight saves.
---
Erroneously lmmfaoü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£a little child trying to use big boy words. Awwwww that's so cute.
---
Eh not really. Since the colors for each map are usually grey,Brown,dark green seeing something dark black is kinda noticable plus he has a damn red symbol on him like he is some comic book villian.
---
I think ST would be more likely. Even if they did Jason, I don't see how he would be much different than Trapper.
---
There's the argument of "well, we have Billy and Leatherface" - and that's true. But nobody likes Leatherface.
---
So killers body blocking is bannable but survivors isnt...
---
I got a hate message for being a ‚Äútroll‚Äù I used deliverance to hop of the hook into a trap DS and then had to 360 the trapper into a trap
---
That would make you a cliche dickhead survivor tho?
---
The percentages on the perks all seem low tbh. Skill check notif. Is just the sound right? So thats basically weak huntress lullaby. And when 1 surv is hooked how does he regress a gen in 5 seconds? Any distance? Is it like a weak pop goes the weasel? Very confused. Also what does he do with a wand? Just bonk people with it? ü§î
---
Making fun of someone for using a word with more than two syllables?  That's pretty toxic man.  You're toxic.  Why you gotta be so toxic?  Toxic.
---
*reworking/looking at
---
&gt;They're thinking "wow I'm playing such a great game", and then it's all over suddenly :)
---
You're exactly the kind of person the entity looks for lul
---
I think Empathy is underrated. I only see it suggested in meme builds, but being able to injured survs and going to them gives the killer a much harder time. It also is able to act as a killer detection perk because you can see where injured players are appearing on the map.
---
This mobile gameplay?
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm new. How did you get out of his arms?

I have a sorta controversial opinion. Alot of people are saying high mid tier and not good as hillbilly but in my opinion he's high tier and right above Hillbilly because 1. Generator teleports meaning he has map pressure which hillbilly does too but he needs to rev that chainsaw while Freddy isn't blocked by anything and can use it for mindgames, 2. He isn't as easily looped as Hillbilly, if the survivor is decent and stick to walls you will need to M1 and just hope they mess up for a chainsaw while Freddy can spam snares making the chase easier and fake pallets barely has counterplay making them strong against people that don't keep track of pallet spawns.
---
Hopefully the killer came and knocked him out. I had a killer game where a survivor did this to someone else and I made sure the person they blocked got out of the trial.
---
this is when you call their mom's and get their xbox's taken away for a week
---
Mobile looks awful, cool that you got a m/k working on it though
---
I said you were talking trash, which is true. ‚ÄúGet rekt‚Äù, ‚Äúbig dummy‚Äù, ‚Äúget fucked dude‚Äù were all said by you during that clip alone. 
---
I‚Äôm not offended by teabagging, but it definitely is considered bm, especially at the exit gates. And it is unnecessary to do when you can leave anyways. 
---
The fact that you purposefully have a day dedicated to toxicity and ‚Äúgetting salt‚Äù is detrimental to the community and only promotes negative behaviour.
---
Hey guys. I want to share with you my thoughts about a killer concept I wish would somehow make it into the game anytime. Not that I am a very creative person but I always wanted to see some undead creature in the game. Please keep in mind that english is not my mothertongue and please criticise constructively. Read it, think about it. What could go wrong? What is a good idea? What is too OP?
---
The fictional character:
---
A Lich is an undead creature with special powers. According to the internet a Lich was an actual human who could cast spells (aka a wizard) so powerful that he managed to bind his soul onto/into a phylacter to become invincible. However they become so much obsesses in gaining more and more power they have no need to care for their body as power is the only thing to care about. (Besides that I decided that liches can see, move, hover etc. just by their pure magic power.)
---
Lore:
---
Once upon a time a wizards apprentice went into the forbidden libary of his master to read books about forbidden black magic and spells. As soon as he secretly gained more power he challenged his master for a 1on1 battle where he killed his master easily and consumed his left power. Thinking of how powerful he was he decided to take over the world with his army of death. Thrilled by his way to kill people the entity decided to drag him into the realms of the underworld. Several hundred years later the displeased entity getting much less offerings as he'd expected (Bubba didn't do a good job apparently) he sends him out to kill those toxic Neas and Megs. 
---
Addons obviously set the amount of bonewalls up to 5, 6 and seven, reduce the cooldown of The Walking Dead, puts more graves and let refill the gauge while chasing faster. :)

Thank you for reading. I love you.

HERS ANOTHER POST BECAUSE THIS WEEK WAS FULL OF BS. HAD A HUNTRESS USE AND INDESTRRANT SHARDS AND EBONY MORI. PICK ONE YOU FUCK
---
Lmao deleted original comment coz u a pussy. Bitch get out of this sub
---
Basement build best build
---
Other survivor; Reported for having fun
---
&gt;It stopped being funny after the first few weeks. By now it just seems toxic. Like the survivor equivalent to teabagging and taunting.
---
lol
---
Imagine running at 14.96 m/s as billy or about 33.5 miles per hour. For reference usain bolt‚Äôs fastest speed in a 100 meter, was 27.8, and here‚Äôs billy, running through an entire cornfield at faster than human speed while holding a big chainsaw and not even breaking a sweat. This is going off of 379%, which is the supposed max speed.
---
Ya its happened once or twice. I just thought it was a glitch and moved on
---
I'll agree with you that he's not cool for ragequitting, but I don't understand the premise of spirit being broken or his build being obnoxious.

IT'S MY FAULT FOR WANTING POINTS BUT I FOUND HATCH RIGHT AS THE GATES OPENED. I STOOD ON THE HATCH WAITING FOR MY TEAMMATES TO LEAVE BUT ONE GUY DIDN'T LEAVE. HE AND THE KILLER GOT IN A WEIRD TEABAGGING STANDOFF AT THE GATE AND WAITED TILL THE TIMER WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN BEFORE HE WALKED OUT. I WAS KILLED BY THE ENTITY ON TOP OF THE HATCH. JUST LEAVE BITCH!
---
How is he an alien?
---
Bad. Havent used it myself but in my experience anyway why the time he teleport to the gen it gets done or somebody else will finish it while you are chasing the person who was on it
---
I take it you are a rank 1 gamer who plays killer the most optimal way possible
---
Why'd you delete the post? I was excited to read it lol
---
Bing

Legion tho lmao
---
Alien/creature. You get the point, yknow?
---
Seriously intentional D/C should ban players from the post game screen. Rank reset always brings out the terrible people. My personal favorite was being told on PS4 that I hacking because I played hag and had add ons for teleport distance while I was trying to get adapt
---
dweet
---
I mean, OP isn't wrong- it is a creature from a whole other dimension, and is pretty alien to earth.
---
Baby dweet

I definitely would've joined just to listen to their salt :D

Git Gud with killer and you wouldn‚Äôt have to facecamp or tunnel...
---
Lol
---
This is a discussion not a complainment, i made a point and i want to discuss the point. If you dont want to discuss then bye. x) The Comment button literally says "What are your thoughts?"
---
God damn is this mobile because textures are straight paper mache
---
He can still hit you when in tantrum
---
Fucking truth. He‚Äôs absolutely awful and unfun to play against. You either spend all game holding M1 to heal or you have a killer who can M1 instadown all game. No fun or interesting power either.
---
It‚Äôs all these people that think he looks kewl and do their little Legion cosplays that main him.....that or people that suck as killer and need the free hit.
---
agreed
---
I mean...as long as I get kills I'm good fam...you're a salty survivor, aren't you?
---
decisive strike
---
For those wondering, I also unhooked before the wiggle wiggle.
---
I don't think so. There's no "joysticks" on screen
---
Honestly disappointed.
---
We are talking post-nerf Legion here, i wasn't around when they were broken. But yeah, they are certainly unfun to play against even if not OP.
---
Idk maybe there's something I dont know about
---
Well look who's shitting in front of the locker Dwight's hiding in.
---
This makes me think we could have a board with 3 different maps from the game, and 3 of the killers, likely trapper, nurse and huntress, we could add some killers if we want. And the 4 first survivors, Claudette, Dwight, Jake, and Meg. Every survivor will have 3 models, healthy, injured, and down. Of course perks won‚Äôt need to be unlocked, and you can equip 3 at a time. The perks are the teachables for the killers and survivors respectively. Items can‚Äôt be brought in and must be got from chest, medkits, have uses and act like an insta heal, unless used for self healing without self care, that will take 1 turn, toolboxes, which reduce the amount of turns needed to get the gens. and finally flashlights which have uses, when the killer performs an action and you are within 2/3/4 spaces, depending on rarity (also you spin a spinner with 9 spaces and what you land on is your item.). Offerings do not exist. I‚Äôll elaborate on more later, any feedback is appreciated.
---
Just to be nice lol of course people know that
---
1 - 0.93*0.93*0.93=1-0.80=0.20. That would result in 20% overall chance, not 21%. Base 4% would result in 11.5%, not 12%.
---
Jeff
---
With permanent frenzy it could be a problem that you cant see scratchmarks and blood...But the point is good, because map pressure is all legion should be about.
---
not unless you are relying on claudette stealth mode to survive. As a killer I find all characters about the same speed unless you are running the sneakiest cosmetics. The only exception I would make is the white fedora that Ace(?) gets. Every time I play killer against someone with that cosmetic I can actually pick them out across the map for some reason.
---
Been seeing a lot more of these in the last month or so. Before I never ran into people that did this. Happened on the farm map and I was cleansing a hex and the guy locked me in the corner for a majority of the match. I got up to poop and came back and he was still there. Good times.
---
&gt; Shadowborn, bbq, haunted, bloodhound
---
thank u
---
As a christian(I'm not a crazy Christian, but a Christian who prays at the table when all of the people living at our house are eating together) I would really like to see this in game! It suits Christians who are gamers and like these types of games. I would totally pay for it!
---
OMG this is my two boys. They are also terrified of Mr. Myers so i will show them this for sure when they get home.
---
2 things:
---
\- The language of this post, a french Employee, on a Spanish Twitter for an English image board...
---
\- It might need more RED CIRCLES, like all over the place. Maybe around "ME GUSTA"
---
Someone made a 40 seconds clip of the singing noob on toast and sent it to me because I told them to cleanse at the side of the map with no gens as a tip against plague because he got us all killed.
---
Playing the game normally as killer is sweaty and toxic.
---
ITS THE PRAYER BEADS ADD-ON FOR HER.
---
Spoilers as well
---
Does the character have to necessarily be alive? I‚Äôm ignorant and don‚Äôt know all the backgrounds for the survivors besides Ash, so idk if they‚Äôre all ‚Äúalive.‚Äù Even then would it really be a spoiler to say he is alive, considering the post-credits scene?
---
I believe the party streamers and cake both reference the fact that these trials were once thought of as fun? Or at least murder parties. Either way, the entity doesn't care. Lose or gain hope, it always feeds
---
Yea! So would we have tiles? And then things like lockers, gens, chests, jungle gyms etc will be placed upon those tiles, to sort of represent what they do? Im totally down to partake in the creation of this game.
---
I‚Äôm not salty. I‚Äôm not the one deleting my whole ‚Äúspeech‚Äù lol. When I look you for 4 gens and drop 6 pallets on you and you hook me and stare at me the whole time, then see you come and complain on here. Just kinda funny bud. I‚Äôve played killer and kill everybody without face camping and if someone gets unhooked I let the hooked boy go. It‚Äôs called being good at mind games bud
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PhilanthropicEncouragingPrariedogDatSheffy
---
I thought of a similar power on a possessed killer robot I‚Äôd call ‚Äúthe automaton‚Äù. A small part of me knows people might have issue with the entity taking a robot, even if it has an evil human soul. A Big part of me say DUES VULT so I‚Äôm gonna say ur concept is better. I only recommend a pole axe
---
Have you MET Claudette, good sir?
---
Other people said that, I never knew. 
---
I‚Äôm just going off what the game said. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
And sorry for sounding insufferable with that, it looks rude.
---
It is if gens were done pretty fast and game was short, especially at red rank. You ain't getting enough emblems. Safety pip at best.
---
I would suggest maybe the hooks are at the bottom of the bar. That way he drags you to a hook and impales you then uses a rope to hoist the survivors up like normal.
---
Really? To me there was only one way to interpret that final scene after the credits
---
Yeah, I was thinking walls tires and pallets as terrain, and chest, hooks, and gens a ‚Äúinteractables‚Äù the hatch is placed by the entity (a sixth player that places the pallets, hooks, gens, etc.) just like in the game (players +1 - gens completed, when the value reaches 0 the hatch is placed) lockers are also interactables.
---
It could also be Brenner.
---
Normally I hate body blockers but c'mon the timing on this one is hilarious.
---
Man I didnt even know that was a perk. I've never seen someone use it.
---
Pallets, there's not many windows on this map
---
are you blind, the lockers doors retract all the way back smacks the sides of the lockers
---
It's not mind games if the survivor is guessing and the killer has no risk attached to the play.
---
Mid tier. Good abilities. Traps are effective at cutting off loops you just need to learn where to position them. I like to put the snares on the long side of a long loop and they either get snared or make long awkward detours. Even better when the loop has tall grass around it. The snares are subtle but effective. The teleport gives plenty of time to react plus it encourages mindgames I use partial charged teleports to get survivors to walk into me all the time or get people on second floors to jump out windows. 
---
But waking up counters him, he‚Äôs slow to start because people need to fall asleep for his traps to work. He‚Äôs loopable in certain circumstances. He‚Äôs just a solid killer with some good versatility not overwhelming but requires some thought to get around. A pretty decent place.
---
ü§î
---
Agreed.
---
Freddy with Ruin, PGTW, and swing chains seems almost impossible to win against unless you‚Äôre a full team communicating with each other but other than that annoying combination he‚Äôs probably right below Spirit and Billy
---
yed
---
I got reported for farming when a survivor asked if I wanted to farm
---
Agreed
---
&gt;are you blind, the lockers doors retract all the way back smacks the sides of the lockers
---
Yes but the stun comes from the survivor elbows.
---
I have fortunately not encountered an actual good Nurse yet. She really is a joke when up agianst someone who is bad at using her. But I know a good Nurse is out there and I am going loathe day I have to play against it.
---
Entity: NO! MY KILLER STOCK VALUE! NONONONONONO!  
---
\*bangs table and breaks their monitor\*
---
Cool, and I bet you got the achievement for that, too. Difficult to get it.
---
I agree with most of this expect for the 
---
&gt; "she and nurse are the only viable killers in the game"
---
Cuz this is true. Spirit,billy, and nurse are the most viable. Every other killer is nowhere near these 3. Nurse because bullshit, Spirit because chase and billy because map control. There is a reason because why these 3 are only played and complained about in red ranks cuz there are the only played.
---
Bing bong boi is best boi
---
He deserved every last bit of the body block
---
yeah boi
---
Yeah. A bit annoying
---
I mean the old Badham was 5th from the end according to those stats and we all now how stupidly survivor-sided was that map.
---
Why are you hitting yourself??
---
Is he standing still or something? I can't see him from across the map like I usually can.
---
Bone Clapper is my favorite.  Everyone hears Bing Bong.
---
no it doesn‚Äôt, the survivor pushes the doors out so hard that the killer is stunned, you seriously think that their pathetic elbows can stun a killer.
---
I actually love the idea of a zombie generating killer. They can slowly spawn slow zombies that are easy to deal with at 1st but as the match goes on they block pathways &amp; loops
---
It's not mobile, notice the lack of joystick icons, and you see the "M2" activate button. Most likely just playing on a toaster, and even then, the frames were low.
---
I'm too blind, I always get him on the dark maps too
---
The gif is fine it's the catering to crybabies who get triggered by teabagging that's cringe, and no it will never die out because killermains will never stop crying about it. Do you ever hear survivors cry about ghostface teabagging or some sweaty killer shaking his head? Right, because we're not pussies like you and the people you're catering to.
---
Download the tap tap app store and it's on that mate, good port
---
If she‚Äôs so easy then get a 4K with her right now in red ranks and post the proof.
---
Well hopefully he didn't report you for intentional griefing since it actually is a bannable offence. Looks to me like you're the dickhead in this situation. He's lookin for a gen to do, you're on a 1 person gen and he left when he seen you instead of blocking you in there. Honestly, if he sees this and follows it up with a support ticket with the link, you've given him the evidence to get you banned.
---
Works well actually
---
Idk a number of factors, like how much killer I've been playing that week
---
There really is no con to waiting as late as possible to use your items, but I wouldn't start before level 45 if you are only playing one survivor (as opposed to switching to another survivor or playing killer once you commit to the prestige and have no perks or items). I think you can get away with level 40 though and still have a few items left over. It just depends on how the rounds go. Sometimes you wont even need to use instas, for example..
---
Starting later means you have a chance to build up your bloodpoints so you can continue playing that character if you just for whatever reason really like them.
---
Starting later in the bloodweb also gives you just a little bit more wiggle room for perk availability. Add-ons can only carry you so much, lol.
---
Bing bong boi is best boi and he is a cutie
---
PS4
---
God bless you
---
I main trapper I know his lunge and where his traps would be seeing how I would do the same
---
Numbuh 4 looking ass
---
i meant the iridescent add on. Damn i completely forgot there was another clapper add on, now my meme is confusing.
---
It's a good one for huntress.
---
I think it's pretty fair since if they don't cleanse then they can't heal either. At that 0oint they take the risk of being one shot in every chase. Although she is by no means a top tier killer
---
This survivor is when a blendette tries playing other survivors
---
That's what I did lmao. Then i grinded out doc to get tier 3 BBQ on him so my grind potential is maxed out, now I'm able to grind efficiently but it took until level 42 to get bbq 3 on doc. Rip.
---
She just needs the ultra rare one that gives corrupt when gens are done built in to rise in the tiers.
---
I think that could be a really good change. It's a bit of an underwhelming addon. Especially for an ultra rare
---
Bites the dust
---
Most viable doesn't mean viable
---
I am immersed as hell as a p3 claud but I always end up doing every single gen
---
Unfortunately head on IS an exhaustion perk
---
Because of her power wtf
---
Run sloppy or whispers instead of your 4th. That perk is really bad and doesnt work on like half the maps.
---
I think the action speed debuff is fair and would be a good way to make her kit more viable
---
Ok
---
Switch node for sloppy and crows for whispers
---
Ya the halloween stuff is probably the coolest of all the event items
---
Yea they‚Äôre reworking the blood web pretty soon to fix it.
---
Must be nice, my trapper games usually go the same haha. Dont see him for half the game and then hit a trap in a random patch of grass.
---
*Iridescent Button*
---
i unhooked myself when in the basement the other day and the look on my face basically said ‚Äúoh my fucking lord i just did that‚Äù
---
i got caught like 10 seconds after 
---
oof
---
My Micheal games go I‚Äôm doing a gen not looking around and I just so happen to turn my camera towards his direction where he is just standing there staring
---
It's usually only a 50 50 if you let it be. I'm a spirit main trust me. People play so predictably that its dumb. You just gotta throw a curveball once in while And it will work. Additionally there is dead hard and iron will which can make it infuriating for the spirit to chase you. It's not always a 50 50. Although I am inclined to agree with you that in some chases, especially against someone who knows what they're doing, it can become a 50 50 type situation.
---
Spies, Mad Grit, Devour Hope, Knock-Out
---
The worst is when you are trying to finish a gen and you‚Äôre like ok perfect lead the killer away and they just bring them right back to you.
---
Nancy Drew Perk fix: -33% speed on other generators
---
I think he ment to say what if the entity didn't just watch killers what if it partakes in killing seeing how it's a non human creature
---
Thanks, I have heard people say that he is nurse level and wanted to see if that was the case.
---
You talking about killers with supernatural powers that get stuned if stabed on the shoulder with whatever the survivors have  :V
---
I could be wrong you can still hold it as it instantly puts you in the animation. You just need to be 100% within the prompt range.
---
you did it too early :/ but its hard anyway so gj on blinding her at least haha
---
Dwight's seem to do the most goofy stuff man
---
I love how accurate this is
---
Hold up. I would like to see evidence for this incredible claim.
---
I can't remember either of their backstories. I will read one every now and then, I've read them all I think. The memorable one for me are Hag's which was well written and gives a good account of her pain and Nurses which seems so lazily done, it is impressive haha. Some of the stories make you feel like the killers would be better motivated to be chasing survivors who deserve to be killed, like Dexter type "victims". I guess it's too late to take that route and it would clash with the other killers who are just plain evil. Still it would be nice to have a survivor whose lore makes you want them to die. That instead of you wanting them to die because of player choices (ahem p3 Claudette crouching in the tall grass waiting for hatch)
---
He isn‚Äôt funny and he‚Äôs not even that good at the game.
---
So how does one find out whether or not a killer has erectile dysfunction?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Put on save the best for last. Farm the obsession and use the speed boosts to instant kill the rest of the team. The speed boost makes a huge difference.
---
That was her intention, this was recorded a day or two after the hatch changes, which is why I had time to close the hatch in her face.
---
Well maybe first you should understand what he did
---
How would you know lmao
---
I only made this so idk
---
I have no idea who you are talking about. Couldn't they just play the game with a different account? I assume it is his account that is banned it would be impossible to ban someone from playing unless they died then the ban would be a stiff position to move from.
---
You can Moonwalk with Myers. Case closed
---
This is so stupid. I love it
---
Or just nothing at all would of been fine lol
---
Sorry if spelling errors am on mobile also english is not my first language
---
Bone clapper is the next best thing
---
Timing was a bit off. You started it a bit too early
---
Expired visa
---
He thinks anyone would hear his plea while acting like that? He is not ready for social media or the internet.
---
I clicked without reading the title and got excited for what I thought was a DBD board game.
---
Why is this so accurate?
---
If you think my ass will buy this scarecrow looking mf you are absolutely correct.
---
Yeah the teabagging.....whatever lol even when someone drops a pallet and gestures or whatever....idc but dam toxic ass rude people lol
---
No they do hardwarebans on this game, but even if he bought a whole different PC the devs would still monitor his youtubechannel and try to ban him that way, (they did it when he played on PS4). So he could possibly play the game but he couldn't stream it or make videos on it, similar to Tyler1 in LoL who btw did get unbanned after a while, if Riot games can do it then BHVR should be able to as well.
---
Ghostface and wraith twinning
---
Yeah you probably wouldn't be able to break a chase against a good Nurse but you are still able to waste a good amount of time.  
---
How else do you think red survivors play when there is only her and 2 more killers on the game?
---
He ruin this game
---
Having new Moris would be cool IMO. Make like really cool p3 and add someone to the shop.
---
This made me laugh way harder than I should have. Haha!
---
around .5 second too early
---
ITS JUST SPIRIT WAIFU POWERS I GUESS
---
No I know I dont take it seriously it's just irritating lol I'm seeing what people mean when they say dbd community is toxic asf
---
That would be the easiest survivor get adept on.  Just add in bt or ds and you have your new meta build.  And the killer counter to your reverse thanatophobia is tunneling?
---
That'd be 42% out of 600% though
---
So then don't play on youtube if he wants to play so bad
---
PWYF DEFINITELY MAKES HIM MORE PLAYABLE, HE‚ÄôS STILL TRASH THO
---
Yup, as I‚Äôve been told 15 times already, thanks.
---
It just gives them a decent "heads up" before I begin running very slowly in their direction.
---
This is what I mean with haters who are still super-aggro after it's been almost a year, try to not be so angry and have some forgiveness in your heart.
---
Eh im *more* likely to let noobs go, I don't want to scare away newer players
---
Dude right? Like I've sent survivors gg's when they escape not once have I been an ass about it if I lose ya know? But I get these high rank survivors and they just stomp me and gesture and teabag and message and its like....dam ok I get it lol
---
He probably does but I wanna see his videos.
---
Billy then proceeded to Camp the hell out of the Survivors next game lol
---
Can you watch his older videos?
---
So far you've mentioned 2 things: line of sight and juking. Juking in plain sight doesnt work, and line of sight only works in certain circumstances because of one sole reason: There's a distance, a midpoint if you will, at which the nurse can blink to, that cover both you continuing to go in a certain direction AND if you decide to double back, simply because she can lunge a few meters after blinking. This is what separates the best nurses from an average nurse at best. I myself have not been able to master this as it takes good timing and precision with her blinks, but this is what makes her really really good. Line of sight works at long distances, where it takes nurse time to actually teleport through shit so it actually does become read based, but the distance between you and nurse has basically been shortened just enough that the next time she blinks she won't miss you. Obviously, with omega blink the distance at which line of sight breaking works is even further, but lets ignore that for now.
---
You started blinding a bit early and do not use odd bulb on any flashlight it‚Äôs has no effect and just burns your flashlight really fast
---
I did have the reset in my edit, but that‚Äôs a separate post floating close toward the bottom of this post.
---
Thank you for this. Last thing we need is ANOTHER KNIFE.
---
Sorry no forgiveness for Pedophiles
---
Respect the Dwight Squad. Just immersed Claudettes are hell.
---
Yeah I just became lvl 15 killer after the reset because I'm learning how to use ghost face and he is insane lol. But hes low level. My highest rank killer isnt even 30 yet lol
---
I wouldn't be unhappy with Hawkins lab but playing on a well done Starcourt mall map would be pretty awesome.
---

Tru3 may be a meme on here but he‚Äôs the most knowledgeable dbd player still playing. He offers great advice. 
---
Im not one to self promite but you‚Äôre welcome to check out my streams as well. Ive been playing this game every other day since Aug of 2017.  (Just got back from a two week break so VOD is a little light) Im a killer main but I have hit R1 survivor every season since Oct 2017.

he and noob3 promote EXTREMELY poor behaviour, this is no secret.
---
This is a fantastic little bit of trivia, I never knew that. Thanks for enlightening me :)
---
K so now game mechanics, players can move 5 spaces when running, or 3 spaces when walking. Killer can move 8 spaces. When in a chase, the survivor who is getting chased moves first, then the killer, than based on priority the other survivors move. Now let‚Äôs talk about priority, you roll a dice and whoever rolls the highest goes first, and then down the list. If someone finds something better, please tell me, this method is boring. I have to go, I‚Äôll tell about ‚Äúsight later
---
He was asking for nudes from underage girls. He took games hostage and did a lot of griefing. You sound a bit ignorant saying that he deserves a second chance.
---
I like this. Do the same thing for survivors as well in the same vein. 
---
The cosmetics literally defeat the purpose of the showing off prestige anyway. I almost never wear the clothing I get as I prefer the darker colors from the outfits in the store. They really need to revamp the prestige and ranking system.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way.
---
I mashed the button so many times and so quickly I don't even think the prompt appeared
---
Taking games hostage, hacking/intentionally glitching, an all around toxic personality, ban dodge multiple accounts, inappropriate actions with underage girls....yeah, no thanks. Guy is an all around trash bag and needs to find another form of income.
---
I kinda agree Legion is one of the weaker killers, however I'd say Bubba needs a buff or a complete rework more imo.
---
Like the others said, Wraith has no way to end chases fast, doesn't have the mobility to traverse the map quickly and apply pressure to gens, and doesn't have any particularly amazing unique perks to make grinding him worthwhile. There is a reason people in purple and red ranks play nothing but Billy/Nurse/Spirit.
---
All these things mean you can get absolutely humiliated against experienced survivors who will have no problem running you around for 3-4 gens, and SWFs will give you a miserable experience. Since you are facing low ranks, you can make him work, but the higher you climb, the less effective he becomes. 
---
You mentioned you played Hag, i'd recommend her over Wraith any day of the week. You have access to Ruin, which is extremely powerful in low ranks (high ranks will usually work through it and get gens done, but low ranks will usually completely stop doing gens and look for the totem), Third Seal which is a niche perk but surprisingly useful, and Devour Hope, which is simply devastating if it sticks around. 
---
She also has a lot of mobility and map pressure by utilizing her teleport, and can mindgame very well thanks to her low height. I recommend Space Coconut on Youtube if you wanna see how she should be played, he is very informative. Plus, she is so rarely seen that many people may not know how to counter her.
---
Its more stealthy than the defualt floating banners around him like hes some sort of ghost
---
I tried to offset the speed with delaying his power and its recovery, but its just an idea. I appreciate the input though. I‚Äôm sure the devs could come up with so much better than I can.
---
This happened to me today at the same location
---
??
---
Are you on xbox? I am. I get off work in 7 hours. EZ
---
Thanks!! It‚Äôs not a bad idea :)
---
Vengeance was what turned her into a raging spirit. Her dad killed her mom, then her with a katana. Wouldn't call it torture considering it was pretty quick and adrenaline made it where the pain initially wasn't noticeable.
---
I like her motivation to kill compared to some of the other killers. I think they're all pretty good, but compared to the Trapper being a rich guy who collapsed a mine and for some reason became a bear trap placing killer, she definitely has a great story.
---
Eh, I‚Äôd agree to disagree here, but I appreciate your input!
---
Oh you play on console no fucking wonder you think Spirit can be countered. Most people on console aren't even using headsets and are playing killer at 25fps on a controller.
---
Lol that was me last night as Freddy. Instant dc survivor so I just hooked each survivor twice and ran around slapping them and putting traps down to farm before letting them out.
---
Bold take: If it only takes a "few times" to get good with a character, they aren't hard to learn.
---
I‚Äôd be a lil upset too if I had some dude following me the whole game with OoO
---
You know, there‚Äôs this thing called latency and you being host will always guarantee you to get the prompt before the survivor can. There was likely a minor delay on the hatch opening for her, therefore you closed it in her face before she could even react. 
---
Killers seem to forget survivors have a delay because of latency. That‚Äôs why a lot of melee hits look perfectly fine on the killers screen but for survivors it feels like they‚Äôre 10 feet away sometimes.
---
Always go for the perk, even if you dont want it. I swear there's a better chance of getting the same perk in the bloodweb if you dont choose it.
---
It's easy to look good at survivor in rank 13.
---
It just shows that any goal and any cause can have evil at its heart, and piety doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that you are correct or good in your actions. There‚Äôs been a great many who have done evil in the name of God, The Entity just slid into his DM‚Äôs pretending to be his God.‚Äô
---
Thanks for the compliment!
---
Assuming entity's gender much hehe? It does seem to want everyone to just hang out for a while, on a hook, placing traps, whatever. There are jungle gyms, sometimes we have cookouts  and margaritas...You chillin at entity's crib, entity's gonna hook you up. Enjoy your time or don't, just stay a while is all entity asks. And if someone tries to leave, convince them to stay just a bit longer.
---
You don't not bing bong when playing Bing Bong Boi.  I mean, it just isn't done in civilized company.
---
That‚Äôs the tea sis
---
That was exactly my thought XD
---
Cmon man it's one thing to say he was toxic but you can't admit that he's pretty good at survivor, same as noob3 skill-wise.
---
&gt; Guy is funny and his videos were very good for learning how to be a good survivor. I don't know exactly what happened but it can't be so unforgivable that you ban him for life can it? If you were running a country you wouldn't throw people in jail for life over things like this either you know?
---
Multiple people have told you what he did.  Maybe you like him and refuse to believe them, but that's your problem, not anyone elses.  Also, in some countries, you can be thrown in jail for any or no reason at all.  Just because you have liberties in your country, doesn't mean everyone does.
---
&gt;I dislike how you show no remorse or chance of redemption while knowingly ruining his youtube-career which he worked very hard on. I can only imagine having such a wonderful job as a youtuber where 10000s of people like what you create and it all gets ripped away from you, it's too harsh of a punishment imo.
---
As I currently understand it, he received multiple warnings to correct his behavior.  He ignored those warnings and continued to proceed with performing the same stunts.  Eventually, warnings stop, and punishments are issued.
---
&gt;I think it should be time for you to think about forgiveness and give this man a chance to play his favorite game again. I don't think he will screw up again with exploits and if he does we can just ban him again, but please give my favorite dbd contentcreator another chance.
---
&gt;I also hope his haters can find it in their heart to stop being angry with him all the time, to this day people show so much hate for him I think it says more about them than about Ochido, please try to be reasonable.
---
How about you be reasonable?  This guy sounds like a dick, and you may like him, but just from what I've heard, we are better off without him.  Good riddance to bad rubbish.
---
That map is so big that you can do all gens before a killer even reaches the first gen
---
play her with headset. You'll understand.
---
I just tried Billy one more time and realized how the chainsaw actually works. it's almost op I would say. Almost impossible for survivors to complete the last generator in open field maps.
---
why do people say it's a different game against her?
---
a knife, im p sure getting stabbed with a knife would be painful
---
it‚Äôs a god damn tentacle hentai monster and you telling me it‚Äôs a girl?
---
I usually let the last survivor repair some gens if they're still available and then get the hatch or exit if I somehow killed all of them really fast (sometimes it happens) and they weren't toxic SWF morons. Altough it makes me sometimes sad when they don't even say "ty" or something. 
---
I guess Entity hates me.
---
Thanks! It would need tweaking and testing, but I think as a concept, I‚Äôm done working on it without any kind of interest from the devs. Don‚Äôt expect it, but I‚Äôve already spent a ton of time on it.
---
I dunno. Their last killer was almost just "Meyers who can lose his power and reenter Tier 1"
---
Have you ever played Identity V? This made me think of a hunter I think is fun if kinda weak, Dream Witch.
---
ü§£ JJ Jonah voice ‚ÄúYou serious?‚Äù Playing on console is harder. Limited controls, shit frames until two chapters ago, and a small dedicated R1 community. If i was on pc not only would I outrun you, Id escape
---
Rank 20 uses a random perk, lol, noob  
---
Like srsly dude, she probably didn't have anything better/didn't know the perk is garbage. I was using insidious on Wraith...
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôve been doing that it‚Äôs just annoying when you work for a specific build and are met with a ton of rng and grinding to get it
---
It still applies to dull and hex totems, so they can still use it.
---
can i ask why you find him unfun? he is pretty loopable.
---
isn‚Äôt it just bad TOTH then?
---
A lot of survivors act very entitled and arrogantly, sadly. Rank reset seems to bring out the most toxic of them. However, it should be noted that not all of them are like this. I've actually met some really cool people in some of my games as killer. For instance, this one time I met a Dwight wearing the pizza delivery guy cosmetics, and, in spite of me getting a 4k and 2 of the survivors disconnecting (both of whom were playing Meg and tried to locker game me shortly before DC'ing), he remained cool, didn't leave mid-game, and said gg after the game. In post-game chat, I gave him credit for not DC'ing when he was the last survivor left on the ground with 2 DC's. He responded by saying it was no problem, and that DC'ing is a stupid move anyways. We both wished each other good luck on our next games, and I then left. This was among the most heartwarming experiences I've had in a videogame so far, and I hope you get to meet chill people like this yourself, even if they are but islands in the sea of toxicity, salt, and entitlement that envelops most of the community. 
---
Another notable thing that I've found is that the chill survivors are usually Jeffs, and sometimes non-Dweard Dwights. However, don't always assume the worst of other survivors, as they can all be good people, even the blue-haired facemask Fengs, or pink-haired Neas.
---
I haven‚Äôt, but I‚Äôll see check it out.
---
?? You're agreeing with me. It is harder for killer because of the limited control and shit frames with significantly less precise audio due to no headset most of the time.
---
Just use Spine Chill, I honestly think it‚Äôs the best perk in the game
---
Actually I see Survivors D/Cing way more from ghostfaces that teabag than killers d/cing from survivors that teabag.
---
I would saaaaay replace noed and spies in the shadows with:
---
Unrelenting and sloppy butcher :)
---
Hag used to be able to do it as well, she was randomly teleporting outside a map when using Mint Rag. Fun times :D (i've only seen videos of that)
---
It doesnt say anywhere that you're using a knife.
---
And just looked at the animation for head on, the lockers door dont even reach the killer at max reach
---
::shrugs::
---
It‚Äôs just a fun idea man. I‚Äôm not taking it seriously.
---
Woah woah. I'm not that serious of a christian. We just pray at dinner with relatives and my dad is trying to get us in a church. But yes I understand what you mean. I despise people who do bad things and then tell that someone else is gonna burn in hell for not being married in a church and what not.
---
P.s. I bet the entity was like "HEY! I'm your god and I need you to kill some people who are doing bad."
---
Sounds like the entity is running a ponzi scheme.
---
I kinda dislike that addon. Maybe I'm one of those "weird" players that uses unconventional strategies but I actually prefer Vile Purge over Corrupt Purge. 
---
I find it really hard to hit with Corrupt Purge (It reminds me of trying to lead targets in Rising Storm 2 when you're in the Cobra's gunner seat with another player piloting, you need to take YOUR momentum into account, as well as travel time for the purge and the target's momentum) and I prefer Rare/NeverCleansers as this means I basically have NOED the entire match + noisy survivors.
---
Iri Seal also reduces your movement speed somewhat heavily when you're "Holding" corrupt purge and makes it last only 40 seconds. (Holding down M2 and running around with your puke fully charged). 
---
I'd rather they just buff Thanatophobia. A PTB had max slow from Thanato at 24% which was huge, but I think it was reverted because it lead to healing taking way too long if you had a case like Legion with Thanata, Sloppy Butcher, Coulrophobia, Dying Light, etc. while you're using Self-Care.
---
I'd just buff Thanato back to the PTB values, but make it affect everything BESIDES healing. There you go, incentivizes healing, makes sense in-character, (Survivors are all beat up and bloody, scared of dying, and can't focus on anything besides healing eachother) slows the game down, and doesn't make healing take forever. 
---
I run Thanato all the time on Plague currently anyway. The slow isn't amazing (caps at 16%) but if NOBODY wants to cleanse and entire gens have to be done start to finish with the 16% slow it can add up, and sometimes the red bar can encourage survivors to want to try and cleanse.
---
My favorite part is Mr. Face's speech bubble lol
---
DC DC DC
---
Sorry if that come off as accusatory, I wasn‚Äôt directing anything toward you personally or Christianity as a whole, just hashing why I picked the concept.
---
All 4 of them could fight each other about the Legion Nerf.  XD  
---
"This is your vault for all the Moonwalking  
---
No its your fault for Abusing Franks Mixtape  
---
It's your fault for using the infinite Mending Add-ons  
---
No, Its your fault for....Just being Terrible...."  
---
  LOL
---
Can we do that? If we can do that, then yes.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Yeah, i do think that having a killer with an insta-down that also allows him to traverse the map in seconds is ridiculous, but at the very least i can loop him, while against Nurse and Spirit there is little to no counterplay. I've tried using him but somehow i always get Lery's or Gideon Meat Plant, so i've never really managed to use him where he's most broken. In any case, if you want to climb to high ranks, learning to play him is a safe bet.
---
that's gonna be a no from me
---
Its also harder on survivor. And every Rank 1 dbd player on console uses a headset. This isnt 2003. Im gonna let you know a secret. There are abundant mtiplayer games on console that require headsets. We even have mics too.  You wouldnt know that because youre a PC player I assume.
---
(spits water out laughing) Dude, perfect GIF! hahahaha!
---
If I was Billy, I would have cried!
---
to me then it is shame on the devs for going back on a permaban like that. to me it is Perma for a reason. if ochido did not want his career on dbd ruined he would have not acted the way he did. the devs gave him more chances than I would have others who got the same treatment as ochido learned after 2 perma he kept it going. he brought like 10 new accounts and still acting bad on them and got punished. hes playing other games anyway he has moved on and you should honestly move on as well. there are many players that are better than him anyway
---
I only read part of the thread, my bad
---
very neat idea would love to see it in game
---
I always love the idea of a killer being a devout worshipper of the Entity. I‚Äôd assume he gets along well with Adiris, they both worship the same god after all. 
---
What‚Äôs his Mori/reload animation?
---
Well the Demogorgon is from a different dimension and so is the entity, being a god(or something like that)
---
It's alright. I run it on Tapp as part of a "Stereotypical Immersed Jacket Tapp" Gen Jockey Build. (Detective's Hunch, Stake Out, Urban Evasion/Dark Sense/Small Game/Prove Thyself, and Spine Chill)
---
And yeah it can combo good with Stake Out against ruin as you can finish the gen via Stake Out or Gen-Tapping (Couldn't resist the pun) and see all the totems.
---
One extra bonus I bet you didn't know about Detective's Hunch. The description says if you have a map, generator's are added to the map. However this is either worded incorrectly, or bugged, as with a green map (Gen only tracking) it seems TOTEMS (And maybe chests?) are also added to the map, meaning you can bring a green map without red twine (addon which allows you to track killer belongings) pop a gen with hunch, and all the totems will be added to your map's aura reading which is pretty nifty.
---
sure, but my point is that the killers are all human, or have been at one point. The entity is separate.
---
More like middle schoolers
---
Maybe for survivors it would be anew gesture? Maybe character specific ones or maybe not like a ‚Äústay low‚Äù gesture or I want to say a taunt but that‚Äôs just gonna make the game more toxic
---
üòÇüòÇü§îüëç
---
That's true, new players vs players who have like 2k hours...
---
The full heal as it stands isn‚Äôt enough of an incentive to give Plague corrupt purge, and you want to remove it? Nah.
---
I am down with an action debuff, however corrupt purge also needs a nerf.  Thats the exchange, get to use the power more, but lose a bit of its strength. If that can‚Äôt be done, then she needs to be left alone.  You can‚Äôt force survivors to cleanse and leave corrupt as is.
---
DCing is a shitty thing to do but I can understand why he'd want to DC as OoO pretty much nukes Ghostface. 
---
Can't wait for the change they want to make to some stealth killers where aura reading is hindered.
---
You could have still grabbed it... not just run off
---
exactly, so clearly it isn‚Äôt the elbows, you know how hitboxes work in this game
---
I'm a girl and i approve of female tentscle hentai monsters because how else are they supposed to stay populated
---
Do you even realize what the Entity is? A multidimensional celestial being, something only comparable to Lovecraftian Outer Gods, a true abominable horror from outer space, a god-like, immortal being that transcends everything, let alone a mere psycothic mortal. You clearly have no clue of what you're implying, but please keep fan-fictioning.
---
As goes for Evan, his father was already mentally unstable, as time passed he started to show signs of madness more and more. Now Evan, always was devoted to his father, he would follow him in everything, it is also clear that he is highly paranoid (about the workers of his property wanting to take Archie's fortune), so they decided to fuck them all up in the tunnels, the father was crazy paranoid and the son clearly had homicidal tendencies, in fact he then supposedly locked his father up and starved him to death, just to have the property for himself. Yes you may say he was crazy too, but you tell me where is the line between pure homicidal madness and premeditated mass murder for personal gain. In my opinion Evan belongs in the 2nd one, and even if u consider him crazy (understandable) i think what he did implies that he also enjoyed it. Yes, the lore says that is not really clear wht happened, but i think the interpretation that i just gave you is the most canon. With that being said, the Entity took advantage of Evans inner evil and forced him into the realm, the fact that (aS tHe dEvS sAiD) he resisted the most is because of his strong will and determination, that doesn't exclude his evil nature tho. Fight me you apologist pleb.
---
Without the bing bong he is just "boi"
---
Maybe or something you can wear over your clothing no matter it is to signify the prestige. 
---
When compared to the killers, I think the survivors were half-assed. Each killer has their own ability. Myers can stalk, Bing Bong can disappear. Yet they call all use the same perks after you unlock them. 
---
Survivors are just skins. There's no value at all to use anyone outside of personal preference.
---
So you are wearing the prestige outfit and forgot you could escape from  hook stop lying
---
Honestly NOED is fine on Ghostface, you can downvote me, but it can allow you to snowball quickly in the endgame and having to take 4 seconds or longer to stalk one person is not reliable snowball potential.
---
(Followed by big happy grin)
---
I suppose looping is not my specialty...I play a never be found style and he ruins that for me.  I find if you are a controller player, looping is nowhere near a skill compared to keyboard and mouse.  But also once I get under like level 7 the wraith and DR show up quite a bit.  I get most of my fellow survivors disconnecting against the wraith and most matches i play where nobody survives is against the wraith.  I like to be able to see the killer as much as possible and be where he is not as much as possible.  When wraiths camp its darn near impossible to tell and they know this, so rescues are a nuisance.  Also he can navigate the damn map so damn fast in stealth mode.  For me personally and my style he is the most OP killer.  Everyone bitches about Nurse but my playing style always does well against her.  I never disconnect a match...haven't in my years of playing...but the wraith makes me come closest to wanting to.
---
Yes, they're often far too assured of themselves.
---
Why would they nerf OoO, it is a perfect risk-reward perk. As opposed to other perks
---
if you use a map and finish a gen near the middle of the map, every items of the level will be registered on your map thanks to detective hunch.
---
With only one gen repaired you know where all the totems are by using your map.That's not a super meta build but that's not too bad
---
I do play her with a headset. That's why iron will is so good against her.
---
Why did they do that though?
---
Wait I'm confrasled can some one please explain what this means
---
Yeah that bit I agree with, but apparently we are getting something Stranger things themed. A lot of stuff has been going on on twitter
---
Maybe a slightly slower move speed while charging it?
---
Bunch of kinkshamers
---
I try to always say nice things after in chat because of this reason. I have few that i dislike and let them know nicely, sadly they get salty. I always say thank you, gg, or i compliment them on finding me when i was tricky and sneaky. :)
---
Oh, man....I had someone pull that exact same shit on me last night in essentially the same room.  They were working with the killer (Hillbilly) and trapped me until he arrived, but he smacked her down to get past her and it gave me a chance to get out of the house.
---
He managed to grab me a little later on as the exit switch was pulled and she was there by his side during the hunt.  Man, it felt fucking GREAT to jump off that hook the minute his back was turned and book it across the map to escape.
---
Despite their bullshit, all three of the legit survivors managed to escape.  It was a beautiful thing.
---
You're right.  Fuck body-blockers and survivor/killer cooperatives.
---
LoS pretty much works all the time with Iron Will, something I advised to run against her. As well as perks like Quick and Quiet which can mess her up at structures with windows. Then there comes the addition of Dead Hard which is literally another swing the nurse must do to kill you. 
---
I actually can do what you're describing and pretty much have it down to a T but Iron Will/QnQ users fuck that play style hard because unless my headphones are making my ears bleed I can't really hear the footsteps or breathing through walls when the chase music is on and since it's now louder again after it was quieter for a patch or so, it's simply not an option. It in essence becomes a form of guess work, like a sort of "Oh okay you were there or going there so you're gonna go this way" kind of thing. And yes while I guess it correct most of the time that's only because the survivors are predictable/get flustered at what I do as The Nurse. But if you're calm and know how a Nurse actually plays, you can do a lot against her, just a lot of people only play one side so they don't see what people can do.
---
I prefer if OmegaBlink was burned to the ground and to never return, it cheapens a lot of what good nurse players can do with just the base power cause most people forget it is hard to play her. In a perfect world, regardless of how "cheap" it would make her feel, I'd make The Nurse have no addons whatsoever because yes I understand her power is great and really strong, but there still is counterplay, if there was no counterplay in what people could do to prevent going down it'd be interesting to change her power but sadly it's just not.
---
Like the easiest power in recent memory with no counterplay or even a smidge of mindgame potential was Old Legion, you remember that right? The literal cancer of basically not escaping and it was only a matter of time before you went down and arguably most people went down to Old Legion quicker than they do *current* Nurse because everyone and their mother ran Frank's Mixtape on them. I came back to the game sometime through Darkness Among Us and I liked base Legion with a Speed and Duration Addon, which was less harmful than Frank's Mixtape and if you played like you should on old Legion it would have increased your chase time by 1/3 by not using Frank's Mixtape, yet I was oblivious to Frank's for the longest time. I then seen it, tried it out and I literally couldn't use it, not only was is precisely bullshit for Survivors, it got me less bloodpoints XD
---
But back on track about counterplay and playing against Nurse, base Nurse is completely fine especially in the context of the best of the best. I know people hate the argument of "Yeah but this exists and therefore this should", but do you really want SWFs to shit on every other killer except Spirt and *maybe* Billy? Is that a world we want to live in? I want the game to be competitive especially high up and it's just really bad news if you're against a coordinated optimal team. You need to balance top down because if you don't people don't improve and the game doesn't change and it becomes the same monotonous bs. I was glad when Spirit came out and I loved it, she changed how I thought about the game and I adapted to playing against her, yet people still complain hours on end about her, yet they probably played against Prayer Beads or simply just can't play the game that you should play against her, which is perfectly fine, you just need the time to learn, just don't cry about it being OP or some shit.
---
Which I‚Äôm fine with. I just don‚Äôt think that the demogorgon has a place in this game, yknow?
---
Tbh I got no idea. I fixed 2 gens all alone. So idk why.
---
I like how they got better and made more sense with time. Hillbilly is probably the most believable of the original killers since it can be argued that he's an invalid and acting out, cause Wraith was by all accounts a normal ass guy trying to make a living who kinda snapped and killed on horrible guy but now is invisible, and the Trapper just makes fuck all sense.  Like where do the bear traps come into the equation, if he's a rich son why does he look more like a hillbilly than the Hillbilly etc. 
---
Then Hag, Nurse, Huntress, they all make sense and their powers make sense with their back stories. 
---
Then it just kept getting better and more sinister, with the powers really making sense with the appearances. I especially like The Legion.
---
The real horror going on here is mlms
---
I really hate the recent trend of giving the survivors control of the killer's power.
---
Yeah, it'll really mess you up, but I feel like blood warden is super rare to see.
---
**Balanced landing intensifies**
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. and not that u asked but i recommend BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is the company still hasnt given us an update that shows the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not yet. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are.
---
They probably just woke up in the morning and said "Ah I'm gonna be a tumour today".
---
HAHAHA!
---
Any killer with BBQ. 
---
Any survivor with WGLF, Prove Thyself and try to COOP gens.
---
 [https://twitter.com/leaksbydaylight](https://twitter.com/leaksbydaylight) supposedly, it was in the game files. there's a photo from a couple days ago.
---
Yeah we need a dickhead survivor who isn't a goodie goodie. Closest we get is Ace and David and they aren't really all that bad just kind of douchey in their life.
---
It looks like he hit him as he touched the exit, so I don't think he could've turned back for it.
---
of course WGLF for survivor, borrowed time, maybe bond, maybe deliverance
---
I FEEL YOU MAN. I GOT DESTROYED BY A SWF AS SPIRIT YESTERDAY THEN HAPPENED TO SEE SOMEONE TRYING FOR HATCH. I DOWNED HIM, CLOSED THE HATCH AND HOOKED HIM. GET A MESSAGE POST GAME (I PLAY ON PS4) THAT SAYS, ‚ÄúOOF. REPORTED MY DUDE.‚Äù LIKE, LOL. YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT WITH YOUR FRIENDS THROUGH THE DOOR AND NOT GOTTEN GREEDY. THIS GAME, BRO.
---
They look really awesome! Great job.
---
Survivor: Any survivor works, but if you want to maximize farm I'd probably go with We're Gonna Live Forever and Prove Thyself as a start.
---
Killer: You'll need BBQ and Chili, which means either waiting for it to come on the Shrine (which usually takes about  a year or so) or buying Bubba with money, then you have a couple of options; you can go general perks and just hope to get points through gameplay multiplied via BBQ, or you can go full Farm Build with stuff like Thrill of the Hunt, Distressing, and another to ensure that you always reach the farming cap.
---
For Killer options, Legion and Doctor are the two main picks for much the same reason; both are great at finding Survivors (So getting Hunting points is incredibly easy), both have easy to get Deviousness Points, and hitting people is easy. What makes Legion better than Doctor is that Feral Frenzy makes finding and getting to other survivors easier than Carter's SPark, and with Frenzy hitting people gives you both Deviousness and Brutality points.
---
~
---
It should be noted that farming with Killer is usually more effective than farming with Survivor. Killer is just you against the Survivors, with Survivors you're competing with Survivors for gens/unhooks/heals and so on along with the Killer who could potentially tunnel you out of the game.
---
Ochido literally created a private group where he would invite mainly females to it and behaved inappropriately with them, and in some cases even asked these girls for nudes. And yes, a few of them were underage. This is not only told by me. This is stated by multiple people within the community, even some who were hardcore fans of him and religiously followed his Twitch channel.
---
And also, this guy didn't exploit for "a singular game". Ochido exploited and griefed for multiple games, ruining the experience for many players and tarnishing this game's reputation, and he didn't give a flying fuck about everything that he did. So cut the bullshit mate.
---
Me running coxcomb: what ding?
---
Keep noed, anyone who says to not is just a survivor main that complains about anything. Slopy Butcher is a good perk for every killer, so run that.
---
If he marries the Hag before the Huntress can find a mate... she ain't gonna be happy!
---
Thanks, I edited the post
---
That's nice of you, seriously even though some killers might get toxic, trust me most of them appreciate it. It's a nice change from the post game toxic SWF chats telling killers to kill themselves and their families after bullying killer for the whole game.
---
It is infinitely harder on killer. Third person with controller with no aiming required is not even remotely as hard as first person on a controller with aiming required. There is no comparison. Have a good one.
---
POG thank you!! gonna have to play tonight i guess :P
---
Not sure if anyone experienced this but, I‚Äôve hit survivors that were clearly on the other side of windows and I‚Äôm wondering what the actual hit boxes are these days
---
it's not relevant since :
---
1/ you don't know you are going to face her
---
2/ she can just build stridor
---
I can‚Äôt not smirk reading that sentence lol
---
For survivor, I run were gonna live forever, empathy to locate survivors so you can body block to get were gonna live forever stacks and heals. Borrowed time to once again get more were gonna live forever stacks, and the last one is prove thyself to get your objective score maxed really fast. On killer (which you usually get more bp for) I would play legion or doctor. Bbq and chili, distressing, maybe thrill of the hunt, (the amount you get is quite minimal but can be nice for the little bit extra) and the last one i usually run is just a perk to slow the game down like ruin or pop just to make sure you can actually use your bonuses on bp.
---
Survivors who start healing 3 feet away from the killer baffle me. How cocky are you? Oop and now you‚Äôre dead
---
Kamen Rider Gaim is mine.
---
Stacks. I need stacks.
---
I mean it's a obvious troll account.
---
SEASON 3 SPOILERS
---
We never saw his body get burned (?) by that machine. So the entity could have just snatched him right there.
---
I think they should make this a legit ‚Äúluck‚Äù / random possibility in real matches with double or triple BP or IS or something for escaped survivors, or 2 hatches or something
---
Rips
---
Because Ghostface‚Äôs ability relies on survivors not seeing him. Since OoO allows you to see Ghostface across the map, you don‚Äôt have to be in direct contact. This is a bullshit counter that needs to be changed ASAP.
---
Well yeah but it isnt only a counter to her. It also hurts nurses ability to track you as well quite significantly. Additionally, it also can be very helpful if you're playing stealth against just about any killer.
---
Edit: and yes she can just build stridor. Which is why you need to mind game her instead of just relying on iron will if you can still hear your survivor crying.
---
Or just make it not 4 seconds.
---
I think he looks like Hagrid
---
Thanks!!
---
This proves respect has to be earned and will never be given freely! Recognition you can get, respect you got to earn!
---
she has the advantage over your mindgames. She can "see" you thanks to your breath or grunts of pain, she still see scratchmarks, she goes super fast and she got a speed burst out of her phase mode. 
---
She can just stop when she does not see scratchmarks and get you with the speed burst. She doesn't need to land a hit as soon as her phase takes end.
---
She isn't at a reasonable state of balance at the moment.
---
I feel like the Hag in my opinion just takes a lot of time to master like nurse, except replace stick skill/muscle memory  with dbd mental mastery. Your knowledge of maps and survivor behavior can be the difference between winning and losing so you don‚Äôt tend to worry about the first gen or 2 since you‚Äôll be building a web around 4 close together gens and wait for them to come to your ‚Äúzone‚Äù where you have all the power.
---
&gt;Explain yourself?
---
Suggesting a 120% killer? Does it actually need explanation?
---
The family in that birdhouse has seen some shit.
---
Yeah I never understood those who tell people to die and that nasty stuff. Im sorry you deal with that. I love the south Park episode about the trolls and cyber bullying for that reason.
---
Any killer can be this speed with one stack of pwyf
---
I have the exact same issue. Even as survivor at rank 13 I find myself going against rank 20 killers and rank 13 survivors at rank 20 as killer
---
Which is a perk
---
Should've run straight out.
---
She does. And yet she doesn't have a 100% win rate. She should have an advantage over you. It's 4v1 not 1v1.
---
Franklin's is better
---
Yeah I once vs a legion and we all got basement hooked quite early. But one of us got lucky and as a result we all escaped
---
Trash tier perk, Franklin's demise is waaay better
---
Bone clapper nibbas b like BING BONG BING BONG
---
You want to give a killer a free and permanent pwyf? Are you high?
---
Also he is lured by blood and can track it from the Upside Down and then ambush his targets in the real world. Also i feel he should be super strong in the Upside Down or at least the Survivors should be weakened somehow (because of the toxic atmosphere). 
---
There is definitely a lot of potential for some interesting mechanics
---
1 stack of it yes
---
It doesn't seem fair if you avoided getting hooked the whole game and your only chance is taken away
---
Thank you, random citizen.
---
Ok ty. Should I run it until I find it in the blood web or just completely ditch the perk?
---
Edit: it being franklins
---
Yea I hope so
---
Wait you don‚Äôt trust people wearing a mask and holding a weapon that‚Äôs kinda racist. #killerlivesmatter
---
So if you were to drop off the second story to the floor below with Balanced Landing, would you speed off or Break your legs?
---
True, he's still a pretty fucking gross and abusive person in general though.
---
PC; custom icons
---
nuff said
---
Ahem.
---
#FOUND THE MASOCHIST
---
I want to play him already, he seems really fun for a more aggressive playstyle rather than trying to get the drop on survivors like many other killers. Top-notch, OP.
---
Edit: Also his successful hit animation should totally be him flourishing the morningstar, spinning it around his wrist as in Mordhau
---
Increase feral frenzy speed, get rid of the drain to power gauge that occurs when using default attack, stop draining power gauge for missed hits.
---
Hey you never know the devs have shown the entity getting more powerful as the plague came from all the way back at that time Era. 
---
So you never know, and I for one will love a stranger things chapter but I also would love an original chapter aswell
---
Naaaaaah. Chuck won‚Äôt work in dbd. Clown wise, I think penny wise would be better. Only issue is he himself is an entity so that wouldn‚Äôt make sense. Killer Klowns is just too goofy imo, I personally like to immerse myself in the game, and that would sorta ruin it for me
---
Wow, a 90% chance to escape is fucking great. Definitely running this with friends next time one of our friends is killing
---
That would be epic
---
Likely (because he is the most humanoid creature in ST), but as I said in the picture, it doesn‚Äôt fit the game.
---
The fact you resorted to the PC Master race argument greatly informs me that you have a cognitive disability. Im so sorry. I would not have argued with you if I knew this. I would have offered you a lollipop instead. üòî
---
Let's see, to start The entity is itself a living being, what he does is he grab people with disturbed memories and therefore weak mind, and transport them into its realm, depends of why they were disturbed, then they are killer or survivors, like, The spirit, she is a killer because she wanted revenge for what her dad did to her and her mother, and once they are in the realm, it make the survivor to forget all, letting them in a survive-only state, and also corrupt the killer to make then want to kill, he do all of this, because he eat the souls of the survivor, everytime a survivor die, he consume a bit of their soul, but to it to happen he first need then to be mentally unstable, because they are desperate or whatever, and the killers are there for it.
---
Poop perk.
---
They said this awhile back
---
i Wouldn't say they have mandatory perks, except for pre rework decisive, bbq is good, but you can still do alot good when replacing it with something else. I could say that with the experience of myself forgetting to actually use bbq's aura showing, and doing just fine.
---
(i also got both those perks through the shrine soooo)
---
What if there was a custom mode you can set up where others will join when you start queuing for it where there‚Äôs more than 1 killer (say 4) and a few more survivors plus bigger maps
---
i havent used NOED since i started playing because its pretty cheese, but keep on assuming. im just saying it is a good perk even for instadown characters (except Hillbilly), unlike what people keep saying.
---
*Everyone likes that*
---
Good job not crediting Ohtofu for this idea,  I can link the stream
---
I like that, but it would be nice to get a new idea instead of a continuation of hallowed blight. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love those skins, but I think they should do something different. I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if they decided to do that tho
---
Still, a tremendous backstory and character.
---
It's been on the sidebar for as long as I've been coming to this subreddit, about a month now I think?
---
The pig is.... extremely far from overpowered.
---
What are you on about? It's clearly a lyrical masterpiece, one to be remembered throughout the ages.
---
If we get one I‚Äôd like what we got last time but maybe the clown or hag or hell even ghost face if possible. But idk if the devs really even wanna do events like that anymore cause of the battle pass that is coming out but we will see
---
Not really. Maybe Nurse with some certain add ons, but that's it. Definitely not the Pig, no amount of traps or stealth can prevent her from being looped.
---
I honestly hate you for knowing that exists
---
upvoted
---
Yeah. If they add it I wonder how they'll justify its lore.
---
Elaborate?
---
Oh that‚Äôs happened to me a few times already, but I never DC‚Äôed for the challenge btw
---
She has been nerfed so many times. If anything she needs a buff. It isnt that she is overpowered, you just need to learn how to counter, when there is a stealth killer, the only real way to counyer then is to be better at stealth or learn how to loop killers.  Pretty much, if you get caught, run away and get outta site or occupy her time while your teammates do gens. If you have a trap on you, it isnt a problem until it is activated and they can only be activated when a gen is done. So until that happens you are all good.  You gotta out stealth stealth killers.
---
Only killer that I‚Äôd argue is over powered is nurse. The pig is super damn weak
---
No elaboration is needed? You need more experience playing this game, Pig is about as low tier as they come right now.
---
&gt; bad situation
---
**angry face**
---
&gt; badder situation
---
[**ANGRIER FACE**](/intensifies)
---
I... honestly have no idea what you are attempting to say.  Please rewrite it with proper English and we'll try to help?
---
Eh, I‚Äôd rather get the BP and get more the next day. I never dc‚Äôed for the challenge btw
---
I replied to another person about my thoughts on a continuation of hallowed blight. I would like to see something different, but that‚Äôs just me. And I just realized that we still have no Michael Myers or Leatherface skins. Maybe they can cook something up for ‚Äòem
---
Yeah but looping isn‚Äôt helpful if you‚Äôre trying to get a trap off before it kills you
---
Thanks! I sure hope so
---
 Let's see, to start The entity is itself a living being, what he does is he grab people with disturbed memories and therefore weak mind, and transport them into its realm, depends of why they were disturbed, then they are killer or survivors, like, The spirit, she is a killer because she wanted revenge for what her dad did to her and her mother, and once they are in the realm, it make the survivor to forget all, letting them in a survive-only state, and also corrupt the killer to make then want to kill, he do all of this, because he eat the souls of the survivor, everytime a survivor die, he consume a bit of their soul, but to it to happen he first need then to be mentally unstable, because they are desperate or whatever, and the killers are there for it.
---
Everyone has that one killer they just can't escape. Im purple rank and every time I play a clown I just make stupid mistakes and play like a baby dumbass dwight.
---
If his power was more than a "hur hur have fun healing hur hur" then he'd be more interesting. Everytime I get hit by his power I can literally stop and mend because he already took off to stab someone else. It's boring and flat out lame. 
---
Your suggestion is not a buff. It would make his power even more pointless. So, no. He should just have a different kit.
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
He enjoys getting sliced üòè
---
It's great for a medic claudette though.
---
They would have to work really hard to get permission to do that and it would be even harder if you could get it free for a event. But ya I hope we still get events but I just have a bad feeling about it
---
I detest add on dependent killers. I wish she was simply reworked.
---
How would his Frenzy work? would it be 125% always or a static boost of 5% to your MS?
---
Until they make an offensive action and lose it
---
The point of the game as survivor is to be able to have nice chases. If a good killer prevent you to do that then there is no point. hiding is not really possible and isnt' interesting, unhooking isn't interesting just necessary, doing gens isn't interesting.
---
survivor = chases that's it.
---
Moreover if the chases are too quick against a killer who got a good map control such as the Spirit, it's not possible to pressure her with gen rush.
---
And what's your point with the "100% win rate" ? Look a streamer who spend a lot of time playing the game and check his win/loss ratio with the Spirit at high rank. I'm pretty sure it will be over 80%
---
A good Spirit can 4K a coordinated swf. By definition it means he can't lose against a good solo team.
---
The Entity also sell Lularoe (mostly just to Meg though)
---
wow! Is almost like it says on the roadmap! 
---
Who could've known there is a new chapter late this month (PTB) or early next month (actual release).
---
Well I always escape the nurse but not the pig lol
---
You face shit nurses
---
Dude, piss off. I know. Im just excited!
---
That makes me feel better!
---
Ive seen people link their etsy. One example is the enamel pins for the survivors and killers.
---
Before the killer puts a survivor on their shoulder they "reposition" them to make it easier to put them on them. Right when they start this " reposition" you start the blind
---
Yup we will prob hear about it in a couple weeks
---
Nurse, Spirit, sure, they can be OP.  But Pig?
---
First off, she roars before her dash out of stealth.
---
While in stealth, she can miss super obvious things.  I have watched a pig, crouched, walk right by a David, who isn't in the grass or anything.  I believe this is because the black whisps around her screen obscure her vision even further.
---
RBT might seem hard at first, but without addons, there's only four boxes.  You have all the time in the world to search those boxes until a gen is done as well.  After that, sure, you are on a timer, but you know exactly where the boxes are at all times.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but every killer so far has been, or is human. The demogorgon isn't, nor has it ever been human.
---
Also, if we want to go off of the track record of the devs and they say non-humanoid killers are difficult to code, give up. These devs are borderline sabotaging their game with the quality of the code they input into it. It's taken 3 years for us to *get close* to dedicated servers, something that should've been higher on the priority list, so unless these jokers resurrect Einstein, they'll never pull off adding anything to the game if they themselves admit it's even remotely complicated.
---
Not trying to bash on your idea, although I myself don't care for a demogorgon as a killer, I'm just pointing out that if the new chapter is ST-based, it most likely won't be a demogorgon, or anything not based around being somewhat human.
---
2 kills is considered a win by the devs so be happy your not completely bad one to two is the average!
---
Take off NOED and replace it with Whispers. You‚Äôre an instadown killer anyway, and whispers will synergies well with the other perks (as you‚Äôve basically got a tracking build).
---
Thanks
---
Not at the start. It spawns based on how many gens and survivors are left.
---
bat thun i wuld be vary cuol mann c:
---
&gt;Another thing is that during a normal game, against a good killer, you don't heal by yourself so many times to bring a perk completely dedicated to that.
---
I guess you've never played with rank 20s?
---
That was fucking amazing to watch
---
Go respond to my other comments where i say what is better about wraith then. 3-0 to me, your turn
---
They announced it officially during their anniversary stream in june, but it was leaked back in may.
---
Wraith ;-;
---
Because they need to ask very nicely to copy right holders and get new contracts and etc. ghost face is easy since they 
---
only need to ask the mask copy right owners hell they don‚Äôt even need to ask them if they don‚Äôt change the mask. And as much as I like the pig she‚Äôs not as known as say Myers and Freddy and leather face so it will take a lot more work money and convincing to get that to happen. I doubt they are saving anything. Although I‚Äôm sure they are trying to get new skins for them though just that it will be way harder
---
Kate's Jiggle physics indeed
---
He‚Äôs very good. My tier list would be something like:
---
Nurse, spirit, billy. The best in the game, top tier. 
---
(Fredward, Mike, Huntress, Hag), ghostface, plague, pig, clown, doctor, wraith, trapper, legion, leatherface. 
---
The killers in brackets are interchangeable. Been playing dbd for 2 years now and I‚Äôm still not 100% who‚Äôs better out of those 4 because they‚Äôre all around the same level imo.
---
So punish the killer for doing well? NOED is in a fine spot and doesn't need any changes.
---
The main idea was to make it more used and less hated, some games you really need a noed even thought you did well, so the fact that some totems will come back to give you power is nice. Also if a game end with 0 to 1 hooks, those survivors don't even need to care about NOED, this killer is probably afk
---
We need a lot more info. Did anybody DC? Did everybody die after being hooked only once? How many gens were done? Did you get ran around all game or did you end chases quickly?
---
You lost bloodpoints and didn‚Äôt get xp though, so it was probably a glitch
---
I have no idea who that is. The only streamers I watch are HybridPanda, Tru3, and Monto. Link it please.
---
What? You literally only gain noed if you are doing well, It will punish killers for not hooking, if you hooked one person twice, no matter if all totems were cleansed, you'll have noed
---
 
---
How did you get 4 kills if you let one guy leave?
---
I did chases very quickly since i got hatchets nobody dc almost everybody have been hooked 1-2 times i belive 3  gens left i didnt get runned around.
---
So sorry for my mistake, please don‚Äôt eat my ass spirit
---
It's not a bug it's playing on console
---
3 men\*
---
But it would be so worth it. And there‚Äôs literally no downside for anyone. We get sick new skins, bhvr makes money from those skins that we will inevitably buy, and the copy right holders get royalties and praise. Everyone wins :D
---
For me, the Quentins I play with or go against are the people that ship him with David (their pfps usually have fan art). They‚Äôre really wholesome and fun players!
---
What perk would that be?
---
but the copyright holders may not see it like that. why do you think it took this long to get skins for the pig? shit is not easy
---
This is the same dude who was talking shit the other day saying stuff like " why do you noobs think your opinions matter? Just stfu" he's a dumbass with absolutely zero knowledge of the game who comes on Reddit to troll. I don't know what his deal is.

‚ÄúOh noo‚Äù what?
---
bro thats my exact billy setup except for ruin, i have nurses there instead
---
Sorry /s
---
Now he ain‚Äôt bell boy with out his bell
---
Oh no, I'm not offended at all. I know the fact people sacrifice, kill, and etc. to please their god. And I don't see what you mean by accusatory. This character doesn't seem like it should be something people get offended by unless they think you might be saying that Christians are bad people and they kill innocent people for the sacrifice of their god. I'm not one of those people. Just be on the watch for people like that an watch out for heretics who say that all Christians are like this. Zealot concept gets an approval from a christian.
---
Great concept, design, and gameplay. I think bringing on more killers from other timelines and original likes is great for the game. In a technical standpoint, he might be a bit OP, but the overall concept makes me want to play him already. 
---
Great job on this! Would definitely main a medieval killer! :)
---
lul
---
Because then it becomes a fight over who gets which survivor. If you have all your perks on Dwight, but there's already someone trying to get a Dwight daily in the lobby, who has to change? Allowing multiple of the same survivor doesn't hurt anyone, but restricting does.
---
No, the postal dude is completely different. As he doesn't kill because he likes to he does it because his mind tells him to.
---
That's why you level up different survivord
---
Why? So some dude with a trash personal life can come ego boost themselves as such? üòÇ
---
Well, sure, it can counter ruin and NOED, but here‚Äôs the thing, the requirement, to complete a gen, which is the killers main goal, to patrol gens, so it‚Äôs either your hella immersed, or you get lucky and he chases another guy so you can pop a gen, to see auras for 5 seconds. The pay off is not worth it for the requirement. And also, you would want to find ruin before popping a gen, as that shits really annoying, and NOED is counterable already, totems are pretty easy to find if I‚Äôm honest.
---
A good way to buff this perk is make it so that it‚Äôs when a gen is completed, and make it for 10 seconds. That way it would be a decent perk that‚Äôs good because you can be chasing a killer around and then have time to make notes while the killer is chasing you, making it pretty useful.
---
Does it matter though? Just down them. They either leave or they bleed out so I don‚Äôt see the problem with disabling it inside the gates.
---
You shined the flashlight on her ass brotha
---
Ah, like Michael Myers then
---
When you dc as survivor you just make the game worse for 4 other people. Survivor side less chance of survival and points killer less entertainment and points. Dcing as killer is just a waste of time for 4 other survivors
---
Justify dcing by saying "it's fine if it's not fun for me" it's just egoistic. you shouldn't play online games if there's a team in it, so no moba no counter strike no Apex no shooting games and so on if your mentality is like that
---
People like you who feel morally right to do so are the most annoying and disgraceful people to have in these kind of games, you just ruin others experience just for your ego. Instead you could think how to get better and what mistakes you did and learn the game, is part of it.
---
Just dc because you feel like it isn't an excuse to do so and I can't wait to see the servers up so would be easy to detect who disconnects on purpose and be punished to do so like any other game
---
Yes, and shorter. And with the goodest boy champ
---
I'LL RUN SOME PIMP DADDY MYERS TONIGHT!!!
---
I don‚Äôt ever account for Stridor, good Nurses run better perks.
---
HOPE I'LL RAN INTO YOU
---
  This happen to me today lol, team member gave me a skeli key and I ended up getting downed, the person who gave me the key escaped. But got hooked near the exit gate and ended up getting really lucky, Then i had to dead hard into the killer (thank god he's dumb)  then escaped.
---
(i also had DS so he legit couldn't do anything, poor killer)
---
I use No Mither, This Isn't Happening, Spine Chill, and Resilence. The Gen Rush Set as I like to call it.
---
Because every other killer you have to loop and use windows, in most situations dropping a pallet or taking a windows VS a Nurse means she‚Äôs hitting you. The things that save your life VS any other killer are not as powerful VS Nurse. You have way less at your disposal and honestly have to hope she fucks up 9/10 times.
---
Can be opened if the killer closes it. And hatch doesn't spawn untill the amount of gens done equals the amount of survivors alive +1. So if all 4 are alive, all 5 gens have to be done before it'll spawn closed.
---
I have the same glitch I know I will have this glitch if I can‚Äôt selfcare and can‚Äôt wiggle while a killer holds me
---
It's a bit late for this meme, don't you think? Also, I'm pretty sure it's a repost.
---
/facepalm
---
r/ontheledgeandshit
---
Its not confirmed, and I‚Äôd say licensed is more likely. The last 4 full chapters have been unlicensed, we did get Ash and Ghostface too but we‚Äôre long overdue a proper licensed chapter with a map imo.
---
No, it won't. At the moment every single Survivors is the same. There is no specific quality like killers that have a special skill. Survivors can just all bring the same items, bring the same perks all you got to do is unlock the teachables just like killers need to if they want non-generic perks.
---
By forcing 4 different survivors you guarantee that obsessions are identifiable by looks, and that survivors in general are more versatile at lower rank since they will all have their strengths and weaknesses.
---
Survivors at the moment are so fat and happy doing nothing but playing the meta that it's pointless to argue that stuff needs to change in order for this to be implemented, it should have technically been there from the start of the game.
---
I know! So it is a glitch? Tbh i have 300h in this game and i found maybe 2 glitches.

Yeah, that may be true, but it could also not be true. No one knows anything right now except that there will be content coming at some point. It literally doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs just annoying to constantly see wacky theory posts like this where people pull the most ridiculous reasons to theorize when they could just not do that. It‚Äôs okay to be excited and everything, but weird stuff like this gets tiring to see. People on here really acting like conspiracy theorists and stalking every moves devs make to support their theories just gets creepy.

Problem is I really dont care for licensed content as much anymore. Barely any of the licensed characters have been decent besides michael freddy at least now and Ghostface. Not including survivors because they are mostly just reskins. I just want og content since it seems we get the most effort on those.

The twats love saying EZ. Never had one of them say "disgraceful defeat" but you can't win with them. I 4 manned earlier today with Trapper and one of the fucktards still said 'GGEZ" I'm like WTF.
---
It gives you another chance to continue looping. Wasting more of the killers time. Tunneling killers will tunnel no matter what, so buying extra time for your team is a good way to make the killer lose.
---
Noob has actually reformed. He actually ranks up and at least admitted to deserving his bans

Legion. Hes balanced now and hes no longer bad for the game, but having to heal twice everytime you're hit always sucks

Trapper gives me anxiety.

In the forums the moderators are literally dictators
---
If they don't like what you post (always in a civil manner of course) they ban you. If you criticize something they don't like they ban you or shadow ban you (nobody sees what you post). If you respond and destroy someone's argument always being civil, you get banned
---
I talked with a lot of people that had the same problem. I literally got banned for saying "don't listen to them, they are new to the forum. Just ignore them" defending a guy who was getting dumped on for no reason and in the e mail I got the message "I warned you" when I got banned
---
Contacted people who had the same problem. Tried to contact peanits(moderator) but instead of replying ( for months ) he prefers shit posting and memeing around in the discord while I message him.
---
So no, don't get in the forum. The moderators are borderline mafia like since even NotQueen know these things and they do nothing about it.

Just ignore the forum, full of idiots (moderators)

I was going to respond but you clearly see this as a war and not a friendly/normal conversation. I'm not wasting my time here.
---
Just don't downvote people because they see things in a different way.
---
Bye bye
---
I hate freaking nea bro she‚Äôs too toxic
---
OoO makes Ghostface, wraith (?) and pig completely useless. Combine that with swf and you probably insta win. A perk shouldnt negate a killers power like that, especially when only one person in a group needs to run it. Imo it definitely shouldn't work on killers with 0 terror radius.
---
Define how the killer did well?  Not getting any hooks until your NOED activates isn't doing "well".  It's quite literally as opposite of doing well as it gets.  It's also a common scenario for those that run this perk.
---
Wow! Imagine bein passive agressive with someone that is just hipped! What a great human being you are
---
He‚Äôs a trash survivor when he plays real killers. Tru has destroyed him and his swf squad so many times
---
Still rather the black claire redfeild hair instead
---
Legion no doubt about it
---
But do you really believe that when you DS the killer is gonna let you go? You talk about tunneling but now you defend with extra time... that was not the original excuse.
---
Wraith. On console with the crappy frame rate it‚Äôs hard to see him when he‚Äôs invisible. And also he‚Äôs annoying as all hell.
---
I misread his post. I thought hooks destroyed totems. Rereading it I still don't get what is supposed to happen. All it talks about is destroying and repairing totems which seems pointless especially on a perk that needs no changes.
---
That‚Äôs called ban evasion which is against dbd tos. So he‚Äôs still knowingly breaking the rules.
---
You don't get to use the word lazy to refer to the opponent when using NOED crutch.  That perk is as lazy design as it possibly gets.  Spawn in, don't pressure gens, and bam instadown plus haste for getting your salad tossed.  Well earned.  Well earned.
---
People should stop complaining so hard about the shrine. Do you expect them to just give you great perks back to back? Maybe try a perk that isn't the meta?
---
The grind isn't that bad tbh. I've only used the shrine once to get Self Care like week 2 of playing this game. Realizing on PC I could buy characters with shards, I started putting all my shards into that. Then I just ranked every character to 45 to get the perks. Doesn't even have to be all the characters, just the perks you want.
---
Tldr: stop complaining and deal with it
---
I had a killer do this to me yesterday. 2 of our teammates disconnected and the killer lead us to their Hex: Ruin so we could cleanse it (thinking they were going to let me and my teammate farm). Then he blocks us in a corner for 5 minutes trying to get us to disconnect from the game. Eventually he disconnected and we still got our bloodpoints. Definitely reported him for that.
---
&gt;Wow! Imagine bein passive agressive with someone that is just hipped! What a great human being you are
---
I'm sorry, hyped what exactly?
---
Ahh, the classic sex position the 96. Requires a lot of neck twisting to eat your partner's ass but very worth it
---
More of a sign that Riot is actually an absolutely disgusting company.
---
Drop the odd bulb, it makes your flashlight worse. Batteries and filiments are the only good add ons. 
---
Flashlight saving is not easy. The way i time it always is by starting the blind as soon as the survivor is ‚Äúat their highest point‚Äù in the pick up animation.
---
Eventually you will get a certain feel to it and it becomes muscle memory and you can time it in your head.
---
Wtf how?!?
---
WTF I have to spend money for Kate rly....
---
noob3 also isnt actually good at this game.
---
A lock painted black.
---
Must be a new killer lol.
---
Do people not understand what a joke is anymore?
---
Well that is 3/5 dlc killers that have been good. While Pig is mid tier, she is very popular too so I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs a waste of dlc too given that so many people enjoy playing her, so we could even say 4/5 licensed killers are good.
---
Of unlicensed dlc killers, 3/8 are good (Counting Nurse, Spirit and Huntress). I guess you add hag in there as although mid tier, she is popular like Pig so you could say 4/8.
---
So going off that, there isn‚Äôt too much correlation of the amount of effort they put into a killer and whether they are licensed or not.
---
Just imagine a dweet using a trapper costume or clown as david, fucking amazing
---
He'd be great for many play styles. Prefer to zone? Keep your armor widespread and switch often to patrol. Prefer aggression? Keep them tight. Camper with Insidious? Toss them in a few hidden spots and surprise the shit out of the survivors. Hate loops? A few well placaes armor suits can break common loops.
---
The whole thing is that you can't be everywhere at once and it takes time to move 5 individual suits to places you want them to be. Imagine how you gotta haul ass around a map as trapper, and now multiply that times 5.
---
But, you have versatility and options for how you want to proceed. If the survivors give you time enough to block them entirely inside of a building? That's just their own fault at that point.
---
Money can definitely change the lore.
---
Why are you being downvoted this comment chain is hilarious.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate that compliment! I wanted to show how there can be evil in any cause or intention. He was already evil, but the excuse of doing it for a higher power caused him to be cruel and brutal. Perfect for the Entity.
---
Thank you! I worked hard on it!
---
I'm not crying! Just got something in my eye, that's all...
---
Good. He‚Äôs a cancer character and belongs in the gutter until they rework it completely.
---
Because they're new, maybe? New players usually don't notice right away that there's an audible notification before a skill check.
---
Updated Thread
---
Awesome :&gt; I'm glad you like it!
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Lol. You don't pip because you got an extra hook late game. NOED isn't nearly as big of an issue as you make it out to be. In fact it's a weak perk. I don't waste a slot running it.
---
Yeap, obviously there would need to be testing and balance, and since I'm not a Dev or Designer, that's going to be an issue with any of my concepts, as they have whole teams for this and I'm just one big brain time individual. 
---
But I'm glad that I hit close to the mark! I only make things I'd like to play with and against, and I think the technical challenge of judging if it was worth knocking a suit or armor over, or just watching it like a hawk in case it's eyes started to light up would be butt clenching enough as a survivor that I'd have fun.
---
It's one of the few times the face actually looks like the character in these art banners. Refreshing. The rest of her body however, lol. She's jacked.
---
So I should use that perk
---
So they can enjoy playing one, putting the few rounds worth of BP they have into a survivor they like, and then not being able to play that survivor next round. What a wonderful idea! It's not like it doesn't already take millions of blood points to get the perks you want on one survivor, so let's go ahead and make it so you need to have the build you like unlocked on at least four survivors to ensure you can actually run it. Restricting survivors adds so much to the game, I can't believe that it wasn't in the game from the start!
---
You killed her directly in front of the hatch. You literally killed her inches from safety. All I can say? Strongest possible flex.
---
i watched a lot of vids of people playing it and my friend gave me a code for xbox game pass for 2 weeks so i could actually play
---
Like these guys have mentioned, anything attached to a chain is considered a flail. A morningstar is meant to dent and cave armor to make it harder to move in armor as well as to immobilize knights and break bones. Now with added spikes for penetrating power. I just am getting tired of seeing so many knives. I want someone to let loose with a claw hammer xD
---
What perks are those?
---
His videos are not all saved "which i thought he did" but if you stop by his stream and ask him his idea for chucky he'll repeat what you just said.
---
1200 hours. Not really new xD. I don't know how many hours you have but I've never heard someone talking about being "a healer" in this game. Also I don't know where all those BK fans comes from cause i kinda never see this perk to be used (at red ranks at least).
---
Numbah 4 has a bowl cut tho
---
If you wanna be a dick sure
---
While true, everyone is seeming to overlook that you'd have to focus on placing 5 individual suits of armor across the map, all while Survivors are actively trying to either hinder you by sabotaging your suits, or doing objectives because you are trying to set up.  
---
It will be a trade off between how much you want to stall for time, how much you want trap armor in places you need them, but also how much you want to risk not having a suit or armor where you need it when a survivor inevitably takes it out.  
---
Risk and reward.
---
You could easily pip with the additional kill it gifts you endgame....potentially more if you slug.  That is a very common scenario where maybe they have 1 dead and NOED gives them the 2nd kill they need to pip at mid or less ranks.
---
I'm surprised I haven't seen more people do the Mori with Ghostface to cancel it so it looks like he's humping them. I've done this so much and it's much more satisfying then a tbag.
---
Hopefully never until he is entirely reworked. The killer was a mistake and they belong in the bottom teir until they are reworked into something fun to play against.
---
Yeah it's a weak perk that's why every babykiller in game runs it throughout the ranks...
---
NOED is not "destroying the matchmaking of the game" or "boosting bad killers" matchmaking is ass and you just want to complain because you can't count to 5 and cleanse totems.
---
I can't play a game without Ruin XD
---
Have you never played any game like overwatch... 
---
The point is it would add variety and make it so you can just all be one survivor, it ruins immersion, it makes chases more confusing if survivors know what they are doing and it makes finding 4 survivors that are all super hard to see painful
---
And If I'm being entirely honest, Crusader could probably be a Hex. The tokens lock in if the totem is destroyed, but combine with this haunted grounds, and suddenly there's a risk to taking on that sparkling skull.
---
Did you read his reply? "Harm new players". They aren't going to have millions saved, and I am sure as hell not gonna play survivor if I can't play a character I bought with real money.
---
Sure I will just keep looking for lobbies without any Megs in it for 20 minutes.
---
One word... Ash
---
Thats the unreal engine 4 navigation mesh
---
Depends on the phone ig?There's no where else to get the game on mobile that I know of
---
or idk play someone else dumbass
---
Hex: Ruin Table.
---
A Hex that affects the table's ability to stay clean.
---
All drinks are affected by Ruin Table, which causes the following:
---
* Successful placement prevents 3/4/5 sweat rings on the tabletop
---
* Perfect placement results in no sweat rings on the tabletop
---
The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Coaster remains.
---
*"Boy you better put that damn cup on that coaster before I come in there and bea'cho ass!"*
---
The dunce perk should be the reskin of decisive strike.
---
I want to play Meg dumbass.
---
Hah, I'm laughing
---
i just wanted to make a joke man :(
---
FUCK NO DONT LET THAT SHIT GET TO YOU ITS JUST BIG TALK
---
Then that's your fault, maybe you shouldn't be such a stingy bitch
---
If I could upvote this 100 times I would mate
---
I think they mean change vampire lore they follow so it fits into dbd balanced.
---
Ikr? That's what I did when i saw this post.
---
Yeah fuck the players who bought a game and want to play a specific character. Even better when it's a dlc survivor.
---

Billy:Oh Myyyy God
---
I play huntress, I have spies from the shadows and unrelenting as my other perks, chases are very fast and patrolling gens isn‚Äôt too hard
---
We were both rank 9, which is quite decent after rank reset, so he should have some experience. I spawned next to his ruin (didn‚Äôt touch it) so he found me very quickly and went after me for the first 2-3 gens. Probably his mistake. Not the best billy, that‚Äôs for sure. Eventually he hooked me and went on to his next target and hooked him as well. I unhooked that guy and then after a little while the remaining gens finished. Had I known he would rage quit I‚Äôd sacrifice myself for the bp :(
---
Yup, fuck players who don't want variety and more diversed gameplay, I just want my sprint burst and adrenaline wahhh
---
You fools always die, stop crying and don't die for once, I can say this, because tunneling works Even on rank 8 and I always get complaints from survivors, that im a shit killer Even though i 4-3k every game.
---
The real joke is that you think Legion is good where he is
---
Dying light, a red mori, and noed
---
this mad lad just used "Ergo" while being clueless, god bless
---
I felt this in the bottom of my soul
---
The absolute goddamn worse is when they get a survivor trying to heal them, then run over to the totem while injured so the healer sees it too, and god dammit now I'm Mr. Wilson trying to keep four Dennis the Menaces away from my stuff
---
You're fine, dont worry about it too much, some people just like to talk shit. That wasnt camping.
---
Only a dumb person would think that.
---
Legion is trash, and he is gonna stay that way for a very,  very long time. Just suck it up.
---
EAC said they don't look for them if they were changed BHVR said they don't ban for it. It feels like they just can't officially state it's okay to do it and are pointing fingers so that you won't blame them. No one got banned for it so far afaik. Most streamers and many of my friends changed them.
---
The totem spawns in swamp completely destroy me each time
---
If your chases are very fast, and you're constantly finding yourself engaged with Survivors, then it sounds like you don't need to slow the game down further, you need to push survivors closer to Sacrifice faster. Obvious choices are Make Your Choice, Save The Best For Last, Infectious Fright, or possibly Sloppy Butcher to penalize your frequent injuries. But again, if you're having a great deal of success, that is the single best indicator or advice you can take to heart.
---
I'm sorry you went through this but this picture made my day
---
Same here with the ONLY EXCEPTION of when Myers released in 2016. That was probably one of the best times for me in dbd history
---
You should cry for this crime
---
Yeah instead of asking for change let me sit on my hands like some dumb ass, I bet you also think protesting is useless and that things will "eventually work out"
---
I love this holy shit
---
Your trash if you win or lose :/
---
I'll give you that but atleast Ash was fighting the undead with a chainsaw on his hand, he did make sense.
---
By my chases are fast I mean that when I do find a surv, they normally end up on a hook less than a minute later. It is a little difficult finding survs, but I find it a fun challenge
---
Only to buy licence killers. I buy everything else with shards. Survivors feel like they're nothing more than the perks they come with, so I haven't bothered buying any licencensed survivors.
---
Touche
---
Wraith is my big tiddie goth gf
---
I absolutely despise killers that kill me after messaging me that they‚Äôre farming that game
---
I mean they need content so
---
\&gt; *Lore*
---
Games are not meant only to be fun. We are slightly got over the concept of pong if you haven't noticed.
---
Games now can be competitive, introspective, story based, have a message etc
---
This game on it's core is competitive and if you wanna play a competitive team based game like a cuck do so but don't get offended when people will despise you and have the right to do so, since as I explained and you showed, you just care about yourself
---
If I were you I won't post any criticism about the game in the future if this is your mentality. You are part of the problem
---
Well I would get on Kate and Jane any time. And if Plague was in her before getting infected state.... I would do anything for having Ancient style orgy with her.
---
Her majestic walk and that long dead Akkadin language turns me on. But then you look on the bubonic plague eating her body and the magic is gone.
---
I said don't @ me
---
Is that why I never see her whenever I play as Survivor? üòÖ
---
Megalomania.
---
Good times.
---
Explain
---
Who would be the best? Should I buy her alone or buy the whole Chapter?
---
Yesss I love everything about this
---
What rank are you?
---
One person in this convo has extensive knwledge of the differences in playstyle and talent in the rank 1 pool between Console and PC and the other person is you. 
---
The fact that you think a 110% M1 cant be looped already shows you dont know what youre talking about. The one killer you cant loop is the Nurse (her counterplay is vastly different)
---
25
---
Meh it was decent, season 1 is 100 times better and season 2 didn't come close to season 1 but was still better then s3.
---
Shut up Meg
---
claudettes are toxic
---
Both
---
I feel like you were swinging for the fences with this.
---
No nurse is easy to counter
---
Hag and Freddy
---
Nurse is best.
---
Depends on what perks you like and if you like survivor. Look at Adams perks. I‚Äôm not a big fan of his perks, but some people like them.
---
I mean, you could have ignored my comment too lol 
---
And yeah, sure, that may be true, but people also feed into it a lot. Blizzard does a more fun job of it imo, I don‚Äôt tend to like the way dbd seems to do it and encourage people borderline stalking everyone‚Äôs moves on their social media down to going out of their way to figure out who people are following. To each their own.
---
No i mean your survivor rank. Like the number that's up in the top right of your lobby screen, that usually has 1 of a few shapes around it depending on your rank
---
I know it's a large part of the playerbase but it's so frustrating when low rank players refer to something as OP or not OP..
---
I main Detective Tapp as a Survivor. I might just get her alone. Her and maybe another Killer.
---
Anyone telling you Spies is trash hasn‚Äôt used it.
---
teach me your ways oh wise one
---
Wraith. Simply because most of them are walking around the hook even when all my teammates are working on gens.
---
well deserved
---
Yeah it's why freddy was placed in the garbage bin to begin with for about a year. I hate it too trust me. I'll help low ranks out regardless the side I'm playing but I was playing freddy for a daily a day before his rework went live and this rank 11 said he was op
---
Girls don't play vidya games!
---
The iridescent clapper and the common addon that hides your terror radius is a strong combo.
---
There may not be a bing bong, but it can be pretty effective.
---
Explain Myers on any MacMillan map.
---
She knew she was screwed she didn‚Äôt even try to jump in.
---
Step one uninstall dead by daylight
---
I'VE GIVEN UP ON GETTING THAT ACHIEVEMENT NOW THAT EGC HAS BEEN INTRODUCED. MAKES IT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN COMPLETE THE LAST GEN BEFORE KILLER KICKS HATCH. 
---
MIGHT HAVE TO GET A FRIEND TO HELP, EXIT AND JOIN LOBBY UNTIL YOU END UP IN THE SAME MATCH, THEN HAVE THEM KILL EVERYONE BUT YOU AND LET YOU ESCAPE. EZ PZ
---
Huntress and Wraith are way flavoured
---
I used to have this costume lol I thought I looked cool as hell, but looking at it like this.... ü§£
---
This would do a nice meme format tbh.
---
Man...fuck that Claudette in the ear!
---
XD never noticed
---
bruh
---
she was asking for hatch, there is no way to communicate in the game besides "teabagging" and pointing. it used to be that teabagging at a killer meant "farm?" and killers understood that. the community has gotten so toxic that it just always assumes the other is the devil incarnate, here to ruin their day.
---
To much, I have every dlc and most premium outfits.
---
Add bloodlust on top of that. Gotta love getting outplayed by 4heads.
---
After you get all the perks, at least. Which takes a long time with this many survivors.
---
Can you give me an example of their Perks?
---
I bet you never even played the Fame before bloodlust was a thing
---
probably around $130.
---
Nah still happens through red ranks.  Some players just suck.
---
I never said they were the same but they both reward people for doing nothing. I could be a claudette doing nothing all game and get the hatch or get a key from my bloodweb and get out for free, it's just a free escape. Egc is better at dealing with this now but nonetheless the point stands.
---
Won‚Äôt the killer know where the survivors are?
---
At this point it‚Äôs a killer perk
---
It doesn't take that long. I've unlocked everything  for survivor on Xbox One and PS4 and more than halfway through PC. They aren't all Prestige 3, but all the teachables are unlocked.
---
Yeah and then they tbag at the exit that they didnt earn.
---
I'm reworking some things
---
Ok well then the reason is that your not very high rank, as she's a killer that isn't very popluar at low to mid ranks due to her being rather hard to use.
---
Great. It takes other people a lot longer. I've only got Feng and Claudette done.
---
"Items found in chest have a 50% efficiency increase. You search chests 25% faster."
---
Finally, another perk for my pirate perk build
---
Makes sense!
---
I might be a bit uh... Biased, but I love this
---
which charter? stitches cause no it came out before hide or die
---
One is a core mechanic of the game the other a crutch perk you equip.  The only reason devs even changed it where the hatch spawns regardless is because killers have the massive edge of being able to permanently close it.  That was the concession they made to survivors to keep EGC from being viewed as a 100% Killer buff.   Your point does not stand because it was built on a flimsy house of cards to begin with.
---
I've also been playing for over 2 years too.
---
Bone Clapper &gt; Coxcombed Clapper don't @ me
---
Fair.
---
3 party streamers, survivor pudding and B&amp;C, it was beautiful
---
mostly BP‚Äôs but ig it could counter NOED
---
Entity: Am I a joke to you???
---
Scott as quickly as you go down when playing with zubat maybe you need to rethink your strategy. Elite loopers like usylis and noob don't need to heal but average survivors like most the playbase need to.
---
Then "it doesn't take that long" is a bit false then huh
---
People go overboard with farming. Had people wanting to farm for a long time, even had to to sacrifice people who didn't want to leave. IMO a good farm game is &lt;15 min survs should have 20k+ and killer is 30k.
---
You could see the icon for the luck offering so their chance was a little higher. Still at most it was about a 7% so...
---
As someone who does put the .ttv thing in their name, I don't understand why tf others that do can get so salty.
---
Like bruh I understand that regardless of how I play or act, I'm going to run into people both survivors and killers that see .ttv and try to cause problems. But it's my choice to put it anyways and I ain't going to start DCing, raging, etc. Because another dickhead decided it's time to tunnel, camp, pull out the mori, etc. Just to try and get a reaction, doesn't mean I should be giving them a reaction. Instead I just switch to killer and go at that for a bit until either I want to play survivor again or just get bored of killer.
---
Only thing I really do dislike personally is that you can just spam the mori start up and I believe stall bleed out a lot so the person getting that shit kinda has to DC or just sit there till the killer gets bored of it. Happened to me once and I just said some shit like, "Well alright then, I'll just do shit on my phone till this is over." Went on another like 15 seconds before the dude got bored I assume because I didn't give any actual reaction.
---
Not necessarily. I run Small game and let the party know I'll be hunting totems because especially at tank reset and higher ranks 9/10 times they have ruin and/or NOED.
---
Making myself the dedicated "totem hunter" allows for people to gen rush and loop while not having to worry about doing or even checking bones. 
---
Yes I said I notify them at the beginning because I don't play SWF.
---
Spirit fury is amazing on M1 killers when used with enduring, and hex: haunted grounds is amazing used alone or to protect ruin.
---
I had a spicy game where i killed 3 and closed the hatch. Last one teabagged me in the gate not realizing I had blood warden. I pretended to leave and saw them go behind one of the walls in there and just teabag. I went by the entrance with my stain facing the opposite way and was able to quickly turn in and down them before they could get out. Picked them up and inch from the exit and hooked them. It was oh so satisfying and all thanks the BW
---
It means they're probably streaming
---
I have a rework of this perk on the sub reddit.
---
I could get fucking steamrolled all match and as long as they aren‚Äôt assholes about it I‚Äôm good
---
I‚Äôve been hit after I got through the invisible entity gate and still lost my item, I feel you
---
Well kind of, the killer would have something called priority rules, so he can‚Äôt just patrol every gen and make it impossible to win, if he finds a survivor, he has to hit them before the killer can go do anything else. So survivors also need a sort of explanation, which I‚Äôm not sure about, being able to see the killer is very op in a board game. I was gonna make up a ‚Äúsight rule‚Äù but that seems stupid as nobody would follow it. Hmm this is tough.
---
I would say ghost face
---
&gt; I know it's for bloodpoints, or the possibility the killer is running NoED
---
That's it right there. 
---
If I cleanse a totem, that's one less spot for NOED to be. I'm cleansing on the off chance everyone else cleanses any totems they come across, and so when the last gen pops, the killer might lose NOED. 
---
When the exit gates are powered, there is almost nobody who's going to run around looking to see if NOED spawned. The survivors are running for the exit gates, because if the killer NOEDs me on the way out I have a better chance of escaping than if they NOED me while I'm by their totem
---
The people who suck at keeping track of time. Plus it's 2 minutes.
---
This hurts my soul. But on the bright side with the sudden resurgence of "Legion bad" memes Behavior might look into them again.
---
I mean it only took 2 years of "Freddy bad" memes for them to rework Freddy again. :)
---
Depends if I had fun. If survivors were at my skill level, not toxic fucks, if I'm pleased with my gameplay, on and on. If you sacrificed 3 that's good. usually one or another DC's, others escape the hatch you haven't even found, but that's okay, it happens.
---
No. You shouldn't assume and snow ignorance. 
---
It took a few months on Xbox One and PS4 and I just started playing on PC. I do take breaks from time to time. I already have the bloodpoints to upgrade the next survivor once they are released. Easy peezy.
---
yes stitches and It shows this post as having been posted 1 day ago? Lol
---
You can't tunnel me, I only play killer. √ú
---
Is the weapon racist or is he? Commas. They‚Äôre important.
---
I love to get pallet stunned while in the fatigue animation. It does nothing.
---
Maybe have it so when it‚Äôs the survivors turn to move the killer can‚Äôt look or something like that.
---
Turn the hunted into the hunterd!
---
It‚Äôs just a power move as a survivor when playing a bad nurse
---
That's true. Fun is why we play.
---
I kinda get pissy when I'm getting owned though. I may have hook camped once or twice because of this...
---
I genuinely can't tell if this is trolling or not.
---
If you put .ttv (or its many variants) in your username then you're not popular enough to be watched on stream. I've ran into OhTofu in a match and he was just going by "OhTofu", no "twitch.tv/OhTofu" or "OhTofu.ttv" or "OhTofu Twitch" or anything like that. It was only after the match (after Tofu didn't say anything in post-game chat beyond a GG) that one of my SWF allies learnt that it was actually OhTofu and we were on his Stream.
---
Every other major DBD Twitch Streamer just *plays the game.* No0b3 goes by some alt account names but the likes of Tru3, HybridPanda, Morph, etc. all just go by their regular names without taping ".ttv" to the end of it.
---
Perhaps it's hypocritical to point out that people who are already famous don't need to advertise, but these people didn't make an audience for themselves by using a .ttv username.
---
You‚Äôre right. First thing I do when I load in is find the 3 gen strategy and do one of them first. When I play killer I always try to protect the 3 gen strat and keep pressure on those 3 gens. It‚Äôs a great strategy for killers who don‚Äôt have gen pressure perks.
---
usually they tend to be potatoes and run into walls alot, but a few days ago i got in a game with a quentin and they destroyed me. wasnt toxic about it either, just really good.
---
Sometimes I slug freshly unhooked survivors and leave them down. What happens if the next time I hook them they're the last survivor left in the trial? The game just crashes?
---
Well yeah, but saying it like that wouldn't be as amusing
---
Thank you for the numerous copypastas.
---
A *knob* is a slang term for a dick. I use it quite a bit, especially when people don't know what it means :)
---
ITS THURSDAY AND THIS IS STILL UP WHY
---
20k + blood points and some fun chases. I really don‚Äôt care how many I kill it‚Äôs all about that bp and fun for me.
---
&gt;Tried sliding over the pallet and letting the killer grab me
---
That is actually usually how you fix it, it's just had to get the timing right. I was once playing against a farming Trapper (someone DCed really early on and the guy felt bad for us) and he got stuck in the pallet. We tried to have him grab us and eventually he managed to do so, to which all the Survivors did a butt dance while Trapper nodded vigorously to celebrate.
---
I'm considering adding it to my vocabulary haha
---
Hag because of her traps. It used to be Doctor for me but those traps are too much.
---
This is so fucking cursed but I laughed at it way more than I should've.
---
Excellent decision.
---
art work came out before the post i just posted it
---
I tell the Killer GG or nothing. If I don't have anything nice to say....
---
On another note...
---
Say I'm playing Killer, I usually play Survivor, to complete rituals, if I msg the survivors that that's all I'm doing, are they usually responsive to that?
---
Huh? What don't you agree with? 90% of the survivor playerbase cant loop for shit. They need to heal or they are negative assets going down in two seconds. What did I say that was wrong?
---
FUCK! I FINALLY FUCKING GOT DECENT AT THIS FUCKING GAME BUT I DID I DAYS BEFORE THE FUCKING RANK RESET AND NOW MY RANK 3 IS FUCKED. I FUCKING HATE MYSELF FOR TRYING TO RANK UP AT THE LAST MOMENT EVERY FUCKING TIME!
---
Not only that, it‚Äôs a common enough name that has a specific enough meaning that it‚Äôs as if you saw someone with MLG in their name and you can‚Äôt help but think bad thoughts about them if they‚Äôre good or bad. Trust me, I made this name as a joke and people on Reddit and in games will constantly say how I‚Äôm a shittier than normal  human being simply for my name.
---
Perks that give survivors multiple chances have been OP and nerfed (Decisive strike, Mettle of man) this would make for another OP perk. I understand your trying to make up for killers waiting out the 1 min timer, but they really shouldn't be punished for you team doing unsafe unhooks
---
It's still funny because it feels faster than the stun animation without enduring.
---
Killer mains become serial killers and Survivor mains become technicians. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø &gt;!Unless you forget to run Technician. Then you're just a regular dude.!&lt;
---
Pretty much any game that isn't on Haddonfield, Yamaoka Estate or Swamp.
---
I'd still get hit at that point
---
Whether i did or didn't  does not matter. BL is a shit mechanic and most ppl who play this game can agree. Sure there are some bullshit loops and windows in the game, but who wants to waste 45 seconds to get BL 3 when you can put pressure on someone else? If ppl wants to hump irionwork window all game, go ahead have fun, im gonna go slaughter the rest of your team in the meanwhile and let EGC decide whether you get out or not.
---
Idk why you dicked me in particular for no real reason.
---
MM. He can be countered, but can also be an effective killer. Hes the most dependent on everyone in the games skills.
---
I have said YEARS ago that Killers should physically bump Survivors out of their way on collision. There is no reason gameplay-wise for Survivors to be able to bodyblock unless it's for cheese, and a giant murderer should be able to shove even Ash out of his way.
---
It's somehow rare, but don't be afraid to use it! More will come eventually
---
It's because she's eating the corn
---
 Their immediately sacrificed
---
Oh boy. I just discovered another way to stack up on Save the Best for Last.
---
Run Backpack build
---
Down Obsession
---
Run down the other survivors and stack up 
---
???
---
Profit ?

I argue it's not hostage but a killer can force out a 3-gen if they defend it more vigorously. I'm a former doctor main (Who used the 3-gen build all the time) and my first action when spawning (often during the camera spin) was to find which 3 gens were the closest together to be my 3-gen. 
---
Killers can definitely 3-gen from the start but I still don't think it's hostage.
---
Doctor just annoys me. The devs made him even more annoying with that stupid damn sound effect that happens when you get shocked now
---
So you would intentionally ruin someone else experience of their hobby all because of their name ? Interesting.
---
Exactly, Myers and Ghostface can take a bit of time getting instadowns. Why people find NOED contradictory on them is beyond me i guess.
---
people who act like this and use every scumbag trick they can are the same ones that complain when survivors reciprocate.
---
Sorry for the bad recording, had to take a screen capture of my screen capture due to Reddit video upload format rejection
---
I got in a previous discussion thinking you could hear and see corn/brush movement with the Spirit phasing. Turns out you can hear the corn/brush move, but no, the corn and brush do not move. 
---
The weird thing is, they don‚Äôt move for any killer right now (at least the 3 I tested). You can see the corn clipping through Spirit even when she is not phasing. 
---
Not sure if this is a bug or the way it is going to be from now on.
---
you wont be able to use your perks though sadly
---
So the survivors make their move, take their pieces off, then the killer moves but he hasn‚Äôt seen the killer, this would also work for the survivors. And if the killer gets line of sight on a survivor then a chase starts, killer doesn‚Äôt remove his piece. But the non chase survivors do. K, thank you that was a great idea.
---
How come the don't have this for survivors?
---
Literally the only times I ever play with Zubat we are either trying to actively kill each other or I am suiciding to do DS Head on combos. Its the only thing we find fun anymore. You're not legit gauging my gameplay off of that are you
---
Yes and it‚Äôs the fucking worst. I don‚Äôt even get an opportunity to mash for more points. You get heavily punished for being the last one alive getting hooked.
---
More like when you‚Äôre playing survivor and nobody can find ruin so 1 gen gets done in a 10 minute game, then you switch to killer and survivors spawn on your ruin.
---
FUCKING LOOK BEHIND WHILE BEING CHASED, DON'T FUCKING WAIT AT PALLETS TO FUCKING THROW THEM AT THR KILLER, TRY TO LOOP HIM AROUND AND ALSO USE FUCKING WINDOWS! ALWAYS DO GENERATORS AND DON'T HIDE LIKE A CUNT WHEN YOU HEAR THE FUCKING TERROR RADIUS FOR 1 FUCKING MILLISECOND! PRACTICE MAKES FUCKING PERFECT THO SO KEEP TRYING. I'D ALSO SUGGEST TO WATCH HOW POPULAR DBD YOUTUBERS FUCKING PLAY THE GAME AND REMEMBER TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS WHENEVER YOU CAN BECAUSE IT'S MORE FUCKING FUN AND YOU'LL LEARN A LOT MORE FUCKING THINGS!
---
At least no mither and saboteur can complement each other (since you can force the killer to slug you with good sabos)
---
Please banish yourself from this realm immediately.
---
what rank
---
This is REALLY good man
---
The killer or myself?
---
I always do this when someone dc‚Äôs. I feel bad since I feel it makes solo players not want to play when their team puts them in a very un-winnable/un-fun situation.
---
Pretty good JOB so far
---
I mean, why? 
---
There is nothing wrong with streaming your gameplay, they aren't doing anything bad. I don't see the reason to tunnel them.
---
because having a killer who not only gets a free hit but who would go faster then any other killer that would brake the game in a bad way 120% is a crazy amount of speed and if you want prof go back in time from when myers came out PWYF was insane and they nerfed that killers are balanced around going 115% you can't and shouldn't go any faster then that outside of perks and powers
---
Nurse and Huntress irritate me but I used to main Doctor. A 3-gen Doc is probably the most irritating thing to face because the round lasts forever and if he has a good 3-gen progress is nearly impossible if he's playing defensively.
---
Accept when you weren't able to a catch anyone in ironworks before BL because all they had to do is lithe/sprint burst/balanced landing away towards the one window and you were fucked
---
Thats a good strategy especially because, at least in my games, the othet survivors rarely grab totems
---
Just uploaded the video in a new post.

---
You can hear the corn move. It doesn‚Äôt move though. I noticed this first as killer that when I was Phasing, I could hear the different crunching noises when I moved through different ground.
---
YEAH DUDE JUST FINALLY GOT TO RANK 3 FOR MY FUCKING FIRST TIME AND GOT RESET A FEW DAYS AFTER! FUCK RANK RESET!
---
They're even more important when helping your uncle, Jack, off a horse
---
THATS WHY I PLAYED SELF CENTERED TOWARDS OTHER SWFS IF I DON‚ÄôT THINK THEY‚ÄôLL HELP ME WHEN IN NEED, BECAUSE I KNEW THEY‚ÄôLL GO FOR EACH OTHER. IF THEY TREAT ME AS AN EQUAL THEN I‚ÄôLL HAPPILY GIVE MY LIFE TO SAVE THEM
---
Because survivors are just essentially skins, there is not one thing one can do that all others can't, btw cloudetts invis bs doesn't count
---
Wraith and Clown
---
Ghostface. I just... I just always die. I can never hear him coming.
---
you cant instant jump threw hatch it takes 1 second  she knew she was being toxic from what i saw
---
I never get this. If anything, I just get salty killers who can‚Äôt get the last survivor or survivors fighting with each other in the post chat
---
Updoot for mao mao template
---
Nani mode?
---
It could be alot better. There are small details I could have added.
---
YEAH FUCK RANK RESET! JUST GOT TO RANK 3 FOR MY FIRST FUCKING TIME AND GOT RESET! FUCK IT!
---
There really shouldn't be one concrete answer. The killers are designed to play to your strengths. When I play killer I main Myers, Freddy and the Spirit. Those, to me, balance out with my skill level.
---
No one DCs
---
also its up to your views of toxicity pointing is a better sign of asking for hatch and why give people hatch your job is to kill theirs only 1 team winning in that situation
---
Gruesome, I love it!
---
YEAH YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT, IT'S THE RESCUER'S FUCKING FAULT!
---
Dont chase them then lmao.
---
Just because someone asks for something doesn‚Äôt mean you have to give it to them, that‚Äôs not what I said. Please don‚Äôt go and twist my words to fit your narrative.
---
Well you have no control of your selfish teammates actions, and it's not fair.
---
its based on internet connection and animations of swings the math in the game adds up always so if it hits you you should have got hit anyways but unless they have bad internet
---
I never care enough to. 
---
I will snipe people with keys, though. &gt;:(
---
Hag is slightly better than the pig, but there‚Äôs no way she is a high tier killer. She‚Äôs very easily countered, which is why you see so few in high rank games.
---
got to appreciate a shameless plug üòÇ
---
Counterbalance the killer also gets a gun and turns into the glocktor
---
Shhhhh, don‚Äôt tell them that!
---
Why is there a, random comma in that caption
---
Repost
---
quite a take. have you considered maybe theres no need for a big streamer to advertise themselves when they're already well known in the community?
---
Hooks and stuff? Taken at night? Man for a quick pic this is great
---
I‚Äôve never read such a wrong comment before
---
Really? Sorry if it is. I shouldve checked before hand
---
Huzzah! A man of quality!
---
Depends if you are going for DC‚Äôs. If you want DC‚Äôs, 5 blink is way better. 
---
If you are going for kills, then you are playing Nurse and you don‚Äôt need addons.
---
Somehow Ghostface looks simultaneously confused about the situation and disappointed at the totem spawn.
---
I‚Äôm a new player and I frequently get messages from survivors telling me how much I suck. Some people just like to be jerks.
---
I was at the exit gate yesterday. Doctor found me. Last man left. I kept pointing at the gate. I was trying to open it. He kept shocking me, and I couldn't open the gate. At that point, I thought the killer would let me live. He was toying with me :) 
---
I was dying
---
Lol yet teabagging is crucified in this sub. You have bigger issues if you thinking someone pressing control rapidly is survivor 'toxicity'. Theres toxicity on both sides, i dont have to play by your made up etiquette.
---
Rank 13 is not low. It might be for neckbeards like yourself but for the average normal human it‚Äôs quite difficult.
---
Maybe because survivors are mainly a skin and you can get other survivor's perks in the shrine
---
As much as I still somehow like this game and occasionally enjoy it I feel like I must be real here for a second... truth is, this game isn't and will never be "properly balanced". There's way too many "crutch" perks on both sides (specially on the survivors side) that make the game more frustrating than fun.
---
I've been playing other games, you should do the same if you're having a hard time taking any enjoyment out of the game.
---
I just finished (platinum) Days Gone yesterday and I'm ready to try any of the couple dozen unplayed games I have on Steam and on the PS4. Play something different, try something better. Dead by Daylight is great on paper, but gameplay and balance wise is still a mediocre game at best. That's my opinion for what it's worth, my $0.02.
---
Regression penalties mean that if they fail a skill check it sets back the progress more, I believe
---
btw guys I got him again and he really likes me ig since he couldn't stick around basement he trapped all around me and stood in front of me swinging his weapon...fun
---
Found the guy who still uses DS instead of something more useful.
---
Yes sir! Take my upvote. I always tell people when I stream "if you play SWF you didn't get your rank...you were carried there"
---
Its not a repost. But yeah it might be late. Why you gotta hate?
---
If the survivors are good sports and are happy in the chat, then even no kills is good. 
---
I would say any game greater than 25k base points (without including BBQ or any offerings) is a good match.
---
She was playing along.
---
JUST SAY "I KILLED HIM"
---
From the survivor side I can tell people can be jerks but I promise each match you'll  get better üòä I'm cheering you on!
---
Same way they did Bill. Bill dies in L4D and they work it into the lore that he doesn‚Äôt actually die, the entity takes him. 
---
I personally believe Hopper will be alive in season 4, but DBD isn‚Äôt cannon so they could just say the entity took him too.
---
Also Steve better be the survivor
---
Its true we always need more cowbell.
---
Atleast you're willing to admit that you're point is hypocritical and based on literally no argument whatsoever.
---
I also enjoy doing this, especially when I'm playing Killer. It gives me a solid idea of how I played and how a survivor thinks/reacts to me. I also enjoy popping into channels pre-game to say hello, pause and minimize the stream to avoid temptation, and then return to see how things went from their perspective. It's very educational and enlightening.
---
That laugh the doctor has when he lands his shock therapy gets me every time.
---
its so you can entertain their viewers :)
---
xXxUseless_Shart420
---
head ons activation time should be reduced
---
&gt;even on PS4.
---
found your problem chief
---
She‚Äôs definitely worth it she‚Äôs fun to learn and play mind games. Hell if you wanted you could buy her with 9000 shards I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it, I find it pretty petty of some ppl even more so when they say how toxic they can be but your doing something toxic yourself.
---
Yeah but bbq
---
Yeah, you can. I'm at 3990 though :(
---
For support class I‚Äôd say swap No One Left Behind with We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever. You still get blood points (and arguably at a more reliable rate) but also fit the theme of the build since it‚Äôs about rescuing and protecting the other survivors to get those tokens.
---
that is really lame
---
not that hatch thing either, just the way you said it
---
Bone clapper + Blink addons.    
---
Problem solved.
---
Hex: Ruined
---
This actually crossed my mind! And now that you say it, definitely seems like the best option!
---
You aren't my supervisor!
