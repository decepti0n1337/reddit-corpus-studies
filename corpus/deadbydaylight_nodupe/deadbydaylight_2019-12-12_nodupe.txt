Where can I learn this power?
---
---
---
I was referring specifically to when you step on them while patrolling, not in the chase
---

---
If it's hidden well enough, and I'm focusing on something else, I may step on a trap. The only time I step on the traps really.
---
I think somewhere in the Lore it says some killers have to be tortured to do what the Entity wants them to do, but eventually they all give in.
---
Andrenaline is yin and Noed is the yang both polar opposite of each other , if all the gens are done that means you won and the killer lost .if the killer gets some hooks from it that fine since you most probably piped unless you weren‚Äôt doing anything the whole games , the perk Noed exists for killers to get a brutal in the end or for new killers who don‚Äôt know much about the game or don‚Äôt have good perks ,in  high ranks it‚Äôs a very high chance they cleanse all totems yeah it may seem scummy to you that Noed is a thing but the same point of view is for killers when survivor uses ds when we don‚Äôt tunnel them right after ( in 60 seconds we can get a down and a hook not necessary tunneling the person) so stop complaining and get used to it or if you have trouble kill them totems .

Stab stab motherstabber

I agree with you on the old mettle of man, but nerfing it to 3 protection hits just doesn‚Äôt work and BhVR knows this and don‚Äôt care. During the PTB for it when they had 3 safe unhooks or 3 protection hits was perfect and I agreed to it and then upon the official drop of the rework BhVR at the last min nerfed it to the 3 protection hit bs state that it is now. They claim they fixed the protection hit system but it still doesn‚Äôt work as of now and mettle of man is a dumpster fire of a perk and ash has 3 perks that are all garbage. Then they state oh you can use it twice now and I wanna see the devs in a live game get it to work 2 times without being tunneled into the ground because you are visible to the killer and your also not throwing the game!
---
The aura idea isn't bad, I could see that as a brown/yellow add-on. I don't think trapper should be immune to his own traps though. If someone deadhards over it, you frankly got outplayed.

Ditto
---
Fucking ugly ass pussy fucking dumb looking nerdy developers
---
Iredescent Motor would just promote camping as it would negate BT
---
Yeah, I feel like most people would agree that its status on that PTB was ideal
---
See I don‚Äôt mind the cosplay. I get pissed when I open up my feed and see 50 posts of the same thing. 
---
And the challenges were a good idea, just implemented improperly. Killer specific challenges are lame as hell. I loved playing against trappers all day. 
---
But that was still more fun compared to stealth killers every match.
---
Well then you don‚Äôt know how to read.
---
My friend just threw me into the game saying "Just follow me lead!" not telling me what skill checks were or anything.
---
So I just blew up the generator for like three times until he told me what the skill check timer was.
---
It‚Äôs just an artwork, it has nothing to do with any of that except to show off the skins. Besides they said they don‚Äôt want to make any alternate modes because they don‚Äôt want to split up the queues any further
---
Chill dude
---
The other day I got genrushed hard.
---
* I was about rank 18 with the bubba offering, so no perks or add ons
---
* The queue was so long I didn't even realize the game had started until 2 gens were done
---
* The other survivors were green ranks
---
Some asshole was like "that genrush though" and another survivor just told him "dude, he had no perks or add ons and is a much lower rank, of course gens are going to be easy"
---
It was nice to see someone to stand up for the killer even if what he said wasn't even that mean
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Having never escaped after trying many times in the past, it shocked the hell out of me.
---
This is what 2000+ hours on bubba look like
---
And the fact that you were right next to the hatch has my eyes boggling üòÇ
---
I always seem to be hit or miss with Hag. I love her but I always seem to stomp or be stomped with her, not much in between :(
---
Weird. I play on Xbox and I dont get frame issues with nurse.
---
Unbreakable works once, and you have to be left alone for it. Decisive also works once, but there is no counter to it.
---
Uhm, If your tunnelling everybody doesn‚Äôt that mean your not tunnelling ?
---
Sometimes I see "GG everyone, except (other survivor)"
---
I mean why would you use an ultra rare add-on to camp when you could just use insidious?
---
Mostly had this in mind for the hill billy though, it would make him a hell of a lot scarier if he just popped out of nowhere and sawed you
---
Lol I think they meant to say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never too late with Oni. Don‚Äôt give up‚Äù
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/101918/xbox-patch-notes-3-3-2-hotfix
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused The Nightmare not to lose Bloodlust when placing a Dream Snare while in a chase.
---
This is only included in the 3.3.2 patch notes for XBOX and PS4, so I assume on PC this had already been the case before.
---
Survivors: This game is totally killer favored!   
---
Killers: \*Slowly becoming weaker and weaker with each patch\*
---
What happened?? I haven‚Äôt played in a couple days.
---
For some reason I imagine that pencil to be shit quality :D
---
You can never hear the almighty scratched mirror Myers
---
So? It came out on Discord; anything would die there. And that's not even the point.
---
Basically just choose something and chase the shit out of them till they die
---
Leatherface; Am i a joke to you?
---
They needed Oni's flick so now it's like trying to steer a semi in a 2 lane road, he's practically dead now RIP.
---
BBQ, Ruin, PGTW, and Thrilling Tremors is my go to Freddy build. A lot of people sleep on Thrilling Tremors because of the cooldown and the general ‚Äúdiscount BBQ‚Äù feel of the perk, but I find its work well on Freddy, I don‚Äôt see myself removing it from the build anytime soon
---
I understand this. I actually really like tru3 and agree with him on most things about this game. Thing is, i dont understand the hate just because he has an unpopular opinion. Like i dont agree with most of what scott jund says, but im not petty enough to spew all kinds of hate just because me and him have different opinions about a game with both enjoy.
---
It's a given with this sub reddit, I get downvoted here all the time
---
GG POS
---
What I meant was how can you tunnel all 4 players?
---
Ah
---
If you let the Survivors fight back, you'd end up with something like Last Year.
---
...which actually sounds fun, but Last Year doesn't have Ash or Bill to turn that completely one-sided.
---
Supposedly the flick was a bug, it was never intended to be part of his kit, at least thats what I‚Äôve seen people saying.
---
And yet she gets beaten half to death by pallets and can't sneak up on anyone.
---
Its just a skin man. No reason to have a shit time because somebody has pink hair.
---
No mither is better. But Oni counters it it‚Äôs just Unbreakable multiple times, the drawback. Exposed status effects don‚Äôt do anything. Go for haunted grounds than go for a chase they waste their perk to chase an injured survivor. Without Oni No mither, Iron will, D-strike, and sprint burst/dead hard is the Combo to go.
---
It was a led pencil that you can get in a 50 pack at Walmart for $5.00, I don't expect it to be top tier lol.
---
Or they could make it less grindy.
---
Yeah I just call them infinites because let's be real they might as well be.
---
Made myself not buy this dlc straight away, glad I waited honestly, I‚Äôll just wait for nemesis in the shrine.
---
Forever Freddy is fucking dead!!!!
---
Guess tacos is the winner since only one that posted XD.
---
Trapper's ki control has reached dangerous levels.
---
Didn‚Äôt play against oni enough to really have an opinion on the changes.  The matches I had against him though I didn‚Äôt feel like he was OP.
---
It's literally the same, even the flick at the end is worse now on console although a lot less drastic.  In no sense did console oni get buffed. And don't forget the addon nerf which affects everyone
---
NGL it's funny as hell to see the trappers get caught in their own traps
---
It was, but then BhVR in their idiotic ‚ÄúGood Job So Far‚Äù mentality turned a OP perk into a pile of shit perk and it was them mostly listening to the crybaby‚Äôs who hated MoM. So they buried it and then they slap the community in the face with the ‚Äúyou can use it twice tweet‚Äù 
---
BhVR is nothing but a trash dev company who has a bunch of unqualified coders and piss poor management who for the past few months have looked like they are out for a cash grab. Love the game allot but BhVR Interactive just ain‚Äôt cutting it for a video game developer and I wish the game was with a different company...
---
I'm good. I guess I just kind of have a knack for focusing on problems rather than appreciating the good things..or something..? I dunno. But I can assure you I'm fine.
---
Well, Last Year is out now. People have somewhere to move to, so it's really the devs' problem if they can't make DbD fun for everyone.
---
Agree completely.
---
Not a bad idea, but splitting the player base would cause the queue times to go up.
---
My guy to skinny for such thing
---
Just make SWFs not be allowed to stack perks.
---
Bamboozled
---
I disagree entirely. If you really know where to trap and how to trap, neither of those things are problems.
---
I played Survivor and the two that died first messaged me saying I'm a trash player.
---
Like what, you're dead.
---
&gt;This isn't a debate on whether DBD does or doesn't have the player base to support a Casual and Ranked gamemode.
---
I personally think if DBD goes cross platform, then this would be a very viable concept.
---
Yes your 5$ will be the deciding amount to nerf killers.
---
So how long will the sweaters be available? Only for a limited time?
---
Not at full power though. Like 1% good regression with no pause and -1% from great checks.
---
They run it bc it's a perk that's easy to stack and does something useful
---
You said it denies the ability to apply pressure which I stated isn't the case for me demonstrably. I see no confusion here.
---
someone‚Äôs using otzcheats.com
---
Because they're entitled dicks.

---
So you get Bloodlust every 5 seconds?
---
And the stacks are only lost when you *down* a survivor, but not *injure* them
---
And getting a grab doesnt reduce stacks.
---
So basically as long as Legion ends each chase with a window or pallet grab, they can run around with 130% movement speed for the whole game?
---
You know you're doing something right when you're the one scaring ghost face
---
"Michael can no longer Stalk."
---
Is that an original perk or do I need to get that from another killer etc ?
---
They already sold the killer. Now they can nerf him and make him useless
---
I miss 10 seconds ago when I didnt know this existed
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing this as well as getting robbed on window grabs and the gen grab animation being interrupted
---
"You slug for the 4k" the game is already over, it doesn't really matter what I bring at that point
---
Is this intended?
---
He moves at 110% speed. He will receive only 10% buff speed. Which leads to him having 5% bonus speed
---
THE SCP HAS ESCAPED ITS CONTAINMENT, I REPEAT BUBBA HAS ESCAPED HIS CONTAINMENT
---
Strongly disagree as no Mither means you go down easier and the killer definitely will never slug you.
---
Aight vibe with me, trapper should be immune to his traps
---
More like David, Tapp, Bill, and Ash. 
---
Fighter, Cop, Zombie killin, self sacrificing badass, and Puppet wearing evil stomping old man.
---
How was The Oni nerfed? I didn't realise. It's annoying either way because he seemed very strong but not OP as he was while The Spirit is still broken as fuck even after apparently being nerfed. Iron Will is the only thing that takes the edge off of her and even then it's near hopeless. Even Urban Evasion seems useless against her.
---
Bucket head is the shit
---
Wow... This meme is particularly bad.
---
Oh for the love of god I could only hope
---
Cross platform DBD would be miserable for console players.
---
It's been acknowledged, but in a different game by different devs.
---
Last Year aside, I think it's just because Killer is the best BP at lower ranks, discouraging Survivor plays, but SWFs are matched to their highest teammate, making them more common at higher ranks.
---
Last Year aside, I think it's just because Killer is the best BP at lower ranks, discouraging Survivor plays, but SWFs are matched to their highest teammate, making them more common at higher ranks. If it's gotten worse lately though, IDK.
---
i prefer gaggy daddy but whatever works for you
---
It's a plague perk
---
Wow, those are some pretty big nerfs for Freddy's addons. Outdoor Rope is now literally useless. Seems a bit overboard.
---
As a console player, if the Dev's increased the base sensitivity, and did other small console QOL improvements, I think cross platform would be fine.
---
That would work. It won't silence Oni entirely, but it will make is arrival much more sudden.
---
This tweet didn‚Äôt age well lad. The big boy barely has a flick anymore PeepoSad
---
They will stay and price has never changed on a item
---
It‚Äôs not a nerf only a small change to his red add on
---
Yea I was thinking of getting Pop Goes the Weasel since it‚Äôs on the shrine.
---
See Im weird. I do well as him, no matter what rank Im at. Yet I struggle when I play Michael.
---
Not sure. I‚Äôve been checking patch notes but no dice. Maybe a bug
---
LAMP
---
Once someone started shitting at me and his argument was "lmao rank 9 with ruin? Lol scrub"
---
He had sprint burst self care decisive and urban
---
Who would win. Ghost Face or A Urban Evading Blendette
---
calm down the person im repying to said you can't punish bad positioning and I was just saying that you still can.
---
Also if you don't charge the attack all the way, you have full control over the 1 hit down, you just don't get the lunge he does with it.
---
I really, really like the hair.
---
You failed remarkably
---
Chef Demogorgon skin when?
---
it was a kyf, i havent seen one in forever
---
As stated nothing changed for console players as Oni couldn't move or flick at all so yeah Oni is basically the same
---
It's kind of a slap in the face that any base character's perks show up there.
---
Pig patch notes:
---
Pigs terror radius is now increased while crouched 
---
Tentatively fixed an issue that causes pigs to injure survivors 
---
Adjusted Amanda‚Äôs letter addon- now slightly lowers her movement speed and increases aura reading by 1 meter
---
But then why didn‚Äôt remove nerf it when it was moved to live servers instead of just nerfing it.
---
you right
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs really annoying. when the game was first created that downside existed because survivors didn‚Äôt have the capabilities they have now. The fact that a detriment only fit for the meta of days gone, really shows that trapper just hasn‚Äôt been reworked for modern gameplay.
---
Didn't mean to be rude or anything. Just reminded me of pencils I had as a child that would feel awful on paper :d
---
My friend what else can you expect? It does say you're playing DBD Special Ed. That's the kinda people you play with unfortunately
---
Just played a game with new oni on ps4 and he is easier to control. I was also on rotten fields for the first time since I've only played like 4 games with him since I just got titanfall 2 and 2 of those matches where on Hawkins so..
---
I use a controller and It feels no different
---
Oh, I didn't interpret it as rude at all! I was just explaining where I got them, sorry if my point didn't come across clear. 
---
Also, I bet it was SchoolSmart. Those suck, man.
---
Gotta do your 10,000 hours for mastery!!
---
Thanks! It was definitely the hardest part without a reference. Who knew Claudette's hair was mostly covered by her beret?
---
Remove pig's ability to interact with survivors, a la old nightmare without power. Her ability to do get a kill every few games, so of course it needs removed. They're also going to make it so legions feral frenzy takes an extra four times longer to injure you instead of downing, as it now no longer injures you.
---
I wish u could see devotion of other survivors in the lobby. I want to represent my devotion 6 on ps4.
---
Slugging for a 4k isn't exclusive to the end of the match, but I see how you took it that way.
---
Only on Xbox
---
Good job that's pretty impressive
---
Unrelenting is so fucking bad I keep forgetting it's a perk.
---
Because that is what people mean when they say "slugging for the 4k" because otherwise you're just slugging to chase another survivor.
---
I also understand why people dislike the perk. And I understand why it's not always beneficial (though it does have it's uses, particularly towards endgame).
---
BUT... He's not just ranting. He's literally insulting a specific person. This isn't a "Man, I wish people would learn to not use this perk, it's a trap. What can we do to make it better / teach them better?"  This is a "Fuck this guy for ruining my game because he didn't play the way I wanted to! He's so horrible!"
---
And you're defending him.
---
[removed]
---
I do t prestige any of my killers either FWIW.
---
this is the shitty part of this page. What is the point of this post? To bully?
---
With how tiny the map is it should be a bit darker imo
---
Oh, ok. The only way to send a message via switch is to change your name to something like ‚ÄúcampinPOS‚Äù and send them an invite.  Lol
---
Unless you want the cosmetic then no.
---
sometimes this page feels like a bully simulator
---
I still do it, fuck 'em.
---
I won't lie enjoying it way more than I do dbd currently
---
A little late for that
---
As in I'm waiting at the very edge of the exit gate so if he downs me I flop into the escape, and want to give him a free hit but he doesn't get it and just thinks I want him to follow me into the escape. So he doesn't hit me. And I have to leave. It's all very emotional.
---
Nurse is so shafted on console the only nurses I have ever played against have been clearly just trying to get their dailys done. I dont think console nurse mains exist. At least not where I live.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll for sure try that. I figured that was a good way to do it.
---
some people get way too angry w pixels on a screen
---
How is bond compared to other team aura perks, such as kindred and empathy?
---
It is pretty unfair for them. That's the point of a hex totem, they can cripple entire teams. The price of them being that strong is that their permanency is limited.
---
So just a bit translates to less than 8 seconds roughly, gotcha.
---
Console nurse? Fine, nobody invested time with her anyways. Console huntress? If they change it i'll be pissed. I've gone through blood, sweat, and tears trying to master this shit.
---
Me as a survivor: Please not the estate, please not the estate.
---
Me as a killer: Please not  Sanctum, please not sanctum!
---
Bro there's like 4 pallets on the whole map
---
Me too
---
I mean it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be rank 16 either
---
I would rather be you. I get it at least twice a day and it's always a shit show
---
can we also ban posts that look like they were filmed w a potato? every single platform has a means of properly recording a match why do we still allow low effort garbage
---
Just got it, God it‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm not even paying attention to terror radius anymore. What‚Äôs a good aura perk? I‚Äôm enjoying using Kindred when it triggers, it‚Äôs helping me be altruistic. But, empathy gives me a good idea of where a chase is happening.
---
If the devs continue to support the game I think it may actually do well.
---
Yamoka:Good for killer, bad for survivor.
---
Sanctum:Acceptable for survivors. Bad for killer
---
For me it‚Äôs the inverse. I do much better on Sanctum as killer
---
Same I get a killer lobby instantly but survivor takes forever
---
He wrecks face with yellow addon's too, though...
---
While bond does have a shorter range than the others, it can be used at any time, not just when someone is hooked or injured. Dont get me wrong though, the other perks are still good. I mainly use bond when solo-queing, to know what I should be doing in any given moment, whether that is doing gens or saving someone from hook.
---
Nice to know that big is still in the game.
---
What is your favourite of those? I‚Äôm running kindred, DS, and spine chill right now. I gamed for a few hours straight, didn‚Äôt even get to use DS, because all the info I was getting let me hide right away. I‚Äôm not at level 15 with my Claudette yet, super new lol
---
Damn didn't even get to play him yet but I bought him. Wish I could refund considering I see people saying it hit him hard.
---
I mean, dcing late game doesn't change all that much tbh.
---
All I can imagine is that image of trapper naked cowering in a corner with jake standing over him with a flashlight
---
*sings a sad lullaby in PS4 Huntress main*
---
I have only Kobe'd like 4 or 5 times.
---
One of the times I was in the basement and was able to get off save a friend and get out only to die a few minutes later, a few I ended up escaping.
---
BW should affect the hatch too
---
I like bond, it's not the best at anything, but it can do a bit of everything. Chase near you? You'll see it and can avoid getting in the way or you can go tank a hit if you're a brave boy. Someone on a gen or needs healing close by? You'll see that too, and spine chill will tell you how safe it is to go lend a hand.
---
That‚Äôs the same exact thing.
---
Does kindred not give you that perfect information when you need it? From what I‚Äôve seen, the moment that I need to know what to do is when there‚Äôs a hook. Plus, camping. I guess I‚Äôll stick with kindred until I build rank, just because there‚Äôs lots of camping.
---
No problem.
---
Really? I've seen nothing but complaints from killer mains about how dark it is and with its large size. I played 1 game and came to agree
---
I would have just tried to boop the snoot at this point. worth being hooked in the basement again tbh.
---
I double-tap crouch as a "thank you" for healing me.

It‚Äôs dark? Huh I haven‚Äôt messed with my visual settings so I guess it‚Äôs my vision. ( I had lasik eye surgery and I got really good vision from it, even at night). But Yamaoka Estate is just big and cluttered with a bunch of random shit everywhere, Sanctum at least has some open space.

I was depleting Keys for the tome challenge and didn‚Äôt have any green so why not
---
yeah the annoying thing about the trap thing is they hit you if you move immeadiately, if you wait 1-2 seconds they dont...its ass about backwards

As someone who has also played against PC players with a controller, it isn't that deep. I alre said that I'm not arguing about player base.
---
I've been having fun with Dark Devotion + Nemesis. It's amazing how many people are oblivious to the big, stomping samurai coming their way from the open, just because there's no heartbeat.
---
What's silly is that it's in the video but I guess nobody bothered to watch before asking.
---
I tried telling everyone to wait to spend their money before getting the DLC since the killer / killer perks / survivor perks were all gonna be nerfed anyway so don‚Äôt waste ur money. don‚Äôt want another MoM moment
---
I do too. Just not every single match back to back to back to back repeating forever until you use a map offering.
---
I love the sweaters so much!
---
That's it. I just love them. They look beautiful.
---
You are capable of turning that much, but the actual turn angle of his power is only like 30%. If you watch slow motion, you turn only a super small amount at first, then turn the last like 120¬∞ in a very short amount of time. This means that you overshoot the edge of the loop and anyone hugging it doesn't get hit. Scott Jund posted a picture illustrating it on his Twitter
---
Lol same I literally just had a match where im red rank there were ranks: 15, 10, 5 vs a 8 killer. We escaped somehow üòÇ (might‚Äôve had to do with an over powered jungle gym spawn) 
---
But the ranks almost mean nothing right now. Its just how lucky u get with killers
---
Until they fix the hatch punishing killers for...killing, i will always tunnel keys.
---
I understand there needs to be a system to allow the last survivor a chance at escape but i don't think the solution should be a 50/50 hatch game, that is abusable by a key(follow the killer around till he finds and closes it then reopen via key). Not to mention taking 2-3 people with you via key is also frustrating.
---
As a token to survivor frustration i think moris need to be removed.
---
Nah i got the pallet stun as i wrote to some1 earlier i just cut the vid

M8, it's in the patch notes and you're on console where flicking was probably something you couldn't do due to the sensitivity in the first place.
---
When your family goes on a trip somewhere and everyone wants to go to a different place.
---
Hes just trash bruh i main survivor and i got no problem with ruin. Its something u just HAVE to run
---
I guess you do raise a fair point. I don‚Äôt know it just doesn‚Äôt feel right
---
I didn‚Äôt notice it when I first started playing and everyone including myself sucked. But now that I‚Äôm in mid ranks it‚Äôs brutal. I‚Äôm decent enough to understand the big picture of the game and to recognize good or bad plays, but we‚Äôre all still kind of potato and it sucks feeling kind of powerless to it all.
---
dbd killers are rarely scary when I played for a few dozen hours. Now michael myers looks like Sagiri with a trackpants.
---
It's not
---
It‚Äôs easy to play nurse once you learn her
---
I get more angry messages playing this game than any other in 25 years of gaming. Haha.
---
Hag's style isn't for everyone, but imo all of her perks are worth having. Ruin, obviously. Devour Hope is extremely fun, but has the normal hex caveats, especially once they realize you have 3 tokens. That thing goes down FAST, but I can usually get two or three downs before then. 
---
Third Seal...might be one of the most underrated perks in the game. I'm a purple rank killer, and it still fucks up games to the point that I don't pip sometimes. No one gets rescued and everyone becomes frantic VERY quickly. It's also not one people spend time searching for because it's so subtle. And it synergizes well with your classic Thana/Sloppy build.
---
Mettle needs a buff the protection hits are to hard to obtain
---
im a cuntress main and i feel this most of the times at high ranks im just m1 because hatchets are so easy to dodge and so hard to keep on target sometimes
---
Now that‚Äôs a horror game
---
I actually have the assassin's creed 4 logo tatted on me, my first tattoo as well and the dbd logo may be an upcoming tat
---
They nerfed mouse only flick as well.
---
r/comedyheaven
---
‚ÄúNew players‚Äù who have 4 different characters worth of teachables
---
Yeah they did recently release some stats with the 3 highest kill rate maps and 3 highest survival rate maps I'll see if I can find it
---
Fax. I want to run more fun builds but the second I take anything off the meta build I get the camping and tunneling 101 treatment. I'd love to run more diverse builds as survivor but killers make it not fun or competitive. And I'm sure it's the same way for killers when they try to do a fun build and get gen rushed.
---
Simple fix would be to ALWAYS notify killer if someone starts on it. Granted if your on a large map you're still SOOL..... Also they need skill checks since you're fucking with the spider gods power.
---
They mentioned Doc in the anniversary stream, and during the AMA they specifically said he was "next up" - with some additional brief comments on the extent of his changes. They also mentioned a few other killers that are in the queue for after Doc.
---
It does seem VERY nice for hook saves, like a reverse BBQ and Chilli. I know where he‚Äôs going, so I can loop right behind.
---
Ooh! I forgot about that perk. Is Jumpscare Oni a thing?
---
More nerf for the survivors that is what this game needs is not like the queue times of killer in red ranks are of 20 minutes or something like that
---
Here‚Äôs your gift for your birthday we‚Äôre  Nerfing you guys again
---
Crouching around the map lets you hide better, you make less noise while going though grass, and you can juke the killer better.
---
Instead you can be afk for 32 seconds healing yourself or go find a friend with bond and heal in 16 seconds.
---
Less time healing with SC means more time doing generators. SC is a bad perk.
---
For me it's fucking Swamp. Always. The. Swamp.
---
Yep. And when you‚Äôre on the hook, it shows everyone else all the auras. Helping them unhook you.
---
If you work with teammates, one person having Kindred is absolutely huge. You can use voice comm to share all the info.
---
This is the height of comedy. Thank you.
---
We will always come to defend the thicc, comrade.
---
That build would've been OP like 2 years ago
---
... nice
---
Can we please ban posts complaining about other peoples posts
---
So they gave The Shape Spencer's last breath?
---
Neat.
---
8. All of the above
---
Lol if we get built in ruin I wouldn‚Äôt mind survivors have a built in ds with a hard and fast moving skill check
---
For the record, spamming to attempt escape means you're getting camped
---
If youre running tenacity you need to be enforcing an altruistic playstyle for the team and always be in the presence of someone else, hopefully on a gen, so the killer has incentive to not pick you up immediately
---
I've been running Small Game, Kindred, We'll Make It, and Dead Hard as my main build lately and absolutely love it. Totems/Rescue/Heal/Loop. The perfect support role.
---
Not saying it's op but it is "perks that pretty much appear at least once in a build or all of them at the same time"
---
Hawkins is my favorite map in the game, totally not because I'm a massive Stranger Things fan or anything...nah...
---
Guess you havent seen the movie
---
On par with Billy.
---
So needed a Nerf, got it.
---
Getting downvoted for having an unpopular opinion  xD This community is funny as fuck.
---
I‚Äôve NEVER called him op or anything. I only said I‚Äôm not playing him and I get 200 downvotes xD
---
Pop also does great to create deadzones because you keep them working in one area for longer, and they will expend pallets eventually
---
Yeah, really, why did you add so depressing descriptions in your dark horror game with concept or eternal suffering and murder in core gameplay?
---
Thank goodness. I'm all for powerful killers to play against, but having a killer that wins by slowing the game down to a slugs-pace is painful.
---
What's the point in using any killer other than the most over powered killer in the game?
---
What stupid reasoning and logic...
---
Thanks! Took quite a few games.
---
Sitting on a gen holding m1 for 80seconds is already not fun or interesting, increasing that number is something the devs want to avoid.
---
I was thinking about doing very difficult skill checks for the afflicted survivor, but at the same time, having one less person able to cleans your other hex perks is a better benefit than just making it harder for them to cleanse
---
My friend pointed out to me that Yui's sweater seems to imply that she was riding her bike back home before the events of the Cursed Legacy trailer (where she was taken by The Entity), but compared to everyone else's "we're crippling alcoholics in dysfunctional households!" sweaters hers is quite tame.
---
I mainly play Trapper and a bit of huntress on the side.
---
If only NEA was this good looking in the game
---
He clearly just outplayed you.
---
Please unnerf Oni he's really fun to go against and now no one will play him
---
Is this recent?
---
thank you!
---
I was afraid no one would notice it
---
Yes because I really need to customize my hag trap and clown bottle so that all survivors will clearly see I‚Äôm a sweat
---
Did you see how the devs behaved back when it was a Discord exclusive?
---
I wouldn't count on that.
---
And the shapeshift killer could do gens but every skillcheck you and the killer hit regresses the gen progress
---
I'm still waiting for anything
---
I mean you have to think most of survivors and killers have had pretty sad lifes so it just makes sense for the sweaters to have equally depressing descriptions
---
Someone at BHVR must be going through some tough times, lol
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
That would be cool, but I think either people wouldn't use it or find a way to be toxic with them as well.
---
It‚Äôs forever
---
Yes
---
Yeah when I play killer I always go for the unhooker, not the unhooked. And it is a thing you hook one and focus them down until they die and can't do any objectives. I know it's a thing because it happens to me all the time. Killers will run right past the person trying to take the hit just to hit whoever came off the hook. And with killers like spirit, Billy, nurse, demo, hag, oni and I'm sure a couple I'm forgetting you dont even have to camp the hook to tunnel.
---
Swf gen rush with 4 toolboxes with Bnp is a thing. Outside of that I'd say yeah it's doing objectives. I like to do one gen and hunt totems and then get in chases and go for saves. But I play for BP not for escapes.
---
Really? Still seems as difficult as before.
---
well obviously but if you do the full 1 its a sign of friendliness
---
Tapp and Ash for sure have the coolest looking ones
---
I don't run it anymore but will say when I did I would take off running and the ghostface would chase me around the whole damn map. Granted, I didn't get chase points because I wasn't in a chase but I wasted his time.
---
The infection thats turns survivors into a killer for 30 seconds
---
It only makes sense because the perk literally says it will only proc from the injured state. But at a conceptual level it doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
New Killer: The Wrestler
---
Quick Lore: Former side kick to popular wrestler, America T. Great,. Jerry " Wildman Bill" Koffo , proved to be an excellent mix of technical skills and ruthless savagery, eliciting major pops from the crowds with his signature Wild Man Elbow Drop.  Despite his popularity, he was constantly passed over by management and overshadowed, eventually quitting and joining a circus as a strong man.  While preparing for a cage match with the locals, a man claiming to be America T. greats lawyer informed him of a lawsuit his client issued against him.  Enraged at his past following him to humiliate him once more, he knocked out the lawyer and  threw a mask on him and told the stage hand to put him in the ring, much to the hands fear and protests.
---
Attendees of that match swear those where the most brutal 3 minutes to ever pass.
---
Power: Psyche Up
---
Hitting, Grabbing, or getting blinded or stunned adds charges to his power.  Each charge grants the following bonuses:
---
.25 % bonus Ms speed
---
2.5% pallet break speed
---
2.5% stun resistance
---
Max 16 Charges.
---
Pressing the active ability allowed the Wrestler to charge forward a short distance an immediately grab a survivor with a reduced wiggle time.
---
While a survivor is grabbed/carried, the Wrestler suffers a Ms speed penalty, but can either: 
---
Hook a survivor
---
Throw a survivor and stun them for a duration.
---
If a survivor is thrown into a generator, depending on completion status, the generator is instantly regressed 10% and injures survivor or if powered, Burns and injures the survivor.
---
If the Wrestler throws the survivor into a downed pallet, the pallet breaks and the survivor is injured.
---
If the survivor is thrown into another survivor, then all survivors colliding are injured and stunned.
---
at Max stacks, grabbing a survivor no longer allows throwing or hooking, but instead is a carried charge that puts the survivor into the dying state upon collision with a wall, generator, pallet or another survivor, doubling the stun duration for the other survivor.  All stacks are lost upon collision.
---
The status effect, Stunned is defined as a survivor in a falling animation (think escaping a bear trap)
---
That lasts for the duration of animation.  During this time, a survivor cannot move. (Like, seriously, it is just an animation.)
---
The status effect,Burned causes the survivor to cry out in pain when performing any rushed action or when running.
---
Survivor: *I‚Äôm coming to the rescue!*
---
Entity: *Fuck this survivor in particular*
---
The devs have played with the idea of making each survivors teachables work better on that specific survivor, but decided against it because it gave an unfair advantage to certain survivors, they specifically mentioned Claudette
---
Lol! Or just be a glutton for punishment.
---
Scout!
---
I took it off eventually and will now follow the ghostface like a nea.
---
That would be dope
---
That sounds lovely.
---
Self mori would be better, plus it would stop killers dc‚Äôing. If the teabagging just gets too much you snap your own neck. Simple
---
when does mobile come out?
---
I‚Äôm not sure how everyone else feels about him, but at least we got a great video from no0b3 about this Add On. He had one hell of a time trying to get value from it.
---
Downside: they can only take the form of a survivor in the game
---
Back to just curving with Billy. Don‚Äôt have to wait for blood either
---
You got any source on the devs never being able to fix hex spawns? Cause that sounds like a load of bull, especially since it seems to just be RNG on literally spot on the maps. They can be the pic above (which they mainly are) or they can be on the outskirts of the map and every where in between.
---
They didn‚Äôt
---
this would be hilarious mori the survivor starts teabaging then the entity above the survivor makes them breaks their own necks
---
I played two whole matches just practicing it to make sure and he can definitely do a good 90 degrees flick. I only charge it for a second and then move the stick right as I'm letting go of the trigger.
---
Me and my swf can't seem to get sent to the yamaoka map house at all since the release of the shrine map |:
---
They are available forever.
---
Apparently a while ago he avoided swearing a lot and quite honestly it made his commentary a lot better than it seems now
---
Usually in high ranks 12- 18 you'll get DC's once you get lower I hardly get dc's
---
Well it‚Äôs either SWFS with a high rank, and rank 15-20 can be matched against rank 1-20, no limits
---
Yes. That's why it's a **team** based game. If there is still 5 gens and only 1 survivor left then the killer deserves his win. Why should a survivor had 3 team mates be given a free win when clearly they failed to play as a team. Why should the killer be penalized for doing well?
---
I forgot one moment that I was subscribed to the dbd subreddit, for that one moment I was confused as hell
---
Nurse is incredibly good on console just hard to use/master
---
Except that's still not an accurate point as Pig and Tapp are owned by different license holders compared to Michael and Laurie, and we have no idea on their restrictions so it's ludicrous to go on that logic because of Tapp and Pig.
---
Wait what? Does she actually do that in her lore?
---
Hatch is fair, keys are bs
---
shitty players that need everything they can get to do have a chance at doing well? idk man, survivors and killers have shitty games sometimes, just move on lol
---
A few months ago.
---
They murdered him.
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind keys for Endgame/final survivor at all. I absolutely hate keys letting out 2-3 people. If you try to play a killer that gets stronger as the game goes on (3 Gen strat Doc or a killer with Fire Up, for example) then your entire build is useless when three people just hop in the hatch. You could have all the pressure in the world and go from a 3K or 4K to 1K because of the Hatch. It‚Äôs annoying.
---
Burning an offering is just a fancy way of saying using it
---
6 ranks is ridiculously broad imo but whatever
---
I appreciate killers giving me hatch but I understand why they don‚Äôt. They probably have spent countless of games not 4King and when they finally can they are going to bask in it.
---
I still don‚Äôt feel bad when gens get done really quickly as a killer tbh that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do as a survivor how can I be mad? If I‚Äôm playing killer, I walk away and a unhook happens, cool. If I come back idc who I catch I‚Äôm going after whichever direction the red marks lead me. If I come back and I see 2 survivors running away 1 of which I hooked and 1 of which did the unhooking why on earth would I go after the 1 with 0 hooks and no injuries? That‚Äôs counter intuitive to my goal as a killer. As a survivor you cannot expect a killer to show mercy in this situation that‚Äôs a lil nuts imo. If someone does a risky unhook when the hook didn‚Äôt happen that long ago you as the unhooker should be doing everything to gain the attention of the killer so your teammates can heal the person you just bailed out. If you waste that time the person you unhooked should be able to get to safety and heal up without the killer finding them immediately. This is why it‚Äôs a 4v1 game survivors gotta work together, not expect a killer to be nice. Tunneling as most people know it is survivors expecting a killer to be nice. Swf also have a bad habit of walking behind a killer trying to be cute when they go to hook thinking no one sees them and get pissed when that foolishness gets punished
---
#OBJECTION
---
Don't worry about it this person is crying over nothing it was a simple bug fix. And if your on console they buffed his flick.
---
That thumbnail is terrifying...
---
What even is that? üò£
---
The part where he just phased through the vaulting spot fucking killed me
---
Can he do this out of the demon dash ?
---
I'm trying to figure out if I missed some news about survivor nerfs.
---
I did that today on the same map. I didn't get downed but the killer got stunned while holding someone and they didn't drop the survivor
---
It was not, in fact i am a rank 5 killer
---
*otz.cheats is now working again*
---
I would even say the opposite make it so they can only can turn into a random survivor not in the game. The ability would be a bit op so this would give an observant survivor the opportunity to counter
---
To be fair, you also tried to trick the killer into grabbing you so I don't feel bad for you.
---
Don't body shame demo he has feelings lol
---
Depending on the time you play sure
---
clearly the bubba has proved his superiority.
---
&gt;6 ranks is ridiculously broad imo but whatever
---
They can't make it stricter because people complain about queue times.
---
Agreed, I'm a friendly killer who still gets messages saying "trash ez gg"
---
He could of just hit me
---
Been there, shat my pants. And yeah, I got got fair and square.
---
Yeah, but the reason they're not is very obvious. If someone acknowledges that and are still waiting then I'm not sure what to say.
---
Spam? I mean, I like the posts in this sub. But it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs being over ran with content... the OP just posted the exact type of content everyone in the comments is complaining about.
---
The entire idea of the upvote and downvote system is to indicate what is appropriate or not appropriate for the sub. Are you just upset that it‚Äôs posted and getting upvoted? Or are there a rash of posts being down voted constantly?
---
Either way, it always starts to such when the long timers in a sub start trying to force what they want onto others.
---
I too get that the match making sucks. But I‚Äôve been browsing this sub for a week in my feed and haven‚Äôt seen a single Match Making post show up in my home page.
---
But guess what, your post did.
---
Otz: "They should be trapped in around 4 seconds."
---
*3 seconds later*
---
Survivor: "AGHHAH!"
---
Otz: "Ugh, I was off by a second."
---
Now spank me and call my aunt and tell her her loan request was denied üò©
---
Okay. Have you tried dragging the game out and still crushing them?
---
80% kill rate tells nothing since you can do 4k and still depip.
---
just balanced landing
---
im sad
---
Im imagine not getting 4ks every round.
---
This post was made by waaazzzzzaaaaaappppp gang
---
Sure but if you do random survivor i feel like a counter to the buff could be default clothing
---
My favorite is when 3 of the survivors escaped and the person that died says "gg ez".
---
Haven't played it but it looks like they borrowed a lot of concepts from Left 4 Dead, which isn't a bad thing. I definitely hope it stays active as I would like to try it out. Going to give it a month or so though.
---
Doesn‚Äôt that mean they win since that was their entire goal?
---
Shhhhhhh us survivors are not allowed to complain on this subreddit you know this!
---
There‚Äôs a stereo type of ping neas in dbd? I just always assume it‚Äôs no0b3.
---
*You have entered Controversial Territory*
---
i play ash and my friend heard him say it and she was like flipping out
---
Ever since I first played huntress I always thought, "why don't the survivors use these things?!"
---
Those survivors shall burn for making my stabby boi cry
---
That‚Äôs true as well. Everybody at high ranks has these fancy cosmetics. A vanilla nea would raise eyebrows lol
---
Not likely that you will receive it. Technically - DG never released for console.
---
I had a survivor whose name was "morime&lt;killer&gt;" (I don't want to shame them as they were probably just tilted) so I moried them with &lt;killer&gt; and in the post game chat they  called me a toxic tunneller who uses op moris. 
---
When I explained why I mori'd them, they responded with "it's just a name, don't take it so literally."
---
Problem is, salty survivors will rate the killer terribly and make a killer who's not an ass hole, fall in with the ass holes. And vice versa.
---
Therefore we either have rando surv but default clothing or only shapeshift into survivors in game
---
Fred's just vibin
---
I'm telling you, some killers dont care. They could be a map away chasing someone, abandon the chase, teleport, sprint, phase, shimmy back to the hook, run passed the unhooker to get to the unhooked. That's purely spite. And it happens. 
---
I get what you're saying that's an unsafe hook save. And they should be body blocked by their teammate at least. But face camping and tunneling happen. I'd say it's almost an even split between that and killers who play to keep pressure on all 4 survivors equally. But I dont have data to back that up just memories of past games so that could be wrong.
---
The lore for the majority of characters is pretty tragic anyway - descriptions are definitely fitting.
---
Ok the ones about the dedicated server glitches can sometimes be really funny
---
That's not true in my experience, I'm rank 4 atm and get dcs very often
---
Holy shit that is cool as fuck
---
Same here
---
pip is a fruit seed, kind of what the rank up things look like so pip, double pip, and de pip just mean you went up 1, 2, or down 1 of those little icon things
---
Well, at least he's much better on Console now. I've been practicing for a few games and can easily do a 90-degree flick with him now.
---
D-did the trapper just use an Uno reverse?!?!?!
---
Pretty  mediocre amount lul
---
**brings more fog thickening offerings**
---
Let the darkness consume you
---
Cleansing with no mither because it fucks over the rest of your team
---
Well, that's good to hear but yeah it unfortunately remains Last Year.
---
God I wish just one game could actually manage to survive and give DBD some competition.
---
Meanwhile at the Coal tower, Ironworks/Storehouse/suffocation window, rancid window, rotten fields, cowshed, top floor of asylum, and the church on Campbell‚Äôs.
---
That‚Äôs for sure!
---
That's a bunch of idiots if I've ever seen
---
Good idea and cheers. I keep getting destroyed when I'm oni, probably because I'm not using ruin either though ;D
---
Yeah I'm definitely glad all the Stranger Things content is good. Hell, Demogorgon is one of the best Killers in the game now, and Surge is INSANE for M1 Killers
---
I really need to watch Stranger Things :P Maybe over Christmas
---
Yeah man, and us something fresh to play in the genre. But Last Year ain't it.
---
Billy is the most balanced killer in the game, he is fun for both sides when the killer isn‚Äôt a scumbag by being powerful but fair.
---
Thing is most of the sweaters from last year were very cute and tongue-and-cheek, with Nea's talking about how it makes her more catlike, Meg's talking about the sweater giving her good luck, and Feng's talking about how "even if it's Christmas you've still gotta be a gamer!" Even Bill's starts off a little depressing ("Playing hero had its costs." - Hey Bill remember that your friends think you're *fucking dead?*) but then becomes really tongue and cheek by saying "Wearing this ~~ugly~~ sweater was part of it."
---
The other sweaters meanwhile are like "Jane's from a dysfunctional household, Ash is an alcoholic, Nancy's friends are dead, Steve is lonely, and The Legion members are neglected and resort to hurting others to let out their rage."
---
I play killer mostly, but when MoM got trashed i was pissed. Instead of making the few useful perks less effective, they should make useless perks have some actual utility.
---
It can be difficult if you don't dedicate time to playing the game every day. There are alot of responsibilities that people have that prevent them from doing this. It makes it difficult, but not impossible. I try putting in as many hours as I can when I'm off of work, I may not finish but I'm optimistic that I will :)
---
Ya uhhhhh, I don‚Äôt think they nerfed survivors my dude
---
Don't have the exact quote but it's something along the lines of "Playing hero had its costs. Wearing this ugly sweater was part of it."
---
Oh I don't, plus some even join in and the game turns in to complete shenanigans.
---
This would be interesting.
---
Take my money
---
"You're the only one that fucks that thing, Michael!"
---
I'm not mad that they've nerfed, forever Freddy could be pretty tedious, but I think they went a bit overboard. imo a better solution would've been to just have each of the rope addons say does not stack. So on their own they'd still be useful, but not overpowered, and it would force people to change things up by having to use a completely different 2nd addon. With these changes both rope addons are worse than a single stack of thana.
---
It took a whole year to get another Susie skin üò¢
---
I would vastly prefer Dead Hard if it wasn't so buggy and dependent on ping quality.

Oni definitely feels a lot nicer on console. Theres more of a smoothness and turning feels much less sticky. I've gone from struggling to get more than 2 kills a game vs purple/red ranks to now getting 3/4 a game consistently. Thanks for making him fun BHVR
---
Oh yeah a lot of people are playing it! I get games instantly
---
This is so specific but I‚Äôm here for it
---
Exactly why ds is in every build. I'm not saying what you're doing is wrong, just understand why every survivor has ds. Because when you solo survive you can't do a damn thing about a killer who wants to tunnel you down. The only thing you can do is use ds that's it. And killer mains whine about that shit too. Its 60 seconds and there is another survivor right there who just unhooked.

All 4 of them were actually there. You can see the 4th one running left as Oni approaches the stairs
---
cute
---
This is aweaome
---
 Now I'm imagining a whole Christmas cosmetic patch. A rugged santa hillbilly. Elf Spirit. Reindeer Huntress etc etc
---
Aww it's been a year since most people found out that looking like survivors and being four of them is purely cosmetic and has no connection to the gameplay whatsoever :)
---
They already did that before, now after this Change his flick is literally useless.
---
We absolutely need this in game!
---
HELL YEAHüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
---
He probably thinks you're BMing him at the gates.
---
He was a fool for not camping you once he finally managed to get you on the hook. So close to the exit gate too, there‚Äôs no way he expected them to not unhook you. He shouldve played into your team altruism
---
OHHHH I love your ideas tooüî•üî•üî•üî•
---
I think it would be more fitting if he was using a dead christmas tree as a weapon
---
I had a match where someone had tons of crows on them and they hadn‚Äôt moved the whole match. I go it them once and when they didn‚Äôt run I just left em there till they decided it was time to play.
---
People tend to forget the fact that the average trial is 2 kills 2 escapes, at least 1 pip for everyone but 1 survivor and the killer is almost always guaranteed a higher baseline of BP than survivors because they aren't splitting objectives with other people.  
---
That balance is what keeps things actually interesting and playable.   
---
If survivors are too powerful and can continuously have 3+ escapes consistently, you're looking at a game where being a killer is not fun.  
---
If killers are too powerful and can continuously have 3+ kills consistently, you're looking at a game where being a survivor is not fun.  
---
Survivors should be punished for screwing up, not simply because the killer has too many counters to survivors' limited ability to evade.   
---
The Oni posed a problem in the sense of their power being able to counter all major evasion strategies. 
---
\-The flick meant that looping was only delaying the inevitable, especially if it wasn't a tight loop.  
---
\-Window vaults were invalidated by the reach of the charge attack, coupled with the flick, where even an early vault could be punished unlike any other killer  
---
\-Pallets were only useful if an actual stun was performed, otherwise it was broken quickly and the charge resumes in barely 1 second  
---
With the flick gone, he still has an extremely powerful point blank 1-hit with a ridiculously fast windup without addons if you start the charge and use the attack rather than just the attack, faster than a chainsaw with addons for rev time. But at the same time, now looping and window vaults are feasable against them.  
---
Now there is reliable counterplay that isn't a meta counterplay of "Better bring a healing build every time to limit blood orbs giving an oni power if we run into one" because the power itself isn't invalidating every avaliable method of evasion any longer.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is a healthy change for the game that actually keeps the balance in check. Until now, the only developing counterplays were  
---
\-Don't get injured and give him power. (okay but like, you can only avoid it for so long before at least 1 person gets hit and that's enough to give him his power before they heal)  
---
\-Heal quickly enough that you don't leave too many blood orbs (Requires preemptively having a build to heal extremely fast before even knowing you were facing an oni, an unreasonable solution to have to assume you need a specific build every game)  
---
\-Split up and hope he picks up the survivor they hit other than you rather than leaving them slugged and coming after you (considering it's in the Oni's best interest to use their power efficiently and to keep resoruces for their power flowing, they're not inclined to immediately hook someone they down with their power and will seek out others, likely downing them as well, leaving multiple slugs.)  
---
And then you have superb tracking without the use of addons or active powers in the form of the blood orbs. They also addressed this by having survivors absorb blood orbs they pass through when the bloody glove addon is active, which, is a great change as it doesn't allow for loose blood orbs to simply double as a free network of aura popups from literally any distance across the map unless the person is injured and generating orbs.  
---
Killer mains tend to not realize that, they need to be powerful, but not so much so that the survivors are always having to deal with saving half their group every 5 seconds and not be allowed to make little to any generator progress without completely sandbagging or leaving someone to die early and depip/gain little to no bp. It may be fun to knock down survivors left and right, but it's not fun having to turn the game from "Fix generators to open the exit gates" to "Constantly pick-up, Unhook, Heal, and be chased the entire trial until everyone is dead and the last person rushes for the hatch"
---
So are you cheating
---
I feel bad. If I'm better than the survivors, I'll get my two hooks on them, and chase them around like they're in danger, but I let them go. I'll even down someone and walk them to the exit, cause I still want them to be afraid they're going to get sacrificed. If I have a challenge to kill people I'll do it though.
---
Mine's "true"
---
Must be real easy to make you guys laugh! Let me try.... Oogah boogah! ü•¥üòúü§™ü§™
---
Eh, I'd rather have a Killer that's balanced rather than a Killer that's fun but blatantly overpowered. 
---
Oni may be fun to play but he's incredibly unfun to go against when he's completely lethal at any position of any map anywhere.
---
Why is it laughable considering that they still stack within his powers as well as perks? Do you really think that it's balanced for the killer just just casually walk around doing whatever, whenever and for as long as they want because survivors can't complete their objective while the killer can complete theirs any time they want? What exactly is balanced about that? Both sides need to have a chance to compete with each other and complete their objectives. Running addons and perks that reduce the ability for anyone to complete their objective by 80% or more puts the match 100% in the killers favor. When it starts taking in excess of 5 minutes to complete 1 generator it makes playing the game impossible against competent players.
---
So why do you honestly think that balancing his addons is such a bad idea?
---
Yeah I really be losing my god damb internet coolness points over that shit
---
On the bright side, people may stop suiciding against Oni and actually play the game now.
---
Because it‚Äôs a PC only game. Why would you lot get it
---
Only when 2 red ranks bring in 2 perkless rank 20‚Äôs into my game
---
No lmfao just started getting that code after I got home from work and updated.
---
It'd be a good idea on *most* perks, because the levels only increase by a small percentage.
---
There's a few perks that are already really good, and would become too powerful if they were increased any more.
---
They nerfed forever freddy calm your tits. 2 addons that shoudnt stack. chill.
---
Hey love the more lewd stuff you do with pig.
---
Or maybe I take the time to learn how to play a killer instead of blaming my mistakes on a piece of metal and plastic.
---
Noed cane in cause I was just asking about it. OP seemed more keen on a 4k and I was wondering to what lengths.
---
Man those dream games are the bomb though and I do agree with ya. I dont think a killer is toxic for killing or just playing but I know what the games are like that hes playing.
---
In all honesty, if it didnt take 10+ minutes to get into a game, then i dont think anyone would downvote op. I feel like people are looking for something that makes the wait worth it. Versus waiting all the time in matchmaking to be killed and bumped out into the lobby in less. 
---
Get your money's worth, you know?
---
It‚Äôs peak players all time is 1.5k, it‚Äôs dead already
---
Aw, unhappy Susie. :c
---
This is super adorable tho! Thank you for sharing. &lt;3
---
Dead by the hatch jump animation
---
#X
---
That‚Äôs not how math works on negative percentages.
---
Hag, Freddy or Clown doesnt really trap the survivors in place. They just really scares or slows them down but trapper's trap literally traps a survivor in place until they can get out or have someone helps them. Not saying i disagree but maybe thats the dev's point of view before they make hag and other killers.
---
Consoles actually got a buff. They changed his sensitivity and we are able to do 90-degree flick now.
---
Ah ok:/ thank you
---
That's what I'm saying, you may not use it every game, but when you do you never want to take it off. Lol
---
Sometimes is the key word.  My experience with them has usually involved getting tunneled or others being tunneled, and then the last person getting t-bagged while crawling to the hatch only for them to close it and either hook 'em or wait for the EGC/bleedout to kill the last person.

I have a job interview Tuesday to get the battle pass
---
I'm not gonna lie, I mainly play dbd for the chill lobby sessions, as I tend to read during this or on the first hook
---
Or if all gens are about to be finished.
---
I never said I think he's in a good spot right now, I definitely think they went overboard.
---
From what I've heard they think they overdone it too, so probably in like a week we will see a partial revert of those changes.
---

YOu think this is bad? I got one spawn with

---
Are aura reading perks that popular that that makes the big difference? And is that strategy more effective than Nurse and Spirit's powerful mobility?
---
Wow this game has changed
---
I left some space so people can draw it out, its either his arm or someone else's. it doesnt look right at all. Also the ember looks like someone is taking a drag on it while Bill lights it.
---
The Rift challenges are causing a lot of players to play like garbage so its hard to tell in a proper match what's broken and what's stupid.
---
I was The Glitched character haha! funniest thing i have ever seen, i got up and used the key plus you hit me which turned into what ever the hell i turned in too.
---
Ohmie is the homie!
---
his arm is not in the right position though
---
I miss bryce:(
---
Yeah, I guess so lol
---
Mario says if the survivors play bad, be nice hook and release em
---
Luigi says if they die they die
---
Screams for the entiryy
---
I never once said I think he's in a good spot, they definitely went overboard but I'd rather we don't get some idealistic view of the pre-nerf oni as he certainly had balance issues.
---
They really didn't want to increase console sensitivity so badly that they just outright nerf this killer. I'm sorry, my PC friends.
---
It looks like that to me, I guess it‚Äôs just difference of opinion.
---
joey and susie

I love how you can see the panic

Face camping's the biggest bitch in the game. I feel sorry you had to go through that man, yikes. 
---
 There's no doubt he set like 2 traps around you too.

Well tbf he is an alcoholic. But a kick ass alcoholic.

Why not use this opportunity to learn how to play trapper better?

Quentin will probably get some quasmetics when the licensing gets worked out. I imagine BHVR wants to make some money off of him, but they can‚Äôt with the license back in the late Mr. Craven‚Äôs estate, not for right now anyway. Once that all gets sorted, he‚Äôll get his facial reconstructive surgery and more cosmetics I bet.
---
Its still terrible though you cant even turn 90 degrees
---
monica
---
Weak. I'm a basement wraith main. Purposefully chase someone only when 1 gen left, down and hook them in the basement, once all gens are done, they won't even realised the NOED
---
Literally just message the survivors, the communities not all assholes, plenty of people willing to help in exchange for end game unhooks, flashlight saves, and the more annoying ones.
---
*Laughs in NOED and blood warden*They barely ever make it to last gen with me
---
Claudette and Trapper challenges unlock lore for their characters (on top of the rift fragments + bloodpoints). Why wouldn't you be forced to play them? 
---
No everything is about gameplay. DBD's lore is very rich.
---
If you‚Äôre struggling a lot for this challenge, why not just farm to be done with the challenge? That‚Äôs what a lot of people have done including myself cause i know how much of an ass challenge it can be
---
Or maybe, now stay with me because this could be a stretch. They just want to spend their bp and don't care about post game shenanigans.
---
Dude helped me get my noed sacrifice challenge
---
It's almost like it's intended to be a challenge or something
---
I got Grim Pantry three times in a row earlier, then I got Pale Rose twice.
---
Dye your traps, choke points, continually placing them etc. I agree sort of but it's not impossible to pull off.
---
Personally I like what they do to GG EZ in Overwatch. https://www.pcgamer.com/gg-ez-overwatch/
---
Yes I got this cosmetic idea from that person!
---
Why have an ugly sweater when you can have Quentin?
---
Yo, real talk thoughthats a solid plan. I totally fell for it and was like yo fuck this guy and disconnected. Lmao
---
Oh damn, that really kills the build I was going for then :/. Really dumb that Demo's own perk has anti synergy with it
---
Big brain M1 killer plays
---
It's funny. The average dbd game at red ranks with ruin is about 6/7 minutes max. The killer has to commit to 12 chases during that time, against masters loopers. But not only the chase, there's the finding, the hooking, the pallets, the kicking gens. It's barely impossible to have fun as killer today, from a former rank 1 killer for more than a year. And on top of that, they nerf forever Freddy build to the ground. The only build that give killers what devs don't, time. I stopped playing killer and honestly barely play this game anymore but I managed to get to the red ranks as survivor for the first time and it's hilarious how easy and powerful it can be. I feel sorry for killers.
---
I had a game as killer where EVERY survivor hid in the bamboo like that, it was horrible. Nothing got done, the game took forever, and I can't imagine they had any fun. The second they heard my terror radius they hid and my blind ass couldn't see them. Would've been fine if like 1 or 2 did it, but since the whole team was like that it was by far one of the most boring games I've played as killer
---
Mmmm. Bloodwarden. I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Yeah been getting more DCs lately. Both from players and killers. Would be nice if ppl could just play the game
---
I mean, I still get 4ks with Clown in red ranks relatively consistently (I'd say approximately 50% winrate if I play super sweaty) but I do agree that Clown is pretty bad.
---
Well, I love the art style!
---
Thank youüòÅ
---
When did they stop being available?
---
Legion...Nerfed...Nurse...NeverTouched....AllRight!!!
---
The challenges themselves are mostly just tedious instead of difficult. You'll probably have to go through several games before you finish one. As long as you put the hours in it should be obtainable though.
---
Because he commented cringe
---
Bill smokes cigarettes, not cigars. New survivor confirmed!!!
---
I‚Äôm maiming yui cause she looks so bad ass and I‚Äôm going to save up shards to get the sweater. Can‚Äôt wait to see how the mask pairs up with it
---
They didn‚Äôt, they are still there.
---
They have the advantage....so no
---
You're not doing it right until you run them for 5 gens and escape or killer dc's
---
I once followed a ghost face for the majority of the match using urban evasion I constantly looked up so I didn‚Äôt reveal him
---
I give hatch if the most obviously competent person is the last one alive. I enjoy the harder chases.

---
Kaepora Gaebora traps you in an infinite loop of asking whether or not he needs to repeat what he just said.
---
Oh no. Dedicated servers got your mouth O.O
---
Aren‚Äôt they all aware it‚Äôs a game?
---
looks like bill hand and if you look close it is the same sweater as well
---
Maybe, but Ash is the only one that's acknowledges that you exist
---
Nah shit. But they're near each other. The point of the clip is that a lot of people self care which is an extreme time waster lmao 
---
They did it again when on struggle and I ended up dying because they didnt get to me in time
---
The 2nd perk actually sounds really cool
---
Bill just has two left hands.
---
Graves
---
The real strat is to hook someone leave,and then go patrol the nearest gen if while you patrol this gen someone unhook go find this person then hook redo until dead repeat
---
They pit decisive in the shrine once every moth or so and it‚Äôs the most demanded on laurie strode... it doesn‚Äôt happen much with killers, though. Which is too bad because I play both roles equally.
---
Which killer would be the Rat King? I'd say either the Clown or the Oni because they're very large.
---
Self care w/ botany knowledge&gt;urban evasion
---
Um you know they nerfed her like a month ago right?
---
It's a shame, that's a pretty major bug. In a game based on time efficiency, having those extra charges can be the difference between winning or losing. I would've hoped they'd put it higher on their priority list.
---
It depends, I don‚Äôt use it because I always trigger it on accident, but it‚Äôs a good perk.
---
For ace... cmon
---
Really good times. SO many times, we as survivors would go shit crazy and start beating each other up. And eventually someone would turn the radio on and we would all start dancing covered in blood. While Jason is outside staring at us wondering what the fuck is happening

This reminds me of when someone accused me of tunneling them. Same guy kept running into my traps when I was playing hag. Like, am I supposed to just go the opposite direction? Not my fault you triggered the trap.
---
Ok because you said nurse went untouched
---
Yes, almost every time. Lately it's been fine but it was for every patch for a while before.
---
yes
---
At this point, Left 4 Dead is kind of a genre, considering Vermintide also uses a lot from it. I'm probably picking Last Year up the first sale it gets if the review bombs don't kill it before then.
---
IN. GENERAL.
---
Don't you mean when you hear the oni scream on the killer screen.
---
 Little secret from a killer main: my answer to the question ‚Äúdoes this last survivor get the hatch‚Äù is based on absolutely nothing and changes all the time. 
---
( I stole the meat of the joke from Chase Mitchell on twitter but ya know...added dbd stuff. )
---
I ran into the same survivor 5 times and ended up adding them because they risked their life for me several times
---
Number and duration are exactly the same for me as well
---
They patched voice chat and matchmaking on launch day this time, though.
---
I don't purposely try to prolong the game, no. I just focus on killing the survivors.
---
Susie dropped with good skins tho.
---
I play all the killers but yea ghost face is bae
---
I play all the killers but ghostface is bae
---
Yeah after seeing the replies to this post, I agree
---
Thats cool. But dont use the Chili add-on.
---
The aura change is very helpful against Object of Obsession which is used in higher rank SWF groups.
---
While the build can be useful, I don‚Äôt know how well it compares to Spirit and Nurse.
---
It seems really fun for having just launched. They just need to add a "random faction" option, make spiders only appear as Spider's passive, and re-implement weapon upgrades.
---
And advertise. Being unknown killed White Noise 2.
---
Ooh shit yeah I‚Äôm ps4
---
My point is there is no such thing as fair. It's a killers job to kill all survivors, not play fair or make the fun game for everyone.
---
Ah I see, thank you
---
Surprised that no one mentioned there's a list of common terminology on the sidebar. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary) the link to it.

Honestly this game if they broadcast themselves out more could be competition for dbd. Especially since their teams already way better at doing updates and communicating well with their fans on their discord. Feedback wise and shit. Something these devs still struggle with

AIR STEVE

yeah

Demo + Chains = $20 + Karambit = $24 + either Joey's or Susie's ugly sweater = $26.50

What now?

Ok, I laughed wayyy too hard at this
---
Nice thx a lot.
---
That's a left hand and a Cigar (Bill smokes cigs) so it can't be Bill. Maybe Ash?
---
Ghostface
---
Unfortunately I feel this because atm, PS4 FPS keeps dropping so it's hard to hit people. Try not to be constantly hitting, because this can build up and prolong a chase for ages. Hit when it's definitely opportune, like when they vault or are in a choke point like a doorway. And don't forget your lunge.
---
I appreciate the Victorious reference
---
No love for the bloodweb being loud as fuck?
---
Only nuts he'll be cracking is Evan's.

Honestly I try to keep it in mind but I can't help but think "Fucking seriously" whenever they miss one...then immediately miss one myself from the distraction
---
DS + Deliverance.
---
So I just did this recently. I found out that you DONT have to do a flashlight save, you only need to blind the killer. Also it helps when you're the only one holding a flashlight. I observed that when there's two or more people with flashlights you will definitely have killers with Lightborn/Franklin's Demise or they'll just have their guard up. One last tip: Use Bond instead of empathy. Sounds counter intuitive but actually the reduced distance is not a loss, you have to be so close as to be seen the second the pick up animation starts so the killer doesnt have time to adjust their camera. Hope that helps!
---
For some reason really reminds me of Tokyo ghoul! So cool!

I have a weird love of Scarecrows so I'd love to see one in the game.
---
How I feel everytime on coldwinc using mikey's 7' ass.

Ahhh that makes sense. Still kinda disappointed though, but thanks for explaining!

Still love him as well despite the deep wound nerf i still find it extremely satisfying running across the map stabbing survivors 28 times at least
---
Elo is the greatest band of all time and I‚Äôm glad to say this cover does them justice

Nah. Following his entire lore, he'd get shitfaced after his public exile from his hometown and reminiscing about the friends and his own family whom he has killed. Depressing as shit. And yes, i'm your local Evil Dead lore keeper

Xbox purple ranks in a nutshell.

The Neck-cracker
---
Idk, one of billy's skins uses an old shotgun. He whacks people with the stock and holds it by the barrel, I could see a Nutcracker doing the same with a musket
---
Downvoted because you **CLEARLY** messaged him and you were trying to start something. He defended himself against what,frankly, seems like a bully looking for EZ karma.
---
Toxicity is sadly still a thing, but you can easily go around it. While you cant do much against toxicity in game, post match toxicity (which as you may know is much worse) can be avoided.
---
First, ignore the endgame chat, dont read it or even leave that screen as soon as the match ends. If you play on steam disable comments on your profile (or messages, not sure how it works) limiting only to your friends. And if the idiots keep persisting on sending stupid messages through friend request, take a moment to appreciate the stupidity of the situation. The salty player became obsessed with making sure to "teach you a lesson" going as far as to send you a "friend" request so that they can slap a single message filled with hate. At that point know that you are dealing with a guy who just wants attention from you. 
---
If they persist by spamming you answer with a "get a life bro" or use some dumb and silly response to their hate like "Ah yes, the rage of my enemies only make me stronger!"
---
This game is definetly unique in every aspect, including its strange community, and is definetly worth playing again after a while, since ranks reset and you can feel more at ease while playing
---
Wish you luck if you decide to journey into the fog again
---
Oni's is obviously the most brutal, but Ghost Face's is the most satisfying to watch.
---
Billy‚Äôs power is a base power with no addons.
---
Iridescent Head is an Ultra-Rare.
---
There‚Äôs a difference.
---
If you face an opponent that brought an ultra-rare, it‚Äôs supposed to be much tougher. Like, ultra-rare levels of much tougher.
---
The penalty is only having 1 hatchet.
---
If any nerf is needed, make it so add-one can‚Äôt add more hatchets.

Plague

In a game today I puked on someone and then m1 them because they got close. They then ran away to a corner  to self heal and then immediately got the broken status after. The entity had to be amused by that one.

Define toxic. This word barely has any meaning in this community anymore.
---
If you want to play come back. It‚Äôs not any more or less toxic than it was two and half years ago. Some people just don‚Äôt know how to act around others. Tone them out and have fun with the game.
---

Didn't Freddy and Oni just get nerfed?
---
Only complaint is that it doesn't make sense for a sword to be there. Otherwise 99/100 my dude
---
And I fully support it
---
Yeah, they really should've had a beta to generate buzz and iron out some bugs. I'm desperate for a decent alternative to DbD at this point.
---
Serious question: why would you even want to main Quentin? He‚Äôs an obscure character from a completely forgetful reboot of a popular slasher series. No cosmetics, and not even played by a popular actor. So many better options in the game lol
---
A nutcracker that creates his own nut (job)s :p
---
I love it!
---
I always go with first message: "Ok princess"
---
Second message: "You're boring me"
---
It's the right amount of condescension and lack of attention that drives toxic players wild. Then I just block and laugh.
---
Like when I go against high ranks as a Low rank killer they get up my ass for trying to get kills loll
---
i prbably only did a year or two ago when i started out, like if im the first person found. then i was like 'screw this'. cuz i didnt wanna wait on the hook so soon in the match. playing survivor recreationally is lost on me. im killer all the way
---
Thank you I‚Äôll look into it. I just recently got a new computer and don‚Äôt remember what the motherboard is off the top of my head.
---
DbD had more than triple its starting playerbase in April. And went back down after, but the point is that release isn't every, or even most games' high point. Especially when they didn't advertise.
---
No worries, and good luck.
---
Yep.
---
There is a ready up glitch in which sometimes if you are spending bp or tab out then the ready button gets grayed out and you can't ready. This has been a thing since Ash came out
---
lol what if u were playing a lil kid
---
got one of those the other night. entire team, AND killer told me i was essentially useless meanwhile im like a rank 19/20 claudette terrified trying to do a gen, not knowing that people actually don't like claudette mains anyway so! yeah i got a fistful of people telling me i sucked and that i didn't deserve the hatch escape.

Ooo vommy mommy

If you leave then to Bleed out, they have to wait for so long sometimes. I get where you are coming from but completely disagree with you.

Probably just an error, he'd only be lighting it for himself.

Yeah, I mixed up Knock Out with Deerstalker. Tired after a long shift from work. 
---
"Worked" on the rework? The rework didn't come into conception until well after a *year* of Freddy being in shit hell. Original Freddy had a good killer in there, the devs just refused to tweak him and dig him out. There is literally zero excuse for why Freddy was as shit as he was and *especially* for as long as he was. No excuse at all.
---
Is it not from part 6?
---
Not many people think like that. You have my respect.
---
They should really be posting about MM being broken on the official forums, not here
---
Obsession? You mean exposed? Cause killer can't choose his obsession.
---
this sub has actual high quality memes unlike the main meme subreddits that are no longer funny
---
Trapper I just cant see the traps man.
---
If the survivor was doing their best to actually help their team and do gens, and their team are blithering idiots then I will send them down the hatch or out the door. Otherwise they are free game

I give mercy to survivors who have good fashion. Sometimes its me avoiding from hitting them at all if I'm at lower ranks because I find that fun but most of the time if I'm at purple or red then I just try to avoid finishing them off so they can get hatch. :)

Yes, an adorable 10ft tall interdimesional monster dog with a flower head of razor sharp teeth that can decapitate you with ease. But don't worry, he's a good boy. He'd never touch a fly.
---
Nah, that's too hard. I'd rather just bitch about it
---
Yeah same here. I've been keeping an eye on their Discord channel and listening to what people are saying. Overall it sounds like it's getting good feedback with a few hiccups that they're still fine-tuning.

Oni, Demo and Ghostface are my favourites.

---
IMO Adrenaline isn't even a good comparison to NOED. It rewards survivors for completing their primary objective of 5 gens.
---
Meanwhile NOED is a safety cushion if the killer fails to protect 5 gens.
---
That's not to say Adrenaline isn't a feel-bad perk. Shit can kick you down when you're already struggling, but it's no where near NOED.

If they‚Äôre a ‚Äúrare‚Äù survivor like Adam, Jeff, Ace, Tapp, Quinten, Laurie, or Jane then I usually plan to spare at least one of them from the start.
---
I‚Äôm more hesitant if they are prestiged or play aggressively though.

People who spread false information blindly to defend BHVR can get ducked. They're derailing public discourse for no reason.

Saving survivors with good fashion? That's original. What's your favorite combination of cosmetics for survivor? I personally don't have any favorites as I often switch survivors while trying to gwt the teachables.
---
Good luck mindgaming with that tall hat. But other than that, I like this.
---
Fine

Fuck no, get that thing away from me.

Lucky me then cause I play Laurie. Though honestly it was just to get DS.

Sure thing buddy :)

yeaa I type quickly and then edit the mistakes cuz I forget to check before pressing reply, sorry about that
---
I give mercy to survivors if they're the last one and give up. Like if I find them on a door and they don't start running. I also spare survivors who are being goofy. I love when people don't take the game super seriously. ALSO, I'll always spare someone if their team was useless and they were actually doing shit.

It's like balanced landing, for killers

God, H3H3 used to be so good.. Now he never uploads and he's just not funny anymore. And he always seems to get himself into controversy.

Legions is pretty cool, it shows reluctance to kill but still power behind it

The only way to play with friends and have tier 1 and 2 perks is to either snipe them or set up a private instance of the game which isn't worth doing to fake something like that
---
BBQ and ruin are the absolute best, must-have killer perks. Ruin is necessary to slow the game down, and BBQ is good for info and BP farming.
---
Nurses and NOED have variable effectiveness depending on your killer and build. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call them ‚Äúthe best‚Äù
---
Sad they‚Äôre not at least putting the lights back on lockers/closets/barrels. Oh well. Thank you though!
---
Nurse isn‚Äôt that bad on console, I‚Äôve used here you just need to get gud

Not taking the game to seriously is good. Trying too hard can take away the fun.

&gt;I‚Äôm ‚Äúproxy‚Äù tunneling (tf does that even mean?)
---
ah so let me explain. "proxy" tunneling is when you're not actually tunneling but the survivor is mad that you killed them and can't come up with a legitimate reason.
---
I run Ruin, No One Escapes Death, Barbecue and Chili with the obvious last perk being Blood Warden. Boy do people lose their shit when they thought they about to get out but can‚Äôt üòÇüòÇüòÇ I have a lot of fun with blood warden lol
---
I would but doctor is getting a big meaty buff
---
I just experienced the no wiggle bar again. I was pulled out of a locker by Freddy on Badham 1 and I was not given a wiggle bar until I was out of the basement of the house with a vehicle.

Legion didnt get nerfed lol. My friend is playing them at rank 1 and consistently winning.

Ghost Face. It's annoying to have to find him

It's the holidays! He wants to shake it up.

yeah but that game is pve so i can cut that some slack
---
You‚Äôre getting swamp? I‚Äôm getting Badham 1 through 1000
---
I usually give the last person the hatch because why not. But also if I slugged them for awhile or something I will make sure to give them the hatch or let them leave through the exit gates. Also, If I'm stomping the survivors too hard or If I know they might be a newer player, I will chill out and go break pallets or something. You know, let survivors breath and heal up for a sec. Because who likes being stomped

Flashlights are working really strange now. The code of the game allows survivours to blind the killer when the light beam in in their pov. But sometimes when you look at the wall and you still get blind that fucking sucks
---
Get to high ranks and then tell me you feel bad about murdering these cunt survivors.
---
I‚Äôve gotten hate messages from killers before. This ‚Äúhmmmmmmm I wonder which side is more toxic‚Äù is ironically toxic lol
---
My first time using a flashlight, i tried to use it to like light the way. I had no idea that you were supposed to blind the killer with it and was wondering why the batteries were gone so fast.
---
The spirit if played well absolutely wrecks me something shocking.

Ok, the Family Residence I don‚Äôt mind because I‚Äôm usually a map pressure killer, but I hate Sanctum because it is so god damn dark, and immersion is extra easy.

way to spread nazi propaganda asshole
---
"Low teir killers have little chance of winning at high ranks"
---
Yeah... I mean, isn't that why rank exists? If anything, like you just said, it's a crutch for worse killers to get higher in rank with less skill. It just seems a little cheap, as far as perks go.
---
r/ramiposting

If anything the community is even more toxic now lol

Look in the store yourself

It does work at helping you win though
---
Flashlight stuns are difficult. 4 times out of 5 I‚Äôm dying. It was a baby plague and flashlights are just fun to use
---
Perks have actually nothing to do with the guessing game. You could say the same as for survivor
---
- guess for no Ed 
---
-  guess for bloodwarden
---
-  guess for spirit fury 
---
See what I mean? I could go on. Perks having nothing to do with what we were talking about

They are not at all difficult and it's even worse that she was baby and you were BMing her. Congrats youre a toxic asshole.

Wtf üòÇ. Same thing happened to me except the killer found the hatch in 0.3 secs.

For the survivor one run detectives hunch and  prove thyself with a green commodious toolbox and just focus gens. Then sandbag teammates for the unhook lol.

Did you miss the 8 hour stream of only 4ks?

You clearly don't know me then

&gt;hmm kinda makes me think which side is more toxic

this is lowkey bait

Fuck your dog shit fucking game you guys made. Horrible fucking shit of a game . Fuck you devs i would spit in your face if i met u
---
Thanks for the Oni nerf. Now he sucks sacks .25x harder.
---
I was the Doctor. Idid not bust a nut, I actually stubbed my toe at the locker.
---
Things that I don‚Äôt expect atm and startle me, because I‚Äôm the killer I think it‚Äôs a little funny when a survivor spooks me but that might just be me. Weird movement too; a good example of this is when I brought a Dwight  towards hook but I started to feel bad because his teammates dc‚Äôd and he was full on baby Dwight who was clearly playing swf. He wiggled out and I let him think I was really trying to get him and let him get a few stuns on me before he realized I was friendly at that point. He then started pointing at the hook repeatedly and wouldn‚Äôt leave it so I dragged him to hatch to show him I meant well. Still didn‚Äôt go in but after a while he left and I now kinda have a soft spot for baby Dwight‚Äôs and tend to let them practice on me for a bit before killing them if I realize I have to.
---
Plus I play on Xbox so there‚Äôs no shortage of bugs to laugh about in-game, it‚Äôs honestly kind of ridiculous but I‚Äôve only been playing for a short time compared to some friends and they say it‚Äôs gotten better but I feel like every killer game I load up I find a new funny usually harmless bug a survivor shows me or does that makes me laugh at a little.
---
also that susie is dirt poor which explains why she became part of the legion and participated in all the vandalism and theft.
---
I may be a filthy Legion main but at least I don‚Äôt play like a scumbag
---
Turning on console still sucks. Like, the turn while charging is slower than when the charge is unleashed.

You should not do that. It eats a part of your second phase.

I didn't have trouble with the unhook challenge, I might've just gotten lucky though. I helped do the gens as quickly as possible, 99d a gate, waited for someone to go down, opened it then went to unhook with BT. Took 2 games for me to complete it.
---
Tbh I don't mind that, what I mind that I can't destroy old portals that are now useless.

Took me a single game thankfully but man are the challenges a chore atm. I don‚Äôt want to buy levels but man are they not fun.
---
Not quite true, since dedicated servers you can throw it a bit early and still get the stun. Also how does he hit him from the other side of the pallet.
---
hey look, another version of the exact meme I made a long while ago.
---
Me just now lmao
---
&gt;Did they change that today or something? :(
---
There was a hotfix for other stuff today so probably. We just don't know if the removal was intended or not.
---
Ya I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I unhook and run though the survivor to bait a hit, it‚Äôs a strategy and I tried today and it didn‚Äôt work but didn‚Äôt think it was removed
---
Doesn't work anymore.
---
No. I live in Australia and I have 30+ minutes queue time for killer. Its pretty ridiculous
---
Jk just add more pallets this game is pay to win killer favored you guys know it
---
No wtf, why?
---
Etiquette? Fair play? Unwritten rules?
---
You know why everyone always cries about unwritten rules? Because they're fucking unwritten. Because they're not fucking rules.
---
Anything within the scope of the mechanics is fair game.
---
Fucking etiquette? You want your opponent to play nicer because you're bad?
---
You tell your opponent to stop buying property in Monopoly because you're losing?
---
You tell your opponent to stop making 3-point shots in basketball because you can't sink one?
---
Only fucking community where people are such entitled assholes that they literally blame their opponent for trying to win the game.
---
And people wonder why survivor queues take so fucking long. No one wants to sit through low-rank bullshit only to get told they were trash because they tried to win in some fashion. Don't tunnel, don't camp, don't return to the hook, don't run Ruin, don't run NOED, don't run this, don't play Spirit, don't play Freddy, don't do that. They had to expand the search algorithm to lessen the queue time and queues are still 5-10 minutes.
---
And now mid-rank killers are getting shit on by low-rank survivor trolls, so those mid-rank killers are quitting. A downward spiral that's certain to destroy the community, but y'all don't fucking care, do you? "Fix our Queue times! Stop playing meanly! Stop trying to win!"
---
And I can fucking guarantee that you don't give a fuck about your opponent. You're not sitting there going "You know, I think I'll let him get a kill and not unhook that person." You're not going "Gens are going too fast, I'll stop repairing."
---
Why is it that all you entitled little assholes always talk about how killers need to be nice to you, but you never talk about how you should be nice to the killers? How come I don't ever see a post calling out other survivors for the shit they do from people like you and OP?
---
Nah. It's always "WAAAH! My opponent didn't play the game the way I wanted them to! They're horrible!"
---
Basic human decency is an understand of "I bought this game just the same as you and I'll play it the way I want." If you don't like that, either find a way to counter the mechanics or stop playing the game.
---
Fuck off hypocrite. Your etiquette seems to only be concerned with yourself. My comments were fully neutral in nature and you **STILL** were stuck so far up your ass that you thought to disagree with them.
---
It‚Äôs free check yo cosmetics!

idk man it looks like he was getting close to second stage and if nobody is coming to get me at that point I‚Äôll start wiggling around to try and get them to come get me, but thing is idk if OP was doing the signal during the whole hook phase, then you‚Äôd def be right
---
Literally happened to me yesterday. I asked them why they did it, and he told me it'd be too much of a pain to catch me again. Sigh.

You are just in a bad region. Maybe your region is not even that bad but the time you are trying to play, is. 
---
In South America I get instant survivor queues from 8 AM to 22 PM but queues get longer outside of this time. 
---
Killer is the opposite. It takes 5 min ~ 10 min to find a lobby during daytime but instant queues from 22 PM to 8 AM.
---
That's so fucking dumb. Abuse of the system much. Report them once and block them. Seriously, man. I play a lot of killer and that's what I do.
---
Ahahaha, I wish

I miss old H3 sm, podcast is boring af and that‚Äôs all they ever do. I don‚Äôt really care about the controversy just make some good content like you used to Ethan
---
Every region except OCE has a lack of Killers. People don't want to play against a bunch of toxic survivors that just bitch and complain the moment the killer starts to try and win the game.
---
So low-rank killers quit. BHVR expands the search algorithm to +/-6 ranks. Now mid-rank killers are being matched against low-rank survivors. Mid-rank killers get stomped and those low-rank survivors are toxic about it, so Mid-rank killers get frustrated and quit.
---
It's been a stable pattern for months now. Past two months, survivors complain about longer and longer queues, killers get insta-queues.
---
Or, to put it another way:
---
-----
---
Survivors: ‚ÄúKillers are overpowered! Nerf killers! Nerf this! Nerf that! Killers trying to win is unfun! It‚Äôs toxic! Killers need to care about our fun!‚Äù
---
Also Survivors: ‚ÄúWhy does no one want to play Killer for us?‚Äù
---
I'm pretty sure they up the chances of going to a map when a new one comes out for a patch or 2, it felt the same way with the Demogorgon map.
---

When I play survivor it‚Äôs obnoxious at the magical hits that down me.  Infuriating to seemingly outplay a killer with a good juke/vault only to get that invisible whack. 
---
However, playing killer is just as bad if not worse. So many times the aim assist has pulled my blade into wood. Countless times.  In addition to the annoying lumberjack tech,  you can often swipe through a survivor without registering. Just last killer game I played, my sword went through a David three times. 
---
I think both sides need to realize that hit registration is shoddy and will seemingly none you no matter which side you play.
---
Was that a legit bug or was the Trapper memeing?
---
If you're in a situation where NOED activates and there are more than 2 survivors left, you already lost.
---
He beats you with his nuts!
---
Nurses is pretty darn good. Even if you dont catch the heal, you KNOW theres a bunch of juicy blood to s u c c
---
It's not great at lvl 1 if you're a 32m terror radius killer, survivors have an entire 12m time to stop healing.
---
At risk of sounding like a degenerate, source of the... *research material* in the bottom panel?
---
Maybe running Instasaw can help you there then
---
Or more chases. When you have one or two killer. Slug a bit, let them pick themselves up, chase a bit more, you know what I mean
---
but that's the problem, I get into too many chases lol. you get more points for the shorter the chase.
---
Great, but terrifying! Nice job!
---
I think they will do that! The tweet doesn't specifically mention any winter event details, just that there will be one. So far every year it's just been a lot of mystery gifts in the bloodwebs and decorations in the menus and trials.
---
Hold out hope!
---
Otz begs to differ
---
As a killer that plays like 80% killer, you'd be amazed how much you can mess with a killer by not making any sound especially if everyone is injured because I will be searching areas less because I expect to be able to hear survivors. It also sometimes makes it hard to tell if a survivor ran away from the loop if you're trying to mindgame it. There are a lot of implications where the perk is good.
---
Plus it's good against Nurse and Spirit which are the two best killers in the game.
---
I do. unless they're being toxic
---
Hello main survival

Doing gens, you?
---
Fucking awesome!!!

I am surprised no one booped, an opportunity missed. :&lt;

Rank reset is tomorrow, maybe chill for a few days to let people rank back up and then go nuts on the lower ranks.
---
If i try this i get instantly on the hook :D
---
Clarification, some people are not understanding. This is a survivor's post, not a killer's post. killers, please don't complain, not everything is based around you.
---
Can I ask who? Always interested in seeing good and experimental Legion gameplay.
---
I might literally have to
---
Steve is da best, except for his girly screams...
---
I thought it would go above then down but nope, it's a phase
---
He's not weak. He has map pressure, a good amout of mindgames and he can end chases quickly. He has everything a killer needs to get pressure and win the game
---
Pop or nothing
---
I main huntress on Xbox and it‚Äôs not that bad, it‚Äôs just hard playing against SWFs with her bc she is so map-dependent and is a 110 killer

Ohm is the reason I'm even here.

No, one specific build got nerfed, but his base power is still undeniably strong, whichever add ons you choose to use.

So basically what Otz does with Legion in the later part of this game? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oznQD8ZkMd4

He was pretty bad but I give him A for effort üòÖ

I know but it‚Äôs if I‚Äôm really desperate

I see so much of people complaining about survivor queue times and will blame literally anything for it except the fact that killers are leaving the game. I dont get it, its pretty obvious. (Not dissing OP, im talking about the people that are willfully ignorant)
---
I just realized Freddy is probably shorter than spirit. The fedora tricked me. Oops.
---
Yeah, it sucks to camp and also be camped. Yet the challenge all but forces you to do so if you want to get it done effectively.

 \-there was 2 survs and 1 gen. I kill the one im currently chasing and if the last guy does the gen I let him go.  
---
 \-in the endgame, if there are only 2 survivors and 1 goes down trying to save the other I let both live  
---
 \-When it looks like the survivor just gave up on his life  
---
Usually I only spare people in this situations, because they tried even when others usually would hide and wait for the hatch or go away like cowards
---
BHVR: so what you mean is more nerfs, very well.
---
Freddy if you want to be OP, Myers if you want diversity in your play style.
---
5 survivors and 2 killers? ü§î
---
Ah another true Dwight. Hello friend
---
for fun? id say myers, but if you want relatively easy games fredster is the way to go
---
I personally prefer Myers. His playstyle is more fun to me than Freddy, even if Freddy is stronger. His teachables are also substantially better and used on a wide variety of killers in different builds, where Freddy basically only brings Blood Warden that only goes off once in a blue moon.
---
Freddy. He is strong by himself and even at level 1 you can do some damage. I usually play him without addons and only surge as a perk
---
Also, he can't lunge while carrying a survivor.
---
Because they bleed
---
this is the scariest dbd has been in 3 years
---
So pointing and waving are toxic now ? I've literally used it to let people know about generators or I have a key etc .
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
Played Nurse until I got the Trophies for her. If I never got the Adept before the Adept nerf, I think I would have never gotten it
---
Yeah dude. People usually are like that because they didnt play both, and to be fair, if most people played both there would be a way better feedback to the devs
---
I think they're both fun to play but Freddy is stronger. Freddy's fake pallets add-on is pretty great. While it's not better than his snares, they're a lot easier to use and a whole lot of fun when they work. Myers overall is a lot easier to pick up and play though.
---
I suggest watching a little bit of gameplay first and figuring out which one you'd enjoy more.
---
You can easily mind game the phasing in the terror radius
---
Omg talking about it makes me sad I miss f13 it was so fun I‚Äôm sad it had to die out :(
---
He was also rank 7 vs 4 red ranks. Oof
---
Technically yes but I don't think it's very likely you'd get banned.
---
My God I hate how loud the bloodweb is. I turn down the audio when I'm spending a lot of BP.
---
For the love of God give us a hotkey to mute game audio or get your shit balanced.
---
It‚Äôs not just survivors. I‚Äôve seen toxicity on all sides and we‚Äôll just have to live with it. The devs are doing their best to fix these issues and are going a step in the right direction with punishing DC‚Äôs.
---
He recognized the entity and backed off.
---
If someone wants to play and I don‚Äôt wanna play w them specifically I‚Äôll just go in offline mode
---
I would recommend to not purchase from them. I bought the vhs hoodie in the beginning of this month and never received a confirmation email and after emailing them like 3 times still no reply. So save your money
---
I used Photoshop touch on my phone, to do this I took a picture of the meme to get the placement of everything and then used screenshots of the shack for the background. I took screenshots of my characters in the store so it didn't have my in game name or player level clipping the characters. After that I went into the app and used an eraser/brush selection tool to get all of the background out of it for each of the pictures. Then I applied a tint to each of the pictures to attempt to match the MacMillan estate shack lighting.
---
My poor baby Lisa
---
Truuuue. I think the only way to balance (landing) this overstep is to nerf pig again so everyone worth being happy is happy. Who's with me?
---
I only had it happen when I clicked m2 on accident and then kicked a gen.
---
Indeed
---
I hate the archives. It's way too time consuming! Like wtf.
---
so i can tell that one of those perks is object, but is the legs one sprint burst?
---
I thought that‚Äôs how the old iridescent shard system worked, now it depends on how much XP you get from a match and if the XP makes you level up
---
Some guy was called "mori me you wont" and tried really, really hard to die. OoO, flashlight spam, etc. but it kind of fell flat when I knew his intentions. I was worried he was in a SWF when I saw OoO but he didn't last long at loops and played super fast and loose so I think he really actually wanted to die. I felt bad for everyone who wasted their time trying to save him, and for him since I didn't even have a mori lol.
---
I mean, Ash was a hard druggie in the show.
---
Also it makes sense for Legion. They've always been a group of misfits.
---
OK I wasn't trying to be rude, I just don't want people to rush into making permanent choices but you obviously know what you're doing (this isn't sarcastic)
---
Omg never thought I would see a worse Legion power...
---
"Sad Cupcake" really got me. What the fuck does a sad cupcake look like?

i think the general idea is they just get lost somehow.
---
Id rather have people suicide than dc, i still get my bloodpoints and a suicide takes longer than a dc does.
---
He's gonna crack my nuts (or I'm going to crack someone's nuts)
---
I think "Nutcase" is a better name
---
That's the trick with most mobile rip offs, just jam you in a forever loading screen and spam you with adds to make their money.
---
If you're very aultrustic and decent at looping babysitter is beautiful. Second wind takes too much to work and there is always someone snipe healing you. Camaraderie is just meh but it has helped in an egc build I was trying
---
Idk if it's bannable but you can definitely report someone for not participating in normal game play. Farming would fall under this rule aswell.
---
So later you can eventually get this perk on bloodweb. As long as you don't prestige your character, bloodweb on Level 50 generates infinitely each time you complete one
---
it seems like this game breeds players with bad attitudes-
---
survivors wait in ludicrous queue times to get tunneled/one-hooked/bad teammates/laggy killers/etc so they complain and victimize
---
and killers plainly have stressful and unfun games where generators get done way quicker than you can end a chase among things like still losing rank after getting 4ks so they complain and victimize
---
i wonder if having like daily bloodpoint/shard/cells bonuses for playing killer could make people play more killer and get better queue times and games...but they'd have to admit that it's the unpopular side first
---
I completed it on my first attempt at rank 1
---
I did 2 gens, rescued and healed 1 from the hook, then Freddy killed 2 and slugged the last one. The guy dc'd and I got into a hatch with a key
---
And I fucking depipped from that
---
I love the sweater cosmetics so much.
---
What exactly was the flick? Was it the ability to quickly turn when charging strike, or while dashing then strike?
---
Little do you know, he was completing the archive challenge, trap yourself 1,000 times
---
I also got inner strength, but it was on ghostface who also has balanced landing, adrenaline, decisive strike
---
That‚Äôs the pipping system alright
---
Inner strength*
---
Hur is doing decent with the New addon changes. But I miss frank mixtape with tinkerer :(
---
The exact same thing has happened to me but from the perspective of the guy being picked up
---
Thanks on mobile and I didn't catch it.
---
Nobody wants to take blame for it. They want to think that what they're doing is just fine.
---
Then again, a lot of those same people are the ones that complain when their opponents do something they don't find fun. So you have to care about their fun, but they don't have to care about your fun.
---
Far too many hypocrites for a healthy community.
---
Why did you screenshot and repost yourself?  And for shits sake, in light mode??
---
Teammates that screw you over aka abandoning you etc but you just hold it in during endgame chat duh
---
I always try to give them free hits and they always think imma deadhard trough the exit gate or just leave not giving them points. One time I let a clown throw 102937636329 bottles at me until the end game collapse was about to finish.
---
NOED: No one escapes death. A hex perk
---
Doctor, I‚Äôve gotta problem with deez nuts
---
If you had more than single digit brain cells you would see why.
---
Incentive for playing killer might help, but ultimately it won't solve the issue.
---
People don't want to be the opponent to a bunch of whiny crybabies who complain and victimize based on their enjoyment without regard for the other side's enjoyment. 
---
Most survivors that complain don't even consider killers to be part of the community. Killers only exist to get stomped and hated on.
---
Killer is clearly at a disadvantage in this game just due to game mechanics. Gen speeds, survivor items, perks and most maps are all in favour of survivors. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôm just asking that you observe both sides because both survivor and killer have problems.
---
I am not camping you. I am just trying to protect my chest
---
So Joey doesn't have a dad?  Is that because he's...
---
Y'know...
---
You were never meant to see the other player ranks, it was a bug
---
Well fuck. A bit too late. Have you tried contacting them on Twitter?
---
I think it's offset by the fact that this invisible man that wants to kill you loves playing with a big bell. The idea of being chased by a guy that keeps bing-bonging his bell is equal parts hilarious and scary.

Every survivor is pretty much a cosmetic so any perks. Depending on your play style

Uh sure bro im much better at surv but id kinda like to get better at killer so maybe we can help each other out?

Alien,  predator Mr x,  nemesis and pyramid head

Yeah that sounds right.

Well u didn't keep them busy enough
---
I‚Äôm new at killer so I know I‚Äôm not the greatest, but after I got up to rank 15 this started happening to me a lot. 
---
It seems like when I‚Äôm the survivor the killer is like everywhere so I can‚Äôt understand sometimes.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll make sure to do that today
---
Even though the ranks where perfectly placed above the correct people. Honestly I'm sure it wasn't a big but they had to call it a bug

Probably. She almost lost to a cop with a broken leg, and only survived that fight because she hit him in said broken leg.

Great idea even if they don‚Äôt put it in doctor specifically. Great art too btw

Ok a lot of people have been saying they weapon should be this ...‚Äô but genuinely, a big old candy cane would have looked great on him. That sword doesn‚Äôt fit the Christina‚Äôs theme, I know why you used it btw. Either way this skins dope so it‚Äôs a yes from me

Yeah :( the downside of multiplayer games is that it doesn‚Äôt depend only on you to play. Most multiplayers eventually die out #rip
---
why you gotta make me feel forgotten again
---
Bro
---
Hes been trash since ever.
---
Ah, okay I didn‚Äôt know it was normal hits before, thank you!
---
It‚Äôs about developing good game sense, learning when to do what. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to slug someone and apply pressure to another nearby survivor. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to focus down the gen jockey because his teammates aren‚Äôt doing the objective. Generally, camping isn‚Äôt very effective, and largely wastes your time, i would only recommend it as a last resort during EGC. Just practice, and you‚Äôll eventually learn when do what to maximize your pressure on the survivors.
---
yah, cause i thought OP was going for height order

My 5 favorite are Huntress, Demogorgon, Clown, Ghostface and Oni
---
I'm a survivor main. I see **FAR** less toxic killers than toxic survivors.
---
Your definition of toxic killer is wrong. Someone tunneling isn't toxic. Someone camping isn't toxic. Someone slugging isn't toxic. Those aren't reportable, they aren't bannable.
---
You don‚Äôt deserve it. If you did they can easily put it on console
---
this shit pissed me off so bad
---
How is killing yourself on hook the same as giving the last person the hatch?  
---
The person ‚Äúdcing‚Äù on hook isn‚Äôt him being intentionally generous towards the killer.  
---
Giving someone the hatch isn‚Äôt the killer saying: ‚Äúfuck this game I want to get out of here.‚Äù
---
Prove we dont deserve a dead game. We have dbd dont we
---
They missed the opportunity to give Quen a freddy themed stripy sweater...
---
You forgot the /s after all those downvotes lmao
---
I wish it was 3 minutes...then it would be better for both aspects :)
---
survivors aren't the only ones to victimize themselves either apparently
---
Can absolutely confirm. For the first time as a survivor, I‚Äôve only made it to red tier these past two seasons (with the help of a few buddies of mine) on xbox. We‚Äôve literally only seen two nurses. That‚Äôs it. One was ok, I think she managed to sacrificed one of us. But the other one...sweet mother of christ. It was pure chaos. We didn‚Äôt know what the fuck was going on, it was like she was two places at once the entire game. Someone was always on hook. We were 4k‚Äôd before we got anything close to a solid strat down. It was brutal.
---
The fact that most are cheating, and the remaining purposely derank because queue times are faster with the lower your rank.
---
BBQ sure for BP but tracking it's not the best
---
DBD averages 20-26k players on PC, deathgarden averaged 2-10 people towards the end . You don‚Äôt deserve the exclusive cosmetic 3head
---
The nurse looks so short ingame
---
He is still the top 3 killer. The nerf didnt hurt him that much
---
Hag
---
Never
---
If I slug the slugged person always gets picked up and then I still have to hook them 3 times. Yeah I see Otz and Tru3talent play fair but some games there's not anything that can even do because the survivors are too organised and fast at gens.
---
Wasn't the demogorgon from stranger things like 9 feet tall
---
It‚Äôs by far the most difficulty challenge for Lv3. You have to get really lucky. It took me a day to finally get it. Good luck !
---
BBQ and monitor and abuse.

Where is my elf Dwight? You lied to  me!

Screw waiting for dedicated servers, we need a DC penalty on all platforms... NOW!

Happened to me today. Player didn't open the exit gates so they just stood still for a half hour before they DCed. Thankfully got my killer dailies still
---

---

---
U can block messages from strangers
---
At least Nurse can Blink around the Yamaoka Estate. Sanctum is so bad for her
---
Imma be honest having to hold M1 for 120 seconds would make me stop playing survivor. Gens are long enough as is. Maybe implement another mechanic so killer‚Äôs can monitor/patrol better? Like a base kit tinkerer with a bigger cool down?
---
did you not see the /s  ?
---
.....
---
Nom
---
It‚Äôs all about finding the right time to slug, tunnel, etc. The name of the game when playing Killer is maximizing map pressure. And Otz, aside from being extremely skilled at the game, knows when to slug or tunnel someone down, as you‚Äôll see if you watch enough and try to learn when the appropriate timing is to do such things
---
Damn, I never knew how short some killers are compared to others lol
---
i was a Freddy main since Pig chapter, quit whining =\
---
He's a slouchy boy.
---
I guess
---
Like damn how unlucky that killer gotta be for two kobes
---
Freddy didn‚Äôt get a rework, he just got a slight nerfs to slow down add-ons, which are VERY minor. He‚Äôs still a solid strong killer.
---
Well usually it's a swf team - a team all communicating and who are experienced at playing together. You find the first one and chase them but they know exactly where to run and if you keep chasing them they are going to loop you and then drop the pallet and run to the next area. Sometimes you simply won't catch them (depending on the killer) because they could literally loop you round a particular area forever or at least long enough for their team to do all the gens.
---
Usually ruin will get cleansed very quickly and whenever you are chasing one then the other three will be doing gens and they probably won't fail as single skill check. If you waste too much time chasing one guy then you will see 2-3 gens pop in the first 2 minutes of the game. 
---
When survivors get off the hook they will go straight to do gens because they know that they have decsive stike and adrenaline will heal them when the last gen is done.
---
They're just far better organised, with strong perks and they will make it feel like there is nothing you can do. if you decide to try and get just one kill then be prepared for borrowed time and 3 people body blocking you and then decisive strike if you get the guy.
---
Yeah it was good and all, but people started dodging lobbies because of it too, making the waiting time even longer
---

Not sure why you're getting downvoted, what is 60 seconds of blocking the ability to escape even through the hatch compared to the entire EGC timer, which itself is doubled if you down/hook anyone (even if they're on death hook for the entirety of the sacrifice animation)?
---
Save some safe pallets to loop around? Forcing a 115% killer to M1 you is a free 40 seconds of distance (unless Nurse or Billy) in a straight line due to the post-hit animation and speed boost.
---
Leave through the gate you just opened before Bloodwarden hits? 99% the gate instead? (Too bad Bloodwarden doesn't trigger once the gates are opened if you get a hook while gates are powered).
---
Like 25% of the endgame due to a survivor being in the dying state, causing the EGC timer to last 240 seconds to BW's 60 seconds, isn't something that would be game breaking if it blocked the hatch as well for the same 60 seconds.

You have to understand; a multiplayer game lives or dies by the size of its community.

In its first month, DBD had an average concurrent playerbase on Steam of over 11k.

Plague looks taller because of the headdress. I used the top of her brown hair as the mark and was pretty sure she is shorter than wraith.

with how long queue times are i hear the are we gonna be here all day line every single time i queue üò©
---
So I am not allowed to express my opinion?
---
 It takes no skill to dodge demon strike now. The flick was strong and made oni viable in loops, despite his terrible hitboxes and the fact that his Demon strike gets stuck in any pixel you accidentally hit, which made it very hard to properly use wasn't changed at all. 
---
Oni's power now makes you weak in loops, so like half of his power is gone. In open space it is very easy to dodge it and it is impossible to hit a survivor when he runs around trees. 
---
He is terrible and unfun now. I would be fine if they made his power more difficult to gain. I would be fine if they made him slower. I am not fine with what they did.
---
Just whoever you want all the perks on really
---
How does this even happen
---
None of those are possible anymore unless you're utter shit
---
Just play Ace, he's got a built-in Iron Will
---
I thought the loudest would have been demogorgons roar silly me.
---
There's no cigar in his mouth so maybe himself
---
Why do you assume killers think you‚Äôre toxic when you don‚Äôt get hatch?
---
Hag, explain your smolness
---
I smiled when the first survivor got caught and burst out laughing when the second got caught. Did the second just ignore the other first getting caught first? Lmao
---
Just wanted to compare their in-game heights. I‚Äôm not sophisticated enough to find their model files or something.
---
Either the video clip is sped up, or another speed hacker, found a Nancy today vaulting back and forth and the window didn't block properly, and she was moving faster than me the entire chase, I couldn't actually get closer to her at all except when she was vaulting to troll me.
---
When she took off in a straight line (keep in mind she'd already been running and vaulting for 60 seconds already, so no exhaustion perk up) she'd pull ahead continuously, dedicated servers haven't entirely removed the possibility.
---
Bruh
---
I never played against forever freddy. How long does it take to finish 1 gen with 4 than, 5 dying light stacks ruin and his slow down addons?
---
well, fair enough
---
I guess it's because having one surv or another doesn't matter as much as the killer in terms of gameplay. So they don't care, cause people will buy Laurie anyway just to get Myers.
---
Plague looks tall because of her headdress. I used her brown hair as the mark for her head.
---
I've had an absolutely crazy PS4 rank 1 Nurse yesterday. Everytime I tried to juke her she was just appearing looking right at me and smacking me instantly.
---
It's the second or third time I've seen this in years with Nurse in DbD on PS4 tho.
---
Nah, snares are way better against good survivors.
---
Grind for people who don't pay is evil in general

Hey man, If survivors can be an ass to me I think its time to be an ass back

Definitely Ash! He's the only one missing in the picture.

I mean, your post is better than 99% of my totem spawns.
---
Further from the generator than most of mine.
---
Better concealed than most of my mine.
---
More cover in general (look, it actually spawned next to something that conceals it from certain angles).
---
And generally in a less obvious area, I mean there are worse totem spawns than right next to a generator in plain view of it.
---
Both best girls together!

What are the others?

ahh.. yeah that's very true. right now it's equal for people that paid and people that didn't.

Don‚Äôt worry at least 2-3 of us always run DS. üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I really don‚Äôt play the game much so why is this a thing? serious question is it to combat toxicity? If that‚Äôs the case it really doesn‚Äôt work not even a little bit I have about 3-4 hours tops playing thousands watching so I gave hatch once I play on ps4 btw got messaged and cursed out ran into the same person as a survivor got tunneled to death lmao.
---
Most people queue into the next game. Why waste time watching a stomping when they could be playing. I play solo que tho, so I can‚Äôt speak for SWF.
---
Nah. Gens just need to take longer or Ruin needs to make it so more skill checks pop up. At high ranks you're damned if you do or dont bring Ruin.

You mean the entire game*

Top 3 are you mad lad?

He's just really good at slowing the game down, one of the few killers I run ruin on.
---
As an LF main, that is almost certainly a placebo. Even though it has increased charge time, I heavily would recommend primer/carburetor + beast's marks for that purpose.
---
he was uncounterable. not overpowered but in chase - no counter(unless shit map like Lab). it's basically close to first Legion. because for the most part you can't do much and only rely on luck and killer making mistakes. he still surely could be genrushed and looped early game before he gets his power but no skill could counter his dash attack. especially not on shitty servers. relying on luck in 99% of cases is really unfun. i have no idea what you're on about with this rant, man. and yeah i'm a killer main, and i prefer scheming and mindgames to bullshit easy win(unless pro team) with killers like Billy, Nurse, Spirit, Huntress(cause of servers making her too strong) and now Freddy :c

his Dash flick was uncounterable. deal with it. he's still very mobile and strong.

Ironically, moris really only help killers who don't need it.
---
The killer either has the map mobility or one-hit-down potential to not need a mori.
---
Or they're camping.
---
Some random M1 killer without an instant-down to shorten chases, particularly if they're actually more of a weekend killer player or just do a few games after work (or after classes like me) and trend towards casual is going to get looped until daylight and even an ebony mori isn't going to prevent all 5 gens from popping.

Almost 3000 hours in the game and I prefer swf because I enjoy playing with friend but 1000 hours or so I have killer time and even legacy nurse and billy, destroy swf all the time. Infinites needed fixed definitely because even as a survivor I saw something wrong with that. I can both chase survivors down and run a killer across the whole map. I see entitlement on both spectrums. I get called crap names for 4ks because survivors are salty bitches or I get called crap names by salty bitch killers. It is the same on both sides of the spectrum. As a player of many hours though, I can see there is something wrong when survivors get nerf after nerf and when a killer who is broken as only killer mains bitch because it isnt fAiR. Please, oni was broken as fuck and needed the balance but people bitch he hot killed off. He still one of the strongest killers. 
---
Now please, lemme see them salty ass comments. ;)
---
nah, not good. Now no one will pick Oni becaus he is bad.
---
"Steve, come in Steve, this is Demogorgon, my foot's trapped in a chocolate vagina. Over."
---
Pc is better in 1000000 ways, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. You didn‚Äôt have the chance to support the game, so why should they reward you with free cosmetics. Don‚Äôt say we got bill, that‚Äôs up to Valve,
---
I always equip Lightborn when I see 2 or more flashlights in the lobby. Those free hits I get because of it are just too lovely
---
The thing about Oni is that at worst he is a Myers that gets his power faster. Like you can just ignore the charge altogether if you want. So I feel Oni with his best add-ons still might be better than infinite tier 3 Myers or Tombstone (presuming the survivors are smart and hide in lockers, not all survivors notice the tell that a Myers is running Tombstone though).

Honestly the Ony nerf is so disapointing. It was clearly not a "bug", as this was fixed during PBE and clearly stated as intended, so not only BHVR is lying to us, but they just killed one of the strongest killer of the game yet balanced.
---
Love the skin, but the theme would fit more the clow, no ?
---
I've got the opposite experience most of the time I'm playing, killer queues are either instant or relatively quick and survivor queues are at least 5-10 minutes.
---
I would think some mini halloween decorations placed around, like sheet ghosts and pumpkins. Possibly have a hedge border with masks poking out from the side. Keep the knives tho
---
Oni's username checks out
---
and that's a good thing. The bad thing is that this grind is tedious overall
---
Same reason killers aren't allowed to see who is in an SWF party, as well.
---
Though to be fair given the sheer ease of holding M1 and the honest difficulty that even the most casual coordination (where Ruin is, who is being chased, where the killer was seen, avoiding a 3-gen) because toolboxes and repair perks pop 3 or 4 gens in the time it takes someone good at safe loops to stall M1 killers or deny instant-downs causes to killers who don't bring the rarest of their own addons and go full tryhard with a lot more experience at playing killer than it takes to put on perks and hold M1.
---
I really think displaying SWF parties is pretty fair, if only a few SWF are actually 4-mans, what would it hurt?
---
When you realize the woman is stabbing herself
---
Scott can 4K with everything, he fucking won 32 games in row with limited speed Canibal.  
---
Now Oni is trash, so please, before talking, stfu and learn the game.
---
That's the overall pattern, yes. But at higher ranks (14+) Killer queues tend to be longer and survivor faster.
---
Do you mean that you let everyone go or just the last one?
---
The oni is usually hunched over,but when he does the lobby animation where he raises his club over his head he stands up straight showing he is even taller than he appears. Possibly the tallest in the game.
---
Maybe an orange jumper would be more "ugly"?
---
10/10 would buy
---
To be fair, that's on BHVR. I can't see how that's not on purpose.
---
Lol no, most of the time its because of rank reset or jist havent played in a while.
---
Most survivors unhook too soon, pretty much before you're even 10 seconds away from the hook, instead of waiting for you to chase someone else.
---
Tunneling works in those situations, you either make the person burn DS if they have it, encourage someone to bodyblock for the unhooked survivor, or get to put them back on the hook (also works for them burning pallets in a panic).
---
No BBQ&amp;C procs is likely to result in tunneling, I try to stay out of the locker if I'm literally across the map so that the killer comes for me; I still try to hide after 5 seconds have passed, but it's pretty good advice to actually let the killer chase someone else rather than fully immerse.
---
tru dat
---
I was rank 4 killer before last reset and I still regularly play against rank 1s and 2s. There are swfs, but then its 2 people mostly. Not 4 sweaty swfs. Actualy tryharding 4 man swfs are more rare than you think.
---
Yea OFC
---
Absolutely, he was way too strong. He decimated red rank teams repeatedly.
---
From the survivor side it felt absolutely bullshit that you could get behind a wall and run the opposite direction and he could still 180 and hit you.
---
From the killer side I felt like the power did all the work for me. I move the mouse even vaguely in the survivor's direction and it lands 99% of the time. It was too damn easy.
---
All these people have been parroting "we finally get something strong/fun and you want to nerf it!" but the issue is that those sorts of people were only finding it fun because it was basically playing with training wheels on. I'm glad he actually takes some skill now.
---
Last time i went against it, the game laste 25 minutes. That was boring, unfun, unpleasant... and the killer using this build still called us genrusher. WTF. Find a fuckin' middleground.
---
good that it's equal, bad that it's near impossible to complete. it should be easier overall, then the p2w should be a little easier than that imo. that's how these things usually work.
---
Oh forgot to mention playstyle if no black incense puke on everything you pass, pallets, gens, windows, totems. The movement speed add-on will not make you lose any speed. Find first survivor puke on them till they can't heal then down them. If infectious shows anyone run that way and puke then go back to the downed survivor hook and let the one spread.
---
I started playing it less and less and came back when the oni came out but after the nurf I got really mad at this game and I just don't play it anymore.
---
Im not complaining. 3000 hours admittedly 2000 into survivor. All I combat with is survivors have gotten I'd say twice as many nerfs. I just wish people would stop claiming all of us are entitled. But alas it is a toxic universe with children so I see it remaining toxic until the end. Soooo I just go on about me day. Ain't no skin off my ass. If it comes down to it, I'll find a new game if it really bothers me but it prolly wont, because it's just a game.
---
You know, I figured out once how to drop items on the PS4 but now I can't figure it out and so far google hasn't been much help. Can someone chime in if they know? I'd like to start doing this on good games.
---
I was looking forward to playing as Steve, I thought the character looked cool. I have only played 1 game as him since he came out, the noise he makes when hooked &amp; the injured sounds are just too annoying :(
---
What's the counterplays?
---
Yes I feel so bad then I‚Äôm like wtf I‚Äôm playing the game right so???
---
Wait....Did they finally get rid of that old ass Trapper intro??? Someone please tell me Yes
---
Ah but you're not going to get Deliverance against someone dedicated to camping like Leatherface, you're certainly not going to get the save off.
---
Traditionally if it's outside of the basement, however, someone does the generator nearest to where Leatherface is camping (ideally in solo queue this would be you, with sprint burst I hope) to see if it baits him out into chasing you for your audacity.
---
Someone else goes for the save, you sprint to an actual loop and try your best.
---
it is easy now. what is your point? it wasn't before. i played my lvl 1 no perks no add-ons Oni red ranks PC EU, I'd get fucked obviously but soon as i got power on, they were screwed. couldn't counter it for shit, man.
---
Seems the little girl is the brains behind this and she to deal with these two dinguses.
---
I've been maining Plague for a while now.
---
Thana, Dying Light, Pop Goes the Weasel and BBQ. BBQ is really a free slot, I just don't want to play with half points. I don't use add ons any more unless its for a specific challenge.
---
I love this build because it feels like how she was originally intended to play. The more people who are broken, the more crippled the team becomes, and even in red ranks they actually decide to cleanse more often than not at some point. As you keep people broken, you snowball very rapidly with Dying Light, and using Pop well resets gens which take longer to catch back up on each time.
---
When Plague can properly stall, the game is absolutely in your control. The game moves slowly so you quickly remove pallets, create dead zones, and the game gets harder for them every time you land a hit. When they cleanse and you go corrupt, they tend to try to be stealthy which ends up drawing the match out more. If the last 3 gens are close together, you pretty much win.
---
I love that the Thana/DL combo actually grants a significant penalty for not interacting with her power and just staying broken all game, it's made her much more fun to play.
---
I completed almost everything from Tome 3 except from kill 7 obsessions and 15 emlems before the changes to the tome and it's pretty possible. I haven't had any major issues with previous tomes.
---
Tome 3 was pretty possible to complete, but it just feels bad to do 1 challenge during 15 matches
---
This is why I think Myers is better atm:
---
1. Oni has to injure a survivor to get his power, survivors know this and will drop pallets early and loop the hell out of you etc.. Myers can just stare at you but yeah it takes time.
---
2. Myers in tier 3 is more threatening in my opinion. Myers can 99 you and then when close to you tier 3 and one shot. Stick on infectious fright and he can snowball. 
---
Oni can one shot but survivors can dodge him much more easily and he can be looped more easily and it's really hard to see survivors who are close whilst you demon dash
---
Oni definitely has more map pressure which is the only reason I would place him so high but that's only with his power active and myers can use perks to make up for that.
---
With his best add ons perhaps.
---
If you had asked me before the update I would have said legion but as of now I think clown is a little better. Legion definitely has more map pressure but clown can end chases far faster and if you stick on ruin, pop and corrupt intervention with thrilling tremors then he can make up for the lack of map pressure.
---
Running around trees for example
---
And in moments like that I always tell myself ‚Äúthis is why im a killer main‚Äù
---
That's why I said some of them
---
Is that just me or the game feels survivor sided again? Why can't we have some good killers? (I don't care about forever freddy nurf but the oni one is pointless)
---
Why do people buy dbd from the microsoft store? Steam is free so it doesn't make any sense to me.
---
Because they do not know how to counter it? Hello, Oni's been live for 1 week, it is not enough for people to develop decent tactics and get used to the new killer, as well as adjust their playstyle.
---
Lightweight makes it so your scratchmarks last 7 seconds instead of 10, which can be good and bad since it tells the killer where the tracks are fresher. Since I'm guessing you have no teachables that's pretty good.
---
I love the idea, but I feel like his weapon shouldn't be a sword. I can't think of what it *should* be, but I just think it should be more bat-like.
---
I mean, playing as killer tends to be more tilting, especially against a toxic SWF as you probably don't even get to impose any control, like you hook someone they unhook with BT and the unhooked shields the unhooker so you have to waste a hit, then a guy with the key opens hatch that you didn't even see and tells his team and you can do nothing because you don't even know where it is and when you find it they tbag you and you got nothing to do lol (speaking from personal experience)
---
Just Monika.
---
It's just circle! Took me a while to remember how to do it too, since there's almost no reason to actually do it!
---
I would change Iridescent parts to this:
---
 
---
Iridescent parts. *Found in the Fog, these parts are bursting with heat and power. Using them as components for Reverse Bear Traps imbues them with life and makes them extremely unpredictable.*
---
Death timer of RBT is infinite.
---
Every second while Death Timer is active, there is a low possibility (0.1%) that the Reverse Bear Trap will snap each second, killing the survivor.
---
The Reverse Bear trap cannot be taken off. The Reverse Bear trap does not kill a survivor attempting to escape though a gate.
---
All RBTs indicators is indicating the 3rd stage and emitting loud sound notification. &gt;!This is a very strong effect. Not sure if it should be kept or not. Reasoning: Beeping -&gt; free tracking like the doctor.!&lt;
---
Reasoning: Its a trade off. The reverse bear traps now dont delay the game, but they force survivors to spend their time better. Its now a game to leave as quickly as possible. This is now finally a game of life and death.
---
Do the 200iq strat: rebuy perks you already own to level up the character
---
Stop slouching, Lisa. You look small.
---
Like I said I checked post game and I have seen streamers face them all the time. They are less rare then the swf you say your friends are like
---
What a gamer.
---
VRRooooooooonnn
---
Except the fact that the ranking system is designed to reward hooking and punish slugging..
---
There probably won‚Äôt be an event with offerings and cosmetics but they‚Äôll definitely put the lights on the hooks and lockers again
---
It's a bug that catches the trapper in his own trap immediately when it's placed. Usually it doesn't loop like this, but maybe some positioning near terrain caused that.
---
Outplayed.
---
This is blursed
---
1. Tunnelling does work though lol. 
---
2. Yeah that's how tunnelling works well against swf, less well against teams that don't care
---
Plague, she‚Äôs annoying and there‚Äôs no avoiding the vomit and not healing all game makes it a gen rush game. Boring af
---
Wholesome blendette aids serial trapper.
---
It was justified, especially because people actually tried to play against him for a few months.
---
Same for spirit.
---
Oni was killed a week after release, same as old freddy. Devs have learned nothing
---
I‚Äôve seen it spawn where the drop down to the boiler room is too. I think they got rid of the bed spot, I haven‚Äôt seen it there since the update.
---
He wanted a cock instead
---
Is this the ace main starter pack?
---
Toxicity will always be a thing, just turn off game chat and the only reason you‚Äôll want to quit now is because dedicated servers will make you pull your hit out. :)
---
Pretty sure scratchmarks last 5 seconds. Could be wrong tho
---
This has been the case 2 years ago.
---
It totally disregards different killer powers as well
---
Now there are:
---
perk combos like Enduring + Spirit Fury, M&amp;A + Infectious Fright
---
Alternative to ruin (Corrupt Intervention)
---
Slowdown perks like Pop
---
Which are all better options.
---
Also, all 4 of those perks are easily counterable
---
Lmao
---
What's bill's ?
---
Nope, on badham I ran down the narrow walk between tall bush and house, cut a 180 to the right into the little garage/hut and he was able to swing all the way round and get me
---
i'm a killer main, fam. i bitch on your bullshit here specifically cause easy win pisses me off :D and Oni was an easy win
---
Whole point of post is it‚Äôs unbalanced
---
Those are SOME options, but the main twist is that ‚Äòthe mist‚Äô or the gold whatever you wanna call it, leads you to commit suicide from seeing things that terrify you and most of the time scare you so badly you have a heart attack- it‚Äôs also based off of a real ghost ship. Also, until dawn is an award winning game?? Lol. It was quite popular.
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
Oh so ¬£800 is like 1000000AUS$
---
I freakin love Myers with: Infectious Fright, Monitor and abuse, BBQ and Ruin or Knockout and deer hunter.
---
With Monitor on tier 2 your Terror is 8(!) meters, combine it with Dead Rabbit Adddon, and your Terror is 6(!!!) meters whole not in chase. On tier 3 in chase your Terror with Monitor is 40 meters, and now combine this with IF. Damn i love this build, its both sneak up and oneshot-snowball fiesta
---
üòÇüòÇ $1600 i think give or take some
---
Spyro the dragon is an award winning game, at least he‚Äôs more than a most. Let‚Äôs have him instead. See he doesn‚Äôt fit in for this game, either does a mist that makes you mori yourself
---
Ace
---
Fuck that grinning piece shit with his pink ass shirts
---
99% I get in a match with an Ace with cosmetics I know I'm in to rage
---
I also recognize it‚Äôd never happen and actually get put in the game. It‚Äôs a concept for a reason. I‚Äôm just someone that has a love for those games and dbd and I‚Äôm just Havin fun here lol no need to rain on my parade bud
---
Hah, it works! I was sure that it was some two button combination, but considering the previous time I'd accidently discovered it, most likely one of those buttons was the circle one lol. Thank you.
---
You asked for thoughts and suggestions, don‚Äôt be open to them if you are going to be upset when you get honest opinions ‚Äúbud‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs totally off subject lol I think a horror game has a perfect spot in a horror game??? Lol
---
Perfection.
---
Yes, and mories scale from common to green rarity
---
I just don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre so persistent on shutting down something meant for fun lol

My dreams finally come true

Like you don‚Äôt have to like it that‚Äôs fine??? But why keep finding every way to shut it down lol

Let‚Äôs just add characters like the wendigo from that game or a mist, something that‚Äôs a general creature, not unique from the game. That‚Äôs why I said better to doing originals.
---
Adding to what the other guy said, while killers need 75% kill rate to stay in red ranks, it is far easier for survivors to both get to red ranks and stay there, to the point that most people would agree survivor skill doesn't correlate to rank nearly as much as killer rank does.
---
I didn‚Äôt even notice for ages
---
You‚Äôre persistent on it being an amazing idea, as I said don‚Äôt be open to opinions if you can‚Äôt function when you don‚Äôt hear what you want
---
It‚Äôs actually what I suggested in my other post- doing a General wendigo not necessarily an until dawn crossover- and I got shit for that too. Can‚Äôt please anyone lol
---
From my experience, if you want to win consistently, you shouldn't tunnel unless it makes sense to (like they run to the middle of nowhere and you didn't get a hit on the other guy), or you pretty much don't have any other choice.
---
I mean you‚Äôre leaving roughly 3 comments in a row saying your opinion, then I say mine. Should I just agree with whatever then?
---
This one takes the cake as the biggest normie meme I have ever seen on this sub
---
I mean you said hear until dawn not an original,  so I‚Äôm not gonna expect an original lmao
---
I feel quite bad for piggy mains :( you guys don‚Äôt deserve what BHVR has done

I mean he isn‚Äôt one to use a sword but it still looks amazing

It‚Äôs not an amazing idea? It‚Äôs a thought that I acknowledge wouldn‚Äôt ever be put into the game.
---
They‚Äôd be useless then. Why use one when you could hook them
---
The plague is one Huge Bitch!

If you‚Äôve acknowledged that then it shows you it‚Äôs not a good idea

Hex: DC Penalty

Your cowardness will be remembered dy Entity. Every time someone DC, the Entity gain a token. Each token increased volume by 10% when DC, making his ears hurt. Once DC'ed gain "Deaf" status effect, lose 6 tokens

I know your pain. Still can't adept plague because of her poor scoring. 
---
Getting 2 pips in killers with instadown is a pain in the ass and all you have to do is just keep trying.
---
Blendettes are usually not good when it comes to chase,the only hard thing is spotting them.
---
And here I was thinking I wasn't going to fap today.
---
Straight up upgrade for Nea
---
No problem. Enjoy making killers' days. Not too long ago I was going gung-ho for a 4k as Pig, closed the hatch and ran to the nearest exit gate. A poor Nancy is just standing, looking at me, and puts down her toolbox. I crouched over to the toolbox, inspected it, and sent her a message saying that her offering was acceptable.
---
Same with Billy u barely get 1 pip if u know how to chainsaw everyone
---
Then wake up. Also its not the killers fault if your team doesn't want to wake up. Its a team game and Freddy just made players have to work as a team or die a slow death for their own mistake. Most games I win in 6 minutes against freddy, and the games I don't is because of my teamates not counterplaying him.

My Brother and I were Blit¬¥Toko for example, i loved this Detail. Nvm, scratch that. I love the entire idea of Cho¬¥Gal, he is revolutionary and should inspire more Coop Characters, there are more then enought People that thirst for such Content
---
Let me guess u taunted the killer once he came?
---
Its because of people like you
---
Its only fun for a moment and then everyone including killer accused me of hacking. I once got the flying bug which i could walk up in the air and if i stopped, i dropped down and the glitchy super speed bug twice and multiple accusations of wall hacking with legion which is jus part of his power lol. Sometimes i get scared i would get banned for their reports so if i ever get one of those bugs and cant reset, i try to suicide on hook.
---
Alright, thanks for clearing things up!
---
He probably got it with Xbox game pass as I would assume his friend is already subbed to game pass
---
That‚Äòs actually one of the things people complain about. DS is meant to be a tool to punish tunneler, but in this situation it becomes an outright out of jail free card.

I'd say hags spider face skin bc I hate anything creepy crawly thing. But spirits Halloween skin is scary and doc is in any skin but his bird beak is spooky and unsettling

Why chocolate though. It puts me in a very twisted predicament: 
---
Would be a shame to eat it, cause it‚Äòs so cool.
---
Would be a shame not to, cause it‚Äòs chocolate.
---
If you think this game used to be good for killers, you haven‚Äôt been playing long.
---
That‚Äôs not an answer to the question
---
It's because sick people go down in one hit, which means half as many chases as other killers. That means both her malicious and chaser emblems suffer from people not cleansing.
---
Good old rift. I've seen that video because of my interest in The Legion
---
So if you want alternatives to pop goes the weasel or surge. I‚Äôd recommend thanataphobia or sloppy, then just don‚Äôt tunnel people and they will be healing for quite a while. It‚Äôs still not a guarantee but should help out a bit. If they‚Äôre healing they‚Äôre not doing a gen
---
His face is like: HEY HOWSH IT GOIN GUYSH
---
That was pre nerf. He now released one that acknowledges the killer being pretty much dead now. Current state Oni is billy with extra steps.
---
That not true at all. I played Oni nonstop for 3 days and can assure you that I was able to down at least 1 person with every usage of my power. I played on rank 1 and lost 2 or 3 games out of 50 (Because of the stupid decisions I made). Early pallet drops just slow down your death a little bit. Every known structure in a game doesn't counter Oni at all.
---
JUST HIDE LOOOOL is not really a counter since it applies to every killer in a game, plus it's not possible when he has perks like Infectious Fright or BBQ, also can track you by blood orbs you leaving after yourself.
---
And even with his insane ability he was still balanced in a way that you have to work to get your power in the first place. His flick made him a strong and really fun top tier killer, now he is just a worse Billy.
---
He also did a 7 hour stream with 35 4k‚Äôs with speed limiter leatherface:) so i think you should stfu and search.
---
Have you tried not dcing constantly
---
Yeah it's really bs. I never tunnel yet get hit by it when I keep downing everyone quickly lol.
---
Thank you!

People who shit on legion and hate on players simply for playing them

broken back and uneven arm weight
---
Most of Doc's skins are pretty damn terrifying. Especially the Hallowed Blight one. There's just something about the 4 different eyes on his head that disturbs me.
---
As for the scariest killer in general, probably Demogorgon. He's a 10ft tall interdimesional hell hound who cares for only for food. And he's *always* hungry.
---
New cosmetic idea?
---
Yes plz BHVR, nerf this cosmetic and put in the real game üòç
---
They fixed them? Not sure. Been watching Tru3talent and uhh, he through the exit gate and then he just randomly got a protection hit, he wasn't even hit or anything... Just got one...

To be fair I have yet to even use the flashlight haha. I'm very new to the game
---
Use Hex:Ruin, it makes gens a lot harder to complete so it gives you more time to chase them off gens
---
PERFECT!!!
---
Pink bob nea
---
I'd rather have trinket presets honestly, I'm sick of having to cycle through every character individually everytime I get a new one.
---
It's when patrol around the hooked survivor looking for the incoming rescuer. Don't bother unless you know for a fact that somebody is nearby. If you proxy before anybody even comes all it ends up doing is discouraging them from rescuing and it instead encourages them to go back to a gen.
---
True, maybe it could also make the killers vision slightly black? Kind of like Legion when they get out of their power. It could definitely mess with their head because you can only see directly in front you while not being able to hear and getting stunned
---
BILLLLL VISCONTI!
---
SAME!
---
Hahaha you‚Äôre funny man, my friend!
---
Playing against a team of Janes sounds more hardcore than actual porn, somehow
---
Hahahaha so trueüòÇ
---
Only other problem would be u would leave scratch marks and adding more things to this one perk would maybe make it a bit op

I mean, dependence on alcohol/drugs is never a good thing, but if **anyone** has earned that shit, it's Ashley "I had to murder my possessed best friends in cold blood, got possessed by a demon, almost murdered by my possessed girlfriend, almost got murdered by the people who own the cabin, and got ostracized by my family/remaining friends who think I went crazy and straight up murdered them" Williams.
---
All of that happened in 24 hours when he was in his early twenties, and he's lived with everyone he ever knew thinking he was a serial killer from then till now when he's in his 50's.
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
I know it seemed like a great feature but people start to dodge lobbies because of other survivors ranks thus increasing the tedious waiting for a survivor lobby even longer. 
---
It works now fine the way it does
---
Oops
---
About the part with Trapper:
---
This is intended I think, because you basically step in a trap instead of your friend.
---
And yes, Trapper is very underpowered without the 3-gen. And without bags. And a good map. And against survivors wielding toolboxes. And against survivors with Small Game. 
---
Holy crap, buff him, BHVR!
---
yea

HahahahaüòÅüî•

Not Christmas related. But we need a huntress ‚Äúmother‚Äù skin. Have no idea what the cosmetics would looks like, maybe wearing a bathrobe or something. But the sole reason we need this skin is so that her hatchets turn into chanclas.
---
Jane has assets :^)
---
Not really about if they make it easier to aim. Of course that's a good thing. What would piss me off is if they decide to change how she aims NOW, years after her release where I actually had to get used to it.
---
üòèüî•
---
Definitely, you could crouch away tho. It would be really cool using something that affects the killer hearing. You know that one diversion perk? It could be something Like that but you throw it on the ground. If the killer is in like, 1 meter of it they go blind for 3 seconds and deaf for 10? I think that would be a really cool perk on a military type survivor
---
I have to disagree with you on that one. At least, that shouldn't be the case. Being enjoyable should be on the forefront of a game developer's mind. A thing should only consider being reduced, weakened, or removed if the fun gained is less than the frustration created. The whole point of a game is fun.
---
Don't have the exact quote on me (for some reason he wasn't shown with a "NEW" banner on the store) but it essentially talks about him skipping Christmas to work on the Jigsaw case.
---
Bc dbd is just a party game balance was never a issue it's only bc people want more and see dbd as competitive they want balance.
---
I can say other things that u would question like when noed wasn't a hex totems or when exhaustion went down as u ran and went down faster as u crouched or when brand new part did a gen in like 5 seconds alone or when 360s made u literally immune. And so on
---
i see. thanks :D
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure just once is enough for the temp ban and it grows from there...hey go for the record and get banned forever
---
And now ur lvl 101 what's the problem?
---
Well ain't that neto
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
When its your first two Killer matchs of the week, you go Myers because why not, just to land on Coldwind Farm two times.
---
Like seriously, the chance of landing in Coldwind seems to quadruple once i ready up as Micheal
---
I‚Äôve DCed about 5 times today and haven‚Äôt gotten temp banned
---
I have a twitch highlight of this happening as survivor. I was trapped and couldnt did and had a third person view of the killer...had to dc
---
I think that the hatch should take a couple of seconds to open, moris.... i don‚Äôt know how to balance them.
---
Maybe it's time based. Like maybe not automated
---
Hey, this is fun!
---
Very interesting ideas. I just want BHVR to make the deaf effect work on more things then just 1 hag add-on
---
Something seems wrong here.... bro it has to be ace
---
Quentin McBadBat?
---
Probably if you constantly do streaks of disconnects. Match after a match so to say.
---
3rd disconnect in a row in a would already result you under checking or immediate warning (I guess how fast you perform these). My best guess would be 5th or after reaching 10th disconnect would already give you a ban. No matter hours or anything else. Just gonna punish you with a temporary ban: the very last strike would result in a full ban.
---
Bill doesnt smoke cigars
---
Devotion =lv 100 so your lv 1, Devotion 1 which means lv 101
---
Blending is for losers. Red weave, bright green shirt, purple pants with red boots Claudette is the only way to go.
---
Oh ok but how did I get from level 83 to 101
---
I'm so useless at Ruin skillchecks i just wont ever get on a gen with another survivor and just run around the map until i find it.  
---
I think playing in high resolution (4K) really messes with the timing a lot
---
Hey. Hate to ruin your diatribe here but I main killer. So all your little hatred towards me thinking I'm a survivor main is completely null and void. I specifically mentioned an example of killer and survivor abuse. I, personally as a killer, don't Tunnel, don't camp, don't run noed, give people a chance if something fucks them, etc. Ive been at red ranks and decided I don't enjoy playing at that level. I typically try to stay in low purples but usually end up back at reds by the time reset hits. Yes survivors should be nicer to killers just the same as killers should be nicer to survivors. End of the day this is a GAME. There is no reason to intentionally ruin someone else's enjoyment of the GAME (I'll capitalize that again because you seem to think this is a real, legitimate problem in actual day to day life). 
---
Anyone who has bad manners in this game is a toxic asshole and that's just the way it is. As someone who plays tabletop games at a game store those are the types of people who get shunned. YOU are the type of person I wouldn't play a game with. You are so worried about your imaginary rank or your imaginary points or just "winning" in general that you can't handle anyone else just playing the game. You sit here and say that I can't dictate how someone else plays but you're saying survivors who BM or don't think of the killer are entitled assholes. So sounds like someone here is a hypocrite and it isn't me. 
---
Congrats on not only taking a video game way too far but being a shithead about it at the same time. I also like how your borderline harassment comments are "neutral" and HOW DARE I disagree with someone as intelligent and thoughtful as you. Grow up. Life isn't anything but what you make it and you make it shit.
---
It‚Äôs such a stupid system. I‚Äôve DCed about 5 times today and haven‚Äôt gotten a warning or anything yet. Bans for DCing is ridiculous
---
If it was removed for a reason then would u not think it shouldn't be re-uploaded I personally don't care but the mods on most Reddit places are merciless
---
Hag: Am i a joke to you?
---
Wait in Oni's trailer, Yui was like half his height. Does this mean Wraith is a fucking giant in the real world???
---

---
None, but I do love the scarecrow skin (a scarecrow fan), the hallowed blight Doc skin (gives me a cenobite feel), and that‚Äôs all I can think of for now.
---
You cut a 180 to the right? Something‚Äôs off here.
---
‚ÄúStop commenting don‚Äôt dc it‚Äôs not helpful‚Äù
---
Alright fine how about stop being a selfish douchebag?
---
The chances of Survival are even more slim than playing against Spirit and Pre-rework Nurse at the same time
---
Why u post same thing twice?
---
You'll need gen pressure. Unless your killer or build comes with insane lethality you're probably going to want a gen slowdown perk. Things like Corrupt Intervention, Ruin, PGTW, Surge, etc. Something else you can also do is make other actions like healing, take longer to complete. You can run perks like Sloppy Butcher, Dying Light, Thanatophobia, etc. However, don't go overboard on the healing slowdown too much as this will often encourage survivors to just say fuck it, and keep doing gens instead since it'll never be worth it to spend 30 seconds on one heal.
---
Some killers have pretty good gen pressure because of their ability. Wraith, Billy, &amp; Oni's abilities allow them to move at sonic speed which allows them to get from gen to gen faster. Freddy and Demo both can teleport throughout the map to help keep up pressure. Other killers who lack gen pressure usually have to make up for it with insane lethality, like Nurse, Spirit, Huntress. The rest are sadly, shit out of luck like Trapper, Bubba, Doctor, Legion, etc. You'll usually find killers are ranked on a tier list based on how lethal they are or how much pressure they can exert. 
---
Lastly, remember when to give up a chase. You don't always have to down every survivor you see or injure. Most of the time it's worth it to give up on one survivor to instead go across the map and disrupt the other 3 doing gens. If you find a chase taking more then I'd say a 1 ¬Ω min, abandon chase and go check gens. And one final tip of advice that ties in to earlier is to always try to have at least 1 person on hook at all times. This is because 1 survivor is hooked, another is rescuing them, and the 3rd one is hopefully being chased by you. This now leaves only one person to get the gens done significantly slowing their progress.
---
This is incredibly abusive and I‚Äôm going to report you now
---
Get a general idea on how before you do or you'll stand there trying to blind them while they walk straight towards you like some babies I've seen lol
---
Insta heals, insta blinds, old BNP and exhaustion recovery while in a chase was all unfair and for the most part uncounterable. While I agree with you that both sides complain a lot I disagree with you comparing those busted items and add-ons to Bubba's instadown (Iri heads excluded, those are BS).
---
I'm actually quite surprised that Doctor is still the second tallest killer after demogorgon and Oni came out (or actually first on par with Wraith since they look on par, Wraith look taller because of those spike thingy on his head).
---
It‚Äôs a good thing there‚Äôs a penalty for dcing
---
Lovely !
---
You might still be under list of judgement though. I cannot 100% confirm this because it's Dead by Daylight and it's BHVR. Of course there's definitely a different team settling this issue but alas there's also no response or feedback on what's happening with Dedicated Servers or disconnecting issue. Have to wait and see on the news outlet what they're saying.
---
Also forgot to mention. You might still be that lucky guy and continue doing streaks of disconnects for a long time with no penalty. At least for now, because they'll probably inspect players who are not from far regions. From point of speculation though.
---
Awesome mate, I‚Äôm not the one leaving my teammates because I don‚Äôt like something and I feel I need to give up so my team can have a more hard time. 
---
Also that was incredibly true and maybe you will start thinking now about how you dcing can affect your team and not just give up because you got unlucky.
---
I think that should be just higher caps for sensitivity slider or something along those lines
---
each updates the timing is not the same anymore
---
Don't dc
---
I have no clue not probably not 1 dc = temp ban considering the fact that people may have to leave mid match to do something
---
They always do it with new killers. They make them op so everyone buys them then once they‚Äôve got their money they need them. Look at the history for previous killers it‚Äôs the exact same.
---
"Because I run it every single game it has to be the best!" Lol no. I'll give you BBQ and Ruin but the other two are situational.
---
As a killer main, I've got to respect survivors that taunt with a purpose.
---
You're on console my man, you have to expect lots of bull on most of unsupported platforms unlike PC.
---
Which is a shame but regardless, have to bear with this.
---
This version of Quintin still looks better than the real one
---
I don‚Äôt care about some people I don‚Äôt know. If DCing wasn‚Äôt part of the game it wouldn‚Äôt be an option.
---
Custom mori animation ideas? :thinking:
---
Read the original pist
---
Pretty much everyone on Hillbilly's left (so our right) is an actual giant (Nurse doesn't count, she float).
---
No I removed it myself. People were just insulting me and calling me stupid. Rather than actually have a reasonable argument and breakdown, they just harrassed me. But now I don't care. Hopefully people may be able to have a civil discussion since the Oni'd changes.
---
C R O N C H
---
Then your mom must have AIDS too, she tastes less salty than you. Stop crying
---
Like I said Selfish Douchebag you just admitted it. 
---
Dcing isn‚Äôt part of any game, leaving is an option for when you have a real life problem not a oh this is unfair so I‚Äôm going to quit.
---
I use the Blight axe and body, with the cat mask
---
Well that's the dbd community for u
---
Family residence has always been my least favourite map, I hate it for both Survivor and killer, Sanctum though? Haven‚Äôt quite made up my mind if i hate it or if I‚Äôm indifferent to it
---
when i first saw it, for a second i thought i was watching john wick 3 again
---
Wololo
---
You mean the Medusa Hag? With snakes on her hair and face?
---
Spirit is short ???? I always feel like she's big girl
---
Those looks like spider legs
---
Dude... this is so fuckin awesome.
---
Nope
---
Face.
---
Myers just got a whole lot scarier
---
Any Kate ever. The little shits are slippery as butter and always just barely make it across the pallet or window when I go for the swing.
---
To be fair I feel like David could straight punch any of the legion members nothing more ridiculous then seeing this behemoth of a man carried and wiggling by a girl with the body of a 16 year old.
---
Also feel the same about Tap, Jeff, Adam, Kate, Yui and Jake
---
One one hand, I love the Suzie sweater and I want it.
---
On the other hand., it's Legion.
---
You‚Äôre an incredibly toxic person.  Imagine calling someone such horrid names over pressing the ‚Äúleave match‚Äù button.  Very obvious you‚Äôre projecting.
---
Isn't it –±–∞–±—É—à–∫–∞? I'm learning Russian so I'm just curious.
---
I'm on console so maybe that's the difference. Turns like a brick, I have to stop run just take different angle.
---
I do
---
Uhh, default Hag skin but it's colored in black?
---
Elaborate. I can't tell if there are any "spider legs" for Hag at all.
---
I‚Äôve gotten a glitch were whenever I got hooked my vision would follow the killer until I got unhooked,was pretty cool
---
This, is how leatherface was meant to be played.
---
Build?
---
Just stay outta my basement
---
The doctor skin where his spine is exposed is creepy as shit
---
I had something like that as Oni, I got stuck in a gen, a Dwight slowly came to me and let me hit him, it freed me and I didnt chase him or hit him at all for the rest of the match.
---
Typical survivors just tbag me until end of match, I still love that Dwight
---
The yui scene at the start is a race according to her lore in pretty sure
---
‚ÄúYui was leading the race until she entered an unnatural fog that seemed to appear from nowhere. Baffled and confused she stopped her bike and dismounted. It wasn‚Äôt long until she realised she wasn‚Äôt in Tokyo anymore.‚Äù
---
It is, seriously
---
i don‚Äôt care if you didn‚Äôt ask for this response. don‚Äôt dc.
---
it is selfish &amp; annoying. if you can‚Äôt stay alive for 3 minutes that‚Äôs your problem and not your teammates‚Äô.
---
for each person that dies on hook or dcs the chances of survival for others become very low. the only situation in which you SHOULD dc is when you‚Äôve got teammates working to kill you.
---
and since you‚Äôve said that you have dced FIVE times today i have a hard time realizing anything was rational. i imagine you just give up as soon as the killer does their objective. no offense but there‚Äôs really no reason to be doing this in 2019.
---
Those fucking icons look familiar.
---
How?
---
Headset make it look that way, the four killers on the right are pretty much on par with each others, we're talking about a few millimeters of difference between each other.
---
Give him back to the Dark Souls community pls, we miss him.
---
also the fact that if you are starving you would greatly reduce in size
---
I main doc and wraith and always wanted to know who is taller. Thanks op
---
She IS small
---
I don't doubt it. The challenges have boosted a lot of people, and it's only gonna get worse with the new Rank Reset.
---
Hope you're enjoying basement camping with Bubba, OP.
---
She was unhooked 20 seconds before she got grabbed, so it‚Äòs okay
---
I didn‚Äôt pay with PayPal, but I already contacted my bank and explained the situation. I just have to wait a couple of weeks to confirm I never got the hoodie. I picked standard shipping. Hopefully all goes well for you, but it‚Äôs already been almost 2 weeks and they still haven‚Äôt responded and there‚Äôs no number to customer service number to call them from
---
Always have a slowdown perk or two in your build. Ruin is probably your best choice and Pop Goes The Weasel is a close second. Without them gens go insanely fast (at high ranks) even if you‚Äôre applying lots of pressure
---
Had something like that t The Game in freezing room. Ended up catching ALL FOUR OF THEM in the same room.
---
They look different in game models then In loading screen that‚Äôs why this is kinda inaccurate
---
Sure, keep your satanic shit to yourself heathen.
---
Bill too
---
Explain what? To be exact? How we wouldn't of had him in a Christmas sweater? Because if we went by actually logic he probably wouldn't be in dbd?
---
He said the No hit all boss fight video is coming eventually
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
You got a point, but it still looks like she's shorter than Hag.
---
If say they are about the same but if we removed huntress headress and plagues headress plague would def be taller in game
---
Oooh yeah, thank you, that is what i wanted to know
---
The nutcracker music plays when he‚Äôs chasing you.
---
Huntress power bottom...is..is that how this works?
---
&gt;Honestly I think Iridescent Heads should give the Huntress unlimited hatchets, that way it has a similar effect for really good Huntress players but won‚Äôt be oppressive 
---
What do you mean?
---
This looks really good, but what if they did nutcracker on Wraith and his weapon is a candy cane and the bell is a gingerbread house?
---
Ruin BBQ Iron Grasp NOED
---
Lol the ignorance is strong with you, can you explain in any way how I‚Äôm a heathen? Please? 
---
I just want the best for the world and best for others and that‚Äôs what Anton Lavey Satanism is about so explain? I want to hear your ignorance please lol. Enlighten me my good sir lol.
---
Ah true,I try to learn it in my free time too so I do make mistakes regularly.I mainly try to learn it just to talk russians while playing games lmao.I'll fix it
---
I vote Hag for Snow Person.
---
Her traps can be puddles.
---
I think we're talking body height here, not exactly full model height. If we considered the model, we'd have to consider Spirit's hair too.
---
&gt; Survivor queue is usually around 1-2 minute. Killer queue is 5-15 (!!) minutes.
---
killer is a lot easier nowadays, so there's more of you trying to get into games
---
They could‚Äôve farmed together. Why always assume the worse where theres no merit or reward?
---
i like it, the build i use on nancy is sb, fixated, inner strenght, spine chill.
---
even fixated alone is useful for disorienting the killer and make scratch mark jukes.
---
Ok, now shits getting wierd
---
Ah cool, thanks
---
*Finally.*
---
1)  Keep your opinion to yourself, it‚Äôs not what I asked for
---
2) Selfish- I don‚Äôt have to play if I‚Äôm not having fun. Annoying- I don‚Äôt really care, the other people are free to continue playing. Your fun isn‚Äôt my priority.
---
3) I didn‚Äôt ask for an explanation on how survivor works
---
4) Again, irrelevant to the topic of discussion. I‚Äôm going to DC against Camping, Tunneling killers. Also ‚Äúmuh current year‚Äù
---
5) Annoying- see point 2. Entitled- I‚Äôm playing to have fun. Your fun isn‚Äôt my priority. ‚ÄúAbusing the leave match button‚Äù lmfao
---
Don't you think survivors must be able to somehow counter his power by doing sharp turns? Well deserved nerf. I literally saw streamers doing 180 degrees turns. How was that counterable?
---
Wraith is pretty good
---
You‚Äôve shown to do bad things in this thread and you also worship Satan
---
I plead the 5th
---
You did force him to grab you
---
Karma is a bitch
---
I‚Äôm not talking about the nutcracker skin at all. I‚Äôm talking about my huntress skin comment.
---
It doesn't look like he has any time at all to move away from the trap before it snapped him again, so I'd say he was stuck in some infinite loop
---
Are you fucking braindead dude? How is a billy with 180 degrees turns balanced? Fucking kids man.
---
ngl if the wrong person reads that they‚Äôll probably interpret that as racism
---
Wait... Who gets to P3 on Quintin but not anyone else??
---
At what point do you think it‚Äôs not a joke? See your ignorance on the top is amazing, you have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about and I‚Äôm glad that I offended you over my joke of a name or description. Like I said ignorance. 
---
Naw people just like that I‚Äôm telling you the fucking truth that simple mate, many people agree with me. 
---
Um see that last sentence explains everything that‚Äôs wrong the world and our fucking society. Only being selfish so you can do fine and fuck everyone else well sincerely fuck you then.
---
they spelled my boy‚Äôs name wrong ;-;
---
He could of hit me. Just like I said to the other guy.
---
BHVR is has literally never hired a sound designer for fucks sake they have no idea what theyre doing.
---
- screams on hook "**AAAAAAAA**" vs getting chainsawed in the back by hillbilly "ah"
---
- the intro
---
-most, if not all weapon noises
---
- new  trailer
---
You say to  'Stop commenting ‚Äúdon‚Äôt dc‚Äù it‚Äôs not helpful ' Nor is DC'ing helpful to the rest of your team mates that you abandon
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
You know damn well thats not how you it works
---
Yeah it is, just lunge
---
Why don‚Äôt you just keep tapping the gen so you dont need to worry
---
1) It doesn‚Äôt say that, it just says leave match. You‚Äôre using headcanon.
---
‚ÄúYour experience is not the only thing that matters‚Äù well to me, having fun is better then getting tunnelled and camped sorry not sorry.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to win every match‚Äù no shit Sherlock
---
‚ÄúDeal with it‚Äù haha no. Deal with the DC.
---
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just sit there and DC‚Äù  Yes. I can and will DC.
---
My idea of fun is being in a fun game instead of getting camped or tunnelled
---
Didn‚Äôt ask mate
---
My sound is broken on my phone, so I didn't hear anything
---
Steve as well
---
Yeah I guess. I saw a plague use it with thana once though and it really helped her out
---
Is sprint burst a good counter to Wraiths uncloaking on you? Or does his purple add on make him outrun you out of stealth
---
There are 2 types of survivors in dbd: people with 4 immersion perks that won't save anyone or people that are gonna camp every hook to farm you and get to red ranks.
---
#prayforthepig
---
What's the point of Unfortunate Landing? It just gives the killer a debuff and nothing else
---
Bug, when you step in a trap you are invunerable to it until you step out of the hitbox
---
Basically, its hitbox triggers on enter/collision, not a continuous instance within, this poor bastard just got BHVR'd
---
We're lacking reasons as it is, poor guy
---
cursed
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joke‚Äù he said, whilst burning a bible. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you tell it‚Äôs just a meme?‚Äù He exclaimed as he sacrificed the newly born. You saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke‚Äù is the equivalent of those YouTube prank channels saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a prank bro chill‚Äù. You still did and continue to do your vile deeds and worship false gods.
---
‚ÄúMany people agreed therefore I‚Äôm right‚Äù. The entire Christian Church agrees that you‚Äôre a heathen and a Satan worshipper. 
---
DCing in dead by daylight is everything wrong with the world? Pretty rich coming from a worshipper of Lucifer.
---
Poor ladies.
---
Gotta just learn to play around it man. If there‚Äôs an obsession, assume everyone has ds
---
The hash slinging slasher would work perfectly as the killer for this chapter
---
I think he's talking about the operation one.
---
I heard folks complain that Killers and Survivors are invisible. Or even pallets on console versions.
---
Awww don't hate on us Legion mains. We have the best girl in the game, Susie.
---
As opposed to you, with 0 convincing arguments.
---
Time for the LIGHTNING ROUND: Yes I get tunnelled/camped, no I won‚Äôt prolong inevitable camping/tunneling, easy? Maybe. Boring and unfun? Definitely. So no;  Might not though.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should be playing‚Äù That‚Äôs crazy bro but I don‚Äôt remember asking.
---
‚ÄúDo you really want to give the camping tunneling killer the win‚Äù I don‚Äôt really care tbh
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúno shit Sherlock‚Äù because I think you‚Äôre stupid
---
It went from good to bad, believe me I used to run this perk all the times, originally when you kill the obsession, everything is reduce by a lot and takes longer to finish, now its this! I stop running the perk entirely after the nerf
---
I appreciate you noticing
---
The only skins worth using obv.
---
I get Badham ALL the time. That and Azarov's are probably my most common maps to get as killer.
---
Plague and Doctor.
---
lol I wish I was a PC player for this reason, solid idea. sadly xbox is my one true gaming system. ‚ù§
---
Good old rift. I‚Äôve seen that video because of my interest in sound.
---
I'm down, shoot me an invite:
---
egroodx32
---
Why not? He got so much in his kit that makes him as viable as spirit and billy in red ranks, map control, mobility, one hit down ability, Can track survivors who are injured.
---
I'm new to reddit. it wasn't intentional and the other one was hidden immediately after I noticed. idk why the comment was necessary. lmao
---
I only spare them if I can tell they were shafted by their team. Like if a 3 man swf leaves behind the baby. Other than that, I have no mercy.
---
Because that's slower than a drunk sloth trying to crawl up a tree?
---
No, event cosmetics such as kate's top or david's coat are exclusive to people who unlocked them, and if you lost them, you should get them back next patch(at least bhvr said you would)
---
I can‚Äôt argue with that
---
I love to see posts about my Boi.
---
Definitely the tallest middle eastern woman I've ever seen.
---
Yeah I really hate when survivors get mad at me for winning the game when I don't tunnel or camp.
---
he was my favorite killer since release, he was so satisfying, but now he feels so weird to play, at least they are giving back the flick right?
---
Decisive strike is a perk, just like any other perk.  You're free to use it however you'd like.  
---
BHVR uses perks to incentivize certain behavior.  And in this regard Decisive Strike has been successful in reducing the amount of tunneling done by killers.  However, if a survivor has the opportunity to force a tunnel to gain an advantage, they are absolutely allowed to do that.
---

---
That's the thing. To play Nurse well enough for her to be near unstoppable on PC, you just have to be good. To play Nurse well enough for her to be near unstoppable on console...yeah you have to be an actual god.
---
So if you run into a good console Nurse, it's SO much worse than a good PC nurse.
---
It's not about if people are allowed to use the perk that way, it's about if the perk should create this sort of possibility or if it should be tweaked in a way. Of course people are allowed to use whatever the game gives them. I was asking more from a design point of view.
---
The perk is more than anti-tunnel.  It's also stops killers from snowballing.  I'd argue that that is why the perk is meta, more so than the anti-tunneling.
---
I am wondering that as well, how is this racist in any way? All I questioned was the use of food to create art because it sort of ruins the purpose of one of the two, you will either destroy art by eating it or destroy food by not eating it.
---
Should spit chirps are you while you‚Äôre being chased
---
Same can be said about gen speed, both fundamental game mechanics for survivor and killer game mechanics that need to be addressed first before they like killers offerings 
---
Why is it fair for a killer to run a perk called ruin every game ? Mori‚Äôs are balanced the way they are.
---
alright will do
---
Or you could just have klaus
---
Not sure if you can make ONI faster with add-ons like hillbilly
---
Yes and it should be an anti-tunneling perk, that's not where I see the problem. I see the problem in situations where tunneling can be forced, I wrote about this in another comment that you might want to read as well. I saw you commented on the guy I answered as well
---
I wish the hex totem looked like that lol
---
Its crazy to me how basically all the new maps are horrible to play for survivor and killer. They need to move their level designer somewhere else.
---
Once I was playing a Legion match against a Twitch streamer.
---
I was not watching his stream at all and then I heard his injured breathing behind a rock and a tree he got unhooked at.
---
In post game chat he claimed I was stream sniping. I asked him in chat why he thought that and he claimed I was trolling when I wasn't. After the 5th time or so of asking nicely, he was all (in a meaner way), "If you want to troll, give me your money" and banned me.
---
I had to find out by watching the VOD.
---
I‚Äôm survivor rank 3, killer rank 8
---
That is a lot of Rusty Shacklford.
---
This is the reason why people see this community as an example of toxicity. Don't fight fire with other fire, streamer or not no one should get to the point of crying for a videogame. Don't ruin other people's games on purpose.
---
(And no, I'm not taking the defence of the streamer either, I don't even know who that might be.)
---
I don‚Äôt mind, I just can‚Äôt believe how much support the idea got! The artwork is fantastic, I‚Äôm glad everyone else thinks so too!
---
You can‚Äôt expect (or even ask to imo but whatever) to not get comments like ‚Äòdon‚Äôt dc‚Äô in a teamwork based game, when you literally say that you dc for no apparent reason. Not only are you ruining your teammates‚Äô game, saying that you don‚Äôt care is incredibly selfish. Please just stop playing this game so you can‚Äôt ruin it for anyone else anymore. Judging by your other comments I‚Äôll probably get a reply saying i‚Äôm toxic or whatever but i want this game and community to be healthy and fun.
---
Pig more like Piglet amirite :D
---
Or maybe a searcher, so you type the first letters of the perk to find it quickly
---
His posture is super slouched though
---
damn vommy mommy got some legs
---
Slap that + Make Your Choice on Nurse.
---
Beautiful, just beautiful
---
I don‚Äôt think Oni‚Äôs dash was intended to use during loops. There‚Äôs no outrunning him, obviously.  
---
You literally have a one shot. Just chase normally at a loop and then press m1 for a bit for the instadown. Now it‚Äôs not an almost guaranteed down when you get in a loop. He could use his dash in a loop, nullify any mindgame you pulled on him and then 180 down you.  It‚Äôs not healthy to not be able to loop against Oni, see Nurse.
---
It kinda looks like the new game too ngl
---
Seems like just a description bug. The picture tells me it's the "Fix the generator on Mother's Dwelling and Escape" achievement, so it's most definitely a description bug. That's Xbox for ya.
---
I lost it when he phased through that vaultable
---
I thought Jane‚Äôs sweater was about coping with problematic family members at a Christmas party, like how most family tree parties have some drama or how you see aunt or uncles without a filter. I thought like a joke..
---
It‚Äôs ok now
---
It never was op
---
Needs more penis.
---
Lol Freddy looks like the black sheep of the family
---
Don't think it was ever OP, just extremely boring. It continues to be boring, just not that effective.
---
I spam crouch when I hit great skill checks
---
I spam crouch when I see someone on a gen
---
If they don't do some form of communication back, I stop doing the gen and stare at them while crouched. Then spam crouch some more. Most of the time it works. 
---
I never let the killer know my knees exists, but if you're a survivor you'll think my knees are springs magically bouncing me back up so I can spam crouch some more.
---
We have 3 buttons in this game that can communicate, only one of them is spammable and funny to me. You will watch me spam it.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e9nthj/is_the_archive_challenge_about_2_sacrifices_at/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
But every tome level has had a killer and survivor route.
---
People like you are the reason that Legion and Pig keep getting abused by the devs
---
The dbd one specificly is from the last episode in season 3 which is 7 ft.
---
It still is funny and friendly depending on the context. I tbag and crouch at my teammates when we spawn in or when I see them in the middle of the game as a way of saying hello. I also do it when the killer is friendly so we just mess around
---
But unless all 3 can consistently hit greats you don't want 3 people on a gen under Ruin. It's probably better to have 1-2 who can hit greats while the others look for Ruin.
---
no one tell him
---
Steve is not really that loud, he just sounds ridiculous.
---
Devs said once that killers are all alone, and never interact with each other.
---
Along this same vein my favorite potential reason why they can't is probably that they weigh like 100 lbs or something. Huntress tossing that like it's nothing lines up with kicking pallets to splinters imo
---
You already have the sweater
---
I hope you get banned for pointing out where the other survivor was and pointing out the hatch.  
---
His swf didn‚Äôt ask for this. You made someone else suffer, because you‚Äôre mad at a streamer. Sure, the streamer was toxic too, but it‚Äôs not helping to be toxic too. Toxicity creates toxicity.  
---
The fact that you‚Äôre proud and bloating about how you made a streamer, makes you a garbage human being.
---
Yes, he should search the internet at least once before making a post.
---
Pack it up bois, they just nails
---
it was never OP, just... fuck forever freddy
---
Oh because i was referring to the big bad one from s1
---
u ruined it
---
So they "fix" "issues" like these that aren't any, but hook grabs (and Treatment Mode hook grabs...) are not only still in the game and do nothing but encourage hardcamping, but the hooked survivor is still locked into the grab animation and cannot be rescued by a third survivor for its entire duration, which is just clearly a wonky, bad bug that rewards hardcamping even more.
---
Camping is part of the game, and a valid and legit strategy... but it's only desireable if it actually yields gameplay, which it only does if there are ways for survivors to contest and challenge camped hooks. Taking the little recourse there is away is very bad for the game.
---
It'd be close for nancy.  We can view the video time stamps to see that it took her 6 seconds to run from the hook to the exit.
---
Run speed is 4 m/s , crawling speed is .7 m/s  which means that it would take Nancy 34 seconds to crawl out.
---
Nancy Has Decisive Strike Tier 1 which lasts for 40 seconds.  And when she gets Bill she has only 20 seconds left.  Nancy would absolutely not get out.
---
Yeah great point. I'm thinking I will do an update based entirely on the apparent heights. That's the point of a visual in-game comparison anyway. Headdresses and Bunny masks will be counted.
---
Yes, but I want all challenges to be completable both way, not just 1 path.
---
This was my first thought. If Huntress can kick a pallet to splinters I don't see why hatchets weighing at least 100 lbs should slow her down
---
*Reads lore*
---
oh yeah, it‚Äôs all coming together now
---
Indeed, I do game.
---
Santa clown: am I a joke to you?
---
Imagine having a cooldown.
---
-This message was brought to you by Spine Chill Gang
---
Huntress has her head tipped down a little. They're close, but I think Huntress is a bit taller than Plague.
---
Yeah but that was before plague came out and she‚Äôs def taller than huntress that‚Äôs a fact because she literally has to be because unlike huntress she can use her projectile over objects wit ease
---
This actually made my day for some reason,  upvote for you
---
Because they are stupid and like to force their horrendous matchmaking on you.
---
Exactly, the killee had no way pf knowing which DS she would have, therefore he may grab her a few seconds before it ran out expecting her to have enough time to crawl out anyways. The killer has literally no way to counter it if she had had the tier III DS
---
That's really clever. I like it a lot.
---
I think he should be immune to all of his traps. Trapper getting stuck in his own traps really takes away from his "scary" factor for me. Like, you should be scared of him, not laughing at him.
---
It's not like it would even really be a huge buff. Mostly it'd be a QoL thing for Trapper players.
---
Now check out the bace - BWOOOM
---
The charge speed addon is bullshit, with it on you could use the run on every loop and be almost sure to get a down. That needed to be nerfed but they just removed his ability to hit anyone who doesn't run in a straight line, so now he is budget Billy.
---
I would have maybe understood the changes if they buffed demon strike, so it can become a good chase tool for loop, while the run is for moving around the map. But instead they just removed the main thing that made him strong, fun and unique, good job.
---
I'm at 56 right now and have almost 70 hours since the introduction of the rift. That's not bad at all as I also completed every tome released so far. With maybe 10 more hours I could complete the rift with some amount of Tome 4 completion.
---
I mean, for my average that's less than two hours a day playing.
---
hot
---
I never realized how tall Bubba was :0
---
Dont mess qith Vommy Mommy and Momma Huntress
---
The first comment here must be referring to him when he was released. As to your question he is much better on Console now. Since the changes yesterday we are now able to do a 90-degree flick with him where as that wasn't possible before.
---
The opening of the lockers is what gets me everytime lol.
---
So what im getting is that Huntress and Plague are absolute UNITS
---
They shoud have made the oni at least as large as wraith
---
Oni can be bullied a lot easier than Hillbilly though, especially early in the match since Oni starts with no power
---
I'm that fourth survivor wondering what the hell my team is doing to get downed so quickly.
---
nobody will interpret this as racism...
---
Hungey *
---
Wait, Ghostface players do that? I must be living under a rock, then again, I‚Äôm new to the game. Usually, it‚Äôs the survivors taunting me instead. Not that I care I‚Äôm being taunted, really.
---
Thanks for pushing me onward! &lt;3 
---
I really appreciate the mental support!
---
You know it kills you if you try to escape without removing it?
---
Oh damn. So he got a nerf at pc and a buff at console nice
---
I just realized Hag would be quite high if she would stand straight up
---
Self neck break

Well said sir!

(Very old post, pre-pig)
---
Couldn't have said better myself. 
---
I have zero issues with camping, both as survivor and killer but, as long as there are tools to fight against it.
---
1-2 games to get 1/10 of a tier. Each game takes round 10 mins give or take. So roughly over an hour and a half for each tier without challenges? And even then challenges only give 3-5 fragments which still aren‚Äôt even a tier by themselves. Rocket league‚Äôs rocket pass costs the same but the premium version helps you level through the tiers faster and those games only take 5 mins usually. And the cosmetics on DBD aren‚Äôt even that good? Like 5 charms are just redone 5 times and most of the others are symbols that are already in the game just plastered onto a wooden/plastic looking square? DBD‚Äôs battlepass compared to other games‚Äô is just bad overall. It‚Äôs their first so I guess we can give them some leeway but I hope the next set is actually good cosmetics and not already existing skins just painted different
---
aye take it as a sign and try huntress
---
For doctor I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs good for other killers like hag
---
My profile name has been "mori me daddy myers" for over a year now and I barely ever get mori'd. It's like Myers stops existing once you get past rank 15.
---
It's definitely worth it. I actually prefer it over ruin these days but you can always pair them both together for extra slow down.
---
I don‚Äôt want to see that freddy again plz
---
I don‚Äôt really do that, since I want to get it over with if I didn‚Äôt have a good time. I just hook them and maybe attack them while they‚Äôre on the hook if they were toxic that match, but that‚Äôs usually the extent I go.
---
Not sure on that. I don't struggle at all to land first hits and get the power meter to full. However with hillbilly I struggle so hard to land chainsaw hits
---
As a killer, you should alwasy assume that people have DS and adrenalin, even at low ranks, but it is more common in red to green ranks. Also, you can bait people into comming close to you by standing on dieing survivor and pointing your camera down for a second, if you hear footsteps and flashlight click just turn to them and hit them. If you dont hear footsteps then just pick him up and prepere to look up or down. For me personaly it helped a lot.
---
Yes, it's a nice alternative to ruin sometimes. Definitely pick it up.
---
Please do survivors
---
Down my drink as the rhythms boom
---
Bill is essentially Fidel Castro.
---
Ace looks kinda odd
---
Demo wants food so bad that he became the food!
---
Yes, they‚Äôre working on a fix.
---
Wait, what changes were made to oni?
---
Lol when I used to be a survivor main, I‚Äôd SWF a lot with my bestie and we had many a match where we would get caught because we‚Äôd be staring at the sky and raving as ‚Äòhello‚Äô to each other even though we were on voice com, if not in the same room lmao. 
---
Sometimes other survs would join us and we would just look absolutely nuts. One time a Pig found us and just crouched and watched us be stupid.
---
Then the match continued as normal lmao
---
DELETE BEFORE HE SAW IT
---
No his sprint control is improved, but you know when you spot a survivor and they take a sharp turn you could make a quick change in direction at the last second to hit them? That has been removed. So if a survivor runs around a corner you can't hit them anymore.
---
The Entity: *guys our travel budget isn‚Äôt infinite, please calm down*
---
Trapper onwards is a tie.
---
I was under the impression he was getting a rework/touchup because he's too much risk for such little payoff compared to killers like Billy/Nurse/Spirit, who are high risk, high reward.
---
Shit aye. Maybe that's for the best. As long as his turning is better then Billy's it doesn't overly bother me
---
Do you have a spread sheet that also has the ranks of the killers you faced. Thatd be interesting cuz lately at rank 3 ive been getting mostly purple killers.
---
You can tell the last spirit i faced double deep throated me. But I just wanted to make this to see if there was clear meta still. Used to it was super obvious but now the spread is getting better so that's progress.
---
Yeah lol, I'm glad I have all the DLC. The only character I don't have is Jeff so if he ever appeared I'm screwed
---
Entity Provided Cyanide Pills‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
I love that head cosmetic, i use it with a suit and looks like a lovecraftian horror
---
There are still a few licenses that are available, particularly Chucky and Candyman, but for bullying I've heard the exact opposite. Even then, I'd probably feel better getting to kill people than being run around a circle and blinded constantly, completely helpless.
---
I'm sad the actual gameplay isn't a factor, though. Dead by Daylight has the model for Freddy Krueger, but the character doesn't talk or use dream powers beyond the pallets, which are addons. That means more than the base game being fun?
---
Good idea, ima do this too
---
This is actually a really neat idea
---
r/dbdgonegay is gonna have a fucking field day with this
---
Yeah, I got the premium thing and was kinda disappointed with the rewards.
---
Baby dwight trying to repair a gen that is already powered
---
A generator takes 80 seconds to complete, not counting any addons, or great skill checks. Run ruin, and now they can't get great skill checks, and anything else just adds negative time. Any time spent looking for your ruin, is time not spent on gens. If you can't get a survivor down, and on a hook in 80 seconds MINIMUM, then you need to learn to abandon chase for pressure, or end the chase quicker. 2 survivors on a generator is 44 seconds, which is inefficient, as it would be faster for them to complete 2 gens separately. 
---
I know the math, you just don't know the game.
---
If everyone playing can get into a match, what's the actual downside of a smaller pool of players? Although they did fail to get the word out, so I'm pretty upset that it'll apparently just die without ever having an actual chance based on its merit, like White Noise did.

Have a great day! Thank you for your time. (And foreskin!)
---
;)
---
That‚Äôs what I call a piece of chocolate
---
This happens more often than in other games, it‚Äôs just overshadowed by the toxicity
---
Huntress wiped out a battalion I believe, I don't think a few survivors with hatchets stand a chance. But in game, you could hit the killer and stun them for 10/20 seconds but in return you're exposed for 40/60 seconds with a cooldown of at least 140 seconds
---
I‚Äôm assuming all the males have the same height and the females have the same height.
---
This along with the phasing sound bug have made spirit unplayable for me.  It's just to frustrating.
---
this sub really likes posting old memes, a month ago I saw a meme that was created just after michael was released
---
That's how most players are, they take the game seriously enough to rub in your face how "good" they are because they barely escaped.
---
As for recommendations, I highly advice Not Otzdarva, he is an awesome killer and uploads daily. Unlike that Otzdarva guy, he never uploads.
---
Why is this sub so ridiculously, unreasonably hyperbole constantly? It's like it's the end of the world every day anew and every aspect of the game is just a profoundly hellish experience, and particularly for killers there's just nothing in the game not to cry bloody murder over.
---
I'm sorry, but I could list countless enjoyable killer things that are and have been in the game for ages, as well as added throughout the years and recently, that did not get taken away immediately or at any other point. If you want to have an actual discussion, please consider framing your topic in a way that doesn't sound like... just please try and initiate reasonable discussion, and not some tired and tepid narrative.
---
As for reasonable discussion: Any reasonable, competent player will tell you old Oni flick was positively busted. Veterans of this game that were demolishing people with Oni said there is barely any counterplay and it's nuts. Zubat is an OG Billy main that has "suffered" the loss of Billy flick way back in the day, and guess what, he did not even enjoy playing Oni very much and stopped doing so after a couple of days, because, as he said, it was boring to him how he just saw people and killed them without there being much of anything they could do about it. He literally got flick back and dropped it after a few days because it was anti-gameplay in his eyes. Now, the flick is what makes Oni strong, and more than that, fun. Without it, he's still solidly mid-tier, and often you can simply cancel the dash and strike normally instead to still get the survivor relatively easily... but Oni needs the flick to reliably be able to make good use of the ability on tileplay, and more importantly, to be able to do so in skillful and fun ways. So I do agree that taking the flick away is undesireable. ...But they didn't take it away, flicks are still possible, they just changed it in a way that is not enjoyable.
---
The devs have already said they want to look at the flick again. And if they actually do what it sounds like they want to do, which is keep the old flick mechanics but cap it out at 90¬∞, that would be a good solution, where using flick would require more skill and offer more counterplay, but would still be strong and fun to use.

Nurse is floating, technically she is a lot shorter
---
Yep, everybody can take them. Difference with freddy is that he had those add ons that added extra 15% slowdown and he had his tp for pop.
---
&gt;Literally this is that bad players cried they had to wake up
---
It isn't fun to play against. Same problem with his snares and clown's bottles which just force super safe &amp; boring play. 
---
&gt;and get their looping simulator if they ever did get chased.
---
That's literally the only part of survivor gameplay that is fun, you are surprized that people aren't too excited when that part gets restricted?
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike would like to have a word with y'all.
---
Extra points if goosesteps too. That would be amazing.
---
There is no such thing as the perfect mai-
---
Hitting those ruin skill checks are solely based on what day it is. Am I having a generally bad survivor day? = miss every great skill check... Having a unusual good day? = I AM THE BEST SURVIVOR AT HITTING THESE GREAT SKILL CHECKS WOW GIVE ME MORE
---
Michael and Freddy for me. I love to play as them but I hate going up against them
---
What... if it was me who played as Jane I‚Äôd de-rank 4 times even though I did gens, got boldness points healed others and escaped because... logic ):
---
Another drama queen.
---
I thought it was a meme with the levels it took so long to realize
---
Sorry that the game isn't supposed to be a 1v1, but i'm sure you can go find some other 1v1 games out there. Have you tried Mortal Combat. I hear its popular.
---
If spirits hair doesn‚Äôt count why does Freddys hat count? She‚Äôs taller than him if neither count
---
First perma ban was from "abusive" language
---
The second permaban was because I opened steam achievement manager for the second perma ban back when you could reset your rank while I was in-game
---
Third time was for stream sniping was a killer and just face-camping as Leatherface
---
I like to keep it original each time &lt;3
---
Dead Hard has been broken since the dedicated servers, sadly. Works one out of ten times, even if you anticipate the hit perfectly.
---
Needs more glutes
---
I always forget this sub is primarily made up of yellow rankers.
---
&gt;Third time was for stream sniping was a killer and just face-camping as Leatherface
---
this isnt true, but honestly the others are very much deserved lol
---
Least you'll get a potential 4k
---
Santa Freddy sees you when you‚Äôre sleeping.
---
This is cursed
---
Laurie looks like a washed up singer from the 80's
---
You're wrong. It takes 45 seconds to finish a gen.
---
Tbh I use crouch and emotes in so many different ways. Alot of it obviously lost in translation but like last night I was throwing it back for daddy legion
---
Then when survivors go up in madness, they dont scream, they start caroling alerting the Doctor to their position
---
tastygorgon
---
Also how else can you counter adrenaline
---
I know this is a long shot, but maybe they could give the killer and survivor as a rift reward.
---
They'll probably have the tomes set up so that you don't need a specific character to reach the epilogue though. I think these have the Trapper and Claudette challenges on their own little branches.
---
She's pretty much ahegao when injured.
---
This is a weird point. Survivors are dramatically weaker than they were at launch in almost every way.
---
Deathgarden\`s intro is way worse
---
hex ruin oh yes i want you to ruin my insides
---
You need to drop it like it's hot. It pleases the entity
---
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/b8RJ7IYNt3c)
---
I'm sorry I'm late but the entity takes survivors that has hop like Kate for example she had a perfect life with hope. Until she disappeared by the entity. Also Jane had hope. All survivors had hope. The entity feeds on the hope. I hope you get what I mean
---
Lmfao me when i just got dbd going at finished gens for light
---
Ah the ol Grindroo
---
He is. Just thiccer than everyone else.
---
Gen times can seem ridiculous, but there are also countless variables that play into how fast gens actually do get done.
---
That it isn't impossible is a fact evidenced by countless hours of gameplay footage of killer players that win decisively often even before 3 gens are repaired. If you want to see how they play, just watch them on twitch or youtube. It will show you that it is not impossible to become good enough in this game to win the vast majority of your killer games.
---
A more immediate and personal tip from me for you: If you run Ruin with Intervention, I would suggest also pairing that up with either Thrill or Haunted Ground, because otherwise those survivors that are running around the map early game looking for non-corrupted gens to work on and are thus more likely to stumble upon your Ruin will obviously also cleanse it earlier, on average. And also, yes, tunnel, camp and slug if you deem it necessary and want to win by any means. Tunnelling at least the first survivor out of the match as fast as possible is just literally game-changing. But you could also care less about "winning" in the sense of killing survivors by all means, and instead play in a way you enjoy more, playing more "fair" too, and play for the chases instead. It really does not hurt much when people escape if you don't make it your sole objective to not let them. It can be annoying if survivors then get cocky, stall in the gates, taunt or say things in the post-match chat, but really, you will be above that at some point too, and be able to just move on.
---
It happened to my friend, we were working on the same gen and suddenly leatherface teleported behind him and grabbed him off of the gen, it was weird and we both saw it.
---
Likewise. But we were just about to pop the last gen. I had just gotten my 2 blinds. It gave me my daily but not the rift challenge :( 
---
And I wouldn't be so upset but I'm PC player playing on PS4 with my friends so using a flashlight is not easy for me üò≠
---
That's really dull and not interactive at all. I don't see what the issue is with this current DS. If you are killing everybody quickly, then you are able to take the DS anyway. And in the case of the video, the killer made a mistake. He could have gotten both if he played better and kept DS in mind. I think the perk is fine now.
---
Lol why didn't they come from the front?
---
Legion is great! I always 4k with him, without tunneling or playing like a scumbag!
---
I like how a stick needs fuel, but a chainsaw doesn't
---
This has happened to me!
---
why is the doctor such a chad

Yummy Jeff cake

Head on, apply directly to the N U T

I dont like spam, thats all, not ment to be mean

Holy shit that achievement is only 20 downs on steam?!

Its 100 on ps4

No wonder people never see me as the hag, I didnt realize she was THAT short
---
Went against a basement bubba last week in a survive with friends game. 
---
We gen rushed, did all totems, opened all chests, and 99 the gates. 
---
Still had no idea what the killer was doing or where he was. But one of my friends goes oh it‚Äôs probably a basement bubba watch. 
---
Little did I know that was a thing so all 4 of us slowly crept down to the basement and there he was. Insidious in a corner. 
---
Then bubba proceeded to get a 4K. Not even mad. Shit was hilarious
---
Doc is about to crack deez nuts and get some egg nog on his face
---
Where‚Äôs PTB Kate?
---
Because Christmas is a shitty and depressing time and this is a horror game.
---
The actual Michael Myers from the first game I think was not even 6 ft
---
waiting in the exit to quickly and repeatedly crouch at the killer when they get there = absolute bastard
---
Huntress is one of the highest in-game, but only with a hatchet charged, she slouches when just walking
---
I only give the hatch/gate if the last person doesn‚Äôt struggle when I pick them up.
---
Self care and my friend shown me she can look almost invisible with the right clothes on

If I see a double crouch, or something similar, I assume they‚Äôre trying to tell me something like ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúthanks‚Äù. If they‚Äôre spamming it, then that‚Äôs a different story; I assume they‚Äôre trolling or something.
---
Self Cares very overrated.
---
The rift has been weird lately. When I was doing the challenge, drop 15 pallets in a chase, I would stun the killer with the pallet and it wouldnt count it. It took me forever to complete that one.
---
We believe in you!
---
Someone else posted a survivor point of view of this.
---
Good for beginners to learn the game but after a bit you should drop it. Some games like legion don‚Äôt even require you to heal
---
#EGG FRED
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That sucks heavy. The rift is a little buggy. It gave me the basement killer one and I didn't have 2 people hooked at the same time just one then another
---
it gives away your position?  I mean kinda?  So do the oni's giant stompers, you can hear the footsteps outside the terror radius.  Plus announcing your position with the chainsaw isn't the same as roaring when you're in turbo killer mode as the oni.
---
The chainsaw isn't hard to use, you're just not good with it bro.  You get a ton of control right before you begin to sprint, so it's easy to land if you know what you're doing.  Also, you can stop charging whenever you want, so if you keep colliding with things that's on you.

Try again bucko.

David, Bill and Tap could probably beat the living shit out of a few of the killers just by themselves.
---
Doctor, trapper, maybe even hag, and a solid three gen endgame would be prime for dying light.
---
I like to use it in anti healing builds as well, on killers like ghostface and wraith. Paired with sloppy and maybe even thana they'll heal for a long time, making your easier first hit quite deadly.

instead of adapting this community just deems a killer or perk worthless after a few balances and the devs said that they may do one more change anyways so can you guys not get ur panties in a twist

There's too many to cover, but for an example of what I've been enjoying recently, Blood Echo Legion, where you stack duration add-ons or combine them with one of the Pins to afflict survivors with either the Broken or Mangled status effect, try and injure as many survivors as early as possible before you commit to a chase, and then can go for chases on survivors that most of the time won't have Exhaustion perks at their disposal anymore. It feels great not to have to worry about Dead Hard.
---
More generally, I enjoy Infectious Fright + Barbecue gameplay, where I will slug if Fright procs and hook if it doesn't, Barbecue then giving me the next target. It's a low-downtime chase-centric build that is also efficient and effective, especially on certain killers or if combined with Knock Out. I also enjoy it on Legion, combining it with Third Seal, Monitor &amp; Abuse and stacked duration add-ons. With the duration and Monitor, you aim to spread your Third Seal to survivors as fast as possible, and can then start slugging, with which Fright + Monitor is obviously again a great synergy.
---
That's my reasoning for using ruin?  
---
A ton of people consider ruin at red ranks mandatory, you might not see it that way but that is not an opinion unique to otzdarva.
---
Should i tell him?
---
KOBE!
---
&gt;Sad part about this is I still somehow ranked up. Not sure what happened there
---
Partial Gatekeeper if you ran around to initiate chase because others were doing gens.
---
Silver Unbroken if you simply exist long enough in a match.
---
Benevolent if you successfully escape the Killers grasp.
---
Evader for chases and simply standing in proximity of them every second.
---
GF is indeed a little taller
---
Cool Idea but I do have a problem with some of them
---
Curse of The Third Seal: It should have a duration for that survivor instead of just permanent blindness
---
Curse of Thrill of the Hunt: again a duration. 
---
these 2 for your idea are currently inflict permanent negative status effects that severely hinder the survivor who is simply helping out their team. I don't feel like you should be punished this harshly for simply giving your team a helping hand.
---
I have no problem with Curse of Haunted grounds. You should be able to use a perk at least once in a match and having all the survivors hide from you 90% of the time your Haunted Grounds activates is kind of annoying.
---
I mean it's cool but 1. What's with the sword, 2. Cosmetics are kinda based on the killer backstory
---
Works pretty often on PC too. It gets quite awhile to break the habit of blinking on top of survivors.
---
Meg actually looks like Ace
---
This ain't accurate a lot of killers are slouching or they fold like a lawn chair for no reason
---
Thanks I love it
---
The first Jojo meme I haven't downvoted in years. Nice work.
---
Hillbilly is suppost to be taller than trapper
---
im a survivor main and i feel like the nerf was to hard now im not toxic survivors so im not like x killer needs nerfed no i learn how to play against them
---
Come on. The artistic dimension doesn't reach its fullest if you don't eat the masterpiece. The art is not about showing. Its about **experiencing**
---
Take comfort in the fact that those games were probably a safety pip for the killer.
---
Well if they are valid, another thing is that they are disgusting and inefficient actions, the good thing is that both have their punishments
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with this. Just have to watch how you play loops and it‚Äôs her a lil more carefully cause her phase walk is a lil more static now

the only way this could've been better is if it was shot in landscape. otherwise great! Thanks for sharing!
---
thanks!
---
Did you just turn yourself into a survivor? Lol
---
Thanks!
---
unlike Billy Oni can much easier control his power and doesn't get smashed on walls and have to charge his power again. 
---
don't get me wrong, i fukin hate Billy and everything about him, but Oni is ridiculous. where a good Billy is just HARD to counter, good Oni(before recent change) IMPOSSIBLE to counter in chase.
---
Thank You!
---
How do I get this power?
---
Cause its f*cking weird
---
As a killer main myself I find gen rushing to be a myth just like what people call tunneling is a myth. Survivor goal is to get gens done. In order to counter this ruin is ok but the spawn is always trash. You‚Äôre better off running perks like discordance to force them to do gens 1 person per gen, tremor to see what gen is being worked on when you go to hook, bbq for the same reason as tremor but without a cool down and without the blocked of gens not being used. Let the survivors have 2-3 gens on one side of the map by applying pressure and forcing them to go where you want. Once that‚Äôs done the only gens left will be in a close vicinity to each other and you‚Äôll be able to easily guard them. Don‚Äôt engage in extended chases just hit and run. Run nurses as well so when you hit someone on a gen that is almost done, you‚Äôll catch them in the bushes or behind a wall right near the gen trying to heal cause they‚Äôll surely come back if they think you‚Äôre gonna leave. At this point they‚Äôll try to jump gen to gen but having them focused in 1 area will allow you to pick them off 1 by 1. Only strategy that I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs fool proof when done correct against these powerful swf groups that coordinate perfectly.
---
Yeah..happened on the map "the game" and vs a leather face. I could hear the killer hitting a gen, wasn't sure from where. Few minutes pass, hear the clanging again. Go to a gen, start working on it. Suddenly get pulled off 1 second after working on it.  I was so confused at the time, but apparently he was bugged so he was stuck in the gen and couldn't move, but his character model was elsewhere on the map (he was invisible to us). 
---
Safe to say,  repayment for un bugging him when i literally got pulled off with 0 counterplay was getting hooked :D
---
Freddy with BBQ+C, PGTW, Surveillance, and Discordance. My main goal isn't survivors, but generators. I guard them and drop stuff to go protect them, drawing the match out for a while if it goes in my favor. I've won games because of PGTW.
---
###BALANCE
---
**Chance**
---
‚Ä¢ The chance system has been updated. Survivors are now able to decide exactly what item and add-ons they will find when completing a chest search. 
---
‚Ä¢ The number of chests to spawn on each map by default has been increased to the number of hooks x3.
---
‚Ä¢ Survivors now have a 100% chance of freeing themselves from the hook and The Trapper‚Äôs traps. 
---
‚Ä¢ All of The Pig‚Äôs reverse bear traps will now be linked to only one Jigsaw Box. We felt this change was needed as searching 4+ boxes is too much work, I mean seriously, 4? Are you kidding?
---
‚Ä¢ Skill Checks Will now trigger every 2 seconds when repairing, healing, and sabotaging. The Great Skill check success zones now cover the entire circle. Failing to succeed a skill check will result in a participation award and a warm glass of milk.
---
‚Ä¢ Bloodpoints have been replaced with our new currency, Casino Chips. No, they don‚Äôt do anything, it‚Äôs just related to luck and gambling now.
---
‚Ä¢ The point emote has been replaced with Ace‚Äôs signature pose. Performing this emote within The Killer‚Äôs line of sight will stun them for 45 seconds. This emote has a cooldown of 0 seconds.
---
‚Ä¢ Chance is now the key gameplay component. Welcome to the dark ages, gambling fans! 
---
**The Ace in Your Hole Chapter is available now, everywhere.**
---
Sounds about right!
---
The basis for the perks were based on what I had on me. The name is random, and the "backstory" is just a very generic person aside from what is happening.
---
Uh oh *roar*
---
Bhvr probably won‚Äôt fix it tho. I‚Äôm sure we can all agree that a killer will never be allowed to be a strong anti looper for long
---
Start shining your flashlight at their face towards the end of the pickup animation (right before they throw the body on top of their shoulder)
---
If only I had this installed, my life would be complete
---
The ghostface was literally camping the basement with 1 person already dead at 4 gens left. Most ghostface's play like this, he has a cool power, but is usually unfun to play against because this is what most of them do.
---
Good the way it's meant to be
---
Im aware that killer powers need balancing. But nothing majorly over powered has been taken away from killers. And the only nerfs that ever happen to survivors are majorly over powered stuff. Instead of taking away infinites and just changing the main building that is the infinite, they just make it so you can only do it 3 times which is still so much time wasted. Killers powers like oni was NOT over powered, survivor mains who just cry and whine because their run in a circle simulator was changed and they have ti change their playstyle because its not m1 circle time. But when killers get nerfed and we complain about the nerfs its always just adapt you will be fine with it but survivors cant adapt because they just whine and complain. Its so stupid that the cater to green rank players and balance for that rank. Eventually they will get better and get out of that rank so devs should balance for red ranks where gen speed is out of control. But according to devs gen speed is fine and you just need to apply more pressure. Meanwhile I spend 30 seconds looking for a survivor and 3 seconds chasing them then I down them (as if it only takes 30 seconds to down a survivor with all these insane loops with no counterplay) then 10 seconds to get them hooked. If we look on the bright side I might have pop and see them on the other side of the map with bbq but the time im over there the gen pops. Now what. Devs don't understand their game or their player base
---
When you get hit by the bottle and you became exposed.

The current emblem system is just really jacked up when it comes to most Killers that don't have to 2 hit Survivors to down them. The system is based around "2 hits to down, 3 hooks per Survivor, 6 chases/hits per Survivor" which means that you lose lots of emblem playing Killers that don't follow those "rules" and get punished. 
---
It's dumb because if you hook a Survivor and their team just let's them die on the first hook, you lose emblems. If a Survivor DCs, you lose emblems. If you down a Survivor in one hit (Plague/chainsaws/exposed/Oni/whatever) you lose emblems. If you're playing a Killer that requires setup and loses Gens in the process (mainly Trapper) you lose Emblems.
---
Almost everything about the current emblem system is pretty stupid honestly, and needs a rework.
---
üÖ±Ô∏èASS
---
Yes, I did
---
I like doing this with stealth killers so I don't have to look for the last survivor. It works as long as they don't have a key.
---
It can take, but so far I've just heard that Killer side is having to wait a while. They did make the mistake of region-locking connections, though.
---
I don't see how fewer players overall would attract toxic ones, though, and DbD had P2P for years.
---
Maybe post this on their forum so the devs actually see it.
---
I mean, she has been the second strongest killer for a year (and still is), so it kind of goes against your statement...
---
Yeah exactly and the mossy statues aswell. I went there.
---
Just tap. It's basically the same speed as hitting 3 goods while doing it normally with ruin.
---
thats really cool
---
Usually the killers hatch close cancels the survivors hatch escape even if they are mid-animation. But sometimes, in a really laggy lobby the survivor might still escape.
---
The killer misplayed, he shouldn't have grabbed
---
The way I‚Äôve been told is if you can easily be killed, you drop your item in exchange for your life
---
It is! Also you can use "–±–∞–±—É–ª—è" if you want to say "granny" in a heartwarming way and "–±–∞–±—É–ª—å–∫–∞" to say the same but in a bit mocking kind of way
---
I call shenanigans. No way you faced that many Hags.
---
The third eye was one of many design tropes used for Oni masks, I love that it was incorporated so well into Oni‚Äôs design. also happy cake day.
---
You still get the points if you stun too early
---
Added a Ugly Sweater Susie to the links.
---
That‚Äôs how basment trapper works!
---
The extra minute we spend in the lobby won't kill you, relax my friend, enjoy the campfire and drink some water
---
The way people want to redesign the perk is to make it only useful for a hyper-specific situation to the point where it won't be useful. If you realize just how fast a killer can eliminate a survivor from the match just by proxy-camping a hook and going directly for them, you would know why a perk like this and BT are necessary. Even if the survivors don't have them, just the chance of these perks being there is healthy for the game, also it shouldn't matter if the survivor is using DS like this, they are utilizing the perks they have.
---
Should Borrowed Time not activate if the killer isn't exactly face camping? Should Dead Hard only be able to be used when the killer swings and not be used to gain distance? Should any anti-slug perk only activate if the killer is actually slugging and not when they are being distracted by another survivor on them? Inversely, should dull totems only spawn if the killer is running NOED, should survivors be notified if you have Discordance or Surveillance? How about BBQ?
---
There are dozens of perks on each side that encourage both survivors and the killer to take into account these things and play around them even if the perk isn't even being used, and I don't think that's really a bad thing, it allows for more dynamic games and makes for exciting moments in the game.
---
Oh man. Nothing I ever see makes me want to come back.
---
When i enjoyed the game, which is almost each game.
---
When the last Survivor is someone i remember doing anything that pissed me off ingame, ill take my deserved 4K
---
Some people lower their rank because of the wait times at high ranks. Some people depip if they struggle at the rank they‚Äôre at. It‚Äôs shitty but people do it.
---
Hey look, no one cares
---
It‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm new and I tend to stay away from communities that are overly toxic. I‚Äôve lost interest in league because of this and I‚Äôm losing interest in siege too because of the number of times I‚Äôm last alive and people are shouting at me to get a 5k clutch...
---
I like to relax and play serious enough we try to win, but not to be a dick to anyone. Whether it‚Äôs a friendly survivor who led killer to gen I‚Äôm fixing or if it‚Äôs a killer running some decent ruins looking to ace. 
---
That said I hate hex ruin xD
---
Do Quentin Mains even exist
---
Right here lol.
---
Goddamit
---
That is a lot of Hag, do you play on Console?

I had this happen and all the bp and levels from a game dont count
---
Stop, my dick can get only so erect
---
Yup
---
I know what you're trying to say but we are talking about a video game. Sure, in real life it makes perfect sense to act in a certain nice way and we're conditioned (not sure if that's the right word, english is not my first language) to do so by our parents, teachers and other people but in a video game the people who hold the cards are developers, and after all it is just a game and people should not get so emotionally attached to it, especially for such a casual game like DbD.
---
It's been almost 3,5 years since DbD was released and we didn't see much changes towards the things that players deem toxic like tunneling, camping and so on. There were attempts to change them like slowing the bleeding time for a survivor that's on the hook if a Killer is nearby but it never went live. They added Borrowed Time as a mean to punish a Killer for tunneling but it eventually got nerfed. In my opinion if such things were not dramatically changed so far they are not deemed toxic and even the developers stated on their forum that players should not report others for them. I think that by being angry towards players will change nothing, it adds fuel to the fire making it a vicious cycle.
---
The thing I believe is wrong with this game is that people think social construct of our real life should be applied to the virtual one. There are norms that even I try to hold onto in games &amp; internet in general apart from businesses like formal emails but I believe by making a social environment of games just like in real life takes something away from the game itself. I'm not talking about a freedom of being a douche, we see that plenty of times already, where people act like an asshole stricly on the internet because they can't do it in real life. There are people, that I think are the majority, who play games to escape the reality of real life. Making it the way these angry people who get emotionally attached to the virtual reality and towards people who they never met and probably never will, will kill the nature of a video game. What I'm trying to say - they still can get mad, happy, angry and sad playing games but they shouldn't hold others responisble for it because their safety bubble burst.
---
Obviously I'm not trying to change your opinion, I do see your point, I'm just sharing my opinion, it's the consequences I have to live with for sharing it :)

Got it with the spirt. Last fucker tried to DC, but I hooked him slightly faster. Like I have fun playing with noed for 10 games in a row. Another closest game was with Freddy, and 3 survivors escaped 20 seconds after last gen was done, they probably was on comms because everybody escaped ASAP, not giving me even a chance to hook a guy, and it's with 4 of them alive! DAMN this challenge made me angry.
---
To add to what's already been mentioned, part of generating pressure on the survivors to keep them from doing gens is knowing when to slug. If you down some one and can easily get some one else? Slug. You have one person on the ground, one person the chase and soon hooked hopefully, which means at least one person has to save those two and possibly both of them. You can't be everywhere at once but you can use slugging to occupy a good chunk of the team.
---
Plus once you get a feel for how quickly downed survivors recover you can be even more efficient with your slug, knowing when to head back for that first downed survivor so you can hook them as well.
---
Another big thing is knowing which gens just aren't worth defending, or what areas aren't worth chasing into. The Asylum in the center of Lunacy Ward is a primo example. It's extremely safe, don't chase survivors in there unless you're ready to eat through four safe pallets or you don't have another option. Let them have the generator inside it for the same reason.
---
You're not always going to be able to corral survivors into a neat compact three gen setup, but you don't want to waste precious time defending every generator. Pick and choose, and ideally force them to reach the end game with only unsafe generators.
---
Dry them out for Survivor Jerky
---
If you are talking about yourself, that's okay! You'll get better.

Welp, time to change my Exposed Icon to the monkaS emote.

How did you record stats that end on December 13th?

ohhhh dangggg I didn't know that second part. I'll make sure to do one each day for sure.

They did, replaced it with yui and oni‚Äôs trailer. I wish it was random each time, it would add some variety.
---
Time to review bomb the Entity on Yelp.
---
what about some of the killers? the wrace? the shace?? the ace face???
---
Where's Kase?
---
If you put a certain add on on maps you can press space while using it to leave that light for others to see
---
The difference is, windows can be used throughout the trial no matter what, pallets are a one time use. Sure, you might be able to loop a killer on a pallet, but once it's used, that's it.
---
I ALWAYS try to run windows rather than pallets if given the choice.
---
Not arguing over the strength of bamboozle one way or the other, but it has it's uses.
---
I think it‚Äôs more of a problem where it spawn usually the killer has a priority closing it when a standoff does happen
---
I never get scared no matter who they are or how they are dressed, its just cosmetics. a P3 claudette could be equally skilled to a default quentin or even a legacy skin. Only really intimidated when a SWF appears cus that means I gotta be sweaty (in almost always in red ranks)

Have you ever played killer?

I only use them when I have the daily for it and even then I usually just mori one person so I can get a decent score at the end of the game.

---
I‚Äôm just saying it started there.  Pretty much every multiplayer game that includes a versus mode and a crouch function has included this.  Fighting games, shooters, etc.
---
When you cleanse ruin, pop 3 gens, do unhooks and heals, distract killer only to get hooked in the end and die while blendettes are hiding in a bush.
---
No camping is just a lame way to play. Camp and tunnel is often what inexperienced players do. Because it takes little effort and at low ranks a good payoff.
---
Good killers will apply more pressure rather than standing around the hook.
---
Like any game rely. Look at CoD, camping is an easy strategy used by people who often are too inexperienced or just not good enough to win any other way.

I know it doesn‚Äôt, but urban still boosts your crouch speed which is why I use it - speedy boi

Maybe be able to swap killers, you control one while others 3 would be "hiding" in the corners of the map and be able to notify you if survivor comes to close and stays in their fov for too long. Like imagine one of the members sitting in a shadowy corner, just surveiling around.
---
But he controls better on console now right?
---
Yeah, especially if the survivor is just standing by a pallet instead of running to another pallet or vault to actually do some counterplay against her.
---
She‚Äôs super strong around loops of you know hitboxes and angles. Everyone doubts that I can hit stuff on console but when I do they‚Äôre shocked. Ya just gotta know your stuff, I think.
---
theres a certain time and place where you know when to sacrifice yourself. I would have quit it while she hit me then finished it to save myself

I feel like oni should be tallest by far

I think this works better on Wraith - Nutcrackers are generally wooden, and Wraith is made of wood.
---
Someone else in a different post suggested something like this, that they would go to the nearest tile and patrol around it's border along the line, and if you came into their line of sight within a certain distance (like enough to begin a chase) the killer would get a notification.
---
They got Jason, so it's a better game

That'd be me, literally.
---
The title is clearly sarcastic.
---
i wouldve thought its easy for them to put out each fix on every platform as soon as its ready for one
---
If the gates are open secure your kills. As a killer I‚Äôve gotten quite few 3k‚Äôs during the end game because survivors try to underestimate me and unhook right in front of my face vs escaping. Just don‚Äôt do it before then lol
---
I'm about a hundred hours in and I'm really getting annoyed. Fixes come later, we're missing two killers whose perks are supposed to be available, match ruining bugs. 
---
I feel like I need to keep playing because I bought the Premier rift or whatever but it can really get infuriating
---
Whenever someone DC's right after I catch them it pretty much screws over the rest of the team. I always feel bad for the rest and let them escape and farm.
---
Are you certain that your friend was hit after the perk activated? Even if it was just a moment after the gen it could have been a server issue. 
---
Other question is are you sure they weren‚Äôt pulled off a door, out of a locker, or during a vault?
---
Well unfortunately any remotely difficult challenge will always feel like luck, dead by daylight is a game that heavily relies on RNG after all. And any none master challenge is supposed to be a big of a grind because the tomes are supposed to last mid-chapter to mid-chapter. And as for ruining the solo survivor experience, I did all my survivor challenges solo, did I get upset once or twice? Absolutely, but in no way was my experience ruined.
---
Correct. I questioned myself when I 1st saw it but, the killer hit someone and it was all normal. We rescued and left , nothing crazy. I saw a hex totem in the corner and figured it was Thrill of the hunt or something... But the only hex perk the killer had was NOED. ... It was crazy
---
no fun for killers eh

Honestly, they should just change it so that you drop blood orbs when you are downed or hooked.

It‚Äôs a teleportation ring. Stand in it for 2 min and you get warped to safety. Just don‚Äôt get caught by the killer.
---
Yea, a fucking lot to be honest. rank 5 at the time
---
Depends how many you've killed, if there's two people left when the gates open, no need to camp, if you've already killed one or if you haven't killed any, camp one, the others will escape anyway

Thanks for replying. It‚Äôs frustrating because there‚Äôs absolutely no way to contact them! It also is sketchy they have an incorrect phone # on their website.... I also will be filing a dispute w my credit card if I don‚Äôt hear from them by the end of this week.  Thanks for trying to tag some of the DBD team. Hopefully someone can address these issues because right now I feel scammed. It‚Äôs funny bc I almost ordered a hoodie off of amazon but I wanted to get ‚Äúofficial‚Äù merchandise and support the DBD game. Ridiculous.
---
that's not a gf main that's a braindead stealth camper
---
i saw a killer running this minus myc, it was still terrifying and we all died
---
Lmao why survivors believe a killer should follow their rule book no one knows
---
Ok so it really depends on what killer you mean. I bring NOED when the character doesn't have all 4 slots. For my GF i bring I'm all ears, Franklin's, BBQ, and \[REDACTED\]
---
I generally play whatever addons cos idc about them.   
---
I start stalk asap. That way nobody knows if I spawn near them. I then wander around and listen for gens being worked on. When I hear them being worked on I try to get a good point where not everyone can see me. If it works I either go straight for a hit to not alert other players, or stalk and get the hit. I use Franklin's to knock their boxes and lights. I'm all ears for chase advantages. when they get hooked i use BBQ for bp and maybe finding people
---
My boi wraith can climb the Eiffel fucking tower
---
Hi, also perfectly correct here but you opt in when you start the game the first time. This seems to be just a communication because the terms have changed. 
---
Any Service can be completely restricted if you dont accept the terms of Service. Pornwebsite example?
---
I thought I was going insane too. I remember laying traps down, walking forward and not triggering the trap.
---
All I see is improvement
---
No that is a desperate bug. What happened her was two traps too close together. The second he stood on one the other would catch him keeping him stuck switching between traps
---
10/10
---
I can never bring myself to kill anyone.  I usually max all points except sacrifice though.  I usually only kill toxic players.  I‚Äôm just not a good killer.
---
Nah... more important for the survivors to have something to bitch about post game.  Had teams that sabo'd every hook near basement and would run there trying the good will of the killer.   If you basement hook, you are abusing glitch.  If you slug them, you are a toxic, boring killer.
---
It was Freddy
---
Mine are ghostface, legion and clown
---
I like the realism with the spanish girl having family issues lmfao
---
Play how you want, not with made up rules.
---
He‚Äôs fine on console just takes some time  getting used to
---
Yeah I‚Äôm certain haha. He hooked a slugged guy after we opened the doors so he could use that annoying Freddy perk.
---
Aces breathing tho
---
I realized how tasty Ace is when he takes up space.
---
I read that you said it's Freddy, in just telling you that plague can hide it for future reference
---
Forgot Oni
---
No. It didn‚Äôt tell me he had NOED. It does that when he hits someone with NOED
---
I don't really understand what you're trying to say in relation to what I said.
---
Avoid the basement when you're injured.  If you're healthy and you get whacked looping the shack move on to another location with a pallet, the speed boost should you get you basically to the next spot.
---
Yea makes sense I just feel like they should make it different when acquiring emblems for killers with different playstyles like the plague so its actually rewarding to play Killers that aren't as popular like her.
---
the colours in those trees are beautiful
---
Oh well that‚Äôs annoying

I didn't mean to repost by any means. I saw this picture on a non-English website that was not remotely related to dbd. So I thought I might post it on Reddit.

Yesno

Nope.

Yea this makes it even harder to get emblems when survivors let a teammate die on first hook.

Just run out and move onto the next game

Why would you even be on a single gen with three people when there's ruin and you know you can't hit it? Just split up

---
Where can I download this
---
Why you post this?
---
To be honest though when you look at all the models in game oni is the biggest from what I‚Äôve seen
---
It's alright. 2 things that are kinda sucky is not getting credit (which doesn't matter much, memes get around and come back here eventually) and they're usually weirdly compressed after a year or two.
---
But again, it's all good dude.
---
Yeah, fair. I play the way I do because it's not fun for me when I camp and it's not fun for the survivors either.
---
Was the person he downed already injured?
---
If you tap you basically signal this to your teammates :
---
"Not only am I boosted, I am also absolutely unwilling to try and improve"
---
No offense but if someone just urban evades all over the map and gentaps I never save them. Same for p3 claudettes. No regrets
---
For me it‚Äôs been nonstop Trappers all the time, it‚Äôs getting really annoying.

---
She's the same height as him.
---
My brother taps and is very good at the game. He keeps killers chasing him for a minute or more all the time.
---
I didn't have any DC in the games... Although my first 2/3 games starting after this the survivors kept quitting. In one match I killed one at the Meat Plant and the other 3 were being very immersive and eventually quit since I kept patrolling gens and kicking them since I couldn't see anyone. The next game had a DC during the loading. Aftet that, everything was fine as far as connecting.
---
Honestly Doc is pretty tall for just a human, and to be able to keep up with supernatural beings like Demo and Myers is kinda amazing.
---
I struggle to see how this would address a camping Bubba, for example, who's going to get snared where he wants to be anyway. And in the endgame, this would mean no sacrifices, essentially.
---
Is this accurate?
---
Thought oni was taller for some reason lol
---
i know im a survivor main and im not like oh im shit against plague nerf nerf nerf no i learn how to counter her
---
About 20-25$
---
See no point really in dumping much money into this game, I like very little stuff cosmetic wise and I also don't wanna throw money at BHVR considering game's health.
---
I main GF and I hope that's how most survivors feel when they play against me. I get hateful messages sometimes though, so who knows, maybe I'm just toxic.
---
Alright then, I'll be changing all curses that last the remainder of the trial and instead put a duration since many people have said this was an issue
---
Haha.. not me.. ha ha ha......
---
pretty job far
---
also before they accidentally removed her lunge after phase entirely but it was put back yesterday so that might have affected some people
---
I have to say you're in the minority there most people I have played with and spoke ln too tend to agree that they hate the estate because it's small and the loop points are easily broken.
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
The removal of her collision has just made average Spirits become bad, those of which only got to high ranks because of it. Good Spirits remain unbothered.
---
If you‚Äôre getting 3/4 people every game messaging you cause they don‚Äôt like the way you play killer, that‚Äôs honestly on them. 
---
I play console too and used to get harassed with messages when I used things like noed but stopped using hoe perks like that and just played fairly and guess what, I still got constant messages. 
---
Change your settings if it‚Äôs that much of an issue, someone is always going to have something to bitch about especially on console I think because dedicated servers still haven‚Äôt been implemented and it just goes off the killers WiFi, on the other note we don‚Äôt have after game chat to talk; you have to go out of your way to message people on Xbox and if they do they usually say something v reportable. Those are my thoughts on it hope I helped
---
Or maybe they love it so much that they can't get enough of it?ü§î

A WHOLE MINUTE OH BOY!

Yeah I always get Blood Lodge with Freddy, Disturbed Ward with Myers, and Father Campbell's with everyone else

If you play killer don't worry about what the survivors think. 90% of survivors don't care if you're having a good time or not.

Borrowed Time punishes campers pretty hard.  Unless the person you juyst unhooked with it is a complete potato, they should be able to use that 15 seconds to at least get to a pallet/window/jungle gym to loop them.   They can also tank the hit with the endurance effect still up to get the speed boost.  
---
There's also decisive strike.
---
I fucking hate shit like this.
---
If you're gonna end the game end it, stop wasting my life. If you wait at hatch for the killer to see if stand in the door way as survivor when everyone else has left, or do this shit as killer, fuck you. You're the reason people DC. They don't want to deal with your bullshit wasting their lives.
---
i played him last night.   now, i'm on console so take that for its worth but he's better now.   the turning is still tough  but not impossible to actually follow someone if they take a 45 degree turn.
---
So far, 0. I got it free on PS+ and I'm enjoying it.
---
I won't buy anything until I get a bit better in the game and the game is stable enough for my tastes (no bugs and decent balace and rank reset).
---
When I start playing, I got a lot of errors on menus, but these recent updates seem to have fixed it most of them.
---
lets see, i got the base game, all licensed dlcs at half price or so, and 1100 ac for the premium rift, 40/50 bucks total maybe
---
Look Ma! No hands!
---
Quality post
---
Not the author of the comment, but I had the same idea. What my idea was, is that you start bleeding AFTER your first down/hook.
---
If all three people are working on gens, that's at least 2 gens done with one chase. The chase ends because the killer gives up a lot. No idea why you feel the need to be sarcastic.
---
Good point. Too bad I only have OBS Studio, snipping tool, and Google Slides to work with this image. Maybe next time I‚Äôll clarify it to be in-menu height or something.

I main GF but I get games like this where the survivors are literally standing right there around the corner waiting for me to hook their buddy so they can unhook them. Then ofc I chase them and get hateful messages calling me a camper. Like... if I see you right there I'm not going far from the hook. Not sure what they expect?
---
I don't know if its new but the Clown has a Santa outfit
---
Jesus fucking Christ

Hey man I know this gonna get hated it is in you Bill cosmetics it's free

There‚Äôs like at least four leaked Christmas skins not just elf Dwight
---
Not toxic. People who say it is toxic are stupid. And I mainly play survivor.
---
Yeah I believe that came out last year? If I‚Äôm not mistaken, I didn‚Äôt really play dbd that much during Christmas time last year
---
I bought the game and every DLC for it. The only "cosmetic" I've bought is the rift pass, but that's mainly because I play this game enough to know I'll get my money back from that.
---
Charger noises intenstify.
---
Oof do you have a link? On one of the leaks I saw, it was just the elf Dwight
---
Mileage may vary... but I see this often myself as well. Both as killer and survivor I'd say at least 1 DC every 3rd match and a suicide on hook every other game.
---
Is this normal I don't know but its been my experience between ranks 1-8.
---
Demagorgon are female demogorgon. e.g. ‚ÄúLook at that school of demagorgon!‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúLook at that school of demogorgon.‚Äù
---
Yeah it happens a lot. Some will even DC depending on which killer they're facing. Sucks but who am I to tell them what to do? Just too bad they can't just finish a match, and if they lose, just take the loss and move on.
---
It doesn‚Äôt require ‚Äúincredibly luck‚Äù to find the hatch when you‚Äôre actively looking for it, then it starts yawning when it‚Äôs opened. Even if that weren‚Äôt the case, regardless of how hard it may or may not be to use, being able to just hit a button that lets you win when the game is already skewed in your favor is absurd
---
The more I think about it, doc stands straight during treatment and slouches during punishment. So he‚Äôll be definitely shorter than wraith during punishment.
---
I am sarcastic because your point doesn't make any sense
---
By your logic you should literally worship the ground I walk on and listen to everything I say because I've looped killers for five gens when my friend and I had two teammates dc and it was only him left to do the gens
---
Ah nevermind. I just started playing clown so I only saw it last night and thought it might be new. Wish I could give you a better answer!
---
Yes that costume was from last year.
---
$44 not including the $20 it cost for the game itself on the Xbox store. I‚Äôve bought all killers and believe it or not am a survivor main but I like having the different play styles at my disposal when I‚Äôm trying to get some bp.
---
I appreciate the inclusion of both Frank and Julie, now what about Susie and Joe?
---
Him talking about stuff he has no clue about and commenting on it is not good.
---
Like his ego went skyhigh and that really killed it. He thinks he is some intellectual. I liked his old content tho and I can honestly say that I literally watched all his stuff in a day because it was so good.
---
rip thx for the heads up
---
If it glows it goes.
---
It's five total. Elf dwight, kind of a biker Meg, winter hiking Nea, basically Yui in a jacket, and a northern based Oni. You can find their store portraits on one of the most recent Leaks by Daylight posts
---
As someone who plays trapper and killer primarily I appreciate that there are players like you.
---
stab=tunnel
---
Yes PLEASE , as a doctor main i really would love that
---
I hope well at least get the Christmas decorations and shit
---
Not to mention, the animation was so systematic. It's hard to think that a player could repeat those actions in such a perfect pattern. Would require pixel perfectness each time.
---
Check out my Ol‚Äô switcharoo
---
Or new to killer, as the season is over tomorrow and your still rank 14
---
Legion is actually quite a good killer, and anyone who tunnels with them is a moron. I've seen a lot of random legions at all ranks, and I honestly believe a whole lot of the "issues" with legion (from the killer side, as the meta if the killers power when talking about survivors id a whole other issue) is mainly predicated on misuse and misunderstanding of the killer.
---
The amount of pressure you can out on a map. The amount of heal time you can force. It's not something the majority of killers can replicate without specific builds and add-ons.
---
Which chapters?
---
I use urban evasion with sprint burst. Works for me so far
---
She‚Äôs not an automatic 4k anymore.
---
I'd rather give the benefit of the doubt than ruin some poor survivor's game when they were just trying to have fun.

She used to be played at least 30-40% of the time on console (Xbox) before the Oni and the patch but after that I kid you not I‚Äôve seen her twice. I play dbd daily with friends and we all have the same consensus for that. I‚Äôm glad, honestly one of my least favorite killers because she was just so op but now idk.
---
To much, to much, I think I have ¬£10 outfit for every killer
---
Red ranks looking at what‚Äôs obviously haunted grounds
---
The past week I killed myself on hook and it was always because I saw teammates do extremely stupid things.
---
I kinda feel bad about it but sometimes I just wanna move on to the next game :D
---
all those childrens she ate made her brain way too big
---
Sorry for bad link format but there‚Äôs huntress reindeer skin and meg skin that looks like Kate as well as a new year skin for Claudette and billy
---
I have every dlc except oni and probably 20 to 30 dollars of AC
---
Gotta be tall enough to puke over those loops.
---
I hope not, the hillbilly I believe had this same bug in the beginning and had to be removed because it‚Äôs not realistic nor fair. My guess is no.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve only seen her twice too. It‚Äôs kind of nice knowing spirit isn‚Äôt pretty much pay to win anymore. I never see killers on console trying out different killers with interesting builds or anything. It‚Äôs almost like console killers just want to run whatever is going to guarantee them a win without having to try
---
I didn‚Äôt even realise lol!
---
Ash is in Broforce..
---
Where you can kill Satan
---
Oh np! Thank you, the new cosmetics look sick but they‚Äôre all for characters I don‚Äôt main besides Claudette üò≠
---
You are not a clown.  You are the entire circus.
---
um, idk about that Chief.
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm gonna sink some bps in to getting it, but I do worry it would just delay the inevitable as they‚Äôd surely just go after me again?
---
I think they are increasing the turn rate, but no he won‚Äôt ever be able to 180 again.
---
You know what I think you‚Äôre absolutely right!

Is she really that bad now? Haven‚Äôt played her yet since the nerf
---
Not a bad idea, this is what I use characters for as survivor. My David is my farm build, Ace is loot build, etc. It would be nice to have as a feature tho
---
Cant wait to see all the GoOd OnI pLaYeRs CaN sTiLl MaKe HiM wOrK posts. Its a pattern at this point. Killer is performing well and has strong tools that can actually deal with survivors -&gt; people complain -&gt; killer gets nerfed -&gt; posts about the nerf not being so bad/ needs more nerfs to address the ‚Äúreal problem‚Äù -&gt; posts asking why they only encounter nerfed killer 1/20 games.
---
You might not agree with it but it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy.

I wonder if Kobe Bryant plays this game and if he in fact Kobes..... does he yell out ‚ÄúME!‚Äù ü§îü§îü§î

Well who's the idiot here then.

What program did you use to draw this?
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 4 months. I‚Äôve played against him twice.
---
How did that look?
---
Eat fresh
---
what does that mentality have to do with this post
---
I need the download link!
---
I love playing as Hag on that map because you literally cannot see a goddamn thing
---
You know how many times I've tunneled Jane??? Like...I can't get enough of her &gt;_&gt;
---
Can‚Äôt beat em join em
---
I disagree to an extent. His flick feels slightly better on console now due to the controller change but you have to do it later in the animation. The difference definitely isn‚Äôt substantial though imo.
---
LoL
---
Take your hand and skip the names
---
Bro the people who crouch every 3 seconds are so bad. I had an argument with someone who would urban evasion across the map, never took bt hits, did no gens, and other sins. She said that I dont know how to be stealthy meanwhile I only died because she left me on the hook to get 2 hooked.
---
but 90? as he was before the "fix"
---
Claudette no, please. It's an Ultra Rare with a Milky Glass and Weaved Ring.. ;-;
---
oh chill dude...
---
Oni was pretty dumb tbh but they've left other killers in far dumber spots before.
---
Yeah!  Some people just get rock hard at the prospect of eating 4 decisive strikes every match and non-stop borrowed times.  Woot!
---
I play Xbox and for the most part people stick around because they‚Äôre swf or want their bloodpoints. All I know is if I just played 10 mins of dbd I wouldn‚Äôt want to throw the whole game just because I got down. At the worst I‚Äôm killing myself on hook if I‚Äôm that butthurt but it takes me a lot to get there (face-camping, hardcore tunneling). At least now as a survivor you get a little bit of points if you‚Äôre ditched by shitty teammates.
---
Three sacks of gems, or ¬£1.20 paypal
---
Blursed
---
exacly LOL, realistic just makes the game more limited and less interesting.
---
I change my build almost every match. I would go crazy if I ran the same exact perks every single match lol. When I play survivor tho I always go against Freddy‚Äôs and Ghostfaces with the typical gen slowing perks. Nothing new or interesting, just whatever is easy and effective. Don‚Äôt see how they have fun

Probably over 150. I've bought a lot of cosmetics plus the base game.

The only toxic one I see here is you. Man had full battery meaning he literally just found the flashlight at the end of the game. Calm your clam kid
---
Not realistic in terms of gameplay. Not real life. Stooped.
---
Well i tried sending a link to a pic but it got taken down so look up H20 delirious Micheal Myres ptb video. You can see the old lobby in the beginning of the video.
---
Run Decisive to punish tunneling trash.  Saw you don't have it yet.  Get that yestersay.  I don't even consider taking it off until I hit red ranks because so many killers that don't know any better default to tunneling and without that perk you are defenseless.  Make it a priority to get that.  Play to punish that behavior.
---
It's called having fun, try it
---
Paint tool SAI and photoshop7

Its a meta post about r/deadbydaylight and the memes that get posted here

I want this on console

YEEEES
---
Oh shit.. the white fog looks WAY better
---
They said they gonna bring back flicks, just wait
---
some things are easy to learn and hard to master. 
---
 Most people have already found ways to counter him: drop pallets earlier in loops, stay in shorter loops where he has no space to use dash, try to 360 and 180 when you have nowhere to run, use stones, trees etc where it is extremely hard for him to land a hit, because of how it works. This is for chases. If you just hear Oni screaming and you think that there is a possibility of him coming to you, you just enter a locker. It is useless for Oni in BF to check lockers, as he wastes time checking them and lockers negate one of his most useful perks - Infections fright, so you can save yourself from being snowballed. Sure you stop doing generators for a while, but isn't it better than seeing all your team lying on a floor in 20 seconds, is it?
---
And then he laughs. that deep pulmonary laugh where you can hear his lungs.
---
You got a 4k? How the hell did you not have fun?
---
I have it but sometimes u get cucked
---
Why would you want to delete them?
---
No, I don't think you can refund a DLC. Could be wrong tho.
---
Why do you even want to delete/disable a character? You can just not play that specific character.
---
Design and story, the Doc. followed by good ol billy and the plague. I am also growing really fond of the Oni.
---
Well if you think about it there really was no Halloween update because of the delay and everything. The only thing we really got were the skins, and you could only unlock two with the putrid serum you got from the rift pass. The only thing Halloween about it was basically the lobby
---
Play swf! This is pretty much my only good counter to tunneling sadly without wasting a perk slot.
---
There‚Äôs a program now. We meet on Tuesdays and just kinda talk through the pain and learn to cope.
---
hahahahahahahhahaahhahahha
---
Another Endgame DS, still not considered oversaturated content apparently
---
What about the Huntress? I also like not all of these killers started off bad. The huntress just went insane due to seeing her mother die, and a lack of human content. If she had a companion, she wouldn't turn evil.
---
I do also like the spirit
---
Windstorm speeds him up while cloaked, so if you pop Sprint Burst and *he only dings once* then you'll be moving at 150% for 3 seconds and he'll be moving at 146.5% until he decides otherwise. You won't make much distance on him if he decides to pursue, and that's kind of the reason people use Windstorm.
---
If he fully uncloaks then he'll have a short movement penalty, and then presumably he'll go back into cloak for his 146.5% movement. You'll make a little distance in your 3 seconds, and then he's going to eat it up in the 6 seconds after that.
---
In either event, it's not much of a counter to his speed.
---
What level is your cursor covering?
---
I wonder if they‚Äôre ranked by first encounter? Because they‚Äôre not alphabetical either.
---
I never really understood the Legion tbh
---
Nick Castle played masked Myers and was 5'10. Unmasked Myers was someone else but that's irrelevant cause Nick Castle was on screen almost the whole time. Michael Myers in Halloween 2018(the sequel) is 6'3.
---
Blame the Devs.
---
Rank 11, my bad for a terrible picture
---
Man I had a dream about a killer having the same ability about how the pyro (team fortress) looks at things through his goggles. But I guess it could just as well be a freddy costume with added effects in-game.
---
Yeah, I'm well aware of the 4 flashlight t-bag association and all that nonsense. But just because people are assholes doesn't mean you should treat everyone as if they're going to do that.
---
Still were considered PC exclusives
---
That‚Äôs okay it looked like a bad red rank

Trapper like "What should we do now?"
---
Billy like "NO ONE SHALT PASS!!!!"
---
Epic
---
Trapper makes sense with the challenges for him.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it released on Halloween or the day before? And they said on they‚Äôre Twitter they‚Äôre was going to be a delay a few days before. Didn‚Äôt the rift and archives come with the Halloween update? I think you might just have a unpopular opinion my friend
---
So you wanted them to re-release the codes for console? Obviously its a PC only if the codes were released before consoles had DBD.
---
Good old Tyler. I've seen that video because of my interest in screaming
---
But not letting all 5 gens pop
---
Legion and Huntress (:
---
Maybe in green ranks lol never in red
---
Easier said than done
---
You're lucky then man. I've stopped enjoying playing survivor completely just about.
---
Well now he's fucking impossible to play as. You literally regret when you press his power button
---
Yes, he was strong before, but being able to flick was irreplaceable part of his base kit. Devs said they would bring it back and I hope it's true
---
Bro it was just a prank bro
---
I definitely felt that one.
---
4 percent is still better than 1 percent
---
No one said that. Didn‚Äôt even care about them. I just want the mask for Meg
---
Got it free on PS4, did spend about 25 Euros. Worth every cent (ca. 1500 hours playing time).
---
The update didn‚Äôt even drop on Halloween and the update was a rift update, not a Halloween update because they just wanted to focus on the archives and it‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs a fact. It fucking sucked
---
You could use that same logic to justify almost anything in this game. Mori is an add-on just like any other add-on and you can use it however you like. Noed is a perk just like any other, so you can use it however you like.
---
BHVR uses perks and add-ons to incentivize certain behaviors, like survivors not bothering to cleans totems. NOED has been successful at teaching players to do more than repair gens. Moris get players to just be better than the killer and never get hooked right?
---
DS has little to no true counter than to wait it out. Survivors can use it to body block for other survivors, knowing it'll prevent someone from getting hooked. Survivors can use it like in the video here, which demonstrates a single perk can get 3 people out safely with little chance the killer can do anything. I've even detailed in other responses how this particular situation favors the survivors in almost every way. DS can be used as an invincibility ticket by jumping into lockers so a killer can't even slug, which happens often because people with DS will often play like idiots and run around in the open against a killer knowing they have a free get out of jail card.
---
Nevertheless I do agree that this upcoming Christmas update will be underwhelming.
---
Of course, but that's how you can counter adrenaline
---
Oni. I love everything about him, his cosmetics,story, ability, weapons all that jazz. My second favorite is a tie between Trapper and Good ol Clown because I just have fun playing them and I can't decide which is enjoy more
---
I'm not certain but I think he's mentioned dyslexia in the past but either way this Tweet is clearly someone just being a spiteful cunt.
---
Aren‚Äôt all their seasonal updates tho? I heard Christmas before last was good, idk tho cause I didn‚Äôt start really playing religiously till early this year
---
The point of this post obviously went straight over your head, I encourage you to read some of the other replies and my other comments.   
---
I never questioned DS (or other perks) being in the game and I also never questioned that they are generally healthy for the game, they are and DS is one of the best perk "reworks" they ever did. I just question the fact that you can abuse it to "force" a tunnel, which should not be the case, a survivor with a running DS timer should have it to prevent a tunnel, not to gain a status of virtual immortality.
---
 In another comment, I even mentioned an idea to make DS even more effective to prevent tunneling while removing ways to abuse it:
---
\- Make it deactivate when someone else gets hooked (Why? Because if someone else is hooked, you are obviously not being tunneled)
---
\- In return: Make it infinite (which in technical terms means you can use it 2 times, since you can only get rescued from the hook 2 times, so every tunnel gets punished).
---
Why did he need to be nerfed? As in what part of his power needed to be nerfed? He‚Äôs designed to be a killer of extremes where he‚Äôs one of the worst (if not the worst) killer when he doesn‚Äôt have his power yet but one of the strongest when he does have his power. His power is similar to Hillbilly but he has to go out and earn the power as a m1 killer first. Logically speaking, his power should be noticeably stronger to compensate for this (also it‚Äôs on a timer). If he can get looped on most tiles for half of his power, then what‚Äôs the point of the power? Better map pressure by being Billy with a strafe? At that point, he becomes a ‚Äúwhy not pick Billy instead‚Äù killer. We already have Leatherface for that lol.
---
Also Scott has 2000+ hrs into DBD. He could likely do the same with any arguably top 5 killer if he went on a love binge with them like he did with Oni.
---
Well I explained to you why there were PC exclusives, they were never intended to be PC only clearly by releasing them to everyone. You want a cosmetic from a PC only game that is made by BHVR, clearly you dont deserve it if they dont give it to you
---
I LOVE the idea of this killer. Great anti-loop ability for bhvr to nerf lmao. Seriously tho this would be an incredible killer to play with lots of pressure capability gaining power as the match stretches out
---
Survivor main here, camp away. It's a waste of time for the survivor. If they want to struggle then let them. You're only camping because they chose to delay the inevitable. If a team saves them good for the team, but if they're all teabagging at the gate that's toxic. I've got so many 4ks because survivors would rather teabag then leave. 0k turns to 4k when I activate bloodwarden 30 seconds before collapse üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I always imagined big smoke as an Oni player. Whenever I get demon rage I always shout "YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL"
---
At the end game, it's not worth it. You can replace NOED with any other perk bevause youre essentially playing the whole match with 3 perks until noed activates, and if they got a key then youre fucked. Im telling you, it's not a good perk at red ranks.
---
repost
---
I‚Äôve already tried it yesterday, he can‚Äôt flick 90 degrees. You can‚Äôt go around corners at all.
---
I honestly dont know of your kidding
---
&gt; This Nancy might have just been unhooked and ran right to the Bill knowing she had a get out of jail free card. 
---
Which would be canceled out by the fact I mentioned the DS timer needs to deactivate when someone else gets hooked if it were to be made infinite. Reading all the changes I proposed would have helped here. 
---
&gt; This would also create a larger problem where survivors with DS throw  themselves in front of the killer to prevent someone else getting  unhooked. 
---
Same thing, not possible when it deactivates after someone got hooked. 
---
I feel like you have not read the full post, have you? Or perhaps just missed that line?
---
Lol. This guy doesnt get sex while playing DbD
---
It's Kate tossing a snowball at Dwight while Wraith (with an open mouth????) attempts to kill them both outside of what seems to be Clown's caravan. Once more, you can find it on Leaks by Daylight
---
I only started using it with head on and inner strength for the gimmick dwight locker goblin build.  
---
Now I run quick and quiet without the other two because of the amount of times that juke has worked for me.  Head on was cool and all but most of the time I was just better off letting them leave rather than forcing the stun and starting a new chase.
---
Pig, I like the way she plays, I enjoy the mid game pressure she has and I also like the mind games I can do with her dash attack, the stealth is also nice too.
---
Def the most well thought out killer idea I‚Äôve seen imo. This perk would also help with the crappy ruin rng as it would give the killer much more power late game similar to how Freddy can pressure with his gen teleport ability when there‚Äôs only 1-2 gens left
---
why do the people who play this game act like literal children
---
Works too
---
I play the game through Game Pass on Xbox, but I bought all the chapter DLC (Black Friday sale), and about 5000 auric cells. So I‚Äôm thinking about $120 USD more or less?
---
I like the game, I like the dev team, and I want to support it. So yeah I‚Äôm not afraid of paying extra for stuff if it means the game‚Äôs health will be prolonged, even if just a little bit.
---
Is that a sub Reddit here?
---
I'm guessing anyone who has $14k to spend on decorative food, is happy to throw leftovers away at the end of the night anyway.
---
Have a nice evening. (Or whatever time it is at your place)
---
You'll be happy to know that Huntress is equally agonizing on PC based on her map, it's a little more RNG dependent because sometimes you get all the good tiles to throw hatchets over, but some of them are suffering incarnate.
---
Only a few maps are actually open enough (Autohaven's center area comes to mind) for her hatchets to matter.
---
Rarely.  swfs are usually deathly altruistic.   and solos just hid in a corner for hatch at 4 gens.   If you get the first person on a hook at 5 gens, camping will still easily net you a 3k most of the time.
---
Oh trust me mate that's a rehashed template
---
The old clip that played was even louder imo
---
I need this as a pack. For the lulz.
---
What‚Äôs this about a Doctor rework? I must have missed it
---
Yeah I forgot you have to stay in the post game forever till you are allowed to leave by the survivors.
---
thk who u main
---
There are a few problems with this
---
His one shon is still great when in power but you have even less control than a typical M1. You aren‚Äôt tracking survivors well using blood orbs after a couple of minutes in the match due the orbs being everywhere at that point. I somewhat agree with the heal thing but his power isn‚Äôt particularly scary to deal with right now bc of the flick nerf. You can demon dash over to a survivor and then follow them normally and try to M1 them. 
---
Problem with this is, is that you realistically are only going to be able to do this against survivors who are out in the open for some reason. Think about where most gens are located: near loops. Unless the survivor is just messing around or bad, they are typically going to be near a loop. Oni can dash over there and run the loop like a typical M1 killer and get a down after most of his power is depleted. Get 1 down and then go back to being a normal M1 killer for a while.
---
Which is the problem with current Oni, everything he does in power is only slightly better than Billy but has significantly more restrictions.
---
It‚Äôs not fun being instant downed by a fast moving killer  but the entire fundamental design of Oni is that survivor team get to being significantly stronger than him when he doesn‚Äôt have power but the opposite is true when he does have power. 
---
Now, if you just happened to be the survivor that doesn‚Äôt get seen until he has power, that sucks but there are multiple situations like that in DBD already.
---
I hear the wheezing. The wheezing from his damaged alveoli deep within his airways. I hear the chronic cough and congestion in my nightmares.
---
&gt; Campers tend to stay at the Green ranks and below because of this. So they punish their rank.
---
Which doesn't mean anything.  No rewards, and you still get stuck with the red rank teams because of the lack of killers and shitty matchmaking.  You just occasionally get a break with one.   May as well stay green for fun.

Excluding all the DLC's I've spent around $70

i could imagine meg gets up and slits her own throat as ace and pig look on in horror
---
This was said, not sure how to interpret it though:
---
"While we think these changes are introduced to improve the game, we did hear a lot of feedback on the turn speed and controls changes. We feel there is something to improve there.
---
Our design team is planning on changing the turn rate ratio to improve on the feeling of the Dash, allowing you to freely move your camera within the limit. This will be included in a later update."
---
The worst is people who have names like this and then when I do it, they get mad at me. Like what? This whole operation was your idea.
---
It‚Äôs not just the nerf, 
---
Sounds kind of suck right now
---
Spirit and Wraith and bugged rn and the speed boost out of their power just doesn‚Äôt happen
---
And then there is the nerf on top of that.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre already injured, it still shows the exposed status effect
---
Lmfaoo this is hilarious
---
This is an amazing concept
---
I didn't have *sabotage squads* when I was playing during the duration of the glitch, but I did have this one survivor who actually did fucking break *every single hook around the basement*. I mean every hook, nice large open map, good LOS, I looked around and every single hook from the basement to the visible far edge of the map was broken.
---
Then they used the post-hit speed boost from me injuring them to sprint halfway across the map into the exact middle of the killer shack right by the basement.
---
I just hooked them in the basement, fuck if I'm going to slug someone who did that on purpose.
---
Explain when teabagging as ghost face is permissible
---
I love the huntress's backstory, cosmetics, her unique hum.   
---
Can't stand playing her though, I am so bad with the hatchets.  However, when I do have a good game with her it's more gratifying than getting a 4k with Billy/Myers/Ghostface/etc  
---
Gameplay with probably Michael because it's fun being a M1 killer with almost zero terror radius outside of chase and then the surprise tier 3 play.
---
Meg for her outfits, but I might switch to Yui honestly cause I really like her voice.
---
What I do as a surv and what I love when survs are doing when I'm the killer is hold crouch and slowly move you camera up and down several times, it looks like the surv is nodding in appreciation or thankfully bowing.
---
The problem is that seems like BVHR themselves doesn't know if it was intended or not. They fucked up again only this time I genuinely care what will they do because I fucking love Oni, the first killer I P3
---
ah im a claudette main through and through in solo i‚Äôll sacrifice my self to let a random escape if they weren‚Äôt toxic
---

---
Yep. r/LeaksByDaylight
---
üëª
---
I wish we had more emotes for moments like this. Pointing or tea bagging just don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù the way you want.
---
I play mostly survivor I'd say and theres nothing worse than actually having your game taken from you. What I mean is you wait your 5 minutes for your lobby, you get in, and you get face camped first hook for example for seemingly no reason. I think the problem with it is not only is it skill-less but it's even hurting the killer too. Like noone wins there. 
---
In that case, I would dc. At the end of the day i feel like if someone is purposefully ruining your experience just to do it, it's not something most of us want to be a part of. We also need to take into consideration some people still play games to have fun, yes apparently that's a thing. We've been asking for different non competitive game modes for years. I've dc'd before and I promise it's never to spite anyone. I think everyone including survivors should get bonus blood points if someone dc"s. That way noone is hurt by this. 
---
I've seen it go both ways of course too. It's not really a one sided issue. Heres what I would pitch. DC penalties SHOULD EXIST. However, I offer up the solution of a perk. I feel that maybe half of dc"s atleast from the survivor side take place when they're face camped. This might be more or less but. This perk would slow down your hook meter regression by 50% at tier 3 as long as the killer is within 16 or so meters. 
---
Just some thoughts I dont know. Like I get the necessity but think we need to also address other issues.
---
The main change is going to be the replacement of his static field with a static blast. We don't really know what a static blast is but people are speculating that it's most likely gonna be a terror radius wide shock therapy since he has to build it up. He also got some add-on changes that I can't remember off the top of my head. The only one I remember is Obedience will now cause counter-clockwise skill checks instead of causing Exhaustion to Tier III survivors. Also do remember to take this with a grain of salt, these are leaks and can always change in the future
---
they wasnt scared at all, all the killer has to do is stand on top of it and the killers animation over rides the survivors so it was just the killer being an ass.
---
I like the plag, every game feels different as its up to the survivors how the game goes. whether they cleanse or not, or whether they camp pallets or not.
---
That song fucking sucks.
---
Right now it is really a split between Legion, Oni and Wraith.
---
Camping should never really work. It only works when the survivors are too altruistic for some reason (emblem requirements still kind of suck) or potatoes. Tunneling would actually be the smartest thing for a killer to do if decisive/borrowed weren‚Äôt things. It does ruin the fun for the survivor though.
---
Picking legion is the scumbag move
---
good to know(personally I love playing her most on The Game)üòÑüòÑ
---
Doctor was my first main, I love him but he‚Äôs trash. In a game where killers can‚Äôt waste time Doc needs to waste time building up madness in survivors. This wouldn‚Äôt be too big of a problem if madness actually did something effective, but without add ons it‚Äôs kind of pointless. Random skill checks and Doctor illusions just simply aren‚Äôt enough. Tier 3 takes awhile to build up and is easily snapped out of. 
---
tldr Doc needs good add ons to have his power be effective, and even then he‚Äôs not as strong as most other killers. I will say 3 Gen Doc is extremely powerful, but that gets boring and doesn‚Äôt work if you get bad gen RNG or get a coordinated team.
---
She didn‚Äôt even apologize or sound remorseful what so ever. ‚ÄúOkay you fucks I took it down‚Äù what a bitch
---
Yooo another meme about tunneling
---
Lets all laugh together at this original content
---
Oni has grown tired of these pesky survivors. He now just absorbs their whole ass body instead of their blood.
---
I was joking. He spelled Spirit wrong so I teased him a tiny bit
---
I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs someone else who feels like this game should be played selflessly not selfishly.
---
General Reposti!
---
So you had one survivor not doing any generators, making saves, healing other people, etc.  If they broke EVERY hook then after 3 minutes they respawn, so in your little story did he just break them one at a time?   
---
or did he 99 each and every hook and then just cock block you right before you hook a  survivor?  Even then, as killer you're faster than a survivor.  
---
Either way it doesn't really add up to me Lololol
---
I'm not, I've always known Edgar had this personality.
---
Your comment fucking sucksü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This made me straighten my posture
---
ayyy you almost got a perfect.  
---
And who cares that they brought sabo stuff?  Sabotage isn't even a viable strategy outside of a 4 stack SWF.
---
yeah that and most of the time i feel bad for killer cause i dont play enough survivor to rank up so i get baby killers so im like here you go buddy as baby dwight escapes
---
I hope this will make Oni better, because right now he feels really bad
---
Um..you forgot to change Nea.
---
Then you hook one of them and Blood Warden Activates!

---
He even got the ass sticking out run down.
---
I mean... under that logic NOED and everything else everyone complains about is fair game because you also purchase them in the blood web. Theres no other way to get those items so its not really a good comparison. 
---
If you use a key and someone escapes, boom, game over. Either everyone goes out the hatch or you close it and the game jumps to EGC. It straight up ends the game. Where as if you mori someone (assuming you arent using an ebony and murdering everyone left, right, and center) then the game still goes on for the four other people. The key is the worse of the two imo if you are so inclined to compare them.
---
As a killer/survivor player I respect the 0k more than the 1k, if the survivors play good and manage to get their friend out good on them, I‚Äôm never not going to give a person no chance to escape. By leaving the hook I‚Äôm giving them the chance to escape but also allowing myself to maybe snowball and roll up more pressure.
---
1 habit i need to break crouch dancing cause in minecraft it was a friendly sign in dbd that shits toxic
---
LIES
---
Jesus christ look at those BP..!
---
I'd like to see this for the survivors as well, I know for a fact Ash is fuckin *tall*
---
Not from a Jedi.
---
That wasn‚Äôt intentional, im just dummy thicc
---
Imo it's perfectly justified. What else are you gonna do but camp? Patrol the finished gens? I'm gonna sit my ugly ass in front of this hook and attack anybody who dates try to take my 1 sacrifice from my grubby hands.
---
Spirit takes a bit to get used to, but after a while, it's like a slaughterhouse. Oni takes a bit more to get used to, especially after his recent nerf not even a week after his release, but he's pretty fun and usable.
---
Exactly! Wish BhVR would make it 30 seconds
---
Chill out
---
It was on auto haven, and they were sitting at hooks constantlyüòÇbut just stating that they tried and didn't succeed
---
‚ÄúFixed‚Äù bug LULW
---
The Bill was already hooked and might have been hooked before the Nancy was unhooked. Which would totally negate your solution in this situation, since DS is only available after being unhooked. 
---
If by infinite charges you mean, it'll function like it already does then that isn't a change. If you mean that a survivor should be able to DS a killer more than once then survivors would learn to unhook at the right time to keep DS up on people. If people can DS more than once, then they'd have more reason to chill at lockers and body block for other survivors preventing more hooks and making it harder for killer to remove DS. Not to mention it would promote more survivors to use the same characters and skins to further abuse being able to use DS an infinite number of times.
---
wow ALL perks? aside from Oni, who's almost there though, i also have every killer at P3 50, BUT only with tier III of the 4 perks i actually use. bbq, nurse vision, noed, and ruin. thats crazy that u got EVERY perk for all killers too?

I read that as gang banged and i think im traumatized now

were you deadass about to attack someone that was afk?

She a monster of monstrous proportions.  I'm actually disappointed the oni is as small as he is.  Should have been a hulking bastard.

Sure
---
But he brought a puppet instead of chainsaw and boomstick.
---
It's similar to what the Nurse changes did. It just made it harder for bad players to do good with her. A good Spirit will still 4k every game no issue
---
So it was the clap from your ass cheeks that alerted the killer.

Empathy. I know, I'm weird. I play really aggressively I guess. So naturally that kind of chase knowledge is huge for me.

blood. follow the blood.
---
It's really night and day. Windstorm on, wreck face. Windstorm off, get infinite looped.
---
The meme is even funnier with this comment.
---
Sabo hasn't been good since the like first year this game came out.  It sounds great on paper but you have to be on edge and have great communication to bust hooks before the killer reaches them.  
---
It's the same thing as a flashlight save but requires waaaaaay more effort.  
---
Back in the day hooks that were broken didn't respawn Lolololol
---
And then posts complaining about facing only spirits and nurses on red ranks
---
I was going to switch from spirit main to Oni main but ig I'll just stay being a spirit main apparently it's more fun to go against spirit
---
People complain about every killer being OP or garbage he 1st week. The only exceptions have been Ghostface who was utter dogshit when he first released on the PTB, and the Demogorgon who is perfectly balanced and actually received a buff to his shred after he came out.
---
And I main survivor. I‚Äôm a survivor main that spends most my time calling out asshole survivors for ruining the game.
---
It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that no one has the right to tell anyone else how to play the game.
---
And you keep talking about ‚Äúintentionally ruining the game‚Äù as if just the basic act of playing the game is ruining it for other people.
---
You make up these inane rules about how someone has to play and if they don‚Äôt follow it, suddenly they‚Äôre ruining the game.
---
Again, tunneling, camping, slugging, et al are not reportable. They are not bannable. They are not toxic. They are not ‚Äúruining the game.‚Äù
---
You talk about tabletop games. Do you tell your opponents not to buy property in Monopoly? Do you tell them not to turtle up in Australia in Risk? Do you tell them not to hoard resources in Catan?
---
Your opponent using a strategy to win is not toxic.
---
It‚Äôs as simple as that. It‚Äôs not bad manners. It‚Äôs not ruining the game...
---
It is the fucking game.
---
If it‚Äôs not against THE GAME‚ÄôS RULES, it‚Äôs fair fucking play.
---
So as long as BHVR doesn‚Äôt ban the actions, those actions are an included part of the game.
---
To try and tell another person that they shouldn‚Äôt utilize an included part of the game is absolutely insane. It‚Äôs so fucking entitled that you should change your name to Karen and ask to speak with BHVR‚Äôs manager.
---
And my first comments were neutral.
---
- No one gets to dictate how another person plays the game within the confines of the mechanics.
---
- Your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
Those include everyone. They‚Äôre neutral to both sides.
---
The fact that you think you can disagree with them and dictate how anyone should play shows just how fucking entitled you are.
---
Nothing more than an entitled crybaby. Fuck off hypocrite.
---
I just dont get it. They are in the game for a reason. Doesn't mean we want to be toxic, some of us want to have fun. There needs to be a BP penalty or a ban for X amount of minutes. So annoying, mori's arent as bad as flashlight, tea bagging, blendettes.
---
Me: Gets 32k with the double pip. 
---
Opponents: *sweating lookin for something to unbruise their ego* 
---
You hate to see it, tbh.
---
Depends on the context, crouch dancing while farming is pretty common. I think using one of the two emotes after pallet stunning or behind a vault is often a waste of time for the survivor and is a great way to get tunneled imo
---
Depends on which michael timeline we‚Äôre talking about. I think bill could Draw against regular human Myers. As for the unkillable death cult superpower myers bill‚Äôs fucked.

Though I wish people would heal me against Oni a bit sooner. :P
---
I get this all the damn time.
---
The same people who DC over Moris are the same people who flashlight click, teabag, and think keys are perfectly balanced.
---
Idk man, as comedic as Evil Dead is, Ash easily has one of the most tragic stories of all the survivors. It's pretty depressing lol
---
Yes, all perks on all the killers. I need a life lol
---
I got told to kill myself because of missing a few Skill Checks
---
Hag has scoliosis
---
I hate how mandatory windstorm is. Wraith is complete dogshit without it
---
Myers and oni are different playstyles.
---
I'd say I have more fun with the Spirit. She's also stronger than the Oni
---
Didn‚Äôt even notice lmao
---
I did the same. Have about 250 games played since last reset. I'll post some same ish stats later.
---
It's still better than the damn swamp and haddonfield.
---
Do you mean this killer that doesnt give you either map pressure or gameslowdown so you have to use the stealth to earn it with your brain on your own?
---
Ye, really "brainless killer". Thx for the compliment.
---
Warmest regards, Ghostie Main.
---
I never said it was good?  But on a map that's really long and only has a few hooks in a big area, it just unnecessarily prolongs the game when they sit there breaking them constantly
---
Love that bug. 
---
It‚Äôs great when you get it as survivor and can‚Äôt even see skill checks
---
Wait another year until you turn 18 and play all the violent video games you want?
---
Yeah. I guess
---
That was never my point.  Read the comment.  I was stating that at red ranks the killers tend to be smarter to not tunnel as often so I personally don't feel it to be a requirement up there for me.
---
But at lower ranks tunneling is consistent and to be flat out expected in a lot if games.  Decisive is required for that.
---
Mhm most definitely
---
It‚Äôs unfortunately not possible right now. The devs have discussed a possible change to that in the future but as of now crossplay isn‚Äôt possible.
---
Face book's legit

I hate this bug so much

There was bloody streamer's and survivor pudding :(

STBFL

PWYF

On doctor i can get a snowball, since shock therapy doesn‚Äôt consume pwyf tokens i can shock someone at a loop catch up easily smack them and if they drop the pallet destroy it quicker. If they mess up and run into a wall I can snowball with stbfl, its also easier to find the obsession with doctor so.

If they won't let you play R6S there is a 0% chance of them letting you play this which is way worse. I feel bad for you for having parents like that.
---
whoaaa is that a hag? haven't seen one of those for a very long time
---
Little disappointed NGL. tfuCry
---
I am relatively new too and experienced the same problems. All the toxicity motivated me to become a better killer. I suggest getting good with ghostface so you can T-bag them back.
---
I love that you called him Oni-chan
---
Make a blood sacrifice to the elder gods for new parents?
---
When i tried Nurse for the first time last night. i couldnt even get 1 guy on the hook without getting hit by 2 other flashlights. They were also all on the same gen at the same time and trying to bait me away from other areas hard. Have not encountered that yet and got it with my first try as nurse.
---
Thank you
---
It would be a difficult one. You could try alluding it to what happens to you in hell? Since these people are stuck in an endless and deadly game of cat and mouse and eternal punishment for the rest of their lives. The game by itself isn't super bloody per say apart from the Moris but even then it's still really violent with people getting slashed, stabbed, gutted, and hooked all over the place. If they're disapproving about Siege than I really don't think they'll like DBD. I would still give it a shot though the worst thing they can say is no.
---
As a legion main thx for the heads up haven‚Äôt seen this yet
---
Bingo bongo üëâüèºüëâüèº
---
Same like how constricting do you have to be to not allow games with blood? Literally I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be scarred for life or become a psychopath for playing a violent video game
---
Have someone else buy it for you?
---
So the survivors play badly? And the shouldn't be punished for that?
---
Everyone knows the way to counter a camper. If survivors chose not to counter the strategy, that's their choice.
---
I mean it's not like it's from a week ago or anything. It's from well over a year ago so if you haven't been in this sub that long, then theres no way you could've known that. Especially since the original post title has nothing to do with the picture, so searching to see if it had been posted before would've been damn near impossible.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs mostly about preference. I don‚Äôt support spirit but after the update I might buy her to try her out but I‚Äôm still doubtful that she‚Äôs not op anymore.
---
Sadly this game is about 10x worse than R6S when it comes to gore and blood. I mean you literally can play as a serial killer, and the new killer (Oni) pretty closely resembles a demon. It seems pretty tough man but I‚Äôd still at least try, you never know.
---
If they are super Christians that would make it worse because then their child is playing a game that involves HELL
---
It is not toxic to use a strategy to win the game or complete objectives at any time.
---
I love the oni too he has such great potential. They can keep the steering changes just give me back that flick so I can stop these infinite loops with him. Rn his power is almost useless if not on a straightaway. I won‚Äôt hold my breath waiting tho
---
I would say Spirit. Her mindgames are ridiculously easy to pull off as all you'll have to do is stand still and people will fall for them. That, and as long as you have a decent pair of headphones finding injured survivors while phasing is a cakewalk. Oni isn't hard to learn either but he can be mechanically demanding since even after the flick nerf you still need to aim really well.
---
Correct
---
do a width chart next
---
Looks like he was working on the generator, that's why it goes for the grab instead of slashing before the DC.
---
No but like actually For a guy I should not be this thicc
---
The pics a lil blurry but I get the point nice caption those others dudes are trippin it‚Äôs not that deep
---
I do have an idea though, back when I lived with my mom she was really protective when it came to video games. I tricked her into getting me what was at the time the new COD by showing her gameplay of Overwatch. I have no idea how it worked but it did lmao, it‚Äôs worth a shot
---
‚ÄúNo just leave!!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you stupid bit- Oh okayyy‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck yea Nancy!‚Äù
---
Give evidence that violent video games have little to no correlation to physical violence? If you've seen any even slightly violent movies with your parents, remind them of that and that it hasn't affected you?
---
I hate that bug, but if you ever get it again as Legion, there's an audio cue to tell when exactly your power has come out of cooldown. Just a heads up
---
This could be a million different things so you'll have to go a little more in depth than just an error prompt.
---
Well a token for a perk is the number next to the perk and to get tokens you need to do something like with huntress lullaby each time you hook someone you get a token and each token decreases the ding to the skill check time smaller but with five tokens their is no sound
---
That's not the point of these comments at all. It's clear Trapper isn't getting a 4k here, but DS removed any possible sort of play he could make. Slug and she crawls out of the open exit gate, grab and the video happens, tunnel Bill and there's his DS or BT from Nancy (if she had it). It's just a 60 second "do whatever stupid shit you want and not get punished" force field.
---
And only one can be America‚Äôs next top model.
---
He's not actually disabled it's just somebody making a poor taste joke about disabled people
---
I agree. Survivors should have some fear of the killer. I should t be going after someone and have a survivor that was just hooked body blocking because they know they have DS or work on a gen when I‚Äôm standing right there because they‚Äôre not worried about getting hooked.
---
If they did add a mode with multiple killers, whats stopping two of them from ganging up and insta downing a survivor by swinging at the same time? Or just have everyone sit and camp on a separate generator to hold the game hostage? Even worse, what happens with totems and hex perks? Any survivor you see you could just pincer into a corner by having their paths cut off.

As for the switch between idea, it just seems like it wouldn't be good. It sounds entertaining and like it'd be fun but he'd still be a terrible killer since each version of him only has one perk on an already weak killer and if you want to use any of the other things you brought in you'd have to switch which is a real waste of time in a game where it's you against the clock.
---
If you read through the perk description it does tell you how to build the tokens, it can be a little hard to see, hex perks usually have a lot of writing,  every hex perk has a different way to build stacks
---
I sure hope so.
---
Freddy confirmed for manlet. 
---
Can't believe anyone is taller than Mikey. Impressive.
---
I mean it could tier 3 and she'd have another 20 seconds. Using tier 1 in balance discussion doesn't really serve a point.
---
&gt; The Bill was already hooked and might have been hooked before the Nancy  was unhooked. Which would totally negate your solution in this  situation, since DS is only available after being unhooked. 
---
That's actually true but it's already the way it is anyway plus it is much more situational that 2 people at the same time are being hooked. Much more at least than someone just rescued abusing their DS because they know they are virtually immortal with it. 
---
The idea I had does not solve everything (neither did I claim it would), you could also still slug people for a minute so that's not gone either. But simply hooking someone else is a better option than waiting around a slugged survivor for 60 seconds, there would actually be something the killer could do to deactivated someone else's DS which in essence would reduce tunneling further (rather than "slug tunneling" at least).
---
&gt; If people can DS more than once, then they'd have more reason to chill  at lockers and body block for other survivors preventing more hooks and  making it harder for killer to remove DS. 
---
The same way DS works now, so this is not actually a negative side of my idea. You would also not get DS'd more as a killer than you were prior to this, less actually, unless you are a filthy tunneler. Then yes, you will get DS'd a lot more (which is what would be intended with this, punish tunnelers REALLY hard so the behavior stops entirely). People chilling at lockers with their DS would be no more frequent than it is now (for tunnelers). 
---
&gt; body block for other survivors preventing more hooks and making it harder for killer to remove DS 
---
Which would be a new incentive for survivors to actually help each other out. There is virtually no body blocking in the current meta, which renders a lot of anti body blocking perks useless (that were introduced when body blocking was actually quite common). Body blocking essentially died with MoM (my speculation only).
---
&gt; Not to mention it would promote more survivors to use the same  characters and skins to further abuse being able to use DS an infinite  number of times. 
---
I can't see how this would be furthered by multiple DS. Of course it is confusing, but then people would also have to use the same name, as you can easily tell by their name and injured status etc. And even if they had the same name, they have different spots in the list on the killer's HUD. So killers could play around SWF all using the same skin and name (not to mention according to the dev's data, full squad SWF teams are less than 4% of all games, they mentioned this in one of their streams some time ago, possibly a year or smth).
---
It would tell you if you were banned. Why don't you submit a ticket to BHVR? That's what I do when I'm having issues. They usually answer pretty quick!
---
[I've already done one!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5mhcv/yui_and_oni_portraits/)
---
Either Ghostface or Freddy. A Nightmare On Elm Street is definitely my favorite movie, with Scream coming in at a close second. I love Ghostface‚Äôs backstory/lore as well. Plus both of them are currently pretty strong when it comes to actual gameplay
---
I feel like this only happens on Feng.
---
my internet is working, ive logged off then on again of steam, didnt work
---
Can't even count the amount of times I have tried and died trying to flash a killer, felt kinda good for a bit till he disconnected seconds later.
---
Fuck that‚Äôs terrifying!
---
The best portrait pack available... maybe.
---
Just wanna tell u at one point you will run enduring and some other perks. After like 20 games you get soooo sick of pallets so the build I reccomend is enduring, sloppy butcher discordance and bamboozle cuz some survivors try to disrespect your fatigue after canceling frenzy and vaulting the window back
---
lol, tru!
---
Havent people been banned for that I'm just not taking risks
---
As an Ace main, I approve of this
---
Bruh I gotta piss some times, and I would rather do it before the match.
---
How is borrowed time, decisive strike or unbreakable  a crutch perk?
---
i was really sad when i heard oni got nerfed.. as a survivor main who played against him many times, i thought he was really fun to play against! his chase music is cool too :D
---
A lot
---
The looping really helped, and I know the basics. Just that when I am injured and scared of myers i to into the locker. And there is blood.In front of the locker.
---
But yeah thanks for the tips
---
2500 hours logged in on steam. That is heavily inflated, however. Sometimes I forget to quit out when I leave and around a year ago queue times were so bad I would alt-tab out while waiting.
---
I think that is fine. However; a lot of people are saying that the flick is noticeably weaker and they only use mouse to do it. Scottjund recently made a video on it too. That seems to be the issue.
---
Strongest survivor perk in the game. A true get out of jail free card. Even if she had just gotten downed instead of yanked, she could have potentially crawled to the escape in the seconds she had left and Trapper couldn't pick her up without risking it. DS is game-warping.
---
I don't know that I'd say it's too strong. But it's definitely stronger than all the other survivor perks.
---
idk if you‚Äôve seen any scary movies, but if you have, you might be able to compare them and show how the game is less violent than the movies.
---
you obviously havent tasted the sandwiches I make
---
It‚Äôs not Danny‚Äôs mask, it‚Äôs Billy Loomis‚Äô mask
---
removed for name shaming edit names out
---
So cooking is art too huh?
---
Idk about Bt or unbrrakable but decisive does give you a second chance which can help you escape.
---
What do you consider toxic
---
Leave this for me :)
---
Mori's do, keys do not.
---
If we consider the game to be "over" once all gens are powered (most people do), then a team of 4 alive survivors literally needs to complete the trial to use a key.
---
A team of 3 needs to do 4 gens, or 80% of the trial to use a key. 
---
A team of 2 needs to do 3 gens, or 60% of the trial to use a key. 
---
In the event there's a lone survivor, the hatch is open automatically and there's no use for the key unless the hatch is closed. In this case, the killer got a 3k and didn't get the round cut short because the game is over anyways regardless of what the last survivor does (key, hatch, gate, death, etc.)
---
he m√∂nch
---
Which one do you like? I still got 1500 to spend but no clue lol
---
Not all killers are as viable as surviver though, yeah you *can* win with all killers but the chances are you will gen rushed the complete fuck out of and you'll be more stressed out than actually having fun.
---
Come on dbd, add alien pls
---
I believe i bought it and 1/2 months later it became free lol
---
Nancy was already wounded and halfway through her DS timer. If the killer hadn't gotten greedy and just downed her and waited out the rest of the timer, instead of going for the grab, he would have had 2 kills instead of 0
---
# YOU PICKED THE WRONG ESTATE, FOOL!
---
Yesss. I love paulie.

I often am on the fence with fanmade skins for games, but BHVR would be an idiot to pass this up. Toss some blood splatters and grime on this and good to go. Great job!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e9seyb/infinite_sprint_burst_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
They all let you play poorly and get second chances, Unbreakable lets you pick yourself if you get downed, BT lets you get away with unsafe unhooks.
---
Kinda same lol, one of my happiest moments in post chat was realizing one of the survivors told me good game in Russian lmao.
---
imagine posting a video from pre-nerf as evidence that the nerf didn‚Äôt ruin him
---
Destroying pallets should have no effect on emblem score.

Details on what it takes to earn points for each category can be found here:

---
It only activates if you get tunneled though, so it's not really a crutch.  The killer can just choose to not tunnel.  (unless the exit gates are open and you just got unhooked)
---
Thatll be twice as good as my stats since I only a hundred something games üëç
---
Ok but I don‚Äôt believe unbreakable is a crutch it just counters slugging
---
Yeah it's wicked fun laying on the ground or running around trying to find someone to end a game you lost instead of being able to play your next game.
---
Nah because debates are just, more or less, official arguments.
---
When you don't read the post
---
BT is tied to the survivor using it, not the survivor on the hook.
---
Good teams in red ranks will usually pop the gen in front of you when they know you have it
---
If you're that bad that you're going to go down again that quickly and after all that other stuff happening within a minute, it's not really a crutch is it?  Do you think those 5 seconds are going to save that person?  
---
You can't have a hypothetical situation where the killer is so powerful/skilled to keep momentum like that and then say that a 5 second window for our hypothetical d strike user would make any difference if they are that bad.
---
Yeah but an actual argument is a person being a prick and trying to defend their claim with no actual ground
---
I‚Äôm tryin to figure out how Self Care is a crutch though, it‚Äôs like the strongest killer perk in the game
---
A fucking Speedo
---
Lucky Break is pretty bad by itself mostly for the fact that in most games you can easily go 3 minutes without heals. It also doesn't help that the timer doesn't pause and the biggest elephant in the room being that rarely do you track people with their blood. 
---
Breakout is an overly altruistic survivors wet dream. Move faster while you tempt hits and your friend wiggles out faster. For a solo survivor however, I see literally zero use.
---
Any Means Necessary which is her best perk based off the general community consensus is also pretty lackluster. At least in my own personal experiences killers always end up breaking the pallet so I never even get a chance to use it. I can see it being useful on a map like Hawkins where a pallet might as well be useless if it's already been dropped, or on Shelter Woods where a lack of pallets is a big concern.
---
Right so in that case if you‚Äôre oblivious then you‚Äôll never get BT. So unless you yourself can hear the TR nothing will trigger, even if the TR still exists. Good to know.
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm on PS4 üòî

not sure why anyone thought billy v2 doing uturns was legit fair, interactive or intended lmao

That would take care of the ping issue, but there are also instances where Dead Hard just would not be usable while running and injured.

Curtain Call‚Äôs been used
---
i love any cosmetic steve has lol... as for other stuff i love the classic ghostface costume, wolf in sheeps clothing laurie, escaped patient michael, wild card yui, winter kate and her biker outfit,harajuku nea also cowboy jake  to name a few!!plus any feng cosmetic is super good too (though most of them can be bought with shards but it takes too long to grind for a full outfit) 
---
if you were gonna buy a character with ur auric cells id def recommend nancy for fixated and inner strength, steve has ok perks but hes steve so you have to get him ü§£  hope that helps!!
---
Fucking wack. Can‚Äôt see this game surviving for more than 2 more years
---
*Add Ethan as a survivor*
---
Huntress did not even exist when we had to deal with 3 o'clock skill checks.
---
I was playing against a face camping wraith and ended up getting the 4% and ran him around again for like 2 minutes while my teammate sat on hatch. I got a message from the first person who got camped and they were so excited for me
---
The ace with that face looks kinda weird.
---
Thank you, you too üòä
---
What was the relevancy of mr blue sky? üòÇ
---
DELETE
---
They plan on keeping it going for at least 5 more years
---
These are the posts I come here for
---
Well, there are just a lot of facecampers, tunnelers and so on. Also some of the game's mechanics are broken, such as hitboxes. But I think after about 80 in game hours, you will get good, have the most useful perks unlocked, and the game will be a lot more fun to play than it probably will in the beginning.
---
Yeah camping and tunnelling is a sign of a bad player. As I move up the ranks it happens less and less but today is just a bad day for me!
---
Nobody expects a Jeff in the first place
---
Where did you get that number lmao.. they‚Äôve said they plan to keep the game running as long as they have people who will play it
---
Yes and if you're lucky it will happen so many more times &lt;3 Enjoy!
---
I get that im the same way but at some point they cant treat him like hes 5
---
I recognized that quote.
---
The only thing I don't like is how he can trail on and on and on about a topic for so long. For example, he somehow stretched a video about the Christmas sweaters releasing into 16 min. Other than that he's pretty cool and he's one of the most up to date sources on DBD news besides maybe LeaksByDaylight.
---
Deceit is pretty good,  it it‚Äôs got little in common with dbd other than there‚Äôs one killer and a few other survivors
---
Hi
---
Last Laugh - Once the EGC starts you can activate this ability at any time. Activating this ability disables the killer for the remainder of the trial and starts a 15 seconds long globally announced countdown in form of respective killer laugh gradually increasing in volume and intensity. When the countdown reaches zero killer explodes and:
---
-every hooked and dying survivor are instantly sacrificed to the entity
---
-every injured survivor is put to dying state
---
-every healthy survivor is put to injured state
---
-EGC timer instantly progress 30/45/60 seconds
---
"What the hell are you? Hue hue hue" - Hish-Qu-Ten
---
Numbers on this perk are subject to balancing changes and will be gradually nerfed until the release of the next chapter.
---
This is neither farming nor reportable, and farming is not reportable. False reporting is probably not reportable either. But they probably didn't even report you.
---
If you want to play with your food a little, as long as you're not holding the game hostage - i.e. preventing them from leaving without quitting - then you're fine.
---
That could be really cool!
---
say that the survivors are christians trying to rid the world of demons and the killers are demons trying to stop you
---
Yahhhh. That's hot. That's hot.
---
r/raimimemes
---
All seeing and coxcombed clapper make a decent stealth build or running spirit all seeing with pop can annoy survivors
---
My least favourite killer to go against just because I feel physically sick when see that
---
Farming isn't a reportable offense anyway, but working with the killer is reportable, that is, to say if the 3 of you were working together to grief/farm other survivors, which can happen in a farming game when one of the survivors isn't interested in farming so the other survivors and killers go out there way to ruin your game.
---
Basically, don't worry about it, kinda just sounds like a salty survivor.
---
I love how Ghostface is just stalking away
---
Yea my friend jumped ship a few days ago and im about to follow suite. The problem with catering to these green rank survivor mains is that once you get somewhat decent at the game you just hit a brick wall. They just dont want you to have the tools to deal with high level survivors consistently. Maybe the game is balanced at mid level but once you get to rank 1 its just like 95/5 in survivors favor. I shifted to playing survivor because i would actually feel like i can win of my own merit and not just because the team i go against is trash, but the queue times are so long since all the killers are leaving. Idk whats in store for the future of this game but it seems they are prioritizing quelling short term complaints and not focusing on the long term.
---
It's a game, yo &lt;3 I recommend taking a step back and refocusing. Remember to enjoy the time you spend playing games, whether or not you "succeed". 
---
It looks like these two were having a good old fashioned lighthearted fun time - I know I have plenty of these situations happen in my games! Sometimes it can be fun to just goof around. Not always, but it's totally possible.
---
In any case, I hope you have a good day :)
---
A game called Last Year just released a few days ago on Steam. Apparently it released about a year ago as a Discord exclusive and didn't do too well so they re-worked a bunch of stuff and just re-released it. I've been keeping an eye on the Discord channel and it sounds like it's doing decent so far with some hiccups that the developers are still working through. Personally I'm going to give it a few more weeks before deciding if I want to try it or not. It is an asymmetrical game but looks like it has gameplay with some Left 4 Dead type of concepts in it. Check it out though, it definitely looks fun.
---
People who D/C before their first hook are the weakest race
---
Ok thanks
---
Yeah if a SWF can body block for like 2 hits then it should be a free escape most the time unless they have that legion perk that pauses the wiggle timer when you hit someone
---
lucky break can go good with quick and quiet, once you get hit and dont leave any blood marks you can jump in a locker without leaving blood in front of the locker, that is the only use ive gotten out of it anyway.
---
Tf kinda drugs squidward be doin' in his spare time?
---
get a legion 4k to unlock
---
No, farming is not a reportable offense. Neither is the plethora of other things people say are reportable like camping, tunneling, looping, and slugging. You'll be hard pressed to find yourself banned for anything besides cheating, bigotry in the game chat, or holding the game hostage in a way where the other side is literally unable to play (like trapping them in a corner and not moving)
---
I'm a survivor main and think that was silly to report. I would've been mad if you slugged and finished the game in two minutes. But even that I wouldn't report. ü§∑ Sorry, dude. That really is annoying.
---
Yes, this one situation could have gone better. That doesn't mean DS can't be abused.
---
Killers are kind of pathetic but it is still a good game.
---
Its also currently useful for Oni because everybody runs Infectious Fright on him rn.
---
Wooow
---
I feel like that could have been amazing. Biiiig guy, but easier to spot as a result, no real hiding
---
I can't find even one example of someone getting banned on this game. That said, what is the concern of being reported?
---
You mean like you and only you?  
---
Is this what they call "projection"?
---
I agree! Of course, I never said anyone should "need to rely on luck" as that's not what I meant. Luck is an inherent part of this game, so I think it's good to keep that in mind when considering issues like this. Luck plays a part on DBD, for better or worse, as a part of the design of the game :)
---
It's especially strong against bad killers, i.e the tunneling, camping kind. But that's exactly why it's so good and healthy for the game
---
This is Amazing I hope this is a future cosmetic for Docter for Christmas cause its beautiful but I dont play Doc but looks badass
---
Laurace and Face are giving me nightmares.

Luckily I was saving shards and didn‚Äôt instantly buy this nerfed garbage.
---
The killer bias is strong with this one.
---
Legion was *literally* killing the game. People were leaving in droves because Legion removed skill from the game.
---
People only wanted omegablink and extra blink add-ons removed. Noone asked for a base kit nerf.
---
People didn't suddenly start complaining about Spirit after the nurse nerfs. It's actually hilarious how you are pulling shit out of your ass. Anyone with a brain said she needed more counterplay with possibly a buff to compensate months before the nurse changes even hit ptr.
---
Everyone was divided on Oni's powerlevel except for one thing: flicking on PC removed counterplay from survivors. You can't juke someone who has a massive lunge and can 180 quickly. When a killer's best counterplay is running into a locker to force him to end his power, there's a problem. Hiding during his power is not counterplay, because hiding means you aren't doing anything.
---
Almost noone is asking for Billy nerfs. "Many" is quite the exageration.
---
Literally WHO is complaining about that? Do you have a link to a single post or comment where someone is complaining and they not getting downvoted?
---
amazing idea
---
That's what happens when you go afk.

You forgot to add worship Otzdarva to this so this sub is gonna crucify you

before playing dead by daylight i played alot of "depth" 2 sharks vs 4 divers and it is a really fun game that is still being supported with free new content all the time.
---
I appreciate you took the time to give me some much needed info I‚Äôm new to the forum but everyone here seems pretty nice for the most part. Any tips for when there‚Äôs one gen left and there all pretty far apart? Frenzy doesn‚Äôt really last that long and I hate letting them know where I‚Äôm at because I keep stunning myself going place to place looking for them. Anyways, thx a bunch!
---
My main problem is this feels like a win more power. It does nothing until you hook someone, and then all it does is upgrade your stats a bit. If you get all 10 pools, you‚Äôre probably already doing pretty good, and then there‚Äôs very little the survivors can do to stop you. If you are doing poorly, you have next to nothing to actually help you come back. Plus, the restrictions on marking the survivor is not great. You have to wait 30 seconds after hitting them in order to get value for your power, that‚Äôs 30 seconds of pressure you‚Äôre losing out on unless you slug. I think his kit needs more than just stat increases for playing the game, give him something that‚Äôs unique and encourages different play than M1, hook, repeat
---
If I had a nickel playing against a Wraith with coxcombed clapper omg...
---
played alot of friday the 13th the game aswell but wouldnt recommend it. lots of bugs and is not really supported anymore :/ but depth is still fun as hell
---
I know. &lt;/3 
---
Like nurse used to be every other game but now she's rare.. sad times
---
Thank you all for the quick response :D

I miss the times f13th was fun :/. so many good memories from the release

&gt; When jumping out of a high location, your recovery speed is decreased by 25/35/50%

Do you mean your stagger is decreased? Killers don't get a stagger when they fall to my knowledge.

Thank you dab yodel

DS isnt just a tunneling perk. its an anti momentum perk aswell :/

Well.... depending on map, yes. And if the trapper isn‚Äôt really committed to basement dwelling and isn‚Äôt using iron grasp/agitation/mad grit. A basement trapper who is on a smaller map or one with a central basement will probably still be able to get you in his basement, wiggling or not.

Thanks for showing me this. 23 seconds is a long time though. It's understandable for console players as the terrible FPS makes it pretty impossible to hit greats or people who for some reason are just unable to hit greats at all. I still think people should focus on getting better at hitting greats rather than doing gens at 3/4 speed.
---
Can you get it on ps4?
---
Ice cold just leaving them on the ground like that lol.
---
Wow Pop Goes!
---
...Other perks too, but wow Pop Goes!
---
Ignore that the gens don't get done and just count the seconds to see if they could have been done. I think you would be surprised at the frequency; it might even be the majority of games. You also might be surprised at the circumstances in which games were still rushable for survivors that follow the solution.
---
If you knew exactly what I was talking about you wouldn't try to argue with me. Especially not by saying "but usually the gens don't get done".
---
https://www.twitch.tv/deathgardengame &lt;- Link to the farewell stream (they‚Äôre doing Behind The Scenes things pretty neat)
---
https://store.steampowered.com/app/555440/Deathgarden_BLOODHARVEST/ &lt;- Steam link, people have mentioned you only have to add the game to the library it also comes with a free and pretty big digital lore/art book, all the cosmetics in the game except terminator are very cheap with in-game currency if you want to check it out.
---
Yet you take down every post that‚Äôs barely even been on the subreddit.
---
I love the down rank in the final scene. It completes the story quite nicely.
---
why‚Äôre they saying goodbye to it?
---
Oh yea, you're fine.  Nothing reportable about general shenanigans and tomfoolery. 
---
Keep in mind, it's super hard to get banned in this game. The only way I'm aware of that gets dealt with quickly is blatant cheating/hacking. 
---
In a realistic scenario, you would need to show habitual griefing behavior over a sustained period of time before anything happened. So keep snooting away as the Pig and let the salt roll off your back.
---
Anyone can get kills if you slug and 1 hook. Those stats are garbage
---
Sorry, Deathgarden isn‚Äôt on PS4 or any consoles so the masks aren‚Äôt either :(
---
Breakout can be utilized with MoM to build stacks and potentially deny hooks.
---
i had to look up the locket to figure out what it was. OP probably thinks every survivor perk is a crutch.

Huntress gets amazing skins so reliably but it sucks that I can‚Äôt play her for shit cuz aiming her on console sucks

Me as killer realizing that people die when they are killed.

I know it's not horror but the Wii U game Nintendo Land has several asymetrical games in it and they're pretty fun. Only local though.

Between Mad Grit, Breakout, Flip Flop, Agitation, Unbreakable, Iron Grasp, Tenacity, and Mettle of Man. There's like an entire meta around just slugging and carrying now and it's hilarious.

Man, I‚Äôm still trying to get used to her on Xbox after coming from PC, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm relearning her all over again.

Yup it's happened to me too. I ended up getting antsy and hitting them and they escaped. What's the game plan as a killer? Wait as long as possible till they believe you've afked?

Well the old one he‚Äôs talking about for the David jacket was even more so that way because you got coins for doing the event gens which is how you got the cosmetics

I‚Äôve got enough but the problem is I‚Äôm saving for Yui ;-;
---
Legion was specifically designed not to be good, even the devs said so during his release. He only needed the chase exploit fixed, nothing else. instead fo just the Chase exploit, BHVR nerfed a whole bunch of other crap no one had even complained about.
---
As for leaving the game, survivor queue are 10 time worse than killer times right now because the ratio of survivors to killers is too high. And this gets worse at high ranks because the game is survivor sided once the basic mechanics are learned. This also results in killers being far more likely to go against much higher ranking survivors most of the time,  making the game even more biased against them and creating a cyclical effect.
---
&gt; People only wanted omegablink and extra blink add-ons removed. Noone asked for a base kit nerf.

blatantly false.

they did. i watched it. nefore nurse, the only complaints I saw about Spirit were that she's one of the only 3 killers Survivors face at high ranks. Which is an indictment of how bad the others are, not her being too good.
---
I'm on console, where there is no flick. 3/4 of the platforms are neglected by the devs, and it makes things more difficult for killers than survivors on those platforms. Nurse and Huntress in particular, but all killers due to framerate, which does not burden survivors as much as killers.
---
Being able to force Oni to lose his power by getting in a locker isnt exactly fair counterplay, especially since nearly a third of looping in this game centers around the shack and its 2-6 lockers. 
---
I don't record every post I read on here, so no, I dont have a list of people calling for Billy nerfs. we do all see the people demanding Freddy and Billy nerfs though.
---
This skin and the new Oni skin coming out on the 25th? Normally I‚Äôm not all about buying skins in games but the design team have been knocking it out of the park recently, especially for killers.
---
Dbd gone wild will replace that sandwich soon
---
Fighting the good fight PS4. Salute
---
So if a killer is getting 3 kills a game how does that make the killer unplayable and not viable? Seems like if ‚Äúanyone can get kills‚Äù then my statement about all killers being viable depending on how you play them is true.
---
It seems you are the one misunderstanding here.
---
You have three trials and the results are independent of eachother. The chance of escaping if you tried all three trials would be 1-(1-0.04)\^3 which is about 12%.
---
That I get, but survivors want you to toy with them and let them go even when they are miles ahead of you.
---
Who's crying over rainbow maps? Explain please?
---
I had the same thing happen to me! I thought it would look so cool on biker kate
---
Tag as spoiler, some might not've finished yet.

Every fucking game, pallet drop - commence tbag initiative. Against myers. Fucking really?

Someone using logic and reason against a group of entitled hypocrites?

DOWNVOTE HIMMMMM

Love this icon! The download link isn't working anymore, any chance of a new one?
---
Yes I do. He ~~is~~ was really fun with that flick. Surely it had to be fixed, but not that severe. They could also give him some buffs in return, but they also killed his red addon, without even addressing the crest, which was horrible since PTB.

I am a level 50 legion w a build that I think is ok but he just plays so inconsistently I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me or him. I‚Äôm gonna load up a match w some bad add ons and see if I can make anything good happen. So you‚Äôre pretty much saying 3-gen strat or you‚Äôre fucked on legion? I‚Äôm ok w that I got all the killers but is that what you take from him? If so that‚Äôs kinda sad for legion, cause I do agree to an extent but I don‚Äôt feel like you should always have to resort to one strategy as a killer cause that gets boring for the killer and survivors honestly. Games starting thx again I played a game w my main (wraith) and I feel pretty confident so wish me luck!
---
The battle pass is disgusting its the same model from skins in the store already. Just recycling cosmetics. Make the cosmetics unique and cool in the battle pass not same old bull shit
---
Yeah its a killer called the Nurse /s
---
Jesus, that sounds way too powerful.
---
*laughs in Franklin's*
---
I absolutely adore people who make art with chocolate. It's so mesmerizing.
---
this wouldn't even get used because all survs are just gonna hunt it down at the beginning of the game lmfao also no perk is THIS intricate
---
The same thing is happening to me. It is frustrating.
---
or we could just keep it as it is
---
BHVR: *Has perks that remove your bleeding.*
---
Also BHVR: It doesn't counter the Killer based on having you bleed lol
---
Yep you‚Äôre the greatest legion of all time and everyone else just doesn‚Äôt know how to play him
---
Yup, ~11.5% chance of escaping or so in 3 attempts.  ~ 22% w slippery meat
---
Its weid hearing Blue sky without the original voices, but great song choice!
---
They decided to give everyone all of the exclusive con cosmetics for free. There were some exceptions like Dev exclusive outfits and all of the Legacy outfits. The main 2 reasons they listed was 
---
1. The cosmetics could only be redeemed through Steam codes meaning Xbox, PS4, Switch, &amp; Mobile are all SOL
---
2. People would sell the cosmetics online for exorbitant amounts of money online. Often times they were just scams.
---
Unsurprisingly, not everyone agrees with the choice. Some people spent real money on codes for the cosmetics and feel slighted now the everyone is now getting them for free. While others feel that it's a sign of dedication and that it shows that you've been there since day one. Me personally, I don't care. I got a bunch of free stuff and I'm not about to complain about it.
---
oooof I just realized you're that guy from the other thread that thinks borrowed, D strike and unbreakable are crutches.  
---
Is borrowed toxic because it counters your camping?  Is D strike a crutch because you can't stop tunneling?
---
Ruin is fine. Totems just need a rework. Your idea is tedious and annoying.
---
I think the issue is people can't agree on what "viable" means. It's kind of pointless to debate it until you and the other person are sure you even mean the same thing.
---
Some people define it as "n kills on average" some as "pips on average" others as "capable of beating top tier survivors".
---
I find it very hard to believe that 75% of survivors message you after a game.
---
Thank you. At least somebody maths.
---
Honestly, I would‚Äôve hooked them. Everyone knows you don‚Äôt hide in lockers, especially when you‚Äôre playing against a huntress.
---
Definitely worth continuing, I‚Äôd love to see everyone else
---
As killer main, I never really notice height when selecting except for Plague and Michael.
---
Oh so that's how they got them masks, oh well, was a quick download.
---
Just keep Ruin as is. It can be annoying to deal with but it's only temporary and it serves as great training for for hitting great skill checks
---
Thank god your name is on it. Now I know I am viewing quality OC.
---
He shit his pants
---
More like they're scared of skill-based characters. Removed the flick, removed the choice of slugging (even if it was a buff it was an intelligent choice since you had to choose between losing your power or not securing your kill), discourage chaining downs with Blood Fury and encourage you to immediately pick up the first person you down to pause your "Tier 3" and get more Blood Orbs when you hook the Survivor.
---
NPC: bUt ThAt WoUlD sPlIt Up ThE cOmMuNiTy
---
Yeah I don't think it was fair that you could turn more than 90 degrees after going straight for a long time.
---
ooo that would be perfect!
---
I don't think this clip is a very good example of your argument. She was very recently unhooked, as her level 1 DS with a 40 second timer still had a good chunk left on it. If the trapper was smart he would have just lunged to down her and waited for 20 seconds, easy 2k.

gotta buff that demogorgon count up

jesus fuck, hell no. 
---
thats not fair at all, like imagine doing a gen, then having it get locked off and have to go to a dif one just bc you are unlucky.
---
This is prob the worst suggestion for ruin i have ever seen.
---
Breakout is the only good one, change my mind daddio
---
Credit to u/beauviolette who originally made this for For Honor
---
What OP is saying isn‚Äôt wrong. Camping and Tunneling are valid strategies, and your opponent playing the game to win is not toxic or against the rules.
---
But, and big *but* here, OP is a hypocrite for bitching about survivors and how survivors play in other threads while trying to argue that killers get to play how they want.
---
Who knew asking someone to calm down is the same as being Trump.
---
Should I get Tenacity? I really like using it on Tapp but i don't really play him. And I don't know if it is even any good lol
---
I'm full of Love :) For Satan, and other things as well!! Satan don't have to be mean &lt;3

Will do this next time! I play at purple ranks so it'll be interesting

More like [this](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) tbh
---
&gt;He only needed the chase exploit fixed, nothing else.
---
If you think the only problem with Legion was his exploit, you weren't around for OG Legion. Even if Legion player played as intended, there was no skill in chases. He would just hit you with Feral until you go down while you run in a straight line away. Not *good*, just no counterplay.
---
Legion NEEDED to die (and this is coming from a person who mainly plays Legion when playing killer.)
---
&gt;As for leaving the game, survivor queue are 10 time worse than killer times right now because the ratio of survivors to killers is too high
---
Yeah. Because everyone came back when old Legion died. Is that hard to understand?
---
Toxic mechanic causes players to leave --&gt; Toxic Mechanic gets removed --&gt; Players come back

---
I really don't care. If you are saying we should balance all platforms with console in mind, you are wrong. Either the devs balance for PC, or they balance seperately. 
---
&gt;Being able to force Oni to lose his power by getting in a locker isnt exactly fair counterplay
---
Juking an Oni only for him to 180 and lunge from Narnia to hit you wasn't fair either. Everyone playing him could tell how unfair it was.
---
Cotton eyed joe

Yeha and in 30 seconds Nancy was already out mate, this guy played like this because he knew he had the decisive's advantage, don't talk like these kind of perks don't let you do stuff you shouldn't be doing

Don't you mean slippery meat?

Forgive my low graphics settings lol

Try to play bubba legion demo and pig against a good team lol

I bought it yesterday :)
---
I think its something about rising up against men? Not too sure
---
I bet your post got taken down for being a no effort shitpost.
---
Correct me if im wrong but isn't the base movement speed when cloaked like 125 or something really shit like that? and with the yellow its 135? 
---
I feel like the add ons should be reduced but the base is increased so we can have some actual variety in our add ons.
---
I have no words
---
You‚Äôre not asking him to calm down. You‚Äôre dismissing what he‚Äôs saying by insinuating he‚Äôs upset and angry.
---
Doesn‚Äôt take much to call out a gaslighter. You‚Äôve got nothing to talk about that‚Äôs related to the argument at hand, so you just try to brush it off as ‚Äúoh, calm down. You‚Äôre upset.‚Äù
---
Except that it wasn‚Äôt???
---
I think iri heads are the only completely outright overpowered addon left in the game (survivor or killer). It's good that they've been taking care of all of them to make the game more fun and fair, but why are Iri Heads still here? They've been around for like 2 and a half years now. Its ridiculous.
---
I don‚Äòt spend money on skins xD (except the pink hair of nea for 400 cells, with the other the cosmetics I bought with shards, it looks neat)
---
Maybe 90 was too much but the amount he can do now is pitiful
---
Not to mention it was taken down for it saying bug in the title and it says that on my post if you took two seconds to read rather than attempting to troll on random ppls posts because you‚Äôre bored with yourself lmao
---
you're telling me you didn't find the banana memes to be ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS...
---
^(/s)
---
I think it‚Äôs funny people don‚Äôt like him for having an opinion. Lol I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs changed much honestly, it‚Äôs just now he is on an unscripted podcast so you see more of him as he is and people are getting upset about it. XD to each their own. I still enjoy them. But he is allowed to have an opinion. Even if it‚Äôs a dumb one he doesn‚Äôt claim to be a genius, he regularly calls himself out for being an idiot. XD
---
You you can play a bass but you cant tune it
---
Happy to see you enjoying yourself man, see you in the fog
---
why stop there? why not just make it where missed skill checks immediately place all survivors into the dying state?
---
You're correct, that's why you have to at least run the purple or green windstorm. I think wraith should, at base have some variation of windstorm and adjust the add ons accordingly so that we can have variation with using add ons on wraith. I'm sick of being forced to use windstorm and swift hunt all the time.
---
I knew this joke was coming
---
I thought you knew exactly what I was talking about. Did you think that it was nothing gets done during the beginning of games?
---
I'm not a pseudo intellectual, and obviously nobody would try to sound like one or convince others they are one. What I think you're trying to say is that you think I *am* a pseudo intellectual.
---
Great work my dude hope you get some Good perks soon because oh boy do you need it if you go against a decent team
---
Hey look it me the guy on the hook.
---
This was very funny to see because i had no idea what was happening. From my perspective i saw myself on the hook however the camera didn't move to it, it stayed on the killer. The weapon on his back was flickering and i couldn't do anything. Glad to see that others have had the same issue, but quite bad that it has happened more than once (this is the only time that this has happened to me).
---
Can someone explain the context of the situation to me? Is this by any chance related to the tweet from OhTofu's girlfriend's tweet towards TrueTalent?
---
What would you suggest with him?
---
Good game considering I didn't expect much
---
You're welcome! ^^
---
Should make a Sheet what Perks Survivor use...
---
Most killers agree using ebonys sucks. The good ones at least
---
Ain‚Äôt no complaints
---
YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL! BONK BONK
---
I tried telling someone they maybe shouldn't do that. "I play Myers too, I know what I'm doing! I looped you for 5 gens." "I tombstoned your whole team." "All but me!"
---
I couldn't really argue with that.
---
Haunted ground=trap
---
You can only Kobe if the killer is right next to you, or a surv is about to save you. No Exceptions!!!

Not going to say any names, but one streamer tweeted about another saying they have disability. Other streamers liked and even reacted to the post with gifs laughing. I don‚Äôt understand why streamers attack so much :/

What if he yoinked le image and edited it
---
im in brown ranks every other game i see someone dc
---
Look, Doctor usually uses terror radius perks (Distressing), that means massive heart beat, massive heart beat means bigger radius of Coulrophobia being active.

Hag? Her radius is 24 M. Coulrophobia only works in terror radius, am i fucking missing something?
---
Uhh, gossip...me wantss
---
r/oinkers vs r/LegionFJSJ
---
Did I mention motorcycle gang?
---
The name of the game with Myers is breaking LOS. He‚Äôs weakest at the start of the match, and the goal of whoever has his agro is to keep him in tier 1 as long as possible. Make good use of LOS blockers and the rest of the team can easily finish the gens before he reaches Tier 3 while using either of the ultra rated, and especially if he‚Äôs using both
---
i agree on the premise, but it takes way too long to get a fucking lobby, i'll get matched with whoever at this point. whatever i can do to avoid sitting on my phone / browser all night while waiting for a goddamn lobby

I get fast lobbies but they're always unbalanced :(

---
Its useless  IMO most teams have a groupm of 3 or 2 groups of 2
---
I do recommend you watch it, but trust me, the show definitely isn't know for these types of jokes.
---
My definition of "crutch" is something that makes up for areas you are weak in. Like using stridor for hunting, urban evasion and iron will for hiding, premonition or spine chill for awareness, definitely windows of opportunity for map awareness. These perks have very small benefit once you get better at the game. (Except for spine chill and premonition, fully counter stealth killers, not as good vs most killers though)  with this definition, dead hard and ruin could be called crutches, because they make up for weak chases or gen protection. But really, they are just strong perks, because they actually get better at highest level of skill, although both can be somewhat countered by the other players skill. Can be used as crutches, but are mainly just general performance enhancers. A man with a weak or broken leg may need a crutch, while a healthy man would not, but either would benifit from physical enhancement, be it steriods or straight up making them a cyborg.
---
Pretty much.
---
this has been me for the past week lmao, ill have a fine game in rank 5 then i pip to 4, play a new game vs red ranks and it goes bad so quickly then im back to 5 againü§£
---
Omg, why did he go for that save like that?
---
I too enjoyed the game until i hit rank 6 with killer, now i dont even wanna play killer anymore due to being too bad to deal with red ranks
---
Nice. I got lucky with Corrupt Purge by getting two people a week ago. They were both at a pallet, one dropped the pallet and then I downed them both within a second of each other
---
Krabby patties
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I agree
---
Even better if someone taps it and you get another hook right away - might as well move to a new one at that point.
---
EdgarAlanBro ‚Äùapologises‚Äù for what he did and later continues to defend his actions, yikes
---
Funniest thing I have seen on this subreddit
---
What killer do you play?
---
Man, I really want to learn to play as Huntress just for costumes like that, but as I'm on console, I know it could be tricky.
---
I'll maybe put in the time just so I can wear that costume with pride
---
Is that your handwriting?
---
They really aren't
---
Ruin slows them,Iron Grasp lets me get em to the basement, BBQ lets me see their friends and NOED in case they start doing Gens while I camp the people in the basement. I havent had more than 1 escape in forever
---
Ok explanation time. *My* dummyface thought that the fellow up there said Claudette, and me putting together the fact that Claudette is pretty... *disliked* among the community (well, from what I‚Äôve seen anyway) and the fact that some people seem to have about an IQ of 3, I made the comment, and I paid the price for not reading it thoroughly
---
No. This was originally made by u/beauviolette
---
Not sure
---
i'm so jealous of that. it takes so long to get a fucking match i just end up getting tired and bored.
---
To be honest I would really like a "rematch" function when playing vs a full SWF team  and you're sitting there with your "oh let's all have a fun 2 hook max game today!" attitude and build.
---
Nothing is gained literally all xp and bloodpoints are lost in the process
---
You're making it sound a lot easier to achieve that amount if stalk using those addons.  Good survivors aware of their surroundings can make it like pulling teeth getting that stalk off.  It's constantly about breaking line of sight with that build.  I've played in plenty of groups that denied those addons from taking effect.  
---
Also in a pinch if he's on you in a chase with those addons just hop into a locker in front of him.  He has to hook you.
---
If that happens when the match was cancelled bc someone left while loading in, it‚Äôs just a visual bug &amp; you don‚Äôt really lose the pip. If you mean when the game‚Äôs already started then yeah, one person person dcing (either side üòë) ruins it for the other 4 :(
---
I will soon own the thiccccest killer in the game
---
It's not new, it's been happening as long as I've been playing (about a year) and it's getting worse and worse.
---
The worst sportsmanship I've seen in any online game is in this one.
---
Just tell them it's a hide and seek game.
---
:) Poor Oni got gunned down. One of the hardest nerfs a killer has gotten.
---
Yea, that would be great function too. I dont think its so hard for devs to make new game modes or these small functions
---
I don't mean three trials, I just mean three chances before the struggle phase. Thanks for teaching me nevertheless.
---
You get left inside the chest.
---
I disagree, it doesn't work as well, even at high ranks. Half of the survivor challenges require you to get all the gens done at least to do them, which is really hard to do in solo games these days. Some are incredibly easy because they don't require you to survive, but the ones that require you to get to endgame are a massive hassle. :(
---
I appreciate the encouragement though. :)
---
100% this. i've seen throughout my history of Dead by Daylight. both sides. through all ranks.
---
I'd rather wait longer for a good match than constantly get blinded, stunned, 360d and all the toxicity that goes along with it every game. As I'm writing this people are teabagging me because I've just given up on this match, these players are clearly too good for me to be against them and yet here I am essentially getting bullied because the system is broken.
---
Congrats my guy

Legion is like the best way to boost your rank and bp

Almost as if Oni having a con is a bad thing. Dude was too strong, how was it fair that I could turn a corn and this dude is running at mach speed does the same turn and eats my ass for dinner?

Well it was a bug that lasted 2 months. Should‚Äôve left it
---
You either gimme your stock or you get the glock
---
I don't hate it as much as I think I should...
---
I think it just depends at what time you get into red ranks. If you get to rank 1 early enough you don't have to deal with people deranking or people who play selfishly and "just play to have fun" but play enough to get to red. End of season around rank 4/5 is pretty terrible w/ people deranking or dcing.
---
I think they meant the killer had enough time to down and pick up the survivor before hatch ever opened up.
---
For all of its toxicity, things like this are part of why I still love this community.
---
The EAC will get you it can be disfunctional
---
Red ranks on PS4 are just NoED, spirit, mori, forever Freddy, spirit with mori, forever Freddy with mori, ‚Äîspirit kawii desu x Freddy love expedition!‚Äî Ghostface that teabags you and camps you bc you looped him once. 
---
Oh and if you somehow get past all that, then the killer will just dc before you can get out the exit gate and get your escape points :) 
---
Do yourselves a favor and intentionally stay at purple ranks lol trust me
---
Someone just posted 17 mins ago with a new set of codes in the comments if you still want them. Not sure if they're still available though
---
Uhhhh maybe say the entity is the devil and the game shows the negative impact that he can have on your life and you team up with friends to defeat him...........stupid reasonings require stupid reasoning to defeat
---
Nah mami make you look T H I C C
---
Not really, both are:
---
Killers who receive their power from survivors, in manners that survivors can mitigate (loops without decent LOS for Myers, healing or denying the hit against Oni).
---
Killers whose power is limited in duration.
---
Killers whose power improves their mobility and hitting distance to the point that short of a very safe loop, you're probably getting hit.
---
Killers whose power lets them catch back up after breaking a safe pallet, short of one or two of the worst building loops in the game.
---
Killers whose power is a one-hit-down.
---
You can immerse, immersing is literally the entire point of EW3, Plague Corrupt Purge, and Oni's Demon Strike, it's not new or novel, and people have been doing for year(s) and getting out successfully even when targeted by it.
---
Even going down once to it doesn't make it OP, because you have second chances through perks and hook stages.
---
Were you the guy who 4% on Yamaoka Estate just a few months ago when you posted this lol?
---
We can agree to disagree, I hope you have a good day, and I hope you can complete your challenges, hassle or not.
---
at least 400 sadly. I'm invested
---
I‚Äôd like to imagine that while everyone else in the fog super depressed and hopeless, Yui just shows up like ‚ÄúHell yeah guys! Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll run this villain around so you can stay safe whilst you do the gens! To freedom friends!‚Äù
---
Really cool, i have every killer perk, but i never plan on prestiging any of them. I think it's a waste of bloodpoints, and if i have actual cosmetics, I'm going to be using those, if i don't have cosmetics, it's a killer i don't play.
---

He 99d every hook and then ran around breaking them afterward, when I wasn't carrying a survivor, while I was patrolling generators.
---
I came over to check it out, found him at the generator afterward, and hit him.
---
He ran into the killer shack, how does that not make sense? Also your story doesn't make sense, if I was carrying someone, I wouldn't be faster than a survivor.

Fair point, I was thinking in terms of gen time takes 80 seconds so 80*(1+0.16+0.16) =105.6 as opposed to 80*(1+0.16)*(1+0.16)=107.65

The more positivity spread the less negativity there is about. I feel like more people are inclined to get less tilted if this happens but that‚Äôs just me

Remove the animation and you might have something.
---
What rank are you? If you are below 16 the queues are horrible, at 12+ you're gonna be looking at minutes if not seconds, at least on 9+.
---
thank you, got the two confused
---
i hear when he go ***huhhhh hahhhhh*** with his mouth
---
I've seen that exact argument brought up a million times in defense of NOED and moris.
---
However, I'd argue that NOED and moris both encourage toxic behavior and should be reworked.  And I know there are many people who agree.
---
NOED rewards you for playing badly, letting all the generators complete, but then rewarding you with sacrifices at the end game because most survivors will not go for a save if NOED is active.
---
MORI offerings also encourage tunneling off the hook.  The protections that are built into the game can be ignored.  Borrowed Time, who cares if you can hit them twice, they're out of the game. Decisive Strike, can't get Decisive Striked if you don't pick them up. 
---
You're setting up a false equivalence with mechanics that are absolutely unhealthy for overall game health to somehow argue the DS, which is healthy for game health is somehow unhealthy.

The reason is there less Red Rank Killers making the survivor's queue long enough it takes the first killer it can find close enough to their rank. The only way this is getting fixed is by either making killer's rank up as easy as survivors or the opposite, make ranking up as survivor as difficult as killer.
---
comin in here with that Minecraft head
---
"Trial" is the usual word used when referring to an individual "try" of chance. Since you can try to unhook yourself 3 times, you have 3 "trials". You technically only have one "chance" over those 3 "trials".  
---
Not trying to nitpick, just clarifying that I don't mean "trials" as anything different than what you are referring to -- the three rolls you get per first stage hook.
---
You only have 60 seconds and considering you‚Äôll want to be healing for some of that time depending on the killer I highly doubt you actually manage to get much done. Besides the perk is needed for the killers who do tunnel you off the hook and basement camp because trust me there‚Äôs a lot of them.
---
I‚Äôm confused.... and new xD
---
Literally my favorite thing to do in kill your friends. Infectious Fright, Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit. Down someone, pick them up, and just chase people while swinging wildly with mad grit lol
---
It should've been everyone is Ace except for ace
---
I'm half expecting that they may give more than just the masks to everyone as the last piece of one of their passion projects, maybe 2 other things like maybe Veteran pieces for Huntress and such. Can't just let such a creative IP be brought down as 2 simple masks.
---
The man could do a 90 degree after traveling to the other end of the map to catch a BBQ aura. I agree this nerf was harder than it needed to be, but for fuck sake, 90 degrees?
---
How is Jen a horrible person? Legit question, I have no idea why people are saying this. And what did Andre say?
---
I am rank 13-14 killer and I keep getting like this
---
5-6survivors and im lucky if i get 8
---
I simply cant catch them anymore and im also lucky if i get one kill 
---
All im getting is this toxic teabag and flashlights but man im not 5-6-7-8 yet for a reason xD 
---
And i dont even have the choice to leave if i see that they are not balanced for my rank.
---
What i think is that its alright if it gives me like this,if it cant completely find me a 13 survivors or whatever 
---
But this is not the case :D 
---
I press ready and in 10second im in a lobby
---
If i am a survivor then i get 6-7-8 killers xddddd 
---
I do think its unfair that the matchmaking will put players for the lowest 
---
How unfair is this for the less experienced players...
---
Me,my boyfriend,his sister and my nephew play together sometimes and they are less experienced,and overall play less,because of their time
---
And they keep dying because we are around 14-15 (my bf 12) and we get 5 killers. 
---
Overall its unbalanced like this because we arent talking about 6down or above thats even more and the game isnt even trying to match you up with proper players 
---
This 6 thing should be last resort but eh xD
---
my mans is ***bigg madd*** right now
---
I was doing agi + mad grit Legion last night and had a survivor cooperate and let me carry him the whole game... so good. People love it.
---
but like how would that work in the game?
---
Amazing feeling. Basically kick a gen back to 50% from full.
---
Survivors rank up really easily and quickly so there are more killers than survivors at the same rank in low ranks and the queues reflect that. In high ranks there are more survivors than killers at the same rank making survivors queues long and killer queues short.
---
Exactly
---
Don't risk getting tunneled by the killer for having a key because the green key is fucking useless
---
Thanks for the post, op.
---
What bothers me is how some are just so tall yet when you plas as them you never really get their actual height (like Oni, the game just shows your body then places the "camera" below his neck). Another small thing is how some Killers are so "curved". But oh well, at least that makes them look better/more different from others.
---
Hmm farmer build....ho i know the farmer skin on hillbily so u can be a real farmer !
---
You could run that increased terror radius perk and BBQ with a survivor pudding on legion or Gorgon. They‚Äôre really easy to get lots of points
---
Congrats , it's a good feeling man :)
---
Wouldn't work in high ranks as most good players don't heal themselves, they play injured until they find another survivor. Actually, I suspect they wouldn't even both healing at all since it would be a waste of time. Legion's power still does nothing but apply a status effect survivors don't care about, At least with deep wounds you force survivors to mend. Now survivors can just immediately go back on gens because Legion is still a m1 killer that can't do anything.
---
u free my bond perk slot
---
Doctor with distressing and bbq is my point farmer.
---
The con is the buildup. I‚Äôm too low surv to play against him, but most of my oni downs were zooming aimlessly and running into someone. They always try to dodge at the last second Ike you would a billy. Oni can‚Äôt turn fast but he can flick around corners, so you can‚Äôt run around a corner like you would a billy, almost like he is supposed to be stronger than billy with his power up. Just remember that he only gets 30 seconds of power every two downs, assuming people heal like they should
---
I'm too late but this has notified me I need to check out the jingle jam this year. That's like $15 it value right there.
---
Mori‚Äôs and keys are incredibly unbalanced and need removed imo
---
So if you hit a survivor with a basic attack you lost your power?
---
When he was downed by the killer the perk adrenaline from meg allows you to heal up one state so he went from down to just being injured the killer did not notice he had it
---
Thats what you get for not using head on
---
Ruin to slow down the game just a lil bit. Discordance to pressure gen rusher. Monitor abuse to sneak up on them and have the chance to down them with your power. Last perk could be: 1. Bbq for BP and info. 2. Play with your food for extra movement speed. 3. Pop goes the weassle to slow down the gen progress just a lil bit
---
Boomers gonna boomer. With how thick-headed most are, you'd probably be better off trying to explain quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee.
---
 Discordance, Thrill of the Hunt and any other perk or ad-on like them doesn't actually increase the bp limit just makes getting to the limit easier.
---
The only perk you need is Barbecue and Chili, which at the end of them game increase what you earn bypassing the limit.
---
As for killer, play which ever killer has the most points for landing their ability like the doctor with his shock therapy, the Demogorgan with shred, or Legion with Feral Frenzy
---
I still don't see the problem with his "nerf"
---
I'll give it a try, ty
---
Makes me hope we might get sweaters for the other two next year too
---
run boy run for survivor
---
What‚Äôs the error?
---
That's okay. I didn't know that trial was a mathematical term, I assumed you meant trials within the video game. Thanks for not picking on me, but teaching me :)
---
Jen has to be the biggest toxic survivor main pos I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. If you have Twitter, look through her tweets, mostly her replies. And if you catch any of her streams, then it speaks for itself. And Andre didn't say much, just acknowledged the situation through Paulie's tweet
---
Forgot about the offering Bloody Party Starter and Survivor Pudding increasing the gains at the end bypassing the limit.
---
&gt; make ranking up as survivor as difficult as killer.
---
i wish they would do this. i'm a mediocre survivor at best, but somehow i've bumbled my way into a rank 4. i feel like i don't deserve it because i'm rubbish.
---
I did the math and she would not have escaped if he had downed her. It would take her 34 seconds to get to the exit and her DS expires in 20 seconds.
---
Man this dude spitting fax and y'all be like "it's a game" but you don't like it when it's done to you, like Michael here was nice and memeing, but some people really a are annoying as fuck
---
‚ÄúGotdam I can‚Äôt SEE‚Äù
---
I get blood lodge with Myers a lot. It's nice because the map design is pretty open but it also sucks because.... it's pretty open. Still win with 3 gens left to finish though.
---
Recently hit red ranks for the first time and this shit speaks to me.
---
You do know that the Hag isn't the grandma, she's the granddaughter.
---
Well that massively blows :(
---
Look man, I'm gonna be real with you. I've been rank 1 survivor and killer more times than I can count. But, I'm sitting at rank 10 survivor right now because I haven't played survivor in a month. The solo experience feels too dreadful. Does that mean I belong in green ranks? Probably not and yet, rank reset decided this is where I should be. 
---
Let's look at the converse. When I play killer at red ranks, nearly half of the survivors I get could fool me for a green rank. They don't path optimally, they run in straight lines, I find them super immersed. I swear sometimes it feels the game gets easier the higher I rank up. It baffles me when I find that these survivors are red ranks but it shouldn't given how easy it is to rank up with on both sides. It just takes time or enough OP add ons available to everyone. 
---
TLDR; ranks are fucked and matchmaking is trying to balance a broken system
---
Try to get the game digitally or just wait until you‚Äôre 18 I guess :/ 
---
Unless you convince them otherwise, you can‚Äôt do much with strict parents
---
Ignore that dude... The game is toxic but not because of "face campers" or whatever else he said... That's just a way for a killer to kill you that he doesn't like. The game is toxic because there's about a 50% chance at the end of the game someone slinging shit at their team mates for not doing X better or one side bitching at the other over some made up rules.
---
OK? It takes time to get his power, and doing such a long turn blindly? Taking that away is just like why play Oni anymore he's practically a Billy copy but worse... Only thing he's got going for him is maneuvering in his power which btw survivors can hide from and waste
---
Be glad you don't.
---
No, when did I say that I did?
---
Litteraly tho
---
I get that Tru can be annoying and a lot of his opinions are crazy but that's no excuse to say he has a mental disability. If he really bothers you that much just ignore him. He's said multiple times he just wants to start a discussion, there's no reason to start insulting him for that.
---
We had a killer the other day walking into a corner and swinging. We didn't understand so we went up to him to get his attention. He never turned to us, but when one person went to work on a nearby gen his model teleported into the gen-grab animation and we were all confused as fuck. Promptly hooked, and in end game said "thanks for getting me unstuck."
---
And yet they no decapitate heads or limbs just to appeal to the north Korea of Japan (china) in the actual game
---
I'm a Doc main, and the only think I don't like about facing Calm Spirit is the fact that they don't scream when I hit them. it feels unsettling somehow, like it makes the survivors seem less human. Creeps me out.
---
not screaming from madness is no issue at all. they still get all the other effects, and I still find them shortly after the others, who I'm already busy with anyway. it buys them a few more seconds at best. I also see the score event so even if they're alone, I know they're there.
---
So just like league of legends.
---
Ruin is already RNG with how many skill checks you get. It shouldn't be put up to luck even more than it is now.
---
Oh my god let me tell you about it, I love each and every character in dead by daylight, the killers are all memorable and brutal, and the survivors are all sincere and feel so organic, and each chapter showcases how the team is pushing themselves and improving their skills, it‚Äôs amazing!
---
The only good use is letting of steam by actually killing People, but it almost always hits the wrong survivors, making that singular good thing a bad thing again.
---
Would this happen to be on console? The low amount of nurses and fairly low amount of Oni's, especially for a new killer, is why I ask. Not that nurse is super duper common on PC, but 2 out 136 is some stellar luck
---
Is this a Gael reference
---
He may not be the most powerful killer, but as far as BP count goes he can take a lot of other killer to school!
---
**Gasp**
---
 I surprise the que for survivor is so long.
---
I cant tell you what it fully means, but basically he‚Äôs saying things are random. One game something will be one way, and the next game same map; it‚Äôll be different. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre gonna get. Say Hatch Spawns are RNG. Not in a set spot. Or you really want bbq you in the blood web but RNG said nope get what i give you
---
It's not intended to make him a Tier 1 god, but to improve him while keeping the current playstyle. Without addons his power being a "all 4 survivors suffer from Exposed" being the goal/most common outcome should be a good start.
---
Eh, I've tried not to 'shame' anyone, hoping the mods can see  that. Only attempted to recap what a wild ride today has been.
---
While I'm certainly not unbiased and will never claim to be when it comes to these streamers, I've tried to leave Scott and Jen out of these with the exception of pointing out the hypocrisy of the situation. They've actually both stayed out of this as far as I know so shouldn't be having any mud flung their way.
---
Counter arguments, you're not completing one of the objectives in the game, which is cleansing totems. Good killers are forced to do more than chase survivors, like breaking pallets, kicking generators, hook survivors. Why should the killer be the only one having to do more than 1 complete a generator, 2 run killer around the map 3 unhooking 4 occasionally healing. Survivors are also 4v1, so they can often split the labor unlike the killer who has to solo everything. Sometimes 1 survivor is good enough to kite the killer around the entire map for 2-3 generators, which leaves the other 3 with plenty of time and effort to find totems, repair generators etc. Even if you bring things in like flashlight saves, pallet saves etc, that's still a minimal amount of extra work for most survivors.
---
As for Mori, that's the ONLY way that a killer can ignore a majority of survivor's perks. Without them survivors have a much higher chance of getting out without dying by never being in a situation where they have to use DS. Not only that, but if you're only at risk of being Mori'ed at the EGC, then that'd be 1 person likely dying, and if they'd only be getting out because of DS I would say that's totally fine, because that's the only counter to DS during EGC most of the time. Not just that, but Mori also incentivizes survivors not to act like idiots when unhooked. Can't count the number of times that when I go back to find the person that got unhooked I just find the survivor that was unhook running away from a generator. Or generally just running out in the open knowing I can't do anything to them.
---
I could think of plenty of other ways in which you could argue NOED and Mori are as balanced as some survivor perks. Mori is also something that survivors can anticipate and be played around. Again, it would make it so people strive to improve and get better at kiting a killer.
---
You're setting up excuses for mechanics in the game. If BHVR thought that Moris and NOED were really THAT unfair and NOED was making THAT big of an impact on end games and throwing it so far in the favor of killers it would be nerfed, changed, or removed. But no, people would rather setup false narratives of how much of an impact these things make.
---
Yeah i think you are absolutely right about that, but here's my view of it: the definition of viable is "capable of working successfully". A killer's objective is to catch and kill survivors, and the devs want more than 2 kills to be a win, so based on that, working successfully would mean killing an average of 2 per game would mean an average of wins and losses.
---
Every. Single. Killer meets this criteria except nurse on console. so by that logic, only console nurse is not viable, and that is by the TINIEST margin. That's why I say all killers are viable
---
Now I know many want their killers to beat optimal SWF groups, but that just really shouldn't be the case the way the game is designed right now. If solo queue survivors are given better chances similar to a SWF group, it will be absolutely fine to buff the "unviable" killers, because then they would probably need buffs to be viable, but they stay viable against anything except the tiny minority of sweaty SWF groups as it is right now and that's how it should be, as much as it sucks when you do come up against a strong SWF group.
---
The problem isn't whether a killer is viable or not, it's SWF having a major advantage that makes the weaker killers seem unviable. And that the ranking system is pretty fucked for killers so that makes killers unviable for those who base it on pipping as you said.
---
The reason I'm saying all killers are viable is because they are viable the way the game is designed, but I'm really just mad about all the "the devs are so survivor sided" comments like this one when, to my understanding, this was a very needed nerf so Oni couldn't just get close to you, do a 90 degree turn and insta-down you. Some people on here act like him having to slap 2 survivors before activating his power means survivors should all immediately go into the downed state when he activates it
---
don‚Äôt forget ash
---
Seems like a great idea, but the multiple killers option is impossible. It would have to be a new gamemode, not a special option for just 1 killer, it would be really hard to design for the game, and would be impossible to balance without the whole new gamemode. (On a side note: they should add a new game mode) the 4 killer swap idea sounds cool, even if there is the switching perks thing. It would be a nightmare to balance, but they clearly can't balance his current power, so I'm all for it. One can sprint, but can't attack, one can move slower (4.4 or 4.2), but have a small (16ish) terror radius. One that moves like a basic M1 killer, with maybe some ability to win chases better, or give the sprint legion the fast vault or pallet vault ability, with a slight delay between changing "form" and then have the last one have some tracking ability, but move slower? I don't know a good 4th ability, because most tracking powers are really strong, and would be really powerful with the other abilities. Let all of them M1 except for sprint form, who is just fast, but can't be used for chase except like billies saw to catch up to them between hits/pallets.
---
It's a really delicate ability, and it's obviously impossible to know how things would play out without it in the game.
---
I'm the opposite. I couldn't loop my grandmother so I always get crushed as survivor...
---
From what I read in the notes, it says that it triggers on any hit now and jas a cooldown of 3 seconds unlike before which was 27 seconds.
---
&gt;is that there are almost no red-rank killers playing.
---
Rank 1 killer: The pip system is to blame. You have to maintain like a 3-4k average to stay in red ranks. On some killers even with 3-4ks you can *still depip* (e.g. plague).
---
Are grown ass adults not allowed to be stupid and make dumb decisions? Because they do that all the time. It's easy to get caught up in the moment. You make mistakes and then you learn from them. October doesn't seem to be sorry for it but Edgar's apologized. She probably should apologize for the people she's offended even if she meant what she said as a joke. I still think it's being blown up way out of proportion. "Hey, this is insensitive and you've hurt a lot of people." vs. "I'm disgusted to my core and ashamed of this community, these people are awful human being."
---
Imagine
---
In all honesty, I don't use keys. I've got a lot I can give you. But please let me keep my medkits.
---
I mean you can disagree all you want. First hit happens at 6 second mark, hag recovers at 9, hatch opens at 14. Which means hag did have enough time.
---
Don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt see you ghost face
---
y u heff to be mad
---
ignorant.
---
yep just saw that, I'm blind as fuck
---
Who the fuck hides in lockers with a huntress?
---
Ntm, a survivor dieing on hook takes about 2 minutes if I'm correct.
---
How did she think she'd make that??
---
I actually Kobed on a NOED Ghost Face last night and got out. üòÇ
---
Well my point is Oni maneuvered better and could angle, hitting ppl at the right spot BUT he was on a time limit. He had to slug to get the most out of it otherwise his power is gone immediately. They took the angling hit away that made him fun. So, the only thing making Oni better than Billy's power now is that he can still run and maneuver better w/o bumping but as long as you're aware and in position, you can counter it.. Even easier now as ppl out of position can still avoid him (aka turn their brain off). Why play Oni when you can play Billy and have a power constantly (speaking of add-ons give Billy curve add-ons). Billy can be countered by loops as well but hey, better than Oni who's power is on a time limit and you're aware if he has it or not. Y'know? He's just a worse Billy from the looks of it now
---
That‚Äôs exactly how I am with nurse I can‚Äôt viably play her on console but love her cosmetics
---
Is there any sort of adapter or way to use a mouse on console?
---
Yeah, it doest get like that for me as well. I'm pretty sure it's sweaty SWF that think DC is better than getting sacrificed, that's why you never really see it as a survivor (it's just statistically unlikely as a solo-que to get matched with a three-man, and you will never see a four-man). It's the entitled 'im-not-having-fun-because-the-killer-hit-me-too-early' nonsense that... Well, that didn't really get fixed, since people now just suicide on hooks.
---
Looks normal to me
---
100% Agree.
---
I am still blown away by Clown the most. 
---
The way they did his Make-up and Pose so he looks slightly "melted" just adds to the creepy Clown Killer Visual so much, for example
---
That is true, one time I killed a Russian Claudette and her buddies fair and square and all of her buddies said you did good but that one Claudette said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trash‚Äù and then I say ‚Äúsays the one that died first‚Äù
---
Actually sometimes if I feel bad for the survivor I sometimes pick them up to let them ds me. If they don't have it, I let them go.
---
You dirty dirty little mori slut
---
This is PC. Nurse hasn't gotten much love lately
---
I do hide, and avoid chase as best I can, it just sucks spawning in, and literally 5 seconds later, spine chill procs and I'm in the terror radius
---
I'm perfectly content to stay in green ranks lmao I don't feel like getting dumpstered anymore than I already do
---
Yeah. the scream when survivors take a hit helps me track them too.
---
Feels bad man
---
It's just the best for controlling space. Since I've been playing more survivor, I've noticed how *key* gen selection is, and have been that much more aware of that element in my killer games, too. PGtW allows you to shut down a central gen entirely, if you really want.
---
Agreed - if it's not the best killer perk in the game, it certainly is my personal favorite, maybe tied with Devour Hope. Which, incidentally, goes very well with PGtW.
---
Clown mains rise up
---
Yeah that does suck, sometimes the spawn gods are not kind.
---
Some people really don't know how to grow the fuck up and be adults, no we're just gonna mock each other and call you a disable

When it melts
---
"Sad Demogorgon noises"
---
First of all, his power doesn't do anything except give you a hit at a safe pallet that is already unsafe so it's irrelevant. This is mainly effective when a survivor camps the pallet.
---
It's very, very rare that you can time a shock to deny a vault, pallet drop, or otherwise make good use of the power. It just doesn't happen very often. 
---
You move slower when you're in treatment, and when you shock there's a delay between the shock releasing, the shock hitting the survivor, and the shock affecting the surv, which is why said denying is difficult. Add in the fact that this removes bloodlust, and that switching modes makes you slow down a bit, it gives a good survivor more than enough time to simply...keep running and ignore a shocks effect should you time it right, unless they're in a deadzone.
---
Illusion pallets really aren't that strong, it's not hard for good survivors to know what pallets are used in the area they're in, which is also a reason, outside of the slows being really good, that people don't use Freddy for illusion pallets.
---
Huntress In Da Cum Jar

She Kinda Vibin doe
---
I would keep the timer but also deactivate it once you're healed. If you had time to stop and heal, then get downed again within a minute, you arent being tunneled. and that goes for even if you choose to heal right near the hook you just got off of. 
---
It also shouldnt activate from locker grabs. That's really just a cheap exploit, and expecting the killer to just let you go when you choose to fast locker hide in front of him is not counterplay. Especially when Enduring doesn't affect it anymore.
---
I can relate tbh. The autoaim likes to swing the camera in a weird circle. Most likely what happened.
---
DS rewards survivors who can‚Äôt loop killers after getting tunneled off of hook, FACT
---
fixed that for you.
---
&gt; but guess what? That doesn't make them immune to criticism or the consequences of their actions.
---
Never said it did. All I said was that the reactions are overblown for the "crime." I even provided an example of appropriate vs. overreaction. That's just my opinion on it anyway.  
---
&gt; Of course people can make "mistakes" (though I don't agree that this type of behavior from grown ass adults IS a mistake)
---
Regardless of an intentional mistake or an accidental mistake, it's still a mistake. You can't just disagree on the literal definition of a mistake. Her actions were definitely misguided and wrong.
---
So, wait times are not a thing for this one selfish asshole. Great. 
---
A majority of players are alt+tab'd to something else, because we are not going to stare at the lobby search for the duration, which some claim to be up to 20 minutes, but really average about 10 minutes or more. 
---
Get your head out of your ass, because you may get a lobby in 20 seconds, but the rest of us don't have that luxury.
---
If a survivor is chased after being hooked, it‚Äôs their teammates fault for making a terrible unhook
---
I actually like the DBD killers more than the licensed killers
---
Same here!
---
Doctor is weak once survivors figure out you can beat him by just prethrowing pallets and rushing gens because the doctor has crap map pressure. You can do good with him using good add-ons depending on the team, but struturely the killer is weak.
---
That's also the problem with Tru3's "tests". He's using strong add-ons to say a killer is better than another without taking into consideration what those other killers can do using some of their best add-ons. Is Wraith with Bone or Coxcomb Clapper better than Billy with Tuning Guide and Primer? Is it stronger than Huntress with Iri heads and Infantly Belt? The problem with using add-ons as the basis of your argument is that there are a lot of killers who get significantly stronger using their best add-ons. Is Wraith using his best add-ons able to do well in red ranks? Maybe. Is he better than killers that have a stronger base kit? No.
---
Ooofff I'm a hypocrite I guess.
---
I don't think things are always that black and white.  But sometimes you can't choose your team mates.  (like in solo queue)  Which if anything is all the more reason for this perk to exist.
---
Itd be cool if they did character shorts like Overwatch
---
Noooooo! Everyone on this sub has standards!!!!
---
How? In any way? Mending does almost literally nothing now. The worst possible way to take this change would be "Healing takes twice as long and can't be done without a team mate"
---
We aren't allowed to ask questions like that.

cute. This ranking system isn't working with skill at all. You can be true trash and still be in red ranks. I don't have to prove you anything. But she fucked up when she started to frenzy in the basement. This is so cute when u are defending this killer. Other way she played ok on that match. And thanks 4 your opinion &lt;3 And if you think that im not playing at red ranks, it's not my problem. Love ya &lt;3

Is it preventing you from getting bloodpoints and progressing?
---
It's the same when they tbag me. If it's a Nea, the hook will be her new home until Spider Jesus evicts her.
---
However, if it's a Dwight, I assume they have brain damage and their older brother is letting them play the xbox.
---
I enjoy legion as well but most good survivors will just immediately mend if you go for another survivor with frenzy. They won't bother healing, they'll just go back to doing a gen.
---
The best part was I was looping him god tier than I ran into the vault trap that I‚Äôm pretty sure I knew was there, it be like that. Yeah I agree he was kinda robbed it could‚Äôve went either way
---
It wastes 12 seconds per survivor up to 36 seconds (presuming you chase the 4th survivor) , that's almost half a gen, that's not nothing. Lol
---
Level 4 has o e for 2 saves in one game, that should be interesting
---
I think this clip is from the Halloween event.
---
I just really hate it when I down the person who makes the save, then down them, and get DS. I think a really good change to DS is that it is always active for an unhooked survivor until the killer hits a different survivor because it would still be used for anti tunnelling, but it wouldn‚Äôt reward bad survivors. idk that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
I was watching a DBD video at work one day and my phone connected to my supervisors blutooth speaker... That was a fun conversation! 
---
Just kidding he was really cool about it and he knew that I was super into DBD.
---
Dedicated server punishment doesn't exist yet either, despite them saying it does.    Used a second account to test it and found no punishment despite multiple dc in a row.
---
I love it.
---
9 Hags??? I think I've had 2 Hag games the last 3 months not even joking
---
The Game also has two of the safest pallets in the entire game above the basement, which are supported by 2 of the safest pallets right about them, supported by the dropdown into the bathroom, which leads to those 2 safe pallets.
---
There's at least 2 others that I can remember that are also omega safe, one being the pallet behind one of the stairs.
---
The others I agree with for sure
---
That would be so busted lmao no
---
I was looking through the posts about people claiming oni was nerfed... the only things I see are add-on fixes (which were justified) and turn adjustments (I never played oni so I don't know how sharp he can turn)
---
I'm suggesting the timer should stay, but also the perk should deactivate once you're healed. if you can do that, you're not being tunneled, and getting a DS stun after you already escaped to heal is just free invincibility.
---
LMAO brand new part crutch? its USELESS
---
this is wrong. you're taking the numerator and adding them together and forgetting the denominator. your overall chance of escaping is still only 4%. why? because 4/100 is your base. multiply it by three attempts, you have 12/300. it doesn't change the fraction or your percentage, it just gives you another 4% chance.
---
He definitely isn't better than Demo but I can respect the logic.
---
Issue with your idea is that there are so many safe pallets in the game that the only time fake pallets matter is when they run to a pallet that has already been thrown. Issue with that is that they are already ran to a bad area, they didn't go there because they saw a pallet, they went there because a pallet can spawn there. There are some scenarios where illusionary pallets matter, but it's not very often.
---
You realize she is small and weak right? There‚Äôs a reason why women don‚Äôt run motorcycle gangs in real life. That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not physically intimidating or effective.
---
Happened to me yesterday except it was a Jake and Meg
---
he's....dumb?
---
Even though the original 3 are basic they still look really unique and unmistakable. Which is really all you can ask for in a character design
---
I‚Äôm currently trying level her up for that nurses for my oni so yeah I‚Äôll keep leveling her up
---
Good luck on the escaping without being hooked using spine chill. Probably went through 20 matches trying to get that one done because I tend to be pretty altruistic.
---
Pop is very likely the strongest perk in the game, and in my opinion it's also one of the best-designed. It encourages you to play the way the game is balanced around (chase and go for hooks rather than slug or camp), and rewards you significantly for being successful in that and paying attention to where the survivors are working. It just rewards you for playing well. 
---
If you're not paying attention to what's going on in the map, or you're slugging or something, it's almost worthless. Really solid design.
---
All I want is the ability to run all three windstorms at once so I can run around the map at the speed of sound
---
That makes sense...    It won't work
---
I feel your pain
---
There was actual counterplay to him after they first nerfed the flick. It was completely fine after that and it was definetly fair considering all the things survivors could do to avoid it. The flick was also the ONLY skillfull thing about him. Now there isnt even a difference between a good and a bad oni player in terms of ability usage.
---
Not going to lie, when I see someone with DS that runs out in front of me like an idiot and doesn't even try to hide or starts jumping in lockers where I can't even get the slug to slow the game down a bit makes me want to tunnel. I want to run something other than Ruin so I need to be able to slug or generators can get done way too fast at red ranks without it.
---
seems normal to me
---
How tight were you clenching your butt cheeks is the real question
---
Yes and also on the fourth match I don't leave unless I'm downed first again. Which I might not be in which case I keep on
---
It is. The matchmaking is supposed to go from your rank -6 and +6 or something like that
---
Best thing I‚Äôve found is to play both sides a bit, even if you main one‚Äîgives you a good idea of how to play your role better/different by seeing what works and doesn‚Äôt work against others. But killing‚Äôs fun too. :P
---
He was top tier, not OP. Also, calling everyone who disagrees with you a killer main doesn't make you look very smart.
---
Ooh ok spicy ranking thank you !
---
Inspired by  [u/paulodasoo](https://www.reddit.com/user/paulodasoo/) post
---
What in the actual *fuck* did I just read?
---
I hope you have this typed out on a notepad or something, and didn't just type this in manually.
---
I would say that's valid.
---
Every offering that increases bloodpoint gain also increased the chance to encounter dcs or bugs :D these offerings are cursed
---
Trapper is my favorite. Just by looking at him you immediately get an unhinged  hard worker vibe which of course corresponds with his backstory. His appearance says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm big, I‚Äôm strong, and yes you should definitely be afraid of me.‚Äù
---
I like doing the battle bong wraith. Bone clapper+ blink. Chase survivors but while doing so, Bing bong at them continously. Big dick dominance assertive build
---
I mean I don‚Äôt really play killers that are badly affected by auto aim (besides legion) but my guess is that it‚Äôs for newer players. It should 100% be a feature that you can turn off like auto aim in all shooters
---
I did!
---
DS got reworked.
---
Lmao ok bud
---
What made her toxic?
---
What about decisive strike?
---
How tight can you clench them
---
its demo not demi
---
‚ÄúOh,I forgot that took 20 fucking minutes‚Äù
---
Play a dwight that's equipped with Nea perks. Win win.
---
Let's say, you brought a mori. Let's say, hypothetically, you brought an ebony mori even. Okay, and if you brought an ebony mori, you would be my dirty little mori slut right? Then hypothetically speaking, you would be my little memento slut. Now, let's say you're also a toxic killer. Now that we've established you're both mori slut and a toxic killer, I believe you'd agree with me when I say you deserve a teabagging. Am I not correct? You are a toxic killer, and I am a survivor. A toxic killer deserves a teabagging, and as I am Jeff, I am the one who must provide punishment.

He still is really fun

---
Assuming that the survivors are bad or have failed to acquire the necessary perks is not an argument for rebalancing something.
---
If you balance something so that a survivor without perks, without an understanding of how the killer functions to mitigate his or her effect, and without items (eg; medkits against Oni) can still be victorious then you're going to have an underpowered kill who gets ran around by survivors with perks, an understanding of how to mitigate the killer and how they function, and items.
---
True, when I first got the game I used it a lot so I guess I can see how it's strong. Thanks!
---
Generator Aura reading is OP.

I wish to know what was said

Idfk what's going on but I would like to say that paulie esther is a modern mister rogers

Billy with BBQ and Speed Limiter. Faster games = more games = faster bp farm. You either kill everyone quickly or you get genrushed to hell, either way you don't care because your goal is bps.
---
For comedic affect, run NOED to turn your saw back into instadowns in the endgame.
---
How is it not relevant? The hag couldn't grab her because hatch grab is not a thing
---
&gt; but here‚Äôs what most of you were wondering about
---
Who were wondering about DBD mobile exactly? I have personally tried it out and it's such a garbage port. If you are already playing the game on console/pc there is no way you would ever want to touch it on mobile, it's so bad.
---
More than that, rework them completely.
---
Is it usually that cancer for you trappers, I‚Äôm a legion main mostly so dw I also come from a world of hurt
---
I think it‚Äôs kind of weird that people still complain about ds about as much as they did before the nerf.
---
Is he made with those baby giant LEGO blocks üò≠ I love it
---
Not gonna lie dude this looks a lot more like Shugoki than Oni. Still nice meme tho
---
r/forhonor
---
There's lots of Fog Whisperers like that. There's a drag queen fog whisperer in my area who constantly calls survivors trash and bitches.
---
I feel like add ons in general should be smaller changes than they currently are, with better base kits.
---
True. They aren't guaranteed to work but, when they do its really punishing. Kinda like Freddy's pallets, they're a bit worse but you get to keep his other powers when you use them. They're inconsistent but make big swings if they work. Sometimes survivors will run into pallets on purpose to remove them which gives info and time. 
---
Thanks for understanding my side and being respectful. This sub normally has a lot of toxicity and I appreciate you not being a dick. Have a good day man.
---
I thought it was the season 1 demogorgan judging by some of its add-ons
---
sounds like you don't know what playing survivor against a sweaty try hard killer feels like
---
My issue with red ranks is that as soon as I touch purple my matches have 2-3 red ranks.  That shouldn‚Äôt be possible, otherwise ranking is useless.  This is part of my beef with SWF, it‚Äôs used to get around this.
---
Not every game will be a victory for the Killer, why is that such a bad thing? Both sides just gotta take an L and move on sometimes.
---
If he had lunged at the Nancy she wouldn't have been able to unhook the Bill and he could secure a kill. Maybe not both, but the Bill would've likely died.
---
Imagine survivors being able to turn more than 90 degrees. That'd be crazy, we better make it so survivors have to slowly turn to give killers a chance /s
---
Almost 100 dollars.
---
Mostly DLCs, but I bought a bunch of auric cells for Tapp cosmetics, and now Myers cosmetics.
---
Using the killers power is so 2016.
---
there he is
---
I mean with the 'flick' good Oni players could basically guarantee that they'll win every chase when in Rage mode or whatever.  It was like Hillbilly if he could turn corners at 90 degree angles with his chainsaw.
---
How to even stay at mid rank without depping on purpose? By just playing the game reguraly you rank up even if you die or escape. Too easy to  rank up.
---
I've played against Jen as a killer and played with her as a survivor and I can guarantee you neither of these are true.
---
That being said she rarely even plays DBD anymore. She's on the Classic WoW train now and she's having fun with it so more power to her.
---
I bought the Santa clown cosmetic knife in July, and Dwight sweater in September.
---
This is a great suggestion till you realize in like 3 months every survivor is going to be in red ranks.
---
I didnt say everytime they die. I just said that the times why the survivers are boosted is counted toward that stat.
---
Pretty kinky.
---
I agree on you there. Plus by just playing the game even if you die or escape you get to rank 1 eventually. Unless you play very little
---
They nerfed his flick, aka his ability go around tight corners and swing. This was the only thing that made him viable on loops against decent survivors.
---
I have done well on Meat Plant. Ormond too. Hawkins is my bane though
---
I was a 12 killer and I got four 7s. It happens sometimes.
---
Sadly every 4 game there is a ebony :) (at red ranks)
---
I know that.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if it was worth OP being upset over. If they were injured, then yeah, that‚Äôs pretty bad.
---
But if he was healthy OP should have been able to use his brain to figure out there was NOED
---
Don't know how I missed that. Thanks
---
Is save the best for last good on wraith. I‚Äôve been using it but I‚Äôve been thinking about swapping it out for pop or pwyf
---
bbq is mandatory, id use any killer that u feel comfortable with, legion is a good choice for maxing bloodpoints if u manage to get some hooks
---
All those perks are survivors lol
---
I can't speak for others, but it's not as simple as one case turning people against him.   
---
His ego and wonky idea of balance, and idea of 4k'ing not even necessarily a win for Killer (great fun for survivors I'm sure), hubris, and the sheer amount he moans and complains about things is what turns people off of him.
---
Its actually legi√≥n disguised as Meg , you can see the mask lol
---
The devs have already mentioned that they are going to do something about moris. They just havent said what they will change with them :)
---
&gt; Those reactions ARE overblown
---
Says you. Why are you right and everyone else wrong?
---
&gt;Intentional - done on purpose; deliberate.
---
Which describes this situation perfectly. She intentionally thought of a hurtful insult, she then intentionally typed it up, she then intentionally tweeted it out publicly, she even intentionally not-apologized. The other members of the community that liked or agreed with the tweet also did so intentionally. I just don't see how you can possible argue that these weren't all deliberate, intentional actions.
---
&gt;She clearly showed (and continues to show) faulty judgment. So... she's made and is making mistakes.
---
That can be used to defend literally anyone's actions about anything ever...By your own admission she continues to do it, so it's clearly not a mistake.
---
Not if they do some stupid shit like unhook them as soon as you turn around. If you're right there, it's worth the small time it takes to down the dude and then chase the other dude.
---
Killer main actually, I just understand that teabagging is not always toxic, especially when the gates are open and everyone is goofing around.
---
People in this community get offended over the stupidest shit. Lol
---
It's weird that ghost would be a brown add-on despite being great as all hell.
---
Legion is boring to play against. Their ability, perks and overall look are just so vanilla.
---
Found the teabagger
---
Do it! You know you want to.
---
This has the same logic that saying that it is fine if a survivor leads the killer to every other person in the game because he has fun doing that
---
&gt;  it's actually quite easy to 4k against players who don't know what they're doing, 
---
Well yeah. I'm not sure what point is being made there. "It's easy to beat potato opponents" isn't really a meaningful point.
---
&gt; and it's simple to 2k against 4-man SWF 
---
I think the issue is the game itself calls that a "loss" most of the time via the pip system. I think if the reworked the pip system 90% of killer bitching would vanish. They've said they balance around a 2k being a "draw", but 90% of the time at red ranks that's a depip.
---
I‚Äôd have to watch a video on how he works, the console description cuts off half way lol
---
This would be 10x as good if you put ace‚Äôs body with everyone‚Äôs beard

I'm rank 1 and about 1 hour ago I got a rank 16 Oni so...
---
I still don't understand why the hag has a bare titty. Like, I'm not going to be a prude about it, but it's just a weird design choice.
---
Just scratch marks / knife marks and Doom engravings / beast marks, but with no downside, would be fine for me.
---
Maybe make a few of the bad ones a bit better, but the engravings need to be meta.
---
Insta heals aren‚Äôt so insta anymore. Thank god because I really hated them.
---
I swear I thought oni was the tallest
---
**HER**
---
I play on Xbox so I suppose it's possible, don't play survivor often and I haven't played against a pig in a while though.
---
What is HER suppose to mean? Worst meme i have seen posted in a while.
---
It's indicative that there are players who can make a killer succeed, thus they are *viable*. This floppy attitude is maddening, "yeah sure the killer can get 4k, BUT THEY'RE NOT VIABLE." It's a complete fallacy.
---
I find visibility for survivors and scratches are much easier to track on Ormond and I just have a hard time managing Hawkins as killer or survivor
---
And then it gets closed
---
Siiick
---
*stalk mo--*

*Snapped out*

Say its better than bl one more time do it I dare you
---
Forgot the word done

This is actually a more balanced match than I've seen in days
---
No one cares
---
assuming that danny can be stealthy as fuck and kill people (presumably) easily i think he'd be the one clocking david around the corner
---
Auto correct my bad ima rewrite it
---
&gt;Keep being shit and being hardstuck purple. I'd say I'll see you in game but you're far too low ranked to ever be matched against me on either side lmfao. Like I said, go watch a fungoose stream and you'll quickly (or maybe not, seems you have double digit forest gump IQ) understand how terrible you are.
---
-Copypasta quote from an asshole who I got banned on this sub for harassing me outside of Reddit
---
Acting like Borrowed Time and Dead Hard have anything to do with this is irrelevant, since we can clearly see Nancy does not have BT, and Bill likely does not have DH judging from how he played.
---
 The Killer could swing at Bill under the risk of BT, and if he has it he gets out, oh well. Or he *doesn't* have it and you just hook him again. Or he has DS, and at this point Bill has used 2 perks to escape and Nancy has used 2 perks to escape. That doesn't seem *wrong* to me.
---
I mean you can leave right when the game starts to minimize negative interaction towards other players but it kind of sucks that to purposefully stay at mid ranks you usually have to just leave
---
Does it have to be through the gate, or can you use the hatch?
---
I had no add ons no perks and I had his default skin (rank 8 killer)  red rank survivors and they dc'd I have my messages set to friends only because I usually get hate mail so I'll never know how they felt that day lol
---
I agree with this a lot but survivors take a lot of this etiquette for granted. I play pig and most games I get some idiot who gets off the hook and goes to the box right next to them to get their trap off. Survivors will say it‚Äôs tunneling but what am I supposed to do, just pretend you aren‚Äôt there just because you might get mad?
---
You‚Äôre pretty stupid, aren‚Äôt you?
---
Either the survivor is doing that action because they are working with the killer - Which is specifically reportable and bannable. Or they are doing it because they are trying to save themselves from the killer, or sandbagging as BHVR calls it - Which is specifically not reportable and bannable.
---
So you completely ignore the fact that BHVR has specified what is and is not ‚Äúwithin the confines of the game mechanics‚Äù by giving a list of reportable/bannable actions.
---
So what exactly is wrong with my argument? If it‚Äôs within the confines of the mechanics and not reportable/bannable, it‚Äôs fair game.
---
Calm spirit has other useful applications such as not screaming when getting hooked and not screaming when getting hit :D
---
Survivor Freddy confirmed, explains his absence on Switch and Microsoft lol
---
I'd be fine without any of the changes I proposed if they'd fix the core problem of gens being fixed too fast at high ranks, coupled with see-through loops most killrs can't counter. but they don't show any sign of wanting to fix that, so here we are.
---
&gt; Says you. Why are you right and everyone else wrong?
---
I said it was my opinion. People also like to bandwagon. It doesn't mean they're right. It doesn't mean I'm right either. It's what I think about it.
---
You also missed the part where I said (and as the definition says) you can make intentional mistakes. Just because you made one mistake it doesn't mean your actions from then on aren't also mistakes (see: showing faulty judgement). What she's doing is digging a deeper hole. Nowhere am I defending her actions and nowhere have I implied or argued that these weren't deliberate, intentional, MISTAKES. You're way too hung up on the word choice and what you believe doesn't count as a mistake. 
---
All I've been saying is that people are overreacting, October and whoever else made a bunch of mistakes, and they should apologize for it. We don't need to burn them at the stake for what they did or said.
---
It WAS a challenge indeed. They did say they were looking into making them a bit easier though, so we can hope
---
If you like Ghostie you might like Pig. You can keep your stealth and in exchange you lose marking for bear traps. You can put survivors in time-out so that gens don't go as quickly and continue on your insidious, sneaky lil rampage
---
Wraith with the blight headgear is around the same height as plague if you include her headdress.
---
Damn. I‚Äôm about half way to P3 50 max perks for my killers. I probably would achieved it already, but I play survivor as well so I level them up also.
---
If not all of them, then definitely more of them! If i want to put a tiny plastic Claudette on my hooks I should be able to.
---
That actually sounds like a good trade ima think about that
---
&gt;  It takes time to get his power
---
Correct. It does. However power or not, he also has the unparalleled ability to track hurt survivors. It counters iron will, no mither (oddly), and all sorts of anti tracking perks. Lets also talk about how long it takes to get his power. If you boop a survivor with your shit stick, and they work on a gen. You later go to that gen, and suddenly you have enough orbs to completely gain your power.
---
&gt;  he's practically a Billy copy but worse
---
I mean, lets ignore his godlike tracking ability, and faster speeds, and his ability to instadown more than 1 player per hit like leatherface, sure. Also lest we forget that his entire power doesnt just go away after he stops, he keeps some progression. If we ignore all those wonderful traits, before the nerf he was just billy upgraded? Being able to turn a 90 like its nothing, never bonk on walls, and eat your asshole like it is Halloween candy. I get it, dead by daylight was BUILT to be a stealth game, not a game about escaping chases, however with the way the devs have pushed the game made stealth nonviable, considering the fact that many perks actively discourage it. With this in mind, survivors need to be able to escape chases. Imagine if spirit could still see everyone while in phase, and I said shit like: "It is only what made her fun! Now she is worse nurse!" Id sound like a nuthead. He had 0 counterplay besides play SWF and heal. Listen, I get that im not the best survivor player, I am a much better killer, however im not bad by any means. I know how to loop, and run killers around, escape and utilize my perks in the best manner available, however after KWF to practice against oni. He cant be ran unless it is a jungle gym, so god help you if you play cornfields, and need to do a gen in the corn.
---
It's not even 90 degrees. If it was you'd still be able to flick around corners. It's more like 50 degrees.
---
They should just make it default. Windstorm w Sloppy + nurses is great
---
This, I‚Äôll be like purple rank 8 and go up against like two rank 3 red survivors  and then two purple survivors that are my level and the skill level is super easy to tell between the two usually.
---
I prefer The Ghost and Coxcombed Clapper
---
I'd say he's the first killer on a tier list I'd consider good. People just put him real low. I'm happy for the buff but I think that clown or legion needs it more.
---
Sneaky build, I like
---
Agree, I'm really dissapointed at them honestly, hope they reconsider these changes. Have a good day too &lt;3
---
"i didnt sign up for this"
---
- danny "jed olsen" johnson, XXXX
---
I play against you in Ps4
---
Yeah I swear on console the turning is brutal and in desperate need of sensitivity options for him. I use him for the blood orb tracking mostly
---
(Killer or survivor**)
---
Not gonna lie I scream when he comes charging at me nerf or not
---
It's not worth it if you're using windstorm, but it allows you to quickly end a chase after getting the easy surprise hit after uncloaking. Good for shutting down unsafe hook rescues too, since Wraith ignores Borrowed Time if you're careful.
---
Behvr: not in the rules
---
But deranking is ok
---
I always imagine Oni at like 30 feet tall because he scares me
---
The problem that he sees with other killers is that they have to follow the survivors rules. That's why he likes his playstyle on Wraith and Ghostface so much, he doesn't have to chase, everyone else does. I personally don't agree with them being 3&amp;4 I just think that more killers are viable than people think. I'm not basing my argument on any one specific addon that's hard to find. Iri is replaceable, the tape isn't m. But, the tape is yellow, it's easy to get. Alot of killers have one to two "can't do without" addons. Huntress and clown have exhaustion, billy and bubba have insta saw, plague has vomit effectiveness. ect. I don't think it's a problem to consider addons as a part of a killer's viability of they're easy to get.
---
I feel like you bringing up gen rush is a bad point. Every killer can get gen rushed, it's not Doc exclusive. Not to mention there isn't such a thing as prethrowing pallets when you have the tape. You always have enough range to stop a pallet drop.
---
You're right, he doesn't have map pressure. But, he makes up for that in constant info. Being able to see the survivors is more important than getting to where they are quickly because you can't get to them if you don't know where they are. Without info, you're put in a guessing game where the speed is less consistent than the manifestations and screams.

Bruh don't mention the hivemind! It attracts them!
---
For context, Guy on hook was being hard camped and everyone else was on death hook while i hadnt been downed yet, so i went to the effort to give myself up because me on hook would give the others well over a minute... i immediately regretted my decision.  Ace also had dead hard so i knew he would make it away from the hook.
---
if i could, i'd teabag OP's post
---
Cool just making sure. I'll check back in a bit
---
Billy doesn't need insta-saw to be viable, his two common add-ons are good enough.
---
And probably the bulkiest
---
He wasn't shitting on anyone, just asking a question regarding the constant flow of said post.
---
I mean, you had to be at least somewhat tunneling for them to DS you.
---
Which fog whisperer was it?
---
the thing is it allows them to do really cocky things like unhooks in front of killer and work on gens and the killer can do nothing about it
---
Context: October/Octobies (Tofu's SO) posted a tweet along the lines of "Honestly I dont know why people shit talk Tru3talent, i find it very inspiring that someone with severe development disabilities can be sucessful on twitch" then EdgarAllenBro laughed at the joke too, and thats the jist of it.
---
Those aren't useful at all.  Screaming when you get hooked is whatever, same for getting hit.
---
If you watch Otz's video on him commenting about it, I see Tru3's point he can be good with the right perk and addon combination
---
For survivors definitely 
---
1 Adrenaline 
---
2Dead Hard (Or Balanced Landing both same imo)
---
3Prove Thy Self
---
4Spine Chill(or Resilience but with both it‚Äôs really good)
---
5Unbreakable(Quick and Quite can also be as good) 
---
Other perks are really good too but can be really situational which is why DS isn‚Äôt on here anymore the nerf really killed its value for me basically useless most times, I don‚Äôt play killer that much so idk which perks would be the best but this are definitely the best if not definitely top tier perks imo but I would also like to run different perks lmk what you think :)
---
If that‚Äôs the only skill involved, then he isn‚Äôt as completed as we thought he was. I personally wish they kept the flick and made the cooldown for his dash more punishing. You could just run into a loop and wait for the survivor to overcommit and get your free down.

Thanks! Unfortunately I didn't have OBS or shadow play running at the time to get my side of it.
---
Mostly just play to get better hatches and get my 4 bbq tokens
---
This is adorable and i love it. Please continue.
---
People thought Billy flick was as intended beforehand
---
Hag is basically a corpse, the only thing keeping her going is willpower and entity magic.
---
I get one very game. If not a d/c, then an instant suicide on hook. Been this bad for a few months..
---
honestly if i get into a match and see a Fog Whisperer charm, I know I'm about to have a really shitty match
---
I was being satirical.
---
So it did nothing
---
As an Ace main this makes me warm inside
---
&gt;October/Octobies
---
why the fuck would she post that lol
---
Thought wraith could look good with it too
---
This was so pure.
---
I‚Äôve actually been wanting to run quick and quiet and resilience but I just didn‚Äôt know what to switch it out for, thanks a bunch
---
I think people misunderstand what makes basement trapper scary. It‚Äôs not traps at the bottom of the stairs. It‚Äôs trapping the window and one of the exits, making leaving the shack extremely hard. 
---
I had a lil baby Jane teabag me after dropping shack pallet(and getting hit) within the first 45 seconds of the game.  She then camped an unsafe pallet, tea bagged after dropping it and went down.
---
I had to show her the reason not to do that so I drag her to basement, trap window and far door and run off to patrol gens on the near door side. Survivors have no trouble getting in and unhooking, but by then I am at the only safe exit and everyone is fucked.
---
Same case with trapper. I can't play trapper without running an extra traps add on and honing stone. Thankfully I dumped a lot of bloodpoints on trapper so I have quite the amount of add ons for these but still, you should not rely on add ons for a killer to be decent. It also removes add on variety
---
Definitely give Freddy a try if you have him. I've also started playing the Wraith lately and he's pretty fun, too.
---
I guess to make fun of Tru3 by saying he has "severe development disabilities"
---
I kinda forget but does calm spirit counter SFTS?
---
Idk I'm always at red rank for both survivor and killer and id say the only annoying thing is that you always vs the same killers with the same builds and a lot of noeds, not ebony mori every game though because with new ranking system it's hard to pip using one.
---
But did BHVR give conflicting statements about it after it was nerfed?
---
Lmao I see everything you just said at red ranks all the time, besides accusing the killer of wall hacks. Its soooo common for people to d/c when they're found first that I'll hardly even play solo queue anymore because once the first one quits someone else usually does too because they dont want to deal with it.
---
IKR its so weird, even some days even after multiple matches of trying I still miss half of them while on other days I will hit everything. They could give me the tiniest skillcheck in the world and I would still get it.
---
Nurse is floating, thats no fair
---
I'm just gonna stick my dick in red and dip. I dont need to go balls deep.
---
Still no response... :)
---
This Billy comparison is the most annoying to me. If people are going to bring up timed abilities, compare him to Myers. But that won‚Äôt make their tears seem worth it lol
---
More than ‚Äòsome‚Äô practice lol
---
Again this was when I watched her. Maybe shes different now but she used to be a total generic toxic claudette. I can assure you of that.
