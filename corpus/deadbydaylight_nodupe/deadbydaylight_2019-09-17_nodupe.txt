yeah that's every time a new batch of achievements comes out

She totally deserved that!
---
Is there a limit to how many hex perks I can use?
---
This is not "explaining your actions" this is using your personal issues to gain what you want.
---
Vaulting as a Nurse literally never happens so I always forget that she looks so hilarious doing it

Wax figure isnt a perk and the ability is horrible

Is this subreddit going through an iCarly phase? If so, what a blessing it is, I sobbed like a little bitch over the finale of iCarly
---
What about CST? I‚Äôm bad at math soooo
---
That's true, I still find it a bit much. 
---
Besides I dont want the next one to be any cooler license because next chapter doesn't get a map.
---
They were granting the rest of survivors and killers from the destruction that their battle their epic battle would bring
---
They aren't? I've had custom everything for a very very very long time. Still not banned.
---
It would be 10am-11am for you.
---
I never complain about those perks. I think they're perfect where they are tbh. I've played way more survivor than killer and hated the DS change at first but now think it's great for both sides. I run BT every game now as survivor too.
---
As a killer...survivors are often unhooked outside of BT range so it doesn't matter. If they are in range then I'll quickly find out who has BT either by hitting them or just by the way they play after being unhooked. If there's no obsession then there's no DS. If there's an obsession then I'll determine on the fly if it makes more sense to risk the DS or to find another survivor. If I see the unhooked of course I'll go to them, if I don't see them then I might make an educated guess on which direction they ran or maybe I heard a gen progress nearby.
---
Those are a couple things out of dozens going through my head as a killer. It's not as simple as tunneling vs. not tunneling or tunneling is bad or good. It depends on a hundred different variables. I'm far from the best killer but even for someone like me there's a lot that goes into playing killer.
---
Is the new chapter out?
---
It's saying make your choice and Discordance are better at tier 1. Make your choice is only good on tier one with a high mobility character.
---
"pretty safe." I'm not risking anything üò¨
---
Except for the fact that not all games will be farming games.  So you might wind up hardcore cucked in a match with nothing but + BP stuff.  Or you waste BPS on a group of gen rushers.

What‚Äôs a good build to run with doctor? Right now I have overcharge, whispers, bbq and ruin but I was thinking about adding unnerving presence and switching out ruin for something else but I‚Äôm at a loss. I usually main huntress but he‚Äôs such a fun killer to play. Any tips?
---
Technically, they can be. A small chance, but still. Also, the devs said they won't help anyone who got their account banned because of this.
---
I was just about to comment ‚Äú I love noob3 he‚Äôs so hot‚Äù
---
I find it hard that someone with NOED tier 3 BBQ tier 3 and RUIN tier 3  with OP addons for huntress is "new at the game" if they were new they shouldn't be learning how to play with crutches. Plus as a killer main I understand the map part, but DCing is no reaction to getting a bad map you play your best cards and try to win a game that's not in your favor. If they are a noob then that's a big feels bad, they just need to learn, if they aren't a noob then they're a big bitch that wanted to bully new players and deserved to be taught that using OP addons and meta perks don't make you a good killer.
---
A killer map. Fuck yes
---
Technically that room has a high kill count. "Its an evil fucking room" üòÅ
---
Everyone thinking it's IT but I feel like Carrie would be 1000 times better. We already have a Clown :/
---
not yet
---
These are nowhere near as bad as I imagined. After the god awful Bill achievement that came last update on Xbox, I was pretty certain this Chapter was going to further deny me 100% completion.
---
Imagine being first-person in a locker and hearing... "HERE'S JOHHNY!" and then he proceeds to pull you out. A passive of putting survivors into first-person for lockers so they cant see much is a cool thing to think about, probably terrible to ever have to implement.
---
The only limit is the 4 perk slots you're allowed. You can have every single totem be a Hex totem at the start of the match if you run Hex: Haunted Ground and 3 other Hex perks.
---
Ah okay
---
Funny interactions happen. The first half just didn‚Äôt seem like it played right.
---
100% agree. I just left a comment on my post basically saying the same thing. I've been in games doing 3 gens and running the killer around and I wont even see a pip but as soon as I save 1 or 2 people the pips come flowing in lol
---
Yes. Amazing ideas. The first perk is kinda power creep knock out but that is an easy fix.
---
Disguise don't work and they will never work.
---
My friends walking me home after a night where I promise I'm "only gonna get one drink"
---
Ok
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they openly said that stuff is completely fine, plus the anti cheat has never given me problems because of my icons. The only time is if you‚Äôre changing game files to get an advantage kinda thing, icons don‚Äôt apply.
---
Honestly that's smart. I'm the same, a tiny risk is enough of a risk..
---
Many people do claim that they got confirmation from EAC that it's not bannable and BHVR always said they dont specifically ban for it but.... better safe than sorry.
---
Just know if you ever did decide one day to do it, you have a good chance of not being perma-banned because if you do "trigger something"  then so does almost the whole player base. Everyone would be unbanned in a week.
---
Very Scary Exit haha
---
Demon slayer is so good
---
I always thought having a playback match mode like the one in Call Of Duty would be awesome, then you could watch whoever you wanted in each match after it's over. I can see why they wouldn't want to because if someone complained about another player, BHVR would be receiving thousands of clips with complaints attached. We can dream though :)
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
DBD has all kind of bugs, still such a great game.
---
If I get it I‚Äôll pay for someone else‚Äôs!
---
Wazzzzzzuuuuuuuup
---
Why's Borrowed Time a good perk? I have been using Bill since forever, and I played enough to get at rank \~10 3 times before rank reset (I normally don't play survivors).  
---
The only time I remember it triggered was when a killer was proxy camping on EGC and I went for the save.
---
I‚Äôll credit card it
---
But if Phil Swift were a killer, then it'd be a lot harder for survivors to survive cuz Phil Swift is OP, and he'd still be OP even if he got nerfed. Then again, the DBD team wouldn't even be able to nerf Phil Swift, because whatever perks they'd take from him, he'd take back and attach them to himself with Flex Tape
---
Killer should be Nora Dershlit
---
If we are talking purely characters that could be franchised -
---
Pinhead

Alien
---

Candyman
---

---

Jason (once the lawsuit is resolved)
---
Annabelle
---
Bates
---
Billy (black Christmas)
---
Just to name a few I would be happy with.
---
If I see a key I bring a green mori.
---
When‚Äôs the last time you tested it? In April (or shortly before) the devs removed their effect on vault speed. So unless they added it back super recently and no one decided to comment about it then it‚Äôs still gone
---
You dropped this
---
/s
---
Watch it guys, tough guy here telling people "get fucked" because he had a lucky escape.
---
I love Noob so much
---
Just watch videos from players like noob3 and otz and learn how to loop what the bets loops are and how long you can stall the killer
---
Somewhere from 10am to 2pm would be my guess tomorrrow
---
Seriously, I'm a champ at not spitting, Plague is the least gay of all, especially when trap daddy...üò≥
---
Honestly I used to not tunnel people so other people could have fun. Until I got fed up w how fast games go and realized that the most effective way to win the game is just to kill someone off ASAP to make it a 1v3.
---
I‚Äôve been tunneled plenty of times but completely understand why it happens - malicious or convenient tunneling. it‚Äôs a 1v4 after all.
---
thats why he is considered "The Horror Master"
---
Is this for pacific standard time also?
---
Had this happen to me with crows yesterday.
---
Fuck exclusives
---
Playing kyf with a full lobby is pretty much casual mode.
---
Deliverance , head on, ds, self care get that juicy stun combo and at any pallet self care Infront of the killer
---
No, not technically. EAC has said they won't ban for it, and BHVR said they won't either. EAC doesn't scan the UI files when searching for modified files, so in no way would it ever detect custom icons. Don't spread misinformation.
---
man I wonder who
---
You sound very lucky
---
I do lmao. I don‚Äôt know what any perk symbols are pretty much, but I know what they all do
---
Could y‚Äôall stop being perverted? Jesus Christ
---
na
---
Great for SWF and when youre 3 genned. It can potentially waste the killers time if they decide to go after the unhooked person and the unhooked person can tank a hit for their teammates for the window theyre invincible.
---
That said, its not useful if youre playing solo unless youre trying to be altruistic. I dont really run it unless im doing some sort of daily or am playing with someone
---
Aw
---
The deadlights is a perfect name for him!
---
That whole statement was dumb on Behaviors behalf, who creates a horror game that doesn't attempt to inflict fear and who plays said game if they don't want to be scared?
---
I would pay money to have that be said when he puts a survivor on their death hook.
---
They got Bruce Campbell. So I'm sure they'd be able to too.

Pepsi color scheme and symbol
---
Was hoping for a original idea after stranger things but oh well.
---
The plague, huntress and legion are all so well designed as far as lore and style. Would love to see more ideas like this. With helpful powers that is *cough* Legion *cough*
---
rango is so underrated
---
Pretty sure it's not
---
LMAO obviously! It's a ballpark based on how popular it is and that there is a whole sub dedicated to custom icons like... you really thought I was being exact with my numbers?? Haahhaha
---
Watch the video, you‚Äôll understand his reasoning then. Sure it gives you more time but also a longer cooldown.
---
His Lullaby is lowkey one of his best features
---
Where did you get that EAC doesn't scan UI files ? It's been widely known that it can be detected as modified and you can potentially get banned for it. "Use the custom perks at your own risk" is what the devs say legit every time someone asks if they can get banned. There's no full answer to this, so please don't say it's 100% safe because it's not.
---
Why did this get platinum?
---
im a total newbie and ranked up super fast the first day. i would assume its not that hard with wins in a row. then now i hit 15 and got my ass whooped lol. but still i agree it shouldnt be that hard to get up there and out of the noob pile
---
It is one of the few good trapper maps. Good luck finding even regular traps. If they're darkened then RIP.
---
It's a good map to force a 3 gen too as they typically spawn near each other
---
The biggest advantage of that map and why I don't hate it is because there are like 8 pallets on the whole map lol
---
Thank you for this
---
the problem with WGLF isn't the difficulty of gaining stacks. It's the fact that the perk effectively does nothing whatsoever in-game.
---
I would say it should grant some kind of boost to you when taking protection hits. Since all of David's perk revolve around being in the fight and getting roughed up it would thematically fit the theme of his perks as well as go along with how you currently receive stacks in the first place.
---
Something like making the sprint burst after getting hit while protecting someone is 1-2 seconds longer, maybe you gain a boost to certain actions for X seconds after taking a hit for someone.
---
There‚Äôs also the issue that someone without any Obsession perks can be the Obsession while everyone else has DS. (It‚Äôs happened to me quite a few times.)
---
I‚Äôm fine with Obsession switching over to a new survivor if they use DS in the middle of a match, because (as discussed) being the Obsession can also carry extra risk. If someone wants to use DS they know they will immediately become the Obsession, and I‚Äôm happy with that change.
---
With a little sugar mhmmm
---
People gonna need a new dream DLC after Stranger Things and (probably) It.
---
Hellraiser when??
---
Insert John Cena meme here ^
---
Like too many survivors.
---
3-4 escape = "gg!"
---
4k ? "lol n00b [camper, tunneler, slugger, NOED/whateverperkreally] F u!"
---
zoe saldana? now we just need james cameron
---
The reason the parents couldn't see the blood is because IT already had the entire town under his influence, which explains the library/librarian scene and when Ben was getting bullied and the adults kept driving, it's not that only the kids can see it, it's just that the adults are already effected which is also why despite thousands of missing kids no national guard or outside help ever arrived. Pennywise is beyond space and time and is definitely more powerful than the Entity, he could easily take over the world if he saw a need too.
---
Im sure we can understand where he's coming from. Ingame it can get pretty intense and we'll speak out whatever.
---
I haven't watched this guy but im definitely going to now
---
If you notice I was running dark devotion but I don‚Äôt know if that works on Freddy because of the lullaby
---
I would genuinely love if they added some of the joke chapters
---
That's a very specific circumstance. 
---
A disguise killer is Obliterated by the very existence of voice chat.
---
no doubt lol
---
As main survivor it is always too slow...but in reality it's perfect.
---
its all im gonna do is geekout all day tomorrow in front of my ps4
---
EAC has said that their Anti Cheat doesn't apply to icons,they look for cheaters in other ways and that we should ask the devs about this.Devs said that they don't care and that we should ask EAC about this. I was scared to use them too but I've been using for a while now and nothing happened,and I didn't see a single soul being banned for this.Pretty sure the devs say that because they don't own the Anti cheat and don't want to get responsible for anything
---
I want the drugs you're on.
---
YES its the worst killer map. lol blendette. she's a nturalborn ninja.
---
Fight em naked. No perks or addons. With The Clown!
---
not really, try playing killer and you¬¥ll realize its not perfect. needs fixing, games are way too fast
---
Well if you've seen either movie or read the book they probably would think the former.
---
It isn't like a case of Hillbilly VS. Leatherface where hillbilly took some inspiration from him, the argument of them being too similar doesn't even work.
---
Too fast when I am killer and too slow as survivor. :p
---
For Adrenaline, I was trying to think of a way to prevent it from just being a free health state, giving the exposed status would make the health state useless if the person got wreckless.
---
It's too slow when I'm playing survivor and too fast when I'm playing killer.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to disagree with you but wouldn‚Äôt you need to play both sides to state something like that?
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken by what you‚Äôre saying, it works the exact dame way on console, too.
---
I don't know what is happening here....

usually around 11am eastern time
---
Meh, I tried to make a meme and failed, life goes on.
---
As a killer, I feel like it's too fast. As a survivor, I feel like it's too slow. I think it's good how it is right now. All I really want is a rework for ~~Thanosphobia~~ Thanatophobia.
---
And it is just as common for a killer to get 2 hooks in 1 game. If they are afking, they get no points. Killers already get so many points without bbq, and it is also a VERY good perk even without the bloodpoint bonus. There is no reason to be so sparing with survivor bloodpoint gain.
---
I want a white suited clown now
---
I tried to make a meme based off of a game I had and apparently it's not taking. Oh Well.
---
Why did this get platinum LOL
---
*BIG BRAIN*
---
Implying Gibby wouldnt be the killer
---
With this and the protection hits as a condition  it would be a lot easier to get tokens. The ultimate farming combo would be WGLF and We'll make it.
---
i would love a game with no addons/items. Then maybe you're forced to use your character's 3 perks + 1 that can be anything.
---
That would be fun. It would certainly make survivors more diversified
---
I forgot.to save my  rituals bit I am ready. Gotta grind for another game or 2 and i will be at 1 million. I haven't told my friends about any of the gameplay against demo. Can't wait to hear them scream ü§™üòÇüòÇ
---
Who is better to level first for the perks? Nancy or Steve?
---
You press the circle button, I don‚Äôt own a PS4 but I think that‚Äôs the equivalent of the B button on Xbox
---
i really don't think that's the case
---
his appearance and the characters' perception of him for 90% of the movie is "big weird clown"
---
I honestly need to start saving my shards :(
---
same
---
That's sweet.  I will throw her a follow
---
It happens. Ive seen it a few times myself (on xbox). 
---
Cant comment on their actions but i might refuse hatch if the killer hadnt hooked anyone all match.
---
nice! i can close the hatch easily enuff. i was afraid it would be 'escape thru the hatch 30 times' that would have been hard
---
As others have mentioned, stay safe is similar to babysitter and the only other thing I'd change is to have alternate methods be used with any item, not just a toolbox, that way it has more utility.
---
yeah I‚Äôm definitely going to be screaming a lot tomorrow as well
---
i did the Bill achievements, just gotta keep at it. took me weeks to get that long one
---
Very strong but seems extremely cool. I would 100% support this character with some big balance changes. Those perks are super original and with some heavy nerfs (in my opinion that‚Äôs what he needs) would be an awesome addition to the game.
---
I'd personally change Head On to We're Gonna Live Forever just as you already have an exhaustion perk (though I know sometimes people like running two different ones together) 
---
And then Self Care for We'll Make It but it's your build so if what you're currently running fits your style then stay with it
---
Borrowed Time almost never leaves my loadout. It's essential for end game unhooks, or if the killer likes to camp or patrol the hook. It can also be used strategically when you wait for the killer to come back before unhooking.
---
If I get saved close to the killer and the unhooking person doesn't have BT, they'd better stick around to take the hit. Sure, I guess I could run DS, but why should everyone have to use a slot on DS when one person running Borrowed Time can jump in and make sure that there's a safe unhook?
---
Neither did the Demogorgon and now here we are. IT is a huge name in modern horror right now it just makes sense in the way Stranger Things does it‚Äôll bring in more people to DBD:

This makes me so uncomfortable like why is the anti septic green and the Anti hemorrhagic syringe Purple? Man they were weird with how they rated items back then

I'm pretty sure that is what happened to me last time because I couldn't move off of rank 4! I would do enough to basically double pip and not pip. Was super annoying. But I hope this issue gets fixed for you,  I'm hating green ranks,  I'd die playing with most rank 16s :/
---
EAC has replied to many tickets of people asking about it and they've replied, "EAC will not pick up and ban the modifying of the png files in the game." Those are the potraits, perks, etc in the UI folder. It's the whole, "Go ask mom, go ask dad" back a forth that BHVR and EAC have. Both have said they won't ban you. The info is out there, I've seen it all over this sub.
---
No it's not a nessisity at high ranks at all. Just apply map pressure in other ways
---
Yeah sort of, tried to give this survivor hatch twice, kept wiggling off, then I chased her around and she just ended up jumping into the hatch herself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I had many matches, where the gens couldn't be finished and the killer got a 4k. This is my experience I made.
---
Sorry man, some of us just have passion for these things, and I agreed with the demogorgon case as well. Honestly, if they just removed the entity from DBD, then it wouldn't even be a problem. Just have it be a set of random cosmic events tied to the Fog that is causing worlds to collide and bam, these things can happen and each of our killers are still respected as being the apex of their backgrounds.
---
I‚Äôm going to be swapping out resilience for head on when I have the chance because I hear that it speeds up the vaultings

I‚Äôve only read the books with like 3 of those characters, and I only know of Cujo, I take back what I said about reading lots of Stephen King lmao. An Isaac from Children of the Corn would be a very interesting concept tho, I never considered that, only downside is we‚Äôd get an other corn map.
---
I really like these perks cause they are pretty balanced for both sides.
---
All of Behaviour's patches/dlcs come out on their time. The dlc will most likely release at 11am-12pm EST on thr 17th.
---
Pennywise is an ages old space being with mass power and pretty much an Entity of his own.
---
He makes ZERO lore sense serving The Entity.  It makes less sense than Michael ''Cut up the entire Thorn Cult to show them whose boss" Myers and Freddy ''I have my own damn dream realm" Krueger serving him. 
---
Alas Pennywise is still an icon and he's more than welcome to come join the game, but he just makes no sense when it comes to the lore of the game.
---
Story isn't a factor. The lore in dbd is always just handwaved "Entity did it like this" stuff.
---
We have alive and dead characters on both sides, some stories are made up, and some are based on real things or movies.
---
That second one is actually an amazing idea, tbh. After 60 seconds of continuous chase the killer gets a stun like DS from a pallet. Not so strong it'd get used every chase, but good enough that it'd get good effect when used.
---
You guys are all wrong. Obviously we are getting a killer with a cell phone, from the Cell story.
---
It‚Äôs not close to this bad on console. The most I‚Äôve ever wait is maybe 10 minutes. And if it meant getting a balanced game of like minded plays I‚Äôd wait it. It is obviously a legit hurdle though. With ST joking the game though they will see a big surge in players so maybe that could get us there.
---
I was the original guy that figured that out on twitter and told paulie, I remember them already following stephen King when I checked their follows originally and as paulie said, it seems they followed him a while ago. 
---
Even if they did just do it recently, the stranger things one was much more obvious. It was practically confirmed and the 2 survivors seemed like the most probable ones (and it was only them. 2 who are less major characters compared to Eleven, Will and the rest of the kids). Nancy's actor hasnt even being active on that page since 2016. It chapter 2 just came out. If they just followed them recently, then its probaly more likely due to the latest movie coming out.
---
I'm not saying that It shouldn't be released or wouldnt, I'd say it's likely but I'm just saying that this is very thin evidence to start going on the hype train.
---
Didnt stop him in the movies. Bitches get stabbed
---
IDK why it's saying these three JUST started following Stephen King, but that isn't the case. All three have been following him on Twitter for years. Something fishy is going on.
---
GIBBAAAAAAAY
---
The the Nurse a lot
---
 That's really the only way to learn her. Don't play to win, just think of it as practice. If a survivor runs you around for five minutes that's fine because you are just by playing her you're getting better.
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted high mobility Killers benefit from a lower tier of make your choice. 
---
The quicker you get to the hook you obviously get to the specific location but it also means that you're more likely to catch the specific survivor in question before they can become immersed. Meaning you are going to down them quicker and once you down them the expose effect is basically on cooldown at that point as they are already on the ground.
---
Whilst Killers without high mobility due to it taking longer to get to that location a lot of your time is going to be spent locating that survivor who if they were smart they would have been hiding at this point. So a longer duration is a lot more efficient.
---
I get what you mean, though that‚Äôs not what I meant. The Stand is more a post-apocalypse story with some supernatural stuff for good measure. I mean him and a map wouldn‚Äôt fit the horror backdrop of dbd

My point is the killer has to at least do something for those few hooks, this perk idea is nearly guaranteed to give points for no required effort, and that shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged
---
usually around 11am eastern

True but I live in a ghetto neighborhood soo it could mean people haven‚Äôt even seen dbd because they probably are trying to survive and like the game says ‚Äúdeath is not an escape‚Äù that implies to me but since I‚Äôll be spending it with my gf I should be good

Honestly bro just play basement trapper, I have so much fun running that. If not, use the first few minutes of the game to set ur traps down. Set them in common loops, set a trap in shack, and run ruin for sure so u don‚Äôt get gen rushed while ur setting ur traps down

Rule 8
---
Let‚Äôs all spam this, they‚Äôll have too
---
People don‚Äôt understand that the game is meant to be played however you want. I just move on to another match if I have a bad one. No point in dwelling on a bad match and letting it affect my performance.
---
You can do like me. Trap as you go. See a gen being worked on? Chances are theyll come back for it. Trap some pallets near it, come back and tada.
---
Or split the map in half and trap the edge of your side. Rally survivors from the other side and tada.
---
But really, trapper is mid tier and you will really need to sweat against other sweaty survivors. You have to still do optimal basic plays like pressure and rotation from hooks to gens
---
Can I get a blackface skin for meg
---
Shaming
---
lmao
---
Rule 3 as well
---
It‚Äôs too fast for high level play, too slow for low level play. But if you make it take longer you screw people over and make people do a boring action. If you shorten it then the killers will give up on this game
---
The prophecy...
---
I was gonna say this
---
feelings over facts, don''t you ever forget it.
---
Where are you getting the Plague or Billy from?? His idea is to have the killer disguise himself as a survivor, not a killer. Damn you need to read posts better before you comment.
---
Its just used to slow the game down by making everyone mend and locating survivors besides that he has no purpose and is just bad
---
Aww I was hoping it would have been Joey salad

It'd be incredibly aids. Killer would just be forced onto Legion or LF or some other garbage killer.

She's one of those characters you have to have the patience to learn. While I personally did not, I'm sure if you stick to it and keep at it, you'll eventually start to find her more viable.
---
Thanks!
---
if you multiply it by how many cheeks bubbas ass has then yes
---
The one that reduces you to one trap is preeetty bad if we're being honest, cause 12 meters is pretty small.  Itd be okay if it was a larger radius for the wall hacks, but eh.  
---
  
---
The one that *really* hurts is the one that lets you see their aura when theyre taking off the trap.  It means you cant patrol boxes, and the aura reading is pretty awful.  
---
The skill check frequency ones (like the razor blade) are debatable.  Against lower ranks their decent, however if the person doing the box is semi decent at skill checks, theyre more likely to get greats, so having more skillchecks hurts you here.  (That said, if youre running a hard skillcheck build, these can be pretty fun to run)  
---
The rest are okay, I guess.  They won't hurt to run, but they either need to be paired carefully (such as the one that extends your timer with tampered), or just wont help you 90% of the time.  
---
Some of her best addons are Combat Straps (cuts crouch speed by 50% btw) / VHS, despite being brown / yellow, respectively.

Behavior is toxic not perk or character choices. If you play like a good sport and leave opportunity for everyone to have a good time, then you‚Äôre not toxic. If you go out of your way to ruin or interfere with another person‚Äôs fun in an unsportsmanlike way then you become toxic.

Ooh that‚Äôs pretty easy

Whats weird is I did this exact method, with Nea, with the exact same clothes yesterday.
---
Yes, but without a map which is the past is any indication, means just a killer with no survivor or map. Ghost face was also a chapter don't forget, and he did not come with a map or survivor. So most likely it's just a new killer, most likely licensed like ghost face was. You feel me?
---
Yeah, being at a disadvantage isn't nearly as bad as having to deal with egotistical assholes in general.
---
It's in a good place unless you run into an organized team or a group of focused players. 
---
I've had "chases" where the survivor doesn't even loop. They simply run from pallet to pallet to pallet throwing them down early.  All of a sudden 3 gens are gone.

Honestly, I D/C Killer games where I'm convinced my opponents are awful people and going to give me a miserible time, but it looks like if you talk about D/Cing, you get downvoted here, regardless of how or why.
---
I mean you can play however you want, but sweaty tactics like this are literally punished by losing points/gen patrolling time. So you can say that you CAN play however you want, but if pure getting punished for it, it‚Äôs not the right way
---
No clue man. I tend to lean on the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre teens, and teens are fucking stupid‚Äù explanation. But without actually meeting these people we‚Äôll never know.

---
I'd say about 10.000.000 at the very max. 
---
Twice recently I kept track of how long it would take me to go from 0 to 1.000.000 bloodpoints playing nothing but killer with BBQ. Both times it took me roughly 6 hours (including queue time). 
---
If you play without BBQ or you play survivor in between, this time estimation increases. 
---
If you play nothing but survivor, the amount of time required to get to 1.000.000 would be way bigger than killer.
---
I'm not sure why people feel Stay Safe is close to Babysitter.  Yes, they both remove scratch marks for a timed duration, but that's the only similarities.  Babysitter also removes blood pools and causes the rescuer to have a temporary OoO.  Stay Safe doesn't remove blood pools, but the one rescued gains a 50% health regen.
---
I do agree with others that Alternative Use needs to be all items.  Other than that this is spectacular work!
---
Does T3 Iron Will stack with T3 Stridor? For example, if there was an injured survivor with T3 Iron Will and a killer with T3 Stridor, would the killer hear the survivor at 50% volume?
---
Amd that's a downvote.
---
When I say fit in, I don‚Äôt mean they couldn‚Äôt make him work story wise, I mean that he sticks out like a sore thumb next these monstrosities. And I get what people are saying too, I‚Äôm just saying that of the many Stephen king creatures and such he is just one of the most out of place to be a killer in the game. People have nightmares about Freddy but no one is really scared of Flagg outside the story universe. He‚Äôs intimidating, but not scary like a ghost or boogeyman. Similar arguments could be made for Michael and Leatherface but they also come from franchises associated with horror and therefore fit in.

I mean when you‚Äôre experienced and get a noob killer it‚Äôs relaxing sure but slaying them in the worst way possible? What‚Äôs the point of that? That‚Äôs just making a sucky high rank killer who will slay you back in about a month
---
it makes a bit of sense to me because i heard the devs said the next chapter would be another stand alone killer so i feel like it would be a licensed DLC, (they havent released original singles before) and they‚Äôre following the same twitter pattern as the Ash and Stranger Things DLCs. It also makes sense that it would be a solo killer bc IT was really centered around the kids and the devs said before they wouldnt add children to the game. could be wrong though since IT Ch 2 was focused on them as adults.

Send a support email indicating the number of hours played and your unique id number. They will compensate BPs. (Source: 2 years ago, i lost all progress with all chars id leveled.

If you'd use your eyes and read Freddy's bio like I did, you'd know.

You refuse to be wrong and I'm too unbothered to care as of right...now. Deuces.
---
Does no one find it even slightly cool? I saw an adrenaline king and thought it was dope af
---
For solo queue, gen timer is fine.
---
Unfortunately, like most other parts of the game - swf breaks it. The game was designed to have minimal coordination between survivors, but in fairness to BHVR - it's not like online video games have a history of people using voip to communicate.
---
Brilliant!
---
Which offerings will be hidden before the start of a game? As survivor I always assume it will be a Mori although could it be anything else? Also as killer sometimes I see hidden offerings from the survivor, what could they be?
---
To be fair, I get DSed even when some shmuck pulls the survivor off the hook two seconds after I put them on there, which isn't even tunneling.
---
Heck stick a toolbox and resilience on the survivor and I've caught them injured after they soloed a generator from 0% to 100% and *still get DSed*.
---
Not to mention when you're not tunneling but they run into your face, and still get to DS you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
At this point I just assume I'm going to eat the Decisive Strike no matter what happens, and it's better to make it happen early in a dead zone rather than later while the gates are open. If they don't have it (or miss it) then it's free.
---
Okay fuck you.
---
I'm not sure I understand, but I feel what I was trying to say still applies. Let's say you get rank 1 with Spirit and decide you wanna play Wraith at rank 20. Now you get paired against likely new players who don't know how to loop, do gens, etc. You as a rank 1 Spirit player know how to move around loops and properly mind game, so it'll be very hard for these new players to go against you. You're not really learning anything new, all you're doing is applying stuff you already know against players who know nothing. Each killer has niches but looping doesn't really change.
---
One more Plague question for the night: does Stridor help with hearing sick survivors?
---
It could be but the possibility of misuse is not always a reason to not try. I think if it were paired with a transparent reputation system it could very a powerful force for good. 
---
It‚Äôs not a matter of being good. It‚Äôs more about having fun. I could run more brutal perks than I do or be more unforgiving in the way I play. That‚Äôs just not as fun for me. I like playing to scare people and chase people and have a good time.
---
Seriously? players are that young? I thought I was in the minority being younger than 16, I mean I assumed they would be interested but I didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd be playing it- that would give sense on the toxic idiots though, but then reporting could be a possibility because isn‚Äôt it not allowed to be younger than 17 and playing? I know that counts for me as well but it could solve the toxic ones

I hate this map too, and DC immediatly as killer for it (reasoning below). If good offerings are used i wont tho.
---
This map is the worst for me because its all red/green/brown and I am colorblind. specifically i have deuteranopia which is basically red green colorblindness.
---
The map is too large for basic M1 killers to play in easily (like my main boi Myers) and for my broken eyes, its nigh impossible to see red scratch marks on. 
---
I hate it as much when i play survivor too. Those logs that are sometimes behind the bamboo are my worst enemy, and half the time i cant tell if im blending in or standing out when i try and stealth.
---
I'm just here to see someone whine about racism over a meme.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Coordinated groups can just play injured for Resilience with a toolbox, run all the generator perks, my math has been somewhat questionable before but I believe this combination knocks solo generator time to 40-ish seconds. Even without Resilience it gets pretty ridiculous.
---
Powering through a generator even though Ruin can and often does have three pop by the time you finish your first chase and hook the guy in high-level play, particularly since they start on the generators they spawn next to and it can take half a minute to spot one.
---
30 seconds to spot a survivor out of 64 (Engineer toolbox, no perks) to repair a generator means that even a Nurse who isn't spot-on-perfect with her teleports (even if she only gets juked twice, once before each successful hit) is going to see three pop by the time she hooks the first guy and gets her BBQ&amp;C proc, at least before she reaches any of the generators still being worked on.
---
Even then Nurse takes a lot of practice to blink effectively, there are times where I just don't move at all when blinking in the open for reasons I don't understand, the strongest killer still gets screwed....
---
Until you play against unskilled survivors.
---
There were 3 original killers in a row, before the past 2. Not to mention this entire game is a homage to horror movies. I‚Äôm all for people having their own opinions, but in this case please shut your cum receptacle.

Of course, if the devs can't be bothered to give Chucky the Nurse's hooking animation, they're certainly not adapting Christine or Cujo. It's just too bad we're not getting Jack, who'd fit the Killer design of "stick one gimmick and maybe a stealth mode on identical base characters."
---
‚ÄúMeh, they ran circles around me as killer so I reported them for something I don‚Äôt even know! SwF bAd!‚Äù
---
I think they capped it because before people would hack the game and give themselves millions of blood points. It‚Äôs very stupid though because the 1 million blood points cap is so low. If it has to be capped it should be like 5 million.
---
well it‚Äôs more like you can‚Äôt use the same strategy against spirit and nurse, unlike the rest of the cast
---
a recent patch changed it so hatchets don't count as hits, so afaik, it won't trigger the noed pop up. It doesn't apply Third Seal and Sloppy Butcher, so I presume other perks with similar effects don't work either.
---
Instadown killers I‚Äôd say. Bubba running this and Monitor would have a tiny terror radius and could pretty easily catch you off guard with the saw
---
I‚Äôd love a barebones mode where there is no aura reading, no Hud. To feel more immersed you know
---
Is that the one survivor gen?  At the very top of the map after you climb the staircase to the third floor?
---
We haven't even done the female killers yet.
---
Coulrophobia on The Plague. That might actually be the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard on DBD to date.  And I thought no mither/self care is bad.
---
What
---
Omg I'm loving all these iCarly memes.
---
well if the unhooker gets hooked, ds will still be active, once the person with ds is downed during the countdown, ds will stay active until you are picked up or healed
---
Where is my lasagna, John?
---
Amazon
---
I main ghostface, so i know he isnt worse, its just in direct comparison to myers, he is objectively worse at what he does. Which is stalking.
---
"Lmao bring iron will, quick and quiet and spine chill, they all counter spirit." if a killer's only counter is perks there is something wrong with their design. Standing skil is not ksill, its just unfun.
---
Nurse is getting eh own "rework" soon so its literally impossible to know what theyll do with her.
---
Imagine trying to fit all of that onto a perk
---
New killer: the milkman
---
Correct
---
hex: flex
---
New mori: Butter sock
---
If you are running Iri heads, Ruin, and NOED with the intent of shutting on newbies then you probably aren't actually that good. I don't  even run ruin on my top 3 killers in red ranks no less on rank reset. Lol
---
As long as they farmed or something, that‚Äôd be okay with me.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many matches I‚Äôve had where I equip Sweaty Add-Ons and a Mori/Pudding and met with some cute Survivors only to change pace entirely and just mess around.
---
It‚Äôs a nice change of pace every now and again. It beats being Gen Rushed and teabagged with no kill.
---
The game needs this. Especially since we haven't gotten some DBD original killers in a while. The last one was spirit or clown if I remember.
---
Missed opportunity for Adeptogoron name for achievement.
---
Are you the same ones who all D/C‚Äôd on that table when I was playing Hag?
---
All I could see was bodies all sprawled out on the table lmao
---
It really depends on the context and in my opinion, not at all.
---
By all means camping is a strategy of its own. If the survivors lose the game because you camped then they are the ones to blame since they are wasting their time trying to save a survivor who is inevitably going to die in the first place.
---
Camping in it self is just really boring and uninteractive for both the killer and survivor since it does not really benefit the both of you (you getting less points when you could have been chasing another survivor).
---
However if you were "camping" when the exit gates had already been open and you just wanted to secure a kill, then even more power to you! It's not your fault.
---
Also, camping is NOT bannable.
---
Hope this helped any!
---
Omg yes I want this now. She would be the killer and sue would be the surv. Maybe she could use her power to block vaults and pallets from being used while she is chasing someone and she could have a range weapon since she's telekinetic
---
This is the fuckin best bc my name on Xbox is New Uncle Rucus (forgot the K bc I was 11)
---
Seriously, David main here longing for a new outfit.
---
I think the best solution is to balance the game as a whole around coms. Add in game voice chat optionally. Add text commands maybe for people who are shy that have quick select options. And buff all the low-mid tier killers up and rework or balance them according to the new system. The game is literally split in half twice. Killers and survivors. Solo que and SWF. Saying a killer like Spirit or Hillbilly is balanced then saying ‚ÄúWell here‚Äôs Pig and her power does fuck all‚Äù is a bit ridiculous. I don‚Äôt expect every killer to be amazing tier but I want them to be viable and not be a pain in the ass every time a group played flawlessly against a killer who also played to their killers best ability. Poor wraith over here body blocking for hits at windows and pallets when killers like nurse and spirit ignore or have kits to bypass loops entirely.
---
You can buy the characters for 500 auric cells each or buy the whole dlc for 11.99 (with one extra cosmetic part for steve and one for nancy)
---
What did that post even say?
---
chandler's face tho, priceless
---
Wednesday. No love for you Aussie brothers :,(
---
Man I didn't know Dwight was a killer this whole time. Perks?
---
You can always make him Barbecue and Chilli...
---
There's a difference between being powerful and being miserable to play against. I main Spirit, I understand that these two killers can be beaten. But anyone with an understanding of the game and enough experience to make accurate predictions as to what survivors are doing/going to do are going to make the game miserable for the survivors.
---
Decisive isn't even that bad anymore, not really a valid comparison
---
I'm pretty sure it was a joke, chill dude.
---
Don‚Äôt quote me, but I think that‚Äôs what our archives/battle pass thing will be.
---
He ran in circles as a natural response to danger, creating a hellhole of scratchmarks in order to come to terms with the killer
---
Leave comments on what would be good Weekly Rituals
---
Holy cow that's amazing!!! Great work!! Want to steal but wont! üòÜ
---
Dozens of matches in a row. After a few days my survivor reactions and button memory was much better than my killer one. Then I just stuck with it. It's a relief to not have an aneurysm playing killer nonstop.
---
&gt;I have completed the tutorial, but I am still locked out of everything else. It's worth noting that the game isn't fully installed, and I'm using the "ready to start " feature on Xbox one
---
The ready to start feature is trash. Most games dont even give you access to a tutorial, just the main menu. Once the game finishes downloading you'll be fine
---
But then you just have a better monitor and abuse and a better furtive chase. Even at one smack, its already better than monitor because your terror radius is permanently 8 meters smaller, without ever having to worry about it growing bigger. And at two smacks, which is just one chase, most killers terror radius is already cut in half. If it isn't, then they're only one hit away from a permanent 0 terror radius. That's extremely powerful, and definitely warrants being a hex perk. Either make the terror radius reductions smaller, and I mean like a lot smaller, maybe 2 or 3 per smack? Otherwise, this outclasses a lot of stuff we already have, easily.
---
She's lonely ever since her mom died keep her company for a bit.
---
Cujo coming to dbd
---
Wait what did I say that made me seem that I‚Äôm not chill???? Lmaoo. 
---
I don‚Äôt see shitpost anywhere so it‚Äôs free reign to assume they‚Äôre serious.
---
Killers could look down to break LOS and end chases effectively nullifying the perk what‚Äôs your hot fix for that?
---
This is a good meme. I shall upvote
---
Any ideas as to witch killer and survivor I should start off with? I'm thinking about huntress as my killer, but I'm not sure.
---
Had a game like this I started working on a gen doing skillchecks and all knowing I was safe because the obsession was being chased somewhere else. Then out of nowhere the hag just teleports behind me and grabs me and also like 60% of then gen I did didnt actually register.
---
That would be cool actually
---
Thanks
---
Today's*
---
I'm assuming this doesn't stack
---
This is awesome ! STAY SAFE is a perk we‚Äôre getting tomorrow in the new dlc ( it‚Äôs similar but not exactly the same ) also for the alternative use , does it only have to be a toolbox ?
---
Yeah just slap the letter A onto the end and you're good to go
---
Probably to survive without anyone dieing several times or killing everyone in a match?
---
\*AGGRESSIVELY UPVOTES\*
---
Trapper for killer and meg as survivor, they are easy to understand and are good foundations to learning how perks and abilities work
---
Gibbies power is a giant fart that knocks you down and puts you into the dream state.
---
you bring up very good points. i hadn‚Äôt considered what would happen when there are no survivors left. thank you. maybe ds shouldn‚Äôt be changed
---
Why? Do you actually play this game FoR tHe LoRe?
---
The paper thin lore (that wasn't needed in the first place) doesn't add or subtract from the fun of the game in any way. It is just there, existing, for some reason.
---
Excuse me, but fuck you
---
If only two killers in the game are viable against 4xSWF there is something wrong with the design. 
---
Playing killer gives you way more unfun moments than survivor.
---
That Here Piggy Piggy is interesting (as a pre-buff Freddy main the idea of near-permanent long-distance auras sends tingles down my spine), but I feel it would be too powerful on Plague (and on Legion FWIW)
---
FUCK
---
... and switch the Prince with the Count, voil√† ez dollars
---
His perks rely on bloodlust cause he'll get looped 24/7
---
Hindsight's 20/20.
---
I'm not a very good runner, so I'd rather waste 20 seconds being cautious on a gen then get hooked!
---
gg ez
---
It's crazy how you're 2 minutes into the game and already 2 gens down with ruin. I also love that spine chill perk. As soon as it lights up you're already vaulting the window. Good job on the skill checks
---
My ace build has high double digits amounts of every item. His perks are just to get in, steal the killers treasures and dipping out. Goal is to get him to triple digits of everything.
---
And this is clearly you and your friend nice bait also
---
I know I'm not a bad legion but I still feel attacked and the camping legions and wraiths give us mains a bad name üò¢
---
Play both sides
---
For survivor don't be the first one caught, even if it means playing passively at the beginning
---
As the killer, don't get caught up too much in a chase, if you can't catch the guy go put pressure on gens. Don't chase people that want to be chased.
---
Anyone know when double blood points is going to happen.
---
It's trash it isn't an opinion it's a fact.
---
Cuz I'm broke
---
Awesome, thanks for the uh, heads-up!
---
Also when using pallets try to run around them to waste time and throw it when you can get a killer to lunge also
---
How am I not to enjoy it? It‚Äôs fun pressuring survivors away from gens. That‚Äôs what I use legion for, a surv with deep wound is unlikely to work on gens so inf mend is fun
---
Gotcha!
---
I need it so bad. Hold down active to hurl raw chicken across the fuckin map
---
I guess it's a personal preference, but hybridpanda, otzdarva, and tru3 are the 3 streamers I watch most. 
---
Noob3 is okay, but his whole presentation is a bit too much for my taste. I kind of lump him with Monto - streamers I check in on from time to time just to see what they're up to, but can't enjoy more than maybe a match.
---
Looping is running around in a circle for the purpose of eating up the killers time while your teammates repair generators
---
I'm here! Rank 3 Joe main at your service!
---
So when the survivors dont want to farm he has meta perks to kill with?
---
So glad you didn't do this to me when I bumped into you last night lol.
---
Enjoying legion is weird enought on its, not even talking about the inf mend. I mean i enjoy his skins and lore, but in game, even clown is more fun imo ofc
---
Can't be wrong about something I never said. Nice try, buddy.  
---
I was agreeing with phantom, not saying what you think I said.
---
I swear "toxic" is the most overused word since "epic" and that was like 7 years ago.
---
I used to play Michael a ton and reached high ranks consistently so I'll give you some tips.
---
Im not sure what you know already so Ill just dump common knowledge and my personal tips.
---
1st: Dont pop Evil Within 3 the second youre able to, get to to like 99% and activate it when youre in lunge range of someone your chasing.
---
2nd: Dont worry too much about stealth past Tier 1. Just stalk mid chase and try to 99% while doing a loop.
---
3rd: Try to manage your stalk and remember how much evil youve collected from which survivors. Each survivor only has a certain amount of evil you can get, so if you stalk all from one, make sure you kill them first if possible. Youre mostly going to want to stalk a little evil from each survivor
---
I like legion tho
---
Don‚Äôt play. Save your soul. If you are considering playing DO NOT PLAY KILLER. Survivors are awful to go against.
---
Most killers run a perk called BBQ&amp;Chili
---
Look it up on the wiki, but what it means for you as a survivor is that when someone gets hooked, the killer can see your aura (your highlight, think wallhacks) for 4 seconds. 
---
Be aware of this, you can easier pretend to go one direction then turn back 4 seconds later or otherwise they can't see you if you hide in a locker
---
Well share this with your friends lol
---
It's still AIDS. Don't do it.
---
#lynchthetwitch
---
I really cant understand why would you go for something you know is going to tilt the shit out of People, playing legion is already pretty bad for the end game chat.
---
Ability: ‚ÄúWatcha got there?‚Äù
---
Survivor throws a milkshake on the ground that can trip up the killer for 1-2-4 seconds
---
as someone who is creepily open about having an armpit fetish i just gotta say, i really wanna bury my face in those pits they look delicious
---
#Lynch The Twitch
---
The Demogorgon...
---
I like it. Share this post too, make it go up on trending for DBD lol
---
The rules of this subreddit say not to be offensive and that‚Äôs offensive to people with aids
---
The Entity is a spider
---
hell yes
---
Maybe one of the masks from Halloween 3 since they're within the rights of the franchise?
---
Because survivors are toxic.. simple as that
---
It's fixed, so no it wont get you banned. It's pretty shot though, so no point.
---
Bundle your tears up and shove them up your ass
---
I like tilting gen rushers that tilt me
---
Those are for the casuals(entertainment), if you Really want to learn watch Tru3Talent and Otzarva. Those 2 play Surv and Killer.
---
Hey, everybody has something. Tbh this is the first time I‚Äôve ever heard of this one though.
---
Boi I was kidding
---
I've had a lot of instances where this happens to men but not as long but still enough time to get downed. Ps4
---
So was I. Everyone knows they don't enforce the offensiveness rules here lmao
---
&gt;So when the survivors dont want to farm he has meta perks to kill with?
---
He is bringing Padded Jaws... With no chase perks and no basically no power, what is the point of meta perks?
---
The lab was so damn creepy and made me want to leave every time it popped up. There's something about that bass note that makes me nope out of that section of the lab.
---
I don't know what you mean. What's the hard lock?
---
You earn shards by earning xp, which is largely down to time played. You also get bonus points for your first survivor and killer game each day.
---
He says, ‚ÄúMy mom thinks I‚Äôm awesome‚Äù and gets a confidence, and speed boost, physically and on Generators
---
What?
---
All I said was this:
---
Why'd you gotta sit there and let me die lmao
---
Coulda unhooked I had ds and adrenaline 
---
Also you were full
---
Gg tho it's all g
---
Then he got all cunty at me
---
Also how TF are we friends? If youve ever used the psn app you would know that in the corner there where it says online friends it would have a number next to it if he was my friend and he would also have an icon there.
---
People are saying that the next chapter will be pennywise but I really hope it is not cause the next chapter is supposed to not have a map. I don't know about you but I would really enjoy map for it.
---
Nah mate, you've been exposedüòÇ
---
Truth be told brotha.
---
Ok, saying gen rush anironicly is bad for you. Why do you get tilted on People Who Just play the game how it's suppost to be played, they litteraly only have to do gens, if they dont do them they lose, you dont have to play tilting killers to win
---
Ooh, looks cool!
---
A recommendation, especially if you're gonna do Twitch streaming with face cam, is to get some darkening makeup around your mouth. If you can make the lower part of your face (where the mask doesn't cover) dark and nearly invisible, you'd have a really cool aesthetic going
---
Either way, it looks dope!
---
So bad it‚Äôs good
---
I thought you were talking to the killer. I was like it literally isn't his job to keep you alive lol
---
it seems to be mostly a gay guy thing. i havent met any women who are interested in armpits but ive met a ton of other men who like men who are into the armpit thing
---
Here's my rough tier list, just off the top of my head.
---
* Top tier: **Nurse**: I hate that this works with her since her blink+hits apply on hit effects. If this was really coming into the game I would want her on blink+hits to not work with it just because it's too much to have a low terror radius nurse flying around. 
---
* Real A tier: **Trapper, Clown, Doctor, Hag**: Each of these are heavly m1 reliant killers who by mid to late game should have landed a significant number of M1 hits. By the time the end game rolls around and survivors are fully deafened, then these killers can switch up their playstyle and become much more reliant on stealth and jump scares. 
---
* **Hag**: Hag is interesting here since she gets a lot of free m1 hits from her traps, but chasing and finding survivors isn't something she normally does.  That being said she benefits from only needing 3 hits to zero out her 24 meter terror radius, which could mean that a midgame playstyle switch from trap hag to creeping jump scare hag could be an effective strategy. Waterlogged shoe/scarred hand hag would 1000000% use it to become a better, spookier, body block Freddy.   
---
* Mid Tier: **Myers, Spirit, Wraith, Plague, Ghostface, Pig, Billy:** These killers are either better served by MaA, already have a full stealth mechanic, or don't M1 enough to satisfy this perk's requirement.
---
* **Ghostface, Spirit, Wraith, and Pig** already have a 0 terror radius effect on their kit, I cant really say whether or not this would be effective to double down on.
---
* **Billy** does use a chainsaw, but I could see a world where he dedicates the first half of the game to m1s and landing like a stealth fighter jet with chainsaws in the late game. Not sure though tbh.
---
* **Myers**: First thought everyone goes to, and I think it would be good for him but not with scratched mirror. Monitor works much faster for what tier 1 Myers wants to do (which is have 0 terror radius against everyone). Trying to use this for him would take so much time to get 4 hits across the board early, and it just wouldn't be effective. Now, vanity mirror Myers which is cannot currently get to 0 terror radius (tier 2 has 16 by default, and MaA only reduces by 8), would greatly benefit from having a way to get to 0 without having to deal with furtive chase. Honestly though, normal Myers would do fine with this perk just because its a simple stacking mechanic that works with all his attacks, and by the end of the game even with only 2 or three hits would be a lot stealthier than his normal 32 meters.  
---
* Low tier: **Legion, Cannibal, Huntress**
---
* **Freddy:** Lullaby
---
* **Huntress:** Lullaby
---
* **Cannibal:** Uses a chainsaw, and cannot suddenly arrive from no where like billy can.
---
* **Legion** would be bottom tier since FF doesnt apply on hit effects, and legion needs their Terror radius to find survivors in FF.
---
I‚Äôm shook.
---
Tbt I didn‚Äôt really expect it because idrfk and I haven‚Äôt been thinking much about it
---
Jesus as the survivor?
---
I just don‚Äôt like when the game starts and then 1 minute later there‚Äôs 1 gen left
---
I don't get how I was toxic
---
Everyone will probably dc on you man so it'll be pointless to use lol.
---
&gt;you really thought I was being exact with my numbers?? Haahhaha
---
Well there was no hint that you weren't being serious. I think you *were* being serious and are now backtracking to stop yourself from looking silly which hasn't really worked has it?
---
Death is not an escape, Jon.
---
Thank you for posting this! :)
---
usually around noon eastern time
---
This is obviously false. The next chapter will be a stand alone killer,so we sadly won't get Jon :(
---
I‚Äôm kink shaming vigo lmao
---
Will there be a Scoops ahoy Costume for steve ?
---
And once it‚Äôs out I‚Äôm immediately taking out my wallet
---
Honestly one of the few fan made perks I actually really liked
---
realistically, there are over 7.7 billion faces he can use. the face he did use would be luckier than all lottery winners combined. logically tho, there are also substitutes. crates, overturned buckets, etc. 
---
also how dare you lewd the wholesome lad like this
---
I've got 3900 hours myself, playing both sides. Also, is it possible that European killers are a lot harder to play against than NA killers? Cause I'm already watching streams on twitch, and YouTube videos from great players like No0b3 or Ussylis, those are the ones I consider really good survivors, just can't copy that and that's why I'm wondering ~~to whom I'll have to sell my soul, in order to be able to be that good~~ if EU killers are actually better in general than NA killers.
---
Yes!
---
A tad exaggerated but I understood what you‚Äôre saying.
---
He just turned 50
---
Thats toxic!!!
---
only survivors are allowed to body block.
---
NO WAIT
---
Carrie would be awesome, as much as I like Pennywise I'm sort of hoping for a curveball from one of King's other works.
---
No problem, I'm hyped for it to release. More achievements to get!
---
Swf is not toxic imo, Billy is not tilting you can Just 360 the living shit out of him, you can counter him if you have good positioning. Nurse and spirit tho, yeah, no fuck that
---
I don't get tilted when i Just see a legion i Just know half my team is going to dc
---
In the bloodweb. It's a generic perk available for all killers.
---
I recommend watching popular content creators such as ussylis or turetalent because they are really good at the game and they explain everything as they are doing it. Ussylis posts tutorial videos about how to loop and what to do against specific killers. But most importantly, TRUST YOUR GUT!!!! If you think a killer is going to double back, don‚Äôt fall for it, if you think the killer is abusing red stain then throw the pallet down early! After a couple of sessions you will have a sense of what to do. Remember, doubting yourself will get you killed 9/10 timez
---
Oh my god thank you so much!!!
---
Make sure you run Resilience it's honestly very underated increases vault speed by 9% too
---
There's been tournaments but not any you'd learn anything from, especially not with the shitshow that last one became
---
Me too dude me too
---
Yup i have the same thing on hillbilly 3 prestige probably something like 70 lvl still looking for bbq
---
I'll give some context probably shoulda done that
---
Okay so I got down because I made a stupid mistake but it resulted in last gen getting popped, so theres always that, once that happened i got hooked and one of the three healthy survivors got the door to 99, The killer started patrolling around but wasn't full on face camping, in fact he was throwing bottles and wasting his time reloading when he should've been paying attention to me. Then here comes this claudette, crouching behind a crate. The clown was looking away because i think someone behind me was opening a door? Anyway she had so many chances to unhook while she was fully healthy, somebody must have DS since there's an obsession and it's better to take the chance of me having it then not. Then she let my timer fully go down while she sat there not moving at all crouching behind that crate.
---
So yeah, it made sense to unhook, with two doors 99'd, me most likely having adrenaline since i'm playing Meg and i didn't let her heal me with last gen, and on top of all that a chance of me having decisive strike even if i didn't have adrenaline, OR the clown even was able to catch either one of us. 
---
Also idk what that last part means, he didn't get slugged or downed he was perfectly healthy.
---
I don't message every killer/survivor because something didn't go my way, i messaged this one survivor because he had every chance to save me off the hook and be a good TEAMmate to me. Also his excuse for not getting me was because he thought he wouldn't get extra points for the safe unhook. 
---
BP&gt;teamwork anyday!!!
---
Go fuck yourself
---
Tip: Pallets exist
---
1080 auric cells
---
Thats exactly what the splinters are for, to let you test it out so you buy it. Im sorry but your argument makes no sense.
---
probably same as all purple skins
---
haha why?
---
True very true. Obviously we can‚Äôt tell how long into the match it‚Äôs been and how much points each side has earned. I‚Äôm glad the girl in the video was at least acknowledging the killer and wondering if he or she would join in.
---
Is that a real question? Seems obvious why
---
I liked the old DS
---
So much for that idea
---
I would heavily recommend watching videos and tutorials on how to loop. For example, as you mentioned pallets. If you are getting chased don‚Äôt immediately throw down a pallet if you have distance. Run around the structure as many times as you can, using window vaults to make for time. When you have a gut feeling that you are going to get hit, throw down the pallet and force the killer to break it. This means that you play around that thrown down pallet, looping around the structure, vaulting windows and the dropped pallet in order to bait out more time from the killer. Once he finally breaks the pallet, just rinse and repeat the process. This is coming from an experienced purple ranked survivor main!!!
---
Yes
---
Huntress's perk, beast of prey. Doesn't work exactly how you wanted it too, but still..
---
That's what i heater about Freddy getting a rework and look where we are now
---
Try not to let it discourage you any. Kids aren't happy with going back to school so they're gonna take it out in your inbox.
---
I cry :c

Might have something to do with you being a throwaway account for some homophobic trolling

Did you forget to swap to your main before posting here or something?
---
Nah it will not happen

Yeah quite possibly, It‚Äôs a joke. That people can‚Äôt take anymore.

With the new dying light you'll want the obsession to die
---
:(
---
Why? There is nothing OP/unfair on Legion, just because you dont like its playstyle doesnt mean its Bad...also infinite mending isnt even a thing anymore
---
Rank 2. 
---
If my argument is invalidated then why do the top killer players in this community use it? ToFu, Otz, Tru3, etc...
---
Good argument!
---
I'm embarrassed for you.
---
What kind of change? "Small change" has me EXTREMELY worried, as Shred is the only thing keeping Demo above Legion-tier in chases
---
Fuck I love how Thanksgiving brings family together
---
So then that makes this perk too strong how?  And who are these certain killers?
---
Not necessarly. Just assumptions. Though the last one turned out to be right.
---
My guy!
---
Is anybody else saving bloodpoints for this?
---
I appreciate the feedback so far, and I mean a lot of this is just a number's question that would need to be reviewed after internal game play testing, or a ptb. Both of us are aiming at numbers that are hard to assess in theory.   
---
That being said, maybe think about it like this to get my perspective.   
---
In order to get a benefit from this perk, a killer has to invest time into hitting a Survivor 1-4 times. That's how much effort it takes to see a notable benefit from the perk right? So say they do that, now this survivor is now debuffed, but despite investing all that time into the one survivor, the perk is still dead vs everyone else. Whats more is, the weak survivor is probably closer to death hook since you've hit them so many times. So each second spent growing this specific person's debuff, you're also lowering the time for which that debuff will actually be benefiting you as the killer, since if they die their debuff count wont matter.   
---
Investing time to down someone, or getting 1- 4 hits can easily cost a generator or two that you cannot patrol while chasing someone. Of course you need to hit and down people, but the value of a perk is only as strong as what you pay for it in resources, this perk takes up a perk slot that could be used for tracking, or slowing down gens, or an instadown perk, or any other strong perk that gains massive value if used correctly. If this perk took 6 hits per person to reach full power it would be a gimmick perk, not a good one. The time it takes to hit someone 4 times is a very fair trade for a non lethal debuff. Taking 16 hits total to reach max power takes a long time to do if survivors aren't falling on your knife, popping insta heals, and or otherwise trying to get hit. That time easily translates to gens completed and gates opened long before this perk reaches the power it needs to be nasty.   
---
Either way, fun little debate. Obviously just a fan thing, and since I cant play test anything its doubtful I can prove anything. But that's my reasoning, and I still for the most part am sticking to it. Until real play data was gathered, it's impossible to say if I'm on the right balance spot.
---
Just add the part that deactivates the perk if someone is hooked during the duration of your perk and it‚Äôll be golden.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to someone on my team. I was playing against a friend killer and We spent two hours hitting her across the map, healing up and were 5 minutes from pushing her through the exit gates when she dc. Fuck you claudette
---
I see you don't close hatches.
---
Very strange joke
---
Anyway next time don't forget to swap to your main
---
I love that map since I enjoy playing stealthy. It‚Äôs irritating against Pig or Ghostface, though.
---
I don‚Äôt really mind it as Killer either, since I use Whispers to help weed people out.
---
He is unfun to play against
---
Bro fuck the stupid ass faggots hehe just kidding he he he
---
unless...
---
JuST dO BOneS
---
Haven't they been following him for months though?
---
What movie or show is that??
---
what's wrong wit it, u do kno gay euqual sin rite???????
---
for you....he was unfun and unfair because of bis broken Chase mechanic and infinite mending, thats gone now and 99% of the People I play against dont seem to mind Legion
---
I still think DS shouldn't have been nerfed and they should revert it back to normal.
---
TLDR?
---
I‚Äôve had games where I did three full gens by myself and only safety pipped because I didn‚Äôt make any saves.
---
Fuck that noise.
---
Roland Deschain survivor. As soon as you jump through the hatch, you land back in the start of a new game.
---
This puts ghostface a notch above
---
And a finger, but mostly cough meds
---
Because im sure there are plenty of people like me who don't want to buy the PS4 port or the Switch port because the grind is tedious
---
I love my switch, I love DBD, yet here I am not getting the switch port
---
Haha!!!! someone gets me XD
---
yeah get her!!
---
I mean, nea doesn‚Äôt fall for it and keeps running. Spirit can just phase and track her down, nea might  have been able to get away if she had iron will but that nea was going to die soon
---
13 reasons why
---
They already announced its a scuffed rolled up shirt
---
:) I‚Äôm working on being happy with myself every day I‚Äôll get there!
---
For Ps4 I think it's easier for survivors anyways. Especially if they connect a mouse and keyboard, the killer will be at a disadvantage. I can imagine how easy it would be to 360 a killer on PS4, unlike on PC. High ranked killers on PS4 will probably just wait for you to do the 360 and then try to hit you. And not many PS4 players would spend extra money just to have a keyboard and mouse on their consoles. Also, PC players are better at DBD because the game's first release was on PC, so there is no reason why they wouldn't be. I actually like going against solid killers, but it really seems like that the UK, Sweden and Germany do have the best killers in the world. Cause I don't know about the Koreans and if they perform that good at this game like in other games like League.
---
Yea I‚Äôve been playing with like 1 - 3 perks at rank 13 ish just so I don‚Äôt rank up and I still have fun and can use weaker killers and actually enjoy myself. I don‚Äôt enjoy having to sweat every game and I don‚Äôt even care how many people I kill I usually always saftey pip and try to avoid killing everyone
---
A lot do pay attention to footsteps but it‚Äôs too late more often than not
---
Also btw idk if it'll do anything but you might be able to make a support ticket to ask for your exclusives to be transferred, it's a long shot jut could work
---
Then i say price of a tapp skin
---
When will you ever balance killers based off high level play...
---
This bad balance designed for low levels drives the top level players away from high ranks and into low ranks, where they can have more fun and enjoy playing the killers and running the builds they want, but due to their superior skill to their newer or worse opponents... this ruins and effects gameplay for the opposition.
---
2nd question, since this insinuates game balance changes... why not use more niche things for balance, like survivor carry time, pallet stun duration, lunge distance and recovery, hit attack cooldown, pallet break times, and vault speeds... these are ways to balance other than (terror radius, movespeed, and power)... and adds more identity to the killer in question and a personality that applies more strategy and learning curve to the game.
---
Same with survivors, giving survivors induvidual passives like pallet stun durations, passive perks, movespeeds, scrarchmarks, struggle effects, heal speeds, recovery etc etc....
---
All add character identity and more depth and strategy into the gameplay that good players will enjoy and new players will enjoy learning and having a hero that shows their lore as in game with identity passives.
---
I swear, this Reddit is getting out of hand with the mods. 
---
Can't post this as it looks slightly similar to something posted 3 days ago.
---
Can't post that because the image isn't anything to do with DBD. 
---
Can't post that because its not the second Tuesday of the month. 
---
It's why I don't usually bother submitting anything anymore.
---
Theres always one.
---
Is this a Simon and Garfunkel Reference??
---
Not just that, I've also heard from a lot of friends who play League, that EUW is way better and higher ranked than NA.
---
It's not that simple.
---
1. High level play is really subjective, high ranks have tons of shitters who are definitely not very good.
---
2. If you balance for high lvl too much the game becomes incredibly unfun for casual players (especially survivors)
---
3. The game isn't competitive and is balanced to be enjoyable, not to be completely fair.
---
It's like that one tale of a guy being executed via fireline, but the fireline misses EVERY shot, but he still died thanks to a heart attack brought on by fear.
---
So uh... how much money do they want?
---
The game needs changes cause we all want to play the ways we want and against good competition, but this games content is drying out.
---
nah i mean its cute and i appreciate it, but id rather just give him the points and save him the time and stuff since 4 gens
---
I guess I‚Äôll start shaving mine then.
---
You don't need Ruin. No one likes it anyway
---
It says no stupid questions..
---
Yeah well I was thinking with like an attack of scissor and knives like how she killed her mother that float in the same striking distance as a regular attack and they would probably just float around her when she's not using them
---
What time will the new chapter be released?
---
You find a way to connect your steam with xbox and PSN accounts that doesn't cost them a fuckload of cash.
---
If you're talking about full crossplay PC would have too big of an advantage.
---
I hope he gets that in depth of a rework. Maybe making ambush points or something if they go with the gang.
---
Fungoose is the single best dbd player in both surv and killer. Not even an opinion, its a straight up fact
---
but what if we have a drunken one night stand? :( 
---
why cant you base your life choices around the off chance you meet me get magically turned gay and become hopelessly attracted to me? 
---
i mean am i being unreasonable? cause i dont think thats too much to ask! 
---
so put he razor down!
---
That's way I say high lvl and not rank 1.
---
You dont hear console players bitching about nurse do you? Because people at average tiers lack the skill nurse demands...
---
This applies to every killer at low ranks, so when you have everyone potatoing things that are strong to me and other high lvl players arent as strong to these survivors.
---
This game simply can't be successful or balanced if they balanced off low play... cause by doing that they fuck up the very playerbase their trying to balance for...I explained this quite well if you just skimmed over I'd suggest a re-read
---
Tru3 isnt really much better than Monto tho. He just likes to act like he is insanely skilled
---
No I mean like crossplay save it would make them a lot more money and it would be helpful not having to restart I‚Äôd only do crosssplay in kyf anyway
---
I‚Äôm more excited to play against him than as him
---
Oof
---
We have two hillbillies with chainsaws, don‚Äôt shame my clown kink
---
Don't read this sub. Soo many people here are really fucking dumb.
---
Surv: learn to loop and behind yourself in chase, camera-angling is really important.
---
Best teachable perks for survivor are We're Gonna Live Forever, Adrenaline and Balanced Landing, Dead Hard and Decisive Strike are good too.
---
Killer: don't respect pallets, learn how to run basic tiles (Scottjund/DamnNoHtml on YT made a guide for this), don't follow survivors into large buildings or chase them too long.
---
Best teachables for killers are BBQ and Chili, Enduring and Ruin.
---
I mean, what IF the clown had NOED? Even if he didn‚Äôt, they didn‚Äôt know that just how they didn‚Äôt know you had DS and Adren.   I‚Äôm sorry but a smart player knows that if a killer couldn‚Äôt even get a single kill there‚Äôs a HIGH CHANCE with NOED. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but if it‚Äôs end game I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath when it comes to being saved unless I‚Äôm in a swf with at least one person. 
---
I don‚Äôt know your rank or anything but maybe they‚Äôre newer or nervous or for whatever reason... what if they were hoping someone else would have gotten you with BT???   But are you saying you went from first to 3rd stage on first hook? I dunno it sounds sketchy. 
---
So many ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù.... and that STILL doesn‚Äôt mean message the person being rude.  I don‚Äôt think that Claudette was being scummy in messages or toxic tbh. If someone messaged me all Willy nilly because I couldn‚Äôt save them I‚Äôm gonna be a smart Ass back. 
---
Like... I get it. I‚Äôve had some asshat teammates who make bad plays but I think everyone here is more concerned that you cared that much to message them in the first place lmfaoooo
---
Honestly, guarantee tomorrow there will be a thousand YouTube videos about ‚ÄúPENNYWISE CONFIRMED AS NEE KILLER!!!‚Äù.
---
I mean, true has gotten to red ranks with no perks no add ons both killer and survivor, he‚Äôs gotten to red ranks using build requests only from his community. But you‚Äôre right he‚Äôs probably not thaaaaat good. (Some people blow my mind)
---
Tru3 is actually extremely skilled and has a good understanding of the game I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a good streamer to watch. Ardetha is really good too but doesn‚Äôt put out much content anymore. Monto is really good but likes to play the game for gimmicks enjoyment and entertainment so a lot of his content is focused around that. Even so he‚Äôs is also a really skilled player on both survivor and killer
---
I don't have the time to read it and I'm curious on your thoughts summed up
---
It‚Äôs just hair. It‚Äôll grow back.
---
Is there any chance it's a real rumor? Not trying to ask a stupid question just dont usually keep up on the rumors so was wondering if its believable at all? I remember not to long ago people were saying a double bloodpoint event started september 5th, so just curious how reliable the rumors are?
---
And his job isn‚Äôt to unhook you it‚Äôs to survive he didn‚Äôt lash out at you for no reason he did it cause you messaged him first and said why didn‚Äôt you save me in a situation that could‚Äôve killed both of you you shouldn‚Äôt be messaging people cause they didn‚Äôt save you it‚Äôs not part of the game to save somebody every time cause they have perks to save themselves you were being toxic and trying to call this guy a cunt for defending himself
---
I was running ruin, devour hope, deerstalker, and iron grasp. Are these try hard perks???? They had self care, lithe, yellow flashlight with iridescent addon and kept teabagging and spam flashing at pallets? I got at 4K, and I was confused if this was how low ranks were now? I stopped playing after I hit red ranks, and came back for new DLC (:
---
It benefits any killer that isn't already a stealth killer. Going up against a Plague with this would be a nightmare. You'd basically be forced to cleanse because you're running around with no mither against a 115% movement speed killer with no terror radius. Yeah, it takes time to build up, but with one smack you're already recieving the benefits of monitor and abuse. It completely outclasses it, unless you're running the infectious fright build, which is only really beneficial on a killer with other perks to help slug and mobility. 
---
The perk needs some sort of drawback. I think you're underestimating the power of a 115% movement speed killer with a reduced terror radius. Monitor is already good and you only get 8 meters, now with this, you get a better monitor in one chase.
---
ok so ill give my unpopular opinions.
---
1. hex ruin is a perk to stop bad players from doing anything and not stopping the good players that people claim it stops.
---
2. pig is highly underrated in her power and myers is highly overrated in the same vain.
---
3. adrenaline is bad for balance sake sure but its one of those perks that feel good to get procced like you outskilled the killer for the 5 gen chase.
---
4. soloq survivor should be buffed to be closer to the swf experience not swf should be nerf just cause it can be op.
---
Yeah I know it came put way later on ps4 but I'm p sure you can't connect a mouse and keyboard unless it's just some people who aren't able to. But yeah pc players are on a whole different level
---
You're going to get reported for saying shit. If you're gonna try and insult someone. Use tasteful words like useless Fleshlight or codfish. :3
---
I mean, hilbilly to leatherface, legion to ghost face
---
Okay, wasnt expecting anyone to think I was being serious... It's a joke, guys
---
Freddy was never bad, he was just hard to use.
---
Legion has been the worst killer since his release.
---
Neither adrenaline or noed are op, but neither are fun to play against.
---
Now this is actually good content. Laughed my ass off.
---
Make sure you level up whichever characters have the best teachable perks first (you can check in their bios)  
---
A lot of people level up David for his perk that helps with gaining blood points, or Meg (all of her perks are pretty good) 
---
That‚Äôs just a recommendation though, you can decide for yourself. 
---
(Teachable perks are exclusive to a single character until you unlock them via that character‚Äôs bloodweb)
---
Just in case you didn‚Äôt know//-
---
Oh and NEVER drop shack pallet ;)
---
&gt; mean, true has gotten to red ranks with no perks no add ons both killer and survivor, he‚Äôs gotten to red ranks using build requests only from his community. But you‚Äôre right he‚Äôs probably not thaaaaat good. (Some people blow my mind)
---
ye, thats cool, but not something Noob3 hasnt done, dont get me wrong True is good, I just dont think he is as good
---
zubatlel, ohtofu, scottjund(maybe not survivor).
---
Is that actually you? F.
---
We shouldn't have killer or survivor mains. We should all play both to improve, but more importantly to learn how to avoid toxic behavior.
---
I‚Äôm sick of people in this community who are hard focused on one side of the game and refuse to see things from a different perspective. The amount of OP perk ideas and suggestions that get upvoted by greedy assholes honestly astounds me. 
---
Killers don‚Äôt need perks that start the match with all 4 survivors injured/broken, just like survivors don‚Äôt need a perk/item that instantly opens an exit door or completes a gen in two seconds.
---
It's a complicated subject that needs to be explained carefully for people who don't understand how the devs balance code effects all levels of play.
---
Mostly talking about how balancing based off low level players makes the game less fun and dry at high skill play, and thos drives these high skilled players to de-rank to low ranks in order to have better que times, play the killers they want, builds etc etc.
---
And low rank aka pretty bad survivors against ANY highly skilled killer or vice versa ruins the game for those low skilled players who lack the knowledge and experience to understand these things.
---
This causes players to leave, develop false opinions like WRAITH OP or viable or some shit...
---
And skews this bullshit low lvl balance on its ass due to the domino effect it causes
---
they want to have fun in a 4man squad and you want them to be killed. ok cool.
---
I wouldn't let it get to you. To have that kind of load out and then DC because you lost your ruin says they are not very good at killer and even with such a strong loadout they aren't confident they can win without ruin up. Probably just a troll projecting onto you rather than accept its a bit of a dick move.
---
Just speculating but maybe theyve played long enough where BP doesn't matter and they'd rather just get on with their day.
---
I typically stop DC'ing once I get past rank 10
---
Why is this just a better furtive chase? What the fuck? Make the stacks only accumulate on the obsession and you've got a good damn perk.
---
I'd love to stop using Ruin, but I usually gravitate towards low-tier killers. With the exception of Pig, all the killers I actively play need Ruin to have a chance. I hate that I have to, but I have to.
---
True that friend. It's not in the game so we can't prove anything one way or the other. I just think that losing two chases, you get punished for it hard, because now the killer using this perk only has a 8 or 0 meter terror radius for you. I think you may be underestimating the power of that. But who knows? It's not testable like you said. But this is a fun debate to have because your idea for a perk is really unique and I think it could work, and everything is great from the name to the icon. In my personal opinion though, that's a little too much benefit just for smacking them.
---
Poor Amanda :(
---
You're 100% in the right man, but be careful with the messages, people try to egg you on to swear then report you for it and it's an easy ban for Sony even though he messaged you
---
So whenever I have a Shape ritual I play shy michael and this time he met a centipede
---
There is so much to unpack here. I‚Äôll start by saying omega blink nurse, that‚Äôs op. All other arguments that base nurse or spirit need a nerf is just ridiculous. 
---
The point of surviving should be only trying to survive and doing enough to level up. If you put it in your mind that you only win when you get out then you aren‚Äôt going to win much. 
---
Lastly you saying that a survivor should be able to 1v1 the killer in ANY situations proves that you fundamentally don‚Äôt understand the game. The REASON there is 4v1 is because the survivors don‚Äôt stand a chance against the killer. Don‚Äôt you think it would be garbage if ONE survivor could go 1v1 against a killer. NO that‚Äôs not the point. Go play mortal kombat or some other fighting game
---
King Cock?
---
The overlook hotel will be such a neat map and Dick Hallorann as the survivor will be a good chapter
---
play killer with bbq. if you dont have bbq play survivor with david king and hope to get wglf stacks and bp. if not then just play killer
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm super excited for the resident evil game but I don‚Äôt have any hope it‚Äôs going to succeed. DBD seems to be the only game that is able to attract and keep any players.
---
They‚Äôve shown gameplay and it‚Äôs 4VS1, the bad guy can lock doors and turn off lights and control and place zombies and stuff like that. And to TC delight play as Mr.X lol
---
DWEET MOVE BEFORE I STABBY STAB YOU!
---
I agree with what your saying but that‚Äôs where swf comes in you see it may not be necessary on solo que with some people but it‚Äôs pretty much needed with swf with yellow toolboxes some games can end in 3 minutes that‚Äôs unacceptable games should be 6+ min it can be used to create pressure I agree but that‚Äôs not it‚Äôs only purpose its main purpose is to slow the game down to a extent but you can still work through it at a fast rate with swf and it‚Äôs still a totem with unlucky spots too even otz has had gens done super quickly with killers and he runs ruin too because Yet again it‚Äôs super hard without basically becomes a must need the guy who plays pig may not run ruin but a good swf will get gens done quickly cause the killer can only focus on one person unless your legion that‚Äôs what I think.
---
Ik but I'm not increasing my skills, nor am I having fun, thus their is literally no point in playing, and yes I do alot of meme builds but I can't pip enough with them to rank up fast enough considering I see killer above rank 8 as a bigger chore than rank 1 survivor against 5 mori red add on spirits in a row. (true story)
---
Should I just copy/paste my other comments or just reword them? I don‚Äôt know, you didn‚Äôt read them the first time, so...
---
What part of ‚ÄúNurse is the only Killer who can find hatch and camp both exits for a guaranteed win every game‚Äù is not being understood? The entire point of End Game was to force the game to end while still giving the last survivor a small chance to get out. Nurse‚Äôs powers, by design, take away that chance. How is that fun for anyone but Nurse? 
---
I understand that once hatch is closed it‚Äôs exponentially harder to escape, but every other Killer leaves a sliver of hope at possibly beating the odds. Except Nurse.
---
I‚Äôm not a sweat lord and I‚Äôve never played Nurse? Lol
---
&gt; Huntress, billy, nurse, hag all high skill ceiling heros but not a single one is complained about by low tier players.
---
Yes they do lol. 
---
&gt; And rank rewards isnt going to discourage deranking... neither is a DC punish, they'll just intentionally lose or camp.to de rank...
---
I think you're confusing "discouraging" with "eliminating". Some people will absolutely go for high rank rewards while others won't care, but it should help at least a little. 
---
Right now if you DC 5 times in a row you'll lose 10 pips a short amount of time and won't be banned for the DCing. Once the intentional DC's start putting you on a cool down do you really think people will just stand at a wall for 10 games to lose those same 10 pips? Sure, some will, but with the extra effort it will take it will for sure discourage it.
---
&gt; It's just dog shit, and I dont think you've been around long enough to see this playerbase on release, steam isnt what u wanna look st boi... you wanna look at active players, cause steam shows purchases... not players... so its counting people from beta who have died by now.
---
I've been around since the early access release and I don't believe i'm looking at purchases unless steam charts is lying to me. It says itself "An ongoing analysis of Steam's concurrent players." meaning active players who are launching the game, not people who are purchasing it.
---
There is no such thing as an unfair playstyle for either side, as long as no one is exploiting or glitching at least.
---
The issue with PGTW is that it is good when you are winning, and sucks when you are losing.
---
Chill out mate, the stacks are on the each survivor's ability to hear the TR not on the killer's TR for everyone. Each person has their own stack counter. read the thread, I've answered this a few times.
---
ye
---
Yeah... this isn't R6. We tried the eSports thing once, didn't go so well.
---
If you take this game seriously, good for you, but for me this is a casual game to have fun, rather than a competitive game to always win. In my opinion, this game should be skewed heavily in favour of the killers, since that would make them scary to play against (which they should be - they're horror movie villains, after all), but of course that would mean fewer survivor players. End of the day, the game's balance is fine enough where it is
---
They do completely different things.
---
I‚Äôd say nurse gives you the same amount of hope, I read all of the comments but you‚Äôre making a mountain out of a mole hill while asking for the nerf of the best killer in the game. On the ground of the mole hill. Which is she has a better chance than most killer at finding hatch and stopping exit gate escape. Which by the way takes some amount of work on the killers part and isn‚Äôt just free. It‚Äôs just ridiculous that you‚Äôd complain about such a small occurrence. When you manage to survive the nurse (because she didn‚Äôt slug, but why be grateful for that) she doesn‚Äôt give you a free escape and uses her abilities to catch you so we should nerf her? That doesn‚Äôt make sense man we just have to take the death. Back to the first thing I said though IF you did enough work, gens, unhooks etc you can die AND still pip? Why do you NEED her nerfed to be able to maybe escape?
---
Selling that new skin you unboxed to get DLC for your favorite game üòé
---
Actually I wouldn't, because I play to have fun. Killers have complained about _unfun_ perks to get nerfed, not useful ones. Old DS was all reward no risk. You were punished as a Killer by just picking someone up. That's broken and unfun. Old MOM, huge reward small risk. You got a free hit, for doing nothing other than playing the game like normal. The aura reading could be worked around and wasn't enough of a downside to warrant how insanely strong it was.
---
You know what you don't see complaints about? Self-Care. Any of the Exhaustion perks. Borrowed Time. Iron Will. Urban Evasion. All top tier perks, yet there is no consistent outcry about their strength. You get a few complaints here and there, for sure, from people who lost to it and are salty. But there isn't a steady stream of complaints. Know why? Because they aren't one sided. 
---
You can say we Killer mains aren't happy until survivors spawn on hooks, yet survivor mains cant seem to grasp the basic concept that: You can't always win.
---
Adept Spirit thanks for this comment, puts my mind at ease.
---
yes swf can do the gens more effiecently but most of the time the swf groups play in a more altruistic manner and knowing how to abuse their mentality towards their friends is part of what creating pressure is. most swf squads are just friends wanting to play together and if they works gens more efficently then the normal players then let them do so, but complaining that the few cases of swf will outway the many cases of soloq is part of why i think ruin needs a change.
---
Active players are monitored via if the game is downloaded, launches means nothing.

Also not to be rude but you can scroll down a little bit and find the answer or search using the search bar. Ive answered this like 3 times in this thread alone

Myers.. Cough.. GF.. Cough

Ghostface would probably be the hardest because he‚Äôs smart and stealthy and bubba would suck cause he has a chainsaw and is 6ft 2 I‚Äôd rather go against legion lol just take their knife

üòÇüòÇüíô
---
No. You‚Äôre a good one. I‚Äôm a survivor main and do the same thing when I play killer
---
I'm set, money wise...I think....
---
&gt; And yea the playerbase jumps a bit cause stranger things fans are coming in... to again fall victim to the same cycle I stated in the post if you cared to read it before coming in here and making opinions.
---
If you cared to read MY post I actually pointed out that the current average player count is around the same number its been for months. 
---
August - 19,253.3
---
July - 19,102.6	
---
June - 21,505.7

April - 20,564.7

May - 16,960.0

March - 16,380.8

So actually the end of summer has been decently stronger compared to early spring.

What are you even talking about, how are you arguing with raw facts? Your anecdotal ‚Äúit takes longer for me to queue, game dying!!!!‚Äù means absolutely nothing to the fact this game is only getting a bigger audience, thanks to the licensed chapters. You cannot rebuke the fact this game is getting more successful by aiming at the casual fan base, and rightfully so. This game is awful competitively, none of your ideas would do any good to the game.
---
nah it'd be way too weak as a hex. I explained why in further down the thread to others who had that concern.
---
They'll probably call you an asshole for it, but technically he was an asshole for trolling his teammates. In this case I'd reckon your actions were justified. I personally don't condone camping, but it's not bannable or anything so do what you want!
---
I can't tell if this is sarcastic or not to be honest
---
No. I‚Äôm a survivor main and I can tell you that we really appreciate the killers who punish bad teammates.
---
If you want balance skewed toward killers which it should be maybe not extremely but definitely some...
---
Then your sitting in the meta where killers are at their weakest... even Scott's nurse one of the best known players loses to good survivors just holding m1 on a gen whenever there's opportunity.
---
They balance the game assuming theres alot of time of survivors crouching around doing nothing. Which good players dont do.
---
Vlad wasn't a bad guy, and he didn't drink blood, he just needed to defend his country, at all costs, from the Turks, and this is only further perpetuating the idea he was a monster. I get it's in fun, but just make them outright a vampire.
---
Are you implying that the killer didn‚Äôt play fairly because he tunneled the Adam? The killer can do what ever they feel is best in order to win the game. The team was being very altruistic and not doing objectives as well as the Adam sabotaging hook in order to let his team struggle and get away. At that point the killer has no other option but to drop the survivor and to go after the Adam as he is making it impossible to get any kills until he is out of the game. The tunnel there was not only justified but mandatory, brought on by the Adam himself. Just because survivors think it‚Äôs illegal to tunnel doesn‚Äôt mean it is. Unhooking a survivor while the killer is close is just asking for them to be farmed. It was bad team play by the survivors. They should have had at least one person on gen duty and that game would have flown by.
---
Months yes 1 year? No... 2 years? wWAYYYY NO.
---
I don‚Äôt think ruin needs a change cause you can still work a giants or just fine with great skill checks and a map pretty much counters it also but in high ranks like red rank people can a lot of the time run to each pallet without stunning killer just throwing it and like 2 gens can be done the process is quick and really hard on some killers which prevents people from playing killers they life cause they aren‚Äôt otz or Tru3Talent.
---
Broken link.
---
Adrenaline rewards you for completing your objective whereas NOED acts as a get out of jail free card. Not saying adrenaline isn't irritating but the two perks are incomparable.
---
Yeah I got you.
---
Damn don't need to crush their dreams like that man
---
So hyped for that game though, and best thing yet no risk of lawsuits
---
I fel yah
---
I play ps4 if that's relevant. It normally takes me a while for solo survivor matches and swf is a little quicker. As killer it is within a minute. That's where I'm coming from. Umm. And my rank ranges from 5-3 as survivor and 7-5 as killer. But I haven't been playing as much as I used too. When I was rank one, it was about the same experience, probably a month ago. Oh! Except swf's were longer.
---
By playing the game right. I mean the objective of both sides. The goal are killer is too--well kill. I don't care if you rock noed or ruin, just try to kill me. You know? I hope that sheds some light onto what I meant by my post and thank you for your input.
---
Of course i would. Im not heartless. Im quite altruistic. However if im at an open gate and im dead on hook and they are on the opposite side of the map... they can get fucked
---
The fact your a spirit main gives more weight to what you say here as its a spirit gameplay, i was definitely curious if i was doing the killer justice haha. That's a solid idea, i will try to promote that playstyle in my next gameplay! Seems healthy for the game imo.

r/dbdgonewild

Are you thinking of corrupt intervention?
---
Your efficiency is absolutely sexy. I'd say this was played completely fair and gorgeously tbh. The commentary on top was the icing on the cake.
---
Only outside of a chase. Inside a chase it increases by 8m
---
You will get one after you acquire your blood points after a daily. Ex: 3 completed dailies, its been 24 hours, you deem daily, new one appears
---
There‚Äôs only three people I camp in this game, people who body block, teabag or just generally take the piss, people who fuck over teammates and Laurie strodes
---
Lol why that last one
---
Omg much love! Ty!
---
Ridin round the block, with a glock, yo ass finna get shot.

---
it was fun discussing with you. have a good day
---
Just bring 69 blink nurse with ebony
---
I want Jack mostly cause it would mean Shelley Duvall as survivor and that would be amazing
---
If I remember right, the cool down now is about 2 seconds and they‚Äôre making it 2.25 or something like that
---
Thanks!!
---
They should make it to where your shit team mates can‚Äôt crouch walk around the map or let you die on 1st hook for 72 hours and you get 100k bloodpoints.
---
No need, its the internet lmao
---
I'm someone who plays a lot of "nice killer".. so I let a lot of people go. When I see people going out of their way to screw over their teammates... I kill them with pride. I don't like people messing with my cute survivors. That's a no no.
---
Are you talking about on the DBD developer streams on Twitch? I know they've shared a lot of statistics, but I can't recall one showing active players. Would you be able to directly link to it? Or do we all just need to take your word that the game has lost 90% of its player base?

Eh most people think the fact that I play Spirit means that I have to rely on a high tier killer to do good yet my other mains are doc and Freddy. Though I suppose it's mostly survivors who think that way.

Good meme

Wait my post is deleted? Wtf

You go on someone‚Äôs stream and see if they do it then you enter the code they give or something. It‚Äôs honestly pretty worthless

I have been recording a clip a day with the mission each day, looking forward to a nurse mission as i hit red ranks a while back when i was playing more often. Just come back from a very long break and figured content creation would help keep things fresh, so far im really enjoying it but i feel i need to work on making the commentary more interesting haha. I love FunGoose's style if you know him? He talks about stats and the like mid gameplay and educates people, by far my favourite killer at the moment.
---
prayer beads needs to be deleted (:
---
Freddy was mid-tier before the rework, and I'm still annoyed that I'll never be able to play him again :(
---
Overpriced microtransactions in a non free-to-play game with this many dlcs are unacceptable, even if it's "just cosmetics" 
---
Nurse is balanced :o
---
Neas Face looks fine 
---
I hate the Battlepass
---
The game is the mostly balanced nowadays
---
Hillbillys raccoon hat is awesome
---
Gideon's meat-plant is the most balanced and enjoyable map in the game
---
Ruin is overrated
---
I love the grind, I do make over 100,000 bloodpoints in a day lol. It was just an estimate because the devs already make bloodpoints a pretty expensive currency so I was thinking from their perspective. Also, would 100,000 bloodpoints be me appreciating the grind? If I asked for a million, it would seem like I'm lazy no?
---
Sounds familiar to Otzdarva, he talks about why he is doing every single move he does and talks about his mind games aloud while he does it, guy is a god their trapper.
---
If you mean when it cancels the game because someone disconnects during loading you shouldn't lose the offering unless your the one who disconnects.
---
i remember running unbreakebill and no mither just to not have to BLOODY MEND
---
but it's fixed
---
Went into a game where it was a 4 man team with 2 of them streaming. Decided to check out their stream and have it play the audio in the background out of curiousity. 
---
And my gosh I have never been bmed so badly in my life. Like... I was pretty new and they were purple ranks at the time. Felt pretty bad to have my derp plays streamed in public while 3 of them were constantly shitting on me for being bad. 
---
I closed the stream like 5 minutes into the game and the only one I could kill was their rank 20 friend.
---
Ironically in post game lobby they were telling me to check out their stream not knowing I heard how badly I was getting shit on just before.
---
Once an offering is burned it's gone.. shitty at times I know but it happens. However..  I will say at times I've not lost my offering when this has happened.. rare.. but it's a thing.
---
I don't know if you've already seen [this](https://youtu.be/EfnmZvK4l88), but I found this video pretty helpful when learning to play as nurse.
---
Except it's more like "If I get downed this person is going to either camp the fuck out of me or tunnel me like John Henry to kill me instantly" which is just not fun.
---
Do we know the Australian pricing?
---
I dont agree with it being op on Legion since Mend is not a heal action and isnt counted as injured or dying. Plague...idk well enough to know what you mean I suppose
---
I have only watched the video by interact of entity education
---
I would love to practice trapper, i enjoyed watching monto's power only series trapper episode haha. Part of the reason i came back and im loving the game since!
---
I need to watch more Otz tbf, seems like a really good killer and i should be able to learn a lot of cool things!
---
OMG new killer gonna be his buddy Jeffrey Epstein?!
---
Instaheals should be fuckin removed imo. But I'll always just be bad for thinking that so whatever.

So Alone achievement, is that the gen by the closed portal on top of the glass room?

Pity

On ps4 there is an exploit that prevent you from losing your item when you dc

Agitation is from Trapper, you can level him up and unlock it with bloodpoints. Save your shards this time.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt know I get like 90k from 3 dailies so seemed a bit much to me from what they give us
---
What was funny? Dc? Yeah so funny damn i cried my ass of laughter
---
There is also a thing that survivors are just skins, so you only really need to dump BP into one (after unlocking teachables on others), i.e. if I buy new survivor perk from shrine, I only need 3 bloodwebs to have it on my Laurie, but if I buy a killer perk, I will need to multiply this by number of killers I want this perk on, and if it's useless on some killer's (like Nurse's on Plague), then it will just trash their bloodwebs.
---
No, honestly hooks are close enough as is... definitely better perks out there. Unless you want to do basement builds often.
---
This actually gives me anxiety
---
You‚Äôre such a child and getting so worked up to EVERYONE. HOLY SHIT
---
Here's just one fucking article that states that a goal of the survivors is to unhook each other.
---
https://www.usgamer.net/articles/08-08-2018-dead-by-daylight-survivor-guide-survivor-tips-hatch-how-to-survive-survivors-list
---
Which page is this in the survivor rule book for killers ?
---
I was at 800 000 but then I tiered up my Huntress and got a bit carried away on her web. Still have 500k left though
---
Why do you get robbed of potential struggle points when you're the last one to get hooked? As the last person you get a maximum of like 40 or so struggle points when everyone else, if they don't get saved, gets like 7-800. Feels a bit like robbery to me. You should at least get the points you would have gotten if the game didn't just kill you outright.
---
Found the NoED user
---
This isn‚Äôt posted by official Bhvr it‚Äôs just a gaming site with tips
---
to be honest I couldn't give a flying fuck if that bitches name was there
---
Nah nah, I'm excited. Furtive chase is literal garbage but this is a perk I'd use in my main kit whereas Furtive chase belongs in the garbage. It's too bad BHVR rarely picks up fan content, this is some seriously good stuff.
---
So to me it‚Äôs gonna be a back burner achievement. It could be worse just wish bill was available years ago when I played consistently cause it‚Äôd have been done by then.
---
does it have to be bhvr? Coz they haven't made a full on tutorial?
---
I only played 3 Freddy games so far, but I did similar gen teleport maneuver while chasing and it felt so satisfying.
---
My bad, I had it all wrong
---
The Dweet is now a Dwight!
---
You'd be surprised how many high rank doctors, infinite swinging noed leatherfaces, and all-game invisible wraiths Ive gotten lmao
---
...buff the killers that are shit then. either way, spirit and nurse are two killers that are always going to be OP because of their kits.
---
True. Though maybe with even just a few more seconds she could have been in the gate area and off to the side while Michael would try to find her outside. I don‚Äôt know. Just throwing out another scenario that maybe the Quentin wasn‚Äôt spinning around just to be toxic.
---
Are you on PC?
---
my man I don't give a shit what the killer gets. The Claudette could've easily helped, but they were toxic as fucking cock and decided to sit there and watch me fucking die on hook you dumbass Pasquale
---
Nope. It's the generator inside the tiny room on the top floor.
---
# REVENGE!
---
1088 &gt;:)
---
It has to be bhvr they made the game
---
I don't see it on PS4 yet
---
Someone downvoted you when I thought that was hilarious
---
I have those games with pop where you hook and once I end animation, gen pops. There is no fucking gen on map you can use it because they dedicated to one. Feels so bad and out of sync xD
---
Cool perk and name, but I would have it work like thanatophobia.
---
No sorry ps4 I just edited it to say that
---
Me the last three mat hes I played yesterday.
---
Thank you.
---
find me a bhvr article with a full tutorial of the game. Or you can find me a shit ton of other articles that clearly state that saving survivors off a hook is a key part of the game
---
Yeah your insecurities and bitterness is way more embarrassing at this point.
---
Is it coming on console the same time as pc?
---
Why do I have to find it I don‚Äôt need to prove my point you do
---
Didn't the devs say they won't make a disguising killer tho
---
0_0
---
Oh ok, on your ps4 check the version history for DBD.  What was the last version you have downloaded
---
With this attitude. I‚Äôm glad they did. You‚Äôre literally SO MAD over a game, kid. I would take a break if it tilts you this much.
---
1,000,000 with 60k in reserveü§≠
---
Ad u failed, i don‚Äôt use noed, this perk is weak, learn to play and you will stop complaining about it, but you‚Äôre an entitled survivor, and u will say ¬´¬†BuT I PlAy MoRe KiLlEr ThAn SuRvIvOr¬†¬ª which is obviously a lie
---
And also punishment mode has a smaller radius than treatment mode
---
Agitation is more of a low to mid tier perk, it‚Äôs not really necessary due to hooks being relatively close. 
---
I recommend saving shards for something else and only using agitation when you‚Äôre trying to run certain builds.
---
Literally stop thinking and typing. This post is joking about how if they add IT Clown is going to get the ugly step child treatment because he is the less popular, surprise, clown.
---
Honestly they should just add a new scoring event for being the last sacrifice.

Should replace Hannah with the white haired goth artist with the hardcore doctor fetish.
---
I really like Legion and I know he‚Äôs a weaker killer, how do I make him fun to play, though? Are there any legion mains still playing? I‚Äôve tried youtube, but there weren‚Äôt many recent videos.
---
I have been saying that Freddy thing forever.
---
But for legion, do you not remember the 5 minute mending time?
---
OMG
---
Ayyy thanks man
---
Nurse and Spirit are the only killers who will consistently have a chance against a 4 Man SWF who are actually red rank players so balancing them for the majority is tough. It would become a bully simulator without Nurse or Spirit.
---
The nerfs that Nurse should be getting are her OP Blink Range Addons (That are 3 addons in 1) and nothing more.
---
The nerfs Spirit needs are No Collision while phasing, Prayer Beads and Father's Glasses being removed.
---
Looks good I just think the chin it too sharp
---
It‚Äôs 50/50, really dependent on nurse skill. Hawkins is gonna be a bad map for everyone besides the trap killers lol
---
The Entity would like to know your location
---
kewl.
---
Why, you can only use them for 15 seconds on a key
---
when u slug to avoid ds but you try to play it off like youre being a nice guy
---
Which was a bug and not intentional. Please learn the difference between what the killer can and should do compared to what he could do by accident via a bug that could be avoided, which caused people to get banned for using it so people were dissuaded from using it.
---
It‚Äôs better to delay it and get a better outcome then to have a messy release and cause more issues.
---
We know why and it's trashy and doesn't make any sense to the lore. They have enough players and changing the game till the story doesn't make sense so you can attract people that aren't even interested in the core of the game is silly they're only playing because of one character and will only stick around for that then go to the next game.
---
I used to be an end game Freddy pre-rewoked Freddy. Welcome to my nightmare.
---
It does, but you're interpreting it the wrong way.  Maybe a better way to phrase it would be, "no question too stupid" for those who don't read the actual post, which would tell you that you can ask any question as long as it relates to Dead by Daylight.
---
I saw a toxic bill teabag me at the exit gates, the. This happened, when the timer was almost over he tried to find the hatch, i wasn‚Äôt going to help him at all
---
Heard this song already
---
Nothings coming out of complaining about it
---
Not complaining just stating the obvious
---
That's nothing. Noed isnt the best perk to use. It's countered really easy, doesn't have any effect in late game, and takes a slot that could of held a chase ending perk or something that could of made early game go slower. I'm a survivor main and 9/10 killers I play never have their NoEd go off.
---
Why would the entity be running from Michael?
---
The obvious that you would rather have the devs ship out a flawed product?
---
As a killer, i can‚Äôt wait to play demogorgon, and if more people are excited to play steve and nancy than killer, that means more survivors, and quicker matchmaking
---
Noed is fine. I'm A survivor main just do bones or get good
---
Take my upvote sir
---
For nice nice mid-tier killer an ¬ß»õƒìvƒì.
---
They changed that from getting a 4k a while back for all killers.
---
Its been almost two years since dedicated servers should have been released at this point it's just a pipe dream used to keep players around.
---
Go for it!
---
Probably trapper and the corn map with the house. Hes tall and there are plenty of places to hide. He's the least scary if you think of it as you're first person, feeling everything survivors feel.
---
Personal fear of clowns, so that's out.
---
Nurse/spirit/hag would be fucking terrifying since they can just pop out of nowhere.
---
Wraith is kind of eh for me, but I'd rather look out for bear traps rather than the heart stopping clang of a bell and an invisible boi popping out.
---
Leatherface/Billy yeet dude. Chainsaws would finish you. Realistically we wouldn't be taking two hits so you need a killer that can't take you down instantly.
---
Huntress would be I guess a solid 2nd place to trapper. As long as you can duck and stay out of sight you're fine, but if you get stuck in an open field you're boned. Assuming that the killers aren't actually people and are just the best versions of themselves like in the lore.
---
Freddy is eh. Could go either way.
---
Doctor, deffo not. I'm not sure a body can take an electrical shock like his, and he's scary looking on top of that.
---
Plague is gross. I'd be throwing up too much to move.
---
Legion, seriously just a sprinty boy with a knife. Whack him in the head seriously. 
---
I don't know a lot about the demogorgon so can't say too much on him.
---
I don't think I'm forgetting anyone but if I am oh well.
---
Corn map, the corn would be way thicker that it is in game. Seriously corn fields are scary lol.
---
Good shit; Nurse is fucking hard!
---
Lol why was he running 2 insta heals on the same med kit
---
Did you hook her too?
---
Yeah he's very easy to play against and most of the time 3 or 4 people get out, he just really likes to stab :)
---
That and the buffs to noed and ruin.
---
This could be a Hex perk
---
Sure thing bud. You seem to know everything there is to dbd.
---
This is a terrible drawing
---
This man is singlehandedly making dbd less toxic
---
Hello! Thanks for doing this giveaway. I really want it, because I love Stranger Things TV Show and I'm addicted to Dead by Daylight game. I've never wanted any game DLC as much as I want this one but I'm saving all my money for art supplies so I can't spend them on my gaming hobby D: That is the reason why I'm entering the giveaway.
---
I'm working on a series of Dead by Daylight fan arts at this moment that I will share on this subreddit. Here is colored pencils Demogorgon sketch [https://imgur.com/Bd35awH](https://imgur.com/Bd35awH) that I was rushing to draw for this event (I need to fix him), the end result will be much nicer looking. Usually I draw much cleaner, for example [https://imgur.com/xz9MzR0](https://imgur.com/xz9MzR0) . I hope you like them :D
---
I feel like no one would play him because a boring ability. No one wants to be able to stand still and see nothing.
---
Why would you play any survivor except scoops ahoy steve
---
I'm more puzzled why people complain about DS tbh
---
No I just do research, you too can check player counts.
---
üòí
---
The real question is do you pronounce it Mye-thur or Mih-thur?
---
Legion is just a bunch of edgy kids. What's your point?
---
Covering bases.  It's basically used as training wheels for killers with zero confidence in their ability.  And you mentioning gens popping so fast is ironic since NOED gamers tend to do this to themselves by not playing to pressure gens.  They often overcommit to chases and give up the gens knowing they got their safety blanket to rely on when the last gen pops.  It rewards failure.  Very bad lazy design.  It's basically for new players that want to ease into playing killer without the stress of having to apply optimal decision making midchase.  
---
I cleanse totems man you aren't telling me anything new.  But randoms don't and I can't reasonably be expected to take out all 5 myself each game that isn't a system.   I just cleansed 4 myself 2 games ago and dude still had babycrutch light up at the end lol.
---
I always found disconnecting dumb cause your losing 2 pips guaranteed and getting no bloodpoints
---
I play a lot of legion at red ranks and it's not that bad. To make it more fun, be sure to use Save The Best For Last, it is bonkers on legion due to their ability.
---
Keys can spawn in chests.
---
Yeah keys do spawn in chests
---
Keys indeed spawn in chests
---
They're fairly rare tho
---
The very least it needs its rarity swapped with fathers glasses
---
That fucking tbag at the end got me
---
*‚Äùdarn, i messed up one chase because I went the wrong way in a panic. better leave the game and waste my points/flashlight/teammates time and just count myself as a Kill instead.‚Äù*
---
-Big Brain Survivor
---
Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle yeah
---
Shit, I guess they got lucky and found one. I‚Äôve only ever gotten medkits and toolboxes as survivor. They must‚Äôve been swf cause they all escaped at exactly the same time and I know the hatch closes after 30 secs of being open
---
oof that Nancy at the front is how I was planning on running her cosmetic wise
---
I'd rather not have another clown. Plus, he'll make me think of that tweenage gang-bang in the sewers. 
---
Jack seems kinda bland, tbh. 
---
[Who I'm hoping for](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-EgsRiq-IHVM%2FWBRDk5rXMgI%2FAAAAAAAAUG8%2FPH0L6Hm6oM8lhTGFQ-aEexXw7vTuaTIggCLcB%2Fs1600%2Fchristine.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1)
---
You play in swf then.  Soloqueue their crutches activate consistently.  Randoms don't cleanse totems.  I'm hoping the bloodpoint and emblem change and Inner Strength encourage these idiots to help a brother out.  I have to do so many totems alone my hands got blisters.  Please help me Randoms!
---
Am I the only one who wants the grudge ?
---
Listen man I don‚Äôt run bird but I would rather surgically remove my soul than play a single game without ruin. GENS ARE TOO DAMN SPEEDI.
---
Rather use pop than ruin
---
I agree. Pennywise is more on par with the Entity itself if not more powerful. It wouldn't fit with the rest of them. It's not because he's a clown but because he's just too powerful. Jack would fit in better.
---
Wow you're so ignorant and still talking shit
---
This build was nasty, especially with old pig or with old Freddy's class photo and pill bottle
---
Ok but like every token based perks there should be a way to lose tokens. Imagine being hit 4 times and you can't hear the TR anymore.
---
A face camping Bubba that fails to kill the guy on hook? Damn that's rough
---
Why Laurie?
---
C...c..can you go out with me, H-H-Herman-kun?
---
I mean we are getting a new killer, 2 new survivors and a totally new map. So kinda like $3 for each thing. There is also 9 new perks. It's quite a lot I was expecting it to be closer to $20 so I am happy with this price.
---
Idiot
---
Who makes cosmetics, who debugs and who design the maps etc are different teams you monkey.
---
Before talking at least use your lonely neuron that's left. Cosmetics doesn't take time from programming, how the fk do you even think those two are correlated? God damn.. entitled survivors who DC whenever they like are really stupid

Doctor has that for madness, huntress has a minute long exhaustion after hatchets, clown only needs to gas you for exhaustion. Why would this be any worse? Cleanse and it's gone. Relying too much on an exhaustion perk is a bad habit anyway. Get good with loops.
---
Im so proud of this community
---
did he start maining clown
---
More like crows on the swamp boat
---
With plunders, they‚Äôre quite easy to get.
---
Hahahha im reposting whore I‚Äôm sorry
---
Maybe it was the mark of a Claudette who got what was coming.
---
Only with calm addons.

It was on a different sub tbf

I agree especially with the part of balancing killers around red ranks. When I play survivor with friends, since we aren't very good at looping (I'm a killer main and they don't really invest the time they need to be good at the game) killers like wraith can look very good or killers who surpress their terror radius.
---
 This causes a problem because devs feel the need to nerf those killers to be fair to beginners, which of course destroys their potential in red ranks unless you spent a stupid amount of time learning the best ways to play with X killer. 
---
But well dbd is a hard game to balance since even at red ranks you can get 1 game against 4 solo queues who are braindead and 4k easily but then next game with the exaclty same killer and build, you can get destroyed be a very coordinated 4man swf using the best addons. 
---
But devs seriously need to stop balancing things to help grey ranks, because I think is better to support players who play this game a lot and for a long time and not one that bought the game while in sale and could just abandon it 2 weeks after to play the new trend.
---
And that‚Äôs just incase. Cause my strat is:
---
Try to kill off the obsession with tombstone
---
Around 11 am est. I believe.
---
Prepare for Cujo, he won't be afraid of any pallets.
---
Cringe as hell.
---
It's friday the 13 my dude
---
This debuff should be cleansed when they heal again and it‚Äôll be a balanced perk.
---
No no no you express your feelings of appreciation like this 
---
YOU ARE LOVED AND APPRECIATED, YOU HELPFUL  COOL PERSON
---
I recommend adding thanatophobia with that. Makes healing difficult. I‚Äôm not a legion main but I really do enjoy playing her. STBFL is my next goal because it‚Äôs actually insane for legion
---
Nope, but I've been a Jake main since release so I'm basically Clown Prime.
---
r/imsorryjon has tried to ruin Garfield for me, but when I‚Äôm reminded of this fat CGI cat all hope is restored.
---
okay
---
Someone said to me around 8 am
---
Don't be fooled, there was no talk other than "Scoops ahoy steve hype" before the PTB, but when it happened there was nothing but nancies.
---
Good ol 30 into 60 seconds of exit denial.
---
Completely agree, just go for the unhooker, I rarely, rarely notice DS because I usually dont go for the person who's just been saved, when I know a survivor has DS and I catch them running out first in basement or something sometimes i even bait it out of them just so I dont have to deal with it in end game where they can escape easy. 
---
There are so many other survivor perks to complain about, Desisive is a perk that punishes behaiviour that they dont want to encourage, which in this case is playing disrespectfully and downing a survivor who had no choice over whether they wanted to be farmed.
---
The only other TR build I know of is skill check doctor. In case you don‚Äôt know what that is; it‚Äôs UP, distressing, overcharge, huntress lullaby, ruin. All makes for a good set up.
---
Beautiful
---
BloodlustGamer uh
---
This is perfect example of edgy nickname i'd like to mori
---
Honestly survivor adepts should be harder. Like, instead of saying you escaped/were sacrificed/are dead they should be entity displeased for de-piping,  barley escaped/almost escaped for safety piping, escaped/sacrificed/dead for piping and perfect escape/died a hero for double piping
---
Is the update midnight or que?
---
Thats 5k bloodpoints by just doing totems, i like that
---
Tired of hearing this. If we‚Äôre going to try to be logical, none of this shit makes sense.
---
Using ruin during rank reset oof
---
I mean no one plays clown anyway, might as well add pennywise.
---
I wish I had that amount of skill

Dwight: May I order

***The 12 dollar thing***
---
First of stranger things dlc, cote was follow Natalya dyer and Steve harrington
---
And I am one of that most
---
I still lost it and I didn't dc
---
I imagine the ability would be hard to use, though. You can't see the terrains, so for chasing it would be hard if you don't know the obstacles.
---
I actually discovered him because he was the first human to do a no hit run on dark souls 2. What do I win?
---
I‚Äôm hyped for the Demogorgon
---
Think he meant actual time, not just the date
---
I‚Äôm excited for the demogorgon, he looks cool to both play as and against
---
Oh i know but I'm talking all of the stuff I checked Twitter YouTube etc it was just scoops ahoy Boy and Nancy hype zero demogorgon hype. That's just been my experience
---
Nurse player : blinks through a wall 
---
Console frames : i am bout to end this man whole career
---
What about survivors that loop the killer for the rest of the team then?
---
Oh yeah, its big brain time.
---
Probably because the scoops ahoy outfit wasn't in the PTB and Nancy just has the better meaning once people unlock them they'll go straight to Steve
---
They already have in Scandinavia, Germany and Philippines. I am pretty much enjoying the game but there are still a lot rooms for improvement. Though I don't play on other platforms, I must say I am impressed.
---
I want an og chapter god damnit
---
OMG REALLY!!??!
---
Yup
---
Not you
---
It depends, the person might be a new player and they kinda don't know what they are doing and camping them for trying to learn the game sucks.
---
Definitely but just from my observations the survivors seem way more hyped up then the giant walking testicle
---
Getting it off of pure unhooks though would mean it's useless against facecamping killers.
---
I got my ass handed go me twice yesterday by clowns back-to-back.
---
That's good to know because I've been trying to do that but I just got slammed by the killer.
---
I think you mean if Ash used even a fraction of his shotgun
---
Cough*doctor*cough
---
Especially FunGoose who reccomends it in a lot of his builds. and uses it very often.
---
All good, it's still not available on my phone in australia yet
---
I think it should be doing five or 3 daily
---
Devs never say what time. They just drop it whenever they're ready.
---
You don't stand still, though. You can move around like a blind man, though with the use of bleeding and Bloodstains you can set up an area before hand.
---
His ability is a zoning+chasing ability, which can be fun to use. Immunity to detection also allows you to do some jumpscare, as long as you can do it well. You can also use the bloodstains to give you the rough idea of how terrains work, so you can still sneak up Survivors who dare entering your zone.
---
I haven't given any info about how Bloodstains work though (duration, consumption, etc.). It will be visible for Survivors, for sure, but hard to distinguish. There will be more addons to make Bloodstains last longer, you can replenish Bloodstains faster, or make it less visible to Survivors, or more visible to you. It can pair well with Perks like Sloppy Butcher, which is great.
---
Already with the clickbait.
---
That's how Predator: Hunting Grounds is doing it.
---
In a bit less than 6hours from now.
---
Haha same man but you know what, we do it again every time, because eventually that favor is returned and even if it's not it's all worth it in the end
---
Congrats!
---
Deliverance has a requirement plus it stops you from getting healed for a minute. A requirement and a drawback. NOED gives you 4% speed boost and instadown with no killer input and 0 drawbacks other than using a perk slot.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Dam nice! Cant imagine how hard that is been on dbd for a year and like 60% through!
---
Alternative Use would be awesome!! Great job on all of this, it looks amazing!
---
What ended up being your last trophy? Mine was the nurse stuff lol.
---
I mean, you can even just slug them for a minute if you want to
---
Seconding this question, I literally had about an hour to play today before I have to wait until Saturday for a decent session and that's gone. I was hoping it would be out at midnight so I could play it on my day off.
---
Goodbye money in wallet
---
I started playing last August, I really decided to crack down this week and do all the killer achievements since I usually only play survivor and was very surprised with how well I did. You definitely get it soon! :)
---
Hot
---
Consider your fellow users - do you not feel the thread would be easier to read without all of the duplicate posts?
---
Well dead by daylight is also following Terry Crews so honestly I‚Äôm too excited about him getting in to worry about anything else.
---
I like Whispers on T1. It tells me there are Survivors on the map.
---
How long did it take for you to come up with this insult, did you use all your brainpower, all 4 of your IQ points, did you type your wonderfully crafted insult whilst looking at your computer screen thinking to yourself "ha if I tell this person to kill themselves I win the argument." While you were thinking up your creation of a masterfully crafted insult only the gods could come up with did you wonder why are you losing this argument of a online fight was there a point to this no there wasn't is there but you had to win in anyway you could you had to make sure that you have the upper hand but why, is it because your insecure about yourself you wordless peace of biodegradable plastic that will litter the human oceans for thousands of years. You may exist but not a living breathing and even dead soul wish for you to continue on this mortal plane and I personally don't blame them to want you dead.
---
My last trophy was sacrifice a total of 500 survivors.
---
Nice copypasta
---
I usually only run DS if i start getting tunneled a lot which happens a lot more than I'd like
---
I was once in a match against Hag. I found the Hex Totem pretty early- and of course the Hag had set a glyph in front of it (it was in one of those little alcoves where you can only approach it from one spot), and she was focusing 100% on keeping anyone away from it. Any time someone triggered the glyph, she'd teleport in and attack.
---
I realized that I could use it to keep her occupied while everyone else was working on gens, so that's exactly what I'd do- run up, trigger the glyph, lure her away until she gave up and set the glyph back up, then trigger it again, rinse and repeat. Awesome, right? My team would be able to work completely unhindered for the entire match. Easy-peasy, right?
---
Well, apparently the entire rest of the team refused to fix any gens until the totem was destroyed, and they found the totem too. But they had no idea how to work together, and the hag still kept her focus entirely on keeping that totem locked down, so long story short, before long the entire team was running around like chickens with their heads cut off getting slaughtered by the hag all because every one of them insisted on trying to get at the totem.
---
Not a single gen got done. The totem never got destroyed, either.
---
Would you share your usual Trapper loadout? That way we can more easily get a feel for your playstyle and any weaknesses associated with it.
---
Yeah but you can also just play killer to farm bloodpoints for survivor.
---
That wasn't a copypasta this is all handcrafted insults for a feeble man like you.
---
Fun isn't something one considers when sacrificing toxic survivors. But this, does put a smile on my face.. üòè
---
I have high hopes she will get nerfed this patch coming up
---
hell no
---
I was just talking about the base game achievements here but I have 21 achievements left when talking about the dlc achievements.
---
You won't find 5 of them that way. You'll do 4 but the most hidden one is going to end up boosting a bad killer with NOED.
---
If its early game it's because you caught them and they are upset... if it's late game it's to screw you out of points...at least that's what I've been told in after game lobby
---
I love Doc, so I want to spare you the pain I've suffered by playing him.
---
I really can't recommend a skillcheck build at any rank - at the high ranks it won't work, at the low ranks it'll just cause you to develop bad habits. Wait for a rework.
---
For best results, use Treatment Mode sparingly and only when you need to find survivors. For perks I'd keep Ruin (he needs it) but I'd avoid any tracking perks in favour of instadowns, chase shorteners, and gen regression tools - Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, NOED, Brutal Strength, Cruel Limits, Pop Goes the Weasel, that kind of thing.
---
Survivors go into T1 Madness easily, and their scream makes them easy to find. The problem is that T2 doesn't do much for you without add-ons, and Static Field takes far too long to put them in T3 (which is when you get free always-on tracking and survivors lose the ability to interact with most things).
---
At game start, Treatment Mode until the first scream, then *immediately* Punishment Mode for the chase and down. Hook them and move far enough away for Make Your Choice to light up - then just down either survivor after the unhook. If you don't have Make Your Choice, or if survivors aren't being altruistic, then just patrol in Treatment Mode until you flush another survivor.
---
Once all survivors are in T1, you can consider using Shock Therapy to try and push them to T3 Madness - but remember that hits take priority.
---
Doc games are going to be pretty stressful until at least one survivor is dead, but the above advice should give you a sporting chance at actually enjoying using him. Good luck!
---
They're not working on her right now.
---
Oh okay I go :(
---
Cant they learn through suffering like the rest of us did!?
---
Nah they just spam ''trash camper'' 500 times. Meanwhile i'm chasing another player on the other side of the map
---
Whilst searching for generators to do and at the same time preventing a 3-gen. U will encounter all the totems. At least thats my experience almost every game
---
I don't know if you're shading the "unpolished" version of the game or you're just joking.
---
Did you hook the Meg
---
Standing right next to the Wraith!
---
Are the models just freely available?
---
She is annoying but eh, what can we do? People were complaining about nurse since day one and she only had one blink taken away years ago, all for nothing since she can still get 5 blinks pretty easily and even without she's a murdering machine. 
---
Spirit is just unfun because you cannot outplay her without using xyz perks.
---
Wadaya mean tomorrow?
---
Yes, that‚Äôs why what he said isn‚Äôt that crazy. With a good hook you can watch 2 survivors while allowing 1 to get the save, in time to be close enough to camp.
---
I love it. SFM works so well for basic scenes. Great work! Made me laugh
---
It "helps", but I'm not confident it would be a competitive choice over other perks. 
---
To my ears vomiting survivors are pretty loud - are you having difficulties tracking them?
---
Yes. You can find them on the steam workshop. Nearly every survivor and killer is on the workshop. The maps aren't.
---
They dont want to play against a tunneling wraith either
---
Next time you tbag a trapper think back to when you typed up this thread
---
Sir where are you when they announced the mobile version?
---
She's fine how she is. I play more survivor than I do killer and I'll admit that she is fine!
---
I almost had that happen to me. Rather my teammates happen to come to me but they bagged, and used flashlights.
---
I had a slippery meat that game and offered a very offering of luck and managed to Kobe out.
---
They all died in the end and I got the hatch.
---
U cant outplay genrush either without perks and even with them. Why do you complain
---
So sweet of u
---
Same thing buddy. I was speculating for days with my GF. "Surely they wouldn't put only 6 achievements in, right? Surely it's gotta be 9. Otherwise the survivor challenges are just going to be adept Nancy, adept Steve, and the new map." Well, I was wrong too

Welcome to the club üéâüéâüéâ

New Killer: The Kid
---
New Survivor: John Coffey
---
New Map: The Green Mile
---
I only camp if I don't think I'll be able to get even a single kill otherwise.
---
The survivors will literally always pick Ruin and bbq. The killer will always pick DS/Adrenaline/BT. Plus the survivors can‚Äôt pick which addons you ant use because they‚Äôd have to know what killer you‚Äôre picking ahead of time which will lead to massive lobby dodging.
---
You can get a character to level 35-38 with 1 million bloodpoints depending on the bloodwebs spawn.
---
&gt;PFWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Disconnects aren't cool. One guy dipped instantly after being attacked and two others followed him out. I found this lonely Dwight that stuck around, and after a brief *"Are we cool?"* moment, I let him farm blood points and achievements. 
---
Using the Pig's crouch ability, I pretended to help out and nodded to the rhythm of the generators. I imagine the Entity was rather pissed about this match, but I'm just... "doing gens, you?"
---
Does the base game usually go on sale when a new DLC drops?
---
Replace Miky with a bugged survivor and the runner with any killer
---
Ruin and NOED are crutches for a lot of killer players, and encourage bad habits. More people should try not running them. 
---
Self Care is one of the most detrimental survivor perks in the game and people who run it are actively harming their team.
---
Adrenaline is a horrible perk because it has the ability to completely undo a killer‚Äôs work. It renders slugging and injuring people in the late game totally pointless, when that‚Äôs the point in a match that that sort of pressure is most important. Just like old DS, it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and demoralising to face. 
---
Throwing down the god pallet to prevent a down isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it. 
---
Iron Will is overrated due to loud ass footsteps and blood. It can help you out but it‚Äôs more situational than a lot of people admit.
---
I preferred playing old Freddy, new Freddy is less fun (though I think he has a design that‚Äôs better for the game).
---
Downvoting someone because you disagree with them is lame, especially in an ‚Äúunpopular opinions‚Äù thread. If someone posts a truly unpopular opinion you should upvote it as it‚Äôs contributing to the thread.
---
Man I think it would be funny as hell if it would be cujo. I think it would be both adorable and terrifying.
---
If there was a casual/less serious mode the only thing that would happen is people on both sides would go even more full tryhard in that queue because the expectation would be people aren‚Äôt going to play well/their best and you know how this community loves its ‚Äúomg look how much I ran the killer/look how easy I got a 4K‚Äù attitude.
---
Thanks! üéâüéâüéâ
---
Would have been much funnier, if you used num1/num2 for "grabbing" stuff from the table or doing gestures, instead of silly twerking, imo.
---
&gt; *Your fourth perk could be anythign that suits your playstyle.*
---
For the benefit of u/fourthwallcrisis, consider:
---
* Brutal Strength means you can Stalk at the pallet for a little longer due to being able to break it faster, as well as making more of them unsafe during T3.
---
* Deerstalker gives you the option of slugging a survivor in T3 so that you can chase and down another nearby one.
---
Heroes don't always wear capes.
---
I would have. That's usually how these things go, but he seemed to want to get the generators. I tried not to guide him unless there were things nearby that offered points like crates and pallets.
---
When the new map comes up I‚Äôm gonna do what I always do on new maps. Huntress‚Äôs Lullaby.
---
11am eastern time
---
I rarely ever get gen rushed, why? Because I am not a bum that camps or waste time on balanced landing neas on Haddonfield for 5 minutes at a time. If you do everything perfect and still get gen rushed then you were just unlucky to face 4 balanced landing neas on Haddonfield. Facing one spirit and one nea can be outplayed by going after Dwight and forcing neas into dead zones.
---
I hope you are forever protected by some magically force that makes sure your day is good, cuz u r an amazing hooman

There actually used to be a way. Course it was a glitch and is patched but there was a way
---
Thanks ;)

otzcheats.com(tm)
---
That is too damn cute... 
---
\*pats baby dweet on the head\*
---
&gt; *people are going to find something to complain about no matter what*
---
This is exactly the point. I'd suggest you ignore the postgame salt/hate and just enjoy playing the game - just remember that your opponents are people too, so you don't always have to be chasing that 5 minute 4k game.
---
Huntress, based on the real life equivalent is fucking terrifying, if it was rl we wouldn't leave scratch marks but the killers would still track through footprints and the like, which huntress is likely to be great at.
---
Because in some cases it‚Äôs a 60 second immunity to danger perk. In the early or mid game it‚Äôs totally fine to go for the rescuer, maybe if they‚Äôre both close, smack the hooked guy to either deny altruism points or trigger BT to waste their time. 
---
But in the late game/end game DS becomes a ‚ÄúI can misplay as much as I want and can‚Äôt get punished for it‚Äù Perk and if you don‚Äôt think an active DS at end game means you‚Äôre basically in god mode, you‚Äôre wild.
---
I think it's fine says a ghostface main
---
I personally wouldn't like survivors to have a passive. I prefer them to be skins so I won't be forced to play a certain character because they have a useful passive vs my favorite having a less useful passive especially since I've put a lot of bp in some survivors
---
Rip i'm on eu :/
---
Yeah that too.
---
I would rather have the hotel from the shining than anything from IT. At least it it is from the remake
---
Questionable.
---
Mouse has a higher "effective sensitivity" than controller - both on PC and on console.
---
On PC you have finer control on sensitivity through things like DPI settings or custom thumbstick curves - on console you're stuck with what you've got.

Ardetha's big brain teammate reference?
---
Would be dope! I can‚Äôt wait till they add him in! Ty btw had this name since PS3 days and was Jack Da Ripper on PS2 days
---
Unfortunately they can't exist in the current game.
---
The larger the Terror Radius, the more warning survivors have of your arrival, the easier it is for them to hide.
---
If you go for a skillcheck build, the problem is that survivors are continually trained to pass skillchecks - so once you hit a certain level of *experience* (not necessarily a certain *Rank*) these builds become harmful to the killer.
---
You don't need to take my word for it, multiple long-term players and streamers will tell you the same thing. It's one of the reasons why Doctor struggles at high ranks - his gimmick becomes effectively worthless (which saddens me, because I love Doctor).
---
High risk high reward, I agree it‚Äôs a situational perk but it‚Äôs mostly a perk high level players use because they normally get to the last gen.
---
That‚Äôs sucks I‚Äôll be in school until 2 pm so I can‚Äôt update it until I get back. Any idea on how big it will be?
---
Any advice on the nurse gen grab acheivment (in the void she kills(i think))
---
Pig or Legion. You could just gang up on them and restrain them quite easily.
---
No you are not. Although I‚Äôd rather see a bad teammate die because of their own mistakes, camping them is fine too.
---
If you‚Äôre playing at lower ranks where the games are more slow paced and people are more cautious, it‚Äôs not really worth running. It shines in fast games with teamwork where people will tank hits, repair while injured and play more aggressively.
---
Can confirm am the wraith over there
---
While I love horror films and quite a bit of SK's novels, I never really enjoyed the movie version of the Shining as a whole besides some small aspects, like the twins, the iconic carpet pattern and the "Here's Johnny" bit, so I wouldn't like a Shining chapter. Jack wouldn't be as a special and iconic-looking of a killer compared to the rest of the killer cast. Not to mention that it'll probably be impossible to get his likeness in the game, too.
---
This hits a little to close to home( RIP MY QUAD PARTY STREAMERS)
---
Legion has a speed advantage, and can really punish groups of survivors. For that reason I'd certainly take Discordance and Save the Best for Last.
---
Let's say Discordance shows you only two survivors - you run up and get a hit, you enter Feral Frenzy and get another hit, you run to the second survivor and give them a Feral Frenzy hit, there's no one about so you hit them again and drop out of Feral Frenzy, and then you down them. Congrats, you're on 5 stacks of Save the Best for Last from a single Feral Frenzy activation and now survivors can't risk crowding you whether they're injured *or* healthy.
---
Legion injures survivors fast, but struggles to down them. Save the Best for Last helps, but you'll want to take a slowdown perk such as Ruin or Pop Goes the Weasel - Legion's mobility plus the fast recovery due to Save the Best for Last means that you can have your choice of generators to kick.
---
You could certainly take both slowdown perks, and that may well be necessary at the highest ranks, but for variety you could consider just taking one and then having your final perk be a flex choice. Examples are Iron Grasp or Agitation for putting survivors in nasty places, Make Your Choice or Haunted Ground to trade your gen pressure for fast downs.
---
No clue and you need to get that PS remote play app and link your phone to it so you can kick in on while in class, I have mine all setup for automatic updates but for the past year won‚Äôt download shit while in rest mode! So it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and hate waiting around for it to download, copy then install and the copying part piss‚Äôs me off and don‚Äôt know why it needs to make a copy!
---
Did he get "Left for dead"? The achievement for doing the last gen and a gate as the sole survivor?
---
This reddit have so many minors
---
stay in school
---
Yeah, without it, it would be a monitor and abuse you'd have to work for
---
I understand the premise of looping. But I keep getting caught out where there are no loops/vaults, or where I run to has no pallets/isn't a jungle gym. So, do you only move away from a loop area when there is no killer? Do you just stick to a jungle gym when you find it?
---
RIP pink key.
---
This reminds me the time I helped a baby Laurie and Jake as legion, let‚Äôs just say I nod of compliance and we‚Äôre on our way to 32,000 BP
---
"Dont use decisive strike, borrowed time, bbq, or ruin for one match and win" - 1,000,000
---
Wow being a cunt for an opinion
---
Anyway my belief is that crossovers should not be as common as original content
---
I think so. In the post-game chat, he said he got a couple achievements. He finished all the gens and opened both gates, so that could've been one of them.

---
Does anyone have any citation of MCotes explaining why DBD doesn't have any serious gore/decapitation/etc? My google fu isn't working. I know why, but can't find any citation.
---
Nice. Let me know how it goes. I'm working on Skilled Huntress 55/100, Smoked 72/100, Silent Approach 13/25, Taking One for the Team ??/250 and Left for Dead 0/1. And 6 more once I buy Plague, Jane, Ash and Ghostface
---
My wife found at least one key in every match we played last night, many many hatch escapes! I love plunders! Then add ace in the hole with a shiny coin!
---
The only problem I see with this perk os the implementation. The terror is the same for every survivor currentpy. Other perks that adjust the terror radius probably only need to change 1 value. This perk would most likely require the killer to have a seperate terror radius for every survivor.
---
Not saying it's hard or impossible, just saying that this would require changed in existing code and when changing existing code, you often create bugs.
---
Why did I even write this? The perk is a great suggestion and no one cares about how these things are implemented
---
If he escaped through one of the gates he must have it now. If he escaped through the hatch, he denied himself one of the hardest achievements to get
---
Mmmm
---
This is a really cool idea
---
I mean yeah, when I play against Spirit as a survivor, and especially a good one, it's extremely tough.
---
With that being said, she's one of the few actually viable killers on higher ranks where basically every team is SWF and Spirit counters SWF pretty hard. I mean with Nurse also being nerfed, who else remains? Billy maybe? Yes there's an issue with only 3 killers being actually viable on high ranks but you won't solve this issue by nerfing all of them. Or yeah, nerf them, but buff the other killers to change the meta a little bit. The problem is that so many killers lack any map pressure, something that's crucial on higher ranks. I mean I love playing Michael for example, however I'm trying to play him now without a ruin now to try other builds and oh boy, it's actually insane.
---
I usually use doc for farming.Get around 70k bloodpoints by the end of the match.
---
Quit complaining, SWF‚Äôs is about to be even more unbalanced with the nutty new survivor perks.
---
He came to kill survivors and kick dogs off tables. And I don't see any dogs ...
---
Nah that's just his new trap "The Lag"
---
Fake pallets confirmed to increase killer's IQ by 200
---
Spirit doesn‚Äôt need a nerf, you just need to play better
---
I agree with her being unfun but there‚Äôs ways to make it unfun for her. A spirit relies on quote on quote ‚ÄúMindgames‚Äù as they call it when like a guy said they stand still and you pray. Spine chill will immediately remove this issue, say your at infinite and you crouch at the edge to the point that she still can‚Äôt catch you if she is not phasing and spine chill isn‚Äôt lit up stay at the loop, if it is run like hell. Another thing you can do with loops is just straight up abandon them so they can‚Äôt mind game period. This might seem counter productive and will get you killed trust me, a spirit relies on that loop to get a swing on you. And if you aren‚Äôt sure during a chase if she‚Äôs phasing gun it left or right and see if she commits to either direction or straight forward. 
---
That‚Äôs all on my end I can give advice wise, it works for me might not for others.
---
-Albert Einstein
---
I never couldve called that there would be an adept demogorgon achievement
---
By balanced you mean the worst killer in the game?
---
aww i was hoping for more achievements for survivors that arent adept/map related
---
It‚Äôs a glitch that they patched back during the beginning of the year but has been reappearing, we had it right in the middle of the exit gate walk thru on swamp! The killer just stopped and started looking at it up and down and shaking his head. Billy reved his aaa but was unsuccessful at chopping it down...
---
Me, not willing to cough up 12 dollars for 3 characters:
---
Pussy killer! We had a few of them last night! They couldn‚Äôt take the heat!
---
The ultimate Reveal
---
Really? That's interesting...  Surely it will be the same 500 auric cells?
---
I wonder how big of a update data wise it's going to be
---
I like it how old achievements are hard or grindy and the new ones are like ‚Äúdown 30 people‚Äù
---
Oh no the killer has NOED!!!
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you. You aren't wrong lol legion is by far the worst killer.
---
Lol. What a funny killer
---
You know you can blink?
---
Holy shit that's cool
---
I think you don't fully understand what heeant with the perk description. Yes, during 1 chase, you lower your terror radius by half, but only to the survivor you chased. The other survivors don't get affected by this perk (except for maybe the louder footsteps) so yes, it is very easy to lower 1 survivor's ability to hear your terror radius to 0 meters, but there are 3 other unaffected ones. Additionally, only basic attacks work.
---
I'm not saying that this perk won't be on the strong side, but it takes at least 4 chases to truly have the effect of monitor and abuse
---
Removing terror radius is a really dicey  concept, because if it's too easy then it has the potential to be OP very fast. Gen grabs become super easy on killers with little ambient sound, Borrowed Time doesn't work so camping is more prevalent, and it's just generally way easier to get the drop on survivors and get downs faster.
---
I wish I could have a build without DS with how killers play
---
We can‚Äôt be sure cuz they backed off with the dedicated servers
---
I think it‚Äôs up to 1.5GB but it should be much less
---
Damn, these dbd chapters keep on getting better
---
Especially considering "the Demogorgon" was given its name by the ST kids, as there was a monster by that name in their Dungeon and Dragons game.
---
Yeah, but I hadn't had much luck with it in that game so I wanted to try and confirm at least one hit before trying to blink.
---
So similar to Spirirt. I like it
---
that baby dwight in the middle
---
But what would his power be?
---
Many times
---
How do you work around this with communication?
---
Okay you draw bodies so well??
---
How about we give WGLF a usefull effect besides the BPs? BBQ is amazing for tracking, that's why Killers run it so often even if they don't need points. Maybe something like old BT? If the unhook was safe, you get protection for 20 seconds? But on the other hand, that could make it too OP if you combine it with current BT. Maybe something like old MoM? Every safe unhook gives 1/3 stack? Open for discussion
---
so fun indeed
---
Spine chill still exist
---
more like survivors that doesnt loop like a bitch\*
---
Isn't it free to play though? That might explain it. Most F2P games have a similar grindy-ness to it
---
Why did she leave him on the ground until bleed out just wondering
---
I do not fully understand what you are ranting about
---
I completely disagree the demogorgons shred is completely mediorce you just need to move left or right to counter it, most loops are not angled straightly meaning it's only good in-between the survivors running to a loop and you can't even control it at all meaning if the survivor moves even slightly behind cover you've missed and need to suffer the cooldown. The portals can be completely negated if you place them in a area that can become a dead zone meaning you wasted a portal and it gives enough time for survivors to run away if you placed one near a hook.   For perks Surge is completely RNG dependent if a survivor is near a generator that was worked on or not making it situational,Mindbreaker is only a 3 second or so exhaustion timer meaning standing still for 3 seconds completely counter it, Cruel limits is pretty damn bad as most areas just have pallets instead of windows making it even more situational. The demogorgon will just be a mid tier killer definitely not high tier.
---
Yeah you tell em trapper
---
I dunno, he‚Äôs definitely good, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs nurse or spirit though.
---
Yeah I agree, Demogorgon may give Nurse a run for her money
---
yeah he wasn't even doing that badly idk why he dc'd
---
So?
---
Well Ash and Bill rely heavily on weapons, which I think we can assume the entity robbed them of. 
---
Not sure Ash could beat Trapper or Mike with just his bare hands.
---
Ignore the crappy cropping please thanks
---
I used all my glass shards to do exactly the same.
---
Then i would teabag at the exit gates, then be surprised i couldn't escape. Then i would slowly look at the survivors around me, realizing i'm the killer, and rush at them... but itbwould be too late.
---
Just sayin. The map pressure and the Pounce are both pretty sexy
---
Very
---
Of course you do
---
Damn that‚Äôs toxic af
---
Mindgames for autistic kids.
---
I'm gonna be the only Ash there lol
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know. She almost let me bleed out too but I guess she changed last minute. I figured she was just toying with us
---
Demo is good but the shred is only good for long, straight loops. The portals are good but they‚Äôre far less powerful than Nurse or spirit but have better map pressure. Honestly, to me, demo is high mid to low top tier at best and, on someone new to him once people know how to play against him, will be low-mid mid tier.
---
Am I the only one who is getting tired of the shirtless meme?
---
The Pounce has a wider hitbox, and there was a thing where they were planning on refining it since sometimes it wouldn't hit when it should've. It's Mindbreaker and Cruel Confinement perks are gonna be good at high ranks bc of the Exhaustion and Genrush style
---
True, but those situations are rare and yet again are usually caused because of a killer failing to build their pressure
---
Eh I honestly do not like those killers they just waste my time lol. Maybe he thought you worked with her or something that‚Äôs what I think
---
shut up boomer
---
Can't forget most maps have curved loops meaning shred is only good in-between loops if the map is filled with curved areas and the portals can be completely useless if placed in dead zones and the survivors don't cleanse them
---
We don‚Äôt know. If I‚Äôd have to guess prob 12pm central time
---
Heard about 4pm for us
---
get lost idiot minor boy
---

---

---
This is unique, and seems balanced. Nice job!
---
Farm with people, that's how I did it
---
Well the pounce may have a wide hitbox but it is still countered by most loops as they curve instead of being straight ahead and the hitbox was buggy because of dedicated servers I believe and for mindbreaker wouldn't genrushing completely counter it as it only effected if generators are below 50% and for cruel limits it's completely map dependent as most maps are usually filled with barely any windows but filled with a bunch of pallets
---
Exactly my thoughts, if we go by the lore, she's been hunting since she was a little girl, it would be terrifying to face her irl
---
Unique attack: spits milk through the flower
---
Wow mad troll
---
It's nothing like being afk. The Spirit has to judge whether to wait or chase. If you make the wrong choice you could lose the survivor and waste time. It's essentially a bluff, would you say a poker player without a hand is afk?
---
As a Rank 1 Killer and Survivor I believe he will be very close to Huntress Tier.
---
His lung has a lot of loop ending potential but it can also be used to mindgame him at loops and make them longer. His skillcap is very high. His portals have some utility but are nowhere as good as Hags or Freddy‚Äôs teleport. Again, what‚Äôs going to make or break him is finding all the key locations you can take advantage of his lung attack. Definitely curious to see the interesting builds people come up with. Also, Nurse and Spirit are taking a hit with Nancy‚Äôs new perks which seem designed to counter them.
---
I WANT A BABY DWEET
---
I‚Äôve looked at your profile and oh my god I love these dbd comics
---
Well because it is an easy way to get 2 pips, nost people dont comunucate through discord so people waste time trying to save and it takes so long to do a gen compared to killing a survivor that it is a safe way to get 2 kills each game, specially thanks to stuff like noed.
---
Geniuses think alike
---
I think you spelled noed wrong...
---
Thank you, I really enjoy drawing them.
---
I remember Nurses with Ruin, BBQ, Remember Me and NOED
---

---
*Laughs in rank reset to 16*
---
Map pressure and quick attacks are what make a killer great. The Shred is good, not many killers have an attack that fast (Im aware it can be dodged), and the portals are a straight upgrade to Hag's, and Hag is good.
---
‚ÄùCongratulations you are being rescued, please do not resist.‚Äù
---
I was sick of it from day one.
---
Yeah i couldnt play the demogorgon that mutch on the ptb but he sure is fun and not weak so he's a great addition to dbd
---
I can't stab the shit out of you without coming closer
---

---
I don't mind hybrid kits from existing killers, but doc is already pretty terrible and his skill is meh. But what else does pennywise have outside of his fear generation? I'm just saying Pennywise, as is in literature, is lacklustre in DBD.
---
I find Demo's portals to be better since you use then at your own will and do not depend on someone else triggering it. Also they can't be crouched over to be countered, nor disabled by light. And if Hag is occupied and traps go off, they are wasted. Demo's can be disabled, but it takes longer and isn't instantaneous. And it sees you with Killer Instinct while you do it
---
Legion on the game. Team up and grab a knife each from the pig's torture room place and then chase the fucker down and kill him
---
Probably because they can't really do anymore I mean what are they gonna add a shotgun? They got all the stuff that could fit in the game and not seem odd
---
I don‚Äôt believe so but it does go on sale often
---
See told you it would give you luck ;)
---
my gud boi otz &lt;3
---
Damn it not the aids again
---
True, but Demo is not nearly as map dependent. Like, Demo will do just as good on Coldwind as Lery's.
---
I love this art style it looks really fucking cool
---
Thanks you for thw giveaway. I am very interested in ol demy boi so hopefully I can enter haha. Best of luck to everyone on here. See Y'all in the fog!
---
because the main point of the perk I THINK is the regression itself which makes it good but, but it does seem weird that its in the absolute catagory
---
Hag has an add on that allows her to use her trap the same way but she can plant 10 however she doesnt have to deal with the dumb placing another portal and taking 6 seconds to travel through the upside down
---
But you get so much more for chases and disrupting progress. Max Chase BP is a godsend at all levels, is it not?
---
There shouldn‚Äòt really be a perk that‚Äòs rewarding you for losing, let‚Äòs be honest
---
I heard they were nerfing his cooldown by .25 seconds on a missed shred. I guess it makes sense since you could gain more distance by spamming shred instead of regular walking.
---
My bad. I forgot people still can‚Äôt cleanse totems until Nancy‚Äôs perk comes out today.
---
You're welcome sport!
---
Who‚Äôs Ardetha
---
I wonder if you were that doctor that was just shocking everyone for the whole match and then apologized to everyone in a group PM :D
---
That's an addon that has to make that viable. Demo is like that base kit. And if you want to bring addons into the mix, check Monto's vids on it. Demo has addons that make it travel way faster.
---
Nah that wasn‚Äôt me.
---
Did you have premade with the all 4 survivors hatch trophy. It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôm missing
---
Maybe flare gun? 1 charge, depletes after use. Stuns and blinds the killer if shot for 3.5 seconds. Head shots make blindness last 1 second longer
---
It would depend on which Perks you could actually add. If you could just Add the Standard Perks, David would be the only one with "We are gonna live forever", which is not all to bad, being the only Survivor to Farm Bloodpoints. 
---
That being sad, you could probably just ignore David and farm in the "Normal Mode", but still, i try to find some Arguments ¬∞\^¬∞
---
Honestly this is one of the main reasons why I hate vsing the spirit. Is there a counter play that I'm not aware of? I don't know what to do other than run around and make weird looking scratch marks
---
Poor analogy. In poker, even if you're bluffing you still have to perform actions within the game. You're still giving your opponent something to react to, even if you're trying to play an angle. 
---
The spirit's "stand still" mInDgAmE at windows and loops has literally the same effect whether or not the player is sitting at the PC not pressing anything, or has just walked away to make a drink. For the survivor, there's visually no difference.
---
This is actually really good! I would honestly pay for this survivor!

---
If you have to go to an area where there are no loops (like theres a generator there) you need to scope out the area and see where the nearest loops/gyms etc are so you can get there quickly and minimise time in the open when the killer shows up.  
---
Also this is where exhaustion perks like Sprint Burst/Balanced Landing etc come in really handy. As well as perks that give you early warning of the killer coming like Spine Chill.  
---
Personally i will run a jungle gym until i have to throw down the pallet, then try to make it to another. A lot of the time the killer will have bloodlusted me down by then, but remember, it's not always about winning chases but lasting long enough to buy time for your team
---
I believe any killers that aren't really mobile should be territorial instead, protecting some gens that are standing close together in some place that is more or less easy to protect while cleaning that zone from pallets. You won't be really able to distribute your pressure over the whole map with those killers if you don't have some perks that slow down the gen fixing process.
---
On top of that, each time you can't mindgame survivors to end the chases quickly or can't find them hiding, you're loosing your chances at snowballing the pressure.
---
Long story short, I believe it's more experience and perks than killers you are playing as.
---
When does it end?

This is a great post, thanks mods!

It helps, however the sound sick survivors make is loud enough that i would consider it a wasted perk slot.  
---
Given that most good survivors cripple Plag by not cleansing, thus denying her how power, she really needs all the perks she can get
---
yes you are absolutely right. i don‚Äôt know what was going through my head

Monto is surely good but he even said that he doesn‚Äôt enjoy playing Killer at red ranks anymore.

That's not at all unpopular, except to Spirit mains.

I wonder how people feel about this. I'd much rather the killer hook me so I can move onto an actual game. Doing 5 gens by myself is not fun, and the points per minute is probably less than playing a real game.
---
I did the same thing last night. I was matched up as Nurse and I got a fair hit on a P2 Bill. A second later, he and his buddy left. So I farmed with the 2 remaining guys (one of which was actually a Twitch streamer who was streaming at the time) and let them go. I refuse to let 2 people pay because another 2 decided to fuck them over.
---
yeah i don‚Äôt know what i was thinking.

New Huntress Buff: 
---
If the Huntress is out of Hatchets, instead of reloading, she can now grab Survivors by the neck and hurl them bodily across the map.

---
IT chapter two just came out. Gotta be Pennywise. And I am looking forward to it so much.

Thanks that helped me understand where you are going. I think this is a really good idea and hopefully the mods will this and take it into consideration.
---
The only map where Spies From The Shadows does anything useful :/
---
With ease. Honestly, I started as a survivor and sucked at it. I then became a killer main which subsequently helped me learn how to better play survivor. Playing one side improves playing the other.
---
Borrowed Time helps a ton. You can also try using Head On and stunning the killer by jumping out of one of the lockers near the stairs to give everyone time to escape, but it‚Äôs a teachable perk on a locked character so might be a while before you‚Äôre able to get it.
---
Real talk, that was super nice of you! And good on him for not DCing, too.
---
And they wouldn't get DS or Adrenaline. If your entire game requires a certain perk then it's a crutch and you have no right to complain about anything. If you can't 4k or escape perkless then you're just along for the ride at best.

I think you'll find it's your afk analogy that's poor. Have you ever actually played Spirit? You don't just stand there doing nothing, you have to make a bunch of split second decisions in order to mindgame. Is this a good spot to do it? How long should I wait? Has the person fallen for it? All at the risk of the survivor making an easy getaway if they don't bite.
---
&gt;For the survivor, there's visually no difference.
---
Which is part of what makes it a mInDgAmE.
---
I'd like you to try something for me. Load up a game as Spirit, find a survivor, and then go afk. Walk away and make yourself a drink. Then please report back how many kills you get. Hint, it'll be zero.

I think it should be harder to build up or you should be able to lose stacks. Some killers like Nurse, Micheal, Hag(?) will have an easy time getting hits and will capitalize on it the most. Just imagine a god Nurse or tier 3 Micheal with monitor running this perk as you suggest it now.

I get to rank 1 every reset because I do a fuck ton each game. I don't want to do a fuck ton but if I didn't 60% of my games would be a straight up loss without any forethought, neither would it even be close to "fun". I want to win, not fuck about and not give a shit.
---
Side note: While you self hinder to stay at rank 10, I guarrantee a fuck ton of garbage is still there from old rank 1. Old rank 1 you could 4k with someone like Trapper without Ruin. That is virtually impossible on this system unless you're playing against claudettes who pretty to get their hands on a bush rather than a fucking a generator.
---
Oof ok
---
Knew the cooldown would be a bit longer just wasn't sure
---
I‚Äôm happy to see that the jojo community is creeping their way into dbd
---
You realize that Hag can get from point A to B in an instant right? Her traps also have a cam swing which can be used to throw survivors off while running loops. She can also use the traps to create a choke point at pallets and practically guarantee a hit. And obviously Hag can telephoto from any point on the map so long as she is within range, whereas Demo needs to be at another portal or take the time to set one up. He'll be below Hag if anything.
---
For me it should be roughly 4PM then

Think about it from the other side though.  If you were playing survivor and you were downed at the beginning of the match, would you want the killer to sit there and stare at you just so they could get a kill?  It would ruin your game because you wouldn't even have a chance to play.
---
If, as killer, you down and hook someone and then run off you are letting them play the game as well.
---
Points are great.  Wins are great.  But at the end of the day it's up to us to make sure everyone has fun at the same time.

Its an excellent game that could be expanded on a lot. There could be more to the gameplay than just repairing the generators, or just escaping the level. Also, the graphics look excellent compared to other games of its type, but they are slightly outdated compared to most AAA games. It sounds like I'm complaining, but I'm just giving ideas. I really like the game.
---
the one bubba i can actually kinda apreciate
---
Idk, the lunge looks like it's going to be super rewarding to master with practice. It can shut some of the best loops in the game down with a little precise timing and reading.
---

They‚Äôre similar but Blink is clearly superior. You can use it far easier than Pouncing in a chase and it works better at short loops, which is also here Pig‚Äôs Ambush works better than Demo‚Äôs Pounce.

I am yet to see anyone who plays survivor and killer at rank 1 think that spirit needs a nerf. There's maybe an argument to nerf prayer beads but most killers have 1 super strong add on. If you understand how to play spirit at rank 1, you'll be much better at playing against her.
---
Instead of this I'd like to see 3 dailies every single day, if you can't complete them until then next day they get replaced by another 3 dailies
---
Hopefully in 3 hours.
---
Buddy, I'm crying too
---
i did, and she wasnt scary. The only legit scary killer is Myers.
---
Pig's ambush is really good in general, but I digress. I find the Shred to be nice overall. While it isn't a blink, it is the next best thing. And with the pressure that Demo has, the two abilities could combo well
---
What are you talking about?
---
Fire Up is a very niche perk at the moment. It literally only works up to it's full potential when all gens are powered.
---
25% to vaulting, breaking, and pickup isn't nearly as bad as you make it out to be seeing as how ALL the gens would be finished at that point.
---
These are confusing times

---
Why do I want this so bad
---
They do combo extremely well but you also need to know when you use them. That‚Äôs why you would need practice. It‚Äôs not gonna be like Billy where you can pick him up and do decent.
---
Impossible? It‚Äôs easy, I managed it without much difficulty! I got it three hours after Bill was live on PS4.
---
God have mercy on my soul, I'm getting weaker by every minute that passes

---
No they pushed back the release date of dedicated servers as a whole until the end of fall 2019 because they said they were not satisfied with the outcome so far
---
I usually don't see that. Usually I see people pick up Billy and run into trees.
---
Overall I think Demogorgon is gonna have a high skill cap like Nurse and is gonna be one of those killers that are amazing once mastered

Probably Legion. Think about it; they‚Äôre all either 18 or 19. They‚Äôre not strong. Just gang up on one of them, take their knife, and kill them.
---
As a nurse main I get pretty well countered when people play carefully and immersed, rather than running around like headless chickens expecting to outrun me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---

---
The problem is, is you have a quick tier list:
---
Nurse&gt;spirit&gt;Billy&gt;freddy&gt;hag&gt; everyone else.  (This is with add-ons)
---
Everyone else has some okay things, but I would say near the bottom of the everyone else bucket is clown and doc. The former because of window vaulting changes being a silent nerf to clowns gas, and doc is slow and doesn't have the control.
---
Right now, map presence and pressure is beyond important. If you can't control the map, you're a dead killer. I figure demo will push hag down as he has good control of the map but requires set up (like hag).
---
But noed did nothing there... I am cofusion

It‚Äôs not confirmed yet but most speculate it‚Äôll be around 16:00 (UCT Time).
---
In 2 hours from what i heard but im not 100% sure.
---
I thought that's when updates usually happen, no too sure tho, its catered towards the Americas so yeah it does seem late to us but early for them.
---
Seriously. You can still get a lot of reward for actually playing the game even when it's not going great for you that round, and dc'ing just screws everyone over but mostly yourself

Noed or not, he was still injured after adrenaline. Silly Dwight.

I'm willing to bet it's been delayed with dedicated servers. At E3 they mentioned the switch version was using dedicated servers because the switch has shit Wi-Fi.

I‚Äôd personally say intermediate is best for him. He‚Äôs not hard but he‚Äôs not super easy either.
---
I know, but it gives the killer a speed boost too. But u know noed is the one perk that survivors hate the most.

Hahaha. Bubba: How dare you?

Thanks. (:
---
Okay, now i need this
---
It's weird, Freddy has all the endgame perks and used to be the best for an endgame build but now he's kind of the worst. He loses half his power since he can't teleport to gens anymore, and snares do nothing at gates if the survivors awake. It'd be cool if they let him teleport through gates, but it's fine either way since he's already pretty strong.
---
I feel bad for who ever got that tattoo
---
How old are you?

Just did the same last week. Pretty much gave up on it until a killer messaged me and my swf teammate asking to farm. We figured this would be the only chance ever to get Where Did They All Go, actually had smart team members, it was great. By far the hardest of all the achievements
---
I recently found out that if you‚Äôre crouched you don‚Äôt trigger the traps, so next time that happens just crouch over to the totem and start cleansing it
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
I want it because I'm still missing the Halloween DLC, and that void Myers leaves can only be filled with a Demogorgon
---
Congratulations to you then on getting it last week! :)
---
Nice! I got it a couple days ago. For me I got 500 sacrifices in one match, then killed all survivors in the next one to get it.
---
Personal opinion but I‚Äôd rather this scenario. It shows me, as the survivor, that the person playing killer has some empathy and at the very least wants to get as much out of the game as I do. I don‚Äôt mind when killers keep playing as intended when there are disconnects - after all it‚Äôs probably not their fault and they shouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äòplay nice‚Äô when there are disconnects - but when they do it shows character.
---
Congrats how long did it take?
---
Now that‚Äôs good sportsmanship
---
No worries, we have a good bunch of ppl so far so launch day will be fun
---
Discounts have already hit at least on ps4

This is so ridiculously OP without a way to lose tokens

You get downed once and the killers TR is already cut in half for you for the rest of the entire game
---
wtf
---
Everybody here is just talking about r/imsorryjon
---
Thank you! This was actually really helpful. I don‚Äôt have ruin yet. But I‚Äôm working on it! Thank you again. I realize I naturally do the perimeter setup on more open maps like the wrecker yard or farm. Those have a bunch of gens in a single area. I just need to be more efficient and stop overthinking it.

This rank reset has been horrible.  It's been nothing but camping killers and teammates that DC as soon as they even see the killer.
---
You're killing hag mains by revealing their weakness. What's next, you're gonna tell people Doctor's static field is his terror radius?
---
Stairs change?
---
Then why exactly do you think it matters that he uses no mither?
---
It's not the worst perk in the game. It's biggest downside is that the killer knows you have it.
---
Lmao I hope you‚Äôre joking
---
Sprit is NOT very balance and fun to play against because as survivor you have to guess most of the time , even with iron will, a good spirit can destroy you, and lets be honest guys... spirit is one of the most easy killer to use.

Honestly if you're not a god at the game the only killers that don't need ruin are nurse,billy,spirit and maybe freddy,all because they have high mobility and chase potential.

had a similar idea a while ago when it comes to not showing the fact you're broken and starting healthy, I think it's a good idea personally.

Pussy DCs miss out on hail mary matches where your team gets wrecked and you find the hatch last minute.

You wanted to get the maximum amount of teabagging, didn't you

That too. And lightborn which I never would ever use

My apologies, I didn't realise I was talking with a true intellectual. Forgive me if I can't keep up, I am but a humble, dumb killer.

Have you met my friend Trapper? He can literally down people whilst not even at the keyboard from the other side of the map. No doubt you'll be raging against him next.

---
&gt; Have you met my friend Trapper? He can literally down people whilst not even at the keyboard from the other side of the map. No doubt you'll be raging against him next. 
---
Nah, he has to actually set those traps manually, with forethought. Not just afk his controls. :)
---
Unless he's using the ultra-rare add-on, but I'm not too worried about traps that are set in the middle of a field.
---
Survivors get punished for failing to cleanse totems lmfao

No it's not funny. It's a lack of respect for playing fairly

Thanks friend
---
How do you know she played fairly? And how do you know his intention was to taunt or mock them? Teabagging is seen as toxic because of its implications, looking back dramatically on the kill screen has no implications.
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve played against a decent amount of hags recently
---
My rank is shit tho so
---
Happened to me yesterday I hid in a locker ate myself some spaghet and I was the lay one alive with three birds HEY FUCK HEAD THE LAST GUY IS IVER HERE like jeez crows piss off no one uses spies in the shadows any way

Appreciate it

Damn that image is old.
---
Amanda, the Hag, the Clown.
---
Yeah, my bad. Got 2 comment threads mixed up. But to be fair, otz may be nicer but his gameplay can certainly be described as toxic (not by me, the community at large)
---
This is a repost, but the images are much better than the old version so I personally like it. Updoot achieved.
---
Survivor bad
---
For real? I thought we always had to wait a couple of days... but this is of course better. But do you have an estimate regarding time or...?
---
ok
---
Wooooahhhh you mean. You love Steve, but you like Nancy a little bit more. Because if you don‚Äôt like Steve, there‚Äôs a big problem here.
---
Mb I posted a link to a studio thing lmao
---
nope always the same, unless there are problems
---
DLC usually launches at that time for most games including DBD so it sounds right.
---
As a killer main, I have a general rule that if 1 person DC I will still play regular (unless the team turns out to be total trash) but if 2 or 3 DC I will always let the remaining players farm. If for no other reason than I at least want a black pip from the game lol

I believe it's supposed to be out by 11am eastern standard time :)

Jumpscare Myers does this in every game as well. I did not know why he did this at first, but when he showed Survivor's POV I finally understood his humor

I wonder ü§î
---
My Pennywise idea is different:
---
1. Pennywise can charge sprint like he does in the movies but unlike the Hillybilly, he doesn‚Äôt down them automatically and can only hit them once. Also unlike the Hillbilly, he can also turn around corners with ease.
---
2. He can summon balloons - more balloons spawn depending on how many generators have been finished. A small number appear upon the game‚Äôs start. 
---
The balloons were will either spawn at key locations or be placed randomly throughout the map and when a survivor is within range, they will  home in on them and burst in their face revealing their location. 
---
Add-ons can cause different effects, inflict damage to survivors or even cause a fake Pennywise illusion to appear and chase them, which does no damage.
---
3. Pennywise can transform himself into a red balloon and teleport to a nearby survivor. Survivors may not know if Pennywise is disguised as a red balloon as he moves at the same speed that other red balloons move at, confusing them.
---
Mori - Pennywise jumps on a survivor, shows his teeth and eats their heart.
---
Probably Nea
---
The Plague!
---
Wait they banned the Gru meme? That sucks
---
ye, but enjoying playing at Red ranks isnt what I would appreciate or Call skill, still I know he isnt a Bad Player
---
Meg.
---
Made it easier to get around the killer on stairs. Before killer could easily keep survivors on stairs by moving left or right.
---
Look around whilst in cover and try to figure out where the killer is what s/he's doing before moving. Perks like spine chill and bond also help with awareness.
---
Aha, I was looking too closely at the "do you only move away from a loop" part, reckoning that you were talking about the empty space when moving from one loop to another (which is covered in at least one of the linked guides).
---
If the issue is being in a "dead area" then it sounds like u/Shanoa_Andune has you covered - scope the area first, and know your "exits". Whenever the killer shows up then you'll be able to move to them quickly and then perform standard looping.
---
90% of the time I get hit with Head On it's when I'm just passing through some random set of walls and it scares the shit out of me every time
---
I‚Äôd still main Feng.
---
Turns out they're actually adding the Fog as a killer, every match ends with Dwight murdering his fellow survivors right before the exit gates open and screaming in pain as he realizes what happened.
---
Outside of red ranks I feel like there aren‚Äôt enough interesting mindgames
---
Meg is prob the only survivor with 3 decent main perks
---
The hatch opens for 30 seconds
---
God you are soft AF.
---
You don't need spies of the shadows to see the AFK crows, or atleast I don't think so.
---
This Claudette life is not easy
---
Haha true
---
Killer: Clown for Bamboozle and PGTW
---
Survivor: Claudette cuz SC
---
So at rank 1 a no mither player isn't going to be a troll? Yeah sure buddy.
---
pretty typical but Claudette. she is still one of the best characters in the game imo
---
Yea I know it was just a joke
---
That‚Äôs awesome! I had a Pig do this for me once, too. And as a survivor I would never DC because I don‚Äôt want the killer to have a shitty game just because someone couldn‚Äôt handle being hooked, etc.
---
If you go KYF why not just do it? It's not like choosing a random killer or random perks is impossible and if you're going KYF just tell whoever you're with to do the same.
---
the joke is that Pennywise would overshadow Jeffrey, which isn't likely at all since they functionally kill in entirely different ways and also have drastically different powers, motives, and  backgrounds.
---
Nea
---
Feng, Bill or Jeff but I‚Äôm maining Ash right now
---
That is, in fact, very true
---

---
No, no, no my friend. You're being far too soft while moving those goalposts. Any brain-dead moron can play Trapper and then LITERALLY just go afk and LITERALLY kill an entire team. He desperately needs to be needed and I think you're the one to lead the charge. Only you have the required IQ to get this done and finally rid the game of this disgustingly easy killer once and for all.
---
Nurse. 
---
Who needs perks if your power is stronger than them anyway?
---
Sometimes it's just worth farming them. Better than letting them die and once players are off the hook there's a chance they can get free with DS or Flashlight saves. 
---
But you're right, most of the time it's suicide. If a killer has decided to facecamp in the basement and there's two survivors down there, someone is gonna die. Best just to punish his lack of gen pressure, but I know that's easier said than done.
---
Well, I'd like to enter because the only DLC I have was Leatherface. I was so dumb back then...

---
Laurie
---
Cannibal
---
in that case it'll come with time as you learn the maps and the possible tilesets
---
also having perks like empathy/bond to show your teamates can help you know when they've dropped pallets etc in chases. Also theres nothing to stop you scoping out those things as you're moving towards the hooked victim. Don't just be looking out for the killer as you're going for the unhook, make sure you're looking for an escape route too
---
Im working on it, struggling with getting merciless killer on huntress and cannibal. that and the "take 250 hits after unhooking a survivor" one is hard
---
Well xbox is usually the one who waits awhile. Feel bad for them sometimes honestly
---
no
---
You will be the only one. Literally the only one
---
It's key time!
---
I would assume people finding Enduring + Spirit Fury unfair is simply because you are playing correctly in a chase where you stun the killer to slow them down, but that perk combo effectively punishes you for doing so and basically guarantees an extra hit on you despite you not messing up in the chase at all.
---
Most complaints about perks on the survivor and killer side are of perks that do this, most of the perks are fair, maybe 1 or 2 could use some tweaking, but I understand why people get upset going against these.
---
I don't care though really, just pointing out how most people run basic builds all the time.
---
yeah, still getting used to the game. thanks for the tip.
---
I like Monto but I don‚Äôt like watching him play survivor. His whole vibe fits way better around killer. If he streamed R1 killer gameplay I‚Äôd be stoked.

---
what vibe? I love watching him cause its so relateable and he actually knows how to run a Killer :D
---
It's one of those things that you pick up through experience, whether the old-fashioned way or by watching other players. Otzdarva is a Trapper main, good place to start for Trapper advice - significantly improved my own Trapper play *overnight*.
---
As a Trapper you really need to think like a survivor would - trapping a building/landmark is great, but if the survivors have no need to play around it then all those traps are doing nothing. For example, I trap around basement if I'm running a basement build because the expectation is that I'll be doing basement loops on unhook. If I'm not expecting to loop it, I leave it unprotected and let survivor paranoia do the work for me.
---
On the more open maps, there's not as many landmarks - so you're not getting caught up on trapping an area that no survivor is ever going to be involved with.
---
I guess it's partly efficiency, partly about mindgames. Anyhow, check out Otzdarva's Twitch or curated Trapper clips on his Otzdarva YouTube channel - a real eye-opener!

I shouldnt be laughing this hard... but it's so accurate that I cant not laugh.

That you could move to anywhere and the spirit has to try to find you without being able to see you. Yes, the spirit has the advantage in the chase/mind games. Killers need to have the advantage, they're up against 4 survivors.

i would've hoped that there would be one that if you get unhooked at struggle 30 times you'd get the achievement or something thats usually related to the new perks
---
Image was found ages ago on twitter so not mine lol.  It suits though. Sorry reddit only just allowed me to comment
---
You drew legion and he drew my blood from me with that god damn frenzy.
---
Id go to the 99%
---
Maybe it gains stacks only on hits that down survivors?
---
I thought you were asking what date they're updating on at first. Just realized you meant what time. Should be later tonight, like past 5 pm est from what I've heard.
---
Wait about two or three hours
---
?
---
Haha yeah! Was quite something :)
---
Builds can't be toxic. Toxicity is behavioral.
---
Which one of you poomamas is downvoting everyone‚Äôs comments?
---
mettle of man is just sitting in my blood web at this point
---
It'll be around $12 and it's coming out sometime today.
---
It's only because I'm getting a lil bit better and starting to get how the hatchets work. Lmao and my friends call me toxic whenever I am putting my perks up.
---
Dude that was probs me, I am trying to DC less but with bad days I just like, "Nope."
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
I'm not the guy you originally talked to, I don't dodge lobbies, but it does matter if someone uses no mither, its a bad perk, the only one in the game I can think of that actually hinders the team
---
You soak up less time in a chase, you can't take hits for teammates, the killer is alerted if you have it so no one slugs against it, it just does nothing for you at all and takes away from what you can do, and since survivors have to work as a team, you are hurting 3 other players odds of winning with 1 single perk
---
But come on you brought rank in to this "AReNt YoU aT A RAnK tO KnOW whY"
---
I don‚Äôt think any build is toxic, you should play how you like to and how you most have fun lol.
---
That said, you have a decent build, I would say add something in there to slow down gen progress and you‚Äôd be good, maybe something like ruin, huntress lullaby or pop goes the weasel. Depending on how well you swing or if you land most of your hits, I‚Äôd get rid of unrelenting personally.
---
Big insidious bubba energy
---
yes
---
Nope, not toxic at all. Really the only toxic build for Huntress is using her Iridescent Hatchets add on alongside her Infantry Belt add-ons 
---
I'd advise not using iron grasp unless you find survivors often wiggling free and not to use unrelenting as it's a crutch perk that will prevent you from learning how to land a safe blow on a survivor
---
It comes out on the 1st of april, 2017. When the fuck do you think?
---
Im going for demogorgon first i wanna hunt some ahoi boyz
---
Meg, Claudette, Kate, Steve, and Nancy.
---
Yeah I land most of my hits on them, especially lunges so I just think unrelenting is good to have.
---
Hahaha!
---
Dwight and Hag.
---
Wow ok thanks!
---
In the basement
---
It doesn't say anything about tokens.  It looks like a one time deal like Sloppy or Third Seal.
---
Epic. I love this
---
There can be only 1 Claudette.
---
OH ITS TOMORROW I TOTALLY FORGOT
---
this is a surprisingly good fan perk
---
Lol why the fuck would you tattoo yourself with such cringe?
---
NOED is more powerful than adrenaline.
---
Fight me cunts.
---
Found the internet explorer user
---
Really depends. There's many ways to signal the killer that you're ready to die (crouch dance) and there's always the hatch.
---
Thug life.
---
DS?
---
How long does it take for flashlight to blind the killer? I always try to use it but I just end up getting chased and not blind the killer
---
bro wtf
---
Actually, I'ma level up nancy first so steve can get her teachable perks. #1 Steve main right here.
---
Holy fucking shit thank you man, nobody knew about this woohoo I'm so excited for it to drop, anybody know when???
---
whens the ptb
---
Yes. Ideally you‚Äôd want to save, slowly enter the locker and then stun the unsuspecting killer when they come down the stairs. 
---
You‚Äôre probably best off just unlocking Borrowed Time ASAP, it‚Äôs a really strong and useful perk in general.
---
i personally think she needs a buff considering over half of the maps arent very good for her with all the stuff in the way when she tries to snipe people with hatchets
---
You are amazing. Thank you!
---
I know, so you don't have to play killer and tell this stupid things
---
Noob5 is my guy, js.
---
OH WAIT ITS TODAY
---
You‚Äôre right.
---
Especially on Huntress if you run out of hatchets
---
Admittedly I rarely play as her but used to when I first got the game lol
---
My only thought is that it might have been a pride thing, that he didn't want to win off of the killers sympathy?
---
Thx
---
Wraith win this easily, i cant take a team full of the same character serious. &lt;3
---
Perfect Tier 1 Myers perk and pair that with M&amp;A and you have a Tier 2 Myers as well.
---
Farming is not what main killers do
---
You are one friendly pig!
---
Aight thx!
---
Yeah thanks buddy.
---
I'm finishing Nea and I'll spam Meg for Adrenaline and whoever have Borrowed Time
---
I have heard that if you shine flashlight on a spirit, she cannot phase (even before stun, like nurse supposedly cannot blink if you shine on her), is that true?
---
Also is it true that you can check if it is spirit‚Äôs husk or real spirit by trying to flashlight blind her (beam will not start tightening)?
---
no dbd dlc worth it
---
save your money
---
should be in 1hr or 2 at most
---
Myers looks at you with those sexy eyes while ghostface plays peekaboo.
---
[this boi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYQrqqAUpjrpLJKoYyZXSKg)
---
Im sorry jon
---
It should be out around 8-9am pst
---
should be 1-2hrs
---
np! As the Huntresses kit, while unique, is simply in design, you can really do any perks with her. The only perk that uniquely synergizes with her would be Iron Maiden as you can reload at lockers faster
---
Hoodie? What does that- oh
---
Surprised he didn't escape through the hatch as soon as he saw it
---
Fake
---
Pennywise is not horror flavor of the month he is eternal
---
This would be part of the ultimate jumpscare Myers
---
Dedicated servers can't come soon enough. The era of people posting here about what they will claim is a false ban over them disconnecting too much will be a glorious time.
---
That sucks man. Who you planning to level up? For me its going to be nancy, had a bit of a crush on her watching the series xD
---
Iri Hatchets, Infantry Belt, NOED, Ebony Mori
---
EVERYONE SAY THANK YOU BEHAVIOR
---
You know what would be hilarious is if the entity canon HATES pennywise
---
UP isn't very good, but it can be fun if you run Iri Pin on Legion with Ruin, after feral frenzy stab your terror radius affects whole map
---
New killer: The Car
---
Power: Vroom
---
Run survivors over, killing them instantly.
---
Hahaha what did we do to deserve drake and josh
---
Nice meme! I can imagine the bubba grunts now
---
A lot of people on Twitter or even here on Reddit don't know about DbD on mobile, and they say stuff like the 3 quotes OP used.
---
They are different, but definitely connected. I have seen many times where an M1 killer is chasing an injured survivor for so long, finally getting a hit, only to have the last gen pop and boom.. there goes the survivor. NOED is a strong counter to situations like that, and yet it still has a counter of its own.
---
Cant wait for every game to be 1 large mouth bass trying to hook 4 sailers.
---
Scoop gang!
---
For all the new players that decide to play as the new Demogorgon or any other killer, just get ready for the trolling and teabags. In the early ranks, you‚Äôll probably be playing against experienced players who may have actually deranked to at least rank 15 (which is the lowest I think you can go) or people on alt accounts. Don‚Äôt let them get to you and just focus on how to get better. If you‚Äôve been perusing the subreddit in the past few days, you may have seen a certain streamer gaining some love who makes some really good videos for players at all levels. In his stream, he always links the video I will link below that goes in depth on which killer he recommends new players to start with or which one you will feel right with.
---
From my experience, the trolling usually gets less and less the higher you go. I remember a few weeks ago when I finally came back to the game I just faced nothing but SWF (Survive With Friends) groups who just wanted to mess with me at rank 17 or so, but as soon as I started getting high up in green and purple, the game was played more and I could tell why I was losing in certain games instead of having trolls just throw pallets down, body block me when I was about to hook their friend, spam flashlights, etc.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC and the end game chat gets too much for you, I‚Äôve heard that there‚Äôs a way to hide the chat in settings. I don‚Äôt know where as on PS4 (the platform I play on) there is no end game chat.
---
Here‚Äôs the video by otzdarva on killer choice: [Which Killer should you buy first?](https://youtu.be/C49wygOeZ5I)
---
There seriously needs to be DC penalties in this game. Its getting worse and worse.
---
I dont
---
Maybe not for you. The hatch sound is regularly bugged for me so I can only find it by vision, which lets be honest can be very hard to keep up with in chase.
---
i love the amount of it chapter 2 memes
---
You are one wholesome Piggy ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Oh, okay, got'cha
---
You live up to the clown in your name
---
LOL
---
What's free weekend?
---
one time i got told i‚Äôd be reported for ‚Äúteeming‚Äù
---
I rarley dc, but yesterday i was playing killer and was looking right at a survivor without being in a chase so they keep vaulting a window. I also was having server prob so i dced.
---
For me I'm going to do Laurie first as I need DS! Then probably Nancy followed by Steve
---
I don't have a citation, but I know part of it has to do with licensor restrictions (The example given was not decapitating Tapp), so you might find something searching for that.
---
Why do you say that?
---
MOM was definitely OP when it first came out. That being said, the other things you listed are also OP, especially Ebony Moris, since they can be applied to every killer. Literally cuts the killers work in half.
---
Alright thanks
---
I know
---
You forgot ruin and bbq
---
Myers? Why would they change him?
---
Tbh, I don't really mind which killer, but I'd go with Jack/The Shining, purely for the Overlook hotel map.
---
OP is asking for optimal builds, avoiding crutch perks is very important or else they are going to get stomped on once they get out of low ranks.
---
And as Huntress, why would you want to *go out of your way* to put a survivor in the basement. You want hooks out in the open so you can yeet Hatchets at the rescuer
---
I do this too! 
---
you're a saint
---
This is a great post. 
---
Not sure if the mods can pin this to the top for a while.
---
It feels like there should be more
---
B O I ever try double shadow dance bamboozle brutal strength fire up wraith? You feel like a GOD. Is it viable? Nope. Is it fun, YES
---
Idk man three characters, a killer and nine perks doesn't sound like a ripoff
---
I'm on PC and it has nothing to do with my headphones. Everything else will be normal but for the hatch sound.
---
And from what you're saying about 2 gens needing to be done I guess you haven't played in the last 2 years, so no wonder you had no bugs :p
---
Right now the hatch will spawn for the last Survivor no matter what, and it just so happens that I regularly am that person. Adrenaline doesn't do anything in situations where I'm trying to get to the hatch.
---
Ikr, im on ps4 so i cant thank them. üò≠
---
i'd actually go for Plague. Most people say clown or nurse but Plague has pretty good perks imo.
---
I currently play Huntress with 4 detection perks.
---
BBQ, Nurses Calling, Whispers and Discordance
---
I wanted to ask if this is any good
---
Also, I know that Ruin would be good, I just personally don't like running it
---
there is no gonna be new map chapter 14th tho:(
---
even 1 $ for those bhvr scummers is a ripoff
---
Pools closed.
---
So my grammar in this is wrong
---
Nah 100% per gen would be better
---
cry little baby
---
I haven't seen the l√∂√∂ps meme in months and honestly I miss it.
---
Rip, never getting that one.
---
Very good perk build I think
---
This is on PS4, btw: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/grid/search-game/1?query=dead%20by%20daylight
---
My wife showed me this a bit back and I freaking love it
---
How can reality be disappointing if it can be whatever I want it to be?
---
Nea actually looks like Nea here, that's nice.
---
Great art! Dirt and blood on charactes was a great extra detail, great job!
---
I'd rather him have the basement than throwing hatchets and missing, forcing him to waste time to refill. Anyone with a brain can deduce that, but you say "yeet" so I already expect a low iq.
---
PS4 - I reuploaded a screenshot w/prices, btw
---
Even though there is basically no gen slowdown?

Iron maiden, bbq, PGTW(or Ruin), and any detection perk. Whispers has worked well for me on her, i mostly use nurses calling though. Ive gotten alot of downs on survivors that i would have never seen if it werent for their aura
---
Commenting to find out, I dont know about whether or not this is true, but I definitely want to know
---
Plunderer + Left Behind will be a sneaky one (I get a key almost always with Plunderer)
---
Reminds me of Tru3 talking about how in drawings Nea didn't looked like... Nea.
---
My whole beef is they already have a clown, but I've always wanted a more maniacle cackle so if they got pennywise id probably play him more just for his laugh
---
Probably to help stop censoring, as well as what the user above said
---
Oops! Forgot to log out before screenshotting. Here's a better list: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5hnlj/all_dlc_is_now_discounted_best_time_to_snag/
---
I love how Nea is more menacing than ghostface
---
DS is Decisive Strike a Laurie Strode perk. After being unhooked you have 60 seconds where if the killer picks you up onto their shoulder, you get a skill check and can escape. It's very meta.
---
Flashlight blinds require precise timing whilst the killer is locked in animation (picking up survivors/breaking pallets). If the killer is free to move they can just look up or down and avoid the flashlight whilst still moving forward. It's not impossible to blind a killer who's not stuck in animation, but that's entirely dependant on the killer's skill and is not a guarantee.
---
Watch some YouTube videos on flashlight timing to learn how to flashlight save your teammates.
---
&gt;it's part of the game
---
Wow, good observation there!
---
1080 most likely
---
Left for deads even harder now imo because killers can shut the hatch, i got the achievement by doing the last gen instead of joining a billy for a hatch stand off
---
Haha nea is a killer guys!!!!!! Haha!!!!
---
Bill for BT :)
---
SWF is not inherently toxic
---
5. posts. below.
---
Any player that hasn‚Äôt gotten hit or hit too much can just tell his team when he hears the heartbeat
---
never even seen drake and josh but this is amazing
---
the first perk is basically babysitter the second is basically if wglf was worth using to me the last one seems pretty good might be useful for when you want to waste brown toolboxes
---
Ah, Rosie. I like this Pig.
---
Yeah bit of a dick move in my opinion
---
Sloppy Boogers?
---
It can be used, sure, but it sounds like something that's very build/playstyle dependent purely because there's so many better perks out there for her.
---
For me, vomit is kind of like Pig's traps - I vomit on the survivor, if they're close then I down them and if they're too far to chase then I'm off looking for another survivor to vomit on. I can't really think of a situation where I'm chasing someone injured, but not infected - or at least I can't think of a situation like that but that also doesn't involve me spraying Corrupt Purge like a firehose. At any rate, I could never get *any* benefit from Stridor, and I'm not sure what you'd have to run in order to get even a little benefit.
---
Why are you doing this.
---
You don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
If you complete 3 gens the perk becomes useless. The hatch spawns and you can find it before you‚Äôre the last one left. 
---
If your team gets DESTROYED and you have 3 gens left while the last survivor other than you died on the hook then it is the literal only time this perk is remotely useable. Still better to aim for completing 3 gens, finding the hatch while it‚Äôs closed, escape through it or use that knowledge of where it is to decide if going for a door is the smarter bet. 
---
I played to rank 1 on both sides last season but thanks I know they give the hatch to literally anyone now with end game collapse. Adrenaline saves your ass if your slugged and the killer closes the hatch, if you‚Äôre injured and the killer knows where the hatch is on final sacrifice, and every other in general situation that adrenaline is helpful for you to avoid death while being chased in the end. This perk is aura reading for a hatch that you can hear anyways. I don‚Äôt know why your audios bugged again I‚Äôve never had this issue do you have a video example?
---
I have a perk For every situation. Being left behind is one of them.
---
Is it like this on the Xbox Store?
---
TBH because of the rank update glitch I am forever a baby Dwight
---
*sad trevor noises*
---
lmao they must be new
---
No way dude!!!!!!!
---
Explain THAT
---
I would assume its slightly over the proce of the 10‚Ç¨pack so you have to use cells for 15‚Ç¨ instead.
---
&gt;throwing Hatchets and missing
---
Well how is he ever going to get better if you tell him never to try in the first place?
---
&gt;I already expect a low IQ
---
Says the one resorting to personal attacks when talking about a game. What are you, 14?
---
In 30 minutes
---
Oh for fuck's sake
---
Oh God oh fuck
---
If you know what you're doing, and use whispers to find someone very early you should be okay. Although using pop or ruin in place of discordance works well too.
---
Ya have any B E A N S?
---
Oinky-Chan‚Äôs are the best! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
BBQ works better than deerstalker though as long as the 2nd survivor you down is hooked far enough away to trigger BBQ.
---
Oh yeah sure, I do so enjoy running by the hatch hidden behind a wall and heard by everyone but me just so people can question me in chat afterwards. It's lovely just waving that escape goodbye as you pass it. Makes so much sense.
---
Use your brain please instead of talking trash for no reason. Whatever would I gain from lying about this, huh?
---
Also another person assuming genders. I love it how so many are unable to just use neutral pronouns. Really shows how big your horizon is.
---
Perk is built around being able to suppress the pain you're feeling 
---
No grunts of pain would make sense

i don t mind the grind again , but i really wish i kept my  esclusives

Only Game Pass at the moment: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search/shop/games?q=dead+by+daylight
---
My mouth indeed does produce more saliva than it should. Goddamn you guys have good ears.
---
Nurse is probably the only killer that could be perkless and still be a threat against evenly skilled Survivors. The only other killer who could stand a chance really is Spirit.
---
i'm hoping more along the lines of 20mins
---
omg ur so funy.
---
I thought about making this exact same post, no joke. Then I looked in the mirror and saw I WASN'T a huge turd *dabs*
---
I always do this whenever more than 1 survivor DC and there're 2 or less left. I've had tons of games as survivors where my teammates DC as soon as they got the killer they hate (i assume, i don't know why they'd quit so early in the game actually), that's why whenever i see survivors DC as a killer, I'll just farm with the remaining 1 to 2.
---
Bye bye key!
---
4PM
---
There will be no map in the chapter in question.
---
Pretty sure you will still have to invite for every game. I believe the new party system is tied to the dedicated servers, which were postponed. So neither will be with this update. Someone else can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong though.
---
Looks to be NA only for the moment.

They changed it to 25 or 20 on Xbox. I‚Äôd have to check the exact number, but they did lower it by a lot

What's your time zone
---
I hate to do that but i downed vote üò¢
---
Noice
---
The killer would still know you had it the moment the match started seeing as you are injured, or even if that was hidden, the moment you went down in one hit.
---
The perk is shitty and so are all of the injured based perks (minus dead hard/iron will, dead hard top tier &lt;3)
---
Resilience is the perk you are talking about at max rank it shaves 6.3 seconds off of a generator, you get that time in the time it takes a killer to wipe their weapon and catch back up easily, plus you have the chance to extend that time or escape the chase, you are honestly better off just running toolbox if you want repair speed.
---
Dead hard is easily the worst perk in the game
---
Its really cool that if u look at the Lobby Ping and it stays GREEN the whole time but when the game is about to start it changes to YELLOW or even RED and u can't leave anymore. Or when the Ping was GREEN the whole time and all of a sudden when its not going well for the killer it starts lagging , where u run on the same place. Had it Multiple times yesterday and im playing with a friend its just not fun aswell. So i don't blame the people that DC , if they DC because of Killers hmm yeah maybe but i think people take the game WAY to serious and care WAY to much about there RANK. When i play killer and i see someone DC i try to hook everyone a couple of times and let one escape through the Hatch. But at somepoint some people don't get it and i just kill them and they gonna be toxic but i don't really care. A few days ago a friend watched me play killer over Steam and i had 2 rounds where someone DC'd 1 game took me 13 min that could have ended after 4-5. The next game i just threw the remaining survs on hooks and let the round end because i want to actually play and not play "good killer" every damn game (even tho i'd like to).
---
Around 150 hours on pc plus I think around 50-100 more on Xbox. That‚Äôs until I hit rank 1 for the first time.
---
Couldve just said u dont know
---
Must have a lotta bad days
---
Thanks for the information
---
But the sequel is pretty meh, and that's what's coming out.  Jack Torrence would just be a regular guy with an axe too...kind of out of place with the others who are all more monstrous.  Overlook Hotel would be a sweet map though
---
It only make a sound when it's open, right?
---
That was super cool of you to let the Dwight have a good game despite DCs. I am never upset with a killer who hooks me immediately regardless of shitty DCs (sometimes you just want to move on to a better match) but it's great to show fun and compassion in a game where the whole theme is brutal murder.
---
They said killer + survivor, no map.
---
It's been happening with me
---
i love this episode
---
That's so wholesome.
---
*cries in ghostface*
---
It's extremely risky because you're taking a tracking perk, Discordancem, over any gen regression perk.
---
I understand the logic behind Discordance (finding survivors that are likely to double up on gens), but the problem is that you'll simply scatter them instead. Four scattered survivors is not something you want to deal with if you don't have a method of *effectively* regressing generators, and *especially* when you're as slow as Huntress.
---
I'd sooner take Pop Goes the Weasel, which is inferior to Ruin but will last all game and could be considered "more sporting" - no hooks means no Pop.
---
Remining three perks are solid, no reason not to be running them.
---
I was just playing a ghosface game and the dude dc'd instantly when I exposed and downed him very early game. Not cool, and it screws over me and your teammates.
---
and to think it used to the opposite.
---
BHVR really just can‚Äôt get this right
---
Dwight. Bond, Prove Thyself, and Leader are all *okay* perks that boost teamplay, and as a solo survivor that's normally what gets my team killed. 
---
Meg has good perks as well, Adrenaline being the absolute best "endgame" oriented perk for survivors, Sprint Burst being a decent exhaustion perk, and Quick and Quiet having a few circumstances where it's useful. 
---
Nancy looks like she'll have some decent perks too. Heals in exchange for totems from Inner Strength, a perk that encourages spending time on gens (Better Together), and a decent (not *great)* stealth perk (Fixated).
---
Looks like a BP farm build
---
We don‚Äôt speak of trash here.
---
Most of the time People use this as a Toxic way to say "YES F U I GOT U". Im not a huge fan of this tbh but at the same i dont care.
---
When you judge people so hard it makes you cringe
---
It does actually help hear sick survivors. The streamer Puppers showed this on his stream yesterday.
---
If BHVR puts dedicated servers in their game before Nintendo puts it into any of theirs I will lol
---
Poor Bill mixing his medication up.
---
Yessss
---
No you didn‚Äôt
---
My dude... lots of things are 'unfair'; it's called an 'asymmetrical horror game' for a reason; it's not supposed to be fair, nobody is supposed to be balanced. If that's what you're looking for, go back to CoD.
---
That being said... Spirit is easy to outmaneuver if you know what you're doing. When she's jumping all over the place, she cant' see survivors, just their red marks. So if you hear her coming, start running one way, then stop and walk back the opposite direction.
---
Everybody in this game has some sort of counter, a playstyle needed to go up against. For example, Urban Evasion, and creeping around the entire map makes Hag mostly useless, as does anybody with a flashlight. The 'I See You Build' (Spine Chill, Alert, Premonition, Small Game) make it impossible for Ghost Face, Piggy, or Myers to do their thing. Any combination of Dead Hard and Decisive Strike makes life difficult for any killer, especially when mixed in with things like Adrenaline or Sprint Burst, makes you too much of a pain in the ass for the killer to deal with unless forced to. 
---
That's the thing about asymmetrical games; you have to change up your playstyle; there's no one guaranteed 'meta' build because your opponents and teammates are constantly changing. The maps are constantly changing. And you never know what you're going to get when you go in.
---
But, conversely... neither does the killer. Do you know how frustrating it is to play Nurse against a SWF, where they all have Iron Will, DS, and Dead Hard, on Coldwind Farm?
---
Or how irritating it is to play Hag on Coldwind Farm, where you lose because you can't see above the goddamn corn because you were apparently some sort of ***freaking midget*** in real life?
---
Ahem, anyways... the point I'm making is that games like this are meant to give you a new, or different, experience every time you play. All you can do is learn to get the basics down, then learn the specifics about each killer. You might not be able to create a 'ultimate killer build' to go up against them every time, but just the simple things are pretty helpful.
---
And then head on in to the bedroom?
---
Now stop asking about it

Alright, thanks. I thought Discordance would be good to get some sneaky hatchets on people, but the only times it ever works anyway is when you're playing on Coldwind Farm.
---
Thanks for the help though, I appreciate it :)
---
It‚Äôs not out anywhere yet. Soon though.
---
Here ya go fam.
---
Also why did I get downvoted? No one likes homo jokes around here?
---
Something seems off here -_- (Happy Cake Day)
---
Clearly
---
Monstrous Shrine is the worst killer perk in the game right now, very situational to trigger and almost worthless when triggered. Best switch to something else.
---
Don't you have some other thread to go beg for downvotes in? See ya
---
imagine brutal strenght with demo... now that wouldnt be an epic gamer move
---
There's literally at least 5 posts with a screenshot from BHVR about it, right before yours
---
It‚Äôs clearly a joke
---
Wtf really?
---
Why is it impossible to start a match as Killer? Usually if I play survivor I find a match in like under 2 minutes, but when I want to play killer it takes forever and I just give up
---
Sounds dull.
---
Thanks you. But it's crazy how you never understand what they mean to say with their time zone.
---
Eh. My point stands so what I said was fairly clear the perk doesn‚Äôt have uses unless your team all died before a 3rd gen finished. Or in your case where your audio is messed up. Aside from that people who are familiar with hatch spawn locations or people with good headphones or good teams won‚Äôt ever need this perk. SWF 100% would never need this. And as a solo player aren‚Äôt things like Self care, Bond, Borrowed time, Adrenaline worth a slot more?
---
Pretty sure it wouldn't effect the Shred as they're two completely different actions
---
Can't really remember who it was. Thanks fir reminding me, that explains why I can't find the video
---
Its a well known Latin phrase, "don't forget death" or "remember you are mortal" or something
---
Omfg WHERE TF IS THE UPDATE
---
I was JUST thinking of making something like this. You beat me to it. Well done.
---
It'll probably be changed once the hotfix goes up and it becomes base
---
If you just want more information then Surveillance would at least have a good chance of being active when you're hemmed into your 3-gen. 
---
That said, you'd need to be an exceptional Huntress in order to pressure high rank survivors hard enough that they don't have time for gens (thus removing the need for a regression perk).
---
Maybe have a watch of ScottJund's [Huntress guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io), if you haven't seen it already - would have some insight on potential perk choices that perhaps you haven't considered.
---
1PM
---
Is the dedicated servers in this patch for all platforms?
---
The update yeah, but the DLC not till 12
---
Invite for Carrie or Johnny!
---
&gt; Added 2 new score events when escaping and dying as the Obsession in the Survival category. 
---
I like this a lot since being the obsession can be potentially awful.
---
&gt; Added a debuff icon, similar to The Trappers Honing Stone add-on, when affected by The Nightmare's Red Paint Brush, Swing Chains, Jump Rope and Outdoor Rope add-ons. 
---
Interesting how they didn't include the black box. I feel like that's Freddy's most obnoxious addon to be on the receiving end of.
---
Oh shit, they changed Dying Light from tunnel simulator to something good.
---
If I get baby survs I try and give them a chance and if they are really struggling I‚Äôll send them a message saying ‚Äúhey man I‚Äôm friendly just get the gen done‚Äù and let them get hatch can‚Äôt be so harsh so early
---
‚ÄòCuz the update is Extraterrestrial! I have no clue either haha
---
Just a little off, and thank you!
---
For me, that's a buff that outweighs the nerfs he has gotten
---
yea ik
---
The lore (which isn't much at the moment) says that Freddy's powers are "tempered," which makes me think that even he is less powerful than the Entity. But then it also mentions that there's new prey, which kinda implies that Freddy doesn't really care that he's working for the Entity as long as he has shit to kill.
---
Yeah, those "Nike Mike" builds are no joke.
---
check the new post on official forums
---
I was just calling you a hero don't gotta be rude
---
No, they say things like, 'haha, ez game!' at rank 1, when they wipe the floor with my rank 13 killer.
---
They teabag at each and every possible opportunity, then screech about toxicity when you don't allow them hatch.
---
Their brand of delusion is, 'well, I didn't teabag you, so you have to let me escape!'
---
Seriously dude, I play both sides, and survivors are the first to start spazzing out in the chat about toxicity because a killer wouldn't let them do a thing, or ripping into a killer 10+ levels below them for being 'shit, uninstall loser!'
---
Obviously I'm not saying that the killers who get stupid, and start bitching are right either; but to say that it's all killers who want stupid stuff, and are delusional just shows your bias, mate.
---
Toxic, stupid people are toxic and stupid. Which side they're playing for doesn't really matter.
---
I know just thought it was cool
---
I have never understood what drives some people to DC.. I saw a person use one of the extra BP offerings the other day, took one hit.. and DC'd.. I've had games where I Literally turn a corner and the killer is on my ass, I refuse to DC.
---
Brace for more posts like this
---
I doubt for a second his ability will be shape shifting, maybe a mori could implement that.
---
I hope and assume it could have the same kinda functionality as the nurse - He could do that absurd running in a straight line thing,  like he did in IT coming out of the water, pretty sure he‚Äôs done that several times... proper jump scare material that.  Only issue with that is that we have a lot of obstacles that would break that ability.  But hey, it‚Äôs DbD.  
---
I‚Äôm saying it now, if it‚Äôs anyone, it‚Äôll be Pennywise.  Nothing shining related.
---
Eh I believe it's only a second faster then breaking a pallet regularly or just about the same as with brutal strength so it isn that big of a deal
---

Asymmetrical literally means the game isn't balanced; it's not meant to be fair. Certain killers will always be better, certain perks will be better, certain maps will be better... The point is to have a different game experience every time you play.

PS4 nurse intensifies
---
Should be available everywhere. Although the DLC will come in a hour.
---
Honestly this would be better if you took away ruin and ds. Ruin is annoying but mostly necessary and ds is anti tunnel, except sometimes
---
You need four times as many survivor players per match to start a game. What makes this even worse is that more people want to play killer than survivor because, thematically, killers always win.
---
What the actual fuck? He is already strong enough why did they have to buff him even more?
---
I barely ever bother vaulting through windows now.
---
I agree it's a little weird. Blinks, ambush, and legion vaulting doesn't break pallets by default (just random examples). But it's an inhuman beast and being stopped by a piece of wood definitely takes away that feeling. It'll feel better as killer, and help some of those loops where pounce wasn't helping otherwise.
---
good one
---
Currently not like this on Steam, but console players please enjoy!
---
1.2gb
---
Update is confirmed live. 1.2 GB
---
Yes, on XBOX. And that took years
---
I think there needs to be a function to stop unhooks. I hate when someone with little to no strategy comes and unhooks you when the killer is chasing them or right next to the hook. Idk if people do it to save themselves mid chase or because they are a dumbass but similar to how heals can be canceled unhooks should be able to be canceled as well.
---
That was the insidious Bubba.
---
His ability doesn't need to charge like a chainsaw. It can be very useful for catching up to survivors, and if it works like the chainsaw (in the sense that when he destroys a pallet while a surv is vaulting, they'll get hurt), there's not really a reason to destroy pallets out of chase, cause it'll be so quick mid chase and can help you catch up. I feel like that's a really nice buff.

Log in now to download the update before the dlc drops. Not sure of the size, but it usually takes a while on my connection.
---
So what will the ultra rare add-on do instead?
---
Can confirm there‚Äôs no update on PS4 (Netherlands) yet.
---
Technically Ghostface was a unique character to BHVR since it wasn‚Äôt from the Scream movies, it was just the mask that was licensed.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure ET EST is the same thing, I‚Äôm not in that timezone so I‚Äôm not entirely sure. Was just saying when the content was releasing
---
I just bought Ghost face too smh
---
Remember that you have to die
---
Say a killer is proxy camping, if you unhook the survivor within the heartbeat it gives the survivor one free hit if the killer tunnels them, however it will put them in the mend state where if they don‚Äôt mend within a set amount of time they down anyways. It‚Äôs a great perk for beginners and survive with friends (:
---
At first I was a little irked that they already nerfed Demo (albeit slightly), but the ability to break pallets with shred by default now is great and makes up for the slightly longer cooldown. Also makes him somewhat less susceptible to looping which was one of his issues from the PTB.
---
Yeah I do also but it isn't confirmed plus the demogorgon did get a decent amount of nerfs making up for it and you still get stunned making it a equalizer IMO
---
K thanks
---
Same in Australia
---
The game is hot trash, bug the best thing we got
---
You will still get the bonuses until, and up to, the game ends. You literally said 'when people leave during the load screen'.
---
Unless you're the one who leaves during the loading, you retain your stuff, period. If some of your teammates leave, you still get whatever bonuses you'd get from your offerings or what not. Obviously you're the only one who can leave on killer side if you're the killer, so that's a redundant argument...
---
Like seriously, either you left and lost your offerings, or somebody else did, and you either keep the offering, or keep the bonus. What are you bitching about?
---

---
Yep I do feel it makes the shred a little better but it ain't confirmed more so it could get in the game or just not
---
I believe it's the same. You can only start the infection, not progress it (probably because this is considered a bit too strong, given how easily you can fully infect/break a stationary target)
---
We don't have a post game chat so yeah
---
Update available on Xbox
---
Nope, it just means you're unlucky.
---
This should change with the new improved Bloodweb, out today, since you'll have twice as many chances at a perk.
---
Technically yes, but still. He is basically discount Myers. I mean sure, he‚Äôs better in my opinion, but he still doesn‚Äôt give that effect of ‚Äúoh there such a cool character! I can just imagine them having an actual movie!‚Äù Ya know?
---
Redtart is your ps4 if you need. Thats how i got it to go for me.
---
The stun isn't that bad, I will happily deal with it. I feel like youll be able to play him more aggressively

I know it's not going to be live yet, BUT...

The number of people in these comments that can't tell this is obviously a joke post makes me sad.
---
But we do already have 2 chainsawing hillbillies. I think Pennywise could be different enough to be included. Yeah, it would be "another clown killer" but that's only looks. Pennywise wouldn't be throwing bottles of noxious gas at survivors. It wouldn't be like Leatherface where he's very similar with slight changes.
---
An unfortunate combination of rank reset and the new update. Rank reset always muddies the queues, and the new update usually has people playing killer more due to the belief that killers have an easier time farming Bloodpoints.
---
Oh well, I heard that the actual content doesnt release for another hour so we have time
---
Why can't i get pigs like you
---
Your girlfriend clearly doesn't know the game vety well then - She drew two killers!
---
Yeah definitely but I don't think this change boosts him to high tier as the lunge is still really easy to counter and the portals are effective for camping now making them pretty mediorce. We just gotta wait and see though
---
So they go totally mute after like 4 hits, or is there a timer that refreshes with each stack?
---
Or does it not stack, but not expire?
---
Listen sir. Idc what your games are like. Git gud.
---
Without perks, the only differences are cosmetic.
---
And if survivors find you they start throwing.
---
I've never actually used NOED, or seen it used in one of my games, so I can't speak for that.
---
But I will say, Ruin isn't any sort of crutch lol. A good team can power through even with Ruin; it slows you down, and -on the bigger maps -is necessary to not lose the game in under five minutes. It doesn't alert the killer to where you are, it simply gives you a slight regression to your progress if you don't nail that 'great check'.
---
That being said... It seems like every time a killer runs ruin, every survivor feels the need to run around the map in chaotic circles looking for the totem, until the killer grabs each of them one by one, with a single generator being 4% done. Which is annoying, to be sure. It's more effective at making the survivors run around like idiots than it is gen stopping, in my opinion.
---
One more hour
---
Its already out on xbox
---
&gt;Reworked the audio on Nancy and Steve.
---
Please God, I hope they changed Steve's terrible hook scream.
---
Out in UK
---
1 hour, the update is out now for consoles.
---
Maybe when you're having a bad day you should just play a different game where DCing doesn't screw up the experience for 4 other people.
---
Not nearly as much. Pig can get away with not using Ruin a lot better then Wraith, Trapper, Leatherface, Myers, ect.
---
r/DBDLFG
---
we dont know
---
I got lucky and was able to get it a week before endgame collapse started.  I was able to kill 3 of them before they finished two gens. Since there was no hatch spawned I let the final survival break free and hit the gen telling them to work on it. After the grab I let her escape and finish for the hatch to spawn and escape as a reward.
---
idk, but it makes more sense
---
Thanks :)
---
Useless fucking pieces of shit: you get agitated at others failures, each time a survivor fails a skill check you gain a token, up to 3. When hit with a pallet you destroy that pallet,  uses one token
---
yee
---
Like 40 minutes
---
Unrelenting is a crutch. That's all I learned lol. Everyone misses attacks, it's part of the game. Also a decent counter to dead hard aswell. I'm sorry I bruised your ego.
---
He means the content
---
You're a third rate survivor with a fourth rate perk build!!!
---
At least this keeps the demogorgon high-tier.
---
Because he's not that much of a threat. I feel like even Legion is more dangerous and annoying in the mid ranks.
---
I'm high rank.
---
Not just altruism, killers get BBQ stacks by doing their main objective, which is gens for survivors. Still, I think they should add an actual gameplay benefit to wglf rather than make it easier to get stacks
---
I‚Äôm in US
---
THEY had a cosmic turtle helping them!
---
Thank you!
---
Pig is one of the only killers you can have fun with.
---
How many auric cells is it? I'm away from my console and it's not listed on the playstation store
---
Idk what weird powers they could give him. Maybe the ability to destroy windows so he can walk through them (Like how he chopped the door down in the shining). Jack would be cool to see, but unless they just want to make him a m1 killer, he's gonna have weird supernatural abilities because he is just a man with an axe really.
---
Pennywise could probably be anything, and being on the opposite end of the spectrum, being too OP to portray accurately.
---
Why are they booing you? Did that not happen?
---
What time does the update release?
---
Gender specific wake up animations in 2019 lmao.
---
If demo gets this for pounce
---
Legion needs to get it for vaulting
---
Yes no thanks that's a little to powerful. Especially if it would stack like you suggested. If you aren't running sprint burst you would not have time to move to a pallet or window once you heard the heartbeat. It would make spine chill even more prevalent in games then it already is.
---
Second part coming soon
---
That's what I thought, but never tried playing without perks to find out.
---
Blood in your Mouth?
---
Neah. Urban Evasion is massive with how I operate. Has saved me many a time when a killer was going over where I was with a fine tooth comb, and I could dart over to where they looked to keep hiding.
---
For killer, tough choice. Probably Billy, because Enduring is one of my must haves, and his power is pretty good.
---
Right, so a lot of these comments saying just beat the shit out of the pig or legion are sorta wrong lmao
---
Yeah, can't say I approve of his power being stalking when the whole gimmick of the Scream movies was there being two Ghostfaces.
---
Nea seems to have taken lessons from Leatherface
---
Well I feel we should wait before calling the demogorgon high tier since everything else got nerfed meaning it's meant to balance out the fact you can use shred to break pallets.
---
I like the license chapters. They're all cool and bring in new players, but yeah I'm ready for a new original chapter after Stranger Things. I wouldn't think they'd do 3 license chapters in a row, but who knows.
---
Should be 500 per character, I believe 12 euros for the full dlc? Not sure though.
---
Keep in mind the DLC isn‚Äôt released yet. The update is available. DLC will come in about 45 minutes
---
dont ask that to me, do it to devs LOL
---
Demo is still not even close to being as good as Billy. Demo's map pressure can literally be destroyed and even with pallet breaking and the lunge, neither of those rivals Billy's insane map pressure+one hit down.
---
Wake Up? More like Woke Up
---
I've given up on "helping" survivors. I've done it a few times and they've just mocked me.
---
I've even led someone to the hatch that was open before and rather than leave they stood there teabagging for two minutes. So i downed them and put them on the hook to end the match.
---
He was already 5th or 6th, the pallet breaking addon being added to base kit is BS imo, ot needed he was good enough already and the cooldown they added to him is basically useless. I would've liked to see him have a cooldown for faking his power like Huntress has when she puts her hatchet away, would promote more skillful gameplay and less just me see me hit mentality
---
Butchy Slopper
---
Sloppy Butcher
---
I think they were pushed to do it
---
&gt; *Am I right to assume this game is much more survivor based?*
---
In the sense that you need 4 survivors for every game, perhaps. Survivors *generally* have an easier time than killer (you're only interacting 1/4 of the time, after all) but when the killer is chasing then things become complicated quite quickly. Killer is *generally* a more stressful experience, and there aren't many "general" killer problems - they're usually very specific to a certain killer, which is an issue survivors will never have.
---
&gt; *I know I should just play how I want, but what are things to avoid doing while being killer?*

***Don't be a dick.*** That's about it, it'll cover everything.

---
Ah yes, the clickbait red circle
---
No! Don‚Äôt prestige until you would like to, or have enough bloodpoints to get you back! You‚Äôre just getting very unlucky with the blood web, I probably went through 7 level 50 webs before I got any new perks or any perks I wanted. Just keep trying (:
---
I feel like actual hitbox matching would create some trick where Feng can crouch at key points and be intangible, just because of how this game works.
---
Run it's the entity!

Not all heros wear capes. Some wear pig masks
---
I was red rank before reset now i cant get out of the low ranks due to the way the newer players play
---
Great, thanks!
---
I believe match making is bugged right now
---
Don't flatter yourself
---
It makes sense for an inter-dimensional monster to be able to shred through a bit of wood -- not some punk ass kid.
---
I can't believe they ripped off Dead by Daylight's generators and made them into a backup power source.
---
The game is somewhat Survivor biased, but mainly because there are 4 of them and only 1 of you. If a single Survivor makes a mistake, they have their 3 teammates to fall back on. If you make a mistake as a Killer, there is no "safety net." This is just kind of the way asymmetrical games work in general, especially ones with solo players. There is always the "power role" aka the role that has the "power" to, in DbD's case, kill the Survivors, and then there is the "numbers" role, aka the role that has more people and therefore has teammates to prop them up if they make a mistake/play poorly.
---
As far as one of the most basic things you should avoid doing as the Killer: try as hard as you can to make sure you are doing something productive during every second of a match, and avoid having any 'downtime'. This means you want to be chasing, injuring, downing, hooking, etc Survivors as much as you can. You don't want to be spending time idle or not in a chase, since this is free time for Survivors to work on Generators. You need to pressure them off of Generators as much as you can. This is why a lot of Killers will run tracking perks (so they can find Survivors ASAP) and anti-looping perks (so they can chew through loops faster) and pressure the Survivors to keep them off of Generators. 
---
Every Survivor you have injured is one that either needs to waste time healing themselves, or waste time getting healed by another Survivor, every Survivor you have hooked is one that needs a teammate to stop working on Generators to come unhook them, etc. I'm sure you get the idea. You basically just want to be 'in the action' as much as you possibly can, any way that you can.
---
A really basic mistake that a lot of newer Killers make is kicking Generators when they come upon a Survivor or two working on one. Don't waste the 2 seconds it takes to kick the Generator to regress it, you're much better off chasing a Survivor and trying to down them. Generators only regress at 0.25 charges/second, while Survivors are able to apply 1 charge/second when working on them, meaning that kicking Generators isn't really worth it unless you're really desperate or know that no one is nearby to stop the regression.
---
Why do I get all the serious killers that still try to kill you after everyone else disconnects? I get that it‚Äôs not the killer‚Äôs fault that everyone left, but still.
---
Maturing new survivor confirmed.
---
You know what DCing makes you?
---
A dick.

That last line makes me hate this perk. It helps camping and tunneling. Which this game doesn't need more of.
---
-Cutest killer
---
-Can crouch
---
-Can oink

All pluses for Pig mains like myself.
---
The new lvl 50 blood web?
---
That'd be nice.
---
Is there a free weekend for this game on ps4
---
That‚Äôs gonna actually be pretty useful. Especially if you just want hatch, running Open Handed would help as(if it‚Äôs the perk i remember and it‚Äôs not a different one) it increases aura reading range.

Both are myth. Spirit doesn‚Äôt suffer Light Burn and you can blind the Husk like normal

I'm mentioning it as an indication of time played. I meant to imply that existing players that have that level of experience shouldn't de rank below 15, ever. That should be reserved for actual new players.

u can get a better shot if u turn the camera more into the lever. makes for a good profile pic

To be clear, from L40 you'll see 3 perks has the potential to claim up to 2. From L50 you'll see 4, but still only be able to claim up to 2.

Ruin is pretty mandatory on slower killers who can't make it to the other side of the bigger maps before the first gen pops.

Pretty sure at max stats it's way worse than previous dying light, but also doesn't require a mori and a little luck to make work. It's a permanent debuff though. Definitely going to be annoying as survivor.
---
That's great to hear!
---
I was always tempted to buy the game but kept hearing how "toxic" the community is. After watching a few streamers play I wasn't seeing this toxicity, so I took the dive.
---
Just imagine trapper going full Seto Kaiba on us,
---
‚ÄúShut up crapper‚Äù
---
Lmao no its not
---
Start with the free and the ones you buy with the shards or whatever they are called ones, they are really good.  you don't really need the others to begin.  then as you play you'll understand better how the characters you can't play as are like, what is your playstyle like, and what styles you'd like try and that will make you have a better choice.
---
That Ash one is sexy af
---
These players with 1000s of hours in the game are always super defensive of the meta as they don't want anything to change
---
I thought Nurse‚Äôs didn‚Äôt work with mending? Either way, that build sounds great, especially with his pin.
---
I'm sorry, the correct answer is, "Uninstall the game noob, you don't deserve to play.. so bad, get gud."
---
That's basically the message I got from playing my level 8 wrath at rank 15 to get a daily finished.  From someone I sacrificed successfully.
---
What did it do?
---
Why not just apply the Oblivious effect?
---
Psssh. Wraith, Myers, and Legion are my best killers. In fact, the other day playing legion I got three merciless in a row.
---
They should just give the name of the city related to that time zone to help us doing the conversion. 
---
'cause even if what you say is interesting, it's still chinese to me.
---
It‚Äôs a key add on that reveals the aura of the obsession
---
He is a newbie, chances are he will have problems following invisible survivors.
---
When can i buy the whole chapter in store? right now the price is "N/A" in store to me.
---
What combo?  You did one thing mate and it was the killers incompetence that made it work lol
---
You should try doing Microsoft Rewards, you can use the points to get xbox gift cards and then buy the DLC chapters.  It's really easy to earn enough points to do this since the DLCs are reasonably inexpensive, and having game pass will allow you to earn even more points than normal.
---
Look behind you more often so you know when they‚Äôre about to swing ! Also DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE FOR DBD HYYPPPEEEE
---
Ayyyyy this is so good! I love that you shaded under his eyes, pretty cool!
---
It will be replaced in the same hotfix.
---
The past DLC have usually arrived around 9AM-11AM Mountain time. Shouldn‚Äôt be too long now.
---
I felt pretty conflicted since they were absolutely fine in chat lol
---
The patch is available now, the DLC will be out around 12. For what‚Äôs it‚Äôs worth, the patch itself usually includes all the DLC, buying it will just unlock it. So you only have to worry about downloading the patch
---
Play with your Food, Bamboozle, Fire Up, pallet perk of your choice, an add-on for either infinite T3 or an extended T3, and the other add-on is generally one to get you into T3 faster.
---
It's pure meme.
---
This is axactly why survivors no matter what are the same hitbox. Survivor hit boxes are poles in the middle of their body that slighty surpass' the head of the tallest survivor.
---
you can unlock it with auric cells in the ingame store
---
Asserting dominance
---
There's one big problem with DS and it's that you can still get hit with it even after you've hooked a *different* survivor. If it were a true anti-tunnel perk, the 60 second timer would end as soon as the killer hooks a new survivor.
---
Just wait

That‚Äôs cause it isn‚Äôt fully out yet if you wait like 30 min then you can buy with money
---
Still nothing on the broken trophies/ achievements. Fix Wounded Healer and Medic!
---
It‚Äôs not out yet in the stores, it‚Äôs like this every chapter. Have to wait around 20-25 more minutes
---
Oh that‚Äôs beautiful
---
DLC will be in store in 25 minutes, just wait a little
---
I just want a code so that my brother doesn't have to pay for a DLC. Then we could do doubles as Steve/Nancy.
---
I typically buy with the cells myself but thats me
---
For the latter: It's a little bit different. One is telling you, "Hey, you're affected by this thing. You should do the thing to stop it." For the Black Box, it's more immediately apparent. You start asleep and there's no way to wake up. Telling people that they're affected by it doesn't do them any good since they can't get rid of it anyway.
---
Time to play basement bubba
---
Doc is so nasty with two calm addons
---
It should be available in ~20 or so minutes from now.
---
sorry for asking, but what did it used to do? only new to the game myself
---
Because it's impossible to derank after rank 15. Unless you're doing really bad, you will rank up from 20 in no time. For example - my friends who have bought the game recently are now rank 16-17 with around 5 hours of playing. It can go much faster the better you are though, of course. But considering new players will most likely have a difficult time ranking up, chances are it will take them a few hours to rank up. But once they do rank up, they can't rank back down.
---
they are in 4 mans cuz they dont wanna play with potatoes
---
I went against a spirt yesterday were i 4% off the hook and managed to pop the last gen and everyone popped right up mind u i solo que

They put a lot of effort into this chapter for sure lol

Detroit becomes human was an amazing award wining game ! Lol nice meme tho
---
It is a bit of a blur, myself, haha. Namely because of one scene that will not be named that I am pretty certain I have suppressed these days because I read it when I was too young for that kind of degeneracy.
---
It would make much, much more sense, but as you said, then the game would become licensed entirely, though I am sure Stephen King wouldn't care all that much.
---
To be honest, I stand what I say that seems to upset everyone: the entity just shouldn't exist and should be replaced with everything being a series of chaotic cosmic events tied to the Fog. Too many problems stems from them being this contrivance that effectively detracts and conflicts with so many of the different killers
---
Damn, they delayed the dedicated servers
---
More than likely, you'll see it used when a survivor drops a pallet as you're lunging towards them. Either you hit them (good for you) or the pallet breaks (also good for you). It's not as much about saving time as it is about letting you be a little more aggressive with it.
---
ppl like u r the reason i have faith in the game

Yeah never seen this happen.It's like it's a whole new game they added, but it's the same game, just ran out of room.

How many do they have? DBD has over 120 before the stranger things dlc

nobody runs any of those perks on Freddy anyway. If borrowed time no longer works this is a buff much more than a nerf

Jack would be cool but I feel like his character design is a bit boring

He‚Äôs at least at the top of mid teir. I mean, would you rather the clown or 28 stab wounds?
---
hahaha ;D
---
I got my friends to start playing a month ago, A and B. Well A loves playing the game is extremely altruistic and I am not, I am a gen jockey. B played the game and got rank 6 and his GF is rank 2 who is a big try hard. B‚Äôs Gf got mad that we weren‚Äôt taking the game super seriously as new players.
---
Like I said it‚Äôs been a month and now I‚Äôm the only one who just has fun. The other two just run around and get pissed about random things which makes the game not fun.
---
The last 4 years I feel has had a rise in competitive games and I think it feeds the sweaty mentality
---
It would be great if we could start custom games without needing a second player.
---
Wait... both are me
---
You either have to buy clown and level him up or otherwise hope it appears on the Shrine of Secrets where you can pick it up using iridescent shards
---
1000th upvote
---
Glad you're having a good time, watch a few Wraith videos on YT to help you perform even better on him :)
---
Can do, yes - but bear in mind that lone players do not represent the totality of the community, and vice versa.
---
The majority of players just want to play and have fun, but there's always that small element who can't function like other people, and therefore have to take that dysfunction out on whoever they encounter.
---
Whenever I see someone unhook right in front of me I mercilessly tunnel the unhooked person. Why? To deny the "Safe Unhook" score event and prevent WGLF stacks to the reckless losers.

And how nancy sounds like she is injured when she runs and is healthy

Plus you get extra content, the cosmetics are slightly different.

So how long till the dlc shows up in the psn store? I know its not there now but i cant find anywhere saying when it will be in the psn store...help?
---
Just make the number ridiculous like 8 hits or something. Force them to heal instead of being bad at the game.
---
Honestly give me a Killer Klown from outer space! Both creepy and comedic
---
Yes. 
---
If you wanna buy every character, get the whole chapter through the ps4/microsoft/steam store (cost less). If you want to buy only separate characters, buy them separately at a discount. If you decide to buy the other characters, you are paying more money. It's been this way since you could buy characters through the store (so since clown).
---
You didn‚Äôt do anything lol
---
The dlc is coming at 12pm est. Did you not read the billion posts about it?
---
Ehhhh... maybe mark spoilers? It‚Äôs fine on jojo subreddits but I‚Äôd hate to be mid part 3 browsing this sub and seeing this
---
7 more minutes.
---
Double up on the pallet perks then. You'll not miss Fire Up - it's reliant on you not protecting your gens, so it's only really of use on Nike Mike if you're going *full* meme.
---
Not available till 12 EST.
---
Update is 1 hour before content, if I read correctly
---
It's releasing in like 6 minutes.
---
Its good that it isnt a tunnel simulator anymore, but its completly trash.
---
Gotta wait for both console stores to update or pay with in-game currency.
---
I unlocked the characters via shards so maybe that's it.
---
My comment didn't have anything to do with the new map -- I was referring only to Demo and his ability to complete chases... But I agree that the new map has some issues, including some double pallet setups. Don't assume you're the only one who played the PTB an adequate amount of time.

You, Sir/Mam, are the real MVP! Thank you!
---
Ah okay I didn't know that lol. Thank you!
---
Ah, I see, so no better or worse than most online games at this point.
---
Aren't all the dlc's on sale on all platforms? On PS4 everything is 3.99 or less except the new one
---
Survivor good killer bad
---
Not to mention, insta down killers are just not fun for me. I main hag, wraith, and spirit for God's sake. At purple ranks. It's mostly lower ranks, or newer players complaining about the perk lineup for both sides. But, there is a list of perks that killers are "forbidden" to use, whereas survivors are allowed as much as they want. Both sides can be op, both sides can be garbage. Its down to the bare bones. Enjoy the damn game. If your not enjoying it, what's the point?
---
The hair is still the same on all the cosmetics, that head is just one cosmetic with different hair.
---
You missed the "behavioural" part. Don't go out of your way to teabag. Don't go out of your way to facecamp. Don't go out of your way to actively bm someone in post game chat
---
Why the cosmetics in DbD are so expensive? They are awesome and everything but come on.
---
Maybe click the link and read like everyone else.
---
wholesome
---
I don't see why anyone would buy it with cells. They miss put on bonus stuff with getting the dlc :p
---
So since Demogorgon can break pallets with their power and it makes them rewarded for being aggressive, can Legion break pallets while in frenzy as base too? With how lackluster their power and other addons are, requiring an UR to get this effect definitely feels bad since you will have to cancel frenzy for a 4 sec stun anyway.
---
It also might be the hit boxes on the killer's weapons as well
---
It's nice when this happens but I always feel pressure not to waste the killers time when they let me do gens, and the chase music going full blast doesn't help with that.
---
You can spend auric cells to get perks?
---
Probably assumed she was gonna jump back out real fast, that's my guess tho
---
Thank you very much! 
---
By the way, will there be any sale when the update hits the store? my friends are waiting for the sale to join in.
---
Check again in 4 minutes
---
They do tests periodically on the vanilla mode, which is perkless itemless, idk why it's not a mode
---
Every time I swear lol
---
Yesterday all 4 survivors were going to escape on me as the hag. They all waited at the door for me, but instead of trying to hit them, I started drawing traps on the ground outside the door. One survivor came out and let me teleport/hit twice and it got me my daily, so I let her crawl out. It was very wholesome :)

What in the fuck?
---
This happens every chapter fyi
---
I'm sorry to ask but is there like a release time for the new features for xbox?
---
Do this more lol
---
The one of the left is the default and the one on the right is her most recent purchasable one. I‚Äôm not comparing the two i‚Äôm showing how awful they both look now. Check yourself in game, they look like big clumps of noodles.
---
Damn, got the weird shit too, i spawned near killer, he gets me, some guy takes me off the hook, wild Wraith appears, surv blocked me from running i get downed and moried. The game lasts 20 seconds... 
---
I intentionally watched the rest of the match to see if the guy was teamed with killer, but it seems he's just special.
---
Im a new player, but some people just don't use their brain.
---
That‚Äôs what happens when licensed property comes to the game.
---
Huntress hatchet throw pallet break when?
---
Although the Medic trophy is also bugged (or so others tell me, I got the trophy long ago), and that trophy is in the base game. So it wouldn't make sense that it's DLC related.

Those aren't auric cells.

Wait, "community manager" is queen gone?
---
I'm sorry jon.... death is not an escape

Gross
---
What's wrong with Dwight's eyes
---
The hair optimization ruined a **lot** of hair styles, especially on low. I hope they revert it soon.
---
Well, yes but actually no since you cab buy shards with auric cells
---
Pretty sure it happened to everyone.
---
Not yet only for the US in the EU and elsewhere (can‚Äôt confirm completely) it‚Äôs not on sale yet same for Xbox. Glad I only bought two recently.
---
Hey would you be able to tell us if the Devs are aware of the issues with trophies/achievements like Wounded Healer and Medic not being awarded as they should?
---
I did look at them both. They look almost the same, but that's just me.
---
ive been using this jake hair for as long as i can remember and wow it looks horrible
---
Shit
---
I hope they will buff Fixated to work even when injured in a future update. Even Painreliever says that it's a huge nerf for the perk...
---
Yes they are not the same cosmetic, i‚Äôm referring to how bad the texture of her hair is now, on ALL her cosmetics.
---
Yeah when the other ones came out I was working the day it released so by the time I got home I guess it was able to be purchased. So I wasnt really aware that thats how it works. Thank you for letting me know ^-^
---
I want a 'good boy' or a Doge skin for Demogorgon
---
So they deliberately didn't put out the bundle to grab some extra cash from buying all 3 characters. Yet another money hungry company.
---
Because it‚Äôs easier to save up cells for me lol I have like 10k saved up
---
What did you expect playing on low?
---
All you get with the DLCs is a small discount and slight retextures of the defualt outfits.
---
12 EST
---
I'm sorry to ask but do we have liek a release date or time for if the stranger things dlc will be bundled or when it will be in the steam/xbox/playstation store?
---
Chasing a big booty Jane as GF when a baby Dwight turns a corner and runs smack into me.
---
Ngl it gave me a spook. I wasn't expecting someone to just come out of a corner like that
---
it looked great before, and dbd runs like garbage on anything ive tried to play it on
---
Comes out at 12pm Est. It's literally all over this sub.
---
Why would you ever slug three people at once? One or two when you spot the last is understandable. But Three?!
---
I‚Äôm seeing it too and I hate it. It doesn‚Äôt feel right..

#About This Game
---
_**Stranger Things**_ is a brand-new Chapter for Dead by Daylight. The
---
Stranger Things Chapter includes a new map, the Underground Complex, located
---
below the Hawkins National Laboratory. A Demogorgon is the new untamable
---
Killer. Against the Demogorgon stands not one, but two new Survivors: Nancy
---
Wheeler, a tough aspiring journalist, and Steve Harrington, a former high
---
school jock with a knack for finding trouble. The Stranger Things Chapter also
---
features two exclusive cosmetic items: Steve‚Äôs Scuffed Rolled Sleeves and
---
Nancy‚Äôs Torn Sweatshirt.  
---
It was the early 1980s, a time of cold war experiments and naive fascination,
---
a time of stranger things. In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, covert
---
experiments were being conducted. When an inter-dimensional gate was
---
accidentally opened at the Hawkins National Laboratory, an army of creatures
---
with long, curved claws and gaping faces that bloom like horrific flowers was
---
unleashed. These creatures were labeled ‚ÄúDemogorgons‚Äù by a group of local kids
---
who encountered them.  
---
Nancy Wheeler‚Äôs knack for investigative journalism first emerged when she
---
brought down a secret government organization in Hawkins following the
---
disappearance of her closest friend, Barb. Her being fired from the Hawkins
---
Post during the summer of 1985 has not dissuaded Nancy from chasing leads...  
---
Formerly a popular jock, Steve Harrington, is struggling to find his place in
---
Hawkins now that high school is over, and his old friends moved away to
---
college. Since then, he‚Äôs spent his time scooping ice cream at the mall,
---
flirting with girls, and cracking secret Russian codes. With the help of his
---
friends Dustin and Robin, Steve is carving out a new identity for himself and
---
learning what true friendship really means. It‚Äôs this newfound loyalty to his
---
friends that compels Steve to come to the aid of his ex-girlfriend, Nancy when
---
he suspects she might be in terrible danger...  
---
##  The Demogorgon
---
A blooming mouth full of needle-like teeth for a face, large, curved, razor-
---
sharp claws, and powerful legs to pounce on victims, make the Demogorgon a
---
frightening monster to face in any dimension. It is a nightmare of
---
unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces,
---
devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers.
---
The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint. Looming
---
over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure instinct of its
---
insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, the
---
Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down
---
and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.  
---
**The Demogorgon‚Äôs Power: Of the Abyss**  
---
The Demogorgon impacts the environment close to generators, affects nearby
---
Survivors, and uses Portals to travel quickly. The Demogorgon starts with a
---
limited number of Portals that can spawn on any flat floor or ground.  
---
The Demogorgon comes with **3 new perks.**
---
## Surge
---
Your eerie presence charges the air and interferes with technology. Downing a
---
Survivor instantly explodes and places a regression effect on any generators
---
within range. The generator is also instantly regressed. _‚ÄúThe creature
---
appears to have some unknown influence over electricity and nearby
---
electronics.‚Äù‚Äî Hawkins National Laboratory_
---
## Cruel Limits
---
Your ties to the otherworldly manifest when your prey attempts to get away.
---
Each time a generator is fixed, vaulting is blocked for the Survivors close to
---
that generator for a short time.  
---
_‚ÄúThe specimen seems to able to affect the state of nearby objects, as if they
---
existed in some other form within a dimension alternate to our own.‚Äù‚Äî Hawkins
---
National Laboratory_
---
## Mindbreaker
---
Your distressing presence drains and weakens your prey. While repairing a
---
generator, Survivors are afflicted by the Exhaustion Status effect. The
---
Exhaustion Status effect pauses while fixing a generator and re-starts after
---
ending the repair action. ‚àí _"The specimen can evoke feelings of dread and
---
fatigue in nearby individuals." ‚Äî Hawkins National Laboratory_  
---
Studious and rebellious, Nancy Wheeler is a stubborn investigator with an
---
instinct for a good story. When her closest friend, Barb went missing, she did
---
everything she could to unravel the truth and secure justice. A brilliant
---
journalist, she chases stories and follows leads despite the inequality and
---
chauvinism she encounters at the workplace. Pursuing a lead one evening, she
---
fearlessly approaches the Hawkins National Laboratory before suddenly losing
---
consciousness. A moment later she awakens in a strange misty realm with the
---
sound of a familiar roar echoing through the air.  
---
Nancy Wheeler comes with **3 new perks.**
---
## Better Together
---
You seek justice and uncover the truth no matter what obstacle stands in your
---
way. The aura of the generator being repaired is revealed to other Survivors
---
within range. If the Killer downs a Survivor while you are repairing a
---
generator, the Killer‚Äôs and Survivors‚Äô auras are revealed to you briefly. ‚àí
---
_‚ÄúLet‚Äôs burn that lab to the ground.‚Äù‚ÄîNancy Wheeler_
---
## Fixated
---
When you have a goal in mind, there‚Äôs no turning back: better to ask
---
forgiveness than permission. You can see your own scratch marks at all time.
---
When your health is full, you can walk faster than normal. ‚àí _‚ÄúI wanna finish
---
what we started. I want to kill it."‚ÄîNancy Wheeler_
---
## Inner Strength
---
You look inward and trust your instincts when you feel lost and alone. When
---
you complete a cleanse Totem action, the Perk activates. Once activated, you
---
self-heal when entering a locker. _‚ÄúAll this time I‚Äôve been trying so hard to
---
pretend like everything‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not.‚Äù‚ÄîNancy Wheeler_  
---
Popular and arrogant, yet compassionate, Steve Harrington is an unlikely
---
mentor and leader. He often acts as a surrogate big brother to a younger boy
---
named Dustin. He even helped him find his slimy inter-dimensional pet
---
Demogorgon, D‚ÄôArtagnan. His reputation as a protector grew and he soon became
---
a sort of ‚Äòbabysitter‚Äô for a group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing
---
around with strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he
---
was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his friends.  
---
One evening he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler.
---
He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was
---
okay. He searched the area but only found her notebook. Before he realized
---
what was happening, the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled his
---
eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but
---
unfamiliar at the same time.  
---
Steve Harrington comes with **3 new perks.**
---
## Babysitter
---
While you have a reputation for being self-centered, you risk it all to help
---
those in need. The Survivor you unhook leaves no blood trail or scratch marks
---
for a short amount of time. Also, both you and the Killer can briefly see each
---
other‚Äôs aura. ‚àí_‚ÄúI promised to keep you shitheads safe, and that‚Äôs exactly
---
what I plan on doing.‚Äù ‚ÄîSteve Harrington_
---
## Camaraderie
---
Life has taught you the importance of friendship which has given you strength.
---
If a Survivor comes within range of your hook while you are struggling, the
---
Struggle Phase timer pauses briefly. ‚Äì _‚ÄúSo, remember once you get in there‚Ä¶
---
pretend like you don‚Äôt care. There you go, you‚Äôre learning my friend. You‚Äôre
---
learning.‚Äù‚ÄîSteve Harrington_
---
## Second Wind
---
You have learned to avoid awkward situations with parents. Part of you still
---
thinks your best option is to run away and hope things will take care of
---

heal after unhooking yourself or being unhooked by a Survivor when you are

## New Map: The Underground Complex
---
**  
---
Located below of the Hawkins National Laboratory, this underground complex
---
released dozens of inter-dimensional creatures in November 1984 before the
---
rift was sealed. The site includes an isolation tank and equipment once used
---
by government officials to conduct mind control experiments on test subjects.
---
Now the walls of the abandoned facility are sprayed with bullets and blood,
---
evidence of the battle against the creatures.  
---
## Exclusive Items for Nancy and Steve
---
Stranger Things Chapter includes two exclusive items: Steve‚Äôs Scuffed Rolled
---
Sleeves and Nancy‚Äôs Torn Sweatshirt. These are only available as part of the
---
DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.
---
It's live just now on the steam store.
---
Damn really? What's the conversion rate?
---
Sorry bro just realised when I filtered to new post, thanks anyways
---
Sharp hand Joe....  
---
thats a name i haven't heard for days...
---
It's not late. They literally said the dlc will release at 12pm and the update at 11am. Read the sub a little better.
---
If you had one gen left, which is what the meme was referring to.
---
Content is out from buying in game store rather than xbox store
---
YAY!!!
---
All they need to do is revert Mettle of Man, but make it like the old DS where the Obsession has the true version of the perk, while other users do not. So the Obsession has the old MoM, but the others users have current MoM
---
Isn't that now tho?
---
That‚Äôs beautiful
---
I looked up 12 est and it says it's now for me 17:01 (GMT)
---
Velcro-head looking ass
---
So would the better option be to just slug the unhooked person and leave them for a teammate to get them, then go after the the person who did the bad unhook?
---
More than likely
---
Oh okay cool thank you
---
Yeah you're right. Rank reset is just a mess in general right now
---
Literaly me
---
Im usually at those ranks but play like a rank 1 cos I dont play very much anymore
---
Does Kindred still trump Undetectable?
---
A mess
---
RIP Pebble memes.
---
It's going to be better than a lot of Gen perks, it just takes more thought than ruin or Corrupt.
---
Undeniable debuff, up to 23% on 3 survivors at a time, with everyone alive, and you just keep the obsession busy with you, or on the ground.
---
I don't use ruin, but I might be using this in red ranks.
---
I hope the fix to prevent survivors from taking the game "hostage" on the Hawkins Lab map addressed what you are mentioning.
---
WTF THEY DID WITH HER HAIR ??? OMG
---
&gt; Dead hard is easily the worst perk in the game  
---
I think you may have misspelled something there.
---
Nice my ps plus just ran out
---
Also if you pay for the actual DLC and not the cells on PS4 at least that means you can game share. So my wife and I can both use all the DLC I bought but if I use cells only I can use it.
---
What do you mean? It's available to now buy which includeds all 3 characters. The DLC is always delayed in stores after chapter patch hits.
---
No they are not being brought out. They are pushed back to Fall 2019. THey are trying to fix some glitchs/ bugs and fix issues related to projectiles acting wonky
---
This is hilarious
---
Yeah and the dlc is purchasable.
---
I don't think it's a big deal since this is how it already should have been upon his buff, but I could totally see the Devs buff BT saying "When unhooking a Survivor within a Killers Terror Radius of Luluby...".
---
You don't save them lol. They aren't shards. You're spending real money to get them.
---
Shiiiiiit, I'll edit that out
---
You should wake up before a hook rescue ideally anyways as Freddy tends to spill blood all over the floor around hooks
---
Yes, but Borrowed Time doesn't work when you're asleep.
---
I hear the heartbeat then it goes away immediately. The killer was either passing by, chasing someone else, or he could be potentially coming at me. However, the lack of audio and visual queues makes it hard to see where he's coming from and which way to escape. Unless it's Gas Haven and you can see the killer from 10 miles away. It wouldn't replace perks like ruin or pop. It would just make things more spoopy like when you run into those jump scare Myers. Except, every killer could potentially do it. 
---
I was mostly expanding on Krazy's perk. I just like his idea and was giving an example of other potential perks. It's fun to explore perks that would bring more horror or suspenseful elements to the game. As opposed to block gens, give hard skill checks, make gens harder, dramatically regress gens on hooks, etc.
---
It ain't for me, anyways cheers
---
Another reason to wake up
---
Bone apple tea
---
The camera angle doesn't allow you to do it until the 3rd hook.
---
Yep I tried out the add-on and oh boy is the stun long pretty big atleast from what I felt using it and yea youre right it's allowing you to be more aggressive not save time
---
We PlayStation 2 now boys
---
The drawback is that you play 90% of the match with a perk that literally does nothing, and IF you get to the point of the game where it MIGHT activate, if the survivors did all the totems, it did literally not a single thing for you that entire game
---
Just bought it. :)
---
Do you have max settings
---
On what grounds?
---
That is the best possible answer.
---
By downing the unhooked person you deny the rescuer the perk and point bonuses of a "Safe Hook Rescue" while also punishing them by keeping your chase focus on them.
---
Maybe change BT to be if the killer is within 24 metres? I slight nerf to it against most killers at the benefit of removing stealth killer immunity.
---
Wait, is this DbD or DnD?
---
Not yet, but lobby management is.
---
YIKES
---
That‚Äôs what I usually do. I‚Äôll take a swing at the person being unhooked (at like, no effort because the unhooker is a jerk who doesn‚Äôt leave any space to run), but then just chase the unhooker and give them a good ‚Äúno‚Äù body shake once I hook them. And then you just have to hope the rest of the team is able to get the other person back up
---
I don't understand. The punce is the "shred"? They made his ultrarare add-on base power? Then what's the ability of the new add-on?
---
Which Killer did you use?
---
You're all breathtaking.
---
how does borrowed time not work
---
MY EYES!!
---
It's on sale right now! :D
---
Snowflake
---
I honestly think it's fine as it is but I wouldn't be surprised if they changed it to the above.
---
"Hey, do you guys know who the killer is-"
---
this does put a smile on my face
---
You need to be inside terror radius, Gf, Pig, Wraith, even Insidious counters it
---
Yeah, I'm the Dwight in there... :D
---
me and you brother, me and you ;(
---
Lowkey good but claustrophobia not to good of a perk.
---
you say you only get a small discount like nobody would want that
---
If you buy them in game it's all separate. Wait and get the chapter in your platforms shop if you want everything
---
might as well be playing the mobile port
---
If you spend the 500 auric cells you will only get one. But im sure theres a deal to get all of them which is cheaper than buying them all separately
---
I‚Äôm only a 100k short of 1mil bp, feelsbad
---
The same people who buy cells regularly for cosmetics are the ones who buy dlc with em
---
That's how it should be.
---
What's the point of having an anti tunnel perk if it's easily counterable by killers who are able to camp in stealth?
---
you have to buy them all separately, but just wait until they‚Äôre out on your platforms store! shouldn‚Äôt be long now
---
Back off would be so toxic ngl. Full team of carly's just stunning you by the gate lol
---
If you buy with cells, you are only getting the character u clicked on. Buying the dlc as a whole with real money is buying them as a pack
---
P3 Survivor and I can see four perks in my new bloodweb. Don't have enough to see how many I can actually snatch :(.
---
Man, I bought the DLC 3x (for 2 friends and myself). At ¬£10 a pop that's pretty steep for some DLC. Might be a barrier for some.
---
The Clown is so rare I welcome him with loving arms
---
Elder Maxson is here
---
Well that‚Äôs one way of doing it. Though, if you buy only the Demogorgon from the shop, you‚Äôll need to buy both Steve and Nancy separately, which comes to about 15. But you can get them all together for cheaper if you head over to Steam and buy the DLC for what I think was $12
---
If you buy the Demogorgon for 500 cells, it will not come with Steve / Nancy. If you want them all, you can spend the 1500 cells, or buy the Chapter as a whole for a set price, determined by your region.
---
The real question is why she got her right hand on her left arm.
---
Lol the pussy dc. "Oh no I got caught, better fuck up the game for the rest of the team because I'm bad"
---
Chapter on PS4 Store still unavailable.
---
It‚Äôs 500 auric cells per character which is $15 total. It‚Äôs better to buy the chapter on your platform‚Äôs store for $12.
---
BT apparently no longer works on him, so that's nice. All in all I'd say this is a sideways shift in strength, not really a buff or a nerf.
---
I'm wet!!
---
I'd wait to buy it as a whole instead of using the Auric Cells. With Auric Cells you'll only get one character at a time and it's more expensive overall.
---
What platform are you on?

Do you know when is the next free weekend?
---
Before they release the chapter in its full state, they allow people to buy the characters separately with auric cells if they aren‚Äôt patient to wait which would total out to about 15$ this time. The full chapter should be available in a few minutes, just wait a little bit.
---
Thank goodness I don't balance the perks IRL!
---
*nom*
---
It just went up on Xbox. Like right before I wrote this
---
Thank you!!!
---
Can i get sum context please?
---
This is a huge to nerf to me because i always run BT :(, guess i‚Äôll just have to wakeup before i save now
---
i always send a message to thank them üíï (i play kn ps4 also)
---
No it isnt
---
It got pushed back and will probably release in mid chapter
---
They posted a dev update the other day saying they were delayed till Fall
---
Ah... Yea we wont get shit xD
---
Lookin' like a bimbo
---
Not for me yet. East Coast US.
---
Yesterday, I turned around at the opened gates after a 2 man SWF ran out to give my life for the hooked and camped survivor that was just struggling there. It felt like the right thing to do.
---
Got flamed by both the guy I rescued and the killer in post-game chat that I'm a fucking idiot and don't know how the game works. :(
---
Well someone said it was today at 5 pm but idk dunno how it qualifies as a weekend lol
---
I think it‚Äôll be two?! I‚Äôll have to see once this update is finished! So excited :D
---
But i own all the dlcs
---
Im on PS4 and its still unavailable in the store
---
Not in the UK yet :(

I would think yes , since it says all aura reading abilities.  However as far as I can remember, only the demogorgan gains this effect when he is coming out a portal , and it last for a short duration.  So I doubt you'll see it happen to begin with . However if that changes with other killers , I doubt it will matter too much.  My guess is undetectable is treated like Michael myers tier 1, in regards to aura reading .
---
And I'm telling you man, just try Dark Devotion and Tinker

lol you're right, I forget we are not even in the middle of the week
---
&gt; Demogorgon can now break pallets with a Pounce attack by default
---
So... what's Red Moss going to do now?
---
Don't give up on trying to be a good team mate! Even tho sometimes you will feel stupid,  as you watch them leave as you hang there dying. :/ If all 4 are alive,  and the killer doesn't have noed there is no reason anyone should die. Even with a camper. I saved my team from a camping hag yesterday, they actually helped me as well,  and we all got out!
---
Hey, I‚Äôve seen this one before it‚Äôs a classic!
---
Killer with bbq and chili. 40-60k every game
---
Yup me too.
---
Same, i‚Äôm in France
---
If only Adept achievements for killers were re-balanced in light of the Emblem system changes, I'd be very happy. Please consider fixing this, maybe make the existing ones a legacy style achievement, and add one that takes the drastically different Emblem system into account.
---
I got it so you should be able to get it soon

I like the change, but what about the add-on?

Do we have an even *newer* shiny toy to play with, or is moss just kinda redundant now?

Cue sound effects and proceed to shit your pants. Then feel relief because he's not near you.
---
it‚Äôs still rank reset so you‚Äôre likely just getting good survivors in a lower rank than they should be
---
I'm in the same boat as you - refreshing the PS store page every minute or two until it's live: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/grid/search-game/1?query=dead%20by%20daylight
---
Finally avaliable
---
They could be fake rank 15s loll
---
We don't know yet. It's getting replaced in the same hotfix.
---
Well they optimized. You prefer good fps and hits or good hair? You'll have to upgrade
---
But you can't be asleep while on the hook, so wouldn't the survivor still get the borrowed time if Freddy is nearby?
---
I‚Äôm waiting for it to drop in the store. The patch is live but the chapter in the PlayStation store isn‚Äôt

 Two games in a row that I was rubber branding all over the place. Even if the ping looked good at the lobby. I left both game and was not even able to close the game.

So imagine how I depiped. Wow. Right now I'm restarting the PS4 to see if it's always like this.
---
An HR or so
---
Don‚Äôt name shame
---
Ability to reconnect, supposed it only works for survivors currently. It's all but expected at low ranks in say, League of Legends.
---
You can buy them separately now or wait for the full package to come out
---
I think they‚Äôre saving all the good cosmetics for the archives
---
Ragepost for sure
---
Not for me
---
This has happened to me more times than I want to admit
---
Your belief is stupid. This game is a homage to horror movies. Name another game where you get to play as Legendary Horror Icons. I‚Äôd say giving people three original killers and three licensed killers is pretty fair. Do you even have a valid reason for not wanting licensed killers, other than just being a fucking moron?
---
It's available in the UK now!
---
I hate to burst your bubble now but the DLC is now on sale on Steam...
---
honestly you just have games like that sometimes, i‚Äôve seen it happen before. players are learning to just crank out gens with ruin rather than spend ages looking for the totem
---
even she looks sad about it
---
I literally farmed the entire weekend to get to the same point lol. It was so hard to to spend those points
---
Rank reset wasn‚Äôt too long ago, it‚Äôs possible they‚Äôre just good at gens, and you‚Äôre not applying enough gen pressure
---
It will be replaced. What we're currently considering is an add-on that increases his portal cooldown, but greatly increases the length of the undetectable effect after using a portal. (Basically stealth Demogorgons.)
---
What is that ugly s-
---
Aw man, it sucks having to pay to play online. Thanks for the data!
---
The full chapter or each individually?
---
Hopefully this speeds up getting all the available perks (Good ones atleast). Here's the bloodweb if anybody is interested https://imgur.com/a/mV512A6
---
he has a heart in his beard
---
They most likely bought with AC
---
Killers need warmth too *pepehands*
---
When will Undetectable be added to the other stealth killers?
---
Full chapter via the ps store for ‚Ç¨11,99
---
I feel like in some situations this would be good,  but it was also take away from it. When I play swf, I know my friends aren't going to scream and act crazy all game. Some people will be even more toxic on mics,  than they are in chat. Sucks but it is true. Half of them would probably laugh as you ask for a save. :/
---
It actually gives a reason for people to not be toxic asshats, so please op keep the names
---
Command I've been captured by two German nerds!!
---
Is this a DLC pack for Ps4 or do you buy everything separately ?
---
Do you know how many auric cells it is if you buy it ingame instead?
---
Ah
---
I mean it‚Äôs only ripped shirts but if you wait for it to fully drop it‚Äôll just be cheaper overall
---
Its available now on the store for me, but it still says coming soon in the game, weird
---
500 per character but you get no cosmetics. (One for each survivor)
---
Lmao i love it
---
500 for each
---
Instead of going to Add-Ons -&gt; New.
---
Try searching for ‚ÄúSTRANGER THINGS‚Äù
---
It‚Äôll work.
---
No dude it‚Äôs against the rules lol
---
This is so cool! I gotta say you made them much more visually pleasing than they are in the game lol awesome job
---
Yeah no, there are definitely more hatch locations on those maps than that.
---
So you know which direction to run to when you're being chased. Why must I state the obvious? And if I'm being chased I don't always have the luxury to map the whole area so I'll definitely be in a 16 m range of the hatch at some point.
---
And please explain to me how getting new headphones will help me with the bug. Or how turning up the volume will help considering everything else will turn deafening at that point.
---
What the heck its not there for me
---
I didn't?
---
You play spirit
---
Thank god I‚Äôm not the only one. I had 3 dailies worth 100,000 bloodpoints altogether and now they‚Äôre gone...

I had one match where I got downed pretty quickly by a Freddy (before rework) and right after I got hooked, all 3 of my teammates DC'd after figuring out it was a Freddy and I just sat on hook to die.
---
I had no idea
---
Keep refreshing, it will work. Cuz i now got it confirmed in gane as well
---
I need to learn the angle for this
---
HOLD UP! Has the Wraith finally started leg day? That thigh is looking swole! My man finally not going be looking like a dorito anymore
---
God i wish they would remove the boots on Megs tempo runner outfit, my favorite top in the game and it's ruined by goofy ass boots dangling on the back
---
Have a good day little ms. attitude.
---
I think some people just want to get to the next game so they can actually play. Sometimes, you just don't feel like farming, waiting or dc'ing yourself.
---
So did my pants
---
No ps plus and xbox gold are two different things
---
Gamepass is another subscription you can buy for more games....
---
I'm literally SO EXCITED
---
WaTCh me spend all my money on Scoops ahoy Steve instead of another ps plus voucher so I can actually play past Friday
---
Probably just rank reset. I felt bad, was playing some survivor yesterday and we were steamrolling lower rank killers. :/ I wish they would change the rank reset to every couple months or something. Feelsbadman
---
Well rip consistent lobbies. Everyone is going to DC now for stupid ass reasons.
---
Thank you, kind stranger!
---
Kinda odd, but yeah that worked
---
Decisive doesnt beed to be changed
---
Can you see the ranks as killer?
---
Limbo.
---
Not sure why sure couldn't just have the best of both worlds with its effect, 12% at a 32m radius really isn't enough to warrant a such a nerf.
---
t h a m k s
---
SAME :D
---
Think it‚Äôs just for survivors
---
Ooh Kermit.
---
Do you get cosmetics for buying the chapter without cells though? Thanks btw
---
It certainly makes maxing a character easier :)
---
I have a father. His name was Ben Parker.
---
Nope
---
Whats that new symbol above davids head?
---
I can't get out of the title screen. I got an overheat message the first time. (not helpful that the title screen turns a ps4 into a fighter jet) now it just closes the app and turns my console off entirely. Gotta go to work so I'm just gonna leave it off and see how it is when I get home.
---
Grind? Why would you need to grind?
---
Passive abilities are passive... you saying you dont want to have to learn the game anymore than the simplicity it is now?
---
The irony in this statement is hilarious
---
Thanks!!!
---
I want you to be boiled alive for your comment. Fuck you.
---
That‚Äôs the prestige symbol.
---
Me neither - auric cells only.
---
Dont worry, I'm getting the same thing. Lol

Except their version of having fun is making sure the killer can't and shitting all over them for it. Fuck you.
---
I manage to get a key from Green Man Gaming for the base game: $9. Search around!
---
That bout of Flu that just popped up sucks doesn‚Äôt it? Don‚Äôt count out food poisoning just say boss... gotta go! üòÇ

I'm sorry that you had that experience. I've had too many myself. But, to be consistent, fuck you.
---
The killer is Dan Schneider. He gets the same mori as the Clown.
---
Bubba bubba bubba
---
Aww I was hoping it would of been Joey Salads
---
What about one that let Demo use Shred to pounce through windows?
---
I feel like extra stealth is already covered by his Mushrooms, and an add-on to empower Shred would still be cool.
---
What exactly is the nature of Killer Instinct? If a survivor will be indicated by Killer Instinct, what does that actually look like?
---
Yeah, same thing happened with ghostface, so I just bought him with cells, but I'm not gonna drop 20 on cells when I can get the chapter for 12. Guess were waiting. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÑ
---
I also have \~30k shards doing nothing. idk what to do with them
---
Lynching is too good for them, fuck you for suggesting it.
---
Can't believe you actually need to search all caps. That's the only thing that worked for me
---
You're damn right .
---
May I ask why the quick change to killer/survivor button was removed? You now have to back out to the main menu to change and i can‚Äôt see any reason why it would have been removed.
---
You could try slotting it with Deliverance and We're Gonna Live Forever. Deliverance means you can unhook yourself *guaranteed* if you unhook a survivor and they last 10 seconds without going down - a "Safe Hook Rescue". We're Gonna Live Forever gives you +25% Bloodpoints postgame for every "Safe Hook Rescue" and "Protection" event (body blocking the killer to take a hit intended for another survivor). This caps out at +100%, or basically double Bloodpoints.
---
Mode of operation would thus be to unhook the survivor and then body block the killer - you should get 25% for the Safe Hook, 25% for taking a hit, and if the survivor lasts 10 seconds then you can bounce off your hook and repeat the process to get the last two stacks.
---
Very risky, not very meta, and you want to be careful about trying it against the aforementioned multi-hit killers - or when your team is terrible and can't last 10 seconds after unhook.
---
Your name concerns me...
---
I feel as if we all noticed this while constantly refreshing the page waiting for demogorgon to show up
---
God why does this game look like hot trash?
---
And that's why I main killer. Solo survivor is like asking to get balls slapped across your face
---
That chick has godlike jawline holy
---
I get where you're coming from, but its just a trade-off of using Hex Perks. Its a part of the game. I dont like the current spots right now either, but I've just learned to accept it.
---
Look closely, it's just a perspective
---
Same!!!
---
The demogorgon is a huge aggressive beast with giant sharpened claws capable of ripping apart wood, metal, and flesh like it's tissue paper.
---
Frank is a teenager with a pocket knife...
---
It's like comparing a bear to a house cat. One of them makes sense for destroying pallets easily; the other, not so much.
---
This is why people hate twitchies
---
When did they ever say they were changing swf other than the new party system?
---
Yep. Also, direct link to the dlc if you haven't snagged it yet: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3509-CUSA08444_00-CHAPTERQATAR0000
---
I couldnt find how much the actual game is since I'm on mobile. How much is it. I'm trying to get my friend to play.
---
Why
---
yeah this game can have some genuinely horrible people sometimes
---
Pc is so toxic. Good lord.
---
It‚Äôs almost as if I was making a joke
---
I know, that's kinda the joke
---
It's live on the PS store to buy

---
Not really true... cause their passives might not combo with perks very well... sayyy nea has a passive that all speed boost effects are multiplied by 10%... this means her passive combined with exhaustion perks... and hope and the like.
---
Where as laurie might have a passive for decisive, this means she has an extra perk slot but her passive doesnt really have any direct impact and she may never use it.
---
Claudette might have a passive where you hear the terror radius of killers 10 meters further away... this eliminates needs for awareness perks and gives her a niche role as a team mate.
---
Bill could have borrowed time as a passive for his character, other survivors can run borrowed time as a perk slot but bill gets to spare that.
---
Ace could have a passive 30% hook jump off for the first hook, its RNG, and 100% trap escape chance.
---
Yes obviously some here are more meta lvl useful than others, but everyone has a niche... you might think playing bill is smart but if your against a trapper or your team mates cant save you, your really wishing you were ace.
---
Or you may think that passive decisive is always the better choice, but if your not being tunneled but your just being out played in a chase, your really wishing you brought than NEA.
---
If stealth killers or small radius killers are catching you in the open, you might think your meta choice survivor is the best, but your gunna really wish you brought that claudette so you knew they were coming.

---
Yup, i did that
---
You‚Äôre playing into the killer‚Äôs hand throwing down all those pallets with five gens left
---
$15
---
Just give him some taunt voiceovers.
---
"Come get me, you ugly sonofabitch!"
---
I don't know why but this is hysterical
---
For the trophy. When you unhook someone take a hit to protect it.
---
Wish I was that calm opening up an exit gate.
---
Uh because.
---
I‚Äôm personally confused as to why people are saying the lunge is good against loops. From my experience, the leap was terrible against loops unless you were already in range to basic attack them anyway.
---
You‚Äôre not even running we‚Äôre gonna life forever
---
Looks like a glowing spiderweb that pulses. You can't really miss it - check out any YouTube video where they're using Legion and land a hit on someone.
---
Returning player here: Which DLCs (aside from Stranger Things) are worth getting? I am missing GhostFace, Ash, Demise of the Faithful (Plague), Shattered Bloodline (Spirit) and Darkness Among Us (Legion)...are any of them worth getting or can I skip them?
---
Outside of Rancor being obsession is usually a good thing. Most if the killer perks involving obsession want you to leave them alone.
---
That would be unfair, all the girls minus Jane would instantly be better than the guys since they're all smaller in stature and will thus have smaller hitboxes.
---
Makes sense. However I would change BT to trigger any way and not depend on terror radius. And not, I am not survivor main.
---
Ash mains rise up
---
Got it, thanks!
---
I like it, instead of making them spawn in literally all the places you are limiting the spawn places so good players will learn the hidden spots and cleanse even faster.
---
Dont worry, youll be back BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/SF by tmrrw
---
Not if he camps them on their 1st hook all the way to that point.
---
I think it‚Äôs just wasted money
---
Wholesome killer
---
I am merciless. And your instaheal, is mine.
---
Wasted money.
---
DS lasts 3x more though.  
---
Campers aren't all that common besides EGC, and I constantly get teammates that cleanse sickness all the time or survivors that can't mend a Deep Wound so I don't really have to worry about EGC lol.  
---
Even for campers I see that most of them assume I have BT so 1 out of \~7 times they go after me.
---
gtx 1060 and i-7 6700k should be more than fine for dbd like ffs
---
looking back dramatically then giving himself a headache*
---
Well start off by not clicking the disconnect button
---
A dick
---
Possibly. But probably not anytime soon. We made the mistake of congratulating the Devs on fixing a broken killer so soon. Now they think they did a good job and refuse to fix him now.
---
Cuz it's not far from the truth
---
"Good" is a strong word. Those numbers are straight trash and it slows the game down when you least need it. It's a win more perk that doesn't really help you win more since you're already doing great if it's working.
---
The point of the video is how long i can evade the killer before he gets me.
---
A-holes aside, welcome to DBD!
---
I'd highly recommend you check out some of the *good* streamers like Otzdarva, HybridPanda, and Tru3ta1ent. They're a great source of info on how to get the most enjoyment out of the whole experience.
---
And definitely check out Otz's second youtube channel for tons of tips - it's under NotOtzdarva :D
---
No thanks
---
Can you guys please fix the Wounded Healer trophy already?!!?!?!? It's been glitched since May and you can't get it on PS4
---
No
---
This unsettled me I like it
---
Ok :)
---
No.
---
I think hes talkin about ‚Ç¨11.99 :D
---
Awesome, thanks for the info.
---
What you mean? Her right arm is carrying a toolbox which means her left arm is pulling the lever and there's no way her pinky finger's knuckle is that far to the bottom unless she freaky üòÇ
---
Wait, how the hell can you see their ranks?
---
So buttmad. I love it.
---
Cynthia?!?
---
It's 100 on PS4, and no progress tracking. I hope it's not bugged cuz fuck that trophy already.
---
It is though. Just purchase it on the PlayStation store and go to your game
---
Yeah same
---
The new system is broken and horrible
---
r/blessedimages
---
Terrible? That was actually amazing. Never thought I would laugh so hard when getting hooked. Also Steve's scream in background was just hilarious.
---
From this games perspective I like Nancy (but not more than Claudette) but from the perspective of the show I absolutely love Steve‚Äôs charecter arc.
---
I just want the boys to be able to wear the girls' clothes.
---
money well spent
---
Steve
---
I know I just think it would be better because if you bring ruin it might last for a minute and then you lost a perk slot once its cleansed. I just think it would be better if the likelihood if your totems being cleansed right away are lower if you have them leveled up
---
Thats just an average game for me
---
It's possibly because of the update. I'm on ps4 and mine had similar messages every time I tried to open my game. Might just be your version trying to sync up with all updates etc.
---
I only have money left for one cosmetic, guess I'll buy the shirt for Nancy lol.
---
It also helps to remember that the hatch will spawn when the number of gens completed is one more than the number of survivors alive, so if they get down to 1 gen left and nobody is even trying to touch them start looking around chests to see if people are looking for keys
---
Demogorgon, Steve is just a skin.
---
SIN
---
Hillbilly only moves at 4.6 m/s... Unless you're counting his chainsaw? He can't benefit from exposed using his chainsaw, and areas around lockers tend to have plentiful walls to juke behind.
---
Also a good Nurse counters almost everything, but that doesn't make Iron Maiden good.
---
I am now going to call my anti-gen meme build ‚ÄúGens closed due to aids‚Äù
---
You won't need to download anything other than the update they pushed a couple hours ago. Once you purchase, restart your PS4 and you should be good.
---
Good luck!
---
i like your art style. very unique
---
Yeah I think maybe there could be less than 4 per each teir of totem maybe 1 or 2 but just being a minute in and having only 3 perks because ruin got cleansed so fast is painful
---
Wig status on the right: Half snatched.
---
? I'm referencing the ability to traverse to the survivors location within the necessary timeframe
---
If you‚Äôre on PC just delete the files for the anti cheat and restore the lost files in the game properties
---
They just won't stop nerfing her won't they. Every damn chapter release there is a new nerf for her. And her addons are still trash for almost two years now.
---
True, but I don't enjoy watching them. I like the more instructive players - learnin' me somethin'.
---
If you want the memes, you go to Farmer John.
---
THEY TOUCH MY RIN ?!
---
chapter 14 changes:the pig is now a survivor
---
The girls are already better because they are smaller and it is easier to hide them behind everything.
---
Spirit is one of the hardest killers to counter in chase. There are things you can try, but no guarantee they will always work. It depends on how good your opponent is.
---
Generally, I try to confuse them if I know they are phasing. Run one way, then go the opposite direction. Even running back towards them might work. Try to be random so that your scratch marks are not in a straight line, making you harder to track. Run to a pallet, and either throw it early, or walk away from it after a second or two. Spirit will usually assume you‚Äôre camping the pallet and appear right at it with an attack. 
---
Again, none of these are 100% perfect strategies, but with Spirit, you sometimes need to just try shit and hope it works. 
---
I dunno man, facecamping is just admitting defeat imo. Just proxy the first guy that shows up and keep the pressure
---
Ocheeto the pedo.
---
Nah, back to dumb Make your Choice meme builds with Pig or scratched mirror Myers most likely. Might have another go with Huntress, since Iron Maiden will still be relevant as a counter.
---
The package is already out on consoles so hopefully you have it soon.
---
In a cage match, my money's on Demogorgon. Steve only ever won one fight, he doesn't have the best record.
---
What this do?
---
I noticed a lot of bugs esp with the new swf lobby thingy.
---
And remember me when's the killer gets their stacks they're most likely going to kill you and get it over with
---
Could you imagine if people searched the sub before posting the same questions for 80th time.
---
Considering this now comes with a +0.25 second recovery for Shred, it's still pretty slow compared to just breaking the pallet. It's less about giving Demogorgon more tools because he's lacking, and more taking a useless add-on ability and giving it presence with the base kit.
---
Only the mask, everything else was BHVR.
---
Just a little heads up that this isn't everywhere, for anyone coming across this and wondering why theirs isn't the same! My psn store doesn't have the discounts unfortunately :(
---
‚ÄúMade with mematic‚Äù
---
I'm surprised there has only been one post about this on the sub, actually.
---
Yeah when I had plunderers on nea  I got more skeleton keys than most other things
---
This. Camping always sucks, but the Jake *totally* deserved it.
---
? You mean in-game? There has never been in-game VC, you have always had to use the systems native VC (parties for PS4, idk for Xbox)
---
So many people forget that DCs also heavily screw over the killer. It's not just the remaining survivors that lose out.
---
Not gonna lie, I tried checking top posts but I guess I missed it haha
---
If they spawn in specific places survivors will not have yo look anywhere else though, they'll just go stalraight to those spots. 
---
I've had my ruin last longer in the corn than hiddrn behind a wall or rock, coz people tend to look at those places a lot,, the corn they stsmble upon it by chance
---
Gotcha thank you!!!
---
Noed only triggers once the gates are opened right?

Demogorgon is quite terrifying if I say so myself..lol

No. Ghostface was $5 and it was literally Ghostface. No map, no survivors.
---
Also Ash is $5. No killer, no map.
---
Stranger Things - 2 survivors ($10), 1 killer ($5) and 1 map (free). It's technically a steal as you are saving $3 before tax.

They deserve the money for supporting the game in such a good way imo.
---
Hey can we change our aura and scratch mark colors please, I know isn't *exactly* the place to ask for something like this but bhvr employees are in the thread so there's a chance it'll get seen by you guys.

Shut up I‚Äôm gonna fuck him
---
Wow, I guess their parents don‚Äôt care at all then, I mean my mom totally freaked out about me playing until I showed her a clip of a killer who carried me to the hatch at the end of the game, I had to tell her that the game was more about cooperating with others than horror as well, and I‚Äôm not very far away from the age limit so I wonder what the 6 year old must have told their parents being 10+ years too young
---
Next, you don't be a dick and play fairly.
---
All this content and all this work that went into it? I‚Äôm happy to pay $12.
---
He's a very fun and memeable killer, but is hard to play so he doesn't get much love.
---
It's actually a good price, if you bought them all individually it'd be 15 dollars. And 10 if you only want one survivor and the killer. 12 seems very fair to me
---
2 survivors, killer, 9 perks, map, new voices and sounds, music....like, be glad it isn't $25.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Since we have the Demogorgon now...does that mean we can have Monsters on Maple Street?
---
Que?
---
Like u said balancing the game around high ranks let's noobs learn with noobs and they have more content to explore.
---
Where as for the rest of us we have more content, and also the ability of recieving killer changes that actually improve them in the right way.
---
And perks aren't a  gamble, and what moron would think a passive is a gamble?
---
You know the fucking passives so its consistant and not a gamble of anykind.
---
Perks can quickly be figured out and their not a gamble at all cause you know what your running.
---
Like I've heard people talk out of their ass but how is a hero specific ability a gamble? If everyone in the fucking game knows it's there and what it is.
---
Yeah it definitely is. I still brought the scoops outfit straightaway though.
---
That would most likely be me. I usually go full kill mode when 2+ survivors DCed to just end it as quick as possible. So we can all move on. Little bit annoying to be called a "Tryharder" but idc. The game isn't fun for me as a killer with DCs, so I just want to move on.
---
^Fuck, ^he ^has ^BBQ.

i mean it really does only slow the game down a little bit
---
Someone play a Strode offering
---
I would f say rare. We just have everyone screaming, ‚ÄúWOW GUYS. NURSE, SPIRIT AND BILLY ARE BEST KILLERS,‚Äù so newer players are inclined towards playing and mastering them (or one of them) after having been bullied into oblivion by toxic players purposely deranking themselves to mess with killers. 
---
Out of 100, he maybe appeared like 5 times for me. And every time he did, I shit my pants as you just don‚Äôt expect it. 
---
Also, we have a bigger killer pool now than two years ago. Ghostface is the current preferred stealth killer as he‚Äôs new. When Michael first came out, everyone was playing him. It got old so fast. Now it‚Äôs a treat when I play against him. Makes it feel more special.
---
You thought it was I wanna fuck trapper but it was me dio...I mean fuck

Loving the subs recent Nickelodeon meme wave lol
---
That's great advice, thanks man. I had a match yesterday where a Laurie was standing at the other side of a pallet, I'm not sure if they were a noob like me or if they were being kind by letting me stalk them all the way to EW3, fun times!
---
Well that‚Äôs true, but with Jojo‚Äôs recent popularity boom, there‚Äôs a lot of people just now watching the show, so it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs almost new
---
I dont get why ppl are so quick to call this game scummy. Pig cosmetics aren‚Äôt available through in game currency bc its a movie license... scummy, gotta pay more bc ur getting more... scummy. Like maybe besides some cosmetics being a little overpriced (even though it makes sense bc its probably one of their main ways to get money in) this game is pretty generous with its pricing nothing is ridiculously overpriced.
---
I know I was just adding it to my point
---
Ooo I'm scared! Lol.
---
Each character is $4. If you can‚Äôt afford a $12 dlc you have no business gaming in general. 
---
FYI you don‚Äôt have to buy the pack either, you can buy individual survivors and killer.
---
You can take screenshots with PC and both consoles.
---
Ghost face I‚Äôm all ears as a perk is amazing and he‚Äôs really fun to play
---
As someone who works with licensing in their career I can tell you it's very likely the ST team landed on a deal with a high % of royalties and the profit margin was retained by increasing the price.

---
Huntress comes with the base game now doesn't she? Only Freddy is DLC
---
Huh? You literally just put down some scenarios in which you play one character, but their passive is not useful in that certain situation, so you wish you'd picked the other character with a more appropriate passive. That's literally a gamble, because you don't know beforehand if it's going to be useful or not. Same with perks.
---
No need to get cute with me, btw. I never called *you* a moron, so there's absolutely no need to call me one because you didn't understand what I meant.
---
cha cha real smooth
---
yeah same, I mean it‚Äòs fookin steve from scoobs ahoi
---
Oh that's a PC issue, idk man. I'm on PS4 so I have no experience with text chat stuff.
---
Yeah! Just came out like 2 hours ago now
---
Leatherface for BBQ and Chilli and Hag for Ruin.
---
Fun killers I'd recommend would definitely be Ghostface
---
Another trash streamer wannabe. Went to check anyways, but didn't need to. Of course, nobody is watching him.
---
Hurry up and kiss her already!
---
Well, not my problem, sorry. Also, the boom was like months ago due to part 5. Still a lot of time to catch up.
---
Ohhhhh shit bhvr about to get my money
---
Yea Huntress was a free DLC from the beginning.
---
Awesome. Maybe a sale will start on the xbox after the ps4 sales ends. If nothing else, usually sales goes back up during hallowed blight for everyone.
---
I'm going to use left behind now.
---
It's there now
---
OHHHH SHIT babe about to get my money
---
Cant believe this took YEARS
---
Sounds like you suck cock.
---
Maps are and always have been free, no?
---
I expected it to be around ten bucks tbh, since $3.50 about the price of a survivor in *most* of the existing dlc. Feng, Jeff, Jane, etc.
---
It's not a lot more, but it's enough to make me scratch my head...
---
It's a Feelsbad when you're literally paying the same price in auric cells for one of them, after so many coming at a discounted price. That's all
---
I guess you haven't met a Daddy Myers build yet, farming PWYF stacks off the obsession and not letting anyone else get close to them.
---
That's how it is anyway "damn I wish I had borrowed" "damn I wish I had balanced"
---
This isnt new stuff dumb ass.
---
*that moment when you take the salt and pretend it isn't affecting you, so you take the conversation and pretend it's funny* 
---
Ok buddy. It's been fun. Ill let you as to no longer hurt you. In that way, I honor you.
---
I agree. It would look a lot better than whatever that is.
---
Hello Dio, I want to play a little game.
---
The rules of the game are simple: complete all 5 generators around the map and open the exit gate to find the location of Trapper.
---
But be careful, a reversed bear trap sits on your head, each time you complete a generator your timer will speed up. There are jigsaw boxes around the map, one contians a key.
---
A hex totem sits well hidden, to slow the game down, ^just ^a ^little ^bit.
---
So what will it be? Make your choice, let the game begin.
---
‚ÄúFail at life‚Äù relax moron it‚Äôs a game
---
That's me as Spirit when I get too immersed. My own husk gets me everytime.
---
DS also requires you to get picked up, and to hit a skill check. If I suspect someone has DS, they're staying on the ground. BT gives you the extra hit and the boost of speed if you need it. It also gives your teammates time to get in the way.
---
Borrowed works unless the killer is Insidious camping, or stealth camping like Pig or Ghostface. All three can usually be baited out. If the killer decides to go for the unhooking person, then there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean that BT is wasted, but rather it's discouraging the killer from tunneling.
---
I've seen both approaches work countless times, so it's really up to the person playing, but the only time I add DS to my loadout is when it's double BP.
---
I'm tryna do the achievements atm, feel like I'll never do Hemophobia tho
---
Good man
---
Didn‚Äôt get a DC, but I did get an angry message for playing The Ghost Face^tm and not Demogorgon.  I told them that The Ghost Face^tm just went on sale today so I literally just got him, but they didn‚Äôt seem to understand the concept of some people spending their money differently than others.
---
Weirdest part was that they were default Nea, not either of the new survivors.
---
Great contribution.
---
I guess it's kinda cool that I can give folks a genuine jump scare, I'm pretty sure I made a dwight crap themselves yesterday. Ran around like a mad fool for a few seconds (before escaping, haha).

I'm still kinda confused on the Freddy oblivious thing. So basically sleeping survivors won't know you are approaching them ever?
---
I honestly just figured I would have to wait until Halloween time lol
---
Ash and Ghostface come with cosmetics, presumably increasing their value over the other characters who are $3.50 in their dlc, even modern ones like Plague
---
8 meters per hit is completely and utterly broken for a perk with no downside.
---
that's fine, i just wanted to clarify.
---
So can every other video game.
---
No One Escapes Death üòèüòè
---
I started on PS4, but then I made the move over to PS4 and its just much more fun. I like the PC community more than the PS4... maybe its due to lack of post-game chat on PS4, but the only time someone messages you post-game is to be toxic.
---
I'd just recommend not buying all the DLC's right away maybe a DLC here or there and just aim for the perks/characters you want.
---
You can hear a different chase music as Michael and the Demogorgon but they aren't the same music the survivors hear when they are chased by them
---
Jokes aside I could see iFocus as a perk.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to him iv had plenty of people try and start something with me it‚Äôs best to ignore them say shut up and then not save him on hook just walk up and nod up and down at him
---
Forbidden FRIENDS
---
*Hehehehehehehe*
---
As it stands, this needs to be the default. Killers with small/no TR (Wraith, Myers, Pig) are basically immune to Borrowed Time entirely. Set it to ~24 Meters or so, and this won't be a problem.
---
Thank god they made the $10 pack 1100 lmao
---
That's bird chirping. Or maybe sicadas/grasshoppers. Not beeping.
---
Me: *sadly walks away and spares and accepts them  hoping one of the others that isn‚Äôt with them is willing to play ‚Äúsurvive a deadly threat‚Äù as usual because I personally want to play ‚Äúhunt them and kill them‚Äù but just can‚Äôt hurt them when they fuckin around with the fire*
---
I see a lot of p3 un yellow ranks so i feel Hes just bad
---
I'd say devour soap.
---
i was able to run on Ultra until the lighting rework then my game tanked
---
Feral Frenzy does apply on hit effects.
---
That was very nice of you. I'm a survivor main and I understand that sometimes your not gonna be so lucky. It's about trying and have fun and give the killer that fun too. Sounds weird but true.
---
Youve yet to show ANY evidence.
---
Xbox: anyone else not able to find a match at all?
---
I'd just turn chat off.
---
Could be boosted ? Idk tho with the dlc dropping today is Older players need to be a little patient and stop being dicks anyway
---
I actually think something like nurses or Discordance would work well. Especially Discordance, as with the portals(?), you can just go straight to the gen in question.
---
Is it called discordance? I've been playing for a whole ass year and a half now but I can't remember the names of some of these pwkrs, goddamn. The legion one-- you know what I'm on about
---
Is it even legion? I'm having a moment over here
---
Lasagna bitch: gain bloodlust 50% faster. "Running is futile, Jon."
---
Curiosity killed the cat: When a survivor searches a chest they become exposed for 60 seconds.
---
"That's my lasagna, Jon"
---
Nine lives: breaking pallets will not get rid of bloodlust stacks. "Bullets don't work, Jon"
---
I'm going to say make your choice, because say someone unhooked someone you hooked you can lunge at him and down them because demo lunge to good
---
This kinda seems like a different version of Furtive Chase.
---
Fixed an issue that allowed the killer to down survivors
---
Just go digging. I'm sure you can find plenty.
---
I've seen people use Furtive Chase with some success. I can't say Beast of Prey tho, but you don't exactly see people using that tho. You rather don't see it :D
---
Thank you friend!!
---
Freddy going back to his tunneling ways I see
---
You can switch to survivors POvV as killer?
---
I‚Äôd rather not devour a soap, they‚Äôre not that tasty imo
---
Has it always been there?
---
noed, ignore the cry babies on here
---
Tru
---
My friends are all yellow ranks and I have to remind myself not to get mad about all the dumb shit they do lol. I know not to bring in anything good, because any killer that is halfway decent will down them in 10seconds.
---
It's still very fun to play with them though.
---
Sorry, I meant god* as it was implied you view me that way
---
Yeah, Monto memes too much, and Puppers can be quite toxic, even if everyone think he isn't.
---
**oinks in hapiness**
---
Honestly a little shocked at the "Be glad it doesn't cost more" mentality, as that is absolutely the wrong take here.
---
If a company establishes a pricing scheme and then raises it, your first reaction should not be "Oh well that isn't so bad."
---
But just to appease them, I'll say golly gee wiz am I glad I didn't pay  $20 for what amounts to 2 survivor skins, a bunch of perks I can get free in the shrine, a map that is also free, and a new killer.
---
Especially when I can get all that for about $7. For the vast majority of the game's cast.
---
I don't mind supporting developers, but doing it without thinking leads to them taking advantage of you.
---
Yep.
---
What about devour Coke?
---
hmm maybe not the best ... flair...
---
While I‚Äôm in my 3-6 class :(
---
F
---
So make one player have a good perk and 1-3 people have a useless version (if all 4 players choose so to equip it)
---
Hey it's my number one fan stalking me
---
Why?
---
Nope. Needs more work.
---
Yeah. Still haven't played the new map. Sucks cause I want to try it out.
---
Cocaine? Sure
---
Yes coke is yummy
---
I really wish they found a way to use that sound effect. IIRC it's actually in the game files.

So it's basically still just a complete nerf since the old DL gave a 33% debuff on all survivors once the obsession was killed.
---
Why not just tweak it so that the debuff is still the same without having to tunnel the obsession to get any use out of it? Or shorten the stack cap and make the increase in debuff higher over the course of each stack to even it out while keeping the same debuff percentage before the nerf?

I'd like the DLC because i don't have much money at the moment, and i'd like to play the new characters, mostly demogorgon :)  
---
I may not get picked, but it's worth a shot. Good luck everyone!
---
Not gonna lie, it's one of my dreams as killer to catch a survivor this way by tricking them into thinking you're repairing. It's a terrible strategy but I want it to work just once
---
Oh dear god why are they ps2 graphics
---
I fucking love the temple of purgation, first time I‚Äôve seen it referred to as the shittiest map. I agree with you though I‚Äôm not playing on Hawkins as much as I thought I would, especially considering how many times we played on Badham when it was reworked.
---
As far as money-only killers? Either Freddy for fun, or Leatherface for some of the game's best perks. No question about it
---
I‚Äôm really glad they actually were on time with this dlc and coming out with it with so many changes and fixes don‚Äôt get me wrong, but honestly not having dedicated servers still was a big one for me. A man can hope.
---
Ill Never forget remember me, after all it told me not to

Not accurate, he didn't dramatically push up his glasses.

---
But do you really want to just work on gens for longer than 80 sec? What needs to change is survivors need another objective I find myself saying wow I‚Äôm being gen rushed but really that‚Äôs the only thing they have to especially if I haven‚Äôt hooked someone yet
---
Hmm, was thinking about picking this game up...rip
---
Oh, so I suppose you wouldn't mind if the devs up and decided to remove the Hex mechanic, making Ruin, Devour Hope, and NoED regular perks?
---
I mean, clearly perks having downsides has no place in DBD, so lets just brush off those limits.
---
$15.99 in Canada lol
---
Karma
---
Lmao I thought that was just me! Doctor too.
---
You should because ohido is pedo
---
I think that the first one is Freddy's one (England) because Freddy's original actor is named Robert Englund, so they made a pun about it, and kept naming the next chapters after countries after that.
---
Chapters before that are named "DLC\[Number\]" in the game files, while the new ones have Country Names (e.g. Mali for Demise of the Faithful, or Qatar for Stranger Things).
---
i played against him once and he was doing a super toxic build and in post game chat he was like "ggez be more salty survivors" when all i said was that it wasn't a very fun game.

You need to get leatherface/BBQ &amp; Chili

This is also again a liscensed pack

It's not just Demo

---
It's s alll of it it's pretty fair imo
---
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have the curtsy‚Äù
---
Yeah I want to find it on Myers :::(( and Huntress
---
Because before the update it applies a 33% in one shot. I understand the purpose of the changes being made.
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying though.
---
The new changes makes it arguably worse than thanataphobia for a lot of people. I'm not one of those people but not everyone that plays this plays it competitively either. The most "extreme' case only applies up to 30% where the DL pre nerf is 33%. This is going to be applied over time and give incentive to those using it not to intentionally camp the hook instead of looking for survivors or patrolling gens after the hook. As one SHOULD be doing. But they don't. 
---
What I'm suggesting is keeping the cap of 33% but lowering the stack cap on the perk from 11 down to idk, maybe 6 to 8 to actually make the perk worth using. As it stands now, it's ineffective to be used for anything other than meme builds against people who know how to play the game and play it well.
---
I love the temple part of the map, if it had only been maybe a larger version of the temple and a small courtyard it would have been great. But it‚Äôs far too big and lazily put together. But yeah I dunno I‚Äôve played well over a dozen matches today and still haven‚Äôt got Hawkins.
---
Hey asshole, the game just crashed back to desktop twice when I was hooking someone. You mean to tell me no one at Behavior noticed this? Is this going to be promptly fixed? You assholes always break something in these updates and I've had enough. This is shit that should have been easily caught before pushing out the update.
---
What if you could only enter lockers while exhausted, and have to leave when the timer ran out? My thought process is is that if you ran any of the exhausted perks you'd get noticed anyways, right? Head on, Dead Hard, all have to do with being exhausted, and if you're exhausted, you wouldn't notice anything. Also the no lockers stays only with the basement?   
---
Regardless i love it
---
Sorry lol. Realistically she would only be deadly on her own map. She relies on the element of surprise and if she knew her surroundings she'd have the upper hand.

I got a swift block straight after they sent this. Ironic he called me 12 when he sends people DMs like this on Twitter.

The difference is Rainbow Six isn't using licensed characters. Original DBD characters are available to purchase with shards.

It's an issue in a lot of games lately another big offender is Rainbow one of my best friends has been annoyed about this since 2015 when the game dropped
---
You paid $15 for this game. Its not that unreasonable for OPTIONAL DLC to be 11.99. If you don't like it, don't buy it. Literally that simple.
---
Play whoever you want and ignore the salt. They're probably people that get whatever they want from mommy and daddy.
---
Cuz there‚Äôs no solo survivor lobby anymore
---
This doesn't really solve the problem for low mobility killers though who at times don't have time to hit gens at all.
---
I had every killer and 2 survivors on PS4 at prestige 3 lvl 50 and I had no issue letting it go in favor of PC. The experience and performance is so much better.
---
Dwight Bieber :')
---
Secondary objectives would be great, I agree. Especially if they ACTUALLY contribute to the overall game time and goal. Right now, totems just mean points and that is it. They are a waste of time and the best survivors will completely ignore them unless they sense a NOED incoming and, even then, they'll just take note of where they saw dull totems.
---
Baby Dwight over here ordered two containers of bbq sauce. üòÇ
---
When I bought Ghost Face and Freddy last week there wasn't a download for either one, they were just unlocked once I opened the game up
---
Oh ok, but its still slightly annoying but hey thats worth it i guess
---
Can we talk about how they reused Ash's face from promotional material of his
---
The DLC is downloaded in the patch, buying it just unlocks it
---
There shouldn‚Äôt be anything to download, they‚Äôll just be available in the game :)
---
Shouldn't matter if they are licensed. If it does, then they shouldve never put them in the game.
---
That might actually be one of the best ideas for dc's ive heard. Maybe not an hour but half bloodpoints for the next 1/2/3 games depending on how often they do it. Or else people will just dc on their last game of the night. Or not play for a bit and not face any repercussion.
---
Oh okay then

I must play oddly specific games because I don't play any that don't require steam to be open outside of FFXIV, but that uses steam to open another launcher lol

It's out on all platforms. It cost $11.99.
---
Wtf is an ochdo?
---
I was personally always annoyed that there were ‚Äúplay survivor‚Äù and a ‚Äúsurvive with friends‚Äù options when the latter could also be used to play solo
---
I‚Äôm glad they merged them together
---
As killer, I'd ban Balanced Landing over Adrenaline. Nothing fucking kills me more than getting a bullshit map, which is pretty much every map not named Shelter Woods, and getting fucked even further, by a Balanced Landing infinite. I have to give up the gen in that spot because I'll never be able to threaten it.
---
But I agree with the DS ban. Getting to tunnel a survivor to death before 3 gens pop really lessens the load as killer. Or being able to cut down a strong looper instead of letting them get away and heal because they're invincible for a minute is also really freeing.
---
And as survivor, I'm obviously going to ban Ruin and then I guess I'd pick Sloppy Butcher. Neither is unbearable for me personally, but both absolutely fuck over my teammates. You'd think that higher ranks would know how to hit Ruin checks, but nope. They're either regressing my gen, running into the killer trying to find the totem, or Self-caring through Sloppy Butcher. Fuck that noise.
---
It is on console, I‚Äôm on Xbox so I am not 100% sure about PlayStation but I haven‚Äôt seen anything saying otherwise
---
At least on PS4, that‚Äôs been resolved. Now after a match, you simply hit ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù and it returns you to the lobby with your mates. It‚Äôs really nice!
---
No perk survivors DUH... And no perk PTB? That has about 0 value as an argument. Survivors don't need perks (unless it's borrowed time for camping killers) to play. Nurse doesn't need them either I guess. Other killers? Yeah good luck with no perk wraith vs good survivors.

Why exactly was Surges range returned to the actual useful 32 meters but now got it's reduction effect nerfed? Even with 32 meters and 12% reduction it's barely a mid-tier perk. Like this it's just garbage.

100% worth it.

Not sure why you'd base your future in thr game on *one* game, but that's up to you.

I'm thinking PWYF, bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring, with unlimited T3 and increased stalk speed

Yeah. I moved over from stuff like Overwatch which allows you to close the launcher once it was done, so I figured I could close Steam while Dead by Daylight was running.
---
Bad idea, but at least I know not to do that now. lmao
---
Then shut the fuck up and don't buy it. It's a huge license with three characters instead of two. They didn't get it for free. It's more than a normal chapter therefore it costs more than a normal chapter.

thank g o d
---
&gt;***Don't be a dick.*** That's about it, it'll cover everything.
---
While obviously well-meaning, this is actually terrible advice. What qualifies as "being a dick" is not remotely clear when you're a new player, especially one who's only been playing half the game (i.e., Killer only).
---
Here's a little more specific advice I hope the OP will find helpful:
---
First, this is probably the most important advice I can give you: Before you start a match, *know what your goals are*. In other words, what's most important to you? Achieving a 4K (killing all Survivors)? Maximizing the Bloodpoints you earn and/or ranking up? Maximizing the iridescent shards you earn? Providing the Survivors with a fun and enjoyable match? Improving your skills in a particular aspect of the game? Unlocking a particular achievement? Completing a daily? All of these are valid options, and each will suggest different play styles. (Personally, I typically aim for winning as my primary goal, which I consider to be killing at least 3 Survivors, but I try to do it in a way that still allows the Survivors to have some fun; I don't really worry about Bloodpoints, but if I see an opportunity to grab some extra without interfering with my main goals, I'll take it.)
---
Coming as a close second: ***Play both Killer and Survivor.*** If you only play half the game, you only understand half the game‚Äîand the half you don't understand has a huge impact on the half you actually play. Understanding what Survivors see and hear and when, how they move, what their instincts tell them to do in a chase, what they do when they first spawn, how their perks work, etc... All of this is almost essential to being an effective Killer. (And vice-versa for Survivors, of course.) Finally, if you *want* to try to "not be a dick," that's basically impossible to judge without having an understanding of how different tactics feel from the other side.
---
Also, watch experienced streamers/YouTubers and learn from them. I mainly recommend Otzdarva and PainReliever. They're both red ranks, both pretty chill, and both explain in detail what they're doing and why.
---
Circling back to how to "not be a dick," here are some things that are generally frowned upon by a large portion of the community:
---
**Camping**
---
As a Survivor, it's pretty easy for a little bad luck to result in getting downed in the first 30 seconds of a match. If the Killer camps the hook, you probably won't get rescued unless you're playing with an organized &amp; experienced group of friends. Dying on hook takes 2 full minutes, during which time the hooked player can't do anything in game, not even spectate. 
---
Getting camped once kinda sucks, but it's not that big a deal. But a streak of bad luck can result in this happening repeatedly. On a bad day, you can easily spend most of an afternoon "playing" this game while spending virtually no time able to actually play. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much fun do you think that is? ***Zero.*** It is zero fun. And the point of playing a game is to have fun, so if you are actively working to prevent the other players from having fun... You're kind of being a dick.
---
From the Killer standpoint, the counterargument to this is that the point of playing Killer is to kill, and that "camping is a legitimate strategy." Both true, but *camping isn't a very good strategy* in most situations. It takes 2 minutes for someone to die on hook, and less than a minute and a half for each Survivor to complete a generator if you leave them unmolested. So by camping you're potentially giving up more than half the generators in order to secure one single kill. Unless the Survivors are potatoes, you're unlikely to exceed a 2K (2 kills) by camping, which isn't even a win‚Äîit's a tie.
---
The other downside to this strategy is that for that entire two minutes, *you*'re not really getting to play either. It's not much fun, and you're missing out on the opportunity to use that time to get better at the game. If you're new, sometimes camping feels like the only way you can actually get a kill or two. And it might be, in the short run, at the early ranks. But in the long run, you're basically shooting yourself in the foot by denying yourself the opportunity to get better at the game so that you can achieve 3 and 4K's. You'll have a hard time ranking up from camping, and if you do, you'll find yourself facing Survivors you don't have the skills necessary to even catch.
---
That said, there can be situations where camping is effective. Have Survivors been hook diving (going immediately for a save instead of waiting for a bit for the Killer to go away)? One of the cardinal rules of playing Killer is you go where the Survivors are, so if you're pretty sure the Survivors are either at the hook or about to be at the hook, staying by the hook is smart (arguably not even really camping, though Survivors who play this way will probably still try to accuse you of it). Are the exit gates open? As a Killer, the best way to find Survivors is to patrol objectives, and the only objective left for them is the unhook and the exit. Since it's (nearly) impossible to catch people near the gates once they're open, from a purely strategic standpoint camping is sometimes the best move you can make at this point.
---
Personally, I *usually* don't camp even after the gates are open. If I can't get my kills in without camping, I just didn't play well enough, and I'd generally rather take my lumps and work to get better than be a dick just to secure a kill. But this is my personal choice and, frankly, depends on my mood and how the game went otherwise. 
---
**Tunneling**

The kissing cousin of camping. Exactly what this means kinda depends who you ask. The strictest definition is that it means literally doing nothing but obsessively trying to kill one specific Survivor‚Äîlike you have tunnel vision and ignore everything else. The more liberal usage refers to basically any time you actively go after someone immediately after they get unhooked, so you can immediately re-hook them again, rapidly "tunneling" them through the three stages of the sacrifice.
---
By the looser definition, this can often be the fastest way to get a Survivor killed, so there's an argument for it being a smart strategy. But like camping, the (strategic) problem with tunneling is it means you're putting little or no pressure on the other Survivors‚Äîleaving them to rapidly work on objectives unmolested. And like camping, it basically results in totally preventing another player from getting to actually play the game, so it's considered a dick move.
---
Personally, when unhooks occur, I always go after the rescuer *if I see them* (unless I have a good reason not to, like they're my STBFL obsession). If I don't see the rescuer, I go after whoever I do find‚Äîand if that's the person who just got unhooked, well, sometimes we all have bad luck. Rotating targets like this results in a more enjoyable experience for everyone, and spreading the pressure around has strategic value as well: Chase the unhooked, and that's one person off gens while the other 3 get back to work. Chase the rescuer, and the unhooked will likely go find someone to heal them. That's potentially 3 people off gens.
---
**Teabagging &amp; General BM-ing**
---
BM, in this context, is an abbreviation for "bad manners"‚Äînot, er, anything else. Basically, this is anything that has no strategic value that you do just to annoy other players (outside of potentially pissing them off enough that they play poorly, which, let's be honest, can work but is still a dick move). On the Survivor end, it includes things like teabagging at the Killer, excessive pointing, and excessive flashlight clicking. On the Killer side, it's mainly beating on people who are already hooked or doing things like faking that you're going to give the last Survivor the hatch but then closing it in front of them at the last second.

---
Play with a headset on like everyone else.
---
Its your graphics settings genius
---
Cleansing is deliberately a bad strategy, making it a requirement to use exhaustion perks is like making someone choose between eating a shit salad or a piss pie.
---
&gt; Doctor has that for madness, huntress has a minute long exhaustion after hatchets, clown only needs to gas you for exhaustion 
---
Yes, but at least those are on some sort of timer, or there is an easy counter which doesn't screw over you and your entire team. Cleansing your sickness pretty much gives an instadown to a survivor or two of their choosing, whilst no other killer exaustion addons do this.

Imagine having to rationalize a $12 purchase of anything.  If you have to ask if a $12 purchase is "worth it" you may need to rethink your life's priorities.
---
I think this happens to every new player. I loved this game when I first started but was getting a ton of toxic games for days and got so upset and came to the subreddit for advice.
---
Believe it or not, the toxicity comes in waves usually around rank reset or double blood point events. It might be a few more days of toxicity but it should even out. My games have been pretty nice for a few weeks but im due for a toxic shit fest.
---
It is 100% worth it to keep playing, maybe take a break for a few days if its getting to you. Believe it or not it'll get better, I was in your shoes a few months ago.
---
Shit dude you're awesome, I've had a concept I wanted to put into picture for a long time now you're a lifesaver.
---
The pluses are supposed to be there but my game is CURSED and all my VOID people have no plusses
---
*Head explodes*
---
why didn't you just boot up your console and check lol
---
Where‚Äôs ghost face
---
Micheal at A he‚Äôs low B tier at best I think but Freddy with oblivious is slowly becoming more popular
---
tried it all lol, could be a heating issue
---
Also just look at that straight nerf to dying light. It was sorta good when it got activated before but now it's just bad. By the time you have any kind of acceptable percentage you are already winning and two survivors at the least are dead, meaning you are only applying the debuff to a single person. Meanwhile the obsession get's a giant buff for the free and you get railroaded into leaving them alone to make the best use of that buff the whole match.
---
Three other people already answered you, but yeah, Oblivious hard counters BT because BT takes the unhooker being in the terror radius into account in order to work, not the unhookee.
---
What that means, gameplay wise, is that if you're running BT against Freddy and he's close to a hooked survivor you have to (1) wake yourself up by any means before going for them if you're asleep; (2) be extra careful not to get hit by Freddy before unhooking, otherwise you'll be immediately put to sleep and BT won't proc if you unhook them after being hit. Basically it's a lot more risky and those one-for-ones BT saves aren't really possible against him anymore.
---
(It can still be done say in an endgame scenario with more than one survivor crowding the hook and someone baiting a hit for someone else to BT save.)
---
Makes me think of Vicki from the 2018 reboot
---
Also play Dwight, theres a bigger chance people will be nice to you, but its not gaurenteed.
---
1. Nowhere in the perk's description does it say that.
---
2. Legion's power is consistent in what it applies. It applies all on-hit effects, but is nonlethal.
---
3. Losing Killer Instinct is totally fine. Because you're now a 115% killer who not only has no terror radius, but doesn't have his stealth restricted by anything, people now need to *heal against Legion*, which extends the game massively.
---
4. Literally just run Whispers.

Smart of them. Entice all the Stranger Things fans to come over, get a feel for the game, then want to purchase it and the ST DLC once the free play is over.
---
It could completely break the basement. A team where everyone has it means nobody could be hooked there. And nobody with it could unhook anyone there, meaning if you're there and all 3 other players have it, you're boned.

Just add a secondary object that isn't "hold M1 on something else"

Exactly I feel the same but they saved me
---
Watching everyone talk about the DLC while I‚Äôm 8 hours away from my PC on work.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôm all ears show the aura AFTER the action, therefore you wouldn‚Äôt see the survivor go in the locker? 
---
This calls for a test on KYF.
---
Neither one of those are remotely useful. Not even for that. 
---
Tinkerer warns you that a gen is near done, but unless you were right there, you aren't going to stop the repair. The terror radius dropping is nice, but it requires you to intentionally throw the game to get it to work.
---
Dark Devotion requires you to adopt a hit-and-run playstyle around your obsession, but if you ditch an injured obsession, chances are, they'll run to a teammate with the terror radius on them. That's 2 people not getting tricked by a silent killer.
---
Those perks do jackshit for sneaking on people. If anything, Tinkerer is good for shutting down a near-finished gen, and Dark Devotion is for causing confusion when the obsession scares their teammates. And those perks don't even do that very well.
---
Yep that's the idea. Every other token perk in the game can lose tokens because the benefit they give is applied against every survivor, this perk's downside is that it's a granular effect on each survivor. Meaning to get this to full power, a the average killer needs 16 total basic attacks across everyone which takes a significant amount of time.   
---
Also, Fire up, remember me, and furtive chase are all non hex perks that have tokens which cannot be removed, so the precedent for them exists.  
---
Also, remember that 0 terror radius is not as strong as most people think of it as. Tier 1 Myers is so powerful because of his 0 Terror radius, and his wall hacks. Meaning he can see survivors before they can see him allowing for easy jumpscares. Now when was the last time you were legitimately worried about a wraith or pig sneaking up on you? They have zero Terror radius so shouldn't they be quite strong? Well they aren't really, and that's because survivors facing them can be looking around to see the killer before they can arrive. Its nice to have no terror radius, but even tier one Myers harshly suffers on open maps with nowhere to obstruct his sight line to the survivors. All in all 0 Terror radius is a benefit, but I think people are giving it a lot more credit than it deserves.
---
Being different is the sole reason Pennywise would overshadow The Clown because everything the clown has sucks

from what i saw 40% off all dlc except the demo

You're more worked up over this than I am dude. Thanks for your uh input.
---
Why didn't BHVR consider using survivors shape instead of this 3 scumbags? It would make so much more sense to have a Dwight, a Meg and a Neat or whatever other survivors they wish
---
Steve‚Äôs perks are trash. Go Nancy or Demogorgon.
---
You have to save to get 7 euro?

I'm not even gonna buy the thing and I still feel left out

You did. So you solved your own question yet still ranted.
---
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
its..  its like theres more content than usual in it or something
---
Save 7 euros? So you skipped one McDonalds meal?
---
The rest of DLCs costed 6.99
---
Two survivors in this dlc though so I don't think it's uncool to charge more :o
---
Seriously I always want to do this but never know exactly where to stand, 
---
maybe someone can put a map or something so we know the relative area to stand
---
No but you get the point
---
I've been in that situation on both sides. I've had people disconnect on me leaving one guy, so I let them do gens and drop pallets on me. Vice versa with me as the survivor. We want to have fun until a few people ruin it for others.
---
I dunno...3, 4...
---
Maybe 5.
---
Plus, he was playing with friends
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
There's three characters in it, it's definitely going to cost more
---
You‚Äôd like Fungoose.  Very informative
---
Oh thank youu !
---
Considering we've crossed over the $100 mark to own the entire game design - I wouldn't call it the most fair pricing ever seen unless you've not been gaming for long. Not to say the price is bad in comparison to the rest of DBD DLCs, but overall cost is starting to get a little out of hand.
---
Same here
---
Intuitive puzzles don't seem to be BI's strongest suit.
---
I‚Äôm comparing it to another popular game. The intend in any game is to earn money. But there‚Äôs a difference between a cheap dlc and an expensive skin.
---
So no, I‚Äôm sorry. But the DLC is cheap and I don‚Äôt think anyone should complain about the price
---
Where can I get this?
---
They are being unreasonable. Never try and reason with the unreasonable. 
---
Buncha butts. Play whatever you want. By that logic - they should be playing the new survivors with only the new perks! :p
---
Damn, you guys are getting cucked on console, on pc, on LOW settings

They're all dotty but it seems like to be a bug because some of the survivor's hair is also like that
---
Thats not a solution.
---
Oh man I can‚Äôt wait to get home from school to turn on my Xbox to see that the game is still updating
---
The performance alone is worth the switch IMO. I switched after a few months or so and wasn‚Äôt happy about the grind but so worth it in the end.

so playing in a way that makes someone not have fun with a video game deserve the punishment of death. i hope i got whooshed

Unfortunately, ranks were just reset so low ranks are filled with people who usually wouldn‚Äôt be there. Please don‚Äôt let them get to you, just report their messages and keep having fun with the game!
---
The survivors listed are original ones they don't have to pay a licensing fee to another company to use. 
---
1. Licensed content means more expensive
---
2. 3 new characters. That's $4 a character. Still very reasonably priced.

Yes liberals ruining games is the lesson to be learned here, not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being an asshole and people don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù
---
Ah thank you, just picked a bad time to start playing I guess. It's a great game minus the pressure now from higher ranks watching me, will definitely keep playing!
---
The Killer has more "raw power," but the Survivors have numbers, time, and many environmental features on their side. A Killer's power is generally pretty easy to use‚Äîat least in a rudimentary way‚Äîwhile coordinating a team and making use of the environment takes a fair bit of experience. Playing either role *well* takes quite a bit of skill, but when there's little skill on either side, the Killer's raw power puts them at an advantage. 
---
From what I've seen, the result of this is that the game is generally Killer-biased in the double digit ranks, and increasingly Survivor-biased as you move into the single digit ranks.
---
*-laughs in Hag with Dried Cicada-*
---
Woah an additional 5$ for twice the content we normally get for these dlcs? So scummy!
---
When she uses DS, instead of a shard of glass she stabs the killer with her jaw.
---
Gloating is half your movement
---
I'm legit horrible with Demogorgon. I don't get it! He's seems easy enough, I watched people playing as him, was familiar with the powers... But I haven't gotten 1 kill and have depipped my killer rank in to yellow as I'm frustratingly trying to figure it out. WTF
---
Dude what the frick this doesn‚Äôt even make sense from a swf standpoint
---
You can also view the store in a swf too which is also great
---
I'm not sure what 3 years of release matters to the game cost? Plenty of games can be bought on steam right now for less that have been out for longer and includes all content. Pricing for new DLCs seems fair but the older ones could definitely use a price drop after 3 years.
---
Grunts of pain have a limit on how far you can hear them.
---
Most survivors don't even run Iron will because you don't spend that much time near the killer and not in a chase, or near safety.
---
No mither having the 50% reduction is fine as it is, although an x% walking speed bonus would be nice
---
Bts
---
You shut the fuck up too
---
I decide to equip slippery meat and escape from your trap even though that‚Äôs not even how the perk works
---
It doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been like that all day for me. Making the matches way to easy and no longer fun
---
Did you escape though?
---
Damn, you should make a sub for all the cool kids for maximum c o m e d i c v a l u e
---
whats with all the people whining pretty sure anyone with some common sense would think 3 characters would be more expensive
---
Freddy is pretty good now with oblivious he was good before but the fact that he‚Äôs even more unpredictable is better
---
Glad I'm not the only one who does this. BHVR seriously needs to implement a bad player lobby like almost every other PvP online game.
---
yeah sorry probably should have said that
---
Shut the fuck up
---
This makes my heart happy.
---
Yep with all 5 gens powered up as well through the exit gates.
---
It‚Äôs probably because of all the new players and rank reset

As soon as you hook, take a single step to your left. Boom you're in camera shot
---
Cram it meat bag!
---
Same. Don't feel like you gotta play with salty people like that. My name on steam is Cammon if you need another player. (I've got a bunch of tf2 stuff on my profile picture is of a guy standing on a building.)
---
leave
---
I see it as an overall buff. It was not the healthiest perk basically requiring you to mori or Hard tunnel one person to play the game normally. 
---
This version is definitely win-more. After 4-5 tokens you‚Äôre basically set but now it has combo potential with Thanatopobia, Furtive Chase, STBFL along with Sloppy or PGTW, the obsession can have an unhook and heal buff, that repair penalty is what I‚Äôm here for.
---
You have to buy them or they'll keep reappearing.
---
Guh. Surge going from 12% to 8%? Not sure if excited about perk now.
---
I'm gonna guess you were never a World of Warcraft player lol. That game cost multiple hundreds of dollars to get into. Rainbow 6 is another example, it's like 30$ and you either grind out the remaining 26+ operators or you buy them with irl money. BHVR is the last company I'm going to call out for scummy business tactics when companies like EA, The Coalition, and Blizzard are doing significantly worse
---
Doo doo doodoo

thank you for reply, i am playing main survivor actually mainly the shape, and which perks and which killers i need to use i do not know actually i am noob with that lol.

This expansions new map is beautiful, the sounds and effects of the demogorgon are amazing and you get 2 survivors instead of 1. I think the quality of this expansion deserves my money.

Happened to me the other day. Survivors just shat on me the whole match it was actually pretty funny even for me. Then once they (all) got away, they started to trash talk me in the chat. But once they noticed my low-ass rank they actually started apologizing a little (not too much)
---
Is the Hallowed Blight skin on Hillbilly broken for anyone else? Mine is completely missing (Not technically correct- it appears in my shop and gives me the option to equip it, but this does nothing and the items are missing in my appearance tab) and if the patch fucked it up irreversibly, can I have my auric cells back?

Pretty Sure

Haha nice! I got Surveillance on 2 (which I‚Äôm pretty happy about), and haven‚Äôt gone up to 3 yet (playing Steve rn, and DemoGoodBoy is getting the scraps that get left over after Stevey levels up)
---
Ho shit!! This would be so epic! Who would be the killer ??
---
What did they do to Steve‚Äôs face :(
---
Uhhhhh how long does it take you to back out one screen? Sounds to me like you're calling one click and a 2 second load time "tedious"....
---
yeah I won't even lie, I hesitate with palettes when facing her lol
---
Fixed an issue that allowed The Pig to be remotely fun to play
---
Agreed.
---
Well they're usually $8 and come with 2 characters, so $4 per character. By that logic DLC with 3 characters should be $12 since its $4 per character; seems perfectly reasonable to me.
---
Freddy buff?!
---
Okay the head bang is new to me and hilarious.
---
gotta flex
---
So glad PS4 doesn‚Äôt have a chat.
---
1. I like to avoid being wordy, but it can be extended if it's really a problem. 
---
2. Alright, however there's no reason why it couldn't be an exception if it did prove to be too powerful in testing
---
3. So other than having to uncloak, whats the difference between a fully stacked m1 killer and a wraith? Yes not having to uncloak is strong, but there is counterplay by just looking around to spot the killer before they find you. Since it would take significant time to reach full strength, it should be stronger than the average perk.
---
4. Whispers helps you locate survivors, but it doesn't stop them from seeing you when you locate them. Tier  1 Myers is very weak when he cannot abuse wall hacks to get the jump on survivors. This would be subject to the same weaknesses.
---
I did both the solo gen and the upside down room by myself and got the challenge the first game on that map so not sure how you didn‚Äôt get it. Still not sure which one counted though.
---
You can now have up to FOUR Perks active on the Bloodweb, and choose up to TWO per Bloodweb.
---
Maybe stop skipping over the Perks you don‚Äôt like, and just buy them so they stop appearing? It‚Äôs literally that easy.
---
I have almost every Perk on Hag. With the Bloodweb Changes, I‚Äôm pretty much guaranteed to unlock any new Perks I buy off the shrine, and still get a nice selection with each web.
---
This sounds like a YOU problem, not BHVR.
---
His new ultra rare lets you play Hag instead /s
---
Your guess would be correct - never got into MMOs in general. No R6 either after it went away from the more tactical planning shooter aspects of the former series entrants.
---
At least with Blizzard I never needed to buy their lootcrates to get all the skins I wanted that has no change on overall game design. Just because EA might be worse doesn't mean you should just take it from companies that aren't ducking you over as hard as the worst offenders are.
---
this is amazing.
---
Idk y i got negative but the one who did give it a thumbs down probably is one of the toxic claudettes that i was talkin about
---
Alternate killer skin Nermal
---
but my first perks are always something like Unrelenting üòîüòîüòî
---
This trailer paints the movie as either a cliche or too busy for its own good, the monster element seems out of place, while the human antagonist(s) seem more intriguing despite being crazy old man in a rural town who‚Äôs harboring dark secrets which has been done to death, and a biker gang??? What
---
Yeah, i need to become a  nurse main to be relevant, cuz low mobility killers on these map wont even reach a gen before 2 gens pop XD 
---
silly me for playing anything else than nurse
---
Fair enough.
---
Welcome to dead by daylight!
---
Except those aren‚Äôt being powered by AT LEAST 500 lbs of muscle and rage.
---
Just like Autodidact. This is intentional. The time it takes wasn‚Äôt intended to be reduced by great skill checks.
---
The game is already stale as hell for survivors. Nine times out of ten you know what you're getting. No one runs anything exciting or out of the ordinary anymore as a killer.
---
Ruin? BBQ? Pop? Sloppy? Nurses? Whispers? Wow. I'm utterly shocked.   It makes every match stale.
---
Then you have generators that are already so fucking boring to work on.  You seriously feel like even without ruin. You're on those things forever. 
---
Generator stalling is at an ALL time best for killers. Killers have gotten SOOOO many generator perks now. 
---
And I'd wager this is why wait times for killer are getting worse too. Because more and more survivors are just giving up playing. The game has become so oppressive towards the one and only true objective for survivors. 
---
Especially against high mobility killers with insane map pressure like Spirit, Hillbilly, Nurse, hell even new Freddy and Demogorgon with Pop and Ruin? Can be an utter pain and just not fun to go against.
---
The answer to fixing generator progression isn't slowing down generators more,  it's not adding more generator perks, it's actually looking at the survivor objective as a whole and changing it or adding to it.
---
That's funny, I don't *see* two killers.
---
Maybe you mean because Demogorgon has two powers?
---
Such an original response.
---
I did the upside down room twice with a friend partially helping and the solo gen we took turns completing.
---
Sorry man, but don‚Äôt worry, we all get lucky sometime
---
*Plays new killer*
---
*Gets Dark Sense*
---
‚ÄúThanks Mr. Entity...‚Äù *sighs*
---
I‚Äôm not familiar with the issue. Could you explain?
---
Pick the battles here man. You gonna fight against the entire industry or the big companies that are inspiring all the others to do this shit? Bhvr isnt encouraging other companies to use this model with their game, they arent as influential like EA and Blizzard are. You can call our BHVR sure, but they arent the root of this problem.
---
it‚Äôs resembling the open-mouthed demogorgon bc it‚Äôs mouth opens to look like a flower
---
I never played MMOs WoW and complained about their predatory pricing often as well. Just because there are worse offenders doesn't make the lesser offenders justified.
---
i hate getting survivor perks for my killers
---
Oh sorry, double survivors, didn't realize I needed to be that specific with you when you already know whats in the DLC but glad i could clarify
---
That makes sense to me based on the console pricing scheme, it's very strange that the dlc is cheaper on PC.
---
I mean idk how much the clown weighs
---
Hmm, interesting. Thanks!
---
The Humble is made for discounts/specials/etc, and they still get a small deduction for that ~10% taken off.
---
Just wait a little bit. It‚Äôs new, so they don‚Äôt want to throw it on sale IMMEDIATELY
---
You piece of interdimensional garbage. I wish ruin wasnt so necessary.
---
Lmaoooo.
---
Some people are dicks. I've gotten mad at people (even when playing against them) for making big mistakes just to realize they are low level. As you get better, it will happen less and you will be getting more frustrated with others poor choices than they get with you lol. There are always gonna be the people who want the whole game to revolve around their playstyle, you can ignore or laugh at them and enjoy the game. Overall, it's good people here, survivors can get mob mentality at higher ranks, so if you play killer you gotta enjoy some stress there while you are learning and if you aren't playing God tier killer builds. The game doesn't always have huge matchmaking pools so you'll often find yourself in less than fair skill level matchup. When that happens just use the experience to see where you need to improve or if you are the higher skill player, help the others to improve.
---
The matchmaking kinda sucks for me aswell as that
---
it didnt look like this on PTB, I played Jake during PTB and it didnt look like this at all
---
Erm... Bitter Murmur. That‚Äôs the bitch
---
Would be pretty cool to have a convict as a survivor, whose perks were all killer perks reinvented as survivor perks
---
Make them *B L E E D*
---
Let that thing just mutilate her white ass and leave!
---
Which platform
---
It really wouldn't be the same perk if it had a time limit. This is a late game perk that takes considerable time to build up to full power by hitting each survivor.   
---
Adding a timer would mean that a killer would hit someone, then immediately have to hunt them to benefit from the perk, but having a low or no terror radius is effective because the survivor cant be sure if they are being hunted. A timer would remove that uncertainty and just lead to survivors running to upon ground and healing for the next 120 seconds. The perk would have almost no impact and be far to weak to warrant a perk slot.

I want the new killer to be i figure representing walmart and the survivors being literally any other store representative
---
While I agree, I really doubt Behavior has the wherewithal or innovation necessary to actually improve the base game for the survivor side :( They just keep adding more "hold M1" objectives instead of looking at things like F13 and considering "hey, maybe we should make things more interactive or add some puzzle style objectives". Just something, anything. 
---
And I don't want to buff anything for Nurse or high tier killers, I just want to be be able to play Pig without having to run Ruin and still have gens pop like Candy. I want a longer, more fun and dynamic experience for both sides.
---
Believe me, you are preaching to the choir, I play survivor WAAAAAY more often to the point I just get bored of playing red ranks because it is Nurse/Billy/Spirit central.
---
I dc right be4 the mori if i get tunneled because they be ran a mori and tunneled they dont deserve to extra 400 bp and cool animation + achievement progress just cause they wanted to be a dick

---
You don't I've had multiple newer survivors the past couple days who just sat in a locker and they had a noise notification along with the crows
---
Why fight when you can educate consumers instead? I stopped buying EA a long time ago because they are clearly worse. Blizzard got my 30 bucks and I've never given them more for Overwrach so I can't really complain there - but none of that implies BHVR is the root of the problem.

---
Yes it is.
---
For killer, buy bubba so you can get BBQ &amp; Chili.
---
Honestly with survivors, you start out with most of the best perks in the game. Off the bat, you have access to Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Self Care, Bond, WGLF, Borrowed Time, Urban Evasion, Iron Will, etc. The main ones you are missing is Decisive Strike, Deliverance, and Lithe
---

That change actually sucks. You should not have to show your rank since there is no unranked mode.
---
It didn't look specifically like this in ptb. When I switched to jake, a cosmetic that had facial hair looked terrible. (I play the game on low settings though. Might've been that which caused it to look different for me). Looked fine in live, so I just assumed they would've looked at his hair overall since, for me, there were issues
---
This was an extremely specific scenario
---
This is wholesome dbd
---
I agree - during the events the games take longer when there are additional objectives.
---
almost like dedicated servers are something that need to be tested longer then people are willing to find out how the new perks/killer work.
---
It's to be expected with this game
---
I'm rank 13 as killer, been getting matched with rank 4-7 every game lmao
---
I‚Äôm not sure why but I‚Äôve been robbed of my Adept Nancy trophy twice now on PS4. ):
---
Same dude first game on had steves 3 perks on and escaped and didn‚Äôt get it
---
You are limited to 2 perks when 4 are on the web. The Entity will immediately grab the 4th perk when you take your 2nd perk (3rd perk overall) for that web  even when it has a trail to follow.
---
You should learn how to take a joke

I love me some STANGER THINGS

when michael with 3 stacks of play with your food, spirit fury, bamboozle and brutal strenght pops tier 3 on you for the first time on the entire game after not hooking anyone for the whole game
---
*wheeeeeze*
---
That explains why ive 4K‚Äôd my first three games. I‚Äôm not even THAT good as Killer lmao
---
The fact that Ghostface can crouch in an instant and The Pig can't is hilarious
---
Back off would kill end game camping
---
Someone didn‚Äôt play during the year of the dog event

If you force players to play with like ranks with no alternative besides KYF, the player base will shrink. Second option seems ok.
---
It amazes me how the people in charge of this don't check if they made any spelling errors lol
---
This actually seems really balanced
---
I know this feeling
---
Is bloodwarden a good perk?
---
Looks like he almost shit himself too lmao, that wild swing of the mouse as he hits you makes me laugh
---
You have to do more than just escape
---
Yeah, really sucks. I usually apologize if I accidentally tunnel/camp. Those guys suck.
---
Pickin up ghost face
---
I understand that this is an ultra rare addon, but this completely disabled Borrowed Time, Stake  Out and Diversion. Because Freddy‚Äôs Lullaby doesn‚Äôt count as a terror radius anymore, a survivor could load into a trial with 1 or even no perks (in the case of adrenaline). I understand that Freddy players now have a harder time using Unnerving Presence, Overwhelming Presence, Distressing, Infectious Fright,  and Coulrophobia (not to mention, I have no clue how the lullaby works with Tinkerer, Dark Devotion, Monitor and Abuse, or Furtive Chase). At the very least, Freddy can come into the trial knowing the disadvantage. A Tapp could load into the game planning to fight ruin,  use a cheeky diversion, and get clutch saves with an endgame health state and not have access to any of them until he is hooked and then saved or if someone else uses Decisive Strike, meaning THAT person got hooked, unhooked, and tunneled.

It must be so frustrating to play with newer players, I didn't realise how often ranks reset &amp; how there such a mix of players. There have definitely been (most) matches where I've gone 'yeah my bad that was poorly played' but this one didn't go that badly all things considered. Guess unless I totally screwed someone else over or was a dick to the killer, I wasn't expecting shitty messages
---
This right here. A new chapter comes. More memes can be made. Marvelous truly marvelous
---
lol ok sorry for trying to have fun?
---
Yeah, if it started with one token and once the perk is used it‚Äôs gone, and gain another each time a survivor is sacrificed
---
Theres nothing to educate consumers about dude. People know this stuff already, and they willingly spend their money anyways. Not only that, but the people you might educate on the topic arent the big players on the board. It's the whales that will spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars purely for cosmetics, it simply adds fuel to the money hungry fire. The people who are most involved in the MTX plague know fully well how and why it works, but you will be disappointed if you think a mass boycott is going to happen. Even EA is still afloat after their countless instances of blatant player explotiotation. Its just like vegetarians that think the meat industry will die because they stopped buying it themselves
---
Ah, Dead By Daylight. Never change.
---
The game is currently FreeToPlay, so everyone might as well get used to this before the timeframe ends.
---
Ha! Be careful of that at higher ranks - sometimes survivors will bait you into a T3 activation knowing (or being confident) that they can loop you until it runs out.
---
Always gotta be thinking of those mindgames, haha.
---
As killer you are frequently gonna be facing some players who think you deserve to be shit on just cuz you're playing killer. There are lots of players who aren't total douches though also, you'll have matches where you run around with the survivors playing cat and mouse and both sides enjoying it, that is where the game shines in my eyes. Learning to outplay good competition takes a lot of effort and is what would keep playing killer. I think any good killer will also learn to play well with survivor though too, to have a good view from both sides. This is one of the best games I have played in a big part because the variety of loadouts and asymmetry work so well at times, experimentation and developing with different playstyles gives some great results.
---
Same.
---
Some weird pallet lunges, but thats also on the other killers. But the Demogorgon is simply reaching through windows
---
I did. But they've made the game so much better since then, it's surprising to see the quality drop this bad

**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; This is reposted 5 times a day
---
I played around with it in the PTB. I found if I hooked within a reasonable distance of a gen/portal combo it seemed to work fine. You won't be right on top of the survivors, but close enough to actually make use of MYC a good amount of the time (similar to using MYC with Freddy). I would definitely use PGTW in a Demogorgon build though too.
---
Saying one perk should affect the entire game, every game, is stupid
---
I agree, I kinda wished there was more difference between the killer with better detail on them through their backstory page or whatever
---
Fair point. Maybe just scale the survivors so they're all roughly the same size? They're not that different now as it is, so I don't think it would be that big a deal.
---
I feel that the larger issue is the perception of where the hit boxes are. Intuitively, you'd think that the hit boxes are on, or close to, the character model. It adds a weird calculation to chases because you have to judge if you can make another loop or it you can make it to a window not based on where your character is but on an invisible box behind you that you don't know the exact size of.
---
That's a good point actually

So I'm curious, does this update include the matchmaking improvements or is that coming at a later date?

*its demogorgon time*
---
I need Claustrophobia, that would be really nice.
---
I don‚Äôt know what platform you‚Äôre on but PS4 is extremely bad for both Survivor and Killer. Huge freezes and frame drops constantly.
---
No you don‚Äôt. You just have to equip only the 3 perks and escape.
---
I used it 3 times against a Trapper today. Super fun. Can definitely see partially viability considering at tier 1 it healed me extremely quickly and saved people time on gens or me self caring and totems need to be done anyways.
---
Yeah, I'm on ps4
---
That's what happens when the devs focus on chapters and cosmetics instead of mechanics and performance
---
shirtless janes intensifies
---
If a killer is camping and patrolling. Is it okay to unhook a survivor at full hp and take the hit for them so they can escape? What if I'm being chased but have just enough distance to unhook the person? Take the hit and run?
---
Can we get one with the pre buffed perks?
---
So many of them would be in absolute or high, and almost nothing would be in low.
---
They used to be more active and didn't require as much evidence, but then people started abusing it and sending in false reports. After people were able to prove that someone was streaming when the supposed offense happened that got them banned, they started training their support techs to double-check this stuff more intensely.
---
Better than getting banned because you're a halfway decent player and someone got salty, I'd say.
---
In ptb it worked with surveillance? Was that changed?
---
Yep my friends had to do theirs twice because either the killer DCd as they exited the gates or the lobby said disconnected from host. They got BP but no trophy.
---
I personally haven‚Äôt even played Pig since her ‚Äúnerf‚Äù because she really fell out of Tier by that one change.
---
They need to buff her Sneak Speed because not being able to apply Status/Exposed with a Sneak Attack is already weak as hell.
---

Can we get a freddy afro
---
In my limited experience, always seems to be the ones who die that like to toss insults around afterward. Really makes ya think.
---
Probably gonna replace thana with STBFL, seems viable :P
---
Just depends what perks you want, and which killer‚Äôs playstyle and/or survivor skin you‚Äôre interested in playing with. None of them are really ‚Äúmust have‚Äùs.
---
I‚Äôve been working on getting Spirit Fury/Enduring on her so I can just go flat-out ‚ÄúFuck your Pallets‚Äù build, and maybe try some sort of meta with that.
---
That lunge ain't getting you any downs before they are injured so yeah enjoy extra time getting the first hit in chases.
---
All the while Billy over there just downed and hooked before you even got your lunge landing
---
Y'know what's a bigger waste of time? Waiting forever and whining about the perks instead of grabbing them and removing them ages ago. And also yes they did just fix the web by giving us double the chances of the perk we want appearing you're just clogging your web

Wait what? I thought someone said the dlc would come with it awhile back. Maybe this was a misunderstanding that it comes at the same time as the DLC.

His shred is a great don‚Äôt run in line ability because you can bait people with it, instadown would be broke cause you can use it a lot of times with little to no consequences it‚Äôs not a poor man billy chainsaw leatherface is and yeah he can get juked like billy also you may say billy had a chainsaw to one shot with easier control but it goes forever demogorgon eventually stops and those portals are helpful with oblivious sneaking up on survivors and it puts gen pressure faster than Freddy can because he can place it in Multiple locations besides gen I fail to see how he‚Äôs a poor man billy
---
Ah okey, thank you so much for the help.
---
It's very fun, and if you use it at the right time, you get everyone.
---
Thana wanes up and down depending on how the match is going though. Dying Light is ALWAYS active starting from the first hook, NO MATTER WHAT. Survivors CANNOT just negate it by healing themselves and what not. It's constant, and consistent, starting from the first hook. 
---
That's what people are overlooking here, because they're too obsessed with "but but but mah 33%!". 
---
Not to mention the obsessions altruism speed bonus is slashed somewhat too. It caps at 33% total now, whereas before at tier 3, it was 50%. Not a huge difference, granted, but it's less of a boon for the obsession now. 
---
Not to mention, this actively encourages leaving the obsession alive, which is beneficial for running the other obsession perks.
---
Also, as I would presume based on his other comments, they got the game on Xbox, which only comes in the special edition digitally IIRC, which is a base price of $30.
---
So unless OP got it on disc, this dude has the audacity to complain about having to pay and extra $12, leaving him to a total cost that is still less than the base price of the game. Ffs
---
Surge has 0 synergy with any of your other gen breaking perks. Pgtw, overcharge and surveillance are unaffected. Those perks require you to take time out to kick the gen.
---
I kinda like how it looks it's easy to access the stranger things trophies rather then scrolling down then going to the dlc
---
urban evasion is your best friend against the stinky hag
---
Ah shoot, I knew I forgot something.
---
Surveillance is a good pickup. Nice.
---
An add-on required to break pallets.. I said it should be permanently in his kit. Which it has been added in a yet to come hot fix
---
Okay go play billy then and hope they make another billy
---
Did she DC?

The dwight's name should of been i cantbelieveitsedgy

Do when a survivor is in the Dream State does that mean Borrowed Time will no longer work? If so, that's a HUGE buff to Freddy.
---
Low key Ash reminded me of the Engineer (TF2) , no idea why.

---
No, just a reference to his role in stranger tings. Idk if you‚Äôve seen the show but he‚Äôs often joked about being the babysitter of the group since he‚Äôs always hanging out with the kids
---
He also reads chat but i mean he cant read everything he has to concentrate on the Game and read the chat of 1,5k people so yeah but i guess you can try that or Massage him on discord
---
Then he should get an add on that has a caustic acid mixture to melt the pallets.
---
You read the patch notes right? They fixed alot of bugs. But those gave rise to these bugs.
---
That‚Äôs scary how perfectly that quote fits in.
---
The pricing for a 1 killer 1 survivor chapter is one character and one half off, 5 + 2.5 roughly/rounded, this chapter you get two for their normal pricing, which is about 5 bucks a character, then one half off.
---
Okay go play billy then, just cause a killer doesnt play the same doesnt make them bad, the lunge is 1/4 of the new killers power set
---
Never seen the show.5(x for letting me know.

People are ridiculous. Literally everything in this game gets complained about by people who clearly cant handle the world, its exhausting.
---
Just dropped $25 and I‚Äôm not ashamed
---
It works with surveillance because surveillance is any regressing gen not a kicked gen.
---
My point is that it should work regardless if the killer is staying near hook. A Wraith can just cloak and face camp and the perk specifically made to counter camping doesn't proc. :l
---
It is pretty good. I hear a lot of SF+Enduring+Ruin+STBFL/BBQ/Sloppy
---
As someone that's been using the lunge alot it definitely has a wonky hitbox like I get hits that shouldn't even get like through pallets and windows it's just bullshit
---
people live outside of ontario?
---
They ran out of space :)
---
I wouldn't have spoken if he was overpowered. That would be survivors.
---
Notice the lack of nerf demo posts compared to Freddy or prenerf ghost face?
---
Rest my case
---
It‚Äôs what I get for browsing new in this sub... oh well
---
Ahh i feel u bro :((
---
Might as well test it now and see right? XD
---
No?  I was in a match with Ghostface and I don't think he was running either perk. I couldn't tell you for sure since I never saw the tally screen.
---
The blue screen error was just a match on the new map against Demo.
---
What iffff. Now hear me out... It one shots. But if you miss the survivor instantly escapes.
---
Considering that SWF wasn't originally planned and we've got dedicated servers after getting a hard"no" on them before, it's pretty impressive
---
This happened to me just now too
---
It activates only once.
---
When activated, it blocks any and all gates that are open and revels auras of naive survivors inside. If both gates are open, they both are blocked. 
---
Your best bet is to 99 gates until everyone‚Äôs unhooked and relatively safe.
---
That‚Äôs always a thing tho. Gamepass gives you a permanent discount to all gamepass games.
---
Ooh nice, I'll look into that, thanks ^^
---
Actually that is interesting to think about and probably! :O
---
Yeah, I just realized a bit ago, so maybe Xbox is behind on it, who knows
---
Dat teabag at chase 5 tho.
---
Yeah i know what your mean im just talking about when streamers will exclusively only read $20 donation messages. Get what I'm saying?
---
For real. If it crashes comment back i'm interested in seeing!
---
If you‚Äôre playing Shape, or any killer really, I‚Äôd recommend to have these in your wheelhouse:
---
Corrupt Intervention (Plague perk)
---
BBQ (Cannibal perk)
---
Monitor and Abuse (Doctor perk)
---
Gotcha just trying to narrow the problem down.
---
I like that the game map has the doors that open with certain gens, they could expand on that to have gens that are locked away til certain other gens are done, could add a lot if designed well.
---
lucky. i am still waiting...Still waiting
---
Y unready?
---
It looks like Nancy turned into the killer hahahah
---
I love Sailor shirt and default hair/jeans. My favourite non-set combo.
---
Yeah he does just read massages from everyone
---
Doesnt matter if sub or not, donation or not. I once asked if he was single but sadly he said he's taken.
---
They removed the switch to killer button too. Now you have to go back to the main menu every time.
---
I don't want him to play the same nor be the same. The Devs are clearly copying other killers powers now and using them / reskinning.
---
His L2 is a windup lunge with no movement. (Billy is a charge up lunge insta down that can be controlled and goes further. Yet Billy's only disorientates if it hits a wall)
---
His L2 will also chargeup move slower and destroy pallets. (Hello leatherface and Billy)
---
Nah not seeing similarities here.
---
Yet both of them get insta downs. Just seems not worth the effort. His lunge is NOT easy to land v competent players, you roar they juke. So if you do land it damn right it should be an insta down
---
I just chatted with people though. Walked in with scoops shirt so they asked how the gay bar was
---
Lol that means I am ready. Why noob? üò≠

Hello!
---
All I can say is... it depends.
---
For one thing you are mind-gaming the killer that you have Borrowed Time, but the killer doesn't know that you have it or not. So you may be essentially killing the survivor if you don't have it. 9/10 I would NOT unhook the survivor unless you were in a really good position to do it. I would only really unhook if the two of you can really benefit from being alive, or if the survivor was just a few seconds from dying.
---
Ask yourself "Will there be enough time to unhook AND save myself?" Because if you commit to unhooking, and you yourself dies, there will be another person off from the generator, the survivor you saved would be healing, and there will only be one survivor doing generators... (best case scenario anyway).
---
Of course, you would NEVER EVER do this against one-shot killers like Leatherface, Hillbilly, Huntress (because she can just hatchet throw and M1), maaaybe Michael Myers and Ghostface. 
---
Try to use your judgement whether or not this hook can be beneficial for the team in general. No one likes seeing two survivors downed at the same time!
---
Hope this helps!
---
Im still getting an infinite loading when palying as killer, man i hope dedicated servers save me :(
---
ü§î Well as u see me and my friends aint got the chat option. The game updated. We waiting for 30 minutes now to even get a match lol. I hope in the next screen that there is a chat option. üòí But I cannot say cause we still waiting.
---
I would mention that you won't know which totem NOED is on until end game when gates are powered. It doesn't light up until then
---
That Ash banner is gonna get memed hard
---
&gt;oh no LOL that's scary
---
Temple is at least a 7/10
---
Survivors know people want to play the new killer, but won't have full builds on him yet. So might as well bust out all the good shit and make it as miserable as possible.
---
What's that?
---
you shouldnt have cut it so early, if i remember correctly they retie themselves up again lol

I appreciate the jab, but they‚Äôve done a decent job at making the game much more stable over time.  Also, with the X version of XBox, frame rate is usually very smooth.
---
Preach my guy I love by that
---
Oh that's what you were talking about. I thought the perk didn't even register if the person got hit without a terror radius. I didn't know it didn't even active
---
Oh wait I see now, it's the friend lobby. I was thinking you were in the killer lobby
---
Same, I don‚Äôt like how they took it away either. They also need to get rid of the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù people. Lobbies just look weird now
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I've run into a glitch where if I come out of a portal and grab someone on a generator, it boots them from the game. It's happened twice. Basically freezes the grab animation and then they D/C. This is on PS4.
---
You have to stand on the portals to use them you can't just look at them and teleport and you need to aim at one while standing on a portal
---
Awe, dude, same. I got four or five matches in a row yesterday with almost all purple ranks and I was still at 17. üòí
---
Hey just like that know-it-all...kid.
---
It was pushed back to fall 2019 sadly

It was a joke you freckling tweeb

They said they had to remove it or delay the new lobby system, so they choose to remove it.

Also they said it **might** come back.

Can you provide me a pic with it! I forgot to check it! Thanks

3: Templar Knights whom have not earned red cross yet.
---
not very useful if they are on the other side of the map and my build will stun and give me a head start and chip away at that short 15 second exposed timer if you are close
---
so its really only 12 seconds of being exposed which i can can probably handle without getting hit when im still exposed

Get xbox ultimate for $1 and try it out. Comes with dbd and maybe all the dlc.

I have had a better experience than that on PS4, more ggs than bitching but I do wish they had a post game chat since it would be easier to have a little shared forum for us all to talk and give feedback to each other

I still remember the days I was a new player. Using urban evasion to traverse the entire map, and actually being terrified of each killer. I‚Äôve died so many times and learned something new every time in the beginning. Just keep pushing past these toxic survivors, and enjoy each game. You‚Äôll eventually get the hang of everything.
---
Even though the demogorgon just came out I've been having a blast mindgaming with his shred and teleporting and constantly getting into chase, for survivors Ash because I love the Evil dead franchise although Steve is looking tempting

It's not good design, but as is, DS is still arguably too strong, especially against strong/skilled red rank killers who can and will drop someone and hook them, come across you, and hook you again within a minute without even tunneling or camping intentionally. Plus you can force the DS by jumping into a locker, and all that. 
---
It's just another BBQ/Ruin where you need to get the DLC/Shrine perk.
---
I'll look them up, thanks!

As someone who trophy whores it‚Äôs an eye sore. Especially how they decided to label it.
---
Devour Hope could be good but I didn't played him yet
---
Start opening the gate, wait until the survivor is hooked and then open it completely.
---
You forgot franklins, devour hope, make your choice, and if the killer really doesn‚Äôt want you to have a good time, territorial imperative.
---
Ah yes, my favorite Netfix TV Show, Stanger Thigs.

It crashed with STBFL too, im just gonna giess the perk is unusable rn tbh

Most of the 2 minutes is just you running lol. I saw the post title, saw the Quentin, was not surprised ahahh

Can you explain why those dlcs?

[Buget Nurse main] Needs counter play, plus the portals are only visible to survivor when they are activated.

Yes, I can confirm this. I play on PS4 and have been having the same exact issue. Can't tell you how many lunges I've missed because frames just cease to exist.

It's always one step forward two steps back with this fucking game.
---
I could make the same discussion about survivors dcing
---
Literally the same but with add ons and prestiges or x killer even. So.. maybe looking just to one side isn't the best to have an opinion isn't it
---
Peanits said in this thread that they're considering an UR add-on that increases cooldown time, but makes the Undetectable status last a lot longer when exiting a portal.
---
Nope! It replaced those weird side-braid undercuts that came with the tennis gears.

As killer, what pisses me off the most is the goddamn flashlights.  You know, when they drop a pallet on your head and decide that's not enough, so they wait for you to break it just so they can fucking blind you?
---
Yeah, that's how you make me tunnel your ass.
---
Hatch only opens when you're the last survivor alive (or with a key) but it can appear before that. The hatch appears as soon as number of generators done is greater than the number of survivors remaining. It's silent at that point but you can see it. Get in the habit of noting whether or not the hatch has appeared every time you look at survivor / gens status. If you know it appeared, keep an eye out for it. If you find yourself being the last survivor alive, run for it.
---
If the killer closes the hatch and the gates are far apart, you can wait in hiding for the killer to patrol one gate, then open it behind him as he runs towards the other gate. Killers will often double back but it's your best shot.
---
If the gates are close together, crouchwalk towards the killer and nod your head at them, maybe they'll take pity and let you escape.
---
I‚Äôd kill to use the stoned ghost face mask
---
Ideally you want to find the hatch beforehand and book it there as soon as it's open.
---
But assuming that's not an option I have 2 ways with reasonable success rates:  
---
1: If you are SURE the 3rd surv is going to die (don't let him die on hook just so you can be last) you can head to an exit gate, the killer will normally go for the hatch next and as soon as the hatch pops you instantly start opening it.
---
Then there's a 50/50 chance the killer will head to your door or the other one. If he goes to the other one you'll be able to open it and get out.  
---
2: The second option is to find a hiding spot around 1 gate, again let the killer close the hatch. Wait for him to check your gate, then he'll leave to go check to the other one - you can then open it.  
---
These don't work vs Billy and stuff who can go between gates too fast.
---
you make pig mains everywhere proud
---

---
that‚Äôs Stange? (strange)
---
wow. that's bad mate. You get any reply from a dev about it?
---
Yup.
---
I refuse to play killer frequently until shit like this doesn't happen. Too many games playing against  3 red rank survivors who managed to find a scrub (or a friend who purposely depipped) to break matchmaking with.
---
Wrong. If you saw them as survivor, they were activated.
---
Yeah you mad lol
---
Literally every damn time I‚Äôm trying to sneak up to gens with Monitor and Abuse
---
Nope. Posted on here about it but haven't had any traction. I'm at work so I'm gonna see how it acts later and if it is still messed up try to contact BHVR directly.
---

His power isn‚Äôt really user friendly at least on Xbox .. u have to look at a portal that u want to teleport to while standing at a portal but it seems a bit glitchy trying to chose what portal to teleport to

---
True, but Konami is a bitch :(
---
I agree that with slow killers you are forced to sit in one place of the map or you are wasting valuable time. The developers seem to realise it too,as we have seen the last killers with teleportation abilities (especially Freedy,the gen teleport feels so out of place for me,it was like the devs said "take mobility to be viable".
---
However,the problem is not exactly mobility. Wraith have mobility but he is still a low-tier killer.The thing is that top tier kills can end chases quickly and apply pressure to the rest of the team. Killer dependant progress maybe would put some killers in the meta (Clown would be crazy because he would lost his main weakness,while he would still have the ability to end chases quickly).However,I am afraid that even with this change the good teams would still gen rush and the bad survivors is going to impossible to win against killers who can stall the game,as legion or doctor.
---
Because,the main problem is that the game is too much snowballing. If a survivor dies,it is very hard for survivors to win.This is even worse with two remaining survivors to do everything except if they are in the final gen or opening gates and in every other occasion, they would end up waiting for the other to die to take the hatch. When the team lose one survivor when they haven't repaired the majority of gwnerators,the survivors tema would fall apart.
---
In the other hand,if the survivors are good enough to loop the killer, they can repair generator in no time and you haven't time to kill the first survivor.Basicaly,this game is how much gen they would have been done when the first survivor dies (if someone dies).I prefer survivor,but when I play killer gen rushing is very disheartening,but If i am wining, afterwards a moment the game feels already won and it loses the sense of victory to kill the last poor survivor.
---
Sooo,how do you solve that? I strongly believe that a new objective should be added sure,but it must be better than doing gens or very difficult not to do it. One Idea i think would be that totems gives speed to the killer and every totem which get broken decreases the speed by little, maybe givng +10 for the  basic movement speed for 5 totems and with all totems broke would be -10 for the basic movement speed (for example,Pig starts with 125% speed and with all broken is 105%).This is just a suggestion.
---
Concluding,more smaller objectives scattered in the map would give more to do as survivor and killer.I would love stealth to be a viable tactic,for a lot of reasons including that wouldn' be enough for a killer as billy to brainlessly run through the map to find survivors.
---
Sorry, but what is this from?
---
Yup I just played my first game was manly trying to figure out how to use him they finish the gens so I know I‚Äôm going to lose and instead of escaping all 4 take turns vaulting over pallets and windows near the exit gate so I finally go there just to be tea bagged at flashlight spammed üòÇ gotta love people who take advantage of ur first time using a killer üòÇ

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vue6qr94Nmo&amp;t=649s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vue6qr94Nmo&amp;t=649s) if you go to 11:20 and then jump to 14:00 you'll this was recorded in-game absolutely fine, it is by far the most demanding game I have ever ran and I have never had a single problem with this. The Corvette I walk up to and pilot is atleast half the size of the Red Forrest and has over somelike 200+ object containers and object containers within those objects themselves. I don't see how DBD which use generic 'tiles' and has the lowest graphics I have ever witnessed in a modern game requires to purchase a new PSU. Sounds like the same crash but I just can't make any sense of that being the case for me when Star Citizen runs so smoothly chief =/
---
Cute üê∑
---
I'm doing this if the person who teabags me is last alive.  This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.
---
Left behind can let you find the hatch easier. If you have/ find a key, you can always wait for them to close the hatch and then open it back up yourself, since most killers won't continue guarding the hatch after they close it.
---
Other than that, you can camp by the door instead of going for the hatch. As soon as the killer closes it you start opening the door and pray they don't guess right. Works much worse on mobile killers or when the doors are close together.
---
Honestly, most of escaping as the last person is luck and the rest is stealth. The killer has strong tools to prevent any escape attempt if they play smart and patient enough. You're going to have to recognize opportunities and aggressively make a play when you think the time is right.

---
Spirit, haunted grounds is nice to use especially with other totem perks to confuse survivors, downside is once it‚Äôs cleansed you‚Äôre left with 3 perks for the rest of the game, spirit fury is helpful for obvious reasons, rancor I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve used it since release. Adams pebble is nice if ur playing sneaky and daring, his 100% unhook is helpful for sure, and his last one is terrible idr the name lol
---
The Plague, her gen blocking one is helpful helps prevent gen rush and gives u time to hunt right away, the one where someone screams in ur terror radius after hitting someone is helpful when u got people stalking a gen waiting for you to take the survivor away but situational, I never use dark devotion the terror radius one. Janes are helpful for sure, the locker one is kinda memey and in my experience has been used for taunting the killer and such yeah u get a stun off but depends how u use your time once u activate it. That perk plus quick and quiet is a nice combo. 
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt remember most the perks names tried to type this quickly on break at work lol hope this helps somewhat

People who DC frequently and/or get reported often should get matchmaking prioritized to lobbies with each other.

Interesting, thanks for the reply!
---
you're right, same thing happened to me constantly. i'm so glad to be done with that adept demogorgon trophy. these survivors are terrible to play with
---
It‚Äôs on Xbox one, Xbox one x, PS4, PS4 Pro ... I thought it was already on Switch. My bad.
---
However, the enhanced consoles run the game better. So again, which console are you talking about.
---
&gt; *While obviously well-meaning, this is actually terrible advice.*
---
Best catch-all that I've found, precisely *because* there's so much disagreement over it. I prefer it over trying to force a new player into an unrealistic standard, one that'll cripple their progress if they get torn up about what might be camping, or if they're running a tunnel, if they should have let a survivor go or not...
---
As you yourself noted, sometimes you have to stay near a hook because the survivors give you no choice. Sometimes the unhooked survivor runs right towards you. It's unfortunate, but it cannot realistically be construed as malicious behaviour on the part of any player.
---
As OP plays the game, they will learn when staying near the hook will, or will not, work for them. They will get better at dividing their time. Their *skill* will allow them the luxury of overlooking poor survivor play.
---
Ergo, "Don't be a dick". I feel it's easier for any player grasp as compared to "Don't do the thing except when you need to do the thing". I understand you feel differently, and that's OK.
---
Might want to tag OP in your post, so they get a notification.

Or make it so that the token allows entry in these places. Maybe as overcoming your fears. Like a safe hook rescue  would give you one or something
---
guess you suck, its pretty much Impossible to get get the last gen done if he plays smart
---
**THIS PLEASE.** I play on low as well, It just looks awful.
---
Its from the 26th to 30th

I‚Äôm going to kill you for the horror you have brought upon my eyes

Ah ok. I‚Äôm familiar with it, I just never really watched them.
---
It's good, but not *ultra rare* good.
---
Purple is the right level.
---
first impressions my first game ever played and I was trolled and bmed and put against players who have thousands of hours. Honestly what a terrible concept \*FREE WEEKEND\* \*ALSO RANK RESET\* just so the new players who check out the game get bmed and dicked and hate the game. 
---
Honestly I hope in the future the rank reset 1 week before or after they do a free week so people actually have a somewhat balanced match. I can safely say I'm not gonna buy now even the people on the reddit are toxic down voting me.
---
School :/
---
Map would be Groovy Smoothie
---
Haunted Grounds is so easy to counter... just hide on the maps sides or corners until the timer is finished. It works like a gem, until a Claud gets downed in the first 10 seconds or a Dwight gets caught in the locker near where the totem was.
---
Fake and gay
---
Also works because Nancy's name fits
---
Thank you so much
---
It didn‚Äôt on HP‚Äôs videos. He tested it, the surge didn‚Äôt turn the Gens white.
---
Sorry for the bad English, I am Italian
---
A.E.I.O.U and sometimes PLAY A DIFFERENT KILLER.
---
I would argue that the survivors and the four characters perks are equally as important too. Study up on both the killers ability and the perks for both sides before doing anything.
---
"You cannot save you friends, they will die alone and screaming as you cannot enter the basement. Even when only three survivors are alive and one is being chased while the other is hooked, you are still helpless to intervene."
---
It's really double-sided, complete immunity from a basement build at the cost of everyone else dying there...?
---
Why is this guy getting so many downvotes?
---
Pretty excited to play tonite, Demogorgon actually looks scary to play against
---
Saw a Kate go bald right before my eyes today. Setting the graphics to medium fixes the hairs being transparent but the performance hit is to severe on my toaster.
---
I actually didn't think about that. I *could* just save up shards for doc.
---
That's the worst thing ever.
---
God damn demigorgon looks way more buff than I remember
---
So glad it‚Äôs the new meta, but then there‚Äôs an issue where you want to get a totem off the bat but then find the Ruin totem. Should you try and alert others so you don‚Äôt screw other Nancy mains of a free heal if you already have a heal waiting?
---
Cant unsee it now
---
That's the bad part-  
---
The game isn't optimized enough yet, at least i think so, for me to switch to higher qualities, but even if i did, they never made Motion blur and bloom their own settings so i'm kinda stuck with this.
---
Lmao legitimately can‚Äôt be mad at this, much better then the boring ‚ÄúLemme just keep hitting him‚Äù
---
Strange, I leveled up Ash to check for the extra perks but only found 2. 
---
He‚Äôs level 50. 
---
Meh, gotta level the 2 other survivors first (and Demi).
---
I see drake &amp; josh, I upvote.
---
The new hair textures look godawful. Revert it back, please.
---
Especially in the killer shack, it‚Äôs horrible
---
in before someone responds with the normal or prestige outfit and scoops head.
---
I just run around the map scratching my neck like tyrone biggums looking for totems nowadays.
---
I use a smurf to practice
---
ITS BEEN 5 GAMES
---
I would be  surprised  if They didnt do one
---
Can confirm the newest customization for Rin looks like rotted dreads on PS4. However. I think that it looks better. Her original hair however looks like a bush.
---
Even though I am a big fan of the Doc, I would say go for Myers as he is one of the stronger killers in the game imo.
---
Whilst I do have a blast playing as the Doc, I always seem to do a lot better on Myers which is why I would say pick Myers and get the Doc with shards or at a later date
---
That was also this games birthday... can't draw too many comparisons
---
Both are Microsoft therefore the xbox controller works for pc as well so...and controller is easier than keyboard imo and others as well who prefer it
---
*It's been 84 years...*
---
They didn't want to remove it. It was probably removed because every survivors match is basically set up to be a swf match, you couldn't switch between killer and survivor in an old swf lobby. So it's like that here as well
---
I don't think so
---
Brenda with lines would be a blessing: *DAMN this is some scary shit*
---
yeah it gets really annoying having to manually go in and stop games from installing to speed up the installation of one game that i want to play, not to mention ps4 copies all the updates and shit so it makes the update twice as long if not longer most of the time
---
To me the masks mean different things so they both have merit. 
---
The Brandon James mask was the first time the costume had real meaning behind it, it was Brandon Jame‚Äôs therapeutic face shield that had been badly damaged (and probably re-cast after a few years so that Halloween stores could bank in on the tragedy) 
---
Ghostface was supposed to scary because it was just a Halloween costume between you and a psychopath, even in dying you wouldn‚Äôt get to know who was under the facade. It innocent but was being used for sinister reasons, it was picked (by billy &amp; stew) because it was simple, iconic, and probably cheap to replace in case they needed to ditch it (and they did)
---
I literally made this image
---
Where‚Äôs the guy that linked like 30 posts asking about bloodhunt into the last one, we need him again.
---
Everyone who downvotes this guy is double gay
---
I agree, this games relies too much on the snowball effect, which makes any killer with instadowns available all the time a nightmare. With Billy being top tier nuisance while Leatherface is swing state shit tier.
---
I would love for a variety of different objectives to come into play, not too much though that the management becomes almost impossible for the killer.
---
Totems increasing movement speed would be great, so long as the totems are more well hidden.
---
I wish stealth were a viable tactic as well :c Especially considering we already have brainless no interaction garbage like Nurse and Spirit
---
Agreed
---
You think that's a controversial statement? I don't even like Stranger Things, and the least exciting part about this patch for me was the new characters. The bloodweb changes and SWF QoL changes got me way more hype. Dedicated servers too, eventually.
---
I can't comprehend people complaining about bad graphics on low graphics settings. Like...that's what you signed up for.
---
You can simply do that one player is a M1 killer, the other tries to loop as long as possible. Once caught, you let him go and go again. It can be a good practice.
---
It is not known yet when the blood hunt starts. They will most likely either do it this weekend or the weekend after (which I think is going to happen). It will come within a few weeks of a new chapter.
---
You cannot hide the HAIR of Steve "THE HAIR" Harrington!!
---
Idk I kinda like high settings.
---
Ok so then why do the game settings matter if you already have a way to alter?
---
Thank you! &lt;3 I'm Australian (obviously haha) so g'day and cheers
---
Imagine all the people that would bitch because they didn‚Äôt realize the timer began again.
---
Congrats. I managed to get gen rushed 5 games in a row against swf‚Äôs with bnp
---
I was able to install the DBD update, BO4 and Blair Witch on Xbox before PS4 had finished installing the dead by daylight update. It‚Äôs ridiculous how long it takes sometimes.

I do, the survior runs no mither,  Unbreakable, and
---
Thanks. Me and the person in mind are fairly new so that definitely could be fun
---
i completely agree
---
STANGER THINGS
---
I highly doubt it‚Äôll become a meta perk. It‚Äôs way too situational and niche, and you need to find and cleanse a totem for it to activate. 
---
Not saying it‚Äôs a bad perk, just that it‚Äôs far from being the next MoM meta perk.
---
Time to fap
---
Wait wasn‚Äôt Halloween made in the 70‚Äôs?
---
Clearly im talking about since I‚Äôve hooked them. I‚Äôll make sure to be more detailed.
---
Yeah, I'm having the same issue on PS4. Just escaped twice with Nancy just using her perks and nothing popped. I have the perks in the same order as they are in her profile. The first escape I burned a yellow envelope offering with no item. The second escape I used nothing but the perks.
---
What is the last perk the survivors uses? The world may never know...
---
There was a leak saying blood hunt will be 26th to 30th
---
Yes we know what we signed up for but we didn't expect them to make the game even look worse, especially with something this distracting.
---
I disagree I like knowing what rank my teammates are, I can predict how they'll play and if I don't feel comfortable I can find another lobby.
---
Also he‚Äôs acting like because the survivors are high rank that they automatically know how to counter the brand new killer, is this what happened to Mandy?
---
Geez
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind. Thanks!
---
I thought they were pointing out the spelling error.
---
Who is saying this, like I honestly want to know
---
It takes forever just to load the survivors menu.
---
Left. No one was saying it so I will.
---
Anyone else getting more unfair queues than normal? I don‚Äôt often play killer but I have played 4 games and all 4 have had at least 1 purple rank (I‚Äôm rank 19) one of them had 3. Really killing my vibe.
---
tbh just grab it, even tho u may never use it, once you have got all three tiers of that perk it will no longer show up in the blood web therefore increasing your chances of getting the perk you want
---
Oooo I'm whooping her ass Cindy
---
True. I suppose I should say common, not meta. Like Self Care is common, but not meta.
---
Ive explained why. And your explanation why this game is too good for a brightness slider is pretty thin. But thanks for trying
---
If you don't buy the perk, it has a higher chance of showing up in the next web.
---
Dang, I hope they fix it soon. :/
---
I have all default but ability for survivor is L3
---
They should have a prevention button that blocks your teammate from unhooking you.
---
Just got this game, and it doesn't matter if I play killer or survivor, I keep getting green rank players. Like, why!? I'm only rank 18!
---
Melted like ice cream
---
thank you for pointing that out to me, i got a light chuckle out of it

It‚Äôs Free To Play until September 27 I think?

It‚Äôs not *desperate*, it just lets new people give the game a demo and compliment the Sale/Discounts. Just a simple marketing strategy.
---
If I didn't just spend the rest of my money on DLC, I'd guild you.
---
Change enduring for ruin and use his ultra rare and this is a pretty good build imo. If you dont have the ultra rare you could switch thana for spirit fury. And ofcourse there is the chili,ruin,thrilling tremors and pop that use his mobility to make sure no gens get done.
---
Pig mains rise up!
---
And prolly Quentin because I love the remake and because his outfit is cool.
---
Spirit cosplaying Karaba from Kirik√π and the Witch.
---
Why is it it Phil's Petrol and not just Gas Haven? Kinda think it would add some cool continuity to the world IMO
---
Bitter murmur is alright I think
---
I guess make it so you can only go in if someone else is already down there I dunno. Or ignore the basement thing completely and make automatic struggle escape from basement only once or an exhaustion perk or something.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll give that a try
---
Damn
---
*oinks in solidarity*
---
They are different. But you tell me on the pro and the x, have the frames dropped? Its been on the Xbox 1 and ps4
---
Honestly I can‚Äôt
---
Yeah I sort of guessed that, but I have a bunch of purple teachables from other killers that I don‚Äôt like
---
Ikr. I dont know why, but i get gen rushed with him the most...
---
Yeah he seems like a killer that you can‚Äôt play without ruin.
---
That‚Äôs the outfit you get for buying the full anoes dlc.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs true. Popularity-wise, I‚Äôd place it next to Head On. Super fun perk to use, but most people don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll give it a few weeks and the majority will be back to using the same old meta perks. More glory to me, as I hate being a predictable survivor. I don‚Äôt need to rely on meta perks to loop or win games. They help, but are just not fun.
---
I‚Äôm terrible at killer. Was hoping he‚Äôd be a killer that is go against a lot.
---
ah man that sucks, i dont have too many teachables so i usually get what im lookin for
---
Just the shirt? Or does he have different pants and hat too?
---
Servers are probably stressed from all the players today. Hopefully it gets cleared up and most people aren't as bad off, right?
---
Yeah, sometimes having a bunch of level 50 killers isn‚Äôt as cool as it sounds
---
And people ask why streamers get moro'd
---
I'd take the deal
---
Even then ruin will just get murdered in two seconds. Honestly his surge shouldnt have cooldown. If survivors are dumb enough to stick around when you down one of them and are trying to be altruistic, they should get punished for it if one goes down instead of having to wait 60 seconds
---
lol
---
Is only being able to see the red stain on the lowest graphics setting intended? I can't see it through walls on Ultra, and I'd like to play the game on Ultra...
---
I shit you not in the time it took to place down 2 portals a gen was already done its fuckin dumb how fast gens go in this game
---
No, they where delayed.
---
*angry demonic spider noises*
---
Same build that's best for every 115 killer. Bbq, ruin, enduring, spirit fury.
---
I haven‚Äôt played either the Pro or X version yet. I‚Äôm playing on PC right now. Which is why I asked you which console you were talking about. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have them fine, just let me know which one your having issues with and I can gladly check the enhanced versions to see if that‚Äôs happening too. I have the game on all platforms.
---
No you didn't, fucking trash, saw this in the release of the skin

---
The Meg is like, "Oh boy, here I go killing again"
---
I wonder what did they do the past month about the dedicated servers since they had the same issues of the earlier PTB...
---
this game is literally unplayable now
---
Guys maybe when they release the ash outfit they‚Äôll also release the good versions of his perks because I really want to love Ash.
---
He gets a beanie and lighter pants as well.
---
I know, right? I've mostly been playing survivor because you see *less* toxicity this way, it really puts things in perspective.
---
Is the Bernie any different?
---
Controversial take: I think the shadow guys are kinda cool and funny
---
Yeah, the huge advantages of playing on low should have a downside.
---
I don't like the idea of paying for extra blood this ain't no hungry shark evolution shit my guy

I think rather than being banned from basement, maybe struggle 100% faster when in the basement? No lockers is a fine thing.

I just wouldnt want people to have an excuse to not go for basement saves.

Left behind is the perk you want if you want to live as the last one alive
---
Yeah I agree the spawns are better but in the likes of cold wind farm, the swamp or Macmillan the totems have spawned in the same place so much it is just annoying. Plus they Alabama have a tendancy of being ruin. Like if a killer runs devour or haunted it‚Äôs obvious which you shouldn‚Äôt destroy others (unless devour) but still.  I also agree that any survivor with brains will destroy the totems but even more so due to the new update.  Either way. I‚Äôve gone on a rant so. Have fun :)
---
Location block it for countries that don't want to allow it
---
Please compare both pictures and notice the differences.

Thank you for showing me! I didn't know this was done before. :)

Survivor main ash because evil dead is my favourite trilogy and ash Vs evil dead I enjoyed. Also who doesn't like ashy slashy.
---
Killer clown and spirit because I find them the easiest to end chases with and because I suck at nurse.
---
This is very helpful! Thank you.

I used it on Plague last night. one player cleansed it, got her teammate downed, then tried to bodyblock the hook while still exposed.

---
Cannibal or Kate Denson
---
Please do. Im sure it's experiencing framedrops
---
Obvipusly it's gonna be a bit better, but a drop nevertheless
---
What's this even from?
---
Survivor, I switch between Kate and Feng Min. Kate was the 1st survivor I played as and I still like to. Feng Min because for the longest time she was the only survivor I had Alert on which I love, but I could never be bothered levelling her up to unlock it for all survivors. Eventually did but I still like to play as her.
---
Killer is really dependent on what mood I'm in. 1st killer I had a really good game with was the Wraith. Even now the games I have with him are enjoyable. If I want to mess with survivors I go for the Doc as I love his shock therapy ability.
---
But right now I play a lot of Plague. I know if survivors don't cleanse she essentially becomes a m1 killer. But as I'm bad at Huntress (on PS4 and want to get better at her, but always have bad games with her), Plague is my projectile killer of choice. Well that and when survivors do cleanse and I manage to hit a sweet corrupt purge, I always feel really smug about it
---
Ye i thought it was agreed on by the majority that it looks awful
---
I think the oldest Clem ever was in the games was 17, and the devs said they wont add kids/underage characters to the game, so they'd have to opt for an older version of her we havent seen in the games before for this to be compatible
---
I‚Äôm so disappointed. I haven‚Äôt seen a single Nancy or Steve in my 12 lobbies. I‚Äôm all alone on console :/
---
I main Kate with Lithe, windows of opportunity, borrowed time, and stakeout. Makes me a good all rounder, it covers chases, gens, and rescue missions

I have a One X, and it‚Äôs been horrific. Frames dropping left and right. It‚Äôs making playing killer almost impossible at the moment.  Reverting back two years has really put a damper on my excitement for the new chapter.
---
I forgot to say that after they get downed the killer doesn't pick them up
---
imagine being this pissed. LMAOO some people on this sub are awful.
---
she even looks more upset in the second picture :C
---
There is, it is called the killer grabbing the unhooker. Alternatively, the killer could just get the dumbass that went for the unhook. I know I usually do that, although I might down the unhooked for the purpose of slugging. Won't rehook right away though, I am getting that other guy.
---
Well how often do you use the lunge? Do you place portals near generators and potential 3 gen areas? Need to know how you play him so I can help as I've been having easy matches as the gorgon

I have both Ghostface and GF. Thanks for the advice anyways!

You should've got the achievement as it's based on perks only

If you don't see it as worth it, good for you.

If you don't wanna buy it bc you think it's overpriced that's fine. No one should judge you for it.

So long as you don't judge others for thinking it is worth it

I‚Äôll do it now and let you know.

Pissed no it‚Äôs just annoying like yea ur gonna win most games against a demogorgon today since nobody‚Äôs used him before why make it to where nobody wants to play him instead killers will just go back to their normal meta build killers ie spirit or nurse

and btw have you heard of Konami's cancellation of Silent Hill P.T.?  It was the most anticipated horror game back in the days and they straight up ruined it for everybody without any valid reason
---
Then tell BHVR to add a be gentle I'm playing a new killer button then. Cause it's not that big of a deal.
---
No. I 4k on Susie all the time, I usually just slug everyone and then let them get up and go home. It's seriously not a big deal.
---
Baby survivor
---
"You look great, and you're gonna slay 'em dead. "
---
The entire chapter?
---
It just amazes me how shitty of a community it is sometimes, and how someone who makes uninspired awful TF2 memes can be so hypocritical.  
---
Oh well, cant say Im suprised. Way to be a good sport
---
In other words you can dodge lobbies with new players, so exactly the reason that people are upset.
---
Oh yeah I heard about p.t.
---
Yeah.
---
Makes sense, I guess.
---
A full chapter costs $10, while a single paragraph costs $7.
---
Still gonna report a DC unless it‚Äôs obviously some fucked up internet problems.
---
Yeah, I don't like the though of seeing my girl Clem becoming a happy meal for Demogorgon no thanks
---
My friend and I loved to play hide and seek using jumpscare myers and a survivor with scratch mark removing perks and stealth perks on lerys. Very fun!
---
His lunge attack (dom't know the special name for it) will also break pallets without the use of a pink add-on as it was on the ptb
---
It's only in swf before you ready up
---
Live life, breathe air,
---
It's really hard to deny safe hook rescues if they're running Borrowed Time.
---
It makes perks like spine chill nor work I think cause he no longer has a terroir radius but you can still hear lullaby

LMAOOOOO

I really like this kind of pov and if there is one where we see ourselves going to the campfire.

He seems to be one of this killers that if you time their power right they are super strong but if you mistime it then you're gonna have a hard time. I watched Zubat play for quite a bit today and he just destroyed loops with the lunge
---
That‚Äôs a great idea! It also gave me an idea. What if you did the same thing but with the Pig? Use her Amanda‚Äôs Letter addon and use that for finding survivors? I feel like it could work
---
YES
---
It is indeed
---
*skurry
---
Not saying this isn't a shit update, but it is mentioned in the patch notes as
---
Ghost face
---
Cough mandatory hex: ruin cough
---
But this wasnt swf just a random lobby
---
Yeah for me too atm. Just equip a dank mori, Franklins and ruin to make their match miserable too.
---
I see this argument often whenever someones comments on the dev team. Isn't resource management a thing? Can't they funnel their resources more towards "programming" and less towards "cosmetics" or DLCs?
---
It is sad that in most occasions trying to mind game as killer is counterproductive and the best  thing is too just eat the pallet the faster you can.
---
Nurse is killer that stealth works well against her,but unfortunately you need to break LoS, something hard in most maps.Her lunge feels bigger than it should be for a killer that can bypass everything, making juke her very hard as should be (maybe a decrease in lunge range per blink. If she was required a more precise blink in front of you,perhaps it would be very funnier to play against her.
---
Spirit is too random to guess her next move and billy i cannot yet understand with so much mobility how he is a 115+ mobility (especially with add-ons that make him to instakill in loops).
---
But even if they lost,they could simply go to another gen and apply pressure.But as the other killers,if you lost the survivor,you are gen-rushed 
---
fucked while walking all the way to a another gen in the other side of the map.
---
Killers crying. What a surprise
---
Ohhh that‚Äôs really cool, have you got a source I can read ?
---
Lol or maybe just play the game like a normal person ? Than u wouldn‚Äôt get nurse spirit and face camping bubbas every game
---
On the Xbox One X with an SSD if that matters, the game runs about the same more or less. Even before the patch it gets choppy and laggy. Especially in the menus and shop. In-game the skill check meter seems a bit more choppy post patch.
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Love it. Don't teabag on hatch before it opens, won't end well :P
---
I would say halloween. First of all, you get laurie with ds (amazing perk if you play survivor), and i think that michael is just a stronger killer. Michael has a good ability with strong addons, and is relatively straightforward.
---
Doctor is a good killer, but hid add ons don't get really good until the very rare ones, and he is more complicated than Michael.
---
I think it was in the patch notes, they are probably stickied on the hot page
---
But... that's his uncle. 
---
OH NO!
---
Thanks üëçüèª
---
You think that's bad... try looking at her hair while in the pre-match screen. She's basically bald.
---
Take my upvote...
---
"This squid is so raw I can still hear it telling spongebob to fuck off!"
---
No problem :)
---
Pro tip; people (team mates and killers alike) will get mad at almost anything so just do your best and don‚Äôt read messages
---
These kind of players suck, but keep playing, and you‚Äôll find the better side of the community!
---
Hey hey me too. Exact same thing happened. :)
---
scorey
---
Thank you for doing this, because you don't understand how many times it has been done to me and the killer immediately downed and hooked me again. T_T
---
No really. He'll just stack it faster. If you respect every pallet because you can break it with shred the just won't drop it and will loop you for a year.
---
That is normal. That a literal regular day of DBD.
---
Ruin is VERY necessary. I have no idea how I'm going to get the adept Demogorgon achievement.
---
It is not exactly wrong to have competitive games though... A lot of good balancing changes for competitive games have been rolled back or outright torn out in favor of a casual audience that ended up being very detrimental or lowering the quality of player value themselves. I can think of a few in Siege from the recoil reduction to various operator gadgets being reworked that didn't need to be reworked and became grossly overpowered.
---
Luckily I'm not the only one thinking this. I absolutely hate the static shadow people
---
It kinda depends on taste, but i find Myers really fun to play, i like hag too, but her playstyle is a little different from most, vomit queen is a good choice tho, maybe watch some videos of people playing them if you're in doubt?
---
his arms look long as fuck
---
That's a good point too. I sometime forget that I get dickheads on my team that will troll their own team.
---
Ive been trying for an hour to get 3 friends in a party and at least one of us isn't loading in each time.
---
I think he has a high skill floor, so he's not a pick up and play killer like the clown for example
---
Yeah, the one thing I learned right away is to do gens. 9 times out of 10, if I try and go save someone, the other two teammates are doing the same.
---
Why would anyone take second wind over self heal? There should be no requirement for healing after being saved from a hook 9/10 times you just get insta downed again anyway might as well get some healing progression done.
---
Then isn‚Äôt ST around the same t I m e ?
---
Thanks! yeah for sure, paper mache seems to be the way all the people whose cosplay turns out well are going so I'll try that, thanks again :3
---
Show us on the post-game chat screencap where the toxic SWFs trash-talked you.
---
Damn.
---
Waaaaaah.  If you get this upset. Dont play games kid
---
It‚Äôs cheap atm

I instantly bought it yo

That happens to me more often that you think.

Ye most of the community is made of cry baby cunts. You kinda get used to it really after a while, but if it isn‚Äôt your style I‚Äôll totally get it if you don‚Äôt stay.
---
when spirit comes out of nowhere
---
Yea it is, they didn't deserve to be able to get me with cheap tactics and mori's. Funny how killers are all for instaheals being nerfed but not mori's.
---
I fucking sucked so i am taking a break until tomorrow. I can‚Äôt even hit a fucking use shred correctly.
---
You need thick skin to play this game because of the player base.
---
&gt;sometimes
---
Made me lol.
---
‚ÄúHey Peter Parker.  You got something for me?‚Äù
---
Yeah but I already own Freddy and Quentin so I would be paying a reduced price but still a lot for just a different shirt, and hat
---
I would but I play on Xbox, and it's more a jab towards the kind of survivor mains who are going to be down voting this meme.
---
The rooms with walkways, lots of stairs and small drops are very powerful, especially with balanced landing. Try that and see if it works for you. The third floor offices are where you go to die.
---
DS, Urban Evasion, technician, and mettle of man
---
You should probably look up the proper timing for pallet stuns
---
Boards of Opportunity and Small Game
---
Well correcto but it does look a little different and that‚Äôs all that matters because they don‚Äôt any cosmetics
---
They made the recovery time after shred a bit longer if I remember correctly so people couldn't just spam shred to gain distance.
---
oh sorry, thanks for letting me know. I don't really watch stranger things
---
The "Large Raisin Glasses" Head for Claudia is also completely fucked now. It literally fades in and out of existence. Looks awful.
---
True, does Freddy get anything special?
---
Looks the same on max for me
---
That i don‚Äôt know
---
Aim at a survivor.
---
Rule 3
---
What if they downvote just because your post comes across as very whiny? Just asking questions here, I'm an unbiased third party that plays exactly 50/50 killer/survivor.
---
Me as the hag
---
No it's a one time use and takes away a perk that you could be running something better
---
But we already have him
---
Sorry if I sounded like a bit of a dick, no worries though
---
I‚Äôm trying, I land in front of them or behind them.
---
More skill than survivor rofl you can complete the gens in literally 3 minutes plus your cute insta heals, keys and toolboxes. It's a walk in the park if you have atleast 1 competent team member
---
he's terrible, you're right. the lunge sucks. normal attack is much easier and more dependable. ppl act like the lunge distance is a lot farther. and the buttons to do it are awkward, at least on console, because u have to hold L2 and then hold in R2. weird stuff. and his portal power sucks until you get to the last 3 gens, to basically do what Spirit is good at. he sucks. but i'ma get his trophies.
---
Yeah but he came with no survivors, I‚Äôd take a chapter with these two and a parody GF costume
---
nope, just survivor so far.
---
Make sure the survivors are dumb enough to walk in a straight line or got for a window vault and then charge up shred and wack em you could also mindgame some pallets. Simple as that though

I have a similar situation. I'm connected to the university wifi, which is good actually.

But survivors have 70-120 ping in lobby, and in the game everyone lags.
---
Then I get comments like that, saying I'm lagswitching :)
---
note: I have perfect ping in other games
---
None. I'm going to work. Like a true American.
---
Sometimes Borrowed Time at exit gates makes this 100% ok. Tbh, if the other surv is good and you're swf it's always okay to BT them out.

Hopefully. Was happy with the games I got but was definitely hoping to get more in

---
Low-key Steve with just the sailor shirt is pretty hot ngl. Like I'm not gay but...
---
Below Freddy but above pig
---
That's one of the Demogorgon's perks, Cruel Limits.
---
Cruel limits blocks all windows in a 24 meter radius. It's the demogorgons teachable
---
I don't own tapp yet sadly but I like his perk stake out and yeah I rarely run into Tapps.
---
I haven't played trapper before I might try him out to see how I feel playing him though.
---
Again I‚Äôm trying, do I have to lead them or pretty much centre screen then release
---
Just use the basic bitch build, Ruin, Spirit Fury, Emduring, BBQ
---
I guess it's more aggravating to me cause the guy went out of his way to find my YT and call me shit there.
---
 Happens every time any killer pulls someone off the gen
---
Fixed your title
---
Dont know. It is a new perk though. Are you sure they perks just weren't on display yet. They dont display until the round is completely over
---
New demogorgon perk
---
Same
---
I think I heard the bat knock her soul into the shadow realm
---
no man you're good
---
If you jump over a window 3 times as a survivor the entity will block it for a while
---
Should give us a Scoops Ahoy version of the DLC where you can pay a bit of a discounted price to get the DLC + Scoops Steve. (So like $15 instead of paying $11 for DLC and $10 for Scoops)
---
Yeah basically it's really only good if the area isn't filled with pallets,a mindgamable loop and window tiles
---
The hope that you‚Äôll eventually get the perks you want, or the perk called hope?
---
Still waiting on those Laurie cosmetics to give them my money!
---
It cost as much as a bucket of chicken from kfc
---
I didn't mind them at first. But now they are creepy as hell.
---
I know, you see, somehow the killer will look for me and this will be horrible.
---
That‚Äôs a weird looking Steve in scoops

Nobody knows how to play demigorgan and I have escaped 3 times in a row and made a rank 10 rage quit (I‚Äôm rank 16)

So it's now toxic to play Claudette, Nea, or use a flashlight...
---
You act like all survivors are whiny and complain about what killers use, yet you just made a post whining about stuff survivors use
---
What show is this from? I can't place it but I know I've seen it.
---
They also got rid of his perk addons that make the charge speed faster, which I find a noticeable difference in imo
---
Truth be told I‚Äôd rather Haunted Grounds gets popped with 5 gens than the opposite.
---
Few things are worse to have NOED activate, think you‚Äôre cleansing it then BAM Haunted Grounds.
---
Huh, want rank is this at? I dont get survivors fast vaulting unless to get my attention
---
Who the fuck thought that doing this to Rin was a good idea lmaooo
---
Np, after them, Freddy, Myers, Pig would be my picks in that order.
---
I think the DLC prices are pretty decent.The new one has 2 survivors than 1.The cosmetics/skins though are overpriced
---
Naw Mandy was just welcoming Steve to hell with a party hat
---
Sorry but if I‚Äôm rank 4, I shouldn‚Äôt be getting matched with rank 18s. New players shouldn‚Äôt be getting put in the same lobbies as red rank players with a ton of hours in this game, it‚Äôs not fair for anyone to get matches like that.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to cut off loops, I‚Äôll stop lol
---
The key to remember on any save (whether pallet or flashlight) is to wait until the killer hikes the survivor onto their shoulder. That is the end of their animation (when they can't get stunned). You're aiming for that sweet spot where they are just getting out of the animation but haven't moved yet.
---
Yes. The non-licensed ones can be obtain via shards.
---
you can killers by killers that aren't licensed with iridescent shards, you get shards by playing
---
You can buy non-licensed characters, both killers and survivors for 9000 Iridescent Shards in the store.
---
Deep night, have fear, I dont want to be there, because it's horrible
---
I rarely play playing Feng Min but when I do I always like being the stealthy gen jokey. Also is alert a good perk I never actually used the perk before? Same as Feng Min I rarely play Kate but when I do I'm always somehow the first to get found and spend most of the trial in chases or unhooking my teammates. 
---
Yeah I play Wraith when I have dailys or when I'm tired of playing Michael and ghostface. Even though he is supposed to be a low tier killer I surprisingly get 3-4 kills with him depending on the map. I don't play doctor at all mostly because I hate going against him but I probably try him out in the future. I don't really have good games playing Plague I'm not sure if bad or I'm not using her efficiently.
---
I once did this but still stunned the killer.
---
They look *alright* I guess but it really just feels like they took the default clothing and added a bunch of scratch decals onto them with photoshop. Especially on lower graphics settings the scratches look really bad and having *just* the shirt be ripped looks really bad. Might look better if you have prestige cosmetics but then you have the problem of a "clean but scratched" shirt on a bloody pair of pants and a bloody face.
---
There's no real reason *not* to get the Stranger Things DLC as one bundle (are you really going to pay a whole $4 extra to get all 3 with Auric Cells?) but the exclusive cosmetics are rather unimpressive. Would've loved actual alternative cosmetics for [Nancy](http://www.thejasperz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nancy-1.png) [Wheeler](https://assets.popbuzz.com/2017/45/nancy-stranger-things--1509979319-view-1.jpeg) &gt;!(also [this one](https://www.williamjacket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Stranger-Things-3-Nancy-Wheeler-Jacket.jpg) from Part 3)!&lt; or [Steve](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Stranger-Things-Steve-Harrington-2050474.jpg?r=1568124989675) [Harrington](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t23KyvI6SB9.0Zlyzpbf0w--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjMwO2g9MzU1/https://media.zenfs.com/fr/article.bfmpeople.com/f102f4323574e990f4caba706beda0b5) akin to sets of old but... gotta sell dem Auric Cells, right? Hell Steve's red sweater or hair with shades and any one of Nancy's alternate sweaters / jackets could've served as the DLC purchase bonus but instead they just went with the defaults with scratches. Very disappointing overall imo.
---
If you're a but behind and they arent at the pallet yet, it could be used there. But otherwise I'd avoid it at the pallets. Though I'm no pro player, so dont take my advice like I am. I'm definetly no pro with the demigorgon
---
Well i only do it if i have borrowed. Or the person is gunna goe to 2nd state. N no one else is cominf just to give em atleats a chance cuz they were gunna go into struggle anyways. Honestly. I think ppl r just idiots. I play this game stoned 100% of the time n i still aint as dumb as sum of these randoms. Like when a killer is leaving n obviously not gunna camp but this person running right at u n the killer sees his scratch marks n runs around u the whole time n doesnt LEAVE YOU so someone else can come get you then youll be like wtf n they be like "KiLErR CamPinG." Like justFML. This game should be called FML by Daylight.
---
eat your kids - saves you money for YOUR lunch AND makes you can buy in-game cosmetics!
---
D'aww
---
He got in fights in the show it‚Äôs probably supposed to be busted knuckles
---
Not licensed killers like Leatherface, Myers, Pig, Freddy, and so on. The other killers can be bought with shards which are granted when you level up devotion which you'll see at the end of a match.
---
It's okay but it seems like many of the gens are placed in corners away from doorways. Hard to get gen grabs. But definitely lots of line of sight blockers to still get surprise hits.
---
I think it‚Äôd be good on killers that can chain multiple downs too, like Myers. 
---
T think a Surge+Frightful is a nice combo if you can expose.
---
see im the opposite, since i plan on maining steve, i want to level nancy to 40 first, then power into leveling steve so i can HAVE nancys perks on him C:
---
Probably better for ghostface as he has potential to get more insta downs in a match than Michael.
---
Well that's more than a bit broken.
---
Steve &gt; Ash &gt; Jake is my order aswell :D
---
I am
---
Lmao xd
---
Yes they need to be longer.
---
Ruin doesn‚Äôt last long in my games and bringing others Hex perk to protect 1 Hex is annoying,pointless and getting rid of a better perk placement)
---
Because some SWF power trough Ruin.
---
Ruin isn‚Äôt good enough and totem placement sucks(they got better in Preschool,but still)

Killing people is a crime.

Anyone else's audio sound off? Feels like all the audio comes from behind me.
---
Your fucking toxic killer main jk but all jokes aside I feel your pain
---
I always do this. Just stand right where you hooked the survivor, and having in ming the clock, turn slowly to your 7 o clock. It works the best with Myers, he's the perfecto height to be right in front of the camera. It doesnt work with short killers like hag, freddy or legion.

You need to complete the one man gen in the tiny room for the achievement. Got it on my first try so can confirm.
---
No, a baby bill did later in the game
---
Same for me. Kinda really sucks.
---
this sounds extremely OP
---
If you don't have ruin, get the Hag DLC. If you do, just save for Ace with Shards. Other than that Ghostface and Freddy are both pretty fun and good. Myers is great too, and Laurie has DS.
---
Perma Oblivious when in the Dream World with Freddy sounds really strong.  Also a solid incentive to wake up.
---
now?
---
So I was trying for adept Nancy on PS4. Twice I escaped with just the perks, in order as they are in her profile, but it never popped. The first time I only burned a yellow envelope offering and the second it was just her perks. 
---
So I gave up and had unlocked her fourth perk slot and equipped Lithe and just kept her own perks equipped. Played a game against a pig and escaped and when I backed out of the tally screen I had a infinite loading screen. So a I closed application and when i loaded back in I was bumped back 2 levels and lost my fourth perk slot.
---
So I once again only had her perks equipped and went into a match against a Demogorgon and escaped and the trophy unlocked.
---
Change this Spirit with a ghostface and its legit for me
---
I‚Äôm able to play matches right now I‚Äôm currently loading in with friends
---
Haha we did this to a Ghostface. He found all four of us nodding at each other and them circling him, still nodding until he caved and crouched down and joined us. We were all strangers at purple/green ranks. Ghostface did a couple of farming but he let us out and we teabagged together at the exit gates as we left. 
---
It's nice to know (once and a while) that we can goof off... Because the Billy I tried it on the next round killed me instantly. Sigh~
---
Shame is so damn loud though

I was waiting for the update!

I usually try to get Claudette's out of the way first because they're a pain to find. I just had a team of 3 Claudettes and an Ash that dragged on a game for so long.
---
Try and wait for them to get into a good position with no cover, hallways are also very good.
---
Glad someone shares the same feeling. I wish they would just give her clothes a tad bit more brightening. Even when I play survivor half the time I cant find my p3 claudette teammate the entire match. Maybe once the exit gates are powered I'll see her. Lol
---
Mine has done this before when I saved it for a week or two. I actually lost two of my three I had completed when I logged on today.

True I always like using lithe but I prefer to use dead hard since I tend to get hit through windows a lot.
---
I haven't tried trapper yet.
---
This perk needs a buff: let's make it so that when the killer picks you up you immediately get down and get healed, then buff your gen speed by 100%, so the survivor can the survive and still complaint about how op killers are.
---
Maybe that's one of the reasons why it's been working. Sometimes just being close without line of sight is enough to get someone to go full sprinty. Hovering around rank 10 which means usually survivors between 5 and 12.
---
You absolute chad. üòé
---
This is true lol, idk why you got downvoted
---
*then
---
Yep, my first match in months and first time as demogorgan I get matched with rank 5s
---
If this is a joke about the perk Hope this is incredible and I fucking love it
---
I feel that bro. The one guy that distracts you ash, but it's not like you would see the claudettes anyway lol.
---
You're VERY wrong.
---
I hope you get matched with survivors your rank soon.
---
The only times I've every actually succeeded without Deliverance is very rarely in those choke moments at the end of the match when someone else is on hook, and sometimes right in front of people. 
---
By that I mean if I get hooked and someone is right there, I know I'll be saved super quickly, so I attempt escape for fun and it works on occasion
---
buy leatherface for bbq
---
Tbh when I see them load up into a game I switch my play style and load out they really hate franklins
---
Is that a Halloween reference
---
Seems the claudettes are downvoting me
---
I hope you like it
---
Try playing him a few times in a KYF match against a friend, just to get a feel for his lunge. Other than that try placing portals against a wall with a gen on the other side of the wall, when the portal is activated and you have your ability charged up you can see people working on the gen.
---
Other than that portal places that are more hidden scathered across the map appear to be good, if the survivors don't see your portals they don't close them and this allows you to keep map pressure high.
---
I just saw that 1/2 and was wondering what it was. I didn't see the second set in my trophies though.
---
Yeah I kinda wish they were colour swapped versions of their tops at least. I doubt they'd do anything too complicated cause they'd save that for the auric cells, but something more than barely noticeable rips would've been nice.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to prevent it matchmaking is a problem but you should just play the games you‚Äôre dealt, worst case scenario you lose witch could happen at any level. Best case you get a ton of bp for carrying a game.
---
Wrongest.
---
Omg yes Franklin's is perfect for swf or just immersive gen claudettes
---
Oh... well I‚Äôm gonna say thanks cause now I know what went wrong but also damn cause that should have probably been common sense üòÇüòÇ
---
I want a little baby Frank
---
Yes. The person with the flair hag husband plays p3 survivors with flashlights. Good observation detective. As for 3 killers being played. Wouldnt know. Only play hag. Surely you should've seen that comic detective.
---
I lost one completed ritual - had 2 other completed ones that remained. Missing out on the 4th which I had waiting to go now because of it...
---
It's not just low setting. It's like this too on consoles. 
---
Beards disappear in angles, hair looks like they are kitchen broom.
---
Even though Bill been on consoles for awhile I haven't leveled him up yet I might level him up next so I can get tier 3 bowered time on Jane and the rest of the character I play.
---
I haven't played L4D in some years but I would always hate going against The tank it always got my heart pumping fast.
---
Never more than likely. They're licensed characters.
---
Most likely never
---
The numbers are mostly placeholder, it's the idea of instead of the perk giving you more time when you don't need it, when a survivor has just gotten close to you, it gives you more time when you actually need it, when you are hooked and there are no survivors nearby. I also made this so that:
---
A) It activates twice per match. The effect of adding time isn't crazy strong, so there's no reason for it to only activate once like ds.
---
B) It's use case is more common. Moments where a survivor gets to you at the last moment or the killer is camping you are few and far between. This new effect will activate more often, and provide more use than the previous, pulling it out of niche, into a more mid tier position.
---
This is overall good IMO seeing as nancy has one God tier perk, and great perk, and one average perk, while Steve has one great perk, and 2 niche perks.
---
Give me some feedback or even number suggestions or different ideas entirely.
---
In some "survivor-killer codes", crouching in front of a killer is like- a friendly gesture? Surrender? In any case, they sometimes spare that survivor, it's funny :D
---
Restart the game that‚Äôs what I did
---
Unforunately it's never going to happen. Licensed characters can only be bought via Auric Cells or full chapters.
---
Okay so if you studied to draw can you also fix a car?
---
It's the same thing here. If you're equipped to make concept art and use programs to make skins, modelling etc doesn't also mean you can program codes. What a shocker
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level#Iridescent_Shards
---
Game wiki says it should take 217 games on average. I think the average game is around 12-15 minutes, so using that it should be near 58 hours, though I think that is actually higher than it needs to be. I would say around 40 hours, really I think that is still slightly too high.
---
They will not. Shards Are for non licensed Killers and survivors

That's probably how Steve feels. But he's wrong :)
---
It‚Äôs not buggy, just coded in a dumb way. He needs a full heal for it to work. It should be easier to activate the perk (like 2 people healing someone shouldn‚Äôt rob someone of the perk) but I‚Äôll try to make it work and see how it is

I thought this sub was being dramatic with the amount of people that take this fucking game so seriously. I'm a new player, and have played about 40 hours so far, and my god! Every game there's someone or their friends whining about something another survivor did or the killer simply playing the game. Incredibly bad taste for a newbie.
---
I believe they changed a few things for Freddy, there was something in the patch notes about him this update so probably just testing it out
---
oh ok, thanks
---
KEKW Clap
---
Huh weird well good luck
---
Is it just me or has every rank 16 killer run a pink mori with straight crutch?
---
So many. All using the exact same build. I just leave when the game starts and i see the sleep timer
---
It's a stereotype. I originally made this as a fun little nod to other killers who deal with these kind of kids, and to make jabs at people who do complain when they lose.
---
Yes! Also having issues where not every party member makes it into lobbies.
---
Sure, frustrate the new players. That'll keep them playing and growing the player base for sure...
---
I agree, healing with someone else not counting is really stupid, you healed a full health state, doing it faster should not punish you
---
Adams hair looks hallow
---
yeah its back up for me now but was down for about 3-4 minutes
---
"yeah man fuck people with disabilities!"
---
Yeah I have Ds and OoO which I got from the shrine but I might get her because I like her design and I rarely see Laurie's on console.
---
I don't own pig but I played her with a splinter and I went against some baby Dwight's I felt so bad for killing them.
---
Sorry I was slow writing the idea behind the perk. The numbers are placeholder and shoo uld probably change.
---
. . . What part of a joke/shitpost/meme did you not understand . . . . Lol . . . ?
---
There's a lot of weird matches that end up in laughs. While some people are really mean, you can also make some really good friends :)
---
See, you cant stereotype someone and then contradict it by doing it yourself. That's not exactly how things work unless you wanna reverse it to killer real quick, because then you're stereotyping yourself. Since it's just a joke that would be fine right
---
Steve‚Äôs prestige 3 look has me contemplating the grind.
---
Happened to me as well. I thought I was crazy, and then just chalked it up to "I Guess i redeemed them", but i know i didnt now that others are having the same issue.

OP survivors complaining about killers that aren't OP lol it's cute honestly

Can you really mot be bothered going against him. I fund him fun to go against

imo Halloween is the best one to get first,  1 very strong survivor perk that has always been meta and 1 fun killer with 3 neat perks that can synergize well with a bunch of killers
---
Are y'all aware of the Medic trophy not being obtainable on PS4?
---
Can't stand looking at her stupid face

Freddy is now basically immune to Borrowed Time so campers and  tunnelers are happy. Hopefully BHVR changes this.

I just got booted from a match while being killer and I'm wired so idk

On Xbox all I'm getting is Leather Face. I got 1 demogorgon game today, and 1 plague game. The rest were all LF.

---
Urban so I can crouch past the soldiers, Sprint burst so I can run past, balanced landing so when i jump over I can Sprint in, and Plunders instincts so I can get good shit
---
Honest question, is it considered bad manners to wait right at the exit line and let them down me and get knocked but still escape? I hope that makes sense...
---
I do it when I think the killer was good or I feel bad if they didn't get any kills. I dont tbag, but use the come here emote so they'll come smack me out. Sometimes it backfires and I get hooked but that's my fault for not leaving lol. I want to help killers get a little extra points but if it is bad manners, I'll stop.
---
I'll definitely have to do some testing to find other fun builds, pervy ghost face is always fun. Try to get full stalk from around corners on friends before they notice you're there
---
I know why it works the way it does, I'm just saying it's silly that it does since the entire point of the perk is anti-camping. That's all.
---
Freddy got buffed
---
I was pretty annoyed when my muscle memory of switching had me clicking a blank area for ten seconds. It needs to be added back
---
Worst thing about that perk is you can only use it 5 times since there‚Äôs 5 totems every map
---
All hail plankton
---
I faced a rank 20 trapper who clearly had just gotten the game, I saw him struggling to pick up traps and he finally did only to pick it in the middle of the road in haddonfield. I felt back to (with him watching) I walked up to his trap and got myself caught.
---
He then proceeded to face camp me....lmao, I'm sure he didn't know better.
---
Fortunately I escaped but the other guys were bullying him, I was going to say some good words and ridicule the bullies but he left the end game lobby right away ):
---
Yeah I thinking all female survivors are cute with the exception of meg I'm sorry meg mains. I really like Susie's cosmetic outfits. I wouldn't say spirit is cute but her cosmetics are awesome
---
Yes, it is
---
I kinda though of one where the Ghostface can only hunt the survivor for as long as the exposed timer lasts (maybe less) and if they don‚Äôt get hook them in time then they lose
---
I've been running it exclusively on my Steve: it *is* buggy. It doesn't work with Medkits, it doesn't work if you heal someone from Dying State, and since it requires a full heal it's incredibly easy to get cucked out of it. It doesn't even light up when fully charged until you stop healing so you have no idea when it's actually ready.
---
They're supposedly going to hotfix it so you can see visually how much you need to heal before you get it, so that's something at least.
---
i know lmao i always feel so bad after i stun her :,(
---
No it's really unbearable with the way people demand this game be taken with the seriousness of life and death.

In the end screen of each game, on the first page, it shows you your total blood points that you have after the game. Are you sure you‚Äôre not just mistaking that one for the amount you‚Äôve earned?
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this bug. Are you sure you aren‚Äôt doing something to use your bloodpoints?
---
The non licensed characters individually cost like 9k in game currency. You get different amounts of in game currency depending on your account level. For example from level 50 and above you get 300 for every 4200 xp (don't remember the increments for below 50). Average "full" match you get maybe 350 xp. Doing both the play first killer and survivor match daily nets you an extra 1000 xp per day. So in short, they really make you want to drop that money. Dlc is on sale pretty frequently enough where I personally caved and spent the 4 bucks for every one I wanted.
---
Fortnite is one of the more funner games in general. You can play with the mates and funny dumb shit tends to happen. Trying playing PUGB (rip), Apex, or COD and you won‚Äôt have that arcade feel to it. Those games have a more serious feel to them. I tried to play the new COD game but it literally had the same maps I have seen in the past 8 years but rehashed. Now I feel old lol
---
You can stereotype. Never said that wasnt allowed. I'm saying you csnt stereotype other people for something you're doing yourself if you srent including yourself in the group

Ya every other chapter has come with some free cosmetics if you buy the whole thing. This one just gives you a new shirt that you can‚Äôt tell apart from the default one. So when the most popular chapter comes out, they lock the good cosmetics behind a second paywall. Cheeky BHVR, cheeky
---
True. A lot of kids will legit act like fortnite creates some anime world with their own power levels. Shit is weird. Sadly it‚Äôs not just kids. There are some legal adults who are so mentally immature they act like this too. Only thing we can hope for is kids growing out of it. We‚Äôll see. Lol

I think DBD is one of those gamed where if you play toxic you will get DMed from pissed of players. Like 80% more likely than other games. If something unfair or I even had to go toxic in order to kill the last survivor I‚Äôm expecting a message immediately.
---
Or just never really play survivor. I P3ed nea but I suck shit with her.
---
Yeah Lithe is literally a trap perk lol
---
Damn!
---
First time?
---
Just played survivor in a custom, it was awful
---
Doubt they will they intentionally did this. They don't want the dream world to have a TR so that means no BT or killer perks like unnerving. 
---
Unless the survivor can approach while awake but that won't work against a camper usually.
---
I need to rewatch the scary movies.
---
Same here.
---
Ok, dont forget, im curious
---
I will admit to doing this as soon as things are going belly up in a hurry.
---
I'm here bud
---
The thing is you don't really need discordance because the portal will tell you survivors are near as well (If they're active at least)
---
That's a separate cosmetic for auric cells.

Funny. When I play survivor it's almost always claudette (p2 only, though) and I am the only one doing gens before I get hooked and then get to watch my teammates crouching all over the map being all sneaky like
---
Undetectable? I haven't gotten to play with it but I imagine it works when a Killer is "stealthing", like Wraith cloaking or Pig crouching. Freddy doesn't have one of these, since if a Survivor being asleep meant he gained Undetectable, he'd be in stealth for _everyone_ as opposed to the Survivor who is asleep.

Xbox One X runs perfectly fine.  No need to test PS4 Pro.
---
I've done this before and I only got one kill because a meg was being cocky and tried to loop me while everyone else was gone
---
I think 5 full heals are plenty. Though I see an issue when multiple people begin running it as all totems are gonna be gunned for.
---
Theirs a reason why its ugly CAUSE ITS LOW SETTINGS
---
Most likely less considering its pretty decent perk.
---
With Head On, you basically have 60 seconds of time where the killer can't hit you. Being in a locker means that you are in one of the safest positions. If the killer grabs you there, you DS and escape. If the killer waits for the perk to run out, 2 gens get done. If the killer leaves, you get a free escape. With headon, the killer can't even waste the perk as you're stunned from even trying to get the survivor.
---
Well of course. Obviously many in the cosmetics team are artists and they're probably not capable of doing a programmer's job. But what I'm saying is, expand the programmer team a bit and lessen the number of individuals working in cosmetics. Unless, UNLESS there are few people in the cosmetics team in the first place. In that case well expand the programmer team and/or give them better tools to work with when dealing with the game's issues. I think at this point the dev team should be better equipped at doing so.

We already had five licensed properties in the game by then (Halloween, Left 4 Dead, Leatherface, Nightmare on Elm Street &amp; SAW).

Freddy still has a bit of his old stealth power when survivors are awake, though for some reason they can still see him intermittently when he's close enough.

&gt;Doubt they will they intentionally did this. They don't want the dream world to have a TR so that means no BT or killer perks like unnerving.
---
&gt;Unless the survivor can approach while awake but that won't work against a camper usually.
---
Which is wrong.
---
If a Freddy is camping, you will either passively fall asleep while waiting for an opportunity to make a save or he will hit you on your way in to the save. There is no "just save while awake, lol". 
---
They need to make Borrowed Time distance based instead of Terror Radius, like MYC and Devour works. 
---
It was the only reliable tool survivors had against campers.
---
Lol stfu and get good
---
It was never a huge issue in games with coms or even with people who play slowly and don‚Äôt rush out. But it will definitely teach those newer players and older ones that cleansing totems is rewarding all around even without the perk.
---
Question is, why? So you're not farmed? Chances are if you aren't unhooked at that moment by the person the killer is chasing, you're not being unhooked and will die on the hook. Rare times there's 2 survivors coming for you.
---
Had a crash too. Except this time I was able to report the crash with the log already included.
---
Doctor is a prime example of this. He makes it _very_ easy to find Survivors, but his power is nigh useless in a chase. You have to be _so_ precise with both positioning and timing for a shock to disable a Survivor's vault or pallet throw that most of the time he's just an M1 Killer. Legion is the exact same but with a long as fuck cool down and no benefit to using his power on a Survivor a second time.
---
Still making the "Hold M1" for 30 seconds more wont help.
---
We dont need extended gens.

---
I was thinking more for map awareness and using the portals as efficiently as possible, as I feel like discordance would pair well with portals. You can better plan out your tactics for gen patrolling that way, imo. I'm imagining discordance with the portals could significantly aid your ability to force survivors to 3 gen every match.
---
Yep, they talked about in the dev/ptb patch notes
---
You‚Äôre right, but logically the odds are it‚Äôs a console player. Either way, the dude should have at least tried to ask before going immediately to assuming dude was dumb
---
I still see it, Jane. Bye.
---
I have enough time to play but i don't get paid till friday, at least it gives me more time to save up BP i guess
---
It‚Äôs pretty good I just haven‚Äôt seen it posted on here :p
---
No. They were being tested.
---
Thanks, I didn‚Äôt think of that lol. I hope they fix it soon tho
---
You know in this situation, it's smarter to just wait until they're mid animation and then get the grab instead of flying in with a lunge, then the guy stays on the hook, and you get a free down
---
It took me a while to realize what the difference was between the 2. Then I was like ohhhh! One of the shirts has some love stains on it.
---
I mean, killers quitting will still cancel the game even with dedicated servers
---
yeah I survived and was supposed to get adept Nancy but it didn't pop up that I got it :/
---
Only for the PTB, and because of the PTB, they decided to work on them more as it sounded like they would have made what‚Äôs currently bugged even worse. Sometimes the frames are just bad on PS4.
---
Not much talk about it, sadly. 
---
It isn‚Äôt the best add-on by any means but I do find it sort of handy, especially since it is passive and doesn‚Äôt require channeling, sort of like a perma-Aftercare.
---
Had a SWF and ran it and we we happened to be up against a Rancor killer. Because of the add-on, I was able to find my obsession friend and cover her as she escaped.
---
Thats why i said skill floor: Mechanically knowing the best way/when to use portals and lunge is key to playing him well. Hag can spam traps, Demo is super limited
---
Would be in for this!
---
why is her arm fucking broken
---
Or, as the occasional killer, you can only do well with the basement.
---
AKA
---
A shitty killer. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
I did enjoy this but it was a bit laggy
---
It was worth every penny.
---
New survivor: Rocket League pro Gimmick of Cloud 9
---
Easy with the buds there bud. I‚Äôve lost offerings having the match load full then say it was canceled because someone disconnected, I‚Äôve also not lost offerings in the same situation. I‚Äôve had matches not fully load and still lost or not lost my offerings because as I said.. it‚Äôs already burned. I play on PS4 and PC.. same on both.
---
I put that in the post but we're on PS4. I think this is a PS4/Console problem only but it's been a thing for awhile now. I've recalled a couple times where I've gotten what you said but most times we don't get anything.
---
It is
---
Because people are useless garbage, glorified balloons filled with flesh and blood
---
Yeah I had 4 killer DC's in a row yesterday. Not bullying them or anything, just about to escape with everyone still alive.
---
It's out in full force today because of all the baby killers getting on lol
---
Okay Sandra say hi to the kids for me x
---
$% of a gen is about working on it for 2-3 seconds, really not a massive change
---
Dwight: Damn Nea is ugly up close.
---
*"THERE'S A STRUGGLE MECHANIC PLEB"* That doesn't mean you're safe. The killer will just knock you back down tf.
---
Better advice would be 'Dont keep beta testing this game until they make it decent"
---
That's one thing that is interesting is he is limited with his portals I would like it to be maybe like 1 or 2 more but that could also break any sort of balancing. So we will see when midchapter patch comes which will also bring the archives event
---
In-game store.
---
You never get full alternate outfits with DLC like it used to be before the introduction of the Store. Now all you get is a single reskinned/recoloured cosmetic.

idk though because if i‚Äôm running BT and some dumbass cancels my unhook and gets me killed i‚Äôm finna be PISSED

Using only the basement is impractical, I‚Äôll use it when I‚Äôm near because that just makes sense.  The only thing I‚Äôm getting from any of this is you‚Äôre an incredibly bad survivor. Disconnecting from the game for any in-game reason is pathetic
---
Damn, that sucks...but at some point I'll definitely have to give in to the S C O O P S
---
My dumb ass just stared at this for a straight minute waiting for it to pop out until I realized it was a picture
---
Thoughts &amp; prayers
---
P3 at rank 14. How bad is that nea?
---
Fps drop super frequently on my own personal xbox experience (as demoboi)
---
We weren't bullying them either. We were all just leaving 3 of the games. One of the games we got a guy off the hook who was being facecamped at the end and he DCed immediately after lol.
---
Or when teammates sell you out when you need to use the rest room real quick :(
---
I get the desire for dedicated servers but the way you're trying to get the point across makes no sense because even with dedicated servers you can't have a match without a killer.
---
No, it doesn't. Survivors who are asleep are now under the Oblivious status effect and therefore cannot see killer auras.
---
What dedicated servers? Who told u that? I dont see any here.
---
This has already been posted before kid grow up and make your own memes
---
Run small game for a bit it's what I do with a new map and windows of opportunity. Helps me learn the totems and vaults and so on.
---
If you got a friend can even do it in kyf a few times or find someone here.
---
I don't know how much tiles move and change on the new map but most maps have a certain level of randomness to them and that's why to my knowledge people don't bother with maps.
---
Good plan
---
It‚Äôs better than having a terrible killer map and getting a gen done because I made the wrong read.
---
Either extended gens or a Ruin with good totem RnG and that it gives more skill checks.
---
You don‚Äôt want longer gens because you don‚Äôt wanna stay X sec longers on a gen ?what is wrong with you ? Of course it will help.
---
It will increase game times,meaning my Gatekeeper emblem won‚Äôt always be bronze and more in the Survival emblem.
---
Games would last longer and I WANT that,doing gens is too easy and Ruin barely slows down that.
---
Gen Rushing is a thing.
---
I see it as an absolute win
---
David and Jeff disagree
---
Thanks, but yeah I thought that it would be free because it was announced so long ago
---
Way to miss the point. I said "somewhat" imbalanced because the guy's argument was pretty much "the guy was stabbed anyway so what's a gunshot the head at this point". You really don't see any flaws in this logic?
---
Fastest way to do it would be to play each side once a day, for both killer and survivor you get around 300 bonus xp for the first game of the day.
---
I just want survivor dailies instead of sacrifice 15 newborns under a bloodmoon as the doctor
---
My man, Ash. I have a very similar looking coat.
---
*Pops Tier 3*
---
I believe so. You can just wake up before going for an unhook. (Fail a skill check, grab a clock, etc.)
---
Believe me I'm pleased
---
fucking finally
---
Thank you
---
We did it bros!
---
I agree on that point, not the best logic to use.
---
I'd give it the drawback that it DOESN'T avoid damage by itself, so you'd need Dead Hard (which means also being injured) to tackle safely. Otherwise, the killer can hit you in the face when you start winding up the tackle to interrupt it. This means a vigilant killer is not going to fall for it (sorta like a flashlight) but can come in clutch if you get the jump on them.
---
yeah its got lots of uses for everyone really
---
Ok. Thanks for the input
---
Y'all let me know when they make this game decent in 2021! See you then! Scoops ahoy! Enjoy your bugs
---
can beat'em join 'em
---
AFter this DLC I have 0 faith in the devs to listen to feedback. Archives looks awesome, but re-balancing from what we say? Don't hold your breath
---
Having the same problems, ended up not being able to play the game with my friend so we switched games. Hopefully they fix it
---
You could always join a party on xbox for it too. But my last match in custom was fine, strangely
---
That's part of the rework. It's a weird "Ignore the obsession" perk now where hooking non-obsessions gives the action speed penalty to non-obsessions, and the obsession has to be kept alive to keep the slow. 
---
The crashing though isn't intended.
---

If I'm the host and you bring me to the basement, expect it. Sorry, not sorry. Play better
---
Im calling it now the next survivor will actually be a youtuber/twitch streamer type of person idk who a killer could be
---
Seperate, AvP (2) was a disgrace.
---
I had some people message me over bugs. Most recently this Dwight came into a match against a Myers. Note here that they had a medkit. They got hit first, got away and found me and another player. Both of us tried to heal but didn't have the prompt. They got all pissy, DC'd then decided to tell me to kill myself. 
---
Over a bug. That they would have saw. With their MEDKIT. So yea. Some players are so ridiculously toxic that it's frustrating sometimes.
---
It would make sense for them too when the switch / mobile version comes out to boost play counts along with m&amp;k support
---
Yes, because ‚Äúplay better‚Äù is something I should take seriously from someone who can‚Äôt handle getting hooked in the basement
---
They explained it in the patch notes post and they said it was a problem with the new swf reque and instead of delaying the update, they removed and said they'll get it fixed

Well... stay clear of the basement.

Maybe try it

Couldn't you tell with the tie? It's obviously Dwight.
---
Don‚Äôt need to, I perform adequately as is
---
Same could be said to you, kiddo.

It looks much better in-game.

Same its frustrating as hell trying to get us all to join the same lobby right now

If you add gen rushing then I would think you were my friend

Piss

Did what? Your game is still a buggy mess.
---
Be proud of your dumpster

I don‚Äôt join random parties on Xbox. Ever. That‚Äôs how they get your IP.

Regardless, I only play this one solo. So any issues effecting SWF and KYF doesn‚Äôt effect me.

Doesn't claustaphobia need three ranks? IT should be

"Your struggle meter is filled by 25/50/75% when dragged into the basement by the killer"
---
Got to give them a chance, you were a noob at one point.
---
Maybe I'll try it
---
Time to run Small Game with this.
---
Killer is Gibby
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAA holy shit
---
It's basically a straight line lunge tho. Easy to dodge...
---
Honestly a Xenomorph/Ripley chapter is my dream so I wouldn't care if it had other characters, but it'd be nice
---
Not as a killer, apparently.
---
Imagine hag with demigorgan
---
Literally, two days ago somebody DCd directly after I pulled them off the gen at the beginning of the match by sneaking up behind them as piggy.
---
The other survivors found them, then spammed faults and had me come over to the body with them as they pointed and shook their head and tbagged the body 
---
I was dying, to say the least
---
Are you talking about shred or lunge because every killer except Myers in tiers 1 and 3 have the same lunge
---
I played trapper twice today. This never happened on my end. I did encounter different bugs though. It's not a dbd patch without trapper bugs.
---
It‚Äôs on the stairs
---
The issue is there is too much variance between top rank and bottom rank.
---
A lot of Rank 15+ players can barely do the gens as they are now, while the top 10% in Purple/Red ranks fly through them effortlessly because they just hit every single Great Skillcheck and budget their time very well.
---
So long as there is such a massive gap they won't fix it because balancing for Red Rank ruins it for everyone else and vice versa.
---
Was healing myself and they got me from so far away, tbh I just didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd make it.
---
like?
---
Idk man it just pounced at me
---
Really? Well I guess I'll try again but I've tried earlier and achieved nothing.
---
yeah the ponytail with bangs for feng looks pretty bad now; the bangs are mostly transparent now compared to how it was before.
---
You actually cannot prove that. I can, however, prove that you‚Äôre a bad survivor, the evidence being that you‚Äôre completely ready and willing to ruin four peoples‚Äô games at once just because you screwed up
---
Nice croping
---
I was not expecting a YTGAS reference on dead by daylight. Nice. Art is cute as well
---
i'm playing on xbox one and everything looks pretty much the same to me
---
There's one on each sets of stairs even.
---
Power move is to buy the complete look but not wear the hat
---
I don't think you're fit for online gaming if words on your screen turn you off :P I mean, that guy is a douche but still.
---
Same here, maybe Ps4 has a visual glitch?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs it‚Äôs secondarily ability called Shred. If you see the demogorgans head open up, make a hard right or left. It has a big tell and he can‚Äôt turn during the pounce
---
For real. I have so many map and key offerings that I‚Äôll never use.
---
Yeah but the survivors don't even get to see what the killer was doing/ how they behaved. Spirit just shows up, hits you, get outplayed.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is these perks could be good
---
Damn thanks man
---
You'll find me around rank 15, because Iridescent Lightbringer is not enough in itself to pip.
---
\*sadf\*
---
He‚Äôs won one fight against a human, but every time he‚Äôs gone against a demo he‚Äôs come out on top. And remember, the Demogorgon eats bullets like a sponge so the fact that Steve can kick that monsters ass is saying something.
---
$10 for a skin D:
---
Yeah but that games free... OP has a point about that at least
---
Yup super annoying. Pls revert BHVR
---
which episode is this from
---
Oh, wow. I thought there was something wrong with my speakers or my computer software issue, but it was bugged huh?
---
Robin: *Wow, you‚Äôre a whole new man.*
---
i like it better
---
Agree 100%, I really hope this gets looked at soon!!
---
I'm not sure the "99% themselves with Self Care" needs to be avoided, though. Healing yourself 99% with Self Care would take almost twice as long as getting healed normally, so I don't see why someone who would run this strategy (for some silly reason) would be reason enough to not allow the Second Wind
---
I can't argue with that. Many programmers and level designers there are pretty bad tbh and they should give them courses to improve or find someone else
---
About the designers I'd rather let them be since they are doing a really good job. Is one of the things that's on point. The spaghetti codes in the other hand..
---
Nothing is different.
---
Wow, $12 for the DLC, is that common? Everything else listed for $7, right, even Saw and Nightmare? I mean, I get that there's another survivor, so a buck or two more, but that's almost twice as much.
---
I know for most maps it wouldnt be possible but this one seems the same haddonfield and old badham in that the map is exact same just randomised pallets and generators each in certain areas.
---
Delete it or stop bitching ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Haha jk....unless?
---
Demogorgon is THICC
---
1 am
---
Would have been better if he ran off triumphantly and instantly stepped into a trap.
---
No, I guess they just wanted to be viable for the day
---
Aw what a qt
---
Obviously they‚Äôre celebrating their new baby
---
Everyone here is a little gay, apparently.
---
We had 50% about 3 weeks ago
---
Like 20 killer maybe 7-8 as surv
---
Yes, Im really sure the total BP after the game overrites my remaining BP. Now I was playing a match and the Killer disconnected and again a friend and I didn't get the fucking BP...
---
You know, because you aren‚Äôt allowed to bitch about a game and enjoy it at the same time.
---
My Algebra 2 teacher looks like a Dwight, **_HMMMMM...._**

I cant play until next week because I'm currently in the process of moving 3000 miles. :(

Actually, to be fair, the wording and last photo is different, so it‚Äôs possible they just had the same idea
---
Reminds me of that episode where butters sees dead cartman whule hes not dead lol
---
play demogorgon. Easy.
---
Wait, really?
---
Crap, I didn‚Äôt know that.

r/unexpectedrickandmorty

Not in the match i just played, neither staircase had one.

A lot of people will dc if your not playing demogorgon.

Besides that, they‚Äôre probably just sore losers

Yeah im really hoping
---
Where did you hear/see that? I paid full price for the DLC on PC and Xbox
---
Stuck on loading screens, game freezing, game not loading tally screens and having to close out.  It's only been doing this since the patch.
---
Survivors don't care anymore
---
Wow, feng is actually getting another outfit
---
She is. They just fancied playing her, and thus decided to use strong add-ons. There are rumours that they're nerfing her add-ons soon, so people will be rushing to use them

Not the stranger things one but I saw that ps4 had a discount for other DLCs.

Every time. I stg

Possible, sure. But not practical at all. Defining what is/isn't a lunge, and how long you've lunged for would be impossible. Turning would be a nightmare so you'd get 360'd a ton. In theory it sounds neat though.
---
Some people can afford it and love to look good and at the same time support the game they love.
---
I was waiting for this to be posted just saw it elsewhere.
---
Why do you think she comes out the lockers healthy.
---
Some people like getting ripped off
---
Unless you're a high rank. Good killers will mind game that
---
Now I'm not good at this game, by any means, so I'm used to dying and slowly learning the ways of the game. My theory is that in the higher ranks, people get more and more competitive to the point where they take it so seriously that they decide "if I go down X number of seconds after game start, I'm leaving". Just basic childish rage quitting
---
With our luck, some bugs were caused by the hair textures or some shit like that, and that‚Äôs why they did it.

Oh you mean that dingleberry that's been stuck to the back of her head? She keeps cutting it off but I hear the entity finds it hilarious.

I‚Äôm JUST going to buy (the whole set)the hat i swear.
---
One of 3 things usually happens and often benefits the person they "save."
---
You unhook team mate, killer downs and hooks you and you get the safe unhook for bp, wglf stack, and rank points.
---
You unhook team mate, killer downs them again and rehooks and you get another chance to escape.
---
You unhook team mate, killer downs you then goes to chase them again and you can possibly get the unhook points and stack and another team mate can get you up.
---
Or I guess there's the 4th situation where the team just stands there like and idiot and never of you get points or get away.
---
Look how they massacred my girl...
---
I mean there will be a rebalance Jo matter what they do it all the time every new chapter. But if I see a battle pass that they try to sell to us I will flame them because all you are really doing is adding lore to your game and your charging us for that. I can understand a battle pass esk thing in a free game where you pay for it but in a paid game it just irks me
---
Jacket + shorts + puppet = me
---
That's some of it, but people are mostly just trying to queue demogorgon rn to test it and learn counterplay
---
Don‚Äôt be jealous of my scoops ahoy outfit.
---
Quick and Quiet, Pre-Nerf Decisive strike, Urban Evasion, and Lithe. You NEVER know when you're gonna need to quietly vault a window and sprint far away then crouch behind a wall trying to escape an Alien.
---
Oh, and an Insta-heal.
---
At least you got the new map haven't seen it at all
---
People are trying to queue demogorgon to test it as a survivor and learn counterplay. Especially at higher ranks
---
They should make an red addon that takes the texture of whatever's below the trap
---
https://i.imgur.com/1yJFmMB.jpg

Another one because she wants the full costume to be seen.

Oh god that Ash leatherjacket. It'll be the first time I spend money for an outfit.

I know it‚Äôs a joke and I‚Äôm not telling anyone what to do, but playing Spirit vs the new guys feels like bad taste. Just me though!

Welp guys, pack it up because one salty survivor main doesn't like the dlc

Oh yes I agree after this update I've been losing way more frames than usual.

Definably agree

I had a game with a plague running that. Both her her and I were rank 7, but the 2 Steves and the Dwight were rank 20. It broke my heart seeing them panic lol.
---
Is this happening everywhere? I know if there's little elevation differences the traps tend to go underground. 
---
Big deal if it's doin that everywhere though
---
OK, I assumed you were talking about that since it just came out. Sorry. 
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt keep up with EU sales so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a region thing or not.
---
I dont have to give a link kid I seen it before on here stop actin like you made it your self
---
That is true. To be honest I really love how Warframe did there battle pass system mainly as it's free but it also rewards you depending on how far you are in the game and gives more challenges
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for Dead Hard he‚Äôd be dead 
---
Or maybe otherwise
---
One literally was the gen jockey for the whole game. Never got a hook save or anything.
---
I need P3 head on the Scoops body
---
Wait foreal? In the store too?

Make them rely on some other factor, or keep them the same but prevent you from pipping (except for addon moris just hide in a locker then)

I agree. I literally thought the Kate player got hooked and her voice glitched out, but then the Kate joined me on the gen.

I hated those kinds of shifts back when I used to work retail. Literally your whole day is gone at work.

Yea i guess my ghostface doesnt cut it then :(

Nice title

After some of the stupid shit people have posted the last couple days, I'm not sure if this is real or not.

Dude wtf is wrong with their code if one button delays a whole entire feature

One thing I don't like is the new "party system"
---
I edit the main post.

And yeah, EU post arn‚Äôt that popular it seems because the us discount got on my main feed, while I‚Äôve never seen EU discount appear there. ü§î
---
I hope that didn‚Äôt happen to my rituals.
---
Leatherface isn't a great killer, but his perks are some of the strongest in the game. Very much worth the purchase
---
I love that Ash one
---
Nah , I'd honestly play a lesser killer like Legion or Plague . Spirit is my main for higher ranks ! üëç but to each their own .
---
she looks like shes at an anime convention doing a JetSet Radio cosplay
---
give it like two days, and then people will be dc'ing against demogorgons because theyre tired of him

Mine have all been Bubbas and Plagues. I've seen demo twice and thats all :(

I have to do that

Did you look at the flair? might help you out.

Oh no... she‚Äôs hot!

---
I googled it and only found one post on the steam forums from 2016 with the same problem. I'd contact their support, something seems to be broken on their end.
---
She needs to invest in some new shampoo
---
First
---
Oh thanks. Didn't see that.
---
Nentity, I mean Nea.
---
Match making has been broken for awhile.
---
This would legit be dead hard and head on at the same time and it sounds amazing but very risky cuz you'd have to run away at a close proximity even if stunning
---
This is not due to optimisation. Optimisation issue is the beard not showing up at certain angle.
---
But that hair has to be a messed up model. I want the old style back. I don't care if it doesn't sway and just stationary like David's hair for example. It'll be better than this new mess.
---
It happened to me as well. One remained and I had 2 different and unfinished ones. PS4 player here. It was very saddening.
---
I really hate that they got rid of the quick switch to killer/survivor button
---
I love your art stlye. It's very unique
---
what's wrong with the linked guides?
---
They mentioned in the initial PTB Patch Notes 3.2.0 under "Art changes" "Optimization of hair materials."
---
What is this adorable creature?  Dr. Michael Harrington?
---
You know it did. This is DBD.
---
The opposite for me, actually. I can‚Äôt get Nancy but yes. Same type of issue.
---
So you become toxic just because of people picking a character? Wow, people wonder why everyone talks shit about the Reddit community.
---
ye I know DBD guys get rock hard at the idea of buying a new sweater for half the cost of the game.   
---
And boy do they hate anyone who think they should be $5 a pop.
---
It does work against Freddy's Dream pallets, however it works only when your not in the dream state. The devs answer this question in the mid chapter dev stream, at time stamp 28:35. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dSX_MgLNuHA
---
5 games in a row so far with every surv being toxic after game :') good community.
---
Ive been using up my fragrant tufts in preparation to prestige mikey and ive felt like this for the past 5 matches when i get t bagged.
---
Not to mention another person has to come pick up the slug, meaning only one person is left working on gens. This is the most efficient way.
---
I kind of hope it's the same here, with just shards, auric cells and other things that don't impact the game directly. Imagine if they put like 300K bloodpoints in paid route. LMAO I would lose my mind
---
You aint missing much
---
Doesn't change my point. It's still something owned by someone else, added into something owned by another.
---
Yeah, this is a meme that's literally how memes work. I don't get what so hard to understand about it. The text font + first + last panels aren't even 1:1
---
Man I feel you, and it's at random too. Some chases are good but others are crap
---
99.9% of my brain: ***If you want to get a perk you want and hope for it while this meme says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that. Don‚Äôt give me hope.‚Äù Then basically you‚Äôre still probably getting more hope***
---
0.1% of my brain: ***The meme is just saying ‚Äústop giving me the perk ‚Äòhope‚Äô‚Äù***
---
A?
---
What did they say?
---
Hair is horrible right now, all of Nea‚Äôs hair looks like fuzz even on Ultra graphics. They really need to revert it.
---
Is it just me or Borrowed Time won't ever work when Freddy's Camping?
---
The exact same pictures? Line them up 1:1
---
Character data is saved in the game's personal profile for you, not on the xbox servers
---
Not like Demogorgon is a good substitute. Its flaws become apparent pretty early in the ranks.
---
You realize how hard this would be to code? Dynamic texture mapping based on position? If there are multiple textures, what then? A better addon would be to make them invisible to survivors, at a cost to carry capacity or setting time.
---
my updates stuck at 1% copying * angry demogorgon noises*
---
I've almost stopped playing killer because of it.
---
Well this new system is terrible lmao
---
dude i feel you - I'm right there with you :C
---
Only 5 more hours and i too can enjoy the new DBD updated and the risk of rain 2 update!
---
like i understand the rush of "haha we outsmarted killer" but survs constantly being rude and telling killers to "kys baby killer" ruins the game for me, i left League of legends because of the amount of "kys" and insults that come for no reason
---
In conclusion: I guess many Redditors have never seen this meme prior to the other post. [Has the idea been done before? Yes.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d01dwr/groovy_patrol/) [Did I make the image? Still yes.](https://imgur.com/a/866WWEM)
---
All of them perks sound really good/fun
---
I don't know what it is, maybe my sensitivity is too low or what (I'm on console), but I've recently started missing a whole hell of a lot of hits as killer. I've reached purple ranks regularly but I feel like I deserve to stay at 13.
---
That looks like Jake if he stole Claudette's hair. Jakdette is op.
---
I would literally never play survivor again. Plus I'd DC instantly from lobbies where survivors do it.
---
I'm not a moron. I know what I'm doing when I'm unhooking you in front of the killer. I've got cards up my sleeve, and I'm giving you yours.
---
So I can just buy the DLCs for myself and not lose progress?
---
He has the hair of a God. I thought this was established already.
---
Basically any survivor when they get hit by the pounce.
---
What sale?
---
How many times do you heal in a single match? if you we're healing more than 5 times before this update, you might be wasting time a little bit.
---
Ive been killing it on ps4 with the demo. He just needs a good build and add-ons that work together.
---
Na
---
I swear to Entity, that if they fucked up Neas pink hair, I‚Äôm gonna lose it
---
No need to start a console war and be one of those people Staircase

Yes. I bought a new PS4 a while back and I didn't lose any of my data when I forgot to download some characters.
---
Trust me, I learned the hard way that saying ‚Äúgen-rushing‚Äù is the perfect way to get absolutely no serious replies, since everyone but those who want to help will just get upset at the term.
---
I honestly thought that posts with the hair changes were someone meming with MS Paint.
---
That can happen sometimes if the killer dcs. But I‚Äôm still not sure if your not mistaken about your blood points being just overwritten. 
---
Can you write down the amount of bp you have and then look at the last page of the endscreen to see if it adds up? 
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this happening but a new update just dropped so it could be a new bug.
---
One of them has stuff like "After hooking a survivor, you shouldn't stay near to the hook as it's consider an impolite move. Don't worry, you'll have chances later to hook the survivors again."
---
Good job, you just told asshats how to be asshats.
---
The correct way of explaining it would have been to make clear that staying near a hook is the factually wrong play in most cases, because whilst it assures the 'early' (with 2 minutes waiting time) death of one player, it allows 3 other players to just pump out gens and leave. "You will get far more kills (and points, and probably fun) out of using the pressure you generated by temporarily removing two players from the equation (one hooked, one who will have to unhook), by finding the survivors still working on gens." would have been my approach.
---
Don't appeal to a new players sense of fair play in a competitive game. Appeal to their desire to actually play good (in the context of ranking up and winning matches).

I got it for free on PS+. Happy to support the developers for their continued good work.

In a party, when a match is found, it shows some players as ‚Äúin match‚Äù but others‚Äô game freezes and has to be restart. Smh

The game crashes like crazy

True. I‚Äôm assuming this is a killer that I‚Äôll get better with in time. Plus those tea-bagging flashlight-clickers probably won‚Äôt be doing that when people start to get better at him. Toxic people tend to sprout up around this time when people are getting used to new killers so they can get easy wins and hopefully some hate by just beings dicks.
---
It‚Äôs been this way since Ghost Face came out iirc lol
---
Damn... I haven‚Äôt had any real problems. But I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll do something about it pretty soon if it‚Äôs that extreme.
---
I keep getting matched with really high ranked people. Not fun.
---
No offense, but I've played it on both consoles and pc. I prefer pc obviously, who doesn't with DBD. Just so much smoother but I have to say that even on the newest xbox, it is a little worse than it is on PS4. I love xbox, dont get me wrong, that's what I'm playing Borderlands 3 on right now but Dead by Daylight isn't as good on xbox as it is on ps4 and they both don't come close to how smooth and nice it is on pc.
---
Do that with everyone
---
Only thing i lost when killer dcs is my offering on Xbox. I got all the bp and 5k bonus for escaping.
---
This new update to the game is wild
---
It's not hard at all, wot. „ÉΩ‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩÔæâ
---
Get current top most texture below trap and map it, wrap, get nearest pixel color for any missing cuts and done
---
Oh my god thank you so much!
---
I‚Äôd love to see the chick from Misery running after  survivors
---
True. But I‚Äôm betting that the people that get good with the Demogorgon will be shoving those toxic survivors into the depths of the Internet, where they‚Äôre gonna get upset about the Demogorgon being ‚ÄúOP‚Äù and ‚Äúunfun to fight against‚Äù because they can‚Äôt bully the baby killers anymore.
---
Classic DbD matchmaking right there. I‚Äôm on the opposite end of things and it‚Äôs equally as frustrating. I‚Äôm red ranks, I don‚Äôt want to go against yellow rank killers. It‚Äôs not fair to new people or people still learning and practicing.
---
yep i can confirm it. had 3 crashes in a row after reaching 8 stacks
---
This is a regular occurence to me today. At this point going against green ranks, not purples/reds(as a rank 19 killer) is lucky...
---
Matchmaking is seriously bonkers.
---
I played one a few minutes ago against a godly nurse. 2 disconnected and the other got mori‚Äôd. Spent the entire match babysitting hooks.
---
As a high rank player you should know how tough it was to get there when you started out, and how helpful it can be to have a good player on your team.
---
I did the reverse where I made him wear the hat with normal clothes and my friend hated me for it

Going into network settings and testing NAT type usually fixes this for me.
---
I would like the wendigo as well. I've seen that the Xenomorph is a highly asked for killer but I'm honestly so f***in' sick of hearing about the Xenomorph so I'd have to say besides Pennywise which is someone I would absolutely love to see in Dead by Daylight, the Wendigo is probably a high one on my list
---
What servers
---
Or Goku and his weighted clothes.
---
Getting a Mori means downing you at least twice.  That's like saying you'd DC when a huntress hits you with iridescent head because she didn't "deserve" the down. It's a powerful add-on, but they're fairly rare. 
---
I don't know man. You just come off super bitter. Just try and relax and enjoy the game.
---
Wait did they actually rework this face or am I tripping from this distancep

So much lag when playing on demogorgon Xbox one x 
---
FPS lag it like fluctuates between 20 and 30 FPS no joke.
---
What part of the demo does this guy think is OP? I mean, the shred is EASILY dodged, and the tunnels are ok but not insane. Good god. Seeing the forums actually make me grateful for the subreddit
---
God I wish that were me
---
I choose to purchase skins because I know it supports the developers while at the same time getting something out of it. I enjoy playing the game and I will show my thanks by purchasing these things.

You honestly did really good with only two perks.
