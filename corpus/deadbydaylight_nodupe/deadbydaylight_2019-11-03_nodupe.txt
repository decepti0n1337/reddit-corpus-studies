I did the crows challenge as a killer.
---
---
---
Or you could just trap around loops/in grass near gens and chase survivors into them.. ya know. Play a game that‚Äôs fun for both sides and not resort to NOED.. for a trap challange.

Ah yes, poor people shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy entertainment, shouldn‚Äôt be able to have fun, shouldn‚Äôt be able to live life, and they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to exist with some purpose. All poor people should just sit in their room and stare at a blank wall until it‚Äôs time to buy more groceries / pay bills. That‚Äôs their only reason for existing in life.
---
I once found another P3 quinten and it was a rare sight
---
Avoid the steep parts of the hills and use jagged edges on the sides the smoother sides actually function the same way, they stick out a lot more than it seems. And for some reason closer to the bottom after using the sides of the hill the game won't register it as a fall so no stagger takes place. There's also a slight elevator glitch on one of the MacMillan Estate map variants with the giant tree in the middle. And on the map that released with Legion you can mostly clip through the trees while crouching for that real sneaky goodness.
---
We are booing you becuase this ideas already been done
---
I keep forgetting clown exists. I‚Äôve never played a single game against him. At this point it‚Äôs really becoming an odd statistical anomaly.
---
Is this satire? Spirit is one of the easiest killers to learn lmao
---
I was saying the same exact thing.
---
Because grabs are risky
---
This.
---

---
I know people have complained that killers require Ruin etc but to me DS and Borrowed Time are now mandatory on survivors.
---
Ruin to slow down the early game, camp and tunnel all game, then NOED for the endgame crutch. Thats all I‚Äôm seeing.
---
Thats if your teammates even do gens.
---
Its sad as well because many killers play like this, then cry when nobody wants to play solo survivor anymore and suddenly every lobby is a 4 man swf all with DS. All the shitty players make it that way.
---
They could do Jacket as the Killer and then and unmasked Biker or Ninja Lady as a survivor
---
That‚Äôs the second spot I see with this update. There‚Äôs another one on the spirits map. Do you know of more? :D
---
Its more of a swf kinda perk
---
I'm a spirit main and I agree that spirit needs a Nerf, not a huge nerf but some slight changes such as making hurt survivor sounds omnidirectional
---
I'm totally with you. I spent $40 and I understand we dont get 2 killers due to licensing issues. But the delay for the halloween event is unacceptable. 
---
I think the game looks and runs great and the sacrifices that were made in the graphics department are absolutely worth being able to play portable. 
---
But why dont we get the updates like the other consoles? If its a day or two later with a patch thats one thing. But this is a MAJOR event we're missing out on. Mortal Kombat 11 updates the Switch with the other consoles, as I'm sure many other 3rd party games do. 
---
Unacceptable in my eyes. They should've been open about not updating the Switch version when people bought it. 
---
I hope this post gets a lot more visibility because it doesnt seem like anyone is talking about it.
---
the audio logs and animations in the Archives...?
---
Ever been exhausted on the ground?
---
Pinky finger clown should be omega blink nurse.
---
I don't have any Licensed Killers, and I've been saving my shards for Killers, making an exception only for BBQ.
---
Doesn't Legion instantly fatigue upon missing a Frenzy stab, though?
---
No, but I hear about them all the time and there is always at least one in every patch note that needed fixed
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, the Switch support so far is really a shame, which blows because I've enjoyed it so far, but Switch players are kinda excluded from everything right now. I would hope it gets better, but I doubt it, it'll probably always be a problem for them. 
---
The new "November Days" cosmetics were announced as out on all platforms, yet not on the Switch as well. 
---
The Switch shrine of secrets is also different from all other platforms for some reason.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the withering blight Halloween event is just scrapped altogether for the Switch version, the 3.3.0 update hopefully next week, otherwise they're going to have to do something to make up for the less days to complete archives/rift content.
---
*laughs in spine chill*
---
Yes on PS4 and that‚Äôs probably why
---
that epic xd
---
I like how originaly the legion was all dark, gritty and edgy and so harder to spot.
---
Now we go full glow-in-the-dark where we can see the killer from a mile away.
---
I love this.
---
He is the prophesized one
---
Do you know when it was changed from general perk to teachable perk
---
Wanted to finally credit the cosplayers when I saw them again so here goes:
---
Quentin is on Instagram @reap_an_sow
---
Legion is on Instagram @therealjerodwhite
---
Ace is Twitter @KamikazeGamer3
---
A single instaheal wasn‚Äôt so bad at all. I didn‚Äôt mind it when playing killer.
---
However co-ordinated 4 man swf with the syringes? Yeah that was bullshit.
---
I‚Äôm really surprised they nerfed instaheals to be honest. I would guess that its due to how multiple instaheals stacked with a 3-4 man swf
---
Imagine being a pig main lol
---
They can nerf keys when they nerf moris, and actually make the guys on opposite sides of each other. Instead of right next to each other, cause as a survivor then u have no chance whatsoever. Why should one side have the better chance over the other?
---
Oh, so he's Bi!
---
No, she reappears a bit sooner
---
It happens unfortunately. There was an event last year that PS4 only players missed out on due to the update failing certification. 
---
Switch is a new platform and will eventually get sorted out.
---
I can understand from a survivors point not to be forced to play with iron will but from a killers POV should they always have to run ruin ? I mean its gone within 40 seconds of the game start anyway, A serious balance on both sides with game mechanics needs to happen imo,
---
Or maybe... Double gay? Gay¬≤?
---
Can I get an explanation please.
---
Acting like she takes no skill lol
---
Ive played so many spirits that are complete garbage. All they can do is camp, tunnel and NOED to win just like a trapper or wraith.
---
There must be some skill involved because low rank spirits are fucking garbage.
---
Billy is the one where anyone can pick him up and wreck a team
---
I believe it was in July
---
Good middle ground would be a specific killer ranking and a general one. 
---
Kinda like Smash Ultimate's ranking. Your general killer ranking is very close to the highest ranking killer.
---
Naturally this would be flawed with how often DbD's ranked resets but it's a start.
---
Read d tag lmao
---
I thought I read or heard somewhere that survivors were annoyed that they got blocked by the nurse as she was blinking by an invisible wall so they added an apparition where the nurse is blinking to, to avoid survivors hitting the invisible wall
---
When I first saw this I thought the guy was Freddy and that would've been pretty dope
---
No offense but I wouldn't take tofu's opinion on basically anything DBD related, considering how he plays the game and his overall opinions on it being as "fun" and "casual" as they get. Not to say he is wrong or right, but regardless.
---
Even better that glitch has been around forever. Had a game like that can't heal, can't dead hard, can't decisive strike, can't do gens, and then to top it off when I escaped it glitched and put me outside the map where I had to wait until the egc killed me.
---
i finished this challenge in 2 games. I started as survivor then as killer without even thinking about it.
---
Crows are usually chilling by 2 or 3 of them, so it's relatively fast to accomplish as a challenge.
---
Has anyone seen the level 4 challenges? I randomly got to view them, and some of them are like...nearly impossible. Like, "kill 4 survivors with tombstone in one round" level impossible. 
---
C'mon bhvr. Not this shit again. Round 1 was so good. Hard is good, but unreasonable isn't. 4 gens with dark sense in one game. 4 different survs in bear traps. 3 safe unhooked after end game collapse. 2 flashlight saves in a game.
---
The glowing shards don't help if she isn't in sight when starting the phase
---
You still can! Go to extra-life.org, you can join team Reddit or make your own team!
---
With the current meta, autodidact.
---
Good luck pulling off a full WMI heal when most killers dont leave the hook.
---
I just looked it up and it said you can‚Äôt derank below 15. I actually didn‚Äôt know that tbh, thankyou for making me aware
---
We are surviving together in *spirit*
---
Literally just played a killer match like normal and it was really easy. Just running around like you would do normally makes you scare crows
---
Yeah ahaha I was referring to the ghostface he went against, probably should have worded it better. I'm not sure if links are against the rules, but the video I was referring to was: "NO MITHER VS GHOSTFACE"
---
Claudette is one of our main characters. That is why she feels a lot.
---
They started tracking progress a week before the rift released, no one knew, so if you played during the week you got a head start.
---
When people call adrenaline 'NOED' for survivors
---
LOL
---
Someone‚Äôs salty. I enjoy his streams never seen him promote toxicity so whatever dude ‚úåüèª
---
I took a normal mask I found from Spirit Halloween and spray painted it to have more of a white color. I used clay and paperclips for the braces design on the mask
---
Sounds like you turned the difficulty up to Hardcore, should give you 100% BPs
---
Do you not remember the Neon Nights Legion skin, granted not as glowy visible af
---
For how long have you had this issue?
---
Seriously, queue times seem to take fucking ages for both sides.
---
That ^ these new (/s) wonderful dedicated servers have kinda made dead heard a 50/50 perk. Sometimes it will work, sometimes not. 100% chance of working if you‚Äôre far enough from killer and are using it to get to a pallet or loop.
---
I dont know realy happent around when i finished the f√¨rst one
---
3k and close hatch, then 4k
---
They should at least double our double blood points event to make up for it or something
---
Shrine got reset when the Halloween event released
---
"rUN a PeRK tO cOunTEr A kIlLEr"
---
No problem
---
Only people who escape an iridescent head can enter the salty spittoon
---
F. How was I supposed to know that and can I see the original?
---
Warrick kappa shorts for David and shirtless Jeff yes please.
---
he gotta be a hairy boy though.
---
Entity takes people who do sick acts and makes them killers, takes people suitable to survive. Pits them against eachother, killer sacrifices survivor to feed entity via them eating the survivors soul piece by piece, their hope waning.
---
All of the active lore says they Mysteriously disappear or are enshrouded in dark fog
---
This is an alternate dimension. Not spring break.
---
It's basically hell.
---
Become obsessed with a female survivor and dress like her. You never know if it‚Äôs your teammate or Norman Bates.
---
No not really, iri head is objectively overpowered and all you have to do is catch up to them and get to point blank range if you can't hit them from afar, like Billy
---
Nerf her add ons there op as fuck (prayer beads)  but tit for tat How would you feel about disabling comms for swf so you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the where the killer is ?
---
They just wake up at the campfire again. Of course it's got alternate rules, the entity's realm is basically a hell.
---
Pretty sure the opposite of that add-on is insta downs
---
drawbacks? pinky finger has zero drawbacks unless you sacrifice a guaranteed hit to miss a throw, which is your own fault. Insta down hatchet only gives you one, but everyone pairs it with infantry belt, so barely any downside when compared with the reward
---
God damn it. I was one level away from being able to pick up Ruin.
---
But shirtless David tho
---
Noob question, but what do you mean by rank 15 to find lobbies?
---
Must have forgoten
---
I remember this one.
---
Yeah I wana know how this raises money, please elaborate.

For me its just hits through windows and pallets still feels iffy.  I've plenty of times vaulted a window, took 3 steps , the killer quickly swings near window and hits me nowhere near the window/pallet . 
---
Spirit is also just in general unfun to play against.
---
???
---
Pyramid head would be sick!
---
This method of DC is console specific.  I'm sure OP plays on console.
---
yea
---
If she uses her power in short bursts she can pretty much instantly phase walk again...
---
You.. you know you can make a wall of text right?
---
I have the same reaction when I start to grab someone from a gen, but then the game hitches and the gen gets completed instead
---
Killer life.
---
same, hopefully the 13th
---
Getting a 4k VS. getting your ass beat by a tryhard swf
---
... An add on that‚Äôll let you insta down a survivor yes.
---
I dont belive that vigo becomes killer.
---
Those were their suggestions, I still think she needs a kind of set back similar to how nurse must lower her head after blinking multiple times, With spirit we have to walk away to escape her tracking but when she notices she'll just come out of her phase which will usually end in the survivor being found. One of my suggestions was to introduce the collision mechanic into more of a counter play for survivors, While phasing she would have to actively avoid survivors because of they bump into each other she'll be knocked back to her husk with a minor stun to give players a chance to actually escape similar to how nurses head lowering signals us to gtfo
---
...6
---
How much are you people playing?
---
They said on stream that it will be more like a year
---
I keep losing my items even when I escape with them. Is this a bug or was this implemented in the new patch?
---
Edit: Platform is PS4
---
What???
---
No they dont have it
---
Sums up the DBD experience these days.
---
Of course this killer had NOED, if they camp/tunnel all game they always have NOED. It‚Äôs such a shit toxic perk that lets them get away with that playstyle.
---
Just be glad your team mates did gens. Normally I loop a killer for what should be 5 gens but everyone is still running around looking for Ruin, or waiting on others to take it out. Nobody wants to work through Ruin. 
---
You do all the hard work and get left to die at the hands of some tunneling shit that users NOED as a crutch.
---
Whats worst of all is when they camp and tunnel all game and try to deny survivors safe unhooks, then if they win they have the nerve to slug for the 4k. That really needs to be removed from the game.
---
If a killer has played wel and wants to slug im fine with that, but it sucks when you‚Äôve had a boring unfun game with some douche that wont leave hooks, then they slug and make you stay in the game even longer. Then they cry to the devs to give survivors bans for disconnecting.
---
no, not every spirit main uses prayer beads, i play green/purple rank killer and purple rank survivor, and in both i dont see keys in either
---
This is amazing! Though I don‚Äôt play Nurse, if you happened to make a Huntress or a Hallowed Blight Huntress you would have a customer üòâ.
---
Oh my God noooo
---
Please tell me this is a joke, I don't want this in the game lol
---
Think you could upscale that Ghost Face one to 8K? It‚Äôs pretty rad
---
no, i havent been on  reddit for that long, but i dont see how that matters
---
Oh ok, kinda stupid. Thanks
---
It‚Äôs been intermittent for a while. But it wasn‚Äôt until this update that it got obnoxiously long.
---
Borrowed Time.
---
Still has the encounters kinda luck based for survivors but I like the idea
---
There's literally no evidence to indicate this person in the audio logs and animations is Vigo.
---
She's a slow killer, so catching up is harder. Without add ons you have 1 shot before you need to break chase. With infantry belt, it gets a lot harder, that thing shouldn't be pairable with iri heads but still I would rather face iri heads huntress than even vanilla spirit all day long.
---
Looks like the Wrath wanted to see what the other side was like.
---
so her base is pretty much the same, just the addons got switched
---
When people only complain about killer perks while don't even mention survivors one
---
I'm a Nancy main and can confirm this list is wrong
---
Along with the 3 second recharge rate thing per blink
---
Upper left, the eye that says ‚Äòprologue‚Äô
---
I'm guessing donations go to the fundraiser, like all other fund raisers
---
Thanks :)
---
I dunno man Legion was pretty stupid strong for a few months when he came out lol. I still have PTSD flashbacks
---
You just matched with Seal Team Six buddy, get ready for the ride of your life
---
Well, spirits can‚Äôt see survivors too when she‚Äôs phasing. What‚Äôs your point? The comment is that spirit receives no feedback when using her power except for scratch marks - and survivors also can hear her phasing unless spirit is using prayer beads. So by your logic then the power is fine but the add on isn‚Äôt?
---
I'm curious how much they're gonna try to charge for this.
---
Yes to the Nurse daily dont know about the other one
---
Adrenaline- Requires all gens to be done before it goes off
---
NOED-Rewards you for not doing your job(Defending generators and hooking)
---
Had to look for myself, thanks for link. Why would they even mention it under unsportsmanlike conduct if they don't give a shit?
---
Didnt she also lose 1 blink?
---
Killer lobbys take literal HOURS
---
Hes good at the game with alot of hours in. Whats wrong with ohtofu? Fun is a good priority and the game is casual because if its lack of balance right?
---
We'll make it
---
I can't even get into the main menu it's still say that can't connect to the servers, but the few matches I could play were instant (Survivor and Killer - PS4)
---
Lmao,he was very annoying (a lot) but I think they should had nerf him way less than what they did
---
Apparently you do
---
Does Ruin have that same connotation? That's a crutch if I ever saw one (90% of killers seem to use it) but I never hear people calling it one.
---
those suck for both sides. Only hooking people twice doesnt give you shit for points or pips
---
im trying to figure out how tf do you have 2 monitors but still uploaded the picture with your phone :|
---
nice post tho
---
Escape cake, party streamers and wglf all make you go nuts with points. Even more so with x2 bp
---
He vibing
---
Killers are meant to be able to hit through windows
---
She is balanced besides the way she can bump into survivors and that one addon that she is known for. Make that addon pink and the glasses purple. Get rid of her bumping into survivors. Other than that she is balanced
---
National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1! I got the DVD for this movie in some old KFC dinner and a movie package. Man, maybe I should go back and watch it again, I haven't thought about it in a while.
---
Oh yeah, and the meme is pretty good too
---
But they are both tied to the same event.
---
Equalization.
---
Oof
---
Yeah but when you are p3 in game points dont mean anything
---
"Be A dOuChEbAg"
---
It‚Äôs gonna be complete garbage
---
Ah reminds me of the VIP and Hunted game modes in Counter-Strike and Team Fortress. "Assassinate the high value target" would be a fun game mode but the issue is the VIP could easily be facecamped or mori'd. Also something like Myers with Judith's Journal for faster obsession stalking and tombstone piece. 
---
OG Dying Light basically turned into protect the obsession. 
---
On a side note, one of the later tome challenges actually involves killing 5 obsessions, presumably by any means so there won't be an influx of rancor users or moris.
---
Bold +1
---
From my experience it's mire connection based than anything
---
It's just a bitch to go through three notifs
---
Adrenaline- All gens done,activates and its a kick in the killers balls,nothing he can do
---
NOED- Same thing,need 5 gen,but survivors can easily do 5 totems,its not gonna fall your hand to stop gen rushing like there is no tomorrow and to some totems
---
You do realize Spirits can use Stridor to counter Iron Will, making it not a reliable ‚Äúcounter‚Äù against her.
---
that does nothing though? making it rarer doesnt stop people from having them stock piled like many do. I have over 50 iri heads on huntress already. Thats not a nerf, its a dumb suggestion
---
OP: Ignore the flag please
---
# ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
Not everyone is going to want to run spine chill for a killer they may or may not get tho
---
Put on a swamp map offering and go fuck with the crows on the boat/pantry. Each individual crow counted.
---
Considering the Halloween event is handing out flashlights like, well, candy and telling us we have to use them or lose them we'll probably see a lot of this.
---
Oh..... sorry.... your right
---
So you will get in about 8 games considering the killer queue waits
---
I mean honestly, a giant spider demon thing has got to be into some kinky shit
---
If I owned one of the most iconic horror characters of all time I would encourage people to make them sexy
---
yeah im definitely gonna take the opinion of the guy who realizes this game is as far from competitive as it gets
---
TFW everyone always forgets Victor Crowley. üòï
---
honestly the best part about ghostface is that he can do the Tbag dance. survivors immediately know whats up. with any other killer its infinitely harder to make them understand that youre about to fuck around
---
Good conversation. Have a good one.
---
Oink
---
M&amp;A also offers a wider FOV while not in a chase
---
Give killer at least one update before nerfing one of the two only viable killers please lol
---
Could you link it? I've been trying to find it
---
Through Sloppy Butcher too.
---
Damn it! But ya you‚Äôre right...and I think autodidact has its place in a medic build
---
I mean, I think those harder ones are more for after the rift ends. Like if you really want to unlock the lore and cinematics.
---
Yea seems like I‚Äôm gonna have to just go for the unhook with that perk rather than make sure it‚Äôs safe which sucks
---
Such raw power
---
What you're saying, "be unpredictable and always break the distance", can be said about a counterplay to every killer in the game
---
Freddy is viable without addons through red rank.  It isn't a 2 horse race.  Please stop pushing this false narrative.
---
Hopefully Art, the Blind Man, The Leprechaun, Freddy, Creep, and Babadook are all completely off the table.
---
Im still not over how they can instantly go from crawling on the ground, slowly bleeding to death, to swiftly jumping into the hatch.
---
Lmao whose fist is that
---
I think they should make her phasing sound directional
---
you are not a p3 clown, you are the entire circus
---
If you don‚Äôt wanna feel like you‚Äôre farming your teammates, what I did was just put on We‚Äôll Make It so I can heal them right there and that 99% ensures a safe rescues as long as it‚Äôs not billy or Myers at the wrong time.
---
Something something Anal Beads bad
---
Yum
---
OhTofu just uploaded a video on this topic, it's definitely worth to watch. https://youtu.be/aMRKm7Jz-08
---
You're?
---
If legion celebrated day of the dead
---
weird. i usually find games instantly as killer on ps4. whats your NAT type?
---
True, I mixed it up with The Demo because he had a Basement build video on that map for him aswell, my bad.
---
But not like 7 feet from the window
---
Someone doesn't understand how lighting works üòï
---
cuz you are most likely a hornball
---
They take longer and longer to get into! I've actually been playing killer a bit just for the archive missions but the waits are terrible. I load up Netflix and just chill.
---
I've played him a couple times. Only for challenges really. I'm not a fan of him or his ability
---
Was already posted
---
Thank
---
Play jumpscare Leatherface where you just hide in random buildings with insidious and use the chainsaw noise dampeners, 
---
that's easily my favorite build to use because I like jumpscaring them
---
No, I still hope for shirtless Myers, I will not stop hoping until they give it to me üò§üò§üò§
---
For ps4 EU rank 6 it takes legit 20 seconds. Wtf
---
It‚Äôs all good, some people on this sub are just assholes
---
Can‚Äôt even play the games with my friends as we can‚Äôt join each other‚Äôs lobby‚Äôs never mind matches.
---
SHIRTLESS MYERS INTENSIFIES!
---
True,i miss the old legion tbh,maybe they buff a little him again,who knowns
---
It can kinda be justified as it‚Äôs the text version of the observers thought but it‚Äôs pretty jarring when he talks like that in every page.
---
I know we don't really want FNAF coming to DbD because of the really weird side of that fandom, but damn the more I think about it the more it makes sense depending on how you do it. It along with Slender and Amnesia really reestablished the theme of helplessness in horror games that got lost through things like Resident Evil making Chris Redfield a main character. DbD might not have even been able to get its feet off the ground if that theme hadn't become the norm again.
---
Idk so much about Freddy Fazbear being the killer, he's a bit too goofy, but could you imagine being chased by [Springtrap](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/e/ed/Extra_Springtrap_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20160529043921), a serial killer trapped and decaying inside the suit he used to murder several children? Or even [The Puppet](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/8/89/ThePuppetFullBody.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/195?cb=20160529091041)?
---
Do you play killer at all? Lol. Watch the killer slug and kill both or bbq n chili kill the scoops
---
Idk how you were able to do that so quickly. I've been trying to get in a lobby as killer for like 10 minutes now.
---
I've never had to wait longer than a minute on PS4. Rank 1 killer
---
That's actually a pretty cool idea. Especially for killers who have to wait 500 years just to get a lobby.
---
bro you good?
---
Well PC can be considered to have a difference mainly due to them actually getting bearable frames
---
It has been said the Observer is a new character in a devstream,  alas.  Vigo = The Alchemist... well...
---
Yea I agree, people at high ranks don't "wait out bt" 15 seconds is enough time for any high rank survivor to make it to a strong loop, and bar that every high rank killer knows to look out for decisive strike.
---
Waiting out bt would  only really be viable as a last hook attempt in the endgame collapse.
---
These people downvoting are either survivor main meme lords or low rank players
---
Even if it is twice the killers they named thats still only four/three out of 17 .Hag isnt near billy spirit freddy and nurse in terms of actual power imo shes not bad but isnt great either. Huntress gets worse and worse the more maps they add do to them being indoor and just the sheer amount of l.o.s blockers. And nurse is nurse no matter what u do to her power she still is nurse the one that can blink through walls etc shes a different case entirely. And i agree with them doing it when they want how they want but ppl are chomping at the bit for a nerf and this can easily turn into a legion thing where they just nerf her to get ppl to shut up. And im js if u buff underwhelming killers they could pull off a nerf on spirit since ppl will have other killers to actually play.
---
This post on my feed is below two posts about Julie's ass in the new day of the dead skin
---
This sub is too thirsty damn
---
r/shubreddit
---
Assuming that description allows for sacrifices as well as deaths.
---
Nurse daily is currently broken. Just trash it and do a different one
---
Ahh those ones, I've seen the one with the rock with that cgi abomination besides that haven't seen much of it haha. Isnt really a horror though
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind noed if it only worked on the first surv hit
---
you‚Äôre not getting hacked you were just a victim of a glitch :l
---
For ps4 NA rank 7 it takes legit 5 minutes. Wtf
---
Killer queen has already touched the exit gate
---
Pull up Netflix, it's the only thing that makes it bearable for me.
---
Exactly lol. Once they optimize the game for console and fix some things id be down to play with the pc player base but in its current state id be just as happy to get cross console play.
---
Ps4 master race confirmed
---
Scoops could hide in locker. Killer has no reason to slug when he doesn't know where the last guy is
---
Real original
---
The first two rows are realistically the only licensed killers to remotely expect.
---
I think it's EU master race confirmed haha.
---
How about if you are downed and the killer is looking for the other survivor?
---
How long has it been broken for?
---
Ive haven't had a lot of killers not sweat the 4k. I get slugged all the time
---
However, the way you do it is very important to conveying the meaning.
---
Several short and rapid crouches is Teabagging.
---
One crouch, about a second long, is a Bow or Curtsy.
---
Tfw the switch players still don't have it. Sad. It's not in the general pool of perks but since knock out was in the shrine... I suppose we will have to wait for it appear. I just want the extra bloodpoints ;-;
---
Ah, okay so you had the wrong idea of what challenge the rest of us were talking about
---
I feel like facecamping destroys sfw because they focus on saving their friend instead of doing gens more often than not.
---
Not sure. I only became aware of it the first day of this newest update as I got a nurse daily that day. Got a 4k with her no problem with several blink hits but no progress towards the daily ritual
---
with dedi servers it can be a bit of a dice roll sometimes.
---
If it's not an objective, why are we given objective points for cleansing? monkaHmm
---
I‚Äôm disappointed we didn‚Äôt get Halloween costumes for Halloween. I know hollowed blight is for Halloween but still...
---
I'm starting to think I'll make more guides just for that reason alone tbh
---
Give it up for day 18
---
And if you're walking, you still disturb grass on the ground, and it makes bumping into you way more likely. The issue of Spirit is that all of the "counterplay" is complete guesswork while the Spirit is given a LOT of information on your exact position.
---
Which is weird because I‚Äôm almost completely sure that the Killer disconnecting counts for the daily ‚Äúescape as soandso‚Äù quests.
---
Why not Freddy? I mean, if DBD were to make a FNaF character it certainly wouldn't be Freddy, as Freddy is a child. But why not anyways?
---
Shit now I feel bad I'll just play tomorrow or something
---
Gens literally go at mock 3 speed when survivors actually do them tho
---
not only you
---
This is clearly false because every time I use a tombstone I lose so hard the survivors are showed my address so they can come beat me up and call me a loser IRL
---
Even so they still have to work for it
---
The voice over is sooooo rushed too... Like, the guy has a pretty good voice but he talks so damn fast.
---
hahaha nice one! Like when I bring the exhaustion hatchet and forget to have it, waiting for DH
---
Gl with that. I‚Äôm close to having to do that.
---
Ah yes, the good old "nobody stepped into a trap all game" special.
---
Not him. The guy from the hollowed blight found vigos journals and experimented, but it ain‚Äôt vigo.
---
Its happening on xbone as well, good work on your comment btw, in depth :D
---
Had a game like this today as well and it‚Äôs absolutely unplayable. No HUD, no skill checks, no perk icons or status indicators, just the map title plastered on the bottom. 
---
The only thing that made it bearable was an awesome Huntress. When death became imminent, I called her over and showed her my cool ghost flashlight on the wall. She nodded excitedly and let me escape. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
But otherwise... this bug has been around a while and is utter trash. 
---
Has anyone experienced it as killer? I‚Äôve only experienced it as Survivor for now.
---
It‚Äôs interesting, but I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish here to be honest. Are you saying dead by daylight has a lot of micro transactions?
---
Not really lol you just hold m1, it‚Äôs not much different then a killer who doesn‚Äôt deserve it
---
someone dced
---
Not everyone is gonna wanna ‚Äútake it easy‚Äù just cuz it‚Äôs an event. Some people just wanna play the game the normal way, and that‚Äôs twice as true for red ranks, where the majority of the competitively oriented players are
---
"Everyone needs to know how not gay I am. I'M NOT."
---
There's also the Trapper one that does the same thing. 10 levels worth of "cosmetics" are the same thing.
---
(Although I will be hanging 3 Trapper icons on my Trapper's hook.)
---
Damn, she looks like a god awful Magic Eye image, lol.
---
Who are you to dictate how people play or don‚Äôt play? Why is it so bad that red rank survivors want to play to win?
---
What are you talking about? Before dedicated, Killers had 0 ping and their game state took priority. Dedicated servers are mathematically infinitely worse for Killers than Survivors.
---
Dedicated servers mean Wraith getting stunned into fake-cloak, Myers dropping back a tier randomly, survivors making super sharp turns, and gen grabs getting dropped.
---
It depends on platform and region. From what I have experienced the survivor ques are slow on PS4 and killer ques are slow on PC
---
David has no mither so he can have the best tbags always
---
I have found time of day to be a very important factor as well. 
---
In my experience, during daytime there is an abundance of killers. Moving into the evening hours however, when all your friends log on, there is an SWF abundance and people are either playing SWF or don't want to play as killer Vs organised groups.
---
Moving into the night hours again, the pendulum again swings back to an abundance of killers.
---
Ughhh this is The crossover I needed!!
---
It's a common joke. It's trying to sound like a teacher educating a class of children. It's only condescending if you're oversensitive and read too much into every turn of phrase.
---
upvoted solely for josef
---
Where can I find a list of these level 4 tasks?
---
That's sort of what I'm saying. The main point I'm trying to get across with it is to show people how many microtransactions Dead by Daylight has *in comparison* to a free-to-play game *on top of* DLC *on top of* having to pay for the game.
---
Kingsmith!!

hope this will help
---
Yes, sadly "Auric Cells" is a completely made up value that can be whatever the fuck they feel like.
---
Reskins of the base characters default pants can be bought for 50 auric cells. Are they actually worth that? 1. Fuck no. 2. There's a free option to grind for them. But, when they put that as a *reward* on the battle pass that's "50 auric cells of value."
---
God I hate companies trying to use their premium currency to justify 'value.'
---
It's the same as Auric Cell bundles. They market it as "Spend $118AUD and you get +25% cells free!" But what they really mean is "If you're only buying what you need to get an outfit, we're going to overcharge you by 25% of what we need to make a profit, so give us more money instead!"
---
I dunno man me and most of the critics n shit say otherwise soooo
---
Agreed, I have always noticed that Spirit was bs, and I don't see how players didn't notice. but, Nurse needed this rework and it isn't even noticeable to me when I play her.
---
So far killers have been seriously sweaty during this event
---
Every killer has the same lunge distance (except Myers) but Freddy has a smaller weapon and it feels unfair to be hit by him sometimes.
---
The second you down one survivor with it it gets cleansed, your just to lazy to find totems
---
Same here I'd take him a thousand times over Pennywise
---
its never enough, i just keep spending and spending ahhh help me
---
 that pun was horrible and i loved it
---
I say we should get a futuristic killer that can sabotage survivors perks and items and screw with vault points and generators.
---
This is extremely correct, but but scoops ahoy Steve in teabags to be toxic
---
They're going to fix this one in the next hotfix, thankfully
---
Killers are just as bad. Never seen so many ultra rare add ons
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
Mandatory as in you have to use it or you get stomped. Not that the game actually forces you
---
I didn't take any photos of it but I played a match today as the Trapper and had a Nancy get stuck inside of the cobblestone wall next to the pig tree on Coldwind. Game is full of bugs, but until we address them they probably don't know about them.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqtztd/ps4_glitch_the_archive_page_4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
so my game glitched and when I clicked on the archive I could see page 4.
---
Lol fuck that daily full stop with new nurse. Shes garbage
---
Since I'm a weeb, if it were a licensed one; MHA's Stain due to his unique lore and powers. Would prefer a non-licensed Wild west era Cowboy killer
---
Because literally every perk does? I don‚Äôt understand your reasoning
---
Yup, it‚Äôs Amanda üê∑
---
moochel moyors
---
Facts. Im not saying to throw but maybe dont tunnel and proxy camp with 5 gens still up? Like we re not putting a whole lot of pressure on you so its not like you have to go for a 4 man slug play .
---
I'm surprised how often this movie gets brought up in here. Does it have some kind of decent seized following of people who really loved it? From what I remember I thought the movie was pretty "meh" and forgettable.
---
Rank 12 surv, rank 11 killer right now in the Midwest.  Queue time for surv is usually 2-3 minutes occasionally up to 5 to get a full lobby.  5 is the minimum number of queue time for killer, goes up to 10-ish to get a full lobby regularly.
---
All they have to do is add a counter flr how many dull totems are on the map so survivors know how many they need to break.
---
That makes sense. I just use Kindred, so the survivors can judge on their own if they should rescue me or not.
---
I think it‚Äôs still in the works. I‚Äôm 99% positive they announced it‚Äôll be coming to Switch but at a later date.
---
I suck at Nurse and the 2nd game I did the ritual I was like "OH MY FUCKNIG GOD! THIS IS BULLSHIT I DID THOSE TWO GAMES FOR NOTHING!" They should really fix the  ritual :/
---
Don‚Äôt you have something better to do lol
---
I mean... you typed this like you were still angry and ranting at the person who argued with you after the match. It wasn‚Äôt us.
---
It sounds like the voice guy is at 1.5x speed. I just turn him off when I read.
---
The remake was, but the original was good.
---
And that is flexing how?
---
Good news, you just have to get a 4k not 4 mori, the text said kill so I was sure I had to perform 4 mori to complete the challenge, thankfully it was just an oversight
---
I would have been kinda tilted because the first guy I hooked suicided so I couldn't mori him lol
---
That's reassuring to hear. Maybe it was announced on a stream or something and that's why I can't find it. Thanks for the information!
---
I think it‚Äôs supposed to be broken glass.
---
Ooooof
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was. I just replied to any comment
---
Can't wait until they nerf Spirit as much as they nerfed Nurse. The meta will be so stale as killer when Spirit gets her nerfs.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt you have something better to do lol
---
Sitting in killer queue at the moment so no.
---
I really hope they fix the daily soon then.
---
Could've just commented lmao
---
Okay, I got quite a lazy and stupid question, what does Mettle of Man do now?
---
again its a glitch and will be fixed
---
Legit, 3 games in a row last night i had a pig that camped, Iri Head huntress with mori and NOED and a prayer beads spirit with NOED and mori
---
Thank god they were trash though
---
I honestly dont know why this is so funny to me. Like im actually crying right now
---
Sea captain who barely made it alive from a siege of modern day or historical pirates as a survivor, killer could be like Black beard or smth
---
It‚Äôs like baking a cake, it‚Äôs bland until you put the chocolate Blood Warden frosting on it
---
Oh, thanks!
---
I don‚Äôt think deerstalker is worth losing a perk slot over...
---
 The truest thing about this is the shitpost flair. There are plenty of situations where you get down / no pip for bullshit, sometimes you just get early killed and camped / tunneled. If you want to get red rank you mostly have to grind
---
Better than waiting the entire bleed out timer if my teammate is going for hatch.
---
The wiki says it was announced early July that he was coming to console so that sounds about right.
---
That brutal strength while cloaked is insane!
---
i still dont get it.
---
Because they *are* on the line
---
I think nurse has a slightly longer lunge and ghostface..... Oh ghostface......üòì
---
I got to rank 5 earlier and now the games are over in about 5 minutes even if I run pop and ruin, it's wack
---
I feel like This is Not Happening is a perk that implies that the survivor is freaking out or can't believe what is happening. Therefore, I believe the perk should work like this:
---
* Grants a 50/40/30% chance of triggering skill checks
---
* Each skill check will have one effect such as:
---
1. Fast skill check
---
2. Change of screen position in which skill check appears
---
3. Small skill check
---
* Each successful skill check will give you 100/75/50% bonus bloodpoints in the Objective Category
---
* Failing a skill check will cause a slightly reduced progress
---
Their real lives
---
Ruin is more of a mandatory fix for a broken game
---
You have a rank as survivor/killer. Theres usually more survivors then killers, and killers can only be in 1/5 lobby slots at a time as opposed to 4/5 slots reserved for survivor.
---
Queues pair you with people 7(?) up and down from you, except for rank20 which is unlimited range. If your rank 19, you can only get with people from 20-12 which is a fairly small range. If your range 15 you now can get from anyone in 20-8 which is a huge range of people to find, especially since most survivors hover in the 13-5~ish so that they arent in red rank hell for their respective side and its the post reset area for at least decent survivors.
---
So if your playing killer at rank 19, you can only join specific lobbys, that only fill 1 person, with a smaller pool of survivors searching. If your rank 15, you have a wide net to catch servers and survivors in. 
---
TLDR: queue times are faster if u can play with more people and the way the ranking system works means you will rank up at low ranks if you breathe, naturally putting people in higher ranks.
---
I just think the juxtaposition of the inconsistency of totem spawns and the consistency of noed as an effect are incompatible.
---
Stridor exists so why bother
---
Useless? it's such a good perk.
---
Well, the number one rule of Left 4 Dead they try to drill into your head is "don't run off alone". It's shown in the intro sequence with the Hunter incapacitates Louis.
---
Sure, Bill can take on the likes of the apocalypse, but that's when he was armed with fully automatic weapons and had three equally as armed and capable people with him.
---
In the Entity's realm, Bill is now alone, unarmed, and facing supernaturally powered beasts. 
---
He doesn't even have a weapon to melee shove spam his way to the saferoom smh
---
Seems like you don‚Äôt play the game a lot or even know much. The major crowd is in PC. The game started from PC and then trickled its way to consoles. When I play on PS4, I don‚Äôt mind matches for long periods of times. When I play on PC, i get matches back to back to back.
---
I run spine chill at all times. Have been for months to counter Ghostface and other stealth killers. It doesn‚Äôt matter if spine chill goes off. By the time you move, Spirit will be where you are. If you hide, Stridor will give your location off. You can‚Äôt mind game in pallets bc Spine chill goes off if she is looking at you and if you run away from the pallet to avoid her, she will see your tracks while phasing, hear you better with Stridor and or trick you so you leave the pallet and get to an unsafe zone.
---
Please don‚Äôt talk about the game as if you know everything. Seems like you‚Äôre missing a lot of information. Take or from player that spent thousands of hours as a killer
---
Also, watch the most recent video by OhTofu please
---
Dude who the fuck cares it's a ACTRESS. The photo isn't even anything bad she hugs a body pillow of a merch being herself? If it would be nudes or some other crazy shit I'd understand but it's a person of public entertainment hugging a pillow calm the fuck down.
---
Clown mains never get respect :(
---
Just wait until Christmas time when we can be the most holiday appropriate killers in the game!
---
The problem isnt the controls for Nurse, its the frame rate. Too hard to see things while blinking.
---
Bbq, deer stalker, knockout, and nurses. Rewards good snipes by letting you immediately slug and go after another target. Someone goes to pick them up and you see them. Not too meta since there's no gen control, but it feels satisfying
---
Oh yeah. Those too
---
Just throwing this out there, but maybe people play Legion because they enjoy playing them. Just an idea.
---
It‚Äôs not true most of them just use Commodiuos Toolbox with Brand-New Part and Prove Thyself just to fly through gens.
---
It‚Äôs a great perk to run in general tbh. It‚Äôs saved my ass so many times against killers who weren‚Äôt spirit.
---
I think they're pretty cool myself. Got myself hipster Jake and the Nurse one so far.
---
Not all use Stridor, so it could help you out.
---
It‚Äôs a very good perk either way.
---
Actual trash idea
---
Boo fucking hoo, sue the OP and see if it does anything.
---
Ruin, huntress lullaby, noed, haunted ground. Iridescent heads if possible. Don't @ me
---
Honestly I love the idea of new challenges to do and when the reward is putrid serum which you can use to get cosmetics (in the free pass) as well as blood points from the challenges themselves I can honestly get behind this system.
---
Exactly. It helps you out not just against Spirits, but other killers too!
---
That would actually be great
---
Ew no not freddy. I'd rather have springtrap, that'll be pretty cool
---
They did mention switch, they said no ETA on the update currently.
---
The survivors could probably make do with what they have.
---
Getting punched by Ash's metal hand would probably hurt a lot more then a regular fist.
---
Jeff has his longcoat with sharp metal spikes all along the forearms.
---
Kate has her climbing jeans with dual pickaxes attached.
---
David has his akimbo guns he carries at all times.
---
If bonking the killer in the face with a pallet/closet door is enough to stun them, then these might be as well.
---
I started a game with 3/25 crows bothered. Went to Pale Rose and immediately thought: does this only count as one or as multiple? 
---
Sprinted to the boat and got facecamped to death by a Billy shortly after. 25/25 crows. Ezclap.
---
We have tapp?
---
Yea sometimes I hate being up in higher ranks but i don‚Äôt want to de rank cus I don‚Äôt like dominating either
---
That actually looks kinda threatening
---
For me, there was one in one of the cold wind farm variants.
---
And then complain that DS is still overpowered?
---
What would you rather have The Shining or IT?
---
jus fuck shit up until 2 are dead then pretend to farm until they open gates and kill one of them
---
It happens to all of us lol, thank you for being so nice aswell
---
Yea I don‚Äôt get why. Like let‚Äôs all just have a blast and rake in the bloodpoints
---
Tier 22 here!
---
Don‚Äôt forgot about Quentin mains, they‚Äôre also nonexistent.
---
I wanna stay at Green ranks where the games are pretty fair and I can actually play something that isn't freddy... I just wanna get to red ranks once to say I've been there but its impossible rn :(
---
Imagine if it was like plague throwing up on pallet, gens or even windows but kira just had to touch it. And instead of getting sick you get Kira saying that Killer Queen already touched the [insert touched things name]. Followed by a violent explosion
---
And haunted grounds not as good but still
---
&gt;This is not a classroom and I‚Äôm not a child either. Maybe your theory works better in an actual classroom? 
---
...Do I really have to explain that people use context-sensitive phrases out of context for humorous purposes?
---
Yep that's pretty much the reason, you nailed it
---
Both. Since these stories have no connection, they can do both.
---
This crazy bitch has to be a troll
---

---
Right?!
---
Well my luck is pretty bad because I always see spirits with stridor (ps4) but yeah I can try iron will for a while
---
I like the guy's voice and I keep it on, but I just read ahead and close it when I am done. I don't wait.
---
You guys are getting matches?
---
PC
---
In-Game
---
Permanent Blind
---
Picked up a Survivor as leatherface. Another survivor flashlight blinded. Begin to recover and get reblinded. Blind for 30 seconds while looking at ground and at sky. Proceeded to disconnect. 
---
Expected result: recover from blind
---
Actual result: permanent white and red dancing lights
---
Franks a human highlighter
---
Is tapp good? I don't have him. Is he the one that has the deliverance perk?
---
Wasn‚Äôt that because the movie creators were having slight digs at each other. More of a mockery than a feature
---
Yes, please punish the random guy that had no control over the situation, and doesn't choose to be saved. That's sure to teach the guy that got free points and even got to escape with no repercussions, and might even get hatch because you just put another survivor that much closer to death hook
---
Seriously, it sounds more like a shitty excuse for tunneling. You are proving a point to nobody, and making the game unfun for the person who got screwed over
---
To make matters worse, I actually played a game with him, and it filled only partially, like 10%. I dont know what it wants from me but I'm scared
---
No, I understand you. It just think it translates better in real life than on the Internet.
---
But how do we have such long queues then?
---
&gt;I like playing against her. But have no fear, the whining minority will always get their way in the end if only to get them to shut the fuck up. I'm sure a nerf is inbound.
---
I think you got this backwards. The majority of players have little to no fun against Spirits.
---
Is it ? Used the max rank version of This Is Not Happening for the Tome Challenge for the first time, found the effect hilariously unsignificant. Like, Great Skill Checks are now three pixels wider, thanks man, OP perk.
---
I was confused because i didn't get it until i saw that it was in the DeadByDaylight sub
---
Best I can do is 1. Take it or leave it Entity.
---
My problem with perks like Devour is that you have *no fucking idea* the killer has it until it's used. Insta-down powers you expect and can predict, but the perks are just a wildcard.
---
Ah yes, the "buenos dias fucckk boii" skin
---
Yeah, just nerf every killer to Legion's level and then survivor can win 97% of the time.
---
Her only problem is she being able to bump into survivors. Let we have a true top tier killer lol.
---
Shirtless trapper
---
As someone whose been running spirit a lot i agree especially with mother daughter ring oof
---
AMAZING!!!
---
Iron will is only useless against plague, other than that iron will is an amazing perk. It removes one sense from the killer(hearing). Plus hearing is one of the things that separates average killers from amazing killers.
---
I still wish I could‚Äôve dyed my hair pink :(
---
Ikr , took me years of training to master this move , but now i can finaly do it consistently
---
Okay I understand Spirit and Huntress, but Clown's instant down isn't super bullshit to play against. He has to hit you with a direct bottle, and then also hit you in a short amount of time with a successful M1 attack.
---
Thank you so much. :)
---
Ohtofu is a douche I'll pass. You just can't take advice huh? I'm done listening to you. Blocked.
---
Otz. Nicest streamer in the world. Also does yt. Killer main. Solo queue survivor. Likes to have fun but also provides probably the most info of any streamer out there tips wise besides maybe Pain Reliever.
---
same here in the southwest. Night is instant killer and any other hour its instant surv
---
I‚Äôm working on my standing still mind game. It‚Äôs fairly difficult to pull off for me still maybe one day I‚Äôll get there
---
I feel that. It‚Äôs fun to say you‚Äôve been there. It‚Äôs hell playing here consistently
---
Convenient placing, very efficient.
---
Dude I get it, but we literally get like 3 posts a day of someone complaining about Spirit. It‚Äôs getting kinda old. The devs already said they‚Äôre gonna tweak her a bit in the future. Not much you can do about it now
---
I actually just joined a lobby with one
---
Just to make sure, are you aware that you have 66 days to grind the Serum? 
---
Also, we will be getting more Tomes to make going through the Rift quicker.
---
Dude you‚Äôre a fucking maniac. You‚Äôre such an entitled kid that you wont take advice for shit. Instead you resort to being a coward and block me. Whats more you will pass on taking advice from an actual killer main who is 100x better than you at understanding how the killer works.
---
Please excuse yourself from this whole subreddit id you‚Äôre going to be this mindless and idiotic
---
There are going to be 3 additional levels of challenges. The next level is coming in a couple weeks or so.
---
Lmao
---
Oh, sure, let's go straight to an extreme statistical improbability to make our point.  
---
People are different. Some want games to be easy, others like a challenge. Neither side is better than the other, different tastes is all. My point is, the whining side always wins in the end, so relax, a nerf is surely coming.
---
I did not know this. I thought the event was a week long. Thanks man.
---
New daily idea: play a game longer than your wait time for 100k bloodpoints
---
Pantsless Myers was chickenlegs McGee so maybe it is for the best
---
Secret helper- on this, camaraderie exists which gives 34 seconds extra on hook when someone‚Äôs close. I feel like that‚Äôs he furthers we can go with additional time before it becomes broken. Unless it has no downside but it couldn‚Äôt be long and therefore not useful. Also slippery meat which gives 1 extra hook attempt to escape. Not as related time wise but another perk for on hook
---
Their gonna complain about her until shes nerfed to the ground :(
---
How's the gamd running on the switch? Thought about getting it for my ridd to work.
---
Had the same thing happen to me as trapper
---
I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôd rather play against literally anything else than spirit. Infinite mending legion and prayer bead spirit are the most angry times I‚Äôve ever had
---
DBD website
---
&gt;I did not know this. I thought the event was a week long. Thanks man.
---
Getting the Serum is not related to the Blight Event. They are completely separate from each other (except for the name).
---
Sure, she's a viable killer after all, of course the majority won't have fun, I don't doubt that. My point is, it's the whiny few that will secure that nerf, so keep at it.
---
You can say the same thing for survivors. Both sides get extremely sweaty during events.
---
It may just be a reference, it would be meaningless context if they were really in the same universe.
---
Best killer cosplay I‚Äôve ever seen. There are some very good other ones but this has high effort and looks insane. Never seen a doctor cosplay. Amazing job
---
I mean yeah but that‚Äôs the way it is about everything in the game. I think Spirit is mostly fine. Just remove prayer beads and add some more counterplay. They don‚Äôt need a whole rework imo. I think people exaggerate how strong she is
---
False equivalence tho. Pinky Finger Clown and Iri/Prayer are not on the same annoyance level at all.
---
I never DC on purpose (why would I lose two pips, my potential offering, and all my bloodpoints?), but good god I can't be mad to people who DC against these two, it's just bullshit add-ons.
---
Um just because you hate something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not good.... 
---
You are acting like perks don‚Äôt have tiers. Tiers as in good all around perks all the way down to bad ones..
---
&gt;Sure, she's a viable killer after all, of course the majority won't have fun, I don't doubt that. My point is, it's the whiny few that will secure that nerf, so keep at it.
---
Did you even watch the video? It seems like you didn't since you bothered to bring "viability" to the conversation which isn't the issue people have with Spirit.
---
Gen tap so she can‚Äôt grab you. Other than that, good luck.
---
That's to provide compensation for the killer disconnecting and removing the ability for you to escape in the first place. It doesn't actually count as an escape.
---
Do u know the survivor they say: SHIT TUNNLER CAMPER etc and u are just thinking I PLAY THE FUCC GAME thats me so if someone read this and u are a survivor main dont cry when a killer camp or tunnled or slugged all of u Sh!t swf and flashlight bc u DESERVED IT (BEST KILLER PERKS: Frankling BBQ noed and KO (when tey are swf this perks is shit) or nurse is calling with the 5 blink nurse ;) they gonna love you on the pc and dont forget the ebony morie)
---
I wasn't even aware that this has been around. I've been playing seriously for almost 6 months now, I think, and this is a first.
---
While I agree that iron will is a solid perk no matter which killer you're facing, you still shouldn't be forced to run a certain perk to "counter" a killer

Bonus: carrying a survivor stuffs the survivor in your suit until they are hooked/wiggle free

I tried playing something different as killer and was immediately gen rushed so bad I played like 3 games in a row without a single kill. I went back to the standard meta make the game last as long as possible. -_- It would be nice to run something else but you really can‚Äôt.

I agree with basically everything in the video. I feel like with Nurse or Billy I can kind of predict and mind game things in a chase but Spirit just sucks. I don‚Äôt enjoy playing games against her and while I don‚Äôt DC I just don‚Äôt bother to struggle anymore. I‚Äôd rather get the game over with. She‚Äôs terribly designed.

---
Underneath all the excuses, that's exactly the issue people have with any killer. They don't win often enough against said killer. We both know this. Let's not argue, there is no point, we both also know that a nerf will be coming once the whining gets loud enough, so I'll go ahead and leave you guys to it. Happy bitching everyone.
---
I like to play against her it‚Äôs hard but not unfair like other killers
---
Ah yes, the shards, that is a good point. 
---
I think some sort of shard discount or at least ‚Äúheads up‚Äù would certainly be nice when they are coming. I know BHVR has been trying to remain inclusive and fair to newer players and I think that would be a good compromise without giving an unfair ‚Äúhead start‚Äù to veteran players that have had the time and the shards and likely already have most of or all of the characters.
---
I would rather they do something so I don‚Äôt have to run ruin literally every game.
---
Billy has counterplay so I don‚Äôt mind facing him as much as it is annoying getting stuck in the middle of a corn field and then getting my back sawed off. Nurse has some prediction counterplay too and her recent nerf has made her perfectly fine for me atleast
---
It‚Äôs making me want to die
---
Can I just say your info is incorrect. Only licensed killers and survivors are paid. Whereas non licensed characters can be purchased through iridescent shards at a reasonable price. I‚Äôve bought all non licensed survivors and few of the killers through iri shards. More of an optional transaction then forced

---
I mean do you blame them? Killer que times are insane right now. Why would anyone wait 10-15 minutes to play a match as a low-tier/mid-tier killer only to have it be over in under 8 minutes because of how fast gens get done? 
---
If one aims to play for fun but the other side plays to win the side that wanted to play for fun ain't going to have fun. Until their is a widespread movement to not play meta don't expect players on any side to not tryhard in high ranks.
---
I‚Äôve seen this post about 34 times on this sub.
---
Ahhh. I stand corrected:
---
The reason why the actual bloodpoints are not matching up are the following:
---
On the match page it gives you your total bloodpoints + pustala bonus THEN it multiplies by 2 (bloodhunt).
---
Its supposed to be total bloodpoints multiply by 2 (bloodhunt) then add the pustala bonuses.
---
Took me awhile to figure this out, there is no pustula bug. The problem is the match page.

---
I don‚Äôt win against hillbilly‚Äôs very often and I think he is fine, he is really strong in The right hands but in no way do I think he needs a nerf
---
None of them are unbeatable though. Giving up in this game is usually a middle finger to the rest of your team and often worse for them than the killer.
---
Eta: if prayer beads spirit is not a potato, they probably win 9 times out of 10 bit I'm still gonna try.
---
Exact same for me! Someone please send help to the Midwest lol
---
No but seriously who do you think needs balancing
---
We'll Make It beats it easily. Autodidact only becomes powerful after the third skill check, but it requires too many variables. For example:
---
* Requires you to stop and heal someone for a lengthy amount of time (when you don't have tokens) which is a negative considering that a majority of killers try to tunnel injured survivors. If you unhook someone you would want to heal the injured survivor quickly before the killer comes back.
---
* Requires you to actually heal someone which can be hard in the low ranks because they tend to run across the map before letting you heal.
---
* If you try to heal after unhook, it is detrimental if someone helps you to heal because it speeds up the process and can lead to you not getting skill checks at all.
---
* When you are going for your first token it is highly likely (base on my experience) that the first skill check comes after healing 50% or around 90%
---
* If you are trying to heal someone within the terror radius it can be detrimental if you have no tokens at all because they drain so much of the progress and you don't want that when the killer is nearby and can hear you healing the other survivor.
---
* Some players don't have patience after seeing you have autodidact and they will likely cancel the healing interaction and just move on.
---
Personally, We'll Make It is overall better to use because once you unhook someone you can heal them fully in seconds and if you have it at tier 3 you can have it active for a good amount of time to heal others quickly. I myself have found this game saving because I had people drop like flies, but they were being slugged so what I did was unhook the one survivor, heal the other guy on the ground (2 health states within seconds) and then fully heal the guy I just unhooked within seconds.

You have a point, but the main woman in the comic has proportions that are nearly impossible to achieve without surgery. The other women actually look healthier to me -- they have a healthy amount of fat on them. I know this is a stylistic choice, but that's why I call the comic sexist. It just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, like it's trying to police how women treat themselves and scold women who don't run early in the morning for having the audacity to blame nature for the way they look.
---
Again, you're completely right, but that's not what the comic is trying to say. A comic encouraging body positivity or healthy behavior for the sake of your happiness would not use that art style.

Yeah I understand the need to go top tier because of meta perks used by survivors. But its such a shame that they never budge and try something different. Literally I have been sitting at ranks 1-2 for this entire season and prior to the event I just got Spirits, Nurses, Huntress, Freddy and Plague. Arguably top/ higher mid-tier killers and now during this new event I have only gotten Spirits and Huntress. I have played about maybe 50 games or more and its just getting sickening man. Almost 95% of the time, Ruin is active. It gets so stale and especially when these killers are getting new cosmetics and I hardly get to see them in action unless I use them, but even that is useless because killers is 1st person POV. For example, when Demogorgon came out I saw him maybe once every 5 games and now during this event he doesn't even exist alongside Doctor, Hag, Wraith, Trapper, Clown, Pig, EVEN BILLY is gone at red ranks. Since the start of this season I have faced maybe one Billy, but my memory is so faint that I could be imagining it. It sucks. I just want more variety in the game at red ranks, since I am stuck there every season.

Yes. Despite what some killer mains here say, camping during EGC is not okay.

You are the first person this has ever happened to. Lol no but for real I've had this happen except with rancor.

Yeah maybe there some problems because its a new character model since they gave her a bigger ass. Tbh, a sacrifice that I can live with.

just try and slug as much as possible with the last 2-3 survivors, i find that helps.

---
&gt; Can I just say your info is incorrect. Only licensed killers and survivors are paid. 
---
Thanks for showing you didn't read it, I guess? I specifically state that some Killers/Survivors can and cannot be earned.
---
&gt; Whereas non licensed characters can be purchased through iridescent shards at a reasonable price. 
---
Is it though? Is it *really*? Is 35 hours for a $5 character *really* fair? That's 15 cents an hour. Personally I wouldn't mind *too* much, but consider the other insane amounts of microtransactions especially when you compare it to a *free-to-play* game.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve bought all non licensed survivors and few of the killers through iri shards. More of an optional transaction then forced 
---
If it was optional they wouldn't make you pay to get it. Like I previously stated, having DLC Killers and Survivors is fine, but when you have DLC in a game you pay for, in a game with $10+ microtransaction skins, in a game with a battle pass, is it really fair? If the developer made buying DLC content truly optional, they would give us Killers and Survivors for free and sell more skins for them instead, but they're doing both. That's what TF2 did. Team Fortress 2 basically said "Okay, you can just straight up get these weapons, trade for them, buy them, earn them, whatever, but we're going to sell hats. We will never make you pay money to use a weapon, just hats. Buying stuff in this game is optional."
---
I played Beads Spirit with Ruin and Haunted today for some BP. Yeah i know that feeling. I really needed the bloodpoints. Poor rank 20s :/ ( i actually deranked that hard for not playing for months)

---
oh cool. did you crop it to fit as a wallpaper or is this the original size?
---

Least with nurse you can use jungle gyms and walls to force a blink and actually try to mind game.  
---
Billy isn't that strong if you gain a bit of distance in the same situation, its only when hes right up on you is it hard to avoid. 
---
Spirit just appears suddenly hits you, or can m1 into power to catch up. and in loops the occasional phasing makes me think they back tracking but in reality its just a random phase effect. The only indicator of her even phasing doesn't work inside terror radius, then you've an addon that removes the only indication and replaces it with faint foot step sounds. The idea of her being a spooky spirit appearing out of no where is cool and terrifying but gameplay needs to be tweaked with the lack of indication or knowledge just being a piss take
---
Your video pretty much sums it up and is an excellent discussion point
---
Every 2 weeks
---
this is so cute! awesome idea!
---
You could also try a blood warden noed buold also to help get them at the end.
---
Surveillance is so good on Freddy.
---
Oh shit my guy that‚Äôs actually a really cool idea, I think that could be tied into a gameplay element somehow
---
That's because his Mori is so badly animated it doesn't look like he's killing them
---
This isn‚Äôt my video I can‚Äôt take that credit but thank you very much for understanding my view points
---
Because she doesn't want a political post, mayhaps?
---
Honestly, this. Before I pick up a killer I learn the basics with no add ons and no perks so at the very least, I can kill without them. Best way to learn
---
I‚Äôm sorry I think it should be either pennywise or the xenomorph but this is an amazing concept
---
Well, "Nobody Escapes Us" would increase with each hit, although that needs a cap, like max 20%, and it should be a smaller amount like 2%, but that essentially makes it a required perk with him.
---
There are many killers who can one hit down you. And some have abilities to one shot you. It's time to take them out of the game, yeah?

If I could get Licensed Killers with shards, it'd be Michael or Ghostface for sure. Probably Michael, because I find GF a little unfair. Knowing who revealed you is pretty crutch, and stalk progress never decreases under any circumstances.

But I can't get him anyway, even though I'm all Ears is pretty spicy.
---
Wow that‚Äòs a salty killer main if I ever saw one
---
Aw, thanks
---
ontop of that, I believe the game states they must be done "safetly" as well.
---
Iri head gives up four shots to make one twice as effective, though. Beads removes a mechanic explicitly present to balance Spirit, with no weakness.

Just had a game where 3 survivors were alive all on their last hook, 1 gen left, 2 managed to escape through hatch. Like I have been saying it's not rare.
---
I did.  It's not reliable in the least.  It means you have to be staring pretty damn hard at her and that's even if you can see them, which in the Schoolgirl outfit good luck.

#DBDisqueer
---
For real. Earlier today i was testing out some stuff on spirit and i got everyone hooked at least once and 2 people on death hook with still 5 gens up so you know what i did? Chilled out and went for the people i only hooked once and let them get all but 1 gen done. If you are steamrolling a team just chill out this isnt a zero sum game, everyone can get a bunch of points and you can still win.
---
or you know, you can understand what banter is and not be so sensitive like a child. lol
---
Adrenaline is stupid and unfun
---
Sprint Burst is stupid and unfun
---
Balanced Landing is stupid and unfun
---
But hey, fuck noed right? i mean, it makes survivor so unfun and every killer runs it every game /s
---
Since we're making assumptions - once you actually get good at the game instead of whining on reddit, you will see why she was nothing to whine about in the first place. Best of luck to you.
---
Even just going into the second phase on my first hook without being rescued while the killer is miles away annoys me. Especially when my teammates aren‚Äôt even doing gens
---
Nice LULW
---
4% of the population of the game is swf, even less is 4 mans . nice logic though.
---
That would be kind of boring tbh
---
Using the perk sole survivor
---
Np
---
The Otzdarva trapper special. "I'm fine with that." He says as two gens get done without him seeing a single person. Two more get done, only one hook. "This is a nasty spot for a trap." Queue the whole team simultaneously stepping in traps within walking distance of him.

All 4 survivors escaped

---
Yeah, I don't know if Samara/Sadako would work, she's more like a curse than a killer she doesn't really have a physical means of killing and for that matter the same goes for Kayako/Grudge, her choice of mobility would conflict with the game mechanics and she can never leave the house unless someone enters it and in which case she can only haunt them, it's not as if she's free to go wherever. Obviously you can make the argument that the entity could alter or break these curses but lore is the most important aspect for licensed killers and it really seems like more work than necessary just to have them in game.
---
I don't understand this achievement. Is it talking about the tombstone mori or does it mean down them with Tier 3 and then sacrifice the survivor?
---
I think it‚Äôs different for Adrenaline because whilst it is the same trigger, since it‚Äôs a survivor objective it rewards the survivor massively for not dying until the end, which is their objective, it‚Äôs a win more/victory lap perk. NOED is a fucking ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù perk that rewards the killer for doing poorly and also kinda makes it so the killer gets one kill max before all the survivors leave (cuz nobody in their right mind is gonna go try and go for a save when they have NOED)
---
I dont get salty, when I see two moris happen in match it makes it more excitingüòà
---
I've played one match as killer and first survivor I grabbed off a gen disconnected and I carried NOTHING to a hook in confusion and ended up totally heartbroken once I realized what happened
---
Get them heals boi.
---
Hey I just had a match where I farmed with survivors as Freddy so basically infinite snare bps. It's not all bad
---
U r dum
---
Anyone can and anyone should do it! Every dollar counts! You can sign up to be on reddit's team and even choose the day you play!
---
Holy shit good job gamer
---
hatch spawns when theres 1 gen w 3 people, but just how often does this happen? its not rare? is escaping like this a daily occurance? no. its not. its a once in a blue moon thing. if everyone was on there last hook you pipped, there was no loss for you anyways
---
It means to unhook a survivor when the killer is still right next to the hook, resulting in the unhooked survivor getting downed and hooked again.
---
Tombstone Mori
---
I go back for randoms. More points as well
---
Thank you Zagrid! And thanks for coming to chat in the discord!
---
Killer main here. No.
---
Im gonna be honest I dont get all the spirit hate all of a sudden she was fine for like a whole year and NOW everyone wants to complain about her
---
Essentially, you need to mori all 4 survivors while having tier 3. It doesn‚Äôt matter what add ons or mori offerings you use, you just have to kill all the survivors. (If a survivor disconnects, give up, you can‚Äôt do the achievement anymore. The last survivor did this in the game before I completed the achievement.)
---
Mr Hedgehog, can you point to the spot on the doll where they raped you?
---
I guess you need to communicate with randos that you're doing a challenge to have a chance
---
When you unhook your team mate with the killer absurdly nearby usually right after getting hooked. It's called funneling if you save when the killer isnt preoccupied and then hide and leave your unhooked team mate as the only target.

It's honestly not that rare. Its not about a pip. It's about I had them in a 3 gen and all on their last hook and lost because of an item. Survivor mains want to cry about moris and spirit fine nerf em. Also nerf or remove keys and block some windows to shut down overly time consuming loops.

Sorry, didn‚Äôt see that from literally months ago...

She just replied "Do you guys not know what it's like to go up against red ranks without ruin? It's almost impossible. Next you'll say you don't want me to use add ons."

It shows that the survivor respects the killer instead of survivors t-bagging and being disrespectful that is why when you drop an item in front of a killer it shows that you have respect towards him.
---
ok spirit main
---
Ok I can get behind that
---
I always write gg in the chat after the game because I genuinely appreciate a fair and fun game, even if I didn‚Äòt survive the round!
---
However, even with a toxic ass killer I still don‚Äòt BM (I‚Äòm above that), I simply unhook with BT and bodyblock, denying the killer a sacrifice lol. Nothing better than seeing them instaleave after a round ends with zero kills for them &lt;3

Does the Jane one glow in the dark?
---
But Clown sucks
---
2020 Reboot looks decent too, potential marketing for both Behavior and Ghost House Pictures, though I'm conflicted on how she'd work in game.
---
A Fnaf chapter wouldn't be really cool it could be like legion where the cosmetics are the other animatronics but I can see why you wouldn't want it the community around that game is god awful and most of them are children
---
it‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúyou can have this..‚Äù basically being friendly with the killer. just like you might t-bag with your teammates.
---
How about fuck no
---
A gift for a friendly killer. It‚Äôs a peace offering.
---
Sprint burst gang
---
It does say kill by any means Sacrifices work
---
Dbd needs a forefit option for those situations.
---
I don't really have the patience to stay on the floor for 2 minutes as the guy looks for his 4k all over the map. I'd rather just leave.
---
Same with killer, if it comes to that I'll just kill the guy and look for the hatch, I don't really care that much about killing everyone, I just want to play the game and have fun. This game isn't very competetive in the first place.
---
It‚Äôs glitches like this that makes me wonder how the heck did that even happen.
---
NOOO I LOOKED FORWARD TO IT
---
Are you sure? AFAIK it explicitly says "By any means". I got it from a normal 4K with an endgame build. 
---
Do you mean the Blood On Your Face trophy/achievement? That one does indeed require 4-man mori. The rift one doesn't tho.
---
i play both sides, killer a lot more than survivor, and honestly its just entitled to want to shut down windows so its an easier win for yourself
---
I'm almost at level 50 on my Meg without finding balanced landing. It's the only perk I want and it just refuses to give it to me. I'm rather salty about it.
---
Yeah, that's why she posted this picture with the flag front and center right?
---
Pop and etc. are last week's shrine.
---
It's secretly a Shroud of Septation to make at least one of you DC in fear and keep the others apart
---
So you get two, somehow, and as you down the 3rd they instantly DC, causing the hatch to open that their friend was beside and they escape... No this totally didn't happen today not at all
---
Then, as I said earlier, it's a crutch. Do you agree?
---
I just DC and move to the next game
---
We got Christmas sweaters for survivors....now time for Christmas hats!!
---
Oh stfu, not everything is about you. They apologize and everything. Nothing is original anyways. And also... 500 isn‚Äôt a lot , lol. Pretty sure her other post got way more then you ever will

---
I like the rift challenges for tome one. Some were a bit tough but in total had it done in two days. My main issue is tome four. You guys seen those challenges? They really seem hard to do without farming or certain builds.
---
Usually takes about 10 plus minutes per queue when I play with my friend. It‚Äôs extremely annoying when the killer dodges these long queues.
---
Start gen tapping. The fact that Ruin can be completely bypassed like that is hilarious. I did 3 full gens last game without doing a single Ruin skill check while my dummy teammates looked around for the totem yesterday just by gen tapping. It's hilarious.
---
It works with sacrifices? I‚Äôve been dreading that challenge since I don‚Äôt use moris.
---
That‚Äôs is the first thing they have to do
---
The only time ideally you should make an unsafe unhook is when you have Borrowed Time. Still kind of dicey if the killer is too close and decides to tunnel the person you rescued instead of going after you.
---
I kinda hope they add this when his face gets fixed
---
Nope. It's well known that there are loops that need windows closed on. It's not about winning. It's about a brain dead loop that takes no skill to waste minutes of a killers time. Monto, truetalent, puppers and noob3 have all remarked that these loops are stupid and need fixed.
---
Have you seen some of the tome four ones? My game glitched on console and let me look at it. They seem like their gonna kinda ruin the game a bit and are just kind of annoying. I like playing Trapper and Claud for it but some of those last ones are annoying as crap sounding.
---
When a survivor takes their rbt off
---
These are really cool and would love pyramid head but am I the only one that wants a new original killer?
---
Yeah, me too, and those people are the ones usually against a totem counter or something on the interface to let solo queuing people have a chance to avoid giving the other side a free kill
---
Fucking hell these watermarks lately
---
Killer legit thinkin "this shits gonna test me i just know it".
---
At least u didn‚Äôt be a try hard and slug the last person for 4K
---
I cant think of the last time I was in Queue and wasnt on reddit or doing my Duolingo (can't let my familia get hooked).
---
Either that, or I'm trying to do a Spirit daily, and I will whack every generator, tree, and barrel you're standing near. Or, hell, even some you're not near.
---
yeah only last year+ killers truly respect the pickup animation, they saw what it once was.
---
You still would be better off throwing standard, this way you can compensate for a miss
---
You can select the final node if you arrive there by any path.
---
The grass moving idea is really good in theory, however if behaviour were to nerf spirit they‚Äôd go all out. Plus you have to be really careful with spirit so you don‚Äôt accidentally turn her into a bing bong boy 2.0, like if we start to make her more visible in her power what distinguishes her from wraith apart from being better in like every way (justice for bing bong)
---
I just put on an Ebony, one of the survivors DCd, and I checked the challenge and it was completed.
---
I wish more people could be honest about Spirit. Shes stupid easy to use to the point where I don't even like playing AS her. A lot of what she does is pretty cheesy like standing still at a pallet and calling it a "mind game" or when she happens to unphase right on top of you because of collision.
---
I don't want her nerfed to the point of being in the same spot as killers like LF or Doctor who really need to get some dev love, but it would be nice to make some changes to her that make it less brain dead easy to do so well with her.
---
Thank the heavens
---
Same I got bored of doing survivor
---
She does disturb grass right now, if I'm not mistaken. But shes too fast to ever do anything about that.
---
For me I feel like for throwing pallets if like the pallet is mostly down or like 70% animation is complete you should be safe but yes you can swing through a pallet. They even fixed pallet vacuuming so it would give killer abit of extra time to smack through the pallet if the killer swinging at you.  I feel like once you take a step away from window  it should render you safe from lunges.  As for vaulting pallets once the animation is like 70% complete, so essentially other side of pallet you should be safe from lunges. 
---
I do feel like the servers are slightly behind what players see , as I've had moments where both the killer and survivor are surprised something hits.
---
I am happy to report that I had two back to back farming matches and nice killers
---
So, it really depends on the way you're playing. If you're playing on windowed mode, fullscreen, etc. I can take some if you want
---
Did you respec your options after changing graphics cards? I know that that sounds silly, but it was an issue I've had on pc before. My game was chugging on a superior card, and only after going in to the options and fiddling with the display (Even improving it to match my card at the time) Made it better  
---
Also, some games don't like working with certain cards or even superior stuff. Case in point, FF7 doesn't want to run on my high end gaming pc.
---
I can understand that, but I need survivors to fill out all the killers I have
---
I've been trying to get this through peoples heads from the day the Battlepass was announced but the answer is always "BHVR needs money, would you work for free?" as if not having even one of these micro-transactions would equate to that.  
---
Honestly I think DBD should go free to play and just give people who bought the game something akin to Legacy. A badge of support I guess you could say. With a battlepass, paid dlc chapters, and cosmetics out the wazoo, a massive grind for \*any\* free content (including fucking perks which means pay to win features) the intro price to the game just scares away new players.  
---
How can I convince someone to give DBD a shot if when they ask me how much it costs I have to honestly say "110 bucks if you want to be able to play the game from the start. Oh! And the game is grindy as hell and, based on leaks, the battlepass is designed to be impossible unless you play the game like an addiction! Fun right!"  
---
I love DBD, but this is too much and always will be. If I were new to this game right now I'd drop it for a refund in a heartbeat. I'm only still here because it's too late to leave with how much I dropped before  this got out of hand.

Agreed  my friend. I was going to try again, like you did, but i was so angry i figured id try again the next day. Im glad i saw this post. Now i know it isnt just me and the rituals fucked or i wouldve wasted more time. Your sacrifice was not in vain my lord!
---
I strongly agree.
---
No you don‚Äôt, good ideas look worse if they‚Äôre over saturated with filler. I‚Äôd rather you compile the best ideas and condensed it down to maybe 10 killers and 10 survivors
---
I could probably ctrl+F posts from last week and find a ton of posts and comments saying the first line.
---
I don't think its smart to speak for a community that is incredibly divisive.
---
I feel like the whole point of making a build is to ‚Äòcounter‚Äô certain things e.g. borrowed time for camping, decisive strike for tunneling, ruin and pop for gen rushing. By all means run the perks you want and have fun with the game, but when you get to high ranks and start seeing more and more strong killers picked (more spirits than trappers) you can hardly complain because you don‚Äôt want to change your perk load out.
---
Yeah I would love to see some screenshots

I guess that makes sense. I already have like 25 killers. I'm probably going to keep adding, but time will tell

Hahahahaha so funny, soooo original
---
Adrenaline is unfun too. And you can't do anything to prevent it from activating if they're alive when it activates.
---
Yeah especially because survivors just aren‚Äôt rewarding to level up past getting teachables
---
I know and I honestly wouldn't mind if it wasn't for, as you said, being able to climb so high without meaning to. When I first hit red ranks it was on purpose, I was pushing to do so on both sides and had earned that placement. I could compete. Then I took a massive break from the game and now play very casually. Despite having completely lost the edge that I had at higher ranks I still end up there facing off against people who are several times better than me just because I have a habit of playing a lot all at once when I \*do\* get around to playing.

Sure, I'll do some stuff I need to do, and soon I'll update some pictures of the game, okay?

nope.avi feelings

 Archive Challenge Bug
---
 The 2nd killer challenge in the Tomb is not registering my progress.  Which is "damage 6 generators". It has tracked 4/6 and does not move from there. I've played for hours as the killer and definitely have damaged way more than 6 generators. I'm unable to move on from here since this function is broken.
---
I think the idea is great but I really dislike the color scheme TBH. Yellow doesn't really fit it much.
---
hey that's bad actually  
---
if someone didn't want their pic stolen and shared around then that's on them, so let them be. Or what? Do you want Natalia to revoke her likeness to BHVR and we get Quentin 2?

No

---
That actually makes a lot of sense, I never really thought about that. The only other "rewards" are the bloody cosmetics for prestiging

I'll pray for your economy market.

I actually uploaded an old setting, so I changed somethings to fit better. I'm gonna upload it again soon

Because when it comes to universes and references, Stephen King loves to mix, but without crossing certain boundaries. Some are more scientific like IT and others more supernatural like The Shining.
---
survivor ranks 7-13 usually takes anywhere from 5-10 mins for me [PS4]
---
This is so awesome, good luck!
---
To clarify, it's always the killer that leave. Other survivors are trying just as hard as us to get a lobby, but the killer always backs out and sticks us back in our 10 minute que

---
It‚Äôs valuable when playing solo to keep track of pallets that have been used so you don‚Äôt run to a dead zone. I rate it but there are so many better options ahead of it to choose from. That‚Äôs probably why it gets canned by most players.
---
These would be fine if they were on the free track but you have to pay and then work for these like cmon

---
no no, not your suggestion. I mean the guy who commented on yours. I like your suggestion although there are loopholes, like turning away but still standing there. No, I was talking about NinjasInMyBasement's comment. Because it SOUNDS sacastic, like "if we pause hook progression why not give them superpowers and kill the killer?" but because he wrote after an ENTIRE minute of being around a hook without chase, then he might think this is a solid suggestion. Unhooking yourself with borrowed time should be enough, but reverting hook stages AND stunning the killer? Thats what makes it sound sarcastic.

You so serious good lord downvote me the say that shit take a damn chill pill gettin butthurt over a game

---
Thank you. Thank you so fucking much. It warms my heart to fuck to see someone else who doesn't just parrot that shit. The entire justification of DLC back in the beginning was to help them pay to make the game ***WHICH WAS ALRIGHT*** until they introduced microtransactions to "help pay for the game." Like, I thought that was the point of DLC? Was it not? Were people just joking?
---
&gt; Honestly I think DBD should go free to play and just give people who bought the game something akin to Legacy. A badge of support I guess you could say. With a battlepass, paid dlc chapters, and cosmetics out the wazoo, a massive grind for \*any\* free content (including fucking perks which means pay to win features) the intro price to the game just scares away new players. 
---
If the game goes free-to-play, anyone who already owned the game should get the $20 Auric Cell pack + 500 for owning the game before it went F2P. If Behaviour makes Dead by Daylight free-to-play, I will not complain nearly as much about DLC and microtransactions. If they make the game free-to-play and stop making DLC (including licensed content) free, I will never ever complain about a battle pass or skins again.
---
&gt; How can I convince someone to give DBD a shot if when they ask me how much it costs I have to honestly say "110 bucks if you want to be able to play the game from the start. Oh! And the game is grindy as hell and, based on leaks, the battlepass is designed to be impossible unless you play the game like an addiction! Fun right!" 
---
That's how microtransactions work. Prick the players with a small needle over and over again so they don't realize just how much they're paying. Go through your DLC you own, add up the price, then all your skins, then the game, and see how much you've paid. If I didn't get my DLCs on sale, I would have been paying $57, and I only own 7 DLCs!
---
&gt; I love DBD, but this is too much and always will be. If I were new to this game right now I'd drop it for a refund in a heartbeat. I'm only still here because it's too late to leave with how much I dropped before this got out of hand. 
---
That's *why* I made this. I see what's happening to Dead by Daylight and I think to myself "Holy ***fuck***! This game I love is going to shit! How do I convince others to see it how it really is?"
---
I mean if you really wanted people to ignore the flag you would have just faced a different direction and not had it front and center.
---
And drawing more attention to it by having it take up half the post description
---
Other than that though the mask and knife look great. Good job^^
---
Unironically Autodidact. Most killers proxy the hook so running We‚Äôll Make It over Borrowed Time is not advised.
---
Autodidacts tradeoff is that its extremely RNG based
---
For the record, I got to it by doing the following and I repeated it a few more times for good measure  
---
1. Watch the cinematic for "The Hunger"  
---
2. Click on "The Rift Tab" after the video is done playing  
---
3. Click back to the "Current Tome" Tab  
---
I can assure you I am not trying to bait anyone, as far as I am aware, we cant actually see the other levels yet because when I click on them normally, nothing happens.
---
Yeah, it'll be in the shop forever.
---
You play on PC or PS4?
---
My stepdad took the pic and I'm too lazy to take another one
---
I just used stakeout with it and got it done within the first minute of the match lol
---
Eyyyy, same man. I put on no mither large skill check build and basically had to play a gane of at what point will this Wraith give up on chasing me. It was fun...
---
What good will that do now when shes been out for a year? Rarity changes mean absolutely nothing.
---
Thank you!! I was really really worried and sad I was going to miss it
---
Thats fair. But the bps arent just currency, they are score. If the killer didnt even pip and barely earned any points then, despite the 4k, did he even win?
---
Well there is a special infected in left for dead called a boomer that vomits on survivors

Honestly just help new player drop more pallet cuz they now know where they are.
---
actually true, didn't think people saw it like this too LULW
---
Although it doesn't help if you're tunneled, I do want to note that the faux great skill checks from [Stake Out](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Stake_Out) do actually count. So if you're a potato like me and can't get them without assistance, this helps. I wouldn't've been surprised if they didn't count, but they do.
---
You certainly don't need the [This Is Not Happening](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/This_Is_Not_Happening) and [No Mither](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/No_Mither) combo that I tried running. Several times. Completely unsuccessfully.
---
&gt;it rewards killers that play bad.
---
I don't get why this is commonly accepted logic. The dev's themselves have said they try to balance for 2k being the most common result.
---
Even the best killer streamers don't 4k consistently, let alone your average "decent" red ranked killer. NOED is useful really often even for very good killers *especially* in the current super altruistic meta.
---
I don't even run it, personally, but I can completely understand why people do. There are plenty of times I could have turned a 1-2k into a 3-4k if I had been running noed.

Are you ok dude? lol

Seems like this guy copied your content using a time machine
---
&gt; Again, you're completely right, but that's not what the comic is trying to say. A comic encouraging body positivity or healthy behavior for the sake of your happiness would not use that art style.
---
The comic is critiquing the women for complaining when they make no effort to try and achieve what they are jealous of. It isn't sexist in it's portrayal, it's simply saying that you aren't helping yourself by complaining when you also do nothing to achieve what the other woman is achieving.
---
It isn't sexist, it just features women to prove a point. The woman on the right isn't absurdly out of proportion for what someone of her body type might be able to achieve, she isn't a complete plastic bimbo. She has her figure and her type and works to maintain it, where as the other women have a figure and a type but leave it as it is.
---
The comic isn't trying to preach body positivity or healthy behaviors. It is quite crudely saying that you aren't making yourself any prettier by complaining, in fact, you are just making yourself ugly in comparison to others. This isn't a reference to the look of the women, moreso just the idea behind the comic.

Go back to the basics: Bring out The Devil incarnate!

Special ability: Whisper sweet nothings into the ear of the survivor, eventually causing him to turn on his team.

oh, that sucks. thanks for confirming it for me though

A hand-painted hoodie, carefully crafted mask, and a purposefully distressed skirt to help you both blend in *and* stick out.
---
I used it a lot when I was new to the game, and I really felt it helped me plan an escape route when I was working on a gen. It shows how the tiles next to you are set up, so you can pick the best path around or through. As you get more experienced, you can do that kind of thing on the fly, or you simply remember it as you run past, but when you barely know the map layouts, it's a massive help.
---
Oh üòÇüòÇ
---
‚ÄúWait, that mother fucker picked a killer and started coming after us? Fuck this game‚Äù
---
That just sounds like the whispers perk for survivors lol
---
I think Insta Heals being nerfed will help, but the speed at which Gens can be completed needs to be slightly increased imo. At Rank 1, I can easily do 3 Gens with Ruin active whilst 3 other survivors do their own thing.
---
overkill.
---
We also got pantsless Michael
---
Do you wanna talk about it?
---
That's weird. Everyone has DS, anyway; only new players would still just have her on Laurie.
---
Yeah no shit. Guess where we're at right now? Reddit! WHOA!

I agree. She feels annoying to play now. Almost as if you‚Äôre punished for blinking.

Im using the double bloodpoints to get Spirit leveled up. Its a shame because I spend so much time getting every single perk on Nurse.

I am currently trying to get every character of mine to P3 with All Perks to T3

And lemme tell you not even a monthly DBP event would be helpful to get it done fast.

I'd think it would be an amazing chapter honestly
---
I don‚Äôt really understand how bt is still farming though? Like I get it if you rescue them RIGHT under the killer‚Äôs nose and the killer gets the bt hit right away but isn‚Äôt the whole point of bt to save them from a camping or nearby killer? Otherwise what is the point of bt?
---
It took my brother literally 1 HOUR queuing as Killer and he still didn't found a single match, while when I queue as Killer, it takes less than 10 minutes.
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, anything they implement would surely contradict her lore and demeanor. That being said adding her would create too many problems and I doubt the license holder would allow for anything less than authenticity.

overreaction.

I play David and usually don't run an item. If I ever do it's usually a toolbox since I run Inner-Strength instead of a medkit

anyone else here only have to wait like 1-2 minutes for a game?

*sees the Rift mission that needs 4 kill in 1 game, twice*
---
Ok so all killers are try-hard then
---
Ehh I dont think it would be good, dont get me wrong I love the weeping Angel's but the only terrifying aspect of them is how they work, you cant have a killer that doesn't move when the survivors see them, and if they change that then what's the point of having it in the first place?
---
The thing is, if you‚Äôre unsure whether you can get to the last level of the rift or you don‚Äôt care about cosmetics then don‚Äôt waste the $10. If you‚Äôll play enough to get to the end then you‚Äôll have allowed yourself a shit ton of practically free cosmetics because the 1000 auric points will be given back for other cosmetics. But don‚Äôt buy it until you reach the end of the rift progress.
---
What's wrong with those?

Ok, I'm shook, I watched this video before and I swear it said it was the other way around, my memory isnt what it used to be

Then start levelling Claudette. She has two of the Page 1 requirements exclusively.
---
Lawsuits end, it's a possibility once it's done.
---
I'm a rank 7 killer rn, and get matched with a lot of red ranks that actually don't run DS. A lot of balanced landings, adrenaline, borrowed time, but no DS. Unless its a laurie running object of obsession and trolling. That tends to be my experience with lauries in the higher ranks
---
Fast with no pauses between words and punctuation?
---
I main Legion now. It is a unique playstyle for sure and not for everyone, but his ability to guarantee hits is underrated. But you HAVE to be an expert M1 killer and like to M1 kill. In terms of that, he's small, silent, and fast. He has a lot of build options, too.
---
Is there a twitch link?
---
Trust me out of the list of perks I told you, Thanatophobia is the most critical and useful when playing as the plague. The second would be the obvious one Hex:Ruin. Then its a tie between Pop Goes The Weasel and Dying Light
---
Nope I remembered him, I purposely put him out for a good reason, which is the devs have already said they arent going to add him and the director is a pedophile.
---
There‚Äôs a high chance that we wont get shirtless Myers. 
---
Someone already asked and the devs said something like ‚Äúif it doesnt fit the theme of the character then we wont add it. We want to keep DBD, a natural horror experience.‚Äù
---
TBH a lot of survivors see me just standing at a pallet and start to slow vault. Gives me an easy grab, and a free hook. I'm rank 7 rn and keep getting matched with red ranks making this mistake. It's not that they don't know that I can't phase, its them getting caught up in their own heads and mind gaming themselves tbh
---
We are getting a clown skin thats him inside a fucking purple elephant suit, I think stoned Ghostface wouldn't break the theme of DBD
---
I mean it's pretty good ngl, but i'm a killer main and I think it'll be fine. Most items I see aren't common and a lot of people don't use items but maybe them being free is enough incentive. But if this ever came true, I guess testing that is what the PTB is for.
---
Edit: thanks for showing an opposing side of the argument without being a little sweaty sewer goblin about it.
---
Yeah...your math is way off there dude
---
They're fucking villains, I'm always shocked when people use that argument. Theres a big difference to having a villain like The Joker from batman (who you can argue is a terrorist), compared to paying for a character or something from a shooter or a murderer or something.
---
People also like to argue that he regrets it and it was years ago. He's making jokes about pedophillia in his latest jeepers creepers movie which was cut out. He regrets being caught, if he had the decision to do it again without being caught I bet he'd do it in a heartbeat.
---
Uh, really?
---
In that case I have no idea, might be 4 kills for real then
---
Same thing when you're using Prove Thyself.
---
Thought this was a shitpost for a second lmao
---
At least credit the person who made this post
---
Waste their time? gens time is already a joke, try defending without Ruin or PGTW. Forcing players to find NOED is not unfair in anyway possible.
---
Is it just my game glitching or can anyone else see the level 4 challenges when they load up the archive?
---
r/PromotionByProxy
---
I agree, unfortunately due to him being blind he probably won't be added unless they want to give him vision in the entity's realm and his power could be a really good set of hearing and senses.
---
KillerQueue.jpeg
---
i think op just needed to find a third thing to make the pic work, but there's just nothing as broken or unfun as iri heads or prayer beads
---
The entity eats hope, so having people repair gens builds hope, having them hooked and giving them a chance to be rescued gives them hope only for it to be crushed when they die. When they come back to the fire their hope is a little less each time
---
Why have infinite tier 3 when you can just play Plague at high ranks
---
love that 20 minute wait followed by a cancelled match followed by another half hour
---
To clarify my initial comment, you calculated as if each match would take 5 hours, not 5 minutes, which is obviously a bit of an issue
---
iri heads do not require skill lol and you're only down 2 hatchets with infantry belt - but you don't even need to hit people twice so that's a pointless negative
---
I really wanna see Remember Me's nerf get reverted. BHVR didn't know if EGC would be super strong and I respect that, but EGC isn't that big of a deal and I don't think Remember Me is gonna change the meta. I dunno, I guess I just miss endgame Freddy and Pig builds.
---
[Observe](https://youtu.be/6t2EMBEWx-U)
---
Sorry, but it ain't gonna happen unless Victor Salva loses the rights to the character.
---
*bathroom dance music*
---
Thank fuck I‚Äôve had Modern Warfare to play so I don‚Äôt have to play the sweat fest bloodhunt.
---
What do you mean?
---
Whelp that's where I fucked up. I thought it was fucking outrageous and was wondering how this wasn't talked about yet. Gonna delete it here. Thanks!!
---
They do if killer had noed
---
This same guy messaged me gg the other day after a nurse match him and I lost. Wish more were like him in this community
---
It kind of discourages you from trying out your less played role, my killer ques always take 3+ minutes so I rarely play killer
---
I know but I still want this to happen
---
The creator is a pedophile. BHVR has said they aren‚Äôt adding him.
---
Have u just started playing again? Bc seconds used to mean minutes for rituals
---
Not a problem. By the way, using your figures, it‚Äôs actually only about 95 hours of play time to get to the max tier, in case you were curious
---
Hope is fine. It fills its role as a NOED counter. It makes running loops insanely easy.
---
Anyone know when the next round comes out? I need my fix
---
Ah yeah, I had it when it had a free weekend back when bill came out, and hadn't played since.
---
I actually just had a trapper game where adrenaline and noed activated right as I hit a meg. Adrenaline healed her, but with noed it didn't really matter. She had words for me at the end of that match
---
Thanks for the copypasta
---
I'm genuinely extremely confused. I've been here for months and I have not seen a single RuPaul meme.
---
So anyone can exit the game wasting your ultra rare addon/offering with no consequence? (wasting as in 4 man/killer DC or even just 1 or 2 losing you lots of BP)
---
Thats makes no sense mathematically or logically.
---
You lose all your bloodpoints and the killer gets a bonus from your DC. A SWF gains more points altogether if everyone stays alive. Hence the meaning, ‚Äúsurvive with friends.‚Äù
---
If you‚Äôre so bent on moving to the next match then stay in the same position, the killer will find you a lot faster than if you run away. 
---
And the bleedout timer is like 2 minutes. Its not that long. you do you. In the end, dedicated servers is just gonna fuck you over.
---
Repost
---
Use a vpn for your wifi/hardline.
---
You were brave to not dodge that shit. It's either lobby dodge or mori in this situation
---
I don't know. I play killer and survivor, and I think it just depends. If they don't have any kills, losing one person is fine.
---
For this one i just went billy and ran around the map. Survivors and i had a good time
---
noed is decent if mixed with bloodwarden. I've had a few late game builds with noed, blood warden, bitter murmur, and ruin. Used ruin to give me time to get everyone hooked a couple times before gens could be finished, then had a blast with an ebony mori. Only ran it for the killer challenge in archives to kill all by any means, but the team I played against were all actually really nice after the game ended
---
I'm not sure if this is intended but I heard Tier 1 myer is immune to Spine chill or dectection perks.
---
I found a Myer today and my Spine Chill was still active when he looked at me. Yes Ik he's Tier 1 since no red stain.
---
Platform: PC
---
Pantless my...BAM!
---
Considering the playful personality of Danny, I'd say it fits perfectly.
---
Remember when it only affected 3 gens max for 16 seconds. Surveillance is so good now!
---
*looks up at screen in que*
---
Fuck, he's right
---
seriously just search rupaul in this sub
---
Answer it
---
there is  a website where you can practice skill checks, however that, like this, fails in a big way, because doing a skill check while you are not playing, with nothing going on its easy to hit the greats, but during a game its a lot different, there are more noises and distractions, makes it a lot harder
---
Nurse ? What is it?
---
So just doing the math straight up put it at 959 games baseline no archive help i dont know where 1400 is coming from
---
800x10 for 1 level is 8000x70 for 560,000/584=958.9 to round up to 959 games
---
If my math is right then its 83 shards in tier 1 which if its the same amount each tier is 332 which reduces this to 37 tiers needed to max it, barring complete archives
---
8000x37=296000 /582 = 508.59 rounded to 509
---
So 509 total games to play to max out, post archive completion, which can be played during maxing the archive.
---
Give a good time of 15 minutes per game is 509/15 = 33 hours of playtime, easily doable with a half hour per day of the 70 day span of the rift, as long as the archive 2-4 have the same if not more amount of points per level.
---
Holy shit this game is for switch? That‚Äôs cool!
---
It doesn't reward bad players it just doesn't punish them. Ruin doesn't punish bad players, you gonna say that Ruin rewards bad plays? It's not the killer's fault that the survivors get the gens done, that's their objective. It's also not the survivors fault if they lose, sometimes they tried their hardest but it wasn't enough.  Killers kill, survivors survive, one will always be done before the other. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, doesn't matter if you're good or bad because it happens to the best of us.
---
Yeah I redid the math haha. Guess I slipped in the extra digit somewhere. Thanks! I still think 95 hours is a bit steep, I think there should be a bonus for pass holders. Maybe make it more around 50 hours. But I mean, over 69 days that's just a bit over an hour a day I guess.
---
Your misuse of "then" makes me sad.
---
 &gt;~~skinny ass~~
---
Twink
---
The only slow down I like to use during events is Corrupt Intervention, It‚Äôs usually enough time to get at least 1 hook in before the gens start to get going.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of hours you put into this game
---
A hand-crafted belt buckle made by Susie, and the vest off the back of a **former** hitchhiker.
---
my bad, woops.
---
I've stopped caring about what survivors think about my gameplay a long time ago. They're never satisfied and they never "return" my hospitality.
---
I really thought about dodging in the lobby when i saw 3 flashlights but im in the low ranks so i thought i could deal with it but nope. They called me trash in the end game chat which i know i clearly am but doesnt mean u gotta rub the salt in the wound my guy..
---
Gave up after  2 HOURS...
---
28
---
It is really nice seeing all them zeros though. Good job man.
---
Thankyou!!
---
naw, I was curious. Hope to see it soon.
---
Technically, according to not_Queen, the chests belong to the killers.
---
So essentially, you‚Äôre returning something you‚Äôve stolen.
---
If you get close enough for a short range hit it often locks on to the survivor so you'll pretty much get a hit.
---
I didn‚Äôt know the lawsuit ended also I really don‚Äôt think he will be added cause trapper is basically Jason. It would be cool if he would be a killer but I have doubts
---
I just really want an original killer.
---
My game freezes at the end game lobby every game on xbox
---
Is it a one time payment of $10?
---
It hasnt ended yet though they have a completely different lore. Then again we have hillbilly and leatherface, legion and ghostface, if we get pennywise that's pennywise and the clown.
---
Yeah, especially towards the general Asia servers or something
---
I think I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and spend them, since it caps at 1mil I don‚Äôt wanna waste the rest of the bloodhunt by not getting any more bp from matches. I‚Äôm just deciding on whether or not I want to use them to get hex ruin as a teachable from hag for my main killer or use them for another survivor to get their teachables for my main surv. Trying to weigh out the better option at the moment
---
YAS
---
Ghost on wraith is really good, not saying its OP but its def not brown addon bad. and exhaust addons legit get rid of survivors best perks with no downside. and np :)
---
lmao fair enough man
---
LMFAOOOO
---
Leprechaun, freddy and babadook I understand why you wouldnt want that, the other movies however it's a lot more then "Just a guy"
---
Face rushing doesn‚Äôt exist!
---
This will do. Now get out of here.
---
Got it in one!
---
The only common add-on that counter exhaustion is the toxin. The green version of that is probably her best add-on (minus iri heads bit im still in deep denial that they exist) but seeing as Huntress is not top-tier I think it'll be fine. At least she has to hit the hatchet first, if she m1's then hits you it doesn't matter. Ghost is fun and decent add-on, I wish that more browns had the same idea bit it's really just wraith and nurse with the cool browns and that makes me sad
---
At least for me what work is to dance with them a little.
---
You get close they spin, you take a step back and then you move forward and attack or attack if they are close.
---
But to be honest I think that should be taken away, considering the problem with killers FOV has never been corrected giving survivors another advantage based on that seems unfair, it is even against physics, if you are running forward your inertia is to go forward, not to be able to spin in 360 so easily, just look at the NFL jukes and even they are not able to move that freely.
---
Did you claim the reward after you completed it?
---
I‚Äôm seriously surprised no one DC‚Äôd
---
When I went to it said it was already claimed.
---
It gives you 1000 bloodpoints after the match. Running an offering increases the amount of blight gens by 1. It also makes it so they give 3000 bp after match. Sadly, the extra bp cannot ve modified by wglf or bp increase perks or offerings. Blight hools work the same for killers except theres 4 base.
---
Blight gen gets you 3000 extra bloodpoints for doing. We need to grind a lot for this too,  just by doing different thing. Which is hard when killers are playing the way they are.
---
Oh my god I havent logged on in a few days and all 3 of my dailies were for killer. Literally took me an hour and a half, and I got each one done in a single game.
---
I spent a solid 10 minutes earlier trying to figure out which character had TINH for the one challenge and then realized it was a general perk I somehow didn‚Äôt have unlocked on anyone
---
Removed for name shaming
---
It can be shroud of separation
---
The Shroud of Separation is the only other killer offering that doesn't reveal itself, as far as I'm aware.
---
Oh yea I'm aware of the bp difference but what's the physical difference? Are they the ones with the jack-o-lanterns chilling on them?
---
I feel so bad for little Claudette ;(
---
And a quick update: I just leveled hag up to 35 and bought hex ruin from her web, switched over to ghostface and leveled him up once and found hex ruin in his web. After all of that, my 1,000,000 bloodpoints went down to 67,000. Just in case you‚Äôre wondering about how much it took to do all of that if you decide you want hex ruin :)
---
You can literally do that though can't you?
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
A: If you cleansed totems NOED doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
B: If you made it all the way to the end of the match, and still de-pipped, you obviously didn‚Äôt do anything to help your team anyways, meaning you weren‚Äôt robbed of a pip because bubba camped you, you didn‚Äôt do jack shit to earn a pip
---
They were responses in the order I listed the movies. Creep is "Just a guy."
---
some of these challenges look insanely hard. unhook 3 survivors during end game collapse? like no thanks :/
---
Azralynn has been a really great DBD and general horror game streamer for me.
---
Yerv is also great.
---
It's most likely a bug. The level hasn't even released yet.
---
As a killer I played around gens close to each other a lot. Since I don‚Äôt have ruin and everyone is bringing their nice tool boxes, I can only get like 3-4 hooks per game if I don‚Äôt guard my generators. I don‚Äôt really care if they are event gens or not tho, but if they happen to be, it‚Äôs just unlucky for survivors in that match but I want to play my game as well. Also slug slow down gens so the killer can actually have a chance to win. I know it‚Äôs not fun staying on the ground but leave you on the ground instead of get saved and go back to gen instantly is the whole point. Also camping is in most of the times a very bad play style unless survivors don‚Äôt know how to punish it or just farm their teammates anyway. From a killers perspective, you don‚Äôt always have the choice to use the event hook either. My advise would be just play the game normally and pick up the extra when you can.
---
It‚Äôs about high time for one of those. I love 3rd parties but sometimes u want something out of the box
---
Really? Even David?
---
Human highlighter
---
You‚Äôre fun at parties
---
But then your addon downs all of them
---
Earlier my friend killed someone.  Completely fairly, no tunnelling/camping.  So naturally the survivor had to message him explaining how bad of a killer he was. Then proceeds to add him to 3 different group chats so all of his friends can bash him.  I love this game, but the people who play it are awful sometimes. Especially those middle aged people who only breathe cigarrettes and know nothing other than DBD and smoking.
---
racism
---
But why? Even if it was impossible to escape traps (leaving aside players taking the game hostage) his power would not be even close to the hillbilly's that is pretty much what all killers should strive to be, so why not give him the opportunity to catch someone on the other side of the map?
---
&gt; All I want is a CHANCE to do my objective, the same as YOU.
---
Dude the killer is meant to stop you from doing the objective, are you stupid.
---
Nah I love the faceplants. When it happens so unexpectedly it's hilarious.
---
He‚Äôll probably get ton of bs hits through windows and pallets but zero hits with chainsaw
---
I guess that‚Äôs a back way of saying it üòÇ
---
They have three seasons of it. The one they did recently was called The Druid who went around murdering people in that live in an apartment complex in horrifying ways
---
I'm 1000 hours in dbd and I still use it. I'll know of the God pallet is used up before I enter the killer shack. I get to know which pallets were already knocked down or destroyed before I even get there.
---
It's not just for new players learning the window locations.
---
Killer is so much easier now with all the changes than when I first started playing...
---
me when I first started playing killer after maining survivor for months straight tbh
---
what if they have bright cosmetics tho
---
Dead hard doesn‚Äôt work half the time on PC because of dedicated servers
---
As long as you keep winning.
---
But yes, pretty much everyone here shares your hatred towards her. I never give hatches, give second chances if you are getting sandbagged, and if it's possible to tunnel them to death fast you'll be if you use Claudette.
---
Dude you either move your router next to your pc/console or you make sure you are not doing any downloads. If you still have bad connection you need to change your internet operator.
---
If you complete The Rift you get back all the auric cells that you used to buy it, so if you complete The Rift, yes, otherwise, it's $10 every 69 days (or so this last one was)
---
‚ÄúLol, I can‚Äôt believe these survivors just 7 gen‚Äôd themselves! When will they learn?‚Äú
---
Any jontron fans out there? :o
---
wHaT aRe U tWelVe?!
---
That‚Äôs okay, I just got into a lobby with 3 P3 claudettes and slaughtered them all and then left nea for the end
---
we do truly live in a society
---
4 survivors in beartraps isn't too bad, especially with green darkener. 4 gens sounds literally impossible unless we are misinterpreting it. 4 survivors sounds super hard, but doable with mint rag shackle make your choice hag or bloody coil trap all exits of shack trapper.
---
Not every killer needs to be like hillbilly, besides there are add ons that make his traps harder to see/dmg survivors that snap it. Also if they made it hard to escape from it would be way too op, its already bad being RNG based
---
If that one's not changed me and my group are gonna have the worst times of our lives.
---
Ah, so it's the same series. are the other 2 seasons as good as the first one? I liked it.
---
Iron grasp is gonna be mandatory for this challenge. It's not too hard if you combine the two you just gotta get people hooked 5 times not sure what map would be easiest on though. If you combine this with some stacks of Play with your food I can see it being a breeze.
---
Does spine chill still work through the oblivious status effect?
---
Yeah there are def camping killers out there still haha
---
Dude, if you didn‚Äôt get them before the update you are the luckiest person ever. The game has always been lagged af, the infinite loading screens were always there and probably will always be. That‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Oh so how difficult/time consuming would it be to complete it then
---
If no gens are done,  what's the point in slugging? I get it a LOT of the time, I do. I play killer as well, and I do not have ruin.
---
No he didnt miss. Meg made the injured noise. It could‚Äôve been padded jaws.
---
*cry*
---
Tier 4 sounds like the biggest pain in the world, but the flashlight one and the trap one doesn't sound too bad. The 3 unhooked during end game collapse sounds super super hard, but maybe doable with a 4 man swf? The dark sense so four gen one however is the biggest yikes, literally impossible if we aren't misinterpreting it.
---
Are you stupid? Lolololol. So should surviviors just not exist. Like no fucking shit that's their job, making something out of nothing. I literally said that in my post, so reread before calling someone stupid.
---
No it wouldn't be OP, most of the people who fall on traps are the ones you are chasing towards a trap, someone falling into a trap on the other  side of the map is such a rare thing to happen to consider it OP if you had the time to go to the other side to hook them.
---
And yes, considering Hillbilly is the most balanced killer, I'd say that all killers should be like him in regards of not being OP but not weak  either.
---
Well you inserted yourself into a genuine conversation to just spew random insults, and never answered my question
---
No effect due to never skipping leg day.
---
Reminds me of that vid where the kid microwaves &amp; blows up a glowstick and Dad runs in like "Not this shit again Frank".
---
Literally me earlier today, but in my defense it was for the 50,000 bp one with my wglf, and I took a hit and attempted taking agro after the unhook (also for another stack)
---
I feel like it's probably inexperienced players for the most part. At least on switch.
---
I personally would love to see some classic monster movie crossovers. Dracula, Wolfman, The Mummy, etc.  
---
Also, since SCP is open source to my knowledge, a certain SCP crossover would be pretty cool, too.
---
Yeah as a killer I notice higher levels do this. They just gen and one person loop. Only much later they save the guy
---
Its soo fun and nice... not always but it really helps winning chases in a game where its supposed to be about extending them.
---
Yeah for sure. Most people are kinda bad and I say that with fondness
---
Triple bp event when ;D
---
I think 600 bp isn‚Äôt even close to compensate for a possible winning and fun game. It also causes killers to depip even if they 4K. They just need some form of punishment.
---
stfu with that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it is‚Äù stuff. no other game I‚Äôve played has this issue, so there‚Äôs obviously a way to fix it.
---
Super appreciate it. I have more pics but I didn't want to overload the reddit Haha. They're all on instagram
---
They'll learn eventually. I'm so glad I can play it in bed comfortably now though lol
---
Now just give Sidney :)
---
Outplayed
---
The problem is the match page. For some reason its multiplying (bloodhunt) the pustula petals. 
---
Its supposed to be:
---
Base bloodpoints x 2 (bloodhunt) + pustula petal bonuses.
---
Instead its doing:
---
Base bloodpoints + pustula peta bonuses x 2 (bloodhunt)
---
Lmao nah, it was the bag my mask came in. I just never gathers it away bc I‚Äôm lazy ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Of course, if you can hit your skill checks then you don¬¥t need to gen tap. It¬¥s more for people who cannot deal with great skill checks. They can practice when Ruin isn¬¥t up and gen tap until they manage to get good enough at skill checks.
---
Tell this r/fortnitebr
---
Get banned lel
---
I fucking love that you're doing something for extra life my guy.
---
I am pleased to say, as someone who plays Meg (For the sweet sweet Zoey costume) that I have never teabagged.  
---
I do run away like I'm playing Mirrors Edge though.
---
you bring noed even with an ebony? why is that?
---
that discord link doesnt work :((((
---
Could you pull him out, dribble till he gets free and then kill?
---
Ya, your response went through. Your ideologue is respectable though I cant say I share it
---
I will never not mention how little skill you need to "main" Michael
---
I haven‚Äôt seen two cause the person that recommended it to me said that one is the weaker season out of the three. But they‚Äôre all self contained stories so it won‚Äôt mess up anything to watch out of order
---
Thats a spot on cosplay also Nea has guns
---
God that'll be the day
---
I already finish so... not really
---
Was going for one of the 4k archive challenges so it was a bit overkill I guess lmao.
---
Honestly I think this was done on purpose as the entity's realm is a confusing mess in itself. Also these are memories and memories are disjointed and fragmented on their own so it makes sense that  there are constant stops in the writing. I wish the narrator didnt sound like he was trying to get through his lines as fast as possible though.
---
It feels like Christmas as a killer. Giving and gaining bp as pig on xbox
---
Here are my opinions on each killer. So feel free to look at it and call me a moron later. lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pennywise: Personally not against him being in DBD I just have no idea on wtf would be his power and how the hell did he end up working for the Entity?
---
Candyman: Would be a very cool killer to have especially since I feel that the character itself isn't as well known when compared to other slashers like Freddy, Jason, Micheal, hell I think even more people know about the damn Leprechaun then they do about Candyman.
---
Pinhead: Another very cool killer to have with a lot of interesting ideas behind him and several different directions to take his power and perks given the whole 'Pain and Pleasure are one and the same' mentality and demonic and human origins of the cenobites.
---
Chucky: A very popular request with a not of people saying that his height would mean that he is not a possibility but there are some creative ways around it like instead of hooking he tries to perform a voodoo ritual to steal their soul or something.
---
Xenomorph: I want this so much to be a thing that I changed my steam name to 'XenomorphforDBD' so I really hope it is a thing especially since the first alien movie was the first movie to actually scare the hell out of me and gave me a phobia of parasites. 
---
Jack Torrance: Truthfully, I never even considered this guy until someone else pointed him out. So really between him and Pennywise, I would say making up perks, a power and a backstory would be a lot easier for Jack. Though I could be biased since I never saw the newer 'IT' movies and The Shining has been my personal favorite Stanly Kubrick movie and Stephen King adaption.  
---
Sam: Trick 'r Treat is a great anthology movie but honestly I just can't really picture Sam being in the game as a killer. I could see him being a feature of a map like he shows up on the hooks or generators or even being a major feature during a Halloween event but as a killer with perks, powers, ETC. I can't really see him in the game.
---
Art The Clown: This is a weird one, but I don't think Art can make it not because it's hard to come up with things for him to bring into the game or even a licensing issue. I think the reason why Art will probably never get in the game is that he would be too much. The film is so messed up and gruesome that I don't really know if BHVR could reflect that well in the game. I could see the clown getting a skin to look like Art but Art himself in the game would seem unlikely even if we're talking about a game where you hunt down people, slash/stab/beat/torment them in several ways before sticking them on a meat hook so they die. That's kinda small town s\*\*\*t compared to some of the stuff in Terrifier.  
---
Hannibal Lector: This does seem another question off 'how in the hell is this gonna work' since Hannibal is a normal human. I mean, yeah he's a genius, sophisticated psychoanalyst who views the concept of eating people as just a normal but fun thing in the same way a normal person would say beef or pork but that's it. Unlike the other killers who had something abnormal about them from the start, like the Trapper being a huge brute or the Huntress having the skills to take on an army platoon alone, or gained abilities after death, like Freddy becoming a dream demon or The Spirit becoming...well... an angry spirit, Lector isn't superhuman in any way but his intellect which could be hard to translate into the game. Still, if they did find a way to do add him I would say that it would be nice to have a rather none-slasher movie character into the game.
---
Norman Bates: Norman can be argued to being Cinema's first-ever 'Slasher' so if BHVR could add him into the game it would be rather interesting. Yet once again the only thing that I could see being a roadblock, outside of licensing, is coming up power and perks for the guy. 
---
Pyramid Head: I already know that I'm gonna piss off a lot of horror fans by saying this but I never actually played any of the Silent Hill games so I really don't know anything about Pyramid Head outside of the fact that he has a massive sword and he may be a representation of one the main character's desire to be punished. Outside of that, nothing. He does look cool and having a killer who has a weapon is just a huge blade could be an interesting mechanic, like his swipes are wide and powerful so he can take down everything in an area in front of him on the first hit but the downsides are that if he hits anything that isn't a survivor he has a much longer cooldown then the other killers and he movies insanely slow like base nurse movement speed slow.
---
Blind Man: A blind killer, in general, would be interesting. Like instead of seeing the world normally he 'sees' the faint outline of objects and buildings but as soon as he nears objects that make sound or noises something like gens, crows, or whatever then the view objects around it get more detailed  because he gained the ability to pick up information about the environment via sound like a bat. So really I don't even know if there needs a movie tie in for that, I just think a blind killer would be interesting.
---
Samara: Another interesting character. I like the idea that she is sort of like a cross between the Spirit and Freddy where she phases in and out like the Spirit but can teleport to places around the map like Freddy via televisions around the map. 
---
The Grudge: If Samara is a Spirit/Freddy hybrid then this one would be a Nurse/Micheal hybrid where they move very slowly but can limited teleportation like the Nurse but they get more powerful the more they stalk or harass survivors. Also, if they have that god awful noise she makes just be her terror radius then I know there are gonna be pants with brown stains in them.
---
Secret neighbor kinda flopped on release, although it's a fun game
---
Jason Vorhees: Ah, the one classic slasher that got away and will probably never be as long as Friday the 13th is still a game. But yeah, Jason is just one of those characters that feel like that they belong in Dead By Daylight since the concept just seems to fit him so well. Hope to see him in one day.
---
The Predator: As much as I love the actual Predator creature and the first two films and I can see him being a great 'hunting' killer due to his invisibility and can track survivors using his thermal vision. Plus, the Predator already one of the best, if not THE best, Mori in the game with the spine rip. Yet the only thing I can see being an issue is the fact that Predators normally don't kill unarmed civies but then again being held hostage by an eldritch abomination might just do that...or maybe flashlights are considered to be deadly weapons by the Yautja lol.
---
The Thing: Now this could be a rather fun killer with main power would be to take on the forms of survivors it attacked if not outright killed with his power also being able to make it so survivors can't see Hooked or down survivors unless they are directly in their vision making it easier for the Thing to operate as a fake survivor. Yet from what I heard, don't know if it is true or not though, BHVR claimed they will never add a shapeshifting killer to the game. But still one can hope.
---
The Miner: the original 'My Blood Valentine' is a pretty good slasher and the Miner is an interesting slasher character. Hell, I can already see his power would be that instead of a red stain, he gets a helm light and survivors that look at him get blinded in the same way a killer would view a flashlight.  
---
Classic Universal Monsters: Really hard to picture them in any way shape or form in the game. Maybe as skins for some of the other killers would be better?
---
The Leprechaun: Ah, this little green s\*\*t. While most of the movies are bad, some are so bad that they are good, I'm sure that anyone who has seen them would deny that the Lep is the best part of the films. Though like Pennywise the Leprechaun itself has a lot of different powers through the films that I can really tell what his actual power in the game would be. Maybe he creates illusions like conjuring up fake chests that if survivors tried to open then they get damaged or having him become stronger by collect gold that he takes from attacking survivors or something. 
---
 Fazbear: No....just...just no...please no...no...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
---
Josef/Aaron: Truthfully, out of all the movies on the list this is the only one I haven't seen so frankly, I have no idea about them.
---
The Babadook: The creature is a rather interesting one which does make it hard to translate to the game. Maybe he can teleport around but it's only to certain spots of the map or maybe he inflicts some sort of status effect to survivors near him like the Doctor's madness that makes it easier for the Babadook to track them down and kill em.
---
The Strangers: While I didn't care so much for the first movie, didn't see the second one, the idea of a trio or group of killers would be interesting. Maybe they could work where one player controls three killers by switching to them manually or after hooking a survivor that way it makes them harder to keep track off so it gives that feel that the survivors are being hunted by a pack of killers working together. Basically what everyone THOUGHT Legion was gonna be lol.
---
well they never got the rights to SCREAM, they only have the rights to FunWorld, who made the original "Fantastic Faces" and "Fearsome Faces" masks that Scream 1 and 2 used. the company now produces masks with the branding GhostFace. So they are allowed to use ghostface, and nothing else from scream
---
Frankling best killer perk
---
That‚Äôs terrifyingly good
---
Some people REALLY need to understand what Facecamping is. The term started when the hooks couldn't rotate and the killer could just stand there and body block.
---
So if you are not standing nose to nose with the hooked person, it's not face camping. I know it's a catch all term now, but too many people lump it all in together. Walking the area to check for other survivors in close proximity is NOT face camping.
---
On a side note: I am no longer calling it camping. It's now "baiting the hook". If survivors can send someone to distract you as "bait" to go where they want then so can the killer. I can hang a little worm on a big fucking hook as bait and if you fall for it, well....
---
yes davids too :) his face glows
---
Context: he/she was looping my ass for a spin for a good 4 minutes. I eventually got the 4k with meyers. I was purely being genuine, as i have never experienced a survivor above rank 18 (he/she was 16). I was not toxic at all, and as far as i know i wasnt doing ‚Äúcheese‚Äù strats or things like that. This is literally my 4th or 5th time playing killer as i get super nervous ill get my ass whooped. Super disheartening :(
---
Imo, we only need Jason, Pennywise and maybe 1 or 2 from that list, the others aren't iconic or really worth over a new original killer
---
As much as I dislike the implications of the Rift, the Archives are one of the best things to happen to this game in a long time.
---
Wow. It's not very vulgar which is good but completely unnecessary
---
Killers who DC becauce they got a map they don't like.
---
Forever freddy games just feel like an absolute chore though and the dream world is so dark :( I don't wanna have to up my brightness just for him
---
I thought they were joking because of the no vulgarity at 1st tbh
---
Removed for salty after game chat

Put on Billy with the steering addons ans just steered around, sniping people when I happened to see them. Fun match, got a 4k and a quest just by screwing around.

---
Thanks so much!!!
---
Jason, pennywise, Pinhead and Candyman are the four I'd say are most likely to be added, with Chucky and Xenomorph being a close second. Many on here is just due to my love for their movies such as Art The Clown, who would go into the game perfectly but yes, isn't iconic enough.
---
Ohh only a thousand? You say that as though its some small amount of time
---
Stupid answers
---
Okay cool, I‚Äôm not the best killer so I was hoping I didn‚Äôt *have* to complete those in order to get the next level
---
It will come out over time(couple weeks I believe) they are made to span the entire rift so they will be separated as such.
---
It already has, get over it
---
OhTofu has +5000, and I know a lot of other streamers do too
---
It‚Äôs not to hard honestly if your a high rank. A lot can be done in 1 match
---
Recently I've been stuck searching for games for a while, no matter survivor or killer. Might be because people don't wanna play around halloween but I dont believe so.
---

It's not hard and each totem is literally 12 seconds, why complain about NOED when your team can easily break them between gens, it gives you points as well (1000) and also the killer isn't always chasing you, in a break time you can destroy them, it's for survivor that don't cleanse totems that NOED is so effective because all of them say the same things... "why break them?"
---
I did 2 gens clean totem heal my team and unhook 1 person from camping Bubba
---
You sound like a Spirit main.
---
That looks awesome and I just noticed he is 100% Pinhead. 
---
From the teeth down to his love for torture.
---
I'm a survivor main
---
Spirit is also a no skill killer
---
Hope you get banned
---
Always Sunny and DBD, have all the upvotes!
---
Able to pick a song. 
---
I mean I know you kind of can.
---
I just play killer to do those tome challenges, I'm so excited I finally got the EGC sacrifice at the end... now I gotta disturb some crows. I wish you good luck on getting those Hallowed gens completed for the sake of good bloodpointsüëç
---
They only avoid humor where it will clash with the game, but ghostface is a humorous character. He already has a goofy mori, and clown's got plenty of goofy skins because it fits him, this mask would still work fine on ghosty.
---
Fun World's cosmetic is the license, that's why he's an original character and not a real ghostface from scream, the license they got is for the funworld mask.
---
90% of this sub is gay anyway
---
If my pathing is bad tell me this if i play as demogorgon I get looped 8-9 times on one of those pallets near a car (without even using shred ) but with trapper which has the same speed as demogorgon I get looped 3 times.
---
If you still don't believe me watch this video https://youtu.be/eJ8YJRwwF04 at about 5:15
---
1 person got tunnel and killer use lag switch to get him we just try to save him
---
How about the Noed one? Sacrifice 3 survivors during the endgame collapse with noed equipped... nice way to promote scummy gameplay.
---
I thought I preferred behavior's costume redesign, but i am really looking forward to this.
---
At the time it was released, it was easily the best mori we had ever had.  It's what inspired the more creative moris we got later on.
---
I know. But if i dont have the skills or materials to make it myself I would prefer to buy it.
---
Uh aight, keep up that mindset buddy. Spirit is just not fun and frustrating to play against cause she has no real counterplay. It's just a coinflip. Every other killer has concrete info the survivor can play around and therefore outplay them in some way. That's called real counterplay.
---
I actually play both sides, I always say "break totems" tho...
---
The thing is, totems aren't random, you start to realize this when you break them a lot, the map you're in is divided in 5 invisible zones, each zone contains a totem, so each totem is in their zone and can't be in a zone where another totem was...
---
If you break a totem that was in the side of the map, you can expect to find them all by keep going forward in each section (I'm sorry I know it's hard to explain and English isn't my first language, maybe I could consider to make a video on that?) Anyway you're right, one single survivor can't break them all but when I play solo survivor I always feel forced to break them all while doing gens, because I know other survivors are not interested in them, it happened like a bunch of times that I defused NOED by myself, can't be too happy tho because if each survivor helped as well, it would've been done in less than a minute, devs need to find a way so that solo survivors have better communications over totems
---
Can also confirm as known bug, just happened in my last game but I wasnt af a box, just running on Gideon and it started flying!
---
You forgot this guy: [Killer from a Canadian horror film called "Gutterballs".](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cd/21/14/cd2114fde5a4ba24e4d9da92c95ec682.jpg)
---
Oh. This reminds me, I meant to ask...
---
Can I complete the other challenges once I hit the epilogue node or do I have to finish all other nodes first ?
---
I agree with most of what you have to say honestly. 
---
Art The Clown I think could easily be worked in well though, Saw is much more gory then DBD is, Stranger Things is barely even a horror yet that's in here. He is a perfect slasher made for this type of game. The power might be tough however people say the same thing for many other killers that dont have a very unique power such as ghostface, leatherface, the pig, michael myers etc, all of which (except Michael because he was the first though I'm sure people would of questioned it if someone brought up the question) a common excuse back when they weren't in the game was that there is no good power for them.
---
Honestly if they want to add a blind man, the Don't Breathe character would be perfect, I dont want any other blind killer but him. Then again, Don't Breathe is my favourite modern horror movie so I'm sorta biased.
---
Sam has many possibilities for powers. For example he can place shards of glass and candy down that can have effects on survivors when walking past them, he can have stealth mechanics as well, his height can be also used as a power etc.
---
Pennywise has many possibilities for powers, there are countless ones on youtube if you want to search them up, my favourite of which would be able to have balloons float forward in a straight direction and he can choose when to make them pop which can have effects, with lots of his power also being based off fear.
---
Norman personally I dont want in the game just due to how normal and unappealing/ creative the character looks compared to people such as Myers, Freddy Kruger etc. but just having him in the game I would not mind at all.
---
Also with the terror radius thing with grudge, it would work a lot better being considered a lullaby, which is what things such as the Huntress's lullaby and Freddy's singing are considered. Terror radius's show where directly the sound is coming from.
---
That‚Äôs enough for a decent lightbringer score, and dying at the end means probably a silver unbroken, so I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb here and say you probably did poorly in chase and the 1 unhook resulted in your teammate immediately going back down. If you had left the teammate being camped behind you would‚Äôve had iridescent unbroken and maybe still a bronze benevolent (maybe not tho, that‚Äôs the only emblem I‚Äôm unsure of). You would‚Äôve escaped with a safety pip and the bubba would‚Äôve had far less points (He probably Safety‚Äôd). Moral of the story: If you‚Äôre gonna try to be a hero, understand that you‚Äôre putting your own points at risk, and if you fail the hero play, you feed the poor behavior the killer was exhibiting. Learn when to cut your loses and run
---
Yep...getting around 59 fps in a survivor lobby, I'll normally stay at 144 before the event. I haven't paid too much attention to fps during a game, but it stays above 100. My gpu usage sits at 40% in a game and 90% and above at the title screen and in a survivor lobby. This is with a 2080.

Umbra hasn‚Äôt been using ruin in her recent streams and doesn‚Äôt use addons because addons are for plebs

/u/peanits please bring up console crossplay to your team!
---
Yes especially on Xbox.
---
Legion is S Tier and everyone else is F Tier
---
This is so ridiculously close I don't think anyone would care either way. I'm still holding out hope though that they can get the license for Nancy and make a double pack for them.
---
Well ya, its a source of income for them, thats different. Besides, its still alot. Thats like saying your a slow runner because your 1 sec behind usain bolt (Or however its spelt)
---
Completely understandable
---
*Cyka Blyat Comrade*
---
Yeah the first four you named are exactly the ones I thought of, I love Art as well but realistically speaking it's not a big franchise, it's unknown for the most and can't happen because they wouldn't bother doing it, but it's not the only one, things more iconic as well like Psycho wouldn't go there either because they aren't really slasher movies and so on
---
I didn't forget him, I didn't know about him, it's such an incredibly small and minor movie that seems to have negative reviews from the fans it will never have a chance to be in DBD.
---
You should be using that on the "Change My Mind" template.
---
Tons of people on the sub have that much time. 1k hours is nothing compared to how much time some people have on WoW
---
Forever Freddy
---
but thats too much stuff for the pic
---
The only other thing I can do is let my day be ruined. I'm too stubborn for that. I just have to look at the positive when there's no hope in fixing the negative.
---
Yeah true, however what do you mean about Psycho? Psycho is widely known as the original/ first slasher film that started it all, they even had it as a question (what was the first slasher film) on scream 4.
---
I decided to main Dwight recently and as a consequence, I learned that Prove Thyself is a perk.
---
Is it a good one? Does it speed up gen progress a noticeable amount?
---
He preaches out really far with his weapon where as most killers just swipe their weapon so his hitbox is kind of wonky
---
A: Nurse is still better than Spirit, the ‚Äúnerf‚Äù did not change that.
---
B: you forgot The Huntress entirely
---
EVERYONE‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs too op and boring to play against with 0 counter, me included.
---
Expect a big nerf within the next month.
---
They're all the same template anyway
---
As someone who plays killer more casually I can tell you, I run into more toxic survivors than killers. It goes both ways. I get so many people who want to trash talk in after chat, I never camp or tunnel but I always get the ‚Äúare you mad bro?‚Äù when a few escape. No, I‚Äôm not mad, but I regret not hooking your friend instead of walking them to the exit gate to be nice because I‚Äôm just trying to do my quests and move on.
---
For treatment? Shock therapy services are available let 24/7
---
I saw someone use it as plague, quite funny. Plus the swinging + sound of her weapon
---
A mori heavily punishes the killer with a depip or blackpip... Not really the same. Killers already are discouraged from bringing moris by that while survivors are heavily rewarded for bringing OP items/add-ons.
---
It's why you run across far less moris than you face BNP, instaheal or keys.
---
Of course your are, that‚Äôs why your knowledge is so small on things you don‚Äôt entirely know. 
---
1. Spirit doesn‚Äôt take much skill you are right. 
---
2. Michaels does take skill or you just suck at making sure the Myers doesn‚Äôt hit T2 fast. You probably just sit on a genie and let him get into T2
---
New stages will be released every 14 days, and to access them you'll need to reach the epilogue node of previous tiers. How you reach it is up to you. Note that rift shards take a long time to farm, so if you want all the rewards your best bet is to actually do all of the challenges.
---
They should pull a Halo:Reach and do 3-4 daily challenges, with one higher payload/harder Weekly Challenge.
---
I was going to do that but I wanted to use the Robin template lol.
---
Just because I a survivor main doesnt mean I have explored the game. I've play all the killers at least 10 times. Lol. Sorry to make you salty. But is true
---
Thank goodness.  I was having trouble sleeping.  Can you put me out and wake me up when the entity recruits Jaws to the killer roster!
---
As a switch player, I cry. For I know not these backstories which people speak.
---
The killer also leaves with a depip or at best a blackpip for an ebony mori. They also get far less bloodpoints. That alone means that killers only use them in rare cases. Those cases usually are facing toxic players (blocked on steam because of a previous game) or a full swf with toolboxes.
---
The problem with survivor items/add-ons isn't necessarily how OP they are but that they always reward a survivor for using them, thus you see them so often.
---
Oh I agree surviviors are JUST as toxic. But i won't break event hooks and so on,  because I don't wanna take away the killers chance. I do not care to die at all, but when we are all being killed and slugged with out a single gen done, or mori'd off our first hook is bullshit. I'm not a toxic player, but if I wanna do anything anymore I have to avoid saves or try not to loop to "good" or I'm getting camped or instantly slugged off the hook. It's ridiculous. Everyone always wants to yell, it's the killers objective or we don't wanna farm and that's okay. But you don't have to play like a total cunt either. Idk why surviviors don't deserve to get challenges done just as much as killers. We get attacked which pitch forks for t bagging or whatever, but let us say something about a face camper. Oh they're just securing their kill, or that's their job, and so on.
---
*quality title*
---
I feel like Empathy is superior just because it doesn't have a limit and Bond does. I'm okay with not knowing where everyone is except when they're injured, so I know if the killer's near them and such.
---
All of the status effects are explained and detailed in the help section of the main menu. Cramming all this info into tooltips would be stupid.
---
Glad you haven't ran into them, hope it stays that way for you.
---
Spirit will most likely get a rework rather than a nerf, since her power is simple nerfing it winthout just making her terrible would be hard, her addons also need balancing. Her perks are great, I love Haunted Grounds in particular, it's on the Shrine rn, if you want to see how powerful spirit really is just watch some Streamers on YT playing her with Prayer Beads addon(removes phasing sound)
---
I dunno why so many people in this community are so defensive of her, as a killer the thing I hate the most is feeling dirty for using shitty tactics, seeing Spirit gameplay makes me feel reallyy dirty, Spirit CAN be fun to play against if the guy playing her is trying to make the game fair and fun for everyone, I ran into some that tried to not be dicks with her and they were really chill, but you'll most likely just find people running sweaty builds with her
---
Insta heals aren‚Äôt in the game cause it wasn‚Äôt healthy, One-shots and Mori‚Äôs aren‚Äôt healthy for the game now they should be just be removed or changed.
---
I just think they run awkwardly. This'll make me happier to play them though.
---
Currently I roll a 4 sided die whenever I play legion to pick who I play, it keeps landing on Julie annoyingly.
---
Nice, you guys managed to get some survivor and killer cosplay going on
---
Well you thought right!
---
Is the collection a time limited one?
---
In all those years you couldnt find the time to rotate the photo.
---
I don't want to say Xenomorph doesn't make sense, because people want it and that's what should matter first and foremost, but I think Predator would just be cooler. He could turn invisible like the wraith, but also have a thing for his heat seeking so if he had an uninterrupted view with the survivor on a map, no matter how far away he can see their body heat. You could even give him his plasma canon but make it so he only has so many per round, so conservation is key! I don't know.
---
I like Ripley as a survivor and Predator as a hunter, so that's just the way the dice fall for me.
---
Yo I might have been in this match.
---
I slug both and who ever spins first gets the hatch.
---
Nurse is strong, but her blinks are stl counterable, Smart survivors can still outplay her, after the last patch she is a fair killer to go up against, but still very strong, Spirit's power is barely counterable (and impossible to if she has beads)
---
My guess: there‚Äôs a server desync where your actual jigsaw progress is slightly more or less than your progress on the server. Once it ‚Äúthinks‚Äù it‚Äôs finished, the server starts updating the position of the hat as if you‚Äôre taking it off. This startles you, making you stop the box progression. To ‚Äúresync‚Äù and fix the error, the server just reverses the animation... for some reason.
---
The more i try to write about this the less sense it‚Äôs making.
---
Hes talking about DBD specifically. If they havent managed to fix it in 3 years across 30 updates, lets face it, they wont cause they dont know how to. Get used to it, its part of the game, always was.
---
Lol, she‚Äôs not getting a nerf anytime soon. The devs have said that for the foreseeable future they‚Äôre not going to touch her. They‚Äôre going to do The Doctor and Billy next. If they are going to nerf her, it‚Äôs going to take at least like 6 months.
---
Plus, they said they‚Äôre not going to rework her like The Nurse. They‚Äôre just going to change a few things
---
Just do totems... A big problem with the game is genspeed. BHVR has perks like noed and devour hope to encourage people searching for totems and thus slowing down gens a little bit. Imho those perks still aren't enough to encourage totems but the point is you can't change any of those perks until the problem of genspeed is adressed
---
Ah, who's got the rights to Scary Movie's mask? Because that's what I was referring to. The Scream guys wouldn't want the Scary Movie license on their character
---
I have broken 3 event hooks against the killer who was camping our event gen,  and another who was slugging us all but that wasn't because of that. It was to maybe get someone to wiggle free. So I get if it's the last gen or so on, but I played a ghost face who SEEN a team mate working on a normal gen and left her to come camp my event gen. He seriously checked every single inch attempting to find me,  instead of going after her on a normal gen. I don't mind slugging when they have legit reason, same with camping, I play killers as well. But with NO gens done,  there is no need to slug or camp ONE gen because it's the event gen. I'm not wanting free games or so on, I want normal matches like we play without events. I rarely get slugged, still deal with camping/tunneling not as bad,  and hardly EVER see a mori. Yet event time, and BOOM all the sweat. Which is okay when doing your shit, but don't completely ruin it. Just like I would say it's bullshit if surviviors broke every event hook against a killer denying them that chance for extra points and what not.
---
Thanks for the advice, might as well try it for myself rather than ignore her
---
Oh cool thanks
---
Mountain Mama Will I Am*
---
Wait what. It's the opposite
---
I would rather vs prayers beads. Games over in 5 minutes and I can get the fuck out. Games over in 20 minutes with forever Freddy unless you neck on first hook.
---
Every single Steve I run into Carrie's a flashlight and has crouch and use item bound to scroll wheel up and down respectively.
---
Fuck Steves.
---
I remember once i was playing as pig and i hooked a survivor and started walking in a straight line away from the hook and another surv ran straight into me so i hit him and he DCed. He then msgs me saying that he doesnt play with campers, like um excuse me i cant really do anything besides walk away from the hook sorry i didnt just use pig‚Äôs special ability to teleport to the opposite side of the map after hooking someone.
---
They won‚Äôt bowel movement me at the gates or baby mama me at the gates?
---
I know its unpopular but scratched mirror is so boring.
---
If you can grind it get her with shards so you dont waste money if you end up not liking her.
---
How does that make me salty? Maybe I don't find the same things fun as him so I'm ALOUD to ask a question. 
---
Fellow dick riding killer main I'm guessing??? 
---
I'm guessing a DC makes that challenge not work? But hey, keep that going bet he will get it real fast. Most bloodpoints is 4k,  my fucking ass if he didn't camp and tunnel everyone off the hook. Lol,  but you keep defending him when I simply ask a question. 
---
I also play survivor and killer btw,  and I don't find face camping fun UNLESS it was someone i found toxic. Not because I feel like ruining someones game. But you do you,  and enjoy the dcs.

Doesn‚Äôt a black ward not flip?
---
We can just put you to sleep forever. Jaws in dbd? It would be absolute insanity
---
Relatable
---
DCs are usually from toxic survivors. In fact, I get more DCs when I run hag on the game map than when I did playing as basement camping Bubba.
---
I cry for the list guy.
---
I didn't play enough to get past round 1 by now but really ? I thought the challenges were quite easy and was hoping the next rounds would be harder... But not this kind of hard where people could be encouraged to be toxic if they want to get the challenge. As a survivor, it's already hard enough to find a game with no camp, full team playing, etc. Basically no toxic gameplay in both sides, so if the challenges are encouraging these kind of gameplay... I don't know what to say.
---
I'm not sure, Nurse's rework didn't ruin her, just made her way more fair to play against, but here is the problem, Spirit's power at it's core is a bit unfair, they would need to make it more or less gimmicky than it already is to balance her, or make her way more noticeable while phasing which would be a good start, I really like Spirit lore, design and perk wise but in execution she is really unfun to go against and even to play as, it's like the same feeling you get when you use an Ebony Mori y'know?
---
But I think the devs know some people love playing her so they will probs do a good rework on her like they did with Freddy and Nurse, but it might take awhile since Huntress and Doc are also in need of reworks
---
Congrats!
---
What happend to him?
---
Everyone can see it if they finish the tier 1 challenges. 
---
They might change it yet who knows
---
I didn‚Äôt call it shit though mate I was expressing how wrong he is due to his small knowledge on the killer he‚Äôs referring to. 
---
I didn‚Äôt shove my opinion down his throat I‚Äôm telling him the reality of it to which he doesn‚Äôt have to even listen to me. 
---
Don‚Äôt claim you have some knowledge on a topic you clearly don‚Äôt have knowledge on.
---
Black ward definitely flips. 
---
I always think it‚Äôs insta-down hatchets/bottles or prayer beads when I see it.
---
I think it‚Äôs the white ward for survivors that doesn‚Äôt flip or I‚Äôm just going insane
---
Damn you too?! You and about 420,069 other players got the same thing! Y‚Äôall must be blessed by the entity!
---
IF they dc because they got downed,  that's toxic. If they dc from not liking the map,  that's toxic. If they dc while being face camped,  good for them. I'm never mad at my team mates for that. If they dc because the killer instantly tunnels them off the hook, good for them again. Killer mains wanna do toxic shit,  but yell "ToXiC sAlTy SuRv MaIn" when they disagree. If you honestly think face camping before EGC is okay,  you're trash. Sorry not sorry. UNLESS of course,  some is attempting to save infront of you or they've done something toxic to hurt your feels.
---
Now I'm mad all I ever get on Haddonfield is ghostface. Trapper looks amazing to play against!
---
I have 986 iridescent shards, wish me luck boys (and its exam week).
---
Jesus Christ most of these seem impossible

He deleted his account.

Also spirit takes skill haha

But why :(

I did post another: shot.

The rest is on my insta. Same username
---
Oh yeah, I'm not saying it's easy at all. Just more possible than some of them, *I'm looking at you do 4 gens with dark sense in one match challenge*
---
lol, good response. Yeah man, there are thousands of people commenting it.
---
I‚Äôve been saying they need some kind of a sea creature! I‚Äôm definitely down for the Diver!
---
First time? :))
---
It could totally work. Maybe a summer event? I want to see krampus for xmas.
---
BruhüòÇ
---
You remind me of a girlfriend i had. Gg.
---
I thought lvl II was automatically unlocked when players finished all of the challenges.... Hmmm, good to know.
---
Oh god I got so many References. 
---
1. Bioshock
---
2. Batman‚Äôs scarecrow 
---
3. Black ops zombies
---
4. Well it r minds me of zombies or Resident Evil.
---
Killer is still easier than its ever been in the history of the game.... did you ever play a low tier killer against a good swf with instant blinds or 4 of the old brand new parts?
---
It was probably a bug and there was never actually a killer in the lobby. Happened to me yesterday, just had to force close the app.
---
That's the bad one? How about 3 NoeD kills during the EGC? That is 100% more impossible.
---
Not only to guarantee it would you need 3 survivors alive at the end of the game minimum, all them probably need to be on death hook, survivors must not do totems (At high ranks there's never any totems remaining, ever). 50% of the time I have had survivors DC if they are downed by NoeD, EGC or not. 
---
This among others are literal wildfires and are almost impossible, it changes from a challenge to luck, and that's not what a challenge should be.
---
Speaking about the one you mentioned, High Rank Killers ALREADY pre-emptively expect Flashlights so they look at fucking Trees, walls you name it, they'll look at it just so they're not flashlighted. Also pretty much impossible. I guarantee there will be people who are able to get these challenges done don't get me wrong, just they'll be high ranks who have deranked to Rank 11+, and that's not how it should be, ever.
---
3 Unhooks after endgame has begun in 1 trial yikes :(
---
This survivor main logic is sometimes interesting (I'll DC SO MY FRIEND CAN GET A FREE ESCAPE AND KILLER CA T DO SHIT ABOUT IT) do you undurstand that slugging is risky right?
---
It's more rarely to see a killer DC than a survivor (4:1 proportion). 
---
DC's ruin the experience for everybody. The quitter should be punished and the rest should be somehow rewarded (at the very least not losing anything).
---
Yeah i did, its defintely easier now but its still not as easy as you portray it, Killer can still be very hard if you are not Spirit or Nurse
---
They still didn't finish tho so probably they are currently experimenting with what challenges would be fair
---
Well yeah, it takes around 5k hrs without 2x BP events to get everyone close to completion. You're not going to shave off hrs of grinding with a weekend long event.
---
Sorry my man
---
I've always wanted some kind of deep sea killer!
---
Really good advice. I did a two-face prosthetic before from batman and I tore a chunk out of my eyebrow once :/
---
Looks like my Boom Stick
---
Well well, if this isnt the upside down. Where is the demogorgon though?
---
Happened twice in a row. That's kind of annoying to have to close the game especially since I was streaming. Thank you for answering though.
---
Awwww, baby Billy needs noed
---
I got this game 2 days ago and u cant always use chainsaw it takes a sec or two to charge up so somtimes say if ur getting looped and their team is opening gate *happens alot to me* its good to use neod
---
Activate your windows my dude
---
Australian servers
---
That‚Äôs a horrible excuse to DC spirit isn‚Äôt that strong she‚Äôs not an automatic win just play the game and if you win or lose whatever it don‚Äôt matter it isn‚Äôt fair to the spirit player to do that
---
Well done.
---
I never got the "As intended" thing. It's an online game, what kind of online game wouldn't allow you to play with friends? But to awsner your question I like playing both but I do prefer to have atleast one friend playing with me, randoms can be unreliable as hell sometimes.
---
There's a some perks that straight up prevent players from working on gens, I think one is for scream, It's quite annoying as a survivor
---
Nope you‚Äôre definitely the first
---
Ya happened to me too
---
I mean tome 4 is like the final boss type thing. They are super specific but nothing less doable
---
The way I did these was invite some friends and tell them not to cleanse totems
---
Thataphobia is a good backup
---
Ha gayy
---
Rank/Ping/Hours/Rep could be any of these
---
I guess you guys don't appreciate japanese

The truth can be harsh üòÇ
---
This is in the US, isn't it?
---
Killer can't check any of that on console can they?
---
I see this happen a lot. Its like the guy is counting.
---
What the fuck is a rupaul
---
*Grabbing peels*
---
Well once i went up to like 400 devotion... After like 2 hours i leveld down to play with the "peasants"
---
Not sure on console but on PC these are 80% the reasons someone will dodge
---
I demand this as a addon!
---
Funworld owns the og ghostface mask and the scary movie ghostface mask with the tongue. I don't know if they own all of the scary movie ghostface masks, but they probably do.
---
It wouldn't be Scream's character anyway, our Ghostface is Behavior's character wearing Funworld cosmetics. Scream's an entirely separate entity strangely enough.
---
Overcharge might be a good sub for Ruin.
---
This is more like Deceit, not dbd.
---
Corrupt Intervention is a Plague perk. This perks forces survivors to either go near you to do gens and lets you find them easier. They can wait out the timer but by that time you should have already found 1 survivor.
---
Doesn't explain for PS4 tho
---
It's a sign of you being thankful or respect
---
Don‚Äôt fill her stock, protect your cock
---
Yeah, we finally lived to see the day were adjusting FOV is not a setting or console command, but a Perk that you have to grind for.
---
How do you know they're purple flashlights?
---
yeah, everyplayer have right to fund whatever they find fun. DC too. kek
---
there has been a lot of boosted killers because of the archive
---
The thing is though. Nobody cares about their rank. Moris are more bullshit than keys and should be changed.
---
To add to this. You run across far more ultras on survivors because its a 1v4 game. 4 times more likely sweaty stuff is in your game.
---
my bet is he is slugging with t3 and down everyone at last XD
---
Lorem ipsum is just a dummy text, mostly used in programming and web development. I believe it's Latin, but the text itself doesn't make a lot of sense, iirc.
---
I got the game 2 days ago dumbass
---
*a plane toilet seat
---
Just about 98% of the players got that leak.
---
üíÄ
---
I know right
---
grind out characters that have perks you want and then find a main and unlock cosmetics/perks/etc.
---
there are no toxic in game, like you said :  
---
 players has the right to find whatever he wants fun. if they found not fun, they DC. simple
---
Ty
---
I highly doubt it was deliberate. Especially when coupled with the absolute mess that is The Spirit's bio. It's more likely they can't be hooped paying a decent writer or even an editor.
---
Well that's a fucking lie
---
Baby dweet and badass Nea. Awesome job btw!
---
They're using scratched mirror
---
That‚Äôs true, although this clip was before the last rank reset
---
word of advice if it seems like the killer sucks 9/10 they have noed so better start looking for totems
---
Lol I've played a handful of matches with you on Switch, recognize your Switch user as u/ItsKnots haha 
---
It really does suck the Switch has no sort of communication though, asking for a party-chat type system may be a stretch for Nintendo, but we can't even message friends, which is unbelievably lame.
---
I've had the game for almost two weeks, and I hit the ground running, working on gens and undoing totems. The amount of people I see who play the game just hiding in lockers are looking for the hatch, or hiding from the killer and doing nothing is disgusting.
---
Makes sense, yeah.
---
If I had a dollar for every time I seen those ‚Äúsneak peek‚Äù posts, I‚Äôd be able to buy out the whole pass and still have money left extra!
---
I exist
---
That the thing though. They don't suck. I can't even figure out why they even need it. Not saying my team was bad just we were all equal including the killer.
---
Would you be opposed to me making the chapter logistics for these? 
---
(Killer powers, perks and survivors?)
---
I saw this exact image days before on Twitter days before and I‚Äôm pretty sure both of them just reposted that person‚Äôs pic at this point.
---
What the hell constitutes as a balanced killer? Because for the longest time no one said anything about spirit other than prayer beads (which I will say should be ultra rare)
---
The fact stands the killers that are actually viable will be hated. But just because they're strong doesn't mean they're bad for the game. 
---
And can we stop arguing about the perks? With how set the meta is it makes it to where it's a lot more stressful without "the good perks". A spirit still has a high chance of losing within minutes without ruin, even though she can use perks to aid in finding people fast. 
---
People get so caught up in what's good and bad to do, when it feels like they forget the best chance for winning is to be unpredictable.
---
I feel like people won't be happy until any decent killer gets nerfed to the level of pre-buff Freddy. 
---
Now I'm not saying actual problems to the game shouldn't be handled (cough cough old legion)  
---
But there are ways around her without killing her viability.
---
Just play ghostface so you can BM them when you expose them and hook them
---
Let those BMs get fucked
---
It'd be weird to credit themselves.
---
Can you give an example of one? Now I'm curious..
---
Why would the archive boost them?
---
them ranking up cause survivors are just trying to get the archive objective done then die
---
Which one? The boss or challenge? XD boss wise anything from dark souls 3 or cuphead. Challenge wise unhooking 3 times after the endgame in 1 trial
---
Every broken shit is in favour of killers. Pallets, windows...
---
i know right ? i want more!
---
Spin offs? You can literally play the campaign (The Sacrifice) he dies in...
---
i think spine chill is a really good perk when you‚Äôre just starting out, tbh. it can help a new player learn how to react to being approached by a killer because there‚Äôs some semblance of a warning before the heartbeat. 
---
it‚Äôs also situationally useful for more experienced players‚Äîa tiny boost to gen progress occasionally while a teammate is running the killer around doesn‚Äôt hurt.
---
i run it occasionally on survivors i don‚Äôt want to sink a ton of bps into for a daily or whatever and i‚Äôm never sorry i brought it in lieu of the other basic perks (resilience, this is not happening, etc)
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted when you‚Äôre just saying it how it is.
---
What exactly is considered BMing at exit gate? I've never thought that just 'standing there, letting them hit you and then running/crawling out' is BM, it's literally free bloodpoints.  
---
And sometimes, if they're really dumb, they don't realize I have NOED so they're not close enough to the cutoff so they can't escape in time when they get smacked.
---
I love when everyone brings flashlights in a SWF. Just pop in Fire Up and watch them panic as you're swinging at them way sooner than they expect after picking someone up, bonus points for Mad Grit
---
Giving her the same amount of delay after unphasing as the Wraith after he uncloaks would be a step into the right direction.
---
Obviously add ons would boost it but have one that cuts the delay to the current speed but prolong the time to recover from a missed attack.
---
His good name is ruined thats must be reason why wear a mask
---
Play styles that ruin the experience of other people can he defined as toxic. Simple.
---
...said noone...ever
---
This belongs in r/cursedimages
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be losing your blood points and items because they DC, you should get 5k survival because of the DC.
---
I think a delay in reappearance time after phasing is a good counter, similar to wraith.
---
Sarcasm?
---
Whilst playing Pennywise, after the 5th time a Claudette presses the crouch button the match instantly ends and you get an Entity Displeased as Pennywise just fuckin dies
---
Try swapping Iron Grasp for Sloppy Butcher. Other than that, it's a good new player build. Just make sure to not be afraid of pallets when running Enduring. Swing through all of them if there is even the smallest chance of hitting the survivor.
---
they need to figure out how to give them almost as much info as swf can give then like I said can work around that then there would be no need to nerf swf instead they would work around it and buff some killers. it would be hard to do this but I bet with work it could be done
---
How is this at only 170 karma?
---
I had a look through them not looking forward to week four that's for sure it's just gonna encourage people to play selfishly or farm
---
Get four basement hooks in one match, get three unhooks during the endgame timer, repair four gens in one match search 5 chests in one match gonna be difficult if your not swf. 
---
I've done all these things at one time or another but it's maybe happened once or twice since I started playing and that's without other players trying to achieve the exact same thing.
---
you cannot control something RNG doing. totem can be spawn very close, very open, or maybe very hidden. use thrill of hunt if you want protect your totem at very best. that protect totem. or maybe use other perks if you worry much about totem break that fast as flash
---
Sounds about right
---
 queue times...
---
They are dumb or they are 12yo .. hard to know which case it is. I had done the quest done too and I would be slightly mad too in this situation, who wouldn't a little bit.. but some people have no brain. I love to play pharmacy with plunderer and the other chest perk from ace and I will not change it because other people have a quest. Sure if they ask friendly in the lobby I would change my build for sure, but If they don't ask I don't care if someone maybe has the quest or just want to loot chests like me
---
Many people don't like playing against NOED, because you mostly see it used by newer people and the kills in the end feel "undeserved" on the survivor side. That being said, it's one of the stronger killer perks and the complaining about it is often exaggerated in my opinion, so feel free to use it. If you're new to the game, you'll probably miss a lot of chainsaws, so NOED can still be useful on Billy. You might get some complaining messages though.
---
Enduring is one of the best killer perks because you can run through pallets with little time lost when you get stunned. It becomes more useful the better the survivors get, because they'll know how to loop and stun you instead of just throwing down pallets.
---
Iron Grasp is pretty useless. Hooks are close enough together that you should always reach one anyway. From the perks you have, I'd replace it with Sloppy Butcher to make healing take longer and buy you some time, since you don't have any other game slowing perks. 
---
Bitter Murmur is fine with what you've got but a good replacement spot once you have BBQ.
---
Bill is a boomer and he kills boomers
---
Yeah it's gonna be ridiculous.
---
How could they give solo players as much info as a swf player? If they gave them the same info as a swf then that could make the game even more difficult for high rank killers. Some killers do need buffs though, like bubba and wraith.
---
The poses are on point too!
---
I had a game and it says I earned 64k but then I saw my points were 58k and I didn't got my 6k for some reason..
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Ok boomer
---
The event gens are purely for bloodpoints, if you want to complete the event you have to level up in the rift to 47. I don‚Äôt hear people complaining about how hard it is to complete the event but I did the math and I need to play 630 more games to get all the serum. I‚Äôm already level 14 so this is ridiculous in my opinion. I think I‚Äôll see more post about it when we get closer to nov 13 and no one is near half way done. 
---
The rift is supposed to be done over the course of 10 weeks and to complete the event you have to do well over half of it in 2 weeks.
---
that's my fetish..
---
Good luck, may the entity be in your favor!
---
Are the new cosmetics for day of the dead all purchasable with shards?
---
That's a shame, but I wish they would at least tell us this is a thing that's happening instead of ignoring the people with that version. I play on the switch, and if we're not going to get an event, that's fine, or if it's going to be delayed that's okay too. But tell us. Even if the news is we're not getting archives and such period, that's better than being left in the dark.
---
Only took you so long because matchmaking is busted
---
No one should be have penalties for wanting to play with their friends.
---
Just make sure to get off the gen when it sparks.  No progress is granted during the sparking animation but you can still get skill checks.
---
Are they available to get with shards or auric only? Haven‚Äôt had time to check.
---
Pop goes works fine for me instead of ruin but I‚Äôm only just purple ranks
---
no, because SWF strength does not come from anything in the game. The advantage SWF has is the voice coms.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs your rank? I‚Äôm rank 12 and takes me between 1-10 minutes usually but I‚Äôm NA and I just hopped off the last one I played took me about 8 min
---
Xept fucking spine chill, cuz that still fucking works. **AND I HATE IT!** how the hell am I supposed to stalk survivors by looking at them when spine chill activates WHEN I LOOK AT THEM. Ghostface is still extremely hard to play thanks to that
---
I run noed on shit killers lol. That being said, i hate noed and it needs a rebalance.
---
Insanely well done, do you have some more pictures of it?
---
yea i saw it. I think they are going to tweak them a bit but pvp games aren't friendly with hard challenges that ask you to change your gameplay so much that it hurts your team.
---
There is absolutely no issue by having almost impossible challenges in a solo game or 1V1 pvp, but when you have 4 other players that rely on you not trolling it's not acceptable.
---
I never DC unless it's toxic survivors
---
no it's more about the fact it's becoming really annoying to see those kind of post every day. The fact people absolutely want to show how gay they are as if we didn't get it already.
---
Honestly i love your own style of the doctor a lot, looks a lot creepier
---
It‚Äôs not right but I‚Äôd be more looking at the fact of the amount of survivor dcs before thinking about the few killer :p
---
This was after rank reset, between ranks 15-20
---
Insta DC
---
I mean that would be a newer killer so they‚Äôre probably still learning too
---
I was doing a match as survivor yesterday and I knew my teammate had that challenge because he kept leaving the gen, running to the same rock and coming back. Wondered what he was doing at first until I noticed he crow land back and he immediately went for it
---
üò≠ please no
---
Inb4 overused ‚Äòwhole circus‚Äô comment
---
Either that or give survivors secondary objectives
---
and I agree the survivor DC rate has been insane but killers still get extra points when a survivor DC's, when the killer DC's we all lose everything and it's getting exhausting plying great games with petals or bloody party streamers on and then a killer DCing cause the survivors are looping them
---
He do be lookin fresh doe üò∂
---
point taken
---
Same is with survivors, I am playing a Doctor make game as long as possible build coz i had a lot of BPS on him and after every game where 2 or 3 survivors escape 
---
gg ez, noob killer, you suck, haha baby killer, lol git gud, haha 360d u (when I am switching to treatment actually for more points)
---
Poor Trapper was so confused !
---
Awesome! It seems like there isn‚Äôt even a handful of cosmetics that weren‚Äôt auric only in the past 3-4 months. I‚Äôve saved up so many shards.
---
Yeah when I play Killer I show no Mercy unless someone comes up to me and starts bowing.
---
That looks dope not gonna lie.
---
Tbh Quentin's face is such a meme and part of the DBD "folklore" now that I will feel sad if the change it.
---
It may do but I really dont want my inbox to be destroyed by toxic messages lol
---
I wanna see you post that on facebook.
---
Ohh ok when did they say that? I didnt know
---
Thankyou for the tips.
---
What happens to those who are Bi?
---
It was a post on the forums discussing adding him, not queen responded saying they're not planning on looking into getting his license
---
Oh I'm soooo sorry you lose everything
---
It actually give me a reason to dc now. So BHVR will hurry up with the DC punishment after years that survivors abused that sht
---
I agree with your first point, but completely disagree with the second. I'm confident that most of the time they are on coms
---
Complimenting a cosplay is apparently taboo.
---
Maybe the community hates gay people, idk. 
---
People are morons
---
Play With Your Food will always lose stacks from any offensive action I believe. Demo using Shred, regardless of hitting or not will consume one stack. The same with Huntress‚Äô hatchets
---
a splinter?
---
Wakanda for ever !
---
That's actually not a bad idea tbh. Would make it a lot less annoying
---
Nancy?
---
You need a *camped/tunnelled* section too. The board will be filled to the brim. Good luck though :)
---
Most probably are, but again not everyone has a mic, why should they be punished for having one when they don't? It's impossible to nerf in a fair way for both sides.
---
what‚Äôs new
---
Bro why didn‚Äôt you react lmao /s
---
Rank 4 PC Killer here, I'm looking at an average of 1hr queue times in South America.
---
Rank 15 Survivor tho, my queues are nearly instant, or usually within five minutes.
---
Ya that is why I put my reddit username on, so people can send me messages. I sort of like that there is no end game chat for dumbasses to talk shit in but also kind of miss it, too. You know how it goes.
---
Do bones
---
Im on EU and I find matches almost instantly playing killer. Theres no survivors at those ranks I guess
---
They do but they also down rank, also myself as a killer then feels bad and have to let them play for free because of the dc it ruins both sides.
---
Man, that's so cool, I wish I had a friend who was as much of a horror buff as me :( good on you guys!
---
South American Redrank Killer here, you guys have it easy, cause' I'm stuck looking at an hour queue times :l
---
They said for ages now dc will be getting punished and it‚Äôs not been touched so I wouldn‚Äôt hold any hope
---
I do them 24/7. Can't always get them all.
---
Offer a bedham or hawkins, they have some good totem spawns.
---
I think they could start by simply adding more totems and cleansing them is worth more BP, that‚Äôd give survivors an incentive because they‚Äôd also be worried about Killers running NOED
---
You can‚Äôt just revoke likeness, there are contracts in place
---
Besides why would she blame BHVR when it was some random fan account that posted it
---
It's good if someone is on their last hook and you unhook them then drop the pilot closest and jump across back and forth while the injured person runs away and then you just loop the killer
---
Why am I'm not getting every bloodpoints for the match?  
---
It even says total 67 but I'm missing 12K I also used a Pustula offering.  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ZUwPraG](https://imgur.com/a/ZUwPraG)
---
So I've had a few survivors messages asking why I "disconnected" dispite still being in a game. It might just be a issue with the survers at the moment.
---
I'm just saying it's clear that the original design intent had no coms in mind.
---
Yeah. They mentioned about it last dev stream that will be introduced after the dedicated servers
---
Welp, at the end of summ.. fall..? Eventually we'll see it happen
---
I just hope they rebalance noed along adrenaline. Both are such unfun perks to go against
---
That does sound logical. But I had this happen while I was running by myself with no Jigsaw boxes used or nearby. TBH, it looked like a crow, so I'm wondering how tf it got bugged like that.
---
If it bothers you so much then don't play the game :)
---
Jeepers creepers ?
---
I dont think it would be that efficient in practice
---
Yes survivor mains, downvote me more! I take then as trophies üñ§
---
oh word? I hope thats the case then cause this is getting fucking tiring lol
---
What a great angle!
---
Well done ‚ÄòA Nightmare on Elm Street 2010‚Äô, we‚Äôre all very proud
---
Survivors also shouldn‚Äôt get a debuff to generators or healing by default for playing with friends. That‚Äôs just a stupid thing, it just makes it more miserable for survivors who play and have fun with friends. Besides there are perks already to help slow the game down.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you can even ‚Äúnerf‚Äù SWF, which aren‚Äôt really that big of a deal. I‚Äôve lost to SWFs, it happens, you just move on the next game.
---
Ironic. Your username is extremely original too :)
---
I understand what you're getting at, and yeah maybe you're right. However, I still think they should do something about swf, just not sure what
---
That game can‚Äôt even do anything with the property due to the turmoil the whole franchise is in right now with regards to rights. If by some miracle that gets straightened out there is some hope that Jason could appear.
---
It works for me in green ranks
---
Ok wow thanks for telling me ! Im still hoping for pinhead sometime soon
---
No doubt i love pinhead
---
Dude.. people still cry about BBQ when it has around 7 counters now
---
I mean.. you might ask too much! When playing survivor use your brain? Naaah quit with that sht
---
The paint on Janes head and body cosmetic are glowing also. It's so nice.
---
well i hope you re at least main clown then
---
"Green ranks" higher ranks would not fall for this.
---
See, I thought I'd finally figured out how to loop well, but then in post game chat the killer explained they just needed a chase daily so they were letting me get away. HNNG MY HOPES AND DREAMS.
---
And going against try hard WWF's nearly every game is miserable for me and other high rank killers. Going against swf over and over again makes me not want to play another game. If you think they "aren't really that big of a deal" then you clearly don't play red rank killer.
---
Same here. My fav. Movie killer next to jigsaw :D
---
You know that.. in a p2p game to transit in a dedicated server environment you need, mmh how can I say it, run tests?? I know, shocking
---
For this week, they changed it pretty well straight after they were released. This has happened once before - this year - and it‚Äôs usually because of a bug or something.
---
Well yeah but by the time you're in the higher ranks you're probably not looking at the tips at that point even I don't look at them. They're just meant for new players
---
The first 4 were in the shrine initially. But for some reason changed after the patch.
---
U dont say
---
All I have are bruh moments.
---
Omg that's so cool, I'm definitely getting that for the Thiccness then
---
They changed the shrine to go along with the new update but the wiki post was written before they changed it. The shrine is the same for all dbd players regardless of region. Hope this helps
---
Ah, I see. How soon after did this happen? (a day, a few hours, etc?)
---
Will Hex: Ruin be on offer next week then?
---
In a live server you have more people= more tests = faster fixes
---
Just the fact you confuse hitbox and latency make me wonder if you actually thought about the problem more than 0.2s..
---
Ptb now is almost empty, since there's nothing to test. Will be useless to tests servers with 100 people
---
A week ago, survivor ques were fast and killer ques took a long time. Now, killer ques are fast and survivor ques take a long time.
---
I keep spending my shards on killer cosmetics, but I was running out of ones I like. These Legion skins sure are going to get me back on the grind though
---
I also don't know if its just the difference between the glow and the overall lighting of the map but it looks like the glowing gets more bright the darker the map gets.
---
I think it was within 24 hours. And unfortunately, I am not sure, but I don‚Äôt think so. This didn‚Äôt happen last time, and some of those perks that were on offer and then were changed still haven‚Äôt appeared back on the shrine. :(
---
Not that we‚Äôve heard of. Doubt they‚Äôll do anything to them unless they touch moris too
---
It's hard for some people look at this as a sarcasm post, shitpost or w/e for a simple reason: some people actually think that, actually more than some..
---
I would pee myself if I saw this in a dark alley. Great job!

Places to discuss survivors DCing:
---
Threads about survivors DCing
---
Threads about toxic survivors
---
Any thread that suggests killers mains aren't necessarily Angels
---
Think that covers it
---
:|
---
Holy fuck lmao you‚Äôre right it does
---
I first saw the Legion's on Macmillan's and thought I was facing some electrical body type of new killer. It was just this blue glowing mass coming towards me. I think that the map definitely has to do with how much of it is visible
---
Swim team Quentin would make me a survivor main.
---
man your like the only person who don't complain about noed like in this community that I seen so far
---
Its just a hard thing to tackle, like in the way you proposed what if it's just a 2 man swf? Half the team would just be dead weight essentially just cause they probably have mics, which (and I speak from experience) are probably not being used for strategic purposes. 9/10 they'll be talking about eating ass or something.
---
I was going to main Quentin, but Jane came out. I would instantly swap back after p3ing him if they gave him his Speedo outfit.
---
Dude, just because you don't do something doesn't mean you're entitled to make people play like you want.
---
I've seen a lot of survivors being dicks than killers, and as killer I'm gonna try to make you miserable since every survivor I encountered did the same. Why would do I change how I play and be more kind if 90% of the people are dicks? Make no sense
---
Honestly they already nerfed swf in the best way possible; by making it rank for the best member of the group.  I havent had nearly as many problems since then. Even before that, though, I didnt mind swf too much.  It just makes you a better killer, since you need to be able to have more map pressure and such.
---
Someone wanna fill me in on the devil's past?
---
Nurse??????
---
True. Like adrenaline, especially when you injured all of them and suddenly 4 adrenaline pops and you can't do shit about it
---
So...not the correct release station? HAHAHA.
---
Swf can definitely be annoying but nerf? Idk some people just wanna play with their friends others do it for the sole purpose of how easy it can be, maybe give a reason the killer should stay like bonus bp or something?
---
Thank you for the 136th time :)
---
I second this for Xbox One also.
---
He is so toxic, I would just ignore him
---
Why are lobbies sideways now? Please tell me they'll revert this cause this look awful compared to what it used to be.
---
I don't think so you just have to be observant of what the survivors carry and be more aggressive towards them during the game
---
It's immersion breaking I'll agree, but it's so much fun, being able to play with your friends. I think SWF is a big reason why this game is as active as it is.
---
It would be cool but somewhat unfair. Console dbd has slower camera movement than pc and worse ping from what I've seen. So while it would be nice, console players will be looked down upon every single game
---
I had a stroke reading this
---
these are honestly the best cosplays i‚Äôve seen shared on this sub! y‚Äôall legit look like the characters and i fucking love it
---
That‚Äôs a shame. Keys need just as much work as moris ):
---
You dont seem to get the thing here. Look closely at the points I "earned" and the points I "got". !
---
Maybe just fix it as a new optional face? People can be goblins if they want.
---
Thanking the good skill checks &gt; tapping
---
I prefer killer dailies anyways, because killers aren't just reskins of each other.
---
Why do I need to open an exit gate as Laurie Strode? Why not Ace Visconti? It's not like they have mechanical differences.
---
It's taking the risk that he find the hatch, killing 3 people and seeing the last guy escape by the hatch is probably the worst thing when attempting this achievement. Also, nothing stops him from entering another locker
---
I'd argue that nerfs are something that maybe should happen, not something that definitely should happen. Also, why'd you have to get all childish in your second comment...
---
Yeah its a difficult idea to make work. I can see console players being able to play together(if sony and microsoft decides to even work together lol) and maybe switch and mobile together, but adding pc to the mix makes it difficult. 
---
And while a setting for preferred players might work...then there might as well be no crossplay since pc players will avoid all console players due to ping and console players avoiding pc players due to unfairness. Plus we all know there will just be tons of bugs too
---
Because in your suggestion the 2 man should suffer a Progression penalty. They'd just be dragging the other 2 people down
---
Just get good and remove your hit box. Lol
---
No, I disagree. If players are playing by themselves than they are obviously less coordinated. This can be a terrible thing. It will make killers seem better than they are due to the lack of information.
---
Do you happen to know what button that is for a controller?
---
+ Distressing
---
Obviously those are great changes, but I still think that either generator times should be increased or swf should be slightly nerfed in some way. Then the devs could nerf ruin and in turn less people would have to run it on their builds
---
It would be a penalty of 2.5%... that's barely a few extra seconds of generator time
---
This is disturbingly beautiful!
---
That's still a good chunk. A few seconds can mean life or death.
---
B for Xbox
---
Riiight...
---
It clearly is for some. I just don't understand how
---
And swf on coms can make them seem a lot better then they are due to an abundance of information.
---
He was defeated but not killed. He will always exist. I know in the movie it seemed like he died but if you go off the works of King you can see those "echoes"
---
Plauge docter with a plauge ability with cryogenic origens and a cane as his weapon would be soo cool
---
Why?
---
Calling himself a "Cunt" playing Toxic Nea, now that is wholesome!
---
'nerf' is defined as causing something to be more weak. It has no relation to whether or not it 'definitely should' or 'maybe should'.  
---
  
---
I wasn't being childish, I was being honest. It just makes you sound arrogant. Nobody asked for your rank, and being in reds doesnt mean youre more knowledgeable.
---
Likewise for survivor
---
They are planning on changing her soon - https://clips.twitch.tv/SoftArbitraryBobaLitFam
---
Dude me too
---
One stack of dying light is better then that, or one stack of thantophobia (no idea how to spell it).
---
You should've put insidous instead of shadowborn
---
You try and develop a game as complex as dead by daylight. See what happens :)
---
My point is that comments that amount to "yeah well other people do X" aren't constructive and come across more as petty one upping/attempted justification.
---
It's barely topic related and is more of a diversion.
---
As for being authoritarian - calm yer tits.
---
Hmm would definetly be in an interesting killer no doubt. I love how each one is an individual. Which makes me wanna play all of them.
---
He's a cutie, but that fuckin upload schedule huh:/?
---
Alright. Killer power time (building on your concepts)
---
Diver: 
---
Power name: Darkest Depths
---
Effects: gives the survivors a timer, after X amount of time their vision begins to "darken" where a thick black mist circles them and makes it impossible for them to see. Tiers up in 3 levels. When a survivor has tier 2-3 the killer can see them easier in the fog (line of sight aura reading) The survivors must find lanterns in random locations to "stave away the darkness" (they unhook the lantern and resets their darkness progress)
---
Scarecrow:
---
Power name: The Wandering Soul
---
Effects: the scarecrow can place up to X amount of faux bodies around the map. After performing a short channel, he can teleport to said bodies. Survivors can preform a channel "banishing" to get rid of the bodies he leaves.
---
The wanderer:
---
Power name: deathly asphyxiation
---
Effects: the wanderer naturally gives survivors the "asphyxiation" status effect, where once it reaches 100% they suffer from the broken status effect, and exhausted status effect. The wanderer inflicts this in 3 ways. 1. passively by terror radius, 2. By hitting survivors, 3. By using the active ability (think a cross between plague and doctor). Survivors can combat this by either performing a channel at one of 5 oxygen tanks, or naturally by not running or doing rushed actions.
---
The Exterminator:
---
Power name: sickly addiction
---
Effects: The exterminator has 2 forms. 1 is "purifier" the second is "infester". In purifier, he moves at 105%, and his active ability (M1) is "purge" in which he gasses. If he passes over any insect traps while purging, they are removed. If a survivor is hit with the gas, they are briefly slowed, disoriented, and exhausted. The gas also lingers for a brief period of time. In "infester" mode, the exterminator can place insect traps on windows, pallets and on/bellow drop downs. Should the survivor pass across this, they become "infested" and must clean themselves. If they don't, and are hit by the gas, they immediately go down.
---
 (Reason for a bit more of a departure here is because the other concept is trapper levels of potential feast of famine, and legion levels of unfun because if forces the players to loop one spot for fear of the nearby spots being infected. At least here, it gives a little counterplay)
---
Just my ideas for them.
---
With what some killer can do and what has been done to them (Iconic Trapper with hooks through him) do you think these puny humans can hurt them? Hag is literally desecrated and falling apart yet can carry Jane, David, Ash no problem.
---
The pallet is probably just a surprise reaction to being hit in the face with a pallet that the Entity most likely made to be really heavy.
---
I definitely don't have superiority complex, I just thought that people would take my point more seriously if I mentioned that I was high rank. Clearly I was wrong. No need for you to be so rude about it
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed a huge difference in huntress hitboxes since the last update. They were pretty bad already but now they just take the piss. I feel kinda bad when a hatchet hits the silhouette of where a survivor was a full second ago lol.
---
Corrupt intervention + discordance is good for protecting gens early game, and is more reliable than ruin.
---
teabagging and clicking flashlight are 100% bm. waiting for a hit isn't, but for the killer it can feel insulting.
---
The username even checks out.
---
It's two kicks on one end of the pallet to shatter the whole things. Nobody is doing that!
---
Isnt it a add on? Or am i missing something?
---
So, you're that no skill facecamping Bubba I met the other day. Hey friend, chill out it's just a game üëã
---
Bill with a medkit can't even do it. It's like he forgot.
---
So telling someone their opinion is wrong because of some arbitrary definition you made up is okay, but I was rude? Sounds good to me.  
---
And you can stop downvoting all my comments, I get that I hurt your feelings, my bad. People on reddit are usually okay when people are blunt with them. If you thought I was bad youre not going to like this sub.
---
I mean, It could be. Need a look at the direct points and such, but I could look into it.
---
adrenaline? lmfao you mean left behind B)
---
I rly hope the Archiv forces Survivor Mains to play games at red ranks :D
---
Grammar test for you.
---
Correct this sentence.
---
hint: Slugging is~~n't~~ good.
---
Good point. i was trying to say it didnt change according to region but that it was just about the update.
---
Yeah but you can usually get a pip or at least a good safety pip, and enough bloodpoints to feel you haven't completely wasted your offering/items. To each its own but I feel like long games are more enjoyable, even if you end up getting destroyed.
---
Repost!!!
---
I may have to play legion now just to use that sick cosmetic.
---
And he didn't even die in The Passing in L4D2... you just find his body.
---
Rly love the Archivs forcing Players to play both sides and see how it feels to be on the other side \^\^
---
As someone who plays both
---
#***F A C T S***
---
And I assume that means O for ps as well
---
it usually works interesting do you have any video of what happened so we can try and figure it out?
---
Or at least so we can report the bug?
---
Hag is unplayable on ps4 can‚Äôt speak for other platform users but it‚Äôs a slide show galore with Hag and her traps, your FPS tanks H A R D while setting up traps and freeze your frames for a split second.
---
Trust me I hate writing this because I spent 500k on her BW saving up her purples/ultras and right from the start just literally unplayable.
---
I‚Äôve wrote a million posts on the official forums asking for a fix and apparently I had to get in line as this is nothing new with her with other players which means no fix anytime soon.
---
I'm Steve and Nea (if my vision isnt failing me) in this situation.  Edit: I just noticed the Steve being the crying boy meme and nea being the cat meme
---
There's no challenge for looting 3 basement chests, just regular chests.
---
what
---
" Nothing better than seeing them instaleave after a round ends with zero kills for them " you have a problem
---
Not comparable but ok
---
I do have the video saved but i would need to upload it to youtube and edit it a little too. (And by that i mean cut to the point where the traps dont work.
---
From my experience is records the last hour or when u first start the app if u havent been playing for an hour.
---
Yes it is. And a goddamn awful one.
---
Just use headphones, I havent touched deerstalker since starting to use a headset
---
It costs nothing to be not nice too.
---
Scarred hand addon, it makes the hag phantasms have colision but u cant tp to them and u get 300% deviousness points.
---
It's like the Loch Ness Monster, or North Dakota!
---
Theres always 2 perks I want and can't get, and then they appear together in 1 bloodweb and you have to make the decision
---
They were free for a limited time
---
they are all glowing, even survivors one. But Jane overall costume isn't great. As you can see the bottom is quite lazily designed and the top isn't really sexy neither.
---
Im glad BHVR finally decided to buff piggy
---
*my cigarette!*
---
But you'd leave The Double Gay, is that worth the risk?
---
But will these be gone from the store or are they permanent now?
---
I like the idea of Bill getting flashbacks every now and then and yelling how horde is coming to other survivors while going gorilla on the killer.
---
If their still there then their permanent
---
You're not allowed to have any opinion on anything then unless you've done it. 
---
Try to be president see how it goes.
---
Try to fight a war see how it goes.
---
Can't critic a restaurant that gave you food poisoning unless you run one.
---
Can't even be upset if your toilet breaks unless you've built one.
---
Well, in German it says 3 chests in the basement. I now tried to search one in the basement and two anywhere else and I got the achievement. So it seems like just the description is false :)
---
K, thanks.
---
Gamer salute
---
I don't get her appeal tbh.
---
Basically just Scotland
---
Maybe if you try to actually fight with the killers the Entity comes in and does its endgame mori on you.
---
Honestly with how these matches have been going Left Behind would probably be more useful.  Does the hatch need to be open to show the aura?
---
Is Dan Schneider a dev?
---
I see, the way OP said i tought it was part of base power now
---
Thank you. :)
---
Me. I also remember when survivor lobbies used to be instant rather than 5 minutes.
---
Yes! I saw a kids movie he directed with my friends son and there was so much feet i was subjected to looking at during the duration of the movie, those poor kids after learning about his fetish üëÄ
---
Nice and clean
---
Oh okay, still sounds quite strong, if used properly, to me. Thanks for informing my lazy ass
---
Aces are either a fun guy that doesnt take the game too seriously and probaly uses a meme build or they are the most toxic pieces of shit.
---
In the description of kindred it states that it trumps all of the killers stealth abilities
---
The way I did it was, hook everyone 2 times, 99% as Myers, chase a single survivor for the rest of the game, once all the gens are done pop T3, down them, open the gate &amp; sacrifice.
---
Imagine being another survivor watching the killer tbag while looking directly at a hay bale
---
‚ÄúI wasnt camping I was pAtRoLlInG‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI didnt camp, I saw you going for the unhook‚Äù - Says the killer who only saw it because he wouldnt leave the hook
---
I want Ghostface to go "WAZUUUUUUUP" whenever he fully stalks somebody
---
yes, the game is easier for killers compared to before. but 'before' was absolute hell, and should by no means be the standard for how hard the game is for the killer.
---
I see more Legions in cosplay posts than playing the game
---
Sorry for the stupid question, i've never tried vpn, are they safe to use for games like dbd and not bannable?
---
Had that last one yesterday they were an awful killer and they did every toxic thing i can think of in the game. I'm talking facecamping, slugging, standing by the exit gate so nobody could crawl out, and they werent even good they only caught me because i got sandbagged by teammates. Fuck them indeed.
---
Bad Meme
---
My mind is so corrupetd that i tought the chest aura was actually some sort of sex toy
---
Crab walk to Gens
---
Do it only when you run out of every other thing you want to do, which will take awhile.
---
KYF desperately needs an update, the first being being able to load into a map on your own.
---
Some more options would be great, too. Set the number of generators and their repair times, how many chests spawn or how many gens need to be done for the hatch to spawn, or set the Entity blocker to a certain number of uses. The ability to toggle switching perks, items and add-ons during the match or giving Survivors infinite health or instant heals. Most people play KYF to practice looping or getting hits with mindgames -- I'd really rather not wait upwards of 30 seconds every time the person I'm practicing with needs to heal.
---
No toolbox just no mither and this is not happening but ye after match ended killer started yelling at me that im gen rusher and my team are also gen rushes because he had 2 hooks whole game.
---
You can use the putrid serum until the end of the rift in 60 days or so to get the Halloween cosmetics. After that you can only get them by using auric cells.
---
Yes and it‚Äôs so ficking obnoxious
---
The way I always did it was pressing SHARE twice to start recording at some point of my gameplay and then doing it again when I feel like I'm done recording anything remotely interresting.
---
It is a weird transition but trust me. You'll get used to it.
---
In other words people shouldn't speak about things they dont know about.. but they do and this has been the case since Aristotle... Or maybe dinosaurs
---
What a mood
---
Sadly always. Wait untill you get the Game twice in a row
---
For sure, I can't waif to see gold wind.

15*

Well i gave up on playing the game entirely for now while i as trying to get all basic killer perks (more bp) , before even thinking of going to survivors. At least you can already get those perks. I can play hag, and hag alone, every game, every day, or get crushed while playing no perk everything. And then there are rift challenges that require specific perks.... but no worries you can get them teachable in the shrine (still have to get lucky in the bloodweb!), with all the shards i dont have. Cause they too take time to grind. With Hag. Or getting crushed. Cause Hag is the only decently outfitted character i have (ruin and bbq from the shrine, and yes, noed, cause i have nothing better and i would need every point i can get, if id still bother to play).
---
That's still stupid. At least help out your team or do a gen or two before you leave.
---
Comrade m, yes emulate communist regimes that practice actual slavery to this day.
---
I don't think so since Bill is from another game I assume that the devs from dbd don't have the rights to change him
---
‚ÄúJuSt pReSsUrE GeNs‚Äù
---
Yeah some maps are too damn big and toolboxes are not needed in the game. If you see toolboxes bring Iri heads
---
100% this. There should be no claim of counterplay that relies on a perk or item. This game has become 100% killer balanced with every purple and pink item and add-on for survivors nerfed into the ground. You wonder why the lobbies take forever? It's because many survivors have quit this mess. Listen up BHVR. You need to nerf moris, these OP ultrarare addons for killers, and minimize the insta-down stuff. You've taken away our insta-heals, our insta-gen completions . . . at this point, there should be nothing that's insta.
---
Same but he has issues at home right now yah know :c

---
The *No Mither Man* gets facecamped for dragging his team down. The pressure I give up by staying near a hook for two minutes might make up for the pressure put on the Survivor team because someone ran No Mither.
---
It isn't. You dont have to use x perk to counter huntress, you don't have to use against freddy, you didn't even have to use anything vs old nurse. A perk is not counterplay, a specific strategy is counterplay
---
Exactly. I used it so many times
---
I'm sorry, but that was that survivors perk called "Decisive Strike". That's why she get out of his grasp. Not by flashlight. Sorry.
---
I suck at flashlight, these made me feel so powerful! xD
---
Willian from the Hills
---
Damn. Imma head out
---
sorry to break it to you but‚Äî actually never mind, well done you did great!
---
At least that would imply that the Chuckles name has progressed beyond the WIP stage
---
I miss moonlight offerings as well :(
---
A really boring build that people should be focused on but they‚Äôre too busy crying about spirit.
---
Id rather die fast than have my game drag out for 10 mins while I spend m1 holding a gen.
---
Nee freddy shouldnt even have gen slowdown add ons
---
Of course you did, it's so easier to use, the old lobby was made in such a way that you could basically go everywhere in the game without going back to the main menu.
---
Now that they removed this, it's not as much the case as it used to be.
---
DSüò©üò¢
---
I hope you are kidding
---
You can keep playing hag and also investing in other killers till they get competent enough
---
Gold?
---
Irony is the very same kind of SWFs are those who cry Iri Heads are so unfair.
---
I get why people don't like it and I very rarely use it myself, but I don't personally mind playing against it. I've had some very tense endgame moments against NOED that were a lot of fun. Wouldn't be wrong to nerf it somehow though.
---
Holding down the share button opens the share menu, from here you can select "save video clip".
---
You can also go into the PS4's settings to change how long you want these clips to be. 30 minutes is perfect for DBD. Then you can go into your capture gallery amd trim you clips before uploading.
---
More reps =  better item drops in blood web
---
same
---
The Claudettes are the Demogorgan
---
&gt;just not fun and frustrating to play against
---
You just said what feels like playing with a non top tier killer against a good 4man swf.
---
i play on xbox
---
Fact, but keeping stuff balanced is the main issue right? Because a swf can easily screw a killer over
---
The main problem with Spirit are Prayer Beads. They either need to be changed entirely or make it so they have some sort of downside like a a global sound cue for when she begins to phase like how Wraith has a global sound cue for when he enters/exits cloak. Also make the vacuum nosie while she's phasing directional again. I say again because funny enough it was directional when she first released, but then they buffed her so it wasn't. And that's about all I think they should do to Spirit. I think this hate boner for her mainly stems from survivor mains who never play killer, and not as much from the people who play both sides. As someone who once identified as a Spirit main, I am now a big brain Pig main, I don't nearly have as much trouble playing against Spirit as others seemingly do. I know her mindgames, and so playing against her is incredibly fun for me. It's all about being unpredictable and making her second guess every move you make. She indeed has a high learning curve for figuring out how to play against her, but it's not impossible. Tru3 is also a great source to learn Spirit counterplay. Watch some of his survivor videos of him playing against her. Also, didn't know where to fit this in, I'm pretty sure she does have environmental collision during phase walk as in grass, corn, etc. still moves even while she's phasing. If I'm wrong, which I'm pretty sure I'm not, then yeah they should change that.
---
I got Badham III 7 times in a row alternating between survivor and killer
---
As OhTofu and Scott Jund said, this isn't reliable. Plus, it doesn't work if she phases when you aren't looking at her (e.g. mid-chase).
---
These look awesome! Love the diver one. Also I've always thought there should be some sort of fire/arsonist killer in the game.
---
As a Myers main I congratulate you
---
Its the giant from last year
---
Thanks so much! I did scare a lot of people on Halloween haha
---
Reps?
---
Super super appreciate it. Thank you
---
Insults are toxic, personal insults are toxic..stop using this word for fucking everything

Just let the Killer know who's grouped with who, and give a stackable 25% BP boost for every Survivor in a group. A 2-man gives you 50% more, and a 4-man is double BP - on top of any offerings or BBQ.
---
No need to nerf people who want to play with friends.
---
Lol my Queue Times are rather Quick
---
*prestiges sorry I play a lot of for honor lately
---
if they drop their items that means its a friendly thing
---
also some just play together for fun, when i play with friends we don't work really hard together we just play and talk a bit. Sure it still has a couple advantages but the biggest one for me is knowing how good at least one other player is. One of my friends is a baby meg so it's going to take a long time before we even could do any of the stuff that high rank SWF do anyway(which i think is kind of toxic bc it definitely exploits the ability to play with friends to have an advantage over just having fun together)
---
For me its killer that takes 5 minutes and survivor that's instant (I play on Xbox One)
---
Thank you guys for the support! You can check  out the couple more pics on my insta. I'm sorry I don't have a ton. Literally finished it right before we went out. And I have to order another set of uv white contacts before I take more pics. If u look closely the eye fasteners are just those white teeth flosser things that I've painted.

---
The only time I've done this was when a fellow survivor was trolling by body blocking the gate switch. Me and the other survivors were trying to get her to move but she just kept tea bagging, so I knocked over a pallet and ran for the other gate. It worked.
---
The last set of challenges only has "Master" challenges which all give 5 shards each
---
Wow, pro gamer and karma move, good work
---
"Girl, you're thicker than a bowl of oatmeal"
---
the usual idiotic content bhvr release
---
they will ruin the game with those stupid challenges
---
Easy for some, a nightmare for others
---
I would pay good money to run around with a mullet.
---
Everyone wins.
---
without using any perks lol
---
There should be some kind of limit on resources available in game.
---
Why not
---
A few people suggested something similar. Sounds like a good idea
---
Thanks. it was all I could think to do. Seeing she got hooked as the rest of us got away felt good, man.....
---
Deus Vult
---
First comment ever!
---
People would have finished all tomes if it worked like that. Tome 4 isn‚Äôt even that bad
---
No, the level II will come the 5th, this tuesday.
---
Director is a pedophile and the devs have already said they arent going to add him
---
ay now they match with jeff!
---
The three killers I see people cosplay the most is legion at number on, ghotface at number two and then huntress. Very rarely do I see spirit or wraith
---
This is so true lol People don‚Äôt understand 
---
If survivors consider SELF CARE too slow, they damn sure aren‚Äôt gonna waste time doing dull totems
---
Did they give a reason for locking the levels behind dates?
---
But, seriously who uses them for distraction
---
She‚Äôs always had choppy frames with traps with setting up/and after she teleports the frames dip, the latest patch seems to have added more slog to her though, I was able to play her somewhat in August but lately....I DC‚Äôd from a Hag game with mint rag/shackles and the first trap I set was a slide show...insta DC never been so disgusted with choppy frames before.
---
We don‚Äôt need 3 survivors for 1 DLC
---
I know, just a suggestion tho
---
If I need to distract the killer I'll just rush a vault, not waste a pallet.
---
How about no?
---
We don't need 3 survivors, and in my vision Jonathan is a better survivor than billy because he been "possesed*"
---
When I first got the game, for the first month or so killer queues were instant for me, while survivor queues took like ten minutes. Nowadays, I get survivor games in less than a minute, while Killer games I have to be patient and wait five minutes for.
---
Good idea
---
Different kinds of people, if i get bm'ed one game, ill be a complete bastard - slug camp tunnel anything as long as its efficient and helps me win, after that, I revert to casual gameplay once more. It's an infinite cycle really.
---
It still is on ps4.
---
The key words I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a direct link. Like there are many unreleased characters let‚Äôs say. We know of them and some even have pictures but we haven‚Äôt got them
---
Yeah i would go out half naked only with bandages covering me with blue paint on my body
---
No worries. Just thought I‚Äôd clarify to people, in case they had Switch and what not and got confused.
---
Okay so be open to other people‚Äôs opinions
---
I think it has to do something with the queueing &amp; the SWF integration, but I hope they‚Äôll manage to find a solution
---
*incohrent screeching*
---
O
---
What happen
---
I didn‚Äôt hear of this
---
And when killer mains finally are forced to play survivor and get tunneled/camped.
---
Gold? Really? xD
---
Thanks!
---
Well, yeah
---
Yeah I was looking for an option like this when I first started playing. Overwatch has something like this with the test range. I'd love an area with maybe some target dummies for killers and some generators with skill checks for survivors, just to try things out. Just learning how to move with a new killer can be really challenging, and kind of humiliating in a live game. See me: Hillbilly chainsaw sprinting into trees, nurse blinking past survivors, Demogorgon shredding into walls because I don't have a feel for how far or fast these things go yet... I'd love an empty map to just... test drive some before I'm getting endlessly teabagged.
---
You‚Äôll leave the match straight though. Welcome to a world of non-vintage misfiting T-shirt‚Äôs, shitty beer and calling everyone ‚Äúbruh‚Äù
---
People don't need more incentive to sweat in a casual game.
---
Frank is now officially sans but cooler
---
Counter play be like:
---
Not all survive with friends are good, some people just play and chill. Like I went against a SWF yesterday as a lvl 5 Freddy with 2 perks brutal and enduring, 4k‚Äôd with 3gens left and they got 2 pallet stun saves. This is full load out red ranks, but they need a nerf!!???? smh dude learn that some people are just having fun, if you don‚Äôt want SWFs The game will die
---
I think it‚Äôs still valuable to repair the same generators as teammates as you have a greater chance of finishing without being interrupted by the killer, and just getting a generator out of the way at the beginning can be a huge momentum gain.
---
That being said, if the killer is running the most ubiquitous perk in the game Hex:Ruin, you best believe I‚Äôm going solo on gens.
---
To be honest I would be down to farm!
---
no clue I never play demo or huntress, I totally agree that looks wrong. I really want to try that out.
---
Damn I really like this!
---
That too!
---
I cant remember the exact source but it was on the dbd forums, few people debating whether theyd add him then not_queen came and said they're not planning on getting their license any time soon
---
I ain't gonna do crap, but good luck
---
This also works when the demogorgan pounces at him
---
the objective is to survive so therefore cleasining dull totems in case of noed is technically an objective because it increases the chances of surviving
---
Very nice. Lol you should add some entity spider limbs to your nea cosplay.
---
Like how you guys are posing, spot on
---
Damn people have no appreciation for the amount of work the devs do. All they care about is a little error. Get a life man
---
You're completely right. The terms I'm careful to use and define are "proxy" and "face" camping. Face camping is when:
---
* The Killer isn't moving.
---
* Their stain is either directly on or extremely close to the hook.
---
* If you try to rescue, you can clearly hear their heartbeat just not moving at all, like a constant radius, because again, they're not moving and just staring.
---
Proxy camping isn't really camping. You're walking around, watching the hook, but the survivors still have a solid chance to rescue and they won't get downed immediately (but still might after a bit of chasing).
---
I have seen weird in-betweens, where the Killer is hovering but still staying too close to allow a safe rescue. This is when Borrowed Time or a distraction is almost necessary to rescue (though once a Freddy was doing this and he ignores BT...). I consider it camping but not as heinous as face camping (where even distractions don't pull the killer away).
---
Itsa mori!
---
 It‚Äôs coming close to end of reset and you‚Äôre only rank 17, there are hardly any players at that rank. So you‚Äôre gonna have to wait a while
---
Hey im new to the game only 2 months is there a bloodhunt every month?
---
You tell people to comment why they disagree, then argue that their opinion is invalid because they aren‚Äôt red rank killer. lmao
---
I remember when you had to mash find lobby cause the game would constantly pop up disconnect messages
---
Fuck that would be awesome tho
---
I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking at
---
They literally have it liscensed to Sega lmao, plus Disney is a fucking money hound. Why wouldn't they do something that'd make them some money? Cause BHVR would have to pay for the liscense, then give Disney a cut of the profit from the DLC and any cosmetics.

---
Its a sideways Huntress with a goat skull
---
I agree. But the amount of bloodpoints given for what the task is feels really small to me. Am I the only one?
---
This is what I call "proxy" camping. This is barely camping and is completely okay. The rule of thumb is, can they rescue without getting immediately downed? If it takes you a bit of chase to get one of the survivors, you're only proxy-ing and you're completely in the right.
---
What's bad is just standing there, staring at the survivor, not moving. That's face camping. You'll know you're in the wrong if you do this.
---
What you're doing is completely fine and a valid strategy. Good luck!
---
I'm just sitting here waiting for them to blame the PS Network again... like they did a few days ago when PC was also having troubles! Becasue we all know Steam piggybacks on PS Network right? RIGHT?
---
Why are you booing him? He‚Äôs right!
---
Yeah. It's big brain time
---
You know the messed up part ? 
---
Some people would never click that button :(
---
They still wouldn't. Except for this rift thing
---
Sloppy can be substituted with Pop as well
---
That's the problem. It is a perk which gives you basically free Kills in the endgame. Even though it is only during the endgame, I still think that a perk shouldn't give you free Kills if you failed to complete your objective as killer.
---
This killer messaged me a day ago because I didn‚Äôt let him mori me and I reported him as a joke and today he spam messaged me thinking it was going to annoy me but I put on do not disturb
---
It is way smarted to kill yourself on the hook actually
---
When do they intend to open the second volume?
---
Were you the Demogorgon we faced? On the corn map?
---
... or you could have essentially made their flashlights useless by using Lightborn. Or baited the survivors, slugged them, look at wall, fake pick up and get free hit, make them waste pallets in that area etc. Flashlights are nowhere as near as good as they used to be and the only time a good killer will be flashed is at pallets/windows which isn't even worth flashing at. Flashlights are easily avoidable now. Instant flashlights are gone. Pickup time has considerably decreased.
---
I wasnt sure
---
This tuesday.
---
If anyone thinks the are balanced for real they need to fleet the game
---
You can submit a support ticket and attach the video to that to at least make the devs aware
---
Yeah I know. Doesn't change anything though.
---
Also survivor mains: hmmmm. I think I will take... Iridescent Heads! And... a purple belt! Huntress is SOOOO HARD, that's the only way to do my ritual.
---
I always played both sides, When I get face camped and my teammates dont do gens I get mad, but when all the gens are done and the killer camps, I understand that pain
---
Same thing has been happening to me
---
&gt;You cant actually do shit with it without spending real money. Great useless event.
---
not all the time but it still help with repairs, you just add it on to the mix
---
Wow we‚Äôve never seen this before
---
No0b3 will have no trouble there
---
You get serum in the free side of the rift too...
---
Its an addon, that make her phasing silence.
---
Well it helps everyone will be on the same tome. Since killers will go for noed end game collapse plays survivors can get the multiunhooks
---
yeah that true and idk y people still run ruin the way totems spawn these day pffft I can see that only for the low ranks but for people who deal with it all day in the higher ranks I dont see it standing long
---
Well dbd calls Steve's hair "a feathered mullet" so you already can.
---
if you are in her terror radius you won't hear the sound
---
That deal with Sega was before the merger, so it was technically Fox that allowed that. Also Disney is extremely anal about any licenses they give out. I really doubt it would work in this game anyhow.
---
Yea I can pretty much see this! 
---
Though green ranks are best ranks &lt;3
---
No it isnt prayer beads. Read what i said and not just the title
---
I miss old Freddy, I made my main build around slowdown perks and addons, and oooooh  boy did some matches last for a while. Longest was 45 minutes.
---
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!
---
Yea at least South Dakota has Wall Drug!
---
I call pedo
---
I only use pallet distractions if it's Nurse or it's an extremely bad pallet like the one downstairs in the temple next to the gen.
---
Then they did a pretty good job so far.
---
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (steves cry makes me laugh every time)
---
But the liscenses are still out, Disney never changed them. We're getting an Alien Isolation 2 RIGHT NOW and not to mention that Predator game that's also coming out (Which is also being made by something not owned by Disney). They're definitely open to liscening out their properties as long as there's money to be made.
---
Why especially nurse?
---
damn those GeN rUsHeRs
---
That's fair
---
Which mask is that? The one from tier 23 of the rift?
---
yeah, mostly main killer only making an excuse for it. but hey, they dont need making excuse, just play poorly and proud of it. nothing change the fact anyway. im play both side btw, mostly getting 2-4 kill without camping, proxy camping, tunnel. doing gen presure much fun to play than waiting survivor to show up at hook. more feel like hunter when i was the hunting not camping.
---
I usually get hate because I‚Äôm on my streak of trying to get rid of my 100+ red heads pinky finger add-ons
---
I wish I could give you gold.
---
THAT DAMN SPACEMAN TAKING ALL MY PERKS
---
And A for Switch
---
yup do this
---
Iron Grasp isn't too necessary considering hook placement 90% of the time, also NOED is kinda redundant on Billy and I'd replace that one for BBQ when you get it.
---
I have found you
---
Pallets aren't really useful against the Nurse and if you make her waste time finding you without her succeeding it's a big time boost.
---
If survs tbag I tbag back, this is why I play ghosty to make it perfectly balanced as all things should be. Also because it's funny :p
---
True
---
No please don‚Äôt report again I‚Äôm a changed man
---
Wait? Is that really a thing?
---
Haha it‚Äôs all good i kind of expected it tbh lol sometimes the arrangement is just the arrangement and nothing more, i did get to play dbd while i was there which was a good comfort to last 3 weeks from home üòÖ

Yeah, most swfs are just playing with friends trying to have fun, Only one in a thousand, like that one swf i got in haddonfield back when insta heals were better then they are now
---
&gt;where he takes the survivors breath of air and they need to 'breathe' instead of mend.
---
What if it also removed their sense of sound so they can't hear killer heartbeat? Seems like space wouldn't be allowing you to hear stuff
---
Yes. If she has perks to increase her terror radius, or she simply is close enough, the husk she leaves behind while phase-walking has its own terror radius. While you are inside of this radius, you cannot hear the woosh.
---

DBD isn't a worldwide phenomenon with a long and easy track record of ticket, toy and merchandise sales. Marvel already has the high ground on that, regardless of controversy or distrust.
---
Well as survivor you would know the killer‚Äôs perks and as killer you would know the survivor‚Äôs perks. Also, they might play the same killer and you know their playstyle, so it would be pretty boring. I don‚Äôt like facing the same player constantly cause after a while there‚Äôs nothing new happening.

I personally find teabagging hilarious as Killer.

The narrator was told he can go home early once he finishes reading the story

It's just a Dead by Daylight joke that people do. Doesn't instantly mean that someone's gay. No need to get all serious about sexual orientations just because of a meme.
---
The omly problem for me now is because a lot more people are playing killer my queue time jumped from 3 or 5 to 30 to 40 min waits
---
Thing is, if you're a good killer this won't happen. Killers have a lot of tools at their disposal now more than ever to get kills, where survivors are getting nerfed in one way or another every patch.
---
The visual and audio effects play more often (In a 8 seconds interval) with the tier 1 Discordance.
---
In tier 3, the interval is every 12 seconds.
---
And what about the SWF chat?

Lightborn is such a hard counter to this I fully expect some angry, angry people to emerge.
---
Opposite for me. As a survivor I‚Äôll get in a match literally seconds after making ready but if I play as a killer is always a few minutes
---
I guess so. It would be eerie seeing that with dead silence too :s
---
I don't belive those are the actual challengers. They could just be placeholders to protect the actual challenges from being leaked
---
With survivor's heads xD
---
And that's how it's supposed to be! Thank god someone gets it. People are gonna do what they want to do. no matter how much other people are gonna whine about how they shouldn't of died or should of got the kill. People just need to learn to take the L and move on.
---
And add-ons can change the sounds as well haha.
---
Respect.
---
As a rank 3 survivor and a rank 20 killer it feels really bad that I have to let people escape every match because rank reset is a thing
---
He Drops you and then you die
---
They drop you and the entity gets you.
---
I like that Idea I dont really play ghost face but you seem to be one of the few killers who overcam tbagging good shit man!
---
Jesus fuck I was expecting him to actually creep up on you.
---
Fits Amanda‚Äôs character perfectly lol
---
Yeah it's sad to see such an animation break someones heart xD but it happens
---
Its even worse wen you get 2 toxic messages
---

---
Thanks bro! It was a lot of fun
---
Thats wack :\
---
That's dissapointing
---
You forgot while never breaking a chase
---
I fail to see the problem?
---
They are aware
---
Annoying, maybe ‚Äî that's subjective. Shit? Have you seen him run killers? Also if you watch the VOD again you will see that he said he actually wanted to try and get out the normal way but the others asked him to be "super sweaty" and dc because apparently someone in the commentator team said they were memeing too much and should be more sweaty. But yeah, let's hop onto the hate Pug circlejerk bandwagon because it's "cool" instead of forming your own opinion based on the facts displayed in the VOD.
---
Fair and balanced id say
---
Look perfectly fine to me? What is the issue?
---
Rank 17 was probably SWF with one of the other two and the other two are perfectly matched against that killer, just like you.
---
You were probably on the edge of her terror radius so there's a very faint heartbeat. You need to be outside of 24m when she starts phasing to hear the phasing sound.
---
Dont do that you will be charged with heresy
---
Op was just inside the terror radius. It‚Äôs always been a thing
---
Yes indeed Freddy is top tier for me he‚Äôs just annoying to play against
---
Very true. Had a game yesterday as Freddy. Didn't use the huge slowdown add-ons, didn't camp, didn't tunnel. I didn't even slug for 4 man so the last guy could escape through hatch since he was decent I thought he deserved to. In the end he still complained what a boring playstyle my freddy was because of having sloppy and thana. 
---
I blocked him on steam so next time I know to bring a mori for him. 
---
People only appreciate you giving them a chance if you slug for 4 man, get them all and then give the last guy hatch. That's the only time survivors escaping from a normal match never flame because only in that case do they realize you decided to let them go and it wasn't their 'amazing plays'.
---
That better be sarcastic because that was the literal worst game ive ever had
---
Where‚Äôs the fisherman from IKWYDLS
---
they just have a better gaming chair
---
its a bug, it looks normal if you queue as a SWF
---
Just vaguely she reminded me of Carmen Miranda.
---
Isnt it supposed to be the opposite? If its a giant map and they split your'e gonna have a bad time?
---
&gt;That better be sarcastic because that was the literal worst game ive ever had
---
Well, this is how the matchmaking works and yours was within the expected parameters. Which is why I fail to see the problem you are trying to report.
---
Should have played on the swamp. 2 times on the ship and i was done :D
---
You know, this doesn‚Äôt explicitly say you have to get the save. If you blind the killer early it still counts as a blind but not a save. Maybe that will count?
---
This only happens when you play solo, idk why.
---
Iron Will is a lot more useful than people give it credit for. Easily worth trading out self care.
---
Nice theory! Yea it is super weird that my game keep showing me the challenges when entering the Archives
---
"Wow, this killer has laser eyes that instantly kill everyone in the match as soon as it begins! Doesn't seem fair, but I don't main killer, so I guess what the fuck would I know?"
---
I see the problem. I feel for you buddy!
---
The matchmaking is the problem, isnt it supposed to match the best survivor with an equal killer, that rank 1 means they should have a rank 1 killer not obliteraing a rank 8
---
It can work on spirit if you drop it without vaulting it.
---
No I am complex, I see a four legged mammal inside a  utility to block out sun
---
We need a perk that makes blood not to drip firstly for fighting spirit
---
Random Doctor questions if anyone's still here. The wiki couldn't help me on these.
---
Can you gen grab people in treatment mode?
---
If you're using Iridescent King and you apply Iridescent Calm on someone, does that last forever? If you keep zapping them, is the effect replaced or are new effects just added?
---
If someone is effected by Iridescent Calm, do they get Agitation effects? Or is it not considered terror radius?
---
Is there any way to tell when Iridescent Calm has applied to someone? Or do you just have to keep zapping them and hope?
---
(For context- I haven't bought doctor yet and am working on an idea for a treatment-only doctor)
---
&gt;The matchmaking is the problem, isnt it supposed to match the best survivor with an equal killer, that rank 1 means they should have a rank 1 killer not obliteraing a rank 8
---
No? Perhaps try to do some research before making a thread complaining about a non existent problem? 
---
Current matchmaking is supposed to look for players 6 ranks above or below yours but this could also expand to other ranks if the queue is taking too long.
---
That rank 1 was probably rank 2 when he searched for a match, putting him exactly 6 ranks above yours. Your matchmaking was perfect.
---
I'm one of those killer mains that adopted spirit as mymain when she was revealed, before we even knew her power. I'll stick with my girl through thick and thin! Now i can hopefully play the game without ppl getting mad at me just for playing who i want :(
---
2 keys?
---
What did they say?
---
Yeah this happend last night for me. I knew she didn't have prayer beads because I heard her phase before. But while on a gen she just popped up behind me.
---
These are all console problems, every person I've seen complain about it is on console.
---
I gotchu homie
---
I like this idea! It adds that little bit more to every match.
---
Well, last night I incorporated it into my Ghostface set up and I have to say, it really helped.
---
yes! same for ps4 (not sure about the endurance thing). One survivor had permanent 150% speed with 0 exhaustion perks after a regular hit.
---
Being over a month away, I will be really surprised if Tome IV goes live as it is.
---
Lol I got to Rank 1 with her beach when she got first released aka back when she was pretty bad.
---
No probs. Can confirm &gt; Blight Points dont apply.

Idk how me saying what I said indicated I never get salty, but just to clear up your dumbass assumptions. I get salty over stupid shit/BS or maybe if I feel like shit is unfair. Might even get salty if I was performing really well and my team wasnt, OR EVEN If I do well but mess up at the very end. In matter of fact your dumbass got me salty right now for assuming such stupidness. With all that being said a petty little animation or someones intentions of BMing me will NEVER get me salty. stupid fuck..
---
Blight Points dont Apply.
---
Well, it seems like it would just involve a little more time put in. Personally I'm not looking forward to sacrificing all survivors in the basement in one match
---
I really hope it doesn't go live as it is
---
I honestly wouldn't get too bothered with it. If people actually have a personality like that then they are clearly the loser in life
---
People have been saying the game is on the verge of dying its entire existence lol
---
I don't gen tap and I commit to the repairs, but hitting great skill checks with a low end PC (15/20fps) is absurdly hard and gen tap is a band-aid solution.
---
That skirt has atrocious clipping. I bought the skirt just to wear it with that top and it is one of the worst cosmetics in terms of clipping I've bought in this game.
---
this is intended, only basic attacks are supposed to trigger sloppy butcher
---
well the killer definitely doesn‚Äôt like to
---
yea, how would you know they're playing survive with friends.
---
I dont have friends
---
Usually they get downvoted and criticized so I would imagine the ones that noticed this trend are super hype to make a thought out discussion about balance, perk ideas, game health etc
---
Probably because 90% of the discussions are dead horses already. NOED, Ruin, controversial mechanics / perks. 
---
Just use the search bar and you'll find most of the discussions you are looking for.
---
I didn't test it bit i think this is a buff to Rancor as well
---
Ok thx
---
Hear me out here... Jesse Walsh.
---
I think that could be done with trapper , would take time but I believe is possible , the one that I find hard is sacrificing 3 people in end game.
---
I wear that cosmetic all the time and I'd love to see Jack the Ripper
---
not worth it
---
They used to be instant way back in the day, before any real semblance of matchmaking existed. Me personally? I'm fine with a few (like up to 5 minutes in some instances) minutes queue time if it makes it overall a more fair match for everyone, but bring back the quick play option as an unranked option as well. Make it function so they just throw the next 5 people who queue up into it into a match, regardless of ranks.
---
Its easy get the first one tbh,but after you get,the killer will be smarter about it,so I think the second one its gonna be hard as hell,maybe rank reset will be the way
---
One of the reasons for this might be that many players are under age and find the struggle of realizing that this game isn't meant to be balanced or that no-one is entitled to 'win' at it even harder.
---
I also wanna know which u guys think. My current escape build is head on, inner strength, lightweight and quick and quiet. Hide in lockers quick n untraceable, heal to full health in 8 seconds and 3 seconds to stun in case killer finds out
---
What does BM mean? It's been months and i never found the meaning of the acronym
---
Yeah I think a Victorian Slasher should have a Power named ‚ÄúNight Shroud‚Äù. Sadly that‚Äôs already taken
---
Bruh, you need to get off that high horse. There isn't enough oxygen for your brain up there.
---
I always run option 1. That's my favorite build. I call it the "Now you see me, now you don't" build.
---
I think bubba would be easier
---
 Candy Myers
---
Probably because there's not a whole lot to discuss.
---
‚úã
---
Another person in South America! I was wondering if there were different servers and if we can choose which server we want to play on (probably can't choose I'm guessing). I literally just started playing this game so still trying to figure out the matchmaking/friends situation.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even consider to prestige Steve. Why would I give up Scoops Ahoy?
---
Most underrated perk, imo. I never see anyone use it, and that perk is just such a game changer.
---
Iirc, one of the reasons they do it this way was to prevent the multiple killers in a game bug.
---
&gt; especially the subs
---
I see you're a man of culture as well...
---
It would be nice, but it's probably pretty low priority because most of them are easy to remember how many you've done.
---
Please, please, PLEASE do not let BHVR add more gen speed perks. It might sound like a good idea when you're thinking about yourself, but when there's four survivors all running four gen speed perks each, killers won't stand a chance.
---
I was wondering why I couldn't find it, didn't know if they removed it or if I was having an aneurysm
---
I wonder if you're the Hillbilly that I DS'd+Head On as Dwight on Swamp map around the time you posted this.
---
Game glitched out as i finished the last of the first tomb now i can see the last one, only view not claim. The challenges are insane.
---
Some of the other challenges:
---
Unhook 4 survivors during the endgame collapse (All in 1 trail)
---
Completely repair 4 gens while using dark sense (All in 1 trial, start to finish, no half gens)
---
The rest are relatively hard but not impossible, just those two and the NOED one have ridiculous requirements.
---
hahaha, there's no way. Every minute, 2 or 3 posts whith the exact though. I'm i the only one?
---
Would be better if it were just in multiple matches.
---
Start playing Spirit
---
Fake pick up means, look as if you're going to pick the survivor up. Walk over them, look the opposite direction to where the other survivors are coming from, stand still for half a second or less, then quickly turn around and you can bait the flashers out in the open and get a free hit. Or make them waste pallets.
---
50/50 mains rise up
---
Omg yes. They are clearly having issues. This sucks!
---
I suspect it was too stop the multiple killers in a game glitch. It is done by a survivor switching to killer at the last second. Rather than fix it they prevented it unless you're in a KYF group. But this is just speculation.
---
Playing solo on red ranks... well, good luck to people trying to get it. Even if you're lucky getting 1, there's no chance a red rank killer gets flashlighted twice.
---
Self care is a trap. Don‚Äôt run it. Swap in a killer detection perk like spine chill.
---
Q√•
---
This. I play Spirit, but not because she's top tier. I suck too much to use her that effectively. I just think she's neat.
---
It's not a downward spiral at all. I dont get bothered by the tactics or actions of the other people in the game. I play my way, have fun and move on to the next without any salt.
---
I treat it like a sign for camping cause I know that's how it always was. But people now tend to also use it as a sign to come get me so it's almost lost its meaning, now it's a gamble if they're saying they're being camped or if they're telling you it's safe to get them.
---
You too?! Damn and I thought I was the only special person blessed by the entity with this ‚Äúleak‚Äù
---
From what I‚Äôve seen recently killers are either determined to camp/tunnel someone out if the game OR, they will trade to avoid DS but another survivor has to sacrifice themself to allow the unhook.
---
I.e killer will wait around the hook, get a hit on an incoming survivor then down that survivor as they unhook. Some killers just expect a free hook to be handed to them like that in exchange for the unhook.
---
Unsurprisingly, all killers that play like this run NOED. Often Ruin on top too to buy more camping time.
---
I did this yesterday. Really all you need to do is these three things:
---
1- gather some friends and do a custom game practicing flash light blinding pickups
---
2- calm down and remember later is better than earlier
---
3- remember that hag has a built in light born because of her fucked up hitbox and you will never be able to blind her ever because APPARENTLY BEING A SAGGY TIT LADY WHOS OLD AND WRINKLY MAKES YOU INVINCIBLE TO MY FLASHLIGHT SO I GUESS ILL JUST GO FUCK MY SELF. God dang this has given me an anger boner
---
While Archive nodes are causing people to play weirdly to get the challenges (i.e. "it's fine if I die but I MUST search this chest" and yes I was guilty of this), they are also encouraging a lot of people to go out of their comfort zone, so I really think the Archives are overall a great idea.
---
Yep, I have a 1060 and an I7 and my fps drops to like 20 when the trap activates. God forbid that more than 3 activate.
---
not a new survivor but is the skillcheck simulator accurate? it looks like it's way off for me, could it be a pc issue on running my game?
---
THIS ^(I suck at looping Spirit but I'll pretend I know exactly how it feels)
---
Blood warden
---
Ggez baby Kate
---
How about a fucking stupid troll or I might be sarcastic but take it however you want! idc xD
---
Whose perk is that again?
---
Deal with what? The Survivors escaping? Level up some other Killers for better perks, watch some videos on your favourite Killer to get tips on how to play them.
---
Or I guess downvote me for giving advice, like you asked.
---
But there is a major difference between something obvious like that and survivor mains trying to get a killer nerfed/killer mains trying to get a survivor perk nerfed/etc.
---
It's not worth it unless you like grinding. Although if you want the cosmetics I'd suggest maxing out your blood points at 1 million and than prestige.
---
Oh yeah, I totally want more homophobic memes.
---
I was so used to this being a photo, I got so confused when it started to zoom in lmao
---
In my dreams, there is only a single thing that I see...
---
**The Survivor to Killer/Killer to Survivor button.**
---
&gt;Id rather wait than play that match
---
Good for you, 8 out of 10 players wouldn't. See the problem?

It‚Äôs pretty accurate.
---
Oh I have. Killers with insta downs, aura reading abilities/perks. Huge map control. Check the patch notes for the past idk, 4 or 5 patches. No survivor buffs
---
DBD reddit and forums a few months from now ‚ÄúWhy do I face Billy every game???‚Äù
---
People in any game will always opt for the most powerful build. Its why you always see a variation of the same 6-8 survivor perks all the time.
---
Maybe nerfing the top killers wouldnt be as bad if they buffed the shit killers but they never do. When you go against a 2000 hour each swf kitted out with toolboxes and they pick the map too, you arent winning those games with a low tier killer. Not without a mori....which they also want nerfed.
---
That's what Discord is for lmao
---
Close your eyes.
---
They could've just greyed the button if another survivor joined or acted like the player was swapping lobby if playing killer so you can't both do it
---
Of course you have to, that's the same point of high skilled killers ending a game before a single gen was poped, there's no challange, you just made 4 person not enjoy playing
---
Ah, yes. That‚Äôs what I thought.
---
Ahh lol so yea sarcasm üòÑ *phew*. With all these online boys nowadays leaving so many hateful comments i cant tell anymore you see.
---
Honestly a very good movie. I'll admit, the designs of the killers aren't that creative but it's a very good movie with a surprisingly interesting plot for a home invasion horror movie.
---
Well my problem with Art the Clown isn't that it would be a hard character to think of powers and perks for but rather the fact that the film itself a lot more graphic then most of the movies they had down before, hell out of all the movies on this list it is perhaps the most graphic out them all, which is why I think BVHR wouldn't do it. Because the film itself is too much for them to include in a game that they wouldn't be able to properly reflect that in Arnie's character.
---
For the Blind Man, I just said that a blind killer would be interesting and that alone would be interesting enough that they wouldn't need a movie tie in to make people excited or intrigued by it. So either way I for it.
---
Well that is one of the reasons why I can't see Sam in the game, he does have a wide range of powers that it is also the same way for Pennywise or Leprechaun: they have a large assortment of powers that sticking to one to revolve around can be kinda hard. Also Sam, for most of the film, was mostly an observer and only attacked someone in the last part of the film and it was because the old man didn't respect the traditions of Halloween and even then he didn't kill the guy. Which is why I said he might be better off as a feature in certain maps or in a Halloween event.
---
The balloon thing could be interesting but as stated I just can't really picture a power for him in the game but I don't mind him in the game. Though personally if I had to pick between Pennywise or Jack I would go with Jack because of my own biases and the fact that it would probably be easier to come up with a playstyle for Jack then Pennywise.
---
I could see Norman working similar to Ghostface where he spends most of the match without a terror radius or anything alarming but he also can't attack them while in this state and to make up for it he can sabotage generators to set off or hide in lockers and while he does he 'stalks' survivors till 'Mother' takes over making him a screaming violent madman chasing after people with a knife while the 'Pyscho' score blares. If done right the whole normal and harmless look about him would be what makes him disturbing like in the original film but in truth, he's not in my personal most wanted so I can take him or leave him.  
---
Well either works, just her having that sound would make that character so much stressful to play against and the fact that it is so iconic and recognizable is too good for it not to be in the game if she ever shows up.
---
They probably wouldn't add this as it would be super easy to farm if they did
---
I'm literally interested in the lore. I love reading and am seriously impressed with the writing quality and quantity whenever a new character is released. Even The Demogorgon's backstory, which is so short it doesn't even have a scroll bar, is written amazingly. But these Tomes are a serious step down in quality and it's very apparent. I want the writers to really take their time with these lore bits because they've proven they can write well, but didn't for these Memories.
---
What trapper‚Äôs traps should actually be.
---
I like the hard challenges its going to take my a lot of games do this
---
Purchase the DLC as a whole, as opposed to the characters separately.
---
I'm a 50/50 main. I used NOED often starting out as killer, but then stopped when I realized there were better perks to use. I'm definitely not using it after seeing what it does to low ranks.
---
I literally just hit green rank as survivor and got matched with three newbies. I accepted the responsibility of getting them out alive, and we had no deaths and got the gens done when NOED happened. The totem was near a gate, too, so he was able to hover and keep pressure on both the gate and the totem, and the three potatoes kept trying to save each other while I was just trying to get NOED out of the way. In the end, only two of us survived.
---
NOED is fair, I'm not saying it's toxic at all. I just wish it wasn't so effective at completely tipping the balance of the game from near-victory for the survivors to a 3 or 4K for the killer.
---
Platinum isn't hard at rank 20 lmao, can't believe this dude
---
IF you can. 
---
This is fully possible in SWF when you have coms and that is the plan of the entire team and no one does a gen unless you are on it, but if you are solo, all it would take is 2 people touching a gen you are not on. That is it. A gen tap on 2 gens by some rando and the challenge is gone.
---
He already got the plat trophy
---
Are you sure?
---
If I recall correctly it goes up by only +0.5% for each prestige (so -1.5% of chance to find brown addons at p3) 
---
it truly is only worth if you have all other characters leveled or want the bloody clothes
---
Also, try to do it only on double bloodpoints events if you want to do it
---
You can just blind the killer while in the animation and this will probably count. No need to do a flashlight save.
---
To be honest the only Killer you could've afforded to do that with is Nurse. But since the rework cucked her mobillity and up-time pretty well, even good Nurse's might need Ruin aswell.
---
:I hate this:
---
Autopsy says he disconnected, tell the media it was a suicide
---
Ya I'm just meaning hes acting like it means hes good but when I got it I barely knew how to play as killer lol
---
just give me a skill check training and il be happy console player like me despartely need it with the low frames on the skill check its almost imposible to get a great skill check
---
Yeah generally if I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôll arm wave, it‚Äôs just something to do while sitting there
---
A plague doctor and a WW1 soldier killer would be really cool.
---
God I miss the folks at the r/tf2 subreddit
---
Congrats, keep it up!
---
As ont that the truth
---
Gathering of salty killers in comments.
---
Ahh, ok
---
There was a multiple killer bug infinite party streamer bug bring a mori as survivor bug list goes on  I used them all
---
How did politics find their way into r/deadbydaylight?
---
I think OP meant toxic survivors sitting at exit tbagging
---
This just happened to other day to me while I was healing I was wondering what the fuck was happening. But it's because the Pig put a trap on someone else and it's DbD.
---
Save yourself the headache and change your settings to " Comments from friends only" . 
---
Negative energy will do nothing for you and people like that exist everywhere. 
---
If the option is there, always choose that route in life'
---
Not unpopular at all, every free week the game has less and less new players than the previous
---
the game is too grindy to new players and too stale to old ones
---
even if I hate to admit it the game should take inspiration on the fortnite dev team to try and make the game feels fresh
---
I've honestly learned to expect this behavior from the community at this point, there's a few sane people but most of the rest are toxic because of the stupid feud between survivors and killers.
---
ehm you ummm you guys know there is a dlc of xen in mortal kombat x right?
---
I mean, I think it's a little unreasonable to expect 45000 bp for hitting 20 skillchecks.
---
Kill them earlier
---
The mask looks gigantic on you, but it's really well done
---
I like to live on the edge
---
If they make 80% on Both sides then it‚Äôs still 50 - 50 % with morr challenges just saying
---
I‚Äôm currently sitting here waiting to play Nurse, which I‚Äôve been doing for almost 30minutesüòëüòë
---
I have to wonder what enjoyment people like this actually get from playing the game. 
---
I can understand not wanting to be at red ranks and instead making sure you don‚Äôt rank up, so you hover in purple/green ranks and can use fun builds and different Killers without needing to sweat.
---
However to purposely go all the way down to where brand new players are just to camp them to death. Especially if you‚Äôve played enough to get all the trophies, what enjoyment is there doing this?
---
Don't get it, it's an useless perk
---
The game has different states for picking up and carrying in the code, I suppose. It will make sense for it not to count.
---
Hmm, the entity is pretty powerful, it could be fake, or this could be a purgatory of sorts, it‚Äôs confusing as it came out after L4D2
---
Leave the doors, don't give them the satisfaction and close the chat
---
I think that‚Äôd be really cool, maybe even have it at 50% for everyone
---
The best thing to do is completely ignore it. Realistically it depends in spawn placement, but ignoring it in a decent spawn is the best plan. I cannot tell you how many times I found a totem I overlooked just because the killer went to check up on it. No gens nearby, not chasing someone, had no reason to be there.
---
I mean, if they dumped that many points into Huntress prior, they should already know what it's like to play Killer, shouldn't they?
---
Killer queues have been 10+ minutes for me the last month. Barely get a chance to play. But EVERY SINGLE daily I get (except 1) in the last month was killer.
---
I kind if disagree, because you have a team to rely on as opposed to it just being you.
---
I imagine a random Dwight watching Ghost Face from afar wondering what the hell he's doing teabagging the hay bale.
---
Situational, but definitely not useless
---
&gt;Just watched an AaronPlaysTV video and compared his game to mine with his being much more vibrant, sharp and colorful and mine being blurry and dull. What can I do so I achieve a look like his?
---
Record your gameplay and use a video editing software to add a different filter. Done.

---
In a scale of 0 to 10 it is a NO
---
play on ultra? Im not sure but thats the only thing that comes to mind.
---
BHVR's problem is that they've created a meta or way of playing the game that is the only way to do it optimally by all these band aid perk fixes and killer powers.
---
You end up with the same stale shit every game as both sides of the coin.  And for new players it's hard to get to that place where you can even play that way on any given killer or survivor of choice. 
---
Then once you do you've played so long you've already begun to notice the repetitiveness despite the game having a ton of perk and killer options. Hell, even with survivors being skins mostly? I feel like I run into mostly Claudette, Nea, Meg, and Dwight. 
---
I think BHVR's answer to try to cover this up is the constant flow of cosmetics but a shiny new set of clothes is only keep you interested for about two seconds.
---
That and I think they don't think we notice they keep going after all this huge mega horror licenses for a reason. They've intentionally cornered the market on this type of game by constantly drawing everyone to it with the latest shiny Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Ghostface, Stranger Things, etc.
---
It's hard for any competitor even if it's good to compete with a game that's already gotten so many of the big names in it.  That and they hope that the constant 3 months of new killer will breath fresh live into the game, but after that? 
---
Most of the new killers and survivors drop off to the same stale choices and you never see them again. Like I'm currently rank 5 and the majority of the time I see the same killers over and over which is a problem when a game that has horror icons like Leatherface and Michael Myers in the same realm? 
---
Really should be having all kinds of variety and pick rates. Not to mention some of their original creations have truly been interestingly designed killers/survivors.
---
This game is such a gem, but it's really hardened itself into this stale little cocoon and will never blossom into what it really could be if the devs don't wake the hell up.
---
As a survivor main who pumped bloodpoints into my rank 20 killers, I found this super easy lol
---
When somebody brings toolbox (even a brown one) time for completing a gen from 72 secs goes down to 50. Thats nearly as good as having two people working together on a gen plus add great skill checks (say 3 on average) and time is downright 44 secs which is 2 player gen time. Now imagine 3 players doing that on 3 different gens. You are effectively playing against 6 gen workers.
---
And once gen pops they are free to run around, there is no pressure on them. Even if one of them goes down all other 3 are available to help. Thats a lot of help.
---
And no i dont go to basement to cry. I go to set my sets of condition for rest of the game. You abuse your half (gen rushing and evading) now I decide where and how i wanna chase and hook you. 
---
You want to pip up, thats why you brought sure shot game plan, fine, but that gives you a draw status. I command the other half and I will do it from my territory where you have only one way to escape. You want to secure rank, come meet me at my table.
---
Go to your tv picture settings and play around with it. Color/shadow/contrast..ect
---
I imagine they are notes, hastily scrawled and read by the Observer. For that reason, I think it's appropriate that the sentences are so fragmented.
---
What I don't approve of is repeating the same information, sometimes in the very next sentence, or contradicting what an earlier entry established. The Hunger is poorly written.
---
Honestly, I think it would be better if the characters voiced their own memories. Have Claudette reminisce on her childhood: Get rid of this blah Observer character, this is the Entity invading Claudette's thoughts, learning her backstory. Instead of emotionless note-taking, we could have something more akin to diary entries.
---
But I do want to say: I love how we're getting more lore. I'm very interested in the story, and I love how far they've come (Compare Wraith's lore and appearance to newer characters like Rin, they've improved so much) and I want to see more lore. I just hope they listen to some feedback and improve the quality of their writing, or change the delivery.
---
Is that really a challenge?
---
My theory being, if those are really the challenges they may gate it to give time for other players to catch up. That way, when its released everyone will be working towards the same unlocks all at once at clear decided time intervals, instead of spread out over time. It may promote players working together to get the abysmal ones. It may promote a clear divide in the community. They'd use that data to try other shit. Who knows, its bhvr.
---
Tome II will be unlocked on November 13th.
---
yes buying headphones is a skill
---
Welcome to the life of a killer main
---
NOED and points can't be the only reason to cleanse dull totems. It's a waste of time especially if you only find 4.
---
NVIDIA has a game filter that can graphically enhance the game.
---
I don't see why it left in the first place...
---
It isn‚Äôt released yet. There was a leak saying it gets released Nov 5th though.
---
You will get bored of that build in 3 matches. All your perks are pointed towards a single action, so until you get to that point you basically play without perks.
---
I used to run it but it showed boring real quick.
---
But in the case you want to run it Id swap Self Care for Poised.
---
Level 2 unlocks the 12th if I'm not mistaken. It should say if you hover over the 2nd page. Evey 2 weeks a new page opens up
---
Remember when Friday the 13th and Last Year were going to kill this game?
---
DUDE THIS IS SO AWESOME!
---
Dedicateds are a joke, deadhard never works always go down with exhaust effect, adrenaline pops run off to the gate and suddenly im down and im portrd back to a corner, hit ds run off and go down with no killer nearby again im in a corner, drop pallets early still get hit through/over them, vault a window make sure u not near it any more still get hit, my ping is fine im always in green ping lobbies of 20-60ms so the deds were a shit idea atm imo..
---
What am i looking at
---
I think killers can be toxic just not in the way people think.
---
Like searching near a hook because you KNOW that another survivor is near and will try and unhook isn't camping it's hunting the other survivor.
---
And tunneling can be annoying for a survivor, but would you rather go after the full health person that just unhooked someone or rehook someone and take them out of the game? Depending on context "tunneling" can be the right choice imo.
---
I think they could get  away with a "Great Skill Checks do 0/1/2% bonus generator progression" perk (It's currently 2% for a Great Check) without getting in too much trouble since it rewards skill and isn't something that will affect lower ranks.
---
Even as a Killer Main, Killers are getting way too many generator perks to the point that you can stall the game out to ridiculous times if you want to, and if Survivors want to be a gen jockey they should be able to.
---
That's lovely. Arm waving will just be my new "stay the hell away and focus on your surroundings and your surroundings alone"-sign then.
---
Have you ever considered that not everyone thinks they‚Äôre too hard? This subreddit is not representative of anything and frankly the people here are crybaby idiots
---
&gt;It isn‚Äôt released yet. There was a leak saying it gets released Nov 5th though.
---
Leak? The dates are announced in the news inside the game.
---
They're part of the game.  Just play it out,  accept it,  go to the next game  DCing is such a shitty, selfish, childish habit. It's taking the ball and going home because the other kids aren't playing by your made up rules. 
---
 And now with the Rift, you're also making it harder for people to compete challenges. What if they need that 4k? what if they have to kill survivors by their own hand?  Doesn't matter to you because you only care about them playing your prescribed way.
---
Its inexcusable on both sides. If you're getting bullied as a Killer,  learn from it, figure out what you did wrong, get better. 
---
At the end of the day, DCing is never a proper response for either side.
---
Yea I know but I did not find Contrast, Vibrance and Saturation sadly, been trying everything but I just could not take it to his vibrance
---
That‚Äôs wierd I haven‚Äôt seen 4 High skilled survivors letting a baby killer win!
---
Well, since playtime apparently matters, I've been playing since the beta and never translated waving to anything but camping. Whenever I'm bored on the hook, I just tab out and check Facebook or whatever. Not like repeatedly pressing M1 will make anyone less bored.
---
It's a bad thing in this game. It's a casual game, if you add a reward, everyone is gonna sweat their ass off with moris and keys..i'm 100% positive you wouldn't like it. And i say this at rank 1 on both side, leave the game as it is, more variety of build is fun. 
---
It's not balanced and it's not a competitive game, I WOULD NOT play this game if broken addons or items will be extremely popular
---
You could make an argument for Make Your Choice as well (Its duration is the same as its cooldown, and both go up 10 seconds every level).
---
Level IV won't be available until December 18th.
---
They don't need buffs. But they don't need pallets reduced to oblivion like I hear killers saying. Insta heals may have been strong but by no means we're they a common occurrence in every game. Egc is almost impossible to survive if you're on a map with close door spawns, camping/tunneling is rewarded because you die on hook so quick that even if other people are doing gens the killer is still fucking over a person's game (and people wonder why survivors DC on a killer camping) like I'm sorry I'm all for the game being more balanced and I agree there were some killers that need/needed help but I feel we're heading down a path where survivors are going to have a really hard time surviving
---
 I really think they need to have more secret offerings. something other than mori or shroud cause it's really not a secret if there's only 2 options. One being game changing and possibly ending the game quickly. or the other really not being used at all. Like have something like, i don't know. get 1 more add on or one more perk or something(may be a little op but I'm just spitballing.)
---
I mean preventing it is a fix....
---
The issue you're describing is a race condition, which, frankly, is easily fixed by simply removing the button rather than adding a bunch of lines of codes for a feature, while nice, doesn't really help when you're partying up with people. They should have disabled the button otherwise, but meh.
---
desperate for the pallet save
---
And you should be able to enter the archives when in a lobby (you might be able to but I know 100% if you have a challenge selected and you are in a lobby you cannot go to the Archives or the Rift
---
Yo yo... No need to talk about my baby hag like that. We get it shes ugly but dam man not like this
---
**Thank you for your kind words!!**
---
Knowing Behavior there was probably a major bug related to it they were unable to fix
---
there was a bug that would allow people to come in as multiple killers.
---
Plus they also removed the fact that every time you finished a game you had to recreate the party.
---
So the people who solo the game lost some time switching between killers, and the people who actually have friends gained a lot of time because they didn't have to make a new party every time a game ended.
---
The girl on the right looks like the lady that plays Thea in Arrow
---
The same way I often don't see a high skilled killer let babys win, they often let one of the 4, so dom't expect 4 to let the baby win the same way the killer don't let all 4 win.
---
What state ?
---
I‚Äôve just seen comments about this on reddit so I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs true or not but apparently the code for making the new survivor survive with friends lobby messed up the code for the button that allows you to switch between the killer and survivor lobby so they took out the button to add in the new survivor SWF lobby. Theoretically it‚Äôs supposed to be fixed in the near future but we‚Äôll see how that goes.
---
I‚Äôm not getting any games right now.
---
Petition to add the entire fucking cast..just no
---
Dope.
---
I vote yay
---
Demo and Ghost above Huntress is rather questionable
---
True didn't think about that
---
That would be cool
---
haha yes this finally happened to another person
---
On PS4 it takes forever to play survivor. It‚Äôs reverse on other platforms usually
---
chest bursters are Disney princesses
---
They turned every survivor into a blendette
---
When the game tells you that Trapper is easy :\^)
---
IKR ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They're in my part 1 xD
---
And that guy could carry David?
---
They are talking about the frame rate drop when they blinked. But yeah it wouldn‚Äôt have hit even without that
---
Swap Freddy with nurse and this is pretty good
---
I‚Äôm more concerned at your username at this point
---

---
It's not that. It's that they had to rework the button and it was simpler to remove it until later since they completely redid the flow for lobbies so that people didn't have to keep inviting people after every round.
---
It's nice but the messed up make up kills it for me, might run the mechanic head instead with the suit
---
Says what exactly? Lol you don‚Äôt know a fucking thing about me. Well clip it and show me then.  If your gonna act so salty show me
---
Uhh,get better perks and play more to get better at the game?I'm a constant red rank killer but once in a while I do get wrecked too.
---
Am i the only one who gets infinite loading screen like every 2 games?
---
Its because they pair it with this is not happening for the archives challenge. (And resilience)
---
Not sure if this has been seen but Reddit has a search feature.
---
OOF. Or when the non obsession survivor is running towards the hooked survivor while you are right behind them. luls
---
Bro, completely repair 4 generators with Dark Sense, notice the word ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù, you‚Äôre right, they‚Äôre not hard, they‚Äôre luck based, you are required to have 3 teammates with the combined IQ of 50 and a killer that doesn‚Äôt even know how to use a controller, if you think all of them are doable (especially on a time limit) you‚Äôre probably farming with killers
---
It would make it easier for the devs to balance survivors vs. killers if you take out the factor of SWF. More balanced survivor play = more people want to play survivor = shorter killer queue times.
---
What
---
Nurse still ignores the game lol they just increased her skill floor a little bit and she has a higher skill floor than Freddy in general. Freddy is much more counterable than she is
---
Yeah i asked more people on steam and everyone said its fine, thanks for helping
---
It says kill all survivors ‚Äúby any means‚Äù. Literally should say get a 4K
---
But they aren‚Äôt?
---
They could've just greyed out the button for survivors, but talking about BHVR when was the last logical thing they did?
---
servers are down at the moment at least on my end (ps4)
---
A lot of people are asking when or are confused about the dates for the next levels so I decided to make this post. 
---
You can find this in-game, just check the news.
---
I had to switch to the old reddit format, then I put my name tag as a picture of Ghost Face (you can use pictures there). 
---
Now it is my favorite boy. 
---
The Best boy.
---
I don‚Äôt farm. I think it should be bannable
---
It doesn‚Äôt mean from start to finish. The same wording is on a healing challenge and I did it without full start to finish heals
---
True I guess he could hop in another locker. And hatch would be heartbreaking... that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt tried for the achievement yet haha
---
Shouldn't have prestiged if you weren't ready
---
*me a Chad only playing legion for the bloodpoint gain and fun*
---
Just find a killer that's willing to let you do this. Save yourself the trouble. Lot of the challenges I just worked together at with friends... work smarter not harder
---
If they change Borrowed Time to proximity instead of Terror Radius, I don't mind it. 
---
As long as Oblivious prevents people from getting Endurance, this would be a terrible idea.
---
This is actually really helpful thank you dude
---
they did that before Disney bought Fox if I'm not mistaken?
---
Oi cunt
---
Yeah, it means 320 charges, which means you have to have teammates that aren‚Äôt even capable of doing more than 80 charges on a gen, and if you‚Äôve got teammates like that you‚Äôve probably lost the game
---
...I feel like you didn't read my comment.
---
&gt; Also, you can not say it is fair but it overtips the balance, that is  self contradictory. Every time as a surv i get hit with NOED i dont  curse the killer. I curse my teammates for not doing bones. 
---
Okay, what I was trying to say was NOED shouldn't be nerfed or removed from the game, because it's fair overall, *but* it specifically overtips the balance *for low ranks*. And I mean brown ranks, not yellow or higher. I just wish it could be either reworked slightly or given a higher rarity so new killers don't get it as quickly.
---
&gt; There are plenty of reasons to do totem in game now if you are just gen  rushing excuse me, you ARE playing game wrong. Not because it is toxic  or handicaps killer but because you are then playing simulator with a  lot of skill checks. There is a fun for being lost for a while in the  game. Multiplayer gamers never understood that. 
---
Again, I'm talking about brown ranks who've literally never heard the term "gen rushing" before. You're also trying to blame other multiplayer games for people's attitudes to this game, which I don't really understand, and it honestly feels really gatekeep-y. Yes, this is a horror game simulator, but gens are the main objective, so if you're "playing simulator with a  lot of skill checks," that's on the devs for making a mini-game be the main objective. Trying to dismiss people with complaints as "multiplayer gamers" is... frankly, rude. Lastly, what do you mean by "there is a fun for being lost for a while in the game?" This isn't an Elder Scrolls game (and that's my franchise of choice, btw, so I'm not a "multiplayer gamer"). Do you expect players to just walk around and get lost in the scenery of the corn fields?
---
If I assume you're trying to say that people shouldn't bitch so much about the game and just have fun and not complain, your comment feels a lot less "being lost for a while in the game" than mine. I was just sharing a story to express an issue I have, not trying to... imply that people who don't do totems are masturbating in the corner?
---
&gt; 4 survs, 5 totems. If even one of them is using Detective hunch, inner  strength or small game (just one of those perks) he will on average do 3  totems in a game. Others have to do 2. It is not that hard, takes 14  seconds thats lot of time less than running to corner and touching  yourself with self care. 
---
Seriously, what the fuck is that last sentence?
---
I just feel like you're attacking me for a friendly "hey I wish NOED didn't do this one thing." Either expect people to be strategic and not do gens(?) or expect them to calm down and enjoy the game. You can't have both.
---
I got lampkin lane 5+ times in a row last Halloween, but that was because they raised the map odds due to the holiday.
---
Takes more skill to camp and kill rank 20s nice.
---
Ive got screen shots of them if anybody wants em
---
I guess we‚Äôll see
---
matchmaking is fucked rn. most people cant get games
---
Well, BHVR is adamant about not touching gen numbers anymore. I'd say either drop both skillchecks and struggle on hook for survivor, OR add those things for killer. Maybe skillchecks to set traps, break gens, etc. and have to struggle to hold a wiggling survivor or struggle to put a survivor on the hook. That's a good start.   
---
Additionally, I don't think the killer should see what survivors join their lobby until the game starts, similar to how survivors can't see which killer and the killer's name until the game starts. You can easily associate survivors with their perks and have a small idea (I know any perk for any survivor) of what their perks may be. It also gives the killer an unfair advantage when they can start checking steam profiles for time played, etc. Let's keep it blind for everyone until the game starts.
---
and this right here literally just debunked this entire post. roll credits.
---
I vote big nay.  The basement is already VERY strong for numerous killers in the cast.  
---
And you want it to hide all auras and indications the killer is nearby? Therefore further allowing proxy camping the basement or straight up doing so? 
---
Big ass nope.
---
Ranks 20 to 16 aren't affected by matchmaking so they can be matched up against any rank.
---
My theory here is, these survivors were sitting in queue for a while and the game decided to put them against that killer just so they could play or the killer was sitting in queue for a while.
---
I, um... just wrote out a giant comment arguing with you over another point. Didn't realize you were the same person who wrote out the Huntress story. Truce?
---
I missed her release, what made her bad back then?
---
It's been happening to me off and on since the bloodhunt started on ps4
---
Hopefully its a bug bc thats the only way you can trick a face camper into letting the survivor go.
---
If its a feature then it's a stupid one.
---
yes had 3 matches in the past 3 hours. posted the same rant about a hour ago. There servers must be bugged
---
Can‚Äôt you just come to an agreement with the killer before the match? Like maybe tell him ‚Äúif me and Dwight are about to escape can you help me with this challenge?‚Äù I feel like this would be the easiest way to do it.
---
Ahhhh okej thx for explaining
---
I'm aware that Jake used dead hard, ~~pretty sure I still would've hit him normally~~. At around 4 seconds, I was on him for ages, spamming m1 but that didn't really work out...
---
I guess this clip isn't really the best example
---
(edit: you are probably right about that hit now that I look at it again)
---
They‚Äôll lose money if they don‚Äôt change it, so I doubt we will see, but if they decide not to change it, very few players will buy The Rift Pass, only the most dedicated players will even consider paying for it
---
Yeah, exactly
---
Leave and go break some pallets for points or something
---
And by Steve I'm gonna assume you mean that one character that sounds like a goddman squeaky toy when you hook him
---
You have to take in the fact that the hitboxes are sometimes really bad. Even after all these patches hatchets sometimes hit people who are crouching in the cover or out of sight near a doorway. This also makes the huntress more unfun to play against.
---
There was. They didn't find a solution for having both the swf lobby reinvite thing and this feature because both has something to do with lobbies. I'm sure they'll manage to fix it though.
---
The sun was shining. 
---
The wind was blowing. 
---
Any more excuses you want to use?
---
Now the killer also lag switched? C'mon man.
---
Only thing more disheartening is when a piggy doesnt acknowledge item drop *and* boop the snoot. PepeSad
---
Besides hag and wraiths placement i agree
---
Hag Just i don't know where to put here. And wraith around Legion clown. For the rest i agree
---
Last night I played for a few hours as killer and survivor didnt have problems at all connecting to matches in a quick time
---
There should be an achievement for having every status affect on you at once, similar to "How did we get here?" from Minecraff
---
Trapper is way better than bubba
---
Wait I think I actually saw that in a watch mojo video back when that was a thing, was it the one with the girl who made smart decisions?
---
I got down to 6, but I haven‚Äôt played in a awhile cuz I‚Äôve played with my friends
---
I hate playing as killer.. I'd rather just play survivor and not be toxic
---
I played a couple games before football started this morning. De-piped twice because I was the first one hooked and got face camped. The second match I spectated my team because they got three gens done in the time I was chased and camped. They pointed out how they were able to easily escape because the killer camped me. The killer said verbatim "If I can just ruin one person's game every time, I'm happy". 
---
People like this exist in every online game, not just DBD.
---
We have the same Jeff look
---
You know, I have BBQ and chili but hardly use it. 
---
I play huntress. All I need are my hatchets and for you to try dropping that pallet at point blank range.
---
Which reminds me I need to do an edit of this hatchet throw I got
---
Brilliant, cheers
---
What makes me angry the most Is the fact that I'm a rank 14 but my teammates are rank 9 but none of them do a single Gen while I run the killer for about 5 minutes straight
---
LoganHumpsSheep
---
So you play like a total dickhead on purpose and never care about anyone else's fun but yours in a mutiplayer game? That's a big yikes, even if an unsurprising one. It's quite obvious from the way you talk
---
Show me on the doll where the survivors hurt you
---
Facts
---
I‚Äôve started playing nurse a lot after her changes and I can say without a doubt she is the hardest killer to learn in the entire game. If a nurse ever just shits on me at least I know that they put effort into the match. Can‚Äôt say the same for prayer beads spirit though...
---
I got my first Blood Warden kill yesterday and its one of the most satisfying gaming moments I've ever had.
---
This is *absolutely* going to have people deranking to 20 so that they can do this shit to baby killers, and honestly, I don't fucking blame them with how ridiculous these challenges are
---
Or you know the ACTUAL PARTY SERVICE ON CONSOLE
---
Ah okay, didn't realise that, the only thing is (I should've mentioned this) that I intend to buy the skin with the putrid serum currency, which runs out in about 2 months.
---
They really are. You clearly have not had the pleasure of 3+ injured survivors getting fully healed with increased movement speed leaving little to no chance of catching them
---
Good choice :) I love the hair and the ugly sweater ( I think it's a really cool sweater though, I would love to have the same) . Hopefully I'll get the bloody pants soon, trying to get him to prestige 2 right now
---
Last time I did something like that I got shit talked after the game for ‚Äúbaiting a downed survivor‚Äù 
---
Except it‚Äôs not baiting when they are swarming me. Didn‚Äôt even give me a chance to pick him up without flying in my range.
---
r/nofunallowed
---
I just read a book
---
I can at least 2k the 2000 hour SWFs as long as they aren't playing over comms when I'm playing as Leatherface since I use NOED, Franklins, Ruin, and  BBQ. The only ranks I see a lot of killer variation in is ranks 13 - 20. Outside of those ranks I see Billy, Huntress, and Spirit the most. I see Hag too, but not as much as I do the other three.
---
Seems balanced to me.
---
Ha. Nerd.
---
I‚Äôve never had this happen to me but if it did I would probably be sent into a murderous rage. Like thats such a douchebag thing to do.
---
SCP-049 has breached containment
---
Well even if Bill is from a different game, I think it would be easier for them to get more cosmetics from him because Bill comes from a Valve game which is directly linked to Steam so, if they can get cosmetics for characters from big budget movie studios surely they could work with Steam since they have a working relationship already.
---
Also, I remember when Bill came out and during the dev livestream Matheu Cote said, that Steam noticed that DBD was one of the top selling games month after month and Steam approached them and wanted to thank them by giving them the go ahead to put Bill in the game. Maybe the BHVR team can easily approach them and ask for a favor?
---
When DBD becomes an RPG
---
&gt;If its on the front page of the store yes, it gives you a massive warning before doing it, if its through the characters page then no, it makes you buy the character first.
---
You can buy skins for characters you don't own just fine.
---
;-;
---
A ding a ding ding, another survivor group affected by low player pop/killers already in games/ and the cherry on top NOOOOOO cross platform play which also affects total player active pop since progress isn‚Äôt carried over to all platforms a lot of SWF scatter in between platforms and if I recall/read correctly ps4 is where the player base is ‚Äòmostly‚Äô so yea....
---
Another reason why cross platform and progress carried over across all platforms is a must for the active player count but no one cares about it and instead keeps feeding the machine :3
---
What happened when the game started?
---
I run that top build but use Dead Hard instead of Self Care. I like Spine Chill but I was finding when I use it I rely on it too much and I'm more alert when I don't have it.
---
If you get injured in a chase and are about to go down, you can Dead Hard to create space, vault a window, and completely disappear. I feel like most killers don't expect Dance with Me and they lose you completely when your scratch marks disappear.
---
The only thing I could find was in patch 2.3.0: ‚ÄúThe Spirit's phasing audio has been adjusted: Survivors within the Spirit Husk's terror radius will not hear the phasing sound. Survivors outside the Spirit Husk's terror radius can hear the Spirit's phasing sound, but will not be able to determine its direction. Survivors will no longer be able to hear the Spirit's breathing while she is phasing.‚Äù
---
Honestly most of these tier 4 challenges seem impossible without a farming killer. Idk what BHVR was thinking.
---
Thank god!
---
He probably did tbh
---
I think everyone is severely overestimating how difficult they will actually be because 65 percent of the people here are desperate and frothing at the mouth to cry about the rift
---
Guess what happend in chat after this game ;)
---
I've tried discussing or suggesting new perks and such and got ignored or dogpiled. Doesn't encourage me to try again &gt;.&lt;
---
I mean you didn't suck so that's on you. You and that huntress knows the hit boxes are wierd so when by cover duck to be safe
---
Maybe it's just because I really don't feel that pressured as survivor at all, but I've never really had that feeling of "Oh I get it now"
---
That person who posted their Wraith cosplay a few days ago for Halloween was so good
---
Dont forget ash
---
Window hits and pallet hits are intended. If the hit boxes don‚Äôt match up it‚Äôs connection issues or miss animation. Either way it should be hitting. They‚Äôve confirmed this
---
Serves a legion right
---
Thanks bro I forgot to look the shrine and was waiting for BBQ for so long!
---
If I was to guess I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because their team mates are making no attempt to get them. There‚Äôs really no point in playing if you get hooked and your team mates get you last minute then the killer goes straight back for you. 
---
I play killer and if I see this happening I let that person win and make sure I kill the others for shitty gameplay.
---
Aw fuck, so that is why... Well byebye bloodhunt
---
BHVR needs to make the game more fun to survivor, on pc at least the rate is way off the 1-4 that should minimize the queue times, specially since the archives "force" you to play survivor and killer equally
---
&gt; it actually depends on the player.
---
She has a high skill floor for sure.
---
&gt; or worse than freddy before the rework.
---
This is frankly ridiculous. It is impossible for her to be worse than pre-rework Freddy because she can hit before before 7 seconds are up
---
Killers get more bloodpoints
---
1 killer for 4 survivors
---
Sure you can report them. But as of now I don‚Äôt think behaviour can tell if they dced on purpose or if they actually got disconnected from the game. So they won‚Äôt get banned or anything.
---
Killers shouldn't be required to run ruin to counter survivors.
---
Rank 1 survivors DC. Trust me when you consistently get rank 1 every season a DC doesn‚Äôt affect anything. Rank has no meaning. It doesn‚Äôt make people want to stay at a certain rank, so losing it is meaningless. If there was a time ban it would easily stop dc‚Äôs.
---
Just plan to focus only on gens for some games. I‚Äôve done it before, especially at potato ranks of the other survivors are all focused on trying to rescue each other. Run a build that will help you do it faster and bring toolboxes.
---
AFAIK you can't, not anymore. If you're a survivor, you can have a friend from a diff region invite you to play there and you'll be in that region as long as you're with him, but if you're a killer... Tough luck.
---
For me it‚Äôs not even a minute in and the dc cause they got downed. Like we don‚Äôt even get a chance to save them cause there like ‚ÄúI can not be first downed therefore I dc!‚Äù
---
I think you just don't wanna try. You gave to go into the game actively looking to get flashlight saves. Run a build for it. Empathy and Sprint Burst will help a lot
---
Earlier today I was trying to play Dead By Daylight, but the archives have made killer queues way too long, because everyone tries to do the challenges. As a killer main, this has made it a lot harder for me to enjoy the game. Being a survivor is fun and all, but I prefer the pressure of playing killer, trying to keep tabs on all four survivors at once. I know it seems like I'm trying to sound smart, but I don't know how else to word it; I enjoy how much brain power and focus it takes playing Killer.
---
Anyways, after 20 minutes in the queue, I finally got my boy Leatherface into a lobby, and soon enough we were playing the game. I chased a Steve into the Shack, and while he tried to run through the God Pallet, a Nea came by and blocked his path. She refused to move, sandbagging Steve while I revved my chainsaw and cut them both down. Steve disconnected immediately, but Nea stayed and let herself get hooked. She tried to escape, reached the struggle phase, and didn't struggle at all. Nea killed herself, **unlike Jeffery Epstein.**
---
End game collapse, basically a timer that starts going down as soon as the exit gates are powered or the hatch is closed.
---
Lol slow T-bag = GOODüëç
---
I get about ten flashlight saves a day so this should be easy. Doing four gens in one trail though might be hard.
---
I'm on PS4 where killer times are usually instant but both survivor and killer times are painfully long atm.
---
That sounds like a good compromise. As long as the perk is easier to activate I don¬¥t mind how exactly they do it.
---
The question is how you code it when a teammate helps you, do you code it for less percentage, do you still need to fill the entire bar, what if you join when they are already healed up slightly? 
---
&gt;I'm not sure I'd be ok with the requirement being 50% and counting your self heals
---
I was thinking either one or the other, both would be an overkill for sure. The idea behind 50 percent is simply insurance against situations like friend coming to help you or starting a heal on a teammate who is already slightly healed etc. 70 percent or so would be fine too IMO.
---
Okey thank you sir.
---
Damn, welp. You gotta be quicker then that
---
I kinda hope one day behavior adds something more then just getting points for someone doing. Like a time limit for every dc so they can just join a lobby right away or something.
---
Now for legion cosplays.
---
Dude, if a killer is at least purple ranks, they‚Äôll look at a wall, they‚Äôll bait the pick up, they‚Äôll even just slug and chase you down, what then?
---
That rank 17 would have been in a queue for 5+ hours if he didn‚Äôt get random matchmaking.
---
People in this subreddit and survivor mains do not care about this. Facts are shit on in r/dbd
---
"Otherwise you would be able to switch to killer with friends in your lobby, for example."
---
That sounds like a bug they didn't want to fix to me.
---
Well I play on console and on there it‚Äôs ‚ÄúB‚Äù.
---
If that helps. Lol
---
Good thing its impossible for me to complete all the challenges
---
Why make it easier to camp, insidious wouldn‚Äôt have to be used, then you give killers freedom to fuck people over even more. This is clear misunderstanding of game mechanics an vakance
---
Bone hurting truth
---
(Pc) Blood points rewarded was over 50k but I was only getting 40k basically shorted out of 10k every game last night :(
---
Not all survivors go down by walls.
---
This just proves that you don't wanna try.
---
&gt; they‚Äôll even just slug and chase you down, what then?
---
why are you letting them see you? keep some distance and sprint burst in right when the animation starts
---
Well, usually, people with lowass karma while having been here for a while tend to be trolls.
---
Anyways, seriously, you don't have to encourage it, but have a little empathy and stop insulting people who do get angry over it. I dont get why people cry over a lot of emotional stuff, but I'm not going to tell them to get over it, that's stupid.
---
Same problem here
---
Only thing I disagree with is where plague is placed. Other than that it seems alright
---
Do we have a tier list for the various kinds of oversaturated content yet?
---
My inner Killer is screaming of Joy, but my inner Survivor is drowning in despair
---
Bruh I'd love to see the Xenomorph in Kingdom Hearts, one mission you'd just go into the alien hive and just see goofy on the wall going "*scoff* gorsh there's one inside me" before he starts screaming and just has a chestburster rip out of him
---
Bruh, go play a different game. Seriously lmao you're making them worse by letting then live. I mean, atleast run em around, slug em, give em some chances, but don't just straight up let em go cuz you're better, challenge them a bit and then show them what happens when they are caught. It will be better for them in the long run. You didn't get to where you are as survivor by having killers who let you go. Play the damn game
---
Time to bring Franklin's demise
---
Yeahhh, there‚Äôs also another one where you have to open 3 exit gates in a single trial
---
Just looked it in the wiki and apparently he doesn't even have a name, just the camp motega killer.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that in order to do this, I have to just hope that the survivors don‚Äôt go down next to walls, run a flashlight, run Sprint Burst, and still it‚Äôs going to be hard because after the first flashlight save the killer will be more aware of their surroundings, sounds borderline impossible to me
---
That looks more like lag then anything else
---
It's weirdly uncomfortable now, like they're invading my personal space.
---
Why are you getting downvoted, your right. Do the Clinton's follow this sub-reddit
---
That doesn‚Äôt make him better. There‚Äôs a reason why most people recommend trapper when learning killer. It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs the most basic killer in the game. Trapper has to go find his traps where leather face just has to rev his chainsaw and hit the survivors
---
Nerfs moris and keys I can live with that
---
Spine Chill is functioning as intended. Only aura reading is effected by oblivious.
---
There are no decapitations in dbd because it will get banned in china
---
How was i so blind üòÇ
---
And people who are bad at killer shouldn‚Äôt be influencing developer decisions, but here we are. 
---
Enjoy the killer queue times getting worse!
---
I'm so glad I don't do this as Killer.. God these people give us a bad name.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr2hef/strange_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I loved the tier lists :(
---
???? When did I say I did?? I'm talking about when people cry about movies, what tf are you on about. I'm saying that people get mad over things that you wouldn't, and if you dont understand, dont be an asshole and insult them. Easy.
---
How do you even doubt that? Its simple. If you have negative or extremely low karma, while having a few months old account, it usually means you either never comment or you post a lot of controversial shit so you get downvoted and have low karma. Judging by the fact that youre insulting people because they get mad over teabagging, I'm assuming youre a troll.
---
NOED just rewards bad play styles.
---
Bruh :(
---
Depends on the survivor tbh, there is no universal signal other then GF/Pig tbagging on top of a survivor without hitting them.
---
Best bet is to stand still away from the gen looking at them, the survivors if they are smart they will come back after sprinting away to look at you and point/tbag and then its usually fine.
---
I played as Myers earlier and had a Laurie With OoO. I could see her Aura as she was looking at me but she must not have been able to see me as I was still in Tier 1, so I managed to grab her off the gen.
---
Immediately 2 seconds later
---
Meg drops pallet on your girl
---
Frank: Guess I‚Äôll Tunnel
---
I wonder how the game would be if it actually went in the direction of the main tool for survivors being stealth and distraction, instead of the looping we have now
---
Leather face has nothing going for him other then a horrible chainsaw that can be countered by lockers, going behind objects and into narrow areas, if a trap is placed in a good spot the survivor being chased has to find somewhere else to loop the trapper at, which usually means taking a hit, trapper can completely shut down long loops and infinite‚Äôs while bubba cannot
---
Have you tried running the addon that makes it so once you blink and hit someone, it takes away your ability to blink and turns you into normal m1 killer speed? This way you only have to get one lucky blink to hit someone, then you just chase them down by normal. Not the best way to help you actually learn Nurse, but it's an easy way for non-Nurse players to have a shot at the adept.
---
Disclaimer: on PTB this addon straight up broke the game. Idk if it still does but I would *assume* they fixed it by now. Then again, using new Dying Light would crash the game for a solid month and a half so maybe not. 
---
Otherwise just wait for rank reset to do adepts.
---
Howdy! I had a lot of problems with discord and I'll be making a new server today. I was in a lot of long lobbys towards the late hours of the morning. 8 hours to go!

What? Facecamping and tunneling are probably complained about more than anything, and told to get cancer. Even when they don't facecamp or tunnel lol both sides can be toxic bro, and both sides complain about the other. Let's not act like any side gets special treatment. Both sides are gunna have dicks and both sides are gunna feel like they are right. And in a way they both are.
---
Nice!! Keep it up!
---
Ptb or normal? Becuase the game doesn't have servers yet
---
Duuuuuude
---
Not all DCs are on purpose, was playing in a swf last few nights and we had people get dc'd at the start or mid game for no reason. The main reason people DC, including the killer too because we have had quite a few killers DC on us, not always survivors is due to the fact the game really doesn't punish you for doing so. You loose a few Bps and a pip (not really a big deal) Maybe if they actually punished people who dc on a regular basis, it would stop it from happening as much. Still won't completely solve the problem tho.
---
They was thinking if they make the challenges ridiculously hard people will have to buy tiers ;)
---
Yeah you were pretty assumptive and pre judgemental in that comment thats why i didnt replied you back there. Have peace man.
---
There are things out of balance in this game, sure but not for right reasons. Also I am not being gatekeeper (tes that's the word xD) I was just stating that this game doesn't have to be balanced like other multiplayers. You have to think a slasher movie as reference before you go for say Overwatch.
---
Oh yeah, with the last level of the Tomes being Dec. 18th and the final leaked cutscene for The Hunger, I totally think he's gonna be our next Killer now. ^^^^Even ^^^^if ^^^^that ^^^^bums ^^^^me ^^^^out ^^^^a ^^^^little.
---
I really want out of space out of mind
---
You see them, they dont see you. I think object lights up in your perk bar though so you get a small notification.
---
yeah, i found it ironic that you'd say something so close to what happened in this incident. really makes you realize that even cruel people like that can say normal and casual things even while killing people. and just for the record, the person who was asking survived :) they let him go
---
Start game, drop god pallet, teabag the confused survivors, burn out your flashlight and disconnect to assert dominance.
---
It‚Äôs gonna be way worse for the killers
---
but because it's a counter to a stealth killer's ability, it's gonna get nerfed because that's how this game works
---
That is most unfortunate in that case. At which point you just gotta take one for the team. We've all been there unfortunately.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true it just sucks though cause I don‚Äôt know for me if feels like once the archives happened people like to dc every time and I feel like it isn‚Äôt accident cause it‚Äôs right after they‚Äôve been hit once or just got downed.
---
Depends on right. You get more points going after the full health survivor, put more pressure on the game immediately, while the latter put more pressure a bit later. If you're a good killer it's worth your while to go after the full health survivor.
---
This isn‚Äôt an argument you haven‚Äôt presented any evidence to back up your claim dafuq
---
Well you have 2 of the same person and a slug so I don‚Äôt know what you would expect with Nancy
---
Toolboxes and a build of Rush have to be enough but is going to be hard
---
Feature unfortunately. They changed it so that killers couldn't BM/spank survivors.
---
I main Steve and always run Unbreakable in case killers want to let me bleed out to avoid my lustful hook moan.
---
I hate players like you
---
It does have servers their live on switch and pc
---
PC has been on/ testing for awhile now fyi
---
Ayy derank time
---
Are you on PC or console?
---
Man I had a match against huntress yesterday where she saw me get into the locker, and I was the last one there. She wouldn't approach the locker, and just waited, holding her hatchet in the air, for maybe 5-6 minutes. 
---
When she finally got bored and came for me, head on didn't even work. :/
---
I know its been testing i just didn't know they where out on PC
---
Oh! I did not know that
---
You are speaking in the language of gods
---
No, you're right, it's the builds reason. I'm just cheap and refuse to buy other killers to get the best perks, and Shrine of Secrets can only take you so far.
---
Hey, who turned out the lights?
---
Pretty much, haha. One of the smartest main characters of a horror movie I've ever seen.
---
i believe he also said that he'd like to be close to his family which makes it even more difficult
---
For about a month or so now
---
Getting the second one will be the hard part
---
Damm
---
Not since the switch to dedicated servers.
---
Really? TIL
---
Thank you, I needed to see this. Really cheered me up!
---
Yeah problem is my main is Myers so people with think I‚Äôm stalking them, I guess I‚Äôd just have to play as a different killer in that scenario?
---
You downvote all you want, but i'm right, you newbies have no idea how shit that perk is
---
Ghostface isn't immune to OoO while in stealth.
---
Yeah the mask was way big but it was high quality and only like $45 on Amazon because I can‚Äôt do arts and crafts to save my life lol
---
Wild!
---
Youre right about not being active lol l but if you even read my post about tbagging youd see why im over people getting salty about it. Also fair thats mybad for assuming. My reason for bring an asshole was cause he was saying im on a high horse and all this unneccessairy shit do I have to be polite to him??
---
it definitely was, but they couldve nerfed them or maybe only put the green ones in. wouldnt it be great if they had just left it for use AT LEAST in the "kill your friends" lobbys. would be awesome to use them in private matches and have a different, more creepy and funny match experience.
---
&gt;no killer is better than another
---
you could not be more wrong lmao
---
That Pig out-fucking-skilled you.
---
I couldn't find the actual dev statement anywhere but I definitely remember seeing it. If you search up "not\_queen" jeepers creepers on google however, you can see a shit ton of people already saying what I've said that she's stated we're not getting him.
---
Is it bad that I‚Äôve used the perk so many times out of meme that i just know the stats by memory. 
---
The perk needs a buff or better yet a rework, but I like to basement meme sometimes
---
Me:wow that‚Äôs funny cuz I‚Äôm waiting for a game rn, I should comment that
---
Me scrolling through comments: üò¢wow that‚Äôs a lot of people also waiting
---
Myers isnt a good farming person so yeah i would reccomend someone else. Doctor is the standard farming character since he gets bloodpoints for existing on the map.
---
This is probably a dumb question, but I'm a super casual player: what should I be doing if not focusing on gens and the occasional unhook?
---
Thanks asshole! :)
---
The problem is they aren't hard challenges. You don't get two blinds on a killer when they're picking some one up unless you either have a really open map and/or the killer is a potato with short term memory loss. There's not really anything you can do to make that happen, you're just crossing your fingers for the killer that keeps touching the stove.
---
I play on Switch soo...
---
Quite possibly the most bogus chainsaw to ever chainsaw
---
Why do I need a third party service to play this game..?
---
How many other titles have in-game team chat..?
---
Do you see why you're clueless?
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd say more then 2/3 of my 167 comments are about people waiting for their games atm.
---
Trapper‚Äôs too low in my opinion, his traps have incredible snowball potential if you get a basement hook or two
---
The amount of Whoooosh in the comments makes me sick.
---
Because they're angry at x for y reason. 
---
Because there is no punishment for it, and people keep justifying NOT implementing punishments for fucking stupid reasons, so they can continue to disconnect.
---
According to the devs, it's "perfectly fine" if it isn't in excess, and since they haven't even defined it, my guess is you're 100% unlikely to get banned if you DO leave in excess. Can you imagine the developers of a game saying that disconnecting is fine? Lmao
---
That's why I've decided to become reformed as a killer when I'd never DC. All those games I should've left, all those shitty maps I got, all those bad Ruin spots, or 30 second Ruins, whatever. You know what? Those make me angry, so I'm just going to just ragequit like all of the survivors, because it's "perfectly fine" :)
---
Damn, that matchmaking must have sucked
---
&gt;if you failed to complete your objective
---
But they didn't. That's my point. Preventing the gens from being finished is not the objective. Not letting anyone escape is, and the devs are balancing for 2 escapes per match. Meaning *the game is balanced around powered gates most games*.
---
Same here. Super frustrating over the Halloween weekend event. I'm hoping its just because not enough dedicated servers were provided during the double-bloodpoints period and it will return to a more playable state once less people are playing at the same time.
---
i thought the chests belong to the entity in order to bring hope to survivors? besides the characters, everything in the fog was created by the entity and between trials the chests are created again. i don‚Äôt think the devs would give killers that sort of power? well, there are a lot of inconsistencies within the lore anyways, but i‚Äôm just going by what i‚Äôve heard.
---
Uh no. I am a hag main and got blinded plenty by light wielders.
---
Use both
---
Same, something must be going on with the servers. Very unlikely that there aren't enough players to find any survivor or killer games on a Sunday afternoon during a double BP event...
---
Platform: PS4
---
Hosts have been disconnecting and negating ALL bloodpoints earned in-game. I've played two 15 minute matches back to back for the host to disconnect before the survivors would escape and ended up gaining NO bloodpoints from that game.
---
Jesus shut the fuck and be respectful
---
I thought double BP wasn't active on switch yet.
---
High ranks, survivors are probably stronger. Low ranks, killers are stronger. And there lies the problem with the game. 
---
High rank SWF is on another level.
---
Way I do it is I down someone then walk next to a gem and start smacking it
---
I cried abit.
---
When this emerges, I'll be a nice killer and let them light save off of me.
---
A reminder that I'm playing for a cause!!! 100% of your donation goes to hospitals in dire need of funding!!!
---
I'm almost halfway to my goal and every dollar helps.

---
The lobby wait got pretty bad around 3/4am, and I guess I'm a survivor main now because I played two matches as killer. A very fun one with really great survivors that really made me work for it as pig, and a second one as trapper where I had 3 teabagging Claudettes and two of them disconnected after first down.

THE DISCORD

**(I am not streaming! This is to chat and share my progress and memes! Please send memes. I'm so tired)**
---
Thank you for everyone that has been really kind and supportive!
---
I can‚Äôt even blind killers. I‚Äôve done it once with a killer that was just standing there and letting us farm
---
There are two problems when the community talks balance:
---
1.  People who only play one side aren‚Äôt going to be objective in their opinions.
---
2. People who haven‚Äôt climbed out of low/mid ranks haven‚Äôt experienced top level play.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen people dispute that killers are stronger than survivors at low ranks.  Low rank survs aren‚Äôt good at optimized gameplay and generally don‚Äôt punish killers for mistakes.  Aren‚Äôt great at hiding/chases/etc.
---
The problem is by the time you hit red ranks, in optimized play survivors are absolutely stronger.  Killers are hard pressed to keep the pressure on when any good survivor knows that someone getting injured means ‚Äústick to a gen like glue and get it done.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm mid ranks both sides right now.  Got marched into a rank 16-20 game...I did 4 of the 4.5 gens myself, because people panicked when they saw someone get hit.  If just one other person had done gens when needed, it wouldn‚Äôt have ended in a 4k.  At the speed of the killer, if everyone had performed optimally he would‚Äôve gotten 0
---
Well... I mean... Protecting the gens is tecnically one of your main objectives apart from killing survivor.
---
Yes haha 200 hours of playing killer definitely has made me better at looping hahahaha *sweats profusely*
---
You can't get killed if you kill yourself ;)
---
I really think it‚Äôs match by match, some survivors can outplay the killer very well and the killer gets 0k (especially if it‚Äôs an swf group), but then I‚Äôve also seen killers slaughter every survivor within 1 minute or less as well. It‚Äôs definitely based off of the survivors skill altogether and how well they can work as a group and how well the killer can find and chase survivors, IMO at least.
---
this actually isn't too close to either. The real fun-world ones have small triangles around the bottom as this one has bigger ones, and the real one has no opening that makes it easier to walk, this one has a cut in the robe to reveal his pants underneath. the tassels are identical to the fun-world one. But it's not worth it making it accurate to Scream1/2 with something this close.
---
I just posted an update!
---
Sounds like someone's a salty survivor main, it takes more than just headphones to get kills at higher ranks and no, I don't use prayer beads.
---
Wow!!!
---
The mantra for this sub is swf&gt;killer&gt;solo surv
---
But its pretty survivor sided, even solo as long as everyone understands that if theu are not being chased they should be on a gen and when in chase not to waste pallets the survs should win almost everytime. Yes there are overpowered things on both sides that need to be addressed but just straight up survivor best perks no add ons vs any killer best perks no add ons, the game is survivor sided. The killer can only capitalize on the mistakes of the survivors, they hold all the power over the pace of the game.

IT TAKES ME ON AVERAGE LIKE 5-10 MINUTES TO FIND A DAMN GAME (PS4) ONLY TO HAVE A PUSSY ASS CRYBABY *SURVIVOR* DC BECAUSE THEY'RE ABSOLUTE DOGSHIT! I'M A FUCKING SURVIVOR MAIN JUST TRYING TO DO MY GODDAMN RIFT CHALLENGES BUT CAN'T BECAUSE THE PAST 3 OR SO GAMES IN A ROW THE SURVIVOR HAS DC'D!
---
IF YOU GET TUNNELED AND IMMEDIATELY DC, GO FUCK YOURSELF AND DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! YOU'RE NOT WELCOMED AT ALL IF YOU'RE A LITTLE BITCH BABY SURVIVOR!
---
Also: Killer mains playing solo survivor at literally any rank
---
Instadowna are op! -
---
Said survivors that run exhaustion and meta perks
---
Just hit them. You get points.
---
well yeah obviously. i didnt just mean you get headphones and win instantly. but spirit requires so much little skill that its almost the same.  you need basic killer knowledge and a good sense of hearing and your good to go.
---
jesus christ calm down it's just a video game(tm)
---
Exactly
---
I completed a challenge went to claim it, then the game said an error occured and didn‚Äôt claim it so i restarted the game and it said it was claimed but i didn‚Äôt get the reward and i can‚Äôt start the next one in the chain now.
---
This is clearly a survivor main post, girl I'm getting downvoted for telling the truth. Y'all fucking suck hahaha
---
This has to be the most insecure individual I've ever seen.
---
They do. I was in the end-game lobby where the Survivors were running and when that big old shadow that sometimes covers them appeared, her arms and face glowed.
---
I sometimes hope they have adrenaline. It just makes it a little more fun to chase them around a little more.
---
Thats pretty creative! I would love to see all these chapters in dbd.

I always wonder why some SWF do this with so many gens left, even if they managed to get the save, that's still a LOT of free pressure for the killer.
---
That trappy fella is way better than that big chainsaw fella.

Preach brother.

its just suprising that people this delusional still exist

Cus they're little bitches

That's an actual lie, the last free week was the record highest player count the game has ever had.

Nothing to discuss. All people want to bitch/discuss is noed, ds, adrenaline and toxicity.

why do some people that play spirit often just not confess that she takes little to no skill.  "Get fucked. entitled cunt" just shows how pathetic you are.

Check the pinned post, this type of post is no longer allowed
---
Hail yeah bruther.
---
&gt; but no killer is better than another
---
XD?
---
I think what your trying to say is "at low ranks"? Against shit survivors and even medium skill survivors a killer can 4k easily. They are supposed to be the power role and is their entire thing to actually kill people. A basement bubba against rank 20's could probably get a 4k.
---
At high ranks worse killers are looped easily because they have no antiloop.
---
Wraith gets on someone hits them once and then if the survivor is at a loop it becomes "does the survivor fuck up?" Bubba same, either he fully m2's someone before they get to the loop or they get away.
---
People with anti loop tools like freddy/trapper/argueably ghostface because he loses red stain and terror radius, have an advantage because they can help end loops earlier or outright force them off.
---
Then there are nurses and spirits who just say "Fuck your window/pallet" and kill you anyway because of their inherit abilitys. This isn't to say there is no counterplay, but there is little compared to someone like wraith who you can just run in a circle until he level 2 bloodlusts and you pallet him to reset it.
---
Wow! A leather jacket!
---
All good man cause I don't take this game serious at allüòÇ
---
I disagree. I like it being zoomed up.
---
Buzz looks like he‚Äôs avoiding a flashlight right now ngl
---
Hit one of em, take your bloodpoints and  move on to another game.
---
\*sarcasm on\* he's a tryhard and you should report him for holding the game hostage \*sarcasm off\*
---
Okay cool thanks! My GF mainly plays on her switch now. I'll let her know. Maybe you can't find matches because your rank is pretty good? It hasn't been on switch a long time so there's not a ton of rank 10+ yet. I see a whole lot of 20-17s
---
I don't get why but the killer queues are insanely long on low ranks. It's rare I wait less than 10 minutes for a lobby. And then when I do find one, the survivors are typically 4-7 levels higher than me on average.
---
Like just today I waited about 10 minutes for a lobby and it was rank 8, 9, 16, and 12 survivors and I'm rank 17. It literally takes me over an hour to play 3 games as killer, it's insane how bad the matchmaking is in this game.
---
I also don't understand how I can find a match in rocket league in 5-15 seconds typically but when I'm queued with 3 friends it'll take it 3-5 minutes for us to find a match.
---
Thanks, I hate this.
---
Maybe if the community wasn't AIDS people would feel more welcome too.
---
There are a lot of instances where the killer has no business hitting you through the pallet drop but so many people dont understand that when the pallet drop animation starts is not when the hitbox activates. So a lot of times i see people get upset because they get hit and a stun but what happens is the killer hit you at the start of the throw animation and then is stunned immediately after once the hitbox activates.
---
Then dont play like that then, we all know this games servers blow and it takes long enough to find matches let alone having s killer fucking DC right when your about to get a challenge done then have to restart all over again and wait another 5 minutes.
---
WoahüòÆ
---
I agree. With certain ones I feel that is true. Like sacrifice four survivors in the basement in one game just screams of face camping. I know that it's possible without it as running iron grip or agitation, but how many people are actually gonna throw those on inside of just camping or proxying hard.
---
No, not really. If you don't like the "hateful and rude things" maybe don't click on the post? I don't see the point in defending DC'ing baby killers unless you are one, which you probably are with the way you sound tbh
---
Ya know what, I kinda hesitated last time, so, draw me a Myers  and I'll give you the reward.
---
sounds legit. thanks for this text and you opinion
---
Was going to upvote regardless of when I saw it, but I'm legally obligated to since I'm waiting for a game.
---
I mean the hits aren't miserable in terms of registering anymore. They register when they should. Its just that you gotta make sure you have a medkit, bond, or Self Care on you to make it work
---
I will miss knowing whose killer has the biggest dick
---
Im also a little disappointed that the Elm Street House isnt in Badham.
---
What if they added a Nancy Thompson cosmetic for Laurie? They could add Sydney from Scream that way too. Then they wouldnt have to make new perks and we'd still get Survs we want.
---
The survivor automatically escapes. It helps avoid toxicity.
---
Ya know what? All of these I would love to see in dbd good work!
---
I read this in how their voices sound in Samination's parodies
---
Maybe other players do. It ain't fair for them when they need to complete challenges and people like you fuck them over. If you get pissed off to the point you wanna dc then just drop the controller and go on reddit or some shit that's what I do as a killer who gets pissed off.
---
nah, i click every post in new and browse it very often, for better or for worse. but nah, i never DC as killer, haven't once in my entire 1k+ hours, even if games get really frustrating. DCing sucks and it's stupid, you're just losing all your bloodpoints and wasting your entire queue time by DCing. dunno why people do it.
---
Nope, pc
---
Sorry, I didn't know that. I didn't use this subreddit too often in the last months.
---
What does this have to do with dbd though.
---
Yeah, why are you on the subreddit if you "care so little about the game?"
---
pathetic attempt üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah, thats the point of my rant.
---
who really cares i dc if the killer is laggy too. if they're laggy fuck em i aint dealing with that shit
---
It may not be a bug, but it is definitely a problem that needs solving that they don't want/not worth it to solve, so it was removed.
---
Billy and bubba can easily gain more blood points and no instadowns. Ghostface and Myers could get extended lunge range on top of a movement increase and an increase to gaining bloodlust.
---
Thanks
---
I mainly play it on ps4 but would defo stick to the switch more if the lobby's were more available. Maybe at rank reset it might get better ü§û yeah I played it a lot when it first launched on the switch, moved back to the ps4 tho for the quicker match times.
---
Because the game does not want you to communicate with your team, but people do it anyway and they can't do anything about it
---
Yeah unless there's a DC or I particularly like you; don't expect to be handed an out.
---
big brain move
---
A-bing bing bing
---
The thing I dont like about running both Thrilling and Pop is that they have counter-synergy. If you down someone close to a gen that's almost completed (which GF does all the time since he can sneak) you have to wait like 15 seconds before you can use Pop on that gen and go do other things. Thrilling can be pretty good on some builds but Surveilance should be more than enough gen tracking information. I'd swap it out for something like Sloppy since GF benefits so heavily from people staying injured.
---
Edit: my own personal little rant lol check my post history. I've been tellin pple to not stalk with Ghostface and use that build literally since they fixed his reveal mechanics. Hell, I was literally the Twitch sub that told him to use the build for the first time when Tru3 was still calling GF C-tier because the stalk wasnt that good. Now suddenly Tru3 posts 25 videos on it and it magically becomes "meta". Lol i obviously get that he has thousands of followers and I'm just some random dude on the internet yada-yada but I can't help but feel like a bit of a hipster here.
---
Yep, can confirm. I started struggling around rank 6 with most killers but one: Spirit. 
---
Switched to Spirit. Easy mode. Even without PB. I faced so many of them as a rank 1 survivor, I know how those bitches play. Thanks for teaching me, Spirit mains. 
---
Seriously though, I let most escape. I was just doing my challenges. Always used a BPS or Pestula. I only had to kill them all once in a trial. Oh and all the tbaggers died too. It was fun playing as killer, but really stressful. I missed so many hits lol. I might actually play killer more often now. I amassed like 750k bloodpoints in 3 hours. It‚Äôs insane with BBQ and BPS and Pestula and Bloodhunt. Holy shit. 165k blood points in one match? I‚Äôll take it. Never gotten that many points as a survivor before lol.
---
Edit
---
As a survivor main, I also had this very deep empathetic feeling towards survivors when I was playing as killer. I know how it feels like to be a in certain situation, hopeless and frustrated. I always played for real, never camped or tunneled, always left the hook after hooking someone. I fucking hate killers who hook someone and then ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to go away, only to come back 2 seconds later or right as you unhook the person. You have perks to locate other survivors. BBQ. Surveillance. Whispers. Which gens were last worked on? Etc. Why the fuck do you come back? You‚Äôre an asshole and shit killer if you do that. Just find someone else. Most rank 1 killers do that. That‚Äôs so trashy. I also never slugged. If they find the hatch, good. I don‚Äôt need a 4K every god damn game. Fuck most streamers for slugging because they feel like they‚Äôre entitled for a 4K.
---
Thank God!! Those were so annoying/cringe
---
Clintons displeased
---
I do pretty much the same thing, que wait then give up and move to survivor. I think it's just normal for killer que times to be longer with the new servers. It might also be the event currently running.
---
i feel like they are typically balanced but it‚Äôs never the same each trial.
---
for example, if you‚Äôre going against a bloody nurse with good add-ons, good perks &amp; an ebony mori and all you‚Äôve got is a brown toolbox and deja vu, you‚Äôre probably not going to survive.
---
if you go against a toxic swf with the whole package and you‚Äôre just a wraith using unrelenting, it‚Äôs not going to work out.
---
so, you must find a good middle ground.
---
the way i see it, if you‚Äôre going to be a super toxic swf, expect the killer to equip a mori and ultra rare add-ons.
---
if it‚Äôs just a group of random feng mins and a jeff johansen with a brown toolbox, you really don‚Äôt need to start packing on the iridescent head &amp; ebony mori.
---
it‚Äôs super hard to tell if the other side is going to play non-sweaty, but i find just playing with your favorite perks and dodging toxic lobbies will prevent you (most of the time) by having what‚Äôs considered an unfair game.
---
I‚Äôve seen it mostly used for telling someone to come to you. Sometimes I‚Äôll do a single wave when the killer is coming back to tell survivors to hold up but there‚Äôs no effective way to communicate to other survivors while on the hook.
---
Because there's never been a chat in-game, just in-lobby. You have never been supposed to chat with teammates, as that makes the game infinitely easier and borderline unfair, in some cases. That is the point, do you see why *you're* clueless?
---
For me, I was a pure survivor main for a bit, ( got 4 survs to prestige) and when I went to try killer I guess playing as survivor taught me a few tricks as I was beating rank 12s as a rank 17/18 killer (also why tf am i being put with such a big rank difference, both survivor and killer)
---
Sorry yeah my bad, Wasn't reading properly.
---
Never dc. Just get through the trial.
---
Ultimately generators are the goal of the game so if you can always be doing a generator. I sometimes challenge myself to play Captain Save a Survivor and run an ultra altruistic build so I can save people and help everyone escape. I guess it depends on how you like to play.
---
Good on ya. Looping is going to be very useful for you once you get good with it!
---
That's more of a bug. And I don't have that issue so... Yeah
---
IMO, killer should be OP. That gives a proper amount of encouragement and fear and challenge playing survivor. No matter what killer's will have issues against a decent 4man, swf or not.
---
As someone who enjoys playing survivor more cause you can dick around and just kind of be at ease?  The hatch is the dumbest mechanic in the game. The whole Endgame Collapse is really stupid in actuality. 
---
I mean 3ks are technically fine and you won't die if you don't get the 4k, but the fact that closing the hatch ultimately does nothing because they made the doors so fast and unless you're a high mobility killer you risk them getting out anyways is pretty stupid.
---
Year of the wolf event from a couple years ago
---
I may or may not have downed myself to body block the killer long enough for a teammate to escape
---
And I may or may not have been healed instead of hooked
---
I think it should just have some kind of downside. Personally I think thats a problem with all of Spirits VR add-ons in that they all just straight up boost her already good power with no negative impact at all.
---
Maybe make it so she can't hear while phasing, you will still be able to gen grab and can still follow scratch marks, but this will also knock down it's combo effectiveness with the mom-daughter ring in that you're getting rid of almost all your tracking ability for significantly faster movement and removal of your vacuum
---
Yeah killer que times are always so long I just have something on the side usually
---
Reddit is nearly unreadable because every other post is this exact thing...
---
IDK why this is downvoted, it's objectively true lol
---
Here's my problem with everyone who says this.
---
If I jumped on killer now and repeatedly camped my first hook, I would happily bet that out of 10 matches played, I would never get less than 2 kills and there would most definitely be some 3 and 4 kills in there. I would say I am more likely to get a 3/4K than just a 1K.
---
Only a 4 man SWF will have the benefit of immediately knowing the killer is camping, and even taking this advantage to do gens, unless they manage to complete all gens by the time the hooked guy dies, someone else is 100% going on a hook.
---
Not to mention, in the majority of killer matches I play, once I have killed one survivor with gens still left to do, I often kill the rest as they rarely can manage to finish the last gen as a threesome. 
---
The balance shift between Killer Vs 4 and Killer Vs 3 is massive.
---
I honestly didnt feel like sloppy didnt really do much for me unless i had nurses, which i didn't have at the time so i dropped it.
---
I did sometimes have negative synergy but it wasn't that often.
---
Anxiety in a nutshell
---
They should change it to 3. While 3 is still hard, I‚Äôve definitely done it before.
---
&gt;  those kind of post every day
---
Basement trapper time.
---
Try writing a story together. Start with, "once upon a time..." and take turns filling it in until the game begins. Doesn't always work, but it's better than nothing.
---
Yeah I feel that. I want to give this game money but not when I can't even play! Hopefully it sets itself straight soon.
---
If you dc period. Not just killers.
---
Yep, I got to purple ranks recently for the first time and I'm pleased, now I'm doing good at looping.
---
&gt;ng is high still since your not dead, but your chances of surviving is almost zero unless the killer got extremely lucky. Being on 2nd hook is huge if its not at least a gen into the game. That basically means if the killer comes for you again your probably just dead
---
I can have a little bit more respect for a killer dc than a survivor dc and I'm a survivor main. Whenever I play killer (I've been more because of the archives) I meet so many toxic survivors and I just want to dc but since I got the spirit and shes rank 30 I can sorta handle them now. But I can't make an argument for a survivor to dc.
---
Im not receiving my Auric Cells on Xbox (my Rift auric cells)
---
Just happened to me, nurse quit on us because we powered the gates before anyone got sacraficed. Didn't count towards my challenge.
---
Does anybody know why I'm getting downvotes on this comment?
---
Yeah maybe. I feel like with more people playing I should be getting in killer games much sooner (or at all).
---
You missunderstand me. She totaly Skips this phase if she draws someone from generator/Window or smth like that. Thats should not be possible. There are no other Killers/Survivors that can Skip Animations, arent there?
---
Literally this! I feel this way about the old lobby perspective too! I can't even see what my team are bringing in :'(
---
Approved toxicity confirmed
---
Can‚Äôt see this ever happening with how matchmaking is now. It‚Äôs rare I ever get in a good match that feels balanced, and even if I did get into one it wouldn‚Äôt be as fun to play against the same person.
---
Dbd is a multiplayer game, so you usually have to refer to other players, and as there is no way to know their gender, OP made a joke about how to address the situation. Hope this politics doesn't ruin your gaming experience

"low effort required"? Like making memes or clips or screenshots is requiring so much effort

Just don't farm. Not everyone likes farming. If I get a farming killer I'll DC if they try to force me to farm even when me or someone else brings BPS. Farming killers wastes my time and I just want to get the game over with when I get in a match with one.
---
... the title .....
---
What are you talking about? That's a legitimate hit! /s
---
Except when you had to constantly make new lobbies when you played with anyone else. Or make a separate lobby to enter the SWF lobby. 
---
I don't get how the old lobby is being seen in a positive light tbh
---
They should fix the dedicated servers first before implementing all this new stuff imo, and fix the matchmaking cause im against rank18 killers while im rank 4 no fun for them or me :/
---
As minimal as it is, I would love to be able to see other players rotating their characters. It would add some personality to the lobby screens while we all wait 5 years for our next match.
---
I like it because it's nice to play both, but hate it because I suck so much at survivor I could make my killer self look good
---
SWF should give killers bonus BP and possible the option to fight them or not.
---
Should be optional
---
Understandable but if it‚Äôs a double bloodpoints event and one or two people bring BPS I‚Äôd at least try and farm I wouldn‚Äôt want to force someone into farming my goal isn‚Äôt to ruin people‚Äôs games lol
---
Literally only actually viable DLC killer is Spirit. Huntress, Billy and Nurse are up there. So no, you don‚Äôt have to buy any of them.
---
Because it's Reddit lol
---
Are you using the Mirror Shard addon?
---
*Evil Within II reveals the Aura of Survivors who have been stalked for at least 1 second.*

*Aura stays visible for a duration of 5 seconds.*
---
I have done all 4 at end game... It was glorious. Almost let one go but they decided to blind me when I let them go. Hatchet to the face cleared that up.
---
 How can I have this forever
---
For playing the game the way a majority of people also play it..? Apparently I've been exposed!
---
I think that if there is a workaround for SWF that is as huge (and as simple) as discord then everyone should just have equal access, don't be a dolt.
---
Yeah most of the meta killers are base game ones.
---
Nah. Billy is a top tier killer, huntress is great too and nurse is still one of the best killers, the fact that you don¬¥t like her ability is subjective and her being hard to play is not a problem, best killers should not be easy to play. 
---
The fact that you talk about killers like doctor, clown or legion as so great just shows that you lack knowledge about this game.
---
You use shards to buy their perks, not whole killers.
---
I think they are just not that experienced in the game to know that, and maby they whant to go for the flashy plays. But if the killer knows what they are doing they will punish it.
---
Even in this sub I can't escape r/meirl
---
Well yeah but new challenges are coming out, I think the next set (or levels I think they're called?) comes out on the 16th.
---
I agree with what you said, but I do agree with removing collision because then the Spirit player has to be more precise
---
Dont feel like reporting threats every second game XD
---
If all these leaked challenges are true and won't change, then I probably won't enjoy the archives as a whole, especially if they just get progressively harder like this to the point where you have to purposefully throw the game to MAYBE get them or just hope people farm with you.
---
Flashlight saves are easy lol
---
Not just hook, but sacrifice them. Meaning they have to die while hooked in the basement, and just 1 dc will ruin it.
---
you know that the devs also need to earn money and get paid for their work? And as u said u can buy non licensed dlcs with shards, u don't actually need to buy it with real money plus one killer only costs 5$ and nurse(the best killer in the game) is free... so its not P2W
---
So your point is not being nice=dc ? If you dc when killers are not nice damn you are dcing too much dude. You don't need to be nice or a piece of shit both requires effort. I don't camp or tunnel on purpose, but i don't give the hatch to the last when i play killer. When i play survivor i do gens loop and then leave. People really like to think if you are not something then you are opposite of that thing.
---
I want all of these, looks amazing
---
Don't DC, just point at a hook (90% of farming killers will hook you if you do this) and kill yourself on the hook. Don't rob a farmer of their BBQ stack.
---
After him they said Leatherface, specifically his add-ons. He's likely gonna get a complete new set of add-ons that are not copy-paste Hillbilly things. And Acceleration is gonna get tweaked so it actually works
---
Same I always rotate to look at my friends like ''Hiiii'' then I'm like ''oh wait they can't see that'' :(
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand the remove collision argument, but I think that plus the other things I mentioned would be too much, and if you took away one of those other things it may be too little. That's just my own opinion though, other people have different thoughts on her.
---
Oh the cringe, move on to the next game man

Too many people called me a hacker for teleporting while I was using the spirit

Survivor Pudding: A heavily salted pudding....
---
You don't need to get the stun, making this challenge not as bad as you think.
---
You're playing as Nea. That explains the low altruism at least.
---
Yeah all I could think was ''we need a bug type killer'' lol
---
Discord IS equal access. It's not like it's an invite-only program, don't be a dolt. And if anything, it's better. You get to call with people you know aren't annoying and don't have to bother muting the annoying ones. I, for one, would much rather play completely solo than listen to teammates I don't know. I never use mics in game so for me, the way it's set up is fine. Don't like it? Get Discord.
---
Not to mention, if they actually implemented it, they'd be adding to the severe disadvantage that Killers already have in that realm. The game is easier when people use Discord, so if they added a voice feature, they'd be hurting their own game by making it easier for ALL Survivors (even the ones who don't use Discord), effectively pissing off and potentially driving away Killer mains.
---
Also, I think it'd just go against the idea of the game anyway. Lost in the fog, alone, no technology; how the hell do you hear me across the map but the killer doesn't? Am I shouting through the fog? Nah. The game itself is fine, if we want extra voice features just get Discord. It's simple and you're getting butthurt about something that is actually the opposite of the point of the game.
---
Man, I pointed at the killer after my first experience with one having let me finish the last gen and open the gate as a way of trying to thank him (I play om the Switch, so no post game chat), and the other survivor with me clicked the flashlight and teabagged. I felt horrible about that.  Killer downed us both, but still let us escape.  Good to know now that that was a bad move on my part as well...
---
Somebody needs counseling
---
Here's what I think: She no longer has collision while phasing. Injured survivor noises are omnidirectional. No matter how long she uses Haunt, the gauge will be emptied.
---
You could Xpost it to traaaaaa, with "transition goals". They would probably enjoy it
---
The huntress is unreliable because he ability‚Äôs hit box is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen and the nurse is good yes , I didn‚Äôt say she was bad I said that I found her hard to use so I don‚Äôt play her
---
don't forget their shitty comments back in the lobby.
---
Its easier than unhooking 3 people in endgame collapse
---
Exactly! ‚ÄúGG EZ‚Äù
---
And as far as prayer beads: When exiting haunt, your terror radius and red stain are supressed for 15 seconds, and survivors continue to hear the phasing sound for the 15 seconds
---
Well it‚Äôs bugged for me and I can‚Äôt complete challenges so whatever
---
Like not doing totems?
---
yeah queue times at rank 17-20 are extremely long but you notice them shorten as you get to 16,15,14 and so on. I‚Äôm 10 at the moment and it only take me a minute max
---
This is actually not the box, this is the pig putting a trap on another survivor which is mirrored on survivors which already have it. Had in in my match today.
---
Love it WE NEED IT
---
Ah how could I forget that each killer (12 of them) only cost 5$ making the dlcs cost more than the game (half of them are licensed to)
---
That's great, but I'd love a source.
---
Edit: I found the source!

For anyone that doesn't want to read it, it talks about crossplay between the Steam version and the Xbox Gamepass version for PC only. At the moment there's no ETA for console crossplay, but they did mention wanting to do give consoles the same treatment.
---
I avoid making friends in this game. It holds the danger of finding people like you.
---
No. I'm not. I was using a memorial flower and a hairbrush the whole time.
---
I rarely get to play the game these days and getting a farming killer is just a massive punch to my face. I bought the game to play the game.
---
Waaagghhh‚Äôing intensifies
---
I only give hatch if I feel like they deserve it. Otherwise, tough shit.
---
Gotta practice your aim. Her hitboxes are not that terrible. 
---
Well your arguments were that you *have to* buy the DLC to have strong killers. Nurse is a strong killer and she is free, so the above is not true. The fact that she is hard or that you don¬¥t like her is another issue entirely.
---
If you *really* cannot stand any of the free killers, the DLCs regularly go for sale for about 5 dollars, so if you want to pick up one that you like more, do it. It costs less than a pizza...
---
It‚Äôs not always about who‚Äôs the best but also who‚Äôs fun to play and I‚Äôd like to be able to just play more killers . I would be ok grinding the game for shards but 9000 each ? That‚Äôs just plain stupid

- godlike in the basement,
---
- good add-ons,
---
- very strong 3-gen,
---
- high skill cap, 
---
- decent teachables, 
---
- needs little time to learn, 
---
Cons:
---
- has to collect all his traps,
---
- visible traps can easily be disarmed, sabotaged,
---
- can by default carry only one trap,
---
- has to give up a few gens to set the traps, 
---
- needs much time to master, 
---
 
---
Leatherface:
---
- can insta-down, 
---
- punishes survivors' mistakes, 
---
- can easily protect hooks, 
---
- godlike in the basement, 
---
- can quickly break pallets, 
---
- great teachables, 
---
- needs little time to master
---
Cons: 
---
- easily looped, 
---
- very few chainsaw mindgames possible, 
---
- slower when using chainsaw, 
---
- low skill cap, 
---
- easily countered by pallets and windows, 
---
- mostly bad add-ons, 
---
So, LF is probably better at low ranks, while Trapper can even be used at red ranks, if you master him and the use of traps. LF has nothing to help him prevent looping as he will just be stunned while preparing chainsaw or will just bump into something. For teachables clearly go LF.
---
Geez trigger warning before mentioning that name next time üòÇ
---
What is gen rushing? How is do the gens as quickly as possible bad in any way?
---
Noooo my killer family trees.
---
If you like the pressure of playing killer just play survivor and intentionally have the killer chase you, you‚Äôll be able to keep tabs on the pallets, loops and killer distance. With good perks and tactics you‚Äôll be able to run the killer for a long time unlike Jeffrey Epstein who was unable to outrun his killer
---
I've seen this theory in other threads, and it sounds plausible.
---
I just can‚Äôt see it happening. Most people have a set up that they stick to. So unless everyone changes their perks, then they risk the chance of the other people knowing what they have and reducing their effectiveness. I do agree it would be fun, but if you‚Äôre playing against the same people again it‚Äôs because they were fun to play with (most likely at least as good as you are) then you also risk the chance of them gaining better understanding of how you play the game and then getting better at killing you lol. Or vice versa
---
Nurse's is extremely strong on Ghostface. Smart survivors won't heal in the terror radius (Since the 32 meter TR is very close to the 28 meter nurses calling radius) and since Ghostface has no TR in stealth mode you can easily catch people healing.
---
I find someone and spin. If it doesn't work then find another survivor. Never force anyone to farm though.
---
Cute! ü§ó
---
Never? Servers for pc are still being tested and updated and switch even has servers
---
Even worse, you have to leave your lobby to select a challenge from the archives. What the diddly fuck is this horse shit?
---
I was getting instant games late last night, weird.  Maybe my elo is just low though.
---
Better yet, give us the options to freely add things into a map to test them out. I think all of us know what Lithe does but to little DanielIsGaming2001 who is playing the game for the first time, it would be cool of him to read what it says, put himself into a situation in that map to get Lithe to activate and see just what it does. Even better, you know how the medkits got changed? It would of been great to jump into a map, spawn in a survivor who is injured, and then heal them to see the affect. I mean Super Smash Bros has it. You're allowed to set what playstyle the bot has. Be it offensive, defensive, or just standing still. Hell, some of us just want to see what gets changed in patch notes. It would be a hell of a lot easier to see that rather than getting lucky and seeing it for a brief moment before a serious issue rises.
---
That‚Äôs an oof
---
I love it when this happens with teams i let escape because they were no challenge to me at all so i felt bad and didn't want to completely demolish them, just get my 2 hooks each and move on, only to get flamed in post game. 
---
Doesn't really bother me, i just find it hilarious: Imagine being too stupid to even realize the killer was going easy on you, right? But then again, these people write childish "insults" in post game chat so...
---
No my goal isn‚Äôt to ruin people games it‚Äôs to find some people that want the extra BP. If I ever ran into a farming killer I‚Äôd love it.
---
and I‚Äôll upvote every single one
---
They nerfed insta-heals and changed some medkits and add-ons.
---
i've heard of being at the end of my rope, but this is ridiculous!
---
Or the even more difficult one "Completely repair 4 generators using the perk Dark Sense (in a single game) or" Unhook 3 survivors after the endgame collapse has begun. Must unhook them safely (in a single game)
---
Everything it's a whole new game
---
Steamcharts shows around 45-50k ppl playing so jt's more about the matchmaking/servers sadly..I also get 9+mins ques while playing killer.
---
Get good /s. 
---
Seriously bhvr. Get on this asap.
---
Because turning every solo queue game into a coordinated team would be stupid
---
Freddy was [finally reworked](https://youtu.be/FlAvTQvkGCk) and went from the "Worst Killer in DBD" (Which I disagree with) to one of the strongest M1 killers in the game with strong chase potential and high mobility in exchange for losing his tracking and stall.
---
(PC)
---
Holidays events items do not affect progression to daily rituals. 
---
Brought in a toolbox in a match, picked up someone‚Äôs Halloween flashlight and escaped and my DR says I didn‚Äôt do it.
---
I dont care much of survivors perks as Killer main, but for Killer ones solutions are pretty obvious:
---
**Surge:** Effect is mapwide for explosion and regression on gens, additional regression of 10% applies to gens in Killer's Terror radius.
---
Thus Surge will be synergised with other Killer perks like: Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, M&amp;A, Distressing. Also soft-counters tricks with 99-ing gens at far corners of map in the end of game.
---
**Cruel Limits:** Effect applies not to the area of finished gen, which in most cases is empty zone in a seconds, but to Survivor(s) who finished gen, similar to Doctor's Shock debuff - cant vault, cant drop pallets. Duration is same as now.
---
**Mindbreaker:** Exhaustion builds-up up to 20 seconds duration while working on gen, has no gen percentage restriction, existing exhaustion from other sources stops from lifting while working on gen. Mindbreaker exhaustion can be lifted while running.
---
Thank fucking God
---
Try maturing your sense of humour?
---
How is it different against wraith?
---
It's come from the same people that say that facecamping and tunneling is a fair and balanced strategy
---
Eh, survivors got 2 SUPER difficult ones
---
It would be like that spongebob episode where he ends up only writing 'The' xD
---
Sorry, but no. I have had games where I'm literally running meme perks and an off meta killer, dont tunnel or anything. People will tbag no matter what. People get a kick out of feelings of power, and tbagging an all powerful killer will give that to you. People are assholes.
---
I plat‚Äôd the game and I‚Äôm as average as they come. What a fool.
---
Theres really not much of a difference though.
---
Yeah like how the fuck are you supposed to get that??
---
Splain?
---
Everytime their butt goes down thats an additional second I stay near their hook.
---
What about a chapter a bit like the Plague with an ancient map and a killer like The Pharaoh or The Mummy
---
For the love of Entity, can the devs fix the car loop in Autohaven's :)
---
Hm let‚Äôs see new Freddy not sure if that‚Äôs before or after his rework, new status effects recently, new map the underground facility other than that not much more I can think of
---
This hurts to watch lmao
---
Some of the level 4 challenges depend COMPLETELY on luck.
---
It sucks for my colorblind friend. He has to use predator to be able to see scratch marks which is always one less perk slot
---
Very specific lucky timing, swf and a killer that doesnt camp i guess :/
---
I don‚Äôt play nurse, so it probably isn‚Äôt too different, just more difficult. But still, it bothers me that they changed her base power.
---
Is it just me or is the voice acting for steve not very good? I literally laugh when I hook Steves because hes like "HUUEEEEEEEEE" and it just cracks me up. It sounds so fake
---
All right, good to know.
---
I've had killer queues up to 20 mins its awful
---
Oh God yes, constantly getting caught on that thing while being chased!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/doikq8/started_imagining_some_original_killers_again_i/ It's here in my part one it's the first one I thought about :D
---
- The Doctor can teleport now.
---
- The Trapper can place traps inside of lockers.
---
- The Wraith can hide in lockers.
---
- "Nea" hs been changed to "The Nea".
---
- The Clown has faster movement speed.
---
- Insta heals have been nerfed.
---
- NOED Now grants the ability of flight.
---
- Sloppy butcher makes you start the trial as Leatherface now.
---
All I can remember rn.
---
Also the killer has to hook instead of slugging
---
If you cannot enforce a rule then it shouldn't be a rule, just even the playing field
---
Insulting
---
Slacktivism at its finest
---
Not pinhead. The teeth being like that is 100% chatterbox
---
I literally just watched my friend who was rank 17 play and get 3 games around midnight last night, i dont see how your failing to get games at peak hours beyond not waiting long enough. It takes him like 8~ or so minutes.
---
Ooh those are pretty cool! Keep doing these, your ideas are great
---
That is not a problem for an ace main
---
Good to hear it's not just the "normal" Ps4
---
Her base power changed to allow more counterplay tbh, i dont mind it but it probably hurts as a nurse player
---
Freddy got a huge rework to his ability. He can put down speed-slowing snares, teleport to generators and instantly put Survivors to sleep by smacking them.
---
Nurse got nerfed, her blinks have to charge after blinking now and her add-ons have been completely changed from what they used to be.
---
Instaheals are basically gone now. The styptic agent gives you Borrowed Time instead of healing you and the syringe heals you by one health state after 16 seconds.
---
Badham Preschool also has four different variants now. 
---
The Rift is basically Dead by Daylight's battle pass. It allows you to unlock cosmetics by completing challenges in the Tome or by levelling up. There's a free and paid version of it.
---
The Tome gives you some challenges to complete (i.e. succeed 20 skill checks, damage 6 generators, ect.) to earn Bloodpoints and Rift Fragments needed to level up the Rift. You can also unlock lore logs and cinematics by completing these challenges.
---
There's also new cosmetics called Charms that you can unlock via the Tome and the Rift, which are basically these small little trinkets that you can put on your Survivors or Killers.
---
I find it easier to now loop a nurse than before LOL
---
Good to know it isnt just me who cant blind hags. I guess its ok because the flashlight just counters her power which is more important
---
or just, remembering where the totems are in general.
---
People seem to forget that you're sacrificing a perk slot for NOED, and you can easily just do totems and make it a 3 perk killer game. 
---
Hell, they even added perks to make cleansing happen more often. (Nancy Heal for one)
---
Underrated? I dunno man a lot of my squad frequently uses it and I personally rarely don't use it.

Its just you, I've checked the rest of the sub and it hasn't been reported at all. /s
---
I love you so much. Couldn‚Äôt find an effective way to check SoS, other than Reddit and Instagram. But neither tell me what the perk does, so if idk what it is I‚Äôm screwed lol.
---
he can get flashed super easy, like you dont even need to hit his eyes
---
Ye, as I said. It was justified, but I don‚Äôt agree with them changing her base power after being the same for so long.
---
Have you ever hit/hooked Feng before?
---
You have lots of faith in this community. People still think flashlights are OP and that Odd bulb sapphire lens is the best add on combination. To expect them to look at a wall when picking up someone or to look up after getting blinded at a pallet is very hopeful
---
Just tried to find a game for killer and I just gave up after 40 mins (PC). Not gonna spend any money on the game until they fix killer queues
---
I meant this challenge. The killers are gonna have to put up with every survivor spamming a flashlight.
---
It's a joke, none of that happened.
---
Actually, the instaheals *did* get nerfed, but besides that it's not true.
---
I feel sorry for you
---
You dont need to
---
Killer rules...
---
Never camp the hook unless the doors have been opened.
---
If you teabag mid chase then I'll leave you on the ground if I manage to down you. Repeat if they do it again once they get up and healed.
---
Survivor rules...
---
Always help when you can.
---
Never teabag unless it's 100% justified.
---
That's pretty much my rules. Apart from those I play how I want to.
---
**BHVR:** Hey players! It's Boodhunt, come get them sweet BPs!  
---
**Also BHVR:** Would be a terrible shame if the servers would act up...
---
One item
---
will-o-wisp
---
God I hope they reduce these endgame challenges, if it was 3 it would be fair, but four? Same with the Killer ones
---
Well...
---
+Killer rule: train yourself to handle stress. 
---
The reason why this is an important rule is because being a killer is a lot more stressful than being a Survivor due to all the micromanaging.
---
Another rule of thumb for that is if you're going to run ruin prepare for the worst if it gets broken within the first 30 seconds of the match 
---
+Survivor rule: don't try to be a hero.
---
This basically translates to don't always try to save them immediately off the hook. Especially if the Killer is right there and you don't have borrowed time. Also if the Killer is camping just punish him by doing generators which also translates to don't be a hero because this is not the game for that.
---
Those are my two rules. Has a killer train yourself to handle stress and a Survivor don't try to always be a hero because you you might wind up dead
---
Steve may be loud but have you heard the Wraith when he drops a survivor?
---
So we come to the subreddit to piss our time away. Hello fellow queue-balls hows life treating you today!
---
My friend would have an easy time with this he saved a Tapp from a hook 2 times in a row with a light.
---
Doesn't predator make the scratch marks closer together? That would definitely make it harder for me to track since I can barely see the marks sometimes
---
Aw damn, I was in a different game. Same legion skin and map though but we all died.
---
It doesnt affect killers so its fine
---
We might get a lot more of these lobbies now and i find it understandable
---
O_o
---
Okay I'm sorry I can understand it if he said complete two generators completely or maybe even three but there's no way in hell you're doing four
---
Nice mindgame killer and fake breaking pallet xD gg wp
---
No, I understood.  The issue is if she did fatigue, it would be an objective punishment if she got the grab.  Seeing as the grab would go off, then the fatigue.  The survivor would likely get to start struggling during the fatigue, meaning she'd have less time than any other killer to get to a hook, and since she's the slowest killer already, there's even more chance to wiggle off from a grab.  Even if the survivor couldn't start wiggling until she recovered, that gives other survivors more time to get in position to get the person off, and since she's already picked up she's more vulnerable to well-placed/timed flashlights than any other killer.
---
In short, yes she skips the fatigue animation, but the alternative would make it so it was a punishment to grab someone, as opposed to just doing a normal hit and picking up after.
---
My only rule:
---
Play as I wish with zero fucks given.
---
Yes, but since the color is the problem not the shapes he can see the difference on the ground since it kinda makes a path. Idk I'm not the color blind one but I know it helped him so maybe others can get some use out of it too
---
Sorry
---
I have the right to hate pug, he has showcased many times that he is toxic as shit. You are obi just someone in his chat that constantly sucks him off.
---
I've already accepted the fact that I'll stop doing these challenges by tome level 3-4. Right now at level one, I may need to equip a specific perk or change up my gameplay a bit to achieve some of these, but nothing too drastic.
---
From what I've seen at lvl 4, I will need to dedicate stretches of games in (slim) hopes of getting these done.
---
As someone with limited play time due to a full time job and family, fuck that.
---
Oh absolutely. I‚Äôm not one to rant about micro transactions because that‚Äôs just the way of gaming today, but the second a game goes full blown anti-consumer with them is when I‚Äôm out. And this is see through enough to know that it‚Äôs anti-consumer
---
I remember it, but within the past few years I've probably played survivor like twice so it wasnt too useful.
---
BHVR will make us a second market and focus on China sooner or later, just watch.
---
Claudette is a great survivor for people like me who have a tendency to suck at chases as a survivor and therefore need as much stealth as possible plus I don‚Äôt use Claudette to be toxic.
---
Haven't played Nurse that much since one and a half years. So even I, as a Legacy 3 Nurse, currently suck on her. That's simply because she is very reliant to muscle memory and even our muscles tend to forget things which ain't in use pretty often.
---
But I was obviously reffering to good Nurses there. Good Nurses didn't need Ruin at all as you immediately start to applying pressure by already having someone on the hook within the first minute of the game. In addition to BBQ being abusive as hell on her and Billy, you used to snowball pretty damn fast. You just had to be good enough to render chases as short as possible while not sucking against stealth. But that's why you almost always go for anti-stealth / tracking perks on her. For a really good Nurse that slot for ANC, Whispers, M&amp;A, or even something like Bloodhound, can be just as good as Ruin. 
---
Atleast that is what it's used to be like, now that her mobillity is more limited and thus her being overall less time efficient. I'd dare to say that even amongst the best Nurses, Ruin will probably become mendatory now.
---
I feel the same, as a survivor i usually don't wiggle when i'm the last one, but i don't expect them to give me the hatch.
---
And as a killer i only give them the hatch if i notice they are like new to the game or if the match was sh*t like 2 dc's at the start or something
---
You mean you didnt get camped by a cannibal?
---
No, they shouldn't. But one bad thing does not erase another.
---
This is part of the reason why I can only play DbD in bursts. I have managed to get every achievement, I have 1000 hours, maybe 70/30 killer/survivor but I just don't understand the toxicity that this game harbours, in almost every area.
---
Imagine if the game started with no post-game chat, imagine if you *never* new who the killer was, even who the other survivors were. Even that alone could cool some of the toxicity.
---
It's so tragic how, if a killer doesn't get a 4K, they will get absolutely fucking blasted because "killer supposed to kill." Makes me feel bad for newer killers, honestly.
---
more like
---
Me as Huntress throwing hatchet across open area: Hatchet somehow hits the tree branch 7 feet up above the hatchet.
---
I've had to do 4 or even all 5 before, but that's usually only if the rest of my team is completely potato. Doesn't happen very often though
---
That's a good idea. Lorewise it could be like that survivor lost all their hope so the entity took them out.
---
Not today, no.
---
I think you just need to have the perk equipped
---
I am Legacy P3 Nurse, but I don't like to play her atm. Not because she is weak or anything, but she feels really bad to play on dedicated servers that I don't enjoy playing her right now.
---
True, but it is nice to be able to waste a little more time against a good nurse. I do feel a bit bad for nurse players though.
---
what a cute baby hag
---
I'm actually ok with it, honestly.
---
"I don't like you either!"- random drunk guy, **Star Wars: A New Hope**
---
Killer Rule 1:  Only farm if 2 people salty DC early into the game. Other than that, no rules all tryhard.
---
Survivor Rule 1: Do gens and unhook later. Not all random teammates deserve to be saved. 
---
Survivor Rule 2: If there is 2 of us left, I wait on hatch for the random to die.
---
Survivor Rule 3: If the randoms suck, I let them die on hook.
---
There was a tournament just yesterday. Nurse still wasn't allowed add-ons or more than two perks. Nurse still dominated.
---
Nurse is still a broken design at her very core, and absolutely still the most deadly and overpowered killer.
---
With his murder?
---
At least we can still level up the rift....
---
Rules any other player makes doesn't exist. I follow the dev rules and thats it, like everyone should.
---
With the memes.
---
You have to land 3 great skill checks with it while injured as far as I‚Äôm aware since being in the injured state is what has it be active.
---
Notice me sempi
---
I've got against SWF like this once. They popped 4 party streamers and had 4 instaheals. I've tried to play as fair as I possibly could (didn't tunnel, camp etc even once), got 3 kills, everyone had at least 12k points. And there was 1 of them in postgame chat with whole thing: "WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T YOU FARM WITH US YOU SHIT". Got me thinking - is this even okay? Like, they assume I HAVE to farm if they want to farm. Dafuq. Still think I wasn't wrong.
---
I think it will be ‚Äúthe alchemist‚Äù and maybe the power is ‚Äúthe hunger‚Äù
---
Play to win, try not to be a jerk about it.
---
what platform do you play on?
---
Should they increase the amount of bloodpoints too? Maybe like 1000? What's ur thoughts?
---
Same thing about Myers xD One touch-one kill. Impossible! :D
---
Thats what I thought, I was just really hoping I didnt have to be injured lol wanted the easy way out üòÖ
---
"what to do about this?" 
---
Walk at them?
---
Or you know expose them like ghostface can?
---
This is false information.
---
You just need to equip it. No need to be injured. 3 greats in 1 game with it equipped.
---
Try aiming center mass (middle of the chest), without add ons and proper timing, maybe a little practice, you will start getting the hang of it.
---
It takes practice. Also you only really get one shot bc most killers will be watching out for it even more when it's been tried once. So don't be the one chasing a killer around the whole match, I get survivors who follow me around most of the match and when I pick up a survivor facing a wall or tree they shine it into my ear, it's not productive.
---
But run empathy if you're specifically looking to position yourself for saves, running up behind the killer after a down is also very easy to hear.
---
I thought that said carrying 2 survivors like oh god imagine a Juggernaut killer that could do that D:
---
Everyones entitled time their own opinions, and this is coming from someone who DOES play both sides and AGREES with that statement. Yet at the end of the day people can say what they want
---
you just have to have it equipped. I wondered the same thing and all it took was the three great skill checks, you don‚Äôt have to be injured.
---
The downside to it is that she can no longer sneak up on surivors because they will know she‚Äôs phasing
---
Because they are when combined with the addon that gives them 3 hatchets, that's undeniable.
---
I suck at it too xD
---
Best button
---
I‚Äôm interested in watching it but parts 1 and 2 just don‚Äôt seem half as interesting as what I‚Äôve seen of parts 3 4 and 5, will it be bad if I skip 1 and 2?
---
Spray it with pesticide
---
Bubba, king of basements, would like to have a word with you
---
Tell it to slap mine too
---
I was too, but I think you just gotta rotate it dude.
---
Obviusly it's not a dwight
---
If it'd be a dwight the locker would have swallowed all blood and scratchmarks
---
Apparently, Kingdom Hearts doesn't exist. ‚îê(¬¥ÔΩûÔΩÄ)‚îå

In all seriousness, I could see Disney seriously considering lending the rights to Alien to BHVR, because there's very little they have to do except sit down and iron out the details, and it's basically free money and advertisement for them. Guaranteed that a Xenomorph and Ripley 'Alien' chapter would sell like hotcakes and quite well over an extended period of time. Similarly, I could see BHVR and/or Disney getting Sigourney Weaver into a recording booth like they did with Bruce Campbell for Ash Williams.
---
Yes. It's a cardinal sin to skip parts
---
Calm down dude it‚Äôs not the end all be all

This game doesnt even work with challenges. Like the daily rituals are already stupid and annoying and they are as basic as can be. Most of these challenges are just based on RNG or will just get people to farm for them, completely missing the point of a challenge. 
---
It should just be ‚Äúgoals‚Äù like
---
Hook 5 survivors &gt; Hook 10 survivors &gt; Hook 20 survivors &gt;*optional branch off path* *Hook 2 survivors in the basement &gt; Hook 4 Survivors in the basement* &gt; Hook 30 survivors.
---
Complete 1 generator &gt; Complete 3 generators &gt; Complete 5 generators &gt; *optional branch off path* *complete 1 generator while Hex:Ruin is active* &gt; *Complete 3 generators while Hex:Ruin is active* &gt; Complete 10 generators.
---
It's an example. Obviously survivors get a say on whether or not a killer is OP, because they're no more bias than the killers are.
---
exactly, I can totally see that being a chapter. I wouldn't be surprised if they have something like that in the works.
---
Whelp, I guess I'm not sleeping tonight. Lol
---
Nurse is still strong but is punished way to much when missing blinks
---
So you're always playing swf?
---
This is some good news.
---
Which is the same as the masters for level 1. They should definitely give more than the first level.
---
Its balanced, it just doesn‚Äôt work most of the time
---
Im also a killer main but when I play survivor I use it
---
I play both. I try to still play fair as a killer, but I can see why killers in red ranks might play shitty against some groups, because when I'm a red rank survivor that doesn't play toxic and still end up winning almost every game so long as the rest of the team are also red ranks. Makes it hard to win when you're up against 4 players that know the game well enough to effectively coordinate even if they aren't swf, even if they aren't being toxic.
---
Yeah the pages were titled memories of the alchemist right? So it'd make sense
---
Farming is so booooorriiinnnngggg. Doing gens was boring enough before i got to watch a spirit swining violently over the corpse of my immediately DC'd team mate. And as a killer you're either a dick or "entity displeased"
---
Corrupt intervention is just as good of not better than ruin
---
It‚Äôs always on a weekend!:(
---
I tried not using Ruin and using Pop and Thrilling Tremors instead and for steamrolled a bunch of times, then went back to ruin. -_-
---
They also hit terrain objects they barely come near, so she's more unfun to play as, too. And loses a lot of hatchets.
---
Nurse still doesn't need ruin, and Billy definitely fares well without it.
---
New killer: Hillary Clinton
---
I've definitely seen this perk quite a bit at red ranks when I'm survivor. So can I just run this with any other 3 perks? Or is there a build to be more synergistic with Corrupt Intervention?
---
They‚Äôre probably trying to get one of the archive challenges done or maybe they are just triggered by a series of bad games since everyone has their sweaty bad manners on right now.
---
I like the idea but the four killers don‚Äôt really have any abilities, personally I think just a survivor from the Slasher series would be better than trying to incorporate a killer.
---
I second this.
---
Survivor rules for myself: always go back for the last hooked survivor, if I can't heal someone in time after an unhook...take a hit for them, if it's 2 peoole alive with gens left hop on a gen and don't try to sneak around and wait for a hatch. And most importantly, ALWAYS be doing something productive.
---
Same thing JUST happened to me. I used my last 3 BPS, one game had 4 bps. The killer brought an ebony and we all got mori'd. The other 2, I got ivory mori'd and then face camped the next match.
---
I've played like maybe 3 matches as killer, I really like it, I just can't seem to get into a match.
---
So I'm not very good yet, but there was one dick who kept t-bagging me and the rest of the survivors were pretty chill. I hooked him up though, and he had to watch his last friend abandon him through the gate.
---
Yeah also we could get more cosmetics with originals!
---
I havent taken Iron Will off since I got it level 3 on her but I know what you mean. I recently leveled up Ace and its hilarious how quiet he is without Iron Will compared to survivors like Jane, Jeff and Bill.
---
There's not really options, just personal choices for gen management and  your playstyle or the killer you play. Your options are
---
Ruin
---
Surge
---
Pop
---
Discordance
---
Corrupt Intervention
---
Pop forces a specific playstyle that can be worse than it is better, but it's a good perk on its own. Corrupt is decent, but it is more or less a "Walk 10 feet and find another gen" perk" So while it may help you keep survivors off some gens for a short period of time, they'll simply find another. This would make Discordance strong since you're likely to find multiple survivors on a gen due to Corrupt. However, again, that playstyle kind of encroaches on "Just use Whispers" but it still allows you to pressure multiple survivors funneled to a gen.
---
Uh, Pop can be used with anything, but it does have the drawback when used with Surge of forcing regression on a gen better suited to a Pop kick if you use
---
I know people hate Ruin, but the reality that some people have a hard time swallowing is that 30 seconds to 60 seconds where 1 survivor is browsing for Ruin, the potential regression and the time it prevents hardcore gen progression, allowing you to find/chase/down and create pressure, is absolutely, 100% INVALUABLE. No perk does what Ruin does and offers you. None.
---
She's way easier to learn and use than before, no idea what you are on about.
---
Had the same but my post got deleted lol
---
Facts üíØ your preaching to the choir üôåüèæ
---
&gt;in case killers want to let me bleed out to avoid my lustful hook moan.
---
Which is always
---
Guessing that some of the later challenges that have a "single trial" will drop that stipulation
---
That is definitely the best part.
---
The point is the space out the content, and lead up to the next chapter
---
Were you meant to feel comfort in this game?
---
Like.....get better? The game gives you a good selection of free killers, all of whom can be good as long as you know how to play them. This is the weirdest, whiny post I've seen on here in a hot minute. Why would you deserve free DLC?
---
Or, you and your bullshit is in every other thread and it's easy to spot your BS
---
As a solo survivor, the only way I can communicate a camping killer is by spamming unhook. If I‚Äôm not waving my arms how do they know that I‚Äôm signalling camping or just inactive?
---
He‚Äôd make a good live action Bill
---
I was just trying out insta saw i dont really like it it throws me off and when it comes to using tinkerer its garbage when i use it cause i see it go offf im like oh ill go ever there then gen is insta done and i just one a game by using noed on the last guy
---
Yes.
---
I do
---
Oh shit! They added the proper Ghostface skin! I'm sold.
---
Think he's talking bout the level...
---
r/angryupvote
---
This.  Because the killer's decision-making is pretty linear, survivor skill dictates the pace of the game.
---
legendary chat
---
Smart ill do thatüÖ±oi
---
The quality of this shitpost is OFF THE ROOFS!
---
That's the one!
---
It's not big but it's still something. I think someone said it's like 5% but idk if that's right
---
Killer queue has never taken me more than 15 minutes max. The general wait is around 10 minutes. The higher your rank, the faster you will queue. Watch YouTube videos while waiting or play survivor for instant queues. The reason killer queue is so long is because survivor queue is literally four times faster, since it‚Äôs a team game where one team is 4 in size while the other is just 1.
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
Any info on what it is though?
---
Ok dude. I think I'll just block you
---
For too long you have stalked me, bye
---
Laziest hatchet throw ever!
---
Omg I suck at the flashlight lol
---
Finally somone not shitalking me using noed even tho i just got the game
---
That would've been amazing. I was with a friend in that match and we were almost crying laughing at the fact that the legion just looked like a glowstick.
---
How? You pretty much have to try to be blinded as hag unless you're doing absolutely nothing to avoid it...
---
You now have to strategically conserve your blinks in a chase and deal with the long cooldown if you end up missing them. Unless they made the checkered fabric as her base, it‚Äôs probably not easier.
---
Honestly save bps and other good offerings for non-events. People play really scummy and toxic during events for some reason.
---
I dont like tinkerer the gens get done like 5 seconds after it procks
---
I always thought huntress would be fub to get better at but I feel like I cant get better because the scenario with hatchets is either "that should've hit" or "that shouldn'tve hit"
---
Yeah, I just got finished watching stardust crusaders
---
It used to be a thing with BNP cause you could basically auto finish like 4 gens at the start of match.
---
Now it‚Äôs just people crying about survivors working on gens with good toolboxes cause they can‚Äôt handle it.
---
I wanted either Billy or Johnathan so I'm ok with this
---
Yeah. Looking at the list of T4 challenges right now and I'd say half of them are totally reasonable. The other half require you to be farming with someone or play dozens of games in the hopes that you can get lucky.
---
I never ask for downvotes I just know it's coming because I present a counter argument, that's just this sub in a nutshell. In regards to the iron will, that's not spirit, that's just the way the perks work. And we have a perk that hightens noises, and one that quietens them from both sides. Who should get priority? "Just mindgame her" IS a broad statement, which is why I always try to elaborate, for instance, pulling a pallet down early, and slide back over, or when running around a loop, you can see when she is fake phasing, if you can see her phasing for real, you move slightly away from the pallet so she can't collide, and maybe run in circles to confuse the scratch marks. The spirit is a challenge, and maybe even a little too easy to learn, but people who say she has ZERO counter play IN MY OPINION are not trying to learn to go against her.
---
usually i am really immersed, so i dont really run towards them or chase them before they pick up the survivor. sometimes i really feel like it should have blinded them, shining right in their face, but it doesn't. 
---
just got pretty bored with my immersed playstyle even tho it works out, its not that exciting anymore.
---
I used to do that with cypress moris
---
Same. I've looked it up and only found a couple, most have low upvotes or are from pretty long ago.
---
Thank fuck for that.
---
They need to give my girl Nea an eye patch cosmetic so I could start plundering with style
---
I used it so often.. hope you'll come back, my old friend! It's annoying go to the lobby to switch sides every time
---
mine crashes 90% of the time when i just click on the notes which is super annoying cause i wanna see them but cant at risk of crashing again. mine doesnt even make a noise it just closes DBD and up pops the error report.
---
If survivors actually got bloodpoints like killers do then there would be almost no one wanting to farm
---
You mean Nancy! I almost died when I heard her scream on hook the first time
---
This 3 guys purposely searched for me right at the start of the game.  They ddnt even know im a spirit. They just went straight on me to get hit hoping i will let them heal their injured teammate (as i said) to farm bloodpoints. Read their names.. Theyre hoping that I will ride along with them. I wished i have taken a screenshot of the whole post-game chat.. They were really mad.
---
"What are you on about" You realize they changed absolutely nothing about how you learn how to play her, right? And that what they changed actually makes her more difficult to learn and play effectively at red ranks, or any rank, simply due to how her blinks recharge, no?
---
 Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about. The reason you can more easily deal with a Nurse is because inprecise blink punish you much more, due to how the recharges work. 2 missed blinks = 2 recharges required = survivors gaining LoS + distance = them always being a step ahead until you land 2 long range blinks. Also harder due to the ability to see an after image.
---
The survivor constantly maintains distance if she has no range addon due to having to expend 2 blinks + recharge as the survivor maintains distance + breaks los. If you break LoS and she takes a guess and it's wrong, the Nurse is instantly punished by LoS break, forcing slow movement into the open until the survivor can be seen. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you're dealing with it yourself, and you realize it can be very difficult.
---
All of this applies to her map pressure as the slowest moving killer now cannot blink around the map as quickly due to having to recharge. If you happen to be in close range to a Nurse, you can actually loop here if you're looping around difficult to phase objects, such as wrecker trucks, or large hay stacks. This means it's easier to "loop" her in the sense that you maintain distance within this LoS. This is because the loop + the 2 recharges means you waste a ton of her time until she does manage a hit. Even eventually going down you've essentially wasted a ton of time, and that is where her slight lack of mobility comes into play to pressure gens and keep up her aggressive playstyle. None of this entirely affects you if you're playing bad players.
---
I mean, sorry but it seems like you have no idea what you're on about.
---
Almost as if humor was subjective. Haha that's so crazy, such an intricate subject to grasp.
---
Much better than them staying on gens. Flashlight saves are also super counterable once you knoe they'll go for it
---
Sorry, I'll pass this time üòÇüòÇ I am really bad at flashlights and I had a really bad time cleasing 8 totems. For six straight games I got facecamped or tunnelled to death (screw the event btw). I only managed to finish this one and the one with my Claud because I actually got two friendly killers &lt;3 Still I'll never touch survivor again anytime soon. BACK to killer, though I can see already the survivors are going to bully me a lot with this mission üòÇüòÇ rip love ps4
---
Except you are if you want to stand a chance in red ranks.
---
&gt;It's not always about who's the best but also who's fun to play and I'd like to be able to just play more killers.
---
Then grind or buy them, that's how DLCs work, my man. If you aren't having fun with the base game killers then that's a *you* problem.
---
Because it's a total of 4, you can actually do partial generators, and redoing regressed generators should also count. It seems like a lot, but considering the average solo survivor game is doing 3 gens solo, this one actually shouldn't be that hard
---
These really need to be redone.  An alternative one, that would be hard, but not impossible is "unhook 4 people (1 while in endgame collapse) while using the perk we'll make it.  
---
This challenge is still difficult, requires that you use a specific perk and still requires the end game collapse portion. But is achievable, even if it takes a while.
---
Reading these comments make me realize I could've done it without letting the killer hook me lmao
---
Doctor.
---
Holy shit buddy, you need to put the controller down and go calm down. It's a fucking game. Anyone who DCs as a rage quit is trash. I'm guessing by your attitude that you've DEFINITELY never done that though!
---
Gen rushing *AKA playing the game*
---
My killer rules.
---
1. Never camp unless all the gens are completed.
---
2. Obsessions almost always get slugged
---
3. If they unhook right in front of you slug the person that was on the hook and chase the unhooker.
---
4. If you hear hatch while carrying the last survivor let them have it unless they are the definition of aids.
---
5. If the last survivor does not struggle let them live, unless they were a urban evasioning Claudette that did nothing for the team.
---
6. Show favoritism towards all Tapp mains.
---
Survivor rules
---
1. No more than 2 toolboxes on team.
---
2. Stay on hook as long as possible if their is a face camper.
---
3. At ranks 13 and above only tap gens until the first person gets hit.
---
4. Kill yourself right away if the last person has a chance of escaping.
---
5. If you really want to tell somebody they fucking suck and to stop sitting in the corner just be moderately condescending and vague about it so they won't know if they should be offended.
---
6. Boop the snoot
---
7. Let the killer hit you at the exit gate.
---
8. Tell the killer if they jumpscared you or did well, it'll probably make their day.
---
actually rank 20-16 are exempt from the limited range, so they can play with any rank

Wouldn‚Äôt you say the intention by the devs most likely was for the person to be injured? It‚Äôs good to know that it seems to be bugged in a sense I suppose.

I don‚Äôt like the fanny pack it‚Äôs gross

i think 5000 personally.

Lol fake-ass kid. You talked yourself into a corner, and imploded. Niiiiiice.
---
Next time you try to pass off a repost as OC, or information as your own insight, just shut up, and say nothing. This was too EZ.
---
Bubba is like the worst killer in the game.
---
Dont have it i just got the game
---
They might suck in chases but most red ranks can still pop a couple gens in under 3 minutes without ruin, some even with ruin. Realistically I just think that entire thing needs a rework since even ruin doesn‚Äôt stop some survivors from insta popping gens
---
no spine chill or sprint burst? this stealth build is booty
---
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that Ghostface is an A tier killer around 3rd or 4th place, honestly congrats man
---
Sure thing buddy, only the others are to blame. All the people I see you arguing with day after day are at fault, never you.
---
Go ahead. Block me, block all these people in here you insult daily, until you can finally be right once
---
I can dig it. At the end of the day it's super useful and deserves its top perk status
---
You must not play with friends, like, ever then, because it happens almost EVERY time I load in to the lobby again. The lobby errors have made me say time and time again that if there are this many issues with it, they should have just never changed it.
---
How hard is it for a matchmaking system to keep 4 players together between matches!? I'm no game dev, but it cannot be as hard as BHVR is making it. It's absolutely absurd.
---
With console load times and lag it can take up to 20 seconds to load back to the main menu, select killer/survivor and then load to said menu
---
Thinking to small,, atleast 50000 should be just enough
---
No you have a problem for thinking its ok to act like a piece of shit by tunneling and camping and expecting people to not be happy when you fail by playing like that. If you play toxic you dont deserve respect and dont deserve to get kills.
---
Steve pretending to go down, how sweet.
---
You‚Äôre wrong. The challenge(s) you‚Äôre referring to are searching 4 chests with plunserer‚Äôs, sacrificing all survivors in the basement, and hooking 5 survivors in the basement with agitation
---
At least you have p3 with the face mask so you can survive with style
---
Mostly it allowed me to play crappy as killers that don't play for BP or Dailys, but just want to murder everyone as fast and unfairly as possible.
---
I just pop into the game do my archive-thing until i get caught and then suicide, and on to the next.
---
hahahahaha guys does anyone else experience dbd while they play it??? here is an office gif of my mfw face when I chase the survivor xd
---
:)
---
It says when each Tkme is being released in the News section.
---
Feel like you work for bHVr if you think blood warden needs reworking lol
---
Yeah the 4th tome has been leaked all over the place
---
The challenges are bullshit but I think some of them are placeholders
---
All of these suggestions are great! I hope the devs see this and implement some
---
And do what? Make some friends? Hahahaha!
---
I won't deny that killers get more bloodpoints in general but even so, it's not that big of a deal to me. I started out playing survivor mostly and I never really had any issues with this. If you really care that much, don't prestige.
---
Thinking that "random = funny" is almost exclusive to children and young teens and there's no arguing that.
---
I've recently picked up DBD again(like 4 days ago or smth) and immediately bought Legion cause they were on sale. Gotta say they really reignited my love for this game. Currently Rank 13 and working myself back to Rank 1. Was 10/10 worth to buy and I love them!
---
Doesn't matter, because I got my way. The posts are no more. Go cry to someone who cares.
---
The spirit can‚Äôt see blood while phasing unless they are using the ultra rare add on.
---
Ah. Ok thanks!
---
1/17 isn't really indicative of what killer you see, especially when rank is factored in.
---
I feel like challenges like the one that we have currently (on level 4) are too difficult, not bcs theyre hard mechanically but just because it needs to be a perfect specific situation otherwise its not happening and since its a mp game it makes it even more difficult
---
How does that make any sense? He will just break the pallet and place one there anyway, you just waste a very important escape tool
---
... I almost exclusively play with friends...
---
I play on xbox with no post game and I am purple ranks and always get gg wp's but when rank reset happens and I'm yellow ranks and THEN shit hits the fan with the EZ's and the toxic POS
---
We really need to have crossplay with at least xbox
---
It‚Äôs how many times they have prestiged
---
Inadvertently buffing wraith harder than his cube ever did.
---
You have to blind the killer while he's carrying a survivor twice in the same trial that's going to be hard even for some advanced players at red or purple ranks
---
no problem!
---
Because if you played solo, you lost out and gained absolutely nothing.
---

---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth.
---
Yeah what's the point of this thread because they obviously don't read it
---
Im not even a survivor main. I have three p3 killers and 1 p3 survivor. Also twice as many teachables for killer. Keep assuming things to fit your false narrative.
---
Your comment proves you're a killer main through and through.
---
This game is 1v1v1v1 more often than it's 1v4.
---
If you don‚Äôt have doctor I feel it‚Äôs super easy to farm BP on wreath too
---
Imagine going a garbage perk on the off chance you get to troll someone trying to get a challenge done
---
I just started playing killer (have red rank on surv) and got from rank 20 to 19.
---
On rank 20 survivors are wondering why I let the last one get the hatch and don't get that no wiggling = hatch guaranteed. But I still carry them, so they learn. They don't understand that ruin is a perk that is removable no matter how often I drop them next to the totem. They heal themselves right in the open. They hide at obvious places. 
---
On rank 19 survivors are suddenly the gods of the game. I still play fairly bc 1, I want to learn to chase better so I let them escape more often than going for the easy kill bc it will only get worse on higher ranks, right? And 2, suddenly everyone is a smart cunt and spamming EZ in the after game chat while I'm sitting here like: I let you wiggle free twice, how daft are you?!
---
I've had the last guy DC rather than take the hatch, saying he won't take charity from a "shxt camping killer". Survivors get petty.
---
I‚Äôm sure if I played swf I would understand that true power of it, but always playing only solo or duo it is quite miserable
---
Just you wait... You'll regret it soon...
---
I see...I honestly should be doing survivor ones since I finished killer but I want to just do killer till the end of Double Bloodpoints.
---
This isn't a fair game at all. Only play fair of you think it's not going to hamper you, otherwise play how you want. 
---
Btw once you have ruin play fair during that phase because that actually allows the game down even more, but once it's fine everyone is fair game.
---
Yeah I want out already, just wanted bragging rights :)
---
One of my main issues is that the only hags Ive played to date either don‚Äôt see me the entire game or tunnel me as soon as I get off the hook, if I‚Äôm lucky enough to escape.
---
IM HAVING FUN MORI CAMPING ALL U NOOBS TRYING TO GET BP'S
---
HAHAHAHA
---
I finished it all and I feel so empty inside :/ NEED MORE
---
A meeting shall now come to order!
---
I see the arguments from both sides... it‚Äôs crappy for Survivors to be proxy camped for the mori, or have the Killer come back and tunnel you after the unhook just to be moried... however from a Killer perspective they still need to be a powerful offering.
---
My firm belief on a change to Ebony and Ivory moris is that they should only be able to be used after every Survivor has been hooked at least once. 
---
Would give Survivors the chance at having a second hook if by the time the Killer finds them again the whole team hasn‚Äôt been hooked yet and preventing an unhook/tunnel/mori situation, whilst also rewarding the Killer for hooking everyone once and letting them start using the moris.
---
üòÇüòÇ good luck, see you in the fog.
---
lol, i think 10000 could work but then people would SWF and take turns DCing
---
*DMCA intensifies*
---
This is this mans first post on this account, its a downvote bait account.
---
HUEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
No I get that and that's how it should be. But I don't like how it reveals the survivor's aura without letting you know. The whole point of the perk is that survivor and killer have synchronized aura. You get to see me, I get to see you. But with this, it lets the killer see the survivor when the survivor can't see the killer. I would OoO let survivors see killers when they aren't in stealth and then just do nothing when they are in stealth. That seems like it makes more sense than having it just randomly reveal your aura to the killer with no indication that it's doing so.
---
You don‚Äôt have to. After level 50 you can continue to level them up again and again without prestiging them, just means if you ever decide to do so all the extra points you put into them after level 50 will have been wasted.
---
&gt;transsexual Transylvania!

that's... a dangerous assumption to make lol

I get after a match after looking to see everyone‚Äôs perks it freezes

Gonna have to change my name and beg to the killers for this

I hate to admit as someone who plays at red rank I was thinking I‚Äôd have to do that... red rank killers will absolutely never let you get a flashlight save let alone two. I‚Äôm a purple rank killer and at this point It‚Äôs like a sixth sense I just know when baby Claudette is behind me with a flashlight.
---
Yeah it's on the switch!
---
Fair enough, you kinda need the full Thana/Sloppy/Nurse's combo to really get enough out of it. The heals have to go slow otherwise you just slap everyone but by the time you get back to the injured guy he's healed up. Surge could work well in its place but it synergizes well with Surveillance and then you can keep Pop for the further gen.
---
Contact behavior! I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs normal!
---
You clearly support that playstyle especially with how defensive you replied over someone simply saying they like to see a toxic player leave after not getting a kill in postgame, not be toxic or teabag just watch them leave postgame after losing. You get so defensive over that and try to justify that playstyle proving my point that you think its ok, so if anyone is digging a grave here its you digging yourself one.

We need to go higher, if a survivor DCs you get an entire bloodweb level for free

It would get old at one point but sure why not, I'd rather have the whole DbD survivor cast say random stuff during the game tbh
---
I feel like a BP multiplier would help, too. 1.2x for 1 DC, 1.5x for 2, and 1.8 for 3. This would apply to the killer as well, and if all survivors DC, he gets a 2.0x multiplier.

I don't really think so because apparently the Alchemist is a she, so that's definitely Vigo, and devs said they won't make them killer or survivors or in general playable characters...
---
This said, they did say in an interview that they lied before so yeah, it can actually happen!
---
Nope, there's another one
---
It's honestly more entertaining to be subtle but I see your point.
---
How is the switch port? Sibling might be interested.
---
lmfao
---
Keep going I'm almost finished
---
So... do we upvote him to erase his negative karma?
---
After the sexy D√≠ de muertos costumes for Legion released. I saw a shit ton of them yesterday night.
---
Yea, that kill all survivors by any means is polluting the game right now.
---
That's right, too many single eyeball perks. Thanks op and good fucking luck with them gens.
---
Nah I mean like, I don't let up for a second, but when I get 4k's playing way more nicely than a lot of other killers would, and then people wanna complain, its like why can't people just realize they are the actual problem?
---
Idk. Doesn't bother me. I'm not gonna get banned for playing the game well, so I'll just keep doing what I do.
---
I ask the same question on the no stupid question threads
---
I do it as a "killer is gone! I can't see him! Come pop me off!"
---
Two major problems will be presented. 
---
1.Killers will be extra cautious and aware about flashlight saves, and employ tactics such as looking at walls, surveying the area before picking people up, or even using perks like lightborn franklins infectious fright to fully take advantage of the situation. Also they will take note on who has flashlights in the pregame lobby.
---
2.Second problem and the even more apparent one, is that there is no way a killer would get flashlight saved on again if they already got flashlighted once, ESPECIALLY if people are aware of this challenge. Even the newest of the novices would not have memory that short to forget what happened less than 5 minutes ago, so two saves in one match is almost impossible
---
Edit: Before someone refutes me by saying "i get multiple flashlights in one match all the time you just need to GiT gUd" I also frequently get multiple flashlights saves in one match. However, my argument is not that it is not possible to get multiple flashlights, but rather that the challenge itself is drawing attention to flashlight saves, and surprise factor is definitely the main factor in making flashlight saves possible, not to mention the plethera of other conditions that needs to be met for a flashlight save to happen, e.g. a survivor being downed in the open, you being in the proximity of the survivor, the map youre on, etc.
---
nope. we ignore it
---
*Dies
---
god, some people just have absolutely no game sense.
---
I use the head with my school dress and prestige sword
---
I dont really think the first one is necessary but I like the name. It's mostly that you cant further help OR people just dont want to help, dont think it will come in handy or will be used that often.
---
Even that doesn‚Äôt help at all
---
I mean i practically threw my games running a totem eating build just to get the 8 (I think?) IN 2 games instead of a bunch. And just to loot 3 chests I ran a full on chest search build.
---
I cannot stress enough how stupid these leaked Lvl 4 challenges are. Like, they either cause killers to want death, or survivors to die of boredom.
---
That's fine.
---
The only problem with that is when someone DCs right at the end so you get the extra bp for no real disadvantage - perhaps they could give a bigger multiplier when there are more gens left when they DC
---
Yup. Every time i exit out on console its about 10 seconds of a frozen screen before i can actually di anything
---
That's how I escape 50% of mori attempts.
---
Ffs
---
&gt; I really don't feel that pressured as survivor at all
---
I play both sides, and always have. I admit I play more survivor, because it's the only way I can play with my friends, but that's a different situation.
---
I have never understood killer mains (I understand the killer role just fine, and have plenty of things I'd like changed, but that's not the same thing), and I side heavily against most of the issues killers seem to think exist. I see people cry and complain about things that from the survivor perspective are either one of the only breaths of air they have, or the only escape, or the only thing they CAN DO (I mean really, complain about getting "looped" one more time as if someone is supposed to run in a straight line away from you and get caught one second later.) that I just don't get it. There is a complete lack of playing both sides in this community, and the discussions feel 80% controlled by upset killer mains, and the devs seem to actually listen for some reason.
---
I get some of the frustration, killer role is always on, you're always moving, always in a chase, always putting pressure, always getting a down or paying attention to gens or hooks or what have you, and while you're doing that, you realize you're losing ground. That's the role, it's active, where as survivor is active half the time and the other half is a different form of active, where it's not always moving. High rank survivors are though, mentally, and it's still very taxing, but they're not constantly wondering if they didn't check a corner, they're just constantly trying to predict another human being who has power over them. The issue is that, that "always on" aspect, should be fun, not frustrating, and it's directed poorly, towards survivors, and not towards the game design, or the devs. I've played dozens of competitive games, where your mind is moving a mile a minute, and your fingers are always at the ready, but those communities are nowhere near as toxic because of it, as this community seems to be, so it simply can't be that.
---
I have never "got it" for killer mains, and I don't know if I ever will in terms of how a lot of people try to portray the situation on this subreddit. The game is absolutely not survivor sided. You're not supposed to 4k every game. If you're a "killer" then the other guy is a "survivor" and they should be able to fulfill their role just as much as you fulfill yours. I could go on and on.
---
It can be incredibly hard to have discussions about perks within this community because there is a complete lack of understanding from one side of the community in my opinion, and the vast majority of updates and tweaks favor one side. People will claim it's because "survivors started over powered" but I think this is a complete fallacy and has way more to do with simplistic game design and flaws within maps, within the game, and with how the devs treat, create, and "solve" problems. Their fix for everything seems to be a hard counter for instance, and that's got to be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen, and this heavily favors killers who can control the entire playstyle of a survivor based on killer powers they don't know until the match has already started.
---
Add onto this that the game is absolutely not 1v4, and is sometimes 1v1v1v1, which killer mains never understand, I just have less and less care for people who don't play an entire part of the game, but then come spout off about how a single survivor got hatch, so they need to fix 20 different aspects of the game to ruin the fun for survivors and make it so they can absolutely dominate games cause "K-I-L-L-E-R" and it makes me wish I had a few games like this to chose from, instead of having only this game to frustrate me.
---
I could literally make this post 3x as long just fleshing out some of these things, but the fact of the matter is this, **if you've never felt the pressure of this game as a survivor, then I don't see how you're actually not a killer main pretending you play survivor.**
---
No way, that's so hard!!
---
good for you man, your first time is a really memorable one. 3 more ranks to go :3
---
Sounds like a solo player.
---
Probably but I imagine some killers would of had nice homes/possessions and now they‚Äôre stuck in some foggy jungle üòÇ
---
You say tunnel, but the guy I just played calls 'getting unhooked, walking straight into a hag trap and then not even trying to use pallets or anything', "being tunneled". 
---
When you say it, do you mean what it actually means, which is the killer ignores other survivors just to down you, regardless of whether the other guys are close or body blocking for you or whatever?  Because getting found over and over isn't tunneling, unless you expect the killer to say "Oh, I'm sorry, pardon me sir, you appear still injured from your hook because your dumbass teammates aren't healing you, be on your merry way please." Some of the salt I get is pretty much people suggesting exactly that.
---
i'm not the person you replied to but my killer is rank 20 and the wait times for a lobby are impossible since people can't intentionally derank past 15 now.
---
there's other reasons, but the big one is i just don't find it fun. it's too stressful to only be relying on myself for the win. i prefer to play as part of a team.
---
Good point, didn't think of that.
---
It's a Jeff joke. Calm down. If I was rude id call you a neckbeard.
---
''friends''
---
you already lost me, my dude
---
To avoid Steve's scream when he's on the hook, hit him
---
Thanks you too
---
you spelled nea wrong
---
Vigo = Vigo; 
---
The Alchemist = The Hallowed Blight Researcher, the Opium Den Guy, the guy who found Vigo's journal, Vigo's Student and Follower, the Pustula Lunatic...
---
cmon they are not the same person.
---
Weren't you just complaining about swf like an hour ago
---
Because it‚Äôs not a bad way to play the game, if you‚Äôre not having fun just dc, devs said so :)
---
 "Pussy" -1200 for the dcer
---
Oooooo thank you
---
yeah they need definitely to change ir
---
Console
---
Ah thank you. I just got my first 4K :)
---
Remember when Behavior said they expected the average player to be able to complete each of these quests in about an hour? That was a good trick.
---
Not caring what survs say! As long as there are Killer Nerfs every Patch and SwF not balanced! Period
---
How about Ruvik / Leslie xD
---
That's easy why everyone freaking out lol
---
They could be complaining about anything and that response would work
---
That's immensely stupid. Just show people's rotation, instead.
---
SAME. Super annoying to play as her on console, and for nothing. Better off dumpstering it ig.
---
That's a nice shot, LMAFAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I say unlocking hillbilly as a survivor for the next game is the only way to make it fair and balanced.
---
It's me, Meg. I don't have much time, I have information that will indict Hillary Clint-
---
Yes but a lot of ppl abuse that and just make it their mission to go for saves all game. That‚Äôs just not fair, neither is it fun for the killer to deal with. I‚Äôm assuming ur not a killer main, and by killer main I mean ur relatively high rank- because that‚Äôs all us killer mains deal with. I just don‚Äôt understand how majority of survivors do these things strictly to fuck w the killer, but when the killers quit and have equal satisfaction, it‚Äôs all of a sudden the end of the world. Not salty but I‚Äôm speaking for all killer mains when I say this lol
---
While I kinda agree at the same time I‚Äôm like ‚Äúif the mods don‚Äôt want certain content then people who do want it r welcome to make their own page‚Äù
---
I'll take the Plague and the Hags halloween skins over this one every day of the week, the Prestige bloody gear she gets is 100x cooler looking.
---
The real question I have is why did you just sit there in front of the killer and all get downed üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Specifically, Satan, Mammon, and Beelzebub.
---
I just want Bloodlust removed. It always freezes my game and helps the Survivors get distance ffs.
---
Type of bug: gameplay
---
Trapper unable to place traps
---
Type of bug: audio
---
Terror radius disappearing when playing against hillbilly
---
That man has a TED talk
---
Is it intended? Before it wasnt like this, now it is, they really need to put that in the description if that's the case
---
Had that blaring all game was just running around being stupid since couldn‚Äôt hear anything
---
Let them post low effort crap over at /r/ColdwindFarm , it's a win-win scenario then. That sub gets more traffic and the low-effort shit stays off of here.
---
I hope I never play against you
---
Bled out after being slugged I suspect.
---
I like to imagine all Epstein memes are made by one guy on like 50 different alts
---
Right? What the hell did I just watch?
---
Originally, that was probably one of the intentions, but stealth is just way too weak to beat ring around the rosie.
---
It'd actually be a horror game, for one thing.
---
You ever taken a Hammer of Sol to the face? You won‚Äôt see shit for a few months, assuming you survive.
---
Can we just start banning meme templates too? The fucking one with the girl yelling at the cat has been posted every day for almost a year now
---
As a survivor main who moonlight kills, I can say that I've popped streamers with a group of friends and the killer always tunnels, focus' one down right away to make it harder and I could go on. The fact that you hooked em all, and took turns not being an ass and caring about just your BP, sheeeet, I wish I was that fortunate. I pop a BP and I know its time to sweat. You weren't wrong, I play both sides of the field and think that was generous.
---
It was a Claudette, I came back to pick her up not long after the 1st hook and she hits me with DS. A bit later I bump into her again (she didn't heal or was healed) downed her again and put her on the hook.
---
I know right.
---
Just take the doctor to Hawkins with distressing his TR is about as big as the map when standing in the middle... fun time to be had!
---
no its just funny that you make this post about DC'ing survivors but then still cry about swf
---
I agree that there was no point in saying that.
---
But hot damn all those brand new parts. üòÇ
---
This is true, but im not trying to complain about survivors, just looking for some friendly advice on how to play better
---
Yeah I'd go with this. If you run Bloodwarden with Remember Me you can easily get a few hooks in the end game. BBQ, NOED, Bloodwarden and Remember Me is basically a crime because you can accumulate points during the game using BBQ and then easily get a 4K during the end game.
---
I don't think that was rude tbh, the chat closed right after I wrote that in. 4 BNP's is a pretty gen rushy build to me?
---
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but you don't see that outside of obvious SWF's...
---
Tbh you got into a confusing time bc there's an event rn so you basically gotta learn the basic stuff plus all the event stuff. The archive challenges is the event thing. I don't even know where to begin.
---
If you're playing survivor, your main goal is to escape. The killer's goal is to kill you (duh). You escape by doing gens (generators). Those have skill checks which you have to hit with the space key. The skill check has a tone indicator. When you see a circle thing popping up, you gotta hit one of the small marked areas. one area is bigger than the other. If you (all 4 survivors) do 5 gens together, you can open one of 2 gates, and then escape.
---
If the skill check circle is red, that means there's a perk called Ruin. In this case you have to hit the very small area of the skill check which isn't easy.
---
Perks are skills killers and survivors can equip. You need Bloodpoints (points you get after each match) to "buy" perks and items. In the beginning this is all hella confusing but just use what u get and what you think can help you.
---
There's a dbd wiki on the interwebs that goes into all of this. Honestly this game is so damn confusing for newcomers, so I'd say just start playing and don't mind losing bc that's the only way you can learn. Also hit me up if you got questions, I'm gonna try to help.
---
Much like the Vegas massacre we'll never know the truth, and both events seem almost completely memory holed.
---
I‚Äôd buy that dlc
---
?
---
I think I would cry if I lost my progress I have every perk and killer at level 50,
---
This is was useful I don‚Äôt get why they took it out
---
killer was mind gaming him self lol
---
Oh wow, thanks! Those tier lists were starting to get a bit annoying
---
Let's be real, toxicity happens from both sides. I play way more survivor than killer on this game and I see more toxic survivors than killers.
---
Switch NOED and Rancor for Pop Goes the Weasel and something else, I use either I‚Äôm All Ears or Save The Best for Last.
---
This update came at the same time I reached red ranks for the first time so I thought the game was always like this when you reach red ranks to give the feeling that it's a more "elite" lobby
---
Three level 50 laps, hasn‚Äôt appeared once for me....
---
I never run stridor on spirit you only need it to deal with iron will and you'll know of someone has it other than that all survivors are loud enough to hear without it
---
id rather play a game of tag than a game of hide and seek
---
p3 50 Jeff here, howdy
---
It can be quite tricky on PS4 so don‚Äôt be too rough on yourself. After all, they‚Äôre sort of meant to be a rare but epic play in my opinion. Spirit and Demo especially are a tad trickier as they are slightly different from the other killers.
---
My PSN is Wicked-Hardcorg, so if you want, hit me up sometime and we can do some practice runs. I‚Äôm always down to help out a Scooper.
---
Friday the 13th came out almost a year after
---
xd xd xd xd dae nea the KILLR?!??!! ugly girl EVIL also clawdette WHORE xd
---
I was reading it earlier since I had it for some reason and they are all so damn hard, I really dunno if I could do them lmao
---
Alright I'm just gonna do point by point here.
---
 1. I have an even amount of killers and survivors leveled up at this point, a bit more on killer but that's because I power farmed some during double BP since they're perks usually can go with a specific power
---
  2. There isn't a lack of playing both sides really, people most of the time. Just have different opinions, a rare day someone solely plays one role or even mostly one role. People switch. They just have different opinions so "tHeY mUsT bE kIlLeR mAiNs", and devs usually seem to go by statistics with their stuff.
---
 3. Ehhh, it is fun, most of the time. Can be annoying in some instances of Nurse, prayer beads spirit, or Huntress with Iri Head and some other certain builds. But, otherwise, yeah. It's fun as hell for survivors.
---
 4. I'm not sure what competitive games you've spent time in, but I've personally dealt with TF2, SMITE, Overwatch, LoL, and For Honor and those are just in the past 5 years that I can remember. People are toxic as hell.
---
 5. Ehhh, while I think it's pretty even for the most part, but outside of a few killers(Nurse who's power shouldn't be in the game, and some addons as previously mentioned) yeah it does tilt towards survivors favor, and I don't think I've ever seen someone think they need a 4k every game, that's just some dumb strawman people seem to whip out of their ass randomly.
---
 6. No, it's because people have different viewpoints. The main issue that whenever has a different viewpoint? People like you go "oH yOu KiLlEr/SuRvIvOr MaIn", when people just have issues. I don't fuckin like adrenaline working off hook, so I must be a killer main. Oh, I have issues with the endfury combo? Survivor main! It's a bullshit standstill. 
---
 7. They kinda did, it's not really a fallacy. Game was kind of a damn mess at the start, they've made it a metric hell ton better now, but the writing is there. I think the most telling thing is even with "All the nerfs" survivors get, how strong they still are? Vs something like Legion who got rawed so hard she still is pretty fucking bad outside of being an annoyance. 
---
 8. It is a 1v4. Yeah sure, there are idiots, but they don't work against you. They're just idiots, but unless there's a DC or someone is actively working with the killer. It is a 1v4, even if some dumb cunt forgot to put on BT and does a stupid hook.
---
 9. Only time I really see people complain about hatch is either when, a key is fucking in play meaning MULTIPLE people escape from hatch, or it's a response to people going after NOED because "it rewards bad killers!" when hatch is the ultimate reward for survivors fucking up. 
---
 10. I don't feel pressure as survivor, not anymore. Because I don't have to be active all the time, aye, sure. Like I said I can become annoyed sometimes, but that ain't nothing that's cleared up within half a minute. I do feel a fuck ton of pressure as killer just thanks to the role yeah, being a 1v4 and having to be everywhere. It's why I do play a lot of survivor because that shit gives me anxiety half the time. While survivor even if I do get farmed by some prick I can just die on hook and move on. I can't do that with killer.
---
 You whining and going "Oh you aren't experiencing the same feeling I am!?" doesn't do shit, other than prove my point of people doing this shit all the time.
---
Well that's not too bad, if you have a build centered around it, like small game, a map, and detectives hunch, you can easily destroy all totems with minutes. And a plunderers build can get you some really strong items, like high end toolboxes, strong medkits, or keys, which also doesn't take more than a couple minutes.
---
I disagree with a lot of his ideas but it's hard to disagree with vocabulary.
---
Except when teammates disconnect, let you get camped, unhook right in front of killer etc etc
---
Isn't that a translation error?
---
yo this is actually hilarious
---
Ghostface mains.
---
My flair checks out, I know.
---
&gt;he has showcased many times that he is toxic as shit.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You are obi just someone in his chat that constantly sucks him off.
---
Very impressive of you to only need a few posts instead of "many times" to show you're no different. There are plenty of justifiable reasons to dislike pug, but if you cared about the context of what happened in this moment, this isn't one of them.
---
Pfff, I got it in a single match too. With calm spirit on.
---
As someone who plays both killer and survivor, people will rant about anything. You will get called names whether you tunnel or not, which you probably already now. I always skip the post game chat now. There's no point in staying ever.
---
I try to never tunnel and just target whoever is in front of me. If someone tries to block me while I try to get someone injured, I'll happily switch targets even though it'll work against me. I still get called a piece of trash though.
---
i got mori'd by myers next to the exit gates in the lab map and my screen turned like this
---
Yeah, I've thought of it.  
---
Would be pretty hilarious, "We couldn't get Jason...but here's his mum!"  
---
..and then we get a normal looking old lady chasing you around. Lol
---
The audio would be perfect for a tunnel map
---
No problemo
---
The hag
---
400 hours and I've done this *once*
---
maybe, it's in the German version
---
I JUST FIGURED OUT YOU CAN TELEPORT TO UR OUCHIE THINGS AS THE HAG OH MY GOF
---
There's quite a few people with this issue. Contact them for sure.
---
I would title it Peek - A - Boo Myers
---
*well.... have you ever tried?*
---
In my experience with the game, survivor is harder to learn and pick up than killer is, but killer is harder to master than survivor is.  I suck at survivor but that's what I've observed.
---
Gotta main Meg of course.
---
The only reason I haven't done the killer challenges is because my headset is wack and I rely way more on audio as killer then as survivor. (So yes every game feels like a game with huntress lullaby.)
---
Why the hell ate you posting this. This subreddit will be flooded with posts to nerf tree stumps
---
Which perk allowed you to dash past him so quickly?
---
Dude, I used to do that all the time. Before they added the icon i wouldn't even think about it. and there was some matches were it would of defiantly of helped to remember that.
---
It‚Äôs literally one of the most meta and commonly used perks that works well against almost any killer you could play against. -_- Same with Premonition. Or just using your eyes. Getting a good stalk off on someone without them seeing you is incredibly hard. From a survivor perspective I run Premonition, Urban Evasion, Balanced Landing etc. I hardly ever get exposed by Ghostface. When you‚Äôre doing a gen, position yourself to give yourself some cover from sight, plan an escape path, and always been paying attention.
---
It is, but for the sake of letting other people have a fun time please don't bring NOED
---
Survivor with the right perks and players in sync is generally the most powerful role, with the exception of Spirit and Nurse in certain maps, imo. The vast majority of games, survivors are not optimal, that gives several killers a good chance at a 3-4k. Maps and RNG can make a huge difference for role balance since number of objectives don't scale with the size of the map and loop mechanics create imbalances in chases on different set pieces. Using a map offering and optimizing perks for the map can just about fix the game in your favor in some cases. Some people here think Killers are all OP, others think survivors have too many safety nets and easy outs, it's not so simple but in certain instances both arguments carry some validity.
---
Mr
---
They left because the killer was taking too long to join. I really don't know why you would ever pass up an opportunity to have a 5 man public game, but it is what it is.
---
Three other people joined after everyone left and we had a normal match with a Freddy.
---
Better nerf pig
---
I play both sides and killer seems a little strong lately. I almost always win as killer and almost always die as survivor. It could be my personal skill difference along with teammates but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
To be fair,  Spine Chill is great against every killer.
---
It's a bug, I saw the 4th tome multiple times too
---
Bill's coughing is louder.
---
Dwight is the girl,
---
Nea is 101% the man
---
If it's so required they can make it base. Nobody should be required to run a perk
---
Okay, that's a confirmed translation error. It's for any chest
---
THAT‚ÄôS... A DANGEROUS ASSUMPTION TO MAKE LOL
---
spirit too for some reason seems impossible to blind. maybe i just suck
---
You didn't read my post. Thanks for the paragraph though.
---
Really don't care tbh.
---
But even running a full set of four gen regression perks on killer could be countered by each survivor running just one gen progression perk. Add one more gen perk to each survivor, and then you're entering crazy territory.
---
Ah, I see i am the true peasant.
---
Incredible, 4th bug I‚Äôve gotten TODAY. 
---
PS4, Daily Ritual bug
---
I dumpstered my Nurse daily (because it doesn‚Äôt work) and got a Ghostface daily instead. I closed the Daily tab, reopened it, and surprise, no daily ritual at all! :)
---
I also have anothe clip of me being alive in the endgame
---
For pretty much everyone, especially if they had prior game experience.
---
Lewinsky‚Äôs Red Lip Stick increases the hit boxes‚Äô size of all female characters and grants 75% in Deviousness

Dead hard, it's one of David kings perks.
---
And I hated every second of it
---
To be fair he ran 2 of his best addons along with the easiest killer map offering in the game.  Both sides came in to this thing with plenty of help.
---
Wouldn't be mad at this.
---
- Iron sword
---
- Cheese wheel
---
- Iron Shield
---
- 52 gold
---
- Sweet roll (2)
---
Wait do you get bonuses from pustula petals even when you don't bring them as an offering yourself?
---
As long as they got the blue jumper hahaha , suppose they could do the corpse head to spice it up.
---
That's a good one. Honestly surprised he isn't already. Must not be able to come up with abilities for him
---
I'd swap out the NOED.  How easy do you need your Spirit games to be lol?
---
1000 would be fair. Or at least 750. Survivors get punished WAY too hard already for having a DC. Throw em a bone at least.
---
PRAXIS
---
Get really close and tap R1, or RB if Xbox. Switch is probably just R.
---
Only apply the multiplier to bloodpoint gains after that DC not as a game multiplier.
---
Honestly though it'd be much better to just punish DCs much more harshly so that we can get rid of that problem
---
Or the licensing. If there is any
---
I'm not sure how I can use smaller words. If you cannot fairly enforce a rule, it should not exist. Your apologetics are just that.

Is this on the switch? The rift isn‚Äôt showing up for me
---
Doesn't the perk still light up when it's active?
---
Oh fuck off dude I'm just sick of seeing this shit on literally every single sub I'm on. Nobody is denying that Epstein didn't kill himself but this is like Hong Kong all over again, people just using it to get karma.
---
Filled to the brim with "safe pallets".  Have we played the same map?  80% of the pallets are pure garbage.  The ones upstairs are so bad they're memes.  There is like 5 good pallets on the whole map.  Gens and totems are difficult to find.  It's honestly the easiest killer map in the game.
---
This is the most obvious alt account I‚Äôve ever seen lol
---
Real convincing when your only 2 comments are under posts that this guy has made. Last one before this was 40+ days ago on the Funny sub.
---
If we are talking about from the movie I would laugh at how bad of an idea that is. 
---
Just regular slender man I wouldn‚Äôt really care to have him in or not. I prefer better licensed characters or original over him though...
---
pallets are a valuable resource. you shouldn't be wasting them.
---
YES AAAAA HYPE GG XD
---
Fair observation. So I guess in that sense it was a pretty level playing field.
---
I hope they get changed. Because I read them all and I was like ‚Äúwhat the fuck!!!‚Äù They‚Äôd be understandable challengers if they all didn‚Äôt have to be done *in a single fucking trial*
---
Same
---
This is too funny! Keep making these haha
---
I see myself in an SWF messaging the killer to let us do this and he can kill us afterwards. Win-win.
---
I call him Billiam, i dont know why
---
People have accidentally been sent to the chapter IV when backing out of the rift. At least that‚Äôs how I got to see them.
---
Duuude. A good nurse is near unstoppable, but I‚Äôm fine with that because nurse is hard to use Imo. Spirit is just straight up broken to me, especially if they have prayer beads
---
Report both the clowns.
---
Really? I got it the first time. I used coin offering and so did my friend when she did hers.
---
It was just one of the first images that came up when I searched his name
---
What do you mean photoshop?
---
I prefer bumper for torch, trigger would be strange
---
Lol, can u guys see those Challenges too?
---
Jeffery Epstein did not kill himself.
---
Yes I am bad at this map, and somewhat new, im looking for advice in order to get better at this map, Im not great at pallet mind games
---
Removed we ask you take part in this sub before posting videos thank you
---
Meg's grunts
---
god im sick of people acknowledging that the elite murdered one of their own in plain sight because he has dirt on all the pedo elites and that the general population are finally starting to realize how ridiculous it is. 
---
why cant we just have the 800th mfw haunted ground get broke and not ruin post or another legion halloween costume post.
---
What elo are you at I was arpund 16.
---
I'm all for the remaining survivors get some sort of compensation, but part of me feels like this will make DCers feel less bad about DCing. "Ugh, Freddy again? At least now I'll give my teammates some free BPs"
---
I wonder how many shards you get if you actually complete that level.
---
Lmaooo
---
10 or so.  It was late at night too.
---
Yea it lets me see the 4th stage and almost all of the challenges are complete in the same trail which is aids
---
lovely lol
---
Yeah, I had a similar experience- someone came up and started healing me but ran away when the killer got close, and a moment later I got "Abandoned" points. And I was like, Wtf? Do they give you points if you leave a teammate injured?
---
Are you sure you're looking at the [same one](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Herman_Carter)?
---
* `Treatment mode still allows The Doctor to do normal interactions such as vaulting windows, damaging generators, breaking pallets and grabbing Survivors.` This means *all* grabs.
---
* Iridescent Calm will last forever - like most of the Iridescent King effects. Only two of them can be mitigated by staying out of T3 Madness. `If you shock a Survivor often enough, they will eventually have all types of afflictions simultaneously.`
---
* Calm (all kinds) does not alter anyone's Terror Radius, and neither does Discipline (all kinds).
---
* There is no visual indicator for Doc's afflictions, so just Shock them 5 times.
---
`This text` indicates a direct quote from the wiki. I would not recommend Treatment-only Doctor - in fact most high-end Doctor setups are going to involve staying out of Treatment Mode as much as possible.
---
3 people can escape with 1 gen remaining via hatch if I'm not mistaken.
---
I hope we can do it in KYF , that 2 flashlight saves in one game in tome 4 is gonna be tough.
---
I meant the brick part
---
Because they are. No amount of buff or Nerf will fix the character. Their design is inherently flawed. They were legit just leftover files from deathgarden that one of the devs thought Looked cool and because they needed a trailer for dedicated servers at the game awards. Not just announcing it. Hence why the legion was so rushed and basically just a rework of borrowed time.
---
Mending will never be fun under any circumstance. It's just another reason for survivors to hold M1. The thing they hate the most.
---
The legion needs their power completely removed and destroyed like old Freddy and replaced with something more Interactive. Buffing or nursing then we'll just make each side hate each other more.
---
Ha, joke's on you! I'm not skilled enough to get out of purple ranks, even with Spirit.
---
This is not any better than that oversaturated shit. These memes are worthless, just like Hong Kong it's doing nothing at all. Straight up exactly the same as "thoughts and prayers".
---
You realize designers that create cosmetics are different people than those that work on netcode and game logic. Right?
---
No homo
---
Don‚Äôt ask questions you dont want answers too
---
The only solution I can see for this is if master challenges can be completed like a normal challenge, but just a higher amount of times. Like this one can be also done if you do it 8 times over in a bunch of games. Just an example.
---
maybe someone will finally play him then
---
I don't think its underated, its in almost every stealth and gen rush build. Still an awesome perk, tho
---
I'd just like to point out what thread your in. Feel free to try again some time. Most of your "point" fail to hit absolutely any mark, and others I don't even know what you're talking about or trying to say.
---
You're wrong on a lot of points just straight proving to me you don't play survivor, or don't play it much, definitely not outside of an SWF. Not understanding how other survivors work against you is by far the biggest tell here.
---
You don't feel the pressure because you're a killer main, not because it doesn't exist. Not being active at all times is the most absurd idea I've ever seen for why you don't feel pressure haha. It's like you've never even played and you're just going off of what you think survivors do, like they're just relaxing having a bath whole they wait for you, as opposed to trying to make up for the failings of their team, outplay you, work around you and the other survivors, manage their time the same as you on killer, etc. 
---
You really need more time I survivor. It shows heavily.
---
**Edit: You're actually so clearly a killer main. I turned off replies and just need to not reply to you. It seems other killer mains are upvoting your original post which is absurd. Imagine actually thinking there isn't pressure when playing survivor, but there is while playing Killer. If you think this, you are the problem with this community. That's a straight fact, no opinions.**
---
So it hasn‚Äôt worked on these killers for me since the update. I guess I could be wrong but it seems like they aren‚Äôt triggering it for me.
---
Honestly people are probably gonna derank just so they can do these challenges on both sides. God who thought these were a good idea

There are a bunch of youtubers who go in depth about DBD, nototzdarva is popular here and he's great at explaining perk builds. I learned a boatload from watching him and others.

No... It's sarcasm genius.

This legit made me snort lul
---
no they dont. the only thing you need to have as spirit is two working ears and a headset. nurse you are right 100% tho

They‚Äôll probably up Billy‚Äôs rev time and make it so his chainsaw sprint has a short limited duration and he can‚Äôt traverse maps with it anymore.
---
Hag I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôll make it so she can‚Äôt place any traps ‚Äútoo close together‚Äù but make that range like 15 meters
---
Lol thanks for the monologue, but I don't disagree with you. I'm just saying OP's post is unoriginal.
---
Absolutely love these! Would so much rather have any of them than a licensed killer. Hope that Twitter follow to Stephen King means he comes up with a new concept just for DBD.

No spine chill works. It's just aura reading that doesnt

Imb√©cil! *stabs*
---
Quick question - bumpers are the bigger ones on bottom and triggers are the top l1/r1 buttons, right?
---
That seems too evil, I'd say only have that if they're already searching the boxes before their timer starts.
---
I was wondering when someone would mention this. There's also one that's *kill four survivors in the basement in a single trial* it's like the devs WANT us to be more toxic
---
That sounds like a fun build. I bought Freddy a couple of weeks ago but didn't have so much fun playing him, looks like I need to give him another shot.
---
I'm still confused. I'm guessing you're quoting a part of the movie I've forgotten? Were still talking about rocky horror picture show right?
---
It‚Äôs so well edited, like a popular YouTuber vid! Nice work Myers &lt;3

And then let there be 4. Sorry, I didn't see that last part somehow.

So many times I've tried to put scratch marks on a locker and then walk elsewhere, but they always catch me plain view before I can hide elsewhere.

I haven't seen it in quite a while, I just remember that song and scene. I really need to rewatch it.

I mean I forgot to add that part, there would be only like 3 or 4 boxes to search from.
---
The absolute mad lad...he fucking did it
---
#Bold of you to assume I dont want the answer

Also, the higher prestige the character is, *supposedly* you get more rare items in their bloodwebs. Never noticed much of a change myself but eh ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
"Blind the killer while they are carrying 2 survivors at a time(s)."
---
They still have like a month and a half to possible change them and you can't do them yet

 So don't stress it.
---
isnt the moon just lovely tonight
---
Yeah... with Ghosty I usually only see the perk light up. I swear he's fucking invisible on some maps, lol.
---
**scarred nand
---
Those help a lot but l mostly use  steering add-ons(spiked boots) and and any other addon I feel like using but you don‚Äôt always need to use your chainsaw you can just mind game them and hit them twice there are so many places you can mind game on this map
---
Edit: spelling

Nope just you. /s

I see that you‚Äôre new, so before that one guy posts the massive list, yes the Devs know about this glitch. They will patch it in the next hotfix for Xbox users, and you will get all of your auric cells.

He has to teabag to avoid being exposed for you? Mine just sits there for 5-6 seconds while being stared at by myself and brother only for both of us to be fucking exposed. The mechanic is simply broken, Definitely needs to be fixed. Personally i'd rather be tombstoned

They have a tutorial?

Do this just for the middle finger to Jason. Please and thank.

He's all around just unfun.

I don't even want to think about it
---
I‚Äôm stressing :(((
---
Body blocking is only against the rules in the context of holding the game hostage. For example it is possible for bubba to stand on the basement stairs so that it is impossible to get out. If you trap say the last two survivors down there this way the game cannot progress and you've held them hostage. Body blocking the hook in this way is not against the rules in anyway
---
PC 
---
type of bug: gameplay
---
Wraith being pallet stunned while in stealth or being flashlight burned doesn't bring you out of stealth, even though you are fully visible to both survivors and yourself(weapon). you have to uncloak.
---
Steve‚Äôs built in perk: 
---
Banshee Scream  - Grants a 40% chance that the killer will want to avoid hooking him so he doesn‚Äôt have to hear his scream.
---
SO MAD ABOUT THIS! My go to was a green medkit with abdominal &amp; gel dressings, running botany I could get two heals out of it and have a little left to be able to take it out of the game. Now I get two heals and it‚Äôs GONE! üòí really, really hope they change it back!
---
A ban so that you can't enter lobbies for a short time? 1st DC in a day = 10 mins,2nd 30 mins 3rd 2 hours and so on

aaaaAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhAhaaaaAAAAAA

It should cost players bloodpoints to DC. You wanna leave? You gotta pay.

Legion, Freddy and Myers cosplays can go to the dumpster! This one is sick legendary af!

I found it really overwhelming when it all came out at once and it took a hot minute to wrap my head around it. It is cool and all but it's alot to take in for people who have never had something like this. If you have never owned or seen a season/battle pass then it would be confusing
---
Ok !! Good to know.
---
Killer: DIO
---
Ability: Toki yo tomare
---
It has to be done by the same person while one of the exit is already open. This also means there is only little time for the killer to hook your three team mates while ignoring what you are doing. I have personally never seen it happen in 2.1k hours.

Ah yes exhaustion add ons the devs said that are being looked into? Those ones? Pretty sure when those killers get add on touch ups they won‚Äôt exist.

You might have caugh some Plague

So I just checked and it wasn‚Äôt there, but I went back to the bloodweb and it appeared on the next go. Not sure what happened but at least I have it now
---
Spine Chill is great against a lot of killers.
---
Everyone can build out their perk loadout the way that they want, but if you want the best chance at surviving, you pick the perks that you think will help you in the most situations. If Spine Chill isn't one of those, that's fine.
---
I run Balanced Landing, and there are a good number of maps I can't use it on. I used to run Adrenaline, and it never comes in to play unless I get to the end game. Not every perk you pick is going to be helpful every game, but you pick the things that you feel work.
---
My build isn't great for all killers, and it shouldn't be. What makes this game interesting is that there are so many combinations to play with and against. You can experiment with loadouts and find out what works best for your play style.
---
As for counter play, your build helps with how you play. Ghostface does have counterplay, but you have to approach him differently than other killers. He's a stealth killer that you also need to play stealthily against.
---
You work on safe gens when you don't know where he is, and unsafe gens when you know where he is. Some maps will be a pain against him, but that's the luck of the draw.
---
I'm not a huge fan of playing against him either, but he's not unstoppable.
---
There's literally mist in the game which affects how far you can see. Survivors often enhance the mist to hide themselves better but for some killers (Mike Myers for example) it makes sense to use it too, as he is a stealthy killer. There are offerings to decrease the mist as well. For killers it makes more sense to decrease it most of the time so you can see them survivors better but it depends on your play style. 
---
Murky Reagent is the highest mist making offering.
---
Same. its been a lagfest for me too. I thought my internet was just being trash

Hippity hoppity my upvote is now your propety

So an unnecessary post game jab AND a camper? Sounds like a fun round.

It takes 16 matches to level up in the rift?
---
Where‚Äôd that boy go?
---
I went through the exact same phase as you did. Stopped using DH for BL, and Iron Will is now my go to, I just can‚Äôt play without it. I‚Äôve also been using Detective‚Äôs Hunch lately, and I‚Äòm pretty much a NOED/Hex-destroyer now.
---
Discord allows people to communicate when they arent playing the same game. It's a great service, why do you hate it so much?
---
People complain about spirit because on a 1v1 level she can be very unfun to go against, which people associate with being OP. Though if you look at the game as a whole, a 1v4, most killers are relatively well balanced (this is not including addons of course).
---
Did these designers also implement the new UI system and Battle Pass/Archives?
---
And i'm talking about the overall logistics of incorporating those, which barely work, rather than prioritizing fixing bugs and fine tuning gameplay
---
Because it's God-awful garbage that doesn't fucken function properly people rely on it too much and there are other better things available and we simply don't need it on console because it's unnecessary
---
I have almost all the survivors P3 Level 50 and all perks give me a P4 please I‚Äôll be perkless but have the charms.
---
500 BP is more insulting then when we got nothing tbh.  A DCing survivor potentially throws the game, 500 is a fucking joke.
---
Wraith with pink addons and meta perks whining about survivors 6 ranks below him bringing in BNPs... checks out
---
I'm a devotion 16 killer main I'm well aware of how powerful survivors are.
---
But that doesn't mean I think killers don't have unfun things that need to be looked at.
---
With no challenges completed, and assuming each match gives you ~500 XP, yes. 16 12 minute matches = 1 Rift Level Up
---
ohhh thank you! Any killers you recommend? I‚Äôve only played the hag so far
---
First time I played nurse I got bullied for the entire match but I still got all four survivors
---
You should take archives into account. I already completed all the challenges. Even if some tome 4 sounds hard, tome 1 was very easy and I'm sure tome 2 and 3 are going to be okay. 
---
I'm already tier 24 and I haven't played that much. I work 40 hours a week and see friends on a regular basis.
---
Plus I don't know where you get your 16 matches from.
---
Usually I level up 1.1 - 1.2 cristal per match so it's 9 matches per level, not 16.
---
With daily XP it's 8 matches. With archives it's probably 5 matches a day.
---
I mean every other stealth killer is either slowed in cloak or can't attack while cloaked. Idk why Ghostface is the exception to this.
---
Shut up.
---
Oh ok lol. It's just the other guy saying "fuck discord" made me think that you also thought that way
---
Spirit is getting changed because she has no counterplay at all, she needs to be changed. Hag and Billy have counterplay, they are fine.
---
Wait for it in the shrine
---
Yes, we know.
---
Don‚Äôt you mean haunted grounds?
---
I didn't ignore anything you said. I supported you when you said you shouldn't have to run a certain perk, AND I provided brief details on some counter play. I can offer more ideas later, but I'm in a vehicle and getting motion sick while looking at my phone.
---
Mnk, the only games that I actually play with a controller are racing games (because buttons suck for cars), platformers (Cuphead, Dead Cells) or Souls games. Everything else is MnK. I feel like a lot of times survivors would easily juke me if I didn¬¥t have the ability to do a 180 with my mouse.
---
same didnt pay attention to it ive used at least 10+ offerings today most have at least lost 300k+ cus of this bug
---
Yeah, I mean who wants to see posts about something the devs may not change, and leave ridiculous to point that everyone feels the need to make so many posts about said ridiculous challenges?
---
You know what? I think what we really need are more of the same shitty memes plastered across the first and second pages. Yeah. Fuckin' a bruther I don't come here for discussion
---
I level up one level per match and it's 10 cristals to get a level so it's 10 matches, not 16.
---
Counter build is not the same as counterplay.
---
Escape if you're gay is equally potent
---
Imagine the potential for a map to like maybe a big ass spooky mansion
---
Mom said it's my turn to post the level 4 challenges now!
---
The full health survivor.  The injured survivor has to heal (1 person not doing gens for a while or 2 people not doing gens for a shorter amount of time) or be a 1-hit down later.  The full health survivor is getting chased instead of doing gens.  So when you go after the full health survivor, you put pressure on 2-3 people.  If you tunnel the unhooked survivor, you only put pressure on 1.
---
Yes, everyone's seen this.
---
Change addons and make it so her hearing of pain grunts becomes allocated to 8 cardinal directions while phasing.
---
I play with a controller except for when I play killer, I really only use m&amp;k for first person games, even then if there is no pressure/competition I'll use a controller, it's just easier to sit back and relax with a a controller.
---
Dead Hard isn‚Äôt used to do epic killer jukes, it‚Äôs used as a get out of jail free card if you get greedy on a loop and try to go around an extra time instead of dropping the pallet. Dead Hard‚Äôs the best because when it‚Äôs used correctly it‚Äôs  actually uncounterable and can be used at basically every loop in the game. 
---
Anyways, my perks are Aftercare for underrated and NOED for overrated
---
Nah, you lose everything. At least I've never got to keep anything after prestige.
---
Actually I do respect that you gave an example of a counterplay. Even if it's not strong or reliable that's more than anyone else I've talked to has said.
---
So addressing you and u/OriginalZumbie, you both have fair points. I've counted the total fragments and from the Level 1 challenge web you get 80 fragments, meaning 8 rank ups. Assuming all 4 have 80 (Which to be fair we shouldn't do, because it looks like we'll be getting more fragments due to more challenges being considered"Master" challenges, which give 5 fragments instead of 3) that shaves off a total of 320 fragments from the 700 needed to max out the rift. So assuming you complete every challenge, you still need 380 shards total to complete. So with that in mind, the number of matches gets nearly cut in thirds, only requiring five matches a day assuming I didn't fuck up my math, which is a possibility. Huh...
---
Thanks for calling me out guys, didn't realize the challenges added up so much. I'm still a little nervous, but less so now. :)
---
And that's why we don't need it on console.
---
 Besides PC gaming is overpriced garbage that isn't worth the money you spend on it
---
It's still bad now
---
Just wait (c)

Hm. I couldve sworn my little brother got to keep his oranges after prestiging. My bad

game is being a dick try going the survivor and hope for the best

Here's what this perk brings to the game:
---
For Survivors-
---
\-At least one chest always spawns in the basement. Allowing survivors to spend time preparing for a Basement Hook scenario would give them an interesting counterplay for saving a survivor from being downed by the killer. If there are multiple Enchanted chests in the Basement, multiple survivors can be saved, although there is a risk that you might just teleport to the other basement chest and screw yourself. The killer would also have to enter the basement rather than just stand at the entrance in order to stop teleportation/Enchantment.
---
\-Exit gate situations might be resolved by the survivor being able to quickly teleport from one gate to the other, or at least out of the Killer's Whispers radius.
---
\-Chases can be escaped if the survivor loses or stuns the killer for long enough to buy themselves the three seconds needed to teleport.
---
\-Survivors gain survival points for Enchanting chests and teleporting. Survivors who Enchant chests gain altruism points if someone else uses them.
---
For Killers-
---
\-During the teleportation phase, survivors can be grabbed by the killer.
---
\-Enchanting is a lengthy process, buying the killer more time if the survivors choose to Enchant chests.
---
\-Trapper and Hag can trap Enchanted chests in order to prevent access or catch survivors.
---
\-Survivors can't tell if there's more than one Enchanted chest, making them potentially reveal themselves for a risky chest play.
---
\-Enchanted chests cannot be looted for items (which could prevent key plays.)
---
Yeah and now we have even worse killer queue times
---
Legions backstory
---
Wholesome conclusion :p
---
What do you guys think about allowing downed survivors to Teleport?
---
Just delete prayer beads and we good
---
STOP POSTING THIS SHIT
---
Bc people were spamming the button to glitch multiple killers into a server
---
You only get daily XP once a day though, you get 500 for a match and 300 for daily x2 meaning 600 bonus, but you still need to rack up a lot of XP.
---
Stop posting this.
---
Dunno what else I expected from this game... Serious love hate relationship.
---
Noticed I didn't even unlock the lore for the challenge either, bit of a pain, hopefully it sorts itself out. But time to push some survivor games in the mean time I guess.
---
People were fine with spirit before Nurse's changes were announced. Everyone were fine with spirit for \~7 months before everyone suddenly decided that she has no counterplay and is a free win card.
---
That one i did with a 4man group and i brought a coin, so that one really isnt that hard
---
Jojo reference
---
What?
---
Lmao what a peasant thing to say
---
Are you sure you get 500 max for match ? Because I've gotten 2 rift level in one match before (which was very long) 
---
And everytime I get more than one level (like I'm at 354 level 20 and I end up at 450 level 21)
---
It has to be while loading into the game
---
I'm pretty sure, could be wrong though. Will keep track of next few matches.
---
Best to contact support and try completing it in the mean time via the other side as you only need to complete one of the paths to get the completion
---
People were okay with spirit for a month or so after she came out, they then buffed her numerous times and people worked out how to play her. People have had more of a problem with spirit than nurse for months, easily most peoples annoying killer. She has zero counterplay unless you take an entire build around her. 
---
Spirit doesnt need heavy nerfs or anything but her best addons need removing and she needs some sort of information when shes phasing to allow survivors to respond to what shes doing.
---
Same, I have doubts now haha
---
All but the last bit seems pretty good, appreciate the detailed yet concise answer.
---
Oh do you mean you only get double on the event gens? If so that‚Äôs horrible. I thought it was doing double on event gens + match points.  
---
(Event gens + game score) x 2 = awesome
---
(Event gens x 2) + game score = not awesome
---
And luckily it‚Äôs not a daily thing. So even if we needed to play 10 a day (easy number to work with), I could play two or three during work nights, and easily play 10-20 hours over a weekend. Personally at least. 
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not like Apex where they have daily challenges. I don‚Äôt feel so compelled to HAVE to grind each day since I can make it up.
---
You are very much welcome good sir
---
2 hours left you can do it.
---
Got called a "face camper", among other rude things for using my haunting to walk away from a hooked survivor ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Uhhhh.... so your argument is that *you* don't like PC gaming, so discord shouldn't exist?
---
I don't think they're talking about the people opening up a discussion on how stupid some of the challenges are. Pretty sure they're talking about the 5 people per hour making a post saying "omg look i can see what the level 4 challenges will be! I've discovered a leak!"
---
And that right there is why the PC community is garbage.
---
 The garbage and elitist attitude.  Enjoy paying for overpriced garbage meanwhile I will continue to play on the superior platform
---
That's fair, I never said you HAD to, was just breaking down into daily to make the math easier
---
All challenges in the list require being done in one trial
---
Survivor: Complete 6 great skill checks using this is not happening, Blind the killer while they are carrying a survivor 2 times, completely repair 4 generators using dark sense, search 4 chests using the plunderer's instinct perk, drop a pallet to stun the killer 4 times, Safely unhook 3 survivors after the endgame collapse has begun, escape the trial after every other survivor has escaped.
---
Killer: Catch 4 different survivors in bear traps as the trapper, Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement, hooke 5 survivors in the basement while using agitation, damage a generator or destroy a dropped pallet 8 times using brutal strength, chase survivors for a total of 180 seconds using distressing, damage the same generator 4 times, Sacrifice 3 survivors to the entity during endgame collapse using no one escapes death, catch a survivor in a bear trap 5 times as trapper.
---
Really? You guys are going to ban tier lists when 90% of the content on this sub is just low-quality meme formats that vaguely relate to DBD? 
---
This is literally just a meme sub. An unfunny one at that.
---
Can broken keys even open blacklocks? or are they purely for aura reading
---
I use it because I get jumpscared very easily regardless of the killer tbh lmao
---
Underrated: **Haunted Grounds**, I think it is absolutely amazing with Ruin. Survivors flock to Hex totems in the first minutes of the game thinking they got awesome spawn luck and they realize their mistake soon enough. It often allows me to have an explosive start of the game where I down/hook a few people easily at the start, meaning less people doing gens and more people trying to be altruistic (which often then allows me to find them easily). The combo slows the game down by quite a bit usually. 
---
Overrated: **NOED**, I honestly never run it and don¬¥t have much trouble going against it, it is a dead perk 90 percent of the game, can be countered if you don¬¥t genrush and actually take time to clear totems (which I already do thanks to Inner Strength) and is only really useful with other endgame stuff such as Bloodwarden IMO.
---
Bit crap how it doesn't count as a kill tho if they dc on hook lol
---
Broken keys are just for addons
---
What about Jake? The aAAAARHHEEEUGHHHAA
---
Totally outplayed boi /s
---
When the clone of u with tits gets smacked
---
Best perk in the game at the moment with all the stealth killers sneaking about or demogorgon when it comes out of a butthole
---
i had a multiple killers match yesterday so its still possible
---
Yeah I know. All good! 16 a day does seem scary. Most games for me are around 15 mins including lobby time so that would be tough
---
Wdym?
---
1. Virgin Unbreakable vs Chad No Mither
---
2. Muffled grubts of pain
---
3. No blood trails
---
And most importantly, incredibly powerful in combinations with perks like: Self Care, Second Wind, Inner Strenght, Solidarity etc...
---
Dude you are back i thought your account got deleted
---
 I did the math on [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqw5go/so_about_them_70_rift_tiers/f6ali8x/)
---
&gt;So just doing the math straight up put it at 959 games baseline no archive help i dont know where 1400 is coming from
---
&gt;800x10 for 1 level is 8000x70 for 560,000/584=958.9 to round up to 959 games
---
&gt;If my math is right then its 83 shards in tier 1 which if its the same amount each tier is 332 which reduces this to 37 tiers needed to max it, barring complete archives
---
&gt;8000x37=296000 /582 = 508.59 rounded to 509
---
&gt;So 509 total games to play to max out, post archive completion, which can be played during maxing the archive.
---
&gt;Give a good time of 15 minutes per game is 509/15 = 33 hours of playtime, easily doable with a half hour per day of the 70 day span of the rift, as long as the archive 2-4 have the same if not more amount of points per level.
---
The only changing variable is if the level 4 archive was complete or if those were placeholder challenges, and how much fragements we get from the other levels.
---
That makes more sense.
---
It was just a prank bro chill!
---
Aftercare is one i haven‚Äôt used yet, but definitely seems interesting.
---
that's good. I didn't see anything this morning when I woke up so I figured I would post.
---
Killer queue times are terrible for me , i've been waiting trying to play wraith for my daily ritual for the last 25 minutes.
---
I don't understand. I'm rank 15, it's 22:00 and there's 41 000 people playing and it's during the event.
---
Jesus.
---
Meg and Nea remind me of Max and Chloe from LIS
---
Do people not realize you just need the perk equipped and not have to be injured. I just did the challenge with stakeout and it worked.
---
Overkill, killtrosity, Kilimanjaro
---
One of my friends runs Detectives and more recently the Nancy perk that heals you one you‚Äôve broken a totem and he swears by it.
---
Interesting, I have no doubt that I have the capability of fucking up my math but it just seems like so much as first and I'm just stressing out I won't complete it.
---
I never said it was. I only said that a build can help counter play.
---
For instance, if a killer tunnels you, if you have Decisive Strike in your build, you have an option for counter play. If you have Borrowed Time, you have counter play options for a camping killer. Builds are not counter play, but they can facilitate it.

&gt;Dude you are back i thought your account got deleted
---
18 hours.
---
Tomorrow i think
---
I would literally take terrible low effort memes over seeing this every 10 minutes
---
It's the fourth level, it's meant to be hard
---
In around 17 hours. It's what it says in my game.
---
Just like Ursula
---
You can make anything sound stupid easy if you just ignore absolutely fucking every last game mechanic. "The only thing you need to have as Legion is opposable thumbs and one or two eyeballs". Hell, Spirit is even easier, since you don't even need your eyes, am I right? I personally play Spirit with my monitor turned off because it's so easy.
---
I know you're annoyed because you've seen these posts many times, but please remember that he wasn't aware that this glitch is common, and only wants to show us Level 4's content.
---
You are wasting your time. People act like solo survivors don't even exist in this sub. Being able to rely on another survivor even at rank 1 is more of a happy surprise for me than an expectation.
---
The fact that someone had the nerve to say killers don't expect a 4k when hatch and endgame have been changed to accommodate this is ridiculous on its own. 
---
I love playing both killer and survivor, but find myself putting the game down much more when I switch to survivor.
---

---
That was beautifully executed
---
Streetwise is one perk I don‚Äôt use, but am always so glad when someone brings it. I should level my Nea and test it out.
---
i had a survivor teabag &amp; disconnect because he knew i was doing the archive challenge for killing all survivor in a match (mori, bleedout, etc)  
---
Luckily somehow it still counted &amp; i completed it
---
I don't see a lot of people using sprint burst so yeah. It's really useful even if you have to walk lol. Overrated has to be decisive.
---
* Screenshots highlighting common UI bugs and/or glitches, e.g. bugged Devotion EXP gain, massive amount of negative bloodpoints, not being able to escape, ... .
---
Honestly, yeah.
---
I would agree if it weren't such a time consuming task to perform. Not only does it take at least as long to break a totem as it does to Enchant a single chest, but survivors also have to spend time finding/traveling to chests. And if they want to quickly find chests with Plunderer's Instinct, they've already wasted half of their perk slots on something very situational. In a game where the number one currency is time, this perk would be self-regulating.
---
The really daunting thing is looking at the number of matches you need to play, but convering that to hours at least half that amount at worst, more likely 3/4s it. My games normally take around 15-20 minutes i never have anything beyond that. 
---
The only thing is that if you miss a day, the amount of time u need to play compiles onto itself and it becomes very daunting and scary. Just gotta got those 3 games in a day and youll be fine.

I want to edit a dubstep song to have the Wraith scream as a bass drop, see if anyone notices.
---
I agree with DH being overrated, not because the perk sucks but because I see survivors misuse it 95% of the time. For killers, it‚Äôs ruin. I‚Äôve had so many games recently in high ranks where we power through gens like ruin wasn‚Äôt even up.
---
Underrated perks to me are Stake out - especially for people who struggle with the aforementioned ruin skill checks. 4 stacks could get you through a whole gen with lucky rng. For killer, blood warden. It‚Äôs a late game changer that can bail you out without the fear of it not even activating (aka noed)

im so mad cause ive only done this once &amp; i doubt ill ever get it again, the best i can hope for is 3 with overly altruistic teams
---
My math was based on starting at lv0 with 70 days left, with 584 XP per game with no FGOTD bonus and assuming all archive completion, not on current time so it may vary.
---
Yes now that we have charms it's a great idea ;) 
---
Or some other costumizable ideas. 
---
So many options but we have nothing :/
---
Would making the Teleportation process  longer help with it being too strong during chases? Also, bear in mind that simply one survivor using two Enchanted Chests would consume at least 30 seconds of productive time (not accounting for time spent searching for chests/in transit.)
---
If you don't use head on you have small pp
---
Where does 584 XP come from? Seems like a pretty specific number
---
Yeah it happens about every 8 games for me
---
Same goes the other way around.
---
I also started my math from the beginning of the event as well
---
Source
---
I AM SO GLAD IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THINKING THAT. 
---
Adrenaline, while making for some clutch plays, just can‚Äôt justify the perk slot imho.
---
Other way around here, I have like 3 levelled Survivors. But Archives actually made me play Survivor again and it was quite fun. 
---
Really think everyone should play a match of the other side here and there even if you main one thing. Just to avoid tilt and show you the perspective of the opponent. Both roles can be frustrating.
---
Lol it's alright
---
Yeah, i sigh after every rank reset when i get to red ranks. It's such a slog of ass with no rewards.
---
Glad you're enjoying it :) 
---
It is fun hearing your friends freak out or get jumpscared by the killer
---
Yea play what makes fun :D Jfyi: There are a few characters u can buy with iridescent shards. Those blue red triangle thingies next to blood points.
---
I like this format
---
Thanks for the tip man üëç
---
Yeah I agree with both points you made. It would be far better to just punish players for it, because the former option is just making it seem even more okay to dc.
---
Ruin is such a coin toss‚Äîeither it **works** and you just steamroll the survivors, or it goes down in seconds or survivors just power through like fucking champs (like you mentioned). 
---
BW is CRIIIIIMINALLY underrated! It‚Äôs incredible how a 0-1k match suddenly changes to a 3-4k all thanks to BW.
---
Plot twist he has Judith's tombstone
---
This made me audibly laugh.
---
The "Killer Queue" shows how many survivor mains suck at killer but still like to talk trash about 'em... I do hope them being forced to actually play the killers will teach 'em a thing or two about the role. Most survivor main never play killer becasue they are afraid to facce toxic survivors that play like they do... so... yeah!
---
How do I get those¬ø
---
I know how you feel, did someone dc just before their last hook?
---
‚ÄúMore basement builds‚Äù
---
OH NO, OFF META BUILDS, THE HORROR!
---
This sounds like a great idea.
---
I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôve ever seen a battlepass give cool shit in the free track tbh and from a business standpoint it would be stupid. If you give good shit for free, why would anyone want the paid for cool shit, ya know? Having players is the reason to keep the lights at the office on, but it doesn‚Äôt help keep the lights at the office on if you get what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
And the only reason the archives get bloodpoints is because these challenges stick around forever so you can buy the game a year from now and still progress through them. Once this rift is done the tome will just cease to award fragments. Maybe they‚Äôll just replace them with shards or maybe they‚Äôll just replace them with nothing, nobody really knows. 
---
The point still stands that since the current tome is the most efficient way to level up your rift that making the part that will be up for the shortest period of time the absolute hardest is completely anti-consumer and will straight up not be good for the health of this game because everybody will be fighting to do these challenges in such a short time frame.
---
Snow Resort gives me fits, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a colorblind issue.
---
Ahhhhhhhh I have to wait another week for my next Rift? Fuuuck me man.
---
Welcome to high ranks a.k.a Toxic Glitch-fest Paradise
---
Seems like most of the event offerings these days are gonna be around again but not to sure
---
not being able to hear them when phasing+no collision would mean a walking survivor gives zero indication as to where they are, now what does that sound like? its the exact reason spirit is unfun to play against, you have no idea where they are.
---
Daily challenges should definitely contribute to the rift in some way. I see no reason to do any daily challenges as long as I have challenges in the time to do
---
You might be right. But if that's the case, I'd say that it's a bad idea to force players to do the challenges in one trial, because what if all the 4 survivors in the match are trying to do the challenge where you have to repair 4 generators? I don't think that it'd work out.
---
Not to mention that the 4th level will come out in December 18th, which means that everyone will have less than two weeks to finish all the challenges.
---
This very much feels like a shitpost.
---
t2 on 12th
---
HG is a guilty pleasure; combine it with perks like Devour and MYC, and you‚Äôre insta-downing people left, right, and center it‚Äôs freaking ridiculous.
---
Nah that was the weird part. It was a nice clean game where everyone was hooked at least twice.
---
Obvious bait
---
You get them after every match, just like blood points.
---
I‚Äôm going to say this error is on you and not the devs.
---
I didn't mind that one solely because it was either Killer (who doesn't care) or Survivor (Who has a pretty good chance of just being left alone while doing it).
---
I mean, I ran around a Badham map disturbing the crows while my team rushed three gens and I still got the Challenge done before the Pig disconnected.
---
Oh, did they confirm the dates? But yeah I agree there's hard but then there's this
---
So many people are running it I have to start moonwalking toward gens as GF or else they‚Äôre gone by the time I get there.
---
I used an offering and literally searched all 5 chests cuz my team worried about gens. These challenges are easier at yellow ranks. The other one completering 4 gens with dark sense probably just means gen progress not actually popping 4 gens but idk its doable too. I would say if Ruin is on doing 1 gen with regression is worth almost 2 full gens
---
removed for not giving credit to the artist
---
Yeah I legit screamed when I turned my camera and Meyers was like 5 feet away from me staring. Idk how he got that close
---
It‚Äôs soooooo good against spirit, Michael, pig, hillbilly, ghost face, and anyone worth tinkerer
---
How am i supposed to complete killer's challenges when i can't even find the game...
---
I see, so 10 minute total game time gives you ~584 xp?
---
Seems like Meg is the killer. The fifth member of Legion.
---
Been noticing that lately. I play survivor most of the time and lately I‚Äôve been spawning next to the killer‚Äôs ruin or something, but I‚Äôve also seen more use of small game (myself included) so even with totem placements changed it‚Äôll probably be hard to get away from it. 
---
Still, spawning next to the hex totems is kinda crazy, that should be fixed
---
Spine Chill and Empathy at rank 3 and you have a radar system as far is awareness goes... Spine Chill tells you when a killer is coming for you and Empathy will tell you when a killer is chasing another survivor so you can keep gen-rushing until he goes down then you can go for the rescue.
---
you clearly didn't read even the first sentence of my post
---
That's awesome. I'm gonna have to get better against trapper and pig before I can think about making purple ranks
---
SB was insane before the *Exhaustion* mechanic was instituted, but I just can‚Äôt use it these days cuz I‚Äôm almost always running around and I forget I have it on lol!
---
DS, while I understand why some cats use it, is just not worth the slot to me either; I don‚Äôt like perks that only have a small window of use, like Adrenaline.
---
He's talking about the Tier 4 Challenges that got leaked, which is stuff like "Kill all four Survivors in the Basement" or "Unhook 3 Survivors in the EGC".
---
You know, the type of thing that no one wants to play against and if someone realizes you're going for it they can just DC.
---
I'm new to this game but why are you playing this specific game then? It seems like you hate the base mechanics and alter the gameplay as a result instead of just uninstalling and being less sour.
---
This whole battle pass and tome thing is starting to feel REALLY rushed and lazy. It‚Äôs extremely disappointing imo
---
What do you mean try hard enough. Youre correct in your statment. But them making it just not kick the others from the lobby isnt an exaggeration. Thats like the baseline for shitty bugs they cant fix. Thats like THE perfect example.
---
you didn't even read the first sentence of my post. yikes
---
Skill checks in general seem just tedious, what if the killer fails? Sound for the surv?
---
Anyone else have a bug where the last challenge in Tome 1 won't let you claim it? It stays gold for me when I try to claim it
---
Nurse is wayyyy better than spirit
---
I can't wait.  I'm so sick of getting lag hit through windows and pallets when I know, from watching streams, that this doesn't happen on PC.  The combination of low framerate and bad ping really hurts survivors on console, I think.  
---
Also, I can't understand why children on video game subreddits always downvote sincere and reasonable questions.  Like, what compels someone to press the down arrow when I'm just looking for information?  It's really sad.
---
You brought 2 ultra rare add ons yourself boyo and a sweaty build on a map that is killer favored against people 6 people below you.
---
You can see the release schedule in the in-game news, just noticed myself. They also mentioned that the dates are subject to change.
---
&gt; Use the search bar!
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre doing great, good luck!
---
Me whenever I see Myers
---
I wanted to play today, but it's been 20-30 minute queue times every time I try to go for Killer and I've already done my Survivor challenges.
---
Im saving this because u never know
---
I think survivors shouldn't be able to cleanse any totems at least for the first 2 mintes of the game
---
*Epstein had Unbreakable* **WAKE UP PEOPLE.**
---
It‚Äôs not just that, it‚Äôs that these upcoming challenges are borderline impossible and are going to discourage players from playing the game correctly
---
You forgot blindness.
---
Lol okay buddy üòÇüòÇ
---
Bond is **always** in my solo survivor build; I forego SC and just bring a medkit for emergencies. The amount of info you get from Bond is insane and has saved my ass so many times. 
---
I look at SC as akin to a security blanket for me: it‚Äôs nice to have and makes me feel better having it, but I definitely need to learn to run it less.
---
I imagine it takes a while
---
Not OP but very handy. My tryhard build is: 
---
Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Inner Strength and the 4th perk you can use whatever, I often choose Unbreakable.
---
I made everything by hand except the mask
---
Just like Legion Cosplays, shirtless Myers, Scoops Ahoy sign memes, and people complaining about the balance of the other side
---
I dont know the exact formula but i think its probably around 550~ then a bonus based on your best emblem. 18 for iridecant 12 for gold or 6 for silver.
---
It's either that or take a hit for someone.
---
Dont throw a pallet to cover a trap unless you are in a  chase and can do so wothout taking a hit
---
I see, thank you
---
Flashlight save, Pallet stun save, Killer hitting you when you are healthy and you are near an injured teamate.
---
His other perks are... pretty meh I think, but Surge is worth it.
---
When you take a protection hit. Which could be by taking a hit while standing near someone injured, standing near someone slugged, standing near someone hooked or taking a hit while the killer is carrying someone.
---
LEE
---
I would agree ruin is used as a crutch too much and that it could use some number tweaks. But it should stay the same otherwise.
---
Ruin compliments plenty of builds, and its your choice to look for the totem or sit on a gen.
---
I have never seen anyone use tinkerer. Not that they dont but its pretty rare...
---
We already have a canon character (Vigo) who's capable of using magic and altering the reality of the Entity's world (Vigo created the Hatch.) I think it makes sense lore wise if its already understood that the Survivor's power likewise doesn't stem from their own magic, but from extensive study of the Entity. So it's basically the same concept as the other perks; Survivors are using a specific cache of knowledge/expertise that's available to them through the Bloodweb.
---
Disconnection means you've killed the survivor apparently so that's nice
---
DOH'!
---
I agree it is broken. I am tired of having to run it. Killers would love to do something different but you kinda have to have it to be competitive unless you‚Äôre really really good.
---
Lmao stfu baby
---
Thats called karma, and doing this deserves an upvote
---
I think SC is a decent perk its just that portion of players that don't know how to use is properly
---
Yeah but getting the killer to hook you has less negative consequences for you too. I don‚Äôt understand what you get out of DCing other than salt.
---
With that opinion, I guess you are not a woman between the age of 14-35.
---
just practice hitting the greats. you get better at it over time. o
---
My account here XD, no idea whats happened. Wheres my million iridescent shards Behaviour?
---
For clarity, it automatically logs me into the fourth chapter of the Rift whenever I click Select Challenge. I assume it works for everyone else too. But I can't go back into it if I click the first chapter. So it appears to be accidental access.
---
And yes, you can see what the challenges and rewards are and everything by hovering over the missions.
---
Your so cclose
---
Bamboozle shuts down the shack loop quick it‚Äôs amazing lol
---
I hate how RNG Ruin tends to be, ngl
---
**Overrated** Self Care. Literally the most trash perk in the game
---
**Underrated** Alert, Distortion
---
**Overrated** Make Your Choice. Or there aren't any overrated killer perks
---
**Underrated**  The Third Seal, Tinkerer, Unnerving Presence, Infectious Fright, Bitter Murmur, Deerstalker
---
What, an actually challenge? Unbelievable uninstalling
---
*Quentin, it should cover his entire "face"
---
&gt;Nurse lost all her mobility and traverses the map slower than 4.6 killers
---
The nurse changes were fine, I dont see the complaints, nurse just now gets punished for missing blink attacks with a cooldown. Shes still easily the strongest killer in the game and one of the best chasers
---
Legion got made shit but tbf they were beyond broken before. There isnt any way to balance their power its either broken or shit as they ignore everything with their power. They need a full rework eventually
---
Pig was a side effect of the endgame collapse, other than that she hasnt been changed. I agree it a bit shitty but there is no way they could leave pig as she was with the changes, endgame pig would have become boring af to go against again with no counterplay. 
---
I havnt minded most of their balancing changes, Hag was improved tenfold as was freddy. Wraith is still kinda meh but hes much better than he used to be. 
---
if im being honest id rather have a legion tier spirit than the broken crap we currently have and tbh I dont see them gimping her like that she'll get some basekit changes im sure but she needs some counterplay.
---
Every few games or so yeah, gotta pull up task manager to fix it.

Northarrow anger
---
I had this happen to me yesterday. The hat flew off when she was putting one on another survivor. I thought it was pretty funny.
---
In every game, events are for makin people play more, if u don't want just don't do the rift, u only get cosmetics anyways
---
I am surprised there is no Demogorgon's RAWR X3 comments.
---
Might be the survivor you‚Äôre playing, same thing kept happening to me until I switched survivors.
---
BHVR nerf map
---
This couldnt work because its based on tunneling one survivor.
---
You keep the item if you are still alive, because you automatically escape and get those survive points, plus any other points you earned (if it is before the match starts, you aren't going to earn any other points). Yes you lose your offering, because it has been burned for the entity, so if you had a offering that increases survival points, 50%, 75%, or 100% bonus then you would get those.
---
Lame if the killer/survivor DC (whatever reason) before the match starts, I think offerings should be refunded for those who don't DC in those situations (same for the killer items, which are used up every match).
---
This happened to me yesterday. Luckily I did it the game after. It sucks, but you can‚Äôt do anything about it.
---
One of my friend literally calls out things like ‚ÄúSqueaky toy is healing me‚Äù because of her voice.
---
*Evil giggle*
---
I'd rather have an ultra rare add on that would have X amount of survivors START with a bear trap.
---
Okay, just seems odd to strongly dislike such a fundamental feature. Like totally illogical and given no conscious thought until this point but that's still fine.
---
The survivor hivemind has found this post, excusing all they bs they came with &amp; putting blame on you for shit they assume happened to make you deserving
---
NVM saw the leaked challenges like, holy shit this is actually going to take a while
---
not according to the game. The pip system is official
---
Maybe a bit too "meme-y" for my taste but very very enjoyable nevertheless! Tell your BF he should def. keep it up
---
Never used Hope but have always been a tad curious about it. Adrenaline is definitely overrated.
---
Ruin is a perk that massively changes the course of the game. If it is never found it can win the killer a game. If it is found within the first 20 seconds and destroyed because totems can still spawn only a few feet away from a survivor to the point you can even hear the totem while you are spawning... the killer 80% of the time will lose that game.  
---
Me playing killer a lot and survivor a little I know how annoying it can be to play against, but I also know how annoying it is to basically need it beyond rank 10.  
---
Id love for BHVR to make it so the perk wasn't so necessary beyond rank 10, but since fixing their game balance makes survivors (which make up more than 50% of the player base) mad and it won't make them any extra money in the short run. I am 99% sure that it will never get fixed.   
---
We have had ruin for I think about 2 years and they only did 1 change to the perk, and it made tier 1 and 2 more useful. They attempted to make totem spawns better and made them like... 60% better. Now you can spawn looking at one, but they can still spawn a few ft away from gens and survivors.
---
Calling it broken is a bit of an overstatement. Good survivors don‚Äôt struggle with hitting great skill checks and breaking the totem renders the perk useless for the rest of the match. There‚Äôs nothing broken about it
---
Fair enough. Very different from two guys saying "it's not worth it dude just run!"
---
Run spine chill is not counterplay
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: Splinters don't do anything. I finally got splinters to play as freddy but when I use one nothing happens and I play the same killer I used the offering on. When I check my offerings later the splinter is gone.
---
Technicalities rarely ever work in the killers favor so its a pleasant surprise
---
Imagine complaining about survivors not gen rushing for once and doing some other objective.
---
This really feels like a troll post...
---
SCP 3001
---
My brother SWEARS by Empathy, probably his favorite perk.
---
Meth is a legion main.
---
According to the game, the killer's primary objective is to kill survivors
---
Id rather have a weak killer than someone you can't do anything against
---
Even the rank 1 challenges change gameplay. Sadly I‚Äôve been that scummy guy already. Trying to get three plunder chests... see that one is looted. I instantly lose interest in that match and die on my first hook IF I get caught. Luckily I‚Äôm past that one now... but it will change how players play sadly.
---
Killers don't get penalized for a survivor leaving with an item. What are you talking about?
---
You‚Äôre frustrated, I get it, but that shouldn‚Äôt happen. You‚Äôre the first person I seen to complain about totem rushing, idk if you‚Äôre just genuinely not good with killer or you‚Äôre trolling.
---
Have you tried playing survivor instead?
---
Found the console player
---
Yes , those teabagging fucks deserve to get mori'd
---
It's not like this on PC?
---
Clearly, you were outplayed 4head.
---
As a console player that sucks at using flashlights... I am afraid
---
Accurate rank difference
---
Yeah man, it's great.  
---
You get to watch the killer close the hatch now. Lol
---
User name lines up.  
---
But totem rushing? Never heard of that. And from my games, the only killers who rely on noed are the ones who don't protect gens.  
---
Basically the game goes like this, they get 1 or 2 hooks done, the survivors are left relatively undisturbed so even while 1 is being chased the other 3 are doing gens. The gens get done, then the killer uses noed to secure 1 or 2 kills or they slug and hope that they can get all 4.  
---
If you are gonna use Noed it's fine by me, but you gotta make sure survivors don't get comfortable because that is how gens are done. If you are chasing someone for too long you have to break chase to find someone on gen to keep survivors on their feet.
---
im on ps4 and sometimes when we find a match it will say host unreachable and put me in a non stop connecting forcing me to close the game. it happens to my friends to so someone just soesnt get in. forcing us to leave the lobby set up another swf group then requeing for 10 mins
---
same here. pointless to even use the offering. 
---
it adds it to the match total and then my actual blood points count in the right corner doesn‚Äôt change
---
1 kill before any gens are popped if you are not dumb
---
Yesterday i played against a Mori and my Legend of a teammate pallet teched the killer into picking me up then he hit the flashlight save when the killer was trying to mori me. I had DS and got tunneled but i missed cuz i was too excited I got picked up when he tried to hit the other survivor
---
i want that back too

You have to unhook someone safely or take a hit for them. Sometimes, if the killer doesn‚Äôt tunnel, you‚Äôll get a stack for protection and a safe unhook.

ouch. I‚Äôll take donations for auric cells now lmao

Totems (countering NOED even if no other Hexes are present) are worth doing.  I rarely go out of my way to hunt them but if I see one I‚Äôll usually take the time to cleanse it, Dull or not.

But that makes no sense they are strong enough to casually throw a fully grown adult man over their shoulder and carry them to a hook and then lift them onto it and they are strong enough to destroy a pallet in two stomps

#DC IS THE ONLY OPTION
---
Dummy question here, but what is the perk that lets you see the survivor healing the downed one?
---
Some of these challenges are near impossible if you solo, especially if you got another player trying to earn the same challenge.. Been doing the 3 chest w/ plunderers for about 2 days, bring the coin for 2 extra chests and they all been raided where usually they don't get touched
---
Is that the spelling they used as well or did you exaggerate
---
Copied letter-for-letter
---
Don‚Äôt you know your supposed to let the survivors stun you and get the save it‚Äôs in chapter 235 section 86 paragraph 13 in the survivor rules for killers
---
I think this chapter will really hook new players...
---
i just got fuckin destroyed by a trapper
---
When people ask me what is the best killer in the game i tell em "Altruism".
---
This goes both ways tho
---
So basically, don't talk about something that you don't know shit about
---
I'm more like his cousin, the crapper.

Yooo anyone know the name of this show!?

I'm seeing a lot of survivor hate, and I'm just gonna say that people who barely play survivor shouldn't say if they're fair or unfair. I understand the community is toxic and that's a big part of what causes problems, but being toxic to one side or the other isn't gonna help.   
---
There are bad and good days, and that's all the game comes down to. No matter what, your victory is all luck based, you could bring bad perks and survivors could have good perks, or vice versa, it's all luck and getting upset with things that one half of the game has is just dumb. You take your wins when you get them, you take your losses when you get them, if you can't handle that on either side, then don't play.   
---
If you like the game enough to play it, you don't need to be toxic about the other group, because at that point, you should just stop playing.
---
You would be correct
---
You have a really good question and now I want to know the answer
---
I believe the rule is "the futa is always bigger"
---
Yea vigo is a dude,,,,
---
Escape hatch to Israel if you know what I'm saying
---
1. Dig or force a passage underground or through something.
---
Going for one Survivor and no one else even if they are bodyblocking you. You want to kill the person as fast a possible and only focus on that one guy the entire match
---
the fully prestiged Jeff club May soon welcome you
---
It's not better than Ruin.
---
The 4 gens that aren't blocked can still be repaired *dummy-fast*. Plus, Ruin can occasionally last 5+ minutes into the match. CI CANNOT do that.
---
Since killers host the game, they usually win in situations where survivor is immobile but has no invincibility frames (like vaulting).  It can be hard to hit a laggy survivor during a chase, though.  But often if I just lunge, I will watch the survivor teleport several feet in front of my blade and watch the blade slice air, but the survivor will still go down.  The situation is just pretty poor all around but it definitely hurts survivors more, as there is actually something at stake with survivor (you can be injured and downed, and you are slower and often immobile during vaults and pallet drops).  By contrast, even the odd lag whiff for killer won't radically change the game except in a really clutch situation, and in my experience I receive cheap lag hits as killer more often than I miss true hits.
---
Overcharge isn't really a threat to decent players. If you were going to run Overcharge, Hex: Ruin is nearly guaranteed to get you better mileage. Monitor is very versatile, though.
---
Clown has good perks, despite being a bad character. Two, at least.
---
Discordance (Legion perk) is actually ideal at level 1, so it's a nice one to pick up, as well.
---
I'm assuming you already own everyone, though. Rather than buy anyone fresh, I'd agree with getting Nurse perks.
---
The real answer. Tunneling doesn't matter and if the killer tunnels and you don't have borrowed time or DS then you should be working on gens and not getting caught by the killer
---
Thats true, but again, are just cosmetics, they have no impact in nothing, yes, it kinda sucks that if u have no time for playin u gotta pay for the tiers. Its all business
---
I like this answer
---
Cool cool, sounds like I'm doing pretty okay in that instance.
---
I have complained about Billy since I started playing 2 years ago, I've got no problems with Hag tho
---
I was just talking to my buddy about this. People have certain perks they come to rely on but when you break away from the habit of using them it makes you a better gamer/dbd player. When I first started playing, I wouldn't dream of going into a match without self care, urban evasion, spine chill, and small game. Now I'm like "why would I waste a perk slot for self care?" Lol
---
people just now noticing like its a new thing
---
OP and frustrating. Everyone on my team usually DC‚Äôs when I‚Äôm playing against her and I do the same
---
did he get a similar weapon to this before?
---
I understand, I just want the Nectar Vial so I'm gonna try to complete this lol
---
Base kit is fine but annoying at high ranks because her add ons make her really strong so you see her basically every second game
---
I just thought about it. I feel like they should be able to, since they now do different things and sre both rarer add ons that sacrifice the medkit, but you never know
---
The three survivors that you failed to kill before five gens are done. They‚Äôve all survive that long so they‚Äôve earned it. NOED on the other hand is given to the killer for failing his job of stopping the generators.
---
This is a fact
---
ive had survivors jump thru the closed hatch mid animation
---
35 min queue times for both sides though
---
What time is it?!
---
Yea they would work together so if you get put into deep wound it will heal your deep wound and leave you injured doesnt help much. If you do it and get hit between 8 to 16 seconds thats rough and at 16 you will heal
---
Let's get Rin and Feng in there too. Have a whole damn family therapy session.
---
Luck with that
---
Also doesn't make sense about any damage you take in this game and can be just fine with a little rubbing.
---
I think this is one of the best updates
---
In second wind‚Äôs defense, it doesnt heal you. It changes the state of your character from injured to healthy at the end of a timer.
---
Bing bong boi got dem hoes

Thank you

Yeah I got a little carried away with the eyes haha, thank you for the compliment though!
---
Abandonment issues time!
---
Scoops ahoy steve always escapes in my lobbies (unless it's a streamer)
---
Okay. Thank you. I doubted it would do B, and I figured it wouldn't be worth it, I was just curious. I dont have the medkits to test it myself
---
Therapy time!
---
I'm done with my surv challenges, did 2 killer challenges, but waiting time was to much for me, so I was like fuck it...
---
They never said that. They said you are able to complete the Rift when you invest 1 hour per day.
---
Today 2 my team mates DCed at begging of the game. So i found killer and wanted him to just kill me so the last one can take the hatch. He didnt kill me he let me repair all gens but when end game colapsed he hooked second guy, i tried to Save him but killer downed me and threw me to the exit gate. That guys was pissed off. I felt bad for him until he started spammin me.
---
I had a game with a Jan and a Meg who ran right into my Huntress Basment and kept fucking Head On. Unbreakable, Headon and Diliverance. Literally spend 6 minutes in my damn basment with these two.
---
Just because 5 gens are done doesnt mean it's a free escape. The game continues till all survivors leave the trial either through a gate or on a hook
---
But did you know I accessed the level 4 archives?
---
Whispers is a lot better.
---
Hell even Fortnite does that
---
Yep, pretty much. Tbh I just put that Hawkins offering because I never had played there as Wraith and would like to try it with this build. Survs can use whatever they want, but killers apparently can't? If I was sweaty I'd bring an Ebony Mori lmao...
---
Looks like i can stop playing killer lol
---
‚ÄúHeres a little lesson.‚Äù
---
&gt;Instasaw ruin Billy
---
FTFY
---
Devs hyped it so up, at the of the day it's like: hey, we give you more "dailies", but you have to pay for them, get some new cosmetics and some recolored cosmetics, charms and that's about it.
---
our job is to please the entity. We please it by filling the criteria it gave us known as the emblem system. The sacrifice category is based on more than the number of deaths, its based on the number of hooks as well. If you dont please the entity then you lose. Simple as that
---
Let me guess, you're on xbox?
---
F
---
How can you tell?
---
&gt;Billy and bubba can easily gain more blood points and no instadowns.    
---
    
---
Ah yes, nerfing one of the worst killers in the game as well as making the power of a mid-high tier killer a meme outside of movement is a totally good idea.    
---
&gt;Ghostface and Myers could get extended lunge range on top of a movement increase and an increase to gaining bloodlust.    
---
Use Spine Chill or stop staring at gens while you work on them.
---
Charms are kinda cool. I wish you didn't have to select challenges though, I go into matches forgetting rift
---
The wait time to play Killer is immense because people need to play Killer to do the Killer quests in the Rift.
---
I have to admit, more gameplay sounds much more fun than "just grind," which is the game at all other times.
---
The pass also has almost no rewards beyond level 47 for free players, so there's a weird dissonanace. If you're planning to get the pass upon already completing it to ensure you get your $10 worth, there's this lag period where you might as well just not, especially if you don't have enough time to do these SUPER HARD challenges.
---
I think her daily is bugged too, 2 4ks with her and still made no progress
---
I always play against Ghostface so this perk is usually on my builds.
---
I‚Äôm deleting this post. I tried to delete it before it was finalized but it must have went through. I‚Äôll explain in the new post.
---
Hopefully you get placed against me as killer. I plan on letting survivors do the ass hard challenges if they cooperate.
---
No hitbox while phasing and some add on rework
---
Hag in S ? I tought she was Under B
---
Seems like green and purple killers are the lower queue times
---
In the latest update, yes. You also now get wiggle points.
---
You could probably throw Legion in their, you don't get that angsty unless you have daddy issues.
---
Literally just rework Prayer beads to have a hefty downside.
---
And add a vault animation, but that's finishing the character, not a nerf.
---
Is this an Xbox issue? Because I am.
---
Yeah
---
If a killer uses green discordance they're bad anyway. Level 1 Discordance gang.
---
You went for it and honestly, I'm not even mad.
---
Thats a pussy move. Thats all im saying
---
Atleast get destroyed like a real player man
---
I do. I think they'd do that.
---
Steaming??
---
Where I'm from that means you're drunk  :)
---
I run til' I find a teammate and make the killer chase him
---
this post feels cursed. its not cropped. it only has 2 comments talking about how its not cropped. yet is has over 100 upvotes.
---
im scared.
---
I like them still but i wouldnt use both at the same time. I like the styptic becasue it doesn't take away charges so you can still heal once and use it too. If i know im about to get hit i will insta and get the mend status the killer will still chase you so you wont bleed out and it makes a chase go a bit longer. The syringe is a lot more situational. Use after saving from hooks or trying to heal and stay chased another 16 seconds isnt that easy.
---
The map is terrible for anybody that isnt spirit so idk why people pretend its a killer favored map
---
When i use shrouds they religiously do exactly the opposite of what they say they will
---
For me, it isnt tunneling unless they are also camping, and then they dont go after anyone but the person that is unhooked no matter what until they've been killed.
---
It‚Äôs a bug they‚Äôre fixing you‚Äôll have all the cells when the next patch comes out
---
But the survivors did their objectives so they earned it, tell me how Noed is earn?
---
*Cries in Discordance*
---
How is that different from hiding in a fucking locker for 8 seconds
---
I know this challenge will be almost impossible but I wonder if it will count if you blind early then have the person dstrike out.
---
You deserve to have your idea stolen if you use mematic.
---
This is just another reason we need to remove leatherface
---
Yep, it is. It'll be fixed though any any cells you should've already earned will be given to you, so don't worry.
---
If people are bodyblocking that's another dude that's not doing gens.
---
This is a clip from Ardetha's video.
---
I concur. Not only matchmaking but gameplay has gotten significantly worse as well. Really souring the experience of the new content. Just deactivate ds and go back to p2p until they are actually working properly, i miss it
---
Not out yet.
---
I use the Syringe when I unhook someone else. Then we can both work on a gen and not worry about healing them.
---
I also run Well Make It for when I dont have a Syringe
---
-_- the update is not on switch yet.
---
I can't hook the shit out of you without getting closer
---
K then they just suicide instead, then what? Players find ways around this stuff
---
Source: P E B B L E   by Ardetha
---
Yay, we all got a smidge of BP and the killer mori'd us all!  
---
Huzzah!
---
If we are going by that standard how is Decisive strike earned? It is earned by getting hooked I.e not doing the objective or how is Dead hard earned? By getting injured I.e not doing the objective. Should they be nerfed as well then?
---
Blood warden and noed
---
For ranking yeah. 
---
You don‚Äôt lose BP. 
---
It will count against you in how the game determines your rank tho.
---
I had a game on the map with the like. Above ground basements I guess. I dont know the map, I think it's in Blackwater's swamps and it went really well. So after exit gates were opened I just said "I got time" and went and grabbed a toolbox someone who got sacd dropped. And then I decided "i got time" and went looking for the hatch just cause. Well turns out I didnt have time cause the trapper had noed and I had a problem.

I don't really think they need changes..

Maybe make premonition more like spine chill and remove the cool down.
---
Trying to learn Nurse blink ranges and charging in a live game against equal-rank survivors... just kill me now.
---
Hahah it‚Äôs not me! No worries :P 
---
The only time I did this was to a plague who tunneled hard after every unhooked survivor :/ gave him a good run but got camped in the end üòÇ
---
I will allow you to use it on Instagram, please remember to credit me though and thank you so much for your compliments!
---
If a survivor dcs it should give the killer all the points for hooks they would have got and should fuel some perks taht need stacks from hooks I‚Äôm down not getting full stacks of BBQ because someone dcs before I‚Äôm hooked
---
This is art. My chases end in 20 seconds.
---
Yeah, i think it's a known issue.
---
I thought you got 400 BP for the status change?
---
But it does suck when it‚Äôs done to you cause the stun duration feels like forever :(
---
If you can get to Rank 1 with Trapper you've beat the game.
---
Make premonition not usable in a chase and sure

Also, I think alotta people (myself included!) forgot it got buffed and just never venture outside their comfort zones, which as you said, is a shame.
---
Is Jake invited?  He literally dropped out of college and ran away to live in the woods like a feral mountain man because his dad was so overbearing.
---
Also Bubba... among his many many MANY other issues, has daddy issues.
---
And Ash Williams (SPOILERS FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD SEASON OF THE SHOW)  had a lot of daddy issues, though he worked through them and by the end of the series was on good terms with his ghost dad.  Maybe he could lead the therapy session  as a success story.
---
I thought it was fun though, I rarely use perks like that.  Plus when I was running plunderers for the chest challenge, I had a really close hatch escape with another survivor because I found a purple key in one of the chests.
---
It's rank-dependent. Killers are very strong at low ranks, but high rank players know where totems and gens spawn, have their own equipment so they aren't slowed by chests, often coordinate with voice chat, and know and have what perks to expect and use, not to mention: They can loop.
---
Killers have a pretty stifling skill cap in most cases (Nurse was and may still be the biggest exception), so basically, once a Survivor team is above that level, they'll win the vast majority of their matches.
---
It‚Äôs 16 on Xbox  but you‚Äôll only need one pip to go back to 15.
---
thats what a mori can do
---
I mean, DC'ing would be like killing yourself.

You'd have to like, bash your own head in or something. Lol

Someone give this person gold, I'm broke

&gt;  it boosts bad killers to ranks they don‚Äôt belong in 
---
Even the best killer streamers don't 4k consistently, let alone your average "decent" red ranked killer. NOED is useful for *most* games, even for very good killers, especially in the current super altruistic meta.
---
I don't even run it, personally, but I can completely understand why people do and I don't at all agree that "gates powered" = bad killer. That's 100% not true.
---
It was kinda fun, for the totems, cause it was like minesweeper in a way lol. But the chest one was just annoying
---
Yes a green Mori. We're talking red.
---
Devs have said it's lag, not hitboxes
---
Did they mention anything about a refund of BP? I was going to send them a ticket tomorrow when the Bloodhunt has finished about lost BP due to disconnections and crashes, as well as not getting the Event BP.
---
read, the post...
---
Thank you for downvoting me for making a joke.
---
No info yet, probably released in the future.  
---
Maybe licensing issue.
---
Now you can prestige and instantly get back to level 35
---
I had a survivor in the end game t-bagging on top of the open hatch vs me as a Wraith. Well, I swung around to his backside, kicked the hatch close right under him. It was the funniest moment ever.
---
Yooo is that a legacy Meg???
---
No lie, I was getting happier as I read the title of the post and then suddenly lost it when I read, " **They gave me 117,000 Bloodpoints.** "
---
Not to be mean, but you can easily make that in a few games.
---
With any other matchup, you could at least argue that Trapper's power can be a liability to him, but Leatherface hitting a wall is more likely and more time-consuming than Trapper stepping into his own traps, so Bubba can't even keep that point.
---
It can get taken down by bhvr if they se wit under certain circumstances if they‚Äôre the exact same characters
---
Decisive strike your wrist
---
Tell me these hit boxes + dedicated servers aren‚Äôt  a buff to killers
---
I will tag him on here. I still haven‚Äôt gotten a response yet.
---
Yeah, that sounds about right.
---
Oh god, now imagine everyone sitting in a circle and an Entity claw with a tie and glasses, holding a clipboard and pen having killers AND survivors talk about their feelings. Lol
---
*Why these changes...?*
---
**Premonition**
---
‚Ä¢ The perk needed to be more unique since it's so similar to Spine Chill that it has been (rightfully) dubbed the "Worse Spine Chill*".
---
‚Ä¢ The perk was designed for *some* stealth and non-stealth Killers, when it should be just based around stealth Killers.
---
**Spine Chill**
---
‚Ä¢ The perks effects need to be amplified and they need to be more basic since its effects now are quite random and basically useless.
---
Apply directly to the forehead
---
I think the main two reasons Survivors DC is ragequitting and spite. If they DC, the Killer will lose out on a lot of points and emblem progress from them.
---
I think its perfectly fine. Helps with gen rush groups in allowing some end game play that doesn't revolve around all 4 healthy survivors t-bagging at the exit gates.
---
*Finally get into killer lobby*
---
*Survivors ready up*
---
*Realize I still have a survivor challenge selected.*
---
So why do it..? I don't understand why people sandbag in this game (on either side)
---
Look, this has already reached the opinion field, so lets get back to facts. It is a FACT people dont give a shit about just removing a player off the game with an Ebony, so if you want to say you need to please the entity and any other bs you are saying, it doesnt relate to the current majority of players. People just kill survivors because they are bad/they had a rough game/they wanted to, so Ebony is bad for the side of the person leaving the match with one hook

Who is next? Demogorgon?
---
I have heard a few (no not just that guy) streamers say they were banned for changing the icons in their game..  
---
Is there a possibility of being banned for using these?      I would love to see if Devs have ever spoken on this. 
---
Whenever I see custom icons, I just gloss over it and move on thinking "Well I'm not risking getting banned, but they look awesome."
---
I decided to spend the bp on hags bloodweb to get hex ruin for ghostface, but I played this morning and got myself back up to 1mil so I just might do that. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth it though, I prestiged nea once already and the bloody clothing is cool but eh idk
---
I think it's already supposed to be a butterfly knife, but he only flips it around his hand instead of opening the handle or anything. You can see the blade flick up and the handle click when you put down a bottle.
---
Fair and balanced
---
I think its a great counter vs gen rushing. If you pushing those gens at breakneck speed and not, say, cleansing totems, NOED is there to punish you. Just like DS is a punishment for tunneling.
---
I stand corrected lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr3pwb/issues_with_the_rift/

I mean I just found out switch does.

And they're somehow better than PC's so 10 points to Nintendo I guess.

That‚Äôs pretty cool

u/tysofly
---
Do you have a Twitch? Maybe a YouTube channel you could promote? There's a Twitter account called "Perfectly Cut Screams" who would get a right kick out of this. Also, you have the voice of a man who is riding on a cloud.
---
dead by daylight royale, you heard it here first.
---
Plague stops being A-tier once you're up against loopers. Only needing one hit to down is worthless if you can't land it, and nobody cleanses at higher ranks.
---
Trapper should be bottom B-tier. The Doctor can slow someone down at a long distance if he gets enough Madness in. The Trapper can injure and potentially instantly hook someone, even while carrying a Survivor, at any distance.
---
Clown and Legion look about right.
---
How am i supposed to do this twice. Only made it 3 times in 500 hours of game
---
Have fun trying to get tome 4 challenges without farming, chief.
---
It's just a very well made red expo marker that looks like a knife.
---
The survivors are just rubbing if off their skin when mending.
---
Omg you should do one of all the killers this is so good!!
---
It‚Äôs a bandaid fix for something that should actually be changed
---
I mean, i never use moris but i dont think i can ignore a big m1 button
---
OMG TOxic sluGGer How cOUld YOu Do THiS /s
---
seems likely
---
They should add punishment for DCing players. Out of 5 games today 3 matches had players DC when shit weren't going their way.
---
its funnier when they DC after failing pallet saves
---
Exactly! Take a little less time rushing them gens (which NOED punishes) and a little more time on taking care of totems.
---
Its hard for killers to be toxic tho. 
---
Just camping and tunneling. Every other way to be toxic is probably banable... bodyblocking for example
---
Good point; I worded my last comment a bit poorly, so I‚Äôll clarify. 
---
When i wrote that, I had a specific match in mind: it was a Doctor (Ironworks of Misery) who got it in his head that he wanted to keep kicking gens instead of sticking to a chase, and When he finally decided to commit, it was me and I looped him for the last two gens, only to get one hooked all thanks to NOED. He even managed to get another kill (two maybe? I don‚Äôt remember) all because survivors suddenly forget how to function when faced with NOED it seems. 
---
So in short, NOED doesn‚Äôt necessarily boost bad killers solely (and even then, they‚Äôll only get so far, it just happens I‚Äôm currently in that rank area)‚Äîit‚Äôs a combination of that and overly altruistic survivors who suddenly forget how to survive and think that, they survived against this killer all match, they can do it again (plot twist: they can‚Äôt).
---
Wait... r/howtokeepanidiotbusy
---
He can't be revealed in corn.
---
Got it, thanks.
---
Frickin GeN rUsHeRS
---
Its a good counter vs groups who are gen rushing.
---
You didn't farm with 4 party streamers popped. Basically you enjoyed all the extra blood points and gave them sweet fuck all. That's why they were upset.
---
Lmao i actually giggled a little reading that
---
Solidarity is great with Autodidact, when you get those negative skill checks, you heal yourself past the 50% limit. Lol
---
Except Trapper's traps can hit the Survivors sometimes.
---
Claudette is the only survivor worth prestiging cause it makes her fucking invisible
---
Thank you! üíú
---
It doesn‚Äôt say that you have to save them. Just that you have to blind them
---
Yeah Feng getting hooked is loud but have you ever heard her cleansr a totem? Girl starts singing an opera
---
Y'all realize that the blue "uncropped" part at the top is where text is supposed to go? lmao
---
Unless I'm blind af and it isn't cropped.
---
I had to upvote because of the balls it takes to make a joke like that.
---
In theory, she's underrated. Her teleport-wait no it has a finite range nevermind.
---
Sooooo
---
I don't need ruin on some killers. Obviously, since I didn't get it until it was on the shrine this week. But on some killers, even *with* it I have to work ridiculously hard to get kills. Ghost Face without ruin is asking to get wrecked. Ruin is the baseline by which some killers become playable. At least where I'm at.
---
Its mostly there to punish gen rushers imho.
---
Love it!
---
The only possible cosmetic would be from his cameo in Payday 2 which would be 2 legal hoops to jump thru
---
Those people would be wrong.
---
Imagine complaining rather than being constructive. Lol tell me what counterplay there is to that build
---
Replace self-care with bringing a medkit.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Secret Neighbor is an awful game.
---
Plague can always get her Corrupt Purge if she uses Apples or she can force survivors to cleanse by stacking stall perks, which otherwise will make the game painfully slow for survivors.
---
or give their 3 unique perks a blood splattered overlay or make the perk drip with blood
---
This video is amazing and he was playing Myers. I think I might have failed No Nut November
---
I think there was something about this in the most recent patch notes. He now gets the "undiscoverable" (or whatever it is called) buff in stealth so he is immune to OoO
---
The pain of rank 20-14.
---
Isn‚Äôt this the same with Adrenaline?
---
Sorry for my english, I'm from Mexico :(
---
But he also can't stalk in corn.
---
BHVR: "We don't like farming and will make the BP cap per game so low it compromises everyone's progress in virtually every match to punish them."
---
Also BHVR: "Lol you're not getting these quests without farming."
---
Underrated is whispers and spine chill
---
Overrated is nurses calling and self care
---
Yeah... I'm saying even with that he's not immune in stealth.
---
If you're posting a format why did you add text to it as well
---
Didn't you know this is standard practice on Reddit?
---
Anything the mods don't like gets instantly deleted in pretty much every subreddit that exists.
---
Just run away dude. He‚Äôs really not that hard to counterplay until they fix it. Treat him like Myers.
---
It‚Äôs nice, it gives you like 25,000 bloodpoints if you finish it, and there‚Äôs two. I am also a ps4, but I‚Äôm new and  potato. Only level 15. I may try a killer someday.
---
if only killers could mix match cosmetics like survivors
---
wraith as well
---
Ghost Face and Michael will 100% agree
---
Got that one by ignoring gens and my fellow survivors and avoiding the killer all match. Escaped in hatch after getting all chests. Felt bad for the survs getting wrecked without me.
---
This video is some kitty0706 level animating. And it's amazing.
---
Inner strength, spine chill, 
---
Playing like an optimal survivor 
---
Medkits
---
Keys
---
Instaheals
---
Agreed... she's an easier nurse realistically. There's no downside to spamming her ability. Her ability isn't easily countered because most the time you aren't even sure if she's actually using her power or mind gaming.... plus her add ons really break her
---
Send in a support ticket, if you can prove it happened they‚Äôll go into your account and give you a bunch of bps for the trouble. My friend got around 8mil when he had progress deleted.
---
Counter build does not equal counterplay
---
Ugly????? That‚Äôs my favorite skin for my bb spirit ;-;
---
It‚Äôll happen eventually.
---
Btw its a build.
---
Its BUILT to be strong and hardly counterable without thw right tools.
---
If every build had counters, they would be useless and contra productive
---
Do I need to give an example of it using the original meme?
---
100% agree with empathy, I gave up spine chill for it since it give me way more info.
---
Tactical Tbag.
---
You are getting it, don't worry. The problem here is the following:
---
Say a blight generator gets repaired and you get 3k for it. Once the match is over, the 3k go straight to your "bank" but for some weird reason, the bloodhunt will make it 6k in the after match breakdown. Bloodhunt only affects base scoring. 
---
5490 + 5745 + 2815 + 8000 = 22.050. If you double it because of bloodhunt, 44.100.
---
Now lets add the 3 Blight Generator BP to the math:
---
44.100 + 9.000 = 53.100. This is what you got. It looks like you had 3.812 before the match which makes your total BP of 56.912 correct. 
---
Now, if you simply add to this math the fact that DBD is wronfully doubling your Blight Gen scores, it would be 44.100 + 18.000 = 62.100.
---
There you have it.
---
You also avoid DS by doing that, i do that too, but not to be cool, i just dont want to get decisive striked.
---
Dude its a build made out of perks. You counter perks with perks 
---
Wtf are you thinking
---
Does the eye really open?
---
No but what you posted kind of stands on its own as a meme
---
There is a reason why both sides have perks that counter eachother lmao
---
You really can't read can you? My entire post is complaining about the hot and run play style ghostface's currently use. Where they refuse to chase anyone and just repeatedly get free hits from cloak.
---
i agree with that, I played as Claudette for the archive challenges and there were multiple instances where killers lost me mid chase and I wasn‚Äôt even hiding/crouching and I don‚Äôt even have the bloody clothes for her.
---
No thanks, that's probably the most useless perk in the game lol
---
"They're just having fun"
---
Thats only do able optimally with a build 
---
Just git gud?
---
Honestly it doesn‚Äôt make any sense since both inner strength and second wind say ‚Äòheals you from injured to healthy state‚Äô
---
At least the killer will get points for the hook. Instead of being robbed by punks who can‚Äôt stand a challenge.
---
Not much point.
---
POW! You are dead!
---
I thought it was Andy
---
Frustrating because it‚Äôs just a guessing game, playing as her is fun because of how overwhelmingly powerful she is,
---
Those are abilities not perks that are given at the end of the game. NOED and Adrenaline are both given at the end of the game but Adrenaline is earned by the survivors for surviving while doing all 5 gens while NOED is given to the killer for failing his job.
---
100 nurses blinking out of the battle bus, incoming
---
Bill is used to it
---
You get 3k extra BP for each blight objective completed.
---
im so amused at how much the meta has changed, he was literally the worst killer ever not too long ago
---
I feel like I went a bit too overboard with the eyes but I'm glad you like it! (And it's a bit cute I must admit).
---
I've absolutely been that killer multiple times and I recognized with 100% accuracy the resigned pallet kicking. You get that hope of "aw fuck yeah I'm going to catch them scooting across" but after the seventh time they don't fall for it, you just gotta remove the equation and try again. It's heartbreaking
---
Oh but last year it gave us more of the serum to get the outfits
---
Underrated: Dying light but that's probably because I'm a filthy Legion main.
---
Overrated: Dead hard, like seriously just use Lithe or sprint burst. Can't be hit if you're already really far away.
---
Spirit is not "Op". She just doesn't have decent counterplay for survivors. there are 2 recently uploaded videos by 2 popular dbd streamers have explained it pretty well.
---
This is why they need to buff trapper. Escaping on first try is not FUN.
---
And what would that accomplish?  They are still stuck in the game?  Only way that would be fair is of to could remove those points if the person doesn‚Äôt finish the match.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with him then?
---
But as I said those perks I mentioned earlier are given to survivors for failing their job
---
I had a David tbag me real hard near the exit gates. All he had to do was walk an inch to leave but nope he decides to go full ham when tbagging. Guess he didn‚Äôt realize that I stalked him to a one hit before he revealed me. I quickly ran up to him and downed em and was able to hook em. I can only imagine the look on his face.
---
I did it first try and even got a key, managed to escape lol
---
guys this is a TEMPLATE. not a finished meme, it's a TEMPLATE
---
Actually asking using this is not happening should have been on the level 4 tome
---
That, is understandable. But you kind of missed what I was trying to say. Imma just give an example of how this format is intended to be used, using the original format:  [https://i.redd.it/82si3izqc7l21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/82si3izqc7l21.jpg)
---
That sucks.  Same thing cost me the xbox version of the achievement the other day so i feel your pain
---
Decutor you are a god amongst men in this subreddit
---
No youre not bad. But you should also never DC
---
There is no rule saying you have to let all the survivors live when someone quits
---
All of the tome 4 ones are real. I got to see then early yesterday, and they're all super fucking hard.
---
You are missing the point to where it‚Äôs not worth trying to explain to you.  You‚Äôre talking about abilities I‚Äôm talking about end game perks, perks that only activate after all gens are completed.
---
Wait, I never even thought of that. You are a genius
---
Ruin is mandatory at red ranks so no not toxic.
---
i completed all the archive challenges with claudette cause its so easy to stun the killer find a corner &amp; just crouch
---
IM DED!!
---
im upset they changed the blind from flashlights or firecrackers to not eye rape u anymore, i enjoyed it as killer not period blood on my screen
---
cranky because you never bothered to learn how to counterplay her
---
You don't have to do archive to get tiers what kind of logic is this?
---
About as useful as running away from a myers that needs 5 seconds to hit Tier 3
---
I just use it to deal with spirit and nurse. But the extra speed helps too.
---
you know he was raging mad hard after that. Surprised he didn‚Äôt dc. Poor david
---
When a survivor touches a generator, they gain the exhaustion status with a cooldown set to 3 seconds. If they have a longer exhaustion than that, they do not recover from exhaustion.
---
Upon leaving the generator, the 3 second exhaustion will recover to not exhausted in 3 seconds.
---
Nobody is saying she broke the rules.
---
Yep done that once too funny af
---
Can‚Äôt say i‚Äôm sorry for you based on your Killer, build and add-ons.
---

Idc about when they activate anymore. I'm just pointing out how there are many perks in this game that activate only when the opposing side does certain actions and how they dont exactly deserve it as in essence they just failed their objective/got outplayed
---
Not an excuse.

Outplayed üò§üò§üò§

This alert is an extremely underrated perk

No you won't be banned as what you did isn't reportable, they'll just be ignored

I felt a little bad when I did it but i already had one escape so I just had to finish it

Stuff like that makes me want to DC from real life
---
Literally just modify her add ons.

Also like why aren't they buffing the Pig first like c'mon guys.

Ok good. That‚Äôs what I thought but I didn‚Äôt know if there was an automated ban system. Like I said I have proof of me having no wrong doings

They dont work together. Tried and didnt get the endurance effect
---
No they are being babies, mad because they lost check the game rules if your really worried but as long as you don‚Äôt hack/ maybe take a game hostage you‚Äôll be fine
---
&gt;Oh but last year it gave us more of the serum to get the outfits
---
I don't know why but they tied Serum to the Rift. Possibly because people have 70 days to grind for it instead of 2 weeks.
---
The bottom one is more like when you see the level 4 rift challenges...
---
You have nothing to worry about. Unless you were doing something unorthodox like cheating or something else like that, you have no reason to fear being banned. If they report you and the reports lead to nothing worth banning you, then it won't happen.
---
I just had a match solo survivor and my teammates were complete potatoes. I finished 3 gens alone against a GF who seemed to be farming my teammates for chases, stalking, and hooks. GF sacrifices one and then starts dropping the other 2 very easy. I‚Äôve cleansed 3 bones but then I finish the last gen right as he hooks my remaining alive teammate. So I go to open an exit gate. It opens just as he gets close to me and as I walk through the gate he NOED downs me and then hooks. Died on the first hook. Seriously, fuck NOED.
---
I would of given up after 15 minutes of waiting. Lol
---
Actually you can send those clips and pictures to bhvr and report them don‚Äôt know what will happen but if heard it‚Äôs a good way to get people in trouble
---
\*Conga to to the crime scene\*
---
Damn
---
Does it matter? The killer is wasting my time if they want to farm. I'd rather DC and get it over with than let them get hook points even if it means I get no points and I depip.
---
The only automated ban is when certain game files have been modified. Modifying the max fps in the files or perk textures don't get you banned
---
Was fan art done of her and Doc in BDSM looking outfits,  Mika_Weiseth is the artist iirc
---
Ja ja ja ja. Mui comico!
---
My Spanish teacher would be proud.
---
Had this happen to me earlier today on the doctor. Definitely a new bug in the patch.
---
As someone said in a thread on a similar post, "Frank is a fucking glowstick lmao".
---
You would think so with how everyone is acting
---
That might be a possible thing I do if they harass me more
---
Ah entitled survivors
---
KISS MY GRITS
---
Its not in your best interest if that is the only person you've downed the entire game. If someone gets farmed, slugging them would add more pressure and downing the other guy.
---
Well I was really excited to play and I knew queue would be at least a little while as killer, so I was just derping around on cod. ended up going to bed after a few hours and was like oh hey i still didnt pop a match....
---
True. I don‚Äôt really appreciate the difference though. Some of these challenges seem like they might take some players days playing multiple hours to complete ‚Äî assuming it‚Äôs in their skill set.
---
OP? not in a traditional way, I think she could recieve many minor nerfs to up her skill floor and counter play options and still be on the same spot on the tier lists just how non-punishing her power is, and annoying
---
This is what I‚Äôm talking about whenever people talk about legion and Jeff interacting telnet always make it seem like Jeff was older no way I assume you stop aging in the entity‚Äôs realm since plague would be a pile of dust
---
Why? You can play by the rules and still be a douche. Those two are not mutually exclusive.
---
Not to mention lying about having a daily when that kind of a daily doesn¬¥t even exist.
---
It‚Äòs not that deep lol
---
I just meant to say it‚Äòs satisfying see them get pissed after ruining everyone‚Äòs game lmao. No need to take it so seriously ay
---
The best is when you tombstone them and throw their corpse over the barrier
---
Who made the videos? I‚Äôm interested in seeing them.
---
Trust me evergone in PS4 is like that for the most part
---
Just work through it. Even if you get 5 skillchecks that only sets you back 25% gen progress. It takes 80 seconds to do a gen. If you just hit goods on those checks it only adds another 20 seconds. You‚Äôll spend way kore time trying to find it.
---
I thought you had to aim for the face?
---
That's what I do but it would be great to know that that's not necessary.
---
Pebble underatred  dead hard overated
---
I was a horrible prick and sandbagged a Claud cos she took a chest when I was running a chest search build. Made me angry but then I felt really bad after.
---
Not to be a downer but once one thing is nerfed. everybody always turns to the next best thing to get that nerfed. At this rate there won‚Äôt be any good killers left.
---
Don't you worry, I got Bond, Empathy and Aftercare for your ass.
---
Edit: Very true though. So incredibly freeing.
---
No one's crying
---
22 people really thought this was funny...
---
I'm not sure what rank you're at now but please actively avoid red rank survivor until you can hit Ruin skill checks.  You have no business up there until you can.  Just practice man.  Skillchecks aren't that bad.  Ruin is a minor nuisance to good players once they have enough practice with their skillchecks.  Instead of raging about it work on developing your game.
---
Also please know how to loop a killer by the time you're up there otherwise again you aren't ready for the killers up there.
---
The thing that blows is that you can only have one challenge active at the same time.  So if you actually manage to pull any of these off you better hope you had that challenge selected as well.
---
From a FACT perspective the emblem system defines a win. You cant rank up from bps or kills alone, only the emblem system, so thats more evidence for the emblem system win condition. Ebony Moris dont help the killers with winning because the game ends too soon so they lose emblems. Therefore the FACTS are that moris lose emblems for the killer and are therefor shit for killers
---
4 head on + 4 Vigils on Mother‚Äôs dwelling for maximum meme power. Even if the killer 4ks with no gens done, the mental damage cannot be undone. /s
---
I justed use d a blood web shard to play myers.  What the hell?  How does he work?  Ghost face feels so much better to me.
---
You think that's easier?
---
Top one is level 1 rift reward and bottom is level 4 rift reward
---
This
---
the offering thing
---
Empathy
---
It's the completion reward for one of the later tomes
---
That shits over now mate, go to steam forums if you want to pretend the devs "cater to one side".
---
Sometimes i feel bad for going against baby survivors that are new so i will let them leave
---
Oh
---
Can that sub get a mod post saying it's for low effort memes? Like r/Apexlegends and r/ApexOutlands
---
I agree
---
Dwight also is on twitch, Puppers :)
---
Is it with all rituals?
---
The best time to delete this was right after you posted it, the second time is now.
---
They should allow that TBH. I don't think many people would cheat with friends  especially since there's a Report button.
---
I believe everybody in the game should be allowed pink hair killers included but there ya go
---
Definitely bond but only if you have level 3. Mainly because you can see people when they are not injured and it just gives you valuable information of what you should be doing. Also you will know when to and when not to go for an unhook. But bond level 1 was far too weak for me to use
---
BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons. 
---
i hope this answered your question :)
---
Happened to me a few times..... Except I'm a killer main. Seems I get the multi DCs to deny me points from my own bps offerings. Sucks. Survivors are dealing with troll shithead killers and the killers are dealing with the DCing dipshits. Feels bad knowing on both sides we all are leaving blood points on the table just to deny the other guy. I don't get what goes through other people's heads some days on dbd. So many entitled baby's out there.
---
r/dadbydaylight is over that way. But I do love my dad jokes
---
You guys are arguing over an extremely situational scenario. Either can be the right  all depending on what's happening.
---
*activates dead hard as adrenaline pops from final gen*
---
1) Nurse wasn't nerfed much in chases, but she lost a lot of mobility and map pressure. Because of her cooldown you can't just spam blink to traverse the map as you used to, and you have to wait a cooldown, which seriously hinders you. As you must always have a blink in case you find a survivor, otherwise they get too much distance and you lose a lot of time, you move slower than 4.6 killers, which is a fucking joke. And if you spam 2 blinks, you are not much faster than them, but you lose a lot of momentum in chases.
---
2) I recently posted how old legion could be made interesting long story short - he can't hear survivors or see their tracks or blood while in frenzy. He also gains an ability, which gives him strong bonuses, for each deep wound on survivor. 
---
3) Pig was gutted. I sometimes think, that EGC was only an excuse to nerf pig into the ground. Because devs clearly ignored the simple solution of stopping/slowing EGC while there's a trap on a survivor and did all that BS. 
---
4) Of course it is easier to have good killers in garbage tier, because no one plays them -&gt; no one complains about them. I understand that, noone says that leatherface needs buffs except leatherface mains, but they are so rare, that nobody hears their voice. While EVERY dog is barking that *strong killer name* is op, frustrating, impossible to outplay and etc. Sure devs are going to nerf a killer, instead of buffing a weak one. Sometimes they make an exception, but that usually happens when they remember that killers also need a treat.
---
on my screen the survivor to the left of me is merges into my auric cells and shards so for me to open their profiles i have to click their tiddies to open the page. Its WAY too close now
---
Nicely done! Consider using perks that give you extra bp, a single match as killer could net you 100k bp if you use the right stuff
---
You get more points for it, and more spawn in. Basically just glorified bloodpoint offerings
---
This makes the game less balanced
---
Nah, it's not your fault. I was just caught off guard because I thought they were going to give you a couple million bloodpoints.
---
Well,  
---
This one time I thought it'd be fun to run an end game build on Legion (Blood warden, NOED, Bitter Murmurs, and Insidious.) So, i let them do all the gens they wanted and occasionally stabbed people here and there maybe spook someone.  
---
They got really arrogant once the gens started popping, t bagging, clicking pointing..  
---
Well, the final gen gets done and i down someone and hook them as they opened the Gate. As i guessed, they turned out to be super altruistic, tried saving him not having noticed NOED or BW. They all died.  
---
You can guess how the end game chat was. Lol
---
Me_IRL
---
I've seen plenty of really great survivers crunch through gens without finding the totem or get really good at hunting for burning totems. 
---
It's an easily countered perk.
---
Yep.
---
I‚Äôve seen you on so many posts calling them out for just reposting the same thing lol
---
I want to love Diversion so badly, but I cant for the life of me get it to work lol!
---
Depends on the failed action. If failed setting a trap, all survivors get a notification of where the killer is.
---
This is just the new spirit nerf.
---
Do you play as her often? If so, do you have a strategy for larger maps?
---
Played against a Nurse just last night on Preschool that said "Wow Nurse is still stupid easy" in the post game chat lol. She isnt that trash now, she still negates mechanics of the game and can go through walls and floors. A lotta folks put killers like Clown and Plague in C tier and Nurse is definitely still better than both of those killers. B tier I could understand, but she doesnt belong as low as C tier imo
---
I'm on Xbox.  Game sounds fun on Switch, it'd be nice if we could share accounts across platforms.  I might pick it up that way :)
---
Do you stay injured to do gens and just dead hard or what do you do about healing?
---
Cause killers just missed out on a fourth of their hit, hook, and sacrifice points and while it really sucks for the survivors they can still continue and get bp
---
I‚Äôm grateful that Xbox doesn‚Äôt have the end game chat. I still have people go to my profile through my username just to message me but it‚Äôs definitely not as bad. it‚Äôs a different type of feeling when you‚Äôre being tbagged &amp; clicked yet still manage to kill them all. Shit feels great
---
Thank you!
---
You still get xp and gain rift fragments - albeit very slowly just from playing the game normally.
---
From what I've seen over my games: Killers get ~600xp/game - regardless of how well they do. Survivors get ~400xp/game if they die to ~900xp/game if all survivors escape
---
Likely they do just low priority and they figured people would want the party feature sooner rather than later. I‚Äôm not saying to not complain about. Just adding information is all.
---
I know my best friend and I did cause we usually do duos together.
---
&gt;But doesn't it also cost 3k BP?
---
Yes but every match also has 1 or 2 generators by default and you can only get 3k bonus if you burn an offering. If all survivors and killer burn an offering, that would be 6 or 7 generator. 
---
Instead of getting extra 6k ~ 7k, you'd get extra 18k ~ 21k (minus the 3k you invested).
---
I would absolutely love cross progression.
---
I‚Äôm still low rank on killer and sometimes i bump into them while i‚Äôm phasing and we‚Äôre both just dazed and confused when our eyes meet
---
Hogh risk meh reward
---
&gt;I‚Äôve seen you on so many posts calling them out for just reposting the same thing lol
---
This is more like a personal fun than calling others out.
---
Hey OP, there is a feature called the "Search" function, you can use it to find posts similar to what you search. Use this feature before posting images, memes ect to see if you are reposting something very similar.
---
But in general I think it's a bit silly to go balls to the wall *when you don't have to*. You don't have to make a build to find totems, just you know, play 4-5 games and when you see a totem, kill it, and then the challenge is done. Same with rooting through 5 chests.
---
Now when you have to do them in the same match, then it's trouble. 
---
I'm sure enough people complain, they'll change it.
---
Maybe its a bug that takes place because youre going from broken to healthy? Idk
---
And this is why I‚Äôm terrified when a subway feng joins the lobby
---
Well then it should be like more than 25 more (I think) and also it should help in the pups cause that might cause pips to be lower since their not based on bp
---
honestly how have you not been highered for the creative by behavior you did a great job with coming up with ability‚Äôs sure maby some can be tweaked a bit but still amazing and a deep sea killer would be great reminds of that one monster from scooby doo .
---
R2 while standing over a dying survivor who‚Äôs already been hooked at least once
---
Miss the old days, it's a completely different experience when you put a few thousand hours. The power role swaps around and the killer is scared of you
---
Yeah it only really works if say the killer is softcamping the hook like checking corners around walls and stuff you can throw it at a locker and get the unook if your fast if also got lucky sometimes when the killer is heading my direction I mean it's not a great perk but its not terrible
---
the diver reminded me of that one monster from scooby doo lol
---
Thanks so much!
---
Do you know when?
---
You people still complaining how Mori's are overpowered.  
---
Mate Mori's used to be Instant kill whenever a killer downed you for the first time a long time ago, be grateful that mori's require you to be hooked now. And it's pretty easy not to be hooked when you know how to run loops and use exhaustion perks like dead hard etc.
---
Happened to me yesterday. So frustrating.
---
Umm source of the vid? I want to know how that ended xD
---
Oh man I brought an ebony mori one time and forgot about it, but one guy was extremely upset by this and called me a slew of names for bringing a mori, but also for not using it.
---
but could you imagine batman scarecrow in dbdl? using his fear toxin as a weapon would be so cool
---
Have they been posted yet then?
---
You'd probably have a better time if your team wasn't always DCing, blame them.
---
Also like other people already saying, this is just "nerf culture", nobody was even complaining about Spirit until conveniently around the time the Nurse's nerfs were announced, and there definitely wasn't anything added to her around that time. Soon as y'all get what you want, you're probably just gonna start complaining about Hillbilly, then Myers, then Freddy, then probably Nurse or Spirit AGAIN, just take the damn losses man, there's no thrill when the victories are handed to you without effort.
---
I use Resilience because it actually increases vault speed! It's really good for chases :)
---
And I do usually sit on a gen while injured, and wait for a teammate to come by to heal me, unless I bring a medkit.
---
I have seen that quite often.
---
Bullying Mookel Myers is not epic.
---
I use self care and bond interchangeably. Self care when im alone so i can heal my self without worrying for randos and bond when I'm with at least one friend
---
I don't hate this. It seems logical and not too under powered.
---
Yeah, as i said no one with more than 200 hours gives a fuck about ranking and no one gives a fuck about losing emblems if it means easy wins. Also, if you take in consideration how much moris make it easier for the killer to get a 4k, he isn't really losing since he basically has a win handed to him (the survivors can escape if you try to play without a moris)
---
Do the bonus bloodpoints offering just give you % extra till the cap unlike BBQ &amp; Chili which by the description seems to be an extra multiplier?
---
On the flipside, Ruin can be broken in the first minute. And I don't know what you mean by "dummy fast" since there is no bonus to those gens getting done and those gens are in closer proximity allowing for a faster spot and patrol in the first few minutes. Also, gens can be done just as easily with Ruin active if you've played long enough to not be bothered by hitting the check. Better a guaranteed 80+ seconds.
---
I‚Äôm sorry father for I have sinned
---
Yeah. You would think it would be the other way around. 
---
Matchmaking is still being worked on. Previously, matches would be made faster, but the skill levels would be wildly off. Red ranks with grey ranks, all solo. 
---
Now, the matchmaking is better, but it seems like they are so selective that it takes longer.
---
We already have a pink hair killer though... Did you forget about Susie :(
---
You could be right. I don‚Äôt find preschool to be that difficult for her though, as it‚Äôs a relatively small map and the annoying nuances of having to change floors when chasing survivors inside the preschool and houses are things she can totally ignore.
---
I just got Iron Will III on my Claudette and its become a must have perk for me, it makes her so quiet
---
What is this
---
Imagine defending ebony moris...just because it used to be even worse doesnt mean it is good how it is now.
---
Man was on a mission
---
I dont think the majority of the player base can go an entire game without being hooked.
---
God damn man, on PC it's a god forsaken shit hole.  
---
Every match you pissed someone off and they'll wait to rage at you for killing them.  
---
"YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE KILLER HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO!!"  
---
As a survivor, I've had Blendettes, my own team mates, yelling at me for not killing myself to give them the hatch, despite them not having done much aside from hide and crouch walk everywhere waiting for me to die.
---
I've been a red rank Billy for almost 2 years. You do not need ruin on Billy, Nurse, or Spirit
---
I had a scoops Steve and we farmed after his teammates dc'ed but I had a mori daily :(
---
Yea the Dwight unhooked her and got downed immediately after, I thought he would‚Äôve put him on hook
---
I've actually never seen that I wouldn't play legion if ya paid me tho lol I mean imagine pink hair trapper tho lmao
---
Oh you! Why didn‚Äôt you say so sooner ya scamp
---
What a pain. This seems like a rather new issue? Or I could be wrong?
---
i‚Äôm just thinking how how much would they give you if you lost an account with every survivor p3 lvl 50 and same for killers?
---
GG P3 mods.
---
Or buff their unique perks when that killer is using them - for example, brutal strength on P3Lvl50 trapper = +20% breaking speed (normal tier 3), +5-10% trap setting speed. Obviously, the devs wouldn't ever put my example in the game (I wouldn't mind it, though) but you get what I'm saying.
---
At least make her power gauge empty out no matter how long she was in phase for.
---
