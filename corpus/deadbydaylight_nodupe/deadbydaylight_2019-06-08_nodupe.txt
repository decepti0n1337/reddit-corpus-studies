Oh god as a killer main flight of the rabbit would put me in physical and emotional pain.

---
Great ideas but that one sounds like a nightmare to play against
---
---
---
Nobody really cares about ranking up it matters zero in the grand scheme of things. I‚Äôve had many games as the clown where I play musical hook with the squad of survivors because they continually try to save with borrowed time and then I proceed to down the one unhooking. Rinse and repeat
---
Why would anyone do that, the two other survivors would just do gens and no 4k
---
He quit while I was at the exit gate what

What is going on here, Sir?
---
Nope. I must be lying then. Survivors are fine.
---
shit I didnt think about that -- perk deleted. lets not break the game here!
---
I love how this daily displays how stupidly broken ghostface is, and how he fails miserably in even using his own stealth and mark gimmick
---
when did ghostface get those white stripes on his head?
---
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE POTATOES ARE THINKING.
---
YOU KNOW WE'RE PLAYING HAG.
---
YOU SAW ME CROUCH UP TO THE HOOK.
---
AND YOU SOMEHOW THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA TO JUST SPRINT BURST AWAY OR WHATEVER DUMB SHIT.
---
I LITERALLY HAD A CLAUD ESSENTIALLY LEROY JENKINS US IN THE BASEMENT ON HADDONFIELD THE OTHER DAY AS ME AND MY RESCUED TEAMMATE WERE LEAVING. MILDLY INFURIATING BUT ALSO SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SHIT I'VE SEEN PLAYING IN A LONG TIME. SHE JUST CAME RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS FOR THE TRAP LIKE IT WAS HER JOB
---
Oh no
---
&gt; we
---
Us vs them right?
---
&gt; "Counter"
---
It is a valid counter, if that's not your cup of tea just learn hex totem spawns and cleanse it once it goes active.
---
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking for I‚Äôm not saying anything game breaking
---
Love it. Great drawing and very original.
---
Left 4 Dead is a game that is available on pc, Xbox and Playstation. This reasoning made absolutely no sense the first time I heard it and still doesn't to this day.
---
Also a shoutout to all the orange is the new black fans who know this queen üíÉüèΩ.
---
It also could use at least one good place to trigger balanced landing. You can fall down the basement stairs or use the tree in the middle, but the tree is pretty finicky and unreliable at best.
---
&gt; Nobody really cares about ranking up it matters zero in the grand scheme of things.
---
It matters to some extent. People shouldn't care about ranking up or down because it doesn't take any effort in achieving that but that doesn't mean the ranking system isn't doing its job. 
---
If someone is a notorious **facecamper** (you are using facecamp in your comments, I hope you understand what this means), throughout the course of multiple matches he will eventually rank down and you will stop being matched up against that person (at least you should). 
---
If that person is at the higher ranks and used this strategy in a match against you, he was probably playing outside his normal play style. He could be deranking, he could be bored or he just wanted to collect some salt. The reason behind his choice to facecamp is pointless but hopefully the next time you face that person, he will go back to playing normally. 
---
&gt; I‚Äôve had many games as the clown where I play musical hook with the squad of survivors because they continually try to save with borrowed time and then I proceed to down the one unhooking. Rinse and repeat
---
I don't see the relevance in mentioning this but ok.
---
It looks great! :)
---
No problem, I'm glad you liked my idea.
---
you can't count the pixels
---
Did you barely even hit them the entire match besides NOED?
---
*notices immersed claudette immersed in grass* OwO what's this? *pounces*
---
Well excuse me for thinking that you should be rewarded for completing altruistic actions rather than potentially trading places on the hook so that you can also get face-camped. I suppose you think healing each other and completing gens cooperatively is a bad decision as well? Which is dumb, because that's the entire point of the Benevolent emblem.
---
Mine is doing it too but after a few minutes it puts me in the normal lobby and survivors start joining
---
Probably the same reason there are a lot of lgbt people who like dbd, minorities like horror games? Idk
---
Imagine ignoring All the Stats which shows it has the Highest Kill Rate all based on your own opinion
---
I don‚Äôt see the relevance in your mentioning anything about the ranking system? This post has nothing to do with it? This post is about buffing a nerfed perk so it cancels out tunneling and camping that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs about. You brought rank into this and streamers that for some reason you care to talk about. And you‚Äôre completely in correct about the next time you see that said killer he will play different, it‚Äôs not about one specific person or killer necessarily, it‚Äôs more about the acceptance from behavior allowing killers to tunnel and camp and not trying to stop it but continually saying it‚Äôs not supposed to happen.
---
this is pretty neat!! :0
---
Because every time the Devs release Kill Rate Stats for each map, The Game has haded the #1 Highest Kill Rate Every. Single. Time
---
I not only love this because it looks awesome as hell but imagine there actually being a wendigo type killer cause of this if the devs don‚Äôt make this a skin
---
This is pretty much the first design I've seen on this sub that doesn't suck ass. Well done :)
---
Interestingly, the Friday the 13th guys are already making a Deathgarden-ish game based on Predator.
---
ROFL, so basically you are trolling if you think people who make a post are just entitled to make up and state things that are Factually 100% incorrect
---
I‚Äôd use the fuck outta FOTR. Excellent concepts OP
---
I love this concept! Hopefully the devs will see this?!!!!
---
Giving the entity all the best addons and perks yessir
---
This is how the game was on launch, remember? Prior to the killer point changes to stop incentive to camp. Just be patient, they‚Äôll figure it out. I personally hope the community stays growing and that all these new players don‚Äôt get frustrated and leave. Maybe take a break from survivor and enjoy farming the newbies for the time being?

I would definitely buy this! They should embrace this and just give us a meme killer.
---
that wont happen because he‚Äôs licensed, devs said all licensed killers and survivors are excluded.
---
Ahhh how I miss playing in high ranks
---
Drunk hump? I don‚Äôt think anyone has to be drunk to tap that ngl

At least I'd look good if I'm being tunneled while wearing this.
---
Thanks I love it
---
&gt;Is It Just Me?
---
No? I'm pretty sure most of the playerbase does this.
---
Because the gates are open 15 meters away and all the survivors are open, if he wants any killers there's not really anything else to do
---
These are amazing, I am more curious abut how to make these like this. Could you tell me which program you used and what you did to make these images or is it simply you drawing with these colors etc. It just seems like its edited and I wanna know how. Also very nice ideas, especially the bunny one.
---
 run away I guess, can‚Äôt have a constructive conversation about the original post have to bring in things that aren‚Äôt relevant
---
Puppers 100%
---
Correction, we have had a killer released solo, leatherface
---
i-frames billy, there are i-frames on the hook!
---
It's one kill, get over it dude. It's not a viable strategy and the killer will lose if the survivors just gen rush. Don't make the game worse for the people who play killer well and get punished by your overpowered perk idea.
---
Power instantly deactivates
---
Leather face wasn't a chapter.
---
but then we wont get... 
---
THE BEE
---
Ouch.
---
You‚Äôre ridiculous but ok, anything that slightly hinders killers are overpowered
---
TODAY I GOT FACECAMPED BY A BUBBA FOR LITERALLY THE REST OF THE MATCH WHILE MY TEAM FINISHED GENS AND ESCAPED. ALL I DID WAS UNHOOK BILL WITH BT. 
---
I GOT TO THE POSTGAME LOBBY AND HIS NAME WAS TRUMP 2020.
---
SO I GUESS SOMETIMES IT ALSO IS POLITICS.
---
Nothing Officer, you can move on. I'd never violate the law and let one of them escape :)
---
Except Billy can't actually do that because if he's on the other side of the map he can't see where you are and there's also about 50 obstacles in his way.
---
The only person you‚Äôre willing to lay down and die for, Ash, is yourself.
---
So you're implying anyone who ever let's the gates get powered is a shitty killer? Alright let me see your perfect 100 percent win ratio
---
so, I've made full custom art for some of my perks before, but these were based off of images I found online. I loaded them up into a free photoshop-esque program called gimp, made them fully black-and-white, scaled them correctly, and then began editing. its not that complicated of a process but it does take some time and a bit of talent. Let me know if you need more info. Thanks!
---
Its officer to you, for one...
---
It would need some kind of downside. Like a 1 time use thing or needing to be set up
---
This exact same thing happened to me I was 360ing a killer while a full health nea just sat there and watched he eventually downed me and I was so pissed
---
Hex: devious trap + devour hope 
---
This gives me evil ideas and I love it
---
It's a bad decision if your teammate is being camped yes. If you go for that save instead of doing gens, you're fucking your entire team over. You 3 can escape if you just let him camp. Yes it's a shit situation, but no the solution is not over buffing an already meta pek.
---
Just don't put me on probation again Sheriff... I swear I won't do it again!
---
**me trying to presteige my blood web just to get to P3 on said character**
---
I‚Äôd hardly consider ghostface‚Äôs release a chapter, have they referred to it as one?
---
Lmao naw homie you got it wrong. I meant in general.
---
This and that Feng outfit need to win.
---
Yup! That's why everyone was livid for a quick second.
---
You are shaming him because he DCed. If you want to post this kind of content, then blur out the names.
---
Man fuck y'all downvoting this chain of responses it's fucking funny!
---
It also has to do with the way each player goes, after a while i realised that the main goal is to farm BP so i run WGLF to all my survivors and recently when BBQ finally showed on shrine i mainly level up Killers so i can get it. I P3 3 Killers so i level their Bloodwebs until i get the perk(they didnt get it until level 50, only tier 1 for 1 of them). The couple ones i already have it, i ll prestige them last, if at all. So farming perks and making double BP events count is the way. 
---
Yeah, i think the reward is not good but i figured if i max them all to 50 and have nothing to with my BP i would do it anyway so better now than later. I would appreciate if the items chance was Significant better though, something like 15% better items(cause indeed the difference is very small) and if we got more and better Cosmetics, or Shards even.
---
BT is already great, applying that effect to two people is not a slight hindrance.
---
If you can't understand this, all I can say is get good.
---
The face reminds me of Brienne of Tarth
---
Shouldn't it be clown?
---
Usually what I do as spirit is wait a bit and observe what the survivor is doing at a loop and then phase accordingly. Of course standing still does the trick occasionally, but don‚Äôt rely on it too much.
---
I never knew I needed this until now ü§ßü§ßü§ß
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Jane is the hot survivor
---
If you say so
---
They call me Barney Fife!
---
[Player Level](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level)
---
I can clearly understand it, you just can‚Äôt see anything behind your ignorance.  All I can say to you is get good at conversations not everything has to be the way you want it to be.
---
Why mute them? That defeats the whole purpose of kyf
---
Look man I can‚Äôt save you if the killer camps you that hard. Believe me I try but when I walk up to a hook and see the hillbilly staring Into your eyes I really don‚Äôt know what to do.
---
As a Hag and Feng main, i couldn't agree more lol
---
I've gotten a bunch for doctor, but I own him now so theres no point to use them.
---
Yeah that pretty much sums it up
---
it breaks the second someone even vaguely turns their camera at you when you're using it. I've watched like 20 people play him and see 1 successful stalk.....its broken af right now. Since survivors usually spin camera on gens its effectively a useless perk right now.
---
It‚Äôs just another cosmetic they released him with
---
PC
---
Was running adrenaline the other day when I got unhooked with BT and smacked. My BT timer was still present as I'm being pursued as final gen is completed. Adrenaline did not heal me one health state and I got smacked again and went down trying to save another survivor.
---
It seemed like BT being active negated Adrenaline from working properly.
---
And btw that perk wouldn‚Äôt have to activate like that on the ‚Äúother players‚Äù that play the game the right way because they wouldn‚Äôt be camping so try again
---
üêêüí®
---
I missed a large portion of the year 3 stream, what‚Äôs up with this create your own cosmetic contest?
---
It lets you try out killers that can only be purchased with auric cells I believe or just licensed killers. On PC there used to be splinters for hag and doctor but I heard they were removed
---
Not every loop is a safe loop however if a survivor has a huge speed boost available on demand then that allows them to get to where they know a safe loops is. Also, i would not call a complete de-toothing of a killers primary ability merely a "decent" counter, especial when even when hit a survivor can make it to a loop anyway and self care on the chase breaking. Speaking of instadown killers only a few come to mind and that is plague and Myers, plague honestly needs an increase in reason for survivor in cleanse against her as organised high rank survivors often don't cleanse to completely mitigate her chase ability, this change will be welcome and Myers, although strong in tier three has little chase potential, his stealth can be countered via not doing gens close to walls or by running lithe and running about 5 meters to a window or pallet, also premonition and spine chill. Ghostface announces his presence rather clearly after getting exposed and often times is a fair bit away from the survivor before acquiring it as to not get spotted.
---
Absolutely stunning
---
Hell. Yes.
---
I got shamed for leaving a hooked and downed person (downed right at the hook, not bothering to crawl away) with a face camping Leatherface. Was told I was a scared hiding coward who doesn't play for the team. Guess I shoulda rewarded the camp after my team mate already gave him an extra kill.
---
Do you have all of the licensed killers?
---
What if the person running towards them has BT?
---
You obviously haven't played the game enough.
---
As long as you‚Äôre not toxic and tunnel the guy right off the hook
---
Well, yeah. I think I have one of every splinter on Hag just for fun.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That would definitely explain it, lol.
---
I‚Äôve obviously played more then you could imagine, I‚Äôve gone hundreds of games without ever having it activate
---
Oh my god yes!! But he's licensed so no cosmetics :(
---
How do I get one?
---
Lucky there isn‚Äôt a locker in the exit gate....  
---
AAAAYYYYYYYYEEEEE!
---
Right? Guys? Come back!
---
Bro, are you really arguing with me about something that's already in-game? I'm telling you that event rarely cosmetics cost the same as very rate ones.
---
their names are at the top of their pictures.....
---
Spine Chill is good for people who don't know how to play and for those who are new.
---
Because they earn more points and the game isn't laggy.
---
BT is fine as it is, a good survivor can easily unhook their friend from the hook without getting hooked. You're going for a risky hook isn't really worth it unless you have something like deliverance so when they get far away you can unhook yourself. MoM's nerf won't make much of a difference since you COULD still take an extra hit and be fine
---
It happened to me three times since I responded to your post. The last one was two of us left on the verge of escaping.
---
Right... whoops
---
Is that on the PTB? I definitely had a game last where they made no noise when I hit them.
---
They were but a footnote in my elementary school days.
---
But that gives the guy being chased a whole extra hit and a save for free, you don't see a problem with that?
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, deep wounds is also a health state, so it should‚Äôve removed deep wounds but not brought you to full
---
[I really like using this one here](http://dbdbuilder.net/)
---
Nice
---
The last one is really good I would def use it lol.
---
ToTH only grants ingame points, meaning once you hit that 8k ceiling it's done.
---
BBQ gives you the points post trial, meaning whatever you get is multiplied after the game
---
On an Instagram live today, he got asked about cosmetics for Michael and Laurie. His response was along the lines of "hold on guys we'll be getting to that" so it sounds like they're still trying to negotiate a new license or something
---
Can't unsee it now
---
Because a rework can end up being a completely different outcome compared to a previous build.
---
I used to play mercy in overwatch and her nerfs and ult reworks basically drove any competent use of her below the ground so i KNOW what i meant when i said buff and not (just) rework.
---
You might want to rethink that now. Sorry.
---
already have
---
No, I know you can distinguish the difference between them, that's not what I'm questioning. 
---
I'm saying that, because the rework for him is coming out in a month or two tops, there's no point in developing a buff for him in the meantime.
---
We got our winner here for sure, i hope for a guy ver they do something jojo related...... ._.
---
What kind of tablet do you have? This is AMAZING btw, it's literally one of the cutest fan creations I've ever seen for a game.
---
I don't understand how, how did they actually ended up making a mark last 15 SECONDS. HOW. Successfully marking a survivor should keep them exposed for 90 seconds at least (similar to the duration of Make your Choice). Stalking survivors from up close will most likely be impossible, so you'll have to keep some distance to actually be able to fully stalk someone (let's not talk about the generators in the middle of the corn in coldwind maps). If you fully stalked someone from the distance, how are you supposed to catch them in 15 seconds? I say bullshit.
---
They don‚Äôt get vision of hatch. Also you could power the exit gates too to rush the activation of end game and closing hatch should start it too idk.... wish I knew how to possibly clarify and help better (at least I could help with the trap: survivors have to find it, they are not told location)

Haha if we got Robert Englund Freddy he'd be broken to all shit. I think the rework looks promising, just got to hope they don't fuck it like they did with GF. Also the add-ons will definitely need reworking too so we'll have to see what benefits they give us.

This is really your fault for attempting to use Claudette‚Äôs invisibility power and failing

I always get the highest tier perk as soon as i can to start the entity blockers then I try to finish it ASAP

Is this not bannable?
---
Fairly simple. He (probably) hasn‚Äôt played the game for a very long time and he‚Äôs rank 20. 
---
It matches, or tries to, based on ranked.
---
It's absolutely bannable, for unsportsmanship gameplay. Luckily I got it all on tape. I've reported him in Dead by Daylight, as well as his Steam profile, with video proof. Hopefully he gets punished.
---
Yeah that man fucking destroyed us, a tad unfortunate
---
It‚Äôs a matter of risking it. I know I was playing survivor once and knew the killer was looking for hatch, so I stood on the exit gate and prayed that they went to the wrong one. It‚Äôs luck really. Just gotta outplay them
---
Glorious Tekkers
---
Ya know, there is a reporting system
---
Not surprised. He‚Äôs got some of the best add ons, with the best perk build, and an ebony. 
---
Quite a fuckhead if you ask me.
---
And I used it, obviously.
---
I'd be in problems if this win, I could not force myself to hit such a cutie.
---
Definitely, he mori'd all of us real fast. I was suspicious after we got hit with a Hex ruin and it wasn't a Hag
---
If you read my 2nd point, you'd knownmy stance but that's my bad for assuming your small brain could even read that many words let alone process their meaning.
---
P3 Bubba looks wild
---
Smurf account, actually Rank 1, lol. 
---
OR they haven't played for a few seasons. It is possible to be reset all the way back to 20.
---
Xbox
---
Keep getting disconnected from every game I play and getting the "No Network Connection" error message, despite nothing being wrong with my internet. I end up having to dashboard out and restart the game (Where I can see that I'm still connected to Xbox Live so it's not an issue with that either) only to get disconnected again once in a game. This has been going on for over an hour now (I started playing at 8pm EST).

This is amazing!

Must've been a long ass time then
---
He would Fap to it.
---
Lmao. You can‚Äôt be this hurt as to lie on a forum about something being bannable. 
---
His action wasn‚Äôt bannable. Just because something is unsportsmanlike doesn‚Äôt make it bannable.
---
Give me bunny or give me this!!!
---
That outfit is unironically more loyal to the original movie than the assassin creed thing we got from bhvr
---
Me too but sometimes my friend rainbow six siege shows up
---
Id say buy her, but with shard, not worth spending money on a character you can get for free
---
It is worth noting, there are some rare occasions where it's actually better to stay in the dream world. For example, if Freddy has insta-sleep, and you're injured in an unsafe area of the map on a gen, you're going to want to be able to see him coming so you at least have a chance to loop him, rather than him putting you to sleep before you can make it somewhere safer.
---
worst jake shirt
---
Should've clarified that instead of asking a question I'd already answered. And, FYI, all opinions that paint survivors as bad guys are usually flooded with hate so don't blame me for assuming your open-ended question was coming from a place of jackassery.
---
Oh I did. And nothing about unsportsmanlike shows up. How about you come up with actual reason hmm? Cause claiming hostage isnt gonna help you in this regard either.
---
You showed me the end game report screen and think that makes everything bannable hahahaha. 
---
If old face camping wasn‚Äôt bannable, this isn‚Äôt bannable. This player will continue to play the game and your report did nothing. Congratulations.
---
"Shouldn't" and "won't" are two very different things. Sometimes the weirdest of bugs are the hardest to fix.

Thanks for summing it up. Now I don't have to watch a four minute video. 
---
In all seriousness, I getcha. Just report this person for trolling. 
---
I had it happen to me once but with other survivors--a Jeff and a Nea used a Crystal Bead as a lure and bodyblocked me in the upstairs room on Haddonfield (the one with the 1-person Gen) and the crows started flying so the Nurse found us. Of *course* I died, even if the others didn't make it either. Wasn't the killer's fault, but damn was it frustrating. 
---
I'm afraid though that submitting a report is all you can do in this situation. Sucks, but it's true.
---
I was cool with this tell the comments
---
OH GOD NO.  PLEASE GOD NO.  
---
I'm kidding, please make this happen xD
---
Sorry dude. The Entity‚Äôs a bitch.
---
All hail Nea, glorious Queen of all Bloodpoints!
---
He‚Äôs a troll bro. That‚Äôs the only conclusion I can gather. 
---
Nobody can be this arrogant and stupid.
---
Let's see... here are the counts based on what I've read: Harassment/Comm Abuse, Trolling, and Bad Sportsmanship.

I wish I could say I was surprised.

You camped due to certain perks? Uh

uhh...looks like you did pretty well im confused

Thank you üòä

You **die...**
---
If you play hillbilly he has his chainsaw sprint so you could run back and forth a bit. It‚Äôs not the best option but you can catch them like that. Trapper and hag both ca. Set traps down around the doors so that can help. 
---
Most times it‚Äôs just a matter of running back and forth and hoping you spot that last survivor.
---
Why would this be reasonable?
---
My heart dashes in twain when survivors DC

But Feng isn't allowed a simple, modest cosmetic set! All of her cosmetics have to be flashy neon garbage that makes any stealth player repulsed and vomit instantly!

Jokes aside this does look very nice. It's very quaint and fits Feng well while also changing her style somewhat, which I think is what cosmetics should strive to do. I honestly really dislike the bright neon flashy "anime city girl" asthetic a lot of Feng's other cosmetics take and her more modest cosmetics like the pull-over, her sweater, and (to an extent) her CNY dress are some of my favorites. This fits a similar theme of being very modest and realistic which I approve of.
---
A good contender. There are so many good fan concepts coming out I wish that Behavior would accept more than one. &lt;3
---
Congrats
---
Your the first person to suggest this
---
No one else thought about this
---
Oh and yea devs gonna make a new map in less then 1 week just because of your suggestion
---
Good job
---
please for the love of the entity win the competition, this is so damn good
---
Oh shit happy cake day my laddie.
---
Fhtagn!
---
camped the healer. classic
---
I presume your on PS4? there is no punishment on console so people who DC knowing nothing will happen. 
---
It happens all the time for me so I changed and play more survivor now instead.
---
Which one is it?
---
Could totally see her melting down into sea water instead of mud when she teleports. Real great job that fits her original asthetic but imagines her in a new light!
---
that was actually hilarious
---
also once the huntress let you go you should have looked for the hatch cause that was the only hope you had
---
the second you went upstairs you took away the only hope you had of survival
---
Awesome! Good job!
---
PS4
---
"HEAD ON" : only works (whats seems to be) 50% of the time.
---
Which one is that? I‚Äôm talking about the top guy
---
I will go for expensive items when they're good but otherwise I just try to take the cheap shit.
---
Top guy
---
It's even worse when they cleanse the Ruin first because then HG will never activate. If they're facing spirit and seeing more than two lit totems they won't even chance it.
---
Me and the boys playing swf but not being toxic because we all suck
---
That‚Äôs better
---
That could be useful. Maybe even Meta!
---
Rank 2 guy and him weren‚Äôt medics, just excessive a-holes with perks n flashlight who got theirs
---
*CLICKY-CLICKY* *Teabag*
---
Dying Light should slow actions while the obsession is in the downed or hooked state. It's not called Dead Light after all.
---
I have the same experience. Then I face a team that knows his counters then I understand.
---
Hey I play a lot of Killer (Prestige Lv 2 as Myers) but I don't know what "splinters" are. Can you explain???
---
Oh I thought about this alot actually so I just had the trench coat as 1 whole piece separate from the pants. Also I think they'd manage to add it in, seeing as how there are outfits in the game with long skirts such as Claudette's roving healer outfit. Also about the clipping if its one whole piece, I think (hopefully) they could find a way to prevent it from clipping by adding physics. Kinda like the time they added some physics to the side of Feng's long hair to prevent it from clipping into her face. I appreciate the concern!
---
Lucky, I need to get a mori for billy and have to play the nurse lol, and remember, give pizza dwight the hatch.
---
If the endgame timer wasn‚Äôt there I‚Äôd be against you but that timer turns it to Everyman for themselves
---
I actually really hope this wins.
---
Who was asked?
---
Thank you! I used a Wacom Intuos Draw.
---
Where‚Äôs the third option were you click randomly like a dumbass and hope it turns out well
---
Hell no, you just a toxic camper
---
Sorry forgot to clarify. It was Matheiu Cote (prob spelled it wrong)
---
Me stood outside the Killer shack waiting to do a loop and getting downed anyway
---
I mean, the results speak volumes, really.
---
You only got a 2k, because you camped. They won.
---
Everything after 2 kills is considered a win for killer and there wouldn't be a point in them playing the game if they didn't have fun or got points.
---
I would pay so much for Ghost Bob Myers
---
I will give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you are not trolling as other people claimed. 
---
Let me just give you a quick heads up. The in-game ban categories and description are very vague, causing way too many players to interpreter it wrongly. 
---
Here are detailed information about what is and what isn't bannable. 
---
[GAME RULES AND REPORT SYSTEM](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest)
---
Back to what happened to you. I believe this would fall under the "*holding the game hostage*" situation because the killer didn't hold the power over how long the game would last, your team did. You were trapped there while he refused to play the game. Did you report him using the in-game system? Otherwise your footage is worthless. 
---
Now, had this happened AFTER the EGC started, it would be a fair play. Scummy, but fair.
---
Are you new to the game or this sub?
---
Wondering why you posted this...
---
Thats okie. And thanks for the fast response!
---
I always saw that rewind fee as an introduction to civic responsibility for the selfish.
---
They are, just for killers you don‚Äôt own
---
Because I think that would stop a lot of camping with dying light. At that point if you camp the obsession on first hook you‚Äôre limiting yourself to a 10% slowdown
---
No voting, the contest will be judged by BHVR. Thanks for your support though! &lt;3
---
The PTB is currently bugged, so it‚Äôs actually low settings.
---
Seriously I dont get what gets in survivors' heads that they think its unfair that not every survivor is going to make it out every time. I have survivors message me all the time talking about how it's bullshit that I killed them because of some unspoken rule of etiquette in a competitive game. I dont ever receive messages from killers unless I teabag them or pull off something seriously dirty and it's almost never with the same sense of "I deserved to kill you" I get survivors sending. I think what it is is that most killers also play survivor but tons of survivors never touch killer
---
That last bit especially. I mean, I'm still seeing a few bugs that have been around since 2.2.0 or even earlier. I acknowledge that they're doing their best but you'd think that given the level of community interaction any sane developer has they'd make a little more effort to fix issues that have been around for 8-9 months now. 
---
Then again, BHVR isn't *most* developers. They're a small company handling an enormous game. I'm still willing to cut a little slack but there comes a time to bring out the chopping block and say, "Hey, this needs fixing ASAP."
---
New player?
---
Well someone's having a bad day
---
No sans undertale eyes 4/10
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why sprint burst needs a nerf the exhaustion nerf was enough and it‚Äôs enough to get them to a loop for a reason seeing how it‚Äôs survivors only defense against a killer last thing it needs is a gimmick that makes it borderline useless in some situations if a killer don‚Äôt have chase potential then they usually have something to assist them in getting the down and not only that there is bloodlust last thing we should ever be talking about is ghost face he‚Äôs weak but nerfing an entire perk just for him would be stupid what they need to do is just buff the killer himself take out the ability to deactivate through walls on the hook or ground and that would make him better just like plague ghost face is going to be a mess and will likely take several buffs before making him better
---
For me it doesn't even work, forever "searching for match". Only happens as killer.
---
Fuck.
---
Returning after not playing for a while, last I played was before legion
---
But *severely*. I'd rather not have Thanatophobia 2.0.

Camping to be spiteful cause you‚Äôre not doing well is never reasonable.
---
Yeah I agree I wouldn‚Äôt want it in game but the idea is dope it‚Äôs like with whoever came up with ghostface SEE YOU thing cool idea but in game yeah....
---
How about this, for everytime the obsession is hooked that survivors actions all of them increase by 25% speed(except movement) 25%/50%, while still slowing everyone else down by 10%20%/30%.
---
Gets countered by slugging, add Unbreakable to it.
---
I JUST had a 3-gen doctor game, like I was the doctor. For a minute there I thought this was my match.
---
&gt;Gives you more bloodpoints.
---
No it doesn't.
---
It makes you reach the 8.000 cap in Deviousness faster but it is pointless to use it on Doctor because he already does that by default.

Prayer Beads are bullshit, but when not using them, she seems pretty fair to me. Or maybe I just haven't gotten to the level where she plays differently.

Can‚Äôt depip past rank 15 so that can‚Äôt be. Enough games like that would rank him up.
---
That's not the worst idea I suppose. Whatever way you slice it, though, Save the Best For Last is the best Obsession perk and deserves to be
---
When you nut but Jane keeps suckin
---
I had to get a mori with spirit and since I hadn't ranked her up yet all I had was rancor. Slugged the obsession with one gen and two survivors sacrificed. Ended up seeing Jane creeping closer to me standing over my slug. Downed her only to carry her straight to the gen and just stand there till she wiggled free. Then walked back to my slug as she finished the gen and escaped. Felt kinda bad but 60,000 BP ain't too bad. Haha
---
They removed it when they added the shard grind for killers
---
You can still use them, but you cant get them
---
I liked this one so much that I had to go back and check out your others. 
---
Bravo.
---
As a Feng and Ace player, I feel attacked lol
---
Especially since i tend to use cursed images as my avatars :p
---
This happened to me earlier. I just shut it down and reset everything and it sorta fixed things. Games are still taking a bit longer to get but they at least connect now.
---
No, you can still get them from Mystery Boxes, I know this because I literally opened a Splinter yesterday
---
No
---
You needed to emphasize your sarcasm lol
---
God this reminds me of the time I got chased for 3 gens and then got downed only to be camped. Doc then started lag switching while I was on hook, my team saved me and as I was about to get out he pulled the plug, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever laughed harder.
---
I absolutely LOVE this.  If this wins I hope they find a way to add some of the variants, 'cause the Blue jacket variant would probably end up becoming my Go-To cosmetic for her!
---
The strategy is to do neither
---
Lol no u
---
You'll get nothing from me.
---
Having similar experiences on ps4.  Getting cannot connect to host when joining a lobby or just simply can‚Äôt get into a lobby as survivor that isn‚Äôt 400-1000+ ping unplayable messes if games.

A smash through walls thing fits Jason better

if you look at hag she insta teleports to one of her traps

This is a non-argument. The PTB is just because they can't fine tune somebody without many many tests. They are still expected to do the bare minumum and test him with a few in house testers.

---
Alright thanks
---
Still too much. You‚Äôre not supposed to down them at all.
---
Just give the ONE FUCKING PERK I WANT GODDAMMIT
---
Yah I would do the same but it‚Äôs the exact same for every level. I was told by my friends who got me hooked on the game that you would get better stuff with prestiging and that was a lie. I think once my whole game is level 50 with survivors and killers, I will then start leveling each one to P3, one at a time. My Nea has everything and allot of shit to go with her. But with the grind and hardly any DBP and when those hit they are short as shit and I always have to work plus the last one was a shit show. I played some killer while I could and survivor was total bs on PS4 either super OP perks and offerings with the killers and braindead survivors or killers constantly DC, I was done playing survivor and wasting offerings like, cake and BPS.
---
yeah but there's always guaranteed one safe if nobody leaves. That's his point. nothing about tantrum or anything, nobody leaves, one escapes.
---
No.
---
Take my upovote. Good show + good meme
---
Could be four lines from the DBD logo with the fifth line a tear across the middle ~~to see David nipple.~~
---
What's the point of those add-ons?
---
I know she‚Äôs probably supposed to look frightening here but she looks so cute lol. Good work! I hope this wins!
---
We could give it to the clown.
---
It is, but I can‚Äôt really change how survivors play, so if they play sweaty, I have too play sweaty, especially at high ranks. My advice is stay low ranks, it‚Äôs so much better.
---
I went against a wraith that burned glasses, and he had the coxcomb clappers and the
---
Yep, mask, body and weapon.
---
Sweet, looks like I won't be dropping any money into cosmetics
---
How did you make the perk icons?

That part I understood, I was referring to the purple version of the perks. Like the green Pack.
---
Ahhh I saw you today! Thank you for letting me get a picture üò≠ your cosplay was great!!
---
Congrats my dude.

But it's not here now
---
It says in the contest rules for submission that the Shape isn't eligible.  As much as I would love to see this skin cos it's one of my favourite moments in Halloween, it wouldn't be allowed.
---
I REALLYYY hope this wins, my baby feng needs better outfits and this one is amazing!!!!
---
Shadowborn: Keep the FOV changes but add a red stain decrease, so it would go something like 1/2/3 feet of the red stain is gone in chases. Make it a nice counterpart too Monitor and Abuse.
---
Plus I think the contract for Ash allowed them to give cosmetics from Evil Dead.
---
Anybody else bothered the only prizes are in game currency?
---
Damn );
---
They would have to have a balanced group of people, ergo and even amount of survivor mains and killer mains.
---
lol
---
gg
---
Happy cake day!!
---
Agreed
---
well, I found some images online that I liked (it was easy for this 'cause they're just animals.) I loaded them up in a software called gimp (its free), scaled them down, and edited them. The tricky part is figuring out how to make the style look like DBD, so I used several reference images of perks already in the game. let me know if you need more info.
---
I guess I am a feng main now
---
He's not a furry though?
---
*THE CAKE IS A LIE!*
---
Yeah :(
---
Lmao campaing, facecamping, tunnelling aren't bannable offences. Lagshwitching is a bannable offence. You have no idea what you're talking about, holding the game hostage is forcing you to DC, this killer killed you, they didn't hold the game hostage.
---
He's making a T pose

Yep

Cant get into my game. I loaded into my game into the main menu and it just says " save error 302 " I tried everything to fix it and it wont work.

The Nurse has a trash bag and hazmat plastic skin.

This. Is. Incredible.

Clown all the way.   Hes not great but his anti looping for pallets really comes in handy for me.  Plus I love his cough.

That‚Äôs great, thanks for telling me. I have always wanted to make one of these and have taken classes in computer art and design before so I wanted to give it a shot. You did a great job, they look really authentic üëç
---
Thanks for your input, what would you say your top 2 favorite add-ons are? And what's your best perk build?
---
Here are some ideas. I'm not sure about the numbers because you would have to test it in game to see if it was balanced, but you get the idea.
---
**Vigil** allows you to recover exhaustion at a reduced rate while running + what it already does.
---
**Diversion** You start the trial with 1 pebble and can now hold up to 2 pebbles.
---
**Technician** Reduces all of the sound made by the generator when working on it. (not only the sound of working on it)
---
**Wake Up!** gates can be opened 30% faster
---
**Calm Spirit** Whenever the killer alerts a crow within 36 meters shows the killers aura for 5 seconds. + what it already does.
---
**Detective's Hunch** Reveals auras of objects for 10 seconds instead of 5. Whenever another survivor interacts with any of the objects that have been revealed by detective's hunch, shows the aura of that survivor.
---
**Hope** Remove the timer.
---
**Open Handed** Whenever another survivor within 15 meters reveals an aura/auras, that aura is shown to you as well. Whenever you reveal an aura/auras, that aura is shown to all other survivors within 15 meters.
---
**Sabotage** Unlocks the sabotage action. Reveals the aura of all hooks within 36 meters. Increases your totem cleansing speed by 20%.
---
**This is not happening** Increases the size of great skillcheck success zones by 30% when healthy and 60% when injured.
---
Fucking weebs
---
Close enough my dude, stop with the cringe
---
It's just ash
---
Found your problem. You didn't let them escape.
---
thank you! you can find all the perk templates and stuff online, but I also have them if you want to skip looking on your own.
---
What is it? 800 hour player here and I can barely remember the realm sub-maps besides stuff like Gas Haven, Ironworks, or Storehouse. 
---
Apparently Torment Creek is "The one with the Zeppelin" as I call it. It's actually a Silo? 
---
Anyways how is it an Infinite? I thought Infinites were removed considering more windows spawn boarded up, bloodlust is now a thing, and there's the window blocker.
---
My perks for Nea are  balanced landing 3, borrowed time 2, Urban evasion 2, and kindred 2. Is that good?
---
Well shit
---
Eh? Neko characters are now cringe?
---
oh
---
Yeah that would be great, do you have a link to them?
---
Its a sucky situation, but if you can't make the save without dying yourself it's best to just go for hatch.
---
That's fucking gay
---
Of course! What was I thinking.
---
Swf is annoying and people don't wanna deal with it. The game isn't balanced for coop
---
ah, I don't remember where I got them, unfortunately. if you message me, though, we could figure out a way to send them to you directly
---
...Yes?
---
It‚Äôs ok then, I‚Äôll probably find them on google images, thanks for the offer though!
---
And grind... uh... different things too
---
I love this &lt;3
---
But its apart of the game. Cant really expect people to have friends and NOT play with them.
---
The difference is that it isn't someone playing with the survivors to benefit them and themselves, it's someone being rewarded for doing absolutely nothing but preventing survivors from playing the game.
---
This is a multiplayer game, all the game-play comes from interaction between players, even in a farming match where we aren't playing the game as normal, we're still playing together. But a bot isn't doing anything for anyone, it's just stealing gameplay from the survivors, and the person using it is benefiting from that without having to do anything.
---
Besides, a killer who forces survivors to play a farm game when they wanted a real one is just about as bad.
---
I never heal anyways. Lol. You really don‚Äôt need to unless your teammate just wants the points. It wastes time, so just crank out gens and let Adrenaline do the work
---
They have to shine it in your face for a certain amount of time to make you drop. You can avoid it by looking up, but while you're picking up a survivor you're locked in place, so if you know someone in your game has a flashlight make sure you face a wall while you're picking someone up so they can't flash you.
---
Omg my skin! Haha I made this concept but didn‚Äôt think to post it here. And yes WE DO NEED THIS!! Please devs give the players what they want!
---
I know right? Especially when the exit gates are open and the hooked survivor is next to it. I‚Äôm amazed at how many people get pissed and think all camping is bad, even when there‚Äôs three people running around a hooked survivor next to an exit gate. I got shit on for saying otherwise on another post. This sub amazes me how some survivors can be so stupid. Makes me sad to be a survivor main.
---
Why do you turn corners sooo widely
---
Flashlights. I‚Äôm expert with them just because of how much I hate them.
---
If you are getting flashed, look up. It won‚Äôt fully blind you. I‚Äôm able to look up and see the survivors head at the bottom of my screen. So while they are sitting there and trying to flash you, punish them for it.
---
If you are getting flashed while picking up a survivor, chances are you are going to drop them. If by some miracle, you don‚Äôt drop them, look up and away quickly.
---
You‚Äôll know you are carrying a survivor by the sounds your person makes picking them up. If the survivor is grunting, then you are carrying them. If you start grunting, it means they got away.
---
Put the 80's shades on it with the basic pants and you'll have a better version of the 80's outfit for Jake.
---
Awesome! Thank you and the team for the artistic work you all put into this game.
---
100% my most wanted cosmetic for this game.
---
If he blocked him there when hatch was open and he refused to go close the hatch, it'd be bannable (you have to DC). There were people doing gens and he said he died to the entity, so the killer can't be banned. If you can die the game isn't being hold hostage
---
I know, it's just a poorly designed part of the game. Sometimes people just don't want to deal with that shit.
---
Yeah this bug occurs when you buy the killer with auric cells instead of buying the complete DLC with real money
---
Even though it was a frustrating match, I still disapprove of dcing to open hatch, it's just an easy cheat.
---
The counter is to either 
---
A.) Dont pick up survivors when you're around other survivors 
---
B.) Face a wall when mew pick up survivors 
---
And you'll know a purrson is on your shoulder because they'll most likely be wiggling, making it harder for mew to control yourself. However, mew need to learn to remember things like that to be a successful as a killer
---
It‚Äôs not bannable or even reportable. Just don‚Äôt sit in a corner during egc
---
Fake, a Nokia could NEVER be broken.
---
Outstanding move
---
The same folks who control Halloween also control Halloween 4 and 5.
---
I can‚Äôt even lie this was kinda funny üòÇüò≠

Thick af
---
Thanks and quick question should I get whispers 2 or deerstalker 3 for the nurse?
---
I had a guy argue with me through chat for him being directly in my sight before I even hooked the survivor I carried. He ended up being the only one to die and had the stupidity to call me a camper for him never even attempting to hide.
---
thanks lol
---
Free trial of a killer to get you to buy them
---
I'm kind of confused as to what you're saying, so I'll answer a few things here.
---
Level 30 is the first teachable 
---
Level 35 is the second 
---
Level 40 is the third 
---
At level 50, the bloodweb constantly refreshes until mew decide to presitege or if you're presitege 3, then it's just forever
---
God I fuggin hate clowns
---
Fuck!
---
Try picking up a survivor while staring at a wall. That works for me. And it's basically impossible for a survivor to flashlight save after the killer picks the other survivor up. Just look away from tbe beam.
---
I thought this was d i o
---
Ok thanks, you gave me the answer and quick question since you seem like you are knowledgeable, should I get deerstalker 3 or whispers 2 for the nurse?
---
I don‚Äôt know why people are so against this. This seems like something people would actually wear irl.
---
Chill with all the other weird stuff in this sub first.
---
It's passionate fans like you that make us love going to work every day :)
---
if this wins, my only fear is that BHVR won't do justice to your design. Well done, and I'm a big fan of the flair text!
---
When they start banning hook blocking we can talk.
---
If he's the Malkavian, who're the rest?
---
Deerstalker if you are going for a slugging build or have trouble finding the people you downed. (knocking everyone down before you hook them = slugging build) 
---
Whispers if you are having trouble finding survivors. It‚Äôll let you know if they are near.
---
Toby best Spoderman
---
Begone, furry.
---
He's so loud you literally *can't* not look at him. I was playing KYF to test out Ghostface and literally whenever the Killer would get close to me I would instinctually turn around because of the loud-ass wooshing sound around him. Who the fuck thought it would be smart for a Stealth Killer to have permanent Spirit sounds around him?
---
Should I slug?
---
I learnt something new today and the fact that I didn't realize it until now is very sad.
---
Thanks
---
please, your honor, I swear I'm innocent! I JUST LIKE ANIMALS ITS NOT LIKE THAT

Yes
---
Nurse is the best at it if that‚Äôs what you want to do. I never tried it though.

I've seen this on PC as well; no option to heal a survivor.
---
What other weird stuff?
---
I'm a simple man
---
I'll be Dwight in this interaction
---
Lemme just go AFK before I exit the trial real quick...
---
Seriously though I need to download this video to make meme edits. Put four Brand New Parts on top of the Wraith's face, write "me trying to have a fun game" on top of David, and then put the Ruin icon on top of Dwight.
---
Omg. This is amazing. Thank you for sharing.
---
Excellent work, detective.
---
On a serious note of course I agree these violate rule 8.
---
Trapper, Wraith, Spirit, Myers, Legion, and Pig. 
---
What can I say, I like variety but I only use legion for farming BP because he damn good at it.
---
Its not, but this scene is hilarious none the less
---
All solid, simple perks
---
Yes people want to play with their friends. Does the killer also want to play at a disadvantage? If the killer has had terrible experiences with swf just destroying them before, do you expect the killer to want to play a game like that again?
---
Well good thing no one cares about your approval

I'm a solo survivor and get dodged ALL the time. My record was 12 times in a row. I wouldn't consider it to be a big deal IF matchmaking worked and was fast. Unfortunately, on PS4 matchmaking is complete and utter shit for survivor so it's frustrating to get lobby dodged after waiting an eternity for a match.
---
Never stop....
---
I would spend... *so much money* for this
---
If you post content like this, blur the names out.
---
Wasn‚Äôt thinking bout that, my bad.
---
You must not check out the sub often.
---
'The Ghost Face' just doesn't read right at all
---
Add ons are usually necessary for most killers at high rank. 
---
You seem to be doing fine if you‚Äôre rank 2. Just play to black pip and you‚Äôll be rank 1 eventually.
---
Did you make sure to post it on the forms?
---
You're welcome :) &lt;3
---
But who is it of the four?
---
Behavior came on the forms earlier specifically addressing a lot of the issues (that the PTB found)
---
If they're running at you after an unhook, they're often trying to bait you.
---
If it's a Laurie then definitely, besides that idk
---
You could call it the Dr. Acula skin.

Ugh you got downed even when using an infinite? He won /s
---
Glad you like it! &lt;3
---
What the fuck why is dwight not eligible
---
Ok
---
If you DC because you're losing and you don't like that quit bitching and let yourself die on hook so you get points and the killer gets theirs. And if you can't handle losing in a game to the point where you have to leave then seek other forms of entertainment.
---
Don't worry it's posted in the official forums!

If I could to get this skin, I would lol

I don‚Äôt wanna be the bitch here but that‚Äôs Frank and Julie‚Äôs mask
---
You may be watching prenerf videos, in which case you could tell because they were usually the obsession.
---
I cant even get into the menu. It says save error and right as I load in and it kicks me back out
---
They can't be 100% right! DS doesn't activate when you pick up a survivor for the first time!
---
"Looked too powerful" is not the common reason to dodge a lobby these days.  "Looked to much like the username of the guy that dcs every single match I play against him".
---
If you're not using any perks that make them the obsession, but they're the obsession, then they probably have DS.
---
Other than that... Them stabbing you in the face usually gives it away.
---
This would be dope. I've always wanted a sea-based cosmetic for a killer.
---
Doesn't take a detective.
---
I am seeing this kind of posts so often it made me wonder if they were being done by the same person. I thought "it can't be".
---
As it turned out, it was.

He already posted a 32k screenshot which makes this one even more useless.

First they closed down tumblr so there‚Äôs that... All the normal people just play the game and occasionally visit this sub and grimace as they sort through the weirdo stuff posted here looking for decent gameplay content. Source: me.

both of them are scary as fuck !!!
---
They are not, this is just the old matchmaking algorithm that was reverted.
---
Wish this were true when I was playing survivor lol
---
Very rarely does it happen on PC.

Judging by the rank difference, it's probably one of these + quitting to join your friend(s) who quit

Old face camping got changed, due to the Devs not wanting it to be a part of the game. Soooooo...
---
The 80s shades from wicked wares, but what pants was that default cargo?
---
is that D A V I D
---
Trapper because it makes me laugh, huntress so I can pretend I‚Äôm good, and doctor so I can remember I‚Äôm bad
---
I'm so tired of getting these.
---
Like I own him and everything but they keep showing up every single bloodweb.
---
Uhh. Are you positive about this? 
---
I have never had someone be the obsession who didn‚Äôt have an obsession perk.
---
It use too but I haven‚Äôt run into any in a long time. The most you‚Äôll get is lag switchers, but you just report them and BHVR is good about banning them.
---
I though she already had an outfit like that, isn‚Äôt it the one with the red stripe on the pants?
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it wasn‚Äôt bannable.
---
It‚Äôs a knowledgeable guess. Either they are the obsession or playing in a way that would support they have DS.
---
Can confirm. It seemed like it was a DS only thing where if one guy is running DS and NOBODY else is running an obsession perk (Including the killer) it'd usually make a "Fake" obsession. Seems unique to DS as MoM users are almost always the obsession even if someone else also has DS.
---
Note 2 days ago I was the Obsession for a Spirit with Remember Me. I wasn't running any obsession perks but someone else had DS so my theory of "DS always fakes the obsession unless killer is also running an obsession perk" is out the window. 
---
Frankly I think it's a fucking stupid mechanic. If the killer has Dying Light it's very possible an "innocent" (Not running any obsession perks) player gets punished with being tunneled or Mori'd off the hook while the DS user both gets away with zero risk, but can also deactivate Dying Light by transferring obsession to them. Likewise Bob can be running no obsession perks and gets Rancor'd for the trouble because the actual DS user never hit it to transfer the "Fake" obsession to them.
---
How not to get looped tutorial
---
1. Don't respect pallets
---
2. Don't swing through pallets 
---
3. Don't double back
---
4. When the survivor throws a pallet down, break it
---
Yes, default cargo, the ones you can get bloody, trust me they look great with that shirt and the wicked wares shades, it's my favorite cosmetic I've mashed together.
---
Meg with the Bob, letterman jacket and long running pants looks good too.
---
You de-pip twice when you DC.
---
It's ridiculous. I just want to play the game.
---
Borrowed Time will always be a good one, it‚Äôs a perk even the best players use. Definite keeper!  Balanced Landing is fine too. Urban evasion since you are new, I would say is decent. Eventually though once you get better at running from the killer, you‚Äôll want to drop that as it‚Äôs a waste the better you get.  For now though, you can go the stealth route. Kindred is kinda iffy, it‚Äôs ok if you are playing solo. If you are playing survive with friends and talking though, it‚Äôs a complete waste of a slot.
---
I never play toxic swf ^cus ^I ^have ^no ^friends
---
I mean with that fupa and that cough it's our lord and savior Ethan Klein H3H3
---
I think I got mixed up in the comment chain, thinking someone said Dwight was ineligible &lt;_&gt;
---
What perks do you run as killer?
---
So what should I replace with it?
---
I've had it happen too MANY times as Killer and Survivor, even in one case where I wasn't running an obsession perk, Killer had Remember me, and another survivor had DS. 
---
Try running DS and check who the obsession is (usually it won't be you) and check their perk loadout at the end of the match.
---
Isn't f12 the default screenshot button for steam games?

Imagine your team actually doing gens while you get chased the whole time, apparently couldn‚Äôt be any of my teams üòÇüòÇ

The feeling's mutual
---
Oh shit, thats my birthday!
---
Prosciutto
---
Us the Community create our own original cosmetics for whatever character (excluding the Licensed ones) and we submit the artwork to the official forums where BHVR will implement 2 of the outfits in the actual game based on which ever ones get the most votes
---
Killer is the best way to do it, but if you prefer survivor use David and his perk We're gonna live forever.
---
I'd rather they give it a purpose to begin with. Bloody skins just aren't worth it, imo. Especially on killers.
---
Damn this hurts my sould so bad
---
Depends on what the other survivor was doing. If he was legitimately doing gens and you‚Äôre just sitting on the hatch, that makes you a terrible teammate. I get it, it‚Äôs a crappy situation with the DCs and all, but at the end of the day as a survivor, you‚Äôre part of a team.
---
Does body blocking the hook count as toxic?
---
Yes, it is.  Especially when the killer was very obviously letting everyone go after the DC.  Self care encourages bad behavior for survivors.
---
Just keep playing and use more bloodpoint offerings when you're confident you'll do decent in a game.
---
Do you mind sending me the format? Love the rad me'me

sooo whats special? just a normal face camper. Really nothing we dont see countless times a day

I‚Äôm actually a killer main, and if you think NOED is the bests killer perk you‚Äôre the stupid one my friend
---
How can you want the game to be enjoyable for all when Nea‚Äôs face ruins it for everyone D:
---
JK, I appreciate the fuck out of groups like yours.
---
I am a killer and I must admit I slug a lot. Not to just watch you die out but to prevent hatch from opening. While you're down I look for last survivor. Valid tactic I believe, as you can use No mither or unbreakable to get out of it while I'm searching. Of if the survivor swoops in for a pick up. Now slugging to cause endgame or with no real benefit just to watch I believe it pitiful and quite a distaste. Might not be the answer you want but I believe it's a valid tactic
---
Claudette, and I believe Dwight are both free, therefore do not waste your points on their perks, just level them.
---
Laurie cost money, DS is super good, prob worth you getting so you don‚Äôt have to bother paying for Laurie unless you really want her
---
Riiiiiight...

Because Unrelenting, Overcharge, Distressing, and Iron Grasp are better than noed.

Went to download the PTB and the option was not available in steam, only the opt out selection in the drop-down in Steam.
---
Woah Amazing work! =P Wish you can do my Nea... lol Would be pretty cool to have =P
---
I‚Äôm disgusted wtf is there a Jake and not Meg
---
It can be really hard without it on non-mobility killers
---
Idk about illegal but WPD got deleted for that shooting
---
Sorry :(
---
Please tell me when I said that? There are perks way better than NOED and those three perks
---
It‚Äôs not your fault for wanting to play SWF and it‚Äôs not killers fault for lobby dodging. It‚Äôs the developer‚Äôs fault for not balancing the game correctly. 
---
Lobby is the only thing killers have who don‚Äôt want to play at a considerable disadvantage. 
---
Don‚Äôt hate the player. Hate the game.
---
I'm glad you stuck around :). There are some really cool things that are already done/in the works that we can't wait for the community to see!
---
Can relate
---
If you're going to make it so Bubba can't hold a charge, then at least give him normal movement speed with while he charges, and make him go a little faster.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt use NOED it‚Äôs for bafoons who need a safety net, seriously it‚Äôs like getting a strike with bumpers
---
People should use whatever they want and feels like is going to help them somehow. For new players NOED is usually a good option because very rarely they won't lose all 5 gens.
---
As you learn how to play and get more chase perks, losing 5 gens won't be so frequent so the use of NOED becomes less necessary. 
---
If OP had all perks available I would suggest him something completely different but this is not the case. No point in suggesting weaker perks that won't do him any good just because some people dislike facing NOED.
---
Awesome! I can't wait to see what's coming to the future
---
Do you have any details or a link detailing what the differences would be? This isn't the first time they've done this.
---
He should just use sloppy butcher, nurses calling, and bitter murmur those perks are way better than NOED
---
Well, it‚Äôs kinda hard to answer. There  are common perks available to any survivor in the bloodwebs, and there are teachable perks. Do you know what teachable perks are? Each survivor has 3 teachable perks that are unique to ONLY them, but once you level that character up enough, they can become available to any other character you play in their bloodwebs . For Nea, her teachables are Balanced Landing, Urban Evasion, and Streetwise. So for example, if you switched to playing Meg, no matter how many bloodwebs you spend points on, you will never see Balanced Landing available for her until you spend enough on Nea to unlock it so it‚Äôs available to other survivors. So what I‚Äôm getting at is each survivor has some good teachable perks that you will want to get unlocked for any character you play. A lot of people use Self Care which is a Claudette teachable (unique to her) perk. So there‚Äôs kind of a strategy where you spend bloodpoints on characters you don‚Äôt even want to play, just to get that particular perk unlocked for all other characters that you do want to play.I know I‚Äôm probably not doing a good job explaining this lol, it‚Äôs kinda hard. For now, I‚Äôd say maybe Unbreakable if you have that, over Kindred. If you are on PS4 which I‚Äôm guessing, it‚Äôs a common perk. I would suggest Decisive Strike, but that requires you to buy Laurie and level her up so it becomes unlocked for Neas bloodwebs (Laurie teachable ) Adrenaline is a VERY popular perk, but that is a Meg teachable. She‚Äôs free though. So you would need to level up Meg a lot  first in order for Nea to have it. So if you‚Äôre following me, it‚Äôs kinda hard to give a straightforward answer on what perks to use, because the recommendations are mostly going to be a mix of teachable perks of other characters. So I think what you have right now for your build is ok, but you should dump  bloodpoints into like Meg to get Adrenaline unlocked possibly, as opposed to spending all your bloodpoints on Nea without having any teachables of others available to her. Kind of a waste. Sorry for confusing you probably lol.
---
&gt;Nah swap NOED for whispers and actually make an effort to find and kill survivors instead of being horrible at the game and getting free zap and kills at the end.
---
Whispers on Doctor isn't necessary because he can find survivors passively. Whispers on him is a waste of a perk slot.
---
Same goes for Deerstalker, Bitter Murmur and such.
---
Ghostface: literally kills a large amount of people without getting caught. In-game Ghost face:Can't kill a Guy that works as a pizza delivery man
---
Live Fast, Eat Ass
---
I agree wholeheartedly. I could just taste survival lol, it‚Äôs all good though. I know when I first started a year ago it‚Äôs all I used on my killers now I don‚Äôt bother with it unless it‚Äôs in an early bloodweb.
---
Oof, I feel bad, yoy deserve some karma friend.
---
Thanks a lot for this and I just bought Decisive strike off the shrine of secrets and I have a question if you don't mind, should I just waste all my blood points on Claudette since I want her self care on my Nea?
---
Or you can spend 60s at the start of the match and find all the totems. Literally the easiest thing ever to avoid NOED, regardless of whether you're a solo survivor or in a SWF.
---
Shhh don't tell The Entity
---
I am remarkably confused as to the relevance of this comment
---
Yes you may. Do you have a pamphlet I can take
---
&gt;He should just use sloppy butcher, nurses calling, and bitter murmur those perks are way better than NOED
---
I agree that Bitter Murmur is a good perk but not so much for a new player and not so much on Doctor, that can find survivors no matter what. 
---
By the time he gets to the area where the aura was revealed, he would have to search for that survivor anyway since tracking is very hard at the early stages of DBD and you can do that just as easy with the bubble given by a generator completed.
---
If I want to rek survivors Hillbilly, if I judt want to play casually, my Fedora Boi always be there for me (Freddy)
---
Great time to discover that killer has NOED!
---
[Here you go!](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/66338/patch-notes-3-0-0-ptb)
---
&gt;Anyone else have opinions or suggestions about slugging?
---
If you notice the killer slugged someone, go work on a generator while that person recovers.
---
In my solo queues whenever I see someone downed but not picked up by the killer, I continue to do whatever I am doing while paying attention to that person's aura. As soon as he starts moving (this should mean he is at 95% recovery bar), I run and pick him up.
---
The mistakes I see survivors doing all the time is trying to prevent that person from staying any second downed, which isn't always the best play. They pile up over the slugged person trying to get her back up while the killer just easily comes back, downs her again and now he has two more targets to down. 
---
Also, trying to heal someone slugged instead of allowing that person to recover on her own, will reveal YOUR aura to the killer in case he has Nurse's Calling. If that person had recovered to 95%, tapping her back up is too fast for the killer to react in time. 
---
Only hooking removes people from the game. Someone slugged isn't anywhere closer to being removed so just take your time before making a move. 
---
It is a boring strategy no matter what but usually survivors are too desperate when they should've been more cautious.
---
PLEASE PUT THIS IN THE GAME BHVR
---
She's a corpse. Do you think her bones aren't going to stick out and her stomach isn't going to be wasted??
---
Not any more you don‚Äôt
---
The skirt is too much.
---
heh, sorry, I don't know what a distro is, or I would tell you!
---
I'm sorry :(
---
We dont like to play against the same perks every game but we dont have a choice. Every game its ruin, BBQ, nurses, etc
---
Woah.....
---
I do agree lobby dodging is a massive problem but if I see 4 people join at the same time that's a fat pass. But if I see 2 people join then another 2 join I assume it's 2 different SWFs which isn't a big deal at all. I feel the only reason you should dodge is 1 full swf because that's kinda unejoyable for the killer or 3 toolboxes but besides that don't lobby dodge as queues are long as fuck.
---
The objective isn't to escape or get kills, it's to get as many points as you can. As long as you're pipping, you're winning
---
Sure it sucks getting killed at the end because of NOED, but as long as you were having successful chases, doing gens, and healing your teammates, you did well
---
Same goes for killer. A killer could do fuck all until the end, get a 4k and still de-pip
---
All end game is is really just a bonus objective, the main thing that matters is how you played up until then. So if you did great up until the end, still got your points and pipped, why are you mad?
---
I'll also add that while it may be difficult, especially on like Swamp and The Game, cleansing totems is a direct counter to NOED. It's hard, not impossible. But what a lot of survivors don't seem to understand is that gens are not the only objective. Assume every killer you play against has NOED. If you see a dull totem and think it's a pointless waste of time to cleanse it and then get fucked by NOED later, that's on you for making poor decisions
---
I would like these three to ‚Äútier‚Äù off each other 
---
Tier 1 of the three perks if you use one 
---
Tier 2 if you use two perks 
---
And tier 3 if you use all three. 
---
I think this could also be implemented in a patch to look at synergy of certain skills. 
---
I think it would open up more play styles ... I dunno
---
Feng mein reporting in
---
..? You said you used gimp, thats an open-source software available on linux free of charge. I know because I was using mint, I wonder if they made a windows or mac OS port?
---
EEEH? EASY MODE? HOW LAME!
---
ONLY KIDS PLAY IN EASY MODE!! KYA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!
---
But pig and tapp are getting new outfits
---
I just vs a face camping huntress
---
I was joking but can someone do it cause I don't know how to?
---
ah, gotcha. I use windows, they have a version of gimp ported to it. I'll admit I am just an amateur and don't know a whole lot about editing software -- just that I'm too poor for photoshop.
---
What you are saying to me is I can perform just as well with wraith as nurse, but I just need to get better...?
---
Cenobites?
---
Myers burqua?
---
I am saying that (almost) every killer is viable. I made it to rank 4 with trapper and wraith. They are both **level 1**. 
---
I play the majority of my games now a days without add ons because I‚Äôm saving up bloodpoints to get the perks.
---
In fact that‚Äôs how my legion looks, Susie body, but frank‚Äôs mask
---
The game is balanced around those perks tho. It isn't balanced around swf, that's why they stomp so much and people don't want to deal with it.
---
No, but it would be cool if PS4 + Xbox could got their own exclusive character or cosmetic though.
---
The Until Dawn Killer Outfit for Trapper... Would be amazing to see.
---
Maybe Joel or Ellie would make cool survivors.
---
Idk. I doubt consoles will get an exclusive, but it would be nice.
---
Oh nice! I didn‚Äôt know it was on the Shrine. Self care is I think the most popular survivor perk, but it‚Äôs also kinda frowned upon by some good players as it‚Äôs viewed as a waste of time...I think it takes up to 32-40 seconds to heal but I‚Äôm not totally sure. Personally I think if you play solo...yeah go ahead and do that. Dump the points on Claudette to eventually get it available for your Nea. Empathy and botany knowledge are her other two and they‚Äôre decent as well, so you‚Äôll probably end up unlocking those too in your pursuit of self care. The thing with self care is if you play in voice chat with friends a lot, you can tell your friends where you are to come heal you ...like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm in the shack come heal me!!‚Äù , that‚Äôs where I think self care would be pretty pointless to use. But playing solo like I do, man sometimes random teammates can be useless so it‚Äôs hard to not bring it. 
---
To give an example of what I like.... I typically use Adrenaline (Meg), Borrowed Time (common PS4 or Bill perk on PC), Decisive Strike (Laurie or shrine like you got it from), and either Lithe (Feng perk), Balanced Landing (Nea perk), or Dead hard (David perk). Majority use Dead Hard over those two, I try but I suck with it and it end up switching around.
---
But he‚Äôs not a ghost.
---
Holy shit thanks
---
All good, I didn't know that it was ported to windows as well. Also I feel that being constantly broke sucks. I can link you to a decent and understandable "free" video/audio editing software if you want.
---
If it was old legion you'd get a ton of hate mail
---
Place traps In the middle of the shack,long loops,etc. Place your traps in not so obvious positions kinda like the trapper and when you hook someone place the trap close but not too close. I'm not really a hag player but since I've watched other Hag mains learned from them(like space Coconut)
---
It‚Äôs a lot different look it up
---
If you put a trap on a survivors head it will active if a generator gets complete. You will know it's active because the trap icon on the survivor is now red instead of white. The trap has a 2 minute timer and the survivor has to check 4 boxes to try to find the key to unlock the trap. The trap will become inactive (it will turn back to white and the timer will not go down) when the survivor is being chases is downed or is on a hook. If the survivor doesn't get his trap off before the 2 minute is over they will instantly die. If you put a trap on a survivors head after all the gens are done it won't be active at all and doesn't do anything. If a survivor has a active trap on their head and then the gens are complete it will still be active even after all the gens are done. If you have an active trap on your head you can not leave out the exit gate or you will die by the trap no matter what the timer is at. If a survivor has a trap on their head they can still escape though the hatch even if the trap is active.

---
Yet I warp to them, then chase commences, etc.
---
I can‚Äôt even catch up to them until bloodlust comes up. Is that usual?
---
what video?
---
Yeah I mainly play M1 killers that aren't that good like Freddy,Leatherface,Trapper and Clown but he is actually good tho and soon to be Ghostface main. I usually bring Franklin's if I have it on my killer but I don't feel like switching to someone that isn't fullied leveled like Trapper. That's mainly why I dodge SWFs with items because I don't have perks to counter them on the majority of killers I play.
---
Not for me as I use the traps for mindgames catching up etc. I recommend watching Space coconut as he is a hag main and I'm not all that good as hag as much as he is. She has a very high skill cap in my opinion as you need to learn when and where to place traps and when to teleport to them.i recommend just playing more with her add ons and some perk builds
---
These are great! The top two would probably be pretty rare since they're more than decent for generic perks, but I'd love having all three. Too bad the devs probably won't bother.
---
No, it was changed for a reason.
---
Yeah, but this can also be seen as a survivor nerf.
---
Legion because I want to play Dead By Daylight, not Mending Simulator 2019.
---
You do realise when possible the game bundles four players together and throws them into the same lobby together, regardless of SWF? It might not always be true, but in peak times it is. Four joining at the same time does not mean SWF.
---
It was a nerf for exhaustion perks, how is that a bad reason?
---
The literal reason they removed it was because it could be powerful if it activated in a chase twice and chases would last too long. You do know that it took longer than 60 seconds to recover in chase due to it being slower because of running? If the killer is on you for 60 seconds they're playing poorly.
---
He was a 14
---
I think this sub is a bandwagon.
---
Wow this is really good! 
---
Thanks for making it.
---
More people need to understand this. That‚Äôs why idc if survivors Tbag at the exit. I‚Äôm gonna pip so in my mind we both won.
---
The reason it was nerfed was because chases were too long and the devs wanted them shorter. It took longer than 60 seconds for exhaustion to fully recover if you were running, if you're getting chased for 60 seconds or youre chasing someone for 60 seconds, you're playing poorly. It wasn't nerfed because exhaustion perks are op, especially because it was meant to target sprint burst more than the others but ended up benefiting sprint burst more than the others
---
I would swap out distressing for monitor and unrelenting for sloppy. Use the calm add-ons. People expect huge terror radius as doctor, shake them up with sneaky doc.
---
Small Game showed auras but it got reworked when they add the totems because, well, you are basically removing Hag and Trapper's power with auras.
---
Sorry I didn't reply earlier I was in a match but thanks for all the help
---
That's not my point. The point is that 15 killers have a one-word name, and now they're releasing a killer with a two-word name. It's inconsistent.
---
Exhaustion perks are all strong, and they still are despite the nerf. It was a fair change.
---
Pre-rework* 
---
Even if you‚Äôre counting his change shortly after release. That‚Äôs nowhere near a ‚Äúrework‚Äù level of changes
---
I dont like any of her current cosmetics, but this one I love.
---
Exhaustion perks are strong yeah, but the nerf was unnecessary and simply made it easier for bad killers to get survivors they decide to dedicate their entire match to chasing.
---
 hair right now üòç
---
‚ÄúBut its apart of the game.‚Äù
---
By your logic the killer dodging is ok as it‚Äôs a part of the game, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be able to dodge.
---
I usually play at way way off hours like 1 to 5 am because my sleep schedule is messed up so I'm fairly confident that it is a swf however if I'm playing on busy hours I usually just don't care as I want blood points(and  a fun match) and the chances of getting a swf is kinda lower in busy hours so I don't leave lobbies.
---
Also Trapper: Cant step 5 inches more to avoid stomping into one of the bear traps the he himself placed manually.
---
&gt;Seriously? Do you honestly think 2 SB a chase was balanced? Do you want 5 vaults and double pallets too?!
---
Here is the issue with the change and why the reason was bad.
---
Because of ONE perk, they also affected THREE perks (now FOUR if you also consider Head On) that weren't as broken as SB. The worst part is, SB is still strong because it guarantees immunity to being hit no matter how bad your map awareness is. Killer got right up to your eyes before you noticed? Just SB to a pallet or window.
---
There is not much point in discussing this as people probably tirelessly explained to them when the nerf happened. All we can do is wait and see if they have something planned now that it's been months since the nerf occurred.
---
Has the Xbox version of this got game chat or do you need to party up??
---
If she had this outfit I would main her. Serving Daya tease.
---
Actually jumpscare myers and skilled ones are actually fucking good
---
current freddy has also permament visison of survivors and can delay gen rush and is a slug king
---
Man deathgarden looks great
---
Why it's the best way?
---
This is exactly what I was going to say. I can't stress enough how important it is having a minefield of traps set up. Set up your traps at the beginning of the game. Place them in places the survivor will walk by, over vaults, and near generators. This is why corrupt intervention is actually not terrible on her. It gives you time to start placing traps and pushes survivors to your side of the map where your minefield is set up
---
It removes the stress of the game, and gives survivors bloodpoints. Its good to just unwind after playing a couple serious games.
---
Yeah I like running perks that aren‚Äôt meta, otherwise the game becomes a little repetitive.  Honestly I think Distortion is really underrated as there are so many perks that can reveal your aura to the killer as well as addons and Distortion counters that.  Also, it removed your scratch marks whilst it is active, and I love scratch mark perks (hence why I Main Kate)
---
Uhm I played him a few times and that's a no from me chief. Even without his power a decent killer should be able to get kills without camping.
---
The point is that nurse shouldn't have her blinks amount altered. Devs should rework those two addons
---
No power Freddy is the best
---
Mid-chase Sprint Burst deserves its place at the bottom of the sea.
---
The best swfs are the ones where you don't realize it's swf
---
no game chat, but that doesn‚Äôt stop anyone lmfao. i‚Äôve played on xbox for over a year now and often get messages from other survivors/killers. i‚Äôve made a bunch of friends but def more hate messages than good ones
---
Oeuf but then the survivors may be confused, as its full invisibility. Might result in bug report?
---
You can give them a lot of points by aiming for 12 hooks game. This "pacifist" game sounds pretty much like farming session. And that's boring.
---
Lmao what?
---
Eh, besides the fact that they can both vault over pallets? Not really. An edgy teenager isn't exactly the most original idea, and their powers are otherwise pretty different (especially that weird hit meter thing). The most coincidental is probably the fact they also both have a perk that relates to hitting other survivors while already carrying one.
---
Otherwise they're quite different in power design, the other perks they have, the aesthetic design, and backstory.
---
Idk u do u, so far the survivors have just thanked me
---
Honestly you make some fire skins and I‚Äôd like to recommend one but I suck at drawing 
---
It is for Legion Susie specifically and sines she is about school and academics I would like her to be a surgeon type she is in surgeons attire with a paper mask over her normal mask and her weapon is a moderately sized pair of scissors with a sharp side for normal play but a jagged crooked uneven other side for frenzy stabs resulting in the survivors insides being shredded
---
Yeah people with ds usually won't be the obsession, especially if no one else has an obsession perk. You'd only be obsession with ds if someone else has an obsession perk too. That's cause using ds makes you the obsession now. It's been like that since the ds nerf, to help conceal the fact you have ds.
---
Giving a redneck with bad teeth a mask made out of skin and an apron.. smh these fuckin‚Äô thiefs
---
She got a 3k and only made 25k, she could've made maybe 40 - 50k with bbq.
---
Honestly, in my opinion it's pretty obvious to tell when a killer has it or not. You can often judge just by their play style, or what killer they are. That's something you should be doing every game. Try to figure out how they play, and try and count their 4 perks. Usually if they don't have meta perks, or have green level perks, NOED is a safe bet. If they play really brain-dead and make a lot of stupid plays, you can assume they have it. If you don't want to cleanse all 5 totems, focus on cleansing totems in the harder to find spots, and leave the totems in the open/by doors. That way, if you or someone gets downed by NOED, the remaining totems are much easier to find. If you can't find it, and the killer is camping, let the guy on hook die and don't feed the killer any more kills.
---
It's not against the rules, so if everyone's happy, good for you
---
I also agree with most of the other comments, go for decisive strike. Decisive strike belongs to a dlc survivor, Laurie Strode, so unless you plan on buying her and leveling her up, I recommend getting one of her perks for free. By the time self-care reappears back on the shrine of secrets, there is a 99% you‚Äôll already have enough iridescent shards saved up to get it. Once again, unless you just want to level Claudette up to level 35+
---
Flight of the rabbit is sus. doesnt seem balanced at all.
---
Yeah, i suppose if anyone complains ill start killing
---
I have 680+ hours in this game. 300+ are in Piggy. I can say with convedence that these 3 buffs is all she needs.
---
WAIT WAIT hold up are you telling me your fucking genius change is to make it so survivors can butt fuck GhostFace by not looking at him you know the easiest thing ever to do
---
Go watch the last Q&amp;A and try to repeat that with a straight face.
---
Then they're just sensitive. I was a killer main for the first two years of this game, there's nothing wrong with it. It's like Ruin or Flashlights. Annoying, but a strategy.
---
Invincible 
---
You are unable to get hit by the killers basic attack
---
"Cant touch this" - unknown
---
True. I don‚Äôt know who to main at this point. I keep switching.
---
I like your personal take on the wig/hair with the purple to pink fade!
---
I approve of this message, you know have permission on behave of all Pig mains.
---
r/raimimemes
---
Go to your steam library, right click on game, click properties, click local files, click verify integrity of game files. Should fix it. If you fucked with perk icons or anything like that in the UI files then that will be reverted to vanilla things btw.
---
The third perk is way too op in my opinion
---
Or just ruin noed and fix those problems directly. You don't play Killer for other people, you play it for yourself. Who cares if they don't like it? Like you said don't grow complacent but use it to your advantage.
---
Thank you!
---
You‚Äôre lowkey lucky to have that. Rank 8 here and all I play against is red ranks :) fml
---
Okay here‚Äôs my build 
---
Well make it 
---
Self Care 
---
Botany Knowledge
---
And 
---
Dead Hard or We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever 
---
And bring a med kit 
---
This build will make it so after unhooking Simone you will heal them in the matter of seconds and the med kit won‚Äôt be affected as much because of self care Dead Hard just gives you survivability and We‚Äôre Gonna live forever means more blood points
---
Hey buddy do you mind shutting the fuck up thanks bro
---
I just bought michael so I had a tough game ngl
---
Dude...
---
PTB MoM was a BUFF.
---
Run it with Borrowed Time; run to hooked Survivor, take a hit (1 stack), unhook the Survivor, take another hit (2 stacks), then gain a third when "safe rescue" pops up. You've now gotten MoM extremely quickly.
---
On top of this; with MoM ready to go, taking an insta-down hit will not only NOT down you, BUT WON'T EVEN INJURE YOU!
---
That meant there was NO counter to MoM. Now, come the 18th, MoM will be where it belongs: in the trash. With that, the same-perks-every-match meta will be no more.
---
Im not on the PTB btw
---
Some of these replies are going to give me an aneurysm from the sheer stupidity.  
---
Hiding as Claudette doesn't justify what the killer did  
---
And they held the player hostage. End game collapse doesn't matter, they started doing so when everyone else was still alive and just sat there when they clearly had the ability to attack them. For 4 minutes.   
---
The fact people are trying to go out of their way to justify playing like this is mind boggling
---
Oof and kinda yea. I think they should rework blink in general to make it so there‚Äôs a max distance and it‚Äôs based on like a resource meter similar to legion but rather than activating it its how much you use up. And if you run out of the meter you can‚Äôt blink. And some add ons could make it recharge faster. And how much it depletes is based on how much you charge up
---
Idk if the idea would work tho. But the concept of multiple blinks beyond two and reducing blinks is just stupid. Idk if the idea is that good of an idea tho
---
I mean idk for sure, but it *can*...
---
sort of.
---
I mean, in theory, they would be able to keep the survivors in the lobby together even if the killer left, and just find a new killer instead of throwing you back to the loadout screen. Not sure if they're actually going to do that though, it's just possible.
---
Deathgarden is what happens if Survivor Mains make a game. Apparently mind games "too hard"
---
3.0.0
---
  
---
2.7.0
---
I had a friendly wraith tonight.  I was able to get one of my rituals done on the first game because of it so I sent them a message of thanks and goodwill.  Gentle killers are so much rarer now than they used to be and I haven't been able to figure out why.  I was starting to think I was the last of our kind.
---
Her laugh reminds me of Willum from Mallrats.  ‚ÄúHahaha you dumb bastard, it‚Äôs a sailboat not a schooner!!‚Äù   Link : https://youtu.be/Jg7JmEA-tbY
---
Good, now just keep doing that. And don't wait until you just stumble across one, actively search for them. Make it your main objective every game if you really don't wanna deal with NOED
---
Swap unrelenting for sloppy butcher and if you ever get it Agitation is aways better then Iron Grasp
---
2 concepts will be chosen. So 2 winners of any side.
---
Thank you so much
---
It was necessary. If it was an unnecessary nerf, people wouldn't be running them.
---
Fact is; Exhaustion perks are the strongest in the game, even today, and they are perfectly fine as they are.
---
Escape a chase and sit on a gen, you'll have your perk back by time your next chase begins.
---
Keep the dream alive!
---
Np :)
---
If it's 5 no one would run it, you rarely get over three saves in a game especially since people tend to be to altruistic
---
That's not bad. I'm sitting at rank 5 and at least every other match I'll get one or two rank 14 or 15s on my team.
---
Hag is the only Killer I own that has zero cosmetics outside Frosty Eyes....I just find all,od them boring or too simple... Like Medusa is very meg outside the red glow...but everything else about it just doesn't scream "buy me", the Lettuce one is memey but not for me amd the rest of her Cosmetics, including the newer one, feel....too simplistic.  Like Spirit,Doctor, Huntress, Nurse, Trapper, Hillbilly and even Wraith have something unique and/or something to make them standout pretty dramatically...
---
So here's hoping they actually make this, or one I purprosed with Fungi growths, protruding bones, ala Deathcap Hag...even the Sea Witch one I saw on here ia kinda cool.
---
From Protection hits, yes. And it will only trigger in an attack would take you from "injured" to "dying".
---
But chainsaw hits, frenzy strikes, corrupt purge and hatchets can all trigger protection hits.
---
oh, very cool. Didn't even notice that lol
---
Just because it didn't hurt them too badly doesnt mean it was necessary, just means they didn't murder the exhaustion mechanic.
---
So op. It should take 10 hits to down a Survivor, and Killers should move 1 m/s.
---
Bhvr hire this man he understands _real_ balance.
---
Watching the series and the movies kinda made the memes x2 better
---
They will eventually cut you down if they don't screw up really badly and you don't have a perk to help you break chase (lithe, balanced landing, etc). The only thing you can really reliably do is learn to make them spend a very long time doing it.
---
If your issue is that you're getting cut down too quickly, try to plan your escapes before the killer comes anywhere near you so you can get to a pallet loop, then chain from one loop to the next. And try not to use the pallet early if you can get another loop out of it first.
---
I've seen so many Killers not even try to kick gens or break a chase to force me off of a 90% gen, just because they have NOED. 
---
Result? 1 kill at best. But it feels really shitty for that one Survivor to die as the result of being hit ONCE all game and the Killer then face camping them.
---
Best of luck to you. Legion main here working towards red üò≠
---
lmaooooo
---
Damn you're so cool
---
You  can't. You just try to waste their time as much as you can, equip Adrenaline &amp; Hope; if you're good at running you can punish them hard.
---
no ;)
---
this isn't that bad
---
 I leveled up my ace 80 times before seeing balance landing. Took longer to get barbecue on billy
---
Psst...
---
When I play Survivor, I don't even run Exhaustion perks. And I do pretty well.
---
Try it some time, it'll make you a better player.
---
Thanks, I normally try to be the sacrificial lamb but it's just tiring getting killed after 4 gens and then hooked once and camped.
---
I agree, this is a great idea. You know what fuck it all kust remlve exhaustion. Just make sprint burst a passive increase to running speed. I see no problems with this
---
Here's a good guide for her:  [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1536445874](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1536445874)
---
There was a thread a few weeks ago where a killer said he insta DC‚Äôs when it‚Äôs Haddonfield and other killers were backing him up saying they do as well. 
---
Psa to players of both sides: the conditions of a match do not to have to be 100% perfect for you, for you to play it. Grow up and play the game you gimps.
---
Yeah, I'm new to the game so I'm trying to use windows of opportunity to teach myself the spots.
---
I thought it was for Wraith, now I feel stupid
---
BeeKeeper clown is fuckin incredible, like holy shit.  
---
The Geisha looks well done, I feel like that's very cliche though.  
---
However the puppet aspect of it would be amazing and makes it unique.  
---
Fantastic all around.
---
I think they are doing a pretty good job
---
Perk Explanations:
---
Bloodbath helps with farming, synergizes with BBQ, etc. The values are low so receiving bloodpoints won't be over-the-top.
---
Unidentified Creature helps with the early game &amp; BT. The reduced TR at the beginning of the game can help with certain objectives while being silent. The hook part can help with survivors that try to unhook right in front of you.
---
Permanent Trauma can help prevent altruistic heals, forcing survivors to heal by themselves. This probably could replace SB or Nurse's Calling.
---
So itemized response:
---
1. One kill, but three escapes is a loss for the killer. Yes that one player feels bad but you cant try to balance atound that one player. It is a team effort. I will gladly get camped/tunneled all game as long as it means my team can make it out.
---
2. The survivor crutches were nerfed because they were all reward with little to no risk. Old decisive literally just gave you a free escape. Old MOM literally let you ignore the killer, just for getting hit, which the killer has to do to win. Old exhaustion perks let you get back your perk mid chase, allowing you to unnaturally extend the chase. 
---
3. NOED has not been changed because it is in a fine place. It is easily countered and frequently doesn't even come into play. On top of not having that perk slot for the entire game, it is well balanced. In the micro, it doesn't feel that way, but in regards to the macro it is in a good place. 
---
4. An itemized response wasn't actually necessary I just realized lmao.
---
Honestly I would be down with this outfit, I'd finally wear something that isnt amerikate
---
I don‚Äôt want to get into red ranks because I will definitely get pooped on
---
i know
---
Just passing by : your description is not tunneling!
---
After that being said let me help you,
---
In a chase the goal is not to outrun the Killer (you cant) but to make him loose as much Time as possible while your ally repair gen. For that you have some usefull perks : balance landing, dead hard to name but a few.
---
You MUST also plane your escape, Always know what you are doing next, is there a pallete here to go or are you gonna run for this Windows, as a survivor you get hit when you are surprised by something (the pallete not being there most of the Time)
---
Jeff with a man bun?? uwu
---
Like 95% does yeah, I don't mind it, easy downs for me.
---
I once saw pants that had adidas logo, however the name was Alqaida
---
I would too. I just love oversized hoodie outfits and exactly. I wear the American flag tank top with her P2 shorts with the Dainty Curls hair.
---
The Trigger Man 
---
Ability: can shoot one player for instant death, does not count as sacrafice 
---
Perks:
---
Reach for the sky: while in the killers terror radius, survivors raise their hands out of fear of being shot. Can not repair/heal/loot while in the terror radius and 3/6/8 seconds after leaving the terror radius 
---
Armed assault: you've grown resistant to battery, pallets stun time is reduced 30%/60%/80% but speed of vaulting through windows is decreased 30%/60%/80%
---
Hex: Ammo supply: you're ammo is hidden under a hex totem, left by the entity. When the totem is broken, the killers second ability is no longer usable
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
---
Bruh, aside from pointing and the perk changes, this is what BHVR already said they were doing in their last Q&amp;A.
---
Didn't fully explain it in the main post, but getting seen first and then have him follow me while teammates are finishing every generator until he can kill me and camp the hook is pretty much tunnel vision.
---
No one:
---
Morltha: 
---
&gt;When I play Survivor, I don't even run Exhaustion perks. And I do pretty well.
---
Vanilla shorts America top and p3 spaghetti hair
---
Hey last time we thought that the killer would be fixed before being fully released we got Legion so yeah I think it‚Äôs fair to say that we need to be as loud as possible to make sure BHVR gets their shit together
---
I will never understand why they make underwhelming perks. Like what, are you afraid we gonna drop DS, adrenaline, DH etc.?
---
Camping is fun, because it is a strategy that promotes winning.  However, I understand it is only fun for the killer, and the players have no real counter to it.  
---
A proposed fix could be something like the fireworks from the holiday events, that is one use and blinds the killer so you can have time to get the survivor out.  Maybe increase the point degradation for killers staying within range of the hook, or increase the range at which you start losing points.  MoM and Borrowed Time aren't good fixes in my opinion, since it prevents the killer for punishing bad saves and dumb plays on the survivor's part.
---
Related: You took me out of context and got the wrong statement out of it.  You may want to buff your reading comprehension levels.
---
It was just a good run-around after a hook, highlighting the need to save a god pallet until the last possible moment, as soon as it was used, the gates opened, I thought it was neat timing.
---
If you're aware of the common loop spots/really strong loops on maps, focus your traps there. Once you have good map knowledge, Hag is one of the strongest in cutting survivor's off. Set as many traps as possible. Sneak up behind LOS blockers, she's a very short killer with a small terror radius which is also useful at T and L walls. Learn when to cut off chases and teleport to different targets, also don't be afraid to eat pallets with her, survivors tend to throw them down fast against her and usually end up burning through all of them on the map. Monitor &amp; Abuse, Enduring/Spirit Fury/Brutal Strength, BBQ &amp; Chili and Nurse's Calling are strong perks on her. Increasing her teleport distance, mint rag and all of her purple add-ons minus deafened ear are her strongest add-ons.
---
this will never happen to me. ever.
---
God help you if the killer is doctor
---
The only thing that honestly bothers me, is when i get 1st hooked, after running them around for a max of 2 minutes. Then they proceed to stare into my soul until timer runs out.
---
If i have a decent team, ill take the loss, and let them pop 1-3 free gens. Just odd to me that people will practically afk for the entire hook timer, just to guarantee 1 kill.
---
WHAT LF is one of the most low tier killers in the game and his power is easy to counter just get this run to a pallet or run around a window he‚Äôs a joke of a killer to anyone with a brain (but yeah his camping potential is fucking crazy)
---
He personally spoke voice lines and was in the traler for his own character. I am pretty sure he knows.
---
Then they are entitled pieces of shits.Bringing a mori is also toxic because survivors dc then.
---
Funny enough if you use them on a character you own, you spawn with the loadout you had on them last.
---
It's not if you realize "This guy is leading me away while his friend is going to go save the other guy."  
---
At that point it's a decision of: Can I get this guy and hook him, or should I defend the hook and potentially down two survivors?
---
Yea let's send positive messages telling the nurse how fun it was playing against their 5 blinks and Mori! Whohoo!
---
I‚Äôll be honest. I actually really like this concept. With some fine tuning, this would be a fun killer. 
---
Two of the perks need heavily tuned though, they sound really good.
---
Np
---
I love it !
---
Just hit the survivor Jesus, rank 15 killers have arrived.
---
Freddy: An immortal dream demon who lives on another plane of existence which he can manipulate at will, making him basically the god of the dream world. Arguable the strongest of all the killers in the lore.
---
Freddy in Dead by Daylight: Has a pounding headache because of his skull's repeated exposure to low-quality pallets and the constant cacophony of generators getting revved up.
---
This thread is so darn wholesome. Gonna play in a big hoodie today - good luck in the fog, gang.
---
No need for me to leave then
---
That was how it was before
---
I'd stay in purple or green forever if I could. Those ranks usually have a good roster of killers, and teammates are competent enough to be useful while the killers aren't super sweaty either.
---
Uhhhh coming from a David main I‚Äôm not really digging it not to be mean or anything
---
Freddy is a noob killer. You need to learn to loop.
---
Nice.
---
Killers can't be toxic, he is just doing his job to kill you! /s
---
Sometimes you just end up being the target, and that sucks. Try to get decisive strike if tunneling is an issue for you. Watch your surroundings and plan routes of escape. You vault windows faster if you run straight at them instead of coming at them at an angle, so use that to your advantage. Dont drop pallets too early, but when you do, dont stick around if you stun him. If you dont stun, check if the pallet is "safe" meaning theres a decently sized loop near it. then watch what the killer does from a few feet away, some killers may break the pallet right away, others wont, which means you might get a few more loops on the downed pallet. As soon as killer breaks the pallet, either flashlight them or just start running to the next good spot, or try to break chase. Remember for a killer it can be hard to tell which scratch marks are fresher, so sometimes doubling back is good, other times its not.
---
Learn these skills and when the best times are to use them.
---
What a goon. Keep on keepin' on, and have fun in the fog.
---
The CUTENESS. Fantastic work. Please do every single character like this!

---
He's done a pretty good job so far, so I am in. Praise.
---
So is he all blacks or England in the jersey tho
---
How insightful. Now we see why you do not want exhaustion perks to be buffed.
---
Looks just like Dwight as well XD
---
Still can't play WWE on switch, I get around 5-15 fps
---
What

Hopefully they have improved it, I'm sure that footage wasn't representative of their current progress
---
__How insightful. Now we see why you do not want exhaustion perks to be buffed.__
---
Hi, Vsauce, Myers here.
---
whaT
---
I still refuse to believe you aren't trolling right now. 
---
"The killer can trigger the endgame, even when there are five generators left on the map."
---
Bad troll is bad.
---
I wish I could mori myself too
---
What about the Crapper?
---
Jane is the most glamorous bitch in the fog
---
You all are doing amazing jobs, these all look incredible
---
Seriously though, when I was a dumb teen and my parents gave me one of those brick Nokias for emergencies, it survived being dropped in the toilet (twice), falling from the third floor window and being driven over by my mom's van, over the course of four years. Not even a scratch. Those things could survive a nuclear explosion and can probably smash someone's skull lmao.

And yet

*when u futt buck her butt but she nut suck your butt to pizza hut*
---
Cant enjoy the game if you get morid on 2nd down. Aka people should get made FTFY
---
I think this is a really big issue that could easily be fixed with the colorblind mode. So many games have it nowadays. Thanks for bringing this up! I think most of us haven't even thought about it, but now that I am aware of it, I am certainly going to bring it up whenever I can.
---
I don't see the problem. It's hard as it is to survive chases while getting tunneld, would teach killers to not tunnel. At the moment killers can mindlessly tunnel like there's no tomorrow with BL. If a survivor lasts long enough to use their exhaustion perk again in the same chase more often than not I'd say they deserve that due to how long the killer has been chasing them.
---
Shouldn't be punished for playing better than the killer.
---
Also people are acting as if this would be a horrible change despite the fact that we already have exhaustion perks that can be used in chases such as Lithe and BL. Many killers also have a bunch of add-ons so survivors can't even use their exhaustion perks smh.
---
I want to be able to use SB in chases again! It's terrible how it is now.
---
At the very least vigil should have a simple buff that allows survivors to recover whilst running at the same rate as it last was (double the normal time).
---
When the killer is ghostface
---
Anyones mom?
---
I personally disconnect when a killer slugs...i wanna run around and do sh&amp;t, not wipe the maps with my blood just because they r so concerned getting a 4k and waste my time...Bottom line cut and dry, DC and move to another game :)
---
SWF
---
Exactly! I should start messaging the survivors I go against and tell them how much fun I had getting flashlight blinded every time I downed a survivor, or pallet stunned, or decisive striked. Or message the killers and tell them how great I felt when they basemented me and then used BBQ to  locate and down my teammate. I actively turn and nod at Myers to thank him for stalking me, that's how much fun I'm having. Let's spread the positivity!
---
Wow, this is disturbing
---
Would totally add to the immersion if Trapper knew how not to get trapped by his own traps üòÇ
---
I mean.. I play much more Killer than survivor, and I see now need to slug at all.  Also borrowed time and ds only apply to tunneling, if you don‚Äôt like them don‚Äôt tunnel.  However, I see now issue with pips without hard slugging.  Im not referring to like just slugging at the end I meant like slugging everyone down, wasting their unbreakable etc. then hooking all of them.
---
BM-1988 deserves some love aswell. But after Piggy.
---
So I'm guessing Jeff going to kill all the Huns?
---
Honestly the traps should just activate the moment they're put on. Why link them to generators, it makes no sense to give survivor control over the traps, especially since most just 99% gens to completely ignore the trap mechanic. It also makes addons like Tampered Timer somewhat pointless since survivors are most likely going to be able to search 2-3 boxes without the trap even being active. Also, another thing I'd like to see for her crouch is to increase the camera height slighly since at the moment you can't even see through grass when crouched.
---
lol that if i got caught first appreintly killers suck at this game. CHANGE MY F MIND
---
##WAZZZZZZAAAAA
---
No, just learn the game
---
He's rude but most times there isn't a way to save people with just two alive survivors, it's just common courtesy and kindness to let the unhooked survivor have the hatch so....
---
Yeah, it was just a dumb suggestion of mine
---
I mean it'd make regressing a 99% gen take 4 minutes instead of 5 minutes, hardly enough to really make a difference in the vast majority of situations.
---
Lol I would actually say this is far from sweaty, ThrILl oF tHe HunT iS oP
---
Maybe commission it?
---
That's pretty good!
---
If I get moried by devour hope, they deserve it. 
---
Atleast that takes time and skill (and luck) to pull off.
---
Also, if you are being tunneled, and I assume camped on hook, just stay on the hook. When you get in second state, just keep on struggling for as long as you can. Keep wasting the killers time, make them regret the camp, cause they will no doubt depip while your team pops out five gens in your one life bar. Not the funnest thing to do, as you will also depip, but if survivors follow this concept, then camping killers will be lucky to get a one man.
---
I didn‚Äôt watch Star Trek tv show but whoa! Almost same design, very impressive
---
japanese revenge ghosts are wild man
---
Heavy bug fixing. But, yes, it does matter. Only cause the devs are strange. And if you push for a nurse ‚Äúrework‚Äù then they will no doubt make other killers worse. If we are going off of past balance patches. Ya know? Not a knock on you, you have neat ideas. Plus other killers need their ‚Äúbuffworks‚Äù cause nurse still has counter play, its just difficult.
---
I feel like nurse is pretty balanced. You can counter her pretty easily but if you're a new survivor and versing a good nurse then it can seem op. Most, if not all killers are.op in the hands of someone good or just a survivor that isn't good at counterplay
---
By the same thoughtprocess SWF's should never use 4 toolboxes running gens. It aint fun chasing one person for 1min and suddenly 3 gens are already done.
---
like it.
---
they're scary in this game when its your first couple of times playing. those horror movies arent scary after you've watched them 10 times either
---
The plague as of now. The whole ‚Äúnot cleansing‚Äù against her is actually good when you know where survivors are and know how to mind game.
---
How would they make other killers worse by changing a single character??? I‚Äôm not pushing a nurse rework, I believe everyone should be balanced, and personally yes nurse has counterplay but if a nurse is good enough they can force you out of a situation like that. It‚Äôs hard to counter her. It‚Äôs rather than skill it‚Äôs more like a dice roll to see whether they‚Äôre good or bad :/
---
what?
---
If that‚Äôs going to be a cosmetic, I s2g I will main Dwight AKSKSKSKSKKSK
---
Michael will always be scary
---
Yeah, the problem would possibly become that. I would not put it past the devs to think that. But, i‚Äôd hope that if we say that all characters that arnt Hillbilly, Huntress, Spirit, Nurse (and maybe Michael) need buffs, HOPEFULLY they would take that to heart. But, getting everyone better might not be too terrible, but then the vicious cycle continues, and then calls for nerfs come in. There is no winning it seems sometimes lol. Thats why I think the game should just be reworked.
---
Infinite loading screens after clicking join a lobby. Causes me to force quit and retry after almost every match
---
Wtf I didn‚Äôt comment this on your comment, but the top comment. Reddit mobile :/
---
EGC also helps survivors, I once got trapped in the basement for 10 minutes before I dc'd
---
You‚Äôre not the guy to make the sacrifice play. Take away that borrowed time and what are you?
---
Me too, been on Reddit for 4 years and never knew what smh meant
---
I struggled with this a lot too and the only way I found to overcome it was to just keep going and improving. Eventually you'll be good enough that the cocky survivors get their asses handed to them.
---
I think you are misinterpreting his message, they are on 2 different tiers. I think the survivor equivalent was hiding after all the gens are done before EGC was added. Flashlight taunting is like teabagging with pig, doesn't actually effect the gameplay
---
Yeah... it‚Äôs possible if the devs used their heads cuz the solution seems obvious. Spirit and billy are not too strong and annoying to go against but it‚Äôs not impossible to against, cuz they give audio cues when they use their abilities and they have limitations to themselves... nurse limits the survivor, which is biggy dumb
---
&gt;Sexy
---
ftfy
---
And majority reddit demographic is casuals who dont know enough about a game to actually have a discussion about the game. The upvote/downvote system also discourages discussion because one person will be seen as ‚Äúwrong‚Äù if he goes against the hivemind and gets downvoted while the other will be perceived as being ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù if he sticks with the hivemind and gets upvoted. Forums are usually better for discussion but not by much.
---
i want to see Pinhead.
---
He probably was just trying to give you the kill, I do this quite often honestly (but I run and point to a hook)
---
If one of these Hag cosmetics doesn‚Äôt win, i‚Äôm gonna be real salty
---
Base kit Nurse is fine, her add-ons needs a rework.
---
Grow a thicker skin. Its a video game. 
---
It blows my mind how killers are such a cry babies over literally anything. I had a streamer (watched his vod after the game) crying about BM because I was wiggling (pressing A and D) while running during the pallet looping.
---
They changed it recently where now it only works after a unhook so now it's more of an anti-tunnel / camp perk
---
why you are what-ing me ?!. it is a joke if you don't get it :face\_palm:
---
Don't be Tydetime and place three traps the whole match then make a video spreading BLASPHEMY that she's the second weakest killer in the game.
---
I can't quite follow your math. A standard killer moves at  4.6 m/s for 115¬†%, so it wouldn't even take half a second, or do I see it wrong? Obviously, the perk is still good and makes a difference.
---
You can't use balanced landing with Sprint burst, Sprint burst will exhaust you the moment you start running, if you like crouching around use SB because balanced landing takes some getting used to. (Balanced landing is better IF you learn how to use it)
---
It should be mentioned that theurban evasion/Sprint burst is something experienced players do not run BUT as a new player you will get a lot of value out if them. Self care is used but as I said many players stopped running it.
---
So I know that in the grand scheme of things this isn't a huge accomplishment as I'm pretty sure most people have achieved this by now, but there's no one in my life that cares about this game so I thought I'd share  
---
I've been playing for about a year now on PS4 but I only decided around January on my goal to unlock every perk (it took me a while to get the hang of things haha). I started university this year as well so it's been hard trying to find the time but I finally did it!!!  
---
Now, time to P3 everyone. And save up some BP's for Ghostface :D  
---
(P.S. I have the killer perks as well, I just didn't know how to upload more than one screenshot lmao)
---
Normally yes, but a survivor runs at 100% or 4 m/s. Thus the difference in movement speed between a 115% killer and a survivor is only 15% or 0.6 m/s. Gaining those 2 extra meters on the killer at the start can only be overtaken by the killer in their extra speed, thus in the 15%.
---
This is also the reason why a 110% movement speed killer is so much slower compared to a 115% movement speed killer. That 5 percent doesn't look like much but it's 1/3 loss of the speed a normal killer has over a survivor
---
a killer from like 2 years ago that never got made. There's also a apple and a dunce cap in the files to go with it
---
Bear in mind, I generally play at the purple ranks as a Survivor. What I'm trying to say is that I see too many Killers who have been boosted to these ranks.
---
Matches with these people tend to be boring for 3 Survivors, who go up against a Killer who's far too easy; frustrating for one Survivor, who gets unfairly killed; and not that fun for the Killer, who's up against Survivors who are far too good for them.
---
Beyond that, NOED is horrible at low ranks. This is because inexperienced Survivors are unlikely to know where the totems spawn.
---
I'm not saying NOED should be removed, or even reworked, just nerfed.
---
Firstly, they should revert the change which had all tiers of NOED apply the "Exposed" status effect. This would stop the perk being problematic at low ranks. 
---
Secondly, the "Exposed" skull should appear on Survivors' screens as soon as the 5th gen is completed, so Survivors can react accordingly. 
---
Finally, it shouldn't activate when the hatch is closed.
---
I appreciate this, we need more players like that. I once played killer with only one perk because I'm new and I met immersed squadette who gen rushed me so bad I got only 2 hooks. They were bming me entire match, horrible experience.
---
Plague: Lawful Good priestess
---
The Plague: bllLEGH
---
Tell me why they need a buff, when they're already among the strongest perks in the game?
---
I‚Äôve seen u twice now
---
Uh. 
---
Hello.
---
the teacher i think it was called?
---
It would be very overpowered. All of the haste abilities have conditions: balanced landing is jump off and land, lithe is vault a window. The condition of sprint burst is you cant run before hand. Its very balanced the way it is. Take away the condition and its very very OP
---
I would have enjoyed more the original Epic Sax Guy song but here's my upvote anyway.
---
Tyde Tyme didn't put her as second weakest killer in the game, more like fourth or fifth weakest killer in the game.
---
Sorry for ruining your chain I read through the whole thing and it looks great but it‚Äôs quite similar to the doctor
---
We'll make it
---
Lmao, I remember this one from the movies.
---
You‚Äôll probably see me a lot more. 
---
The only way you play spirit is to just mind game at pallets and use her for mobility.
---
Funny post, you deserve an upvote!
---
How is balanced landing better?
---
Laughs in billy
---
Ok she‚Äôs op tbh I‚Äôve been winning a lot but still need perks
---
Missed because of dead hard? No worries! When they pallet stun you and flashlight blind you, you can hear them breathing :D *Adrenaline activates, heavy breathing everywhere*
---
Quite astute observation.
---
Pig=upvote
---
Meanwhile I'm still getting Freddy splinters across several killer bloodwebs despite already owning him. This has to be a bad joke.
---
Now THAT is a symptom of gargantuan testicles
---
While they're at it, pallet vacuum too. Oh, and old ds. Oh, and old bt. Oh, and double pallets. Oh, and insta blind.
---
I mean, they've also announced that performing this bug will get you banned. I don't see what's unfair. Just because it's still in the game doesnt mean you are fully allowed to take advantage of it.
---
Still lies. I forgot exactly where he placed her but wasn't it in D tier?
---
I only lobby dodge when ping is horrible.  I curse that one survivor with 600 ping who readied up without even noticing they'll be rubber banding all across the map the whole game. I hate having to dodge because I usually have to wait upwards of 10 minutes for a single lobby.
---
she just busted out Zenyatta's ultimate
---
Franklins bait. Its a strat.
---
A good nurse/3 gen doc
---
LOL, even old DS takes more skill than MoM.
---
&gt;If you don't realize then how dumb you are for being mad over small things
---
&gt;It blows my mind how killers (or people trying to play killer) are such a cry babies over literally anything
---
Dumb and a cry baby? That's rude, thick skin or not.
---
The person you're referring to seems to believe becoming thick-skinned is as easy as flipping a switch and boom, we stop being thin-skinned and stop giving  a fuck. Telling a thin-skinned person to grow thicker skin is about as helpful as telling a depressed person to stop being sad. It's not helpful.
---
&gt;Is wiggling your survivor while running considered "needlessly rude" to you?
---
It's not, and that's not what he was talking about.
---
I would say MoM is a bit harder to use then old DS, you just hit a skill check. The only skillful aspect in MoM is when you're against a non M1 killer like Huntress, then the skill is trying to force her to M1 you instead.
---
Holy shit people are actually justifying the way the huntress played that‚Äôs fucking sad
---
HEX: No one Escapes Death
---
Once the Exit Gates are powered, if there is a Dull Totem remaining on the Map, this Hex is applied to it.
---
While this Hex is active, Survivors suffer from the Exposed Status Effect and your movement speed is increased by 2/3/4 %
---
Mike is legit. Especially with Scratched Mirror.
---
he also published it publicly. despite not saying how he did it, he did make it known to the public that there is still a way to do it which could potentially spark a second wave of multiple killer matches. which I'm sure had something to do with the ban. And he used it at least 2 times as shown in his video. Possibly more. To report bugs, simply directly contact BHVR especially if it's not a very common one as this. If there's a bug that's very easy to do through normal gameplay they can expect many people to catch on quick, and those types of bugs are probably higher on their list to fix. but this bug doesnt "just happen".
---
Did you even watch the video?
---
it‚Äôs beautiful!! x.x
---
Oh shit I didn't think these were official, I thought these were fan made
---
For the first half of your uncloaking, you don't make any noise, but they can see you uncloaking. 
---
So if you hear survivors working on a generator start the uncloak behind a wall and then move closer to maximize how close you can get when you  fully uncloak.
---
Ghostface but good
---
That guy was a jackass
---
Sprint burst forces you to slowly walk around the map. It's only giving you a little head start against killers, they may expect that you run it if they see you walk. It's good for countering stealth killers but that's not that useful. Balanced landing makes specific tiles loop-able thanks to it's passive effect such as: houses on Badham and Haddonfield, the boat on Pale Rose, the pantry on Grim Pantry, the whole Game map, hills, the Asylum middle building etc. It makes dangerous places not dangerous or strong ones even stronger.
---
I did this to 2 people on one of the bedrooms in the top floor of Haddon field house that had no windows and one narrow door. Just blocked them in until endgame got them it's funny asf
---
Nope, just saw more complaining and was annoyed. I was in the wrong.
---
Great song
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and even I think ‚Äúdoor camping‚Äù sounds dumb.
---
Everyone should play fair and non toxic. A lil bit teabagging isnt toxic imo, but yeah. Toxic people ruining this game
---
Lmao
---
The dbd 3rd anniversary stream chat was very toxic
---
Too bad I play console and don‚Äôt have an end game chat.
---
Lol
---
Very
---
It‚Äôs even worse when it‚Äôs a trapper or hag who when there‚Äôs 3 gens they decide to just out their traps around those gens
---
Did you get him with cells?
---
Feelsbadman
---
Permanent trauma needs some rework, survivors without self care would be boned
---
It was designed that way deliberately. Adding a button would result in all the other exhaustion perks being made redundant. 
---
You can already kind of do that in the game with practice. If you recover your exhaustion to 99% then you can run around the map to pause the recovery. This can allow you to stop running for a second to regain your sprint burst when you wish to activate it again. 
---
The only downside is that you cannot stop or work on a gen.
---
I'm survivor main too x'D that's the thing why I'm laughing so hard about that
---
I'm totally fine with strategic slugging in situations where it's reasonable to go for it, but going against an actual slug build is incredibly boring and just makes me inclined to dc since I'm going to be sitting on the ground the whole time anyways.
---
Multiple posts of people obsessed with certain characters asses
---
when I look in r\DBD I can only find memes from ghostface well done dbd
---
We haven‚Äôt seen post rework Freddy yet, he could still very well be weak af
---
Exactly. This is for my homies that have seen the show.
---
you cant change peoples minds, they are like they are. Sometimes really kind and non toxic, and sometimes just the shitbag we all know and hate.
---
oh yeah theres that.. ah well then don't play "toxic" atleast
---
Good one, Officer Doofy
---
It‚Äôs only fair to be toxic to face campers
---
Thousandaire, playboy, narcissist.
---
How? Not only can ghostface NOT stalk through corn, survivors can detect him through it and delete his power in my testing in KYF.
---
Thank you for the help and I guess I'm keeping balanced landing
---
Yeah, I did. I had no interest in acquiring Quentin.
---
how long have you been playing?
---
as in hours I mean, if you're still less than 100 hours and havent played the game a lot you should avoid getting tilted. The game has a really annoying learning curve since there's a lot of things you dont even realize, but it becoems easier once you start seeing those things.

Sure if they remove every pallet besides shack from the map. Then that would be fair.
---
is this real footage
---
They've been there since nurse released I think? Not sure exactly on the timing but they're not new or anything.
---
I had a similar situation with a leather face yesterday. Me and this random found the hatch. I tea bagged it to communicate to them to stay and I let leatherface chase and hook me at the other side of the map. I still pipped, but I'd rather sacrifice myself so one will get out than all of us die.
---
Annoying as it is that it activates on its own (which is why I only use it if I have nothing else) choosing when to activate would change it to a ridiculously broken version of dead hard.
---
Legit, when people say that, there just as bad as the person being toxic to them lol, its so cringey
---
The first perk is so useless.
---
Ok Gerry Buckets

This is probably the most unique Susie cosplay I've seen so far! I like the purple-pink fade colored hair (now that I see it, id like a Susie skin with that hair.) great cosplay!
---
I‚Äôm not to proud to beg. Heck at the end of the day you just gotta creep, creep
---
Thanks for the comment/agreement!
---
I noticed that BHVR (and some but not all of the community) seemed to treat aura and color issues as 'not a very big deal' and wanted to throw in my two cents.
---
It can be disorienting, dizzying, trying to focus on *something that your eyes just can't see very well - and in some maps at all.*
---
It has a blurring effect, not only does the attempt detract from your overall awareness of the environment, what you do see almost feels... Hazy; and *looking through red* like with BBQ&amp;C + generator auras is even more horrifying.
---
It's easier to spot BBQ&amp;C auras because it's something that is suddenly there and then isn't anymore (the human eye being drawn to movement, etc) but even they (**still**) don't work well on certain maps.
---
Edit: Changed Phobia, added a survivor, and changed the add-ons.
---
To be honest, achieving dream chaser score is really easy. And chasing is just gonna take a bit of time.
---
There's thousands of artists out there, all with a wide array of talents and skills. I'm not one myself, but there is bound to be someone who can do exactly what you want for a cheap price. Try Tumblr or Discord!
---
it would definitely has it place in the meta.
---
I dont think they'd do that since vigil already affects more than just exhaustion, but it's a hope.
---
So the story behind this one is a doozy. 
---
I recently got my girlfriend into 0oayinf dbd so when she's over we take turns playing killer usually. 
---
I take first game and played with a SWF group as the Spirit.

Ive only used her a few times so I'm not the best with her tbh. Still learning how to do phase mind games.

Anyway first game I hook a couple people, break a couple gens. Get looped and palleted once the usual. 
---
Eventually I'm get this guy trying to do a Gen by the basement, so into the basement he goes!! 
---
Now the basement is right in between the three close gens. Perfect for patrolling! So that's what I do. Although a went by the 4th Gen that was a bit away a few times and phase backed fast to check on stuff. 
---
Anyways this group doesn't even try and sneak just keeps running down the stairs trying to unhook each other. Within 5 mins of this I have 3 all hooked and sacrificed to the entity... Last guy was smart and decided to camp and take the hatch haha. 
---
Anyways sends me these messages whining about "camping". As I said in them wtf else was I supposed to do? 
---
Anyways next turn my gal goes and plays as the trapper. Same group... 
---
Now she's not very good at being a killer, to be frank she sucks especially at chases. She hooks a couple of people still l, then gets looped like almost the rest the game by one of them. 
---
She gets him and face camps him hard. 
---
This SWF team isn't having it, body blocking attempts at flashlighting commences. 
---
Somehow she still manages to get 3 of them. 
---
Ome of them being the same guy who messaged me before. So I message him back having a laugh at his expense. 
---
Also to be upfront I know I'm an ahole in the messages, but honestly I get these sort of a messages wayy too often so pretty much just at sarcastic and condescending.
---
I swear survivors are really the worse. I've been only playing seriously as a survivor this season for the first time and am now rank 7 and still climbing and it's only made me more sure of how and I hate this word due to how overused it is but.. "Toxic" survivors are.
---
Exactly me lol
---
I've been able to stalk through corn. Marked three people in one match, they were on the gens.
---
The fucking mouth looks horrifying. 
---
I love it!
---
He said it later to me that I'm a camper .___.
---
What anime is this?
---
Learn pallet and vault locations so you can loop killers. Unless he has addons that decrease the time it requires you to fall asleep and you have 7 seconds to get away from him
---
He just sits still for a couple of seconds and will disappear. He cannot move, and swinging will make him reappear. It can mindgame survivors. Picture this:
---
1. You chase a survivor, then you become still.
---
2. You disappear and they are confused/mindgamed.
---
3. You reappear and you smack them.
---
PC 
---
Can't get into killer lobbies, indefinite loading. After a long wait I might get into a match but get disconnected mid-match anyway.
---
Was it angrypug? I heard he does that a lot but I'm not sure
---
Oink!
---
MoM
---
She did kill the entire ward in one night, patients and employees alike.
---
Did she kill them with her crazy hitbox?
---
Wraith: found out he killed innocent people so he killed his boss.
---
Also Wraith: *hides from people*
---
Got the yeezys, off white, and the dual rollies.
---
Konosuba. It's quite hilarious, go try it.
---
They are working on it, with the dedicated servers. Redditor, research your shit :p
---
I think he means ash Williams will probably star in his own video game instead of as a dlc character for DBD or MK11
---
I had my progress deleted last summer during the event. The devs gave me 47mil bloodpoints (my statistics said I only earned 35 at that time). With these points I was able to finally level up all killers to lvl 40 (I had all survivors to 40 before the reset). And I've spent my points way more rationally than I did before. I'd say that was the best thing that happend to me in DbD. Devs even gave me back my event cosmetics that I've lost along with progress. But, spending 47mil bloodpoints is a nightmare, hahah
---
That couldn't work. Let's say I level Bubbha and unlocked BBQ. I now have bbq on huntress. When I reset do I loose bbq on every other character I have it on? I think that would either screw teachables, or it would break the game because you could unlock teachable and then reset and use the bloodpo8nts on who you want.
---
Nobody is forcing you to buy a character you are not happy with.
---
Don't wait for him to be changed and if he isbgood then, buy him
---
Yeah, but he got his ass beaten all throughout his movies too.
---
First and foremost.
---
you liked your own comment and has so little shame that you still screenshotted it.
---
also r/youngpeopleyoutube
---
I think Ghostface is gonna pick the right one because who doesn't love getting their ability denied just by getting looked at
---
Laughs is Doctor. 
---
Screams in Survivor.
---
Don't buy him then, he has no OP perks and the power is trash.
---
The problem with 360 thing is that axis is broken. Its like a point 1m behind you and you rotate around it amd not around yourself.
---
Pretty much unrealistic, broken mechanic. I hate this shit, and i don't even fall for it.
---
Amazing quality, I love it!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Are we gonna not mention they gave a guy a jumpsuit and a mask? Think I‚Äôve seen that somewhere too
---
Oh no! They're evolving!
---
You have prestige for it. And you get your 2.000.000+ bp made into bloody cool customisation
---
When we was kids, my friend would always play as the sharebean, and I was always the funshinebean.
---
Exactly. I mean, I understand that a chapter every 3 months keeps the game fresh, but it also isn't the most efficient use of time or resources. Besides, I personally think the hype would be much bigger for a new chapter if they arrived semi-annually.
---
Ormond has also unreadable scratchmarks. I just can't play on this map cuz scratches are invsible, constanc Poised/Dance with me...
---
[deleted]
---
Don't know. I'll cross my fingers it makes it to release.
---
Survivior I'd remove: Ace. His powers don't aid in surviving, they focus on the RNG aspect of the game which I'm not a major fan of. 
---
Killer I'd remove: probably Nurse. I main her but honestly I'm kinda scared of what they'll do to her and I'd much rather they just excise her from the game than rework her into hot garbage and further divide the community between the Nurse mains that wanted her to stay good and the rest of the playerbase that would dance on her grave.
---
I need the Feng Leggins xD but in all honesty, really nicely done, for some reason bhvr thinks Asians are either esport players or traditionally clothed...
---
Trust me, not much is gonna change by release.
---
I would give up on playing killer if these perks were real.
---
The only viable option for killer mains would be to get good with nurse. It would break the game completely.
---
Good artwork though. I like the nature theme as well.
---
I just dont understand their logic of releasing a broken killer
---
Hey, I've got the exact same keyboard!
---
I just dont understand their logic of releasing a broken kille
---
Because the devs do not play the game, they just make stuff which sounds good but doesn't work.
---
Watch anniversary stream,he can even teleport to generators
---
Yep, they been working on him for a few months, they probably won't be able to just completely change his power (which is basically what he needs, unless they are gonna bump his power up a ton by changing numbers)
---
Christ...
---
God, OoO is such a bullshit perk...
---
Yes easily
---
i guess the Entity really want us to make the survivors suffer
---
My name is Inigo Montoya
---
She literally has a mind of a fucking five year old, wtf
---
TBF The old skill check was miniscule and hard to hit, especially on a console frame rate.
---
but you can choose not to chase them
---
Claudette, just because when they‚Äôre full on immersed Blendette‚Äôs it‚Äôs annoying on both sides. 
---
For killer i‚Äôd say Billy. I‚Äôm on PS4 so Nurse is fine but every time I hear that chainsaw (which is a good 70% of my survivor games) I want to stick a pencil in my ears.
---
(For the ones that don‚Äôt know. This cosmetic set is based on Aldo Raine from the movie Inglorious Bastards)
---
Congratulations! Enjoy trying to level up your main and having to spend BP for Technician and Left Behind.
---
Wowww, so toxiccc
---
Myers :(
---
Ok but toolboxes aren't a problem at all anymore, doesn't work for the comparison.
---
r/Animemes is leaking!
---
But, which dev thought making a totem spawn near a fucking gen spawn was a great idea?
---
but in the end decisive strike trumps all (whoever got the refrence, marry me)
---
Your best bet is to treat every survivor like they have decisive strike and try not to attack them off hook. Just slap them down to deny the rescuer a safe unhook and chase the other person. Their decisive will time out and you'll delay them.
---
i really should change my name, everytime i see the word pacifist i think that the post is about me and get an anxiety attack.
---
You should submit this to the cosmetic competition!
---
Sorry üòî
---
This is too good for this sub.
---
try using snipping tool, it works exactly like a screenshot
---
Based.
---
Make leveling up easy plesse, it's too much of a grind sometimes
---
As evidenced by my flair, Nurse. I love the control I have over chases and how I'm rewarded for good blinks. Instead of having to wait for a survivor to fuck up a loop. There are survivors who are savvy to how I play though. The mind games they pull will always be more fun than looping. I play spirit for the same reasons.
---
Off topic, but I really need that Ghostface outfit in my life now, it looks way better.
---
Just passed the 24h, i got as far as rank 13.
---
I've been playing mostly Nea as surv and trapper/wraith as killer, most of the times I've played decently, even against rank 5+ ppls with all purple abilities.
---
Can you drop some examples?
---
I still don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúthey only got the rights to the mask‚Äù
---
In the Mid-Chapter patch, they're changing the names of all Licensed Killers to match this. It's to make them more unique than the originals. Michael is becoming "The Evil Shape", Leatherface will be "The Leather Face", Amanda will be "The Pig Mask", and Freddy will be "The Nightmare on Elm Street".
---
Nah, they know. I've been on the receiving end of a few splinters. Everyone shits their pants when they see the offering not flip + everyone spawns nearby.
---
Hell no. All my killers are P3 50 with all perks. I'm currently getting all my survivors to P3 50 now. I have no idea how many points I'd be refunded if I lost my progress. I know it would take a really really long time to put those points back.
---
same here. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Because they work. BBQ is literally free blood points. Nurses Calling is the best tracking perk we have next to whispers because a lot survivors immediately try to self care when they break chase. And only low rank killers use NOED.
---
Also, the more popular build is the enduring / spirit fury chase build.
---
Guess we'll never know...
---
Been playing this game for around a year and a half. TIL.
---
For survivors id probably remove claudette. She's super hard to see especially on MacMillan estate maps and I just hate her
---
For killers I'd remove leatherface because he's a pile of shit and his power isn't unique. He's just a worse Billy and some of his add ons are busted. The only good things about him is his perks
---
Think it's because BBQ was in the shrine recently, and Ruin as well a few months back. They just are the two perks with the best effects in the game
---
No i mean as an option. You can reset survivor/killer progress (and get the bp back) for x shards
---
They only got the rights to the mask not the characters that played as Ghostface Stu &amp;billy Roman, etc. The scream franchise got the license to the mask also even though it wasn't created for it. Fun world created the mask in 1991 while scream came out in 1996 which means that they bought the license to use it in the movie.
---
This isn't holding the match hostage though - it's securing a kill with EGC. If he had hit the feng the match wouldn't have gone on any longer.
---
Yes, I agree, the 2010 Freddy is fucking hideous. Every time I see him, it's "look how they massacred my man"
---
Run decisive strike! If you manage to hit the skill check (which isn‚Äôt too hard), it‚Äôll temporarily stun the killer and give you enough time to run away and hide. Killers really seem to camp/tunnel at low ranks, so getting decisive the earlier the better! However, decisive is a perk that belongs to Laurie Strode, a dlc character. So I really urge you to get Decisive strike whenever it‚Äôs on the Shrine of Secrets! Unless you want to buy Laurie and then level her up until 35+
---
I always play fair and usually don't get hate. But that's when I do look at chat - most of the times, I leave before anyone can send a message
---
Swap unrelenting and distressing for sloppy butcher and nurses calling. Unrelenting is pretty pointless once you play a little more and distressing isn't that useful other than the bloodpoints. Sloppy butcher helps you slow the game by making it take longer to heal, it also goes well with nurses calling, which allows you to see healing survivors.
---
Noed is a controversial perk but if you really care about winning then consider running it instead of iron grasp
---
Yes please!
---
I get mad from time to time, but I try to remind myself that it's just a game and that there will be nicer players.
---
That‚Äôs a very dear compliment to me, thank you.

Now all we need is the stoned face as a cosmetic for Ghostface 
---
"aww man am I fucking stoned" - Ghostface
---
Did you just say tentacles about a japanese girl
---
Yea for me it's really active I never have trouble looking for lobbies. The longest its probably taken me to look for one is 1 min so I would say it's pretty active
---
MoM could be useful if you got slugged though. You should replace it with something that's always useless like Urban or Premonition.
---
Drop a pallet, flash their eyeballs during the end of the breaking animation. You see a teammate go down close by, flash them like a stripper. There you go
---
1. I heard that taking a hit near a hooked Survivor counts as a protection hit. 
---
2. With current MoM, you'll often go down once before triggering it.
---
3. You run Borrowed so even if the Killer does tunnel, the unhooked Survivor will last long enough for you to get a stack.
---
Either way, its redundant. Come the 18th, MoM will be dead.
---
Adept Pig is difficult. Hangman's does nothing if there's no sab, which is almost every match. Surveillance is a great information tool. Make Your Choice is nice, but one hit downs will lower your chaser emblem.
---
Play normally, don't stay anywhere near hooks. You NEED a lot of hooks to get your Devout and Malicious emblems.
---
You want your traps to stall a lot, but not get kills. Trap kills often mean the survivors aren't getting hooked 3 times or being chased/hooked enough.
---
In general bringing combat straps/video tape is always good, you can also try the green Jigsaw's Annotated Plan with Crate of Gears to maximise the time your traps waste, or Last Will for more traps.
---
There's very little tactic to traps these days since saving them does very little, maybe hold one to attempt it going on between the 4th and 5th gen for a late game trap, but ideally you want them all dead by then.
---
Dude thats pizzaface
---
There is something so hilarious about how small Michael Myers is and how huge Pig's head is
---
(Due to the animals they're pasted over, but still hilarious)
---
No worries Citizen, i the random meme stranger shall make everyones day.
---
Tombstone myers does match his lore tho
---
Oh shoot I had no clue about the legal complications. Any idea on that release date by chance? Thanks :D
---
Isn't it considered bodyblocking, which is under one of the reportable categories?
---
Doesn't it always?
---
Tombstone breh
---
The clothes are actually just stuff from the thrift store and my closet while I made the mask from paper mache the night before the convention haha
---
Thanks!
---
I see. I thought they started testing them in some regions or something, but you're right, it's way too early.
---
The killers all got captured and experimented on by a single survivor during the hallow blight. They definitely ain't shit in the lore either :^)
---
Yout not oinking enough that is it.
---
&gt;1. I heard that taking a hit near a hooked Survivor counts as a protection hit. 
---
You don't unless another survivor is right next to you. Of course, protection hits are super buggy, so there may be other cases where it gives it to you.
---
&gt;2. With current MoM, you'll often go down once before triggering it.
---
And it completely removes the benefit of the perk. Only a fool intentionally let's themselves go down just to activate a perk that prevents themselves from going down once. MoM is supposed to reward getting hit without going down.
---
&gt;3. You run Borrowed so even if the Killer does tunnel, the unhooked Survivor will last long enough for you to get a stack.
---
It's not the killer hitting the unhooked survivor that denies a stack, it's them not immediately hitting the unhooker. If the killer doesn't hit you when you're practically touching another survivor, it doesn't count as a protection hit.
---
And of course, that's ignoring the bug where a hit can count as a protection hit without giving a stack.
---
&gt;Either way, its redundant. Come the 18th, MoM will be dead.
---
And that's a problem.
---
It will always be Kate
---
Beautiful
---
But it's not on PlayStation. I wish it was. L4D is on Xbox but Valve always has their IP appear in other games but only if the game is the PC version. Take Saints Row 3 with the Team Fortress items that are only on the PC version.
---
It's an honest opinion from a female. So I'd take it and fix that outfit
---
Omg...üíÄ
---
The dress part is ugly the hat and glasses don't go with the outfit.. we wanna make Kate look pretty.
---
For that comp only everything else is üí©
---
Lmaooooo that's hilarious... naw hexy uses that selfcare constantly...
---
Love the shell as the hair, really nice touch.
---
Pretty sure I've seen this exact same joke before on this subreddit. Same format and everything.
---
"Did you have fun?" Oh Lord...
---
To the mask? WTF?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueDependableNuggetsKappaClaus
---
Slugging is fine. Any decent killer will slug on occasion. It‚Äôs necessary sometimes. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you if you don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs part of the game just like looping and doing gens is.
---
Just play the game rank doesnt mean anything, just that you play more than others..
---
I got a message on Console, saying that I tunnel this person because of her name.
---
"ImHerGayNugget"
---
This person got unhooked 2 seconds after I hooked her.
---
The sad part is that he isn't the only M1 killer with a useless power ...
---
Tmv the UV and Texture wrap fail to load
---
Technically that isn‚Äôt gen rushing.
---
Oof I love this cosmetic idea it's so amazing
---
I have one problem with this as you‚Äôre clearly trying to play a game as Claudette
---
Ahhhh, hopefully it's a killer and a survivor then. Wendigo hag and this seem to be the fan favorites
---
She got the power of anger and the Entity actually felt more power in her than in her dad.
---
Get rid of bloodlust!! Problem solved!
---
Yeah but i dont have the dlc for hag and im not planning on buying it soon
---
Well in response to 3 gens popping at once, there's other perks to help slow down the game other than ruin like Thanataphobia, Sloppy Butcher, Dying Light (even tho Tunneling the obsession for it is annoying) and so on. I played as Pig for the first time yesterday twice and both games I didn't have ANY game stalling perks and still got a 3k/4k. They aren't necessarily a normal to have lol, I ran two perks the first game and 3 the next, being Franklins, MYC and Discordance. As for the blood point farming, isn't there more perks that help farm bloodpoints? Besides, killers have it easy when it comes to bloodpoints compared to survivors. Killers can get twice as much BP as survivors in just one game depending on how the match goes and that's WITHOUT BP farm perks. Anyway, I'm not trying to sound like an ass or trying to tell ppl how to play, im just stating my opinion and making suggestions so if I came off rude with this comment I apologize. But please don't think I'm only talking about killers, because survivors are the same. Instead of self care they could use perks like bond or use medkits, instead of exhaustion perks they could idk try not to sit and camp a gen/pallet until the killer gets there and be smart lol, and plenty of other things
---
Dont trap and camp... cant stress that enough defeats the purpose of the hag.
---
Then I'd recommend wraith as in my opinion he is a pretty fun character with plenty of  builds like Nascar wraith or no loops today wraith.
---
I love how they buffed it in the ptb btw.
---
Yea, I had this happen to me on a hatch.
---
Didn't know, just tagged with them lol
---
Sometimes it's a game of chance but looping (mirroring) tiles &amp; baiting hits/respect at pallets is generally a powerful way to deal with tunneling. 
---
Windows and down pallets are pretty great spots for forcing direction changes &amp; quickly adding to the distance between the killer and you. 
---
Decisive strike and dead head are both effective perks to counter tunneling with, depending on your play style.
---
Are you trying to insinuate that I only play survivor?
---
I thought only trapper?
---
Yes Kate does.  I‚Äôm a Legion main as killer.  Kate has Dance With Me, Windows of Opportunity and Boil Over
---
oh lawd he coming
---
oh l a w d
---
&gt; ..till my infinite tombstone procs
---
And you get to wave the survivors goodbye as they all run out through the exit gates!
---
^(*i hate the evil incarnate achievement so much...*)
---
You talking bout Jane? Hell no I can‚Äôt help but to chase after that big ol booty
---
Adrenaline is one of my fav perks, feels too good when you can bait a hit knowing the last gen is about to pop.
---
Theyre just assumptions after seeing how they play
---
 „Çπ„Ç≠„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•
---
Because it's an uncounterable perk that takes no skill to use and ruins the game for M1 killers...?
---
Loads of people have done this in game yet every week we have someone post this to the subreddit as if they've just experienced the most original swf names and costumes in existence.
---
Menu screen is all in bold, black surrounds everything if you know what I mean. After match, I was stuck just seeing the 4 survivors running. No way of exiting to main menu or anything, had to restart game.
---
Thats some fly hacks right there.
---
100% agree with this. Minus the Mohawk tho, maybe a close crew cut or something
---
Can you spot him and cancel the power from a locker?!?
---
Everyone cosplays Legion because it‚Äôs literally a hoodie, jeans and a cardboard mask. I‚Äôm not knocking anybody‚Äôs skill it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs an overdone thing now
---
Even during chases
---
Straw man
---
Yes! I think hybridpanda is a good choice. He is pretty entertaining and gives tips and tricks for new players. He also does great livestreams. The King is also good
---
You are saying that looping the killer like that and blinding him when he breaks a pallet isn't toxic. Go watch a couple of noob3's toxic videos and then come back and tell me what's toxic and what's not.
---
No not really. They both have chainsaws but that's about it. Billy's chainsaw is used completely differently in and out of chase. They're about as similar as Wraith and Billy.
---
So as wraith, how do you counter pallet looping?
---
you don‚Äôt belong on reddit please leave tasteless local
---
If you can't get a single person on the hook before all gens are done, the problem lies with you. I mean, 3 are on a gen, fair enough, by the way, that should also be the case without a non SWF team; anyway, you should at least be chasing one guy and be hooking him before 5 gens are done.
---
Who the heck says this? Saying any perk in this game takes skill (other than arguably exhaustion perks) is silly. What killer perks take skill? Honest question.
---
Because most of the perks in this game are useless.
---
Now that's a real teammate
---
If I only chase one guy I will be flamed for tunneling anyways, sounds like a lose-lose situation to me.
---
You could call it gen rushing. You could also call it "playing the game"  
---
You have to complete gens to win the game. Calling someone a gen rusher is the same as if you were to call a killer a "hook rusher" because he keeps hooking people.
---
Often times "gen rusher" is said with toxic connotation. When, in reality, the person saying it is probably just upset because they are losing/already lost.
---
That‚Äôs dumb
---
Nothing in DBD really takes much skill. MoM does require you to be hit 3 times though and any killer with an instadown or non m1 attack counter it 
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Nah, just some no name.
---
I guess, man. Some people really try on their cosplays. I know I tried on the mask, but I mostly made this so I could hang out with my friends at the convention and have fun while doing it, haha
---
It‚Äôs time for your to die now and for me to leave
---
Teammates when i play survivor: hiding in corners all the time, doing nothing the entire game
---
Teammates when i play killer:
---
What do you mean? You chase one guy, 3 are completing gens. You get him down, you hook him, and you go look for the others. Someone's gonna rescue the guy on a hook, will probably heal him as well, that makes one potential down or two. 
---
You're supposed to slow them down and keep the pressure on them. If they can do 5 gens as fast as you pretend them to be able to, you're not applying enough pressure.
---
That's not even self care's fault imo. That person's just stupid. They had to make the save and they didn't. You can't heal yourself in that kind of situation.
---
Yea and give the wiggly worm on your shoulder extra time to wiggle!
---
I'm new but what I have gathered it's pretty much a killer that can only use their normal strike because their ability is not useful and m1 means mouse 1 because that's how you attack on pc
---
You just injured a survivor for free, and he also wasn't on a gen. Some of you is just unbelievable.
---
Exactly,  maybe a couple of years back the prices and grind were fine but now we got many more characters so the prices should adapt and be like 1-2k cheaper for all things. Or at least have many more x2 BP events and maybe the BP Cap at 2/3 Millions because 1 isn't even enough to fully prestige. And every perk has tiers so you will see this perk 2 to 3 times and you have to do double/triple the work to advance to next perks.
---
But nooooo when you get BBQ first Tier it disappears like a rare Pokemon you have to hunt it again for 20 more Bloodweb Pages!
---
Yeah, you buy killer specific perks for all killers with iridescent shards from levelling up (only 4 available perks per week and it‚Äôs a bit of a grind to get shards) or you can level killers up to 30/35/40 for each one of their perks.

Thank you so much!

Here's this image again.
---
It's not a repost. The old ones uses colored caps, while this one uses the flat caps.
---
Well I plan to play a lot so I can grind out enough just to buy it from the shop that's good because I don't wanna be spending 8 bucks on a killer I'm not gonna use Haha
---
Its called a joke, didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to put /s for that to be obvious.
---
It will always amaze me how quick killer mains jump out to defend lobby dodging but bitch about DCs.
---
Thanks I think I've got a susie and huntress fetish now
---
This is a clip from Konosuba.
---
You're welcome
---
Just not playing the majority of the cast of killers isn't a "counter"
---
Nope
---
Not a survivor either

This version of the song is also quite good: https://youtu.be/XtkCkMwmqVU

that's not toxic. it's making the most of what is given. blinding a killer while they break pallets might disorient them if you're lucky and allow you to lose them, or they have proper hearing and find out where you're going regardless. 
---
She didn't teabag, she didn't show any form of BM. She played optimally. that's not toxic. just because noob3 calls himself toxic when he does it doesn't make it so.
---
wow that‚Äôs unfortunate
---
No, that was obvious.

P3 KATE SQUAD WHERE U AT
---
people who think chucky as a killer is a good idea have a small IQ
---
Bbq and chilli has only appeared once in the shop in the last year i believe, and it was quite recent, so if you want it from there you might have to wait a while, but yeah if you aren‚Äôt going to play them that much then it‚Äôs not gonna be worth $5 for a perk. Hopefully there will be a sale with the anniversary, usually in their sales they half price the dlc packs.
---
I like to imagine it's bc he's still getting used to the high heels he finally got the courage to wear.
---
I found a purple key by a closed exit gate. I picked it up and escaped. Thank you to whoever dropped it there.
---
&gt;Killers that don't rely on their m1 counter it. 
---
This is literally the definition of uncounterable, if you can't use an entire section of the killer roster. If you can't beat it based on who you loaded in as, then it is broken.
---
Woooo it‚Äôs so nice 
---
If they release that I‚Äôm buying it for Feng! &lt;3
---
Devs‚Äî&gt; Auric cells
---
Nah.
---
Oh if a sale happens I would get all the licensed killers just so I have them hopefully they do
---
Well it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre completely ignorant and incorrect, so try again. Maybe when you‚Äôre actually right about something come back and try again
---
didnt they make it so that you actually have to aim for the face on PC
---
Nea hooking The Ghost in the basement and then blocking the stairs like
---
That's a good question. I don't know.
---
I believe the spirit is the Devs version is the grudge.  I made a post about penny wise awhile back and most of the people said that pennywise could not be taken by the entity because he basically his own entity.
---
Shaper? I hardly knew 'er!
---
Thats what I did, I bought the licensed killers in a sale as you can‚Äôt earn them in game, then earned iridescent shards for the other killers.
---
Knowing how the Entity works, she probably got tortured for long enough and finally snapped.
---
I heard you dropped something, this isnt it but i hope this orange pointy thing is a good enough replacement
---
Astonishing
---
On other character i rush lvl but on my feng min i‚Äôm buying every single thing i need

Lmao take my upvote

The invert problem is becouse ur pressing the touch pad in the middle i used to do it too accidentally when i'd get smacked but i finally figured it out.
---
pig=upvote
---
NO! THE FACT THAT YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA MAKES IT 100% WORSE
---
It's not the grind that needs changed, just the amount of time it takes clicking to spend the bloodpoints on 50 levels of stuff you're never going to use.
---
Now we just need yellow and purpole clothing for Dwight
---
Amazing! You found a purple flashlight!! Bet you felt good!
---
I always grab the perk first, because the Entity starts eating the blood web as soon as you buy a perk.
---
Don't really think it was a joke, as there was no joke, or laughter, or sense of irony in the way he said it. But maybe.
---
I here by invite you to the Oinkers. Would you like to join? Make your Choice.

Uh, Hag has her titty exposed too.
---
first I've seen this
---
What kind of uncultured man are you
---
Yeah I know but usually low rank Freddy's don't have his good add ons. And I've never went against a fast sleep Freddy so I have no tips for that
---
Bruce is pretty much a master when it comes to playing dumb in his own way, that's what I mean he's not doing it in the "Haha gotcha" sense, it's more him doing his own humour of acting stupid when he's making it obvious he's joking about not knowing.
---
Doesn't the problem lie more with killer design then?
---
Definitely lightweight 3
---
True. I equip it when me and my friends are bored and we start joking around pretending to be braindead survivors.
---
Then I guess certain survivor perks aren't actual counters to some killer powers/perks because you don't know what killer is going to load in? That isn't what counter means. You also neglected instadowns.
---
These are really, really good. They would shake up the meta and give survivors more tools to break chases and avoid the killer without having to resort to looping. I especially like the one that allows you to see scratch marks.
---
But it is toxic and as long as people keep playing toxic on both sides this game isn't enjoyable to play.
---
Ok then.
---
I honestly would have preferred him over Laurie.
---
In case you didnt get it, its a joke that shes both pretty and full of vomit at the same time. They probably liked the picture
---
I now five games under my belt and all as a killer.  I wish there was a way to know what people thought of me as a killer lol.
---
I can't be all bad as I've outscored the survivors in all five games and have two 4ks ... I just wonder if people think "fuck that guy hes cheap" or man, that was a gg.  Xbone doesn't have post game chat.
---
This is a low effort meme, but still a great one.
---
Lol I love this comment
---
Harry Warden from My Bloody Valentine is probably one of the most requested killers and he would probably be able to have a interesting ability as he is a Miner.
---
Yeah no. Moris inhibit survivors way more than any survivor item now.  Use a good killer and it won't phase you.
---
Huh, I never realized the connection there, just assumed it was a random bug.
---
Ever get a haddonfield offering played by a survivor? Prepare your anus for four balanced landings.
---
Thank you so much!!‚Äô
---
Alexa, play Cold Play 'Fix You'.
---
*coughs and wheezes in agreement*
---
killer is supposed to score higher than survivors for points
---
All of them but hag really. I just can‚Äôt stand hags power
---
Map with the add on to mark places for survivors
---
It‚Äôs a map add on
---
You think everyone lives on this sub?
---
Wasn‚Äôt the whole deal that the Entity yanked him out of his world when the police showed up?
---
I would have quit chasing you very quickly if you were owning me so badly.
---
I would imagine my gens all getting fixed while you ran me in circles.
---
Remove her chain blink add-ons and change her add-on that allows you to see where you will blink to a brown. That way people have an easier time learning her which will make her less difficult for newer killers to use. Base Nurse is perfectly fine. And she has counter play, it just isn't looping. Which most survivors see as their only defense. 
---
I'm tired of the default rework suggestion being a resource meter. Next you're going to tell me that lethal blinks should apply deep wounds on injured survivors.
---
I've had that happen when I played freddy
---
with

---
These are awesome! Can you try to get these artworks into the DBD store as some posters? I would buy these in a heartbeat!
---
If i include pig in anything i post will you upvote it
---
Maybe the should focus of polishing the game instead of releasing more killers.  I mean all the killers we have and you end up playing billy, nurse and spirit at low ranks. Of course you can play any killer at low ranks but is it really fun ?
---
Thanks! The doctor is always a fun character to work on :).

Adrenaline/Decisive

Mouse button number 1 is left click, 2 = right click, 3 = middle click.
---
Spine Chill, for obvious reasons, and Urban Evasion, the ability to walk at normal speed while keeping a low profile is absolutely glorious.
---
Uh, doing the middle gens and giving yourself good spacing in the end game is toxic.
---
And killers 3gen camping is toxic.
---
Geez, read the ToS people!!
---
Waiting for Clown to be one
---
With your attitude, every killer will give gigantic audio queues and no killer abilities will limit survivors. That's the big dumb.
---
Eh put in some time over a few weeks and find some more experienced players to teach you the ropes. My tag is assassingod92 if you need some help
---
Who let Spirit loose in this thread, hearing a lotta "Whaaaa" going on here üòè
---
The killers were already made tho. Maybe if we started with the Killer's who countered it and MoM, but with M1 killers coming first, then MoM showing up, it's more like Power Creep.
---
Since MoM came after the killers it's more bad design on MoM.
---
What does Mettle of man do?
---
Welcome to reddit, shitlord. This is how gaming subreddits operate. Go dip your toe in the Overwatch subreddit and come back.
---
Doctor. Super annoying to play against. And I would dance on Laurie‚Äôs grave because she‚Äôs just so damn ugly
---
Mark a certain place with a marker only visible to survivors.
---
Places a holy beam of ascension wherever the user wishes (one time use, can't be changed once it is placed)
---
You don't need to live on the sub to see something that is posted here regularly... That's the point.
---
Happens to me all the time
---
But, slugging... Right?
---
So the counter has to be easy now? There is either a counter or there isn't. You said there was no counter, then listed some of them (you missed make your choice and haunted). Is cleansing not a counter to noed because you have to get all 5 or find it and risk getting one hit? Is bt not a counter to camping because stealth killers can make it not proc?I'm not even saying mettle isn't broken, but it does have counters.
---
No actually
---
This is why I don‚Äôt understand why the male killers so underwhelming. The plague in the PTB could‚Äôve been top 3 killer, but they nerfed the shit out of her. Imo the killers should be super good b/c of how unbalanced swf or even top survivors are in the high ranks
---
Deja Vu and Self Care. The lone wolf, gen rush build.
---
The best thing about Ghostface is the obvious care they put in his animations. I love that he has different ones for walking around, chasing, and night shroud. I hope future killers follow a similar pattern.
---
Popular streamer or not, that's such a stupid outlook for any perk in this game.
---
Surveillance over Discordance imo. If the survivors are paying attention, they'll figure out you have Discordance and split up on gens making it a wasted perk slot. Survivors have to work on gens so knowing when they've stopped a regressing gen is useful information, plus you can hear the gens being worked on from further away. That paired with Monitor and Abuse and combat straps allows you to sneak up a lot easier. Also Brutal Strength pairs well with Surveillance, plus helps get rid of pallets.
---
I can't enter any games on the PTB, as either survivor or killer, and it appears others on the steam forums are having this issue but so far no solution has been found.
---
Respectfully, I 100% disagree. Flashlight saves aren‚Äôt too difficult once you‚Äôve practiced a few times in kyf or actual matches. After that it‚Äôs just practicing positioning to actually get the save. Getting the save in an actual game is definitely not too difficult for a normal player to perform. I have about 800 hours in dead by daylight and flashlight saves, whether done by me or my teammates, have singlehandedly turned a decisive loss into multiple people escaping more times than I could ever count. 
---
This is the video that made me want to become good with the flashlight, as well as taught me how to use it effectively: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pshlJLOeX7k&amp;t=673s
---
Hope this helps.
---
Marry Meg, kill Claudette and befriend Jeff. Killer would be Marry Ghostface(because besides murdering innocent people he seems like a nice guy) befriend Freddy because I don't want to die in my sleep and kill Hillbilly because he seems like he wants to die.
---
I actually think you shouldn't do it, I think you should get all perks on one character at the very least because why would you unlock them for in the first place , people say prestige but if you think about it it's only good for characters with no cosmetics like licensed killers and survivors . Otherwise it's useless according to many players who collected data about rare things being more in P3 bloodwebs . Which means you're paying 1.2 million BP for one piece of an outfit . In the other hand spending that 1.2 million BP on a character to get most perks is good and will give you freedom to play whatever playstyle you want
---
Don't tell these shitheels that.
---
Adrenaline and ds
---
That was nasty.
---
I usually run sloppy butcher over NOED, or whispers but yeah, guilty. They‚Äôre the most consistent/fun perks.

Again, not knocking your skill or questioning why you did it. I respect that it‚Äôs good, but you gotta admit whenever cosplay is on this subreddit it‚Äôs always Legion
---
Maybe not every week, but I've definitely seen this post at least twice recently. That's already too often. It's not as bad as that Feng Min face repost, but let's not let it get to that stage, shall we?
---
i just wanna say that the speedy boi wraith with double windstorm is probably my favourite killer build of all time
---
This. Tyde Time made a great video covering the fastest way to go through a bloodweb when you prestige. If you get good enough RNG you can get through up to 40 levels with a million bp. That's how I unlock teachables and shit on new killers
---
Yea ive been on here since i started playing the game and ive seen the mario luigi thing MAYBE 3 times tops. People like to fucking complain
---
As a killer sometimes you dont have to continue chasing...
---
Wait is this the halloween chapter or the game?
---
Is it bannable? it's kinda hard to say now, since now the end can and actually ended without you having to disconect, but the bodyblocking started way before the EGC. If it started when the EGC started it would have been a good strategy to get at least one kill.
---
Red paintbrush and monitor and abuse Freddy is more fun than spoopy Myers or Amanda‚Äôs letter pig. Don‚Äôt @ me
---
I love this
---
Darn!!!
---
I didn't know that that was the truth.
---
Assuming she is not hurt or missused
---
I would block that person.
---
I wouldn't do it.

Plague. She requires a bit of skill but once mastered she‚Äôs really good.

Clown is good at herding survivors. He is pretty good imo

to be fair your friend must be lacking good sound
---
Smashed a 4 man SWF last night, was told I'm a baby killer. Well if that's true and your rank 6-4 SWF lost to a baby killer, what does it say about you?
---
Well guess I‚Äôll give it as shot what have I got to lose. When I get this I will be the most immersed Claudette who has ever immersed herself in the games history. Nah probs just be a chill killer. Already have the game on ps4 and play mostly killer and have grinded for most of the killers. Want to get it on pc cause why not and really want to see how versing survivors on pc is. Currently working on a juvenile delinquent legion frank for the skin competition as well. Hope I win either competition.

WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF GREATNESS  
---
WE WERE THIS CLOSE
---
I disagree about the Clown bit as Clown may suck ass with gen pressure but he can destroy loops left and right. He isn't that bad or that good but definitely not mediorce I would put him in B tier plus does it matter if he is a little above average and not Great, if you enjoy him that's all that matters and shouldn't worry about what other people say
---
Chased lasted that long because of 5 window vaults and the umpteen flashlights and pallets. Don‚Äôt forget the sabo squad.
---
Well damn! I‚Äôm super jealous!
---
They‚Äôre basically pure rage, and great storytelling vehicles.
---
&gt;I am new to this game
---
Noobs usually aren't that great at looping.  So couple that with Freddy always being able to find you, then you die a lot. Once you know how to loop though, chases will take up a long time and you can escape.
---
Not saying he's bad.
---
This is the type of community dead by daylight is.. you take the time to show some support towards actually fixing the game, and a giant wave of ignorant rank 20 keyboard warriors downvotes and tries to sweep it under the bus as always. Almost like they work for behavior or something. Who's paying you to lie to yourselves? Lmao
---
Well it got him banned, so at least they know it exists now :)
---
Oh. Last time I heard the opposite. Thanks!
---
Sometimes during a match as survivor my bud disappears and i can't see any markers or skill checks.
---
Makes it very hard to play
---
Slightly misleading (at least for me)
---
He aint burger king myers.
---
Which is why I'm such a fan of Devour Hope. It has to be earned, has counterplay, and still has one of the Heart-sink feelings the game has to offer, which is why I originally started loving this game. It's right on par with a Jumpscare for me when I see that  debuff show up as survivor. It still gives that feeling, the ability to see the awesome moris, but doesn't feel unfair IMO (Though not all survivors agree, naturally lol)
---
No, Xbox.
---
He did it, the absolute madman.
---
If I win I'm giving a key to a good friend of mine who's a huge Halloween fan and has shown some interest in this game.
---
to match the other killers hah not super serious on that one
---
Spine chill and probably DS
---
He Accidentally Deleted the Servers.
---
Oops
---
literally "i guide others to a treasure i cannot possess."
---
This is awesome. I want this as a background.
---
I agree. Combine Red Paint Brush with Z-Block (and M&amp;A) and your dream transition is only 3 seconds.
---
I LOVE this build. I'm so sad the rework freddy won't be able to do this (It's confirmed aura reading is gone) because this build is a roller coaster of emotions for the survivors. "Ah it's Freddy so what?" then they realize he's suddenly turned into Mirror Myers 2.0 and can put people to asleep nearly instantly.
---
Spirit is 2nd best killer imo, just hard to use. However if say go with clown, pop goes the weasel is a nice perk (I use it on spirit) and his ability is great for stopping loops.
---
This!! Are you playing killer? For me it won't start a lobby as a killer. Just says "searching for match" even though the killer is meant to just host a match as soon as you click triangle
---
I was talking about hatch King üòâ
---
Shut hatch asap
---
Patrol doors 
---
Stall him as long as possible
---
Better if you get the hook but the entity kill when timer hits zero is still better than them escaping
---
Utilize your killer powers efficiently when stalling
---
That moment your titty so small nobody even noticed it when it was literally in their face.
---
Exactly why I don‚Äôt really use her, ha.
---
Having issues on ps4. When I try to start a lobby as a killer it just says "searching for match" when it should instantly start a lobby and be looking for survivors to fill it with
---
As a nea main I agree heavily
---
Who else was trying to look at Wraith‚Äôs nipples and not the gold statue?
---
Its you pressing and letting go of the button too soon, be slightly more patient and you won't need to double tap.
---
üòÇ
---
Thank you for sharing your beautiful work. Keep up the good work man
---
Same here.
---
Hello there.
---
Think they accidentally did that with Ghostface and his Power.
---
On Xbox one i can‚Äôt join my friend and it says the host is in reachable what do we do?
---
That would be cool. I wish they would too, but at least its fun to make them. Thanks!
---
No you didnt waste the shards, now DS is in your pool of available perks without you having to purchase and level up Laurie. Likewise, Bond is also in your available pool without you having to level up Dwight. 
---
But a free bit of advice: dont buy perks fron the shrine for any of the freely available characters. Save them for DLC perks that you dont intend on buying. 
---
Its no big deal that you bought Bond (its Dwights best perk), but since Dwight is a freely available survivor, you could have also unlocked Bond by just leveling him to lvl 30.
---
When the Devs were making Legion, they legit just put all their effort into Susie and making her hot, instead of making a decent killer. 
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I love a lot of non meta perks but I'd say for killer devour hope. It usually breaks within 2 seconds but if it lasts, getting the insta down and rarely the mori is super fun
---
For survivors I really love alert. It's super underrated and helps you know where the killer is at all times
---
I love the JoJo memes on this reddit :) always nice to see josuke
---
So my mango is to get famous and act like i dont no nobody
---
You know that‚Äôs fun at all, but just remember some of us wanted a real game when they get into a match. I despise farming because it takes the most fun part out of the game.
---
Don‚Äôt mind a good wraithy boi every once in a while tho :)
---
You know she is 16 right? Unless you live in Canada of course.
---
first meh, second one useless, third one super great
---
I haven't played much Nurse or Spirit, but I find spirit dailys a lot harder then nurse dailys so, fair enough
---
The bottom is great though id rather que for another game then play a 3 man game
---
Or the UK, age of consent is 16 here

---
Hatch will only open when 1 survivor is alive (or they use dull/skeleton key). By slugging the third surv, you prevent the hatch from opening and it gives you time to hunt down the last survivor without worrying about them getting the hatch
---
You dare touch my gens? Are you *mad*?

Yes that's what i realised When i watched the clip.

Still shoulda been burger hatch king myers

Hatch king!

Was just about to comment that
---
You are in the clear for now.
---
Noed and mettle need reworks imo. Noed and mettle reward bad plays
---
Mate crotus should be S tier
---
I'll pee in your butt
---
For survivors id be friends with Feng or meg, marry Kate and kill Quentin
---
For killers I'd be friends with the legion members (more specifically Susie and Joey), marry nurse or spirit and kill leatherface
---
The best thing to do is close the hatch. I get that you want the 4K, but there's no chance of getting it unless you close the hatch
---
With madness level 3 causing constant gen explosions hell yeah I am
---
Well what is hard is kinda subjective. Just look at the difficulty of killer ins the game, Doctor is hard, but for me he is very easy. Other killers like Wraith I have a hard time with, cause I lack the experience when it comes to playing him.
---

This is exactly how my Legion looks. Although recently put on the Neon Mask. Absolutely cutie

Or what about the Clapper as in Clap Dem Cheeks Boi
---
End game collapse, that's why after the gates are open I stand in the middle of the map and let them do whatever they want ;) I haven't been teabagged at a gate in who knows how long :)
---
When I see that they‚Äôre overconfident early in the game(ie. they literally follow me to the hook I put their friend on) that‚Äôs when I start to camp hooks.
---
I would probably recommend Meg! Especially if you like getting the Killer's attention, Adrenaline is a Perk that you'll end up wanting sooner rather than later as your chases get longer. Her other two Perks are pretty good too.
---
I never understand the ones running Noed with J Myers Memorial and the yellow add on that increases stalking (forgot the name). It would be better to free up a perk slot.
---
Feed me mommy bird. GG
---
How is that shady?
---
I never Take off my protective helmet that the Pig gives as it helps me not break my skull open when she slashes my back.

Hag for Ruin, Nurse for Nurse‚Äôs Calling, and Legion for Discordance.
---
I will obey lord oink. They are quite quality party hats.
---
Putting your name on something implies you made it.
---
This combined with the lack of credit is shady.
---
I got this game for free on PS+  and I fell in love with it ever since. I even got the platinum for the game. I have started streaming and doing it on PS4 is really not that great. With it on PC, I hope to have a better optimized setup so I can stream my content while also playing with better frames.
---
Yea queuing solo is pretty difficult. I wish that it was like it was meant to be. SWF ruins the game for killers and solo ques. Usually they are mean spirited and only care for themselves. I've had my own discussions where they refer the Solo as "bait".
---
**intense tbagging sounds**
---
Happy cakeday!
---
He made the meme, that's why he watermarked it
---
I was being serious!! Finding a purple flashlight is awesome... yall assume to much..
---
Hey, thanks! With regards to your first question, it's not really my expertise on the project, one of the environment artists, level designers or the art director would be better suited to answer this. I do however know that these guys are all smart people and do think along those lines so it wouldn't surprise me. Making art for games is always a fine balance between gameplay and aesthetic especially when it comes to an A-Symmetrical cat and mouse type game. 
---
For your second question it's a purposeful choice for the artstyle. When dead by daylight first started it used a completely hand painted approach and gave off a watercolor like look. Although this was interesting, it looked somewhat dated and was very time consuming for what we were trying to accomplish. As the project evolved we began  shifting more towards a standard approach used on modern video games, however because this is a live product many older assets have retained the painted look as we have not had the chance to revisit them. With regards to the characters the splotchy almost graphic look was a kind of middle ground that not only kind of established an art style for dead by daylight but also was a way to improve the game without it looking too jarring when played alongside older assets.
---
Someone explain the meme to me pls? Saw it on a Demi vid earlier, and im ootl on this :)
---
One that increases the battery life and one that increases blindness duration or speed of the blind.
---
Dont forget BP farming ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Thanks for the tip! I had no intention of levelling Dwight as I‚Äôm constantly working on Feng. I‚Äôm new to the game so this has helped me for future reference thanks :)
---
Beautiful art, but your title leaves me uncomfortable
---
RNG
---
Yes slug the third and if you have to and you got the advantage let the third wiggle free and follow them. They might lead to the fourth. I play doctor so this is usually a valid strategy. People just think slugging is mean spirited and cheating. It's not. Valif tactic as long as it's for game advantage and you actually benefit from it
---
survivors: friends with Quentin, kill jake and marry David
---
Killers: friends with Legion, kill doctor and marry Plague
---
I have tried so many times. Is it heavily biased?
---
Oh fuck, I‚Äôm an idiot.
---
Putting a white space and words does not give someone the ability to watermark a photo that is not theirs.
---
Decisive Strike and Dead Hard
---
I still can‚Äôt believe this is a thing it‚Äôs so frustrating, I played against a huntress who rage quit in the first 30 seconds because her ruin was destroyed and yet I de piped for it. The devs punish us for playing the game
---
It's RNG. Just remember that there's only a base 4% chance of escaping‚Äî in other words, even with Slippery Meat, chances are you're not getting off. You're much better off using the Perk slot for something else and not trying to escape from hook.
---
The only issue with this power concept is SWF. Facing off against a killer disguised as one of the boys will turn them into an M1 killer with no chance of using their power. This as been a neat concept since right after release but without a fix to SWF for this killer the killer would be almost entirely useless.
---
Ok thanks

How dare you play Leatherface!!! Insta-down with no counterplay smh. You need to stop playing the game, this was supposed to be gen repair simulator 2019, but people like you keep hacking the game to kill us.

You just described a meme, the photo's been used countless time in this sub without people crediting the maker, you know why? Because it's a meme and they're not trying to say that they made the photo
---
So you‚Äôre telling me that the survivor is untouchable? That‚Äôs fucking dumb!
---
Thank you
---
I shot him 6 times, I shot him in the heart!
---
It's only a 4% chance however Aces teachable ups the percent by 3 with each survivor that lives so you get a 13% with the perks however slippery meat basically gives more trys so pairing it with that might help but besides that don't try to unhook yourself
---
As a non nea main I agree
---
Thanks :), the marketting team is working very hard on growing the dead by daylight brand and part of that growth is quality merchandising. There are a lot of cool things that I've seen that are either in the works or they are considering so your wish isn't too far out of the realm of possibility, that's all I'll say on the topic ;).
---
And not a single one of those other posts have thought to include a watermark (because they didn't make the photo)
---
Good idea
---
Big beard big brain
---
Tfw menu crash looks better than real menu
---
Tenacity and Unbreakable... Bill Main with a normal brain
---
Let's get down to business.
---
we need this chest piece
---
Replace streetwise
---
It's an in joke for the character in a lot of the streams I frequent, kinda like how Meyers is Miguel in some of them. I do apologize for making you uncomfortable however.
---
I like how you used the 4 most toxic survivor mains in the picture
---
Self Care. The time you spend healing yourself in the corner, could be spent finishing a gen. Bring a medkit for more efficient healing
---
Yes definitely exhaustion perks are very handy to have
---
Honestly it could be better if you replace streetwise for one dead hard and balanced landing are the beat ones
---
Bro can read, I want BHVR to buff all the shitty killers, that might make slugging disappear, but if not then it definately should in some way.  Bleeding out on the ground fucking sucks.
---
Just, watch No0b3's older videos... *sigh*
---
SCP crossover when?
---
Milf money
---
Get rid of self care, takes you 30 seconds to heal yourself, just bring a med kit. I'd reccomend adrenaline but that's me. Someone better than me might say otherwise
---
This got a Dwight to get me killed because I took ‚Äúhis‚Äù flashlight from the basement box.
---
Kill it with fire
---
Yeah I still need to get that for teachable, but I'll get that eventually.
---
Ultra Rare Item- Metal Locker - Alows you to replace any locker with a metal one- consumed on use
---
Metal lockers are seen be killers as a normal locker- reduce breathing noises by 100%, when getting out of the metal lockers you gain a 200% speed boost for 60 seconds and cannot be hit during this time
---
Okay so with all the comments saying remove streetwise and self care, I'm prolly gonna put balanced landing and/or adrenaline (when I get it)
---
You don't know who I am but I know where you live!
---
Oh lmao, either way it's still makes his power useless.
---
Sniper Puke that cripples people
---
It'd be better if they had blue pants.
---
Oh you are right its still a meme tho
---
No0b3 and Farmer John are some of my favorites. As other people have also said there's Monto, Hybrid Panda, and Demi.
---
Let‚Äôs punish you even more for doing well
---
I'll be the guy that wants to claim this contest prize to give it to a good friend of mine.
---
It's way better. Once the game is done, it's done. I don't give the sore winners the satisfaction :)
---
This.
---
wait is he the hero biker from one punch man
---
Make it stop ,the endless squeaking!! *eats boots*
---
Exactly I‚Äôve had games where killers dc from me 360ing them and losing them and I‚Äôve de pipped it really ruins the experience
---
Great meme, I as a OINK main approve
---
Well again, valid tactic as it is beneficial to the game. You gotta plan around that. It's a survival horror game. If I was playing slugging Billy then as long as I am actually doing my objective I see it as viable. Again, unbreakable, no mither and healing survivors can actively stop that. I've played a slugging Billy once....once. and got my butt handed to me because of unbreakable and helpful survivors. I'd slug and rush to a gen and by the time I downed a new survivor, the last one was up and healed. As I said, if I was playing a slugging cannibal, (fuck that fairy) and I stood over him camping him so no one picks him up. Then i would be in the wrong as it has no beneficial factors for me. This can be said about the following:
---
Camping:
---
-Putting first survivor on hook and facecamping =bad 
---
-Gates open and you camp the survivor on the hook=good
---
Tunneling:
---
Tunneling someone off the hook because you're salty=bad
---
Tunneling obsession to proc dying light=good
---
It kinda blows me away that M&amp;A isn't one of the top 5 used killer perks
---
No. Never will I agree to play by someone else's rules. First of all I just have to find that last totem since I already broke four. Secondly survival is only worth the same amount pip wise as the I just saved your ass. 
---
Play to have fun, risk it all, challenge yourself. God forbid you don't play it safe with a full meta loadout and red tools.
---
I have never seen this community agree on anything. Ask them if: "the sky is blue" go ahead see what you get.
---
They're not trying to take credit for the photo! Do you not understand? They watermarked so that the meme doesn't get reposted by someone else.
---
I never remove them :) but amanda only gifted me one...
---
As a Legion main I agree
---
I swear there are assholes that simply run up on purporse to the killer to do this.
---
I shall take my dislikes with pride.
---
I'ma be honest, I misunderstood the title and I was looking for Wraith's nipples.
---
I'm very disappointed.
---
Who knew my mask of shame from last year would become en vogue.
---
Love it when I "hit" a chainsaw as Billy but nothing happens because they moved in *juuuust* the right way
---
I have so much respect for clauddets who have flashlights but don't tea bag me at every pallet and flash light click me
---
Yeah, pretty much every game I've had when there's a 3 man (or a duo if me or the other guy dies) I get used to do gens then they escape (if they have a key) or don't open the gates. If i'm in a chase they don't do gens at all and hide in bushes or a corner of the map
---
Still remember this one Adam who I found and hooked just for him to unhook himself with Deliverance and teabag me at the hook. I down him again and he DSes me and continues teabagging me.
---
I mean okay? You're now in struggle phase and spent about 15 seconds of my time to BM? Why do I care?
---
It depends on how good you want to become. In my opinion, huntress has the highest skill cap. Second is billy without spirit fury that knows how to curve at loops (it‚Äôs really hard). 3rd maybe hag/nurse/spirit. But that‚Äôs just for me
---
They don't want their captions reposted after they took someone else's photo without crediting? And sticking their name on said photo?
---
I don't get it, how is being popular an argument for unbalanced?
---
A perk called Deliverance is the only way to guarantee a hook escape, and it has a few conditions. Otherwise it‚Äôs a really small chance and you‚Äôre almost always better off just waiting to be rescued.
---
I'd like to see Pinhead and Art the Clown!
---
Pig because they all tunnel like crazy and new because she looks like shit and sounds like a disappointed lesbian.
---
That is disgustingly hot
---
Good job OP you made me really uncomfortable take my arrow
---
A BRILLIANT CONFLUENCE OF LUCK AND PURPOSE !
---
It‚Äôs a different experience for both sides. It‚Äôs an asymmetric game, both sides are essentially playing two different games. It‚Äôs like saying Tetris is harder than chess.
---
That would make it underpowered.
---
Unpopular opinion: spirit is one of the easiest killers to play
---
Her "mindgames" arent mindgames. You just phase walk and listen to footsteps and moans. This is the only killer where you can stand still and "outplay" people
---
maybe a timing issue? latency?
---
You're absolutely right. That's obviously why I asked. Thank you everyone for letting me know all of this information. I will now use Adrenaline all the time. Got any information about why OoO is good? It reveals your location to the killer? I know some people use it as their main perk. Mind telling me why?
---
Nea's a Killer
---
Legion bad
---
Freddy says darn
---
Give me Reddit key-to-the-world plz I very funny
---
Monto, The King, TydeTime, and Tru3Ta1ent
---
because it's useful
---
This is more of my playstyle but;
---
Replace streetwise with Lithe or Balanced. Both are great though balanced is usually better because of the faster recovery from falling. Streetwise is getting a buff in the PTB to 35% or so but regardless its still a weak perk unless you are bringing a commodious toolbox with duration add-ons.
---
Replace Urban Evasion with Borrowed time. Allows you to make risky saves and get points for it. Great altruistic perk that will go a long way to helping your teammates. If you want to keep urban then I would switch it Empathy out for borrowed time.  
---
Unless you have adrenaline then I keeping self-care is alright. Self-care is still a decent perk but using bond or adrenaline will do alot more for you. Self-care will probably become more popular when the Freddy Rework comes out so maybe then you could add it back to your survivor build.
---
I thought it said ingame somewhere that after Billy escaped he ran around the farm slaughtering wildlife for a few years before the Entity got him.
---
It's more stressful since your on your own while as surv it's a team effort and not as stressful
---
No I agree with him. Foundamentally killer is harder because you are alone and have to watch over 4 people, while they can watch their backs.
---
josuke best jojo
---
Killer: the thing is Meg, ur playing 3D chess, I‚Äôm playing 4d chess. Meg: I‚Äôm playing checkers, I don‚Äôt know wtf ur playing
---
I literally am laughing my ass off. Thank you!
---
Well thats good to hear
---
Exactly, this is as bad as hiding in lockers. A interesting and cool idea sure but good? No. It has potential to be worst then Ghostface and that‚Äôs saying something.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say mettle rewards bad players... it more punishes you for playing m1 killers, which is bs
---
My green Mori would like a word with you
---
What did that old man ever do to you?

And then block the boxes by crouching in front of it, watch them suffer and die

---
Why he is op right now.
---
Quick and Quiet
---
Borrowed time üòÅ
---
he's someone else i also enjoy watching :)
---
That‚Äôs an odd way of spelling Joseph
---
You can‚Äôt really buff his power. It‚Äôs just bad design.
---
What buff is it getting?
---
surveillance
---
What are these splinters? I‚Äôve never seen them before
---
*7 generators
---
Still agree for the most part
---
I already ha cannibal as i said in the post. So i should go for hillbilly. I thought i should go for to get aggitation for bubbas basement build
---
They let you control a dlc killer for one round to try it out
---
&gt;I have never seen this community agree on anything.
---
\*clears throat\*
---
*Shirtless Myers.*
---
That would explain why I‚Äôve never seen them. I have most of the dlc
---
As a meg main I agree
---
None for survivor as I often switch up perks to keep things fresh
---
Killer, prob bbq
---
I love this! Is this the Water Goat worshipper skin? If not, you need to enter this in the contest going on for skin ideas.
---
Dude don't jinx it
---
I'd switch out deliverance for sc if you're totally focused on survival. Deliverance in itself is very situational and you'd probably get a lot more benefit having sc at your disposal. (Not to mention deliverance won't help you if you're the last survivor and it prevents someone from getting altruism points)
---
its real p3 kate hours
---
Bbq n Chili and Ruin are imbalanced. I mean I see them all the time so it must be true.
---
Love it
---
Jeff? Nobody mains jeff
---
Why not just leave it in your inventory then? It‚Äôs not like we have limited space
---
It is one of her existing outfits! I might make a unique outfit for her one day but as a one and done for my killer series I try to keep it to existing outfits. :D Thank you for your kind words!
---
i cannot decline a jojo post.
---
Why the fuck would they care that someone reposts their meme? Watermarking a shitty, lazy meme like you're so proud of the hard work it took to add a blank space and some text in Paint is kind of pathetic.
---
Nancy wouldn't even pass a glance at John Redcorn if she was with Ace Gribble.
---
I love that mask! ^_^
---
Insta heal bottles or syringes on medkits. Killer aura reading on keys, and brand new parts on toolboxes.
---
Yellow mori: can kill last survivor
---
Green mori: can kill one survivor whose been hooked.
---
Ref mori: can kill any survivor whose been hooked
---
When will this unfunny meme die?
---
There‚Äôs also white lines telling you the direction they saw you from
---
I see a lot of people do this. Seems like once one person goes they all follow.
---
Rock me, Nostradamus.
---
Mama Bun Bun uwu
---
Hag is one of the strongest killers when used properly.
---
Because they might get more upvotes than them, it's happened to me before and it happens to other people too
---
yes and happy cake day!
---
Blendette - just a pain, and trying to find someone that you can‚Äôt see is boring lol
---
Doc - super boring to play against
---
Does that mean Ruin isn‚Äôt balanced because it‚Äôs one of the most popular Killer perks? I never use Adrenaline when I play Survivor anyway and i‚Äôm rank 4.
---
thanks :)
---
They don't need to credit the person that made the photo, it's a meme, imagine if everyone had to credit the person who made the "me and the boys" picture
---
I mean survivors have to rely on each other to win. Most of the time you have at least a few paint easting teamates
---
Agreeing. There‚Äôs no argument. If you‚Äôre bad a survivor, other survivors can easily carry you. If you are bad as a killer, you lose.
---
Can agree 100%.
---
This is what sets you guys apart from other developers. You're highly engaged with the community and that's fucking awesome.
---
OI JOSUKE
---
You need one exhaustion perk. So yes, get an exhaustion perk.
---
Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, and Left Behind are his unique perks. They are just normal perks and not teachables on console though.
---
Hey does, but on consoles they are like the common perks every survivor has. Like spine chill. Bills perks are left behind, unbreakable and borrowed time
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a hard life playing killer. If you don‚Äôt have ruin 2 or 3 generators are completed in the first minute
---
The real problem is the lobby dodging, yesterday it took me 30m to actually get in a game because killers dodge if someone brings an item :/
---
Addons are the passives for their power.
---
Ok. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Replace streetwise with balanced landing, and never ever don't run balanced landing again. The very best exhaustion perk in the game.
---
I play Wriath and have activated MoM early game many times. Its annoying but just hit em one more time. Takes skill to evade the killer a couple times so you dont immediately activate it.
---
They extremely can. They could remove the sight stuff and it's still just a weaker version of Evil Within. You get 20 seconds on 1 person and you have to stalk them specifically a full 4 seconds in pretty much one go. It has a lot of room to improve without overtaking a power that already exists.
---
Tier 3 EW is 60 seconds of exposed on the entire team, and it's only an extra second plus it doesn't drain down so you're free to build and hold it as you need. Plus you can build your meter on anyone.
---
Yup the stress is real on the killers side.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be sure to remember that this is officially an ‚ÄòEvalinco‚Äô branded meme.
---
No one is allowed to repost this meme about sexy Myers or they‚Äôre gonna get major shit
---
/s
---
Big true
---
Honestly?  Yeah.  If you fall for an insidious basement hookcamp, thats on you as a survivor.  Its a good tactic.  
---
(This is said as a survivor main)
---
It's not that the meme is a branded meme, it's that OP put his name on the photo as if he made it.
---
2x BP June 14th-18th
---
Nah, the foods to cold to eat lol
---
Camping and hex ruin make the game so fucking boring.
---
AfuckingMen. I have played this game for 5 days maining killer. 5 days. That‚Äôs all it took for me to sour on the community. I tried to play by the ‚Äúrules‚Äù  I got tbagged and sent messages like ggez. So now I don‚Äôt play by the ‚Äúrules‚Äù So to all those toxic survivors out there just know that by acting like a POS you create what you hate.
---
He didn't make the photo. 
---
This discussion is going nowhere, we clearly cannot convince one another.
---
There was a post like this yesterday. I wanted my heart out about the subject. If u wanna see it u can just visit my page and go view it. U might get some insight on what ur posting about
---
Killers mains in game vs. killers mains in this sub

---
He's not trying to take credit for the photo like I've said many times
---
Iron will can come in clutch and is a great perk overall that can end up saving your life, combining it with balanced landing can make for a great escape.
---
I was considering leveling jake up for iron will, do you think it's worth it?
---
I've had 4 games back to back where survivors DC because they lose a chase, I remember pre-legion when people really didn't DC that often
---
You lost me at ‚Äúkiller didn‚Äôt let me escape‚Äù. His job is to kill you. Your shitty teammates aren‚Äôt his responsibility. So queue absolutely sucks, but there‚Äôs not a lot they can do about it. The camping though, that pisses me off so much.
---
If anybody is a better artist I would love if they could submit a similar skin in the contest. You can have and would deserve all the credit
---
It is stressful when your teammates are getting hooked in 15 seconds flat, killer tunnels, teammates fuck up on the gen, etc
---
I know this is a weird concept but *upvotes aren't worth shit.* If you watermark your shitty memes out of fear that someone might *steal your upvotes*, you are a *sad, pathetic human being*.
---
I think it‚Äôs ridiculous either way, but whatever makes them feel better about themselves
---
yeah everyone seems to say deliverence isn't that great of a choice, kind of regret leveling adam now since I only did it for that perk thinking it would be the best for solo play.
---
I agree with most of it, but if you say it's ok then end up with "guys just play to have fun" I can't take you seriously. There's no fun in dying 2 min after the game started because you got tunneled like hell.
---
I meant just like base line. Because my belif is that killers shouldnt need add ons to be useful, they should work more like Myers add ons where they change how they play or help in small boosts. 
---
For instance what i mean by passive is like: Wrath can see Blood and Scrath marks easier and has a higher FoV then other killers.
---
Perfectly put sir
---
Is this?
---
But mew dont need add ons for their power to be useful. When have mew ever seen someone need add ons to play if they know what they're doing (ignoring Freddy). Yes maybe something tiny could be interesting, but add ons are in no way required to do good as a killer
---
Forgot it got buffed but yeah he's gonna be one terrifying killer once the rework comes
---
Yeah but at least from my experience that doesn't happen often
---
In that case you can definitely get more use outta something else. For me I seem to get farmed by teammates and tunneled a lot so I get good use out of it.
---
When is the rework releasing?
---
I mean, BBQ and Ruin are the most popular killer perks, but none of them is unbalanced.
---
Popularity doesn't decide how balanced a perk is.
---
They made her look attractive then stuck a mask on her face.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
We don‚Äôt know the cool down, how long it‚Äôll end up taking, and the survivor gets a warning (unless you use an ultra rare)
---
Ya but how did it get it‚Äôs name, if that‚Äôs the case.  Kinda random
---
Well the thing with camping is yes it's a strategy woohoo. But the actual problem with it isn't the killers problem cause if they had a problem with it they wouldn't do it. Now survivors on another hand is a different picture, no survivor in their right mind wants to sit on a hook and not be rescued all game, it's not fun, and it's extremely unfair to the survivor. They waste offerings, they waste items, they waste time and it's all cause the killer wants to be a dick and stare them down even if the survivor wasn't being a toxic cunt. This isn't mentioning that whoever is on the hook can also kill themselves and d/c. And no, not every survivor wants to "take one for the team" as u said, most ppl play dbd to have fun and I'm sorry to say, nobody has fun hanging from a hook all game.
---
Tunneling is in the same boat, killers might see it as an easy and fast kill but it's right there with camping. As soon as the survivor gets off of hook they get downed/chased again not having a chance to actually do something, that is unless they are lucky and somehow escape/hide but even then a lot of tunnellers see the same person 20min later and chase them even if they already injured another survivor, it's dumb and not fun for the survivor. One might say "the killer is taking their time to play and be more hands on with the survivor" but the survivors usually don't see it that way. All Tunneling is, is a lighter version of camping it just gives the survivor a slightly better time at playing.. slightly.
---
Slugging in all rights is dumb asf. I remember the last time I ran into a slugging Nurse and Everytime someone got up she would teleport and redown them thanks to nurses calling causing everyone to d/c. Point of the game is to hook survivors not make them rage quit from a toxic way of playing.
---
Perks, eh yea perks can be annoying and some need nerfs, some need buffs and some are fine. I don't really think ppl have a problem with the perks themselves but I do think ppl get tired of seeing the same ones repeatedly (Meta perks on both sides) very rarely will u see a survivor or killer use less than two meta perks, like someone said in a different post, it just feels like the same games over and over with different ppl, we need variety. As for me I just think ppl are too scared to shy away from meta perks in the event that they lose instead of coming up with different loadouts and strategies.
---
That's my opinion and I hope u at least understand where I'm coming from
---
Being a solo survivor is full of surprises. You never know if the killer is going to be the actual killer, or your mates.
---
bleeding out survivors is taking a game hostage? taking a game hostage is when you trap them in a corner. they die if you slug them thats no hostage situation.
---
I mean I agree with most of that, but Im talking about slugging without being in SWF, which makes it hard to play against.  Also stop bringing up No Mither üòÇ, if you see that shit in game you wont slug the person its so obvious.  If you did slug them you a trisomie homie
---
Mumen rider gang
---
Replace Streetwise. And put Adrenaline instead of Self Care.
---
*sweater boi* says darn
---
There really wasn't.
---
Lol ur welcome and ur fine, I don't mind to see posts about the same thing but other Reddit users might troll u or be asses about it. Which I don't get considering 60% of this subreddit is memes about the same thing over and over again just with different pictures lol
---
I personally believe it should just remove the stalk  meter of the survivor that spotted him and not kick him out of stealth and I don't get how people think removing the spotting feature will make him balanced as he would become a 1 shot god. sure it may be 20 seconds but if you have stupid teammates(aka 70% of survivors) then have fun lol.
---
Don't know
---
Oink Time
---
Ooooh, so this is why I randomly change direction when I try to hit someone in the corn and I fail.
---
Oh ok rip, nothing you can do about that
---
Once you hit like rank 6, 4/5 survivors run the meta load outs. DS, MoM, Adrenaline and Dead Hard, or Self Care, depending on which they fancy. I'm at rank 4 now and running my own builds but I find myself having a much tougher time than people with meta perks, because once the last gen is done, I see 3 people have adrenaline set off and I don't have it. When I get hooked in EGC and escape, I can't DS either, and if someone doesn't take hit for me I can't Dead Hard out of a hit.
---
I play immersed so I run an exhaustion perk, self care, spine chill and one other perk depending on which character I play, I mostly play Jane or Dwight. Poised for Jane, Quick and Quiet for Dwight.
---
I am a Jeff main ~~cause he‚Äôs the hottest to me~~ bruh
---
If you don't learn to oink, then all you get is survivors making you "eep" with pallets.
---
Fucking steaming hot
---
Is this.....
---
.....loss? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I don‚Äôt know this is a option but if I win I would like to give it to my friend and I have a nice story
---
Once when I was playing trapper I had a lot of farming games(during the hallowed blight), I was farming and during the farm I had a evil plan what if I try to kill him now(there was only 1 person who knew that I was farming). So I did and not even 2 seconds after I killed him I get a hate comment on my steam account. It was written in (I would say) Russian and then he also posted a translated version and that was funny. The message was you stupid killer why would you  signal a farm if you are gonna kill us, I hope you die in hell. And then I deleted the messages because I don‚Äôt want hate comments on my profile. That was my dbd story.
---
NOED is the counter to adrenaline, as long as that exists. NOED is perfectly fine, plus. Small game is the most satisfying perk because of it
---
"Im a survivor main" Ok.
---
Well again its the player base. If a Killer is doing it out of salt then I personally don't agree with it. If a killer sees them and chases them then its whatever. I got called a tunneler when i see an unhook, walk back to check. Look around and the guy is healing in the corner. If you even look in the unhookeds direction you get called a tunneler.
---
I know BL used to be the worst exhaustion perk, but I see a ton of people running it now. Genuinely curious, what makes it so good now?
---
 If it tells you there‚Äôs NOED before you recover it‚Äôs fine. But killers can just wait around with late game perks and get outplayed and just whip out old reliable and get at least kill. If there‚Äôs a prompt or maybe you have to down someone and then it starts without a totem, but as of now it‚Äôs a unfair cop out
---
Legion‚Äôs lunge is boosted in Frenzy. The difference between BHVR‚Äôs Legion is obviously Deep Wounds, no build up thing, and the design includes multiple killers. Don‚Äôt you get it? BHVR used this killer as a starting base and wanted a way to include the BT status effect in the killer. There‚Äôs differences but it is clear that BHVR uses killer ideas from this subreddit.
---
And those said teammates get a free win without doing  anything
---
I really wish there was a hug option sometimes.
---
Happy cake day and glad you agree
---
Don't tell me what I want for my last meal!
---
Honestly this movie dissapointed me at the end.
---
NOED is a bad perk with multiple counters that only has two uses of needing a full endgame build to do anything.
---
 Or counter to adrenaline.
---
Otherwise? You'll be lucky to get one at that point against anyone worth their salt. 
---
Also no, you just need to get hit for it to activate and as long as you're saved at least twice from hook. It will always activate.
---
 So unless the killer avoids you entirely. It WILL activate
---
I do see where you are coming from. I can agree with some of it. But again its playerbase. If I was salty with you and face camped you, yes that's pretty shitty on my end. If I see you healing after coming to check what a sound was, then how am i am I a tunneler. What if you're obsession and have dying light? If any action has a benefit then I see it as viable. If it has no use then it's stupid but allowed by devs usually.
---
I try to change it up so I don't become reliant on perks. Sometimes I will run no perks to test my self.
---
That‚Äôs how you win as survivor just hide and your teammates will run in circles and do skill checks for you
---
I imagine that it's kept between BHVR and the Offender for confidentiality. 
---
This is an assumption based on how BHVR's punishment for cheaters or exploiters has remained relatively ambiguous.
---
BrickyOrchid8 is that you
---
Happy Reddit Bday ZombieHuggerr(love your memes) also I believe you do as I saw post about it saying they've been banned
---
This is fucking horrifying
---
I think it's balanced but a very strong meta pick. I'll admit it's extremely frustrating when a perfectly timed adrenaline pops after I down someone. 
---
Coming from a Killer main. IMHO survivors need more useful perks so there's more build variety. 
---
I think NOED is cheesy but the only tweak I'd give it is making Small Game come with a totem counter. NOED shouldn't be removed or nerfed directly but by making Small Game have a totem counter it'd be a good perk for NOED counterplay and make it used more often. 
---
The only survivor perk I think is BS is current Mettle Of Man. M1 killers have no counterplay to it besides tunnel off the hook with a Mori or facecamp. Or Rancor and ignoring them all game only to One-Punch Mori them at the end. `
---
Why do you think Adrenaline is unbalanced?
---
I was never notified when a player I reported got banned ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Just follow their profile and check every once in a while. I don't know if temp bans go on steam profiles though
---
Oof. This game is rough sometimes. Sometimes the survivors are worse than the killer. I‚Äôve had some pretty terrible games lately, too.
---
Yooo this is actually Sick
---
I like Hex:Buried Alive but I hate Dead Memory. Dead Memory would encourage tunneling and I hate that playstyle.
---
Kill the fat lady? Wtf
---
In one point, it makes sense to keep it confidential, but it can be very discouraging to hear nothing back if you've sent multiple tickets. This can lead players to believe BHVR is doing nothing, only further discouraging the use of Support. ^(that was their plan all along!)
---
I believe you are notified, but they don‚Äôt say who got banned. Never happened to me tho.
---
All day. :( it‚Äôs a damn lobby simulator at this point.
---
Well honestly I'm not talking about the things that are the survivors fault like healing in front of killer or a perk dying light. I'm talking about tunneling like, let's say I get unhooked and the killer is in the middle of chasing someone that's injured and already used dead hard. As soon as I get unhooked the killer stops chasing said survivor and comes straight back to me even if other ppl attempt to take hits and distract the killer so I can get away. That's what I mean by tunneling. There's a lot of killers like that out there.
---
Stop being soft
---
Alert. Is very underrated if you ask me.
---
I started back when spirit was released and I‚Äôve managed to 7/18 survivors maxed (not prestiged) it‚Äôs definitely a grind.
---
I swear man im tired of hearing "This Killer isnt fun to play against." Saying thqt shit gets things nerfed.
---
Absolute Unit goes to Jail because he thought Finger Licking Good was literal
---
üòçüòçüòçüòç
---
Yes it's absolutely fun to be spotted once in a game and never get to play again. It's a game, it ain't against the rules but would it kill you as a killer to not be so sweaty? It's not like you don't get shit for not tunnelling, you can hit the survivor performing the hook rescue, chase, down, and hook as well. That way everyone gets to actually play the game and have fun.
---
&gt; Camping: yes it sucks to be camped but you might as well as bring a tent and some marshmallows. If the killer is camping then your team is free to so gens. Easy. You're taking one for the team.
---
Cool story, but I still don't actually get to play the game, I lose rank, and I get no blood points. What comfort is it supposed to be to the hooked person that other survivors are free to do gens?
---
&gt; Tunneling: You can toss this out the window in my book. Its stupid that people came up with this. The main goal is to kill survivors.
---
Yes, your goal is to *kill survivors*, not *ruin one person's game while mostly ignoring everyone else*. That's what tunneling is.
---
When I play killer, I don't camp or tunnel. When I play survivor, I don't play with a 4-person SWF to troll the killer. Both of these are unsportsmanlike ways to play IMO. The fact that camping is also strategically stupid doesn't negate the fact that it's mean, it just makes it more galling.
---
This is AMAZING!!!
---
Even something as simple as what Overwatch does where you get a simple popup on launching the game would be satisfactory, to be honest. At least then you'd know that your efforts collecting evidence did not go to waste.
---
I actually found some matches today, was so happy but the killer ended up DCing in two of the games I played, the third one I got stuck in a tree and couldn't move, and it ended up getting everyone killed including myself üòÇ then the last game I got in the killer was lag switching. I don't think I've ever had worse luck on that game lol
---
Oh I agree that's shitty. Still a viable option but pretty shitty. I dont do such but it's a tactic. And I agree it sucks. But it's not in the rules I cannot do that. People just hate being the subject of that and made a term for it to bitch people out and then others extent it to circumstances that dont really apply.
---
Good I shouldn‚Äôt have someone able to one shot a group of 4 his chainsaw should have a player limit before he runs out if you spawn all together and he rushes and chainsaws you can have a less than minute long game Freddy isn‚Äôt fun just cause his power is just a time waster
---
Nah, just his evil clone
---
I've already mentioned why I don't agree for reasons beyond that. Also, are you sure their lunge is boosted? Because I'm pretty sure the killer lunges are standardised, and I can't find anything after searching around that states they have a longer lunge in FF. Nor does the power description state that it gives longer lunges.
---
Lets you play a licensed character you don't have for one game without perks or addons
---
No, NOED can be stopped before it even began in the first place. And even when it does avicatrd it can be avoided entirely, unless the killer is camping gates.
---
 Of which then go find NOED. So he can't do shit.
---
NOED is fine, and IF he's running an endgame build that is the only time when it really isn't a detriment to him. Not to mention NOEDs only real valid use outside of endgame builds is countering adrenaline.
---
 NOED is fair and balanced, it has multiple counters and is easy to stop.
---
Huntress is the hardest killer to master, because she needs everything : aim, timing, prediction, unpredictability, knowledge of the map and hit boxes, and yet, most of the maps still screw her over.
---
Spirit is hard ( at least against people with Iron Will or if sounds are broken ), she also needs sometimes prediction or unpredictability or just to read properly survivors jukes, but still, Huntress is harder than her or Nurse, but she isn't as rewarding as these 2.
---
I‚Äôve honestly never had a ‚Äúgood‚Äù bubba match Freddy is better but it‚Äôs more memer killers with Freddy
---
I've seen a few scattered posts of the person seeing the message that they themselves were banned, but I'd like to know if the sender gets any kind of heads up.
---
Well yea, i dont mean anything massive.
---
I agree. If I‚Äôm being camped, I atleast try to stay alive as long as possible, because as long as the killer‚Äôs camping me, he‚Äôs not chasing anyone.
---
Bubbas don‚Äôt waist time I‚Äôve never once had a bubba who didn‚Äôt try to insta down the first couple of seconds they could it might be different in other regions but it ruins my enjoyment of survivor matches, and I play a decent amount of killer I just prefer survivor
---
But were these rules set but the professionals or those who only play the game? Now if I made a rule saying "you cant hide by a hook to unhook your friend or you're a camper" is that my rule to be taken seriously or the devs rule to ban you with?
---
You got me there, I still feel like there is some sort of way to manipulate his ability that people aren't fully utilizing though
---
Part of what you might be noticing is that now lobbies don't get filled until the matchmaking service has a full group of 4 to put in your lobby.
---
I wait a minute, and holy hell the amount of salt I've gotten
---
So the only way to harass them is create such terms to make them feel bad. Honestly if I get called a term I just blow it off. I'm playing a game and I'll only follow rule set by the devs
---
Once I had the campfire in front of the title screen, it looked so cool
---
nea is pretty ugly though
---
This would make me love ace instead of hating him
---
I want to see facecamping Freddy
---
4/5 games I play, and this is at purple ranks, I just reached red ranks and it's hella hard to find any games at all, but at purple ranks, once killer hooks 1 survivor, the game is over. Because you'll have someone possibly close by who's crouched and waiting to save, you'll have 1 or if you're lucky, 2 survivors wondering if anyone is going for rescue and slowly and cautiously moving toward hook. no one does gens, that's all I know. Unless you're in SWF with a designated gen jockey, or if all 4 players are strong loopers that loop for 4-5 gens, no one's getting out.
---
Strider, surveillance or small game
---
I'd love a copy to give to a friend. We're one person away from a full party, and I know they've been wanting to give it a shot for a while.
---
I‚Äôve actually had a few using the items to shorten the transition so they could pull you off or get a free swipe
---
Well with that logic I suppose every game I play is swf
---
I only ever do that if my DS is active for like ten seconds longer and i'm going to be hooked again if I don't use it.
---
This type of argument comes up for literally every multiplayer game. "everyone's picking the same heroes/champions" "everyone's using the same gun" "everyone is just spamming hadouken" 
---
Every game has its own tier list of what's good and what isn't, that's just the basis of life. Would you rather take a gun to war or a stick? I'll go with the gun every time.
---
Same goes for DBD; do you want to bring perks that give you the best chance of winning or perks that are pretty good but are not on the same level as the others? Again, I want to bring the perks that give me the best chance of winning. People like to win.
---
I'm not saying I'm in favour of it or I support it, it's just good strategy.
---
[LFG sub](https://nm.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/)  
---
Might want to add which region you're in.
---
I gurantee alot of the good killers have already tried it. Tru3Talent one of the people that always say "give it time guys" and "wait I gurantee I'm just playing them wrong" said on stream Ghostface is terrible and he is the type of guy to try everything to make a killer good or decent. I just think Ghostface is fundamentally flawed no matter what they do he'll either be really fucking strong or really ass, I gurantee they could find some sort of balance but he'll still be mediorce at best.
---
It's called a "shiv", "shank" is the action you perform with the shiv.
---
Just an fyi.
---
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Wow... imagine how many dislikes this would have gotten if it was a real perk üòÇüòÇüòÇ Survivor mains are so protective of their meta.
---
They are working on several things for him before he is released to everyone, no worries
---
Be respectful, always spam, "That'll do, Pig.  That'll do." in chat
---
I would say replace streetwise, but since it's getting buffed soon, I would say dump self-care.
---
They have less bloodpoints than they earned in the match, and they're saying they already had 6k

You can't go wrong with the classics.

Hasn't this meme been used on this format like a week ago?

I‚Äôm always amused by ppl who DC against Bubba

It's funny how many SWF players use the argument "what, are you afraid of a challenge?" When that same logic can be applied to them. 
---
What if I want to just play the game and not be a bloodpoint generator and  amusement for the other team to poke fun at? I dont always want to play Billy or spirit (ps4 player so nurse is sadly not an option)

Also, joining a SWF on ps4 is ridiculously easy.

---
Wrong it's all about the Clowns stomach.
---
Once killers know you have dead hard, they simply wait until you use it and get you down anyways. You can watch any of the top YouTubers playing DBD, and they all do that same strategy. Dead Hard is useless once killers know you have it.
---
Balanced Landing works infinitely the entire game. You can constantly jump from buildings, even if it's on CD, and still get the same reduced recovery time. This works really well in a lot of maps because most of them tend to have a place where you can jump off and loop it again, such as the Game map. Even in maps where there are no buildings but only tractors, you can still jump off the ramp and get a speed boost to go to the next pallet loop.
---
Balanced Landing is an amazing perk. I value it much higher than DH
---
They‚Äôre toxic assholes so fuck them lmao. I played against them before.
---
I have like 50 smoking splinters and a few glas splinters now. It's ridiculous how often I get them.
---
Insidious and surveillance... Jk, bbq and nurses
---
Well reddit won‚Äôt let me post my meme but I try not to DC I just go down the bob route ‚ÄúFine but I‚Äôm gonna complain the whole time‚Äù
---
Lol thanks. I'm just trying to explain how players have made up rules and terms to discourage playstyles and more toxic players twist and turn these to harass others.
---
I get to post this for the next killer.
---
No killer in the history of slasher films has fallen down more flights of stairs than Ghostface.  Literally within the first five seconds of seeing his face for the first time in the entire series, he's getting his clock cleaned by Drew Barrymore
---
Poor Ghosty :(
---
Dude when shit happens shit happens I admit it was dumb but it happened
---
Like i said. Y'all have bigger problems
---
Freddy: "Seven seconds?! Where the fuck does that come from?!"
---
Entity: "DUDE, DON'T YELL AT ME, I DON'T MAKE THE RULES, I JUST EAT THE SURVIVORS, DAMN"
---
Lucky boy, i wait 10m for a game
---
You mean "ruins"? It depends. If survivors are smart and semi capable, it ruins the game for killer, because the result will be 1 kill and de-pip. But if survivors are not smart... well, then the game will be ruined for them regardless.
---
Do not take Q&amp;Q with it. It's not nearly as good as people say.
---
Lithe + dwm is definitely in the best perk build in the game.
---
The possibility of a less than 5 minute game shouldn‚Äôt be a factor on a single ability we fucked up but that shouldn‚Äôt have ended the game that fast
---
Nobody wants to leave a man behind, so it results in lots of injured people
---
Play survivor then. Try not getting stressed when Michael tiers up on you, when spirit pulls you off a gen with prayer beads, when bing bong boy pulls up with coxcomb clapper, or legion is using iridescent button.
---
I'm rank 9 and I face them all the time
---
I've gotten to a point where I'm getting matched against some really good survivors and I've had to abandon some of my favorite killers for Billy. I've built him to counter groups in voice chat. Partly because I can run him without relying on Ruin to stall the first 30 seconds of a game.
---
Right now I'm happy with my build of: BBQ to keep pressure after a hook. Also discourages "camping", Enduring and Spirit Fury to counter pallets, and Whispers is amazing to start an early chase and let's be honest, Whispers can guarantee a 4k if you get a 3k. The only chance the last survivor has is finding the hatch before the killer does because whispers tells you what gate they are trying to open.
---
If its 4 solos or 2 2-man groups I'll play for fun more than to win, the Doc, Freddy and Wraith are all more fun than Billy but will lose more also
---
&gt; Nobody wants to leave a man behind
---
Not a smart thing to do against camper.
---
Im currently rank 11 and havent seen one in over a week.
---
Been wanting to play this on PC for a while. You're doing the Entity's work.
---
Well you're lucky as hell
---
You can get this on wish for $7 already.
---
It should if yall play dumb. I dont see your point you messed up. Why do you feel a power should be nerfed because of it?
---
Imagine how the scene in this picture smells
---
Definite Bond on Survivor. Balanced Landing is probably my second though I run We‚Äôll Make It a lot as well. 
---
Killers, I have to say the obvious BBQ though the second depends on the killer. I do love me some Whispers though on my Piggy and Spirit.
---
Definitely not a rule, just a thing to consider.
---
But for me the optimal would be to end the game as fast as possible to hopefully get normal game next. I guess, I'm a tryhard too
---
Survivor is harder then killer.
---
Survivors: dealing with bad / actively sabotaging teammates, trying to escape / mind game a killer who gets to decide if they want to chase you, trying to complete all 5 gens before the killers hooks the others because they don't know how to not get caught.
---
Killer: run around m1'ing survivors who are on spots that are highlighted on the killers screen.
---
Any questions?
---
I can do the same thing and downplay difficulties that the other side faces. Dead by Daylight is by design an asymmetrical game which means that both sides have different challenges that they must face to win. You can't just look from one perspective and expect to understand everybody.
---
Killer can completely stomp the survivors and then gets to the last one an then hatch spawns and boom they escape because of the hatch.
---
See, there's similar things on both sides, it's just survivors don't have to spend a perk slot for theirs.
---
The plague
---
It should be fine now imo, as they have to earn it
---
The killer can negate that. Find the hatch first and close it. But if your the first Noed hit there‚Äôs no way on getting out
---
I guess. But still you should get mad at them since it is personal preferrence how to play as a killer. Even tho it still sucks to play against
---
Make the perks a point-buy system, and every has a limit to the number of points their build can use. Give Ranked a very strict limit, and Unranked a soft cap/no cap.
---
Plague can. Thats why you try avoid getting down together. Because you arent very good, isnt a reason to nerf a killer. Youre the kind of person who says they Hag shouldnt be able to put traps near each other because of double hits.
---
Hurrrr durrr my team was bad so I deswurve to excape cos Im obviously a dbd god and if you dont let me go ur just a loser
---
And the survivors can negate that. They can break all the totems. They can break NOED after it spawns. They can leave. They can just loop and not get hit. 
---
Plus if they don't have enough gens finished, the survivor could find the hatch first as it would spawn open due to it always spawning now
---
Agreed. I didn‚Äôt try hard on them at all. That was the first game I‚Äôve ever played doctor so I figured I could use the situation to test him out. Was actually in the middle of messaging him GG sorry for the DCs when I got that first message.
---
The whole game is balanced around the survivors having a third person perspective; it doesn't seem like a great idea to me.
---
idk what your comment has to do with my post
---
I literally have no idea how that became a meme.
---
Use the perk Whispers. If you get to the point where you want that 4th kill, Whispers will tell you which gate they are trying to open. 
---
Whispers not active? They're going for the other gate
---
Whispers active? Just camp the gate
---
Other than that, if you just patrol the gates, you can tell which one has been worked on if you see any of the 3 red lights lit up just above the panel, so if a gate has red lights on, they're probably nearby
---
It would definitely make it more visceral and engaging. However, the survivor would be at a serious disadvantage. They rely on the 3re pov to track and lookout for killers. If they were only in first person then by the time they see Meyers it'll be too late.
---
It's probably cause it's a Saturday. I main killer Mon through Thurs now. Seems to be less swf lobbies.
---
You should make another one like this but with the focus on people complaining about people complaining about the same shit.
---
Ofc, instead of someone explaining the joke, why dont you through video after video of a youtubers channel till you finally stumble on the origin... Sigh
---
Your sentence confused me but I'll try to take what I got from it. You want him to be not too op but you think the buffs will make him good?
---
I don‚Äôt mind SWFs in general just don‚Äôt like toxic players lmao
---
Absolutely worth it. I‚Äôve been on vacation for a week and got to play on PC. It was an amazing difference. I highly recommend you get it. Especially if you enjoy the game.
---
I don't know if you watch the video, but it was hard to catch him. He really is a good Survivor. So thank you :-)
---
Oh, I like that! That would be very cool.
---
D A R N
---
The clown is the only killer in the game that is actually disturbing. Change my mind.
---
thank youuuu‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Every PTB I've encountered.
---
yeah, i get you lol
---
Does anyone else ever think about what it would be like if the gameplay was written into a series of short films? I occasionally think of how stuff like this would play out in a movie and I get all giddy.
---
Do not use self care
---
He‚Äôll defend you in the cellar in exchange of some finger licking good
---
Why?
---
Nah. Im gonna play like they died. Its not my fault the openly dc'd
---
Just one of those things where you mis read the title, causing you to misunderstand the post.
---
Huzzah a man of quality
---
thank you :)
---
what is the original
---
It‚Äôs not worth using..
---
No problem, man! Best of luck in the Fog :)
---
Having this issue on PC
---
Thank you!‚ô•Ô∏è
---
honestly I kinda agree with the survivor. they had a shitty way of saying it but it's pretty unfair on the two survivors left to still try because you're guaranteed to ruin the game for them and make them lose rank without any effort from you.
---
I agree as a feng main.
---
Same.
---
The new Mario Maker is looking kinda weird
---
Hatch, I choose you!
---
One thing that's a bit hard to get a handle on is that, when a survivor triggers a trap, their camera is dragged to look at it, making them swerve in that direction until they turn back. This is useful in a chase if you put the traps in a corner, since you can force them to waste time fixing their path.
---
Just something to keep in mind if you keep playing Hag.
---
Kinda look's like Myers from the remakes
---
Nah hag is fine tbh she needs another buff and I‚Äôve never actually played against the plague the only killer I have an actual issue with gameplay is the cannibal Freddy his song just sorta gets  on my nerves
---
I agree it was an unfair situation to be put in but I didn‚Äôt cause that
---
I honestly don‚Äôt get the DC players it‚Äôs so much worse to dc than just deal with it
---
Object of Obsession is a really good perk if you're a really good survivor. You can always see the killer and he can't mindgame you, the best survivors get so much from Object of Obsession. It sucks if you're not really experienced with survivor though.
---
Im done...im so done...
---
That's how I got the idea. The long hair was heavily inspired on remake Myers
---
yeah I know. I'm not saying you did
---
Survivors will say that the Hag is camping if she put a trap in front of the hook. They can sneak past the trap, but a lot of them don't bother, and get punished for it. You can safely ignore the people that say this stuff.
---
5% pleasure
---
Replace streetwise and urban evasion with literally anything else
---
Nice crop job
---
Whatever they have to say to protect their ego :)
---
Favorite is wraith. Don't really have a least tbh. I guess billy.
---
I like all killers. The only killer that truly gives me peoblems is trappy boi. Makes me not trust loops or crouch to avoid traps.
---
The clown. Hindering and messing up your screen just sucks as well as the fact that his laughter is just obnoxious.
---
Going to be honest: I suck at survivor. Can‚Äôt kite for the life of me. But when I was leveling Nea for her perks, a number of times I would get a little bit of ground with her and it felt like the Killer would just let me go. Like they were afraid of me or I wasn‚Äôt worth their time.
---
True chads with DS get unhooked and immediately jump into a locker next to where the killer is chasing someone
---
I main Jeff because He‚Äôs DOPE ASF
---
The Hag won't get a chainsaw, or anything like it. The Hillybilly's chainsaw is his power, like the Hag's traps are her power.
---
Can we please stop upvoting shit tier 2012 meme formats that have nothing to do with Dead By Daylight besides a licensed killer?
---
Don‚Äôt really have a favorite.
---
Least favorite is definitely Hag because of potatoes who don‚Äôt know how to crouch.
---
Bought this game a couple weeks ago. I lose ranks/pips every time I restart the game or randomly every 3 or so games. I haven't been able to get out of rank 20 for more than one game. My friend has the same problem but he's been playing for a while. He can't get past rank 13.
---
Doesn‚Äôt think Joseph is best jojo? No dignity
---
When do you get blood warden I really want it but I never can find it
---
I feel I get genrushed too easily without it, idk, maybe I'm just bad at gen pressure.
---
pretty sure it's Freddy's level 40 teachable
---
What do you mean?
---
Fair and balenced. Lmao next youre gonna say moris are balenced, OMEGALUL.
---
I think Chucky is a kind of a given.  I would sacrifice all 3 for 1 Chucky .
---
It‚Äôs a teachable? Damn
---
Nope. If he got to Tier 3, that's your team's fault.
---
No. Cause I dont let him try to stalk me to begin with.
---
Badass!
---
That's a good way of looking at it. I won't give up on it.
---
Despise the clown and bubba fpr their obnoxious noises they make
---
Ha a PBS Spacetime meme &lt;3
---
Learned a lot watching their YouTube
---
Even still that‚Äôs just some animals
---
What perk takes skill?? Literally no killer perk takes skill to use name 1!

While I don't absolutely hate the fence idea, I don't see it happening because I think it would severely cut down on the likelihood of survivors trying to make endgame unhooks/saves and as a solo player that already gets fucked plenty when people just dip, I sincerely hope they don't discourage survivors even more from attempting those plays
---
you can't hide the fact that this is loss
---
Actual survivor main!  Everyone has literally to my comment the wrong way.. yall are dense af
---
I get 60 k+ everygame by playing nurse just with bbq and chilli. Play whatever killer you like but bbq and chilli is a must for bloodpoint farming. It literally gives you 2x the bloodpoints you earn
---
Let them go. If you cant kill them in a regular game and have to resort in gaining their trust till end you don‚Äôt deserve the kills
---
Do you know the dif between acrylic and oil? I've done a couple of acrylic paintings and I really like it but whenever I see an oil painting (especially something like this) I feel like It gives a hell of a lot more passion and feeling to it
---
Thats fine go play something else then. For like a week or something. Go play civilization or something, take a break

The way Spirit moves is pretty unnerving and still gives me the occasional spine tingle, and if we're counting going against them in-game, Michael is fucking scary. But I'd agree Clown is the most disturbing, mostly because of how unhygienic and disgusting his habits are.
---
r/deadbydayiight ? Wut??
---
Yea! I‚Äôm an art education major, so I work with a ton of paints. I kinda hate acrylic because I like blending  and mixing on the canvas, and acrylic dries super quickly! Plus I just love how it looks because it dries exactly how you put it on, where acrylic usually gets darker! Oil is just my fave painting medium to work in :)
---
1. I like to be a little stealthy. It‚Äôs satisfying to successfully hide from the Killer at the last moment. 
---
2. I heard it‚Äôs faster than walking at tier 3. 
---
3. No, I don‚Äôt use it to crouch around the map and not help out the other Survivors.
---
would be cool if the heads would be those of the 3 main survivors like leather face
---
This shit right here is what enrages me when playing the game..
---
Franks mixtape is no longer OP as before. Its horrible so don't use it.
---
Unlike before legion takes practice now. They're not a braindead killer anymore. Learn when to use frenzy and when its good to hit someone. I use frenzy for tracking and getting a first hit. I end frenzy after I caught up to the survivor I injured. Then just m1 them from there.
---
If a survivor gets too far away from you then leave them be and find someone else to chase. Learning how to mindgame loops and when to give up on a chase is important for any killer.
---
Legion is just for the fun. Deep wound actually helps slow the game down significantly since as soon as you hit a survivor they have to escape then mend then heal etc which wastes their time
---
&gt;What killer is the best for farming BP?
---
The killer you know how to play with BBQ. That simple.

Look behind you

I find it more entertaining and fun in that sense

Seems as if he‚Äôs as brainless as the players who use his character
---
Fair enough. The only use for Urban Evasion in my eyes is when versing a hag. It is a perk slot kinda wasted that is only good if you can't loop a killer, and it kinda doesn't improve your gameplay if you play with urban evasion
---
Nope! Two hooks are plenty.  When killers farm they can max every category and still let everyone escape. Just keep hitting them/using your power while hitting them
---
Joseph isnt loyal
---
Would rather have Jeepers Creepers than ghostface. Looks awesome!
---
Yeah itd be imbalanced but it shouldn't affect rank and be completely optional
---
Riiiiiight.
---
Any citation?
---
*wriggling*
---
If anyone is wondering this is from No0b3's "Toxic Nea vs Jokeface video"
---
And you play on PC?
---
Someone gets it, its either you dc to save time or stay and get ruined or spend like 10 mins farming with the killer which is pretty snooze
---
Honestly do really need to change stab wound study and Frank's mixtape because both of those addons are absolutely terrible with Legion's current kit.
---
Also change fuming mixtape because that is crap as well
---
It can if you aren‚Äôt in the terror radius
---
Because if you dc you don't depip, and for some reason people would rather not play the game than derank.
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
lol wtf didn‚Äôt know this existed
---
Next they gonna say that deliverance needs a buff because not everyone uses it
---
The quick camera turn like ‚ÄúDID ANYONE SEE THIS??!‚Äù
---
At this point I don't really understand the point of sweating it or tryharding.  Typically the best matches are the ones where it's a lengthy (7-10 or however many minutes) back and forth and everyone is able to amass bloodpoints.  
---
Then again I guess I'm the type who plays Killer only when I need to do dailies or want to amass up BPs so I play around with the Survivors to max up those chase points and so on.
---
are you dutch
---
Monitor &amp; abuse, save the best for last, brutal strength
---
I bought all killers with auric cells and never got a splinter. Might be because i bought all DLCs 2 weeks later
---
Oh dang so you're like a professional, so wait I've always wondered. How do you separate colors so sharply, is it like a skill and experience thing?
---
The point in seeing other scratch marks is so you can lose the killer in them. You see other people running and you follow their marks until you can break away. Seeing the killer is just an OP bonus that should be it's own perk.
---
Well I did it, and never released it, and then I forgot it xd

Shoutout to best girl Aigis.
---
He got hungry...
---
I wouldn't blame them if it's still didn't deny points to everybody else in the match. Basically you don't fix a hole in your shirt by tearing it up even more.
---
You don't fix the issue of the disconnecting that match by disconnecting and screwing the rest of the people who are remaining over
---
The killer loses out on a lot of brutality hooking and malicious points.
---
And the survivors potentially lose out on a lot of Co-operative points not to mention the game becomes significantly harder
---
Sexy Pig=Sexy upvote
---
Set puke beam to "cripple"...
---
It's just now since the emblem changes you have to do some of everything. Get chased, do gens, and heal/get saves to pip. People that complain about survivor pips are those blendettes that just do gens and leave.
---
Yeah I get that. I would just prefer escaping to be the main priority. If you want to try and help out someone who's body is impaled by a spike it should be very risky. As in you both could die if you make mistakes. It looks like I am in the minority on this front. 
---
I would double the points given to escaping survivors and remove points from Killers who let that happen. Which might help the camping stuff. Sure, the Killer could camp and make sure one survivor doesn't make it, but if the generators get repaired and they escape he/she wont get as many points.
---

---
Easy question: Nea
---
It is definitely practice! It takes a lot of patience and practice to be able to control paints. Heck, I‚Äôm still learning and practicing! It is also in what type of brushes you are using, since that can really change the way the paint is put onto the canvas!
---
Favourite Pig, OINKS
---
least favourite Billy, 8/10 games are against Billy and I am sick of it.
---
Josuke would probably punch a kid if they said something slightly negative about his hair
---
Dead memories seems like a difficult perk to program. Exactly what counts as lunging at the survivor? Do they need to be center screen, what if there‚Äôs 2 right next to each other? The other perks sound very solid though. Good killer concept overall!
---
When there's only one survivor alive.
---
When the number of survivors left in the trial + generators remaining = 4.
---
Don't feel too bad, survivors dcing means killers can depip as well.
---
Well like I said, I barely play survivor, I'm just going off of what I heard.
---
The trapdoor can spawn with more than one survivor in the trial, but it doesn't open without a key.
---
I like it. I use it with Lightweight.
---
Well is you have seen the Saw movies Amanda actually looks good.
---
JUST DON'T THINK OF NAUGHTY STUFF ABOUT PLAGUE.
---
no, i can't either
---
Yes i am :)
---
Lol the mirror is dirty üòÇ
---
The mirror is dirty so its all foggy üòÇ
---
Really? I thought that they removed it from injury but I guess not, because I swear this used to say something different instead of just "overcome the urge to scream" so I thought they had changed it:
---
Animals seem to trust you as they often stay calm in your presence.
---
Reduces chances of alerting Crows by **80¬†%**.
---
Your calm spirit can overcome the urge to scream.
---
Thank you so much! Its missing a few elements tho, will add them later this week :)
---
It's everytime I try to hit and I fail. It's so annoying because my brain says "ok, the survivor made a 360 now I have to change direction" but then the game change it by itself and my brain hurts
---
It‚Äôs okay I found your foot I just looks like you don‚Äôt have one üòÇ
---
IMO every perk is annoying or OP or both.
---
Be Mine Forever: You will just tunnel one person.
---
Hex: Buried Alive: To OP, finishing gens will be a nightmare at low ranks and annoying at high ranks.
---
dead Memories: Again tunneling.
---
I would like to see a small nerf to every perk and perk ranks being removed with every perk being base rank2 instead. this would save alot of BPs and time.

Yeah, after all gens have been done.

Yeah the lower part of the mirror is foggy/dirty. Idk i didnt pay much attention to it i guess its just old hairspray? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Having it take 5-6 seconds to escape would all but guarantee either the unhooked or unhooker are getting caught (again)
---
In a very early version of the game, there was a timer on NOED. 120 seconds to be exact. It was apparantly too weak, so they changed it to a hex perk. If it has to stay a hex perk, I would still stick with the totem count on the UI, but my proposed change is that a killer earns a token for every down they get. Once the 5th gen pops(so it doesnt work with hatch), you gain a 3/4/5% movement speed bonus, and have the exposed status effect on them. Once you have less than 2 tokens, the survivors aren't exposed anymore. Attacking after the fifth gen is repaired loses 2 tokens. This is beneficial to both sides as the killer won't have to worry/be frustrated about the totem breaking or the perk not activating, because it's not a hex anymore. The survivors won't have to be frustrated either when the killer literally does nothing all game and then gets a 4k because of NOED. &lt;-- Literally!
---
The killer will have to work for it, so it's not unfair for survs, and a surv cant just randomly deactivate your perk, so it's not frustrating for the killer. What do you think?
---
Well it‚Äôs dope costume!
---
Keys are an item-type that either allows you to open doors or track others(using add-ons).  
---
The green key can't open the hatch while the other two can.
---
Ok thnx
---
Now I remember that POV porn with the couple going in an abandoned house and the guy fucks the girl till she becomes a monster and the guy's dick becomes all black. Fucking the plague is something similar I guess.
---
Thank you! ^_^
---
This isn't about fixing anything, it's about moving on to the next game. There's pretty much nothing to fix at this point. Yeah, may be worth it for a killer because of BBQ stacks, but that's it. As a survivor, you stay to get, what, 10k ? Not worth it IMO.
---
I've seen this 3 times, but I'm sure there's more than 1 duo doing this and more than 1 redditor finding it funny
---
He won‚Äôt. Director of the movies was a sick, creepy pedophile. They don‚Äôt want to associate themselves with him or his movies.
---
Lol off topic but I only just last week finally got around to buying Adam and I've been having so much damn fun with deliverance, it's so satisfying to pull off. I really want more high risk high reward perks like that.
---
Trapper Hallowed Blight's skin also has his nipples outside

"What's that smell? ... The sweet blood, oh, it sings to me. It's enough to make a man sick"

---
That's where balance comes into play, I thought four to five seconds would be fine, but it might need to be two to three.
---
Played a couple games since this. Killed all 4 survivors every time. Thanks for the tips!
---
Favourite: Huntress
---
Least favourite: Trapper
---
Worked like a charm. Thanks for the tip!
---
My fav to play against would probably be spirit. The mind game challenge leads to a lot of fun moments
---
Least favorite by far is leatherface. At least half of them just hardcore camp, and it ruins the game for the survivor caught or the altruistic survivors who go for the saves like me.
---
I know right, i've pulled some good babozles with deliverance
---
Rancor on Freddy. You can do a silly One Punch Freddy build via STBFL, PWYF, Monitor And Abuse, and Rancor.
---
Hit everybody but the obsession the entire match, then once gens are done one-hit down and Mori the obsession. Usually saves you the hassle of dealing with a "meta" of man user.
---
Good luck to anyone who'll get this game . I'm just here to watch
---
Was it because of my tips or just practice in general. In any which way I'm still glad I could help
---
Exactly. There's really no point in staying and trying to play the game. I've encountered several people in the past telling me that dcing/killing myself on hook isn't worth it because I could've still escaped somehow. Like, are you this naive?
---
My experience is usually that I'm the first one to find Ruin while last survivor alive running away from killer during EGC. My last thoughts before death are "So that's where it was!"
---
15% pain
---
I don't get it, because I get dodged all the time. I always bring medkit because I don't run self care. You are rank 1 killer, do you really still expect easy games against noobs?
---
They said they weren‚Äôt looking into doing Jeepers Creepers because of the sexual assault allegations made against the creator (not too sure‚Äî it was someone related to the creation of the character)
---
On Doctor, absolutely, it's almost a must.
---
On Legion, if you're farming it's not awful as it can help with killer instinct
---
lemme guess. you play league of legends?
---
Out of curiosity, why do you consider her not a strong killer?
---
I'm more interested in the icons. They look better than default
---
Hag default skin and Hallowed blight Trapper: 
---
"Am I a joke to you?"
---
Shawnee Smith was a total babe back in the day so you got me there.
---
Favourite: Anyone who doesn't slug, tunnel or camp. Those tend to be fun matches.
---
Less favourite: The opposite (and Nurses).
---
32k is the max amout you can get in a single game sweety
---
Talking to you is like talking to a brick wall. For the past 7 replies of yours, you say pretty much the exact same words. Watermarking your meme is ok, but he watermarked the photo, which he did NOT make. But you're just gonna reply with *but he made the meme*, so I guess I just wasted my time
---
Reporting in that I'm having this issue as well. Does it ever break out of this for you guys or time to play something else?
---
Because that's the point I'm trying to make
---
Remember when people said ds is dead after the patch?
---
After the nerf where her traps don‚Äôt work at endgame you just have to use them to stall the game for a solid 30 seconds and she has no advantage during the chase if survivors know what to do with her dash but she isn‚Äôt awful just isn‚Äôt the strongest
---
I wish they could create a male killer that is not American
---
They changed it to only Licensed DLC when they made the non licensed killers available with shards. Since they are free now, I guess they figured theres no reason to have people try them out because they can buy them with play time
---
EGC, when only the hatch remains, is supposed to be favourable towards the killer; why should a survivor have a great chance of escaping if the killer plays well? It just doesn't make sense.
---
Exactly my point.
---
You are going to have to mend if you are outside the terror radius or you get downed
---
How do you counter her dash? Sorry for the follow up question and thank you for getting back. Appreciated!
---
It's not necessarily self care itself, but the behavior it encourages for most players (from what I tend to see, anyway).
---
This meme is so specific yet i can relate still relate to it on a deep level. I saw survivors &amp; myself getting fucked by this
---
But the point of NOED is just that: to secure a single kill. It‚Äôs the DBD equivalent of a noob tube. It exists so new and unskilled players don‚Äôt get completely routed by better ones. The fact that it doesn‚Äôt trigger until the game is essentially lost means it will never be considered an actually good perk. Under anything less than the most ideal circumstances it should never earn more than a single kill.
---
It's like it adds a whole minigame to each match, a side objective. Safe unhook someone before your own first hook and side mission completed and then I'm giddy the whole rest of the match with deliverance in my pocket. I waited to get Adam for so long because I just didn't realize how fun it is to have deliverance in my load out. It's honestly low key reenergized my love for playing
---
I never used decisive strike before this week, didn't seem to need it. As an experiment I used it for a week, and I get to use it almost every game...
---
Just keep working at it, theres no secret its a lot of extra hours spent learning and practicing. For character specifically learning anatomy is super important. Thinking within the realm of micro storytelling with your details will add personality and lastly try to observe and learn about elements that will be part of your piece. For example if you are making a bomber jacket, how are they made in real life? what sort of material is it made of? what era is it from, is it old or new? How does it fit the character? Are there buttons or zippers? how many pockets? is there a design on the back, if so how does the design relate to the characters story? Are there details you can add to help tell the story/history of the jacket, bullet holes in specifif spots, maybe the elbows are worn down etc... Its really about taking that mindset and trying to apply it to every element in a piece. Hope that helps. :)
---
You gotta understand that there's lots of different playstyles. Also a lot of new players that are still learning to play the game. Camping is an unfortunate result of that. There are perks that can help mitigate camping, but the best way to punish a campy killer is to just do the generators. Sure being camped sucks, but just do your best, try not to get hooked, and move on to the next trial. It's just a game after all. And there are plenty of killers that don't camp. Good luck.
---
Ok but in all honesty, can someone explain why people like iggy? He was a fart joke that appeared once per ep and basicly did nothing up untill 3 eps before he died
---
What game are you playing my dude?????
---
r/UnexpectedSCP
---
I think they should just have the killers glow so every player can see them if they are camping around the hooked player that way you just go for the generators and he won‚Äôt stick around the hooked player since everyone knows he‚Äôs not hunting
---
SHIRTLESS MYERS BTW 
---
SPIRITS EAT MY ASS BTW
---
No, they will let you know when they're handling the case though. If you care, you can check the offender's profile to see if action was taken. Usually happens quite fast.
---
You usually just leave the pallet and run away sorry I can‚Äôt be detailed I have a family event and I‚Äôm under the influence but yeah just run away from the pallet when the sound of her dash starts  and you can usually run far enough away
---
Well I took your tips and practiced them by playing matches with good success rate. So I suppose both. Anyways, thank you
---
Remember when people said it was impossible to play Survivor after the Exhaustion nerfs?
---
There are abilities for that and i have it equiped, of the killer is 12M close to me while i'm hooked everyone can see him, doesn't help against campers tho
---
I have reported a Nea for bodyblocking and was notified action was taken and what type of ban and I was directed to their ban system page and how it works, so if that Nea I reported does it again and is reported with video evidence I think the next ban is a couple days or a week, I forgot.
---
You just have to run away from the pallet as she dashes  it can usually get you far enough away from her
---
Just 2 hooks each, then chase everyone and let everyone slam you with a few pallets. Break a few generators then open the doors when you're ready for them to fuck off. I'll usually hit people at the gates and let them crawl out. Sometimes I've had the team actually stay for the collapse and give me the 4k as a thank you.
---
Actually killing anyone you're farming with is bad form
---
Lmao.
---
I know! Tier 1 BBQ
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty good. Not really in the top tier of Survivor perks but it‚Äôs still good.
---
I remember that they said rip sprint burst tho
---
nice
---
I guess if ‚Äúrealized the mistake‚Äù you mean ‚Äúnoticed that they just make the perk take more effort to active instead of making it completely useless‚Äù
---
Nobody will be running MoM if it‚Äôs only protection hits, but I suppose that‚Äôs what the people complaining wanted
---
Doesn‚Äôt like Iggy? No dignity
---
(Cool stand, kills Pet Shop by himself, redeems himself by saving polnareff, learns the importance of killing DIO. Maybe he was annoying at first but I, along with many others, grew to love him.)
---
How do you know it was the items that made them leave?
---
https://youtu.be/82cZUKt8ngo
---
What‚Äôs your argument
---
i absolutely love this perk as survivor. i always feel so much quieter and when i dont run it i feel so loud. as killer i hate it bc i rely on sound tons
---
I dont know if I either love or hate that joker Make-Up
---
Yeah, super solid perk in general, especially good against Spirit!
---
I do. But i was more thinking about cause of Spirit and the new Freddy who have passive parts to their powers.
---
Oh please. We know they pick DC... lol
---
When you reach levels 30, 35, and 40 you can learn teachable perks which allow you to find those perks in other killers' bloodwebs
---
Can't apply make up in prison, gotta use the blood of those you killedüòâ
---
Hag with monitor and nurses is an easy down. People are afraid of being injured, you brake the chase, wait 5 seconds, and Bam, where he goes with self care. You just take the right angle, because survivors don't know how to take a safe healing spot and easy down.
---
Well I didn‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôm a killer main.
---
It's Prue!!!
---
I would agree, but you have those survivors who always claim you are tunneling just because you their friend farms them and then you down them.
---
Devour hope kinda takes skill. You have to hook the survivors, not camp them, make sure the survivor you're hooking isnt dead on the next hook so you could at least gain a stack from them(if they're dead on hook, just leave them on the ground) and guard the totem.
---
Still doesnt force them to heal. Nobody except rank 20's will get downed from his power lol
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what most people think. Once you get to levels 12 and beyond camping is used a lot less often in my experience. The beginning grind is the hardest part so just keep practicing b
---
Spirit would like to have a word w/u
---
The wraith is not American
---
Eh, if the mods deem it rulebreaking I won't argue
---
Wait what's interesting
---
Has this been officially said by BHVR? I would love to get a link for future uses.
---
Hag and Doctor be my first choices.
---
What dose the green key even do
---
Cant wait to finish my cosmetic contest drawing, I have such high Hope's for it
---
Borrowed Time, Mettle of Man, Decisive Strike.
---
I‚Äôd like that
---
Not in those exact words, but the have said it‚Äôs a franchise they are not interested getting involved with.
---
I said MALE killer.
---
Legion is Canadian
---
They are canadian. I meant northamerican by saying "American" not from USA.
---
You dont have the 4th perk, that's all
---
I completely agree, I did make note that sometimes, not always, you can simply watch both gates as killer, which I find to be rather lackluster. I've even walked across map with the nurse without blinking and made it there before they could finish.
---
He moves at only 60% speed but has a gun
---
Really ? That's fucking sad. MoM being triggered by safe unhooks was a very cool idea, making it a powerful but not OP perk, and encouraging positive gameplay.
---
MoM being only triggered by protection hits just makes it useless.
---
Love Micheal and Hag, they still jump scare me to this day, I despise Hillbilly, takes very little skill landing that saw.
---
**NIGERUNDAYO!!!**
---
Well it's my first time seeing this, I'm sorry for those who saw this several times
---
He is an immigrant in America probably
---
Tunneling just sorta happens, I dont actively do it, but if Im,not chasing someone and don't see anyone by the time a person is unhooked after I went around to Gens, double back and see the unhooked Survivor,,sorry Charlie, sometimes ya need to go back on the Hook. Some Survivors are really potato and keep running into you or always going for a save asap...itll get ya killed and I do not show Mercy to Survivors except rare circumstances.
---
The hammer on the stomach
---
So in other words, you want to be able to sneak around the map for 20 minutes looking for the hatch while the killer twiddles his thumbs.
---
He is american. "American" for northamerica, not USA
---
I don‚Äôt have a favorite
---
I truly hate billy, don‚Äôt know why though.
---
That's amazing, I tried it once or twice but so far no dice, I'll keep that in mind thou :)
---
Plague isnt American
---
As an organism that does not exist, I agree.
---
I love doing that to killers. It‚Äôs like the ultimate middle finger. Kudos to that guy.
---
Borrowed Time Borrowed Time Borrowed Time.  For the love of Gods, more Survivors need to run BT
---
Wah
---
This is embarrassing
---
I hear you, I suppose I just see the extra boost as unnecessary. I found much more enjoyment and felt more accomplished when I killed all four survivors on my own accord. It's definitely not a common opinion, but it's mine nonetheless. I definitely agree that the RNG skews the EndGame, though.
---
You can only get 32k in a game, BPS only multiply those points.
---
If the Killer got 3 Kills and found the Hatch first, why shouldn‚Äôt he have the advantage? If you want a balanced chance at escape then get the gens done before the Killer sacrifices 3 Survivors.
---
It isn't made to be easy for the survivors. If you haven't finished the generators and all other survivors are dead then you have failed. The end game is made to have the odds stacked against the survivor, not for it to be equal.
---
Gonna be honest here, this just sounds like you being salty that the Killers now have power over the Survivors during the end game.
---
We should wait until they  buff him since they are doing that before we do anything. 
---
They want to make stalking faster, making it harder for him to lose h is power and make him not be as loud as he is, all of which will make him better.
---
oof 929
---
This post is making me realize I have issues
---
Why is no one reading? MALE killers.
---
just do what people usually do and sit by the gates and hope the hatch was closed on the other side of the map
---
And a d/c who stayed in the lobby

Okay this one is actually super dope!

Self care as a survivor and whispers as a killer.

I see your Speedwagon and raise you Gyro Zeppeli.

Can you link or share the killer icons??

Omg only if we can get a prostitute cosmetic for Jane

Just a plain black hoodie I found in my closet! It might have been ordered off amazon? I'm sorry I don't know much about it haha
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
RNG can be a pain in the butt, for sure. I've had hatches spawn right under survivors and they dipped on me. Not the worst thing to happen. I have heard this happening to survivors a lot, though.
---
Who is the top one?
---
I've played him a lot since the rework at red ranks, he is still kinda trash.
---
His only use is to farm tons of BP and waste survivor time, but its really tough to catch people as you cant use the power to down them and also that Fatigue lasts for a whole 4 seconds, way longer than nurse blinks.
---
I'm pretty sure top comment's implication was her pose she's in. Meant in ***that*** kinda way, y'know? 
---
Wink wink
---
I  r e a l l y  l i k e  t h i s. Great work!
---
For quite a bit of my farming, I used LF. He‚Äôs not the best killer but you can earn deviousness fairly easy. On top of that, he‚Äôs a very good killer to learn the game on. Since he‚Äôs looped so well, you‚Äôll come out being a much better killer than Billy or Nurse.

The axe and the mask are absolutely amazing. You did a fantastic job so far!! :D
---
It's the correct term. 
---
 
---
To wriggle is to turn or twist the body or a body part with writhing motions: *The* *rabbit's* *nose* *wriggled.*
---
Or to move or proceed with writhing motions: *wriggle* *into* *a* *sleeping* *bag;* *wriggled* *out* *of* *his* *grasp.*
---
But to wiggle is to move back and forth with quick irregular motions: *The* *gelatin* *wiggled* *on* *the* *plate.*
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say *only*, Benedict observes Michael as being very willing to kill for the Entity.
---
If the Claudette has dark clothes on then you already ruined the experience for the killer
---
Try it on Autohaven, that's the only place I found more than one ramp on.
---
This is fucking great. See you on the front page
---
*Happy oinks*
---
You're god damn right
---
That's the trolling shift I was talking about. It went from survivors trolling killer who couldn't catch them to killers trolling survivors who had no chance of escaping. I've heard this a lot as well. While I'm not sorry to see the trolling survivors gone, but I'm not happy to see that it's shifted to killers being toxic to survivors.
---
I was practicing the ramp on auto haven. I know you can do it on other maps but I only the the general spot for the hills on auto haven
---
It's not death that the entity feeds on, it's strong emotions, death is just a good source of that. Good luck trying to resist being emotionally tortured by literal reality itself. There's a book about that called "I have no mouth and I must scream" and I think the title says all you need to know. Even if you do become totally worthless to the entity, once that happens it just stops making reality for you, it leaves you in the infinite dark. It's a bit hard to starve it when it can just pull more victims in.
---
But the entity isn't entirely omnipotent.
---
The devs have mentioned that the hatch, gates, and generators were not actually designed by the entity, someone else built them originally. (thought that was a while ago, so that might not be cannon anymore).
---
There's also mention in game of someone who's able to manipulate the fog - Vigo - as well as others who have begun to learn how it works. The hallowed blight skins (halloween event skins with yellow syringes) came from a lore event where someone was experimenting with organic material that entity expunges each year. They managed to transform the killers with it, and even overpowered a killer after injecting it into themself.
---
Later this year we're gonna get the archive, an in-game lore discovery system. It involves a character who can apparently retrieve the memories that the entity has absorbed from its victims, and deal some temporary damage to it in the process.
---
On top of all that the devs have said there actually is a way to escape the entity, and that someone has done it. But that was a long time ago that they said that, so who knows if that's still cannon at this point either.
---
I actually didnt know that thanks for the tip
---
It's just practice. I recommend either trying a KYF game there or just practicing when you have everyone slugged.
---
Joey? He‚Äôs black and Canadian
---
Report &gt; Unsportsmanlike &gt; Disconnected after X (match start/hooked/other player DCd)
---
I just do this to literally everyone. Do i blame people necessarily? No.
---
Will i report them anyway? Yes.
---
If the hatch is closed by the killer, all exit gates are automatically opened.
---
I love how Killers who are now in rank 20 - 15 ranges have to deal with red ranks curb-stomping them because of survive with friends groups. 2 Smurf accounts with two read ranks that bully the killer the whole match. And then they have the audacity to shit talk afterwards and just entirely ruin the game for someone which intern does not allow the game to grow or thrive.
---
Updated my comment as you misunderstood what I meant.
---
Bend me over Mary
---
It exsists to finish the game, honestly if the killer closes the hatch theyve won it should be unlikely the survivor gets away. 
---
The survivor gets a second chance at survival with the hatch and even then has a slim third chance to open a gate
---
I think you‚Äôre taking this way too seriously.
---
Theres no safe place to heal..
---
Fascinating... What about the killers? How do they get turned into super-strong monsters when they have human backstories?
---
Idk if you‚Äôre on mobile but it was like the 6th featured post at the top of this sub
---
I think endgame is fine. I've escaped (and lost the survivor) after hatch has been closed a few times.
---
Hatch standoff was stupid as hell. Even if Killer found the hatch first he'd have to stand by it and wait for the survivor to reach it so the standoff can begin.
---
Now it's whoever finds the hatch first wins. Killer has a major (but not 100% guaranteed) advantage if he finds it first but the survivor has a second chance when it comes to the gates. 
---
The power is put into the killer's hands where it belongs IMHO when it comes to the hatch if he gets to it first. After the 3k the objective switches to finding the hatch. You find it first? Great! You escape! Killer finds it first? He's effectively closed out the round but you have one last chance with the gates. The hatch is basically your last chance to get out and even if it's closed, you have one last-last chance. 
---
I do agree the exit gate locations can be shitty sometimes. 
---
One other thing is some endgame perks activate when hatch is shut. This goes both ways. I'm 100% sure NOED and Adrenaline procs (I once had a guy escape after I closed the hatch for extra points after slugging him, and Adrenaline procced lol. Suffering from success I guess.) but Bitter Murmur and Rancor do not.
---
True but he isn't really scary IMO he is more of just a murdering machine
---
?
---
Isn't she regarded as one of the stronger killers or did something change?
---
Somebody sees it lol thank you.
---
If you do get this little guy I recommend giving him soft pallets as he is still young and has some deformities like being a stealth killer and has loud footsteps and crouching not even helping him get the exposed effect.
---
Not to mention the DCs, but it does become impossible to escape with less than 4 people at the start. One dc usually connects to two. And if it‚Äôs legion? Forget about playing a full match
---
Exactly.
---
Right, everyone does. It‚Äôs such a pointless perk.
---
That's not skill!  Lol hooking and going after someone else is what you're supposed to do.
---
Imagine if the devs listened to great ideas like this.
---
The future radiographer in me appreciates how you have both the radius and ulna showing in her right forearm.
---
Amazing (and anatomically accurate) work!
---
She is, but her viability has gone down because of all the bad maps for her that are being added; I wouldn't mind a 115% Huntress atm.
---
She is in experienced hands.
---
Those trophies though
---
She is, she just requires some skill. I personally can't but others can.
---
Not everything needs a counter tho..
---
When the auto aim prioritizes awake survivors over sleeping ones as Freddy.
---
Sometimes people like to interact with humans to have their questions asked.
---
In a way he is the scariest killer because he is so real, he is based on a real life killer. So you can see him happening.
---
But if you include supernatural killers, the scariest one would be Freddy. you can't really escape him.
---
Aw! Thank you! I tried my best to remain accurate, using my reflection and online references as models!
---
By my calculations that shot was only 34 meters away. You did not meet the minimum threshold of ~~Across the map~~ 45 meters to attain maximum karma points.

Well it paid off my dude!

This is amazing! I hope you keep us updated c:
---
The thing I find scary about Michael is that he never has motive besides base instinct. Like I‚Äôm hungry I‚Äôll kill this dog and eat it. Or this girl was fucking in my house so I‚Äôll kill her so she doesn‚Äôt bother me. Nothing is beyond him. Woman, children, friends. IMO rob zombie did the best job showing Michael completely separating from people in any way. He killed Danny Trejo even though he looked after him in prison. He killed a guy just because he was wearing cloths his size, he kills people for being in his long abandoned house he kills people for nothing and everything the scary thing is that ghost face can be stopped by the police and has to care about his identity Michael thinks a plastic mask is his true face and would probably pull my stomach out in broad daylight. The only one who he considered worth something was his mom and his sister as a baby and as soon as his sister betrayed him she was on the kill list too.
---
Dwight is the horror movie buff who knows how to survive but is always nervous, hence the reason he‚Äôs always biting his nails but can be a good leader.  
---
Feng Min is the smart one who doesn‚Äôt know how she ended up in this mess, she‚Äôs nimble and tries her best to always stay hidden. 
---
Kate is the girl you think is going to die right away because of her appearance but actually lives on and becomes a final girl because she‚Äôs a total badass. 
---
Ace is the one who gets way to cocky and probably tries to fight back, getting his ass handed to him by the killer.
---
That is true. I just feel like it's silly, really.
---
Botany Knowledge and Shadowborn.
---
I hate how slow it is to heal. I also use medkits 90% of the time so the efficiency is noticable when you get a yellow kit to heal you twice for example.
---
Shadowborn because I hate the default FOV. I don't care which killer it is. I always use it.
---
Actually it‚Äôs more like 
---
*ambiguous roar*
---
*amanda grunts*
---
I'm sorry if anyone get annoyed by seeing this over and over, I'm a "new player" with only 350 hours, and this is the first time I've let this duo üòÖ

This comment alone is proof enough you were being sarcastic in your original.

Love it. Would love to see her prosper as a killer someday.

THANK YOU! CARING PLAYERS ARE DA REAL MVP!

He throws piss bottles
---
Couldn‚Äôt it work with doc by increasing his terror radius along with all the other perks that cause various affects inside of it?
---
shes good if youre experienced with the long distance hatchet throws and snipe shots but has extremely bad map pressure. i think the devs consider her ability to throw hatchets real far her ‚Äòmap pressure‚Äô but its rare for you to see people who can do that.
---
do keep in mind im on ps4. on pc i think shes considered good but on ps4 shes definitely a joke
---
I see people really like your fresh comment from 2019
---
You couldn‚Äôt live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.
---
Banning for rage quitting is a harsh punishment. Some people have anger issues and cant help it. I feel the best way is to have a "timeout" clock. Dc 1 time? 10 min timeout, cannot queue for 10 mins. Dc twice? 30 mins, etc. 
---
Dc mid game, complete a gen? Lol. No.
---
SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
---
Huntress is fine wtf?
---
David: "Hey is that you next to me?"
---
Feng: "not me I'm working on a gen"
---
Claudette: "Not me, I'm crouching in some tall grass"
---
Dwight: "well I've been hiding in this locker"
---
David: surprised pikachu face
---
yep this is 100% spot on right now
---
No, a good qol change would be to let us select the color. Yes, I realize there is a mod on pc. But im on console lol.
---
I mean not nessacrily stream sniping your getting exact location of killer most 4 man's give general locations also so many perks literally can give the killers aura to you like alert and empathy to know if your chasing someone and then of course object of obsession
---
idk but ive seen a lot of people on reddit complaining ab how bad huntress is
---
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
---
A lot of people complained about the sounds Ghost Face makes while in his stealth mode. Devs said they are bugged and they shouldn't be so loud. But I think they shouldn't be at all in the first place.
---
If they run Object of Obsession, pretty much yes.
---
I really wish reddit would let me add paragraphs lol
---
Is not the same, stream sniping a survivor is actually worse
---
Yep. 
---
No argument there.
---
It was a buff as it was before. I actually suggested that making it protection or safe unhooks before, so if they didn't change the needs to be injured requirement, it would've been exactly my idea for it.
---
We all know David‚Äôs the black guy from Jason takes Manhattan.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TlwVs58qpw
---
A way to  make stream sniping harder is adding a delay or putting a screen to hide your game  when you're on the main menus tho
---
...a reverse bear trap?
---
That vault is a skill-shot at this point.
---
Grandma Cactus!
---
Right, Doc is one of the only killers that can benefit from it.
---
It's a stealth perk, so it HAS to be useless
---
They made your day. Don‚Äòt let some redditors ruin it. Love me som Dwario Bros! Thanks for sharing ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Idk, I did like him in the last eps he was in, i just can't like a charecter that was bad the whole part then became good for like 3 eps, that's why I don't like Johnathan, I just have not seen much from him
---
*One player brings a flashlight*

Toxic squad gets destroyed by spirit
---
Holy shit, that this exists made me audibly guffaw.
---
Seriously?
---
Some of that is regional. I get a SWF team in less than 30 seconds it's the three man squads that screw it up because the solo players are kinda light atm. Three man bug comes and goes as well.
---
like what i use sprint burst dstrike and self care and borrowed time

Wears a mask, still shows drivers license x_x

nice cosplay tho

*andachainsaw*
---
Pft no, not even
---
Yeah I know, thanks for being a legend and sticking up for me, some people don‚Äôt understand memes apparently
---
Bloodlust is good. Autoaim I would love to be removed as it makes me hit walls when I lunge around corners.
---
we have spirit tho
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a new player too with only 500 hours on survivor and 300 on killer. Noobs unite!
---
What about the sounds of the clown?
---
Autoaim?  I need to facts about this.
---
Doesnt matter if you get downed or not, it still wastes time
---
I am a little confused by what you mean. But, if you mean that survivors could get even stronger as SC and DC were base and more perks could be used, thats kind the idea. But, concerning Ruin and all totems lighting up is that the most meta perk, the only thing that slows the game down is Ruin. You will not catch a single mid-high rank killer not using ruin. It is a necessity. So, adding that in base once again alows for more playstyles and when you light up all totems it will add the sub game of getting the right totem- which will also slow the game down. Which is what the game, I think, needs. A sub game, and I think totems would be the good sub game.
---
ALWAYS keep your traps moving. after a survivor gets trapped in one or undoes your trap, you know theyll be looking out for that spot from then on, so pick up that trap and move it. they cant guess where your traps are if youre in the habit of switching the spots around every time youre on that side of the map. also, dont waste time placing traps in an area where the survivors wont visit often. theres no point in placing a trap in an area of the map where theres no gens boxes or totems.
---
Why are you being such an ass?
---
I'll frick you up mister
---
Doctor with BBQ, Beast of Prey, Distressing, and Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Remember Skyrim on the PS3 lol, I lost 3 saves due to random corruption and the game ran at 20 fps average and would tank to 10-15 when literally anything happened. As far as I know it was never fixed. Devs won't invest time into a port if they think theres no real profit I guess
---
**0% Proximity to hooked survivor**
---
I'd rather play Wraith. Legion can farm bloodpoints extremely well but they're not an effective killer.
---
I'm not a survivor main...
---
From now on I‚Äôm a window repairman billy main
---
Bubba. He took my friends all down in the basement. :(
---
Ik, the memes that I've made I've done the same
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing and saying that they have a slight advantage. But that goes the same way for survivors then. Since you want a blood point boost for playing against swf why can‚Äôt survivors get a hint about what killer they are playing before the match starts? EVERYTIME
---
Huntress is not sexy with thos hairy legs
---
the weird thing is that other people were siding up with him, like I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs shady about watermarking a meme I made
---
Ramping in dbd is where a hillbilly use a slope or something of the sort to reach areas he wouldn't be able to get to. For example billy can ramp up the side of a hill to get on top of it instead of walking up it like usual. This can be use to catch survivors that are on top a hill off guard or to get on top a loop and other things. If you want to see examples of this look up "RO - dbd billy" on youtube.
---
This happened to me last night
---
Daddy bing bong*
---
Oinko
---
Yeah early when the argument started I was getting upvotes but I guess they realized it was him and that's when the hivemind started
---
Adrenaline is good, Lithe/Balance Landing/Dead Hard are good too, Object of Obsession is perfect if you want to be toxic and you are good at looping, Distortion is good if you aren't good at looping and you want to avoid BBQ or other aura reading perks.
---
Nah I got 4 colorblind friends and they all say they're eye disabled, for memes and for free stuff
---
yeah you got downvoted badly just because of people who think he‚Äôs right because he‚Äôs like some sort of meme-god
---
Wmi?
---
Sorry.
---
Meant to say: Season 1 of Konosuba.
---
The same thing might happen to you, we're the ones being polite as well, no curse words from us or anything
---
To all killer mains i've teabagged at pallets. I'm sorry, the game wouldn't be as fun without you killers and I hope we can hug eachother a bit more in the future
---
Best regards
---
/Survivor main
---
We'll make it.
---
Was joking about an unhook build
---
I can hear the humming.
---
I guess it‚Äôs best to just leave this alone, thanks for sticking up for me dude, you‚Äôre a legend
---
Yeah np, you're the one that's doing nothing wrong
---
I see wasn‚Äôt sure haha don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used wglf or wmi hah
---
Except they‚Äôre not at a huge disadvantage, there‚Äôs plenty of perks to even the playing field, playing without perks is definitely a huge disadvantage though. Same with killers, but killers can‚Äôt do anything about SWF communication to make it even.
---
Is it like the final two episodes?
---
Got my vote! Draw up the clown from American Horror story that‚Äôs what we need!
---
Really? That‚Äôs dumb as hell
---
Ooo, I‚Äôm honestly a killer main too. 
---
The only time I play survivor is if I‚Äôm playing with a friend otherwise it can get really annoying playing solo. 
---
Trapper is my favorite to play as because, I agree, it‚Äôs extremely satisfying when they stumble into your traps. 
---
He‚Äôs my highest lvl killer with Michael coming in second. I used to main Billy &amp; The Huntress when I first started playing. Huntress can be rewarding especially when you get a hit with a thrown axe. 
---
Wraith genuinely scares me too because of his invisibility. NGL I try my hardest to avoid him when playing in a match against him, idc what kind of BP I‚Äôm missing out on.
---
Huntress is in a pretty decent spot. I wouldn‚Äôt want the devs to buff her until they fix hit boxes.
---
3rd grade writing level btw
---
Dude I get so many games as killer where 4 SWFs are running MoM, DS, DH, Adrenaline, or BT. (Those five perks are the only ones I see ever and I'm a rank 11/10 killer. Add to that, it's not enough they have that shit, they also live to bodyblock me to protect the unhooker going for a save, bodyblock the person who got unhooked despite having BT on, and bodyblock me through any loops. THEN, after that, they teabag like they're hot shit. THEN, they send me messages wherr they trash talk: "ggez, git gud, trash killer, nice tunneling, etc." I'm on xbox so you know they're toxic because without a keyboard, it takes a damn long time to type of that hate mail. Fuck these perks and the people who run them.
