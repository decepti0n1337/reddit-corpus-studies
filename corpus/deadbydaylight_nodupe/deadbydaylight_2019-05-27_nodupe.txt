I think blade and soul beats DBD in terms of being horribly optimized
---
---
---
Wasn't it because it activated too often during chases and was too distratcting or something?
---
Cue the opening scene of Scream 2 where everyone in the theater is wearing Ghostface masks and screaming excitedly.
---
You have spirit in A tier but Hillbilly in S tier?
---
Only if they can distiguish between bad connection/game crash and a deliberate DC
---
Weird seeing you in the wild
---
Yes. Spirit is harder to play with less of a reward.
---
Neither did they
---
i don't find it horror but it's worth watching, i cried more instead of getting scared, it's really sad
---
The exteriors looks like they are made of plaster, and they probably have a plastic base against the face.
---
How would you say it's balance around swf if the only killer may do something against them is Nurse? That's not balance my dude/dudess.
---
[here you go!](https://imgur.com/a/i2c089K) we were taking pictures in a large public park so there‚Äôs occasionally kids doing cartwheels and shit in the background lmao
---
If you have the Surveillance perk (from the Pig), you might want to give it a try. I use it to pull people off gens straight out of invisibility.
---

---
I usually use a couple tracking perks, and avoid pallet management perks since you can mindgame pallets instead.
---
Her purple add ons are generally seen as stronger than her pink ones, but I guess it depends on your play style. The Prayer Beads can make the Spirit one of the most powerful killers in the game.
---
Myers is most definitely A tier.
---
So you actually believe he came here to make a complaint about 6% of the games he‚Äôs in?
---
You ACTUALLY believe that? 
---
Because if you do, I feel very sad for you.
---
r/punpatrol hands on your head!
---
Against bad survivors, even Freddy is op.
---
Thanks!
---
And why?
---
The only argument I'd have would be putting leatherface in C tier. and also, Freddy's not D tier, he's F tier for Freddy
---
lmao there‚Äôs a pic of me crouching with UE in mind in the link i just posted
---
Yep, I've found changing the quality does absolutely nothing for the fps, just makes it look even more shit
---
I only have one prayer beads and ring offeringüò≠
---
Since 2.6.2 We'll Make It has a cap of 100% healing increase.
---
How dare you escape his hits.
---
Bubba should be a tier
---
I‚Äôve seen hybrid panda do that build but I‚Äôm not the most skilled killer so I think I‚Äôll get stomped on üò≠
---
Not a mental disorder according to literally all of science bruv
---
I played against a Spirit running this, with purple and pink add ons. After she killed everyone else and closed the hatch, I was lucky to open the gate and escape. It was a rough match.
---
Nah if you clear out the pallets and know how to mind game with his chainsaw, with some charge time addons, he can be really really good.
---
Excellent idubbbz crossover
---
Happened to me with Bill before. His empty pistol holster was sticking out the front/side of the Locker.
---
Ruin, BBQ/Monitor and Abuse, Surveillance, and Nurse‚Äôs Calling/Discordance
---
Because he has massive snowball potential. Especially with BBQ or shit your pants
---
Hmmm don‚Äôt like this gif, no sir
---
Thanks
---
cant unsee hill billy
---
Eh, high B is the highest I can put him because of his reliance on charge time addons.
---
Well they did say in the developer stream that they were looking into things they could buff about her after the nerf to her endgame traps, but maybe that was just something they said to keep us happy....
---
Assuming you are not going to run Prayer Beads every match, you should use STBFL + BBQ + Nurse + Ruin, NOED or another perk of your choice.
---
If you have the faster charge addons and speed those will work well as you can hit with STBFL and quickly phase walk and hit them again.
---
Big Cringe right here
---
"Trans people and dog fuckers are the same"
---
Like wew lad
---
That's true and false
---
Noed is basically the panic button but has several weak points. You'll run 3 perks the whole game which is more impactful for the killer compared to survivors having 3 perks (asymmetrical game) and can be disabled before it even come into play
---
Noed don't need a Nerf but totems need two buffs instead, 1 better place locations since you can find them very easily if you don't tunnel vision just gens and more bp and obj point to incentives survivors to find them
---
Noed at best gives you 1 kill, that's it. If the guy who has noed get more than 1 kill just for that perk is the survivors fault because you are either still trying to save the guy knowing the killer has noed and get mad if getting caught or not playing more careful when you know he has it.
---
I stopped using noed after 1 month of play time for how useless it is. It gets instantly cleansed if it even activates and it's decent only against very unskilled survivors. When I'm against noed I laugh while I cleanse it or notice he had it when it never activated.
---
Noed don't need a Nerf at all, just learn how to play around it since every killer I've seen running it is kinda bad
---

As if I'm a pokemon or something. 
---
*insert *is a snorlax* joke here
---
Aww I love how big her ears are :)
---
M&amp;A, Ruin, BBQ, (Chase, Exposed or Aura perk)
---
16m terror radius when out of chase to give the jump on most unaware survs that don't have LOS.
---
BBQ for aura reading
---
Ruin to slow the game down. 
---
Last perk slot for another aid perk, as Spirit can mindgame at most pallets, using enduring to not respect is a good choice, or using Nurses as you will have a 28m range with a 16m terror radius.
---
Spirit is much easier to hit with than Hillbilly, because she can counter pallets.
---
Also Ash Williams from Ash VS Evil Dead is kind of a thing.
---
I‚Äôd guess they‚Äôd focus on his invulnerability, maybe give him a short period where he can‚Äôt be stunned after activating his power.
---
Wait you actually think spirit is easier to play than Billy? Or is this just a good meme.
---
Monto, hybridpanda, scottjund(streamer), farmer John, noob3
---

---
not kek
---
when you throw up party streamers, get tunneled and killed and the 3 remaining survivors and killer having a farming party.
---
now is on fifth place of most played games on steam
---
thanks!
---
borrowed time is the best counter to camping
---
if you can get people to bring it you have a chance
---
I have a "Savior ash" build "MOM, Borrowed, Urban and sprint burst" meant to take hits for if someone gets camped, urban to sneak to the hook and borrowed to try and counter a tunnel. I've been using it for 3 days and have seen pretty good results, it can probably be tweaked but I like this build very much.
---
Well personally, She‚Äôs probably the killer I enjoy going up against the most because she‚Äôs so easy. But I also use Urban Evasion religiously. Sooo. I think she‚Äôs easily countered tbh, agree with the rest of the list though
---
Intoxicated by Daylight, some Sam Adams and Captain after a BBQ, SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE!
---
That's the exact same build as mine lol. sometimes I like to switch BBQ out with surveillance, mostly if I go with prayer beads bracelet + speed add ons to yeet them off
---
I thought it was ok personally. It‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôll make you want to watch it multiple times but I‚Äôve seen some waaaaaay worse movies, especially in the horror genre.
---
Low effort Legion cosplay.
---
So this list is with any add ons on?
---
Where is the opening? By the mattress?
---
Yea, it definitely still has it's uses, especially for self healing also.
---

---
This is so evil, especially since they might spend ages trying to get 1 totem and then its haunted grounds
---
\*nodding\* too true Arnold is a very beautiful man
---
Seems like a bunch of self centered hive minds  tbh, who cant take anything different then "OOH SHIRTLESS MYERS" or "NEW REWORK IS BAD" Like, your trying to add to the discussion, and you have real life facts, but they downvote you for what reason? Like this is such bullshit and crazy.
---
Why is legion in B? Just curious :P
---
Literally 0 people would run it. Also I just don't like the idea in general.
---
A great day, some fun games of DBD, some drinks and a smoke, BBQ. YESH!
---
*me praying teammates will block hits*
---
Yeah, that's a really good idea!
---
Doc is great for new players. I have 700 hours and still main him. He eliminates stealth which is helpful as I kinda suck at finding survivors and can slow the game down to a crawl especially if you 3-gen giving me extra time to get my work done. 
---
I run Overcharge, (Kick generator to give it a hard skill-check next time survivor works on it) Distressing, (More points and larger terror radius which means larger insanity AOE) Unnerving, (Harder skill checks and more often in my terror radius, which is larger due to distressing and/or calm addons) and BBQ (Aura reveal after hooking a survivor + TONS OF POINTS) 
---
The only teachable perks you'll have to unlock by leveling other killers (or getting lucky with the shrine) for that build is Unnerving (Trapper level 30) and BBQ (Leatherface level 35)
---
No, I would say only brown and maybe a few reasonable yellows.
---
Basically, I‚Äôm not sure what else they could do for him that wouldn‚Äôt be a carbon copy of someone else‚Äôs power. Nurse teleports, Huntress throws hatchets (so no throwing knives), Myers and Ghostface stalk,  and Trapper sets traps.
---
obsession: [sobbing] please don't eat my ass, spirit
---
So LF, Pig, and Clown belong to a lower tier. 
---
Your comment to that mentioned good charge add ons.
---
Yup, it's good that the killer closing the hatch isn't the end all and be all of a match.
---
Dude you criticize yourself too much. I envy your skill mate
---
A single hit kill perk with 4% increased base speed at the end of a game where pallets are gone and fewer survivors remain needs a nerf? Not according to players who have 10 hours in-game. 
---
&gt; Just do totems 
---
Yes and no. Yes when you play with your buddies and call totems count. No when you play solo and rely on other survivors going out of their way for a possibility of this perk presence. 
---
&gt; Just use small game
---
No. SWF dont need it and as a solo you'd spend 5 minutes running around map cleansing totems and hope your team is somewhat reliable and repair generators.
---
&gt; Its an adrenaline/gen rush counter
---
No. Adrenaline is OP but you need to complete objectives to have it activate. NOED rewards you for failing at stopping survivors from achieving their objective. Gen rush happens when you are fixated on a single survivor who's somewhat decent at the game and when you proxy camp the hooks while you know through BBQ that survivors are repairing generators. 
---
&gt; It shouldn't be nerfed until X perk is nerfed
---
Both might be broken but it shouldn't matter which one gets nerfed first, it works both ways.
---
Trying with the capped framerate, I'll update if it solves it.
---
Good charge addons are like primer bulb which isn't like an OP addon
---
Dont worry they're loose guidelines otherwise RainyPug would no longer be a mod
---
I want Dwight in a ‚ÄúKandora‚Äù now
---
*SPLASHES ROCKS IN FACE*
---
*me praying teammates wont block me from running away*
---
You don‚Äôt get to pick and select which add ons a killer has. 
---
All killers get all yellows, or no killers get any yellows.
---
Hillbilly should go down a tier, Leatherface should be below freddy. Myers should probably go down a tier.
---
    One Of These Things (Is Not Like The Others)
---
    One of these things is not like the others,
---
    One of these things just doesn't belong,
---
    Can you tell which thing is not like the others
---
    By the time I finish my song?
---
    
---
    Did you guess which thing was not like the others?
---
    Did you guess which thing just doesn't belong?
---
    If you guessed this one is not like the others,
---
    Then you're absolutely... right!
---
You made me look for Michael Myers stalking in the picture, darn.
---
I love it when they crouch and start nodding at the Killer accepting their demise
---
Yeah, idk where the poor optimization comments are coming from. The game is quite easy to run on most medium and low end pc‚Äôs. You‚Äôll be 100% fine with any high end specs lol
---
I have no idea why this was so satisfying, but it really... really was.
---
This is the devs fault, they said it themselves "not all killers need to be viable at high ranks" so this is what happens.
---
Say what you want, but I think scream is going to be much better than a Freddy rework
---
It's from YouTube version of Mama, which ended up scarier than the full length film.
---
The four are Susie, Julie, Frank, and Joey. Frank is the leader, Joey is the loyal follower, Julie is the unsure follower, and Susie is the unwilling follower. The pink/green hair outfits are Susie, Julie shares the same skins with Frank, but with a female model. Frank is the base skin and the colors revolving around that, and Joey is the one with the skull mask / the new Legion skin.
---
I‚Äôm just wondering who the heck uses a white ward on a green medkit?
---
As a Quentin main, I feel hurt and appreciated by your post at the same time
---
I mean without ruin killers will just get gen rushers and with it you lose ruin in the first 5 seconds especially since everyone is running small game
---
Stall based killers that are as viable as fast downing killers sounds good, matches are wayyy too short
---
I wish I didnt criticize my self üòÇ I always end up changing my art style cause of it.
---
Why is fredman so low? He's is Jesus
---
I plan on drawing all the killer and Mabry even the survivers so you will at one point see a nurse
---
The entit- I mean McCote
---
Thank you^^
---
I‚Äôll definitely place her where Myers and hag are. If she‚Äôs played right she‚Äôs a force to be reckoned with. If survivors don‚Äôt cleanse that‚Äôs better for her cause she‚Äôs still a fast killer.
---
This is a glitch but little did you know, you CAN see a survivor in the locker, they dont disappear after all. Its hard to see but for example if you take Dwight in his white pijamas and hide, you can see his ankles from the bottom part of the locker. Try that and you'll see.
---
&gt;Reminds thread of subreddit rules being completely objective and not biased to one side of the debate or the other.
---
&gt;Gets downvoted.
---
.....seems legit.
---
Nah, sorry, but I don't make exceptions. It's funny, y'see. This happened to me on my first arrest, too. Just come with me to a POW Camp, and we can sort this out sooner rather than later after you apply for a trial.

No such thing as a 100% accurate objective tier list.
---
This is a very smart idea, make dcing like in rust, your character is still there
---
Ya I have hope she will get the buff she deserves, pig is one of the most loved killers in the game so I think they will do her justice after that pretty huge nerf to her.
---
 I cleanse any and all active totems. Good luck everybody else!
---
Hey, at least Quentin has those extra cosmetics he came with- my boy Michael only has the prestige gear, and the mask is the only part of it that I think is worth wearing.

As a wraith main, I agree
---
These same people are saying "gen rush noobs l2p" while never even patrolling in the first place.
---
Ruin needs a buff, right now ruin gets found quickly and gets destroyed and then the killer gets gen rushed but without ruin you lose even quicker and the bad thing for killers is that everyone is running small game to find ruin and gen rush the killer. And right now ruin is the only perk that game slow down gen progression for survivors and it a totem perk so it won't last unless you ha e thrill of the hint but even then you'll proboly be in a chase and have to leave a chase just so that you can protect your totem and its kids sad because survivor run toolboxes with prove thyself making matches even worse for killers and with prove thyself and you and another survivor working on a gen the gen gets done in 40 seconds with ruin at least you can slow that down but not for long so I feel ruin needs a buff at least a small on like slightly increases chance of skill checks
---
Any time he makes a killer perk build he acts as if he was the only one smart enough to think of it dude obviously has a fat ego

Killers don't exploit the game by camping, they exploit player behavior.  There are plenty of reasons why a killer shouldn't actually camp (speed of gens getting done and loss of bp/rank points), and the only reason why they do is because *survivors* make it viable.  
---
Getting camped sucks.  I roll my eyes at every camper, but I rage at every survivor that doesn't check to see the camper because they're the ones feeding this play style.  
---
You are using a system that was designed to not punish players for technical issues to not be punished leaving a game against a playstyle that you find to be bullshit.  That's an exploit.
---
Camping is no more an exploit than P3 Claudettes playing 'immersed'.  I'm not arguing that they should remove it despite it only really working against bad opponents and a asshole move towards your opponent(s).
---
His hallowed blight cosmetic
---
Wow, Jim Carrey as Egg Man looks good
---
Knowing BHVR's track record, they'll backpeddle on the nerf and make a change that buffs it instead.
---
It does make some places brighter, which is why a lot of people have their quality set to low
---
Keep in mind that they can hear your whoosh when outside your terror radius. This means that monitor works against grabs and nurse's. While it does make you quite stealthy as a basic killer, those downsides are a bit too detrimental imo.
---
Sorry I am not up to date. I'm going based off of old-school terminology from the community.
---
It's the Same survivors run with 3 perks when they run adrenaline...  
---
I just dont like noed.. I've had whole teams go down because of noed.
---
I'm going to write you another follow up just to be clear. If it's a normal match and the killer is legitimately using camping involved in a strategy that's fine. That's understandable. If the first thing they do in a match is hook me and stay there until I die and everyone else completes gens and escape then this person is either ignorant or they are a troll and it involves no strategy.
---
but why? what did he do?
---
Will do see you soon!

No matter how many proven facts people give you you just don‚Äôt give a shit. I would warn anyone trying to talk to OP, they won‚Äôt listen.

Megs and Dwights are my favorite ones :)
---
Sure, but what does that have to do w/ MoM being op? I'm just curious why you think its OP?
---
Yeah but you're still going it as an in game haha
---
I believe it was just a glitch, when Dwight opens the locker the bars 'snap shut' like they normally look
---
I love that movie, and recommend it to everyone who wants to see a good slasher movie parody!
---
Source?
---
Guys, it's called Level of Detail models, and this an instance of them messing up.  You see, when you're far away from an object, in order to make things less taxing on your hardware, games will switch to a lower-poly (less-detailed) object.  You can see this on a few of Meg's hair and Claudette's accessories - get right up to a wall and look at Claudette's hoop earrings or Meg's hair, you'll see its smooth.  Walk away from a wall, Claudette suddenly sports octagon earrings and meg's hair starts to look like weaved diamonds, because the models are switching to lower quality models.
---
Up close, the lockers are supposed to be detailed, but something is wrong with the lockers LOD models - it's not updating to the high poly versions up close, allowing you to see inside :/  Level of Detail models usually aren't animated, so thats why it switched back to the normal ones when Dwight leaves the locker.  Fun Factoid:  This is why when you see the auras of survivors wearing flowing clothes / dresses from far away, they aren't moving - LOD skirts / long shirts / coats aren't animated, so they're static.
---
It's a little gay, so is your use of the phrase "uncultured swine"

This gif
---
I disagree. While it's very strong I don't think it's OP. Like damn near every killer can just outright ignore it and as an Ash main I can say I'll be lucky if it goes of once every 2 matches.
---
Reboot Jason would be nice, he was fucking terrifying. He was highly intelligent, strong, laid traps, and scariest of all would fucking sprint at you.
---
Freddy has been awful for so long I just hope he‚Äôs at least vislbe

If survivors can hear your heartbeat and it hasn't changed tempo for like 2-3 seconds, they definitely should move, and if you are going against competent survivors, they will move.
---
Thanks g it‚Äôs part of the game

---
Dude...I kinda hope you're just doing the survivor meme at this point :/
---
Yeah, unfortunately the spookiest stuff takes up maybe 3 or so minutes of the movie. And the story is much more emotionally wrenching than horrifying. 
---
"Mama" is freaking terrifying though when she does show up. Someone needs to remake it in a more pure horror fashion frankly.
---
Im running at a steady 170+ fps on ultra. Never have any spikes or anything. I will say, on that new snow map, I get lowered fps at 140+

Word of advice on this subreddit. Nobody cares that you dislike a perk. If you care that much, go do totems.
---
Oh, I was **not** saying he *should* have DC'd, I'm just saying why he probably did it. I can't wait either.
---
Good thing I'm a nea main, she tiny
---
&gt;I disagree. While it's very strong I don't think it's OP. Like damn near every killer can just outright ignore it and as an Ash main I can say that I'll be lucky if it goes off once every 2 matches.
---
First chase you are guaranteed to have 2 hits / stacks against Trapper, Wraith, Nurse, Doctor, Leatherface, Pig, Spirit, Clown, Freddy and Hag (10 out of 15 killers). 
---
If you know how to play, you can also guarantee 2 stacks against Huntress and Billy (2 out of 5 killers). Against Myers it will depend whether or not he has EW3 ready to go when he starts chasing you (1 out of 3).
---
The only killers that can reliably deny 2 stacks during every chase is Plague and Legion. 
---
I firmly say this because I've been using MoM nonstop since release. 
---
Doesn't look like "every killer can just outright ignore it".

Noed is fine. Ever since they added the exposed effect to tier 1, we all knew it would be in play far more often. As a result, you should always assume it's in play. Just like you should always assume BBQ and Nurse's.
---
Noed can be seen as a time wasting perk in a way. If you don't break totems, it punishes you. But breaking all totems wastes time. But since it's so prevalent, most groups will try to break them unless they can identify 4 perks during the game.
---
The best solution that is needed (particularly for non-swf) that I've seen suggested, is a counter on our screen showing the remaining totems on the map.
---
It is parody of the Cinemasins intro, and many people use it in similar ways to his. What's you're problem man
---
A lot there are now many more maps, survivors and killers, including movie characters like leatherface, ash and micheal Myers. New ingame cosmetic shop and an endgame where you have a limited amount of time to escape once the gates are open.
---
Definitely testing this!!  üëÄ
---
A single perk that gives 4% speed and one hit survivors.
---
Adrenaline can heal 4 people at once and give them a burst in speed
---
The perk rewards bad pressure. Yes it does but noed gives at most 1 kill. That's it, unless the rest of the team keep running around. Has several counters and the awful positioning of totems make it easy to deny that
---
You won't spend 5 min to cleanse totems if you just look around while looking for gens, usually are not too far away. Plus as I already said on another comment, you can also go more stealthy and look for the hex.
---
Totems should get better positioning over all and give more bp and obj points to incentives the cleanse.
---
As a solo survivor I find noed so useless, sometimes it hits me and I'm fine with it as long my team leave, the problem is over altruism that becomes entitlement most of the time and leads on more than one kill due to survivors stupidity
---
Rarely see decent killers run noed, it gets denied so often and I stopped using it way before the QoL changes for that reason. Run 3 perks the whole game and also be denied it's effect makes you think twice before using it again
---
Nerfs should be applied to perks that has no counters first. I still see people crying about BBQ when it has almost 9 counters which 4/5 are perkless..
---
I won't see the same thing happen to every perk just to please lazy survivors or who won't adapt to changes. I'd rather see MoM nerfs first and some buffs on very useless perks like monstrous shrine and left behind that are forgotten as well as many others
---
Noed is in a good spot, at least for the new players that uses it and play against it makes the game more thrilling, something that will be lost anyway with few more hours into the game
---
That's fine. You dont have to call it a exploit but you are still adding in variables that arent even apart of my scenario. It's not even a scenario that happens a lot. It's a rare thing that I get downed first then camped and never rescued. You think people dcing is wrong so you arent listening to what I'm saying. You just lumped this all up into one category when it's not. If the match isnt fair for me then I'm going to leave. I shouldn't have to do this exploit to make the game fair. That's what you arent seeing. I'm not saying it's right I'm saying I dont feel bad when I do because this and that happened. It's also stupid that I make builds around being able to counterplay this strategy instead of making builds that are actually beneficial.
---
You can finish leveling up Meg all the way to level 40 and stop there.
---
Afterwards, start leveling Claudette for self-care and you will probably encounter Meg's perks in your way to Claudette 40. 
---
At this point you must choose which character you want to main and also decide whether or not you want to Prestige 3 it.
---
It all depends on what you‚Äôre trying to do and with which Killer. Not all perks are good on all Killers. That said, the Spirit has the best perks in my opinion with the Legion, Clown and Plague after I. That order
---
Thanks for stealing my OC, I bet you're real proud you got to hot
---
‚Ä¶¬†Can you take me higher?¬†
---
To the place where blind men see. 
---
My personal motto or creed is: no matter how bad things are, they would definitely be worse if a creed song was playing.
---
He‚Äôs fat and difficult to juke lol and his bottles messing up my vision. I hate playing against him because I can‚Äôt run him for long. I need to get better, but I don‚Äôt know how.
---
It would be nice if they buff the perk small game, increase cleansing speed by 15% or something.
---
im hurt
---
Legion has Discordance.
---
And that's an old middle schooler but i think the joke landed ;P
---
Thank you üñ§
---
Yesss, trying to make my thirst contagious.
---
Bubba sucks overall. He has a speed reduction when he revs up his chainsaw, maps covered with crap to block him with, not to mention that most decent loop spots prevent him from using his chainsaw if you run it right. If and when he actually gets to use his chainsaw, I'd say he deserves it. Except when he's been camping the entire game and gets his kills that way.
---
Yeah true haha they were teabagging at the exit and it gave me time to get to tier 3 so I downed those two and they DCed
---
I really like to play as Myers, I'm thinking maybe just picking the one that seems most fun to play rather than perks
---
I know everyone says to just cleanse totems and all but some maps are not easy to memorize all the possible totem spots. I‚Äôve been playing for a long time and I really only know all the spots on like half the maps. This isn‚Äôt the most popular opinion but it can‚Äôt be expected that in SoloQ everyone will cleanse every totem.
---
You are definitely right! I think I spend too much time stalking.
---
For perspective the achievement for killing 25 total survivors, Blood in Your Mouth, only has 3.5% completion. Blood on Your Face (kill all 4 survivors in a single match) only has 3.7% completion.
---
Discordance and Spirit Fury are the two best.
---
The gameüò•
---
if you like playing myers then get spirit for spirit fury, enduring+spirit fury is good for any m1 killer.
---
Its actualy .1% lol.
---
ye, thats probably because Moris are at least somewhat rare
---
How? I get a solid 60-62. Does not change anywhere outside of that. I have a 2080 and 9700k.
---
*boop the pig*
---
Thrill, Ruin, HG and Devour with prayer beads and mother daughter ring on the game map works pretty well. Can do most maps but the smaller the better.
---
Bloodhound on a killer that can‚Äôt see blood when using her power?
---
This can happen due to how certain engines handle settings. Swapping to a lower quality settings could swap some things over from GPU to CPU, which in most cases is worse.
---
He's...too fast? What? He only moves faster when cloaked, and he has to slow down to uncloak, and he gets a small speed boost out of cloak. But aside from that, he's nothing special. You just need to get better at chases, and your team needs to get better at focusing on gens so what damage Wraith does do will be all for not.
---
You boop the pig you die.
---
DIE
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm talking about! Maps like The Game &amp; Haddonfield require you to have a lot of coordination and luck to get every single totem before the match is done...
---
I only have one Commodius and I dont want to lose it from an unlucky game.
---
Alright I got her. Thanks pal
---
Fucking what? They were about to escape and then quit? I think that was something they planned honestly.
---
Christ. I guess that's just another accolade to carry with me as a Clown main.
---
You don't need moris for either.
---
Damn sounds like an excuse to hide how mad you are lol
---
DL and Sloppy do separate things. Thanatophobia stacks with both of them with their action speed reduction.
---
There have been more adept freddys than smoked lol. Kinda depressing if you think about it
---
For a while I would run Prove Thyself and Small Game on my survivors just for the explicit purpose of countering Hex: Ruin and NOED, which seemed to be in every game.
---
And in most cases when you‚Äôre trying to be stealthy you‚Äôre crouched making the differences kinda obsolete
---
Clown, Myers, Freddy. Though I do switch it up to play for dailies.
---
Its on google
---
They can't, the devs are all killer mains.
---
Understood have a good day
---
Good to see that they stayed in the game.  Whenever I get hits like that.  The person DC‚Äôs.  Which is a shame because 7/10 times.  They‚Äôre a fluke.
---
Haha it's amazing killer gets greedy and it smacks them in the face.
---
10/10 advice
---
Pig and cannibal are only Buyable not earnable.
---
I have Pig already and I really wanna get Bubba
---
Keys are exclusively Rare or ultra-rare, and frequently need to be combined with rare addons to boot.  For comparison, the killer's green Mori is far less conditional and more powerful ALL the time.
---
And having a key is basically giving up your item slot (A very powerful slot on survivors) for that exclusively endgame power.  Power that can FULLY be denied to them with something like Franklins.  Only an ultra-rare key can be useful and is still fully addon dependent to be useful outside of hatch situations.
---
And the update was to make the end of the game actually END.  That is why it is called the END GAME collapse.   It wasn't to make it so the killer automatically got a kill if they found the survivor.  It was to put the survivor on a time crunch to GTFO, and the hatch rework was to make it so that stalemates were no longer a thing where the person who went last won.
---
The endgame collapse is 100% killer sided right now, and the overall endgame state is about 80% killer sided.
---
I AM ALSO STRUGGLING DOING A HEALING DAILY. I'VE BEEN AT 1/3 FOR FOUR GAMES.
---
HAD A NURSE DC WHEN SHE HAD 1 KILL (SUICIDE ON HOOK) &amp; 1 PERSON ON DEATHHOOK, THEN HAD A HAG TUNNEL ME FROM THE JUMP AFTER A FENG MIN MISSED A SKILLCHECK ON THE GEN WE WERE DOING, AND FINALLY HAD A PERMA-TIER-3 TOMBSTONE MYERS WHO HIT NOBODY UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO TOMBSTONE AWAY.
---
So because your teammates suck the perk isn‚Äôt OP? That‚Äôs like me saying DS is F tier because I can never hit the skill check.
---
This happened today! I thought she was going to close it which was why I was hesitant to reveal my location, but as soon as I saw her hesitating, I booked it
---
The survivors should have talked from the beggining to be honest. Nothing crazy but some voice lines here and there, maybe some special interactions with other survivors. It would actually give them some personality if they were to talk instead of them being a grunting brick wall.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
I had terrible frames and blurriness until I switched to true fullscreen. For some reason, DBD launches default as windowed, just stretched fullscreen. This can cause FPS problems and quality problems. If you edit the .ini file (which should not get you banned) and add "-FULLSCREEN" to the launch options in steam, you should get crystal clear quality and high framerate.
---
OP stole it probably from google images. Karma whoring at it's finest but that's reddit for ya.
---
This goes for game and many other things to be honest. I constantly hear people say "well, the story is irrelevant and therefore your argument of not liking the game is irrelevant".
---
I think Killers should be tweaked with each new bundle of content that comes out to keep them overall viable, but not necessarily empowered.
---
It was just okay.
---
The game his an in-built V-sync. Won't go over 60, unless you go to the files and remove it.
---
My point is, it still requires 3 hits, which can be enough to end you, the only people who thinks its op are killer mains who cant end the chase, never bothered me as killer, just an extra hit for extra bloodpoints.
---
Uhhh nothing wrong with adrenaline
---
Have a link or can you explain how to do that?
---
Isn't he the tallest survivor?
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think any of them should speak. It kills the immersion factor of the game. They should only be grunting, squealing and screaming victims of the entity realm. 
---
And yeah he‚Äôs creepy af
---
Lerys also... so many rooms to search... I hate looking on the game map. They changed them so much I can hardly find 1 anymore.

You have missed the Legion, an annoying killer to go against  (Their perks being discordance, which lets you see the aura of generators that have 2 or more survivors on it, Iron maiden, which increases his locker opening speed, lets you see survivors that leave lockers, and puts the exposed status effect on then for a few seconds, and Mad Grit, which lets you swing your weapon without a cool-down while carrying a survivor and pauses the carried survivor's wiggle timer for a few seconds) , and the Plague, a mid tier killer in terms of killer (Her perks being dark devotion, an obsession perk that makes your obsession emit a terror radius for twenty seconds while making yours go to zero, infectious fright, which makes survivors within a radius of you yell and reveal their location whenever you down another survivor, and corrupt intervention, which blocks off three gens farthest from you for the first two minutes of the trial). In terms of survivors, you have missed the Decisive nerf (can only be used for a certain time after being unhooked, basically an anti-tunnel perk now), The NEW meta perk, Mettle of Man, or MoM (lets you take an additional hit in the injured state after getting hit three times beforehand with a M1 attack), and Jeff Johansen (perks being breakdown, a perk that breaks the hook you were on  after being unhooked and shows you the killer's aura for a brief amount of time, Aftercare, which lets you see the Aura of survivors you rescued or healed a health state or the other way around, and distortion, which hides your aura from the killer when it would be shown for a certain amount of time, up to three times a match), Jane Romero (perks being Solidarity, which lets you heal at a certain rate while healing another survivor, Poised, which hides scratch marks after completing a gen for a period of time, and Head On, which after being in a locker for three seconds, lets you stun the killer if they are within a certain radius of the locker and you leave it quickly, for three seconds), and Ash Williams (perks being Buckle Up, a perk that lets you see the aura of the killer whenever you heal someone from the dying state, Flip Flop, which turns 50% of your recovery progression into wiggle progression, and Mettle of Man, which I have already mentioned). You have also missed the End-game collapse, which is a timer after the killer closes the hatch or the survivor opens an exit gate where the survivors have to get out of the map in two minutes of be killed by the Entity. You have also missed several leaks for the nest killer, Ghostface (His only leaked perk being a perk called simple formula, an obsession based perk where each time you hit your obsession, you gain a token that decreases your terror radius by four meters. The obsession status can be transferred to anyone ho saves the obsession from a hook.  That's everything MAJOR you have missed.
---
I wouldn't be surprised, but if they are close enough to the exit to escape, there is still no reason to quit. Even if one person gets picked up, the other can still escape.
---
Which part
---
But he saw it somewhere!
---
Survivor main here and I know nurse is difficult to play. I think instead of a nerf a rework would be better. There should be some way to defend yourself against a god tier nurse,
---
Killer was going for a slug, which makes perfect sense at this point as there are 4 survivors alive and 1 gen left, unfortunately for them, the last survivor had the last gen at 99%.

neither with noed, they basically have the same power
---
With the hatch spawning no matter how many generators are left and End Game Collapse blocking them off if the killer finds the hatch first, there‚Äôs no situation where Left Behind is a viable perk even with the ‚Äú‚Äùbuff‚Äù‚Äù.
---
Idk it might not work after end game patch, but I know it definitely worked before. There is no reason for it not to work in dying state anymore imo
---
The killer makes a smart decision when all the survivors are grouped around him but then that all gets undone because of a perk. That shit should not be in the game.
---
thats the amulet, the blossom is for passive phasing
---
Freddy has no defense and his chases are long. Any solo-survivor rank 10 or above knows how to punish him.
---
Lol all the excuses and justifications for it are just bad. It's simply a perk for killers to have a crutch with whether they are salty after a few bad games, want to just trigger people, they are bad at playing killer or the killer is just weaker. It's not a counter to any other perk or "gen rush" at all.
---
Bc they're not supposed to do gens obviously!!
---
Bro I hate this clip so much just because of the flashlight save, that makes me mad when it happens
---
Wait. Why were you instadowned? This whole video is confusing
---
For survivor, work on gens, always go for unhookes if you can, and be nice to the killer and your fellow teammates. For killer, don‚Äôt stay by the hook, and don‚Äôt go after the same person right after they get off the hook. It‚Äôs just rude.

All you need is the IP that the game provides. Take it easy on him though, he's for sure a young adult or child who just learned about computers. Also update your dam router/modem! Modern gear should not even be remotely vulnerable to some kid's packet spam. Are you on DSL or something? I seriously doubt the kid's older friends let him borrow an actual botnet, or the money for one, so you can most likely prevent this by using good equipment.
---
Edit: Or play through a proxy or VPN, but you'll have to pay for a low-latency one if you want to play games over it
---
You‚Äôre literally selling your time and effort.  Which isn‚Äôt worth much.
---
NOED also gives a haste bonus. If you're in the middle of a chase it can help you catch back up and down them as if they were injured before adrenaline popped.
---
I wouldn't call it a counter per-say, but they stand on equal footing of being a huge end game crutch perk. (Which y'kno, nothing wrong with crutches.)
---
I can see it being considered a counter to Adrenaline in the sense that it‚Äôll insta-down you no matter what health state you‚Äôre in, but I doubt it was created with Adrenaline in mind, specifically.
---
I legitimately didn't know urban evasion was considered a crutch perk
---
He can Tbag at survivor speed
---
I use current hardware/software, I'm not a novice with computing. Plus my roommate is an IT. He agrees it is probably a DoS from some crybaby I matched with.
---
He has throwing knives now, huh...
---
Honestly, that‚Äôd take my average teammate multiple games
---
Iron will and urban? You created a strawman with meh perks just so the meme will make sense. 2/10.
---
Meme dedicated to the camping Spirit in the last game. She'd move just far enough away from the hook so that Borrowed Time wouldn't activate and would then phase straight to the hook and tunnel whoever was unhooked.
---
When the last Survivor escaped through the hatch the Spirit called them out for using "worthless noob urban evasion lol" and "iron will is 50/50 rarely useful."
---
The Survivors then pointed out that she was running Barbeque, Ruin, Sloppy, and NOED and was also hard camping the whole game. She DCed immediately after they said that.
---
Today has been fine. I haven't played DBD in the last couple days, I've been pet sitting the whole weekend. I'm finally back home, &amp; i hope i'll get the urge to play soon i'm feeling bleh rn.
---
It‚Äôs really not.. at least I don‚Äôt consider it to be.
---
If that's true, oh lawd.
---
Apparently every game we have time to look for every totem to cleanse to counter noed. Its not like we're running from a killer or doing gens or anything.
---
I use low because I hate their AA that just makes the game blurry. If that was a seperate setting then I'd go higher.
---
She didn't even have a key in her loadout.

Bruh that's fucking broken

All perks are crutch perks if they belong to Survivors ffs No Mither so OP lets you hide your bloodstains get off the ground whenever you're slugged üò§

We know exactly how Ghostface's power works, we know next to nothing about Freddy's rework.
---
If only there were four of you?
---
&gt;Strawman
---
I actually had a camping Spirit tell ~~me~~ my SWF ally that they were trash for using Iron Will and Urban. When they told them that they were using Ruin and BBQ they left the lobby. I don't have screenshots because they were camping and I DCed on the hook because I'm not going to lose my items to some Rank 20 proxy camper.
---
who calls it a trapdoor rofl it's the hatch
---
Not if it's a wraith which it usually is in my experiences
---
That shit is so toxic, whenever someone does that to me I facecamp the shit out of them
---
People can have disagreements as to whatever else regarding trans people, but to whether they are people there is no question.  Damned be those that think them as less than so.
---
Even then, time is better spent working on gens instead of scouting for totems, if all four survivors are alive when noed pops, you can easily save someone who got downed from noed, assuming they aren‚Äôt dead on hook. Noed is a crutch perk, and even then it doesn‚Äôt guarantee a sacrifice
---
Logic?
---
I had this happen to me when I was playing killer but I ended up dcing
---
Well it‚Äôs statistically not very reflective that it is the cure.  But this really isn‚Äôt the place to discuss this stuff
---
I never understood: what the fuck is a Boomer?
---
Like that one jacksfilms kermit song. ‚ÄúNothing makes me happier than dreaming about your corpse.‚Äù
---
I'm saying that using an exploit over something as petty as a playstyle that you dislike is wrong.
---
Would you still dc if you lost your items and pips over this?
---
You're right, I don't see camping as unfair.  There are obvious and easy ways around it without having to change your builds but it requires an adjustment of playstyle from survivors.  
---
The survivor community as a whole has shown that they don't want to change how they play, which is why you still have survivors running to a hook not looking out for that camping killer, which makes it a successful strategy.
---
I didn't know at first if it was a bug in DbD so that's why I posted here. I know it was a DoS now so now I'm just in the wrong board for it.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trans phobic person, so who cares‚Äù
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt really think he‚Äôs a person too (assuming it‚Äôs a he).  Ironic.
---
But it‚Äôs only one health state, and considering the killer is probably still there, they could have gotten one or two back down again. This isn‚Äôt stupidly broken, its just unfortunate for the killer
---
In comparison I‚Äôve seen The Thing 1982 multiple times.  Great film that.
---
Always gotta be honorable and stay in the game, thats my motto. I‚Äôve DC‚Äôd only one time, and it was because of a basement camping bubba I was in no mood to deal with

NO YOUR GONNA DIE
---
Oink indeed
---
Yea, the fact that the offering is burned at the start is so stupid.
---
Yeah, how totally surprising that someone would get pissed off at a taunt. 
---
Completely unheard of.
---
Oh kinda like noed when you remain unscathed until the end then get insta downed
---
No? Trans people don't do anything wrong, transphobic people are wrong.
---
Yeah, let's not discuss it as soon as you point out that's it's totally statistically not effective
---
It helps when it‚Äôs made by one of the best to ever do it lol
---
I unironically zoomed into the background to find Myers hiding, only to see he was in the foreground all along.
---
I‚Äôm a fucking idiot
---
Just go into steam purchase history and tally up everything you spent on DBD
---
And if survivors stopped feeding the camping killers, that specific strategy would be even more limited to lower ranks, but they don't stop feeding them.
---
Despite it not taking any skill and requires survivors making mistakes, it's a strategy.  A poor one to use exclusively, but a strategy none the less. The definition of a strategy is:  a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim.  Camping falls under this.

---
It depends on how well you play the bloodweb. If you get it to consume whole branches you can get a prest 50 level for as little as 25-30k. 
---
 Rules:
---
-If there's an available slot, the entity will always continue to consume where it is rather than transferring to a new area with exceptions. 
---
-If there is no perk to consume, the entity starts on the furthest out and most expensive item/offering/box.
---
-If it has a choice between locking off a tree or consuming something that leaves the tree open, it will always try to leave the tree open. If you've ever seen those big bunny ear shaped paths, that's why it goes the long way round. 
---
-The entity HATES to complete the web itself. Faced with locking off a path (thus ending the web) and consuming a lone common, it will always pick the common. It will only complete the web if forced. 
---
-The entity spawns after either the first perk is purchased, or after 4 items have been purchased. 
---
When you take the time to look logically at a bloodweb, you can use these rules to determine which perk is better to go for, and how to get the entity to do all the work for you. It's often more advantageous to go down an expensive solo path than it is to consume a common that might have locked off 9-10 more items. 
---
This post grew a bit bigger than I intended so I'm going to make it a standalone comment but leave it here as well for you.

---
Feelsbadman, I wish there was more we could do against this shit, but there really isn‚Äôt. The only time a killer and survivor should get along is when the killer is just in general friendly, which I will occasionally do to get dailies done.
---
Except NOED can be countered by cleansing totems and you can dodge hits...Oh, lets not forget how even if you're on hook or on the killers shoulder Adrenaline will STILL proc and isn't even affected by the exhaustion cooldown, because fuck balance right?
---
Make it affected by exhaustion and remove its ability to be 'stored' while on hook/shoulder and it'll be in line with the rest of the game's perks.
---
thank you for all the suggestions guys, I appreciate it
---
(probably cause of adrenaline)
---
What can I say? Some people are stupid.
---
Seems fine to me, if the killer hadn‚Äôt been greedy it might have gone a different way. Adrenaline is perfectly fine. The only way it works is if you get all 5 gens done so think about it.
---
She got lucky and found one in a chest. Big deal.
---
I personally don‚Äôt agree with that, because it can be sided towards either party, it just relies on a lil luck, but mainly the circumstances when egc activates. Like, if it activates by a survivor opening a gate, its a bit more survivor sided, but killer can still get a sacrifice or two, but if its activated by killer closing hatch on the last survivor, its a bit sided to killer, but its still possible for that last survivor to open a gate and leave. I‚Äôve been in the closed hatch scenario and still escaped, it just takes a bit of luck and knowing how to hide from the gate patrolling killer.
---
The devs didn't want to fix it amidst end game bugs, so they buffed the numbers and are planning on coming back to it later. You can use it if the killer tries to camp you out by watching the hatch and waiting for you to come and try to jump in before closing, but that's it, and that's rare AF.
---
Make sure the other players report as well (remind them in chat). Sometimes I will show mercy to a surv, but teaming up and ruining everyone else's game is a **big** no-no and a bannable offense. So sad to see someone bending the Good Doctor to perform such heinous acts.
---
Bring on the downvotes, but, while I am normally very against DC, I do support it in a situation where there is *for sure* a bannable offence occurring (not just assuming that there is, though, so be careful with that).
---
sent
---
There is also the fact that killer being able to close hatch negates hatch standoffs, which were mainly determined by what health state the last survivor was in, healthy = they‚Äôll get out, injured = rip survivor
---
Yeah me too but it's more often sidded to killer I find but maybe I'm just not lucky lol
---
COMMA DO YOU WANT DIE?!
---
Thank god, someone with a bit of sense in this thread.
---
True I never liked stand offs
---
I was waiting for Encounter to play and was not disappointed.
---
ClassicüòÇ didn‚Äôt mean to step on your meme
---
Saying she‚Äôs a whore because of how she‚Äôs dressed... that‚Äôs fucked, you know that, right?
---
K sorry didn't realize there were rules upon rules on this site, maybe you should keep your suggestions to yourself and let me know I broke rules 3 and 8 that's all...
---
No no worries! It‚Äôs good to see yours getting attention
---
It wasn‚Äôt the same post and this one makes more sense
---
**b o o p**
---
Okay, that‚Äôs unfortunate for the killer, but its also just a risk when theres one gen left? I‚Äôm sorry, but this argument still doesn‚Äôt convince me the perk is ‚Äòstupid broken‚Äô. Even if the survivors are a bit grouped up like that to be slugged, it was still a bit greedy when there was only one gen left, and the killer‚Äôs gambit didn‚Äôt pay off. That‚Äôs all it is, and its all it will be.
---
The only thing enjoyable about playing against Billy is his stupid little missed-attack animation. Comes swinging in and then just *whack* against a piece of wood.
---
It‚Äôs not holding the game hostage if the game will end at some point and the only way for people to leave it is DCing. Unless the only way you can leave a game is DCing then it isn‚Äôt holding the game hostage
---
May 31 on the dev stream, probably
---
This is good! Please just re-upload with the volume lower, this literally blew my eardrums clean out.
---
I only DC if I get cross mapped by someone‚Äôs M1  that‚Äôs lag I can‚Äôt be bothered to deal with. I‚Äôm used to campers.  Tunnellers. All that crap as that pretty much 60% of the game at this point and it‚Äôs beginning to get easier to counter.
---
This is not the proper forum for this. Try r/DBDTrade. Read the rules there too though, I've never been there and I don't know if selling steam accounts is allowed.
---
who's shittin in the tall grass is my favourite
---
Why? It‚Äôs fun.
---
I never said Kate was a whore.
---
Very cute! Huntress is my favorite killer
---
Then are you referencing what someone else said..?
---
Holy crap, I just had a match where everything just clicked. I was predicting exactly where people were going while phasing, my fake- outs were flawless and I was grabbing people off my totem. The last two living people just gave up and offered me their tool boxes. I let them farm a bit and finished them off. She is a monster as I suspected. I'll just need time to learn to play this well consistently. She's incredibly rewarding and fun though.
---
His energy is oddly intoxicating
---
I am talking about how the user flair ‚ÄúKate the whore‚Äù exists. It‚Äôs so mean, she‚Äôs not a whore. She‚Äôs a sweet good-natured person as it says in her backstory.
---
LMFAOOOO THE ACCURACY
---
Except Adrenaline isn't a crutch perk. You have to earn Adrenaline, Noed is something ur given
---
I'm sorry I came off sounding like a dick, this is just very frustrating to me in general (it's not just you). The rules are over on the right side somewhere. Have a great day man and I'll see you in the fog (metaphorically at least, I'm on PC).
---
This is key. Can't upvote more. Fuck borderless
---
You should stay around the gate to take hits if someone else is unhooking them, unless its a killer like Billy or T3 myers cuz you dont wanna go down. Just stay there so you can distract the killer for a chance for others to save the hooked person. If no one is hooked, just leave.
---
Nah it's ok , I doubt I can do better lol
---
The killer could be running Bamboozle? But it wouldn't activate unless they vault the window
---
Sorta. The more survivors that are gone, the more likely the killer is to camp the survivor at endgame. Even being at viewing distance of killer is beneficial as it helps draw killer attention away while another survivor goes for the save. Only time I leave while someone is hooked is if I‚Äôm rancor exposed since I literally can‚Äôt do anything about that.
---
I think some things were a definite nerf and overall hurt him more than helped him. Primarily, sliding over pallets takes so long that you may as well have broken it by the time the animation finishes. Outside of that, everything else was pretty much changed in response to the most annoying things about legion, or just straight up broke the intended gameplay(Moonwalking and spam-lunging were both unintended. THe lunge was faster than just sprinting). The stun timer increasing from 3 seconds to 4 also means that you spend a ton of time just groaning as they cover a great deal of distance, meaning your initial guaranteed first-hit, kind of goes to waste
---
The answer is that it depends.
---
* If you are not in a chase, you can vault it infinitely.
---
* If you are in a chase, and you stay in the chase through all of your vaults, it is 3 vaults.
---
* If the killer has the perk Bamboozle (A teachable perk from the Clown), if the killer vaults the window they block it for all survivors temporarily. 
---
What you are most likely getting is that they are escaping the chase and that resets their vault counter, letting them vault over again.
---
Yes
---
I didn't wanna be too antagonistic about it, but yeah.
---
I mean, if you look at stereotypes, a lot say that tall people are buff in some form of way. Of course false, it is a bit more common than some people think.
---
Freddy mains Unite
---
well when you compare it to at the time a 40 second recharge on Sprint Burst you got without needing to stop to recover from exhaustion, it was really useless, in fact most of them were.
---
Having an entire perk relying on a single moment in the game on it working or not made it really underpowered in the grand scheme of things.
---
I think it‚Äôs interesting at least. You can stun them once but if they catch you again you will get mori killed anyway. May buy some time. Kinda like DS May save you but probably won‚Äôt. I like it as a niche perk.
---
Infinite on dropped pallets and 3 on windows, there used to be a bug where if the window gets infected it didn't entity block it
---
ha i get it cuz jake failed school
---
If we could get a nerf on the mideivil french I don't think he'd be too OP.
---
Same! Shes my main
---
The counterplay is that they are weaker, and it is easier for you to kill them all.  And if you pay attention in the camp screen you can look for if a survivor is using a key.  If you see them using it, you just make sure you kill that specific survivor early on.
---
Keys for the most part are a last chance, or an endgame alternative to the gates.
---
NO COMMA YOUR GONNA KILL US ALL
---
Watch the short version on youtube. It trims a lot of the fat.
---
The movie had some creepy moments, but was more about relationships, parenting, and sad stuff.
---
Imagine disconnecting because survivors are just doing what they're supposed to do
---
Her and the plague are mine! I mostly play those two,  but if i want to be different i play wraith or freddy
---
Easier to sympathise with the one lone msn rather than 4 people I suppose.
---
&gt;Guess I should have just outplayed him
---
Or maybe literally just catch back up and hit again, it isn‚Äôt hard
---
&gt;Pretty close to hugging
---
20 seconds is a real long time to keep someone on the ground, not only is that risking adrenaline, but possible unbreakable too. Oh, but I guess that‚Äôs broken to you too, being a second chance perk, and the killer shouldn‚Äôt have any risk at all, right?
---
All in all, what i‚Äôm getting from your arguments is that, as killer, you should be able to make plays like a tripple slug with absolutely no risk or repercussions just because the survivors happened to be grouped together. Theres absolutely no situation the survivors would normally be grouped together and not be idiots, no possible way they were just all on a gen and/or healing. And since they were together, the killer should get sacrifices handed to him. Did I just about summarize this correctly?
---
I main huntress and a bit of hag. But im usualy the surviver üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Hag / Legion / Spirit
---
Whoever applies I wish the best!
---
Looks like 663k people have a fuck so idk I guess you‚Äôre just jealous or something making a post like this. Really no point.
---
I was struggling on the hook so I had to film on my phone while spamming space
---
Aftercare isn't A tier tho? It's thebultimate buddy system!
---
They both activate automatically. You earn neither of them.
---
Op, why are you gay?
---
*sees urban in B* ‚ÄúOh...so you‚Äôre one of those
---
also these guys definitely weren't normal level 16s or 14s
---
It's not like I'm writing the PTB patch notes. Chill.
---
Lmao
---
I actually just replied to another post talking about how my biggest regret is leveling killers for 1 perk. Get nurses now. Otherwise, you‚Äôll have invest time to get it through teachables and then have to deal with Thanataphobia and Stridor appearing in bloodwebs for killers when it could have been another perk. Aka the more perks you unlock as teachable, the longer you have to play the RNGesus game on killers you actually want a certain perk on.
---
No, it would be in C if it wasn't for the Hag.
---
&gt; Or maybe literally just catch back up and hit again, it isn‚Äôt hard
---
Yeah apart from the fact that it can extend the chase for at minimum 20 seconds longer, even longer if they find a good loop/pallet, then their other second chance perks can trigger, which becomes even more hard when all 4 survivors run it. Also I can't exactly catch up to them and hit them again when they are running to the exit gate, with the amount of delay I get and speed they get meaning they get out for free. No survivor should get out for free because of a perk.
---
&gt; 20 seconds is a real long time to keep someone on the ground, not only is that risking adrenaline, but possible unbreakable too. Oh, but I guess that‚Äôs broken to you too, being a second chance perk, and the killer shouldn‚Äôt have any risk at all, right?
---
Only one guy would've been able to get up with Unbreakable. All three got up with Adrenaline.
---
&gt; All in all, what i‚Äôm getting from your arguments is that, as killer, you should be able to make plays like a tripple slug with absolutely no risk or repercussions just because the survivors happened to be grouped together.

And since they were together, the killer should get sacrifices handed to him. Did I just about summarize this correctly?
---
They got downed like idiots lmao. They all grouped up, and when the killer arrived and downed one guy, they run in one direction together rather than splitting up so that he could only get one more down. I don't know whether there was any windows/pallet in that area, but if there was then why didn't they use that? The killer didn't get the sacrfices handed to him either, he either outplayed them HARD (if they had windows or pallets there) or they were idiots and deserved to die.
---
The killer in this video is definitely clown and I tested with hillbilly and leatherface
---
Correction on your edit, noed, like adrenaline, is when gates are powered, not sure if that is a recent change or not, but that‚Äôs what it is now. If egc is activated by hatch closed noed can still pop off
---
You're high. The Hag is easily in the top five, even at high ranks.
---
It wouldn't make much sense for her to be called "The Pig" if she is not wearing the mask.
---
I've been trying to find that again for a while now. Would love a link lol.
---
I believe that survivor perks should not have that big of an impact on the game and be that powerful, especially when compared to killer perks. That's my opinion, you're entitled to yours.
---
Never buy accounts from people u dont trust, id say most likely this guy has hacked his progress
---
No, you don‚Äôt typically earn adrenaline. What usually happens is you‚Äôre injured in a chase and you randomly get it. Its
---
Thats why you don't care for NOED, you play a broken ass killer who needs a nerf. Sincerely - A Wraith Main
---
Since were all talking about horror films. You MUST see Hereditary if youre a fan of the genre.

It's seems that everyone plays against 4 man swf on comms. Despite making up about 5% of all matches. Maybe you did play against a 4 man but so many people over exaggerate that's it hard to tell who's honest anymore.
---
If he's weong, then who am I?
---
I'm trying to get BBQ and chill but my god is the grind insane
---
I watched over 20 videos by him cause a friend of mine was a huge fan of his and tbh I was too for a time, but he just changed way too much for me to like him anymore. I mostly made that meme to fuck with my friend but he said I should post it to reddit so I did lol
---
Not my intention, I was just venting my take.  Feel free to ignore it.
---
Nice to meet you Mr Weong
---
Freddy also has some of the best tracking and still capabilities in the game. Him being the worst killer is a meme perpetuated by people who don't play him or just stack block add-ons whenever they do. He's definitely better than Leatherface.
---
Well I get my freinds in my killer games and he‚Äôs so fucking hard to find and when I do he done 3 gens and the totems while his teammates were messing about so either hatch or hook
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if they see the survivor because any survivor can use any perk
---
Lol no, its just against survivor rules, BHVR is fine with it.
---
Golly, gotta love when Redditors mass downvote your thought out and civil comment for no other reason than they disagree with it. Totally what the downvote option is for!
---
Can we stop the discussion NOED vs Adrenaline please ?
---
You make me sick. She is a happy oink
---
I'm sorry, but why did you think i was proud of this? my reaction was more like, "oh. okay."
---
Ok buddy reallyüòë
---
I know but for newer players and just to improve the overall experience of the game. I‚Äôm rank 7 and have prestiged many people so I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a noob
---
At least with Moris you actually have to down a survivor at least twice. A survivor with a key could sit in a single corner for the entire map, wait until everyone else does the work and the  just jump through, not to mention the fact that they can bring other survivors along with them.
---
Newer people can Grund for MAD Grit of They feel like they need it. I never had Any Problems with bodyblocking.
---
r/whoooosh
---
Yeah, but we're not in 2017 anymore, it needs a look over.
---
It‚Äôs just annoying that the killer then has to take up a perk slot just to stop toxicity
---
Hello there ;)
---
Oh and can I please get karma to comment on other stuff
---
I love it when people urban evade everywhere when I‚Äôm not chasing them or saves my traps for chases so I can down people faster
---
The Pig, Freddy and Wraith are all better than the Trapper or Leatherface in my opinion.
---
No
---
Same for killers though. Survivors have far more viable perks than killers do.
---
People have walked to me on hook when they needed to run way too many times
---
All we know is that the new power has a power bar
---
I don't understand how a power that forces people to remain broken the entire game could be considered "useless". It's like she has constant NOED that can't be cleansed with a totem and makes survivors easier to hear.
---
I tried my best to do it on what the perks actually do, and not how it will change what the survivors do, but if it affected them majorly, then I moved it. 
---
People have been less toxic after they fixed the perk anyway so it isn't that bad.
---
Yep. Ya hate to see it.
---
the biggest issue with adrenaline isnt that its a second chance perk, its that there isn't any form of counterplay combined with the second chance nature of it.
---
same reason why MoM is stupidly OP too, sometimes the killer is gona get shafted by it and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it
---
Self-Care and Urban are my F-tier. If I see a teammate urbaning as soon as the game loads in I immediately know I'm not escaping.
---
He played this so well against a billy ? Love it
---
i dont think the same should apply to killers. they dont have a team that depends on them, so why shouldnt they be able to just forfeit if they want to?
---
I feel like a broken record saying it but spirit fury enduring combo is almost a must on any killer that doesn't have a power to help them with looping, and other perks that compliment her stealth like nurses, surveillance, and discordance.
---
having an entire perk relying on a single moment in the game on it working or not WILL make it really underpowered.
---
Funnily enough the change you want for it would not have affected this match in particular since all 3 people were downed.
---
I totally agree with this! I remember watching "Mama" and thinking to myself 'I thought I signed up to watch a horror movie... Why am I on this emotional rollercoaster?! T^T'
---
Did you mean to say buffing instead of nerfing? The idea with the rework was never to nerf Legion, and they never did.
---
Deliverance in my face whenever I'm close to saving them, yep, like that.
---
Bond is better though
---
Ohhhh finally gg xD
---
Last Year did dialogue amazing. Too bad the devs and the game are trash
---
Sounds like MORE of a reason to make it happen
---
Gonna have to disagree with you on that one, maybe early on in the match but if you can link with the other survivors somewhat quickly its 100 times better than bond, map wide and its not one way like bond is.
---
Heresy
---
Yes officer this one
---
Imagine his perks names !  
---
We're All Negan

---
I feel like Ash should have looked like that figure, looks way more like him.
---
Cool
---
Just play Billy, doesn't need ruin and good map pressure.
---
No she not
---
So it makes it more fun for the killer going in totally blind into a match, nullify his purpose as a killer. Especially when you are a 4 man sfw, with the ability to communicate and adept to eachothers perk and add on builds. 
---
I guess everyone is getting instantly hyped to play killer then.
---
I'd vote for 049
---
Balance issues =/= what's wrong with playing him. You should learn the difference.
---
I'm not reading anything else you typed because I know it's just going to be dumb as fuck and I've already dished out enough verbal fuckings for your masochistic self to get off so good day.
---
i had crazy framedrops aswell until i moved dbd onto my SSD. since then it runs without problems
---
Remind me again why they removed the ability to grab survivors from the hatch when you can close the hatch but it can be reopened with a key?
---
"We're sorry. The Dwight you're looking for is in another locker. Groovy."
---
I was a wraith main before I picked up Nurse. I could 4k without Noed.
---
Then you held the killers attention to allow ur team to safely do gens
---
That video was a gift to the DBD community though?
---
Y u bully him?
---
Surviviors have to do gens in order for Adrenaline to activate. 
---
Killers have to hope Surviviors don't do Totems in order for NOED to activate
---
The two Legion guys in the left look about to be smacked by Nurse and Huntress. Still better than the Legion on the right who sits in front of Plague....
---
Awesome costumes
---
Go to sleep. You‚Äôre suffering from insomnia apparently
---
Huntress is too slow to defend all the gens. What you want to do with her is identity the 3 gens that are closest together and defend those above all else. Surveillance can help with this.

Lol

OMG that is so fucking cool. I've always wanted a collectible miniature gen or a miniature hook so seeing this is a good step forward for my wishes :)
---
Ah, the rarer but somehow always much more hilarious killer rage quit. Had a trapper the other night who we were slaughtering horribly, I was actually feeling really bad. And sure enough, when we were down to 1 gen left, pop went the connection. 
---
Suffocation pit is brutal in general for Killers just cause of the size and all. At least imo.
---
many thanks!
---
Uhhh. With 10% extra movespeed I am not ever going back to the totem. 
---
If I get into a chase, I win much faster.
---
That girl must be a pretty early bloomer
---
Why not though? It works for other games.
---
That is like, your opinion, man.
---
I think it depends on your ping or the killers ping.
---
Yea I don't know how it works on consoles, so if that is an issue maybe for PC only then idk.
---
Don't need ruin for 3 gen. :)

Also Escape From Tarkov.
---
It's a legit strategy if Tinnitus (their version of Whispers that doesn't proc on downed/chaired survivors) is active. Also some survivors like Coordinator and Mech have some incentive to get a save with their decoding debuff when someone is chaired. The only people who hard camp for no reason are low ranks.

The Legions new buff. It can just Think of You and you Die...üòî

Yea lets not make fun of these poor killers. their life is though. Lets get back making fun and shitting about TOXIC survivors dcing their 6th nurse in a row because they had enough.
---
My icon looks like a hot dog.
---
Only during the collapse. Pretty sure you can be caught before.
---
Hahaha I‚Äôll let him know you have notes.
---
If you have to use it early in the match, that match is going to be pretty stressful.
---
This happened to me with bubba, it seriously needs to be fixed

They aren‚Äôt siblings, that was a quick idea Carpenter made to give Halloween 2 a little more run time, he regretted it and didn‚Äôt want it to be canon, he didn‚Äôt even want to make a sequel cuz he believed the first movie summarised the whole story but fans demanded it, there‚Äôs a bit of trivia :)
---
I'd say dying light instead of rancor
---
Welcome to the game my friend, all the other comments have covered what I would have said, so just try and have fun.
---
Whys that? cuz someone got hit by the killer lol ya thats usually how it goes.
---
well, thechnically there is the super rare chance, that the killer might guard instead of closing the hatch, depending on the hatch spawn distance to the gates. In that case you can technically use it to do gens and power the gates. Still that's such an edge case scenario that there is no reason to take a perk for it.
---
I got so lost when they asked about all the mod tools, I have no idea how any of those work and it feels stupid to repeatedly say no
---
Litterly noone:
---
The Doctor:
---
Get some sleep
---
Same lol
---
Vrooooooom VroooOOOMMM VRROOOOM VRROOOOOOO AAARRGHHH OoOoF
---
So personally i would say to first choose which character you are going to play as your main. Depending on who you choose is how you would start. 
---
The first survivors you want to unlock their teachables would be ( in order) Claudette, David, Meg, Nea. Note if you choose to main any of these survivors then you can skip them in the list above as you will unlock their teachables overtime.
---
The next step would be to determine if you are going to prestige your character to P3 or not. While it can be a taunting task, i would recommend that you do get your character to p3. Not only will you get new bloody skins for your survivor, but (and more importantly) you will get better items, add ons, and offerings in your bloodwebs. 
---
Which ever you choose I would suggest to level up the character to have some if not all of the meta perks. This way you can continue to use this character during games. Then start working on unlocking the teachables for the other survivors, this will allow you to start getting all of the perks allowing you to deviate and try different builds.
---
Cute &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs a pretty low blow, no effort too, maybe salt/rant next time over shitpost cuz you sound like an OchiDO wannabe with that talk, also
---
...
---
K
---
Yeah its edited...
---
It used to spell out killer instead of killed because my brain decides not to function at the right moments.
---
Seriously?! Could I buy that then? XD. That would be so awesome to have dude
---
I agree with that
---
Poor rat, lol rat...
---
It's fairly common that the first person found gets downed and hooked. How early or late that happens is usually a good measure for whether or not it's gonna be a tough match.
---
I find this to be a huge issue with horror movies now. Typically I scroll through the movie and work out how much ‚Äúaction‚Äù there is before I commit to watching it. Anything with 2 hours of footage and only 5 minutes of being able to see the monster/ghost/whatever is a waste of time.
---
Fun story my friend got perma banned because he called someone a spaz and he replied with something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt appreciate you making fun of my mental capabilities so that‚Äôs why I reported you‚Äù at least with pc only the devs can report you, and they won‚Äôt report you for being rude to someone online...
---
So...
---
Not a fun story ._.
---
what?
---
no.  Slugging builds and such as a strat for the whole game (as nurse and billy, etc) can reasonably be seen as toxic, but there are times when it's the smartest thing you can do situationally, which I don't really find toxic, and BHVR doesn't really care about either.

For me, Autodidact is in S-tier. It makes me very excited to see someone using it, and I try to go out of my way to make sure the person using it is the one to heal me every time.
---
she was trying to see what happen if she throw inside the hatch
---
OH MY GOD xddd
---
I‚Äôm sorry the submarine sandwich went completely over my head, can someone explain?
---
1. Not many people go to the extent of playing every killer anyway
---
2. There is supposed to be some sort of grind, I only think this grind is insane because I prestige 3 all my killers and survivors
---
3. How tf would you reimburse some players, I for one have like 8 killers p3 with all the perks I need as well as p3 on all 4 main survivors, also I have every teachable, that better give me millions of bloodpoints if this were to go through (which it won‚Äôt) heck some streamers and YouTubed and stuff have very killer 100% maxes out p3 like puppers, at that point obviously you shouldn‚Äôt care but that‚Äôs still double the amount of time he‚Äôs had to play the game to get there, it‚Äôs fine as is imo
---
You won‚Äôt read it? Why not? Are you uneducated? Are you fearful that everything I‚Äôve said you don‚Äôt already know already?  Be a man and read, I swear reading is not that hard! 
---
But I know you already read it. You can act like a tough prick online all you want. It would help you in the real world.     Had enough attention for a few days?  You love it, don‚Äôt you.
---
Omg used to do this all the time with other games
---
You really gonna argue with me on that one dude its a pretty well known fact its one of the best perks thats why you see people complain about it on here so often.
---
How do Youtubers fit entire chapters from story driven games into 10mins? They cut out useless boring parts to keep it entertaining obviously. Also just so you know, that's what all SWFs do. Maybe not the most legit way to do it, but it's still 50 escapes in a row nonetheless.
---
And learn the difference? You didn‚Äôt fucking specify anything, stop trying to look like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. 
---
Go take your precious hiatus dude. Coming to reddit to bitch and cry over something is embarrassing as hell.
---
I love how she goes around the corner and just stands there confused for a second like *wtf*
---
Ok I had one game on autodidact where I got some dude from slugged to full health in like 8 seconds or less.
---
How dare you
---
Good. It‚Äôs nice to see a business that respects it‚Äôs employees‚Äô personal lives.
---
Dead Hard is honestly such an overrated perk. You have to time it *perfectly* for it to even work, and after the killer knows you have it it's basically useless (if they're a good killer anyway). Plus, Dead Hard really only buys a few extra seconds to get somewhere safe which can be difficult to set up sometimes.
---
Killer: 
---
1. Perks, try your best to spend your bloodpoints on unlocking teachables, the best include BBQ and Chili (Leatherface) Ruin (Hag) Nurses calling (nurse) and enduring (billy) to name a few
---
2. Killer, if you want to get right into playing the best possible play Hillbilly, he‚Äôs not to hard to use and once you get him down he‚Äôs pretty much easy 4K‚Äôs every time being the 2nd best killer in the game
---
3. Gameplay, learn how to mind game loops and walls, learn how to efficiently apply map pressure and learn how to play every tile, some good places to look for tutorials are probably on ScottJund and Tofu‚Äôs channels
---
Best of luck! :)
---
(Also I know you won‚Äôt read this lol just chipping in)
---
It‚Äôs not really a leak when it‚Äôs put into the trailer but it looks like it could be an interesting thing
---
Your downvotes haha. 
---
Ok good talk.
---
I started with killer and had every guide memorized so I started out with a good bit of knowledge.
---
*buff
---
No stun, just stops all kills, including DH and rancor. Would be meh but no stun.
---
bubba laughs at you
---
I think the best course of action is either 
---
A: removing perk tiers (there is some fun in powering up perks through leveling however)
---
Or B: allowing multiple perks to be purchased per web.

MoM isnt OP, change my mind.
---
do you honestly think someone who plays this game as a job, for over 5k hours can withstand constant nurse and OP ass addon/offering spam at high ranks? He trys to be entertaining, and honestly i have a hard time trying to have fun in general at high ranks.
---
Did I stutter?
---
No one asks to show killer's character to survivors, what this op proposes is either equal anonimity or equal acknowledgement of killers and survivors names and profiles, in last scenario little window with the name of killer on top of survivors will be more than enough.
---
It is truly unfair that killers get to see names and profiles of survivors and can decide if they want to play against certain players, but survivors cant do the same.
---
 This is also one of the reasons of unstoppable dc wave.
---
So survivors should be able to see killer's name and profile in lobby, or killers should lose such ability.
---
"The official oinker" love that. It's sad that every m1 killer need to use the enduring spirit fury combo. I learned huntress cause I hated it.
---
I really dislike to brag, but I feel like after all my posts and comments I earne the title of the DBD subreddits OINKER. I love Amanda too much.
---
Creating a game mechanic so killers could dodge more frequently is ludicrous.
---
Dreamcatcher ;)
---
My boy David let‚Äôs me get chase points
---
Dude, who cares, play how you want to. The item is in the game to be used
---
Instead of needing to be downed 3 times you need to be downed 2 times. This removes 33% of the game and chances the survivors get. I myself don't mind it since I always die on first hook.
---
Cool af!
---
Its like a killer doing a third of the work to get a kill. Its comparable to survivors only having to do threeish gens to escape
---
Um I guess not, you're just wrong.
---
But is a lot taller.
---
Survivors: *get a single good perk after more then a year of shitty perks*
---
Killers: *spirit fury, rancor, haunted grounds, discordance, bamboozle, ect*
---
Survivors: *get good perk that is good*
---
killers: "OH MY GODD PLEASFEA NERF OH MY GODD IT BREAKING GAME!!1! HOW DO YOU MAKE ALL THESE GOOD SURVIIVOR PERK??? WHY ARE YOU HAND HOLDING SURVIVORS?!?!11!/1"
---
She has Infantry belt and Iridescent Head on Are You guys blind xD I USED to be a Huntress main lol
---
Same people who whined to get MoM nerfed, when it's not even an OP perk. They won't be satisfied until survivors spawn on the hook.
---
I find the lack of noise he makes is much more beneficial than the size
---
Ppl just like to complain although it is pretty annoying when you get first hook mori
---
das a goode boi right there
---
Because killer mains whine even more than survivor mains. They won't be satisfied until survivors spawn on the hook.
---
I mean, he's In both just like Jacket from Hotline Miami Is considered a Payday 2 cosplay, I cosplayed with a DBD group so I guess that also makes me a DBD cosplayer.
---
Was it 25 sacrifice for each face right? They could probably lower it or something if they add dodge penalties. And people that worked hard to get the face before will get legacy face, with  yellow glow and shit, but will also have the normal face too like it is now. Idk I feel like there's always a solution.
---
Maybe you should buy it for the character and don't complain when an OP perk gets nerfed
---
That lack of noise is amazing! It must drive killers crazy when they lose tall and lanky Ace.
---
[Frame stop at Dwights face at the locker](https://i.imgur.com/GG68oNt.jpg).
---
"It was at this moment when he knew... he fucked up."
---
Nah you're wrong. They made his ability for 1, not  help you find any survivors like it used to, 2. you cant find any bloodstains for some fucking reason cause legion becomes blind when in a frenzy. And 3, its not even that fast and usable anymore. And mind you, Normally attacking with a full bar, makes it a half bar because that makes sense. They buffed his base, but nerfed the ability to the ground and it has no other use than just finding survivors now (And mind you, thats only IF you want to hit a survivor, get a headache midway while you are approaching the other survivors heartbeat) . It doesnt slow the game down, it doesnt kill, it does nothing. His ability is pointless. I prefer getting his old version back. Or atleast to make him useful they could have made him a Co-op killer. 2 Legions. It wouldnt have been too bad if they did that. But guess what? They didnt. And thats why i'd put him lower than you did.
---
Yeah I take back what I said about being a smart decision, it wasnt since Adrenaline is so prevelent. I still stand on my views that Adrenaline is as overpowered and unfun as NOED and MoM, all are bs second chance perks.
---
Understandable, but I don't see the problem with No Mither.
---
Just in case you don't know the [iconic original video](https://twitter.com/more_milf/status/1047074851993866240)
---
NSFW tho
---
Perks shouldnt affect killers decision making as much as Adren does. Dead Hard/Lithe/WMI is fine, but Adren is too powerful.
---
You rang?
---
i dont see the problem with iron will just dont injure the survivor lmao
---
Just provide a source.
---
lmao someone downvoted this post someones been killed by an ebony to many times
---
I love those games and then there's games where you find it and two people are dead already
---
Playing Clown against a SWF team, OOF.
---
It's generally considered an unfun game mechanic to play against. However, that doesn't justify players telling you to kill yourself. Be sure to always report users who think it's okay to do that.
---
Here's an Imgur link with a lot more pics; including my Power Glove hand and some other Ashes.

The main issue survivors have is like others said, it removes a huge chunk of the game played. It‚Äôs already annoying when you‚Äôre the first found, and spend the majority of the game on hook losing points. It‚Äôs even worse when you‚Äôre immediately tunneled after being saved because the killer just wants the easy rehook or kill because hey can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt go get someone else. It‚Äôs lazy, and while a ‚Äúviable strategy,‚Äù it‚Äôs just seriously infuriating. That survivor spent the whole game being chased, lost those chases, and spent the rest of the time on the damn hook or ground dying. 
---
With an ebony is just like that most times, because killers are just trying to end things as fast as possible to avoid Gens getting done. It‚Äôs like being tunneled off the hook except you don‚Äôt get re hooked with another possible chance to get back off and still get points. An ebony is an even quicker end and a promise that you don‚Äôt pip, safety pip most times, and you don‚Äôt even get BP on top of that. 
---
It‚Äôs not the Mori people usually have a problem with. It‚Äôs the tunneling Killers do with them. Personally if I run an ebony I try to get everyone hooked first and THEN start killing. Makes the game last longer which means points for everyone. However if there‚Äôs someone being a nuisance or a threat I‚Äôll take them out right away. 
---
It‚Äôs understandable on both sides. It‚Äôs just annoying when you have several bad games in a row and then a Mori to deal with on top.
---

There was a Leatherface with a chainsaw by a hook that I was about to save someone from. I ran away and he stopped chasing me, but he somehow hit me even though I was very far away from him. Lag, basically

I honestly feel like I'm the only person on the subreddit that plays the game sometimes, with the stupid suggestions I've seen. I'm just a bunny lady that likes to throw shit, and knows what I'm talkin about (generally). Is that a title?

I haven't tried her, but when I play against her, I notice some Plagues seem to waste a little too much time vomiting even when they have an easy hit in front of them. But like all killers, it takes time to work out the most efficient way to use their power.

To be perfectly honest, I haven't played this game since summer 2016 (bought it, turns out both my old and new laptop can't run it fairly well), but I was thinking of picking it up on PS4 real soon since I have been jonesing for the game a bit.

If I do end up buying it for PS4, I'd definitely like to take you up on that, thanks so much for the offer!

---
Shouldn't Adrenaline also go off in that case, since all gens are auto completed then?
---
As a baby nurse this hurts
---
So it sounds like you're agreeing with me then? Punishing dodgers?
---
Dedicated servers comes in a month or two, so that should fix that, but who knows this game is being held by scotch tape.
---
I think he‚Äôs right though. Survivor is a team based game, with doing generators as their primary objective. At the point of EGC, you‚Äôve lost the game, hatch or no hatch. The team failed the objective, the team are all dead minus one. You should only have a slim chance of escape, if any at all. You have just as big a chance of finding that hatch before the killer, if that gets messed up too, you‚Äôve just batted 3 for 3, you‚Äôre out. I really can‚Äôt believe people are actually wanting changes to the EGC. It‚Äôs serving it‚Äôs purpose and it‚Äôs working exactly how it‚Äôs intended. There isn‚Äôt any change needed
---
Adrenaline does proc off hatch closing.
---
Are you trying to claim that DCing so the last survivor can get hatch is cheating?
---
Every time that they hit a shot I nutted in G major

Either way its gonna happen intentional or not, but in my opinion, intentional tunneling and facecamping is toxic no matter when it happens during a game.  Somedays its worse than others, but i feel if you go out of your way to facecamp someone or tunnel someone youre a toxic player. It takes the experience of the game away from the other player, especially if its a new player whose only played a couple matches and doesnt really know much of the game.
---
yea that way solo Survivors would  have the disadvantage to only have 3 slots compared to swf.
---
It is the visual of her going ‚Äúin and out‚Äù of the world randomly! When playing against her she seems to disappear and reappear rapidly. It helps with making her mindgame survivors better.
---
I don't disagree with you but the fact that some killers counter it doesn't make the perk less powerful. Killers like wraith and so on still get fckd by it. And now tell me why people still play the perk even though it gets countered by some of the most popular killers?
---
It‚Äôs great. If I wasn‚Äôt buying him already (which tbh I probably was) I‚Äôm doing it now.
---
The one in the Hoffman-inspired outfit for her looks better imo. In fact, the whole Hoffman outfit is better than this one I think.
---
It is not possible to balance asymmetrical game. There are multiple killers. Some of them are stronger and some of them are weaker. There are maps which are better for survivors and maps which are better for killers. There are players with 100 and 1000 hrs played at same rank. Only thing we can do is balance game as much as it is possible. There is big gap between solo players and SWF players. Current state of game is "lets go play swf, i dont want play with randoms".
---
I didn't played for long time. I was pure solo player, but i decided to play only SWF.
---
SO THATS HOW YOU FUCKING DO IT? 
---
God sake borderless
---
Now this is some good shit.
---
Just like the key does for survivors, it allows them to escape with only having done 60-100% of gens (depending on survivors left). Not saying any of them are wrong to use or right but both sides can "cheat" out an easy win like this.
---
Give link how lol
---
This is fucking amazing.
---
when they "recently" decreased the maximum pallets generated in the maps.
---
When they increased their vault speed. 
---
When they limited the generation of windows in Lerial Institute for exemple.
---
When they removed "infinites", 
---
When they got bamboozle from Clown, when they got spirit Fury, When they got Corrupt intervention, all game changing and very used perks.
---
And not talking about nerf survivors get that implies indirect buff to killers.
---
the last good perk survivors got is Mom which isn't as strong as the old DS which has been nerfed.
---
the ranking system is bad but your idea is even worse
---
Also if the game lasted to long. He‚Äôd fall asleep for a few decades    Least he wouldn‚Äôt be able to tunnel.
---
All the stuff I saw still had some BS in there coz if a killers got lag they will still land BS hits. I didn‚Äôt play it myself however I just based it on the videos that showcased it.
---
Alright I would say
---
That you don't deplete their mend bar by striking them twice was indeed a major nerf to him, and I know terror radius thing is to stop moonwalking but they shoudnt have increased it and belive it of not 4 seconds of cool down hurts a lot in chases.
---
It's still much harder to hide behind low walls as characters such as Jeff, Bill and Ace compared to Claudette, Nea and Meg
---
"against Freddy"
---
ESL
---
Perks from new killers aren't a buff. They nerfed the plague, they nerfed legion, they nerfed pig. Removing the infinites and some windows aren't buffs to killers
---
Probably a P3 trapper, but he falls for the DH for the second time. How bad are players on console?
---
The game being ranked at all is to just sort of divide players up between decent and awful. There isnt any noticable difference between rank 1 and rank 10. It just stops absoulte new players being faced against high tier ones. Rank means nothing most of the time
---
Bug's a bug.
---
*sneaky oink*
---
Depends on the interpretation. Remake Freddy is. Original Freddy originally was, but was written so it was little more than a soft implication. In fact, in part 6, he‚Äôs shown to have a wife and daughter (prior to him dying).
---
It‚Äôs bad that I immediately knew what this was from.
---
Girl has no manner whatsoever.
---
Yeah the rank System is flawed, but there isn't even an incentive to reach high Rank. You are getting nothing but harder and less fun games.
---
I like the thought you've put into this, I would enjoy this as a survivor but I'll tell you why I think it's not a good idea.
---
Certain perks give the information you need. For example, bond will show what other team mates are doing. Perks like bond would never be used since it would have no use anymore.
---
This brings me to my next point. The reason this information is locked behind perks is to balance the game. What you're suggesting are essentially built in perks. By taking bond, you have 1 perk slot less so it's a trade off for the information you get.
---
It's a well thought out idea, but it would make survivors even tougher for killers. You have to remember that even though some killers are able to destroy swf teams, not all killers have that skill. As a result, killer mains would start leaving the game over frustration, then survivors will struggle even more to find games.
---
Again, well thought out implementation but not good for the game's balance.
---
He said "free farm" and then said "ez game"
---
Makes sense. Im 6'3, say me and my 5'9 friend put on 20 pounds of muscle evenly distributed. It will be much more noticeable on my friend
---
Well, developers want to change Dying Light anyway to be less tunneling and campy. Also, I hope they change Simple Formula to decreases the terror radius all the time, not just in a chase, I mean, it's useless to have a lower terror radius in a chase, especially with chase mechanics being broken.
---
boobs
---
I mean by that logic you could say how do survivors counter whispers? Especially if they‚Äôre the last survivor left. They simply can‚Äôt. Just because a perk is strong doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be nerfed into oblivion.
---
Now I want Slenderman as a killer
---
I once had a guy literally write on my profile " forgot to reply, but sorry about that tbag xd +rep " because I had bbq n chili and saw him t-bagging the hatch when I hooked someone.
---
BACK TAH WORK YAH GROT, 'EFORE I KRUMP-YA GOOD!
---
What is this trickery!!!!
---
Big Smoke?
---
If the killer is bad at chasing, or I don‚Äôt even get found, I get nothing, it needs looking at.
---
The one time I‚Äôd pardon playing old legion in any capacity.
---
&gt;'just don't let the gens be done lol'
---
That's like, more than a half of killer's gameplay.
---
we used double engravings to launch ontop of the gas station and from that you could walk up there might upload a vid later
---
Yeah true. I was thinking about being the last person after the killer closed the hatch, but your scenario makes it pretty OP.  Would indeed be better if its more effective during the endgame collapse
---
For some people challenge is more fun
---
Killer mains: bitch about survivors not leaving and "holding the game hostage" = now there's endgame
---
Killer mains: Do shit like this and circle jerk each other about it
---
So you are running a late game perk, a perk that will be used once and then not do anything. Now that perk gets changed so that one situation isn't going to happen half of the time.
---
Why even run adrenaline over any other perk then? At least you will be guaranteed their effect.
---
A rework that (hopefully) will make him stronger. Got used to calling that a buff, sorry ^^''
---
Just because he's the director doesn't mean he owns the licensing rights to the film, so that surely can't be the only reason
---
When Spirit equips Prayer Beads
---
The internet really is a wild place.
---
Got used to calling a rework that makes a character stronger a ''buff'', sorry cant edit the title. As far as i know
---
P3 doesn't mean you're good on any platform
---
You cant read the names, can you?
---
It is not smart to stun the killer with a pallet, one of the main actions in the chase for the survivor, just because of a perk called Spirit fury.
---
It's dangerous to clense hex totems, one of the most important actions for the survivors, just because of a perk called Hex: Haunted Grounds.
---
It is not smart to stay in the match and try to save your teammate who got hooked once the gates are open because of one perk.
---
The entire purpose of clensing dull totems exists because of one perk that the killer might be running.
---
It is not smart to heal in the killer's terror radius because of one perk.
---
etc.
---
There is a ton of stuff you do to play around certain perks, adrenaline isn't an exception to that.
---
Yeah i think i remember a while back people were asking about jeepers creepers and i think Not Queen posted saying they will never add him and support the director
---
Those greats tho...
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure default Frank wears a leather jacket with a hoodie underneath.
---
We had that for killers, at least very similar. A hook used to be 1 point, kill used to be 2. so a full kill was 4.
---
Either 1 kill with everyone hooked twice or 2 kills + one hook were a pip. 
---
It was horrible though. Ppl just camping for their second kill shouldn‚Äòt rank up, kills are no indicator of playing well as long as there is camping and tunneling.
---
idk maybe the color should be diffrent on the "Signalise that the killer is near" how about it becomes more red-ish
---
"less toxic /annoying to play against"
---
Hell the fuck yeah
---
But from a killers perspective , it hurts a lot I mean if you had the ability to cut down the mend bar by hitting then twice then mending would be an actual threat ya know?
---
Mending is heavily nerfed like even if it's half way down you can mend and you won't go down
---
He is better, I agree but he's bettee than his past shitty self, he's ehh make it that his cool down is 3 seconds please  it really hurts and you can't use cold dirt every time
---
I play a more slow tempo game, I like to run Sloppy Butcher, Nurses, and Monitor and Abuse as my core on Hag.
---
It was a fun experience, I feel like it's going to he a little easier when I start using perks again. I have 2 BPS and like, 10 survivor puddings waiting before I prestige
---
Survivors waiting in the queue to get moried by Freddy once they find out the killer is Nurse.
---
Apart from the fact you can't heal, puke and make noises, and can't hide in lockers when your sick??
---
Agreed. It should either not heal or take way longer
---
You must be pretty new if you still try to hide that much.
---
I literally just watched that episode an hour ago. Good series so far.
---
It's really easy to keep track of both doors, especially if they spawn close to each other which happens often.
---
I never cleanse against the Plague. I'm not sure anyone would if a "free heal" wasn't offered.
---
Then there would be no incentive to cleanse and she's just gonna be a dull m1 killer without that very powerful corrupt purge.
---
I was bored during classes so I made this Artwork, YA BETTER LIKE IT!
---
I agree that the rankingsystem needs a rework to reward good plays. Right now just as you can farm BP you can farm emblems, and playing optimaly to survive/kill will not give you mutch of either...
---
Well, whisperers only lets you know that the survivor is in your proximity. You are not guaranteed to find him. MoM on the other hand will activate 100% of the time or you escape without using it (killer dependant ofc). 
---
And whisperers is pretty useless since the endgame collapse came out. The killer doesnt need to find the survivor he just has to find the hatch. From my experience as killer so far its almost impossible to escape after the hatch has been closed except if the gates are really far apart.
---
And it doesnt need to be nerfed into oblivion. They should just make it so it has a requirement to be activated like deliverance and not just letting the killer hit you.
---
Let me explain why your idea would be a bad one. 
---
Plague needs Corrupt Purge to even become decent, without it, she is just a Trapper without traps after all survivors are broken. But if fountains wouldn't heal survivors, then why should survivors cleanse ever against her and yet give her Corrupt Purge ? Just to get rid of broken status wouldn't be enough, because they would still need to waste time healing, while Plague would become more powerful because of Corrupt Purge. Survivors would have any reason to cleanse against her if fountains wouldn't heal them, they already have any reason to heal if they are any decent at looping. The problem is not what survivors get when they cleanse, the problem is that survivors don't have enough reasons to cleanse.
---
Actually, movie lore shows that he specifically tunnels. He tunneled the Eff outa Justin longs character
---
I don't think it's a matter of him holding the licence. I think it's the fact he would still get royalties from sales and that would essentially be BHVR associating themselves with someone who's been convicted. 
---
It isn't a good look.
---
High rank survivors love hiding....
---
This particular one stuck with me for some reason
---
Thinking rank matters...no further questions your honor
---
SWFs have advantage that is too big. You should not buff survivors to make them as strong as SWF is. Or probably buff both sides at least.
---
That would be really cool.
---
For better or worse though, I find Ash a bit unsettling now because of the precedent that's been set, not because it's a bad idea.
---
You‚Äôre missing the fact that he needs to sleep for 23 years...   that was the joke I was trying to get at.
---
.....you lost the items regardless.
---
I mean even the pedophile part shouldn‚Äôt block it- Freddy is in the game
---
And then she starts working on the gen with you
---
Joseph says he hates the Japanese but he knocked up a Japanese girl like 5 years before.
---
Survivors already don't cleanse if they know what they're doing. If you aren't running an Apple add-on, you very rarely even get the chance to use Corrupt Purge at all, otherwise her ability is basically just a constant NOED. It doesn't really matter if the fountains heal the survivors or not. I kind of wish that hooking a survivor would cause the nearest fountain to automatically become corrupt.
---
They
---
Nerfed the cool down addons
---
                And
---
Added another 1 second of stun
---
I am like.. What are you doing?
---
...can I say it?
---
I think the ranking system should still focus more on achieving the main goals. Surviving or sacrificing.
---
This!
---
Eh you didn‚Äôt steal it, It‚Äôs a different meme with a different take. I just cackled bc Kate really is a cock destroyer huh lmao
---
If you can't beat the map, become the map
---
Totally but we can‚Äòt really do that unless there is a solid fix for Camping, we learned that in the past (majority of 2017 iirc).
---
Hairless Myers is cursed, thank you for the inspiration.
---
good damn question lol
---
It's so expressive, my new phone background!
---
Kate does really have that cock destroyer expression on her face. It fits so perfectly
---
No one really uses MoM though. It just happens.
---
I know, such a well-made edit.
---
I agree. To be honest, i forgot how color has hooked survivor :D
---
She looks like she ain‚Äôt takin any shit today
---
No one was defending DC, did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
I still wanna do Nea and the pussy cats so ,hold on!
---
Man, you don't know if she used her entire power and if she has cooldown add-ons, so don't be so sure on you.
---
The issue in this game is, that itis balanced around limited communication, which it shouldnt be.
---
That's the killers fault for taking the risk of not securing (Hooking) the kill and instead being greedy.
---
On PS4 there is a way to see who the killer player is.  Not what killer they are using or anything.
---
Get into lobby,  hold PS button. Go to currently playing with once tab comes up.  Any player in the lobby (including killer) who is playing online, will have their psn ID shown.  Simply take your survivor teams names and see which one isn‚Äôt on there. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt work if someone is playing as ‚Äúappear offline‚Äù   Both the person checking and the killer have to be playing online.
---
Jeff and the other survivors need a "head bang" emoji and a little guitar solo once the exit gates are open.
---
I'm telling just by my experience - I've seen a lot of trash P3 survivors and P3 killers both console and on PC (from twitch/youtube).
---
I'm sure I can easily can find you video in which Monto fails DH twice. Is Monto a bad killer?
---
Tbh, there were noticeable improvements to the optimisation in Ch 11. At least on PS4 Pro. Still far from 60 FPS, but they weren't promising 60 FPS for Ch 11.
---
Where do they stream. Youtube?
---
Actually, they reviewed the true meaning of what is a mental illness, and the board came to the conclusion that in fact it wasn‚Äôt. The lobbying and petitioning was of transgender individuals and advocates stating how being transgender didn‚Äôt affect their mental wellbeing , I.e proof. So I would say that yea, it was disproven. You can see this in the APA‚Äôs overview of Transgender People and Gender Identity.
---
But, if you dont care that much just scroll past it 
---
Its not difficult or are you just looking for attention on a subreddit
---
you have to buy it
---
Only for level 3, figuring out the chance for each level would be waaaaay more work than it's worth.
---
Always wondered why they chose him anyway. Should have been Nancy.
---
Oof
---
Pretty sure you will have to pay it if you continue...
---
is it just me or does the DBD Ash actually look like bruce campbell but  DBD Laurie looks nothing like Jamie lee curtis? ( in her younger years)
---
I solely don't use his p3 face because I get tunneled when I do and I prefer his beanie look
---
Did you compare animal abuse to Gender Identity? Your line of thinking is what leads to transphobia and transphobic violence. Gender should never be equated to animal abuse.
---
Only final I need to do is MATHS
---
Give me 5000‚Ç¨ to build a rocket or 5000000‚Ç¨ and there would be no difference. They get enough money as it is and guess what? The game still has no dedicated, is limited to 60hz and looks like straight up dogshit. Should i kneel down for them too? Fuck off moron.
---
I think it might be because of how similar she and Laurie are in terms of how they are both final girls
---
That's the same build as me. Addons I like are last will, video tape, john's medical files and combat straps
---
Game is not f2p. It's just another free weekend.
---
happy cake day
---
The duct tape on your cam?
---
That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen the spirit‚Äôs hatch close animation. Pretty neat.
---
Wait Enduring is getting buffed? What did they say about it?
---
It‚Äôs right over the top of the basement stairs if they spawn there. I call temple basement sending them to hell
---
Super worth it if you don‚Äôt plan on unlocking all perks. 
---
Nurses is good an basically all killers.
---
I also remember the devs saying on a Livestream that the reason they choose Quentin was because he had more of an impact in the movie compared to Nancy
---
it was better before they added this sound she makes when using her power...
---
Well there already is a well known signal for when the killer's near when you're on a hook; hold M1 to start selfunhooking, but don't finish it; then let go. And then repeat while the killer is near.
---
Oh, I'm going to sandbag you so hard...
---
I feel bad when me and my team rushes but sometime it just happens when we dont communicate enough at the beginning
---
I've had that happen before. The killer dc'd immediately after. Was glorious.
---
The answer is *everything*
---
Looks like a gay porn.
---
Please, tell me it is.
---
Guess Jeff was an acrobat in his wilder days...
---
Myers is as cute as Pig, change my mind.
---
I agree. I've had a killer use an Ebony on people after they were already on death hook, and didn't tunnel to get anyone there, and that didn't bother me.
---
But hooking, tunneling into Mori is just boring to play. I don't want to spend 20 minutes looking for a game to be back in that queue almost immediately.
---
Tip: Short lunge.
---
FUNNY AND ORIGINALL
---
XXXXDDDD
---
I agree. In some games, it is best to just stay within the one vicinity of the map where the hooked survivor is. This is your bait and you're catching fish that are hungry. Of course; as you stated, the survivor could just do the gens but they don't.   
---
I have had games where you know you have been beaten so you have to resort to DEFENSE rather than ATTACK. You will get name called but it is unwise to go out searching for another survivor because as you are doing so, your hooked survivor has been attended to, putting you a step back until you can hook the other survivor. Playing like this means that you're not really making any progress towards sacrificing anyone because in a typical game, all survivors have three lives.   
---
Therefore, when you are getting overrun, put all your eggs in one basket and play defense. Now the roles have switched and the survivors are playing attack. In this time, you will get more points, and maybe even more kills than you deserved.
---
Actually, this isn't half bad.
---
If someone does that please send it my wayüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol i know the feeling, it sucks when u make an awesome post but it doesn‚Äôt get any visibility :(
---
Yes, but the fact the survivor doesn't instantly die should give you a clue they're meant to have a chance of escaping.
---
How does everyone keep uploading vids from PS to Reddit?  Is there a function I‚Äôm missing here?   Got plenty of stuff that all these cuties would find fun.
---
I'VE BEEN DONE FOR TWO WEEKS AND IT'S GLORIOUS
---
Low ranks arent better. I play solo (Rank 7) and I nearly get Rank 13 to 17 Teammates in my games and Rank 9 to 12 Killers. And ,when I don't have kindred nobody even bothers to get me off.
---
because locker guy dc‚Äôd
---
They couldn't afford the likeness rights for Jamie Lee Curtis so they got a stunt double instead.
---
It is pretty cringe
---
Problem is: for most campers every lobby is a "better SWF"
---
Thats not how it works
---
Any killer except Chuckie. I don't think any child sized killers would work. They wouldn't be able to hook people and would literally fucking die if they got pallet slammed. People already memed when we got Legion. Imagine the "David would kick this killer's ass" memes if we got Chuckie. 
---
I think that the Jeepers Creepers monster would be a good fit. I highly doubt we'll get Pennywise since they keep saying no shapeshifting.
---
Channel is Yoll, for context
---
I *think* Ash is the tallest. Don't quote me on that tho
---
Its still spam
---
A constructive discussion doesn't start by "Well, downvote this stupid bastard, then tell him his buffs go too far".
---
Usually I just add some feedback, or go off on the same tangent as the person I am talking to, not often do I comment like I am here to call out random thoughts and secure the demise of the thread with 0 karma scores.
---
But, you want 0 visibility to how uncivil you are, so I get it.
---
Nah I get it, I use to think the same until I open my mind and saw it was dumb that okay this guy is cocky ok, good for him still gonna die most likely
---
It's very situational, for me. If someone is unhooked/wounded and running for the gate, I'll take a hit to protect them &amp; give them a chance.
---
I usually run Borrowed Time &amp; I don't entirely care if I survive as long as I've played a decent match, so I'll generally go back in for the save unless there's NOED, I'm Rancor, or Endgame timer is too close to ending. The reason being, if I'm one-hit down, all me going back is going to do is increase a kill count, and the other person still might not actually make it out of the match.
---
I think David Attenborough might've been what he/she was going for
---
Clown Rant Incoming
---
I have no idea why people think clown is mid-tier. He has the most addon-dependant power ever. His power counters looping poorly and it's less effective than just placing a hag trap. 
---
He has the least pressure of any killer. He has no mobility, map awareness, or stall, with only a mediocre chase ability. 
---
If they buffed his gas' slow at all, he would become unfair in a chase but still have nothing to apply pressure on survivors. The only thing I could think of for him is to reduce the slow by a tiny bit and make the gas clouds last for 60+ seconds. That way he can have more control over the map, making some loops more unsafe and being able to protect generators somewhat. The gas could make the skillchecks distorted adding a risk to working in the smoke. 
---
I'd also give him bottles that recharge slowly over time, allowing him to speed up the process by refilling them normally.
---
Sorry for the rambling. I really love Clown but I just feel at such a disadvantage using him as opposed to any other killer.
---
Pinhead would be the only one to fit current lore, I think. Every character in a game is a human.
---
Just block the scam bots, you ok there?
---
Smooth Myers
---
Yeah, and it says a lot that the made up character was the most interesting non-Freddy character in the film
---
Yeah, exactly. I'm not someone who NEEDS to survive each game, and if a game is particularly boring (like 3-genned by a perma-tier-3 Tombstone Myers,) I welcome the sweet release of death, and I'll even openly kill myself to save a teammate on more than one occasion.
---
But I don't want to spend a gazillion years waiting for a game just to be found early, hooked, tunneled &amp; Mori'd. I acknowledge that my fun isn't the killer's responsibility, but I will still say that it's fucking annoying to deal with.
---
Anyone who tells you to kill yourself over a game is an asshole though, it's never that serious.
---
Facts.
---
Yeah leave absolutely no counterplay
---
Reminds me of when a 3man SWF got mad that Tru3Talent beat them with Nurse so they trolled him the next game
---
The day may come when I will use one of my 100+ emergency medkits gotten with Pharmacy...
---
...BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY.
---
Pig accidentally crouching in a chase, Legion missing a stab, and plague missing all her last bits of corrupt vomit
---
I don't mean the phase sound, I mean the "glass splitter sound" when she goes to the spirit world
---
technically there is a punishment but you would have to dc a shit ton of times
---
Oh yeah fair enough my bad haha
---
Why is wraith not high
---
It is frustrating when it happens, but honestly how often does it happen (specifically ebony mori). I'd say I get mori'd more from perks to be honest. It doesn't come up all that often in a blood web due to rarity too. 
---
At the end of the day, the killer won't get as many points, so it's less encouraging to use unless you believe "winning" is determined by a 4k and not whether you pipped.
---
The flip side is if as a survivor you believe an ebony mori is toxic and not fair, then you're a hipoocrit if you don't feel the same way about brand new parts. A brand new part, just like an ebony mori, cuts the game short. I've been against a swf before when they've all ran brand new parts. 
---
However you play, who you play or what you play with; you're still going to get hate from someone who's opinion is it's unfair or toxic. Just play how you want as long as it's not cheating, an exploit or breaks ToS.
---
This spin shit is so easy to counter :D
---
Jojo‚Äôs peculiar journey.
---
I'm also going to say (without bias, totally) that Trapper and Wraith should both be higher
---
It really is he might of been having a bad day he quit after the clip
---
Its shit
---
*anal beads
---
Reminds me of the old ‚Äúmadness‚Äù series because of the face
---
Chucky is definitely my favourite but I don't know how BHVR would implement him
---
I bet $1.01
---
Imagine gasping at a $20 game which you also get to try for free first.
---
Okay thanks
---
Also next time you make stupid questions remember to tag them as shitposts
---
Downvoted because you‚Äôre correct I see
---
That ideology is really weird man. So to get it straight, you can and will not laugh at something a second time, even if it was funny the first time? Holy crap the world must be stale to you by now
---
Smh 3 days until fuckery
---
If SWF is Op, this would make every team kinda SWF, but the thing to know If a survivor is dead on hook would be Nice, so both killer and team could know
---
We will not be suppressed any longer
---
I was waiting for someone to make this. Thnx, lol
---
Leslie Vernon
---
Scissorman from Clock Tower
---
The Hunter from Left 4 Dead (Bill needs a friend!)
---
The Tall Man from Phantasm (LET ME THROW MY BALLS, BHVR)
---
The bag-headed guy from Town That Dreaded Sundown, complete with trombone weapon, of course. 
---
The Driller Killer
---
And finally, Christine. Because you know it would be fun to just say "fuck pallets" and run over survivors with a car.
---
Tall Man for sure!!
---
I like this idea.  I upvoted it. I did something today.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
"GG
---
Did anyone pip?" 
---
I really want to know sometimes.
---
The devs can get the rights from the actor like they did with Ash
---
Actually the hatch does still make a sound even when closed unless the recent patch changed that or something. Finding the hatch is easy if you know the different places the hatch can spawn on different maps which are more often than not some of the same spots. A survivor could also just find the hatch long before egc even happens and already know where to go the moment egc starts. If u have a key you're good to go
---
Hope
---
Finger guns on killer
---
I dont cry about it at all thank you very much, i just hate that map because of its infinite.
---
Dont be like that, no one wants presumptuous assholes like you.
---
Hol up, wait a minute

&gt;"Holy crap the world must be stale to you by now"

Oh, dude, sooo stale. Nothing amuses me. At all. Ever. Not anymore. I may as well hang myself right now because my life is completely out of comedic value.
---
The tier list we needed.
---
Please stop spamming your videos
---
The mic thing is a planned addition, I believe. The idea with the bloodweb is you have the luck of the draw when it comes the items you get. As you Prestige your Survivor/Killer, you get better items in the bloodweb. It is a way to entice players to want to prestige with the promise of better stuff.
---
I might need them for later, you never now! ...which is why i never use them
---
legion is no longer toxic he is no longer just use your power down a survivor its now use your power get a hit and hit anyone else who is close then follow with a normal m1 to down now you have to know how to play killer instead of just spamming your power  so as long as you know how to play killer legion is better then myers if you ask  me  people seam to heal a lot ageist legion now and thats a lot of pressure for free and the best part about legion for me is that you get to counter MoM for free by using your power on full heath survivors. 
---
TLDR. survivors are babys and will d/c for anything now a days but legion is not toxic
---
You mean the PTB, right? The place where you can't lose anything cause it's just testing grounds right?
---
i like being able to see the whole killer, as well as the poses giving them personality instead of just looking like a school picture
---
No one uses it? wat
---
I think on their twitch channel. It goes by DeadbyDaylight, but I don't know for sure
---
+Rep from me
---
Those are some nice suggestions here, but balancing-wise this wouldn't work.  
---
1) Like other people allready mentioned: This would make certain perks useless. (Kindred, Bond).  
---
2) This game is balanced arround 1 killer fighting against 4 randoms. This game isn't balanced arround SWFs. SWFs breaks the game.  
---
By being able to coordinate your team/sit in voice coms you get a HUGE advantage over the killer. The power role heavily shifts in favor of the survivors.  
---
The solution to this problem isn't to give random/solo Q survivors the same advantages a balance-breaking SWFs team has.  
---
And if they would do this (HEAVY buff to the survivor side) they would have to add something to the killer side aswell to even it out.  
---
Maybe something like a 5th perk for killers? 1 perk that's restricted to hex perks, while you can freely choose the other 4? So you could atleast slow down the game a bit more against these survivors who are going to play better.  
---
Or something that helps you to coordinate aswell, like a build in BBQ+Bitter Murmur?  
---
\---  
---
Just giving survivors these advantages would get rid of a lot of the chaos which killers need to win their games.  
---
This would just add more pressure to them, and we (talking as a killer main here) allready got enough of that.  
---
I personally would just leave it as it is right now, but reward killers if they face SWFs like this:  
---
2 friends + 1 solo q + 1 solo q = Killer gets 25% more BP.  
---
2 friends + 2 friends = Killer gets 50% more BP.  
---
3 friends + 1 solo q = Killer gets 75% more BP.  
---
4 friends = Killer gets 100% more BP.
---
I‚Äòm delivering something everybody needs to see

I think the devs dont want that dude... =[

Are you fingering these children?

FREDDY'S RISE UP
---
There is no duct tape on my cam?
---
I think the lack of certain information is part of the inherent game design, which is that of a horror game where you're working with strangers to escape a nightmare. Yes, I know, SWF, but that still focuses on the outside communication rather than the game itself telling you everything you want to know. I kinda like it how it works in that regard, and I think these changes would have the game giving the survivors way too much information that would dampen the spirit of it all.
---
It‚Äòs a passive perk. You don‚Äòt have to do anything for it to work, you don‚Äòt actively have to generate the situation (getting hit is pretty basic).
---
I read it here very often, how can a survivor be toxic? What do you think is toxic behaviour?
---
a tinned meat product made mainly from ham
---
The percentages are a little more complex to balance than you may think.
---
For example, say it was a 20% chance to kill.  That would mean that he would Auto Kill someone within the 1st 2 Hits 1/3 of the time which would seem Really strong
---
Honestly this is just a joke! But both can be highly toxic
---
alright bud u can eat my ass thanks
---
welp im done playing dwight
---
But this is spam, just normal gamrplay with a ear rape sound, and rofl you got that many subs but no views
---
How many bots do you need to subscribe to your shitty channel?
---
Yeah I know its a just. My question was meant seriously. What is toxic behaviour from a survivor?
---
I was called toxic because I was doing the generators
---
is this actually a part of the map? I've honestly never seen that hole.
---
It wasn‚Äôt psychological horror either. Just a sad story about a ghost mom trying to find her ghost kid and confusing living kids as her ghost kid until someone shows up with her ghost kid‚Äôs remains.
---
Yup it leads to the basement gen
---
"Genrush" bish thats the objective
---
My bad, I run predator. And it works surprisingly well on spirit.
---
Says the immersed Dwight
---
Looked very toxic. I would have gone for her. I don't like punishing the victim.
---
Bringing a key doesn't make a survivor weaker or easier to kill, how he or she plays determines that. A killer won't be able to eliminate a key carrier so easily early on if the survivor knows what they are doing and plays smart. Also Franklin's isn't an problem since a survivor can always go back and get the item unless another gets it which means someone will have a key to use.
---
Doc and clown literally laugh, how is that not higher tier?
---
Looping is TAHKSIC! How dare someone play the game the way it's intended!
---
I wonder the same about Nea. Not even joking, I find her model to be so weird in comparison to how clean Meg and the others are.
---
That cute lil eee
---
The video cut at the perfect moment
---
Good job avoiding everything I say
---
Putting an ear rape sound on a video doesnt make it a FUNNY video, and the 2 videos you posted until now are conssidered spam since they are here just to troll and dont contribute to anything
---
Also wanna talk about your sad subs that conssist of only bots? But hey if it makes you sleep better at night go for it but it just makes you really sad
---
Where I am, most of the talks guys are buff. The influence is getting to me.
---
Well, that's a question.
---
I know that bug. But IMO, that bug is pretty inconsistent, most of the time it doesn't happen, so still standing mind game is still viable.
---
Mama was made because the success of a short made by amateurs, the short was very good and creepy, the movie ... is not that good, sadly.
---
I'd put Leatherface with Plague and Hag. He sees like a guy to keep to himself too.
---
Machine gun build is BACK
---
Needs more shouting to be funny
---
I don't think that that's a bug
---
I think the mettle of man rework we are getting is a pretty decent fit honestly.
---
Having to protect my Allies is what i usually use MOM for in the first place, i try to unhook someone baiting the killer into hitting me injured - unhooking - body blocking with MOM to make sure my teammate can escape.
---
I don't mind playing against Legion now as a survivor.
---
I have more fun playing Myers personally but it's more for the spoops. I like finding the perfect semi-hidden place to stalk &amp; wait for them to run when they hear the tier-up.
---
That's right ! üòÜ
---
i find it funny and the millions of people who watch ochidos random moment videos also do, its just preference. and as for the subs i could tell you a 14,000,605 reasons why i have them but you wouldn‚Äôt believe any so whats the point in that, if you dont like it all you have to do is down vote not cry in the comments ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
i like this idea
---
also im going to carry on posting them every day and if you and other people dont like them down vote
---
To stop hour long standoffs between two entitled players.

Thank you

People like you should commit seppuku

:/
---
It only works for those games for me.
---
And sitting on gens for a game is not as much fun as it sounds.
---
All other game where killers actually move i usually get people that try to catch hatchets like they are playing dodgeball, and go down while throwing their first pallet (usually shack pallet is their prefered one)
---
Soo you just addmited that you will continue to spam
---
Hopefully the mods ban you from this sub
---
Holy crap this is too relatable. (Been putting it off all weekend)
---
You can actually hit them from a certain section of the railing during chase. I first learned from a video posted on this reddit forum. Brownie points for you if you can find it.
---
I‚Äôve seen the survivor jump then the hatch close interrupting the survivors jump
---
Ochidoo at least got famous by editing his shitty videos and didnt resort to buying bots like you did
---
And also you are comparing yourself to ochidoo, in this community?? Rofl you sure are a troll that wants to spam
---
Just like a rushed 4k, genrushing will not pip you. The entity requires that there be chases and jumpscares, etc. Therefore, just like a killer killing everyone too quickly, survivors completing the game too quickly will not benefit the survivors, and end up just wasting everyones time. This act, is called a genrush.
---
Now that somebody mentioned it,  Neas model is strange. Her face is up there with quentins  and I wouldn't mind a remodel for her either.
---
"I'M SOLO" 
---
"KILL THE RANDOMS"
---
hmm.... survivors try to mind game in lobby?
---
Oh no no, he said *fuck* the Japanese. You see there's a difference...
---
I have no comment to this. Sorry
---
no silly goose not ‚Äúspam‚Äù if i post a video or 2 a day that you dont like isn‚Äôt considered spam. just down vote and move on because right now you‚Äôre looking like a real bitch in the comments
---
I didn‚Äòt want to go too ham on her since she‚Äòs already a meme but yes, the face is my major issue.
---

Correction, after looking into it appears that they deemed transgenderism to be the physical response to the mental disorder Gender Dysphoria. They are not denying that transgendered individuals have a mental disorder, but they are denying that they have gender dysmorphia which used to be the standard classification placed upon such individuals.
---
Never vault pallet into the spirit, problem solved.
---
We all know how MoM works, why didn‚Äôt you just incorporate your idea at the beginning?
---
But yea, MoM should have been like that from the beginning; affecting M2 instead of M1. Pretty sure you would have heard minor complaints from the killer community. They just threw a load of garbage in the game without even testing it. BHVR confuses the hell out of me sometimes.
---
But, I‚Äôm perfectly good with the way they are changing now as well. I feel like it will be way less meta, which I‚Äôm okay with.
---
Rosa is Huntress
---
However, there is a classification that not all Transgender Individuals have Gender Dysphoria! It is important to note this!
---
Defenition of spam
---
irrelevant or unsolicited content sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing,annoying,  spreading malware, etc
---
Yea all your videos fall into this category
---
But its kinda funny seeing you get all worked out over your shitty videos as you keep defending them
---
god you are so so so dumb so so so so soooo dumb i never compared myself to him i gave an example of how people find them kind of videos funny now piss off back to your dating advice post you sad lonely man üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Is that a 180 into a flick it looks really weird
---
i don't say you should buff solo, i say that Bhvr want to make killer able to compete with swf, which implies either a big buff or the death of solo survivor teams.
---
\&gt;Myers
---
\&gt;Party
---
Pick one.
---
Hey I feel like one-upping you now. A survivor teabagging at the exit gate and as they leave, they learn that bloodwarden is activated.
---
There may be a few people that may not know what mom does so I included the description just in case.
---
‚ÄúI was looping him for 6 decades wtf you guys doing‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúSry I was looking for ruin‚Äù
---
I thought that said "The Final Pam" for a second.
---
Ok this story has a happy ending. I‚Äôm a survivor
---
main, and I played a match as killer to get my daily ritual. Team of 4, all had flashlights. I was getting swarmed every time I downed someone and tried to hook them. I thought, well if these survivors are going to play toxic, than I guess I‚Äôm going to have to play toxic as well. Proceeded to tunnel players and camp hooked survivors. In the end I killed two, and two escaped. Now when the match ended I was fully bracing myself to get cussed out in the chat for camping etc. To my surprise, everyone said gg, and one person said ‚Äúthanks for putting up with us and not DCing!‚Äù Made me happy.
---
I kinda do wanna see that
---
Every pig I play against gives me an immediate confidence boost because they are all blind
---
Lol I‚Äôve done that to survivors, but don‚Äôt forget when you‚Äôre looping the killer like a god and dead hard into a wall and die
---
There's plenty of horror movies with smart storytelling as well my friend.
---
T Bagging at exit gates and not leaving? T bagging after pallets or windows!
---
&gt;Overly greedy survivors
---
Yeah how dare people want to get saves, gen simulator is where the real gameplays at.
---
Sure camping works a lot but by god is it unfun and boring
---
There is a bug where you don't get bloodpoints unless you 99% the generator first before completing it. Maybe that was why.
---
How ? From what I know, Spine Chill trigger against the both, Spirit's Husk and Spirit in ethereal plane. So Spine Chill doesn't let you to know when she actually starts phasing.
---
Imagine having to see a persons previous posts to form an insult
---
Thats just sad
---
But wow I am feeling special, your doing all this work just cause I called you out on your shitty videos &lt;3
---
My opinion sure devastated you, but hey forget about working on your shitty videos, you should start working on your shitty personality
---
All BP categories max out at 8k so if you grind all the gens you will still only get 8k points for doing them
---
Well, I can see how that probably was a problem.
---
On survivor I tend to run: Lithe, Hope, Self Care and Adrenaline (if its meta im sorry)
---
On killer: Make your choice, NOED, ruin and haunted ground (this is probably more meta)
---
Devs dont give a shit about that since it helps survivors
---
If it helped killers in any way it would have gotten fixed allready
---
god your boring Zzzzz
---
wait were mori's used to be where they didn't have to be hooked?
---
The Man in the Mask from The Strangers
---
Killer: basement bubba Agitation,iron grasp, mad grit and territorial, 
---
I may shove them in the basement but I won‚Äôt camp them.
---
Survivor: Generator McGee , bond &amp; prove-thyself, streetwise with a commodious with brand new part and instructions slap on a shroud of binding and gens are done in under 3 mins tops.
---
What the actual fuck is that picture
---
Honestly im not sure why the killer can see anything at all
---
Cant be more boring that a person that finds loud noises funny
---
But will it actually make him stronger?
---
Hmmmmmm... with BHVR you can't know :D
---
I agree with your points. Those are good ideas, but they would have to rebalance the game in order to make them viable.
---
I mean the guy gets thousands of views, so clearly some people like him.
---
Maybe don't go to the shitpost subreddit if you want to watch JoJo's. Very spoiler heavy
---
This has Piggy on top. That tier list doesn't.
---
My favorite part was the random swing into the sky.
---
That was kinda the whole point of EGC. No one likes standoffs and this gives the key a very specific niche power now because without it, you‚Äôd be 99% boned after the killer closes the hatch.
---
NOED is cheap and used by bad killers. Adrenaline is fine.
---
Any meta perk is my guilty pleasures. I don't like using the meta cuz everyone uses counter play against it, I use that to my benefit. They don't expect the other perks, especially insidious. I'll use that perk on a near finished gen 7/10 I get a down off it (not good odds I know but I get great jump scares as killer) I use bond instead of self care. Killers won't give up chase cuz survivors will just heal immediately after it ends, so I use bond to find my team and get a heal and get them points rather quickly. Also it doesn't hurt to have the distraction of another survivor as well
---
They could lower to ground level like a crane hook then raise after they're on it.
---
I like to run dance with me, lithe, iron will, and self care if I‚Äôm trying to have some fun. I vault over a window and within 3 seconds hide. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times a killer has walked right by me lol.
---
haven‚Äôt you left yet? zzzzzzz
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend self care. It might seem easier to take 2 minutes and heal but what you‚Äôre really doing is wasting time.
---
Why is the side of kate‚Äôs Face so shiny?
---
Let's be honest, most people that would want to see this probably dont know the perks anyways.
---
Very silly to slug at one gen left
---
With it being the free weekend yes. Other times I can usually get a game in 5 mins
---
Nahh
---
Also ehy did you hide your sub count?
---
I wanted to say hi to the bots
---
This Ghostface is BHVRs Take on him. He's a Floridian Stalker-Serial Killer. His name is Hinted to be Olsen via his two Add Ons "Olsens Journal" and "Olsens Address Book" although this may be the Name of the survivor or a person he stalks.
---
You want it to work against exposed not m2? Because when Myers, no Ed, and haunted are not m2.
---
Alright thanks man!
---
I like Iron Will, Lightweight, Object of Obsession, and Sole Survivor so I guess I have 3-4 that aren't meta. I also really like Head On and I will run it more often once it isn't affected by Enduring.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Then how do I know if its a streamer I should mori?
---
For survivor it's the "I Got You Bro": Borrowed time, we're gonna make it, we're gonna live forever, and Dead Hard
---
For killer it's the "Nigtmare Freddy": Hex: The Third Seal, Knock out, monitor and abuse, and Franklin's demise
---
Nothing like hearing a loud snap across the map and all survivors being fine.
---
I never read about that in patch notes and I am 100% sure that developers said about an audio issue with Spirit after Plague patch ( and from this patch she has that bug ). 
---
So, yeah, it's a bug.
---
That's because they know Bill players would need a couple of games to achieve it.
---
guess your are still here üò´üò´üò´üò´ dont you have to awkwardly approach some women with your sick new one liners?
---
So is Doctor, in my personal opinion.
---
It's not this is from Aunty Donna. They're very funny you should check them out
---
I dunno, but the other day I lost a pip after the killer DC‚Äôd and it was kinda annoying. I shouldn‚Äôt get punished for the killer DCing
---
Only if the survivors get a Scooby spinning legs dash
---
We. Are. Sexy.
---
Other drafts for this title included ‚Äò‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù gone very wrong‚Äô and ‚ÄòI get stuck on three separate things in quick succession‚Äô
---
I‚Äôm 100+ hours into the game and I still don‚Äôt have a prestige. How‚Äôd you get p3 so quick?
---
Who went for the comment enjoy the ban?
---
How does Chucky carry them? 
---
Unless he is going to grow several feet the survivors can essentially lean backwards and stand up on their own 2 feet once again.
---
They are experiencing Gender Euphoria, the sensation of being happier in a different gender. The idea that Gender Dysphoria  must be present is bad because it says that all trans people are suffering and could lead to thoughts that they must be ‚Äúcured‚Äù. However, trans people can have gender dysphoria! But some, like myself, have gender euphoria, aka not necessarily feeling discomfort by ones assigned gender , but instead a euphoric feeling! Source: my therapist!
---
Rule 7 tho
---
Cock destroyers!
---
og or remake pennywise?
---
not many people run hope, I do occasionally and I wish more people did so props to you :D
---
also yeah, the killer ones are kinda meta, but hey if you enjoy the game that way then who cares. its about having fun :)
---
Flip-Flop belongs in S for how fukin funny it is when they pull it off.
---
commendable on not camping my dude.
---
also i might try out your survivor setup, thats genius
---
the one from the books.
---
I mean, they did make Deerstalker, knock out, and third seal.
---
Very bad
---
fair play with both and i see the benefits, might give them a try myself :P
---
Yeah like hope is really good in the exit gate scenario especially against 110% speed killers
---
lmao its always great when you get those little victories
---
Being invisible as a killer is good though, just not the waiting for a hit.
---
*roles out redheads pinkie finger with cheap gin bottle*
---
That‚Äôs what makes it even scarier.
---
It means they **don‚Äôt need them.**
---
fair play, you don't usually see that many people using object of obsession or sole survivor. why do you like them specifically?
---
:0 both of those look fantastic, mind if i try them?
---
Eh, we're so close to the release of a new full chapter that it seems woefully unlikely that we're only getting a killer. They haven't been spending almost a whole month on creating two more perks.
---
As for their decision to omit details of a survivor or map from the livestream schedule, hey, you gotta keep some surprises.
---
Part 4 though.
---
i hear you, some parts can be taken into consideration like ‚Äúself promotion‚Äù but if the mods haven‚Äôt flagged it or removed it then...
---
thats fair enough, as long as your having fun then who cares :D its a game after all
---
I only play survivor with ace and plunder just to get items. Its the only reason i play survivor. So i feel it.
---
This was a glitch from a couple months ago where the name of the map would remain on your screen and you couldn‚Äôt see skillchecks the whole game.
---
Yeah that's the problem isn't it XD Using the top addons to even make them slightly useful xD
---
I really hope it doesn't become another perk where people are just gonna save me Infront of the killers eyes and farm me
---
Survivor here, I don‚Äôt hate the legion anymore, after his change I put him on the ‚Äòpesky and annoying‚Äô tier, like doctor. Not particularly too strong, but can be annoying to play against with the mending
---
the perk your looking for is deliverance and ive tried it before but it never works out for me because i usually get hooked/die first. im kinda unlucky haha. i like what youre doing with killer though, i use those perks frequently too
---
They want low effort karma points. It won't change since it's the community that gives them power.
---
Ah, okay.
---
Could you at least tag it as spoilers
---
Honestly at this point I'd be fine with one of those meme tier lists where its something stupid like "how stinky the killers feet are" if they are actually ranked instead of, 1 on S tier the rest on F tier.
---
Staying alive is making others miserable now?
---
what about wraith? he sounds like an elephant. at least A tier
---
definitely, a top-tier perk
---
Definitely
---
*angry elephant noises*
---
Kids/teenagers hate it cause they are broke
---
I can't wait for it to be honest 
---
Even people who don't buy it will gain if they grind it out.
---
this. this is what started my deep love for amanda that has now made me the butt of all jokes in my dbd group
---
I saw Luigi but not Mario
---
I mean, clearly you also have a problem with a perks since you‚Äôre calling sprint + urban a disgusting combo. I can assure you I do none of these things, other than not looking behind me in chases which I assuredly need to improve on. Listing what makes a bad player doesn‚Äôt help anybody, so if you have a problem with the perks and think there is a better loadout which would be more helpful to a group, please share it with me and I will happily switch my perks.
---
Yeah, I mean if you're straight up prestige-ing your characher without doing anything else, you probably should reach p3 pretty quickly. I just checked it, and I've got my III-50 achievement on 18th of December, while I bought the game around Halloween sale. So yeah, it was around 1.5-2 month to get me first p3, but I was also levelling other characters in parallel too.
---
Besides, I still was a pretty much huge noob back then. Crouching on the outskirts of the map and shit :D I remember getting my way up to rank 1 by being immersive like crazy. Freddy was the scariest killer for me... What a times.
---
Joseph is freddy teir after the nerf.
---
But bell ghost makes elephant noises :(
---
Sure thing bud
---
How in the fuck is listing bad habbits that new players do ‚Äúnot help anybody‚Äù? That is the definition of educating.
---
And I have enough experience in this game to know that you do exactly everything I just listed. The urban evasion and sprint burst + you not looking behind you proves it.
---
Object of Obsession can be used to bait the killer before vanishing etc. Also, if you flash your screen in the killer's direction before turning back, the killer probably won't see you in return. Sole Survivor just makes it stronger but I don't always run that.
---
I normally run:
---
Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Spine Chill, and BT. (kinda meta I know, but i solo queue.)
---
But for a fun build, i like to run:
---
Lithe, Dance W/ Me, Quick and Quiet, and Diversion. (Using lithe, dance with me, and quick and quiet to make the killer lose you, then pebble to make them go away is so satisfying.)
---
Yeah, namely the 'Broken Key.'
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy if true
---
Because they can‚Äôt afford it so they want everyone else to suffer with them
---
Dont try that shit at low walls though &gt;.&gt;
---
The only thing I can see being an issue, is the battle pass not having cosmetically for your character/the ones that are arent worth whatever the battle pass costs
---
Gotta turn towards the wall or face somewhere they can't blind you before.
---
3 Gen Nightmare: Overcharge, PGTW, BBQ (points) and preferably Hundreds Lullaby, but after prestiging him the game outright refuses to give me it, so I use Sloppy instead. With either double Blocks or Jump Rope + Green Dress, this set up is a monster. Free wake ups, but they lose 15% each time. Combine with PGTW and Huntress Lullaby, they can lose up to 46% (25% from PGTW and 21% from the OC / Lullaby skill check). Blocks make it so they get the penalty faster, but the Rope + Dress ensures they don't make progress while you chase someone.
---
Survivor is Santa Ace. Ace in the hole, Plunderer's, Open Handed, and WGLF / Kindred for a serious perk. I'd use Bond so everyone gets items, but Ace doesn't have it. Still, Free Skeleton Keys with Blood Amber and Prayer Ropes, Rainbow Maps with Jelly and stamps, Commodious Toolboxes with Hacksaws and Wire Spools, Utility Flashlights with double batteries, and Ranger Med Kits with Gel Dressings and Scissors for All!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLJncuS_-IU
---
That‚Äôs happened to me before as well.. doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
It will be a good addition to the game no matter what people say.
---
Agreed it does feel good lol.
---
My Survivor: MoM, Borrowed Time, Sprint Burst, Self Care or Spine Chill
---
My Two killers: Hag: Hex: Ruin, Distressing, Unnerving Presence, BBQ &amp; Chili (scum bag I know but just wait) 
---
Farmer Legion: Hex: The Great Hunt (I think that‚Äôs the name) Distressing, BBQ, and the legion gen perk
---
It technically couldn't since you have to take hits for people
---
I‚Äôm really not trying to start an argument here, I‚Äôm just asking you to share what perks you think would be more efficient. I‚Äôve been playing this game for two years and came back after a break, so I‚Äôm not sure what perks are even good anymore. If you want to think all of the things you listed are true then go ahead, I really don‚Äôt care.
---
P3 Freddy.
---
Darn.
---
It was just a bug that happened chill out with your angry ass
---
What time and where to watch the livestream? I'm at school and most game sites are blocked I can't access anything lol
---
The only time tunneling is really frustrating is when other survivors are right in the killer's path and they run past them without engaging to go straight for the recently hooked survivor, complete tunnel vision. I get it's an easy down, but it's just a shitty move and really unfun to play against. Coming out of a match with so few bp because you were tunneled right at the start can be really disheartening. Most things endgame feel fair though.
---
Just comment this on every huntress video. Cracks me up every time
---
Yeah yeah, you deleted the "lol yeah right, mate"
---
There's a lot of psychological reasons why I personally hate battlepasses as well as the fact that they often end up sucking the fun out of the game.
---
With the right amount of skill and a good load out you can get a merciless victory against anyone
---
A snail without a shell
---
its just the dwights are normally the ones climbing into the lockers
---
Not saying I'm a slugger, but what's wrong with it?
---
Clever gal
---
Cool what they do that was toxic though
---
What do the current add-ons have to do with Legion being worse now than he used to be? He, as a killer, is far stronger than he used to be, not weaker, and I don't see how anyone could think otherwise. Before he moved at the same speed as the Huntress, Spirit and Hag, but unlike them, he actually had to chase survivors like that conventionally, assuming he isn't moonwalking or using Frank's Mixtape. Now at least he's in the same level as every other killer. Right now he's a killer who excels at hitting multiple survivors in a short amount of time, and forces them to complete an additional action once out of the chase, wasting a massive amount of time over the course of a match. Old Legion relied on abusing mechanics or broken add-ons in order to do anything.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, it‚Äôs just a bit of a toxic way to play. Which is why I got so much satisfaction from thisüòÄ
---
FUCKING CORN BLINDNEEEEEESSSSSS
---
I will always do this for a survivor who traded hooks unhooking me. I need the hero to live on.
---
Doggo about to DC
---
Gives who power?
---
You're pretty much wasting the perk if you don't.
---
So in other words, the nurse is now the spirit
---
This exactly. Moris are fine as they are and you don't deserve the salt for using them. It's just when the killer tunnels you right off first hook to get that kill that is annoying to play against. I don't think hooking every survivor before using it is a requirement or anything, but that's how I play too when I use them. It also just helps to farm more points as killer to keep folks alive for chasing longer.
---
Yea just put her on mute if she gets unbearable. Most of the time she‚Äôs normal, but sometimes she gets triggered over nothing and starts attacking new viewers in her chat, and then the whole chat starts talking shit and attacking the random ass dude that just asked a question that she took the wrong way.
---
This happened every time I opened up her stream lol, I started defending this one dude that got perma banned and legit shat on by everyone in the stream for asking if the guy she‚Äôs playing with is gay. 
---
I got perma banned for asking her to replay a funny clip she showed and I missed, she legit busted all kinds of veins bruh
---
*Menacingly!*
---
Tbh, when people are in a chase, they usually are not trying to lead the killer to you, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs the only way they can go to juke. Most of the times it‚Äôs just bad luck.
---
Go ahead. Spread the survivor love! Bond would replace Kindred / WGLF, but I don't have Bond on anyone with a high Plunderer's and Ace in the Hole, and vice versa.
---
Warning about the Nightmare: games will be long if you protect the 3 gens closest, but it will be a total wash if they manage to sneak one of those gens. A niche, but effective build. 
---
Another fun build is ninja Doc. Double Calm + M&amp;A makes your terror radius as small as 12 meters in punishment out of a chase, and as big as 52 meters in treatment during the chase, which is when you'll be in treatment at first so the survivors can't escape his madness. Best on something like Lerys or the Game.
---
People posting low effort memes.
---
You‚Äôll be alright
---
Are you sure? Do you have the inside scoop? They probably couldn't afford the likeness so they had to make do. What's with the assumption that they didn't even try?
---
smart play
---
Hmm, her personality sounds questionable but if I can learn something from her then I guess it‚Äôs worth it
---
Exist. Most likely.
---
Almost has fun as literally just holding m1 to mend
---
I'm a speedy af neon haired Feng ingame, I just had to make up a decent sounding name for my 5th reddit account.
---
Because Kyle Gallner literally posted on twitter (or instagram, forgot which) saying that he had no idea his character (Quentin) was even in the game until after release.
---
They never even approached him.
---
Satisfying af. Even for a killer main
---
You're doing gods work.
---
Enduring, brutal strength, BBQ, and Monitor &amp; abuse/whispers
---
Your next line is:
---
*DISCONNECT*
---
Welcome back! The DC's are worse because they made it so you can't derank by DCing
---
Flip flop. Tenacity and unbreakable are mine
---
Yup, great for surprising survivors working on the basement gen with a nearly full charged chainsaw or an iridecent hatchet ready.
---
Are you lost?
---
Yeah this is my freind who was in the game
---
Or have him such his finger placement to the middle finger. Lol
---
And burnt alive
---
r/lostredditors
---
what is this meme even about? lol
---
Why is lightweight so low? I lose so many killers with this.
---
r/notlostonlytrolling
---
No. Just having some fun
---
every Killer is okay at Red ranks, some are just more difficult
---
what were the match results?
---
Don't forget Legion can do this too. I think people forget that Deep Wounds is it's own health state, meaning Adrenaline only heals you to injured and MoM will never proc if you get hit from this state.
---
People really underestimate how well Legion can counter a lot of meta perks right now and still see them as awful after the extensive nerfs.
---
Yeah, it was changed. Noed used to only be usable when all five generators were repaired, since that was the only way for exit gates to be powered, since you couldn't close hatch. You are correct though
---
Tip: hold your swing, just like when facing Dead Hard.
---
I wouldn't call dbd a competitive game, it's a casual game. And since you can't ban people from playing a game just because they have shit internet (yes I agree they shouldn't play, but they can) they are still gonna need a way to distinguish between these things.
---
I meet a ton of people with shit connections all the time because of where I live in the world. Sometimes because of distance and sometimes because neighbouring countries might not have great internet. It's just something we are gonna have to live with in any online game. Dedicated servers hopefully will help with this.
---
But yes the majority of dc's come from ragequitting or picking which killer they want to play against which is a problem
---
Interesting

I'd say if they fixed his pallet vaulting and stun timer, he'd be in a decent spot. As-is, those two things pull him down too far in my opinion. On the other hand, never seeing legion isn't exactly an unwelcome change to me
---
You don‚Äôt have to play Billy or Nurse, those 2 killers make it much easier to successfully win the trial though. Billy has high mobility and insta downs. Nurse can ignore loops. 
---
When people say ‚Äúred ranks‚Äù they are saying that with the assumption survivors are going to play optimally. When survivors play optimally, generators gets done very quickly and they can loop killers very well. So, if you are on any killer but those two, the trial is under extreme time restrictions. One fuck up on a M1 killer and you‚Äôve potentially lost the game. This game is not forgiving against good survivors.
---
I don't see any purple flashlights
---
For survivor (when playing alone): Aftercare, Deliverance/Kindred, Borrowed Time, Iron Will    
---
When I‚Äôm playing with my friends I have a variety of perks I like. It depends who I‚Äôm playing. I pretty much like to always run Borrowed Time and Iron Will though, kind of my two crutch perks. Perks I like consist of: Poised, Lightweight + Dance w/ Me, Flip Flop + Unbreakable, Deceive Strike, Break Down, Distortion, Prove Thyself... I feel like I could name a lot more.

For killer, I don‚Äôt have too much perk options. For Freddy I run an End Game build which consists of NOED, Blood Warden, Fire Up with a sprinkle of Save The Best For Last in there. For Doctor, I‚Äôm still trying to build his main build. What I have so far is Fire Up, Distressing, STBFL  and Overcharge
---
I Maine‚Äôs both Spirit and huntress to get and stay at red ranks. I didn‚Äôt play anyone else either.
---
What no. I believe my idea is different from the Spirit.
---
Huntress and Hag can do the same as nurse
---
Best thing to do is keep running, when I play spirit I will stand there and either get the grab or people will run back and forth refusing to vault, and I will wait for the recharge phase, run to the other side and then hit. Accuracy doesn't even matter because the person running back and forth usually ends up running straight into the hit.
---
At least if you're gonna run back and forth don't do it mindlessly.
---
Dwight *delivere* to parties, he doesn't *attend* them!
---
Is pipping how people decide whether a game was worth its time or not?
---
yea. the best ranks are around 10. Around 20 is too easy and around 1 is too sweaty. I may try to get to rank 1 only once for the achievement and that's it
---
Anyone can say the same about swf.  They are both game breaking aspects added without thought of balance 
---
Both need hard nerfs
---
NO DWIGHT LEFT BEHIND 
---
I am the Dwight that refuses to leave the baby feng who can‚Äôt find the door after bullying the killer behind.
---
The only thing you're right about here, is that the effectiveness of adrenaline is decided by who's using it, and their teammates. Adrenaline is worthless if the person just goes down immediately because they're still a grade A potato.
---
Adrenaline on a competent player? If you don't have noed, you get a hit on them, they juke you for the remaining two generators and boom, now you lost the chase entirely, and gates will be open before you catch them, and you now have literally no way to get survivors to play altruistic, and thus there's no endgame for you. The perk has incredible potential, just like noed, and both have the potential to end up completely wasted under certain circumstances. They're both still insanely potent as long as they come into play at a relevant time(This clip is a perfect showcase of a game going from a potential 4K to a most likely 1K)
---
That too
---
I quote one of the devs "People seem to forget that killers have long arms as well" or something like that. Hitting slightly past a fence/grate thing makes sense
---
Pretty much nailed it. Other killers can succeed, but they better be optimised with perks and be running some decent add ons. The mobility of Nurse, Billy, and even Spirit just separates them from the pack as they can inflict the most pressure even before you take perks and add ons into account.
---
Yea thats fair. Maybe if they lowered the effectiveness but made it stackable? So like, 5-7% lower repair speed, each time an obsession is hooked. So like, you are inclined to go for your obsession early, keeping the essence of the perk, while not completely fucking them. And if you are playing an swf, they may be a bit more inclined not to decisive, but rather let their team try to save them, because creating a new obsession opens the opportunity to get punished more
---
See that's an explanation that makes sense, because even with as much as I play the game (which admittedly isn't THAT much) I know I'm not the best at looping and I regularly mess up
---
WAH
---
Ahhh, a Legion player
---
I see you, too, are a killer of culture
---
Dude, everything a Killer does is considered toxic in Dead by Daylight.  
---
Camping? Toxic. Even though you fuck overly altruistic people with it.  
---
Tunneling? Toxic. Even if the injured guy runs straight at you and he's the only one you see.   
---
Picking any top tier or annoying killer? Toxic.  
---
Slugging? Toxic. Even though it's also a valid strategy in some cases.  
---
Ruin? BBQ? NOED? Toxic.  
---
Just play what you want and have fun.
---
Excuse me I don‚Äôt want to 360 because of toxicity I just want to know how to get out of sticky no-pallet situations because my teammates constantly use up 90% of them in the first five minutes
---
Bond is not just for teaming up, its also for survivors that suck at keeping track of the killer.
---
I try to get others to use it when they complain about getting accidentally sandbagged.
---
yeah why is that guy running up the ante, its a really bad perk.
---
I used to play Huntress but I just can't get the hatchet throw timing/aiming down for anything above yellow ranks, so I've changed to being a dirty Legion main
---
Not tried much of Spirit admittedly
---
It'a so hard to hold with that puppet.
---
Ahhh. It happend to me a lot when I played as a survivor :D.
---
I disagree.
---
I have more of a push to get gens done because if the EGC starts there is a crazy slim chance i will open a gate.
---
finding a hatch is very unlikely aswell due to the killer probably seeing it during a chase or something.
---
I agree. I feel like hag is underrated as a killer and if she‚Äôs played well she‚Äôs HARD to go against. (I don‚Äôt go against her much on console)
---
I feel like Autodidact deserves a higher rating, as it starts off bad, but overall is an extremely helpful perk.
---
Huntress at least deserves B. Especially with her "Child Tantrum" stun sound. We all know the one. Now imagine that but her stamping her foot on the floor.
---
There were much nicer ways to go about it than how you did.
---
Though his "URGH!" one is badass.
---
I thought so too! She's doing the 'look up teabag' and even took a hit for it, definitely looks like she screwed over the Dwight intentionally.
---
I may have still hooked the Dwight because of how time investment in the chase works and since the killer was already so close to downing him anyway, but I would've tunneled the fuck out of the trolling survivor afterward.
---
This is what I feel every time when I face a killer with no ed. It‚Äôs hilarious when a perk that can‚Äôt be used till endgame doesn‚Äôt work. RIP
---
If that were me, I'd be on the ground, stuttering about with exhaustion. Must have been some amazing ping
---
Kindred Exists...
---
I really hope I didn't P3 freddy just to have the rework make me not like playing him
---
So....always?
---
I've hit survivors who have dead hard more than once and I have four P3 killers. Honestly, sometimes you're just not paying attention, trying too hard or maybe you're too tilted to focus. It has nothing to do with being bad, you mong
---
There's at least 10 of us
---
I just finished and I'm so happy, but best of luck to everyone else !! You got this üòò
---
It weakens the team permanently, as there's always one teammate who can't go past the injured state.
---
Ma ma
---
Generally.
---
*Manic giggling intensifies*
---
I‚Äôm perfectly fine at looping it‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm in open areas with no loops nearby I‚Äôd just like to have a little time to escape
---
Video games have some cool characters that would make for fun killers as well. I'm not all that into this genre but maybe the walrider from Outlast or Mr X from Resident evil.
---
I don't need to watch it because eventually Reddit will post every single frame from every episode in unrelated subreddits.
---
***HUEGHUEGHUEG***
---
I definitely could‚Äôve phrased my comments in a better way. Again, I‚Äôm sorry if anything I said came across as rude or offensive, that was not my intention at all.
---
I like this perspective! Really drives the madness home!
---
I mean the spirit is cool and all but why should there be two of her. The nurse is fine where she is because she has a high skill requirement. The reason legion was a problem was the opposite, low skill, low counterplay, and so he was boring.
---
Obsession perks, IMO, are most fun when one survivor and the killer run them, cause they each have trade offs and can create situations where there‚Äôs one really powerful survivor, but that survivor also empowers the killer. 
---
As you said, they‚Äôre great extensions of each other
---
MoM against a decent Billy is practically useless...
---
It's either noed or monstrous shrine sooo
---
Lmaooo
---
Well, if you didn't pip, you also probably didn't earn many points. A game that's over in 5 minutes usually leaves all survivors with like 8-10K points, which isn't worth that much
---
Slugging has been added to the list of ‚Äútoxic‚Äù things the killer can‚Äôt do according to the survivors. Noted
---
Totally agree, I think thats why the mods are expanding.
---
Also happy cake day
---
Ones an reward other for getting shit done. The other is an award for not getting shit done... if you cant see that you're blind..

I wish I could get murdered in such a visually pleasing manner.

yes because if hes RIGHT there its pointless where just swapping places  . which i would get if ur a good freind or a camping billy
---
mama energy
---
I guess OP just wants us to leave him on the hook when a killer camps, oh well
---
Do folks ever play Spirit with Insidious? I've never played her before but think that could produce some fun.
---
(Or is this exactly what this is talking about and I'm being whooshed?)
---
One survivor is hooked, other three survivors are in the basement after making noise (falling into the basement stairs) to alert the killer they're in the basement?
---
That's not camping. What are you going to do, ignore all four survivors? Let them get the unhook for free? It's like when you basement someone and the rescuer fast-vaults the shack window and you get the notification; you're not camping if you head back to the fucking basement.
---
Ok but bubba can bring his Chili so clearly top tier for me
---
Need to acknowledge the solid name choices üëåüèª
---
‚ÄúWhat became of the receptionist after she lost Jim to his sports addiction‚Äù
---
Not pointless, if they hit the person who got unhooked they should be able to runaway and you only get smacked once if even, the point is to unhook in front of his face
---
New nurse and spirit:
---
Both have 110 movespeed
---
Both have 24m terror radius
---
Both have a sound queue when power is activated outside TR
---
Both have a 15 second charge on their power
---
Both have a power than makes them invisible, speed them up, gives a speed boost after appearing, and they can't see survivor when cloaked.
---
Now you're downvoting my posts so its very clear you are a troll. Make a legitimate point or I won't be responding further.
---
Because at high ranks, no one cleanses against the plague and she's just another M1 killer.
---
They were really close by. They should've heard the humming. Just saying it was an extraordinarily dumb move.
---
Spirit memes are the new meta here it seems
---
It is a very hard perk to use and I fail often but succeeding is satisfying.
---
Exactly! It takes less than a minute for four survivors to find two generators and double-up on them to repair them to 100%
---
If you end up with a team so potato that they can't even spare 60 seconds to find and hop on a generator and pop it with a fellow survivor, do you really deserve to escape?
---
Besides you could still repair two generators if you were very sneaky, the killer patrolling all 7 takes a fair amount of time (not enough to pop a single generator alone, probably, but if they proxy the generator you were repairing, you can move off to another).
---
I do feel like the killer should still get an option (a switch in the basement maybe?) to trigger the EGC if they can't find the survivor.
---
Yup, I‚Äôm thinking of making a diorama of the basement with the locker and a hook, hopefully I can do that sometime soon!
---
Princess Claudette? Never seen her.
---
oh so slugging is a bad thing now, noted. 
---
So if you look for me ill be over there in Lampkin Lane repairing all gens to 99% so you guys can just come over and finish them 
---
- With love   Michael.
---
Not really. It‚Äôs no scarier than Bendy or FNAF or other horror kids games.
---
And yet people say this game is dying
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll definitely check him out. It‚Äôll be nice to have more insight into perk builds and why they are actually good and useful
---
I feel like if the 2nd last survivor is killed and 2 gens have not been powered, egc triggers after like 30 seconds.
---
Even before the free weekend I was still getting matches like this.
---
I play more survivor then killer
---
This. This so much
---
It is good against No One Escapes Death too.
---
I wanted the free barbecue and chili stack, plus the other survivor seen vaulting away came back around for him like I thought she would. After the hook I went after the Feng and downed her, she DC'd immediately and I left Dwight alone until the end of the game where he was my final kill.
---
No need to apologise friend, and thank you again for the streamer suggestions
---
i literally would have walked in and let him kill me...  
---
  
---
...so I could be struck by a smooth criminal
---
He is the most unsettling killer to play against, just see his white face looking at you, then you panic and wonder how long he has been there.
---
Jake is Korean(-american). Min is Chinese.
---
sloppy is a crutch????
---
Jeez I can tell that playing too much killer has made you angry. This post was intended as light heartedly as possible, but you came over here and had to make it a survivor vs killer debate.
---
If the killer is right there he'l either grab you off of the rescue, or smack you first and has recovered when you are done unhooking, and can smack you again to put you on the hook instead.
---
The point of BT is to unhook while the killer is close enough for the terror radius, but far enough away that he can onoy get 1 smack off (either on you uninjured, or the unhooked with BT)
---
Only go for a face unhooking if you have MoM ready, or are still on your DS timer, or are sure the killer will tunnel the unhooked due to prior behaviour.
---
I need the name of the shirtless David.
---
Nah I agree.  I love Clown's design, but he's hands down the worst killer in the game IMO.  I'm surprised you didn't also point out the fact that he slows himself down when he throws a bottle, or the fact that he gets brutally hard-countered by just camping Pallets, especially since he doesn't have anything to make him any more of a threat in dead-zones.  At his core, Clown is everything wrong with the "Chase Power = Good" mentality, and as much as I'd like to see him buffed I don't see anything meaningful happening any time soon.
---
Believe me, I could rant about how I think most people have Clown and Freddy swapped in their tier lists, though I do hope that Clown gets some love soon.
---
"why are we still,here just to suffer"
---
You can't "force it out" when all 4 survivors run in.

What does it matter? Killers only really do it to dodge SWF.
---
SWF tend to use third-party software, which is treated as cheating by Dead by Daylight EULA.

---
I watched that on Netflix right after seeing your comment and while the special effects and the general disgustingness and believeability of the Thing are top-notch, I couldn't stretch my suspension of disbelief enough to enjoy the story. Not because of the creature, but the human characters. They were acting way too chill for half the film, as if man-eating aliens were a common occurrence that didn't deserve careful discussion and planning. The script could have been much better.
---
Still, thanks for the recommendation.

---
Filthy dying light user here:
---
I will often have a soft focus on the obsession, but that focus doesn't need to extend beyond the activation of DL. 
---
We in it to have fun not make toxic experiences for everyone
---
Although this might be good for bloodpoints, might make the game feel over complicated without adding too much, especially for new players
---
I really hate a Legion fitted out for detection, if I'm understanding his new power, the "Killing Instinct" matches his terror radius.
---
So when a Legion gets into a chase with Monitor &amp; Abuse (+8 meters inside of a chase) and Distressing and winds up with a 48 meter terror radius it feels like you can't hide, particularly on maps where the loops are in the center.
---
Getting caught anywhere near the center of the map or any central building means the Legion has a truly massive Killer Instinct range, 48 meters in every direction, 96 meters across, and they get addons (including common addons!) to increase this range.
---
It takes anti-stealth to a whole new level, the Doctor only gets one free scream off you and otherwise has to shock you directly to make you hit madness 2 (unless you're not careful), and even that second scream can be timed when he's busy with something.
---
Having a Legion whose Killer Instinct radius exceeds his TR and will come barreling at you from across the map just isn't fun; you didn't mess up, some other survivor took a Deep Wound hit and screwed you over.
---
Ez clap
---
No i dont see it ass a problem, never said that and apologise if i made it seem that way. I do see this game as survivor favored even in solo, i have my most fair games as survivor when one survivor dc at the start (rank 6 atm, pc). Eccept from vs the nurse ofc... but as a side note the killer will PROBABY find one of the gens with survivors within 44 sec and can stop it and start a chase. Definatly if the killer is using ruin imo.
---
deserved it for tunneling?
---
what a farmer
---
Oink
---
I totally agree. I think it's a battle of skill caps. It's hard to do awful as clown in 'normal' matches because he's an M1 killer who will do okay against average survivors, while Freddy has more obvious drawbacks. A master-class Freddy will terrify me despite his situational chase potential, because he will know exactly where he needs to be to stop progress. He has amazing awareness at the cost of immediate pressure, but great players can use his unique traits to devastating effects. 
---
All this is in no way saying Freddy is a good killer, he just requires a playstyle few people know how to use or play against. This is all while Clown has very little in terms of "higher gameplay." He's a chase-oriented killer who relies on chase perks more than anyone. Pig has a situational but effective anti-looping ability, which at the very least has the survivor abandon the loop and at best almost guarantees a hit in some areas. She also has the traps to slow the game down long enough to have the time to commit to a chase.
---
If Clown has consistently fast downs, he still won't compete against even Wraith, who has so many nuances with his power to utilize in and out of chases. The problem with Clown is that he's just straightforward and simple. Even if the player can land every bottle spot-on with 100% accuracy, why not just play the Huntress then? She still gets looped but has the pallet mindgames of whether to chuck a hatchet or keep running through. I don't think Clown will get changed because, as I said in my previous comment, and increase in slow from the gas will make him unfair and unfun.
---
There really isn't even a whole lot you can change about his power aside from fiddling with the duration or adding more debuffs. Nothing they do can be super drastic because of how easy it is to land bottles. He's just the epitome of a low skill floor and low skill ceiling. I really hope he gets some love in the future but I doubt it with all the other killers who need tweaks (Nurse, LF, Spirit's OP addons, and likely Plague judging by her low play rate).
---
Cause plague doesn't stop loops, being down one health state doesn't magically take away the ability to run tiles and use pallets.
---
After some thought, I actually do think aftercare should be in A. I have never had someone do it next to me, but if that happened I would probably agree and move it.
---
As a killer I have yet to have a survivor find the hatch before I can close it post egc update.  The new hatch mechanic is a joke for us.  Once it's closed they are guaranteed to die.  No way you let a survivor complete the handle before you interrupt them.
---
Decisive only affects bad killers that tunnel off hook.  It only has an effect if you let it.  And MoM is about to be nerfed to uselessness with the protection hits requirement.
---
DbD is a fun experience, that we get to have when the SWF groups are away.
---
It's like a resort, and when it's busy season the staff don't get to enjoy the environment and perks, instead they have to just smile and nod as the SWF teabag and click torches.
---
Weird. If both are based on facts, what makes them different?
---
If the RBT gets put on you before the gens are done, you still have to get it off
---
no, but shitty matchmaking does. dude is clearly outclassed, and then OP has the audacity of mocking him on reddit. like ok dude
---
Literally no one says Urban Evasion and Iron Will is crutch are you delusional?
---
That's something that I looked at, and honestly think that the added complexity, which I don't thinknis that great, considering it is just set and forget, would allow new players to understand what sort of things might be required of them during a trial and encourage them to try out the more challenging roles, like being a distraction.
---
Would be a reason to add new tutorials, like a Altruist one where you need to make a safe rescue with an AI killer "nearby" to provide a moving terror radius.
---
It's okay &lt;3

Not so much letting them live, not hitting them since you lose tokens on each hit. A stack of 8 can end a chase really quick.

Nah, it's old folks that remember the time when cosmetics were part of the game and you had all the content once you bought a game.

*while playing as the spirit*

I agree. It seems the higher you go in rank the less urgency there is. Most of the random survivors I encounter at high rank are fucking cowards and play 90000% immersed. I have a better chance relying on Rank 20‚Äôs for support than the Rank 1-4‚Äôs most times. It‚Äôs sandbag and then hide on hatch city. Hatch stand offs are now between survivors and not the killer and survivor. 
---
Also can I just say it‚Äôs fucking amazing that Rank 1-4 on PS4 is full of people can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt power through Ruin? For fucks sake just POWER THROUGH IT.
---
I hooked a Nea who was annoying me all game, then downed the Feng and took her to the hatch, dropped her on top,  as soon as the Nea died I spammed to close the hatch, right as I did, Feng DC'd. It looked like I smashed her head with the hatch.
---
Depends. If you run him well enough there won't be too many opportunities to go for a chainsaw.
---
That‚Äôs just a smart play though. If 3 injured people are gonna fuck around with each other in the same part of the map might as well down them all. Slugging is toxic when you refuse to put anyone on hook for the entire game. Not sure I would be calling this billy a slugger unless he was doing it all game.
---
Why do people keep saying it will be free cosmetics? Has that been confirmed somewhere? I thought the point of a battle pass was that you buy it.

I'm down in rank 14/17 and I rarely get dcs :)

Supposed to be lighthearted but said he got what he deserved even though it was the best choice in the situation. You seem a bit confused

"Slugger" like it's a derogatory term.

This is what happened to me. Someone dc'd and I saved both my teammates from hooks, but got 1 hooked for it. Then they farmed just to pour salt in the wound :(
---
That‚Äôs true, but someone on this thread convinced me that with a full priced game with a lot of DLC (which by themselves is fine) doesn‚Äôt need a Battlepass. I would like something to grind for tho
---
Thats the reason. Itd be interesting to see what they put in it

if survivors don't see it how do you know you look like you said you look ?

Am I not supposed to have what I want? What I need?

Garbage meme on both sides.

Oh yeah I‚Äôve definitely seen where I‚Äôm doing this and the two remaining guys don‚Äôt bother to unhook. Lol that‚Äôs another unfortunate outcome. That‚Äôs why if I am trying this I go as far away as possible to try and encourage them to try.
---
You must have misinterpreted, I said there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it at the beginning.
---
Japanese from Japan ?
---
Exactly this. To claim NOED is op is to claim Ruin is op. I see NOED more as a fallback rather than a clutch. On top of that, it‚Äôs a punishment for survivors for leaving the dull totems. More so than that, it makes them get the fuck out.

I fat fingered it was supposed to say viable lol

It‚Äôs the same on PS4. Red rank is absolutely horrible for it.

I know right? If you're literally in my face I'm going at least hit you once before picking up the guy I just downed, so that you can't body block without going down again.

I feel like the killer deserved a 3k for this, since they didn't go out of their way to slug.
---
Uhhhhhhhhh, that‚Äôs a lot of time that‚Äôs passed. There‚Äôs a news section where they post major patches and balancing updates. Idk how far back it goes m8
---
and i love you, random Freddy main
---
What's wrong with him?
---
I take you home, you husband now
---
She could just see you crouching away and just phase there as soon as it recharges
---
I hate to tell you this, but...(that's what it's for.)
---
No u
---
If only more CEO's had this mentality. 
---
The Anthem debacle aka "BioWare magic" really exposed how a shitty management team and infighting can derail an entire project or studio.
---
Gamers are passionate about their product and unfortunately a lot of the time, the people on the bottom end of the totem poll tend to put up with the most vitriol. You couldn't pay me enough to be "Community Manager" or the face/voice of a franchise.
---
Ok, I had a period where I played other games so I missed a lot of updates, I‚Äôll look at the news section now thanks
---
I am not saying all but the more revelant things
---
-Endgame Collapse: When one gate is open or the killer closes the hatch (The killer can close the hatch btw) a 2 minutes timer starts and when it ends, all the survivors in the map die..
---
-DS:Now DS instead of activate when you are picked up, it activates if: You are rescued from a hook and the killer picks you in 40/50/60 seconds.
---
They add The Plague and The Legion (And they reworked The Leguion) with their survivors and they add Ashe (From Evil Dead)
---
They changed a lot of things more but i think those are the most relevant.
---
Link the other person's posts or better yet, dont repost.
---
I agree :)
---
Yea lol I saw em
---
Well its a free weekend...
---
And then you said it was toxic
---
R6S doesn't have a free weekend so thats why we are ahead.
---
aye you get a thumbs up and finger guns from me
---
This pleases the n u t
---
The first post in months where I see someone stating that NOED is balanced and salty survivor mains don't downvote it to hell.  
---
NOED can easily be countered and mostly doesn't come into play at all.  
---
Usually people complain about it after hookdiving in the endgame to save their premade buddy, instead of leaving when they obviously should have.
---
Tell that to the face-camping Spirit I faced
---
For one second i thought it was Mathieu inside the locker, and that he was going to leave it while yelling PRETTY GOOD JOB!
---
Sooo because this is a "relatively rare situation" it's dismissable. Alright.
---
You are bad guy, but this does not make you bad *guy*
---
It's a bug. Sometimes when you go to grab, you get stuck in the animation instead.
---
SCP-096 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT
---
For your sake I pray you never are.
---
John Doe wasn't a pedophile, in fact he tortured one rather mercilessly.
---
hells to the yeah it's way to good
---
Angrily WaAaAaAh!
---
I was talking about Kevin Spacey
---
b-b-b-ut i offered that YOU could blind ME , :(
---
This is true... but there‚Äôs no way the survivor coulda known the killer was gonna be billy. Imagine if the killer was any of the many M1 killers in this game
---
if you don't find a way to fix it, you can always download a program like VoiceMeeter that can switch them back again when you're playing
---
Even though it is just because of the free weekend, still impressive. That amount of people willing to download and give DBD a try. 
---
Countless times R6 or other popular games were featured during Free Weekend and I still didn't feel like downloading it.
---
no shit sherlock
---
Fun nurse build: BBQ, Iron Maiden, Dev Hope, Transport perk (iron grasp, agitation, mad grit) 
---
Iron Maiden doesn‚Äôt always help but when it does it really does. 
---
Also just complete guilty pleasure build is hex roulette. Idk why but it‚Äôs fun to just fight over totems. I don‚Äôt mind losing with that build either it‚Äôs just funny.
---
Clown or Spirit. 
---
Plague success relies whether or not survivors will cleanse. If they play smart and never cleanse, she is just a regular M1 killer.
---
I made a [survey for people's least favorite perks](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bswby8/survey_the_worst_teachable_perks_in_dead_by/) and currently Dying Light is one of the most voted perks that people dislike. Almost every single suggestion to rework the perk has come down to "this perk encourages tunneling way too hard and is extremely unfun for both sides to play with."
---
Lol mirror of this post https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/btgik5/adrenaline_is_op/
---
This sounds really cool, but incredibly annoying for survivors. Maybe if there was a good way to free yourself of sin it would be okay, but the main issue is randomness. Sloth is far and away the best one imo since it helps in the chase, while sims like gluttony do about the same thing as nurses + sloppy.
---
As for perks, I really like a lot of these, especially give into the hate. Macabre Purpose, just like the killer, sounds really cool but really annoying. This could result in really crazy games with people randomly getting exposed from MYC.
---
My final criticism is what weapon would John use? If I‚Äôm correct, he doesn‚Äôt have a signature weapon that he uses, and basically all the movie‚Äôs weapons are guns.
---
Aside from some gameplay aspects, I think this would be a great idea for a killer! I‚Äôm a huge fan of the movie and it would be cool to have a sort of philosophical killer in game. The only other problem I can think of would be the fact that he is portrayed by Kevin Spacey, so BHVR might not want to associate with him.
---
Notice the slight angle cutting off the perks of...smurfs?
---
He didn't deserve anything. winning or losing is decided by the better player.
---
Oh shit really? the first time I'm hearing about this.
---
This is my perspective of this event
---
it's an awful perk imo, at best you play with 3 perks at worst you lost
---
What about Bubba's sad screech
---
&gt; Decisive only affects bad killers that tunnel off hook.
---
They can just unhook in your face right after you hook and then you get punished by making the logical play of just hitting the injured guy down. 
---
Anyway now i just slug since its much easier then trying to guess when 60 seconds has passed to pick them up.
---
There have been massive changes to the game since the spirit release but here are the largest changes I can think of;
---
- New killers I.E Legion, Plague. 6 New perks: 
---
- Dark Devotion, Infectious Freight, Corrupt Intervention (Plague teachables)
---
- Iron Maiden, Discordance, Mad Grit (Legion Teachables)
---
- New survivors I.E Jeff, Jane, Ash
---
- Jeff Perks: Distortion, Breakdown, AfterCare
---
- Jame Perks: Head on, Solidarity, Poised
---
- Ash Perks: Mettle Of Man (Very strong and soon to be nerfed), Buckle Up, Flip Flop
---
- Rework for Freddy going to be released soon
---
- End Game collapse places a 2-minute timer at the end of the game when survivors open exit gates. If they do not leave they are auto sacrificed with a cool animation
---
- Perk buffs and nerfs. Remember me got nerfed while Surveillance, Spies from the Shadows.
---
- Perk changes for Ruin, BBQ &amp; some others. Makes the lower tier equivalents more similar to tier 3 which improves them. An example would be that Tier 1 Ruin impacts all 4 survivors but the good skill check regression is only 3% instead of 5%.
---
- DS changed so that it only activates for 60 seconds after being unhooked. An anti-tunneling perk.
---
- Bug fixes and changes to minimum pallet count. Pallet count more consistent. 
---
- Sounds are kind of bugged currently which is irritating for the killer. 
---
- A lot of stuff I have probably missed but that's the most notable changes.
---
Damn, that's a new peak.
---
Defo Spirit
---
Bullshit. Shes been taking college dick since the eighth grade.
---
Spirit obviously, as plague is pretty meh unless the survivors are bad and they cleanse constantly after becoming sick.
---
Remember: if you run No Mither, you counter NOED.
---
The rest of your team might have some struggles, though.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much the whole point of hexes.
---
So Mending is studying. If you don‚Äôt Mend, u fukko, bucco
---
Haha, because it looks like it from first person! Try playing Doc. You'll see.
---
Eh, I can see ruin being more useful overall. If I down one or two people before it gets cleansed I consider it a win.
---
The only real problem with NOED is that there is no actual way to tell if it is in play, so half of the time you'll be completely wasting your time and hurting your team in the process.
---
Plus it kinda rewards you for playing badly.
---
That's still the all-time peak for DBD. :)
---
He got facecamped for that
---
I think Adrenaline is balanced unless more than one person are using it in a round. When multiple people use it, it should be slightly weaker, like old DS for people who weren't the obsession
---
We need a medical gown skin for Laurie now
---
I can hear this image.
---
You're not even wasting a perk: you're actively helping the Survivors by giving the Obsession faster healing speed.
---
This post sounds like the title to a weirdly specific porn.
---
Not exactly rare... Welcome to DbD
---
I know. Just funny to see a post mirrored and for them both to be basically beside themselves on the front page. :P
---
This would be really nice, especially when you're playing with friends so you can tell if it's the killer or just you
---
When you attempt to unhook in front of me with 8 stacks is the best. They just fail to unhook.
---
who the hell disconnects because they didn't get deliverance lmao
---
I would suggest Spirit for 2 reasons
---
- First off she has a much higher skill ceiling than the Plague but when you get used to the Spirits power, she becomes a monster for downing survivors due to how good she is at mind-games and the mobility she has with her power. 
---
- Second is that her perks are far superior to the plagues. All her perks are really good and work well with most builds whereas all the plagues perks are relatively poor and do not provide much for the killer. 
---
Unfortunately, the plague is a bit underwhelming as a killer and can be bullied by high ranking survivors as being broken doesn't impact their ability to loop efficiently.
---
Yeah, some kid came out and said Spacey tried to molest him at a party in the 90's.
---
Spacey's only response was to publically come out as gay.
---
What if she was staring at you while moving in phase shift?
---
Yeah. His hotness drops down to 0% without the beard :(
---
Wtf you are wanting me to use my batterys? You dipshit with unnerving presence. Noob
---
Why do people think flashlight clicking is toxic?
---
I completely understand your pain.
---
First of all you need ruin. Ruin is a must have perk for killers just to prevent survivors from doing gens in a few seconds. 
---
For flashlight saves. Always face the wall when you pick someone up. It doesn't always work, but it helps most of them time. Remember to look up or more preferably down to avoid the flashlights on your way to the hook.
---
Learn how to listen for sounds. Using headphones/earphones helps a lot. This can help track survivors.
---
Learn to mindgame pallets/loops and most importantly, learn when to stop chasing the survivor. Sometimes the survivor loops too well and you're better off patrolling gens instead of wasting time chasing one survivor. Being a killer is all about time management. As for mindgames, I learned most of the tricks from watching youtubers.
---
And lastly, there's a reason killers in high rank only play high ranked killers like nurse and billy. Doc and wraith are sadly low tier killers because of how easy it is to counter them. This doesn't mean you should avoid playing them. A good killer can win using any killer. If you like wraith and doc then master them. Learn how to counter the counters and weaknesses of the killer.
---
Sorry for the long comment &gt;.&lt;
---
yeah i was against a SWF team that was really toxic and cause they couldnt find the last totem on the map once NOED activated i got a 4 man kill in about a minute since you cant flashlight save or sabotage hooks when you are insta down on the ground and left there
---
As long as ruin wastes time it's done it's job. The only time it's bad is when it gets cleansed right away
---
Nice catch
---
3 Mettle of Man.
---
I bet you had fun playing against that as Wraith (just use your M2 LOL)
---
For the first "issue", the mere existence of NOED is what makes it so good. Even if you don't know the killer has it, the threat that they *might* have it is enough for most people to start doing dull totems, slowing down the game which is good for the killer. Of course, you can skip that, but if the killer does have NOED that's the price you pay. It's a gamble: a safer endgame in exchange for taking the time to cleanse them, or a risky endgame in exchange for getting there faster.
---
Also, the second issue goes with about any hex perk or the like. You see Ruin in a rare part of the map but you're the only one that knows, so the killer chases you the entire time to make sure you don't cleanse it. If your teammates don't find it, that's tough luck, but that's how the game works. And while the notification that NOED is off or on could be better or worse, it's not really gonna change how you play around chases in endgame is it? Since you don't want to get hit in endgame regardless.
---
And I never got the last argument. "Rewards you for playing badly" is acting like the killer does nothing for 5 gens then suddenly gets a 4k. That's not how it works, it's a last resort that can be easily disabled, and even then you're looking at 1-2 kills at most if the survivors just know to leave instead of playing risky saves at endgame.
---
Completely disagree (killer main, former survivor main), if the killer had hooked a survivor instead of hitting the other 2 then the final gen would have popped and the killer would have more than likely waited by the hook for his guaranteed kill while the others escaped, that's boring.
---
If none of the survivors had adrenaline (as the killer assumed) then the remaining survivor has a choice as to try and save one that's on the hook or one of the downed ones, get the gate open first or after. The killer has to choose to hook when he has the chance and the survivors are together or risk letting them recover most of the way to be saved by the remaining survivor. Or the scenario we've just watched can happen which is so interesting there's been two vids of it uploaded to the subreddit in a day. 
---
Just because the killer doesn't behave exactly the way you want doesn't mean it's toxic
---
Can someone help me I can't see the video for some reason
---
Its really been difficult for some reason. Killers tend to gravitate towards me more even though i dont have any perks that would make my aura visable... my coustomizations might be the problem though
---
Facecamping counters No Mither though :/ Borrowed Time or not, if you are injured, helping your team with a save is suicide
---
Pretty good so far, if you added detail to the bodies it would look awesome!
---
I play both... I see this as an absolute win!
---
Working on it
---
Finally a tier list I can get behind üòÇ
---
(Dwight is the cutest)
---
Damn pig bitch gets me every time...
---
Well, at the end of the day, it's taunting the same way killers nod when down a survivor, It is toxic only If you feel so
---
Uhh.. is it like that all over?
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat here haha I‚Äôll scrape by to 10 then immediately get dropped halfway back to 12 the next few games I play
---
I barely even hear Freddy when I stun him usually. Idk why he's so quiet compared to all the others.
---
You put my boi Quentin up there in S this moment
---
Move Ash up to A, and you've got yourself a deal
---
Unfortunately the killers you‚Äôre playing are really weak. My best advice is to use Enduring + spirit fury on both of them, then use discordance for gen progression awareness, and whatever you like best between ruin and noed. Other than that try to not care about teabags and end game chat. I know it‚Äôs hard because I get tilted as well, but try to remember that you‚Äôre playing the harder role, while the survivors have it easy. Good luck man
---
Hey ur the guy from twitch!
---
Jane is not cute, she is thicc. She looks like my middle school math teacher
---
Ash has voice lines so when he loads in he says a random line. That's all.
---
I get the pain man, i had rank 4s in swf groups talking shit while i was practicing nurse at rank 15
---
Yeah.  I‚Äôve accidentally fallen into it many times.  Not sure why it‚Äôs a thing tho.
---
Brand new parts?? You do realize they have been nerfed right?
---
[deleted]
---
Cursed perks that give a powerful benefit at the cost of a severe penalty.
---
Hex totoms being reworked so instead of just cleansing them you have to take the skull and take it to an alter to destroy it which takes time and warns the killer if the survivors drop it it resets location after 5 seconds. No more ruin being destroyed within the first 15 seconds of the match and Franklins demise being more useful.
---
Sup.  Fellow bing bong boi here.
---
Noed is unbalanced in my opinion because it isn't earned.  Cleansing all five totem in a Solo game isn't realistic, in the killer can do literally nothing all game and still get it. It would be balanced if the amount of hits was limited in some way based on the killers performance, or a time limit, I don't know.
---
Borrowed time and DS are easy to counter but I'll leave it to you to figure out what the counter is ;). 
---
You've said it yourself, you never played at higher ranks. How are you suppose to play well against better survivors as if this is rank 14? 
---
You obviously dont loop right if all survivors are giving you a hard time. Learn how to counter various looping tiles, there are a few good videos on YouTube about it. 
---
Doctor is a low B or C tier killer as well. It could play a major factor in the games outcome against decent survivors.
---
Rarely is there a game where no one uses decisive or mettle of man.  At which point, one of them will be chosen to be the obsession, so dying light will become a rare counter to those. And dying light is FAR less common than those two, so if its OP, is like to know why no one uses it unless they have no other perks at the time.
---
The wraiths elephant noises are very pleasing and you forget the legion also as a female model that makes the cute grunts as well
---
I wish the toxic ones would leave this game already.
---
Tbh rank doesnt really dictate skill, just how often you play. I have a friend who is god awful at the game (cant hit skillchecks and runs in a straight line until the killer hits then twice) and she's rank 8 simply because she plays a lot
---
i want to eat some donuts... cool drawing!
---
I literally said the exact same thing as you, slugging isn't a fun way to play for anyone involved buuuuuut that doesn't mean it isn't viable in certain situations, it's just like camping 90% of the time it is useless and toxic but sometimes it's the only way to secure a kill or two, necessary evil if you will.
---
I am prepping up for the hate, but I stand my ground. Dying Light was not as good as it was hyped to be.
---
It's the internet, I'll live, and when I woke up and saw, I had a good laugh at myself. So I'm happy.
---
Definitely not lol it helps to get half of them used up before endgame though. I'm not saying it's great, I'm just using what cards I was dealt. At least when they update it and they gotta take hits, you'll know the heroic ones are gonna have it and it'll be way harder to get.
---
Nobody knows.
---
this is so sad... alexa, play vacuum cleaning asmr

---
From what I can tell, if the game is having trouble finding people around your rank and nearby, it just puts you with people in your region
---
TBH I started a new account for a breath of fresh air and knowing I can skip most of the killers until the end is nice
---
So creepy.
---
He should get points in deviousness for downing people in tier 3.
---
Tbh I don't run them enough to notice, so what's the nerf? I'd still imagine they're effective as gens get popped very quickly when I play against them or with a team mate.
---
Pog
---
Can honestly say I've never seen an account with negative karma until today.
---
chaotic energy
---
It's not a bug, it's something they introduced along with the new DS. They kind of reworked the dynamic. The obsession is randomly chosen regardless or the perks they have so that the killer doesn't know who might have DS and someone becomes the obsession the moment they use it.
---
Same I think it's fine as it is and also gives me more reason to cleanse totems.
---
It's like Myers but with better stealth, more mindgame potential, and quicker instadowns.
---
That just proves that people will literally complain about anything.
---
I mean they did him dirty. (I know the looks license and all) but he's a cutie in the movie and in game he looks like someone hit him in the face with a frying pan.
---
this seems like it would be a decent compromise but it is not the case. When I am at, say, rank 10, I will frequently get matched up against teams with ranks, 11,10,8,2, or something to that extent. If the mm split the difference, you would expect me to get a rank 19 or 18 for every rank 2 in my games but it just doesn't happen.
---
that's the tier list on noises that scare the hell out of you
---
I love Mr. Bing Bong! I put on my Wax Warlock cosmetic when I want to be fancy.
---
And NoED is the risk you take when not cleansing the totems.
---
.
---
Very likely a paragraph. Considering the Dev build leaked nothing about the new survivor and that survivors received the ash paragraph, I wouldn't be surprised if it was only a paragraph. 
---
The rework on Freddy and massive anniversary event have likely taken a lot of their resources to create a new chapter.
---
Very true.
---
That was a smooth spin.
---
I love cleansing all totems and taking a hit near gate knowing i am safe.
---
Yea in mine everyone had dead hard and one or two had MoM. 3 had adrenaline, 2 instaheals. high rank metas i guess.
---
Poggers
---
Unironically I am having a hard time as to how Nea made it so far up the list. 
---
Nea D tier pls.
---
There was a tweet from someone (I dont remember his name - I'll see if I can find it again) who was supposedly gonna orginially announce the chapter but then it was leaked. He did tweet a semi announcement tweet which he said we'd get a map and survivor, making it a chapter. 
---
But reddit is ignoring his tweet or just feels he is untrustworthy
---
Super Mario maker 2 looks great
---
How could you say such a thing
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of bug: Item orientation
---
Reproduction rate: Random, occurs on spawn and from then, cannot be fixed by dropping and picking up item
---
Description of bug: I spawned in with a flashlight and it was being held the wrong direction. Not only that, but when I held our two to use it might character would aim the flashlight directly at the ground because of how it was being held
---
Wraith would be at the very top then.
---
Legion has counterplay now. What else do you want?
---
Wait I am like newish but isn't it the traditional way of playing to go blind and observe the killer to figure out his perks and you having that fear of uncertainty of noed.
---
Not everything should be given out to you.
---
High class Bing Bongs
---
The devs have said they were looking into adding something showing when someone‚Äôs in a chase and making kindred a base part of the game, not a perk.
---
They definitely do need to do more to enable teamwork as a solo survivor, though.
---
no, you won't, it's no one concern what perks do you use
---
Bing Bing?
---
they are tied I think, unless wraith have that item that makes the bell to be heared in all the map, then he wins
---
The only good thing i got out of this was the bloody party streamers. I wish i played doc because it was on The Game so i woulda got so many bloodpoints
---
Why it isn't realistic? I bring tier 3 small game and do it every game
---
And in turn my team does the Gens
---
Come on what about The Plagues ‚Äú *AIAYAYA* ‚Äù
---
The point is that it's even worse than wasting a perk.
---
A paragraph is only a DLC consisting of a survivor, Ash or Bill. According to the official DBD website if you go to chapters you will see that the Leatherface DLC is a chapter, meaning that killer only DLCs are also chapters. So Ghostface will most likely be a chapter.
---
It's still taunting tho. Taunts are meant to piss people off, that's literally the definition of a taunt. It's infuriating to see some asshole survivor t-bag after landing a pallet stun as if they somehow completely outplayed you. Just play the game and don't try to rub in a completely meaningless achievement.
---
*Babylonian cursing intensifies*
---
It depends really on what you want from them.
---
Leatheface has the best perks that all have some good use, especially BBQ. BBQ allows you to gain more bp and get into a chase really fast after an unhook. It is an amazing perk that reduces the grind signficantly in the game. 
---
The Shape is the best killer when it comes to having fun. Having a tiny terror radius and tier 3 allowing you to insta down survivors means he is one of the strongest chasing killer in the game. Very fun to play and can be fun for spooking out survivors. He also has custom chase music which is really nice. 
---
Freddy is getting reworked soon so its up in the air as to what is going to be happening to him. He might become really strong or remain relatively weak. If you are looking for a killer that will help you get alot of killers then Freddy is not the best choice. He can be fun for stalloing the game or if you would like to watch survivors and track their movement from a distance but he is reallyt hard to play and is relatively weak compared to all the other killers.
---
In conclusion:
---
If you want perks then Leatherface. Heavily recommend BBQ &amp; Chilli for allowing you to level up all your other killers/Survivors.
---
If you want to have fun with a killer then the Shape. By far one of the funnest killers in the game.
---
CJ? OOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH
---
I was going to buy clown, seems like an easy going killer. I just don't understand doctor lmao
---
Are you a high rank?
---
Survivors being able to run? That‚Äôs a crutch perk remove it BHVR
---
That smile tho.
---
Once I get past green ranks I usually only stick to Myers, Spirit, Doctor and Plague (I hate playing as Billy)
---
Yup, so if you stepped away for a second and came back downed you were probably getting mori‚Äôd
---
How do you put Goat face Nea about Claudette and Meg? xD
---
You might want to directly contact the developers on the official website or forums instead. I'm not sure if they see everything that's posted on reddit.
---
He's very cute when he has his little scruffy mountain man beard. If you look at clean shaven Jake, his face looks like one cheek of hillbilly's hiney.
---
She don't need no butt to be cute! She makes adorable sounds and wears pilgrim shoes and I literally thought from her behind shot during the halloween trailer sneak peak she was a little old man. All we need is grandma Laurie cosmetic and she will be top tier cute.
---
But, what about him is bad?
---
The emblem system is great, well, better than the victory cube at least. Just git gud.
---
All good! It's got to be tough to try and learn a new killer at higher ranks.
---
I was joking. I don‚Äôt understand why people still hate him after the rework. Sorry forgot the /s
---
I would love to be good at Billy but he's to fucking hard. I think I'm gonna pick up Myers.
---
my reasoning here is that if you use a perk for its desired result then you have foreseen that sitiuation in which you will need it and as such you have the better judgement of the two. (you and enemy)
---
Myers is definitely worth a try. Not as good as Huntress when it comes to map wide pressure but definitely effective for mind-games, counter-rotations and chasing survivors through pallets. Monitor &amp; Abuse is amazing for him as it practically removes his terror radius. 
---
One of the best feelings in the game is to snowball with tier 3 and down multiple survivors with it in rapid succession. The amount of pressure it applies to survivors is amazing.

I know that feeling
---
More like their attempts to farm you for BP backfired.
---
*Come at me Claudette mains.*
---
I don‚Äôt mind not knowing, that‚Äôs half the excitement of NOED for me. And you can tell who has NOED by the way they play. If they suddenly get hyper aggressive and stop breaking pallets they definitely have it. Survivors get too much info sometimes on perks, I like the fact you have to make the guess yourself.
---
You don't get my point, not your fault, I have trouble explaining myself, but what I'm trying to say is that taunt isn't nas until you really Hurts yourself, League of legends have in character taunt and nobody complains about It, people in dbd is Just too sensitive, ir Just like to Braga about everything and make user rules
---
Why does a perk have to be earned???
---
Loading into a game with Myers as we speak. I've played him a couple times so ik what I'm doing.
---
It's usually vice versa for me since I'm a killer main
---
Seems unfair to anyone who's internet goes out, power goes out, game crashes, random console/pc error, etc.
---
The truth has been revealed
---
MoM + Borrowed Time counter it pretty well
---
I'm gonna end this conversation right now with a friendly agree to disagree and because each time you post your post gets more typo filled.
---
Thanks for the info. You're making a lot of assumptions and I wasn't complaining, I was simply making a comparison. 
---
My point still stands. In a game where time is everything, doing 15% in 5 seconds is still cutting the game short. If all 4 survivors are working a different gen with a brand new part and I'm chasing 1 of those people who I down in the first minute, 3/5 gens just got popped in quick succession.
---
all looks the same to me.... cause rank means fuck all. show me their credit score and then we can talk.
---
Interesting, but I'm not so sure its a practical solution. I've had times where I had to DC because I had to leave for stuff irl. I agree punishment should be part of dc'ing but maybe more direct than wasting their time.
---
*chooses to buy a game that's 100% reliant on other people's internet connections*
---
*gets mad when people don't have an internet connection that's up to his standards*
---
*wants refund*
---
It's a funny concept, and I can think of ways to make it worse on the survivors, but it doesn't stop survivors from just suiciding on first hook to avoid going to hell. Suiciding would only take 20 - 30 seconds longer than the current DC method.
---
idk, I just wanted to meme but the pig police got to my karma stash T\_T
---
You‚Äôre not letting them live... you‚Äôre just saving the best for last
---
No Mither Tier 4
---
I‚Äôve played him quite a lot in the past and although I can zip around the map easy enough I hardly get a chainsaw hit. Aside from that when I play high rank survivor I constantly go against Billys to the point i‚Äôm sick of seeing him so don‚Äôt want to touch him anyway. 
---
Myers is one of my favourites because of all the different play styles you can choose from with his add-ons.
---
Y‚Äôall really ignoring Legion‚Äôs temper tantrum stun? Especially Susie/Julie‚Äôs? Shameful
---
üò≠ alexa this is the saddest thing ever. Play despasito
---
Hope you enjoy him man. 
---
As a side note, I have no idea how you could play Huntress on console. I find the joysticks to be a real pain with camera movement as a killer and find throwing the hatchets to be incredibly difficult, especially through tighter windows or openings.
---
What sensitivity do you play with Huntress?
---
She really is like the Nurse. I got completely stomped...
---
Depends how game changing they are IMO. Noed being one of them.
---
YES I LOVE HIS GIGGLES THEY MAKE ME FEEL MATERNAL INSTINCTS
---
I feel a lot of maternal instincts towards creepy disgusting men who have killed people before, that's maybe concerning
---
also Wraith and Salad Fingers
---
It kinda just comes down to if your using prayer beads or not, if you are spirit is way better than billy
---
boooo
---
Just got the 4k with Myers. I use 55 on Huntress. Other than that my sens for other killers is like 70ish
---
I have a second monitor as well. Especially with higher refresh rate, full screen is pretty necessary. A second monitor or 10 changes nothing. Just takes a little longer to alt tab (and sometimes no longer!).
---
Hey, I may be stabbing people, impaling them on hooks, tearing their throats out, and offering them as food to an ancient deity, but at least I‚Äôm not being a dick about it. This is just business.
---
If I die but my BT gets you out alive, then I don't care about being camped.
---
Some of the best and most used killer perks don‚Äôt have to be earned at all lol
---
I'm a killer and survivor player (rank 7 killer rank 7 survivor) and I go up against so many Myers and pigs it's crazy.
---
Spirit/Pig Main here. 
---
I daydream often about being a skilled console Huntress but I‚Äôm too afraid to touch her lol.
---
True, but unless you have at least one other survivor to commit, or you have an open exit gate nearby, it usually ends up pretty poorly. At best, the survivor is off the hook and people have to heal. At worst, you just lost. ESPECIALLY against a Leatherface. Then again, the best counter to facecamping? Do the gens. In the time that hook takes, assuming the survivor doesn't kill themselves, 2 gens can be done and 3 can be almost finished... or some resourceful survivors can double up with toolboxes, shaving that down to maybe 3 or FOUR gens during the 2 minute timer, assuming every survivor is doing gens and doesn't fuck up an Overcharge or something.
---
Nurse is pain in ass. She isn't good on consoles. Very hard to chase survs. Huntress is good on low ranks, my record is 8 rank on her. Pig is my main, but charge is hard to aim. And Hag is overpowered on consoles, just imho. Sorry for language.
---
It's smurfhag, what did you expect?   
---
Also she is newly p1'd so I used my best, captain.
---
Do continue
---
I‚Äôm sorry, who the **FUCK** still plays DOTA?
---
I can generally agree with you, I used NOED and Blood Warden and making use of something planned is a lot different than having a crutch.
---
At the same time, needing to use Adrenaline because you ran right at the killer for no logical or strategic reason is far different than needing to use Adrenaline because you didn't bring self-care or in case you face someone who slugs to prevent hatch or because you're planning to delay the killer through loops and know you're be taking hits.
---
"I could use a health state heal in an emergency because I tried my best not to get hit and I'm willing to sacrifice a perk slot for it" is incredibly different from "I ran directly at a Hillbilly revving his chainsaw and went down for no strategic reason while achieving nothing valuable in exchange for my injury".
---
It all depends on how you use it, there was a video awhile back of a Leatherface pretending to be afk in EGC who didn't chase (no BBQ stacks) and then he downed a Claudette who was just trying to safety pip by looting a chest and got four kills from Blood Warden; that's crutch, yes? But if the LF had downed someone and stood over them to see if the others left before it was too late, it wouldn't be crutch.
---
Windows of Opportunity and Bamboozle are designed to cover weaknesses in awareness of map layout or against window loops, a perk covering a weakness isn't necessarily crutch either.
---
I'm saying **this situation in the video is relying on a perk as a crutch**, not that it's bad to use Adrenaline, just that these survivors were bad and all got off for free anyway.
---
She is amazing. But her mind games become inadequate when you reach higher ranks unfortunately (on console).
---
Haha haha.
---
If the killer could laugh or taunt, he would.  Trust.
---
Noed can turn a 3/4 man escape into a 4k. What other perk can do that in that short amount of time?
---
Nothing.
---
Not our fault you got shitty wifi
---
Yeah hag is good but when go go up against swf I just don't seem to enjoy her. They will coordinate the trap setoffs and it becomes boring to me
---
True that. I'll rework it and see what happens. It makes sense tho now that I think bout it. I shouldnt use nurses cause I'm usually always in treatment mode and they scream right away when i walk past them. I'll rework it and get back to you. Thanks!
---
Its still the nurse lol
---
Hmm, thanks for the Reply. I might try Huntress on console as she looks really satisfying to play. I have pretty much played all the other chasing based killers and have never spent much time playing killers that have a movement speed below 115%.
---
Good to see a Myers success story.
---
Damn dude, everything okay at home? Mom yelling at you again?
---
Why even come into a thread to be so negative lmao
---
‚ÄúNot because of what you think‚Äù 
---
What did you think we thought? Dear God
---
I'm not really saying anything different, somtimes it's the right thing to do and somtimes it's just fun but it's still overall not a fun way to play definitely for the survivors but especially for the killers in my mind.
---
I'll knock someone and leave them if someone farms them infront of me or if I accidentally tunnel them as well but I don't really consider that slugging, to me, slugging is when you knock everyone down and don't hook anyone until they are all downed or  bleed out.
---
Again though just because somthing is "toxic" doesn't mean you can't do it all it means is that people will complain you don't have to listen to their complaints. Like using Myers with haunted grounds, noed, make your choice and devour hope; there is nothing inherently wrong with it but it is kind of toxic to use that many exposed effects on myers, doesn't mean it isn't funny though.
---
Yea mods havent noticed you spammed a lot
---
Decisive gives you one extra escape and can easily be wasted. Noed gives you free instant downs and is an extreme crutch that punishes survivors for not wasting 10 minutes looking for totems instead of escaping like they are supposed to do.
---
Any tips for landing hatchets other than to just git gud? Camera settings or anything? I really struggle with getting my camera/angle situated just right. ):
---
Yes. I lose killers quite frequently with it especially when they think I'm still looping the pallet/window.
---
Keep at it! Once you get used to using the Haunting, you'll be picking survivors off gens in no time.
---
As all things should be!
---
Just don't camp. Problem solved
---
I recognize that I‚Äôm painfully average as a survivor. But just because I suck doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt recognize that survivors have it a lot easier than killers.
---
As everyone else says, definitely the Spirit. I absolutely love her playing her. She‚Äôs fun, has great perks, and lots of spoopy potential. Plenty of practice with her and learning to mindgame easily makes her one of the top-tier killers in my opinion.
---
Good luck man, she takes a bit to get used to. Most survivors at ranks 8 or above don't dodge hatchets after they drop a pallet. Most will sway while running to try and dodge. You don't see a lot of window fakes typically. Other than that that's pretty much all I can say, good luck.
---
Worthless is a bit dramatic
---
Go for the person that unhooked the other player with the killer right there? Punish the right person?
---
Literally anything other than tunnel?
---
I take it you don't like black people.
---
Oh shit
---
Pyramid head
---
or people like me returning to the game because dlc were on sale
---
Blood Warden, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Haunted Ground and the only one you have to do anything is Blood Warden. There‚Äôs a ton of other perks that have no activation either that are, again, the best killer perks in the game.
---
Highest I've been is a Rank 12 surv. Currently stuck at 15. People who can play well confound me with their witching ways.
---
Oh Man, never saw that coming. Watch out guys, this guy is good.
---
I suggest using unnerving presence(I hope I got the right name) and distressing instead of Nurses and Ruin. The massive terror radius will make hiding impossible, especially with certain add-ons,  and unnerving presence makes skill checks just a lil bit more challenging and can't be cleansed.
---
Literally every game with a baby Dweet goes like [this](https://youtu.be/tK4BLow_2dc) in my head.
---
No Dwight gets left behind on my watch. ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
&gt; (Yes, 3gen doc is impossible to win against, but in higher ranks, survivors will be careful with the order that gens are done, therefore blocking 3gen situations.)
---
Not when you 3-gen from the very start of the match.
---
Yeah, use a lower sensitivity (around 55ish). Continue to loop the survivor until you feel they will drop the palet and pull out a hatchet (most survivors won't crouch because it is in the heat of the moment.) Predict the window vaults also. I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH DO NOT DO A LITTLE JOLT BEFORE YOU RELEASE. It will mess up your whole throw. Lastly, try and keep your camera in the middle. ps if you get into Huntress don't not use iridescent head :)
---
check out OhTofu's Billy guide on yt if you want to learn him.
---
Is it really camping if I know someone is trying to bait me though? That's what I dont get about some survivors. The smartest and easiest way to solve things is if you just hide and let me leave instead of just standing there teabagging and spamming the flashlight. Some survivors (especially the closer to rank 1 I get) just seem to want killers to blindly chase anyone who gets in their face instead of actually using their heads to think.
---
Probably because there is no concrete way for the game to tell if you're being facecamped, and reviewing it in a case by case basis is not an option.
---
I play killer and survivor at the same rank. A lot of people remember my name and leave me on hooks because I killed them. :(
---
If only there were survivor perks that allowed them to take another hit, or unhook safely or get up from downed. If only.
---
Huntress Mama gets B tier. The PLAG just sounds like a Muslim woman yelling.
---
Ghostface was supposed to be announced on may 28th (tomorrow) so the ptb could well be soon, but probably after the 31th.
---
0 perks, 10 traps around basement.
---
Leatherface for the perks, Michael for the gameplay, and wait like a week or two before you decide on Freddy as he's supposed to be reworked soon.

Lets not celebrate that many people take interest in the game and welcome new players to the community, nooooo. Lets be uptight about it and not celebrate that even though it's a free weekend, DBD has a higher player count currently than Rainbow 6 Siege.
---
Didn't devs say that they will rework it?
---
Not every Killer is going to adhere to your imaginary rules. 
---
Claudette is dumb for unhooking right in front of the Killer, yes, but that‚Äôs her fault for giving the Killer an easy choice to make with **2** notifications that say ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm over here by the person you just hooked!‚Äù
---
Had I been the Trapper in that situation, yeah I probably would have gone after the Claudette, but that‚Äôs only because I like to play to **have fun**, it‚Äôs still your Teams fault that happened. You can‚Äôt blame the Killer for, well, *killing*.
---
The Pig's noises sound like she *totally doesn't enjoy getting smacked *.
---
Okay, so you‚Äôre upset with the hitting control part? Toxic. Got it.
---
I agree that neither is toxic while I still believe moris are op. There is a differnce. I also still find your comparison extremely silly. They both save time of course, but the time bnp saves is negligible. In order to accomplish making even a small dent in the game time, all the survivrs would have to  equip this add-on that costs like 7000bp I believe? I am all for perks and add-ons that are strong and cut down time, but they shouldn't be broken. I guess we can agree to disagree.
---
Clown has been pretty fun and nobody knows how to properly play against Nurse once you figure her out.
---
Rank 6-12 is where I like to stay tbh.
---
I mean canonically isn't  Amanda technically trying to help the survivors become a perfect version of themselves? Never watched the movies just goin off what I know
---
Laurie‚Äôs coughing noises while injured is just hilarious
---
Edgy
---
Pig is the definition of an upvote. So take it.
---
Uff they will explode
---
Megs tho...
---
I personally love bag of gears, crate of gears, last will, and the annotated plan. I don‚Äôt want to get head pops, I just wanna waste their time.
---
In all my time, I don't think I ever have, but that's really only because I focus on getting my teammates out before myself. Plenty of times I have made myself the sacrifice so other can live. As for Gideon specifically, I usually get paired up with people running around to find Gens and running into dead ends when being chased, so that's also partially why.
---
What goes through survivors head seriously. If the killer hook someone and you clearly show that you are nearby by leaving scratch marks close by of course the Killer isn't going to leave and instead look for you. Is the Killer suppose to see all the signs you leave for him that you are indeed nearby ready to unhook the second he walks away and just casually leave and let it happen? No. It's not camping.
---
Nothing, unless you try to do it when survivors are as far from each other as possible. Boring and tryhard. I can somewhat forgive it if they can actually pull it off and not waste everyone's time in a chain heal/down loop where no progress is made by survivors or killer.
---
I mean it isn‚Äôt my favorite but I‚Äôve definitely won a few matches. And plus worse comes to worst the hatch is always downstairs
---
Lmao no
---
I‚Äôve never used predator on her.
---
I main killer, and I hate that map with a fiery passion. I don't think its unfair for either survivors or killers, its just a very different map that you have to approach in a different way
---
The spirit is one my favorite mains to play with
---
It really isn't camping. Way too many times do you hook someone and while you are on the hook animation other survivors leave scratch marks super nearby so you clearly know they are there. Of course you don't leave and instead look for them. But to them thats camping.
---
What was the result of this match?
---
Freddy is a beast to play with. But also hell to play against
---
While I love the artwork, I love seeing fan made music.
---
I‚Äôd say from person experience either Freddy, Spirit and/or Myers
---
What a sped
---
I can never come up with JoJo perk ideas for characters. I can only imagine people like Rohan, Jotaro, Dio and Kars as killers with a power but not really perks.
---
True, survivors have some similar perks. But decisive got nerfed, MOM is getting nerfed and unbreakable is so situational I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good comparison. 
---
I‚Äôm not one of the players who HATES NOED. I play both killer and survivor and I never run it on killer because I really do think it‚Äôs a crutch perk that will be a waste. I think a simple solution is to just add a totem counter, similar to a gen counter so that survivors can track the optional objective.
---
I can guarantee you that most people will still not cleanse all the totems if it‚Äôs optional, but it would at least provide some help for those who want to in solo queue.
---
Close second. I often find that they're a bit dumber than Nea, making it waaaaaay too obvious that they're trying to distract you and waste your time. Rainbow jacket and teabagging, but only appearing when one generator is left? I'm not Charlie Brown playing football, dumbass.
---
Sadly too often they don‚Äôt as most people just hard disconnect. It‚Äôs why they‚Äôre waiting to introduce real consequences with the launch of dedicated servers as they‚Äôll know then.
---
It never worked.
---
Myers is best.
---
Agh
---
Quick correction on the math: 50% altruism will speed up heals and hook saves and that p much it. Additionally, we‚Äôll make it turns a 16 second heal into an 8 second heal, and that is 100%, meaning that dying light makes it a 12 second heal.
---
Weird, didn't expect as many Freddy players
---

---
What year is this
---
Not from a survivor.
---
But that's only player lingo. In game she is called "The Pig". It is sort of her whole moniker. So it just wouldn't make sense for her to not have it on is all.
---
Myers imo is a little overrated, he has instadowns but no chase power. The hag on the other hand can close a chase fast.
---
Someone from Behaviour responded on the forums saying that chapters could be just a killer. I think it's kind of a cop-out, but by that logic we would get a chapter.
---
*Take it back now, y'all.*
---
Because getting something easily without effort is unbalanced? That's why people hate mettle of man.
---
If you complained about MoM then that would make more sense tbh
---
Yeah, yeah, very nice
---
That's shit, I'm sorry dude. Moris are so rare, I don't get why other survivors complain about them
---
Mori is definetely overpowered, but you are 100% allowed to take it, he was just salty nothing special, this game is full of people like that on both sides.
---
Pig, Myers, wraith, soon to be Freddy.
---
Yeah. More often than not I have good games on that map
---
We're gonna live forever, David's teachable. https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/David_King#David.27s_Perks
---
I dunno, I doubt BHVR are anywhere near stupid enough to sacrifice a 3 month slot to one killer. Seems more likely they were trying to cover their asses about the leak.
---
Besides, it's been almost an entire month since the leaks. It doesn't seem likely they've needed an entire extra month to create two more perks.
---
So that's why the game is a buggy mess and relies on ftp weekends as our player count dips abysmally.
---
Or Ghostface
---
I see.  Either way, you can introduce DC HELL post dedicated servers then.
---
I agree, but what many are asking for is a &gt;50% chance. In other words, they (as the last Survivor) want to escape more often than they die.
---
It's *meant* to be a very slim chance as this makes last-Survivor situations tense and last-Survivor escapes special.
---
God damn. Would there be anything creepier than if Myers could get up there and stalk. That's awesome hahaha
---
Dunno about confirmed, but the leaks show a free line and a paid line with rewards after each milestone. Like rocket league has i believe.
---
Going by recent history if there is a leak, it's probably true at this point.
---
I wear the all black David outfit because I‚Äôm not good enough to loop a killer for a long time lol
---
You are racist. Accept it.
---
The killers effected would be the ones who already have a low movement speed, such as hag, and it would be a small enough percentage to not be completely god like, but to get those killers up to par through grind. With survivors they would move at most 104, still a bit slower than nurse base speed but enough to make a bit of difference and give that survivor a reason to be played.
---
Which you often aren't, if they are running Dying light chances are they'll just camp and tunnel off hook till you're dead :c
---
It prevents the killer from picking up survivors or having to be more careful around survivors. Just because there are cases when it doesn't work doesn't mean its completely busted.
---
&gt;so half of the time you'll be completely wasting your time and hurting your team in the process.
---
But that's the risk. I understand this gripe if you're solo, but if you're in any type of SWF then you have more than enough time to knock out the totems. I admittedly only play in three or four stacks these days because I don't trust randoms, but we generally have all of the totems done by the time there's two gens left. 
---
&gt;Plus it kinda rewards you for playing badly.
---
Survivors have a handful of meta perks that also fit this description, that killers have to deal with. With some of them also fitting your aforementioned criteria of having to play around it without really knowing if it exists (Borrowed time, d-strike, Mettle and others). 
---
&gt;Also if you get chased for the majority of the match, you can't really do anything about NOED
---
The game is 4v1, not 1v1. Not every perk can have a 1v1 counter.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
one of the best perks for killers
---
What exactly is toxic about the way he was playing here? If you see multiple injured Survivors running right next to each other, why in the world would you not down them all? Why would you waste your time picking one of them up and losing out on 2 more downs?
---
is this the birth of a basement bubba
---
you mean intentionally go for the person that can tank a hit rather than the one that can be downed quickly? do you even play killer at all?
---
Me too but you have to get lucky and a hill has to spawn there
---
The ranks are averaged out
---
Same with me too
---
They're a SWF, they had more than enough time to get totems. I'm assuming they were all alive when the gates got powered?
---
RIP david
---
Hardly anyone is playing survivor now I figure. I can get a survivor match in 30 seconds but to fill a killer lobby takes me 5+ minutes.
---
"Live design" is a way of saying design on stuff that's already out. For example, balancing and reworking killers and maps that are already in the game.
---
Hey at least it's not another "my killer tier list ranked on how their farts smell".
---
Are they? Last I checked SWFs gain an advantage over the killer rank-wise, but I might be wrong; if so then my bad
---
Indeed
---
Map is rng city but every pallet on that map is safe, once they are gone there is nothing to use in a chase
---
Tbh if you think the game can‚Äôt be balanced then you should change your thinking. All games can be balanced it just depends on if the devs will balance it. Sure maps are harder too balance but killers should be around the same skill level with the exception being nurse. OP perks should get nerfed and UP perks should be buffed, as too have a reason too level everyone up too 40 instead of just the useful ones then only playing nea because she‚Äôs small. I hate when people say ‚Äúgame can‚Äôt be balanced so just accept it and move on‚Äù as it‚Äôs such a horrible mentality too have.
---
You're welcome! Feels a bit weird to get noticed in the wild like this, but I guess my videos have been gaining a bit of traction recently.
---
i have to disagree with you given the recent ranking changes. maybe before ya. but not now.
---
i know rank 1 seems cool cause it's a 'im da winner' badge, but there's legitimately 0 reward or point, your teammates just stay the same rockbiters they are while the killers get upgraded in keyboard gripping factor. the rank you're at is probably peak fun and enjoyment, ive gotten rank 1 plenty of times and ive made it a goal to never get there again really
---
Third game in I pulled a Dwight off the gen (I also just got her)
---
We're just Ace mains sir, We're ment to be expendable
---
My connection can‚Äôt be shit if everytime I match up with Europeans I get 150 ping max.
---
&gt;I said there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it at the beginning.
---
and then
---
&gt;it‚Äôs just a bit of a toxic way to play.
---
so which is it?
---
What did you think I thought you thought?
---
Just saying that there are "cases" is a bit disingenuous in my opinion. These "cases" seem to be at least 95% of all scenarios which just makes it ineffective especially when compared to the other items.
---
Ye, the only real exception is if a player just started playing then you will get rank 20‚Äòs almost guaranteed.
---
How can deliverance fight camping? The killer would just smack you back down lol
---
&gt;Noed is unbalanced in my opinion because it isn't earned
---
This is true of a vast majority of game-changing perks for survivors, though. Mettle, D-Strike, Dead Hard, Borrowed, just to name a few. They aren't earned, you literally get these perks for failing by getting hit or downed. The only really meta perk I can think of that is earned is Adrenaline - which is a reward for powering the gates.
---
Dota is insanely popular, and also free. Plus with Dota Auto Chess really taking off, it's gotten even more players than normal until the standalone DAC comes out.
---
I'd rather they don't waste money on nobody character when they can spend it on getting Langekamp's Nancy or Robert"s Freddy.
---
And it's not like the actor was that good looking to begin with. He has an odd face even for Hollywood.'s standard.
---
Ok, fair enough
---
No my wifi is wired and great, it‚Äôs 100 you guys. Or maybe it‚Äôs just the distance.
---
It‚Äôs fine if your teammates don‚Äôt play immersed, because stealth mostly sucks on that map and you need to waste as little time as possible. Balanced Landing and learning where the pallets and gens spawn make a good bit of difference, though.
---
Ok you wanna call flashlights bad, let's go through why every item besdies took boxes are bad
---
Maps- just run deja vu
---
Keys - just play as team for exit gates 
---
Medic kits- self-care + botany 
---
As you see most items are bad or can be swapped for perks.
---
Its personal preference.
---
I had a mate that was killer rank 1 and survivor rank 3 who can pull off every save with a flashlight.
---
Just because an item doesn't work everytime or doesn't seem to work for you, doesn't mean they are bad.
---
The case I'm referring to is blindness reg. If you want flashlights to be buffed fine. Don't bitch about it if you play killer and they become so overpowered that you might as well slug.
---
I wouldn't recommend removing memes. This community is pretty split on the meme opinion.
---
How I felt after returning today after not playing since 4/19 and survived 9 out of 10 matches.
---
(To be fair, I was playing with potatoes)
---
That's just flat out untrue! I checked AGAIN last night, and I pumped 1 mil bps into my p3-15 Huntress, who ended up level 45. Sure, that's only 30 levels instead of 38, but this "50k per bloodweb" number seems to be coming from nowhere!
---
Maybe you're only considering bloodwebs past p3-50? That would obviously change the behavior, as well as the cost.
---
Everyone got out üò¨

Nah I‚Äôm mad because I can easily get in an EU lobby with 120 ping, but for the past 2 weeks I can‚Äôt join a lobby that isn‚Äôt Saudi Arabian. Think before you speak.
---
It‚Äôs the killers way of punishing mettle of man
---
Clown is S Tier
---
If you have three or four people alive when NOED procs, it means you were kicking the killer's ass generally speaking. There is no goddamn reason why three or four people can't either cleanse to prevent NOED or play around it once they're aware the killer has it. Especially when 99% of killers who have NOED end up simply camping the first person they down with it. You can find the totem and make the save, or simply leave and get two or three out.
---
Just because its wired doesnt make it great
---
Lol wut
---
The license: This is conjecture. They may also have the Scream license, we just don't know it yet. DBD licensed killers have looked noticeably different from their film counterparts in the past. Pig and Tapp stand out, and Myers is nowhere near the same build in the original Halloween film as he is in game.
---
Dev Build: By this logic, we're only getting one Ghostface perk.
---
Exclusive Outfit: This, I'm stumped on.
---
I don't know, it's possible we're only getting a killer in this pack, but until Friday, nobody knows.
---
Wasn't that tried in the past? I remember once upon a time I wouldnt even check this subreddit on a certain day.
---
What rank and system though, if you dont mind?
---
Ugh just read my other comments, my Internet is just fine.
---
It doesn‚Äôt directly counter camping but combined with perks like d strike, dead hard, and adrenaline.
---
Requirements, shit bro they are preferences. You can still apply.
---
Oh you have a baby account. Have you been lurking for a long while? You may still be considered. You never know only you toss your hat in
---
Might've been able to hook him if that didn't happen
---
Battle pass dirty cash grab. I wish gamers didn‚Äôt support this, games as a service model.

Laughs in rank 15
---
Sorry pal I‚Äôve never been on reddit before this...Not like a stole someone‚Äôs meme
---
D-Strike arguably got a buff. I see the perk far more often now than I used to. It essentially makes you invincible end-game if you're remotely smart.
---
I just got called a shit killer and they said i was camping the whole game. Like, its not my fault two of you came to unhook the dude i caught in the first 30 seconds of the game. My objective is to kill all of you. Im not gonna let you run up on ur boys and save em. Go repair gens and fail skill checks. That will distract me. Its ur fault for swarming and being seen. Im not leaving when i know ur right there lol
---
I just dislike the fact that there's like max. 4 windows on that map.
---
I guess it could be argued but what I‚Äôm saying is that since it doesn‚Äôt work very well for the person doing it, it isn‚Äôt really something that needs major adjustments immediately.
---
Not to me.
---
So what?
---
It'll take most of the way to level 50, at least according to this chart:
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player\_Level#Iridescent\_Shards](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level#Iridescent_Shards)
---
I am rank 5 Xbox player.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4! I also wish more people put in time to learn her. She‚Äôs really a force to be reckoned with.
---
They work "intensely" for 8 hours, hm? Then why have I run into BHVR employees playing DbD during office hours and how in the world do you explain the developer streams? Those streams look pretty laid back to me.
---
But you did thats the funny part
---
It‚Äôs hard to be consciously aware of sometimes, but you need to learn to spot those bad loop areas and if a survivor runs you to one, maybe break a pallet and then just leave it. There are only so many safe spots on a given map and a fair few of the gens will be in unsafe areas, so you want to try and catch survivors out around those instead. Your priority early on should be survivors in dead zones and unsafe loops; save the jungle gyms for later in the match when you have more pressure.
---
Anyone can learn if they put the work in, and you'll never learn until you try so don't worry about it.
---
It allows you a chance to use perks like d strike, adrenaline, and dead hard to escape or waste time.
---
What level are you right now? 
---
Shards gain varies per level.
---
Why should the survivor be penalized In rank???
---
I think most of the posts regarding the unconfirmed leaks were removed.
---
Michael should be "creepy dude who watches girls through the windows, wasn't invited"
---
Ah okay, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
I do somewhat agree with that, but it's only really viable in certain situations now. When it does work it's better than old d-strike for sure. I never used the old one but I use it quite a bit now as survivor and I'll get to use it maybe 50% of games. It's rare that is actually saves me though, it usually just buys more time. Absolutely incredible at end game if your team mates are willing to go back for you when on the hook though.
---
rank 20‚Äôs smh 
---
/s
---
Something about the MOBA genre just makes it insanely popular. Just look at how many people still play League after all these years.
---
Oh, I would prefer if they got another function over the current ones with maybe a buff to its function at pallets as well as a rework to the add-ons. I am aware that they need to be tentative with buffing an item like this as I have seen the previous power of them.
---
That sounds terrible lmao im stuck with michaels and legions and sometimes bubba
---
Wow that sucks
---
Welcome to /r/deadbydaylight where low effort shit flows without moderation!
---
Because you as a survivor did not meet the conditions that are required in order to safety or pip.
---
&gt;Then you can still get some bp if you loop the killer all game or if you do nothing but gen 
---

don‚Äôt forget the dunce cone from gta
---
Thank you!
---
Until you get matched up with Billy on Haddonfield at 6 in the morning
---
I just hate when i feel like im doing everything i can to pip and it just doesn't happen. I even try to do gens on my own to get my lighhbringer emblem and still nothing...
---
Oh my god it took me a month to get this im so stupid
---
But it was physically impossible to do so. You are literally making no logical sense here.
---
Ah! Thank you
---
We can only hope that's why they're expanding.
---
I feel like thats a good place to stay at, i just like the idea of progressing i guess.
---
Is that internet cyber-bully Cody Ko? Disgusting
---
I love you to random citizen.
---
What an absolute idiot. You even messed up your swing and gave them another chance and they just sat there shining their flashlight like a fucking moron. Brings a smile to my face.
---
Idc for 4ks much. But I never play Wraith and was excited to get him.....almost.
---
I‚Äôm level 27
---
All my killers have out there customizations, especially my jake who has a briight blue and purple track suit lmao

#YAMERO
---
Try different killers, doctor and wraith can be tough because they are just standard M1 killers and are extremely susceptible to loops. Try killers like spirit, huntress or billy. They are much stronger and their abilities can be used to deny loops or help put out insane pressure.
---
Also your perks as killer are much more important than survivor, in my opinion. If you don't have Ruin or BBQ and you want to do better as killer, get them. Also, if you want to continue playing killers like wraith or doc and not feel completely helpless at loops use Spirit Fury and Enduring. It can really help M1 killers keep up momentum.
---
Cash do anything against a rank 1 killer like that
---
Meeee
---
Thanks for the replies, I'll answer everything in that post.
---
You are many to tell me to try stronger killers and get meta perks, the obvious problem is that I have to buy them. I'm a student so even if they only cost 5eu, it means that I have to skip on another game I want to buy or an evening with friends. It may sound silly but when you only have 100 euros at best for a year, 5 euros is a big deal. I can buy them with iridescent shards but 18k for the Hag (Ruin) and Spirit (The only killer I'm interested in) will take me dozens of hours of farming.
---
I don't have problems finding survivors, chasing is the real pain. I'll watch some youtube/streams to get better at counter looping.
---
Like many pointed out I should focus on getting as many survs off gens as possible instead of trying to get hooks, I'll work on that.
---
Countering the perks I mentionned is easier said than done but I wil ltry.
---
I also have a precise question, how do killers hit survs after they vault a window ? I'm not talking about hitting them from a mile away, the kind of thing we see because of lag. When I try to do it I will just hit the bottom of the window, even if their vault animation is barely finished, do I need to aim higher or get closer ?
---
I‚Äôm sorry to say this but
---
**your*
---
Again have just not considered that they were made back when the game benefited from them and the games devs see no way to rework them without making them broken.
---
Because while countering 2/15 is bad.
---
Countering the 2/6 (the original set when special addition was made) is better.
---
I have a question for you.
---
Do you do game design?
---
Or even code anything?
---
Because if you do you should know the struggle of trying to fix one issue just for it to a cause another.
---
Simply, it's not always as you see it.
---
Yes it's a bit under powered some times.
---
But in all honesty.
---
I wouldn't blame the game devs if it's at the bottom of their to do list right now.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll never betray the boss!‚Äù
---
Yep, and it was the best day of the week. It coincided with the old Dev Streams and for one glorious day, this subreddit wasn't a torrent of low effort garbage.
---
How many games does somebody actually pull off a flashlight save though that has equipped a flashlight?
---
I wonder if the nurse can blink up there.
---
Only did it that one time and it was purely out of circumstance, I was considering moving but the hatemail changed my mind. More often than not I simply let the survivors go. I'm not always benevolent but I'm certainly not always holding games hostage.
---
Well im in the middle east and i get 120 ping when im playing with europeans so your connection is definitely shit.
---
Bruh that hit was spooky as hell.
---
The streams are planned events where a few people show off stuff and answer questions... Why wouldn't they be laid back?
---
I do it a lot, plenty of times. Go up to a killer right as they pick em up. You flash it in their eyes and then you both continue running. It keeps the killer busy for longer so that others can do generators. A good survivor can do it. Its not that hard
---
Dance With Me for like Kate I think. 3 sec of no scratch marks after a vault.
---
That's a reason why this Vanilla Experiment is such a good idea. They'll see which maps and which killers need tweaks the most.
---
Not saying you are (I honestly don't care either way), but I don't know that "I'm probably the least racist person you'll ever meet" will convince anyone in any situation lol
---
As a Dwight main, I can confirm
---
I like DbD memes but I feel like nothing actually interesting gets noticed on this sub because of them.
---
My point is. For the last time. When your hooked right off the bat. First. You shouldn‚Äôt be de-piped because you can‚Äôt do crap.
---
... it's free right now
---
Brutal lol
---
What does this have anything to do with my point? This post is discussing how flashlights are under-powered according to me, as well as possible theory-crafting. I would have to be deluded to actually think that the developers would not only see this but be inspired to actually consider this. I posted this to discuss with other players and to see whether they agree or not.
---
How many people play this game stoned? Like I think if we are high enough, we will stop being so angry.
---
Funny enough I played a solo game yesterday where it was a clown on wretched shop. This man was not having a good time and only got 2(?) hooks during the whole game. I decided to cleanse totems because I knew he wasn‚Äôt playing great. The issue here in the match, is that while I had finished doing my 3rd totem, the gens were going by so quick that I was sure he‚Äôd get his NOED before I could get all 5. I unfortunately can‚Äôt stop randoms from pumping out gens but I think everyone should have some common sense to feel out that the killer COULD have it. If I can do 3 totems by myself, the other 3 players can get the last 2 on the map. It‚Äôs really not asking for much to be aware of nearby totems. It‚Äôs such a preventable perk that people give too much power because they can‚Äôt be bothered to lay off gens to cleanse a 20 second totem. Maybe it‚Äôll cost an extra hook on a bad killer who‚Äôs barely gotten any, that‚Äôs fine. It all ends up being more points for everyone in the end and then there‚Äôs no threat of NOED.
---
Spirit isn't that one dimensional. She's arguably as good or better than Billy without add-ons.
---
How is there no concrete way? It will be pretty obvious. You probably wont have any repair points and you will have gave the killer his negatives for camping on his emblems. So if the game recognizes that the killer was too close in proximity to the hook then it should be able to recognize that you were the survivor he was too close to. The problem could be fixed. People like to dc over camping so if we fixed it that would be less people disconnecting because they are getting punished when they literally cant do anything. Also I dont want to bring perk builds just to have a defense from camping.
---
Predator spreads the scratch marks and can confuse you.
---
While I agree that you have to play around certain perks in the match, I think Adrenaline is way too powerful, and shouldn't be a perk that you have to play around, a perk that allows all of those 3 survivors to get up and removes that killers map pressure like that.  That killer was keeping track of the gen progress as well, the 4th gen only just popped, I think many people would assume they have longer than 10 seconds.
---
I was more attached to Quentin in the remake anyways. If it was original I'd be perturbed though.
---
Is realism really important in a game like this though? We have a murderous spider god creature, a woman that can teleport, a guy who can turn invisible.
---
That‚Äôs good and so is tampered timer and jigsaws sketch, for an extra jiggy box.
---
So simply you posted this to whine?
---
What did I expect from a survivor main.
---
Also here's a buff for ya.
---
When the flashlight runs out. You can throw it at the killer. 
---
That way you might get a use out of it.
---
Dude I‚Äôve been wishing for a totem counter forever, I refuse to play survivor solo because of the fact nobody even tries for totems but me or if I‚Äôm in a swf and we have to constantly try and figure out who got which totems and hope we didn‚Äôt miscount
---
I thought he was unique and an interesting addition to the movie, I'm glad he's in the game
---
I'm not saying that it should be the way they're suggesting, but it seems like you ignored what they said. Bloodpoints will still be capped at the same total possible with the current system (8k√ó4 categories meaning 32k possible each match as of now) and they're suggesting the categories themselves shouldn't be capped (I can earn my 32k bp from being chased the whole match, not just 8k from boldness) meaning that you wouldn't be able to earn 999999 bp each match, just more likely to earn the 32k that is very hard to earn right now due to the "survival" and the "sacrifice" category.
---
And to do with your point. 
---
I was arguing your counter arguments you gave to other people.
---
So you're saying, fictional characters are actually real? A flashlight is real I don't think the fucking spirit is. 
---
A buff I can think of is when the flashlight is depleted it is thrown to cause distraction, just like you thought. However, not every killer is stupid.
---
I personally think you‚Äôre getting way ahead of yourself in assuming the mods removed them.
---
Eh, as for the survivor thing, it really isn't difficult to model a survivor, compared to creating a killer. Perks also aren't too problematic, it's just an icon and couple lines of code.
---
Bear in mind Ghostface was leaked on the 7th of May, pretty much 3 weeks ago. Ghostface isn't going to be coming out any earlier than the 31st. That's ample time to create a survivor model, finish off some perks, create a survivor portrait, and hey presto, you're done.
---
Within the dev build, they didn't even have an icon for Ghostface's only perk.
---
It‚Äôs been like this since Sunday in Australia. Feelsbad
---
Totally reminds of [this song](https://youtu.be/4Js-XbNj6Tk?t=37), but up tempo.
---
Yes, she will do it. We can make this the best mori in game.
---
Whenever I'm high rank, I play Myers or Doctor. Lower ranks like 10 plus I play Legion or Freddy
---
imagine getting heated by a ivory mori lol
---
Who cares?
---
were gonna live forever basically
---
I understand perfectly what they're saying, so don't worry about that. Perhaps I should have clarified, I'm saying that someone could decide to be a complete waste of a team slot by farming from the same category all game. For example, you could gain 32k points by chilling out in the basement all game.
---
The categories exist to encourage players to undertake a variety of roles.
---
There are a lot of things that are weird or broken about the pipping system. All survivors use the same pipping system as other survivors, so we're all subject to those weird rules. To me, pipping or rank really isn't that important, but to each their own.
---
During a recent livestream, I think they mentioned they were looking in to the emblems system, so maybe we'll see some news in the near future.
---
It's actually pretty good map for Survivors after they added 20 billion pallets.
---
People who are against the battle pass are idioticly selfish. They don't even need to buy the pass yet are complaining about it being a cash grab. At the end of the day it is giving us all something more to do and the money is going back into the game we are all wanting to succeed.
---
I don't get the resistance. This isn't EA dropping a battle pass on a star wars game, this is a small development team pumping out this game for us and any extra money i can give them to support their efforts in doing so.
---
Fucking hope not
---
Tomorrow? I thought it was Friday?
---
Oh man, I hope for shirtless Daddy Myers skin.
---
Ghostface??? That won't ever happen, we got The Legion!!!/s
---
Lol yea I feel the same. I always go for totems and it's rare others do as well. The other day every time I was on a totem a random claudette appeared, and I realised she was also checking them, which was nice.
---
I once played a game where another survivor was streaming, and I went to check their perspective afterwards. He was duoing with another person in the match and they were cleansing totems and OBSESSING over the one they couldn't find. Little did they know I had already cleansed it. Those two wasted a good 5 - 10 minutes looking for the totem that had already been done while the killer was chasing me ALL THAT TIME. It was pretty funny to watch. Killer turned out to have NOED and smacked me right at the gate entrance. I love players that are diligent enough to get all the totems because otherwise I would have been dead there.
---
I think it would be cool if you could shine a flashlight at a gen to speed up someone else‚Äôs repair speed. Wouldn‚Äôt be very useful as it would be faster just to help repair but in cases where a team wants to stick together the fourth survivor could be contributing to the gen. I like the idea more because it just makes logical sense.
---
Confirmed Ghostface's official reveal and information on Freddy's rework.
---
The survivor equivalent of bbq is "We're gonna live forever", if you want bp, get that from David King. To earn more bloodpoints overall, do things like: work on things with teammates (doing generators and healing with another person grants a bonus for cooperative actions), actions that are altruistic (unhooking, saving another survivor from the killers grasp, and healing tends to grant a lot of bp in the alturism category), getting chased (grants a lot of bp in the boldness category if you can last a while) and surviving the trial (grants 5k in the survival category).
---
&gt;Tomorrow? I thought it was Friday?
---
It is Friday.
---
Nosebleeding intensifies
---
play killer /s
---
Yes omg if we have one gen left while playing swf we will leave it at like 95% and look for the last totem panicking while someone gets chased, but there‚Äôs no better feeling than knowing randoms are getting totems with you
---
I always use Overcharge, Distressing, Overwhelming Presence, and NOED. There are certainly better builds, but it works great for me.
---
Overcharge, cuz it helps interrupt survivors and locate them.
---
Distressing, cuz a big terror radius is a must for the doctor, plus 100% extra BP.
---
Overwhelming Presence, cuz might as well waste their items with the large terror radius.
---
And NOED, as a sort of insurance, although if you play the doctor's strengths well, you won't have to use it very often.
---
My two favourite games side by side is a good sight to see.
---
Not tomorrow . We will get the news Friday
---
Truth
---
RAAARUGHHH
---
I don't think anyone would choose to sit in the basement for boldness considering itd take extremely long to do so, and the killer would probably figure out what youre doing before you even get a sizable amount, but I see your point. I don't agree that itd make bloodpoints mean nothing, as the things that grant you bloodpoints tend to benefit your side in some way anyway
---
That's the point of the perk. WGLF promotes farming. If you don't tunnel the obsession with dying light then you're wasting the perk. It's like bringing small game but you do gens instead of looking for ruin. Normally you'd do gens with ruin up, like a killer would play normally but if you have something to make your game that much easier why would you ignore it.
---
Of course it's psychicpebbles lmao
---
Naw, it's just another Tusken Raider noise
---
I am a pig player, and I approve this message.
---
The bandwagon of "oh no battlepass bad!" sort of ended.. 
---
People are selfish, the battlepass is not pay to win whatsoever and supports the developers. The game can't sustain itself with just the store alone. 
---
Also the mods wouldn't delete healthy discussion, calm down.
---
they are using the wrong pants reeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I live in the middle east and I have been playing the game everyday for almost a year. So let me tell you, the game is not so popular here (PC). I rarely find a lobby with an Arabian killer. 98% of the lobbies I join are with Russian or EU killers. 
---
But when I find an Arabian lobby, it is usually a pretty solid connection. Most people in the gulf countries have access to fiber internet. So maybe the problem is from your side.
---
To be clear, I didn't post this to talk bad about Tru3, I just find funny the fact he thinks EndFury is Huntresses best combo.
---
Hag and Spirit. But replace Remember Me, it's garbage now.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a very good perk, but I‚Äôd rather spend my shards on a dlc teachable than on a teachable that I can get without paying
---
Yeah they added it to where *everyone* was able to see who the obsession was and when they were In a chase. Then they just haven't done much of anything for solo survivors since then. 
---
Even in the OP, his ideas don't tell the exact position - just which survivors are on gens and which survivors are in chase and what items they're holding. His ideas don't give exact positions - Bond remains unaffected, which is good. 
---
SWFs can not only say that they're on gens, opening a gate, being chased but they can also give out details. "I'm on the shack gen, it's at 70%." "I'm opening the gate near shack." "I'm being chased, the killer has Spirit Fury active. Come disarm this trap at shack." Also: "I'm here for a flashlight save, go down in the open." OP's ideas just tell you the basics without the details that make SWF more powerful. 
---
And yes, I also really hope that after Freddy and dedicated servers, the devs time can be more spent on improving older things that need adjusted. I know an addon rework is coming soon for a lot of killers - the devs want every killer to have 2 ultra-rares and they want to change Iri-heads, Carb Tuning Guide, additional blink nurse, etc.
---
Don't worry, this is a visual bug where the map name and realm stay on your screen. You can't actually spawn on hooks lol
---
It's a one way shortcut to the Map's titular generator. 
---
Gideon's has the same thing. The bathroom generator has a hole I'm the roof where you can drop in as an alternate entrance.
---
League still gets heavily updated.
---
By "mean nothing" I mean that people would be able to get 32k every game with minimal effort
---
28th tommorow. The tweet. And its a shitpost.
---
R6 is a pretty good game, it just takes entire seasons to fix game ruining exploits and glitches.
---
"to keep it balanced, you receive a 0.5% speed increase to repair, healing, and sabotage speeds. However, to make sure it isn't too op, your aura is revealed to the killer at all times."
---
Yea having extra boxes is really nice too, do you know how much time crate of gears adds to the search it says considerably so I would think it would be pretty good.
---
If it's the same guys i played with, they asked me to join them on discord since it was 3 of them, i kindly said no to receive a heart wrenching "FUCK YOU" even when i told them about my bound envelope offering... i cri
---
*I think he liked that feeling... might try that again...*
---
Thats really good
---
You get it well.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation. It‚Äôs not like anyone truly knows me on this reddit so to justify myself I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm not racist. Like how the fuck else am i suppose to say it
---
And the one guy not even wearing a mask lol
---
This has happened to me as the killer, they usually don‚Äôt say anything at all
---
I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of tampered timer and crate of gears and never got my hat off. Either bad rng or a bit of a chase to keep me away from boxes.
---
Hey man, DbD is a hard game, just pay attention to how/when you're getting caught/hit and learn from your mistakes, I would also recommend watching a streamer with a lot of hours and notice the things they're doing like how they run tiles and the types of mindgames that are useful against killer players. A lot of getting better is just playing a lot to get a feel for timings on things and learning from your mistakes, recognizing what you did wrong. I wouldn't worry about rank because whether or not you pip isn't really a good representation of your skill at the game anyway and if you only focus on ranking up you probably won't improve as much.
---
‚ÄúMost people to start doing dull totems‚Äù
---
No clue what rank you‚Äôre at, but my experience with fandoms has been much different.
---
If you win too quickly as killer you still wont pip. I've had quick 5 minute 4k matches and I usually just safety pip.
---
heard you talking shit
---
Stop being a fucking troll. 
---
Because I don‚Äôt put the black characters higher lmfao shut the fuck up.   
---
Making shit about race on a Dead By Daylight subreddit honestly doesn‚Äôt surprise me. Y‚Äôall will find something to be dickheads about.
---
Unless the killer chooses to farm and willingly let's them (in which case they'll be getting 8k in every category except for maybe survival even in its current way) then I wouldn't say they would be able to get 32k bp every match. The survivors wouldn't often anyway, the killer most likely would because the use of their power already gives a lot depending on who youre playing, but this is more about survivor bp gain than it is killer bp gain.
---
This isnt instagram
---
I know you‚Äôre joking but these situations are pretty much entirely up to the survivors skill level.  I just P3‚Äôd my spirit this morning and was running with nearly no perks like you and was 4k‚Äôing most games but a lot of the survivors just made bad plays that gave me easy downs etc.
---
What matches are you in where it takes 10 minutes dude? Totems are really easy to find most of the time.
---
I LOVE HIS BEARD
---
Young Ash **hell yes**
---
This Ash *hell no*
---
My point still stands. You could get far more bloodpoints than you deserve by doing the same thing all game, rather than adapting and helping the team. The current system is fine.
---
Wait I 4K‚Äôd?
---
Nice
---
Ghostface was leaked and is 100% confirmed.
---
Don‚Äôt insult me for my rank this is my alt
---
Plus side, facecamping only counters once (usually)
---
'Facecamping Only Counters Once' would also be an awful name for a Bond movie
---
Ashy Slashy is S tier.
---
I understand this outlook, but battle passes belong in free games. I already spent a lot of money on this game between the base game and dlc.
---
Were you not the killer in this game?
---
I love her ‚ô°
---
if its well hidden even a SWF will have trouble finding it
---
especially if they choose to teabag, flashlight spam and sabotage all the hooks so you cant get any points 
---
so i let the end game kill them all
---
This is the better option imo too, try to use the official forums.
---
Ye
---
Yes, but actually no.
---
We're likely getting a teaser of some sort tomorrow, given that that was the original intention. The full dev discussion about Ghostface is coming Friday.
---
Because it doesnt matter
---
If devs wnt to implement it then will either we like it or not
---
That "what the fuck" at the end is so accurate when I get hit by bullshit hatchet.
---
Quem voc√™ ta se referindo?
---
Rest is F
---
I had a solo game where I ran Detectives Hunch and a map with the addon where everyone can see my map auras. Finished the first gen and had all the totems revealed immediately and showed them off plenty of times. I only had enough time to get half before endgame and nobody even attempted to get totems. Killer had NOED and got 2 of them on their death hooks. I don't think anyone ever tries to get totems.
---
Doc numba 1
---
It's stupid for them to ask for more money though. It's a opinion, and I dont believe that a battle pass belongs in a non free to play game.
---
&gt;So simply you posted this to whine? What did I expect from a survivor main.
---
When did I say I was a survivor main? We were having a reasonable discussion up until now. Also, why does what I play impact on my point?
---
Sounds like they got their just desserts
---
wtf how does that happen
---
If you start to experience insults and flaming of the survivors and it brings you down, you can close the chat by clicking the arrow below it. That way you don't have to see their childish behaviour. Once you get into purple ranks it starts to get really toxic.
---
If you win as a killer it's mostly fine and none of them will say a word but if 3 or even 4 survive be ready for some insults.
---
Wow. Wasn't a post about The Pig. Im shocked lol.
---
Keys and Maps are real but they have magical fictional uses in this game. Why can't a flashlight?
---
Cool.. but noed on billy?
---
This is true, but it has no prerequisites and can't be taken away like aftercare.
---
If you only see it from the survivor point of view you don't understand it from both sides and can't make an accurate assumption of a part of the game.
---
Nor critique it fully.
---
I'm planning on going into the game development line of work after I graduate and crunch time is the one thing I am super scared of.
---
I hope more companies adapt this mentality, I'd never get a job at BHVR and I'm not looking forward to crunch time
---
Should've changed the bloodpoint icon to an upvote one
---
Keys are used to open a lock in this game no? And maps are fucking useless just like irl. A flashlight is balanced and fine the way it is and will just cause more DCs on the killer behalf than there already is. Shit the fuck up with your entitled survivor ass
---
S: Nurse
---
S-: Spirit
---
A+: Hillbilly 
---
A: Huntress, Hag
---
A-: Michael, Clown, Plague
---
B: Pig, Legion, Freddy
---
B-: Trapper
---
C: Doctor
---
D: Leatherface
---
Let me explain: 
---
Spirit can‚Äôt be looped, while billy can, hence why she‚Äôs higher than him. 
---
Freddy has a built in stall, just like legion, and he‚Äôs not as bad as many people think he is. 
---
Pig can stall with her traps too, and use ambush to let survivors abandon loops to go into dead zones. 
---
Trapper has a really slow start, with little chance to get momentum, unlike hag. 
---
Doctor is really bad, and his power has a weird delay to the effect, and most of the times it‚Äôs useless because survivors can just do another loop. 
---
Leatherface is horrible, his chainsaw is so bad to instadown people and his tantrum is extremely long. 
---
Michael and plague can snowball really well with t3 and corruption purge if survivors start to chain the cleansing, while clown lacks map preassure but is really good at hitting people fast.
---
All cats wish to secretly murder, but Myers is the best your cat can get I guess
---
Console
---
So many nurses on ps4 right now.. crazy.. must be not be as hard as everyone thunks
---
This is so normal I was thinking about the difference between having the name "EZ CLAP" and "INEEDTOPEE"
---
This whole "low tier killers can't do red ranks" is bullshit( been rank 1 killer and survivor multiple seasons in a row(you rank up just by playing pretty much)) wraith is perfectly able to get a 4k at rank 1 it's about playstyle pick your perks and play around them. Switch targets. Apply pressure. Learn how to kill at loops or force them out early. And at the end it just takes practice, not everyone is good at everything ( not saying you're bad BTW just saying don't get discouraged and if your not a red rank player not everyone is supposed to be that's why it's high rank) watching some good people play killer will also help you pick up tricks and the like
---
Cake day upvote, though you speak the truth.
---
Myers. That way you can m1 but still have lethality.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm literally on rank 20 so why would I be bragging?
---
Why post this, then?
---
Must be absolutely riveting to hold the fate of three people in your own hands /s
---
yes but if NOED can reward me that much for losing then it is an overpowered perk 
---
sure it felt great to slug each of them
---
but imagine if i did that to a team that wasnt being toxic? completely unfair overall
---
If noed is active then ill just leave everyone to die
---
Because it was never actually confirmed. Just rumors and leaks. I am against the idea of a battle pass but in the end there's no point in talking about this topic everyday.
---
Seems like a basic ass killer who thinks they're so cool at decieving people.. people wonder why this community is so toxic! YOU ARE THE REASON HOMEBOY YOU...
---
I'm sad that I had to scroll so far down to see this post. The unknown is scary. All these factors and variables keep you on your toes, and make sure you never know what to expect. It's what makes solo play sometimes more interesting than SWF. I mean, generally it's completely worse. But SWF just isn't immersive at all and it's basically just shitposting on Discord while bullying a killer.
---
You could be playing as a killer baked potato at rank 20 and get 4ks.
---
Tampered Timer + Jigsaw Sketch is very good at getting kills, Crate of gears isn't the best option but its good, You can also use Annotated plan + Sketch so there are a ton of boxes to search for survivors.
---
I think I've lost 15 braincells from looking at this.
---
I could tolerate a some Spanish maybe a little German but midievil french is just taking it too far IMO
---
imagine being upset over a perk in a kill your friend session
---
Well, you would have had your rank reset, and Billy is one of the strongest killers, so yeah. EZ. 
---
Not getting the 4k would be a bigger oof than normal.
---
Matchmaking doesn't feel like it
---
anyone annoyed with the idea of a Battle Pass is just dumb. everything is a cash grab nowadays no matter what. if you don‚Äôt want it don‚Äôt buy it. even then it‚Äôll be like 10 bucks. i spent over 1000 USD on Overwatch and that was a 60 USD game (+70 USD for the collectors edition). it‚Äôs a 30 USD game with a small development team that have worked hard. yeah there are DLC &amp; Cosmetics but everyone is okay with them. they buy them anyway. if it‚Äôs good i‚Äôll buy it if it isn‚Äôt i‚Äôll still probably buy it since i love this game. a battle pass is to reward players with cosmetics and maybe some premium currency for a small price. and you‚Äôre rewarded for just playing the game. which you already do. for almost nothing... so take it. or don‚Äôt. just shhh. lol (this isn‚Äôt directed at the person who posted this or anyone in particular just people who are against anything and everything LOL)
---
I wasn't referring to a specific time or specific killer, I'm just referring to the feeling of satisfaction when you've been away and still 4k.
---
That is so cute. I'm all in to support new players on their new venture. DBD is very harsh to new players.
---
Nobody cares
---
You can have psychological horror and still have gore. "It Follows" is a perfect example. There's only one gore shot, but it's extremely effective in showing what happens if you let the thing catch you, and the rest of the film is based on not knowing when or where the thing is generally.
---
*Cries in Ghostface*
---
Perks mean nothing in this game if you‚Äôre not actually good at it, they help but they don‚Äôt equal an automatic win.
---
Why Quinten so cute
---
From someone who likes to buy things on implosive sprees (why did I buy a PS4 controller when I have two already that work well)  because I have mental issues, I think this is an awful idea because I know I will spend money on it because I have no control of myself. Battlepasses take advantage of people like me.
---
Ever since the first time this duo was posted on Reddit, I've seen a lot of imposters copying their idea. None of the imposters were as good of players as the original duo was. 
---
They might not be the same guy on your friends list.
---
Myers lookin at that charger cord like he is going to stalk it loose.
---
Noo not the baby dweet
---
Well, it‚Äôs rank 20
---
The exclamation point tells me it probably is
---
Yeah man, how dare he leave you on the ground and go after injured people near you. Unless a killer literally just downs and NEVER picks people up, they're not really a slugger. I swear, Survivors are such whiners. They don't get picked up instantly, so they can be flashlight saved or pallet saved, they whine about sluggers. They get picked up instantly, and hooked in the basement as their team swarms the shack, oop, hes a camper. He closes the hatch? Wow, what a scumbag, not giving hatch. He runs (You name Perk) and he's a meta running jerk. can't be pleased mate, can't be pleased.
---
Boohoo. Was an. I qued for 10 minutes and you dodged me. - the otherside of the arguement.
---
It forces them to stay one shot. Many people would agree that NOED isn‚Äôt as good as these perks. Finding totems isn‚Äôt hard and they don‚Äôt take long.
---
And none of those are as impactful as MoM. Glad they‚Äòre changing it.
---
*sad vacuum noises*
---
Then why does everyone run them?
---
One of my friends got tombstoned by a Myers in the exit doing the same thing. I could only imagine what it‚Äôd feel like to pull that off
---
They‚Äôre like rank 20
---
I think they either are fake or just saved up in the bloodweb
---
Is this old? Never seen him use enduring spirit fury on huntress in the almost 3 years I‚Äôve been watching
---
Ya I was thinking two extra boxes would be pretty strong even tho the green gives the survivors a bit more time, Especially on maps like swamp and haddonfield where its harder to get to all the boxes quickly.
---
I bet that Dwights‚Äô life flashed before his eyes when you materialized next to him.
---
 Nurse. lol
---
Your rank is not determined by your bloodweb
---
Yeah, all I'm seeing is survivors making a dumb mistake and then being saved by stacked-up crutch perks.
---
r/accidentalreposts
---
What the difference?
---
What did I read?
---
Delete your Engine.ini if you did anything in it. Launching the game will spawn a new one.
---
In your GameUserSettings.ini, set bUseVSync=False and FrameRateLimit=1000.000000. That's how you disable V-Sync and uncap framerate. If your game is crashing with these settings, it's because of your PC. Could be a variety of things, such as overheating or a failing component. You can limit the framerate at some like 100fps instead (FrameRateLimit=100.000000), or slightly underclock your GPU, if it is the culprit.
---
Groovy. Finally some effort and creativity!
---
I didn't say it was bad
---
Im an idiot I thought you said it was bad. Lol
---
Pig = Upvote

This is my daily.

Meme from the DBD Parody
---
"The killer tier list but it's bing bong sad oinks daddy"
---
That rule refers to programs that affect game files. Wall hacks, speed hacks, for survivors I guess it'd be something that makes skillchecks automatic.
---
The game is distributed via steam on the PCs, if I want I can use the steam's voice chat option to communicate. Using voice chat doesn't break any of the rules.
---
I want an Iridescent Belt instead of Heads. 
---
Give me more hatchets so I don't have to waste as much time reloading. I don't think it would be broken considering it takes place of a wind up add-on or cooldown. 
---
Something I thought after seeing Clown reloading wherever he is. Give Huntress a pink add-on that gives 1 reload without needing a locker after reloading **twice** in a locker. This would be very helpful in maps with shitty locker placements.
---
Just some ideas.
---
Same thing ebony Mori because I have so many of them in my inventory but if I ever use one a survivor will dc while the game is loading and deny the match from even starting. I don‚Äôt blame them though I‚Äôm guilty of doing the same
---
Sounds more like a DC problem to me.
---
Honestly I don't even mind saying against an iri huntress, I think the max hatchets she should be able to carry with iri is 2. They should make it unable to pair wit add ons that increase it to more than that imo
---
I only bring flashlights with Object of Obsession and hope it's a Wraith, Hag, or Spirit. They're basically useless beyond the first flashlight save and that's when the killer MIGHT have his guard down.
---
&gt;Same thing ebony Mori because I have so many of them in my inventory but if I ever use one a survivor will dc while the game is loading and deny the match from even starting. I don‚Äôt blame them though I‚Äôm guilty of doing the same
---
Now that steam added "force quit" option, closing DBD is so easily. Whenever I see a mori, I just close my game.
---
Yeah they‚Äôre iridescent, they‚Äôre supposed to be broken and tbf her hatches are easily dodgeable
---
&gt;DbD is a fun experience, that we get to have when the SWF groups are away.
---
There is a ton of people that hates playing solo survivor due to terrible teammates and frustration.
---
&gt;SWF teabag and click torches
---
I don't think either of these are a problem, but regardless of that, this behaviour isn't limited to SWF.
---
I miss the old dailies :(
---
I‚Äôm no dbd god by any means. But at least I don‚Äôt have to run noed on Spirit üòÇ thx for the feel good moment op :)
---
But then survivors actually require to use skill and thought
---
Cant have that in this game
---
Iridescent Heads should just trump all other Add-Ons. If you use them, you get one hatchet, and that‚Äôs that.
---
GG EZ
---
Do we go back to 1 with crappy 65 shards after 100 lol?
---
Bring a flashlight or Spine Chill. Easy way to fuck the Spirit attempting to mindgame.
---
That laugh was obnoxious
---
Met them too but a couple days ago.
---
I have yet to prestige my Spirit and I get one or two prayer beads each bloodweb. So who knows
---
I got a few offerings for this map. In just gunna put on insidious with no add-ons to see what happens.
---
Reminds me of how much I want amiibo costumes in the switch version; specifically Dwight as Luigi.
---
UNBARMHERZIGER KILLER
---
That says a lot about you. 
---
But yeah no one cares lol.
---
I'm glad Claudette is down there. If I see cute survivors I sometimes let them go. But I make no exceptions for Claudette.
---
Jeff is leaving for his people
---
Or Bubba with chainsaw revved
---
It is a shitpost. You people are easy
---
As someone who gets rank 1 two days after reset even after the changes, enjoy being at rank 11 for the love of god. Cherish it, love it, don't ever let it go.
---
Nah, your wording made it seem like you fully do this and feel this way.  It‚Äôs not far fetched
---
Alot of things nulify other things completely.... like bbq, you can nulify it by getting inside a locker, noed can be nulified completely aswell. That is called counterplay my dude... its something natural to a game, and most things are nerfed because of lack of counter play like legion and MoM(That will be chanced soon).
---
&gt;Removing the infinites and some windows aren't buffs to killers
---
Yes they are? You can't get looped around them forever, that is a buff.
---
&gt;Perks from new killers aren't a buff
---
They absolutely are, Spirit fury, Corrupted intervention, infectious fright. All of these had major impact on killer's power. Spirit fury is meta on like all of 115% m1 killers.
---
Mangled, BBQ, Nurse's Calling, and Franklin's all day.
---
I had my first Nurse game last night in months...and...I can see! What is this fuckery? Have they actually fixed Nurse because I felt like I was on PC.
---
why would we post the same shit over and over again if it's not going to change anything?
---
This Freddy revamp is looking pretty sweet. Loving what they did with Black Box. &lt;3
---
We have been doing this for awhile now. Here we are with Princess Peach. https://clips.twitch.tv/AuspiciousBigFlyKeepo
---
This along with prayer beads is an auto DC from me, beyond broken and overpowered, it‚Äôll be like survivors having unlimited meter of man.
---
Yea that add-on needs to be reworked. It's impossible not to dominate with it.
---
Play the killer /s
---
You edited your comment to personally insult a character or me.  You‚Äôre such a troll lmao ok
---
The Prestige buff after multiple tests has shown to be a negligible to almost unnoticeable. It's likely just your lucky day today that they keep popping up. 
---
Unless BHVR shadow buffed the blood webs but I doubt that has happened.
---
Endgame collapse is also a killer buff.
---
No one asked.
---
The same way you are allowed to express all the above, the people whom are against it can express it too, you don't have to "shhh" anyone. It's a discussion, one which isn't yours to regulate.
---
Just Jane by the way BBW is my go to
---
So they added mouse and keyboard support on consoles for dbb?
---
When you install dbd on a floppy disk and the games half over by the time you load in.
---
Trust me, it's way better off to stay in low/medium ranks. All what high rank gives you is longer queue times and less variety with killers
---
That's super duper evil... I like it.
---
Clearly? Lol wtf every M1 killer runs Enduring and Nurse‚Äôs has been one of the best perks in the game since launch
---
It does? Guess YT just wants to spam league stuff to me when I don't even play the damn game.
---
This is what we should reffer to as "salty" from now on
---
r/unexpectedb99
---
I'm here just to read the comments.
---
Also I find this chart very accurate.
---
Dbd is only available in ranked mode online. Which is competitive. You're literally competing against the killer or survivors. If you're kyf, I agree it's casual play. However, ranked gameplay is competitive. Anyway, have a good rest of your day, nice meeting you. &lt;3
---
***^(BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN)***
---
It's funny cause Dwight just smiling lol
---
That would actually be pretty shit then. I'd rather have the potential to down 2.5 survivors with one reload compared to 1 hatchet with one reload, and the first option isn't even using any addons vs. an ultra rare.
---
Enduring isn't that good without spirit fury, and nurses is fine but being able to one shot people and move faster is clearly better AND less fun to play against.
---
I think even he‚Äôs wondering how he got in that situation
---
i think it's just luck, i didn't prestiged Spirit but i leveled her up 'cause i wanna try her out and i have around 40 prayer beads already (i even got 4 in a single bloodweb)
---
Idk man i feel like even with the amount of money i've spent isnt nearly as much as what other devs expect their audience to play, even after the game and dlc and even some merch. I get that we have put money into the game, this is just another way to do that and it rewards you a lot more than typical dlc.
---
The only one who was toxic was you with your unnecessary "sherlock" comment
---
There should exist a killer that can jumpscare in that way. Like a Nurse but without effects.
---
Get fucked
---
I think he means that the Spirit will look away from them in order to navigate to the survivor, but it's not always the case since she can move sideways while staring at the spot the survivor was in.
---
You want to be MY lover?! Earn It!
---
jokes on u brutal strength is a crutch
---
Reallly because one killer doesnt work well in them they won't make indoor maps? That's just stupid. F billy.
---
You're far less likely to pip
---
Lightweight, Lithe, Dance with me, and Urban evasion. If I'm gonna survive, I like to do it ninja style.
---
I'm not being a douche, it's just memes. You need thicker skin if that much sets you off :/
---
Could you imagine this on Freddy or a Doctor with Unnerving Presence, Overcharge and Huntress Lullaby?
---
What is pip?
---
The points that let you rank up
---
Always!! I'm always yelling how tf did that hit!!
---
Oh ok thanks
---
I imagine its people who want a realistic looking battle royale instead of fortnite's cartoon style.
---
Ugh I hate them both.
---
Wow, this game is perfect. 
---
the only reason i dislike Doctor is because his madness causes framerate drops and that can mess up my skill checks
---
Probably because it feeds the brain a new challenge every time with no battle being the same.
---
I really like it so far, but the Susie‚Äôs body is a little too... ahem... shapely to put it. Also, the arms are a little thin. Don‚Äôt take any of this badly, just constructive criticism
---
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôm waiting forever as a solo survivor.
---
&gt; They've said they won't do it because of billy not working that well in them
---
Can we get a source on that chief.
---
They just quit. Lmao. "That was MY map. I DC."
---
It really is not a case of "Needing thicker skin" You're just "Thick in the skull" if you can't see what you said was being a douche.
---
That isn't Luigi its Green Mario
---
What?! Lmao!
---
Can't you tell youtube you aren't interested in that sort of ad? I do it all the time with anime stuff (don't @me).
---
Um, no?? Just pointing out how sad it is to have noed on a top tier killer
---
David really farms? No dignity.
---
I never had any hitbox related issue in DBD aside from occasional Billy's chainsaw after they increased it to band-aid fix false chainsaws. Every time I got hit when it looked like it shouldn't connect, is due to ping. 
---
90% of people complaining about hitbox don't know how latency works. You are probably one of them since you made sure to let us know you have a good connection, as if it mattered. Distance between you and the host is the only thing that matters. You could also encounter some issues related to random spikes in your connection or the host's.

oh boohoooo üò™
---
I‚Äôve got a whole stack of them. I‚Äôve used them in one game and it was not a fun game at all. I haven‚Äôt used them since and I always convince myself I‚Äôm saving them for a rainy day, but they are just too damn strong. I do not enjoy them at all. Worst thing is, I keep buying them in the damn bloodweb.
---
I really like the idea, with tight halls but lots of open gaps
---
I WANT TO DOWNLOAD THEM, BEST CROSSOVER EVER
---
Yea I got it unlocked

Remember, not every killer is grown. Some are little babbies. I don't normally use such a derogatory term, because I was once a baby killer. However...well, you know...some people try and basement camp as Freddy. Some people unironically play Nurse with perks like Enduring. Some people willingly play Leatherface.

Poor Trapper.

Wtf is that ending

I think they should be replaced with Iridescent Vocal Cords.
---
Iridescent Vocal Cords: Glass like vocal cords reverberating with power allow the The Huntress to no longer emit a 48 meter hum.

or

Iridescent Vocal Cords: Glass like vocal cords reverberating with power allow The Huntress' 48 meter hum to be heard across the entire map, and become no longer directional.

Love/Hate relationships with the game essentially.

My computer is a fine oiked machine. No overheating or failing components. It's just a bad console port.

CJ definitely brought the mori tho.

Tunneling is a legitimate tactic and generally needed vs a good SWF. Complaining about that is just like complaining about genrushing.

I think you‚Äôd need both to mind game her and even then:
---
You shine flashlight at her and she doesn‚Äôt turn around she gets blinded 
---
You shine flashlight at her and she phases (while standing still) still lighting up spike chill so you either vault and she is on the same side from where she started 
---
She turns around and phases over to you giving you notice via spine chill 
---
Or she turns around then phases then turns around making you think she went around 
---
Does that make sense ? 
---
I think it‚Äôs still mind game able
---
Nah.
---
I swear that's Ochido.

I was gonna say burger king Myers but you said it has to actually work
---
That's fine my man:)
---
Here‚Äôs what happened: I was playing Myers on PS4 (rank 12) and absolutely destroyed the survivors. They got 0 gens done, and I managed to get them all killed fairly quickly. After the game this person messages me calling me a tryhard. 
---
I thought the goal of the game was to kill the survivors, but apparently doing that makes me a tryhard? Lmao
---
You can with normal vids and ads, youtube just doesn't care.

Watch out for the uplay people but WE STILL HAVE MORE ON STEAM
