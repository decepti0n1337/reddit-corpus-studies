Why? The double blade glitch was removed.
---
---
---
The horse got burnt(for some reason)and got blinded because of it. But Entity granted Maurice that weirdass third eye so he could see
---
you look dope !
---
-Platform: PC
---
-Type of Bug: Visual, Minor
---
-Description: Describe the bug that occured.
---
-Screenshot / Video: I unfortunately didn‚Äôt catch one because I was in a rather intense match
---
-Steps to reproduce: Chase a survivor with Legion
---
Go into Feral Frenzy, near the end of the duration
---
Lunge through a pallet
---
Land the hit and get stunned by the pallet being thrown down.
---
-Expected result: The regular stun animation playing out, possibly with some screen dimming.
---
-Actual result: Semi-permanent flashing designs on the screen following the red pallet stun effect, didn‚Äôt go away until the next frenzy.
---
-Reproduction rate: Around 30%, it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. 
---
-System Specs (PC only): Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7 4700HQ Processor
---
16 GB DDR3L 1600 MHz SDRAM
---
NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GTX 780M 4GB GDDR5
---
Platform: PC
---

---
Bug type: in game 
---
Played a legion where all survivor actions were slowed, including gens, healing, mending, and saving. Red bar, and no perks like thanatophobia that would slow anything. Was running both blade add-ons.
---
Not a massive fan of the skin itself HOWEVER I love that weapon design
---
sorry but this kind of thing pisses a lot of artists off, you copied, studied and recreated ( a less polished ) official artwork...
---
There are artists making things out of thin air with love for this game and it is downright stupid that traced or simply unpolished uninspired copied official artworks get more traction. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Appreciate what you're doing can make a different or add to this sour trade and make something yourself, use references for posing if that helps but make something new please. 
---
Stay away from art theft and unaccredited use of references whilst you're there, that's another gripe.
---
Does anyone remember the old BNPs? You just hopped in a match and lost 4 gens in literally 5 seconds. And then you got infinite vacuum pallet looped. Ah the good old times.
---
To be fair, the free built in roaming insidious sure is helping out those proxy campers at Green ranks.
---
Makes the climb back to purp/red take soooooo much longer, it's frustrating to say the least.
---
1,2 stop1,2 stop 1,2 stop it‚Äôs easy
---
I call this one the Narnia juke.
---
i lost all my shit :(
---
I mean in the movie Jason won Freddy got gecking decapitated
---
He‚Äôs just not a great killer, gets pallet looped just like every other m1 killer and his power doesn‚Äôt help in any important ways such at map pressure and chase potential
---
Maybe you missed kid.   Cause my shit works
---
Hillbilly: 2 human kills and a bunch of farm animals
---
This isn‚Äôt symbolizing that Jason won just like in the movie. I‚Äôm making a comparison between two games not who wins. But yes spoiler alert Jason wins
---
Plague did nothing wrong.
---
Crypto950&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatzittoya
---
Ran into this swf group with really interesting names
---
Please make my titles
---
Literally everyone does
---
Ghostface isn‚Äôt powerful once you understand his ability playing against him just requires keen eyes and teammates that aren‚Äôt Potatoes after that it‚Äôs fun to play against him cuz you‚Äôre always on the lookout for him
---
I got accused of speedhacking for running Hope.
---
So you're saying that (before the Entity stepped in) not only was she not a Killer; she wasn't much of a Survivor either?
---
Move forward
---
This is the entity subtly showing you your place
---
Really? Exact opposite for me.
---
Cry more kid. The devs are doing what they can when they can, they created this game and you would have never played it if it weren‚Äôt for them, so leave the game if you don‚Äôt respect their process.
---
That's true. The biggest thing for me about him is I just activate shroud and walk around if I dont spot them they spot me and I know where someone hiding is. That alone is incredibly useful. I only get a few instant downs with him per match anyhow.
---
When this noob Claudette thought I was hacking when I downed her with devour hope and said that her and the 3 other guys (even though they didn‚Äôt) would report and block me
---
Tell me about that map... aura's are still my biggest problem on that map. Another problem is that the jungle gyms are so different that I just can't run em neither as killer nor survivor
---
Either you need some sleep, get off the drugs or the entity is reaching out to you preparing you to become the next killer. Be ready to commit a grave act of violence in the comming months if it's the last option
---
I have it captured but I can't upload it on here üò©
---
Not seen freddy or leather face in months and haven't seen plague once ever
---
She didn‚Äôt even dash. She just frolicked up to you like *Whats up youngins? Need some help*
---
For some reason i cant play killer, the game says it is creating a lobby but it doesnt create
---
Let‚Äôs face the reality that the devs don‚Äôt exactly have an exemplary reputation. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve supported the game since beta and will continue to do so. It just sucks waiting for a ‚Äúhotfix‚Äù on a new bug completely unrelated to the patch not roll out for 3+ days.
---
Oh yes...the good ol invisible trick works everytime...lmfao
---
I love this work but I also love bing bong boi so I hope one of his concepts win but if not I'd like this to cause the concept is LIT.
---
How do you get to that rank and not know that yet? lol  I need to play against the killers they played against.
---
dummy thiq
---
Ghostface's weird noises when moving (Especially when your shroud is up) makes me feel like I just deployed a parachute or I turned into a flag flapping on a flagpole. 
---
I guess it's supposed to be those weird Infinity Bandana looking strips moving around, but it sounds more like wind going through a flag or parachute. Honestly I don't know if Ghostface even has breathing audio, all I notice is the breezy sounds.
---
I swear didn't these posts die ages ago?
---
This explains why, for the first time ever, I saw a survivor using Wake Up recently. D a r n.
---
I just cant play killer, the game doesnt create a lobby
---
Dude had you on a list and was waiting for that moment his whole life....just to fall short lmfao gotta love it.
---
Make a better game then. And play that
---
I love the treat of a good ol ban, really wakes me up in the morning haha.
---
SFM C;
---
they do now also the legion issue
---
What? No, I don't pull cheap stuff like that.
---
Yeah, because then, there'd be no drawback to it whatsoever. RIP Dead Hard and literally any other exhaustion perk in the game if that change was implemented.
---
I mean maybe whispers or pop. I don't really think any other perks are worth running.
---
Tbh it's not only survivors. Their perks get nerfed too.
---
I had this same thing happen lol it went away when the match started.
---
Oh I've gotten similar usually they say I'm a shit killer because I tunneled everyone which then I had to ask how I can tunnel and entire team? But hey gotta love it lmao
---
Hey could you make this a blank template? this is some Grade A meme potential!
---
Now you're just describing my playstyle
---
Quite possibly the worst argument of all time for many reasons. I‚Äôve been on dev teams for games with higher meta critic ratings by double digits. It‚Äôs their job. It‚Äôs not my job to fix their game. If you hired a worker to make pizzas for you, and they didn‚Äôt make any pizzas you wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwell just make them yourself‚Äù. Devs are employed ultimately by the game‚Äôs fan base.
---
&gt; People need to stop maining one side.  
---
Maining is fine. It's a video game. If maining is more fun for someone then that's what they should do.
---
&gt; I'm not sure why but I only had one match where people opened the gate. 
---
What rank? Not being snarky, genuine question. Balance of perks, killers, etc varies a lot by rank. Not that the abilities change obviously, but some mechanics are really hard for beginners to combat but useless at higher ranks.
---
Spine chill is god, premonition is trash
---
This is the best of the best
---
I‚Äôm in red ranks. I never lose a game as Nurse. Never. I‚Äôve also never won a game against a skilled nurse, even as a 4 man SWF.   She‚Äôs ridiculously overpowered.
---
That perk is literally broken. Never works as intended.
---
Oh, that's good to hear. Yes, shorter CD would be nice. Maybe 20 seconds, like the updated version of Windows Of Opportunity.
---
Have fun getting dodged. Bye.
---
It lasted until I died lol. It really did predict that I would die.
---
I don't get it
---
there‚Äôs a glitch going on with it that‚Äôs pretty much it. It‚Äôs super good.
---
Idk I saw someone do a Urban evasion gang meme and thought it was funny, so i made this.
---
T-Thanks Entity....
---
I feel your pain the only time I get accused for hacking is with spirit because apparently using nurses calling, BBQ &amp; Chill and the fathers glasses wasn‚Äôt the way I was tracking it was using hacks
---
Any leaks of who it might be?
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Naw he looks like a pizza face
---
Lol. Seriously downvoting my comment cause y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt use common sense to get the video lol.  üòÇüòùüòù
---
I was staring for like 2 min wondering "Why does he have Noed?" then I kinda thought maybe he just wanted to the movement speed perhaps? I don't know it's kinda odd too be honest.
---
Haha, she died
---
The difference in audio is far larger than the intended reduction for some people. Some kind of 5.1/7.1 channel issue. The chase music is nonexistent, and no music on the title menu either - certainly not intended. If you go here https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/69653/music-barely-there-or-missing#latest , even BHVR devs have acknowledged it. It is all over the forums. I have the same problem (Xbox One) and it makes the game unplayable
---
no no I‚Äôm not saying you misspelled it, I just quoted it because I thought it was funny that you called them normies üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs true
---
How do survivors BM? Just wondering. Pretty new to the game.
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!!!
---
Stridor is probably better on Billy, but requires a bit more skill to use effectively.
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
That Jane one is gorgeous
---
I got a daily as wraith to hit survivors four times while getting out of Wraith's ability. Don't really play wraith, so I knew I was fucked, and sure enough got no kills that game, but got my daily. While I was queing up for another game, I got a friend request. The message was in short (and also in terms of english and not LOOOLOL G EZ DCING KILER LMAO U SU BAD LMAO U NEED 2 GET A LIFE) "lol, we all escaped, and you quit which means you don't get any bloodpoints and depip!" The thing is, I still got my points, I just left as soon as the match ended so I could get another daily as a friendly farmer Legion done. So I started a message with him and tried to explain that. All I remember about the messaging was that he changed the name of it while I was explaining that to "quitter noob". Looking back at his behavior, he was probably a nine-year old.
---
Ghostface is way too fucking slow, I got pooped constantly by a toxic little bitch ass nea that would teabag and blind at every pallet, then while I was chasing her I got gen rushed. 0/10 would not recommend
---
Prepare for a knife up the anus
---
When people say Quentin has the worst perks as a survivor but little did they know, Wake Up is the god perk now.
---
whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  
---
i say you win
---
Hmm I wonder what that perk could be
---
Your best bet would be to check out leaksbydaylight. They update that subreddit instantly the moment something is leaked
---
Oh my lord. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!
---
You must get destroyed by ghostface, wraith, pig and myers then
---
nobody mentions hag either, just look at her she barely has flesh on her bones! she shouldn't have been able to kill the cannibals who kidnapped her much less carry survivors
---
I was going to make a joke involving distortion but this pretty much takes the cake
---
Who even found the bug for Wake Up anyways? Did it just randomly occur to them to open the gates faster then saw this bug and spread it like wildfire? It's kinda odd but it's now the new meta at this point until it gets patched.
---
2 Kills is not a loss. 2 Kills is at Minimum a Draw
---
I mean, they did do that
---
Stack NOED with Play with your Food and Infinite Tier 3 Tombstone? 
---
S P E E D
---
I have success with Ruin, Sloppy and Nurses, paired with Restraint and an electrode. Once you zap everyone to madness 3 once, you get doctor illusions for that survivor for the rest of the game, which means you constantly know where everyone is. Since survivors cant hide, and with Snapping and Healing thru sloppy buying a bunch of time, the doc can actually quite a bit of pressure.
---
I run BBQ as the fourth perk, and i doubt its optimal for this build but the BPs and extra aura reads makes up for any suboptimal preformance.
---
I mean well by technicality jason did win in the movie but he didnt entirely win the whole fight because freddys head winked at the end meaning it was most likely a dream of Jason's and we know Freddy has a hardcore advantage in the dream world so yes jason did win only to lose the fight at a later time off screen due to the fact that Freddy and jason are in fact back to their normal places, Freddy in the dream world and jason asleep in the lake. So they both won the fight in their own way. And as long as nobody Is a loser we're all winners
---
Head On may be a meme perk that sometimes doesn't work at all but I have been having so much fun with it since I recently obtained it. Whenever it finally appears on the shrine will be an interesting time.
---
But anyways I do agree that the lack of always-viable perks is an issue. I've always thought that they changed decisive strike the way they did because they tested out the old mettle of man and realized how utterly broken that combo would have been.
---
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?
---
-Staying away from you. That‚Äôs a cute outfit, did your husband give it to you?
---
Exactly this.
---
Sometimes I can't understand what the center is but I just know your characters head has to also point at ghostface sometimes. But when your crouching behind cover it's like adjusting your scope but with the camera and targeting ghostface.
---
Ghostface isn‚Äôt exactly a threat if he walks up to you, no instadown unless he gets a good stalk, wraith is m1 no insta down and has to uncloak first, pig is m1 no instadown, and Myers heartbeat is gone for like 10 seconds of the game. The problem comes when bubba comes from around a corner and you don‚Äôt have a window to hop or tight loop to run. 1 hit downs are the issue. If you tank a hit from an m1 killer you can still run them around and escape lmao
---
That is not true. You can  Safety Pip/Pip with Just 2 Kills.
---
As far as the data, they have shown us data both of only SWF and excluding SWF.  Both sets of data shows the Killers have the advantage over Survivors.  Every. Single. Map. In. The. Game favors Killers.  Try finding 1 Map with a Sub 50% Kill Rate
---
You dare lose a chase!!!???
---
Lmao you're lucky you weren't around in December 2016 when the game was actually unplayable for over a month.
---
You know you fucked up when the double face palm come out üòÇüòÇ
---
Plague lead a lot of people to die saying our god will save is
---
Dead!
---
Freddy cause when that rework comes all the p3 Freddy mains gonna be clapping survivor cheeks. Or clown to stop chases real quick

There is also a thing where if u stand facing the hill and heal someone. u can levitate on top of the actual hook
---
There are so many good ones. BHVR should just choose two to be free and have the others available for Auric Cells.
---
Sounds like avp again. Just without the aliens to fight Predatop OPness.
---
I wasn't complaining, in the game I did kill him I was just letting him know that it is an exploit and can be banable due to ToS
---
Well you‚Äôre a game dev, so make a better game then.
---
Neither of them won though. It was a tie.
---
Freddy was still alive at the end, and even playful with that wink.
---
Freddy DID actually have Jason beat though, in a fair 1 on 1. The only reason he didn't actually win in the end though was because a couple of teenagers got in the way.
---
PS4 as well. But it's not just if you vomit. Always near the end.
---
Love it, the smile is fantastic and the clothes are really styling.
---
Hope this one makes it.
---
I was against a Myers who ran the bow and infinite, he was ahead of his time
---
Yeah, I know Nurse's is real good with him seeing people snap out and healing, but I hadn't really thought about Sloppy.
---
Man, there's just so many that are good with him.
---
Just had a match running Ruin, Distressing, Brutal, and Unrelenting - 4k and 4 gens left on Backwater. If I can get 1 dead, the rest of the match pretty well takes care of itself.
---
Getting 2k with any gens left is a death sentence, as I usually knock the 3rd and leave em and hunt the 4th, knock em, and hook them both.
---
Love that Doctor doesn't need Deerstalker with his ability since they scream on the ground.
---
I havent played since the reset so I was at 15 and now I'm at 9. I usually dont get passed purple ranks. I'm not saying ghostface is op but he certainly isnt weak. And I just say mainings the issue because someone new will come and only play one side and eventually it can create a bias.
---
What is M1? I‚Äôve only had the game for about a month. Any counter advice would be much appreciated. My teammates and I are getting owned pretty much every match against him. The other killers I have much better success against.
---
You wanna swf or what?
---
Thank you!
---
This is 10000% better than my drawings. Good work. Hag is scary as hell.
---
Wah, yay!
---
How could I have not thought of this, youre a genius
---
I don‚Äôt use either atm but I would pick sprint burst until dedicated servers go live. Dead Hard is basically a 50/50 as it stands
---
Hhhh, the doctor outfits (including this one, I especially love the suit-ish ones, and the ones with the vests) are so good, but I don't know how to play Doctor.

---
Funny how killer mains expect Wake Up to get fixed despite being discovered less than a week ago but it took bhvr months to fix legion's blade addons and you didn't complain.
---
Your post isn't getting downvoted tho? Why you lying?
---
Wait if she has no skin does that make her all muscle?
---
Funny how legion blades didn't make the game end in 2 minutes.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong though I don‚Äôt think he is a bad killer at all.  I just don‚Äôt think he is OP.  Like Myers can stalk anyone and get anyone instadown for 60 seconds.  
---
I‚Äôve outran Ghostfaces timer a few times,  or at least ran long enough to consider it a useful chase (gens dome, Ruin popping, ect)
---
Maybe have the hood a bitbinwards

Utilizing [A Command], your pooch will distract the killer twice a match (cooldown 180 seconds) when you are injured.
---
I don't know, this sound OK?
---
Are they custom made or is there somewhere to download them from the community?
---
Wow I need to read the lore after this brb
---
I use Small Game for the sole purpose that I am ass at ruin skill checks, so I decide I should at least find totems more efficiently for the team, I‚Äôve cucked many killers out of NOED lmao
---
Now that you‚Äôve said that the good looks #massive
---
Heard of the Streisend effect? If they address the glitch it's just gonna increase the amount of people that abuse it cause more will know about it.
---
Yeah, this one's really nice. I have the purple tie suit with the gold chain for my Doctor and I just love it.
---
Wraith killed a loooot of people.  He just didn‚Äôt know it at the time
---
Haha, I like it.
---
They also could have disabled legion's blade addons but they didn't.
---
Tough shit.
---
Meta perk trash too. So much sweat they've run out of dry towelettes.
---
That's because she is a ghost and has a sword with the power of phase walking. The legion literally just run after you. I would like to see Susie take on an actual team of four shirtless Davids. The legion also have the least character since there's four of them sharing three paragraphs that only really talk about Frank. Julie kind of has some character development and they mentioned Susie. Joey literally has no story and is only mentioned once by name.
---
They made the game last for eternity. That's even worse.
---
Art is a form of communication,  and if this is how they want to communicate then let them. They're not making money off this and they simply wanted to share it with people. If any "regular" artist is getting pissy over not getting more attention over someone else then maybe they should reevaluate their career. My best friend is an amazing artist and I have never once seen her put down another person for putting out something she felt like was a copy or wasn't up to par with the artwork she produces. Her main focus has always been doing what makes her happy and improving her art everyday. Even when all I could do was "copy" or make abstract art she went out of her way to be positive and supportive and it was the only reason I even got better. So I get a upset when I see pretentious artists going out of their way to put down other people because they're idea of art doesn't coincide with what someone else did. Besides, in the long run having an A+ higher education entrance qualification in art doesn't make you a successful artists nor does it give you the right to beat down on others. This art might not be original, but there is a lot of artwork out there that isn't and as long as it isn't hurting anyone it shouldn't matter. Just don't even bother saying anything if you can't be supportive of someone else's efforts, especially when they're doing it for fun.

Gay ass adam
---
Same happened to me, also ghostface. I was so mad..
---
This happened to me yesterday. I was at rank 6 and didn‚Äôt bring any meta perks and didn‚Äôt use any OP add-ons.  I also used an anniversary cake. I didn‚Äôt tunnel or camp, and I made sure to not hook the same person back to back. I ended up with 2 hooks on everyone without any kills. Then I got t-bagged and flamed for it. I just don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so fun about being toxic to someone who‚Äôs been nice to you. It‚Äôs also funny how sometimes when I let a survivor live they then go on to state how big a noob I was, saying I tunneled/camped, gg ez, etc. I also got a survivor match today where we had two afkers and he camped the one other person not afking. It took him about 4 minutes to down me but then he started t-bagging me (ghostface) whole nodding his head up and down as if he achieved something great. He also camped me which was funny because the only two other people in the game were afk the whole game. I got called toxic and a noob by him... This community is so toxic and I don‚Äôt understand why, what‚Äôs so fun about being mean?
---

I was watching this happen live. It was definitely a sight to behold.

Right so cute !!

For real need that hair !!
---
Oh I don't really even play much surv lol. I'm a killer main mostly. Nor do I use wake up. I'm just saying, most don't care
---
Poor dwight i legitimately feel bad for him
---
Yes I know that I was just saying they could say that you will be permanently banned if you use which will discourage everyone to not use it
---
Technically yes because you know it's bugged yet you are still using and it ruins the game for the killer kinda
---
I swear some survivors will argue that Doctor is better than Nurse lol
---
Nice tits
---
Yes
---
That's not being a murderer... That's just being wrong.
---
Because it was in Tony Hawk's American Wasteland 
---
So many memories
---
Its exploiting and yes you should be banned. You know its bugged and are willingly using it. Its the same with the legion bug, if you were using it and knew about the bug you deserved to be banned.
---
Never get wraith, clown,and hag
---
No
---
That‚Äôs assisting death there
---
I mean technically there are some bugs/nerfs that should have already gone into effect but missed the patch deadline, but he's not OP in any way. Definitely susceptible to getting looped just like most other killers
---
Really nice keep up the good work i hope it gets into the game
---
ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
The design is pretty sweet imo and I like it a lot but it doesn't come across as the nurse to me
---
Omg I love it! üíö
---
The issue for me is that I usually also use prove thyself and vigil, because like I said, I do a lot of SWF. I. D.o.n.t want to abuse it, so because of that fact I‚Äôm not running prove thyself for the time being. The legit wake up perk is something that is powerful to me, regardless of the bug
---
He has the same speed as trapper, which is basically highest natural speed. What you on about?
---
Platform: Xbox One (possibly others)
---
Freddy, stealth ghost face, and invisible wraith do not displace corn stocks on the farm maps or move grass where they are walking

Yeah... I made the design quickly today. It was better in my head before drawing it, but I didn‚Äôt have the time for a new design. Thanks though.

sorry for A dumb question but where can you find the lore?

Ghostface is only powerful when people playing against him have no idea what to do. He's worthless in red ranks.
---
Good thing there's something as freedom of speech, so I and everyone else, including you, might say whatever we want. And if someones asking why the 'artist' isn't calling it 'my trace/copy/own interpretation/blah.." then it's fine. As you can see, people agree with this statement. That's critique, not a dick move. A dick move would be me insulting the person who posted this.
---
Also vaulting
---
I only started yesterday, but LAAAAAAWWWWWDDD it felt so good to survive a match after losing so many to him.   
---
Had to use a hatch though. So it's bittersweet.
---
I disagree. I. D.o.n.t think I should be banned. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hacking or something. It‚Äôs a bug, so it should be fixed. It shouldn‚Äôt be my problem if a perk that I regularly use is a shitshow currently
---
Noice
---
I main killer cuz I can't play survivor
---
I dont understand how anyone in their right mind can look at this and say ghostface needs a nerf what the fuck is wrong with the devs
---
The character bios in game
---
Doctor haven‚Äôt even seen him during the event.
---
What kind of purple/red ranks use Urban Evasion? üòë frikken baby survivors
---
This is what Sasuke saw before his whole clan where massacred üòÇ
---
oh that went completely forgot about that. thanks!
---
Ew someone complaining about NOED still, downvoted
---
I bet everyone can tell that it is that hag. Some people have such skill
---
Press "character info", to the right of the screen when you choose a character. Also wiki.
---
[If you click here, you can see to the right of the screen: \[F1\] Character Info.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/789733306585908018/8EE2AB3FC40DF12EA78C6CD46F3CBEFAAB4B46CE/)
---
They're balancing for rank 20s who don't know how to play against him. He hasn't been out long enough to warrant a nerf, and the players who know how to play the game realize how mid tier he truly is.
---
Honestly Susie and Joey pretty much got the same amount of development.
---
Susie is shy and naive.
---
Joey is eager to impress and impulsive.
---
Joey attacked without any hesitation once told.
---
Susie refuse to do it then had to be forced.
---
That pretty much sums of the backstory for those two.
---
Aside from some miscellaneous details like Susie being Julie's best friend and Joey having a car and being an ex-employee of the place where the guy got killed.
---
Honestly I'm really looking forward to the archives because I really want to know more about each Legion member
---
The issue is two-fold. On one hand they are terrified of adding good perks, clearly because they don't want another repeat of Freddy. On the other hand some of the older perks are relics of a past era and reflect the balance of those times. The prime perk to point to would be Adrenaline since it features two bits of balance that have since been reworked. (Instaheals and mid-chase Sprint Burst.) The perk is run so much because playing version 2.3 in version 3.0 is insanely strong.
---
Platform: Xbox one
---
Killer: Ghostface
---
Bug: gameplay, maybe audio
---
Spotting for Ghostface is very inconsistent. I have spotted him from across the map while not even seeing him myself. I have also had times where I can't spot him when he's on the other side of a pallet or very short distances, I do get exposed during these times too so he was in stealth. 
---
Could just be an issue with the audio que but I can't say forsure
---
I was salty from my first match with him
---
More specifically, dedicated servers release in August. Hang in there br√∂ther
---
Dear god this is gross. Their names too, what jerks.
---
my daddy insticts say Myers
---
Kate Denson
---
I used to run small game and it‚Äôs great when your with swf and everyone else stays on gens, but there is no point when playing solo cause everyone else is gonna hop off there gens and go looking. So I stopped running it cause I might as well be the one dude doing gens.
---
If you're in an enclosed area, there is 100% always a nearby window or pallet. If you are not in an enclosed area, then you can see the killer from a mile away. Plus both chainsaw guys are significantly easier to hear with the running chainsaw sounds.
---
that was me, nea was pointing and squatting  at me and all i was thinking is ‚ÄúJesus, help me with the gen!‚Äù then i get exposed and ista downed. I kinda got the message late nea :(
---
Mtf janette
---
I knock them and wait for bleedout. It allows survivors to heal them and gets them out of the game without giving them that big of a disadvantage if they return
---
Yeah, no. I‚Äôd recommend research instead of thinking things
---
there probably gonna start banning people for it so i wouldnt use it.
---
What? How world that work?
---
More like Jeff Romero IMO
---
Double yes
---
PSA it as a ban. They could tell who was using legions bug they can tell who is using wake up
---
Behind the houses in haddonfield, blocked on one side by trees and a house right in front of you.
---
I played against a camping GF today (quite amusing), and annoying one of the survivors on hook decided to give up, which gave us less time to do gens and get caught.
---
Maybe we should incorporate an unspoken rule of if you're camping, stall as long as possible, and accept your fate.
---
I swear hitting a ruin great skill check is easier than a non ruin great skill check lol
---
S H I R T L E S S 
---
D A V I D
---
only the characters that he killed in that prequel that I have seen, so like 2-3 people also I think Leatherface came out in DBD before the movie so I don't think it counts anyway
---
Behind the houses in haddonfield, blocked on one side by trees and a house right in front of you. Also in the downstairs the gen is in the room with 2 doors half the time. No avoiding the hit there. Plenty of anecdotal examples
---
Gen gets progressed and someone gets a WLF stack. Win?
---
just look at the killer profiles in the game or go to the wiki
---
In OP‚Äôs defense there was ALOT wrong with legion. Not just the two blades add ons. He needed a complete rework which they did in the short amount of time. Wake up is one perk. They disabled a perk in the shrine a couple weeks ago, they could easily disable this. Good job not giving them points. I wouldn‚Äôt be that upset over it. It is bhvr that we are talking about.....
---
But she bloo
---
Yo where did you get those sick icons
---
Congrats and welcome
---
Kate.
---
Do you condone camping? will be my only question then
---
Alright then, what‚Äôs so unbalanced about the game?
---
Small brain BHVR be like "Fuck we broke something again. DON'T USE IT OR WE'LL SHOOT YOU."
---
I don't know if it's just a thing on Xbox but clowns are practically non-existent
---
Well, you are going with only 3 perks and no add-ons, that's very much on you.
---
Camping ? It seems u have a good impression of me
---
They would probably hear your wishy wooshy stalky sound before then (why so *loouud?!*)
---
Spirit
---
Dwight
---
That doesn't answer my question.  
---
I wasn't saying you camped if that's what you somehow managed to read.  
---
I asked if you condone camping.
---
Clown
---
No I do they‚Äôre 5 feet behind me with the bullshit hitbox
---
After reviewing TOS, I‚Äôm taking it off temporarily but am not happy about it. Thanks for the help even though it started off as a witch hunt.
---
Kate or meg for females.
---
Jake or David for males.
---
For killers non masked- 
---
Females- the spirit or the plague.
---
Males- wraith or Freddy.
---
No, they cry that he's "not fun to play against."  
---
  
---
Because being looped is my thought of a fun time, running in a circle like an old timey cartoon...
---
Woah, how much is the increase? Does it stack if more survivors are running it?
---
Hitbox is bullshit
---
So like any company has a small brain?
---
I think DbD is bugged more than other games but their ToS is like any other
---
In any other online game if you abuse a bug knowing it gives you advantage you get punished.. it's not something only BHVR does, just saying if you never played any other online game before
---
Ghostface for killers because in drivers license add-on he seems like a fairly attractive dude and his personality besides being a little stabby seems pretty fun to be around and for survivors I'd say Kate Because well I mean it's pretty obvious.
---
Interesting, I'd love to hear your argument as to why
---
Its not even hit box related lol. Its the middle of the screen. Its stupid, not to mention WE have a range to snap him out of it, but he has a longer range to stalk.
---
Survivors-
---
Female: Kate
---
Male: Ace
---
Killers Non Mask
---
Female: Piggie
---
Male: Trapper
---
Ghost Face ;)
---
Do you think the entity and the master hand would get along well? Their realms serve a similar purpose, even if they‚Äôre executed differently
---
Yes, camping is dumb and there's no advantage out of it, although I dont know whats the point of the question. Is it because u think slugging is not okay ?
---
üò¨
---
Tru3 was able to cut every loop off early by juking the Survivors, he completely outplayed them all. They still got away because they have crutch perk after crutch perk :p
---
Maybe because it takes time to fix things and your just being inpatient for no reason. They can't just magically fix a bug in less then a day buddy
---
What does 03 mean? I‚Äôm not familiar with the term.
---
Mcote
---
Thanks dude :)
---
30% and no.
---
After releasing a PSA like they did when legions knife addons were bugged nobody can say they didnt know
---
If noed rewards the killers for playing bad
---
Then old MoM rewarded survivors for playing bad
---
It's very cool, thanks for sharing :)
---
Checking to see how far your BM'ing goes.  
---
Idc about slugging, at least slugging can be pretty easily helped against (unless the killer camps the slugged person aswell which is odd, but happens).  
---
What i don't condone is the teabagging, even if survivors have teabagged against you before, why teabag? It's so unnecessary and just keeps spreading the toxicity.
---
Do people just think they can magically fix all the bugs in 3 days? Jesus xhiret your so stupid. It takes time to fix bugs especially when it can make even more by fixing one.
---
Kate
---
Why are the annoying characters from Canada?
---
Said it before, ill say it again, doge posts belong in this sub.
---
Do you know how hard coding is? If you do then go ahead and fix it for them my man, because I can tell you it takes way more then 3 days to fix it
---
It's good if used correctly, like to disappear behind stuff mid chase
---
MY MIND IS GOING FASTER EVERY DAYYY
---
Clown 1000000%
---
Hello
---
Was this PC or console?
---
Lol. The post is meant to be commentary on survivor toxicity and hypocrisy, yet people seem to be overly focused on the killer's toxicity.
---
1. The teabags, and while uneccessary, is just dishing back to survivors what they do to killers. Teabagging is all fun and games to survivors it seems until the killer can do it back, then all of a sudden it's toxic. 
---
2. The slugging is questionable as hell, but OP makes it clear in a reply on this post that they were slugging because they had the attention of multiple potential rescuers.
---
3. Three man games can't happen on patch 3.0.0. BHVR made sure of at least that on their buggy ass game. So the 4th survivor either DC'd in game, or suicided. Neither of which is the killer's fault, nor does it place a responsibility on the killer to be nicer to anyone else.
---
Make no mistake, I don't appreciate toxicity, but there is a point trying to be made here, as evidenced by the title. My commenting doesn't make me a baby killer main, or a killer main of any kind, just someone who feels like this post is getting undeserved hate when explanations for OP's actions are in the comment thread. By the by, there's a reply here that says OP claims to play like this normally. So unless they've always been able to teabag on killer, I'm gonna have to call bs on that one.
---
Xbox 
---
I can't use dead hard, wiggle or heal in some games
---
No mither?
---
Does this apply to both blade add-ons? I main legion and i always use a blade add on, but are both affected, meaning if i use one then the action speed is still slowed? or can i use one or the other just fine without being worried about a ban?
---
Of course not. Its a survivor perk bug. If it was a killer bug then yes, you will be punished.
---
Well a big Issue is balance between survivors and the killer. A team of SWF survivors can easily crush all killers. With voice chat allowing for much more coordination killers can‚Äôt keep up with a team of flashlight toolbox survivors that know where he is at all times. Plus quite a bit of RNG with totem and pallet placements
---
how? mine has the same probelm
---
And that's why premonition is awesome! (Except against Myers)
---
Is there a chance that you can share the link for that PSA? I‚Äôm not familiar with that as I took a break from the game around legions release
---
Ghost face does need a nerf though, hes ridiculous. I've seen rank 20 killers with 1 perk troll rank 8 survivors and get a 4 bagger with eaze.
---
He's getting some small adjustments in a hotfix but no hard nerfs yet. Some people are complaining though and it's making people worried that more nerfs will come.
---
He has add ons for how close you have to be to reveal him, just a heads up.
---
Your just sad and really bad and probably salty if you think it's balanced at all.
---
Noed is not as op as you all say, you can just get rid of the totems or you know.. Leave when the gates are open
---
By accident, yea.
---
Still kinda her fault for telling everyone not to seek medical attention
---
I usually just break the pallet and kill their teammates. If their teammates end up in the basement, I camp it. The teabagger loses points based on altruism by not getting saves and get less boldness points by not getting chased. When the others flame me in chat because I camped them, I tell them that if they want to ruin my experience, I'll ruin it for everyone else.
---
Achshually, Plague has about 50 million kills.
---
You are cheating by knowingly equipping a bigger perk that gives you a crazy bonus never part of the perk before.  Choosing to still run it is about as scummy as it gets.  You're no different than the infinite mend legions.
---
well its bad design, because survivors can still absolutely do that, they can just not complete the last gen
---
NOED doesn't neccessarily reward killers for playing bad, they can play really well all game but since the favor is tipped so far towards the Survivors, it may make no difference. Besides either way you look at it, that's one perk. Survivors still have too many perks that can give them second chances.
---
And then the killer can kill them all lmao
---
so far from what ive seen on streams and such, yes they are bugged. it should be noted though that they announced when bugs were bannable, like the double blades last time. This will be in the news tab at the bottom of the menu or the DBD twitter.
---
Ah, if only europeans knew they should've just seeked medical attention during the black death, then maybe everyone could've been fine \*shrug\*
---
Oh good speard the info about the bug more, let more exploits happen to make the game unfun. Very nice.
---
yeah I replaced my self care with adrenaline, but still, it is technically the same amount of time
---
If you got 4 hooks, it‚Äôs always a win.
---
wow thanks for totally answering my question
---
Same
---
Freddy, Pig, Wraith, Clown, and Hag.
---
I have absolutely no problem with detecting ghostfaces all day playing survivor, so idk whats the problem
---
im really new to dbd. i love ghost face and i bought him . never played dbd before and had some ok matches for my first matches with him. 2 of the 4 i hooked and got sacrificed and got hate messages saying i was "playing pay to win" and should delete. i use ghostface cause hes my fave movie slasher. is he really that bad alreay??
---
Yes. So, she‚Äôs switched to a victim to play.
---
thats never been proven
---
Yeah cuz is a shitty perk due to totem positions
---
A visual bug isn't comparable to a game breaking bug tbh
---
***BUT THEN YOU HAVE ADRENALINE AND A PURPLE KEY***
---
The plauge doctors didn‚Äôt bother with her nonsense
---
Wake Up could be in like, four thousand peoples loadouts and they don't even know it could be bugged. It's not even hard to use the bug, you just literally have to just ... have it equipped. Even accidentally.
---
This is the durpiest reason to start banning people from your own mess.
---
Console: Xbox One
---
Issue: result screen and main menu taking long periods of time to load
---
Ever since the event update, after dying or spectating or just switching between the main menu options, the game freezes for about 15 seconds every time. Need serious optimization fixes. This should not be struggling to load
---
We also have their mixtapes/cosmetics that give us a bit more character, along with their individual animations/body movements in the lobby. 
---
But yea I hella agree, I really hope they expand upon each Legion member (especially Joey because god I love him)
---
My thing is, anytime I would want to play a mobile game I don't exactly have internet. So it's kinda a wasyw for me
---
You're a hooker!
---
I can agree with this. Try to remove toxicity on both sidesn
---
I‚Äôm a Canadian too! :) this is why I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt that much Canadian characters. It doesn‚Äôt change anything, but I think it is surprising!
---
Im still holding out for jason
---
How? How are you consistently getting 3 protection hits? Either you have an amazing method for doing so, or you're full of shit.
---
you're probably right, but its still disappointing to see these nerfs with no buffs, no one cares about the killer instinct, that's not going to help ghostface win games. they should really buff his stealth, the wind noise he makes is really absurd, its incredibly loud, with a huge radius, and the worst part is that its directional, you can pinpoint where he is without seeing him while playing survivor
---
I alt-f4‚Äôd a game out of rage because ghost face was standing at the other side of a pallet in clear view and it wouldn‚Äôt trigger the detection and he exposed and downed me, even after I wiggled the camera and shifted around a little to try trigger the detection.
---
It‚Äôs really inconsistent for me so far.
---
Its called empathy.
---
honestly if there was an option to turn off chase music id turn it off
---
To be fair, you were against completely shit suviviors.
---
If a nurse misses her blinks she becomes the worst killer in the game.
---
You guys had this coming, still do. Even to this day every survivor that gets the chance waits on the exit gates til the last possible second waiting to get one last teabag in XD endgame collapse wouldn't be a thing if you guys didn't spend the last couple years forcing it into the game :)
---
I don‚Äôt care if I only get one kill, I‚Äôm just happy I got one.
---
Bro that would be so broken üò±
---
Just get bbq in the shrine
---
They should grey out a perk if its problematic. They did that with the shrine a month ago. With or without the bug nobody every runs the perk, it can‚Äôt even be compared to the legion bug tbh
---
‚ÄúI am speed‚Äù
---
I wish they would disable things that they will ban people for using. They didn't disable legions blade add ons, and honestly I don't know why they didn't. Questionable decision making.
---
You actually just have to wait (quite a while). I think maybe the games trying to fetch a batch of survivors to throw in before the lobby is made, but I honestly have no real clue why it's taking so long.
---
I know! We aren‚Äôt as prominent as Americans in video games, so seeing some representation always makes me happy, even if it‚Äôs a bunch of psycho murderers
---
I'm pretty sure the disconnect button achieves that
---
how would that be too strong? detection perks arent exactly the survivor meta, and it takes up an entire perk slot just to MAYBE counteract some survivor perks, we already have killer perks and powers that completely hard counter survivors perks and items, so why not that? most killers have their terror radius anyways.
---
I agree with OP that it should be removed, but the aggressiveness and childishness of his comments in the post  could be done without.
---
This is the kind of attitude that ruins this community. No one ‚Äúasked for this‚Äù, survivors are just as cancerous as killers and vice versa. I don‚Äôt get this whole high and mighty nonsense. I see the killer be cancerous just as much as survives. Try to improve the community please.
---
How did it get nerfed?
---
David
---
lmao probably
---
15%. It's really bad, why I stopped playing until a patch
---
Except the disconnect buttons makes you lose your hard earned points.
---
Hnnnnggggghhhhh this is amazing!!!
---
I would honestly just DC to fuck over the suviviors a bit
---
So you're just running around taking protection hits instead of doing gens? That's assuming you're anywhere near the injured survivor.
---
**BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN???**
---
Plague is making people's games crash
---
ugh...rank 12-9 is awful. 
---
80% of the killers use ruin but no survivors know how to do gens(and how to find the totem). In other words I do 2 gens...and the other ones are dying like flies.
---
That is a true statement
---
Oh Lord..
---
Let's recap since the small brain isn't BHVR in this case
---
1i just stated that is against ToS and it's bannable
---
2 they won't ban before clarify it like they did to legion to not punishing innocent users
---
3 isn't derpy since it's in the ToS and they don't have to state that, they do it because they are a serious company
---
4 being hard or easy to use isn't an excuse. Still, they won't ban randomly. They will state it officially then ban whoever keep abusing it
---
If I was them I would actually ban anyone who uses it knowingly, by knowingly I mean whoever defend and think it's fine to use it saying it publicly, like this sub Reddit. I've seen way too many posts where people wanna actually abuse it and think it's fine endorse it and encourage it. They deserve an insta perma ban
---
Many other games disable or advice people to not use a certain thing before taking action regardless how easy it is. If you think it's stupid call a lawyer then come back and tell me what he/she say
---
My friend and I suffered from the exact same bug in one game. The game went the extra mile and didn‚Äôt allow us to escape, as when we ran across the exit line, we were still in the game and able to move, and died from the collapse as a result.
---
So what do you expect them to do? Make it a single player game? And there‚Äôs perks for flashlights if it‚Äôs really that hard to look up or look for other survivors with it before picking them up
---
Female survivors: Jane and Kate
---
Male survivors: Adam and David
---
Female killers: Amanda and Rin
---
Male killers: Evan and Philip
---
Sprint Burst generally has a stronger base effect. But dead hard supports a much more aggressive playstyle.
---
If you find yourself wanting to reposition yourself, and playing stealthy, Sprint Burst is your best bet.
---
However, If you find yourself playing more aggressive and playing around the killer and taking risks, I think Dead Hard would be a better option.
---
I think Lithe can also be a good mix between the two.
---
Both perks can be your saving grace, so it all depends on your playstyle.
---
Well if you have a brain its not so hard. If they are near then I will take a hit, I unhook, ill take a hit. Its really not that hard.
---
So they complain about that when wake up is worse ok
---
until the devs say you will be banned for using it you wont be banned just like with wake up being bugged but ya it is broken
---
It happened in game ? I‚Äôm surprised I. D.o.n.t remember that because I was fairly active following plagues release. Now did they only ban people that used the x2 blade combo ( did a tiny bit of research on it) following the statement? Or did they ban anybody who used it during its bug era
---
All the comments mention the hatch but all I see are the two large parallel tires
---
I had this problem on console too and I think it just has too do with consoles limited optimization of Dbd
---
This comment section makes me thankful im not a dev for this game.
---
The ability would allow you to keep your points and end the game rather than have to sit there and wait.
---
Yee.
---
BHVR finally did the so requested buff to killers that make survivors spawn on the hook already.
---
I thought it was supposed to look like that, I didn't actually know that it was ACTUALLY black! I hope that this gets changed.
---
Or Jake: so chill you don't even notice how chill they are.
---
Killers asked for it for years while games were held hostage by survivors who wouldn't leave the game. Now the game ends no matter what, sometimes you have to wait on the ground, it's not a big deal. At least it will end. Also there is no use trying to "improve the community" :p it's just a game, and one that has people competing against eachother. As long as those things are true, it's gonna stay this way. Look how much shit talking is in sports, or other things with people competing. let it be and enjoy or don't:)
---
Entity: I know  what rank you should really be at
---
How braindead are you?
---
Except the game doesn‚Äôt end no matter what. Unless the killer closes the hatch or opens a door you wait to bleed out. It‚Äôs not good gameplay, and it doesn‚Äôt add to the game. In the same way that adding the end game was a good move, this is too.
---
Particles
---
Np. Love helping new players. Feel free to holler if you have any other questions :)
---
How would this remove toxicity? It would just breed a new kind. Survivors while slugged could then just hide and give up, slugging is almost necessary sometimes, especially at end game. One survivor could give up while the other is being carried to the hook and deny the killer of points.
---
all i see is the huntress from DBD
---
so meaning combining them causes the bug, or each one alone does?
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
[removed]
---
so does that mean combining both creates the bug, or just using at least one will make the bug happen?
---
Swf?
---
if I see a quentin in my lobby, im bringing a green mori for him, if I see more than one, Ebony mori time.
---
that I do not know prob they both do but it is longer with both
---
It's simple honestly. Address the issue with a news saying they'll get banned if they used it after they said so, like they did for legion
---
Not a big deal, since probably they cannot disable the perk (due to console licenses problems etc) or they would've done it.
---
It's pretty easy release a news which I don't think require a patch for it. Just inform and take notes for who's using wake up after the announcement
---
(They can track what you're using when you're using it, proof: Datas showed in previous q&amp;a streams)
---
I know, and I totally get that. I‚Äôm just glad I know how to counter him better.
---
Even if it could only be triggered while you're the last survivor and had like a 25 second charge time
---
Now maybe people will run WGLF. I am good with the changes. It doesn‚Äôt need to be super meta
---
No it‚Äôs on both pc and console. Servers aren‚Äôt dedicated servers so they‚Äôve been working on it.
---
You happen to remember where it was mentioned? Just curious of their urgency. Like I said before, I am surprised they haven‚Äôt started working towards something that has been requested so much.
---
that was his fetal stage, silly
---
Shes cute I guess.   Lisa is better though.
---
I really like this. looks cool.
---
shadowborn doesnt even let you see in the dark better anymore
---
Which is exactly my point.
---
But why is it toxic? There‚Äôs no reason for it being toxic, I‚Äôm just spamming control, if the (insert side here) gets upset it‚Äôs because they are easily upset and triggered.
---
Bruh can I go to your birthday party too? I get no cakes, only party starters lol
---
You gotta time the blind so that the killer can move/look at the same moment the blind happens.
---
But it‚Äôs their choice to play those perks.If you want to play against different perks then don‚Äôt insult the player but instead give your feedback to the devs instead.
---
New killer: Howard the alien
---
Your timing is probably off. You have to time the blind just as the killer regains their movement. Any sooner and they'll be blind but still holding the survivor, any later and they'll have a chance to look away.
---
lol, of course
---
Without a doubt this guy deserved it.
---
they should buff predator, make it so that it doesn't change the stratch marks at all, but it also adds little glowing footsteps on the ground so you know exactly where they were running
---
Worst attitude right here. Rather than try to encourage a more engaging and entertaining atmosphere it‚Äôs ‚Äúbut they have to be punished for the past!‚Äù It sucked it happened, but I‚Äôm trying to suggest ways to counter that exact thing your referring to in the same way BSG implemented the end game.
---
Just take hits while the Killer is carrying someone. It was changed to force Survivors to do something in order to activate the perk. You have to be altruistic in order to get some use out of it.
---
That's like saying flipping someone off isn't offensive/toxic either, it's just having one finger stretched out.  
---
Teabagging is just the game version of flipping someone off.
---
The first of many I'm sure. üòÅ
---
How ain't u getting cakes ho
---
Lol, good one
---
I imagine Spirit became a full-on vengeful spirit that haunted her house after dying, probably did kill her dad and anyone else who showed up.
---
I also imagine an alternate world where the Legion stuck around and became serial killers.
---
damn must be
---
Welp. Being in their ToS doesn't make it less stupid. Suicide is against the law in some countries, but that doesn't make THAT not-stupid.
---
To address every other point, I would like you to develop this for me:
---
You put out a public statement that says: "We fucked up guys. This thing is bugged. Don't use it, or we'll ban you."
---
So how do you filter these people: The people that are out of the loop, the people that just had the perk equipped before the announcement, new people who just got into the game after the announcement.
---
How do you filter those people SEPERATELY from the people that are knowingly abusing the bug? And more importantly, how do you justify punishing them for the mistakes you yourselves keep making over and over and over?
---
[link to a roadmap ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/comicbook.com/gaming/amp/2019/06/02/dead-by-daylight-roadmap-chapters-new-features/)
---
Yeah must be that forgot about that
---
Wouldn't it have been more straightforward to mention ancient Babylonians? Lol.
---
3 man games cancel during load so all this says is someone dc‚Äôed or suicided first hook. As a killer why should I care?
---
I don‚Äôt know maybe they don‚Äôt want me to get blood points
---
So by the next chapter im guessing
---
Lol, Rin did nothing but get killed.üòÇ
---
That's the most important time for a game, especially to a survivor. If a survivor wins they made it to end game, if a killer does, he probably didn't ;)
---
My man üëåüëåüëå
---
Ah, I thought you meant no terror radius plus immunity to detection perks. I don't know, survivors equivalent to that is Distortion, which is borderline useless because it is limited to 3 times.
---
Am i the only person who is liking not being able to hear chase music? I‚Äôm so aware of everything going on around me now.
---
How sure are you of that? Not that I‚Äôm trying to push my luck
---
Idk if they actually had the plauge and didn't bother look it up, so I was referencing a similiar event.
---
But he has counter play now.....
---
kinda funny that Legion got a glitch that literally cancels out the Wake Up glitch. So theoretically if Legion stabs someone with Wake Up with double blades it all balances out.
---
It's difficult. I still have never been able to do it. It's the same for pallet saves too. You gotta make sure the killer is able to move and look freely when you do it. But you gotta time it so the blind happens literally right as the killer regains control.
---
So it's the dev's fault that people care so much about winning to achieve a rank that rewards nothing, that rather than run builds that subvert expectations and fun or different? What's the dev going to do besides nerf them and incur the wrath of survivor mains? Meta is boring. Try having fun.
---
Just play a lot, watching streams or yt videos can also help a bit
---
Nobody said anything about endgame camping (really, what else are killers supposed to do though, just let the survivor get unhooked and go out the door?) or "just cause". 
---
And no, I don't. That is why the EGC was implemented. The reason it was implemented was because survivors just wouldn't GTFO and wouldn't leave for quite a while. At least with the EGC, there's a max of four minutes (IIRC) before someone bleeds out, dies, and the game ends. Like I said, be patient.
---
Damn, I'm getting 1-2 per bloodweb
---
Boo
---
Lucky what about flashlights tho?
---
Seems very possible
---
I've done it multiple times lol it's possible and great
---
Really they just need to make knocking out lf stalk more consistent and let the stalk meter slowly decay if you lose him for long enough
---
I was here - it was a lot of people laughing at how McCote said "we like to break them game, make them so powerful when we release a new killer" and we were all fucken bullying the doctor cause he was bad(?) at release or something lol
---
Killer main bye
---
I knocked a ghost face out of his power and for the rest of the game every time he found me he would just stare, never even stalked.
---
Ok bye
---
That's it. We're getting a Mountie serial killer.

The backstory hints at Philip realizing that the guy in the trunk wasn‚Äôt the first person ever in a trunk of a car he crushed, so it wasn‚Äôt just blind rage, it was a horrible realization that he had been the one to kill many people without even knowing. None of the rest of his backstory indicates that he was a violent or cruel person, just a dude working a job in a country he thought he could have a chance at a Dream in. I would say it‚Äôs reasonable to say the guilt he felt at the reality settling was a breaking moment for him. Plus, if you remember, Azarov was kind of subtly characterized as a man with a lot of influence and power, and he could have easily blamed Philip (who is a foreigner) and no one would have questioned him. It seemed like a moment similar to a cornered, hurt animal. What else could he have done?
---
Quentins Creed
---
I guess you were its face
---
I think most people would. Especially in that Community XD
---
How could they taunt you if you DC‚Äôd?
---
And a hockey player survivor.
---
&gt; ~~That‚Äôs assisting~~ Chaperoned death there
---
There, a bit more eloquent I think.
---
Meanwhile killers "We killed MoM, Sprint Burst, Pallet Spawns, Flashlights." Some of these were needed but dont act like you guys dont complain often.
---
I guarantee you they're working on it. People just need to calm down.
---
That's what I do. When I get encamped I buy as much time as possible. If I know the killers going to turn on me I'll put up a long Chase. If the killers camping me and the gates are open I'll just kill myself so my teammates don't die for me. A lot of people say Ghostface would be the new Michael or Pig... Some people say he's the new Freddy. Personally I think he's the new Leatherface
---
Safe unhooks was altruistic but they removed it. Now it's somehow worse then decisive strike.
---
Bone, mud, and blood.
---
How else can survivors survive? It's either gen rushing or looping, or both.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre trying to say in the first half.
---
And what if the don‚Äôt activate the EG? If your only argument is that killers suffered in the past, you don‚Äôt have an argument. 
---
There is literally no downsides to this. It gives the killer plenty of heads up, a change to carry to hook and get their kill that they deserve, and if they would rather be cancerous, it gives the survivor a way out of sitting around for no reason for 4 minutes. It‚Äôs literally a win win. It simply encourages people to play the game. It‚Äôs that simple.
---
I reccomend Tru3talent. He is a bit callous but tells it like it is.
---
Ill start from the beggining.
---
Ghost face is revealed as a Killer whose power is to reduce his terror radius to 0 and remove his redglow, with the ability to stalk survivors for 4s to give exposed to them.
---
Week 1 PTB: Ghost face is broken in a bad way. He is revealed from stalk instantly once a survivor has him in their camera, making spinning the camera completely nullify his power. He also has issues with stalking survivors. *He is the worst killer in the game at this point.*
---
Week 2 PTB: Ghostface is fixed so that survivors take 2s of looking at him in the center of their screen to reveal him. Tru3 remarks that he may be a viable killer, up there with Nurse,Spirit and Billy, But doesnt say definitely because the PTB doesn't have Skill based matchmaking due to it resetting ranks. *Ghostface might be good at this point.*
---
Ghostface release (3 days ago): Some survivors begin asking for a nerf to ghostface, citing issues with breaking him from stalk. I have experienced this issue a couple times, but not consistently. Tru3 has not experienced these issues and is upset because People are asking for nerfs, despite him only being out for a few days (or 1 week of unbroken play if you include PTB). Tru3 remarks that he is performing half decently against higher rank players (rank ~7) but needs more testing against red ranks (1-4) to be sure. Tru3 also remarks that he is frustrated at how quickly survivors are calling for nerfs. 
---
Ghostfaces place in meta: Unsure. Its only been a week or so.
---
Currently Ghostface is honestly a bit buggy when it comes to detecting him. 
---
Ghostface's ability mostly works like this,
---
As soon as the match starts, Ghostface is literally like any other killer besides the ability to crouch. He has the red stain, normal terror radius, etc. 
---
When Ghostface right clicks, he enters stealth mode. He can do this whenever he wants when the match starts. Some might wait to get close, but when I play him I activate it right away so I'm "sneaky" from the beginning of the match. 
---
When he's in his "Stealth Mode" (Ingame referred to as Night Shroud) he has no terror radius, and no red stain (The red light). He seems to make weird flappy parachute noises when he's moving, he always makes them but they get MUCH more "obvious" sounding when he is in stealth mode.
---
Anyways in this stealth mode, Ghostface can now lean around corners and stalk, similar to Myers. Unlike Myers this stalking only effects the survivor. I.E. if he stalks survivor A and makes him exposed, survivors B and C won't be although I'm unsure if you can have multiple survivors exposed at the same time.
---
As soon as Ghostface attacks, he breaks out of stealth mode and has a pretty long cooldown before he can do it again.
---
If you look at him (he has to be in the center of your screen, you can do this when working, or even on the hook) you slowly reveal him. This seems to depend on distance and how much of Ghostface's body is visible. Devs said 20% of him has to be visible but in KYF testing it seems sort of inconsistent. I've had Ghostface hiding in corn and I couldn't reveal him unless I was literally right next to him, and I've had times where I accidently revealed him or heard the music without knowing where he is.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/69477/patch-notes-3-0-0-ghost-face
---
He's getting some changes next hotfix. They're enlarging the "Reveal zone" on your screen by 4% towards each side BECAUSE of complaints about revealing him, particularly in chases.
---
He won't be able to stalk people once they're exposed.
---
Basically when Ghostface stalks, similar to Myers, he can 99% people. In the PTB, pre-expose stalking progress would decay over time, which was changed to no longer decay (Which I like.). GF can for example stalk you to 99% exposure progress, (You get a white ring around your HUD icon that only ghostface can see) wait to get closer, and then pop the exposed effect on you just like Myers can.
---
The part being patched is, once you're exposed, Ghostface can currently keep stalking you to basically "Top off" your exposed timer. I.E. I expose you, you get the red ring counting down how long you're exposed for. During the chase, I can keep stalking you if you're exposed timer is getting low to re-fill it, hence why I referred to it as "Topping off" your exposed timer. (I.E. maybe you're good at looping, exposed it almost up, and I'm not revealed yet, I could stalk you for a bit to get some extra time to down you.) 
---
Re-stalking people already exposed is also being removed. Given you get 40 seconds or so of Exposed I agree that should go. 
---
One other change is pallet stunning him will kick him out of stealth mode which I agree should be a thing. Pallet stuns knock Plague out of corrupt purge, boot Legion out of Frenzy, etc. so having a stealthy killer counting as being caught once a pallet is dropped out on his face seems reasonable.
---
In terms of countering ghostface you could try Spine Chill or object of obsession. Like I said next hotfix will make his stealth a bit easier to boot him out of. 
---
I am not sure if distance effects how fast the revealing happens. I've had him revealed almost immediately and there were times where it took several seconds. I know he has some addons that make it harder to reveal him but I am not sure how effective they actually are given how "iffy" his revealing is.
---
That could be their version of ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Some people like different things and yes the devs can nerf perks and buff others to tighten the gap. You are also forgetting that rank 1 killers also run meta perks which is why survivors in the same rank feel the need to also run meta perks.
---
I don't think survivors need another chance to deny killers of perks, but that's just me :) if the give up option, summons the entity, and sacrifices them, and counts as a hook, like end game collapse, then I see no problem
---
Azarov always have me mafia vibes, so I imagine after his men found out they chased Philip down and nearly killed him (which would explain how inhuman he looks- his head tilted almost like something happened to his neck, but he also looks like he was dragged through the mud.....)
---
mew just can't be happy can you?
---
We‚Äôve been tricked, we‚Äôve been backstabbed, and quite possibly, bamboozled.

1000 IQ locker juke.
---
With rank reset, a lot of the new survivors on Xbox are probably being destroyed by green rank killers
---
I was enjoying this video and read the comments, but one small thing ruined this post for me
---
noed :/
---
Yeah but they managed to get a cosmetic for the pig. I‚Äôd love to see Quentin get some representation after having one of the worst received DLCs. No hate for Quentin btw as I main him
---
I measured all the Killer's kill counts awhile ago in this thread when Plague came out https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/axcuft/we_have_a_new_record_for_lowest_preentity_killer/
---
Wraith killed more if you count the guys on the car
---
Ah, i see your a man of culture aswell.
---
People that bitch about looping need to get a grip. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO SURVIVE. GET A GRIP.
---
Trademarks
---
Made my heart flutter
---
maybe a very good clown's car  
---
a very VERY good one, I mean
---
Who even complains about NOED anymore except toxic survivors?
---
As someone who likes ghostface as is, are you sure it was him that revealed you and not a different survivor? The whole thing needs a little tweaking, but I‚Äôve found the line-of-sight needed to expose him has been consistent.
---
I feel like walking up to the killer at the gate, crouching and releasing slowly as a sort of "bow", then walking NOT sprinting to the exit part of the exit gate shows the most respect.
---
Survivors bming a killer consist of tbagging the killer, flashlight clicking, anything at the exit gates aside from leaving, hateful chat messages after game or to some it's basically just trying to survive and being good  there is "bm" on both sides. Some actually are, some are just the opposing team being salty they lost or did not like how someone played although it was not bannable.
---
It's probably a wake up, new part and engineers toolbox with 2 people on each gen... it's there but they cant finish it so fast that you can stop it with a gen stall build.
---
Why?
---
So, I should read an inherently inaccurate means of communication instead of jist playing the game as it really should be? What a rosy sentiment~
---
What are you talking about? There was never anything wrong with the faces.
---
Ps4
---
UI completely gone during a game.  Couldn't see wtf i was doing
---
You point makes zero sense and does not even remotely relate to this. Not to mention that a survivor has the exact same luxury of choice that a killer has. A killer has no control over wether or not a survivor pallet drops, jumps a window, or mind game them. Works both ways. 
---
An umpteenth chance? It‚Äôs literally giving the killer a kill and ending the game? What are you even saying?
---
Oooh wait then when Freddy got his that means The Entity was involved?
---
What‚Äôs the change of mettle of man
---
I'd think the "passive ability" would be you being more altruistic towards your teammates, especially considering you're in a group of four people. Besides, killer perks are meant to be stronger than survivor perks. 
---
There's a bunch of risks to both perks too: the situations you stated for WGLF, and the fact that it's "brain dead" easy to counter BBQ+C. Just be close enough to the hook, stay behind a generator (if that's still a thing?) or literally just climb into a locker for a few seconds. The killer has no idea which of these situations is happening if he doesn't see someone's aura, or if he just missed it.
---
He does, but one of his add-ons is bugged so you can't mend yourself. So you eventually drop no matter what.
---
I don‚Äôt care how inaccurate it is. Ghost Face will always be Ghost/Dark in my heart
---
Because I don't think a needle or pin shaped object going through a eye is fun or cool kinda
---
No mither + self care then
---
Interesting. I've been wanting another ranged killer. It would be cool if he had 2 modes like doctor. One with a knife and he's a standard killer and one with a cross bow, where you get one shot and cant shoot until you reload but are never forced to reload and can switch modes at will. The silence thing and the misdirection stuff can use some discussion though
---
Ok you should read what I wrote again..
---
You haven't played any online game ever before if you have these thoughts
---
&gt;So how do you filter these people: The people that are out of the loop, the people that just had the perk equipped before the announcement, new people who just got into the game after the announcement.
---
Just read the announcement that automatically pops off when you start the game like when it happened with legion
---
Idk where you leave but even here people who don't know the law get punished anyway. Same thing for ToS, the difference is they usually release an official statement here
---
If you‚Äôre wondering how I saw the Claudette, top left corner when breaking the pallet
---
I just assumed hag was from argentina as well... oop
---
I‚Äôve worked in video game development. The DBD dev team has spaghetti code and anyone with experience in coding can tell. Tell tale sign is bugs appearing in sections of code that weren‚Äôt patched or changed in any way. I‚Äôve seen smaller dev teams send out hotfixes for bigger bugs in HOURS
---
Passive ability is used in the context of having an actual mechanic like aura reading, it is not interpretative or figurative.
---
Yes, I don't mind killer perks being stronger, but I am not fond of a survivor perk being straight up worthless. There is literally no reason to run WGLF if you don't need bloodpoints because it has no mechanic in game. No "you perform altruistic actions % faster" or "after unhooking a survivor, the aura of the killer is revealed to them for 4 seconds", the latter of which I think would be a great buff for WGLF.
---
Staying behind a gen doesn't work.
---
Getting into lockers is in the killer's favor because you are wasting time instead of doing gens.
---
Being near the hook is an okay counter.
---
Trying to decide weather or not to run object in the current game que.
---
#RemoveTheLegion
---
Yea, I would need to make a lot of work on that whole bit, and there is a lot more that can be done with that. But I feel like the only reason not to add him to the game is that he looks like a mix of ghostface and Michael
---
Top 7 anime betrayals
---
... no it's not comparable period.
---
A visual bug that gives you extra info isn't comparable to a perk that makes games last 2min
---
Yeah I know how devour hope works dude, I think you're trying to compare a slap to a murder tho
---
WTH is M1?
---
I remember them complaining actually i remember 99% of yhe entire games population complaining about legion constantly, wtf where were you lol?
---
We still don‚Äôt have unmasked Legion cosmetics :(
---
I‚Äôve had the opposite issue. A GF and I were crouch-chasing each other around a generator and he managed to expose me through the gen. FFS, no one should be able to mark another player through solid objects, survivors and killers alike.
---
Honestly if sprint burst worked like dead hard where its activated... it would actually be good, but balanced and lithe are all better choice perks than sprint rn.
---
Isn't Doc from Africa that then moved to America? Or is he just African American?
---
You clearly have never worked in the software development industry. The only reason a bug would appear outside of code that was changed is if your code is spaghetti and unorganized. I‚Äôve seen smaller teams fix bigger bugs in less time. 3 days for a ‚Äúhotfix‚Äù is ridiculous. A hotfix is for bandaging the code until a more permanent fix is established in the following days
---
DBD wiki has entries where Baker has input and thoughts on Killers and Survivors.
---
How do I install it? Idk what it needs
---
Leave game
---
Can april fools be killers switched skins with survivors. Id love to pallet loop a tall claudette as wraith
---
Yeah, it's not equal. You know what else isn't equal? Killer vs Survivors.
---
The killer has 4 perk slots where the survivor squad has 16. WGLF is difficult, if it has a shit effect it still gets bitched about, if they add a strong effect, there's 4 of it in every single match.
---
On the killer side the aura reading is only an issue on Nurse/Billy/Spirit who are highly mobile. In almost all other cases it's a positive for survivors as it discourages camping by giving the killer a tangible objective of something to do besides sitting and watching the hook.
---
Additionally, you say it's the bet aura reading. It really isn't. Because of its prevalence, and how obvious it is when in play it's nearly ALWAYS dodged on every single read.
---
That's the other thing, there's SO MANY built in counterplays to BBQ now, both in terms of aura blocking from lockers and gens, to mindgames knowing you're being seen. On the other side if you added a similar effect to breakdown like many survivors ask for, there's nearly no play around it as killer. Nothing to hide your aura, and a constant time pressure that denies you the ability to fuck around trying to mindgame it.
---
I don't want a strong effect, I want an effect. Something. Anything.
---
Well, looks like they've got a way for the game to constantly check their servers for update information.
---
No way to force hotfix or loadout denials like that? Just don't hold themselves accountable ever, despite how constant these problems are?
---
Especially with huntress and hatchets
---
Have you ever worked In software? If you write good code it should be sectionalized and organized. No big interference between unrelated classes and sections
---
So every dev team has to be super good with hundreds of workers to be perfect?
---
I've seen the term hot fix used in many ways.
---
Sounds like a lantern in strong winds to me
---
I cant loop for shit but ik not great either. But I can at least give a decent chase.
---
Got the sprint, then my footprints vanish quicker and I make less noise when jumping or entering lockers. So I try to lose them then quickly enter a locker since I can do the slam one without alerting them
---
I'm toxic because I think it's bullshit that I get punished for completing my objective? lol
---
To an extent, they‚Äôre not wrong. But they‚Äôre also smart to make it like that to give them so much flexibility.
---
Slugged the third so I can find the wounded Bill who was waiting at hatch.  Left the Nea in the basement and hooked her last.
---
I've been seeing a lot of posts saying spine chill is better than premonition, but I don't get why. Can someone explain?
---
It doesn't matter how clean it is, coding is still extremely complex and fine tuned. One change can break it all, like gears turning or a stack of really balanced cups.
---
It looks really nice, hopefully you get to draw more killers
---
You did play well, the score shows that, dont let the kills dictate how you played.
---
BBQ has counterplay because it has an ability. WGLF would need an ability first to have counterplay.
---
How else can hotfix be used? They‚Äôve proven multiple times that they care more about milking the game for profit than a good experience for their supporters.
---
It's exactly the same thing.  Knowingly taking advantage of a bug to create an unfair advantage for yourself.  Killer vs. Survivor doesn't matter exploiting is exploiting.  That 15% to all action speeds is ridiculous.  Combine it with multiple people exploiting it and/or combining it with prove thyself and a boxes and you are rushing them out of every game.  It's wrong man.  No amount of mental gymnastics changes that
---
Only true pros can lose killer mid chase, looping is an easy formula.
---
Fuck. No shirtless myers
---
Dude i work in the industry and I have for years I don‚Äôt really need it explained to me it‚Äôs really not that complex if you‚Äôre doing it right lol
---
For survivor: being left to die on my first hook. Second hook too if my teammates are just crouching in a corner when someone is obviously being chased.
---
For killer: I'd say SWF groups deliberately being toxic is up there. I play trapper a lot so losing ruin within 20 seconds of being able to move is quite frustrating.
---

All of the buildings on MacMillan.
---
Let's not also forget survivors jumping out of windows and continuing at full speed.
---
You know what's a good idea? An equivalent of Make Your Choice for survivors. The next time you unhook a survivor, the killer can't down someone for 60 seconds. My god, surivivor mains......
---
Even though they liyteky took feedback for both Freddy and Ghostface, not to mention Mom, I'm all ears, DS.
---
But my point wasn't that promoting altruism was a passive ability, which you argued. My point was that it needs some sort of actual in game mechanic that affects gameplay.
---
Four seconds in a locker is a LOT of time. Most of my matches are in red ranks against Nurses and Billies who make games go by less than 5 minutes and you end up barely safety pipping.
---

Well clearly you do. Complex as in something is super finely tuned and fragile. Easily broken.

You can try to report them for exploiting in the after game lobby. If you give the reason and the devs get multiple reports it might help.
---
Reddit killer in a nutshell. Yikes. 
---
Here is a prime example of the shittiest build there is, especially on Wraith. When you use two perks to slow the game down for you instead of learning how to pressure survivors and because you don't know how to deal with looping, better use NOED also.
---
The ultimate failure build. 
---
Swap those shitty perks for chase perks (Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, even Brutal Strength) and you will achieve much better results while making the game enjoyable for yourself and survivors.
---
E X T R A  T H I C C
---
I don't even bother countering BBQ anymore. I just stick to gens, usually more effective.
---
Yes please, faster unhooking would be at least something.
---
Quentin can have new cosmetics when he stops abusing Wake up like a cheating asshole
---
I don't want something like that. Nice assumption there buddy.
---
Ok but that Adam is cute I'd buy that
---
I wasnt even aware of the Wake up issue. Guess that explains why ive been getting slugged and tunneled every game.. :\
---
No it would be good and it would become a meta perk, but "best"? no...
---
Wake up lol

You're an idiot

Yeah killer closinf hatch has priority over survivor jumping in, so you really need to find it first as survivor
---
You don't even have to be that pro, perks help, I use lithe, dance with me and urban, I might as well be Houdini :p I'm not that great either
---
Has anyone tried fixing bugs before making an update live?
---
As pathetic as it sounds, I rage the hardest when all 4 of the survivors escape. I can get teabagged, flash lighted, and pointed at without raging if I get at least 1 kill. I don‚Äôt know why, but why it doesn‚Äôt bother me, but it doesn‚Äôt.

Have you ever worked in software development? You seem to avoid the question. I was on a development team for Bungie working on Destiny in 2014
---
Thanks...
---
Yea Yea, that's why I said "would need", not "currently needs"
---
Or, here‚Äôs a really creative, out-there idea: let people enjoy the game how they want?
---
Didnt plague ritually sacrifice people?
---
His outfit makes him hard to spot. You shit your pants as soon as you see his face in the distance.
---
That's the funny part.
---
Had a ‚Äúbrutal killer‚Äù stay on me for a whole match once. It was not correct. I got spanked.
---
Hag also did literally nothing wrong.
---
Hillbilly plus ruin is just a bad time
---
Lol

The issue is that too many players are playing killer right since the GhostFace release. Not enough survivors to go around.
---
Reported
---
Maybe
---
there is a bug with legion addons?
---
Riiiiight sure you were. No I'm not at least I'm honest about it
---
TFW the elevator is full and you can't get in, because some idiot put a dumbass statue in there.
---
And what do you think would be better than an on-command sprint burst?
---
Classic lol I don‚Äôt really need you to believe me
---
Thanks that‚Äôs what I suspected
---
You see I love this reaction but I‚Äôve seen killers do the same will we not talk about he bug where tinkerer tier 2 would remove your heartbeat for the whole game yet that was fine...
---
Quentin mains, can confirm
---
Kates is objectively the best survivor in the game, she smart, talented, creative, beautiful, kind and caring, sporty and she gets her hands dirty despite being hot as shit.
---
Go katey
---
ttv doesnt mean shit tbh
---
There‚Äôs a bug like that? That isn‚Äôt fine at all. Honestly I‚Äôm just salty over the whole bug exploitation thing, so don‚Äôt mind my fire with Fire stuff..been killer a lot and got too many wake up and survivor is full of just tunneling noed. Exploiting bugs isn‚Äôt fine, at all, none of it is, play the game fair or don‚Äôt play at all.
---
Hell yeah!!
---
Got a problem? Deal with it.
---
remember when unrelenting was actually insane perk?
---
Did you come down from it ?
---
no backsies
---
Nice glove guy
---
You get all 4, it‚Äôs just glitched to only show 3 stacks instead of 4.
---
!kobe
---
I think this replaces the Sightings intro as the scariest thing I've ever seen.
---
yea cause me not knowing the spirit is gonna one tap me with NOED and that makes me stupid... sure
---
That‚Äôs even more frustrating lmao
---
[&gt;:(](https://youtu.be/ukXkAz7MBdk)
---
I designed the Jane one! omg a favorite I‚Äôm so glad you like it üò≠
---
There is a rock you can get up on in gas haven. Just try to get up on it. Its near the killer shack. The actual gas haven map
---
Imagine being yellow rank and having ttv in your name
---
If you're staring blankly instead of moving the camera to he aware of your surroundings it means the killer doesnt scare you.
---
They should fix that.
---
I've used it off and on but I'm not going to use it until it's fixed to be safe, best to just not use bugged stuff at all
---
I wouldn't mind something like the last Survivor can start bleeding out faster if they've been in the dying state for a certain amount of time to help end the match while not outright screwing the Killer if they lost you and need to find you again.
---
Having the option to just die while downed seems a tad too strong if the Killer slugs the last two Survivors, wants to close the hatch first for a late hook, etc.
---
What the actual fuck is going on in Bhvr's studio.
---
Neat!
---
Self care is the best perk? You must be one of those players who runs off towards a corner and spends half a minute self healing when a teammate tries to heal you. I could run a medkit and heal twice as fast as self care and still use a better perk in that spot. 
---
Adrenaline heals you, sprints for 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds, and works even if exhausted. 
---
That might be tied with a controlled sprint burst, and is WAY better than self care. 
---
Also, calling sprint burst a LOW BROW perk, like Windows of Opportunity, which ONLY shows window auras, is braindead. Sprint burst is an Exhaustion perk, making it better than over half of the perks in the game. 
---
Balanced landing might be better on drop heavy maps, but sprint burst always works... making it better than Balanced landing if you could control it. 
---
And I don't know why you're trying to preach to me about balancing the game like I DON'T want that. I never said the game shouldn't be balanced, so I'm not sure why you're trying to convince me of something I already want.
---
I hate prove thyself so much
---
Literally the thousandth post on this. It's a VISUAL BUG ONLY.
---
Hey at least ds is countable (nice 60 seconds counter in a ducking game where matches are around 10-15 minutes)
---
Absolutely not, Discordance teachable is nice but legion itself is a weak killer and (personally) kind of boring too
---
wow literally everything wrong with this game in one video
---
bhvr doesnt care about balance, perks, meta, or players, they only want to make blank content ( Useless perks on new surv models) to make money from dlcs
---
Well it‚Äôs a hella lot better than i can do so take my upvote
---
Whatever, you either don't understand or won't so..
---
Nah I chose to bleed out up there.
---
noed cunt
---
Bbq is by definition a meal not a snack. 
---
Perhaps if the perk was named bbq flavored pork rinds you would be able to get the 4th snack
---
Ahh I see
---
Look at how short each chase was, and yet what came of it?
---
Yep.
---
His powers were hindered
---
Nah it‚Äôs honestly my first art in about a year that I‚Äôve spent decent time on and if I can do it you probably can do way better
---
Did he realize you were there?
---
Nurse and doctor
---
The Indians created dreads and the Vikings popularized it stop bitching.
---
I don't want to make the perk on part with BBQ, I just want the perk to have an actual effect so it isn't useless.
---
Thanks man
---
try playing trapper or wraith at rank 1 and then tell me with a straight face that killer is in a good spot
---
Self care is one of those perks you wanna run when you have an item that isn't a medkit, it will always be one of the best perks simply from the fact if you aren't  a swf sometimes people just wont heal you. Or being the last alive and you wanna get rid of the blood and moaning.
---
This is funny, yet sad because of how true it is
---
What movie is this?
---
For starters, it was a joke carter is black, and seconds you have no evidence of that other than something you read on Facebook so I wouldn‚Äôt spread  weird misinformation like that. Makes you look ignorant.
---
:( Please BHVR hotfix this
---
Because a 2 killer vs 3 survivor match is completely unwinnable for the 3 survivors? Or because the glitch just got discovered and it'll take a bit to find the problem, make a patch and send it out. Just report the problem and bring it to their attention and wait.
---
Yes it‚Äôs beautiful especially the hair !!! I live for it !
---
I always found Julie as just a Frank clone.
---
And they have a theme as well, nice!
---
I honestly want Jason in dbd.
---
Rng is rng. Nothing to see here
---
Same. Sadly won‚Äôt be happening anytime soon with the lawsuit
---
they dont give a single fuck about us players
---
I‚Äôve got a nea stuck in the roof of a building and she bleed out as well
---
If someone is walking to the killer tea bagging, they probably want to farm or have given up.
---
Someone‚Äôs teabagging on the exit gate, they‚Äôre being a dick but if you gave them exit and they teabag on exit line, they‚Äôre probably saying thank you.
---
It‚Äôs really not that hard.
---
Well first off, you wouldn‚Äôt have this problem if you cleansed totem, but obviously no one wants to waste time doing that. You don‚Äôt get ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for doing your objective. You just learn how to loop and juke. Remember that you are not entitled to survive and if you get hit by NOED, well that‚Äôs too bad, better luck next time.
---
I see hook camping much more at red ranks with much stronger killers (spirit, nurse, billy etc) This event has just been fuckin sad.
---
Yea I would think that banpoozle would be more useful
---
Nah I just have nearly 2000 hours in the game. Nobody is gonna be scared of the killer past 10 hours of gameplay because scary things are desensitized based on exposure.
---
Snackm
---
No, legion is really good depending on how you play them. They are mid tier and (personally) fun to play.
---
Imagine getting shocked by a Doctor so you can't drop a pallet, so you decide to keep running the loop right into a Trapper bear trap.
---
Doubling bloodpoints isn't useless, and if you don't need bloodpoints, why not just use a useful perk?
---
What's your average rank
---
They should just combine We‚Äôll Make it into WGLF so unhooking a survivor gives you a 50%/75%/100% healing speed for 30/60/90 seconds. Think it would make it a better perk instead of just gaining bloodpoints
---
Laughs in Michael Myers
---
What is that?
---
Doubling bloodpoints IS useless **ingame**.
---
That would be nice.
---
Thank you very much!
---
This is an actual bug though. Used DS a couple times and it doesn't work for some reason.
---
I'm aware of the 4 stack visual bug but are the snacks bugged now too?
---
"Always needing it" does not mean "best". There are perks better than it, making it, not the best.
---
The running and taunting GF of this scene made the only sense for what survivors did, I didn't see a survivor injuring itself yet :)
---
Your internet connection got paused for a moment
---
Lmao never seen that before.
---
Also, Happy cake day!
---
Had way too many situations where a Ghostface had me dead to rights but I turned a corner and hugged the wall, then walked right past them as they turned the corner.
---
Same here.
---
D'awwwww &lt;3
---
Bullshit. And yes they will ban people. They banned people abusing legion blades last time. I'd stay away from wake up and legion blades till its fixed.
---
Legion is really good depending on how ~~you play them~~ many mistakes survivors do
---
Scary Movie 1
---
Hillbilly and Cannibal for never-ending insta-downs
---
I got in, any idea what the rewards will be? Also the time of Friday morning is odd, difficult to play the required 15 mathes of Dead by daylight in the middle of the work day.
---
I really believe that in my heart of hearts, Paint Brush + Monitor Freddy on Lery's is better than Scratched Mirror Myers on Lery's.
---
Honestly you can‚Äôt if survivors want gens done they will get done your just there to down them.
---
Ghost face
---
Link?
---
Use ruin 
---
Pressure gens 
---
Play a more viable killer
---
Don‚Äôt chase survivors loop to loop
---
That's a bruh moment
---
I thought Quintins Perk was broken, now he is broken.
---
Playing against swf with crutch perks because I know I can‚Äôt do anything
---
Thanks
---
Daddy David
---
Ofc spirit in her kawaii suit
---
See you in the ~Fog~
---
2019 and still have these discussions oh God..
---
BBQ and chili counters:
---
- lockers
---
- distortion
---
- behind gen (still work, idk why you state it doesn't)
---
- fake direction
---
- stand still then take a direction
---
- stay close to the hook
---
- sole survivor (even if rarely used)
---
How many counters you want for one single perk?
---
Let's talk about wglf counters:
---
- face camp
---
That's it
---
&gt;Brain dead condition: hook people
---
Passive ability: aura reading
---
Best version of passive aura reading in the game: seeing every other survivor's auras helps to maintain game pace and apply constant pressure.
---
Brain dead condition aka objective.. ok dismiss that
---
Best passive aura reading in the game? With all those counters? Wow buddy, you know it was created to incentives people to seek new hooks and leave it to give saves opportunity? Guess not
---
Apply constant pressure, yeah it's what's about! Imagine don't see the killer for the entire match cuz you all play immersive checking every single rock, that's an amazing idea
---
Let's see about wglf
---
&gt;More difficult conditions: Protection hits[which are bugged and inconsistent], safe unhooks, which you may never be able to obtain as a survivor if your teammates are overly altruistic or if you are never close to the person on hook.
---
No passive ability: no extra benefit or meaningful impact on the actual game
---
Again, no passive ability. This perk is just straight up garbage.
---
Yeah it's more difficult if, as you stated, people are over altruistic. Using your own words, if they are brain dead.
---
Garbage because don't give the same power as it does the other side since ITS THE POWER ROLE. I used wglf for the entire duration of the event. Had absolutely nothing to say about it, gave a lot of BP and that's what's for. It's garbage for you because you want way too much. You wanna have reading ability? Take object of obsession, which allow you to see the killer 24/7 with a downside. It's not a 1v1 game don't apply the same entitlement like it is
---
&gt;BHVR, if you are gonna make perk counterparts, can you at least put them relatively on the same level??? Even Hope and NOED are more balanced as perk counterparts, and Hope is still just an "okay" perk while NOED is top tier
---
Yeah make the counterpart STRONGER for killer since it's a 1v4 but you want to have 2 things, numerous role and power role which is insanely dumb. 
---
"Noed top tier" WHERE???? They even showed you that in red ranks nobody use that because get so easily countered, are you drunk?
---
Dude before posting, at the very least get informed! Misinformed and entitled people like you are the reason why many dumb changes were made
---
RIP my ears
---
Patroll gens more, and unfortunately you need to use hex ruin. I hate the perk too, you need to run it as a killer otherwise you're at a disadvantage. No perk should be like that, it's one of the telltale signs of imbalance
---
Use perks that can Put Pressure on gen such as Ruin and Lullaby
---
Yeah I am aware now thanks! I was thinking like BBQ Chips though
---
Borderlands 3 (2019)
---
If you could snap out of it to also snap out of the trap...:P
---
That's fine, I'd just rather not play as Joey or a anime character. I just don't like Susie's sweater, I prefer the slicker cosmetic for julie.
---
Nah if the survivors wants out they should be able to let go and be gone.. better than a dc.
---
**VRRRRRRRRRRRRR**
---
I guess it‚Äôs in-character but still scummy.
---
Prob saw the game‚Äôs OP and thought ‚ÄúBut but that‚Äôs what my character would have done!‚Äù
---
Lmaooo
---
I played Doc the other day who which is one of my mains. Got called a cheat and a tunneler by a Claudette who was sandbagging her own teammate off the hook.
---
Discordance, Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Corrupt Intervention (and maybe others?) are all valid perks to use to try to stop genrush.
---
Keep survivors busy and avoid wasting time, hit as many as you can if there are several nearby, sloopy butcher, pop goes the weasel, hook a survivor and then hook another fast (perks that make you find survivors), enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle to get shorter chases
---
\*Angry pebble noises*
---
Nobody is mentioning the wake up bug.
---
Wake up is giving survivors 15% increase to all actions.
---
Whenever I wanna screw some people I run Bloody Coil with Iridescent Stone and Black Ward. Fun times.
---
my mouse shake all over the place .. why ?! why is this happening
---
Yeah because if you chase them directly following their blood it takes a long time to reach them, you need to cut corners.
---
It is a fun perk combo though, just not the best. Its only worth using on Legion or with pig and combined with nurses calling.
---
Did that, multiple times actually(better yet, freddy). Against a 4 man swf or 4 really good players yeah, it's not a pleasant experience but any other case you can do just fine.
---
Lean, lean, lean. Cannot stress this enough. Speeds up stalking by SO much. Also run ruin since his map pressure is trash.
---
It affects all actions while it's supposed to only affect exit gates.
---
Shitty hand writing?
---
It suits the tone.
---
Only on that bloodweb? A bug
---
y just start playing today and main the bell boy 18-17 i think
---
I GOT YOU FOR 3 MINUTES! 3 MINUTES OF ... PLAYTIME
---
Oh boo hoo :(
---
They will not ban someone who is unknowingly using it.... this is common sense bud . If you let it be known that you know about the exploit via message or in game chat , then yes , you will get banned .
---
Don‚Äôt have survivors loop to loop 
---
Always pressure gens, gens are how they win
---
You will not always get a 4K 
---
Punish over altruism, if they never leave the hook. Don‚Äôt just leave the area. No rules on chasing altruistic survivors around a hook. Might cause salty chats.
---
Other than that learn the mind games, unsafe pallets, and what to do on certain loops. YouTube it.
---
Like survivors focus on grinding teachables. Ruin, enduring, nurses, bbq just to make a few.
---
Sorry don't know how to help you there. Learning how to go against a survive with friends is one of the things that you get with experience. But good luck to you in future games.
---
Asking someone to improve the dbd community, is like asking the devs to released balanced killers. Its just never gonna happen.
---
I prefer monitor and abuse, the FOV increase isn‚Äôt as big but the terror radius reduction is worth the lesser FOV.
---
Probably because he stalked you previously and just capped it off when he saw you again.
---
Not stupid, dumb for not cleansing the totems, it's  so easily countered. And then instead of survivors cleansing the totem the act dumb and dive head first at the killer protecting a hook. It doesn't work well against experienced survivors
---
Then use a useful perk and forget the bloodpoints?
---
Think it's just a visual bug
---
Cool
---
Why not both? We have Prove Thyself. What's so wrong with giving WGLF an effect?
---
It was originally added to be a limited time thing, as a common offering. 
---
When feedback came back so positive, it was kept permanently and the rarity was increased. 
---
I assume this is from a bloodweb of a character you haven‚Äôt played in quite a while.
---
Yep, only on that one
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
Is there a difference between saboing a trap and disarming it?
---
I don't doubt it would be cool, it's just hard considering companies
---
Better jump in man.
---
Same. I have been running it for a couple of months now in an end game build and am being flamed every match now.
---
used it once got a 3k and a dc
---
I mean she killed people, she did it in self defense but she still killed
---
Its literally called a killer. No matter how many hours you should still be wary or it may as well be called a fluffy cuddlebear.
---
The fact you dont give a shit means your probably at the stage of the game where you're so confident in your abilities you ignore basic survival awareness. That's bad design.
---
Shh, nobody tell Clown that Wraith crushed his car
---
You forgot if someone have a flashlight, try to bait the player(s) with a  flashlight to come out to save or pick up survivors when facing a wall
---
Bruh moment
---
This has happened before in one of my games. Of course as shown in the video it works the moment you hop out the locker the killer has to hit you but not grab you. Probably also have to be in the dying state. 
---
God damn how many bugs are in this patch.
---
This is terrifying
---
Counters stealth killers, alerts me the killer is coming way before the TR is audible, gives a speed buff that has given me clutch so many times, and helps me elude the killer when I get a particularly good mind game on them. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's the best, most meta perk, but it's still pretty good, imo.
---
.
---
Don't worry about it man, I bought Myers (My favorite slasher) as a noob and my first match with him I got a 2k with 2 DCs and hatemail afterwards saying that I was a camping troll. Of course this was because I knew they were hiding behind a rock right near the hook so I decided not to leave. I've turned off all messages on PS4 because of this game, it makes you realize how horrible people are sometimes when they don't get their way.
---
Nope everyone would just be toxic and run 2 ghostfaces.
---
How do you have different colour for perks ?
---
Nurse + Legion/Plague one focuses on injuring survivors, Nurse tracks then down.  
---
Support Clown + Billy twins = Hard to miss a chainsaw when hindered. 
---
Freddy + Wraith for the memes
---
Two doctors for massive stall game
---
The dark ages
---
I found another one and it‚Äôs actually pretty cool.
---
Prestige 3
---
All his life he never really shined at anything, then got captured by the Entity and is now forever doomed to participate in endless trials. At least it seems like he truly shows his worth in them though.
---
Imagine still using noed as a valid argument in 2019
---
well, it isnt as simple as that, its a new glitch sp they still have to gind whats causing it and how to fix it, second just report people like that for exploits
---
I think the devs said that originally the Entity actually came for her father, but it sensed the potential within Rin due to her rage as she was dying and took her instead.
---
Even with killer having some broken stuff as well, its undeniable that survivors were terrifying beasts back in this time period. i think the 20 second sprint burst that recovers while running, and the 300% we'll make it that applied to self care was horrible.
---
I have no idea if you‚Äôre being sarcastic 
---
Also why am I being downvoted it‚Äôs just a question
---
I imagine Susie would like to see that, too
---
Frank: "Susie, should we be here?"
---
Susie: "You know what, Frank? We did your whole 'stab a shopkeeper, win a free mask' thing, now we're gonna do my thing."
---
Getting sandbagged by someone with TTV in their name.
---
Damn would be a tempting haunted grounds
---
Tbh I have taken to assuming most killers are running NOED and play super cautiously in the endgame because of it. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say not doing that is stupid though.
---
Nice mask
---
It's interesting how he was jumping midway way after u closed the hatch. But yea he got what he deserved. By showing him the true dominance of the teabag.
---

I play on PC. I just swapped the files under the game's data files. Check out r/PerkByDaylight.

Just once, I‚Äôd like BHVR to put out an update that doesn‚Äôt break two things for every one thing it fixes or adds 
---
Is that too much to ask?
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/540236/#Comment_540236
---
Devs are aware of the exploit and can track who's abusing it.
---
Some of those could be really evil depending on the map
---
Welcome to dbd
---
This is true. It's to gain the killers attention but little did they know is that it worked but at the cost of the survivor being stuck on hook all game and complaining is the negative side of it for survivors. While the killer feels that good relief.
---
He can trap every Jigsaw box
---
Had the same thing happen last night. One match kept the Match Result on the screen, next match it kept the last offering description above my perks
---
There are multiple perks that help you find totems if you need training wheels :)
---
I don't think so. In the modern day where such medical information is readily available then you could certainly make a case. But she was alive more than 2000 years ago where people where such information likely didn't exist and if it did, probably would have been difficult to come across.
---
"Oh look a pretty li-" "OH FUCK THE SURVIVOR ISN'T IN MY ARMS ANYMORE"
---
Man I hope they do something like this in the future. It would be terribly balanced and probably a complete and utter fucking mess, but god damn would it be fun. 
---
Anyway, Nurse and Doctor would be crazy. Doctor for finding survivors, Nurse for downing them quickly.
---
Damn, Claud was one with nature at that point.
---
I think they said something in the live stream that there would be the anniversary event and then a summer event this year.
---
3 seconds later she gets snatched off the gen by a prayer beads spirit.
---
Looping Jason was fun tho
---
If your a decent looper you won't need it. Your main priority is to keep from getting hit and keep the killer running with you for as long as possible. If you manage to lose the killer, or he leaves you. You go work on a gen. Depending on if it's your last hook find another survivor to heal you. Finishing gens is more efficient than sitting in a corner for healing. Paired with adrenaline its a very good perk. You might need that heal for clutch plays. Your wasting precious time if your healing with self - care.
---
Survivor - When Killers are terrible/give up
---
Killer - When survivors are terrible/give up
---
There used to be with old legion, the knife add ons let you make the mending time keep rising each time you hit someone, so it could take like 5 minutes to mend.
---
You know the body and masks are seperate parts right
---
Doctor and huntress would be scary.
---
She quic
---
She thic 
---
But most important 
---
She made of stic
---
Is it on the left of the bloodweb? I keep looking if it's a controller cursor or something but I can't tell but it looks like a bug.
---
Your flair is amazing
---
I agree it would be a mess...but so fun to play...
---
A lot of people are suggesting Nurse paired with people who can help her find/down survivors...so Doc, Plague, Legion...
---
I enjoy legion a lot. Hes one of my mains. However, good survivors can abuse the fact that you're just an m1 killer.
---
r/Raimimemes
---
You have to have skill to pull it off, is I think what they mean. It's similar to how they changed flashlight saves. Used to be you could trigger the blind anytime during the pickup animation and he would drop the survivor at the end of it. Now you have to time it properly, promoting more skillful play. Same thing with pallet saves, and so on
---
I'd love a slick black leather jacket for Julie though, that'd be awesome.
---
Thicc thighs save lives. Good job!
---
It's been the "time flashlight saves properly" for the longest time, they tried the save at any time of the animation for ONE update and changed it.
---
&gt; walk into his TR 
---
&gt; scream
---
&gt; one and a half second later there's a hatchet giving you a surprise haircut
---
Idk bout this ... Nice try I guess
---
This perk never made sense. I can get hit an extra time "IF" it's a regular attack and then I become the killer's obsession. Wow! Deal!
---
David for sure! I'd let him do all sorts of things to me &lt;3
---
And killers still managed to kill at a reasonable rate
---
Too be honest ever since Micheal was one of the first licensed Killers I always had a thought of maybe Jason being part of the roster even after Freddy. But as soon as the leak of F13 game came out my hopes just died so fast. But I still have some bit of hope of Jason being a killer in DBD. Might need to change the machete being it's similar to the trapper.
---
Don‚Äôt forget We‚Äôll Make It was stackable to 300% AND applied to self heal.
---
As I said before I would love Jason in this game but the lawsuit stops all of it happening
---
So its like dead hard or what
---
People wont fo for this. Mainly for 2 things. It allows survivor's to see totems and it allows them to break them faster. A lot of people complain of ruin and it being found in the first few minutes of the game. For that reason a lot of people wont like this perk
---
I remember these days...It still scares me as a Killer being Sabo squad was a nightmare for the Trapper and the whole vacuum pallets \*shivers\*
---
They break like half the game with every new release
---
For some reason I think they would like this on r/dbdgonewild
---
I'm not sure what you mean, I never said it was?
---
Yea that's the major thing. The only way for this to happen is the main franchise asks BVHR to give them rights for the killer. Similar to Evil Dead with Ash if I remember.
---
2 weak killers sure there toxic lol
---
Like the grudge ...  can‚Äôt be contained... can‚Äôt be beaten.. it‚Äôs just rage all the time.
---
Not at first. He looked around for 30 seconds and then ran off. A little while later he came back and looked up and saw me.
---
YESSSS!!
---
I cant see why meg. I mean yeah she could have secretly been mad at her mom for getting sick but meg is really one of the only survivors I truly feel sad for. She gave up her dreams to take of her sick mom, and now she is never going to see her again and has to go through the endless of hell of dying over and over again.
---
I think Feng Mi won a tournament. It came down to like 1 vs 1 in like a first person shooter game. And instead of shooting her opponent she was cocky and knifed him and then tea bagged him and humiliated him by talking shit. Dude put the controller down, kept his headset plugged in and blew his brain out over like xbox live. If that ain't bad enough to get her sent to purgatory, then he was a family man and the money he was gonna win in that tournament was for an operation for his kid and he didnt win it
---
Most of their lores are very sad :(
---
So are you acknowledging that it isn't always optimal for survivors to play hide and seek with 5 totems? Especially not even knowing if the killer has noed in the first place?
---
This has happened to me a couple times, I always thought it was a visual bug but I think it is at this point.
---
Ah see there you have it, this makes vaulting more in line with how the game is then. I remembered pallet saves being changed because of how bad those were for a long time but it's hard to keep track of every little change they make over the years :p
---
They always fucking with stuff that no one ask for lol
---
Well we got what wanted. Survivors always wanted Killers to be nerfed so here you go.
---
But yea this must be a nightmare being it's now memorizing where the gens are.
---
How is he weak in any shape
---
Ok you've been harassed by the basic bitches too long, slugging is not leaving a single person on the ground, slugging is downing all 4 survivors or more usually 3 before hooking, it means the survs get 1 chase each and thats it so its just like tunneling or camping, the real slugging removes the game from people, leaving 1 or 2 on the ground isnt slugging :) youre all good.
---
I hate that killer
---
Yep or iron will with dead hard is another way, drop pallet and hide after breaking LOS and if found you can dead hard to the next loop.
---
The power of Teabag compels you foul survivors!!!!!
---
I usually Teabag survivors whenever they try to teabag me on pallets. I just let loose for like 2-5 min. Then let him go. At the end of the chat I type "Yea, I have defiled you Ash, Your mine now." they just start laughing so hard.

---
Thanks so much!
---
It sounds like that's unintentional, shouldn't you have to be moving fast to fast vault? Does that not make sense?
---
Well, one thing too is that SWF groups are even more.prone to altruism and saving their friends. Don't camp, obviously, but use that need to save their friends against them. Don't just always let them.
---
The sooner you can take one of them out, the more the odds go in your favor, so, again don't specifically tunnel, but don't just let the u hooked survivor go so you won't be called a tunneler. Get em back on the hook.
---
And get used to the meta perks that they always run.... There's usually one or two "loopers" that have Dead Hard and Sprint Burst, Decisive Strike, etc. These people are counting on you to chase them to let the gen jockeys work.
---
Try to identify the bold ones first and know what they're trying to do, and go for the weaker ones when possible, and peel off a chase when the loopers are baiting you.
---
They'll waste time baiting you from gen jockeys, which, if you're targeting the gen jockeys, has two or more people wasting time, and less gens being done in the process.
---
Make them uncomfortable and don't give them what they want. Change their roles as much as possible.

---
Prequel has to count if you take the story serious at all.  The issue with just starting it after the first movie is that you can't avoid the prequel.
---
I‚Äôve seen monto play her but it‚Äôs no where near how bad ghostface is
---
You can grab injured survivors when they vault windows and pallets. 
---
Locker grabs you can just do.
---
It was like 3 min match
---
Swole Doctor, please.
---
When I try that crap all i do is just swing
---
Looks like something out of hostel
---
I'm just thinking of a decent way to explain the looping problem.
---
Killers complain about looping being an issue and when asked for an alternative they tend to respond with stealth and when told that stealth is incredibly weak they say the player is bad. But when you tell the killer to stop playing a weak killer that struggles with pallet looping they tend to respond with just nerfing it instead. Maybe the solution is buff stealth and/or nerf anti-stealth then nerf looping in some way rather then just crying looping is annoying and to use stealth, then also refusing to use killers that can deal with looping.
---
Platform- ps4
---
Glitch- visual?
---
Grinded for hex ruin got it in blood web bought it for ghost face. It did not appear in inventory even when closing app or turning off the system. It was tier 1
---
It‚Äôs because people are still playing a lot of the gateau offerings. I‚Äôm just over here enjoying the instant survivor lobbies
---
Just speaking 06 prequel on who he actually contributed to killing or maiming.
---
* Main survivor chick at the end of the movie.
---
* Soldier boy
---
* Drug guy
---
* Drug guy's GF?  White dress lady who's only character point was being almost able to leave except she got chased down and hooked by LF.
---
* Biker chick's boyfriend.
---
* Soldier boy's brother, who is also his first mask.
---
* Meat shop owner
---
* Cop
---
* Pedestrian, end of movie.
---
* Maimed his uncle by cutting off BOTH his legs.
---
So I'm counting 9 deaths in the prequel just by his hand or practically by his hand \[Basically causes the drug GF to bleed out\] and 10 if you count amount injured period.
---
Even in the first movie it's like another 6?  I didn't think on that one too hard.
---
EDIT:  It's based off the 17 movie, Leatherface. Which is kinda a cop out in my book but still.
---

So the problem probably is that you do a lunge attack. Press M1 once
---
I play him for points, so it's really about what you want to accomplish with him. I use a combo of barbecue and chili + distressing + unnerving presence + whatever else (overcharge or ruin is not a terrible idea). For add-ons, that brown "moldy electrode" add-on is nice, and then use any one that increases madness inflicted by your static field. Your terror radius is pretty big, so your buffed static field and unnerving presence can make finding them a tad easier, shocking them 2-3 times max before hitting them, downing them, rinse repeat with others you see through barbecue, or maybe go after any of your madness notifications you get. The power can also, if used properly, be strategic for stopping then from utilizing loops, like pallet dropping or window vaulting, you can aim through the wall where you believe they'll be, and that can work wonders. If your goal is to get a 3 or 4k every game, as unrealistic of a goal as that is, I really can't say what is your best bet beyond using the best add-ons maybe and the strategies above. If you read all this, hope it helps somehow. The best groups of survivors though, against doctor? Typically you'll lose, rank-wise, but bloodpoints? You can bank on getting some every time.
---
I like that more
---
Premonition tells you where the killer is, so if the heartbeat increases you know which way to hide, but against a stealth killer you dont know if the killer is coming after you or not, so you might be hiding for no reason and wasting time. Spine chill lets you know if they are targeting your gen or know where your healing/hiding, allowing you to run or hide early. Also, if your on a gen near the killer who is chasing someone else behind a wall, it can tell you if the killer switched targets to you or if you can keep doing the gen next to the chase. I started running it to counter ghost face if he sneaks up.
---
TL;dr Premonition tells you where to run and Spine Chill tells you when to run
---
Na i like ghostfaces more
---
Addons change the range you can reveal, and also change how long etc.  Topped off exposing him is hard right now.
---
The hatred runs deep when someone dedicates a multi-paragraph comment to it
---
OMG, can you imagine two Doctors running Distressing and being in a constant mess of screaming?
---
How has no one suggested Myers and Ghostface yet?
---
I mean, that would SUCK.
---

My first escape was also a hatch!

This is one I'd love to see as a Doctor main, if I could find a good Nurse player on console.
---
I hope you stay! Congrats on your fist escape
---
Aaaaand it's a corn map

Not even it's literally the same as his normal hammer just blood drips

dad is that you

I just camp the gates of I‚Äôm the only one alive
---
Ah ok just kind of hard to tell on the internet
---
And lol I would do the same
---
Amandas literally has one vain on it n thats it
---
He has to urban evasion away
---
Did this to me the other day when I was trying Ghostface. Got two baby Dwights and I felt terrible.
---
Lol thanks for the advice
---
are you saying you have a separate, sweatier perk build to play against swf? Do you limit your power with unrelenting and monstrous shrine for a fair fight?
---
Survive
---
Shit is broken big time. I‚Äôll stare right at him dead center in my screen and get exposed. Extremely frustrating.
---
100% swf groups with crutch perks and strategically planned out builds all carrying toolboxes and flashlights in the lobby.
---
You just *know* it's gonna be a shitty match with a bunch of cocky asshats who will bully you the whole time and, god forbid you get a few of them, shit talk you afterwards in messages / chat.
---
If they win, they shit talk. If they lose, they shit talk. It's a lose / lose for the killer.
---
Why would I do that
---
Jk thanks
---
Devs always do this shit.
---
Instead of fixing it, they're"keeping track of exploiters". 
---
Just fix the damn perk. They do this every time they break something and ban abusers rather than quickly fix the problem.
---
Watch this video https://youtu.be/K9cqIdg3BSA one of the best players in DbD gets looped for 4 gens before he gets a hook on his first survivor and he outplays them at every single loop. Survivors have plenty of time and if one member of the team dies "prematurely" maybe they don't deserve to win as a team, NOED or not. It's not that survivors don't have enough time to do totems, because 90 percent of the time they spawn near gens, it's that they don't want to, until it's too late
---
Lol I'm pretty new too so all I got to say is goodluck
---
Good luck to you too
---
 Bhvior: that‚Äôs a good idea 
---
But I like this :thinking to implement something else for more than a year
---
Not DBD related, but he looks like purple guy from FNAF!(or at least my interpretation of him)
---
He even has wires and tubes coming out of him
---
Said by Peanits in DbD discord
---
but she can move really fast while PHASING and play mind game with PALLET
---
The Great Depression in one picture
---
He *prove*d *thyself* you could say. He *bond*ed with the other survivors and became a *leader*
---
I think they want to get a ton of stuff with the hotfix. Audio being COMPLETELY FUCKED, Legion's new blade exploit, wake up exploit, ghostface fixes, plague end of match crash, play with your food bug, BBQ stacks bug, etc.
---
Like I suspect the upcoming hotfix (Depressingly, likely on Tuesday, IDK if patches ever came out on Saturday or sunday) will get a good chunk of the issues fixed. 
---
I hardly want to play the game in the state that it is in currently. I can't even play Plague anymore due to the crash.
---
wud fuq
---
God I love Friday the 13th. Still a blast to play with friends. Good times.
---
on top of the locker duuuh
---
What is the wake up and blade glitch?
---
So just put a disclaimer on load up as they did for Legion mend, and then ban accordingly. Or, and here‚Äôs a shocker, fix it already devs. Lol
---
Aw.. how cute.
---
Introducing gliding
---
My new favorite bug. At the end of the game survivors cant exit. You just leave the area and can run to the bonfire. Fall off the edge and they put you BACK IN THE MAP.
---
That bug is a old one that got fixed almost two years ago and now it's back. I have the same problem on PS4
---
are you ok
---
Ghostface: WASSSSSUPPPPP  
---
Kate:
---
uh I know the blade glitch is on legion where if you combine 2 blade addons every time you put a survivor into deep wound the effect gets slower and slower, making it to where after 4 hits it essentially makes it take as long as finishing a generator I think. Idk about the wake up glitch but I heard about it and wanted to include it in my meme
---
He does exhale when he gets stunned
---
Please BHVR üôè
---
what's wrong with audio? it's finely as it used to be before Legion chapter.
---
That bug is an old one that got fixed almost two years ago and now it's back. I have the same problem on PS4.
---
I enjoy playing him, especially if you have good perks on him.
---
Goodnight, sweet prince
---
I find the game fun win or lose, i don‚Äôt get where the need for salt comes from :(
---
Yeah rank pairing has been really funny in almost all my matches lately
---
To true
---
He's too sexy.
---
Same honestly it's crazy before I started playing this I had maybe gotten 2 hate mail in my life now I have about 20 and I only started playing 2 weeks ago
---
i dunno man, i'm on purple ranks deranking to green to get Ghostface adept so i just don't kill people, naturally. no op shit just 4 perks to maximize bp and no add-ons. had multiple games with people abusing Wake Up and didn't feel much difference between it and them having Prove Thyself and boxes. it's not that big of a deal
---
May he rest peacefully, as he just got rancor'd
---
It‚Äôs kinda up to the player, me, I enjoy Ghostface for his sneaky, methodical stalking. But in stark contrast also love legion for their fast stabby gameplay
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting so much goddamn hate. As someone who plays both survivor and killer frequently I have to say yes, killer perks are meant to be more powerful, but there are *so* many passive abilities that could be added to WGLF that would make it 1000x better to use and still not broken or even good for that matter. Anything to make it more worth it would be amazing. The main argument of it all is yes BBQ is amazing. It has 2x and insane pressure with auras. Yes there are counters blah blah we get it. Nonetheless it is still an amazing perk. I don‚Äôt use WGLF because it‚Äôs not strong though. I use it because it‚Äôs not convenient. I don‚Äôt want to be constantly forced to go for unhooks. I unhook but I don‚Äôt want the pressure of having to go for literally every unhook to get all the stacks. There are a million ways to fix WGLF. 
---
‚Ä¢Add a passive such as revealing the killers aura to you and/or the person you unhooked. 
---
‚Ä¢Same passive but with the aura of gens and totems in a certain distance? 
---
‚Ä¢Combine it with we‚Äôll make it. 
---
‚Ä¢Combine it with borrowed time (would be super strong tho). 
---
I‚Äôm sure you guys have millions of ideas for a passive for WGLF. 
---
I think the thing that makes me most mad about it is I just don‚Äôt like the concept of WGLF at all. What I‚Äôm getting at is BBQ would be better than WGLF even without aura reading because hooking people is something that if you know how to play killer, no matter the factors, will happen passively without thought. It is literally the main objective for killer. You pretty much get bp just for playing killer. WGLF you have to play extremely altruistic if you want all stacks and on top of it all there are a lot of factors even if you play that way that might prevent you from getting all four stacks. 
---
‚Ä¢Somebody else gets the save because you are two far away from the hook or someone else is just closer
---
‚Ä¢The Killer is camping
---
‚Ä¢The Killer literally doesn‚Äôt hook anyone
---
Let that last one sink in because it‚Äôs 100% true. With BBQ you are rewarded for doing you main objective in the game, hooking and killing survivors. However if you are an amazing group of survivors and you get all the gens done, loop the killer, and escape, you literally get punished for being good at the game. In my opinion the idea of WGLF being the exact opposite of BBQ (hooks VS unhooks) it‚Äôs only good as an idea and nothing else. I honestly think WGLF is a problem and if not solved with a passive that makes it more worth running it deserves a rework of some sort
---
‚Ä¢20-25% bonus for each gen that gets done 
---
‚Ä¢25% each time you heal a survivor or co-op heal a survivor. (Maybe even additional 12.5% each time you heal yourself) 
---
Those two are the best in my opinion with the first being the best because literally there are next to no factors that should stop you from getting at least one token. And when you do get one it‚Äôs for completing your main objective just as the killer gets tokens for doing such. However to solidify the point there are a few obscurer options that still in my opinion would be easier/more fun to get than WGLF stacks
---
‚Ä¢25-50% for a pallet stun on the killer
---
‚Ä¢100% for opening a gate (this one is very questionable)
---
‚Ä¢25-50% for every minute of chase
---
I just think with everything I‚Äôve stated there‚Äôs no reason to disagree, killers and survivors alike, to say that WGLF is fair or worth using. It needs some buff/rework for it to be fixed in my eyes
---
Wake up currently affects everything, not just opening exit gates
---
We are just writing our own stories. Lol
---
Really loving these because this is also my favorite skin combo for him! Any plans on making more? :D

I wanted to know this as well

if this happens, the only way to escape is the hatch
---
Nurse and billy seems perfectly fair and balanced
---
3 year old game btw.
---
Just because the killer had the Gruesome Gateau that gives 103% BPs.
---
Hello again, fancy meeting you here!
---
Everything everyone has said. Just here to say that it has been addressed by the devs and is 100% getting fixed with the arrival of dedicated servers
---
I mean they had a good middle ground for MoM in the ptb but they literally chose to have to be worthless lol.
---
I'm being constantly impressed at how well done the fan submissions are for the contest. This is fantastic. Be proud of it regardless of what happens. You do have competition in this very talented community.

Those are points before any additional BP adds.

Cakes, perks, etc, don't reflect on this screen.

Removed for salty after game chat
---
i have sound triggering migraines(therefore sounds mean a lot to me) and the breathing, grunts of pain, footsteps are as i remember them being before Legion chapter. that's how it used to be, man, before they started breaking sounds every other update since new engine with Legion chapter. and they fixed the injured music finally too. and the chase music. both were way too loud and as killer you could not hear shit with it because it was twice louder than survivor sounds.
---
can't say about menu music cause why even giving a fuck? it doesn't influence the gameplay, it's on 0 for me always.
---
no idea what about Myers. all worked fine for me.
---
heartbeat is a little broken but no idea, had no problem with it. Hag with M&amp;A been broken since forever, kinda used to that type of broken. 
---
Billy's saw most likely been an add-on, not the change cause i've been against multiple Billies, the saw sounded as usual.
---
I played today and it took around 10 minutes to put me in a lobby and another 5 to give me survivors. so no
---
&gt; literally chose to have to be worthless
---
I like that having to help a teammate or work with someone else makes it "worthless".. no wonder people who only play survivor are entitled whinny cunts and think there's some deep rooted BVHR plot to screw them.
---
yes, you have to disarm the trap before you can sabo it. one also requires a toolbox (sabo) dmmd the other doesn't
---
Just wondering when are they picking cotest winners? Also very nice, unique and classy doctor
---
They changed it, because before you could get a fast vault on any window. Even those designed to not be fastvaultable
---
This is true. Stealth is mostly non-viable against killers at red ranks. Looping is necessary to stay alive long enough to complete gens before you start running out of pallets. Sooner or later people are going to be chased into areas that have been used, and they will drop like flies.  
---
A lot of the fun of the game comes from the mind games and prediction involved in looping in areas that break line of sight, or in the strategic choice of when to use/burn certain strong loops/pallets. There is satisfaction in taking risks with the potential of great rewards.
---
Could you kindly get the fuck off my post? I've been looking at this comment section and in every single one you're the most immature person who blocks people because they *main a certain character* and put people down for liking characters you don't. Go away
---
Or they can wait a few seconds and quit being a bitch.
---
Iron Maiden wants to know your location... Wait it already does. Also Legion can see you in lockers when the Killer's Instict activates, already caught like 3 people hiding in lockers and have been playing Legion for 3 days, people really don't even know how he works, they only know what is a nerf

I am still mad they didn't choose her dad as survivor, that would have been a way better choice storywise as a random american living in Japan.
---
Tunnel and Mori.
---
They should‚Äôve keep the perk to safe unhooks. Only two survivors would be able to get it off at max.
---
He isn't talking about the charge, he's talking about the movement speed penalty when he's charging
---
*Alexa play despacito*
---
It's because everyone wants to play Ghostface so not a lot of people are playing survivor
---
I literally just had a match like this where I played a bunch of rank 20s while I'm a rank 11 killer, I was just trying to do my Daily with Legion too which usually takes me 2-3 games to do it
---
Looks amazing! Very detailed :)
---
You got the effort done right. Now get [Fun With a Pencil](https://archive.org/details/andrew-loomis-fun-with-a-pencil) and if you can turn that effort into improvement you'll go a long way :)
---
It‚Äôs the Baby Dweet clothes :0 I want to see him go on a locker so bad. Also the cosplay looks fantastic.
---
It even boosts vaulting lol
---
Depends, in the confines of the story that BHVR created they are wrong. Aside from the licensed killers who had powers before like Freddy all the killers are just people from the normal world pulled into the entities realm and given various powers so they can be killers.
---
Especially with the "The Legion is inexperienced" part.... the survivors aren't mechanical engineers either. We don't play the first trial they have though but more like the thousandth time, so everybody knows exactly what they are doing.
---
Pipping is not the issue, the issue is dying when you shouldn't. Most survivors SHOULD NOT be dying if they played well all match because the killer has 1 fucking perk, and before i hear the words "just break the totems" if the survivors had a fucking totem counter on small game or something then you could make that argument.
---
Good meme, I approve.
---
1. Yes NOED is BS. But just because something else is BS doesn't mean MoM wasn't.
---
2. Run Small Game and cleanse totems. Now that you get Lightbringer points for it, there's no excuse.
---
I would kill to have this üò≠üíù
---
I believe this is a bug when someone switches from ash to another survivor. Once someone i was queueing with switched from ash to dwight, and for about 3 seconds dwight was in the same pose. upon further inspection im fairly sure this is ash's animation stuck onto dwight, or in your case, jane.
---
It can make sense *and* be lazy
---
Doctor and Mikey. You CAN'T hide from Mikey with a Doc around shocking you.
---
Holy fucking shit.
---
Also don't do that, it may seem stupid but if the killer was legit playing the game you'll make people angry, only do it when he camps or tunnels
---
Same thing here on pc
---
The speed boost noed gives is what makes it so powerfull imo
---
It's not, it's based off the original Chainsaw Massacre. Leatherface in 2017 doesn't look like that.
---
Is it Elon Musk
---
What a fucking weirdo.
---
It'd be brokenly OP.
---
That is your internet which caused that
---
Honestly Killers like that are just big babies in my opinion, and you know they're using anti-stealth perks. Because I've played killer for probably 300 hours, and I can pretty confidently say that playing against truly stealthy survivors is a pain in the fucking ass. Like whose idea of fun is searching around for several minutes in a match for the group of claudette's immersing themselves into the map. There's a reason stealth has been nerfed, plus having played against a lot of killers, some raging about pallet loops in end-game chat, a lot of them just really fucking suck, like the kind of suck where every time they try to mind game they mind game themselves. A lot of killers I played against also stomp us because they know how to play the fucking game. 
---
This is the problem that arises when a group complains about the shit that they just don't have the skill for yet.
---
You realise they likely delayed the hotfix to deal with all the other issues that have cropped up?
---
I‚Äôm going to disagree about the optimal plays and deserving to win, his chases were short (not necessarily a good thing due to embelms); however, look at when he tries to use ghost face‚Äôs power, he literally activates night shroud in front of a guy he just hooked. He wasted more time in the early game ‚Äúslugging‚Äù (as survivor mains would call it) instead of hooking the downed survivors. Some of them he had to I agree; but there were times where he could just as easily blocked off the pallet and picked up and hooked the survivor. Adrenaline didn‚Äôt really help the survivors in this game: bt, and ds definitely did, but you don‚Äôt get this level of coordination from solo queues, I think this game is more unbalanced by swfs then  by the ‚Äúshit perks‚Äù as you call them.
---
I get him almost every game.
---

---
To be fair, the spirit is a ghost so... ok that‚Äôs even worse she should just go through everything
---
Welcome! First it depends on what side you wish to play, lets start with the free dlcs and base game perks.
---
For Survivor: I would recommend Self Care from Claudette, Adrenaline from Meg, Dead Hard, and We're Gonna Live Forever from David King for Bloodpoint gains when you do safe unhooks or protection hits for increased Bloodpoint gain.
---
For Killer: Generally most of Nurses Perks are good, Sloppy Butcher from Hillbilly is a good choice to make healing a bigger issue for survivors, this will make them take longer to heal and bleed more frequently. Huntresses Lullaby from Huntress is a decent perk as well once you get 5 tokens.

who ever downboted this fuck you, I typed in dead and this is the sub I got. so fuck your shitty game
---
BONESAW IS READDDDDYYYYYY
---
What are you talking about
---
Yeah. I made a report about it. I couldn't Wiggle, Heal or Recover.
---
Reminds me of the Outlast doctor. Nice one
---
Indeed, their explanation for spirit was the following: the entity was more or less bored with 'normal' killers and wanted to see how far it's power could actually go, thus it tried to "create"(Have them start killing because the entity wants them to) a killer on its own, aka the spirit
---
Lmao
---
dont make me sad bro :(
---
I really don't understand their decisions
---
Have my reddit silver! Let‚Äôs win this!
---
Seems this bug occurs plus and additional one where you cannot escape at the end of the game.
---
A survivor in one of my games had both of these bugs happen. All of us ran out but it wouldn't register for him. When he tried to go back in and redo the exit, he was downed by the killer and had no chance to wiggle out.
---
They were testing it where it worked for safe unhooks, which makes the perk situational but not unusable. Instead they decided to make it tied to a buggy feature that is nigh impossible to get even two tokens on.
---
I was vsing a trapper I just gave up at that point and went to the basement with him
---
Honestly, as much as I loathe when people D/C for selfish and entitled reasons, I always laugh at the face plant. Always. It lessens the sting, considerably.
---
Well uh, that's kinda the point.
---
Congrats! I remember when I first started I was legit terrified of skill checks. Like I sat on my chair being like "pls no skill check pls no". Then I realized that "Technician"was a godsend for a person like me. And to be honest escaping through the hatch, especially now when it can be closed, is an amazing feeling and a pretty good thrill! 
---
Welcome to the game, family! See you in the fog :)
---
Wait are you the actor they modeled Dwight after?
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. It‚Äôs frustrating. What‚Äôs the point of such an event if they don‚Äôt make it more common? It‚Äôs your third anniversary, dammit. Stop being so stingy.
---
I see a lot of people saying people like David should be able to fight back but that's pretty stupid to say. Lore wise someone probably has tried it and the entity immediately disqualified them.
---
Plague literally did nothing but pray

Plague has a strange backstory

Can you do the bald head Dwight Cosplay, please.
---
I know it is stupid asking but what is the perk?
---
I don't care about this but daily reminder we traded speaking german for our current society and we still somehow convince ourselves the west was "saved" and the good guys won
---
M1 means that his only way of attacking is with a basic attack (the left mouse button), unlike some other killers like for example the Huntress who has range attacks by throwing her hatchets from the distance so she can easily knockdown a survivor if she‚Äôs any good at it, or the Trapper who can put traps around the map to hold you in place long enough for him to come and hit you, the Nurse who can teleport and easily avoid pallets ot obstacles to get to you, etc. Ghostface can only hit you with his knife when he‚Äôs next to you, so it makes his gameplay a little more focused on getting close to the victim, that‚Äôs why Night Shroud allows him to 1-hit a survivor if he can fully stalks them.
---
Right now, a lot of people are having a bad time with him because the way of taking him out of Night Shroud is a bit buggy (sometimes you can easily take him out, sometimes not, sometimes you can even take him out of Night Shroud in situations where you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to like when he‚Äôs behind a wall...), so the best thing you can do while we wait for the upcoming hotfix is that you move your camera A LOT and in case you see him stalking you, run behind something while you use your camera to look at him and pray that everything works correctly so you can take him out of Night Shroud. Once he‚Äôs unavailable to stalk, he can‚Äôt 1-hit you so from this part till he recovers his power, it‚Äôs basically the same as playing against another killer: don‚Äôt get hit two times by him and vault him, use pallets, etc.
---
This is art made by my friend that I begged to let me post on here, because he doesn't have reddit. I'll get the link to his snapchat where he makes more art as soon as he wakes up.
---
Hold on, just a little while longer...
---
Are you real Dwight?
---
You look like the Entity lost track of you and you got to the real world for once
---
This would be a good time to point out that it was called Mesopotamia, THEN Babylon, THEN Southern Iraq
---
Imagine the Nurse's and Wraith's kids... invisible and teleport.
---
The fastest disconnects in history.
---
Dwight, when I started it was helpful knowing where everyone was using Bond.
---
Fang Min is good too, Alert giving you the killers location and Lithe to scandal alway.
---
Its also summed up slightly indirectly in her lore entry.
---
That is because you bought those killers with auric cells
---
He‚Äôs Nigerian, Ojomo is like the ‚ÄòSmith‚Äô of Nigeria
---
Thanks a lot I‚Äôll have to try them
---
*WINNAAAH! WE HAVE OURSELVES A WINNAH!*
---
This is so pure I don't remember my first time escaping I have been playing since beta same with my first 4k can't remember either, this made my day though thank you &lt;3
---
You did way better than my first actual game
---
based
---
Beam me up scotty
---
I think currently wait times are bad because everyone is playing Ghostface
---
Mettle of Man
---
Killers whenever a decent survivor perk comes out
---
I can only speak for PC
---
Why would you not need to buy it again?
---
Why do you need to play on a smurf?
---
Also looping is just practically going in circles with the killer(by a wall), especially when there‚Äôs a pallet but you never drop it and you fake out the killer.
---
BUENO.
---
It was never a battle
---
he's a shy boi not sneaky.. he wants to make friends but has social anxiety.. so he just hides and peaks around the corner wanting to be in the mix but too scared to come over and say hi until you notice him and he freaks out and gets stabby. 
---
be nice to the shy boi
---
Never really played killer until ghostface, now I‚Äôm having a blast playing both sides. I hope they don‚Äôt massacre my boy.
---
guess green ranks isn't as "ez" as you think.. sounds like you're boosted. Maybe you need to derank more to your true rank
---
You're just straight up stating things that aren't true, no audio ques??? Are you deaf? Do you not hear the LOUD AS DIRECTIONAL WHOOSHING NOISE HE MAKES? He's possibly the least stealthiest stealth killer in the game. He literally has a pseudo terror radius.
---
&lt;3
---
That Dwight just standing there as Adam was mori'd instead of saving you was beautiful lmfao
---
The cat perk lol
---
They thought he was op
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a little toxic, but anytime I get a 4 man kill I always t-bag and spin in circles while the last survivor is being sacrificed and can‚Äôt do anything.
---
You can‚Äôt give a man power and expect him not to use it.
---
Le wind noise has arrived
---
You might be in the minority as I have encountered quite a few, letalone the ones that are being posted here on daily basis.
---
the loud as terror radius all of a sudden in your ears will always scare the living shit out of me
---
There are but this ones definitely the sexiest! We love her showing off those curves!
---
i like to meme, yes
---
Kinda same I was rank 17 killer and had 3 rank 15-16 survivors and 1 rank 3 survivor....    I got 4 kills
---
Maybe huntress lullaby could work, but that‚Äôs only for lower ranks.
---
oh wow straight to insults, lovely. i can't figure out one killer strategy but sure better tell me i'm bad at the game instead of giving advice on how to stalk properly. very productive
---
Lol I legit had a survivor yesterday tell me that‚Äôs a cop out excuse for camping the hook
---
This is comforting to read. Luckily I have friends to steward me in the right directions on stuff like this. I'll do 1-2 gens a game myself, depending on how conveniently I can get them. I should probably stop prioritizing them so much and dedicate more focus to looping/unhooking teammates but I just like doing gens more.

*"When Archie MacMillan finally snapped, Evan became his enforcer in what would become known as the worst mass murder in modern history.

There's a lot of toxic players in this game. Don't let it get to you or stop you from playing. The game is amazing. Sorry you experienced this on your first games. Best option is to hide the chat box. At least for now. Be ignorant to their childish comments.
---
Since the Killer is host, there‚Äôs no way to implement this rn, IMO... Once Dedicated Servers roll out, chances are the chat will just stay up until everybody‚Äôs gone anyway
---
\*Sees anything to do with Doctor\* THAT'S A DOWN VOTE
---
I thought that too but then I thought ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not op, I just suck‚Äù
---
Damn he really knocked her up huh?
---
Ok I was wrong thanks for clarifying
---
Had a same matchmaking yesterday, but as a survior rank 9 all others and killer 20. Called me toxic (was not) and left lobby
---
sure thing if you want some xd
---
I tried to be friendly to them once i noticed what was going on, but they didn't figure that out :( I felt so bad killing them...
---
I see there‚Äôs a DC. Classic.
---
Or trapper
---
SAME OMG. It took forever for me to catch on, 'specially since I'm new to the game
---
I did! I felt terrible.
---
Man people like u need to grow some tough skin. Youre competing against other people there are toxic people like this in every game youll ever play
---
Thanks, just felt the need to release and it was either this or buy a new controller in the morning.
---
Blizzard's copyright on "Soon" expired, so they're trying to grab that too now.
---
The real question is, did Amanda actually kill anyone at all? Or did she just abduct them...
---
The older dead by daylight gets, the worse it's lore gets, I like to call this phenomenon McCotes Law.
---
Lots of sad lowlifes who feel the need to put other people down, ignore them.
---
You can still do that
---
Or maybe a time interval between getting stacks. Example: Once a stack is received this perk can not gain another stack within a X seconds.
---
Ayeeee
---
Congrats! I hope you stick around! Just dont go around being those survivors who tea bag at every opportunity just to make the killer feel like he sucks. As a killer main (Yes i realise my flair is Ashy Slashy, but just a huge Evil Dead fan) nothing feels more annoying than a toxic survivor who tea bags just because they feel safe on the other side of a pallet. Have fun in future games. :)
---
It's not a matter of player population, it's simply BHVR not wanting to deal with the hoops they need to jump through to get servers in OCE.  
---
Servers in Australia provide for a large chunk of South East Asia, so it very much isn't a player count issue.
---
Thanks, that's exactly what I wanted to hear. Don't think this is my first contact with them, this is the 5th game in a row (win or lose) that people are being toxic. There's no way around it, I should just stop playing at night when the trolls are out for blood.
---
The comment above was made by anti fun old man gang
---
You should be fine until they put a message in-game about it because it'd be fucked up to assume everyone has been on the forums and whatnot to find out about it.
---
Although knowing it's broken and still using it is a major dick move.
---
Would love some!
---
I was lucky in the fact that I played on ps4 when starting. And there is no chat box. As I'm sure I did plenty of potato things in the early days which would have warranted all the salt from other players. 
---
But even after playing on pc with good experience. You'll always get hate from some players even if you follow all the made up rules etc. 
---
Just play how you want, how you find fun and fuck the rest.
---
Exclusives are fucking boring alresdy there are too many rules and not enough creative room
---
I always spam the vault button, is there some weird technique to get fast vaults when you shouldn't? I think this change is because bhvr just doesn't want fast vaults for specific windows.
---
The perk was super strong and to be honest a nerf wasn't a bad idea but as usual BHVR don't find a middle ground and go too far the other way.
---
Yeah but half the time i look at him it takes a few seconds too long or hes not in the perfect middle of the screen so he still exposes me.
---
8 rank a lot of wu swf
---
I'm counting the traps that she set up herself (the unescapable ones) plus her suffocating Adam to death with a plastic bag and shooting Lynn and then having her head explode by the collar.

Ehhhh it does feel a little bit unsatisfying because you didn't really earn the escape but the tension leading up to it is crazy!

Yeah I got the same this morning. Was a build up to be let down situation...... Pretty much sums up BHVR hahaha.
---
passive phasing is stupid and should be removed
---
Ahh ok. I saw Scottjund not getting it and he said it was because of low settings
---
Yeah me too. Some add ons decrease the range for a cancel. If you are closer it will cancel faster but at the same time the closer you get the more danger you risk. I have a lot of people start to spot me and turn before they cancel it so idk. People arent waiting long enough.
---
Spose you will want to be able to fly next.
---
Touche, You know your shit. Good effort indeed.
---
Or she could be from Louisiana.
---
Damn They nerfed  Ghostface already 
---
/s
---
Welcome to my first attempt at Billy
---
I felt like an ass for not giving hatch after that
---
Everyone in the temple was already sick. She put on a brave and healthy front to create a facade of hope. Even if she hid her illness out of narcissism she stepped up to be a front for people when nobody else could. Everything she did was done to help people which I feel is just as morally sound as Rin and Susie's actions. It isn't her fault the plague was spreading, clearly the illness was already able to spread throughout the temple if she caught it. She even banished herself when the sickness became too bad to continue.
---
I think the same exact problem happens with killers, I don't think they have it any less badly, all of ghostfaces perks are just memes. Thrilling tremors was a POSSIBILE competitor to bbq and chili, but bhvr said NOPE, and neutered it with a completely unnecessary cooldown.
---
Has been suggested a ton but the devs have always said it won‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs too much work, and they like having it on the ‚Äòdefault‚Äô cosmetics for each character
---
Honestly before the news of no more content came out I actually considered F13 to be more fun than dead by daylight.
---
I think there should be something like this implemented full time. Gens and hooks that give more points and increase chance to pip. Would encourage riskier play from both sides sometimes
---
Tokyo subway is way cuter to be honest, it‚Äôs her best cosmetic even if you‚Äôre sacrificing any shred of stealth, it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Nurse and Spirit
---
That can't happen while the lawsuit happens. I know this because this is exactly what happened with F13 the game.
---
THAT HAPPENED TO ME TONIGHT!!!!
---
(Mine was a Jake though)
---
It scared the shit out of me standing at a gen
---
I see what you did there !
---
She is dead. So even if the Entity didn't pick her up she will be your typical vengeful ghost that will hunt people.
---
Only counting the first movie.
---
Anyone that still hates playing against legion is just bad at the game. Legion used to be really unfun because he didn't have any counterplay. Now he does and is a well balanced killer.
---
You're a snacc
---
well said
---
When did the change happened that balanced them?
---
David easily
---
I probably would have bought both if they where fixed, but because the hair was brown in both i just bought one. This is costing behavior money.
---
People keep saying that its THE LOUDEST THING IN THE GAME but it really isnt lol. If I'm working on a gen I'm probably not going to hear a slight breeze in the audio
---
le exposed effect has arrived
---
cat perk\* :3
---
Forums say results will be announced to the winners before July 18th!
---
Blamed for hacking by a rank 19 for playing Freddy. Not like wall hacks are his literal power.
---
Not for half of the things you mentioned
---
The wake up and blades are most likely after they confirms them/fix
---
Spirits doing spirit things I guess yeah with the new survivor head tilting I've made so many people spam their camera out its kinda funny seeing their head fly everywhere
---
I love the amount of hate I get for disliking the legion. I mean most people tend to disconnect vs them even after the Nerf and every single content creator dislikes them from what I can tell besides Farmer John and Tru3. They literally have no character besides Frank and still feel like garbage to play as or play against. I say why I dislike the legion and just get called names or insulted and downvoted. So now I'm just blocking people left and right
---
Wow Nigeria is in Africa!?!? The more you know
---
I'd disagree, if they added her father as a survivor, technically her quest for revenge would already be over from the moment she kills her father once. Not to mention that her father was destined to be a killer.
---
Wake up is the only problem out of those perks.
---
What is the bbq event?
---
I think the specific reason why the entity has chosen them is because they have what it takes to survive the horrors that the killers it has chosen. 
---
Example:
---
Quentin, Laurie, Tapp, Bill, Ash: They were chosen because they have the knowledge and experience to share about the things that are always ready to take their lives.
---
Dwight, Adam: Their lives started horrible but they never let it get to them, instead they become more determined to achieve their goals.
---
Kate?: I have no idea why Kate is even here. Maybe to comfort the others so that they won't loose hope so that the entity could feed more from their emotions?
---
Yeah really. It's been like this for 3years, even after the "positioning changes" it really didn't change anything
---
Btw devour hope is a great perk!!11!3!2!
---
Hexes are strong!!2!2!3!
---
They have to do one thing and they can't do even that..
---
Good, fuck everything about MoM. It made me unable to play m1 killers. It was a skill less perk and was op as all hell. Bhvr needs to stop making second chance perks. I hope they nerf noed and adrenaline next.
---
First Escape always feels great. Welcome to Dead by daylight. Cheers to a thousand more escapes
---
did they buff blood warden?
---
Welcome to DBD, mate. Get used to it.
---
I like the new mettle of man. Yeah, it‚Äôs not as powerful as the pre-nerf ‚ÄúGet out of jail free card‚Äù. But it works well with ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever‚Äù and even though I may not always get MoM off every game, at least you can easily get stacks from WGLF, with the added chance of getting MoM. And, you can easily farm stacks from getting hit by a killer holding a survivor, or doing a ‚ÄúGet Down Mr President‚Äù and take a hit for an injured survivor (May also work well with Empathy, but too lazy to do Claudette)
---
Ban people for using a bug, no its the devs fault they need to fix it or deactivate the perk.
---
Yep. I nearly never play killer so my rank is 20 and it was fun to do my daily and havin 3 rank 2 survivors...
---
Such wisdom. At least you know you're part of the problem. Toxic.
---
Do we know if this stacks like the original?
---
this happened to me earlier today and i was so confused
---
Until you come across and EPIC frame drop and lose them each time you try to blink.
---
You don't need any indicator.
---
It procs? Look for the hex or leave. That's it
---
Give even more info isn't smart, plus you can learn the obvious spots by running small game and slowly getting an idea where they might spawn
---
There is a reason people don't run noed in red ranks.. spoiler it doesn't even proc
---
You gain the option to be unpredictable with hiding hiding, a killer may think you moved onto the next gen, but your hiding in a nearby locker near your abounded gen
---
But those sitting survivors are bad
---
This is what I ran when Thanato got buffed.
---
And still 4th with BP?
---
I think so, purple blade causes it, and I think both purple and green blade amplifies the effect.
---
Survivors: *keeps looping killers basement to try and free a hooked survivor. Doesn‚Äôt leave the area until the survivor dies*
---
Post-game chat: ‚ÄúCamping noob‚Äù
---
*confused screaming*
---
I see your point and all, but TT is hardly a delay perk. It's mostly for the information it gives, knowing exactly which gen is being worked on.
---
No Problem! When you mean Puppy Guarding are you talking Face Camping? Usually people become salty and toxic from most things done in game that are supposed to be done. Camping is a playstyle (that most people don't enjoy as it removes an entire part of being a survivor.) Just play the game as you see fit or as you would like to have played against, i heavily recommend atleast 10 games on each side to get a feel of things for both sides.
---
Exactly as you said.
---
Stealth is not a fun thing to play against. I was playing Doctor, got a really easy 3k and the 4th person took LITERALLY 10 or 15 minutes to find because of how immersed they were. It got to the point I had to just search EVERY locker until I eventually found them, they said they were looking for the hatch and didn't have crows on them so they were moving around the map.
---
It's actually really sad how many people play killer and just don't mind game at all let alone decently and even more sad I'd argue is how many people do not even know how to play their killer well. Like Doctor can shock people before a vault or pallet to make it that they can't vault or slam down a pallet. I would rarely see people ever do it while also respecting every pallet. It's insane to me to be like that and complain that looping is too strong and that stealth should be used.
---
Fuckin RIP my dude.
---
What cosplay? That IS Dwight
---
Shoutout to version 1.0.0 when pallets existed!
---
Ochido Followers: "FUNNY MOMENT! DUUUUDE, BABY KILLER!"
---
Also Plague
---
And Wraith bein like : welp
---
She didn't do it knowingly, did she? She didn't intentionally spread the plague, whereas the other killers killed someone, knowing that they would kill their victim, wether it was out of anger, vengeance, bad decisions or just sadism.
---
Plague was just like, please, I'd do anything to keep living and the entity was like "Aaanythiiing? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)" and then took her into the entity realm, probably tormented her a bunch until she started killing people.
---
you ok dude? you can still do that you know?
---
Just like ebonys right.

Killer lost connection, right?

I want to mess with her üò©

Amazing cosplay. That shirt looks like it was taken directly from the game.
---
How do you change he colours of the perks?
---
The ash ones are a tribute to Ash vs. evil dead
---
As stated in behind the scenes videos they wanted to make ghostface their own since they only bought use of the mask. They have a total of what 4 outfits for ghostface? That‚Äôs pretty good considering they don‚Äôt have as much to work with as other killers. I‚Äôm assuming the mask has to stay like that for reasons so it‚Äôs really only his outfit they can do something with.
---
It‚Äôs a line from the first *Matrix* movie.

hillbilly has the ability to sprint at the speed of a car while carrying 2 medium to large sized weapons through raw talent,
---
how did you get the shirt to look like it came from the game? did you use paints? water? care to explain?
---
Can someone explain why people dont like these mains? Is it bc wake-up, dead hard, and claudettes ability to blend in?
---
good players don't cleanse against her, making both her tracking and pressure useless, but giving her chase potential instead.
---
Snapped a leg on a beartrap, did not even escape the beartrap before my doom was sealed :(

Newer player here, someone fill me in on what BBQ event is?

Is it the opportunity for us to get BBQ&amp;C? I‚Äôve been tempted to shell out the $5 for leather face lmao
---
It's such bad sportsmanship :(
---
please explain why people think Pig isn't the best female killer again? Highest confirmed body count, best stun noise and the only one that is in movies.
---
legion hates mainly came from his pre-reworked state because of how exploitable his power was. He was the king at tunneling survivors through Frenzy allowing him to drain a survivors deep wound with no counterplay. 
---
Even after the rework though some survivors hate playing against Legion for multiple reasons;
---
- Survivors will spend most of the round injured due to his power. As a result they have to deal with the constant pressue of being insta-downed combined with the constant sound of the survivors grunting.
---
- Mending is really tedious as its basically 15 to 20 seconds of holding M1. Since Legion can really easily hit survivors, survivors can sink a solid minute or more into mending in a match which may irritate them.
---
Holy shit. Dude you rock!
---
Well what else would be fitting lmao? "Wraith killed his boss and then he found a mystical wailing bell which makes him invisible, but also deformed his body. The Fog then came and took him" That's so much worse than the original lore where the entity kidnaps them, gives them special abilities and tortures those unwilling into submission.
---
Day one player of F13 here, the games been dead for about a year now, DbD won a long time ago.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be in this subreddit otherwise, DbD has filled the horror game shaped hole in my heart that Friday left
---
While I agree that they aren't good... Survivors can totally reveal GF in chases, what are you talking about?
---
Didn‚Äôt even know there was a mobile
---
I'm pretty new with Reddit and this is like my first art that I have posted so I hope you guys like it!
---
Yea my 2 mains Mike/leather face are both campers wich makes me sad
---
Wow such skill./s
---
tbh I bought F13 and was not impressed lol. It was the same thing over &amp; over again, and the OG killer (the mom) wasn't playable.
---
I used to run both, way back in the day. It was baller.
---
Depends if ghosts even exist in the normal world. She could have moved on to the afterlife or ceased to exist completely, but the entity got her before that
---
doesn't have to be rainbow
---
I used it once by accident, realized it was trash, and haven't touched it since. BHVR destroying any decent perk one after the other.
---
Ah that‚Äôs unlucky apparently there was a huntress and Myers cosplay there as-well but I didn‚Äôt run into them ah well.
---
Nurse would like a word with you.
---
Also that number is a little bit in accurate

And there was no offerings or perks like BBQ that gave you extra points. We players from the beginning put up with all this and that's why we will always deserve and flaunt our legacy skins.
---
I'm pretty sure he was able to do so before the update.
---
Okay, maybe DC right before the hook happens. No bbq for leather today
---
*I think we did a pretty good job so far*
---
"How dare you camp when it's obvious someone is about to go for the unhook!"
---
Use to be: Your acute senses are on high alert. When the Killer performs the break action within¬†12/24/36metres¬†of range, the Killer's Aura is revealed to you for¬†6 seconds. This effect can only be triggered once every¬†60/45/30seconds.
---
But now it's: Your acute senses are on high alert. When the Killer performs a break action, the Killer's Aura is revealed to you for¬†3/4/5seconds.
---
Before it was pretty much useless because you already knew where the killer was 99% of the time in those cases because of the terror radius.
---
BBQ has only appeared twice in almost two years; I wouldn't count on the shrine
---
U forgot the locker
---
First time I‚Äôve generally been upset with a perk change, DS I agreed with, it was broken, it‚Äôs amazing now, borrowed time protecting both players was broken, it‚Äôs fine now,
---
But mettle is just unusable now, it needs to changed, rather but it to 5 hits instead of three, or make it safe unhooks only, protection hits don‚Äôt register half the time,
---
I had no clue coloured hair spray was pretty much dye, I probably should have used that instead of easily washed off sfx dirt for my Dwight shirt üòÇ
---
A few more things
---
Every 2-window building or junglegym was an infinite when run correctly
---
You could fast vault from a walking speed by holding shift, and at any angle
---
Vaults had a vacuum effect on the survivor pulling them in faster than the killers lunge speed
---
Pallet stun hitboxes were YUGE, you could get hit on the corner edge at a distance
---
Killers attacks bounced off windows, didn't go through them
---
Small game highlighted all the trappers traps in range, at all times
---
Hooks and traps were permanently sabo'd
---
Bloodlust didn't exist, long chases didn't have an end until the survivor made a mistake or the killer forced one or left to pressure gens
---
Wraith did not get his speedboost out of cloak, that was an addon
---
Billy could steer twice as well by using the mouse + arrowkeys or a controller.
---
Adrenaline healed two full states, and exhaustion did not exist
---
u/Niolent
---
Genuinely lmao imagine taking it that seriously
---
More fun yes, the aneurism inducing bugs with each ‚Äòupdate‚Äô or major patch is still the same although not as bad but that‚Äôs subjective as others you‚Äôll see find the current wake up bug unbearable and have to off themselves while people like myself can live until Tuesday.
---
A lot of things implemented are questionable, the excuses for not fixing the DC epidemic after all these years is inexcusable and them needing dedicated servers is very telling of priorities/money /state of the game. 
---
If the game was as amazing as people make it out to be and had MMO active numbers with cosmetics I would be worried why they lack the tools to take care of crippling stuff like the DC‚Äôs but it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs either about money or just flat out incompetence from the devs. 
---
It seems  there is a delicate balance they are trying to maintain, server upkeep to keep them running is not cheap and then they brought in more staff to help in different departments  hence why they keep dropping cosmetics so everyone can still get paid.
---
I brought up their priorities as  a concern because with the state of the game I don‚Äôt think eating  resources on a ‚Äòanniversary party event‚Äô  was a profitable choice for game balance. New games are around the corner when all that time organizing for the anniversary could‚Äôve been spent bringing dedicated servers SOONER if not with the ghostface release. 
---
With that said I conclude that I don‚Äôt really think the game is going to die anytime soon, it‚Äôs incredibly unique in the horror multiplayer genre and has iconic killers that a lot of older generations will relate with bringing new and old gamers together, and the adrenaline rush from saving friends or running from the killer or playing as the killer is a incredible feeling that CAPITALIZES on that dopamine rush for replay value.
---
Gameplay?  With addons and perks that are unique it is hard to have perfect balance in a 4v1 without making one side stronger than the other.
---
I haven‚Äôt been amazed by a new perk since BBQ and WGLF and that‚Äôs just because of the BP gain, it made matches tolerable where you would get 8k back to back from being camped.

Dude no problem, Ive legit lost track of time. Yeah the last kinda big thing I drew I just posted to the reddit like yesterday, didnt turn out how I like it, but I could really tell how I improved, especially like, the hands, they're so hard but it took me not nearly as long as it used to
---
A small price to pay for salvation...
---
It is real, is coming this year and you can pre-register here https://www.mobile.deadbydaylight.com
---
I'm All Ears is very useful - if you get into a chase with high mind game potential, you can see exactly which direction the survivor is looping and nullify their mind game. For example if a survivor vaults a window or pallet and fakes a direction, you can tell they've done it and circle back the other way to get a hit.
---
I play both sides and i have since i started i have 1199 hours lol, not bragging im embarassed, im not having trouble either but i can recognise that dbd is ironically a game about 1 powerful killer vs 4 people on paper but in game is 4 powerful survivors working around 1 killer.
---
I still don't have a single clue what the icon of that perk is suppost to be
---
Its weird though because plague is the same except they cant heal yet they dont get upset st plague.
---
go watch the movies, he cried in few parts and this drawing is the refrence to the 2nd Haloween movie. ;)
---
Its never changed, been this way since the beginning.
---
Just a lil bit.
---
He‚Äôs always been able to do this, do people not play as doctor ?
---
Religion can be quite dangerous.
---
Probably a dumb question, but did you run out of the exit then back in to see if that would pick up you trying to escape?
---
Yup that's clearly Wellsobard doing his morning Zoomies
---
Cant happen until either dedicated servers or until people stop telling killers to kill themselves.
---
It won't be linked at all I pre registered a few days ago when they announced it on twitter. 
---
I can't imagine it to be very good tbh but I can't wait to try it out. 
---
I wonder how much it will cost?
---
Billy counterplay: drop a banana skin somewhere.
---
I like how there is an hour between your replies.
---
At this point how do we know that the entity isn't actually the good guy? Kidnapping inexperienced killers and trapping them forever so that they can't affect the outside world, and giving them a false sense of purpose so they do not wish to go back? Is the trial just...gasp...a simulation? Is the entity's long term goal a safer world?
---
I feel like NOED and adrenaline should need skill to activate. Like you need a certain amount of hooks to have NOED be active when gates are powered or have a certain amount of chase time to activate adrenaline when the gens are finished
---
Gloriously more balanced than it ever was, every patch brings more balance to the game (besides bugs), yet its still ever so slightly unbalanced still.
---
Cant express enough just how disgusting the game was in the early days, it was an absolute joke.
---
I remember playing as Doc and going into treatment mode so a slugged survivor would get to tier-3.
---
Her revenge would be killing him, again and again, until all eternity.
---
I think that would fit the entities promise and would also follow the lore of vengeful spirits well.
---
I don't use it with a mean intention \^\_\^
---
Guys. Can we just admit that this is a problem and it needs to be fixed? Instead of tearing each other down? Were both killers and survivors here, were both here to have fun and enjoy the game. And when something's broken it ruins the experience for Everyone. Simple as that.
---
except protection hits are still buggy as ever and you're lucky to get a single token, and that's with throwing the match tailing chases and trying to get it activated
---
wastes a perk slot
---
For real tho
---
I play on PS4 too usually takes 5 -10 min to find a game as killer
---
I've been experiencing that as well.
---
I would buy this instantly if this was in game 10/10
---
Caught this during an impromptu farming game. This is insane. How could this sort of thing slip by the devs?!
---
Since i bought Ghostface i have only managed to get 1 game with him.
---
The waiting times are a joke!
---
I heared it will be free, of course its not confirmed. We'll see when it launches.
---
Should we tell them?
---
Confirmed to be free, I smell some life system that regenerates every hour or something.
---
That would be amazing.

---
you need 3 protection hits to activate it, and protection hits are currently very inconsistent to register because BHVR, per usual, doesn't understand, despite people repeatedly pointing it out, when their game is bugged, and will never fix the problem until one of their devs embarrass themselves in another "play with the devs" event
---
Furtive Chase is broken with Freddy
---
Yeah I was playing huntress and my hatchet went right through someone's chest and it was kyf and they were like "hAhA yOuR sO bAd LoL"
---
Abusing the bug is a player's fault dude.
---
There are still plenty of players using MoM, and they have adapted to it's new requirement of taking protection hits to activate it by body-blocking killers trying to hook their teammates. For once, Mad Grit is actually a useful perk to have on-hand because of this change to MoM that encourages hook body-blocking, and I've been having a blast with it on Legion, GF, and Doctor this past week.
---
Also if the killer is running a specific perk(one of The Pigs',can't remember which) it lowers the time for the beartrap to come back.
---
dude :joy: the game is more than that and we all know it
---
I don't know if this is serious or shitpost
---
There's quite a lot of people like this guy I've found out recently, it's crazy.
---
Well done! Small thing that may help you out, hatch never spawns next to the boundary walls.
---
Even the EGC wouldn't be hard to implement, just make it slow down like when a survivor is hooked/downed. No need to literally make the entire second half of her power removed once the last gen is complete.
---
She is a grudge spirit in short.
---
It‚Äôs obviously just latency, jeez.
---
He starts to struggle without Ruin around rank 4, in my experience, but he has amazing potential
---
But when it works it's worth it
---
Well it's useful in my build and I get max score
---
That's fine, I won't ever get to rank 4 haha. 
---
I play for fun rather than ranks :-D
---
Can confirm for Xbox too

I mean, it is pretty damn loud. Akin to the spirit's vacuum noises.

Oh, don't get me wrong, he's fun. It's just less fun playing him against SWF groups who tryhard

PS4 - for some reason I'm unable to get 4 bbq stacks with teir 3 bbq since ghost face patch.
---
Am i the only one with this bug?
---
Hmm I got adept David yesterday
---
It still appears if you buy it with auric cells but if you buy the dlc it won't appear
---
The first couple of times you play this game are among the best a game can hope to offer to anyone. The sheer amount of fear and an adrenaline going inside you is absurd.
---
Wraith and Nurse
---
The issue is I didn't know which country it was since it was never stated. I never said he wasn't African, i'm aware he's from Africa. That's like just saying David is from Europe or Feng is from Asia, it's not a specific country.
---
You may have already figured this out but it's an offering not add-on
---
I've always thought the same, personally but I wasn't sure.
---
The survivors were animals...so I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them!
---
Yeah I know it's a offering but forgot
---
Streamers as in serpentine. I think the icon is just 2 bloody serpentines.
---
Yeah it's probably fixed but now...."Wake up" super op ayyyyyy
---
I have dlc on my console ugh I wish I could transfer it mobile looks to be too trash to buy killers/survivors on
---
Doctor is only from America if i am correct.
---
Wraith moved to the states, and I know he's from Africa but it was never specified where from Africa he's from therefor I couldn't put the flag. Most replies are telling me Nigeria.
---
There ya have it. They've made their statement. They've said it before that they do add tools into the game to see how matches are being played out, not too long ago they released graphs about perks, killers, survivors, chase times, etc.
---
I'm sure their reasoning not to go public is that they don't want more players to know about it as it will be harder to determine who's abusing and who just has the perk equited.
---
I once thought that too, but I kept playing Hillbilly way back in the day and next thing I knew, I was red ranks.  Find someone you're comfortable with and you'll start advancing rather quickly.
---
cries in nea
---
It's been pretty much the same thing for me. I mainly play killer and it puts me against much higher-ranked survivors typically in a survive with friends group. But whenever I play Survivor I'll go against the killer of my rank and have a team of rank 20s or noobs playing their first match ever. Screws me over and probably ruins the game for those new players.
---
Perma sabo, 20 second cooldown sprint burst, killers dropping powers, 115% nurse... the game is so much better than before.
---
When i play killer I would gladly give up all my bbq stacks to see a survivor DC. If i'm not playing scummy stuff like Basement Bubba, making someone so salty they DC is a sign of pride.
---
I don't usually care about cosplays but I can't dismiss one about the one and only. Great job.
---
Knowing how lazy they are with these events, i'm gonna say yes.
---
Maybe a mixture of all 4, with a slight sprinkle of the toxic tea-bagging survivor. That's what it feels like, anyway. If a toxic survivor was a killer, they'd be GF.
---
As a quentin main i say better safe then sorry mori away
---
I think it is a bug, but I wouldn't be suprised if the devs nerfer this aswell...
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug, you still get 4 tokens but only 3 will show up.
---
At the time I played with 3 other people, we didnt know teachable were a thing, and getting high blood webs were really hard so we all went different people, I was claudette and with botany knowledge I ran around healing people and my friend who went meg took killer chases haha
---
You can actually just take a picture irl then photoshop a Dwight.png and it would still looks the same.
---
Was about to explain why this would be a terrible idea and how a lot of the time EGC isn't really killer sided but then I read the last bit and realised who you are and yeah, I agree. Oink got done dirty for her endgame builds (although you can still do it with DH before the last gen pops but it's much more risky).
---
This happens on Xbox too, didn‚Äôt know pallet/gen stomps fixed it, only picking up another survivor
---
Holy shit
---
If you have it, i'd run either Thrilling Tremors or, alternatively, Corrupt Intervention to stop generator progression. Pop goes the Weasel for regression is good too. I'd swap out Thanatophobia or Sloppy.
---
Well once we get dedicated servers devs can‚Äôt use that as a excuse
---
true, but I used run it because I could find out which direction he is coming from.
---
Rule Set No. 2 in her base kit sounds amazing, but would be extremely difficult to deal with on some maps.  I've used it in the hospital before (and had it used on me) and I've had people literally give up on trying to remove them because they couldn't find the boxes.
---
Nurse has the largest and most inconsistent hitbox in the game. I got hit many times by nurse when I am behind her back. 
---
Some people argue that it is due to lag but I am not 100% convinced. When I play nurse, I get ridiculous hits where the survivor is not even on my screen.
---
I almost downvoted you until I got to the end. Hope others make it that far. Agree with your point completely. If anything just extend EGC for trials where Pig is killer.
---
Idk I still very much have my doubts they will ban this unless they give a statement in game telling ppl to just not use the perk like they did with legion blades and on that note legion blades are fucked again as well for whatever reason. I still doubt they will do anything for the perk since they never did anything with wraiths using sloppy and tinker being fucked but it‚Äôs more of a we will see thing I guess
---
omg cute
---
By that logic shouldn't hag and legion be able to just be pushed over by someone like Dave?
---
I hoped people would react like that, if you look at it like this you think it is insane, then you realise Pig got killed like this already.
---
The Clown is definitely my favorite character, just not my favorite killer. He's got one of the better lore-backgrounds and I really like his design, voice, etc, but he's also boring and uninteresting to play and not particularly good either. If I wasn't main the Spirit, I'd be maining Myers, because I feel like those are the two best mechanically designed killers in the game.
---
I also get this message and i noticed  i dont gain or loose ranks at all.
---
 Latina is 10/10, I wanna day that first so it‚Äôs clear that it me great, BUT your face says ‚Äú hungry‚Äù more than it does ‚Äú scared‚Äù
---
I think i don't gain or loose myself either. It's like the game just forgets that you pipped or not. It's weird.
---
Don't forget the vomiting/sick noises.
---
Wraith has a lot more than 1 kill.
---
The first escape is always the hardest escape. Keep playing and have fun.
---
If you include her unwinnable traps, her count goes up a bit
---
They should go for a middle point between then and now. Pallets should regenerate overtime if the killer isn't stunned by it, we should be able to buy our perks specifically instead of bloodweb, and bloodweb should be removed.
---
The even isn‚Äôt over until July 2nd. You‚Äôre probably just getting unlucky as I have gotten some cakes today.
---
Ma boy just past the game üò≥
---
unwinnable traps should definitely be included because even though jigsaws philosophy is flawed and makes little to no sense at most times, if someone was capable they were able to escape
---
God I hope so. Maybe my killer queues won't be 10+ minutes anymore.
---
True, a lot of exploits do happen in the game. But say they do ban players, that's bad for the devs, that means less players, banned players will not buy cosmetics or DLC, it's a loss for them that they want to avoid. It may be fixed, maybe not, who knows?  
---
As a survivor main, I don't play to ultimately win or to make the killer feel bad, there's no fun in that at all. With that said, if you (the killer) see players abusing this camp them, sandbag / slug them, do what it takes to deter them from using the exploit, it's a poor excuse that the players have to do some damage control, but it's all we got. Hopefully with servers coming the devs will have a switch on their end where they can disable killers, perks,  add-ons, cosmetics, etc. should something like this happen again. (Much how League of Legends will disable champions that are bugged, until a hotfix comes in).
---
It‚Äôs still ridiculous if they do. Banned for using a perk....that‚Äôs the absolute state of dbd. How about you stop breaking the fucking game? Or at least disable anything that is broken, rather than letting people run riot with broken perks/items causing mischief, and then having to ban a number of your playerbase.
---
Also do I get compensated if the killer doesnt drop me after I hit my DS and it doesnt work?
---
 **Nice and Sexy Guy David‚Ñ¢**
---
yeah, i noticed that there is more teamwork and that they don't rush to unhook people in front of the killer in higher ranks. but the killers are more or less the same, only difference is they can predict movement paths and know the lunge distance.
---
I saw someone similar in leagueoflegends subreddit where this one girl had an obsession with one of the champions in that game (Lux) and would literally mention their hatred of other guy champs that she would get shipped with. For two years non stop.
---
It's not over. I have received minimal cakes. I have spent over a million points and have only received 4 cakes. I have received more bloody party streamers. My friends have all had the same issues. I guess.webare all just unlucky with the rng of the blood webs
---
Thank fuck for that last little note you left there, I thought you'd gone insane. XD
---
RIP Pig, 2018-2019.
---
Huntress is probobly the most experiensed fighter. She killed a bunch of army boios.
---
We must learn how to adapt. We must to use other perks for our gimmick end game builds. We must be an example for all the others, so we can get one step closer to ending Quentin abuse!
---
"Babby Dwieght ohn tha genny"
---
you can still see what gens have been touched tho
---
the rest can be ignored. people won't touch totems near the killer or hide in lockers. vault points are the only real thing she might see, but must of the time people go around anyway
---
R e p a i r
---
They still will be, ever since tuesday of last week, Killer queques have been long
---
Again though, survivors are meant to be the weaker side since there are 4 of them. Therefore the perks should be weaker too. By the very nature of the game their perks are going to be weaker than what killers get.
---
Killer meta is still pretty much enduring, spirit fury, bbq, ruin, noed, with a few more mixed in here and there.
---
The old survivor perks are still really powerful. Its hard for them to introduce new perks along those lines because when they do with perks like MoM, it breaks the game. Hell even Deliverance can be nasty if all 4 have it.
---
Mate mate mate, no one hates you for disliking Legion, absolutely not. People find you fucking weird when you have numerous comments hating on Joey on particular "because omg they ship HIM with my girl FENG" and it's absolutely creepy. Also keep blocking people because they disagree with you. You're a fucking sociopath
---
Ya agreed hopefully they will have a system in place and ya banning them without a warning would be one stupid move and would sorta backfire on them in the end even if it is just a temp ban cause like you said ppl would just not buy shit. I honestly just think the devs should feel a little big embarrassed if I‚Äôm being honest like how did they fuck legion and wake up when that was not even the changes lol
---
So how is it considered an event if you have to play as much as you usually would in order to receive something special? Thank you for responding, I guess I‚Äôll just go back to my other games. Things like this and other changes is why I wasted money.
---
AH NO! stop it! too swary &gt;M&lt;
---
Is it tho? 4 Hooks usually means Entity displeased or atleast it feels that way. Sometimes its brutal killer.
---
Those jukes tho! üòÇ
---
"The fuck am I supposed to do, *let you* unhook them?"
---
"Yes?..."
---
*Myers and Entity look at each other as if to say 'are you goddamn shitting me,' then turn back to the Survivors*
---
"...Okay that's it: endless Tier 3 with Tombstone, you're all getting Mori'd for your stupidity."
---
One of your level 1 survivors.
---
That's eerie! I experienced something similar just now, got redirected to a blank page too. Although mine was completely blank, no perks or anything.
---
I like how all of the comments are in favor of what I said but I still got karma bombed .\_.
---
You shouldn't have to try and time something really hard to be able to have a power in the end.
---
At least the pig has 2 abilities, she's one of the few, or only one that can say that :)
---
That was hard to watch. Not because of Tru3. But damn. He predicted almost everything (talk about skill), but didnt get rewarded. And then just to be teabagged.

Wow what an amazing cosplay!

Hangman's trick
---
GOD PLEASE WIN
---
100% agree, it's really sad when the final gen pops and you've still got a trap or two.
---
I had an idea awhile back where altruistic actions (healing/unhooking) would start your timer so at the very least you could use traps to deter people from unhooking/healing eachother at the end game.
---
Right, you can't see who DC's when asked for punishment of DCers, but also "please don't report it, we can track it automatically". And now you can apparently see who's using a perk while also being able to tell who's using it to abuse it, and not just cause they always use it?
---
I think those guys just don't want to deal with reports tbh.
---
I'm sad ghostface is here now. As a pig player, it's almost impossible to sneak up on survivors at this point in time, they all look to much at their surroundings
---
No it has a lot of other bugs for me, but crashing isn't one of them. Playing on PS4.
---
did anyone else read this as "I am the *wind baby".* Like hes an infant made out of air
---
This has happened to me twice now on PS4 (last two matches) will have to try the running off the map thing next time
---
This makes me want an actual kill count according to lore for each killer.
---
But... Jason sadly won at the end of Freddy vs Jason didn't he? So this is fake! All hail to the new king, F13 (who is still dealing with the legal issues) as in like 15 years from now, we're all gonna be playing F13 because the devs of DBD didn't manage to balance the game.
---
To be fair, I would do anything vomit queen told me to do too.
---
it'd be a stupid idea even if you told me "when there's one survivor remaining"
---
"after last gen pop" is so fucking dumb I can't imagine how you had enough braincells to ever type sentences down
---
You almost have to wonder if the same fate happened to lisa.
---
"when the last gen pops" lol
---
"when there's one survivor remaining" would be slightly acceptable, yet still a stupid idea
---
Huntress is very good at camping, she just stand with a hatchet winded up and you're not rescuing anyone. Plague doesn't slow the game down, she is the most genrushable killer in the game because nobody wastes time on healing. She's also pretty easy to play to be honest. Puke'n'smash. Hag has great chase potential if you have your traps set. Also IMO Hag is the best camper in the game, she can camp while not even camping. If Wraith has good camping potential, Pig does as well. Doctor doesn't slow the game down too much imo. Unless you're talking about 3 gen strat... But that shit is cancer :D Also he has no chase effectiveness and 0 map pressure. Freddy has great tracking, he has literally wallhacks and he is completely invisible so hiding survivors don't even know who they are hiding from(I mean, they know it's Freddy but they can literally crouch into him when trying to hide).

PS4 I‚Äôm waiting about 15-20 minutes for a killer match which is frustrating as I don‚Äôt have Ghostface, I just have all Killer dailies. Even swapping them out just gave me Killer dailies.   
---
I feel like Devs could make all the dailies Survivor ones so at least those trying to play GF will take a break and do the dailies (maybe) (at least there would be less people playing killer just to do dailies)

That‚Äôs actually really creative

It doesn't make her tracking useless. Infected survivors are the most loud thing in the world and Dwights, say goodbye to lockers(I know nobody uses lockers).

His*
---
God dammit. this post will be right back
---
I play a lot of her \^\_\^ Her main problem is she is very vulnerable to genrush because nobody heals(nobody uses selfcare which consumes a lot of time)

I have alot of people i can pay for art, that is why i try, TRY to find someone that wanna help for free, seek and maybe you will find

It is completely inaudible at normal volume levels. You have to really crank up all volumes and risk blowing your eardrums.

My friends have recently been saying sly comments to me saying ‚Äúcamper‚Äù and I always reply with this. They always say yes I should because I should give them a chance, whilst the next person who plays killers plays with 0 mercy and just kills us all. No they didn‚Äôt use the basement but they could have.
---
That's what I had to do, it was hard as hell
---
Sleepy boi finally gettin some love
---
Wait what just happened
---
Omg my heart is crying rn why did you... Oh God poor babies oh God it must felt terrible to do such thing oh God (ps I'm not making fun of any newbie, but newer players who don't actually know what to do or what perk to use actually make me feel bad when I kill them, I always try to farm if the game is going too bad for them)
---
Wake up, Play with your food, BBQ, WGLF, Sprint Burst, Legion's blades, crashing Plague, silent chainsaw Billy... Bugged by daylight :D
---
I would like a restriction to Billy's chainsaw use implemented throughout the entire game not just EGC. 
---
I would also like a little rework on my beloved Piggy. I don't know what would work. But I feel she has been punished too much.
---
Maybe more Jigsaw boxes would be a good start. 7 maybe? It's far too quick and easy to get them off even  with the better add ons that increase difficulty. As a survivor against pig I usually get it off in the first or second attempt, which takes very little time and effort, and even if I have to go round all 4 it has rarely been a problem doing so as poor Piggy is concentrating on gens.
---
I've thought about giving Piggy more reverse bear traps as well. Considering how easy it is to get them off. 
---
I really think could be more fun/interesting is if RBT's could not be removed until a certain point in the game. Neither Jigsaw boxes or RBT's would activate until that time, let's say when 1 gen is left as an example, then THE REAL GAME begins.
---
Any survivor who has a RBT on could also receive a small penalty to action speed until THE GAME begins. Or alternatively all survivors could receive a cumulative action speed penalty for the total number of RBT's fitted (1-4).
---
Once THE GAME has commenced action speed penalties could maybe be removed. survivors have a choice. Wait for everyone to remove their RBT's or do that last gen and get the hell out. Doing the last gen could maybe also increase the RBT timer for survivors still wearing them. Or maybe an increase in skill checks and their difficulty.
---
Just some thoughts off my head of course. Don't shoot me :). What do you think?
---
lmao and I really thought this was a visual bug bc I run wake up a lot lately O\_O thanks for letting me know xD
---
Both sleepy bois should get some lovin'. Freddy is fun af and Quentin has them big old hands, and who doesn't love them big old hands?
---
A lot of ultra-rare addons are just meme builds addons, so i Amanda's letter. You have to burn The game/Lery's offering if ur using that and just jumpscare the shit out of survivors. But I think the range should be way wider.
---
Yeah, I feel they could‚Äôve done A LOT with focusing on the game rather than celebrating! I mean, I get the part that celebrates lives up the game especially in the eyes of those who stopped playing.
---
So they have to do a gen and they can see boxes, easy as this.
---
It's obviously a bug. It's inaudible and it's widespread. Maybe you stop flaming and make an attempt to decipher if what someone else is experiencing is a bug.
---
This does make the game unplayable, contrary to what you claimed.
---
Yes. He's a great slugger
---
Permanent Sabotage? Damn that must‚Äôve been a nightmare for the killers
---
That tbag at the end from the Jake who got stabbed a billion times
---
Same for me, started playing when it became free in PS4 (PS Plus) and I always thought it‚Äôs a ripoff from Friday The 13th but boy was I wrong.. DBD is 100 times better than Friday the 13th imo
---
Ok no problem then 
---
Editing post
---
good players also avoid hiding so...
---
A killer can only pick up the survivor like 3-4 times. After that it stuns the killer so the survivor can pretty much get breathing room.
---
Hag is great in chases tho. just up a trap and they have to leave the loop and find a next one
---
Reupload since the title was wrong before.
---
But the EGC timer ran out, why didn‚Äôt the survivor die?
---
Isn‚Äôt the huntress known for killing a butt load of soldiers? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a number there somewhere
---
you didn't expect that. what are you gonna do now?
---
You can't make it so you can't find a key in the first box with how her traps work right now. With the current system I would make it so you have to find two parts of a key and two parts of the same key cannot spawn in the same box. It would force survivors to search at least two boxes without completely changing the coding. Another buff to Pig I think should be implemented is making Hex: Huntress Lullaby apply to boxes as well. This perks is really risky to take so make it at least more rewarding. Making Hex: The third seal apply to boxes would be completely broken so let's leave it as it is(altough it would be really fun).  
---
Her addons are so bad, it's true... The "best" one is Amanda's Secret, who tf thought it's a good idea...
---
Made a new one check it out. Or don't. I'm not the reddit police, My dad is.

you only have to buy licensed killers/survivors with real money, the rest you can buy with shards in other words with playtime.

---
This is super cool I love it!!
---
Been happening to me for at least a month before the event
---
I think it was lag on the killers connection because the ECG timer is supposed to stop when he picks up the survivor and it doesn‚Äôt look like it did so I just think there was a delay
---
Happened to me last night, fell off the map and got teleported back in. I opened the other exit gate and it still wouldn‚Äôt let me escape. The whole game was messed up from the doctor. I couldn‚Äôt self care, couldn‚Äôt dead hard, the progress bars weren‚Äôt showing any progress being done, couldn‚Äôt recover on the ground, and couldn‚Äôt wiggle either. Doctor went from a 2k to a 4k because of not being able to escape.
---
Bloodhound has a different purpose. It counters experienced survivors from juking you
---
Tbh Sad thing is that i never ever ever buy a Killer Skin...
---
I dont buy skins if i cant see them myself while playing. Thats why i only buy skins for survivors.
---
Seems like you stopped reading to soon...
---
What if they add the killer from my bloody valentine?
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse doesn't work in chases tho, and that's precisely when I need my FOV on Nurse
---
DID YOU HAVE FUN? In the right top corner makes me laugh
---
I really like this, Pig's addons are so shitty no one uses Amanda's secret or even the letter because they have so many negative effects
---
Impressive
---
The running off the edge of the map thing isn't working, the glitch is a little different this time from how it has been in the past. If you run off it just plops you right back on the edge where you jumped. The only way I've been able to get out when this happens is hatch.
---
I'd go for nea for balanced landing instead, or feng for lithe, they're overall better and give you more control
---
Must hook the Dweet.
---
How about you stop using perk, that you know for a fact is bugged? If you exploit the bug, you should be banned, no matter how much it is their fault. You chose to exploit the bug again and again, ruining the game for others and you should be punished for it.
---
Nearly forgot, you can see her other art @vgu780 and maybe bug her to make the hag keychain WHICH SHE FORGOT! totally not salty.
---
I can't believe how many offerings Me and this group of survivors brought to the game, we nearly hit 1M BP in just one game.
---
Get on our level scrubs!
---
there is a good site which is not 100% accurate but a good starting point to see which perks are good:  [https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/) 
---
in general self care from claudette level 40 is one of the best survivor perks for everyone in general.
---
These are awesome. Are these for sale please?
---
I was against Shape. The killer was very nice and apologised, telling me that falling off the map fixed it for him but clearly not for you. I was going to try that but was more interested in what the collapse would do. That sucks for you though, killer pog I suppose ahaha.
---
Honestly since the change so that you can't recover from exhaustion while running, I really feel like this is how sprint burst SHOULD work
---
Pretty good job right here
---
It's the big 3 year anniversary which is a make or break for the future of the game.
---
And its Behavior.
---
Did you expect anything less?
---
I'm for it but only if their stun noise is the whole 'backstory' text
---
Yeah I wanted to see what would happen if I fell off and was in the air as the collapse happened. It just teleported me back inside and then did the sacrifice animation.  :/
---
Yup yup
---
Shes finding a way to sell them. But it could be a while.
---
Correct about tbagging. It's done at a spot a killer cant hit you, usually vault spots. Bming a survivor would be tbagging or pointing at their hooked body and not helping. I cant really think of another way to bm you team. Failing a skillcheck on purpose, fast vaulting by them, purposely leading the killer to them is actually called sandbagging. So anything to be disrespectful is BM. Anything to hurt their chances of winning on purpose is sandbagging. Hope that helps.
---
Could she do them on eBay or something like that? I would be really interested in a couple of these.
---
I'm at rank 3 on xbox... Whenever I tried to bodyblock for MoM killers were smart and just dropped the survivor. Killers won't even hit for me running behind a healthy survivor.
---
Unbreakable?
---
I'm constantly waiting for a fourth. In the waiting time I'm reading chapters of Misery, and I've decided Annie Wilkes would be a good killer.
---
they can't. I played tons of games and the survivor i was chasing couldn't reveal me once.
---
10/10
---
Oh my, I can immagine the clown pretendig to strike survivors and they actually bleed out, it would be so cool
---
That is true, but performing flashlight saves for an instance against Plague when the entire team is infected is quite imposible. You have no oppurtunity to position yourself.
---
Instant heal you cannot counter as killer with a 5 second sprint burst assuring the escape, and the requirement is all the gens getting done in a meta when they can be finished in 5 minutes. This is the problem with it. Due to the insane rate gens are done with little you can do unless you are a certain killer kinda removes all interaction from the end game. And compared to noed you can make sure it wont activate while you need the survs to be bad for adreneline not to activate (except if you are a nurse main)
---
Nah
---
Impossible shitface
---
Same! I get grabed of Gens by a Trapper cause I just hear nothing :/
---
Could you explain how the teachables work? Like I have sprint burst so now should that come up in the bloodweb's of other survivors even from level 1?
---
I would argue that Hell is the worst place for any innocent soul and that Entity taken them just to endlessly torture and feed off, given zero fuck how innocent or not they are.
---
If there was a killer named amnesia, it better he from amnesia the game

I don't know if I'd say wraith was experienced. I mean, he did technically kill them, but he didn't kill them like the entity wants him to, so he's pretty much starting fresh in regards to dbd kills.
---
It doesn't depend on player's role. So it's safe to say that some players are completely fucking picks
---
Same honestly it's annoying
---
Yeah fckn right. All he does is talk about game balance, usually when he starts losing.
---
She could but it's more of getting enough for each killer.
---
Please tell me there were no Dwights harmed in this match.
---
Ahh ok cool. That is such a shame mate. The spirit huntress and pig are epic. I just don't like the plague as a character haha.
---
P3 looks good so it's worth other then the knife
---
oh lag switch time
---
lol idk what it is about him. i used to really enjoy watching his streams, but i can barely get through half a match before i have to stop. :( seems like a cool guy.
---
also i can really recommend the dbd wiki for all questions regarding the game:
---
this article is all about perks and teachables:  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks)
---
Yeah similar to being in a locker on being carried I guess. God this game sucks
---
Okay thanks, also awww man sucks there's none if they were I'd be awesome. Maybe they could do something like what Identity V did (similar game but on mobile) they made a PC version of the game but allowed players on mobile to match up with people on PC if they wanted would be really happy if they did something like this.
---
Get BHVR'd
---
Sprint Burst is a good perk to practice exhaustion management and to allow you to get used to exhaustion perks. It's very good for getting you out a bad spot when a killer is approaching you but its outclassed by other exhaustion perks that allow you to have more control over them. Balanced Landing is really good because it reduces the speed slow-down you get from falling off something while also granting you the speed boost meaning you have more control over the sprint boost.
---
Self-Care is a decent perk if you are new to the game. It allows you to recover from mistakes and become self-reliant when it comes to healing. as you rank up though you will notice the perk becomes less useful as it wastes a lot of time &amp; leaves you exposed. 
---
Healing normally takes around 16 seconds to perform. This is the case if you use a med-kit or another survivor heals you. Self-care makes you take 32 seconds to complete a heal. IF the killer is using Sloppy Butcher than that pushes self-care up to 40 seconds. 
---
A generator can be complete in 80 seconds by a single survivor. You would be wasting half a gens progress on healing yourself which in my opinion is not worth it. Especially if you could have a perk like Adrenaline.
---
I would suggest using are;
---
Adrenaline (Meg Teachable) - Very strong perk that allows you to gain a 5 second speed boost &amp; a free heal when the last gen is complete. Very good if you are being chased during the end-game to allow you to either extend the chase or escape the killer. The free heal means you can avoid healing yourself if only a couple of generators need to be complete and instead focus on finishing gens to get the free heal. 
---
Bond (Dwight Teachable) - Gives you a 36 meter radius where any other survivor that enters will have their aura shown to you. Very good for finding other survivors meaning you can use it if you want a survivor to heal you. You can also use it to avoid bringing the killer to survivors working on gens as to not push the survivors off a generator. 
---
Borrowed Time (Bill teachable) - If you unhook a survivor in the killers terror radius, it gives the unhooked survivor 15 seconds of protection from a killers attack. This allows you to perform unsafe unhooks in front of the killer to save a teammate. This will allow you to gain more bloodpoints while also allowing you to save your teammates mid-chase. This is a very strong perk for the end-game if you have a killer camping a survivor while the exit gates are open.
---
Balanced Landing (Nea Teachable) - Basically a better version of Sprint Burst. If you drop from a height you will gain a sprint boost. This perk also grants an increased recovery from dropping from a height allowing you to not be punished from dropping down heights. Very good and is easy to control.
---
I still remember the feeling I got when I started escaping.
---
Hey. I wasn‚Äôt thinking too hard on it. I took the win
---
r/downvotedtooblivion
---
Let me just bring attention to the Spirit's lore, specifically, the very end bit. The reason she became a killer was her burning hatred for her father. He not only killed Rin's mother but also caused brutal, fatal and painful injuries to Rin. It even states that she vowed to get her revenge on her father. It makes sense that she's inexperienced. She obviously hasn't killed anyone but has this burning vengeance for her father, stopping at nothing to make sure her father's blood is spilled. It makes sense why she's so intimidating and angry after her Mori. If that wasn't enough, look at her perk Rancor. The whole point of it is to finally get revenge on one specific person, specifically the obsession.
---
welcome to SWF :)
---
I felt like with these addons every Pig game would be different. So that way it feels more like Saw since the rules are never the same.
---
I didn‚Äôt think too hard on it. I just took the win.
---
That what most of my games against him have been, this one was refreshing- even if I did get moried literally like 10 seconds after this clip ended lmao
---
Think of the amount of bullshit hits we could do
---
BP shouldn't be given out like candy. You'd end up with Moris for days, survivors with the best tools and add-ons in every game.
---
The Blood Web needs to be re-worked. IMO, by Blood Web 30 a 3rd perk should be available, allowing you to get 2 perks per BW. Perhaps 2 on the outside rings and 1 in an earlier ring. I'm sure they can work the Blood Web where P3 50 survivors and killers with all perks still get the same amount of ultra rare and rare items as we currently get now.
---
I would also like to see one or two more tools in the survivor BW to balance out the 4x more add-ons than tools. From the survey, if they implement a mechanic to scrap or craft add-ons then I would be more interested in that than just more tools. I find it kind of stupid that I can have 0 toolboxes but then have 60 add-ons for a toolbox. 
---
Maybe with those implemented and a minor bump to BP gain (10-15%) the grind wouldn't be so exhausting.

Oh God, now I feel bad for thinking using both was the best option. Spine chill goes off? Look around with Premonition and boom. Know where the killer is. It was a dark time for me. Don't judge.
---
Man if they would just imply my addon rework she would be a one on one with her Saw style.
---
And both of them are using Rule Set No. 2
---
I just had a dirty game as hag, against 3 rank 20s no perks and 1 rank 12. I'm rank 10... I feel gross, they had one perk between all 3 of them..

Ask yourself how much time you play. Is $5 worth halving the time it will take for you to earn the bloodpoints you want. It is worth the investment if you value your time. Unless you have nothing to save bloodpoints for, that is.
---
But the entity also feeds on hope. Her father has no hope; only despair. That‚Äôs why he killed his family. So, he wouldn‚Äôt fit as a survivor.
---
Pallet regen wouldn't change much at rank 1 but it would help solo queue survivors out alot maybe it should be a offering or low rank thing. Buying perks directly would be a way for them to make more money and newer survivors could do better. The playerbase would grow again if it was survivors sided and it would make even more money than catering to the side that buy less cosmetics. These are just great ideas for money making.
---
Nice rules.
---
You do understand that both camping and tunneling are legit too, right?
---
I heard news that the lawsuit might be finally over soon
---
My favorite are the games when you run to unhook someone and by the time you get there, someone is getting downed and hooked. Then you run to unhook that person, and as you unhook them, someone else is already downed and hooked. I had a game where I got 5 back-to-back safe unhooks due to this.  I don‚Äôt think we had any gens done.
---
I just can't wait for her cosmetics!
---
Thats not the point. The point is he cant refrain for long.
---
Not really no, especially when your better off waiting for a teammate than trying to kobe. there are way better perks you could be running, such as iron will, adrenaline, quick and quiet, balanced landing, hope, lithe, dead hard, were gonna live forever, borrowed time, plunderer's instinct, etc.
---
I've seen a few since they released his latest cosmetic. they're rare though.

---
I would have felt terrible after killing all those baby survivors... I feel like this would be a good reason why we should be able to see people's ranks before the match begins.
---
Did you make an account just to say that?
---
Its a jarring change at first, but you get used to it
---
You're a side quest üòÇ
---
tru3 (see what I did there), this game is unbalanced but no need to point it out every 30seconds on stream. I still like watching him tho.
---
You deserve it for noed lol
---
What I do is first 60 secs of the game I pop Stealth and look for a gen that‚Äôs been started, discordance is helpful here,  I‚Äôll stalk as many survivors to almost completion as possible and pick one mark then chase. Then hook and repeat ideally. If the group is super altruistic I‚Äôll hook and kick gens or pallets then try and mark the rescuer. If I can and the group is really good at running me around I‚Äôll use stealth to mind game and try to get a mark if they are full health. People aren‚Äôt good at breaking GF out in a chase especially if they‚Äôre running, survs tend to make mistakes when they look behind them. 
---
Perks I run are BBQ, Ruin, IAE, and Discordance. I‚Äôm in high green ranks.
---
 It‚Äôs not your fault. The entity chose this. But god I would feel so bad. Maybe take them into a kill your friends game or something to help them learn.
---
If the choice is to let the timer run out and get my full points, or allow a forfeit and get half points - this is a no brainier. And no killer is gonna agree with you. Killers work too hard to get their points. What you are proposing is just another sly way for survivors to fuck over killers since DCing will hopefully be coming to end once the dedicated servers are in place.
---
You said that survivors get to keep all their points up until that point, but killers get half the points for the forfeit of the last survivor. What killer would agree to that. No. It should be the other way - the survivor that forfeits loses half their points and the killer gets full points for the sacrifice. The survivor is the one that's quitting so the survivor should be the one that suffers for the forfeit.
---
If we're going by ALL of the movies, then Freddy probably has the highest kill count.
---
Mostly because of Part 2, where he was maiming and killing those kids at the pool party.
---
I haven't slept since they were announched. Give them BHVR PLS, I wanna sleep.
---
Lmao meanwhile my P3 characters are getting none 10-15 bloodwebs in, yet my non prestiged get one every other bloodweb.
---
How toxic was he? If I felt pissed enough I wouldn't even have hooked him and just let him bleed out.

---
It‚Äôs a great design, I think it would work well if it was integrated as the Plague.
---
His p3 face looks pretty cool. I considered leveling mine all the way but his in game character noise is so god damn annoying. The fucking mouth breather is constantly huffing and wheezing and out of breath, its so loud and obnioxious.
---
Yep! He really showed his power there.
---
Or you could read what I said... which states that the killer could just... you know... kill the survivor? It would be a charge up, alert the killer of the survivors location, and still give the killer the kill... of the killer can‚Äôt kill the survivor in that scenario, they killer doesn‚Äôt deserve the kill. It‚Äôs losing HALF OF THAT SPECIFIC KILL BONUS. Are you reading? It‚Äôs not even forfeiting, it‚Äôs ending an already over game... are you daft?
---
Thats really no different than pairing SB tho.
---
I think it should it be buffed to also mute your scratch marks for 10 sec when you get unhooked.
---
Trust me, you'd be thankfull for it not having Crossplay, it's better to have people on equal grounds.
---
Though having your progress carry over would be another thing I don't see why not.
---
Actually you're wrong about the wraith partly. He might actually have the most kills in the hundreds but they were unknown to him and the exact amount is known to nobody, not even him.
---
Dedicated servers are very expensive. They said during development they met with marketing firms and were only expected to sell a couple hundred thousand copies.  The game had completely unexpected success and has sold millions.  In the past year or 2 they released the cash cow they are sitting on, and have started investing in things like a cosmetics store and dedicated servers to support the game long term.
---
Not to pick a side but dbd is even more the same, in f13 you had multiple ways of escaping and fighting back, so where‚Äôs your point?
---
Was a full 4 man SWF they were all fucking me about but she was T bagging at every pallet, she hit me with a party starter save, hit mr with DS and also she kept fast vaulting windows away from the gens to annoy the fuck outta me. Also got flashlight saved when I tried to hook her too. Was so satisfying to get them all
---
i like these changes but if feel like Amanda's Letter will be way too strong (maybe remove the exposed effect or the charge time?)
---
I'll admit got lucky that game because they well and truly 3 Gened themselves
---
Yeah but if they did add it I don't think people would really mind because they'd have the choice to play with PC users or not if they didn't want to (unless they add cross play without the option to)
---
Pigs add on's definitely need a pass like Wraith and Trapper got. Half of them are worthless.
---
The timer would be pretty long to charge it. Since the roar comes halfway this igves most survivors time to make a move. And she sacrifises almost all of her traps.
---
PS4
---
UI Bug as Surviver
---
Self Care prompt disappeared so I couldnt use perk. Could not struggle when killer picked me up. Could not see progress on healing others. Could not escape either, when i went through the exit gate, I could still walk around and was killed by End game Collapse.
---
I use the perk and my Quintin is P3. I use it because I paly solo and want the rest to know which door is opening if anyone is going for a save or being chased. I haven't noticed things being fast but I usually have a toolbox. 
---
Is this happening on Ps4 so I know whether I should be using one of my meta perks, or not?
---
Acctually I calculated it 65% is useless.
---
I've been using wake up ever since Quentin came out. Why should I change my build just because devs are incompetent?
---
Jeff has recently become my main male survivor. I got him to P3 during the double BP event. I love his P3 head and use it with the Camo pants and the Camo vest with the snakes on it.
---
Fun fact, the blades affect you before you even get stabbed.
---
I loaded into a match with blades Legion and vaulted a window. The vault was already slower.
---
Everyone uses it....
---
Very broken. Killer queues are ridiculous now and survivors not so much. It's basically a reverse but far worse.
---
Check the DBD forums. It's a bug. Think it affects people with surround sound.
---
Lol I think they actually did!
---
Should have been the purple engineers toolbox with Socket Swivels + Clean Rag, Wake Up, Prove Thyself, Resilience, No Mither, and a shroud of binding.
---
Because pig would've litteely been broken with her traps and the timer. It had to he changed at least a bit
---
I did a joke toolkit of grip wrench and spring clamp and they didn't really do anything. The skillcheck was about the size of a normal skillcheck, no increase in great skillcheck size.
---
But yeah, totally agree that there are a ton of useless add-ons.
---
Wait so teabagging is legit? No teabag isn't a rule, it's nice manners, the killer is stressed af trying to get one of you down and yoy teabag him? Also yeah I know that camping and tunneling are legit, but that's a bastard way to play the game. It's a cycle of you think about it, camping and tunneling = teabag at the exit gates
---
Teabagging at pallets = camping and tunneling
---
But the difference is that teabagging makes the killer angry, camping and tunneling are boring, time wasters and both killer and the survivor lose extra points. No side is justified
---
oh, nevermind, i misread it 'cause i thought it says decreased
---
h e y o
---
Why has every nurse submission ive seen on this sub have legs...?
---
So like is that bannable? I would hope so.
---
??
---
With all the cool designs on here I wish they just asked the community for all costume designs
---
I can just tell you all are killers lmfao I shouldn‚Äôt be getting hit in the air when I‚Äôm five feet away from the killer while he‚Äôs in the air and he doesn‚Äôt have the reach to hit me when hopefully the hitboxes get fixed shitters like everyone on this thread become rank 20 killers
---
If the Entity didn‚Äôt take Rin, she would have just died. If they didn‚Äôt take Legion, they‚Äôd probably just end up in jail after commit one or two more murders. If they didn‚Äôt take Plague, everyone she led into the desert would have just died there and she would have too. 
---
The Entity is definitely not inherently evil because why even give the survivors a chance to survive? Why give them any tools to even fight back? The Entity is a being who feeds on hope and that crushing feeling when you‚Äôre at the end of the tunnel and all your light is destroyed. But is also a big sadist because the hooks clearly do it for them too. 
---
But no, the Entity couldn‚Äôt care less about a safer world, their goal is to trap as many people possible to keep its game going.
---
I read it perfectly.
---
Spin it however you want, this is just a way of a survivor main trying to force the killer to play by his/her rules in the way he/she wants. When you don't get your way, you DC. And since that's going to be ending soon, now you'll rather just crawl to a corner of the map, press a forfeit button, and have the killer wall all around the map looking for you in a short timeframe or else he'll lose half the kill points - fuck that. 
---
If you are slugged and left during the End Game - touch shit. Wait out the timer or else. A quitter does not deserve to keep his/her points. A quitter deserves no pity either.
---
You are right, protections hit are super funky sometimes, unless you purposefully run into the killer with him grabbing a person, the protection hits can be a bit buggy. Sometimes I feel like I can get a protection hit, and it doesn‚Äôt count, and vice versa
---
Freddy might find a use before his rework is this was a thing. He can slow the game down while the a nurse is fair and balanced.
---
You‚Äôre rank 12 relax
---
You have real ta1ent when it comes to puns ;) I like him too. He just annoys me sometimes.
---
Ok good to know. I guess I should be moving the camera more, though he almost always sneaks up on me when I‚Äôm repairing a generator. I‚Äôm usually not moving the camera so that I can focus on watching for the skill test. Will have to practice that. Thanks for the reply, super helpful info.
---
I was body blocking a hook while a survivor was on his back, somehow getting hit then wasn't a protection hit.
---
Then escapes to the hatch (bed)
---
&gt;So like is that bannable? I would hope so.
---
[Devs know about Wake Up and know who's abusing it.](https://redd.it/c3nrrl)
---
Shame Geforce only captures the last 5 minutes this whole game was insane, was getting bullied hard at the beginning but managed to pull it back and get a 4 man. Got flashlight &amp; party starter saved twice as well as hit with DS. Getting that Laurie was so satisfying, she'd been giving me T bags the whole game along with the rest
---
Saving this for later, this is gold.
---
i do that with a grey toolbox to empty my inventory.
---
I get what you mean, if you're a newbie it can be difficult. I still struggle with skill tests lol. You'll get used to that though, since that's not only a problem with Ghostface but also with every killer. You always need to be on the watch! No problem, glad I could help :)
---
Like in the game
---
There's only a two minute timer on the traps, which I think is reasonable.  So you want them to do an 80 second generator and leave them with 40 seconds to find one of four potential boxes or find their specific box?
---
The cake is indeed a lie.
---
I like your pun, but I won't be KATEring to your wish for a compliment ;)
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the game came out on ps4 lmao I‚Äôve seen my fair share of bullshit from hitboxes to OP survivor perks that I‚Äôve abused lmao but air hit boxes are just fucking lovely love to be 5 feet away from eachother in the air and before we hit the ground he manages to pull out whatever he‚Äôs using and make the reach and hit me it‚Äôs fucking beautiful
---
Yeah, I can get why people want MoM to also get progress when you get a safe hook rescue, since if protection hits are as broken as some of my past experiences and from things I‚Äôve heard, then it would make sense why they would want this change, or possibly fixing protection hits
---
When you don‚Äôt get your way you DC? What do you think is happening? It‚Äôs clear you are not reading this. It would be the very last survivor, still give the killer points, but there has to be a penalty to encourage them to play the game. It‚Äôs literally just an option so that people can go back to playing the game and enjoying it sooner. 
---
Walk all around the map? See it‚Äôs very clear your not reading, or can‚Äôt. I literally just said ‚Äúit would notify the killer when being used‚Äù. Why would you not read before commenting? It would literally give the killer every single opportunity to get their points, and if they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt want them. It‚Äôs a win win, yet you just want to bitch and moan because people wouldn‚Äôt suffer enough? If your argument is, ‚Äúbut I want them to suffer‚Äù you‚Äôre the problem, and should probably take a good look at your priorities.
---
It happens. Happy oinking to you sir.
---
I dont think theres enough threads about this topic. Lets make sure to post a few more every hour.
---
I checked, it's PC only. :/
---
Points don't matter. All that matters is you either escape, or you kill people, depending on who you play as.
---
Ok best of luck with it all
---
Yikes
---
I have never read a post I more deeply agree with
---
How do you get red perks because I‚Äôve never seen them on console
---
This is super inaccurate. Bubba has killed dozens at least, amanda is responsible for the deaths of pretty much everyone in the second and third movies, even if she didnt build the traps she did put them there, the plague is... well the plague... shes killed thousands
---
You can also find all the bios in [the wiki.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki)
---
Taking it with a grain of salt. Cause they did that whole message board in game about the legion and the blades, havent seen anything about wake up in game yet. And that does me a concern.
---
Hey man, welcome! I envy that first time feeling. Make yourself comfortable and do gens like a madman!
---
I‚Äôm going to check lmao jeez
---
He was tryna fuck em up eh
---
I'm arguing back with em
---
PREACH. 
---
It was so fucking moronic what they did to the Pig. Utterly ridiculous and uncalled for.
---
Noed hag gamer...
---
whats wrong with Wake Up?
---
u/usernamechecksout
---
Implying this game is actually a scary horror game. It's fucking cat and mouse, nothing about the gameplay loop is scary.
---
Teabagging doesn't help you escape, it helps you getting killed
---
While the lag is shitty, I just love your reaction when you checked back at Ming and saw him
---
I agree. It definitely was OP but to bvhr it‚Äôs either 0 or 100. There is no in between. 
---
A rework idea that I seen that I liked and thought was balanced is that it still activates after 3 m1 attacks but leaves you broken for the rest of the trial and your aura visible to killer when outside x metres.
---
Dude! I LOVE THIS!
---
Lovely
---
the title could have just been "me playing ghost face for the first time"
---
Even cat and mouse implies some level of self preservation. This guy is complaining because hes a mouse that sits at the cats bowl and goes afk.
---
Oh, I like that headcanon.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, little ones‚Äù
---
I can‚Äôt check on console
---
Bug where it gives a 15% speed boost to everything, gens, healing, etc
---
Sorry I‚Äôm not a PC masterrace l
---
He is literally doing the only thing he can do to prevent you from escaping. That is his goal; to prevent you from escaping. Furthermore, his 'plan' worked but somehow you bugged the EGC timer by not triggering it. 
---
Nevertheless, It disappoints me you call old mate toxic; he was merely fulfilling the killer's objective.
---
At what point did he imply he wasn't trying to not die?
---
Imagine paying for literally nothing (the weapon skin) in the shop haha.
---
Love it.
---
Well I'm flattered, then.
---
Wait does it count from the progress before or do you have to start over and grab 25 survivors??? Someone please answer!
---
The part where he states all hes doing is holding m1 and staring blankly at the screen?
---
OK fix the wake up bug and while you're at it...could you please make it at least a little bit useful? Not much, maybe useful enough that I could actually START to consider using it? Maybe one match out of five? That'd be great.
---
oh, thank you, great advice for future. did you get the Adept btw?
---
Like you're any better of a person
---
the objective is to survive all the time, even when the match just started
---
the only thing i'm concerned about is why is Kate even here? wasn't she took by force by the Entity?
---
You said "It would take a moment to charge, and likely have some sort of animation so that it is clear it is being activated."
---
What in that post said "It would show the aura of the downed survivor so that a killer could come straight to the survivor". Nowhere did it say it. You survivors would go hide in a corner or under a bush, hit the forfeit button, and have the killer waste his/her time looking for you and IF the killer finds you in the short amount of time (and I'm sure it'll be a very short time), it's the killer that loses half the sacrifice points and not the quitter.
---
There's no chance in hell any killer would go for this, and there is no win-win no matter how you spin it. You don't get to dictate how fast a killer should be allowed to kill you. The killer will kill you when the killer decides to kill you.
---
Quitters shouldn't get points. Quitters shouldn't dictate how fast they are killed. The only thing quitters should get is banned, period.
---
And that's the problem. You just accept the win without considering how the person playing killer felt after having just robbed. On top of that, you have the audacity to label the killer as toxic.
---
Players like you are why there will always be tension between both classes: survivors are upset because the killer wants to kill them, and killers are upset because they get harassed and name-called merely for fulfilling the role and psyche of the killer.
---
lol, just.....why?
---
Because you're a cool dude and you realize you fuck the killers game using a bugged perk?
---
Maybe that has something to do with the fact that you *don't need to look for shit.* The only exceptions to this are stealth killers, which are few and far between (besides the launch of Ghostface in particular). If you don't know shit about the game you're talking about, stop talking like you do.
---
Once you've played for more than 10 hours, which evidently you haven't considering your viewpoints are that of a new player, you get so bored of doing gens that you just zone out and wait for skill checks. It's bad design because skill checks are so easy you're basically just sitting there holding a button on a generator, because again, *there's nothing worth looking out for 99% of the time*
---
Looks fake to me but w/e
---
Traps don't activate until a gen is done... So the timer is not ticking. Rules set no.2 make it so they can't see boxes until their trap is active. So they have to do a gen, then they have 2 minutes to find a right box and they can see them...
---
If he just wanted to kill him, why drop him in the exit gates the first time? Hmm.
---
You're getting downvoted but that is the reason safe unhooks was removed. You could get 2 stacks from 1 hook save easily by farming your teammate off hook with BT. One of the two conditions had to go and they ended up with safe unhooks going away.
---
I'm... not sure I would put Myers in the "normal humans" category.
---
bro stfu he is just trying to make a reddit post and everyone likes it but you get over yourself asshole
---
I thought they activated after the first gen was done.  Is it actually on a per gen basis?
---
If you want background, i drew a pic of the legion jumping at Jeff with an "OWO" face on it, but someone thought my signature (that was written in red) was blood coming out of Frank's ass.
---
How many hours have you played this game for?
---
Dope.
---
So accurate!
---
**\*sobbing\*** I love him
---
I main Freddy without noed and still get to red ranks lol
---
Yep. It's such a useful perk mid-chase.
---
It'll be faster (but less, hum... "profiting" ?) to just give us mod support at this point.
---
If the RBT is active BEFORE EGC, they're still forced to get the helmet off or they die instantly at the exit gate.
---
When will they pick the cosmetic?
---
No. The reason the killer stomps is usually just a matter of experience. The losing survivors will learn, get better and win more often in the future. And this is not a DBD exclusive thing, it's true for any PvP game, asymetrical or not.  
---
It's about winning or losing. No matter how often you repeat your asshole-argument, it doesn't make it true.
---
100% what happened
---
That's becuse no one uses him and has no idea how t play against him.
---
What does ‚ÄúSWJ‚Äù stand for?
---
I want this just so I can have "Nothing" and pretend the Clown is beating the Survivors into submission with his bare hands, then just rips their fingers off their hands instead of cutting them.
---
I‚Äôve had a killer march similar to this, but the guy was in a locker, but couldn‚Äôt get out, I killed all 3 survivors, and he was literally stuck in a locker walking around inside it. I tried opening it to grab him, hitting the sides to Mabye glitch hit him, nothing. I waited like an hour, to see if he would leave. Nope. He told me after a very long time the next day he went to sleep and left his computer on. I had to leave the match after the hour cause it was 2am
---
That Ghostface is from Utah.
---
That's an awful idea. Do you know what would help solo survivors out? Better matchmaking so you don't get garbage teammates. It's too hard to carry a 1v4 game yourself. If you're a good player, you should get good teammates.
---
The game is survivor sided btw.
---
I always have like...the opposite thing happen to me. I'm a rank 19 killer because I don't play the killer much but sometimes I like to and I swear that I get these rank 10/11 survivors every time. Why, matchmaking, why?
---
Eh I've had worse :p
---
Best thing I can give you is my first trophy was earned in August 4th of 2018
---
But "asshole" is a completely subjective term, so you have to have some sort of foundation to argue on - hence the game's rules. Otherwise it's just one side screaming asshole at the other ad nauseam.
---
I learned how to combat those types while I was still in beta
---
You are replying to a fucking 18days old email comment dude fuck ofr
---
All y'all hating on my legion boys.
---
Just lemme have my stabby bois.
---
At least it's being faithful the movie.
---
Yes, hilariously
---
Tbh, I think they should get rid of your aura being shown with the current MoM. Because good luck even trying to use it in its current state. Honestly? I would've made it where you suffer from the "EXPOSED" status effect if you fully heal after using MoM.
---
elaborate
---
"Don't ban cheaters it's bad for the game" excuse me?
---
Thanks for the info I already knew. Doesn't change anything tho.
---
What does that have to do with my comment?
---
to you as well
---
yeah, a while back they fucked up the registration. I'm not 100% and there might be some edge cases where it works but basically now your hitbox needs to essentially edge *right against* another *injured survivor's* for it to count, and *it only counts once per injured survivor* (you can't take 2 hits for them and get 2 stacks)
---
Legion being viable for all the wrong reasons again.
---
Why would someone d-dos or harass random people they dont know?
---
I sure met a Ghostface who appeared to be very drunk yesterday lol.
---
But I use premonition like it's life support so this is pretty much every Ghostface to me. Premonition rings, I'm like "Oh, time to go." Other survivors at gens often don't get why I'm suddenly leaving, especially when we don't technically know that it's Ghostface yet.
---
Fulfilling the killers objective would be to put him on a hook not drop him in the exit gate so he thinks ur letting him go or has a chance only 4 the EDC to finish him off.  If I could I ld like this post a 1000 times, i love it when trolls like this get trolled.  But I bet u complain when survivors hang out in the exit gate or when u get teabagged at a loop
---
Are you new? Or just high? Lmao imagine having to deal with someone getting healing skillchecks in front of you and then having to wait 7 seconds to hit them again
---
Did you not understand that point? The fact you can just zone out and not worry is the problem.
---
yeah I know about that looks like my suggestion in preventing double stacking is not well thought out. oh well it was good to know you reaction.
---
I thought nurse was British. Samination even gives her an English accent.
---
i like how you preach about people whining then your entire reddit post history is just you screaming your head off in the most generic internet nerd way in every other game you play, congratulations on graduating from clown college buddy you earned it
---
...Yeah, why are you blaming him for that?
---
Nope just an empty spot, after I left the web, it completely replaced it next time I went in
---
Survive with friends, just means it‚Äôs a 4 man team on communication
---
It's like visiting the zoo in my opinion. Pretty hilarious. Plus the salt is addictive
---
It‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs just the no one left behind part that bothers me.
---
Just cleanse totems üß†
---
"Weapon - nothing "
---
Ok
---
Yo this is actually pretty good and realistic
---
I like to combine Head On with Quick &amp; Quiet for even more shenanigans.
---
That's like going in the forest and shooting baby bunnies. You monster. XD
---
Do you need a tissue sweetheart?
---
He can play however he wants.
---
Every object (addon, item, offering) with frequency shown as %chance of seeing it per bloodweb. Sample size of 196 perkless bloodwebs.
---
I'm surprised they haven't added a system to temporarily disable perks/add-ons yet
---
I never dodge , even if it's swf , but until they fix this shit I am dodging as soon as I see even a single Quentin.
---
Hey that was me! I have the photo here after the match I was just messing around so sorry for being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. [Photo](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0xexA9eXbv9Iebfby7gonjuvw#Montgomery,_PA)
---
You're new.
---
&gt;Taking it with a grain of salt. Cause they did that whole message board in game about the legion and the blades, havent seen anything about wake up in game yet. And that does me a concern.
---
They probably haven't addressed Wake Up specifically because it is not the only bugged perk at the moment. I suppose if they make one bannable, they would have to make all of them or something along those lines.
---
Tbh I prefer Premonition solely because I know where they are. Like it's nice that I know that Freddy is near when I run spine chill but WHERE IN THE HELL IS HE??? I just end up running into him. Sometimes I run both Spine Chill and Premonition because it's good to know that the killer is close and if they are looking in my direction.  But usually I run only Premonition. Too many stealth killers now to risk SC
---
If a survivor hugged me i'd let them go tbh. And I kinda like Humble Soul, encourages survivors not to be greedy.
---
What a cutie! Great job! I want this baddddddd
---
This is why I hate playing solo survivor. Even though I'm in red ranks, I keep keep being matched with people who aren't near my rank.
---
This really scares me
---
I did originally think about doing the plauge with this design. I just prefer my girl Nurse.
---
Definitely agree I like them all and I'm a killer main lol.
---
That matchmaking tho ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Less than 30 seconds.
---
Sorry bud you can‚Äôt use any of your killer perks as they‚Äôre scummy.
---
1. No reasoning why this a swf
---
2. Absolutley zero toxic behaviour
---
3. The survivors seem really bad, and I mean really bad. They arent looping well, they arent running well, they dont have meta perks.
---
I dont get thid vid whatsoever, its not like you do anything particulalry great either.
---
Killers don't care about fucking the game by using Hex Ruin and NOED. Why should we care about a slightly faster action speed?
---
Wait why isn't it the best option? It helps track the killer. I just pair it with Technician and Lithe or Dark Sense and I'm set. But if I'm running a support build, I use Herbal Knowledge, Self-care, Bond and Premonition
---
It's not a game problem, it's a player problem. Ghostface has just come out so everyone's trying to play as him
---
I would use fixer upper to restore God Pallet everytime
---
Thank you so much! I'm glad you like them
---
I don't need it!
---
Amazing!!!! Pose and all!!!!
---
Oh, thanks for letting me know
---
Really cool ideas man, I'm sure if they were legit perks a few tweaks would be needed but the ideas are sick and so is the design and descriptions
---
It looks like we‚Äôd from Don‚Äôt starve
---
You might need to give Bill a second look my dude
---
Maybe bloody coil gives them a mend timer which just works like mending ( doesnt deplete in Terror Radius etc. with a longer time) if you dont mend in time you lose 1 health state if you are healthy so Healthy--&gt;injured only. Otherwise with all the changes it would be too powerful.
---
Elk Grove, Michigan. it canon in the show
---
I fucking love the movie
---
Whatever It Takes is kind of dangerous to put in the game when things like Torment Creek god window exist, so maybe fix those first. Otherwise, not bad. And Fixer Upper seems really hit or miss. It seems like it'll either be really strong or really weak, and I'm not sure which.
---
For people wondering: when the killer gets stunned and the survivor is dropped, that survivor is not able to interact with anything for the lapse of the killer stun, that is why he did not get killed when the timer ran out of time. Pretty good job.
---
Bhvr
---
Thank you so much, I'm happy you like them. I agree, in game they would probably need some changes, but these were just the basics of some perk ideas
---
Play how you want. Even if NOED got changed they will bitch about another perk you use. I just type gg and leave unless I see people being friendly and sportsmanlike otherwise it‚Äôs not worth the headache of a bitch fest that will ensue if you respond.
---
Correct, the entity basically buffs killers (and in cases like freddy who is all powerful, nerfs them) to make then suitable for the fog.
---
It was most likely a swf
---
I think they should make pigs traps just be auto activated (no longer need a gen). But they still dont work if you put them on once the collapse has started. Theyd be fine then
---
Here comes the Crapper, better watch out for his craps!
---
I NNEEEEDDDD IIITTTTT!!!! (The Pig one! ‚ù§)
---
I legitimately will buy some of these if you can find a way to do so! I recommend Etsy or Ebay. If you find a way to list them, make sure you update us &lt;3
---
Type of Bug: In game (game breaking)
---
Description: During the "End game collapse" my friend went down and was being picked up as the timer ran out, this resulted in her being stuck in the down state with the killer being able to pick her up but being unable to move her.  
---
Don't know about reproducing, just saw it happen and described it. It resulted in both the killer and the last person alive being stuck in the game till one of them dc's
---

---
What i want is the kool aid man. He can break through any vaultable surface.  Other than that idk.
---
Well I mean he explains in the comments that they were being toxic and were obviously coordinated. Sure, it's up to you to beleive it or not but as he said he couldn't capture more than 5 minutes of the game. So I beleive him as I've had so many experiences where its a SWF just being Cocky and toxic and I usually don't kill many / any so when it does happen, I can see why he'd make a post about it, even if the vid doesn't show much at all
---
This is why I think rank should be visible before the game starts. You can adapt your strategy.
---
You may as well just run Bloodhound at that point.
---
I know several killers who don‚Äôt waste time doing that lmao
---
Yeh, nice one. Really impressive actually
---
Oh damn, I had a match like that yesterday as Plague as well. Haven't tried her since, blue screen killed the vibe for her.
---
they never actually fix anything, their definition of fixed is different than everyone else‚Äôs. been this way since launch.
---
I was reading online that if you are using her power as the last player is sacrificed, the game goes to blue screen. It is also not just PS4
---
Yeah, the ideas aren't completely perfect for the game, just some basic ideas I had and thought to make. Fixer Upper would probably be strong or weak depending on the map and killer tbh. For example, against a nurse it would probably not be used at all. But against some others it could work really well imo
---
I totally understand, Just was a crazy game and felt good getting them all. Really really wish you could see what was prior to that but hey who cares
---
I'll keep yall posted. Like I told another user it's just making sure we have enough to be sold.
---
if you haven't been accepted, you've probably been denied, but here's to hoping!
---
Upvoted for the unintentional dwight in the background
---
No...Adrenaline.
---
They won't because they're survivors
---
You'll get banned for double blading though
---
Even if it was him beating a teabagging 4 man it would be a pointless video. I get toxic survivors exsist but showing 4 rank 20 survivors doing nothing toxic whatsoever losing is completley pointless.
---
Wake Up is a shitty new player perk
---
This sub is scummy
---
I'd be down to hug the killer
---
Rank 20 GF
---
Oh okay, that's what happened for me then, I hooked the last survivor then puked on some lockers then I crashed.
---
I agree. I, too, said most of the killers have at least 1 or 2 perks that are useful, while all the survivors have, if they‚Äôre lucky, maybe 1 perk that is useful, but it‚Äôs situational. I never said survivor perks should be as strong as killer perks, but survivor perks should at least have a little bit of strength and viability. When they do get that, it gets taken away. But the only perk that has gotten that within the last few new survivors was pretty much only MoM, and they changed it to be actually impossible since they tied a limiter to it that is part of a game function that doesn‚Äôt currently work properly (the game does not register protection hits correctly at all and I‚Äôm sure we all know this). No one is using MoM now, and hardly anyone uses DStrike anymore. I know many people who use Adrenaline and Self Care, but those are perks that came out three years ago.
---
Are you only counting the first movie for freddy?
---
Fucker murders my team every time. I wouldn't call him bad if he's capable of slaughtering survivors like pigs.
---
Also tbh I hate how this subreddit uses "m1 killer." Most killers in DBD are m1 killers and they're good. The only ones who aren't m1 are Anna, Bubba, Max, Evan, and Amanda. Adiris can be counted too if survivors activate her Corrupt Purge
---
Its happening to everyone, you are not alone.
---
\^\^ That's why I felt I had to add that comment, they really rang me through the ringer throughout the game but once I got the Laurie out the way and they were all on at least 2nd hook they stopped being Toxic and more objective focused. I'm new to the game so just felt good  getting them all and not getting bullied
---
Maybe change your title then as video is completley inaccurate
---
remember me only goes to 3 as well
---
They can come to the Gideon Meat Plant, I will be waiting there for them.
---
Say something I‚Äôm giving up on you.
---
I mean of course it's subjective, that's why I lay out my reasoning in my replies...
---
Fixer upper is broken. If 2 or more survivors use it      then pallets would be infinite.
---
Nobody said anything about making anyone's experience as boring as possible. My point is that the killer is not required to consider another person's gaming experience (outside of stuff that's bannable, obviously). 
---
None of that stuff is "broken", lmao. Pot calling the kettle black?
---
You can tell from the play styles that OP is probably new to the game, so I imagine he enjoyed taking down his first coordinated team and just wanted to share. :) It is satisfying the first time you have a team that makes you work for it and you get them all.
---
Legacy boy checking in
---
man, imagine if they had bruce campbell narrate it as well
---
I do feel bad that a response to me speaking out could have demoralised or disheartened you from practicing your craft. I promise however it‚Äôs not personal.
---
I want to make that clear, 
---
I‚Äôm just trying to introduce alternative ways for you to work, 
---
For one at university we practice and make studies a lot however they come under our study portfolios, sketchbooks and digital study folders for personal reflection or sharing with peers and friends, sometimes taking studies and then producing something original within that same sitting. Studies real photo of shark, draws shark from scratch imagination with that first hand recent practice allowing for educated design.
---
The real issue is that companies all the time and social media artists have made it ok or have just not been prevented from posting copied, stolen or work around art for views, marketing their pages and monetisation...foul practice then adopted by artists who know no different.
---
Just trying to push for an equal space
---
I‚Äôd like to see you make something with this detail of pencil rendering but from scratch, made with authenticity and your personal perspective, draw her your way with your vision whatever that may be :)
---
Thankyou
---
I'm scared
---
MoM is trash now
---
Swiggity swooty I'm coming for that booty
---
These are so cute. Hopefully she finds a way to sell them, I‚Äôd buy one in a heartbeat.
---
Aw, don‚Äôt cry spirit! It‚Äôs ok!
---
No, it's about being able to play the game.  Being able to play the game and losing is how games work. Not being able to play the game in the first place is toxic, especially when it isn't necessary to prevent it.
---
I think it's fine as it is
---
As a a rare perk maybe, but it just feels like it's kinda lack luster.
---
I highly doubt that "everyone" is playing killer. I'm 100% certain, there's something wrong with killer lobbies. The changes they keep testing, shows us that there must be something wrong, not sure if it's a test run for the dedicated servers, but waiting for 5-10 minutes or sometimes even longer, shouldn't be a thing.
---
I‚Äôll be impressed if he makes a week. Nothing against the guy, I used to regularly watch his YouTube videos and streams but the constant complaining about balance killed it for me. I don‚Äôt think he can help himself.
---
Oh hell no
---
Who has the worst add on set in your opinion?
---
Ruin = Ok
---
Noed = Ok
---
Ruin + Noed = Bad at applying gen pressure
---
I said in another response that I never said survivor perks should be as strong as killer perks. Survivor perks should have some strength to them, though, and there currently aren‚Äôt any newer ones that have much strength or viability in serious gameplay. Most of the perks survivors are using on regular gameplay basis cane out 2-3 years ago. There is not much variety. Of the last several survivors to come out, MoM was the only one worth using (and while I agree it did need to be changed, I also believe this change was absurd considering it is limited by a game function that doesn‚Äôt work). Safe unhooks was different, since the game seems to have an easier time registering when they occur, but the game does not properly register when protection hits occur, which makes MoM useless, and in the last several games I played, no one is using it- it‚Äôs back to the old builds, with perks that came out 2-3 years ago. I‚Äôm not saying they need to be as strong as killer perks, but they should at least be useful, and not every survivor perk should be a meme. The survivor perk side should absolutely have as much variety as the killer perk side, but most survivor perk builds for serious gameplay are still composed of perks from when they game first came out (I could make an argument for aftercare being useful for solo play, but it‚Äôs situational it seems, especially at high ranks when there are other perks that do a similar job better that also, surprise!, came out years ago). BHVR used to be bold with perk design, and they seemed to want to keep the game surprising and asymmetrical, but these days, they seem to be afraid of community backlash because people are afraid of the challenge of playing against a potentially difficult perk build. In my opinion, as a killer, I would like to see more variety in survivor perks. It‚Äôs boring to play against the same things over and over again. I know they have dead hard, I know they have self care, I know they have adrenaline most of the time, etc. and I know how to play against all of those. It‚Äôs not fulfilling to keep playing against the same things over and over again, but with the way BHVR has been, it probably won‚Äôt change.
---
This is actually god-tier
---
Can someone fill me in on the bug with Wake Up?
---
It would, maybe they could just stay in first person and that would give the killers a tad bit more of an advantage instead of being insanely unfair
---
Did he say anything after?
---
ahhh, it would sure be nice to induce genuine fear into the survivors
---
I've grown to love using STBFL, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring, but I don't know how to modify that for Doctor. Does he not need chase perks?
---
I don't understand how tho?
---
And this is why I'm bothered by the -albeit small - reduction to score and BP at the end when 'in close proximity to hooked survivor' or such and such. I mean...how's it my fault that they run by a hooked survivor or tried to camp the hook themselves?
---
&gt;you have the audacity to label the killer as toxic
---
As a killer main: Yes that killer was super toxic. He could have hooked OP, but chose to dick around and wait for the entity to kill him. He got what he deserved. This is worse than survivors teabagging at the gate until the timer runs out.
---
Those are adorable.
---
https://youtu.be/Enye4vhd0H0
---
What do you recommend I replace?
---
Noed for whispers
---
Every hit landed causes an ear-piercing **OOH YEAH!**
---
Hey welcome to the game! I recommend looking up talented players on either Twitch or YouTube to get an idea of how killers should be treated and looped. I personally enjoy watching Noob3, Stray Wolf, and Monto.
---
if she found a way to make prints and encase them you could make multiple with the profit of the buying maybe make her own website or shob on ebay for it too id love for the wraith and hag.
---
Why doesn't BHVR just put into place literally any system that lets them temporarily disable perks for situations like this? I can understand not wanting to revert whatever change caused the bug because it's likely tied to other important balance changes, but why wait until they can fix the perk rather than just taking it out of the game for a week?
---
Originally I thought the ideas were good, but reading the replies I can see now that they would realistically need a lot of changes to actually work. Maybe Fixer Upper could be for the pallets the killer breaks while chasing you. So if multiple survivors use it, they wouldn't all get the tokens?
---
That makes a lot of sense, and I'm kinda mad now.
---
Yeah about the wraith...she..didnt draw a wraith chibi.
---
Even if it doesn't no one will notice with him inside a locker the whole game
---
Thanks a lot man
---
Just her toe
---
Okay thanks for the advice
---
omg. in the end i think itd be cool to have her draw all the killers but for now ill suffer waiting for it
---
Platform: All platforms
---
Killer: Legion
---
Bug type: addons, gameplay, game breaking
---
Legions blade addons effect healing, gens, sabo, opening doors and vaulting windows instead of just slowing down mending.
---
cool idea for April fools
---
I saw a few so far on had a hat floating next to his hand
---
Did they do anything for April 1st this year? I didn‚Äôt have the game at that time
---
When he starts getting his ass kicked
---
I played against him and as him. He's a decent killer, he just needs to be fixed.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the problem because I spend about 2m bp and didn‚Äôt get those
---
dont think they did. But that doesnt mean they cant next year :D
---
Taken by the Entity as in taken to the realm.
---
I could ask her to make a all male killers chibi cause she only did the females. Now how long that'll be idk.
---
It's not worse. At best it's equal
---
The Freddy we have in the game is from the 2010 remake, and there's only one film in that particular timeline, and this was how many he killed in that film.
---
I don't care what anyone says, you're a hero
---
if you could i think that‚Äôd be amazing as long as she needs considering thats a gift to the dbd reddit
---
Well, I‚Äôm fucked or taking it
---
&gt; Killers won't even hit for me running behind a healthy survivor.
---
Every killer got traumatized with the original MoM and they never want to see that extra health state again. I know i sure don't :P
---
I see that now, reading the replies. They would need a lot of changes to realistically work in the game. Honestly I should've put more thought into these ideas
---
Better Together would go well with my No Mither + Resilience meme build, that also have We'll Make It in it.
---
Vaults inherently don't have mindgame potential because the vault itself is an opening to see the other person.
---
It wouldnt be through a mod, i assume.  
---
If people created designs for, say, monthly competitions (potentially with winners winning Auric Cells,) the devs can then create those assets for in game. They wouldn't lose money.. they would probably increase profits. Multiple games have already used this for cosmetics.
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[Spirit is fucking broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3qwgh/spirit_is_fucking_broken/))
---
Also like it feeds off of loss of hope? All the survivors went missing in places touched by the entity for several days or longer and probably had no hope of escaping?
---
Nice.
---
didn't legion kill people coming too close to their little hideout after that incident with the janitor?
---
Wouldn't they immediately cancel your stalk, though ?
---
Oh okay thanks, I really like the grind for cosmetics during these types of events so I hope that they'll release an event like that during this summer
---
Love your cosplay. And I just got a crush on you lol.
---
Yeah but did they really ban them, or just say they did?
---
I can't get ANY killer matches, is there no one in the universe playing Survivor right now?! It's bizarre, because I can click survivor and instantly find a lobby with 3 other survivors in it. Am I cursed to never play killer again..? Is this how survivor mains are born..?
---
This is really good.
---
The middle ground hes talking about was protection and safe uunhooks and not just protection hits. So hes still asking for one thats about helping the team dumbass.
---
‚ÄúHow did that hit?!‚Äù  -It..... it didn‚Äôt
---
The math is off.
---
100% normal game
---
100% bloodHUNT
---
5*103=515%
---
= you ge4 a total of 715%.
---
I‚Äôm fine lol I just don‚Äôt use that combo anymore so I thought they took it away
---
Awww just look at Rin
---
people rarely do flashlight saved these days
---
üçÜ
---
There isn't no shouldn't, you are not entitled to surviving no matter how good you do
---
Also could try etsy as well! These are so cute and I hope she finds success in them!
---
/rDbdgonewild
---
The Plague could have sacrificed people, at least I like to think she did. Either willing subjects, sick people or criminals, to the gods. We don‚Äôt know exactly but you never know. Her devotion to the gods/The Entity is so strong that it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she did.
---
What do you mean by a per gen basis?  
---
The next gen popping after a trap/traps was/were put on activate the trap/traps.
---
not really. I read it all. Rip pig. you wanted to make a point and you made it.
---
This looks like something an edgy kid from 2009 would draw lol
---
Just curious are you sure they were a 4 man? Usually 3 genning themselves is a sign theres a lack of communication, like a 2 &amp; 2 set.
---
Wtf you were supposed to die now I‚Äôm mad
---
Why did you censor what you wrote?
---
The Silent killer: "A knife handle with no visable blade, carves through the fog like butter. Who knew "nothing" could injure someone"
---
Worst? No. Toxic? Kinda. The entity machine breaks too often, I olay as if the EGC doesn't exist. Timer is honestly too long to matter.
---
If a killer gets a 4k with NOED alone it's more on the survivors at that point
---
What‚Äôs up with that title, OP?
---
Spaghetti code dude. Just updating a game with code this twisted can break things that are seemingly unconnected.
---
Wow people are downvoting you for nobreason
---
clearly you‚Äôve never stood behind a little wall and stalked while tbagging
---
Just don't use it. Its safer not to.
---
Hell yeah lunge ftw you people need to keep running instead of doing that cause then you pay for it
---
*i am just now realizing after my twenty millionth time seeing one of these posts that the reason gens have been finishing extra fast for me compared to usual may or may not have been because of this bug I might wanna start checking their perks before I leave if it goes suspiciously fast uhoh*
---
Mmm... true. Alot of more thought needs to be put in.
---
But the ideas are good. You should think of ways of how to make them work. Not the BHVR way of just; (lets put the perk in and see what happends) way
---
Wow, 100% nailed it!
---
Not counting bugs - i know wake up is fucked right now but its more of a "survivors are toxic fucks" kinda thing rather then the game is sided
---
wow you ran an OP building n i c e
---
I‚Äôd want like a succubus or something that controls the survivors so instead of repairing and healing they have different affects
---
O shit happy gruesome geteou day
---
I really don't like it either, I think it's TOO quiet. I get they're trying to balance the levels but this isn't it. I can't even hear the menu music anymore, it doesn't seem like this is what they intended by balancing the music levels...
---
What?
---
yea he looks like he took a blood bath
---
‚ÄúSo how‚Äôs your day been buddy? We haven‚Äôt spoken much since I, heh, left your for dead.‚Äù
---
I think they should remove Myers stun sound altogether and leave GF's alone. The stun sound keeps me playing him.
---
Plus the fact that, for a stealth character, he really seems quite fast. I know he's the same speed as most of the other killers, but something about actually playing against him, he seems way faster than he is. I feel like he should be slower by default but get a temporary speed boiat to higher than the current speed right when he exposes someone by stalking them. You know, actually encouraging play the way it's supposed to happen. As is it seems like half of the ghostfaces I play against don't even use stalking and never try to expose people (maybe they find themselves too easy to detect but in my experience as survivor that is not the case).
---
I would be perfectly fine with him getting a large speed boost after exposing someone such that it's specially guaranteed that if you're marked you will die, so that people are much more alert in trying not to be exposed. Might need some buffs to balance it out if that were the case
---
As someone with hundreds of hours on Killer.
---
That Ghostface was being toxic.
---
To be fair, I've done this to asshole survivors, but with just this gif for reference, yeah this was toxic.
---
Hahaha just the Texas flag instead of USA
---
I use both tbh.
---
I'm a weenie so I use Spinechill, Premonition, Stake Out, and Urban Evasion.
---
Premonition is really good in combination with Spinechill to figure out where the killer comes from so you don't walk into him when you try to get away.
---
Dude played as survivor with a brake hook daily. The first gen popped BEFORE I got a damn hook.
---
Tough call, I think chase perks are probably nice on any killer, but I've never used them with doctor myself. I personally try to use the power to stop them from using the pallets and windows, after shocking them, they stay stunned from using their action button to do anything for a solid 2 seconds roughly, usually gives me time to rush them, switch to melee, and whack them, while they are seemingly standing still, probably spamming the action button in hopes it works in time, or a good survivor while often run a different way, knowing I've cut them off from their intended path or pallet drop. Bamboozle and spirit fury + ensuring may very well be nice backup perks to ensure you always have extra help in the chase, I can honestly only recommend mixing it up and experimenting. I use distressing and any add-on that increases that static field effectiveness, because I knew from going against doctors, that the giant terror radius can be a pain, as you'll quickly get to madness 2 + 3 if you don't immediately run to the clear opposite side of the map, especially if they use even rarer add-ons. Since I have the bigger terror radius, I figure hey, a perk to compliment that doesn't hurt/makes sense. That clown perk Coulrophobia could also work wonders, slow their healing down immensely, combine that with sloppy butcher, which gives them the mangled effect, and they'll be healing forever, and if they heal in your terror radius, they'll quickly go crazy.
---
Visual effects i mean. (Like how wraith, pig and Ghost face have the little black smoke on the side of thier screen when using thier power) you could change those up.
---
What to you play on
---
there are many more exploits this patch. sprintburst one is as annoying as Wake Up
---
Devs: *create a bug that ruins the game* 
---
Also devs: *ban people who use it instead of fixing it*
---
Console
---
I feel sounds aren't consistent. Occasionally I can walk right up to survivors and other times it's like they can hear me across the map.
---
Not counting people who use spine chill.
---
that‚Äôs such a funny idea
---
i managed to do a save with it today :3
---
Left bumper
---
That's good man!
---
this game is balanced like this now
---
SWF &gt; Killers &gt; Solo Survivors
---
so it's quite balanced most of the time
---
Better matchmaking like a system where you can see players tendecies before game start. Game is survivor sided when every survivor mechanic is broken? Ok
---
No but I wish I had that‚Äôs hysterical
---
I wrote something about "Do you need help?". Can share the chat if you will
---
Lol, quite*
---
My theory is that she either killed or abandoned her mom.
---
No one was a bill, the last one had unbreakable and they aren't high enough rank to have teachables
---
Yeap, balencing for platform users.
---
That is why I said supposedly cause I dont know either. But in the off chance they did I expect the same with this wake up stuff.
---
me: crouches out in the open to survivors working on a gen
---
me: HOW could they SEE ME
---
"My day? It's been pretty good. I just bought a pony made of diamonds, because I‚Äôm rich. So, you know...that‚Äôs cool. 
---
Kay, bye."
---
Dwight is fucking gay
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs evil incarnate, he has superhuman strength and he‚Äôs almost impossible to kill, all while walking at the speed that you run.
---
About the wife?

Is this still in the game or?
---
What is happening?

---
Swf isn't balanced and never will be because it breaks the game just like nurse breaks the game with its mechanics
---
"I play like a cunt to get a reaction"
---
Ah, I see, there's a wall involved.
---
Basically I escaped the match but it didn‚Äôt register and I went outside the map. The killer couldn‚Äôt reach me either till I came back in.
---
What is sprintburst one, didnt notice it?
---
Or just fall off the map till you spawn back inside then go to the hatch/ other gate.
---
Coming from someone who has hit rank one (Many many times) rank does not matter nearly as much as you think it does. Rank 20's are brand new players so a rank 12 going up against them is like going up against a nurse that never misses a blink.
---
Resource packs, you can get banned for using them though
---
 Fell off the map yesterday and it kept me free falling until the timer ran out, friends spectated me and it was me getting stabbed in a black space.
---
Maybe make it take 15- 30 seconds to rebuild and within that time the killer can see your aura.
---
Nope never happening he has his own he can keep his own game plus what would his power be anyway
---
*Takes deep breath.*

#**EXTRA** [**THICC**](/intensifies)
---
I ask this here because I haven't seen anyone mention it anywhere else, is one such bug regarding his perk with the obsession? What I mean is that, the description of his perk says that when someone rescues *the obsession*, the rescuer becomes the new obsession. However, this is not how it plays out, as currently in my experience, whenever anybody rescues anyone, not the obsession, they become the obsession. Is it a big in the perk? or is it an incorrect description and that's how it's supposed to work?
---
Unless they have fixed a ton of stuff in that game, I doubt it lol.
---
I stalked someone through a window on autohaven, and I couldn't see them when standing or crouching, so I had to teabag up and down while stalking for it to count, and the survivor started teabagging back, I might have it clipped.
---
I actually do need training wheels, what are the perks?
---

i think you missed the point of the video but alright.
---
That‚Äôs the good stuff I‚Äôm talking about. People hitting me with the ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt it cancel your stalk‚Äù like something in a BHVR game works like it‚Äôs supposed to
---
Maybe if you didn't spell it **"Bois"** and didn't have that annoying music going and the basic text....
---
The egc timer doesnt stop completely,  it slows down quite a bit tho
---
_misses swing_ **AHHH OPTIMAL SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS**
---
It was a 1-day temp ban, the same for the 2 killers thing (I believe)
---
Or not. That‚Äôs why it looks identical. (?)
---
it‚Äôs actually a weird glitch having to do with pallets right now. it‚Äôs really odd
---
Good job baby claud! Proud of you!
---
either shes your actual wife and that second part was just untrue or she is not your wife and you didnt have to call her your wife in the first place?
---
When killers could run Iron Grasp and Agitation to make it to the basement from literally anywhere was insane too.
---
This is so pure. üòä
---
It's a free weekend and sale again, so especially right now I would not trust "newbies" to actually be new. All the more if they behave like this person did. Not seldomly, they are back-up accounts of people that have cheated and possibly been banned on their main, or alternate accounts they've acquired with the intention to cheat.

---
I thought Feng was Korean
---
Yeah
---
Ah I‚Äôm a Survivor main and very rarely play at killer so only 16. In California.  Must just be lots of noob killers because of GF then.
---
I mean he had a teammate DC, and two die. I'd feel pretty accomplished for just surviving, but I am also brand new to the game lol.
---
even still, at least in mid to low ranks, if one or two people bring a flashlight, it's apparently instant cue for the killer to tunnel, camp, and use Franklin's (often along with every other powerful or "toxic" perk they can to just run a basic power build rather than a coherent build in which the perks work together). I mean, I can't be mad at the perks, Franklin's is just super annoying but makes sense even if I don't think flashlights are deserving of it, it just bothers me that whenever they see a flashlight they go out of their way to be as annoying to the survivors as possible. Like c'mon dude I'm not even someone who's good at or toxic with the flashlight, I never use it because people instantly try to counter with Franklin's. I just want to use some powerful items before I prestige and lose them all.
---
IMO Franklin's is by far the most annoying killer perk, I don't think it's overpowered or anything, I just find it really fucking annoying as it practically invalidates any powerful item you want to bring and it's not really an option to "just not get hit"
---
This game isn't supposed to be scary guy
---
Have fun not playing the game.
---
This has been happening since last tuesday. Aka before Double BP
---
Baby killer
---
I mean, yeah but nah.
---
All we're seeing is a tiny part of the end game.  For all we know, the survivor's could've been asses the whole game.
---
Like, yeah, the gif shows you acting like an ass.  But you own up to it, and I've seen worse than that.  Plus, you provide a bit of context that the survivor was at least just as toxic as you were in post game.
---
And you're getting upvoted now :P
---
Hold Crouch
---
Hold Sprint
---
Hold Movement
---
Release Crouch
---
Now you can run around without using SB and have it on command by releasing sprint for a short while
---
Can the Adam mains and Jeff mains unite to fix bad head cosmetics?
---
‚ÄúW-watcha want? You b-better back the fuck up before you get s-smacked the fuck up‚Äù
---
Kinda bad, but still not that game breaking as mom was, and that's saying something
---
So why did you block yours then?  LOL. It‚Äôs just odd you only blocked yours. I can see doing none, or all.
---
I've been having the same problem!I dont know if its s internet issue or a dbd issue right now
---
I believe you dont lose points for proximity if a survivor is nearby
---
In one sentence you agree tbagging is shitty, but the very next sentence you say they did nothing. So which one is it?
---
These are actually really cool
---
There's a axe in huntress butt
---
Ah I gotcha. If it's anything like the past couple of killers that should normalize in a week or two. See you in the fog!
---
Never happened to me but I would truly rage if it did
---
Unnecessary caption
---
Is she your wife or not
---
I do this but like, not to kill them, I‚Äôll do it to scare them, but I won‚Äôt let them die. I‚Äôll close hatch in their face let em wiggle out at the gate, open it, slug em, pick them up when they‚Äôre about to leave, then put them at the start and let them crawl again to give em a scare. If the timer gets too close, I‚Äôll pick them up and put them down again right at the very exit so they don‚Äôt die. I just like to mess around, but I always give the last survivor the escape in the process. 
---
Doing this to force the entity to kill them? That‚Äôs just a dick move.
---
wow! Immediately downvoted.... perhaps people in this community don't believe in sharing happiness
---
Well thank you and have a good one.

I just end up chasing whichever is doing the 200 IQ crouch behind some tires, as they are probably the easiest to catch

New Killer: The Caretaker (Jack Torrance)

New Map: The Overlook Hotel
---
Wake Up gives a 15% increase to all actions, including gen repair and pallet/window vaulting speed. People are running 4 man SWF with toolboxes and doing gens in 2-3 minutes.
---
This is freaking amazing, best cosplay I may have EVER seen. It's so detailed and it fits you just right
---
Hubba hubba damn 100/100 would bang
---
Because one is intended, the other is cheating? You gonna download speedhacks next and say "killers ran NOED they made me do it!"?
---
I call her my wife but she ain't my wife.
---
Killer queue times are long right now because of the recent release of ghostface and the event cakes giving more bloodpoints. I've noticed it's also harder to get a killer match during this time of day in general. Just be patient, queue times for killer are 10-20 minutes, you'll get a game eventually.
---
Sure, decapitated- but not by Jason. Lori is the one who killed Freddy in the end, whilst Jason sunk to the bottom of the lake. There was no ‚Äòclear‚Äô winner, both fucked each other up and then Lori stepped in and got Freddy.
---
Damn that‚Äôs a lot of achievements, good for you man. I know I don‚Äôt have the time/patience for that
---
I call her my wife but shes not my wife.
---
Yep. I think everyone wants this to happen if I'm honest because I just have 28 padded jaws, 30 coil springs and 29 trapper gloves, and I know I probably won't ever use them on my trapper.
---
15%? Holy shit I can only imagine how fast gens would go
---
I didn‚Äôt know idubbbz played DBD
---
Controls one survivor at a time and the survivor you control takes on the killer abilities ... while controlling a survivor your succubus killer stays where you were until a survivor comes over and disrupts your mind control
---
Peanits is a liar. There is no internal code for saving data on which perks a survivor used and there aren't going to be bans for using a perk the Devs bugged with their pathetic spaghetti code.
---
But he exposes you before you snap him out of it ü§îü§î
---
Thanks again! &lt;3
---
I gotcha.  For some reason I always thought it was after at least one gen popped and every trap placed after just started ticking down.  Didn't realize it was only after a gen that's been completed since the trap was put on.  That kinda makes me rethink how I've played her slightly
---
It can happen only if there is no space between a pallet and another and have to put another pallet ignoring the distance rule
---
Noobie killer here why are you downvoted?
---
You bet. I've only ever 100% one game (Borderlands 2 on PS4), which was A LOT of work, so I get the grind.
---
If he didn‚Äôt lung at that pallet you‚Äôd be dead.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Ik i got lucky a few times in this
---
Overall good loop :)
---
why Killers &gt; solo survivors is balanced ?
---
Both of them running increase  mark add-ons and stalking same survivor makes me wanna nut
---
Using the 2 killer exploit I see
---
To be honest you would think that with double BP already being over and gf being out almost a week that the lobbies would be getting better but...they're still trash.
---
I'm actually starting to wonder if it's something on BHVR's end.
---
I think it‚Äôs the exact opposite.
---
Someone can heal themselves while the person near them does the generator.
---
Sure, the healing takes twice as long, but I think it still saves time overall.
---
I haven‚Äôt done any sort of test or anything on that, though, so maybe it makes everything take longer, I dunno.
---
not gonna be many new players so its gonna be tough to start with but the more you play and gain  some perks that are useful to you the better you'll be and have a bit more fun.
---
I think just perma aura reading would've been a good alternative too. Once the perks spent you can't hide anymore basically
---
And 12 seconds of each gen
---
They've actually gotten worse. Every day my games take 20 more mins.
---
Odd flex but ok
---
Cuz of the stupid ass bug yea. Honetly I think wakeup deserves a buff or even a rework but God I hate this bug rn. Every time I play killer and see a Quentin I'm bringing a mori
---
I think the same tbh, they have fucked something up.
---
It's that bow tie, it's that damn Microsoft Paint Bow tie
---
TBH I am not a completionist either. Only other game I 100%ed was Skyrim but, maybe coz these two are my favorite Multiplayer/Single Player games of all time.
---
yea. That's great
---
3 seconds can make a difference when killer closed the hatch.
---
It took 4 of them for one kill.  So in other words, all have 1/4 of a kill
---
So...wraith is Just a swole boy with a Bell?
---
[Listen buddy](https://youtu.be/oI3DlIrvoHg)
---
But that's incredibly situational, and there are waaaaay better perks you could use. We'll make it saves 8+ seconds every time you safely save someone. Leader shaves 5 seconds off the gate if you let a teammate open it, and also works as a pseudo botany knowledge for nearby teammates.  Decisive strike gives at LEAST 30 seconds to your team against a tunneling killer. Wake up is garbage.
---
It's a bug hes stuck there and cant get out. Just clear the survivors and close the hatch, open the door and get a free kill
---
lol
---
Well... You are right.
---
Distributed Denial of Service is an online attack caused by a botnet. When a computer is infected it becomes a zombie. All zombies together form the botnet. The DDoS attack works because all of these computers will attempt to make a connection to your internal network which overloads it and causes any valid data to never be received.  
---
Tl;dr
---
computers send lots of data, relevant data cannot reach you. Your connection is part of that relevant data.
---
No, if you're smart you can let your exaustion cooldown to a 1 second left, and then run places without it hitting 0, so you can use it next time you run instead of immediately.
---
Same here. Borderlands 2 is my all time fav, and with BL3 coming out, it's the only game I've ever wanted to 100%.
---
you lost me when you started complain about ruin like just hit great skill checks lmao
---
https://youtu.be/oI3DlIrvoHg
---
There are just some things that you got to do. Like staying on a gen and completing then getting downed. NOT because you didn't see ghost face and are an idiot, but because you're brave enough to be stupid
---
Not when you cant find any chests
---
Yeah! And also, look down on the left. There are only 3 people!
---
The same post again?
---
Be more creative with these baits
---
I totally get that!
---
Assuming that someone doesn't have prove thyself it takes 80 seconds to do a gen by yourself.
---
It takes 16 seconds to get healed
---
It takes 32 seconds to heal yourself
---
That means that 16 seconds you could be working on a gen with someone else 
---
It takes 12.8 seconds to heal yourself with a green medkit and 8 seconds to search a chest.
---
You get 2 heals from a green medkit meaning each heal takes 16.8 seconds. It is always quicker for you to get healed by someone however if there is no one available pharmacy is nearly twice as quick as self care.
---
Except because you're taking longer to heal there's a higher chance of the killer finding you while injured and downing you quickly.
---
it's stupid and wouldn't make sense
---
He's not throwing salt, just explaining that a perk that is specifically for stubs should apply TO ALL STUNS including DS since it's a stun. What don't you seem to get?
---
Jesus, that's crazy to me that people can do that. Fuckin rediculous really
---
But why
---
First thing I do is get basement chest. Not that hard to do plus it means the killer won't find you straight away because you are trying to gen rush. 
---
Basement-&gt; search chest while killer is checking gens-&gt; get on gen killer just checked.
---
Tbh when I first started playing I was a Quentin main, and I thought wake up and pharmacy were op lmao. Since learning, I just hate how 70% of perks on both sides are garbage

Would be interesting if one of either the killer or the survivor in the chapter had the shining. Would be an interesting ability.
---
Using a Party Starter to save isn't toxic. 
---
Using DS isn't toxic. 
---
Being Flashlight saved isn't toxic. 
---
I'll give you the t-bagging and noise notification spam (the fast vaulting). Everything else is literally jusy the survivors playing the game and you choosing to be a victim somehow.
---
But you came here for validation, so good job getting a kill and turning into the toxic player you're claiming to be somehow better than.
---
I always just bring a toolbox and crouch behind a rock or tree with urban and spint burst
---
\*gg ez
---
Gotta give them the full dbd experience
---
You can in a kyf lobby if you and some buds download the 1.0 version on steam. I don't remember exactly how to do it but I know it's possible
---
103 x 5 = 515% Cmon a 6-year-old can do this math.
---
I hate urban and sprint burst. I used to run urban but now I just walk instead of hoverboard everywhere. The killer doesn't tend to find you and you can still juke. Plus balanced landing &gt;sprint burst
---
The game is in an absolute state right now.
---
Misty take notes (No0b3‚Äôs kitten)
---
You're weird.
---
It‚Äôs an asymmetrical game the killer is supposed to be more powerful than a solo survivor
---
Did you read like his 4th comment when it's all alternating caps ree ree'ing about how getting decisive stiked isn't fun for the killer.  That looked pretty salty to me.  And the reason Enduring shouldn't affect ds is because ds was reworked to fairly only affect a babykiller who tunnels off hook.  Campers shouldn't be allowed to negate that by running Enduring and simply carrying on with their camp and tunnel.  DS was designed to punish that toxic playstyle so running an incredibly popular and widely used meta perk shouldn't bypass that.
---
Talking about all survivorsü§ì 103 x 4 = 412% + double bloodpoints = 512%. Big brain.
---
You're the silent killer, Toby!
---
Well unless you have something super obvious like survivors are bright orange then you most likely won‚Äôt get banned
---
This kinda creates a predicament, though.  I want to put DBD away for a while until it gets the matchmaking fixed, but if I do that I will miss out on the birthday event...
---
Fuck yeah dude.
---
The best feeling in DBD is completing a gen in a killer's face right before they hit you.
---
One time I finished one in front of a Huntress after a DS.
---
That shit is like cocaine.
---
That's how they did the Legion Double Blade thing and they did ban abusers of it once they announced they were going to ban people who used it. 
---
Basically they do collect data on matches seemingly, they said with double blade people who played clown for example, and then suddenly broke out Legion with Double Blade all the time would be punished. (I.E. a Clown main suddenly switches to Legion and uses double blades over and over around the time the bug became known) Maybe this is how they get data for how often perks are used, etc.
---
I honestly just want it hotfixed. People who abuse it should be punished. Same thing, if you use Wake up all the time as part of a build, or going for Adept Quentin then fine, but if Bob suddenly goes from never using wake up, to using wake up with his 3 SWF buddies alongside Resilience, Prove Thyself, and No Mither with engineers toolboxes with Socket Swivels and Clean Rag + a shroud of binding over and over, it's blatantly obvious Bob and his buddies heard about the bug, and are using it for the ultimate gen-rush meta.
---
Nice! It's called "Faerys Galaxy Perks - blue edition".
---
Heaven
---
Well I mean people in the internet will harass you just for what they think your personality is
---
Good
---
Right? I just want to get 1 cake on all my characters. But survivors you gotta level like 10 times to get 1. Killers are easy but it's still a lot.
---
I'm literally deaf and I would have saw that Meg.
---
i knew the lunge animations are something i need to adjust to but i didn‚Äôt know it was this bad
---
You don't, you just make everyone laugh üòÇ
---
Especially when your argument is feel based and when countered you just scream 'KiLlErMaINs" unironically ü§£
---
This is just comical. How on the Earth the Hag has low gameplay slowdown boggles the mind.
---
Man, I want to do this so bad! I've gotten the pulling animation before but never pulled someone off.
---
Someone can only DDoS you if they know your IP. That's why most people use a VPN client like PrivateInternetAccess. It redirects all your traffic to a neutral server that sends it on to its destination and sends any information you want back.
---
I live in the Netherlands but if you were to trace my IP, you'd end up in Belgium because my VPN connects to Belgium.
---
I wish this was an actual thing for a bigger game mode, I've made a post about a 6v2 simply inspired from the glitch.
---
Idk. Just called her my wife and we went from there. Just like when I call someone my brother, just that close I guess.
---
I rate this meme not an ebony mori/10
---
Good to know. Thanks man
---
he was talking about a survivor team.
---
you can't be alone in an swf...
---
Run spirit with prayer beads. That‚Äôs the Gen grabber build
---
You know in spite of the fact that they all died, judging by the points it looks like it was at least still a decent game
---
Jeff was too busy being crucified
---
It won‚Äôt last long if this is the negativity he‚Äôs given for wanting to try
---
Nah, this mode would be too much killer sided....
---
Beautiful
---
you should upgrade your ability to take pictures or to make a screenshot.
---
I like how this wasn‚Äôt the lazy cosplay I see sometimes where people just threw on a white button up and glasses. You went the extra mile and got the details right.
---
Why would it need to make sense? who plays DBD for the lore?
---
I would rather just be hooked than put up with the "will or won't he let me live."
---
Can‚Äôt play till July 4 RIP
---
Thanks bro
---
I don't think this is a comparable example at all, a sister is a blood relationship you cannot change and a wife is a person you choose to marry
---
Time to switch up the meds, bud.
---
lol don't moan and whine if you get banned for abusing an exploit
---
I run those two because in my swf (the only time ill play survivor) we have a p3 claud who runs the killer all game, a newbie who helps me with gens and a guy who messes up gens. So i basically have to do gens and save my teamates, so i run the basic bitch loadout, Sprint burst, Urban Evasion, Self Care (if i ever get hit when the killer finds me) and Adrenalin (everyone on my team runs that)
---
Gonna be honest with you man, that‚Äôs kinda weird
---
very very nice!
---
Is the Billy's name actually max
---
So they want us not to report things cause they supposedly already know who is doing it. So then why did they make a report system and why are there so many people still abusing the system with bugs and lag switching?
---
That‚Äôs 1751% extra bp for everyone, make sure you use an ebony mori next time.
---
Small game, and detective tapp has one but I can't remember off the top of my head :)
---
You would be surprised
---
I get why you blocked yours. And I meant my query to be lighthearted, in case it didn‚Äôt come off that way. I *think* the rules are to omit all names but I‚Äôm not the rules police so I‚Äôm not certain that‚Äôs still the case. (And I might be thinking if the DBD forums)
---
Haha, yea, that works not as you thought :D
---
you say better deadhard that doesn't require being injured is not game-breaking? lol
---
If youre going to hell for that, there must be a special place for me cuz i used to give people the hatch. And then grab them out of it and hook them
---
&gt; Killer queue times are long right now because of the recent release of ghostface
---
almost no one play him anymore. I played a lot today and i think i only saw one Ghost face.
---
Killer queue time are long 'cause playing solo survivor is really "exhausting" and frustrating. So a big part of the playerbase just stick to killer.
---
r/Dbdgonewild
---
I worded that wrong what I meant was that if the game is played in the way it was intended. Which is a group of survivors that can not communicate across the map(area voice chat is something I am 100% for). Then the killer is supposed to be more powerful. But then it comes to a swf the fact they can communicate puts the killer at a disadvantage
---
But it's a different studio that handles the Saw franchise licensing, who is likely more willing to change the licensing agreement. If Warner Bros. doesn't want to alter the deal for what BHVR can offer, then there simply is nothing that can be done.
---
Still solo survivors are weaker then killers because of the community mindset - they behave as if they were playing swf while they are not - they should run perks like bond to help them find each other or actually use stealth , meanwhile they behave like toxic morons trying to each run killers around pallets for no reason - swf works si≈Ñce this strat gives other survivors clear signal they can do gens  and an exact moment they have to stop doing gens si≈Ñce the killer gave up or is heading their way
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll check them out.
---
I feel like Danny is around 20 to 30ish
---
What are you getting at here? It‚Äôs common knowledge DBD is unbalanced
---
Great comment üòÇ wow we need more people like you that likes to help without any bias!
---
#sarcasm
---
I really like the first one, altruistic demise. Would kind of help with tunneling and farming.
---
So I go to school, make a friend and the friend and I become clsoe enough we basically turn brother/brother or brother/sister. But now with the same scenario instead of bro sis its husband/wife is a problem.  Alright.
---
Remind me why We need postgame chat again.
---
Maybe they're jealous... lol. There's no reason to downvote. Good job!
---
Altruistic demise seems completely useless
---
that's balanced, because it means coordinated survivors can take the killer down. solo survivors can take a good killer down if they work together. we're talking about the majority  tho.
---
this kind of games SHOULD require the group to try to work together and coordinate to take the power role down. that's what we have now
---
I‚Äôm a killer main but I would mostly recommend The Hillbilly, easiest (for me) to learn, good map pressure. That being said you should still watch videos to see which one you are interested in.
---
I don‚Äôt see any Janes XD
---
I'm fine with that honestly.
---
No, but you can vault and fake a run direction only to double back, but with I'm All Ears you can tell they've done it and moonwalk back again. It just helps.
---
Like no mither lmao
---
well like if youre using romantically charged words to describe each other it is either an inaccurate sentiment (brother/sister would be more apt) or y'all should just date
---
Purple box with sockets and wire spool actually saves an extra 5 seconds compared to the sockets and rag tbh. It's the better loadout for commodious and regular toolbox tho.
---
yea I would. I haven't been blinded during pick up in a few months and I haven't seen flashlight saves when playing survivor either. The only saves I saw lately were head-ons and pallets, both quite rare. purple/red ranks
---
Pft, it's peanits. I don't care what he says, cannot be trusted
---
Thanks man &lt;3
---
It's gone now I've got BBQ and Chili on him, but yeah. I basically use it if I've got nothing better. Interestingly it only came into effect twice on him since I used it.
---
Dwight have mercy!!
---
Btw that killer was monto

Hi! I have made some posts about some bug in this update that you should definitely fix. If you want to see it you can check my profile...
---
why you toxic, bro?
---
No mother lets you fully heal yourself from the dying state. You almost never get the chance but it technically has a benefit.
---
That was hilarious XD
---
Honestly,I enjoyed F13 until the Jasons got good. Then it just became a grab and choke fest. It was fun when the Jasons would DC because we set him up for a Jason kill victory. Rarely happens because the guy playing Tommy is usually the knob that dies first, but hey.
---
This is soooo fake. There is no ebony mori.
---
Yep. That‚Äôs the idea. It gives killers the ability to leave the hooked guy alone. Also, a nice alternative method to avoiding BT and DS, since the hooked guy is pretty much safe. Also gives survivors the ability to play around the perk since they can rescue injured with no penalty.
---
claudettes p3 wasn't touched so there's that
---
I'm currently rank 12 from not playing for like 3 rank resets and am making my way back to rank 1. Yesterday as killer I had a entire rank 1 swf obviously with coms (idk about that tho) and I killed them all since you know I should be rank one rn but my God a full swf all rank one VS a rank 12 killer. We've done a pretty good job so far huh?
---
Yep - that's totally fair play. You don't leave, you get whatever happens in the process.
---
I think they should rework it to be similar to scratches mirror and give the add on a downside of considerably decreasing movement speed while shroud is active
---
It got nerfed? I didn‚Äôt hear about this until now, what did they change?
---
Hillbilly vs blendette
---
even if it was swf they should have queued with a red rank killer this is just blatantly unfair
---
If it transfers, you can have an easy down target after an unhook and can‚Äôt be called a tunneler
---
Just no. I‚Äôm a killer main, but some of these just seem ridiculous.
---
Altruistic Demise - Won‚Äôt even give the rescuer a chance for escaping.
---
No more games - So if a survivor successfully loops the killer, they get punished by vaulting another window if still in a chase? 
---
Brutal Damage - I could see this one working, it punishes the survivor for ignoring the gen more than usual.
---
Pretty frustrating tbh. Banning a survivor for breaking the game would be frowned upon. But sure ban the killer, as if there arent two sides to this game where both can be toxic and game breaking.
---
Tinkerer, sloppy butcher. Take your victim mentality elsewhere.
---
For anyone interested in knowing more like myself you can start here:
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y≈´rei
---
Look under the section ‚ÄúJapanese Afterlife‚Äù
---
How do you mean? A killer could basically instantly down a fully healed survivor attempting to rescue, all while having the ability to play around DS and BT.
---
That's what i would be like as a killer lol &gt;.&lt;
---
I feel you when I was doing my adept achievements every game had at least 1 red rank with the rank 10s
---
the cutest 360 ever
---
I bought the game yesterday...  Fak
---
Did they announce a date?
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be realistic. You think there‚Äôs a killer who has a bell that turns him invisible in real life?
---
gotta love a good Y33T
---
L
---
While this killer was being toxic we dont have his side of the story. Maybe David here was being a cunt and deserved it?
---
They just said by the end of 2019, [here](https://www.bhvr.com/survival-horror-game-dead-by-daylight-is-creeping-to-mobile/) is the link if you want to look yourself
---
People are gonna tell you it's a visual bug. It's not! I've done the math and this same post has been posted 76 times in the last 3 days. 
---
And before you ask. 
---
Yep wake up is broken.
---
Yep wglf is also a visual bug.
---
Yep ghost face is a little buggy but they are patching that.
---
No, I wouldn't call it a nerf.
---
DS is as balanced as it's gonna get m.o.m is useless and some survivors still cry about noed.
---
Permanent aura reveal seems a bit overkill. Permanent broken seems sufficient to me.
---
mw2 ya feel
---
Or you could just have an easy down a target and get called a tunneler
---
I‚Äôm running UE and I usually pop on average 2 gens by myself, except I get unlucky and run directly in the killer. I don‚Äôt understand the hate for UE.
---
For a gen jokey you are better off running:
---
Prove thyself = quicker gens
---
Pharmacy = medkit for you or to heal friends
---
bond = find friends and avoid people looping, also get heals off of team mates and find them to do gens with them w/ prove theyself
---
Balanced landing = get away from killer and hide (or you could use SB but BL is better when you know how to use it.
---
[*Bottle still breaks as you hit it*](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/f/f1/Teachable_bamboozle.png)
---
Except for the swamp. God I hate the swamp hatch spawns.
---
Ah. Thanks. I know it also comes out for the Nintendo Switch in the fall. I think September. I‚Äôm hoping our progress gets transferred over cause if not, then that‚Äôll suck.
---
Altruistic Demise is like Make your choice but for campers?
---
No More Games seems useless and stupid.
---
Brutal Damage seems like a good perk that will not be used since it is not meta
---
Nah. 
---
Dude, I played only survivor in this event and I was totally fine using wglf. Increase bp for survivors is an overkill.
---
You might not know but when some event had a slight benefit on bp for survivors the survivors lobby took forever. It's better this way
---
Starting to say of all the things in this game getting hooked and surviving is probably one of the most believable ones.
---
Actually didn't know about that. Would explain why I never find hatch on swamp.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was coming to the switch, that‚Äôll be pretty crappy if it doesn‚Äôt transfer progress
---
I'm actually a jeff main, don't know why no one plays him, he's beautiful :(
---
You don't look scared enough.
---
Also called, bugged lobby. Recreate it
---
Its not exactly deadhard - you get no iframes - and all i am saying is that mom was significantly more gamebreaking even more than that bug is

---
Correction not everyone uses it.  There are plenty of us that feel it is a completely zero skill crutch and prefer to earn our kills without the assistance of a 1 shot for playing the game poorly.
---
üê∑ Oink!
---
Trapper got too many kills, that's why he can't get any in the game
---
How can they tell who is exploiting it, they are full of shit and dont want to deal with reports
---
Yeah man. It‚Äôs officially confirmed. E3, the big annual video game event had Nintendo reveal it. Seems crazy but yeah, it‚Äôs actually going to be on a Switch lol.
---
Because it was harder to spot her because well she black
---
Oink Oink brother.
---
This is the dumbest idea  I ever heard.
---
but you can use it to dodge a hit too, because you get more speed and more distance
---
and yea, mom was fucked up. people are still crying they want it back which makes me cringe
---
It's the same for killer. I dreaded getting the ghosface perks they are all booty. He himself is very strong though. Off the top of my head the best are ruin, sloppy butcher, bbq , enduring, agitation, brutal strength, rancor, noed, nurses calling.  I probably missed 1 or two but you are mostly gonna see killers in red rank with these exclusively and if you don't have them you are about to get laughed at most the time.
---
It looks like a piece of pasta.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter if you‚Äôre well hidden, or if the killer‚Äôs on the other side of the map.
---
Huh.
---
Last week killer wanted to give me the hatch. We were looking for 5 minutes until he spotted it in the corner. Killer was just as annoyed as I was at that spawn, but it was a great bonding moment.
---
If you can't even fathom a killer getting kills without noed that speaks volumes about the holes on your killer game.  You clearly rely on the perk if this is your mindset.  If you take it off and play killer it will force you to become better.  If you ever want to learn how to properly play the role, I'd recommend popping off the training wheels.
---
While I think a unique capture animation would be neat, it would be very time consuming realistically to tie up a survivor‚Äôs hands and then hang them up, even more so if they were struggling. I think because the game takes place within the Entity‚Äôs realm, The Entity itself ensures survivors can endure being hooked several times, especially since it feeds on strong emotions (such as intense pain or desperation). All things aside, hooking a survivor is also just a nod to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
---
I don't think its really an anti-gen perk as much as it is a detection perk right?
---
Survivors waiting at the gate doesn't slow down the timer - slugging someone does. This killer is wasting more time overall than survivors would, so it's worse.
---
Hah, suck it blendettes, wheres your bush hiding now?
---
Okay cool ill try it out when pharmacy comes to the shrine
---
I'm not against killers being stronger as that's how the game is supposed to work. I'm upset because the mechanic of being able to stop him from stalking you is broken in certain instances. I play both Killer and Survivor, I have 962 hours of game play and a lot of that is as a Rank 1 survivor. I also know how tough it is playing killer at times because of games with gen rushing and survivors that know what they are doing. 
---
Killers are supposed to be able to have counterplay in order to give players a chance as each killer is strong in certain areas and others aren't. I'm fine with that, the game is meant to be killer sided and I understand that. What I don't understand is why they didn't test the ability of breaking Ghostface's stalking because I have looked directly at him with both my character and my camera point blank and he has still been able to stalk me to exposed. 
---
Here's the bottom line, I think ghostface is strong if he has the right perks, but overall I really think that they need to go over the mechanic and fix it as you are supposed to be able to break his stalk if you are close enough to him as he is about stealth, he isn't supposed to be a point blank Myers' that can just stalk you for free. If you're able to be close enough to him he shouldn't be able to stalk you as it's just a bit unfair to the survivor that is trying to use the mechanic they have been given. 
---
Take for instance a trapper that places traps in less traveled spots of the map. like small gaps, to catch someone. It takes planning and applying pressure to win the game as you have to manage 4 survivors that are spread across the map. Same for survivors as you have to, at most, know how to space gens and to lead a chase to waste the killers time. I see a lot of the time killers getting their ruin taken out at the start of the game and just getting looped by a decent survivor, I know how it feels I've dealt with it too but there has to be a clear way to somehow go against eh mechanics of certain killers to be able to play the game.
---
Just a rant about how BHVR needs to test their mechanics more, I'm all for new content but it's the same as Freddy being immune to blinding even if someone is in dream state and can see him. It's just something that has to be fixed.
---
Here‚Äôs a link. https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024643351-Dead-By-Daylight-coming-to-Nintendo-Switch
---
Damn, that‚Äôs awesome! I didn‚Äôt keep track of E3 this year so I had no clue
---
He brittish tooüòÇ
---
Wait theresm was an art contest? How did I spent so much time on reddit without knowing it.
---
Oh I wasn't referring to this situation specifically! When teammates DC it's nice to have at least a possibility to get something out of the match
---
The way 5e perk is wonder the health state wouldn‚Äôt transfer till they finish the unhook. Other than that it‚Äôs just make you your choice but it encourages camping instead of discouraging it
---
I thought billy also murdered all the farm hands and workers on the farm too
---
Great work! 
---
The amount of effort you put into the costume really shows. I like it. :)
---
Enduring is what counters STUNS, DS is a Stun it's in the wording lol,that's simply it.
---
Is there any where to see the actual submissions cos these are all so cool to look at
---
Lack of skill? 
---
Hmm.
---
It amazes me how many people exploit and cheat in this game...and people want to pretend it doesnt happen...lol
---
My only guess is it's your gf you plan on marrying?
---
For real! People at first shat all over the idea because it‚Äôs going to be 30FPS on the Switch but people saw live gameplay and the 30fps looks very stable so it kinda changed people‚Äôs opinion. Personally for me, i dont really care about frames and all that. As long as I can play w no lags then cool.
---
Groovy
---
Yea it‚Äôs like reverse make your choice. It could benefit campers, I guess? I mean if you plan on camping, you could just slap the survivor before the rescue and it wouldn‚Äôt even benefit you all that much. The point of the perk is to play around tunneling/DS/BT and occasionally adrenaline. 
---
No More Games, I‚Äôm not sure how you see it as useless. It‚Äôs like Spirit Fury but for windows. For people that love to run infinites until they are entity blocked, it would benefit the killer. Basically gives killer a free hit.
---
You're a pig main I want to hear it from you.  The people that complain about the changes to her egc traps fail to take in to account how absurdly broken her hatch close mechanic would have been with the old traps.  Address this balance issue in a way that takes that into account while supporting a reasonable buff to her.
---
i got in with barely 150 hours killer, damn...
---
How do you know?
---
Looks more like killer holding a survivor dodges other survivor with a flashlight and too the hook.
---
for me it's so fuckin' funny when a killer like Susie can destroy an entire team of Davids
---
Except you don‚Äôt get 2 heals from a green medkit, you get 1.75 heals.  Unless you find a friend or hit 5 great skillchecks, a green medkit with no add-ons or Botany Knowledge will only bring you to the healthy state once.  While you could run Ace in the Hole and Botany Knowledge, you‚Äôre then wasting between 50 and 75% of your build on healing yourself when you could have just run Self Care and a Common Medkit for better results.
---
It‚Äôs pc
---
Yeah, frame rate isn‚Äôt that much of a problem as long as it is still smooth. Got me real hyped now
---
He is powerful. You can hit stealth just to find a survivor because either you see them or they see you. Catching them in unaware = instant down.  Vs swf he isn't as strong but it still takes some coordination to mess him up.
---
Facts don't care about your feelings "dabs in Shapiro".
---
Cannot leave with traps, timer will be inactive.
---
Especially if you have Ace in the hole
---
I feel like it's more of something people had to be around us to understand. Probably idk. But dating is a hard no from both ends.
---
Did you read what I said at all or is your entire point based on vernacular?  If decisive ONLY works against camping tunnelers and was specifically redesigned to counter this, than why should a camper be able to run a perk that takes the one survivor counter to this and throws it out the window?  Babykillers could simply run enduring and continue camping and tunneling as normal since it affected ds stun time.  There is a reason devs are making this change and it is a very logical one.
---
This isn't entirely accurate.
---
First of all, if you heal yourself rather than having someone else heal you, that gives that other survivor 16 seconds that they can work on a generator for they otherwise would not have had. Since being healed by someone occupies 2 survivors' time, Self-Care is time-equivalent to being healed by someone, and if we then consider that the injured survivor without Self-Care would have to find another survivor to heal them in the first place, and that other survivor potentially also having to leave a generator to go to them and then back, that's not only less time-efficient, but also less reliable.
---
Healing yourself with the Emergency Med-Kit takes 16 seconds, as its healing speed buff only applies to other survivors you heal with it. I'm not sure how long it takes to loot a chest, and while Pharmacy speeds it up by 80%, the real time factor here is the running around associated with finding, getting to and from a chest. The Emergency Med-Kit can potentially give you two heals, but only if you hit great skill checks, which might not even always trigger for you to do so.
---
I think Self-Care still has its place as a top-tier perk, and has merely grown out of the (Western) meta, though I do agree that it's just pretty awful standing around staring at the healing progress bar for 32+ seconds. I think perks such as Adrenaline, Bond, Iron Will, and yes, also Pharmacy, are a lot more fun to use, and they are definitely viable, as well. And you can obviously also simply bring in Med-Kits, potentially with Botany Knowledge too. Which is a tip I'd give Pharmacy-fans to begin with: Bring Pharmacy, and as soon as you survive with one of your looted Emergency Med-Kits, next round bring that Med-Kit and replace Pharmacy with another perk; the next time you die and lose your Med-Kit, you bring Pharmacy again; rinse repeat and you technically have an unlimited supply of Emergency Med-Kits! (Using Pharmacy with Ace In The Hole is pretty good, especially given the chance to loot Styptics. Botany Knowledge also pairs well with it, of course.)
---
His bio says he used to be a rugby player
---
At least i think he is
---
Coz in his video
---
Same survior outfits (im from finland and my english sucks i dont know a better word)
---
Same place
---
Same killer
---
Yep. It‚Äôs ridiculous at this point.
---
Hahahaha so accurate. I dropped one earlier in front of GF and he looked down and then back at me. We starred at each other for 2 seconds until I decided to just run away lol. 
---
Useless and requires a specific angle and all that.
---
this + infectious fright = value
---
Yep everyone's been dealing with it since Ghostfaces release there has been like 80 other post about this.
---
I‚Äôm curious though if the game, at launch, will have all current survivors and killers.
---
How about balance the game and stop adding pointless click bait micro transactions and skins? Side not an Apache killer would be tight as fuck and you could call them "The Windigo"
---
Pog champ my guy I‚Äôve also recently started achievementhunting :p after I finish The MCC DBD might be the next target.
---
Everyone knows that.
---
Fuck no.
---
Ofc you can abuse it, i am not saying its good, they should fix that shit, i am just saying that mom was fucked up in comparison and that was not a bug.
---
So many people are doing this and none of them look the part for the game. You need to stop making it look sharp and clean, make the skin fit with dbd
---
Well then I apologize. I didn‚Äôt know and wanted to share it. When was it announced? If it was at E3 then that would be why I didn‚Äôt know
---
I thought they did. It was just Bruce talking about being in the game.
---
If your intention is to camp, you‚Äôre gonna ruin the game for everyone regardless of the perks you run. It‚Äôs to avoid perks like BT/DS/adrenaline. Also, you‚Äôre way less likely to go after the dude that just got off the hook.
---
I gotcha! Yeah I feel like ideally you would want to escape through the doors, but I guess any escape is an escape right? Lol
---
i know! and it's even worse when survivors do it. when killer exploit bugs, the community are all over them and actually ban players for abusing of a bug. but when it comes to survivors it just feels like it gets looked over. 
---
even though i know that's not the case at all, it really shocks me how different survivors and killers are treated by the community.
---
Take RNG off the Altruistic Demise and make it change the range with tiers
---
How is that remotely balanced.  If they cannot leave with a trap on that means you simply close the hatch and patrol boxes from a distance until you lay eyes on them and interrupt them on one.  Game over.  4k 100% of the time unless you're a full potato.  It isn't the timer that's the problem, it's that the hatch is no longer a means of escape for them and they physically can't leave a gate because the trap kills them.  You literally would have a shooting fish in a barrel situation everytime.
---
That's pretty much what I expected to see from you too.  You just want automatic 4ks with her when hatch closes
---
You gotta do this with more people and do the synchronized nail bite. Amazing cosplay
---
Had a stream where someone asked how he felt about lore and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt read lore, I‚Äôm a competitive player‚Äù
---
It's never specified in the actual lore, but in the art book that comes with the Deluxe edition, he's identified as Max Thompson Jr.
---
his fault
---
Well, *fuck it*.
---
Give 'em Karma, witty novelty accounts deserve 'em!  :-)
---
The pigs camping should be higher, she's a little under ghostface since she can't attack out of crouch as fast as him
---
She wasn‚Äôt really nerfed for her P3 she is still the same with jungle gym bricks on dark moon maps and she is still invisible in tall grass on lery‚Äôs and ormond.
---
Not really a nerf, they are just callling it that to appease the killers until they figure out they didn‚Äôt really buff her lighting :,)
---
they announced that on their anniversary stream and we knew this a month before it, ever since EGC was released
---
Ok I was confused because his bio says he was nameless
---
Camera + Infectious fright is just redundant. You why would you wanna go for anybody outside your terror radius if you have people within your terror radius. Plus the sound notifications on infectious fright would block your view for the Camera, potentially
---
The entity feeds on all emotions, rage, despair, hope, even affection that survivors have for each other it‚Äôs just an emotion vampire
---
no but ur getting downvoted
---
Oh shit lmao I never knew
---
Adiris isn't the actual plague itself, but a victim of it.
---
You forget what this community is like lol.
---
Well he's getting nerfed or fixed in my opinion soon so you might want to wait and see how that turns out
---
He's in the weirdest fucking spot ever when it comes to balance compared to ant state of any killer we've had.
---
In short we either are sweet to each other or we fight. Friends say we're like a married couple and I just started calling her wife from that. Then became back and forth
---
Imagine still being this salty so long after the nerf
---
All the best Man, if you need any help with DBD achievements feel free to DM me.
---
The perk literally does not work unless you camp
---
 But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning !
---
I would say he is kinda of how he is basicly pigs crouch and Micheal stalk but faster and can move faster I use spring burst and he is still right behind me like two steps behind me it's really hard to get away sometimes
---
He is basically shit in high ranks. He is fun to play though.
---
he's better than myers but worse than spirit, Nurse, Billy, Hag and maybe huntress. he's easy to loop plus his leather coat is extremely loud.
---
running neither is the best option

I'm actually really pissed about it because I always run that outfit I'm a Claudette main. No I don't use UE or iron will I'm not immersed. I just like to be able to to hide properly  when I need to without using a locker and now I can't because especially in game, it's SO noticable. Her pants went from dark brown to lighter than khakis. Maybe if they didn't also brighten the pink spot on the back of her P3 I wouldn't be so mad
---
Because the killers are super beefy beacause of the entity. They can pick a 200 pound man up with one hand and shoulder him easily, and then hold him with 1 arm whole walking normally. Even legion. The way killers are it's lucky the entity wants them hooked or killers would just punch the heads right off survivors :p
---
Gonna need a battery pack when it comes out for all that batt drainage. Lol
---
it has been posted for the 40th time \\\[T\]/
---
it's a visual bug, listed in the patchnotes
---
you still get the 4th stack, it just doesn't display it
---
Yes it was they brightened the pink spot on her back
---
It is 100% broken and giving you an unfair 15% buff to all action speeds all the time.  Take off the perk until they fix it
---
"The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest."
---
No specified member of soldiers killed. Plus you also have to remember that she murdered whole families (and accidentally killing little girls while trying to raise them), so no known number there either.
---
I‚Äôm gonna give you my personal opinion ( I‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted for having a personal opinion but whatever) I think he‚Äôs a bit much but not OP. Un cloaking him is so random sometimes it happens without you really focusing him and sometimes your literally up in his face on the other side of the pallet and it appears he seems to get expose you before you‚Äôre able to take his power away. Theres no downside to using his power he has no terror radius and when he‚Äôs getting revealed it will tell him from which direction he‚Äôs getting uncloaked. I think if they made the uncloaking more efficient and did something to show that you‚Äôre doing it properly he would be balanced.
---
Then remove it from the game and stop crying and I'll play the game properly.

Rob zombies H2 or the original?

My teammates peeking into the exit gate to watch me get mori‚Äôd

July 2nd. You can still use the cakes after the event though
---
the cakes will stay. you'll just stop getting them in bloodweb. like you can still be using them when they are gone from it. it's not particularly an event so...
---
making WGLF get stacks for completing a generator would go a long way
---
Again there are counters. You must be new.

Depiped?

Hey man I get where you're coming from. This is one of the problems with companies that are growing like BHVR. Although I'm a sucker for badass skins üò¨
---
you're in a simulation, boy
---
I remember that:)
---
Lol jesus bro.  Or plan b continue using it and never improve your killer play.  That's on the table too, and some players choose to only care about kills and they don't care how much help they receive to get them.  That's fine if you simply don't care about being a strong player but many of us choose to learn the finer points of the mechanics of the game and play without it to demonstrate some form of skill with our victories.
---
play more and you'll get better. you can google some tutorials from  [**OhTofu**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA)
---
Brutal damage would pair extremely well with surveillance, friend. And I happen to believe that surveillance is at least an A tier perk because it can give killer with no map pressure a lot of map pressure
---
Yep I even use the uncloak to find downed survivors or just Survivors in general.there is no risk to his ability because of how many ways you can use it and getting kicked out of the Shroud benefits you still giving away a position. Certainly an odd killer
---
Used to think it was hag.. but now getting into the higher ranks and coming up against this regularly.. 100% agree!
---
She has a knife they don‚Äôt lol
---
Depends how much time you waste finding a good hiding spot. I've seen many survivors run to the corner of the map to self care. 
---
Put it this way. 1 survivor is hooked, 1 is injured, 2 healthy. If the injured survivor goes and uses self care, that's 40s (I'm not certain of the times, but the ratio is correct) to heal. During that time 2 survivors have to try to safely unhook the other survivor before they reach stage 2 or are sacrificed. If one of the healthy survivors heals the injured survivor instead, that's 20s to heal. Then all 3 survivors have plenty of time to safely unhook the other survivor before they reach stage 2 or are sacrificed. More time with 3 survivors able to distract the killer/unhook their teammate is always better. Self care is a decent perk, but it's always a lesser alternative to being healed by a teammate.
---
it doesn't kick you with "Session Closed"? weird. if i spend in a lobby over 10 minutes it kicks me out
---
???
---
You care way too much about a game I play casually.
---
actually her weapon is a ruler lmao
---
i personally hate mobile gaming and that many big companies invest in it so much. maybe im oldschool but i only enjoy playing games on pc and sometimes on consoles.
---
Trapper is American by lore but I wont let anyone convince me he's not from Scotland or England. The name and the whole coal mining background just scream Victorian/pre-industrial Britain.
---
haha well you guys who are here are the coolest!
---
Oh I never use that shit knife is way better looking lol
---
But I thought Hag was your wife? I'd hate to see the repercussions.
---
Everyone has their preferences. I prefer console but also enjoy PC and mobile
---
First I never said there wasn't a counter but thanks for putting words in my mouth.  No I've been playing for years and have been rank 1 killer no noed crutch at least 12 times so I think it's safe to say I'm not new.  You and your astonishment that this game can be played without using the biggest crutch perk in it makes it appear that you're a pretty new player however.  If you aren't and have been playing a while that only makes it more sad though lol.
---
Read the TOS. Not gonna happen
---
I need these in my life
---
Lmao i got something similiar when i started playing this game, was rank 19 and got matched against rank 7 &amp; 9's(not full premade swf, two duoq's)... I got 3/4 so i was pretty satisfied about it and didn't complain even though the matchmaking must be really broken if shit like this happens.
---
This is also Clown's face when his Tonic again does not prevent fast vaults this patch.
---
Also, while I do enjoy chase-centric perk setups on Clown, I'd agree with /u/Xaoyu that he  more-so needs more help in the stalling area. Good thing that his own Pop Goes The Weasel has now been buffed to lend itself better to less mobile killers. I do think Brutal Strength is just too nice on him not to be used, whereas Bamboozle is not usually needed (at least not once his gas prevents fast vaults again...). BBQ, Brutal, Ruin, Weasel is pretty solid.
---
Im rank 4
---
How is he worse than these? Nurse is very hard to use because you need to time your blinks very prescisely, Hillbilly you can hear literally from the other side of the map, hag can easily be countered by using urban evasion , and huntress you need to have a good aim to use her. GhostFace cannot be countered, if you uncloak him, he knows where you are, dont do it and you cant know if he is near
---
The counter is to kill the survivor before the gates are powered.
---
Idk I've had it happened pre ECG patch and there was one other survivor left so I got three crows and kept the spirit distracted till my friend found the hatch then I quit. If I was the last one though, I'd probably have gone to bed with my Claudette in that locker. She just camped every single hook anyway
---
the screen jump each time is pretty funny to watch lol
---
I want El Mosco
---
They say the suffix "ito" mean small, which would hint at the existence of a larger and greater 'Mosquito'. The legendary....
---
[El Mosco](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/53/531dc7a9669933035bd74a8fd5649ab021a587ae_full.jpg)
---
I like pairing discordance with thrilling tremors, it provides some really good awareness which makes hunting survivors really efficient
---
I feel like NOED should only down you if you're on death hook. It gives its name more meaning as well.
---
You're almost dead? No one eacapes death!
---
That would also work but i feel like the killer needs something to discourage them and make them pursue surviors differently
---
I'm not sure how loud it is now in the game, but I've stared at several survivors from the bottom of the Mount Ormond hill gen and they didn't notice me until I exposed them.
---
I know in the PTB it was pretty loud, but I'm pretty sure they nerfed how loud it is, or the audio is fucked to hell and back.
---
Oink.
---
Luh fucking mao
---
Killers exploiting get banned. SUrvivors? "We'll see, we have to think about it, we need to discuss how we'll handle it"
---
fuck off
---
Yes you can though if the other Survivors do generators faster he will have to start patrolling also there is 2 perks to counter camping and tunneling which is borrowed time and DS and if the survivors aren't rushing hooks they might not camp
---
We can make camping bannable only if we abolish SWF and up queue dodge times to 10 minutes.
---
You know what, good for him. I dont see why people are acting like this in the comments, hell i dont like tru3, but he is trying to change. Lets just hope he can pull it together and keep his promise :)
---
The problem with Survival is it's all-or-nothing. If you escape, you get 5-7000 points; but if you don't, you're lucky to get 1000, even if you died right at the end of the match!
---
Matches should be divided into stages, and Survival points should be based on which stage you died in.
---
0-1 gens repaired/0 Survivors sacrificed = Early game = 0 bonus points ( like if you die at all, currently) .
---
2-3 generators repaired/1 Survivor sacrificed = Mid-game = 2000 bonus points.
---
4 generators repaired/2 Survivors sacrificed = Late game = 3000 bonus points.
---
All generators repaired/3 Survivors sacrificed = End Game  = 4000 bonus points.
---
you can hear his leather sound extremely well. he's basically a m1 killer if you have windows/pallets around you. and you get a sound when looking at him while he's stalking you.
---
They don‚Äôt get many bloodpoints because they aren‚Äôt doing anything
---
I will throw you down the stairs if you call nea a killer/the entity AND you play as her, not a true nea main
---
It was broken before the nerf, they just broke it again in the other direction.
---
Headcannon shes 18. And the entity likely prevents the killers from dying, I mean we can slash and hook a survivor so many times without them accidentally dying and we have to use a special offering just for the *chance* to kill a survivor.
---
Ignoring the point I‚Äôm trying to make, got it, this is bait
---
You need him in the center of the screen and your body also takes up some of the center so if your body is blocking him partially it might be harder to detect him
---
99% of the time when a killer is camping they will camp that hook till the survivor is dead regardless of gens done also borrowed time and ds are a joke as a killer main myself anytime someone has those they are dropped maybe 10 seconds after theyre off the hook also im not talking about killers camping defensively im talking first hook of the game they just sit in front of you
---
We need more Meg skins
---
I think its p good by itself tbh. i would prefer it to stay as it is bc i dont want it to eat my other exhaustion perks
---
OoO, spine chill counter him pretty hard. if you don't want to use any of these perks just look around you and use your ears.
---
really weird, you should've died.. guess that interaction exists
---
They get a full sacrifice worth of bp or more which is way more than the surv gets also if they are determined enough theyll get 2 survs completely dead which all adds up
---
So I just started playing 2 weeks ago, I've reached level 9 as a killer (hardly play survivor but I'm starting to now) I personally played hillbilly because he's not to hard to use. That being said his chainsaw on console is kind of tough to move around with but he can zoom across the map fast which helps if you're starting out. After getting use to billy I bought all the DLC, I wouldn't recommend it though unless you plan on playing this game a lot because it's kind of costly. If you want someone who is also pretty easy to use and has a pretty good perk I would recommend leatherface his barbecue &amp; chili is a pretty solid perk to have especially if you're having trouble finding people. I would also say to watch some videos on YouTube they helped a bunch on how to get familiar with characters and things to expect. But other then that the biggest thing is to keep playing. You'll notice you gradually get better the more you play and don't be afraid of losing. Hell sometimes I would walk away with one kill but I tried different tactics out I probably stayed in a chase for a little too long but I considered it practice on how to try and mind game someone when it comes to looping and things like that. 
---
Sorry for the long rant but I know for me who was new this game seemed like it would be super hard to get into but the things I listed here helped me a bunch so I'm hoping it does the same for you.
---
can't wait to get hit through the window without even knowing if it really hit me or not
---
Neither side should be getting banned for the devs being incompetent and absolutely breaking things. If they aren't going to fix it ASAP, then screw it, let the playerbase use it. Not our fault they fucked up.
---
Well that's completely different though that's facecamping also the killers that do usually get nothing out of it but since other Survivors are greedy for saves they basically encourage facecamping
---
Dwight in the Dominican?
---
I didnt ignore it i literally addressed it you said that banning them from being near the hook is not possible which i understand but if they are so close to the hook for so long its obvious they are just wanting you dead then they should be punished
---
It seems like they know this too (with the vanilla gameplay experiment and all). May I ask what balance issues you've encountered?
---
Even then they still de-pip and don‚Äôt get many bloodpoints at all because they will maybe only get a bronze or silver medal for sacrifices/hooking. They don‚Äôt get many bloodpoints at all. People only do it because their new and don‚Äôt know how to play or don‚Äôt know any better or they just want to make people mad or something
---
nobody misses the devs' content in tf2. the game is literally still kept alive by the community itself, like 90% of the population is concentrated in the community servers
---
They get 2000ish points per full sacrifice and if they manage to get a second thats even more bp not counting the points from the hits or chase or anything else
---
Yea I agree with this. For a perk that doesn‚Äôt give any other bonuses, the conditions could be a little easier to meet.
---
"Lol fuck you, killers got banned for using an exploit, but survivors aren't therefore you have victim mentality". Yeah, some of them weren't banned about the perks, but the Legion blades got bans.
---
Neither side should be getting banned for the devs incompetency and proper testing.
---
monstrous shrine OP
---
Patrick! What could be worse then a sneaky Ghostface?!
---
I know! -Two- sneaky Ghostfaces!
---
Please put these on Etsy or Storenvy!!! I want these so badly
---
I have a friend who honestly equips Wake up as a meme EVERY SINGLE GAME I know for a fact he never goes on any media platform for DBD so there is no way for him to know its actually breaking the game for him. Unless I tell him, there is no way they are gonna ban people, because there is no way for them to determine who is abusing it. He always takes an item in because I go plunderers/ace in the hole so he has items cause hes a noobie kind of. Also had a another friend (diferent) who did the speed bug/hack where you just edited the files and he got to rank 1 killer in a day and just kept doing it because he thought it was funny. Warned him he would get banned and he deserved it. Never got banned honestly think the games kind of going down hill. New chapter has only a killer no map no survivor, being released with nerfs already in place for a later patch just seems really shitty right now.
---
Everybody misses the devs‚Äô content in TF2- Jungle Inferno boosted the player numbers so high as it was the last major update, and the last time the devs actually did something. We‚Äôre now in the longest update drought in the game‚Äôs history, and a quick look at the subreddit will tell you people are getting worried that the Heavy Update isn‚Äôt coming anytime soon.
---
What a great map *Gen pops* OK, I can still wi- *another Gen pops* Wha-    *gates are powered*.        OK den
---
Swf is counterable im a killer main and yeah it can be annoying but thats why you use perks like discordance or infectious fright camping is just not fun and needs to be discouraged
---
10.4 seconds, actually (2.6s on gates).
---
Wake Up! obviously can't stay like this, but in its usual form, it's basically a non-perk.
---
You mean 515‚Ä∞
---
I'm with this guy. You guys are complaining about something that just makes sense on the killer to survival queue ratio. I'm not one of those guys that had nothing but good bp boosters on my survivors, but this event gave me enough to play and burn it up with WGLF and net about 70,000 avg, including the terrible games where, yes, I deal with survivors that are blatantly being dumb and those that unhook me early. If survivors were smarter, I wouldn't run Decisive. If killers weren't so campy, I wouldn't run Borrowed Time. But WGLF, what more do you want from that when it's doing its job 24/7 in any killer scenario.
---
Then you should lose bp or be banned for camping when theres 1 gen left there are 3 on the map and the fact that you hooked someone will make survivors stay away from it anyway
---
I guess the hotfix isn't implemented because they have difficulties trackng down the reason of the glitch.
---
Okay hahah thanks for providing how stupid you are
---
tl;dr much. I know it's dumb, I acknowledged that. But I think it would be nicely lighthearted, not like people would use the perks anyways. (Except maybe the hugging one because bonus BP for everyone is always a good thing)
---
I had a game where the three swf called me a noob for finishing the last two gens after two got hooked and their friend was looping the killer around them to "distract" them so I could "save" them.
---
Yeah, I'm not doing that when you are literally running laps around the two hooks with the killer. Someone is gonna die and I have the suspicion you'd sacrifice the rando.
---
The two hooked ones died and I got hooked, then yelled at by the other guy for not realizing he'd found the hatch and not suiciding.
---
Some people are just... Special ü§∑
---
Killer was trapper I was playing Bill with Left Behind (for Adept Bill) and Killer hooked last survivor right next to where I was hiding. The gen was about 30%. Survivor died, Killer immediately went to kick the generator and went looking for the hatch.
---
Lucky for me, Hatch spawned right in front of the hook where last survivor was sacrificed. Left Behind gave me boost and I managed to finish gen before taking hatch.
---
This achievement was always tricky even before end game collapse. Keep Trying man.
---
Only survs
---
3 gen-defence perks?!
---
I see you, too, are a person of culture.
---
Bugs me that Tru3 is whinging about having such a hard time as Ghostface, yet doesn't think to run perks which cover that character's weaknesses.
---
Agreed. Most of Ghostface's perks are a joke
---
This is incorrect.

While I honestly cant take a stance on whether or not they should, I think it needs to be fair to both sides. On one hand they knowingly use broken things to  assist them winning, on the other hand, the devs are the ones who broke it. But I think it needs to be fair.
---
That's the point, lighthearted and wholesome in a place where it's not really welcome XD

no

Don't let them downvote you. You're right, everyone saying Nurse is bad on console is obviously just very bad with Nurse.

They are all bullshit to be honest.
---
Source:  Been playing Killer recently and I've noticed I can hit people doing leaps through windows pretty much right before they land on the other side.
---
Most people thought it was dumb last time as well, its one thing to abuse bugs and hold games hostage or something but in this case its literally just equipping a perk or item. Its stupid anyone is banned for that. Fix the dang game
---
hahahahaha
---
Go fish
---
There will never be true balanced matchmaking in low active player population games that rely on active players for the game look at DOA Evolve and Battleborn.
---
1) do SWF if solo is gonna make you go to Reddit 
---
2) take a break from killer
---
3) it‚Äôs just a game, you‚Äôre not going to escape every game, and you‚Äôre not going to kill everyone every game, accept the shitty games that occasionally pop up and move on
---
That's not the host's decision, it's whoever does it and joins the game that's exploiting. The killer can't control that.
---
Thanks! Actually a lot of achievements need a specific perk or killer type to get it done. You just need to find right combo of your play style and character/perk that can do it.
---
For example Silent Approach, one of GF achievements can be done way easier with Spirit and Prayer Beads Addon. 
---
And for 'Not Today' simply abuse Deliverance. ;)
---
Hag with Rusty Shackles.
---
Yeah um ima have to let you know the cheif told me this aint it or ever will be it.
---
*Complains about camping*
---
*Someone says how to counter camping*
---
*Shoots down defence, saying it's not fun for the person being camped*
---
*Defends SWF by saying it has counters* 
---
Riiiiiiiiiiiiight... Guess the Killer's feelings don't matter, then.
---
Community Servers died with the QP update that excluded all community servers from being found through it.  Easier matchmaking led to more DEAD community servers than those who did it right.
---
The only community servers are things like 24/7 CTF 2Fort and if that's living I wish someone would pull the life support.
---
Camping is counterable im a killer main and yeah it can be annoying but thats why you use perks like decisive or kindred swf is just not fun and needs to be discouraged
---
Yeah 100% agreed.
---
Honestly since there's now a thing where you get emblem points and partial credit for gens and totems being done while the killer is chasing you, you should also get partial credit and emblem points for stuff done while you're being camped.
---
The changes were to help fix "I looped the killer for a good chunk of the match and depipped because I couldn't save anyone or do gens" 
---
I think "I was facecamped and depipped" should also be fixed. If you're on the hook and the killer is otherwise distracted from your team by camping you, you should also get a bit of credit for gens being rushed in the meantime. 
---
Also there's already a thing that degrades the killer's chaser emblem if he's camping hooks with no survivors around.
---
RIP Angrypug
---
pleasetheenititynite
---
 Because the killer is supernaturally enchanted by a spider god, the survivors are not.
---
This game is 4v1, not 4 concurrent 1v1s.
---
The actual issue was things like the QP update and a lack of dev interaction on any level.  Jungle Inferno was massively successful and had dev interaction, but they also killed off community aspects.
---
Adding in a cert process for cool skins would be fine if BHVR actually, ya know, keeps making the game.  Valve didn't update TF2 for months to years and it only hurt the game.
---
&gt;The counter is to kill the survivor before the gates are powered.
---
haha yes easy counter wink wink notch notch   
---
me bad killer who likes games that last more than 5-6 minutes, might as well go back to red rank survivor and run balanced adreneline
---
Awesome. I'd be down to play with you, whether for tips and pointers, or for competent company who wont disconnect

---
Exactly! Gens are popping left and right with the Wake Up exploit so gen protecting perks are more important than ever. This is all on top of the fact that Ghostface has very little power in terms of being able to apply pressure throughout the map and ensure survivors aren‚Äôt completing generators.
---
Then u miss ur decisive strike
---
To me it reads as the survivor got pissed and then somehow managed to escape so he decided to rub it in.  Which to me is toxic behavior regardless.
---
AhahahahajahajajahJkskxbsa jdjs.. Dude, it's stupid bad when we can tell it's you, again. Stop trying to piss on the killers. How bad at the game do you have to be to post this? ***Help, I can't play the game normally and I lost my senses of respect***.
---
I had this happen to me the other day. Except I was a survivor and everyone, including the killer, was 17 or less.
---
*Embeds face so deeply in palm, nose pokes out the other side*
---
The game is really good right now but I do genuinely wonder how long the devs can keep making new content. There's only so many killer ideas they can incorporate into the game right? And I wonder when we will reach that limit.  Obviously they have a roadmap for the next 12 months, but will they still be able to bring out a new killer every 3 months in 2 years time? Tbf the game has already lasted longer than I think most people thought it would and the playerbase hit a new peak recently I believe. There's definitely another year of good content for this game and likely more, so definitely worth putting time into if you're enjoying it. But it's anyone's guess when we'll reach the end of new content for this game.
---
I don't really care about that shit get the fuck out if your just gonna spew random shit that doesn't relate to the conversation.
---
Exactly. But remember, that‚Äôs kinda how the community-controlled TF2 started off, with the community making models for weapons and/or hats. It the evolved to the community making all of the cosmetics and maps, and then community updates in general having basically no input from Valve (remember Invasion?). Of course, I‚Äôm not saying this cosmetic contest will be the start of a road to BHVR doing nothing for the game- BHVR aren‚Äôt Valve.
---
I mean I run Bond for the heals but yeah. I just want to explain to the newer plays Self Care is trash and people need to stop relying on it so much.
---
Who‚Äôs the better killer? Like the game from riddik
---
Reminds me of a few matches back where I was rep 12 survivor against a rep 10 killer with rep 20 teammates
---
So, really, they all just killed 25% of a guy.
---
Hooray!
---
Yeah, I can recognize why people think that, coming from PC there's a lot of compromises you have to make, like with turning speed you got to change that, and the lower frame-rate can throw you off a little bit, so I can say it's harder than on PC, but she is by no means not the best killer still
---
At least you can pair those up with a Brand New Part for some utility. The skill check size add-ons for Med-Kits are completely useless.
---
Agreed with OP btw.: Survivor bloodwebs are clogged up with a bunch of stuff that is basically not gameplay-relevant (not to mention how many perks fall into a similar category), and some touch-ups would be nice. Flashlight add-ons should affect time-to-blind again, only that they should not be able to create insta-blinds. Maybe the beam accuracy add-ons should do that, as it makes sense that a more "concentrated" beam causes a quicker blind. Skill check size add-ons should at least tangibly increase the size of the great skill check zone. Key add-ons could be looked at to actually make people use them for things other than opening the hatch. The entire "luck" mechanic should be reworked to actually make luck offerings matter.

I've gone as far as to run your build, but with Thrilling Tremors instead of Nurse's. Nurse's is the better choice, but I'm not interested in tunnelling and tend to let Survivors heal.
---
When I read her bio she really did seem like she meant well.
---
I'd love for these changes to be implemented.

I genuinely don't understand the negativity here. He's one of the best I've seen play the game in terms of skill, he's not perfect at anything obviously, and he's got an overly competitive attitude, but he's not toxic by any stretch, and has always spoken fairly of the mechanics he discusses, points out the bad shit and doesn't sugarcoat it, discusses how to counter strategies, killers, etc. I'll agree with people, he does discuss balance almost constantly, but I always seen it as helping people understand the game. Most of the time it's because someone ASKED him to talk about it. I do personally feel he doesn't have fun anymore with the game, he's competitive, so streaming it constantly must be draining, since it's not balanced, but it hasn't turned him into a hateful ass or anything, so I dunno, I think some of you are weird and just want to be hateful yourselves.
---
I know most view it as a bit of a meme perk but I find shadowborn to be very nice on GF.
---
I love this I wish I could make the audio my alarm clock üò©
---
I wish i could give you gold, this is a perfect title.
---
just tell them to run Bond. They'll learn much more this way
---
The only games ive GoT plat in my PS4 its God of War.
---
Loved it so much that even finding the birds didnt bother me at all.
---
I forgot to mention that gen is 99%. You're right, there's no reason to camp when that gen isn't worked on.
---
getting altruism points for skill checks when self healing btw :) 
---
no other way to get survival points besides escaping or literally farming with a killer that has a state you can cleanse or get out of. (freddy, plague, doc, etc.)
---
Yeah i do pretty much the same thing.  Dunno why it would bother someone. Its more bloodpoints
---
That‚Äôs the funniest lol
---
When they flame you for running noed but you dominated so much you 4ked without even them getting all the gens done, so you basically played with 3 perks lol
---
Haha, the comment is enough :)
---
Still, two survivors going for the unhook is perfectly functional, and they could definitely do it.
---
&gt; Killer queue time are long **'cause playing solo survivor is really "exhausting" and frustrating. So a big part of the playerbase just stick to killer.**
---
This couldn't be any more incorrect.
---
Built in no mither and bbq? Naw
---
most importantly,fucking vaults too
---
I have no problems finding matches, can‚Äôt say the same for your team of toxic exploiters.
---
Probably because his prestige looks shit. Only the head is decent.
---
I forgot Myers was in this game...
---
All I face is Ghostface... every game for 6 days
---
ikr , like screw me for running a perk that they can counter but dont want to counter lol
---
I'll start screaming again when the entity teleports my real life ass to the fog
---
This dude lucky AF for being so incredibly accurate at his Dwight cosplay that people literally on here wishing they was his locker so he could go inside them that's fuckin great
---
it's be fine though after a while we may lose the aspect of lore or as close to lore inspired to just having cool stuff at all times.  
---
grantedbhvr has been doing this  alot with survivors so maybe that'd be fine
---
So it is from 1.14 to 1 sec, not from 1,4 sec, it‚Äôs barely noticeable. However, it now doesn‚Äôt affect stuns by DS for examples. It‚Äôs basically a lil nerf for me, but it seems fair, now that DS is more fair as well.
---
Looks totally legit
---
Good job man! I have a question, how long did it take u to get skilled huntress?
---
it is? I never seen that got a link
---
Hey one of these days you'll get a man swf all rank one when your rank 12. Good thing I'm not actually rank 12 and just haven't played for a while wiped the foor with those fools
---
They didn‚Äôt even got the chance to counter it, lol it never activated. And now that cleansing dull totem gives lightbringer points as well, they have no excuse
---
It happens and it‚Äôs BhVR‚Äôs a fault, they should show people‚Äôs rank above there name so if you do get a group like this you can save them the horror‚Äôs of things to come...
---
lul even when I made actual reports through the forum a couple times with video evidence I was emailed to say that they couldn't do anything without an in-game report
---
Hearing him isnt really a downside, you can hear a lot of killers, and he doesnt need to get that close to you , so its not always that you will hear him
---
got chainsawed while trying to escape and it launched me on top of the locker. Unable to move or interacted with.
---
Used it once to confirm "It's broken" VS "just a visual bug", and it felt dirty.
---
I felt like an asshole. The unhook was super fast, and the healing with botany was insane. I rushed a Gen too.
---
I think thats supposed to happen, if their close enough to the window you can hit them from the other side. If they run for 2 seconds and you still hit them thats fucking bullshit tho.
---
Tru has said before he knows Reddit isn‚Äôt the biggest fan of him so he usually just ignores what they say about him. Which is definitely for the best when you read these comments giving shit to a guy who gives out his opinions frequently while they‚Äôre on a site that focuses on discussion...
---
As much as I loved getting dopey looking close ups of my Survivor when working on a Gen, I much prefer the potential silliness that comes from nodding my head at the other people on the Gen with me. Plus it looks funny when being healed too.

I mean, I guess a true Billiam wouldn't even be playing Dead By Daylight?  He'd just be getting sacrifices for the entity and enjoying his time murdering people
---
I don‚Äôt know if his pick up block gen perk might be better than pop goes the weasel.

ikr
---
Wake up exploit? Enlighten me please
---
thats very true
---
Wake up exploit? Explaination please?

But now you have nothing to do :(
---
*cries in matchmaking with the mars rover as host*
---
free huh that is cool. honestly dbd should become free to play by now since there is so many dlcs and they are making battle passes now it feels like a free to play lol
---
Honestly, I've been running surveillance on every single killer lately..and I'm willing to argue that it's at least A tier
---
A true killer wouldn't even run perks smh
---
Wraith's little brother's turn on the Xbox
---
I mean you don't need noed on a top tier killer lol
---
Lmao people use the term "face camping" but back then you could literally stand infront of a hooked survivor, and STARE them in the face, due to only being able to unhook from the front, it was just a horrible way to die and get kills
---
How stupid do you have to be to click in that link?
---
So I read that they changed the audio settings to be a little quieter but with my headset (Logitech g430) everything sounds super muffled and in some cases I can't even hear killer ques such as Myers tier up or nurse blink. Is that common at the moment or should I post a ticket to the devs?
---
Oh that was One Sonovabich! About 3 days. Here's how i did it: 
---
Addons: Iridescent Heads (Toxic), Babushka Napkins
---
Perks, Lightborn(for better vision) and M&amp;A for reduced TR
---
Offering: Any open air map, preferably, Mcmillan Estate or Coldwind Farms (Haddonfield, Game and lerry's will make it near impossible)
---
Hook a survivor in an open space, preferably without using hatchets (so they do not know u have instadowns) and walk away for 8 seconds. Throw a practice hatchet to make sure you hit rescuer (hitting Hooked person immediately after rescue sometimes doesnt count).
---
Now we wait.
---
And then we rinse n repeat.
---
Good Luck!
---
Anyone remember "the bus"? xD it was possible to get a hit if you mindplayed extreeeemly well
---
Also remember when everyone had iron grab because there were 0 hooks left after 3 mins? Or that literally everyone ran spies from the shadows? 
---
No SwF... you had to manually find lobbies at the same time and retry atleast 30 times xD
---
Also fAiLeD tO fiND A mAtCh
---
downvoted for saying the truth
---
Hehe boi
---
He still fuckable
---
obviously, you dont see jack the ripper going around with noed and iron grasp! he wont even bring a mori!
---
*Killer being toxic and gets karma'd for it when Survivor gets a lucky break.
---
MrSillyBilly: it's the survivors that are the problem.
---
Literally everyone else: *thinking*
---
Imagine clicking on that LUL
---
Believe it or not that was out of range, it dosnt matter where the killer it is when they get stunned, it matters where you jump out of the locker. What you did was jump out a little to early but since she continued to go to the locker it seems like it should have worked
---
*Gasp!* Existential Crisis Intensifies!
---
Ehh, I guess I will take selfies with my murdered victims till I get bored of that xD
---
we need some poeple
---
thanks man! will do
---
Actually really well made for how simple the fit is
---
Hope you have the same mindset when it comes to teabagging and everything else killers complain about survivors.
---
Nurse‚Äôs Calling for Franklin‚Äôs Demise
---
On Hag? Why
---
That‚Äôs a good one aswell... helps the survivors with gens ... would be awkward when there‚Äôs 4 people on one gen though
---
idk man, reddit often gives me notifications for trending stuff on subs im not even in
---
This is why free to play weekends suck. Without competent matchmaking, new players are just gonna be turned off by the game.
---
Why not?
---
It seems like fate
---
 Can‚Äôt he put on a hat? lol
---
I wanted a buff for Quentin's perks but not like this
---
Oh don't worry, I am.
---
man the ‚ÄúKinky Leather sounds‚Äù really got me
---
really don't understand why they don't just disable it, no one used it before so it's extremely obvious people only use it to exploit
---
Wow is he running it? Just when I thought my opinion of him couldn't get lower.
---
My build that works that I love is Ruin, Haunted grounds, monitor and abuse, BBQ
---
They really just need a system to remove perks and items temporary, I didn't know about Wake up bug and I swf with my friends who also bring wake up. If players get banned for bringing a perk, that's bullcrap.
---
The extra bloodpoints from BBQ is dope but I meant for detecting survivors
---
I have 27 stacked up by reaching lvl 50 and each lvl after 50 has at least one but most the time 2, there are a ton for me
---
holy fuck -225 karma for being right
---
Brand new part is garbage tho
---
Shhhh...its okay, its okay
---
*Holds back tears*
---
There's a bigger window for the windstorm-like lunge.
---
Every game as killer in a nut shell
---
Takes me about 5m to get a lobby created as killer. Very annoying to wait for
---
Not really. There's no in-game warning so I doubt survivors will even be punished for this. At most they'll do 1-day bans like they did for Legion blades which is pretty pathetic honestly. Just hotfixing or disabling this perk would be so much easier and less infuriating for the playerbase..
---
You know you can just close the in game chat window, right? Thereby completely avoiding all that toxicity?
---
The other issue is that Valve's structure means no managers which means no big projects or updates get done, all the smaller ones that handle say DOTA 2 actually get shit done because they have managers.
---
BHVR is not likely to repeate TF2.
---
Nice! I'm currently one achievement away from being able to 100% this game and that's the 300 stalks with Myers achievement, It's very slow and boring to get but it's gonna be so worth it once I finish it!
---
Gg EZ
---
Not to mention the Valve Index- apparently, Valve have had an ‚Äòall hands on deck‚Äô approach to it, pooling almost all of its employees onto it at one point or another in the past year or two. This has slowed down TF2 content immensely (remember, it was a small team working on it already).

---
You'd still expect it to be more then 10 though
---
Nonsense. Have you played red ranks without ruin? Have you played against SWFs who weren't your friends? There's no way you could conclude this game is balanced.
---
Daddy Dwight???
---
"dId yOu HaVe FuN?
---
Oh no fucking wonder every survivor is using it in purple ranks. This makes me not even want to play killer right now.
---
All these new(er than me) players are also feeding Myers in my games and I‚Äôm not a fan
---
I made mine using photopea, basically free photoshop. it took an hour.
---
Otherwise i think someone made a custom perk template but i don't know where you'll find it other than searching the reddit.
---
I main Quentin, I dont have wake up equipped, but I got tunneled and morid because I'm playing Quentin and there was a small chance of me abusing a system. Try not to go on another Inquisition.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure. I was only running hoth and devour Hope &amp; this guy got upset I closed the hatch in his face .
---
Anyone next to a window can get smacked.  Anyone passing through a window can get smacked.  Basically don't be near the window if you don't want to get smacked.
---
Nice job man! Upvoted
---
Tbf. I havent played in ages.
---
So not saying my build even works now. Freddy was the last killer when I stopped. My friends stopped so I ended up as well.
---
I wasnt good at looping. So I stuck to gens and rescuing.
---
That was prob me XD
---
Well that's fucked but honestly they should either fix it or nerf it to 5% but leave it helping with everything because I sorta wish there was a perk that lightly increased the speed of everything (spine chill already does that but only when the killer is looking at you)
---
Nah there‚Äôs been a couple bans issued that I know of. Couple friends and friends of friends, two week ban.

---
Getting hit and downed by and invisible knife would be fucking hilarious
---
No you aren‚Äôt
---
This outfit could work for just about any killer would be even cooler on the wraith with him going invisible
---
The problem is he‚Äôs just a Miserable shot now. Watch his YouTube videos from 2 years ago and he has fun playing games and properly interacted with the stream. Now he just to competitive and moans about balance all the time and forgets to have fun.
---
I swear I NEVER get the map I want when I play a map offering as Killer and a survivor uses a map offering. Extremely frustrating and I really wish my Doctor's jigsaw pieces would at least not be used up if we don't get THE GAME.
---
This is obviously before the endgame mechanic. You cant pull them out but you can push them out by kicking the hatch as they jump in.
---
-_-
---
Also notice how i said "used to"
---
Make WGLF stacks easier to get and make the perk fucking do something. Protection hits are super inconsistent, maybe fix that before anything else. As for giving the perk an ability, maybe merge it with borrowed time and give Bill a different perk.
---
But vacum pallets are ok?
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
the few dozens community servers that i have been playing at since more than 4 years ago are still 32\32 players almost all the time so that's all that matters to me.
---
They gave way too much love for pig tbh
---
When I miss DS I want to die irl. It feels that bad.
---
It doesn't waste time in practice, it's just more risky to use now since you need to be stationary longer. Big difference between those two.
---
16 servers on my favorites category not going below 20\32 says otherwise, it depends on how you view the situation
---
All I want for Christmas.
---
It's been ghost face for me. Almost every time
---
I‚Äôm just keeping track of everyone I see running it and then acting like it‚Äôs fair even when they‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs broken 
---
I mean, I‚Äôve gotta do something with this stack of ivory mori‚Äôs I‚Äôve got
---
Nice job! I grinded away and got the platinum on ps4 about a month ago, however I'm missing a couple dlc like the skilled huntress and it's a shame cause I cant be bothered to do that one so I've just settled at the platinum instead of 100% lol. Super impressive you got the full 100% man!
---
Some say the P3 Claudette is still out there today, somehow hiding from the Entity itself...
---
But it‚Äôs still pretty dumb to think that community servers are where most TF2 players reside. Competitive is fucked, but Casual is thriving.
---
Then don't get caught.
---
I always get a "Zzzzzzzzzz" in the chat, when I play Hag. 
---
Why? It's nonstop action, and usually a short game.
---
I don't know, I think the whole concept of the perk is still really dumb regardless and even with the Broken for the rest of the trial, I feel like it would still be really obnoxious if all 4 survivors were running it.
---
If she (claudette) didn‚Äôt hide around the hatch the entire game I wouldn‚Äôt have had to super lock down the gens ... her last team mate playing as Tapp was atleast giving me a chase
---
Vacuum pallets haven‚Äôt existed for a long time?
---
Also it‚Äôs a joke.
---
Pls nerf
---
Yes i am lol
---
I still get away with some some times. Either that or it's the killers connection.
---
Barbecue and Chili is kinda buggy, got 4 kills in quite a few games but never had 4 stacks. Its always stuck at 3 Stacks. 
---
Playing as legion,if it helps
---
Kinda looks like Ghostface is up in them guts
---
That only works after the exit gates have been powered though, right?
---
If only boil over increased wiggle speed. Like it should...
---
Yeah, I agree that if multiple people put in map offerings and they don't get used you should keep them, but I personally rarely actually use offerings besides in a group setting like this as a joke. I understand where you're coming from though!
---
Don't know why this keeps happening, when the game has over 31k people playing right now. I hope for regional servers...
---
Weird and I‚Äôm jealous. For me it feels like killers got vacuum hits through thrown down pallets.
---
Because it's annoying and most people would prefer to get to the next game? It's pretty simple to see why it would bother someone.
---
Ah, true. Sorry, I somehow thought she actually killed him because the entity granted her powers, let her kill him and then trasnported her to the realm. Idk why I thought that
---
Oh well. It is what is. Happy runs my friend
---
Dem cakes
---
i know you know, you said it
---
Just use NOED don't listen to them
---
If you use this skin, they are justified. i love it
---
Buuuutt free blood points :/  And a free escape!  thats like a free 7k+
---
they broke the sound also, i mean iron will does nothing right now, and who knows how many perks are broken atm.
---
I agree in general EGC is lopsided in killers favor but I suppose it is still better balanced than the old system of the ridiculous hatch standoff.  Despite this like you said if the doors are far apart it is still possible to escape. 
---
Her old traps combined with the hatch close would have given them zero chance every game.  This was a needed change to prevent Pig players from having an unfair advantage egc. And it really isn't that impactful a nerf.  If you trap them prior to egc they still function as they always did which seems like a fair trade off.
---
It's crazy that people thought it was ever game changing. Sure, it was easy to get stacks for, but it only added about a max of 30 seconds to the match and only made a real difference if it didn't trigger until endgame.
---
I would have them all if it wasn't for the bugged huntress crap
---
Yeah, let's compare an in-game perk to intentional BM. 
---
Galaxy brain shit.
---
I agree, that achievement was an absolute bitch to get due to how much of an asshole everyone is once they figure out what you‚Äôre trying to do (on top of just being really hard to get because of how loooooooooooong you have to stalk for)...
---
^^but this meme is still funny.
---
They can see what the average perks everyone is running at any given rank, why wouldnt they be able to see what users are using a specific perk
---
After they fix the wake up bug, they really should buff it, it's a really terrible perk
---
he admits ash is a major doofus lol
---
oh yah that shit was bugged for me too, luckily with end game collapse update it got fixed. Drop a complaint on BHVR's forum site,. I did too.
---
Literally every other game is Ghost Face for me.
---
thanks a lot! &lt;3
---
PSA: If you get stuck in a lobby that never gets a 4th Survivor, it might very possibly be a common bug. If you want the details google it yourself, idk how exactly this shit works, but basically a Survivor that left earlier is still being "remembered" by the lobby so their spot will never again be taken up, making the lobby unable to ever start a match bc the 4th slot will always appear open. Just exit.
---
P2 but ok
---
Characters that aren't licensed (killers from movies) can't be bought through gameplay. The originals however, can be purchased with iridescent shards which you get from leveling up.
---
Killer: Gets four man without noed or ruin
---
Survivors: bAbY kIlLeR rEeE.
---
thanks man! yeah skilled huntress wont be easier with controller. I actually replied how to do it to somebody else in this thread. I hope that helps you too. Good Luck!
---
Killers have been op for ages now. Anyone who says different is just full of shit
---
I dont think the games are even comparable.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I mean F13 is dead so I don't think they're ones to talk
---
Yes, scientists call them ‚Äúarms‚Äù and it‚Äôs theorized that they‚Äôre made for reaching.
---
It upsets me sometimes as well, though not for the same reason. I'll always try to message people gg or sorry but then their messages are blocked
---
oh yah I have some builds planned too. Maybe I will share them here.
---
Are you dumb or are you dumb?
---
Thanks haha. I m a killer main too!
---
I always have NOED just Incase but like dude survivor mains get so mad if you rub it even if you don‚Äôt use it
---
Mimes are just Goth Clowns
---
Here is a list: [Image](https://i.imgur.com/V3Xmux8.jpg)
---
All original characters can be bought with play time. 
---
There are 2 characters missing in this image, one survivor (Ash Williams) and one killer (Ghost Face). They are both licensed.
---
300?? I don't remember it being so many on steam. Which Platform you are on? Good Luck anyways. Its a grind but You will make it!
---
This dude needs to put dbd down and pickup a new game for a bit. He is washed up.
---
Protection hits aren't a real thing that actually happens in normal games, sorry
---
The difference is that Adrenaline only does anything if a survivor is about to win anyway. Noed only does something when the killer is about to lose.
---
How does NOED affect adrenaline?
---
No, I have to stay faithful to the movie
---
Now ur gonna be really bored üòÇ
---
No not at all, not even on Bruce mains.
---
Yeah, I haven't heard anything on it but also haven't been checking the forums much. They should really post stuff like this on their official twitter or in-game news even so people don't miss it. Especially if they're gonna start handing out bans.
---
In theory, it *should* be about 140 milliseconds faster, but it does indeed if anything feel 140ms slower now. Enduring went from increasing the pallet stun recovery speed by 75% (which is equal to dividing by 1.75), to flat halving the pallet stun recovery time (which is dividing by 2). I would not be surprised if there's something they are overlooking however, maybe even something about this new stun VFX somehow interferring with the interaction duration. That stun VFX will fortunately be removed again at some point, but yeah, I hope they will look into Enduring too.
---
If you need a certain amount of hooks for noed to activate they'd need to buff it
---
Julie &amp; Susie really just helped finish a kill bc they were under peer pressure though. Probably only do it in the Entity's realms because the Entity strengthens/influences them.
---
Too busy warming up the killer nerf hammer
---
I‚Äôm guessing this is on PC? I wish I saw that many Huntresses on PS4 since she‚Äôs fun, but I guess tough for most people to play on console.
---
And I know who is abusing DBD.  The Devs.
---
Holy crap on the cracker! Man I'd have given up on that too. I cant play any killer with controller. Mad Props to you for playing huntress with that.
---
100! That's Madness!
---
Ah gotcha
---
Actually you can hook someone with d strike if they're downed directly under a hook and you spam the hook button while picking them up

I can't even create a lobby, I'm stuck in "Searching for match" in killer...
---
No i mean it requires 100 downs on the PS4. It was changed ages ago on other platforms
---
Really? I noticed her pants got lighter.
---
Try copy closely from a picture then eventually you'll get it down
---
I love arguing about balance tbh, it's fun, but I guess some people tire of it.
---
Thanks for the heads up but my name isn‚Äôt a secret it‚Äôs in my Xbox profile so I figured it didn‚Äôt really matter.
---
oink!!
---
Thanatophobia and black incense, destroys them every time
---
Spirit with Prayer Beads my friend. You do not have to do achievement with a specific killer.
---
Not right now it isn't lmao
---
Iron Will definitely works, run it as Survivor and have played against it as Killer.
---
sometimes  when you hook a survivor these "ghosts" appear in T-Pose where they spawned at the beggining of the trial
---
FYI don't use a VPN for gaming as it will raise your ping an appreciable amount.
---
It would be the strongest killer in tye game by far
---
Matchmaking is horrible right now. My friend and I are red ranks and we keep getting matched with green rank killers and teammates.
---
Wake up is currently affecting all action speed that has a bar (healing, generators etc)
---
Just because I made his team DC and teabagged him with ghost face till the endgame killed him he‚Äôs gonna try and ban me üòÇ
---
Self-Care doesn‚Äôt show up as yellow since it‚Äôs still slower than normal speed, and I thought for the longest time someone was using Prove Thyself when I was repairing Gens. Didn‚Äôt connect 2 and 2 together until just now
---
well maybe i'm just playing against potatoes.
---
God you are dense
---
Hail to the king, baby!
---
Nice. All I have left is 
---
- unhook yourself 50 times ( 26/50 fml )
---
- take 250 hits near a hook ( 5 left )
---
- heal 50 ppl while you‚Äôre injured
---
- catch 100 people in traps ( I never knew you had to PICK THEM UP FROM IT )
---
And now with Ghostface I just need the 
---
- down 50 stalked people
---
- grab 25 people off a gen 
---
The unhook achievement is the WORST BTW
---
Yes, I don't believe in jigsaws dumbass philosophy, If you put someone in a murder puzzle room and they die it's murder
---
Oh okay yeah that shit is madness. 100 instadowns from 24m or more distance, that too, with a controller is absolute madness. FeelsBad man!
---
This is the best meme I have seen on this sub reddit. Good job.
---
So I see that they're hooked from an Entity spider arm thing with some white cloth holding them up. Are they getting a wedgie or is there some other explanation that I'm missing?
---
&gt;Thanatophobia destroys them every time
---
He doesn't know
---
pepeLaugh
---
If you are on PC you can do it. I actually wrote instructions in a reply to someone else in this thread. Look for it.
---
Everyone on this game is constantly trying to get each other banned and its ridiculous hope this man knows I can‚Äôt get banned for doing my job üòÇ
---
I didn‚Äôt know
---
It‚Äôs REALLY bad, because if you‚Äôre also using Resilience, you can Vault windows/Pallets/Heal/Repair/Mend at a huge +24% extra speed.

Exhaustion prevents adrenaline and sprint burst from triggering in the same chase.

---
Why would they use ‚Äúhigh‚Äù ghost face? The regular Ghost Face costume is already one of the most popular Halloween costumes every year.
---
Steam. It's always been 300. It's probably easier to do when you just casually play him and don't worry about a stat for an achievement but I'm not a myers player so I have to do it the painful way, but I figure they started toning down the requirements for these types of achievements as they released more chapters. Currently on 267/300 though so i'm super close!
---
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with this community‚Äù 
---
As you explain in your own comment that ‚ÄúI made his team DC then tbagged him until EGC (which is 4 minutes) killed him.‚Äù

hmmm

Yes because it is ugly as fuck

Didn't 2010 freddy start killing his entire kindergarten class or whatever? Everyone in the group photo? That was a lot more than 4
---
There does need to be more downside to denying the killer her power. Honestly I dont have trouble killing people that are all one hit, but it's still very annoying getting denied deviousness points and less brutality points.
---
I usually don't agree with him but that one recent video where he played as Ghostface and just suffered the entire time was something I could feel deep down in my heart.
---
Last week once again I had a game with invisible pallets.  This time they had no sounds when thrown or broke.  On xbox btw.
---
Face camping and tunneling are toxic as hell but they are both strats so they won‚Äôt ever be removed
---
I don't think I've seen an alarm clock in the past 7 years lol, unless you meant the one built into most phones?
---
Not if it was 2 nurses on pc.
---
He just wants an achivement dammit.
---
This reminds me of the soldier in tf2 being able to hit people behind him lmao, new meta for killers? Just hit survivors behind you?
---
Yeesh. That's pretty dire. Glad to see you can hit things behind you. I guess it's at least a good thing that it seems to be immediately behind, so this shouldn't come up too often.
---
why not ebony?
---
Are you playing the game with 5.1 or 7.1 audio by chance?
---
Probably he said he was doing YouTube
---
Because the joke is that your gonna mori this one person
---
Now it really will be repetitive!
---
This will last all of about 2 minutes.
---
It‚Äôs just fact people let end game kill other people all the time it‚Äôs normal he‚Äôs just mad his team DC‚Äôd
---
You aren't the only one, it's creepy as fuck
---
When you go ham, go full ham
---
Skills so low he can reach Rank 1 with every killer with no perks and Rank 1 Survivor with No fucking Mither.
---
True enough
---
*Camera zooms on my poker face till the tight closeup of eyes* AAAAGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
---
Its insane how many free hits I get when survivors t-bag on the other side of the window. It appears not many realize that you can hit about a meter through the window.
---
????
---
Impending doom intensifies
---
from my personal experience, i didn't even know that people still bother with casual, I don't even play TF2 for the fps game anymore, I only play game modes like slender, death run and vs saxton hale..
---
Maybe just make Surviviors 1st person instead of survivor and killer have their camera swapped
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3trx6/hex\_bone\_warden/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3trx6/hex_bone_warden/) Same thing happened to my cousin earlier.
---
Except all 4 people need to be hurt. and it uses a perk slot.
---
yeah probably not
---
Ah, okay! Happy to at at least help
---
Hahahahaha holy shit I love these, would make pig better.
---
you just don‚Äôt seem to get it
---
I use it on Freddy, survivors keep dying right after the match starts
---
It's the free weekend, you gotta do what you gotta do...
---
It is toxic, though. Regardless of whether the survivor had instigated with toxicity, the killer responded with toxicity as well. There is no reason to repeatedly drop someone inside the gates like that except to delay the timer and be an asshole about winning.
---
Wait 131 there‚Äôs 140 on Xbox
---
Oh so they got themself kill at egc i would be mad if my team dc'd but i wouldn't if we were killing eachother because it was our fault in the first place
---
He said used to
---
I personally think ghostface is the most fun killer I have played so far
---
Honestly I stopped using enduring, I've discovered that, you can still disrespect pallets even without enduring.
---

---
I like how No0b3 used to say "Bamboozled" before the Clown release, but I don't hear him saying it now
---
They are already punished
---
what are you talking about ? you can't miss a normal skillcheck
---
yes, and the second part of this add-on makes it even more crazy. running two of these add-ons lets you do a fast pig-lunge around loops
---
I have no clue how that wasn't in stun range, BUT you got in the locker too late to avoid BBQ.
---
This is after completing the generator right? Not just gen tapping it?
---
Wow, that's bad.
---
but you don't always get to down them while in shroud
---
They only have rights for the mask.
---
I'm a sad sad Reddit user, I know
---
I'd love an entity-touched "hacker" killer that had powers that looked like bugs/corruption. I know there's exactly 0% chance they'll ever do it though, since they have enough trouble detecting real, obvious bugs without confusing the issue with fake ones.
---
Keep us posted if she does decide to sell these eventually, I'd really like to have the spirit chibi keychain
---
&gt;Rancor is a super fun perk 
---
LOL
---
Just Mettle of Man was, Rancor is a BS perk that needs to be reworked. Being exposed and "moriable" **without any counter** whatsoever is nonsense. If your team is in need of assistance to escape you can't help them because 1 hit and you are dead. Can't be saved with a flashlight, pallet, nothing.
---
Before Ghost Face I was 2 away from 100 percent on PS4. Skilled Huntress is one I know Ill never get. Just too much time and frustration to do it 100 times.
---
The one I cant seem to get is Wounded Healer. Ive been at it for a week and it just wont pop. Im using No Mither, which is stated should work, empathy and botany. At first i was just counting in my head. After 4 days i was like somethings not right here so i started marking down each FULL heal and im already up to 30 in 2 days. 
---
So im not sure whats going on but i see on PSN trophies that people are getting the trophy so ill keep at it.
---

Some say he's more than human but less than a god.
---
still better than these people that been askin for chucky
---
I leave ashes be, but if everyone plays Ash then well... I would just have to sit and let them Gen rush and T-bag me
---
I had a similar encounter once, I had been slugged and left because there was another person who was right there. But I knew where hatch was, didn‚Äôt have hope of getting there because it was on the exact opposite side of the map. Somehow I made it all the way there right when my last team member had been killed but was continuously picked up and brought over to the hook that was close and dropped to crawl back to hatch. Honestly I didn‚Äôt care about being hooked or escaping. After slugging across the entire map I just wanted the game to be done.
---
Now THAT would be a worthy Ultra Rare add-on. It wouldn‚Äôt do too much in short loops but in bigger loops mixed with stealth and crouching, you‚Äôd have a much bigger advantage.
---
Why's that?
---
Why would it be worth it?  Just curious.
---
Doc was originally meant to be Asian, but changed to American. Wraith was always African.
---
They didn't "want" it, since the leaked version of him used lines from the Scream movies in his perks. They just couldn't acquire the license for him.
---
I only really ever used it when MoM was big, and I use it mostly for the wall hacks that work while phasing on spirit, but it's also extremely situational, and as I said rarely gets off as the survivor just hides and then leaves.
---
Cheating is cheating. The vault speed is far more impactful. It's a perk that was almost never seen before the bug, but now people want to break the rules .
---
It's perhaps bugged. Skilled Huntress was bugged for me for a long while and got fixed only after GF update.
---
May be talk to devs? No Mither and Empathy was my combo for wounded healer as well.
---
Nice elaborate bait
---
I was constantly jumping when watching this :D
---
If you turn your eyeballs upward by about 10 degrees, you'll see that Nurse is in the 50's kill count while Pig is still in single digits.
---
Also this part is just personal preference but original killers &gt; licensed killers
---
This is hilarious
---
"normal game as ghostface" when you're in a 3v1 which isn't possible anymore. nice KYF.
---
yeah, i once let a survivor in the hatch so he can escape and i got *merciless* killer
---
Thatd be 412% then

Amazing addon ideas, why the heck are ghostfaces addons so boring

I had a similar addon idea to yours to replace the outdoor security camera

"After marking a survivor, that survivors aura is revealed to you for the remainder of them being marked"

That way you can play as jumpscare ghostface

WTF did i just witness LOL this made me laugh so hard
---
Idk, the original is so great because it's basic that's the idea behind it. It's a one size fits all cheap costume store mask so anyone could have one.
---
Old Blowjobface.
---
Huh, TIL. That is pretty neat.
---
I finished so many books between lobbies, this game is a godsend for my education.
---
Absolutely the best post on this subreddit
---
You take it knowing it'll only work 33% of the time. Also take luck offering to boost that. It's good for a selfish build and has won me some games on its own.
---
Waitwaitwait there‚Äôs only 121, even more shocking, the only extras for you I can think of is bills achieves
---
You can stalk through the tiny gaps in the shack ? Note to self.
---
Rancor DOES work when you close the hatch...
---
How old is he out of interest ?
---
This happened to me as a survivor vs. Huntress.  I  was off doing gens and next thing I know all three of the other survivors are hooked in the basement. 
---
I was like wtf!?!?  The Huntress though did not take mercy on me.
---
Oh shit today is my birthday as well. Ok this is epic.
---
Yeah, but I am more concerned about how an emaciated teen (she was 17, right?) managed to do that. Why didn't the Entity just transport her into the realm, why was the Entity like "Oh yes, you can murder them before I use my inter-dimensional teleport skills on you"?
---
She would be instantly way more annoying. Its a huge risk to not heal against a 115 killer. Shes already not a bad killer
---
Thrilling tremors is garbage too, shitty bbq and chili with an unnecessary cooldown
---
Yes, I second this.
---
Any perks that aren't his
---
This is so true. I had to resort to that yesterday against a 4 man squad with Flashlights. Ebony all the way.
---
I always bring a Mori for the P3 claudets
---
"vibe of the game" alright you emersed dimwit. Maybe a light-hearted costume would make your life a little less sad, only a little though.
---
I really dont understand blocking messages just over a game but whatever, I also dont get why it bothers you that you cant message strangers
---
Not fun to play against tho, literally just played a match against him that everyone spawned together, the match lasted,no joke, around 2 minutes,
---
I respect that!
---
Is the character Ash also that age ?
---
This is amazing. Have a poor man's gold ü•á
---
I don't see it much different than NOED. While NOED can be countered by totems, Rancor only affects one player, and they even see the killer aura time a gen is completed. 
---
In terms of it being unfun for the obsession it happens at end-game. I can think of FAR more cancerous stuff like Dying Light or even worse, Dying Light + Remember Me + Black Box + Mori Freddy. or Iri head huntress.
---
Hell even tombstone piece Myers can be super shitty considering you'll have ZERO clue he's running it until he 99%'s his EW3 and then pops it into an insta-mori right behind the Dying Light obsession out of nowhere. 
---
90% of the time the killer flat out ignores you until the very end. (Which my One Punch Freddy build was all about when MoM was meta) Sure being Mori'd sucks but I'd honestly rather be Rancor'd than NOED'd and deathhooked/camped. 
---
In terms of "Rarely pulling it off" I do it all the time on my Hillbilly. Play as normal, get obsession and last player on deathhook, chase obsession for last gen and Mori. I don't get why we have to go out of our way to let the last gen be powered when we could just save the obsession for last and end the trial with a Mori opposed to simply deathhooking the obsession. 
---
I'd be willing to maybe drop the exposed but keep the Mori effect if hatch is shut. I pretty much only run that perk over bitter murmur not because it gives slightly better tracking (not auras, but you see everyone on the map) but just for the Mori.
---
LOL @ not letting a Tombstone Meyers Mori means you're a dick. This subreddit is infested with Only-Killers it's hilarious.
---
I believe Ash is 56.
---
Or, like, maybe people just don't want to get Moried?
---
Please stop using doge memes. I dont think this is even meant to be ironic, it‚Äôs just painfully unfunny.
---
Lol nope i can down survs quick but whats the matter when the progress on 3 gens can be on 60% cause i had to find them down them and hook them. The perk guarantees you the win and is powerful because gens are so easely done. But whatevs half this reddit is to dumb to understand uptimal survivor play anyway so what use is there lol
---
Hey OP, can you send me a link to this image without any text on it, even without the original "Ghost Face" one? For scientific purposes.
---
How is no more games useless? You get a free hit if a survivor abuses an infinite.
---
A new killer came out. 
---
Youre reasoning makes no sense
---
Jeez ok
---
So he‚Äôs the second oldest behind Bill ?
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not like a lot of killer mechanics are broken too, it would be unreasonable to say that something like sounds and scratch marks are messed up currently.. oh wait.
---
But for real, regeneration pallets is a terrible idea. It‚Äôs equivalent to the people who say that killers should be able to break pallets not dropped yet. So if someone solo queues and gets into a game with a 3-man swf, would they regen? How quickly? Again; what‚Äôs stopping them from just dropping every pallet instantly, heading to another, dropping that one instantly, then heading to the one before as it regenerated? 
---
This might end pallet looping (which isn‚Äôt even that big of a problem anyway) but it will make it so that people only play 5-blink nurse with super op perks and addons only for a fair chance at getting a 4k;
---
They disables my fucking Moon offerings. They can damn well disable a broken perk.
---
So hooker Jane?
---
What happened with legions blades?
---
Yup, elderly hardasses.
---
This made me chuckle, had a game like this around when the pig came out, it was a P3 Myers and he had the Judith Tombstone and Tuft of Hair (Infinite T3) and he killed everyone and I was in a locker in the gas station in the Azarov Resting Place I believe and I waited a bit before I got out because I was terrified and he came to the inside where the gen and the truck is and opened one of the lockers next to me and I thought he was gonna open mine and so I jumped out to run to the pallet but noticed he wasn't checking anymore and was leaving and he turned to try and get me but I jumped in my locker again revealing myself. It was the longest game of time, one waiting for the other to make a move. Him doing what was in the video too albeit being a cool dude and sending me a voice message saying how he would do the same and laughing. I replied with haha you got me and let him kill me. We said our goodbyes and I hope to meet him again. These moments and the good side of the community are what make me stay in the game, of course the chases as well. This meme is just so good.
---
What in the god damn
---
lol that's why I haven't played killer for 4 days
---
Do you have it now? Cause that might be a full on issue down the road
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will
---
‚ÄúCome get some.‚Äù -Ash
---
Cheating isn't defined by what's annoying. Intentionally bringing a perk that lets you finish gens in like 10 seconds, is cheating and is still very annoying
---
What the infinite mending did was basically render survivors useless. The Wake Up bug renders the killer useless. The game could be ended in less than a minute and there's nothing the killer can do about it. People are breaking the game's rules and that is definitely cheating, and they should be banned for it
---
You die either way though, might as well give him his achievement.
---
The killer will always win a hatch standoff when it's about to open now
---
FULL IMMERSION
---
Rip your Karma
---
I feel like there's no favoritism, it's more "We have to make survivor enjoyable since it's a 4 v 1 and we need 4 times the amount of survivors for our game to function properly." They just tend to mix that up with misbalancing.
---
and sabo every hook on the map forcing the killer to run basement builds
---
Just derank and wait for a free weekend (like this weekend). That achieve was laughably easy to get when I did it on baby rank 20 &gt;3hour survivors.
---
What now?
---
Bruce is the best
---
Congrats! I‚Äôm currently working on it myself, but I still need to get the 3 ranking cheevos for Killer side, as well as Adept Billy, Nurse, Myers, and Huntress as well as blink and grab as Nurse. Still so far to go...
---
Probably because it actually relates to the character and would be an interesting addition to the game. Also why not?
---
It's a noob3 meme
---
Thanks &lt;3. All the best!
---
Devs listen to the whiny rank 29s and ignore the rank 1s
---
I got GF and just thought gens were popping quickly because of his lack of map pressure, switched back to Spirit and it still feels like gens are popping like crazy. I‚Äôve had to completely change my build to a gen-stomping one but it doesn‚Äôt matter since I‚Äôm only getting about one match every 30 minutes as killer lol. 
---
3.0.0 best patch
---
I love it but I wish they used the og pennywise
---
Couldn‚Äôt he just pull you out, drop you, and then Mori like normal?
---
sabo then  slug meta, good old times
---
And this is..... Myers.................................review!
---
Again, I already explained now they're literally the same thing. The Wake Up bug literally is game breaking because you can use it to completely ignore the killer. I take it you haven't played against a SWF using this exploit, because if you had you'd probably think differently
---
Ty
---
His perks aren't maxed it cant be kyf chief
---
 I haven't seen anyone using it on PS4 so far, which makes me glad.
---
That‚Äôs the infinite mending legion bug, I‚Äôve saw it on YouTube but out of my 300 hours I‚Äôve never encountered it before. In fact I see very very little legions on Xbox.
---
In one of the Texas Chainsaw Massacres, Leatherface hung that dude on a hook. I believe that's where they got it. As far as being realistic, nothing about any part of the sacrifice to The Entity is realistic. It's weird to nitpick that one part.
---
What
---
Check whether you still have the purchase in your purchase history. You can send that to Steam Support and get them reinstated.
---
Exactly. But then you can only hook them or let em bleed out. As someone who‚Äôs spent ages trying to get the Myers tombstone achievement, survivors who do shit like this is obnoxious. I‚Äôm not asking for free kills but if you‚Äôre the last survivor, the hatch is closed, and you‚Äôre in a chase with me, just let me have my achievement. Too many hours have already been wasted.
---

To whoever made this
---
Or maybe, as a survivor I'm trying not to die? Omg imagine that lol roflmao xd
---
No it isnt dude. Legion has addons right now that make everything the survivors do 15% slower, it's a bug that directly counters the Wake Up issue. Both are in the game at this exact moment, multiple streamers and others have mentioned Legion being bugged, it's not a secret at all
---
Yes yes this is a joke but i still feel like i need to defend bhvr,  they‚Äôre doing everything they can as fast as they can don‚Äôt worry cause everythings gonna be alright
---
Nice to see some positivity in here for once. Thanks for your post
---
It truly amazes me how much stuff Behavior manages to break with every one of their patches
---
What was the legion double blades? I started playing around 2 weeks ago so I'm out of the loop on this
---
Nea is the true killer confirmed
---
I‚Äôm currently having same issue and keep getting the ‚Äúsession closed due to an error‚Äù messages when trying to create a killer lobby. First time this has happened to me and I‚Äôve had the game for about 6ish months.
---
I want an endgame chat on xbox. Having to send messages is annoying.
---
I was playing a match with ghost face with all 3 of his perks but when I killed all the survivors it didn't give me the achievement
---
Yeah but the entity hates me and won‚Äôt give me bbq
---
Sheriff: "We didn't find any Claudette in the corn field." 
---
Me: "Then she's still out there."
---
DAMN BOI
---
Glad you got friends this game is full of people with autism you're more than likely to find likeminded people
---
Huh
---
Your statement that the EGC is not killer sided is absurd.  Ignore the bm timer for survivors to leave, that isn't the aspect of EGC I'm referring to.  It's the new hatch mechanic that is incredibly killer sided.  All they have to do is find it, close it, and collect their 4k.  Even an M1 killer will be able to interrupt you before completing a door unless they spawned opposite sides of the map.  If they're playing Billy, Nurse, Spirit it doesn't even matter how far they spawn, you have no chance to complete a door.  If you both show up to the hatch at the same time the killers animation takes automatic precedence.  It doesn't matter how fast you click.  
---
You basically have to get incredibly lucky and find the hatch immediately before them or hope the spawns are opposite map sides and they aren't playing any of the 3 previously mentioned killers.  
---
Objectively I don't understand how anyone can deny the EGC is killer sided.  I wasn't even trying to argue about it, you just took me by shock a bit with your denial of the killers edge.
---
I personally absolutely hated the ending and Ghostface reveal of season 2. Season 1 was definitely better
---
&gt; This subreddit is infested with Only-Killers it's hilarious.
---
thats why 99% of the comments are survivor focused and survivor comments gets a lot of upvotes compared to the killer ones. totally killer focused.
---
Hiding in a locker when the killer knows you're there is not "trying not to die". If you reach the point you need to enter a locker to avoid getting mori'd, you're already dead, killing you is just a formality.
---
They can spot you through gaps in the shack as well.
---
Well the hook goes right below their left elbow, which I presume no vitals are located. You could survive it, I mean, the same survivors are being struck with hammers/knives/blades multiple times and still survive.
---
Yeah, looks like you weren't allowed to occupy the same place as the thrown pallet had. Which is interesting.
---
You‚Äôre being downvoted because you‚Äôre wrong
---
But how are you gonna throw the pebble without leaving the locker and getting tombstoned? ü§î
---
How wholesome. I helped a new player learn how to play as survivor the other day. Really makes me happy to know the community can be pretty cool.
---
So this is the list of bugged perks from my understanding;
---
- Wake up 
---
- Sprint Burst
---
- All token based perks
---
- Furtive Chase
---
- Play With Your Food
---
- Someone mentioned that Thanatophobia might be bugged on the forums but I am not sure. 
---
The devs have really outdone themselves with this patch. The patch even managed to break GF personal perks the day they are released.
---
You don't.  It's only when it's legit camping.
---
Not really. Thanks for your input though :)
---
Did I say it was a secret? I just said I have never encountered the issue myself and have been playing lots of survivor. I‚Äôm sorry you have experienced this and others but I personally have never seen it but I never said it was a secret.
---
Hey Riley from PA, don't share iCloud links with strangers. It makes it super easy to dox you.
---
I easily trust that, I'm shit at the game.
---
You can't tell if someone is bringing tombstone for an achievement or because they want to use an addon  unless they communicate it with you by hitting the locker
---
Captain Kirk as survivor?
---
I like it!
---
i-
---
Entity said you have to bring me along as well
---
1. The community here can be pretty friendly but actual in-game chat can be toxic.
---
2. It can be buggy but I would say most of my games run as intended (about 85%)
---
3. Not very big. Just play the tutorial and you will learn the rest by playing it watching other play on YouTube or Twitch.
---
4. The game isn't pay to win perse but some good perks (BBQ and Chilli) are locked behind a killer that you have to pay for. Or you can wait for the perk to come into a weekly rotation of perks you can buy with in-game currency.
---
5. I'm not sure about Xbox but the PS4 and PC playerbase is really good. The queue times are a bit ling but that's not from lack of players. The controller controls work great, at least for PS4.
---
You seem to have missed the part where I said "aside from that specific situation". The only part of EGC that is killer sided is the specific situation in which the last survivor gets found after the hatch has been closed, in all other circumstances I find it easier to survive than before EGC was introduced.
---
The old mechanic either meant the killer would get a 3K when they played well, theyd get lucky and find the survivor before they find the hatch or you'd spend way too long just staring at eachother. It was incredibly survivor sided and now there's a chance for both sides to actually win but suddenly it's killer sided. If the killer finds the hatch first it probably should be killer sided, if the survivor finds the hatch first it's survivor sided. Therefore there's not really much of an issue with the current system aside from some assholes waiting for the timer instead of hooking.
---
I also found that, right after they put in EGC, if the killer closes it, EGC starts instantly. Not sure if they ever changed this, but I had an EGC with all five gens, and two people still alive.
---
Head on does not work.
---
yea i have the dlc in the tab, but i dont have the killer Aand survivor
---
I'm not Ina kyf! My perk aren't maxed... Can't you see?
---
Good video, this is honestly my biggest issue in the game.
---
Hahahahaha this was me a few nights ago!!
---
Was looking for the survivor around the half-finished gen in the shack when I decided to check the locker closest to the door.  Ace popped out of the other locker and then I immediately executed him by accident.  I forgot I was still in T3.
---
When legion had the nasty blade and filthy blade add ons together they stacked so much mending time required that it took people ages to mend. I think someone mended for 5 minutes and if they let go it was over.
---
Rich company aside?
---
Felt kinda bad but oh well.
---
Furtive chase is bug how?
---
No, but you did go on about how they always fix killers and leave survivors bugged, and theres issues in the game at this exact moment that are direct proof of that being incorrect
---
oh im such an idiot, i dont have the check mark lol... thank u so much bro
---
Maybe designed to down someone in shroud?
---
Btw you can record clips from the console itself
---
Great reply! Im really close to buying the game now üòÑ Is there a Discord server where i can ask for help as a newb?
---
Infact the 3v1 is another bug...
---
This is where dwight's go to orgasm
---
Is Wake Up! the only broken survivor perk?
---
 I didn‚Äôt know that was the signal that you had Tombstone because despite my hits on the locker, every survivor I‚Äôve faced forced me to hook them.
---
Congrats
---
That's not a very specific situation though it is extremely commonplace.   Generally speaking the killer will find the hatch first.  They're faster and can cover more ground quicker.  The hatch close mechanic is more likely to come into play than you are giving credit for.  I rarely find it last in my killer games.  Objectively I can take a step backwards and acknowledge the fact that it has never been easier to secure a 4K with the addition of the EGC.
---
To be fair a lot of people didn't use the infinites out of empathy.
---
Oh I never said I was entitled though
---
I claimed that survivor bugs take longer to be fixed than killer bugs which you have still failed to prove to me how my statement was incorrect as you have also stated that this legion bug is relatively new therefore the fact it is in the game does not prove me wrong until a week or a month goes by. Thank you for your useless argument have a good day.
---
Same. On Xbox too.
---
It would be neat but sadly they can‚Äôt the ghostface dlc is only the mask
---
Yeah I thought about this before, but if Killers can heave a full survivor on their shoulder and only be slightly encumbered, shatter entire pallets with 2 stomps, and have access to crazy abilities that allows them to become ever more deadly? I‚Äôm pretty sure even if Legion wouldn‚Äôt be actually strong enough for all of them, he‚Äôd certainly be faster.
---
No worries, I‚Äôm glad I was able to help you! You aren‚Äôt an idiot haha it happens and we always think it‚Äôs a much bigger problem than what it turns out to be!
---
i don‚Äôt see this happen often, but i guess it takes good timing skills to pull off
---
 **He üëè is üëè a üëè licensed** **üëè character**
---
Oh btw at what framerate does the game run on PS4 for you?
---
Umm
---
there's other ways to communicate it, but just like with farming, survivors are almost always stupid and probably won't understand
---
That is a specific situation though. It might be common but that doesn't mean it's not specific.
---
I'm saying it's fair. The killer killed 3 people before the final gen was done. You have an opportunity to escape, albeit a slim one which is much better than having to finish off all the remaining gens only to get murdered at the gates, right?
---
lmao, have fun and see ya in the fog!
---
Hmm maybe toxic maybe no hook close enough either way strange interaction that the devs need to have a look at because im sure theres situations where it happens by accident and fucks the killer up. Ive played killer and not been able to hook someone at the end because there wasnt a hook by the exit gates so i think Mr SillyBilly got downvoted to hell for no reason, cant know for sure the circumstances as the guy in the video didnt confirm anything either, maybe he teabagged at every pallet or something lmao, seems like this sub may be more survivor biased
---
Just turned on the volumeüëåüèªüëåüèª
---
Wake up bug didn't create any fun builds.  It created an exploit that cheating douchebags decided to take advantage of to create an unfair advantage for themselves.  Only scumbags knowingly exploit.
---
But if I know they‚Äôve got tombstone and I can extend the game for my team by hopping in a locker to force the hook or an extension of the chase that‚Äôs meaningfully adding time to the game to get gens done.
---
He‚Äôs been playing the game everyday for 2 years, he should be able to do that. Even then Zubat did it in one stream compared to Tru3 it took him multiple streams
---
I'm not sure. Probably 30 if I had to guess. I dont really get bothered by that stuff
---
Parry this you fucking causal
---
No because I've never done that before
---
sUb iS kIlLeR bIaSEd
---
Yes its downloading
---
Theres an official discord /deadbydaylight and I'm sure they have a general or tips channel
---
Funny because I see it the other way
---
If its running smoothly as i hope it is im fine wit that
---
lol nice man, p3 ghost, red rank, and bbq on first web, has to be satisfying.
---
LOL so I provide proof from the current state of the game, but oh because I dont go through every bug thats existed in the last 3 years that means you're right, despite the fact you havent named ONE instance that proves your own point true. In fact, you spoke only in hypotheticals, using words like "would". How does your brain even perform the mental gymnastics to achieve such logic? You're dense as fuck mate lmao
---
Albeit slim one...there you go man you're basically right there admitting that the EGC is killer sided which is all I was looking for on the first place lol.  This shouldn't have even been a discussion if you're willing to admit that lol.
---
Frickin nailed it
---
Stop your survivor apolgisism. Exploiting bugs should result in a ban/suspension.
---
The only action I know of that gives survival points besides escaping is doing selfcare and its only like 100 points per full heal
---
1. I've never been told to kill myself more in my life
---
2. the game is littered with bugs
---
3. not a big learning curve
---
4. some things are pay to win, most things aren't
---
5. lots of people play. don't queue up for killer it will be the last thing you ever do.
---
Realistically you can just tackle hag and hogtie her down.
---
Also realistically some survivors would probably fight back rather than run.
---
im honestly so sorry for all the people that lost their hearing after this oop--
---
At least this game will get new content
---
Any unhook will cause a survivor to become the obsession instead of just unhooking a survivor who is the obsession. 
---
As a result people have been using perks like Make Your Choice with Furtive chase for great effect in building up tokens. It would be somewhat broken if Furtive chase was just a better perk.
---
Combing the Furtive Chase glitch + PWYF glitch &amp; make your choice has become somewhat of a powerful synergy as it allows the killer to constantly have 3 tokens of PWYF if they make use of Make your choice.
---
Claudette looking like a meal üëÖ
---
I feel like to balance it out, it should increase wiggle speed when the killer stops moving of bumps into objects. Boil over knocks you all over the place and makes you run into things, essentially doing what the perks supposed to without seeming like it gives a survivor an unfair advantage the killer has no control over
---
Nice try, PainReliever
---
This is outrageous! It's unfair! How can you be in red ranks and not he qued with a red rank killer! It's insulting is what that is!
---
then when he picks u up u decisive strike and then open the hatch with a key.
---
Funny how one person says its not that buggy and the other says its full of bugs üòÇ Why shouldnt I queue as a Killer?
---
&gt; I don't see it much different than NOED. While NOED can be countered by totems, Rancor only affects one player, and they even see the killer aura time a gen is completed.
---
&gt; 
---
The difference is: 
---
* NOED: You down the survivor with one hit. You need to pick that survivor up which leaves you exposed to pallet save, flashlight save and even bodyblocks if the hooks are distant. After hooking that survivor, he still can be saved. 
---
* Rancor: You down the survivor with one hit. He is dead. Even if he hasn't been hooked all game, it doesn't matter.
---
Oh well that‚Äôs not good.
---
Alright listen carefully, this is what you do, press and hold Alt+f4, you should have your pig back.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
the current killer queues take about 99999999999999999999 years to actually load in. just play survivor if you value your time.
---
Dude stop hook camping
---
Ok how much did he pay you?
---
BHVR has this bizarre paranoia that if BP gains are ever increased, nobody will play the game
---
They've taken the view of DbD being a F2P title despite it being paid game, that people will continue to play even if they get every perk on every character.
---
Yes. The hatch mechanic is killer sided provided the killer finds it first and the survivor isn't already at an exit gate. I've escaped so many times by just waiting at the exit while the killer wanders around looking for the hatch, it's honestly easier than looking for the hatch before EGC came out. Sometimes it doesn't work but most of the time it's a free escape.
---
The point of this discussion was about the pig but it's been derailed completely because you wanted to argue about semantics, if you have nothing more to say in regards to the actual topic at hand then I'm just going to stop responding.
---
So basically ill always have to play as a survivor?
---
I'm gonna stop you right there.
---
Removed - flamebait.
---
well, my caracter cried loudly in my tps view.
---
for the time being, yeah it's your best bet. don't be too worried, survivor is statistically more fun than killer.
---
&gt;It's still something you can do, unlike MoM which unless you have a instadown couldn't be countered. You also didnt know for sure if a survivor had MoM, unlike rancor which you know as soon as a single gen is done.
---
Saying "*leave the game or hide*" to counter Rancor is almost like telling killers not to hit survivors to counter MoM. As a survivor you would want to go back in the trial to assist your team.
---
It still kinda sucks that i wont be able to play with killers as often cuz thats the main reason why i wanted the game
---
Soon to be the nerfed Daniel
---
Its bugged rn so it affects everything including gens, it's just supposed to be for exit gates
---
well, u can always group up your friends and play the Kill Your Friends game mode (which most people don't want to play but i'm always up for it.) and have access to every item in the game.
---
Done it once. Similar to the pull out method.
---
I don't have anything additional to add to my original pig point.  You just admitted finally the hatch mechanic is killer sided.  Now going back to my original well defined point pigs old traps that only allowed a hatch escape would have been beyond broken with the EGC hatch close mechanic.  You'd effectively trap them into the map with you while you pick them off of one of your boxes.  Even if they somehow miraculously got their trap off (which they wouldn't) they'd then have to somehow open a door on top of that.  That would be so unbelievably lopsided for the pig it wouldn't even be debatable.
---
Dont have friends who play xbox üò¨
---
oof
---
The o ly reason killer queues are so long is because a new killer (ghostface) just came out. Itll be normal in a few days
---
unless it's ghostface.
---
Simply Delicious meme
---
Oh ic
---
I don't even have wake up, people can't take a joke if it's not labeled smh
---
üò†
---
I admitted that EGC is killer sided if the killer closes the hatch and immediately finds a survivor. 
---
You didn't address any of my points as to what they could do to the pig to make her better without making her broken, please go back and reread my posts and then reply.
---
don't worry, its just because a new killer came out some days ago, and everyone is still trying him out. The times for lobbies wouldn't be as bad if it weren't for the fact that no survivor was released this chapter, which means there was no interest on the survivor side.
---
How the fuck does my post have 10 comments and 0 upvotes was it really that bad
---
why so ? do people complain? 
---
dont get me wrong, i'm not calling ghost op or something
---
Gonna flashlight spam some whippersnappers.
---
then bubba comes in and chainsaws them all down as david t-bags the hatch
---
its really good , but it would be really funny if you just be a locker
---
I checked his recent video. Dude sounded like he hated doing what he does. No emotion in his voice whatsoever and not even live commentary that I could tell. Felt like everything was scripted. Literally did almost fell asleep while watching this dude.
---
I love report of the week lol
---
It's just because they released a new killer. Times will level back out soon in the coming weeks.
---
I üëè fucking üëèknow üëè

Hey! I just got hit by one of those earlier. 
---
*Oh, cool. I didn‚Äôt know firecrackers blind you. Nice!*
---
It's really buggy currently after they added Ghostface and matchmaking is matching good players with noobs but the games great and Ghostface is getting nerfed and he's mediorce but fun. Community is like toxic sludge in-game but here everyone is nice. That's all I got besides look up a few videos of guides and stuff
---
**Nightmare** **üëè on üëè elm üëè streetüëè is üëè also üëè dead**
---
Sos he‚Äôs an even bigger whore now?
---
Yep lmao
---
Happened to me when I played Ghost face for the first match on live. Was rank 12 with only thrilling tremors, and I got put up against 3 baby survivors (20) and a P3 Quentin with a purple flashlight (4) that kept challenging, blinding me, and getting marked
---
Suffice to say, he didn‚Äôt make it
---
Well the spotting mechanic is kinda too small for what they wanted and he could stalk to replenish the exposed status so that's getting removed and spotting him will be easier to do by 8% plus all but 2 of his add-ons are getting kinda nerfed but not really
---
This is why killers use Franklin's in their builds.
---
Lol the start of EGC creates that beyond broken situation I just put forth.  I don't understand how you can essentially suggest her old traps should be fine with EGC.  They wouldn't and I provided a bulletproof argument for why they wouldn't be healthy in EGC.  All you have to do is trap them before EGC.  As long as a gen pops prior to EGC her traps function just as they always have and you can take advantage of the ridiculously unfair situation I used for my argument.  Ypu aren't entitled to a guaranteed 4k simply because of your killer power synergizing ridiculously with EGC
---
We talking game breaking/game crashing buggy, or just kind of annoying buggy? And when it comes to playing Survivor, how what is the solo que meta like?
---
Thanks for your input!
---
The Weekly Report is the shit!
---
The toxic fanbase
---
The Report of the Week is the shit!
---
im a survivor main but moris are still my favorite part. i always thank my killer at the end for the beautiful mori. its like the finishing moves in mortal kombat! who doesn't like watching those??
---
Spooky
---
I'm sure this is about her hatchets, they said they felt it wasn't right, they changed it and got it wrong.
---
they reversed everything and now it's still just as broken as it was .
---
Players can be muted right? And there is no way to for the killer and survivors to chat with each other in-game?
---
Dumb question, just making sure though.
---
Well kinda game breaking but not really and they are trying to patch it believe besides a few bugs the game is not buggy and soloing as survivor can be frustrating sometimes but it's not bad and the meta for survivors right now is actually fairly big but for Killers it's pretty small also recommend waiting on buying Ghostface because of his nerf plus it isn't movie Ghostface just a reporter with the mask.
---
The last patch fucked up a few things, but it's still the most fun game I've played. Players are toxic af tho and that's the biggest problem atm.
---
Relax hes a tad bit special. It's a survivor mains go to approach when it comes to screaming how the games killer sided
---
Jesus Christ, dude, did you even watch the fucking video?
---
he should be still viable right
---
because i considered buying him
---
Occasional crashes but more so annoying buggy. Meta for survivor is probably some exhaustion perk, self care, bond or empathy, and something else. I dunno I just run what feels fun. I recommend We're Gonna Farm Forever, I mean We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
*ghostface sighs* ‚ÄúFineeee.‚Äù

He's good, but very buggy. He's worth a buy, just don't expect him to work perfectly as intended 100% of the time.
---
What rank for the most part
---
At the moment he is very good and with add ons is incredibly strong. There is a nerf incoming because his power is a bit strong so maybe wait until after that comes to decide
---
Got you. So do players tend to live and die by the current meta, or people kind do whatever? I have no problems with metas, just don't like trying to be forced into them.
---
Well right now survivors are kinda getting way better at kicking him out of his ability so if we add the 8% wider detection rate that could make him low tier but unlikely. He'll probably become kinda viable but not so much
---
There aren't any game-crashing bugs, but there are some game-breaking perks and add-ons atm.  
---
Survivor meta is Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Sprint Burst, Object of Obsession(because of Ghostface being the most recent killer). For your survivor build, I recommend using Adrenaline/Second-chance perk, Exhaustion perk, We're Gonna Live Forever, any perk you have fun with(I suggest Hope, Quick and Quiet, Borrowed Time, etc.).
---
What‚Äôs a money grab about DBD?
---
Also f13 has like 5 players online at any time lul
---
Considering they couldn't get the rights for jason but still published the game, then got it banned from creating further content due to the creators of the movie franchise saying to lendong copyright. The games dead and they are still trying to sell it. At least dbd produces worthwhile content
---
For killers it's kinda that but for survivors use anything you want you'll still probably live.
---
didnt they buff ghost
---
what was the point of buffing him if you gonna put him in the trash right after
---
FUCK YOU FACE CAMPING AND TUNNELING KILLERS YOU SUCK SO MUCH ASS YLU PEISES OF SHIT CUNTS FUCK YOU FUCK YOU ALL GET SOME SKILL AND LEARN HOW TO FUCKING PLAY THE GAME YOU SUCK SO MUCH FUCK YOU
---
Well the game itself is addicting. The gameplay works really well and with many perks and items available can provide players with the chance to mix and combine different perks and items to make different builds that all have varying degress of impact on gameplay while also changing the way you may play the game.
---
There are 16 killers now in the game all with their own unique perks and powers that give them special properties. They all look drastically different from each other, some being from popular media like Michael Myers or GhostFace which you have seen. 
---
Thats not to say that there is nothing bad about dbd;
---
- There are still some balancing issues in the game. At higher ranks the game can become balanced towards survivors due to how quickly the objectives of the game can be completed without certain perks. 
---
- The game has a large element of RNG in it. This is both a curse and a blessing. It can be great as it makes the map feel different every time you play it but it can also be horrible as it can make the map either killer favoured or survivor favoured. 
---
- Some perks/items are better than others. This is sad to see but many perks in the game are just never used due to how poor there impact is on gameplay compared to the more popular perks. 
---
- The devs are inconsistent. Although they are pleasant and recently have been listening to community feedback, they still make questionable decisions and balance changes. 
---
- Devs also tend to leave bugs behind in their game. They eventually get fixed but it can take awhile. Currently a big fuss over many bugs being added with the Ghostface release. 
---
- Currently the game is a bit grindy with the large amount of teachable perks you can unlock from different characters. The devs have expressed interest in helping with the blood point grind but right now there is definitely a grind if you want to get all the perks available in the game.
---
Overall I would definitely recommend the game. If you like the aspect of experimenting with different builds and like the look of the gameplay then I would purchase Dead by Daylight. If you get into the game then you will find yourself investing hundreds of hours into the game.
---
To camp the chest?
---
You don't seem to understand that in order for them to be trapped they'd need to have a trap on their head before EGC starts. It would only affect anyone who gets downed between the final gen pop and the door opening ergo it wouldn't be OP because they'd probably already be running around searching boxes unless their teammates are assholes and opened the gate (not much different than someone popping a gen while you've got a trap on).
---
If this was an argument about Nurse, Billy or even Spirit I'd probably agree but Pig isn't even that good of a killer, we were all excited for EGC because it could've made her great with a specific build but instead that dream got denied and a certain play style for her got gutted. 
---
Other alternatives to her (going to keep bringing this one up until you comment on it) would be to have traps start ticking if you heal or unhook another survivor (prioritizing someone else instead of following your own will to survive) or if Pig had ruleset no.2 built into her kit (not being able to see box auras until your trap was active). What's your opinion on these two suggestions?
---
I see you in there, just come out already!
---
Cool. You mention game breaking perks. How often do those pop up and how quickly are they usually addressed, if at all?
---
I believe that's called Cognitive Dissonance, if he wasn't being toxic, he'd have just took him to a hook or away from the exit gates so he can't escape rather than dick around with him like that.
---
"Give it back, this isn't right! That was ours!" Kaz sums up how I feel when I lose map offerings like that.
---
Like the game should return the offering if you don't get the map. I know I'm a bit sadistic but jigsaw pieces feel EXTREMELY rare (And THE GAME is almost nonexistent without the offering) on my Doctor bloodwebs and it's 50/50 whenever I use them if another survivor uses a coldwind offering or Haddonfield offering and we get that map instead.
---
Fake, he wouldn't swing and waste his play with your food stacks.
---
Got it. Makes sense from what I know about the killers.
---
I'm not a fan of the dev team, personally. They make a lot of weird and bad design choices, and their philosophy regarding game balance is baffling.
---
High quality enough to be in a report written by the man himself
---
2 fucking games in a row
---
Yes, of course...
---
It really do be like that
---
Yees
---
Hiding in the gate as nurse for a nice surprise.
---
But seriously, it really has no purpose that I've seen actually used. Maybe it could confuse a survivor that a killer was looping, but I can't imagine that would work well.
---
Yo camp a pallet?
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me!! DONT LOOK AT MEEEE!!!‚Äù
---
I call him Jesus for a reason when I see him
---
Gees. Calm down man. It's just a game.
---
I think his ego is bigger than him
---
No trash just mid low tier as his add-ons are still going to be strong just his base stalking being toned down as it's really buggy currently plus these were the hotfix notes meaning they planned it while he was still in the PTB
---
You don't understand, survivors are trapped in a loop of dying over and over again with no escape from their fate, all their efforts amounting to nothing as the cycle repeats itself for eternity.
---
The Entity is Gold Experience Requiem.
---
Game breaking bugs don't pop up that often. They took a while to address them last time(all they did was say "anyone who uses those add-ons will be banned) iirc.
---
To camp the exit gates?
---
I've actually been working on a Shining chapter. Still a work in progress however
---
Again the sole reason her traps needed altering was the hatch close mechanic.  That aspect alone was the reason the devs rightly changed her traps.  
---
I'm not commenting on it because it's a horrible idea.  What part of our discussion makes you think I support making it easier for her to activate traps.  Only one thing should activate her traps and that is the popping of a gen.  They function just as they always have if this occurs.
---
EGC ie the act of closing the hatch or opening a gate should not activate the traps and they don't as the devs recognized the unbalance of this and correctly adjusted it.  In no way shape or form do I support anything other than the popping of a gen activating a trap.
---
No chatting in-game, but people can become impressively enraged in the post-game chat if they lose, and occasionally even when they win. Luckily the devs don't know how to functionally add a post-game chat regardless, so half your games you won't even be able to use the feature /s
---
To camp a totem?
---
Noted. Appreciate the input.
---
I've said this before, every game is logged with perks, chase time, time spent on a generator, time spent repairing, time spent injured... They know everything

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
I run Unnerving, Overcharge, Distressing (FLEX PERK. I use BBQ but you could use something like Franklins if you see items, Sloppy or Clownphobia for slower healing, Ruin to slow the game down but that fucker always gets cleansed less than a minute in so I stopped using it etc.)
---
A couple days ago I played as huntress and 2 people disconnected immediatly when the game started. The other 2 were swf who both seemed like they had just bought the game. Failed 99% of their skillchecks and constantly tried to run from me without doing gens even though I was trying to show my friendliness. I had to message one of them and tell them where my ruin was so they could actually start doing gens. It took them 10 minutes to do a gen with ruin and I had to speed things up. After that I went afk and let them do their thing and escape.
---
Definitely wouldn't be my first experience with an out of touch dev team. Any changes or choices recently you didn't agree with? I know a bit about the game, so you don't have to dumb it down too much, lol.
---
This is everything that's wrong with this shitty website.
---
Insidious could be useful for preventing a survivor form activating Borrowed Time I suppose if they are running in for a hook save. 
---
You could also use it to make a survivor think you have left a place when in reality you are waiting for them. Maybe in a jungle gym if you lose their LOS. 
---
Freddy can use it if he is hunting a survivor in the dream world who is within 24 meters. Monitor &amp; Abuse would be a much better alternative though.
---
I have to say, though, this game is very addicting, and it doesn't have any real competition
---
I like this, but Freddy would be in his own separate category called Darn
---
*A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party.*
---
What does p3 claudette mean? Sorry im new
---
To camp the lockers?
---
which was the hardest for you to get?
---
He can force heal a health state by picking up and dropping 4 times. They won‚Äôt wiggle so you can carry them somewhere isolated. Given that most achievement hunters will also run PWYF, you should be plenty fast enough to get them before they get too far
---
Amanda doesn't deserve to be there because nobody would dare to hurt her
---
*Life isn‚Äôt all sunshine and bunnies, you know.*
---
So, people will have like a 30 second window to spew nonsense post game? I seen the post match screen in some videos but, didn't know players could talk during it.
---
I think Clown could take a bullet considering how fat he is
---
Well, I hope you have a nice day.
---
Ah, old times
---
Let‚Äôs not forget how trappers traps could essentially clip through most terrain, rendering them literally invisible until a *very* late game patch
---
Except slow ass motherfuckin jeff
---
As was mentioned in another comment, this would lead to even longer and more frustrating queue times, especially as survivors, if the killer could keep disconnecting til he got gray survivors.
---
Well made, absolutely brilliant. This needs to be the top of all time on this sub!
---
Is there anything I can do to get these fools banned? I saved the full match if that helps. Stay after I was killed to get all the footage of the David running around with Ghostface and having just a good old time.
---
After prestiging a character you get your outfit more bloody, and with Claudette given her dark skin the blood actually makes her more camouflaged, thus harder to see
---
I ran it the other day and no one bled out. Nothing happened to anyone they just were deep wounded for longer. Are you sure?
---
Update: after an hour of waiting, I suddenly got 4 people, the match started, then someone disconnected, so back to the lobby I go.
---
The search continues.
---
While I hate camping and tunneling there is no rule against and if your new to the game to have to get used to it
---
Are you sure it would kill wraith? He isnt really human anymore
---
the bitch deserved to be fuckin' tortured, gosh i couldn't stand that character
---
B0rger king Myers
---
His videos are kinda bland, it would be better if he was a little more eccentric and wouldn‚Äôt voice over his audio
---
She participated in ritual sacrifices, but wasn‚Äôt the instigator. Just the priest of the situation. So I doubt it counts
---
Whilst I've never got *that* angry at facecampers, it is definitely annoying.
---
Hope you have some good games, dude
---
If a killer drops a survivor and picks them up again, the survivors wiggle bae will go up
---
It‚Äôs so frustrating tho 2 games in a row
---
New people don‚Äôt really get any in your face notification about perks. Hell, I didn‚Äôt even know I could get 60,000 BP from the two tutorials for a while. There should be at least tooltips for your first lobby session. 
---
Like ‚Äúchoose a perk! Check out these unique ones!‚Äù or ‚ÄúCheck out the tutorial real quick!‚Äù
---
Appreciate the detailed response! I am impressed that the game has fan base after being out a few years, but I just had to come here and get some insight. Definitely leaning towards the buy.
---
Right! I also noticed in the movies she was the best at kidnapping cos the guys it took 2 of them and they still struggled xD
---
Oh yeah I totally get it but it‚Äôs so scummy and ruins the game
---
So far.
---
most of my survivor games are ghostface on console
---
it's just a visual bug, you actually got 4 stacks
---
Known visual bug.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs a known visual bug right now. Don‚Äôt worry you got your stacks :)
---
Lmao if I could play that much I wouldn‚Äôt see daylight for days!
---
He can be pallet looped
---
nobody tell him what happens to amanda in saw 3.
---
I play on PS4, so if I play I go on a community to find people on a KYF because you can get al the perks, t3
---
I can gurantee you you‚Äôd have a ton of fun with this build using both of his crouch speed addons. Hook a survivor, crouch at the speed of sound to a generator, give it a slap, continue on
---
i know what happened, i'm a huge fan of the Saw series
---
Wait, actually? what level of spaghetti code is this game on to have 3 different balance breaking bugged perks?
---
Solidarity is one of those. Didn't heal me at ALL. I use it on Jane because I like it and its definitely broken.
---
PC version has a text chat in the scoreboard screen, PS4 does not, you'd have to message players via PSN to talk to them, and you could set your messages to friends only. However, my own experience with messages from other players were not negative. I always play pretty fair though because I want everyone to have fun.
---
Did I say I used it?
---
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs ridiculous that they would have to ban people for using perks or add-ons when its the devs fault its broken.
---
People trying to get into spots on maps they shouldn‚Äôt, fair enough. Theres no reason to do that. However to say ‚Äúright you cant use these perks that you paid for and grinded to unlock because we broke them‚Äù really takes the piss.
---
This patch is a fucking shambles and this shit has been going on for a long time. There is zero quality control with this developer.
---
As for DS, I don‚Äôt blame the other players because they dont know it failed but its fucking tilting to use a perk, have it not activate and then get hooked.
---
Sorry, I you misspelled that last word. It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúsalt.‚Äù
---
Got it! Thanks for the clarification.
---
Go for it, you‚Äôll be hooked in no time ;)
---
i think we did a good job SSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
Jesus christ. This one mediocre meme has conviced you the entirety of reddit is shitty.
---
To camp the cleansing fountains?
---
Man got to love slow ass motherfuckin Jeff
---
I think the fact survivor don't fear the killer but have means of fighting back is what makes this game so different compared to other "similar" horror games.
---
Love the simplicity
---
I'm a huge fan of saw but Amanda was horrible like great characters but an annoying one
---
No but its the devs fault that people cant use perks or add ons they paid for and spent hours grinding bloodpoints for because of constant fuck ups on the devs part. 
---
Oh you paid us money for legion? You grinded some add-ons for him? Well too bad, you cant use him because we fucked them up.
---
You paid for the freddy dlc? You want wake up to help you for the new ridiculously killer sided endgame? Oh too bad we fucked up that perk so you cant use it
---
The blame falls on the company.
---
:)
---
Dude this is so good! Great meme? I absolutely LOVED it!
---
Well yes but technicly no
---
Yes it is lmao. It made a gen 20 seconds if you had four people running it with purple tool boxes. And it increases vault speed which is just downright disgusting that anyone would NOT get banned for it.
---
the killer experience at higher ranks can be abysmal sometimes but nothing feels better than getting a four kill against a group of tryhards
---
sometimes it gets buggy and it can make you lose but overall this game is my favorite game and i‚Äôm so glad i found it a year ago
---
"Goodness."
---
Exactly. You paid for that perk. You grinded to unlock it. Now you‚Äôre meant to change your build because the devs cant put out a single patch without breaking shit.
---
The game updates are becoming ridiculous with how many new problems they introduce.
---
Story mode is fun!!!  Online is a whole another level... especially being new. You need to make friends quick.  Because older players usually target the new ones.. join Facebook gta5 online groups to make friends.
---
This is, running on empty.
---
He‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Amanda gets shot and fucking dies in SAW 3 so...
---
That was Cecil.
---
That game has like 3 people playing it
---
HybridPanda isn‚Äôt!!
---
no it‚Äôs defensive strike noob
---
wait what's the wake up abuse?
---
To camp the bear traps?
---
Sounds good. Pretty sure Imma buy it, but what is tryharding in this game? I know in general, it refers to using overpowered, broken mechanics, but what are some DBD specific things that are considered tryharding (whether they are or aren't being a completely different story)?
---
I had Jeff p3 all perks within a week of release, Jeff mains are out there. Dozens of us!
---
I never hate on a killer if they dont camp or tunnel.. if they win and didnt do that that means they are actually good.
---
It is inconceivable to leave someone behind. Gain the ability to carry survivors that are in the dying state at 60/70/80% base movement speed and heal them 30/40/50% quicker.
---
You can only carry one dying survivor at a time.
---
This is the best thing I could come up with.
---
Lol that all?
---
I‚Äôve recently come back to DBD after a 3 month hiatus so I‚Äôm in low ranks. It‚Äôs literally in over 90+ of the games. If you don‚Äôt have Borrowed Time then you aren‚Äôt getting an unhook.
---
Ghostface is a cunt too. Seems most players are content to just sit around the hook with him stalking any survivors that come near.
---
I'd like to use the power to stop pallet drops, vaults, and stuff like that, but I tried playing Doctor a few times and the charge time felt very long.
---
Which one was the most fun?
---
Lmao I would End Task for those The Game offerings
---
Altruistic Demise is very odd and No More Games would likely cause problems. Regardless, good job on the ideas!
---
It doesn‚Äôt relate to the character at all, it‚Äôs from a parody movie.
---
Always makes me wonder if the little fill bar for the killer when the hook someone matters.
---

---
Used it once. The end game collapse screwed me out of my last kill. Jake wouldn't stop hiding in lockers and I got pissed cause I really wanted the achievement.
---
You think Kate is as Thicc as Jane? You trippin
---
Still really annoying
---
To camp the windows?
---
Are you applying it directly to the forehead?
---
Why are you like this
---
I still watch him occasionally, mostly because no one else I like is live when he is.
---
I have noticed he's been a bit more whiny lately. And his new "no balance talk" days strike me as odd. You're limiting 90% of conversations people have about DBD because people don't agree with your ideas?
---
I think he's a good guy, but maybe he's getting a bit burnt out. I'd love to see him how he used to be.
---
Rip man I feel bad for you
---
and Daddy's thirsty.
---
Yeah I get it, sadly it‚Äôs apart of the game and you gotta hope to not get those annoying killers.
---
How do you *just last week* start hunting achievements.
---
Taking One for the Team requires you to take a hit by a hook to protect 250 survivors.
---
I barely get 5 of those per play session, I really hope you already had that one because it's still a fucking slog for me after 900 hours and actively going for every achievement.
---
Also, Skilled Huntress? Shit's impossible without farming.
---
I'm quite enjoying the new gen-grabber achievement, though.
---
True
---
I mean you deserved it. "Messing around" by wasting someone's time makes you look like a dick.
---
Yep been feeling the same way. Just can't watch him because he acts so whiny.
---
Only thing I'll kill myself on first hook against is a gen protecting prayer beads spirit. Shits boring and I wanna actually play the game.
---
People likr you make us happy we camp
---
Fixed it for you..."Rancor should activate super crutch status and give me NOED once hatch is closed"
---
Give me a break.
---
That‚Äôs sick and twisted those people ruin the game for others
---
Didn't even know, just watched Evil dead II today!
---
I don‚Äôt often make posts like this because I feel people can play how they want but you can‚Äôt complain about toxic killers when you dc in the beginning of a match leaving your team at a disadvantage.
---
I watched his last video something about power role. He made many obvious mistakes and still blamed it all on the survivors. He played against a good team sure but when you refuse to pick anyone up, over commit to chases, and try to stalk in front of hooked survivors you didn't play your best. He was much happier playing mortal kombat and i actually enjoyed watching him play.
---
Yep. But noooo we're just attacking him with our reddit mob mentality, it couldn't possibly be anything HE'S doing, it's everyone else's fault.
---
Stop posting your shitty videos
---
Pallet regen could be a rare offering or something
---
Triggered much
---
Love you, buddy! See ya in the fog
---
When F13 was still alive I enjoyed it a lot more but it was a much more casual game and really isn‚Äôt comparable to DbD. At this point given the state of F13 it‚Äôs really just a shell of what it was/could have been
---
Wait hol up
---
Protect your trap
---
I don't understand why people do this just suck it up and take 1 depip instead of 2
---
Well it would be dumb if that was the excuse. Using Wake Up is not cheating. It is called exploiting a bug. To cheat means players would have to put something into the game that is not in the game to begin with. I.E. wall hacks, speed hacks, cross hairs, etc... Is it something that should be taken advantage of? NO. Just the same as it is for killers to tunnel and camp. No matter what the devs say about it being a legit strategy is stupid. 
---
When everyone first started playing this game upon it's release, all players went into the game not knowing how to play. Every person who tried out killer first more than likely camped their first victim they managed to put on a hook. As there was no tutorials/explanations back then this was common within the first few weeks of the game. Almost every survivor started off immersed. They didn't want to get hooked as they knew it meant the end of their game. Thus began the evading process (juking, pallets, immersion) which lead to infinites. Once those were found survivors used and abused them to avoid killers. Players complained (mostly middle ground players and killer exclusive players) that this was broken. So devs fixed it, and so on with other means of game play that were toxic/unfun to play against. No one likes being looped for hours as a killer with double pallet jungle gyms and 2 windows. Yet they still support one of the most toxic things a killer can do: CAMPING.
---
Until BHVR says they will ban for it, super toxic survivors will continue to use it. It's not cheating as it is something the devs broke in their game. They need to fix it ASAP.
---
using spirit fury and ending every game regardless of who he's playing is actually making his life harder.
---
Like we care about you rofl
---
Yout not the center of the world honey
---
It's for sure a visual bug, it's the same for we're gonna life forever and remember me. But you still get the points and effects of having all 4 stacks.
---
Well then you clearly dont read the sub very well.
---
Ugh ü§¶
---
I hope I age that well.  I'm probably going to look like a fucking Deadite.
---
Working gens together and purple toolboxes have nothing to do with the perk. Again, it only increases repair speed by 15%, which is 10.4 seconds less (and even less when multiple people are working on a gen, since they suffer repair speed penalties). Increasing vault speed by 100ms is not much, and there are perks that already do and have done that for years, namely Resilience and Spine Chill.
---
I can't see why it would be "downright disgusting" that people do not get banned for using the perk. But again, go ahead. Ban everyone that uses the perk, as well as everyone that uses Blades on Legion. That's surely a reasonable and useful thing to do, setting precedent that after updates we should probably refrain from doing much of anything if we don't want to run the risk of being banned, as tons of things are always bugged. For example, currently Clown's gas does not prevent survivors from fast-vaulting. That is a significant, game-changing bug affecting this killer - so should I as a survivor force myself to medium vault against Clown when affected by the Tonic, knowing that it is not working as intended currently? Should survivors that do not medium vault get banned? Surely they know it is bugged, and abuse the fact that they can still get medium vaults.
---
On pc too
---
But I started this list at launch of chapter 11
---
happens every other killer game for me lately
---
Abusing bugs is not playing the game as intended. That is cheating. I'm not sure why you keep making yourself seem dumber.
---
It‚Äôs just aggravating to see the double standard. If you don‚Äôt like a killer that‚Äôs fine, but at least try. You don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre toxic if you dc as soon as you see them lol.
---
Me a man who only plays survivor is saddened by that combo
---
What they should have done is just make the perk deactivate once the exit gates are powered. problem solved lmao.
---
T1 Myers isnt an ability, therefore it doesnt work on him
---
He s not a cool guy. He's entitled and worse, pretends to be humble. He really tries hard. But if you just scratch the surface you will see his self importance in every word he says.
---
?????
---
T1 Myers isn‚Äôt technically a stealth ability though, it‚Äôs just how he is naturally until he stalks into T2.
---
Yeah wtf
---
I prefer pink hair or neon far more than blendettes though
---
Yeah no thanks I'll just play something else or survivor some more until it's better
---
You‚Äôre hot and your cosplay is amazing
---
I swear most killers arent even bad to play against. I already see people dcing every game once the freddy rework drops and its gonna be so damn stupid.
---
That's not what OP asked. I'm a PC player myself and I'm going to need you to gtfo with that attitude.
---
Yeah this community doesn't like when killer streamers get too 'uppity', they've turned in Tru3/Marth88/Tyde, etc. for largely the same reasons.
---
You don't know how much I agree with this entire post.
---
I feel like Bubba should be with Spirit considering he literally took a fucking chainsaw to the belly and still didnt die
---
Hard part is that you are not only reworking the perk but adding a huge feature into the game. BHVR would have to introduce carrying dying survivors which is a big nerf to killers. 
---
I like the idea, but I don‚Äôt think this will ever see the fog of night.
---
The only thing that bothers me is people dcing just for seeing a killer they don‚Äôt like. Without trying at all. It ruins the game for everyone else.
---
I just in general like watching dbd clips or videos from different perspectives, but Tru3's have gotten insufferable lately.
---
He won't shutup about the hotfix coming to Ghost Face and is constantly bitching about literally everything about it, and then it leads to him just being salty during the match the entire time no matter what.
---

Tunneling is just doing the objective, like how gen-rushing isn't actually a thing. If survivor players want less kill-rushing then they should start being smarter with their rescues.

Damn what alcoholic beverage was your mother chugging down while you were in the womb?

Realistic isnt the right word. Believable is what I meant.

I‚Äôd love to see something like dragging a downed survivor but the problem I can see with that INSTANTLY is sandbaggers dragging people away from an exit gate or directly to the killer who left them slugged. Unfortunately would be kinda grief-y. I‚Äôd say No One Left Behind should have a smaller boost to all altruistic actions and then ramp up once the gates are open.
---
Oink.. :(
---
Well I main being killer so I use the blood web to get the perks j need
---
Lol karma is real
---
Ash, you live today. Happy birthday.
---
They did say though they are able to see who used wake up before the bug and people who only started using it once they knew about the bug. So they could ban people, who knows.
---
You're welcome.
---
90% of the time anyone actually does this is when they're the last person, so it's just wasting time for the majority of situations while nothing is happening
---
That‚Äôs why I and my friends don‚Äôt rush it and wait but it‚Äôs really annoying when you have a killer always looking at the people they‚Äôve just tunnelled
---
Especially if you‚Äôre a solo player.  It‚Äôs just really annoying to see.
---
Doc and Trapper would just shrug it off like "tis but a flesh wound"
---
Game is full of pussies.

Would be great, I love this show

Community is a bunch of assholes myself included, the devs have done a PRETTY GOOD... JOB SO FAR (there are metric tons of bugs, it‚Äôs a running meme cause a dev once said this when the game was in an AWFUL state), but they‚Äôre at least trying. Survivors tend to feel entitled to escape and get free unhooks no matter how close you are (Also you‚Äôre standing near the hook half a second after you hooked them? FUCKING CAMPER GET OUT OF HERE) meanwhile killers feel like every hit and hook should be easy and survivors shouldn‚Äôt be able to do half the stuff they do. Survivors scream for NOED nerfs while clinging to their Adrenaline as fair and balanced and Vice Versa for killers. We‚Äôre all in one big circlejerk of hate and will play like total asshats even though our actual end goal is really just to build up those points to unlock cool perks and shit.
---
Also fuck SWF it is a detriment to solo queue survivors and an unfair advantage against killers.
---
If you‚Äôve got friends that play then you can become the toxic SWF on comms like a swat team as shown by a certain animator in a recent episode, or if you have FOUR other friends that play you can enjoy Kill Your Friends where you have all perks, offerings and addons. Fun stuff.
---
I love it. I want it to reach the top
---
i think he‚Äôs more self aware than a lot of people give credit for. i think at the same time 6 hours of dead by daylight everyday would drive me fucking insane. it‚Äôs just not a game i could play that consistently without getting bored or hating the developers. i think he tried to avoid balance talks at a time because he just wanted to enjoy the game without thinking to much about it but even as a player myself that is super hard to do. and then after that it all comes down to if you agree with his opinions or not. i agree with a lot of what he says but obviously people are gonna disagree.
---
I think it would look horrible for their publicity as a company and be harmful to their playerbase if they banned players without atleast giving out a warning regarding the add-ons. 
---
Especially to do this kind of stuff during their anniversary event where they want to be bringing new players into the game.

I run that all the time with Dying Light and a Shroud and the obsession almost never DC's. Annoys me because I was under the impression that build is a free win as the obsession will see the secret offering, realize they started the trial asleep, and are the dying light, and will simply ragequit and result in an EZ win as survivors are down a man and have Dying Light from the get go. 
---
Tombstone Myers is scary as fuck. I don't get why people would DC from it. 
---
The only build I could see "Giving up" on is 3-gen "Hostage Doc". If the 3-gen can't be powered through in a reasonable timespan I might just let myself get killed so I can move onto the next match because being there trying to do a gen for an hour is where you might as well accept defeat. 
---
Not saying you should DC but if 3-gen doc is playing extremely defensively (And repeated attempts to do the gens have failed with no progress being built up) it might be best to just let yourself get killed and find a new match.
---
Understandable, I just play survivor more, and I got 4ks with my level 4 wraith and level 8 huntress, so I just never saw the need. I only decided to go full send only wraith so I can fight back against meta survivors. You can survive without running in circles, ya know?
---
They're both really good survivor maps though.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for killer role but just played survivor for about 2 hours, Rank 7, and my average wait was about 2 minutes. No problems for me (yet).
---
Jeff and Ash  are the ones who I always spare

So equipping a perk is not playing the game as intended? You use BP to acquire these perks to use them right? So using said perk is not cheating per say as some dont know about it. For the legit players who don't know it's a bug and run wake up, how are they cheating? They have no clue. Those that do know are abusing the shit out of it. There is no set rules in the game, other than no hacking in any assistance. Since this was not hacked into the game and comes directly from the devs fucking up, it is not out right cheating. Hence why people use the word exploit. I am not saying people should use it, I am giving examples/reasons why it is being abused. I'm not sure why you feel the need to answer a thought out response with a few sentences and no substance to your argument other than to try an attack my intelligence. Which I have not done to you, yet. How is any of what I said dumb when it's an opinion. You don't have to agree with it. I am not saying you should. I never once said ONLY killers were being toxic and they are OP. I said both sides are toxic and have done toxic shit to each other. Is it truly just semantics and you believe cheating is synonymous with exploiting? If so then that is where we'll never agree. Or Is it because you lack the brain power to actually counter my argument with anything other than "you're stupid"?
---
I should've taken a screenshot, i'm rank 8 surv, was playing solo and end of the game i see my killer is rank 18 what the fuq
---
Couldn‚Äôt ya open the gates or let him do gens? Not that it really matters.
---
I'm pretty sure new MoM activates regardless of whether or not you're injured.
---
By God, calm down man. Geez
---
It‚Äôs been happening for a week now but tbh I‚Äôm just chillin now
---
Then don't get spotted. After all, it doesn't punish you if you're not seen.
---
I run into a lot of legions using one of the blades not both. Using one is fine but both can have you end up with a soft ban. However I personally haven‚Äôt seen anyone be banned for it.  With wakeup I have seen a lot of people exploiting the bug recently but again haven‚Äôt seen anyone get banned.
---
Ah, yes, I‚Äôll run This Isn‚Äôt Happening, or Left Behind, or perhaps even Detectives Hunch. We all know those are FABULOUS perks!
---
Wraith isn‚Äôt human for one. And for 2 I think Doctor is a bit of a throw up. Is he dead or no?
---
Yeah but people using wake up know it's bugged, so if you use it knowing full well it's bugged you cannot be mad if you got a ban for it.
---
I haven't even touched survivor yet so I'm the opossum blood points only goes into killer because that's all I use
---
Any info on what causes this now?
---
What‚Äôs a tombstone Mayer?
---
Who's jeff? And why is he hated?
---
Depends really. Ghostface is fun in that he mixes up the game from being a normal M1 killer to a stealthy M1 killer. 
---
Using his crouch to sneak around the place and marking targets is actually quite fun and makes you feel like a true killer. I have personally found using perks like Devour Hope to be really fun on hi due to his ability to get really close to survivors and get downs relatively quickly. 
---
Myers is on a similar level to GF. Myers has better snowball potential and has a more consistent stealth level but his loud breathing combined with his taller figure makes him much more conspicuous. Other than that he plays like anyother M1 killer unlike GF who utilises stealth and postitioning more. 
---
Perkwise I would recommend Myers as Save The Best for Last is quite a decent perk with M1 killers. PWYF &amp; Dying light are both pretty poor. 
---
GF perks are all pretty poor. Im all ears is awful due to its long cool-down, Thrilling Tremors is alright but its cool-down + effect duration harm it &amp; Furtive chase is not particuarly great as it takes to long to build stacks and has very little impact on gameplay. 
---
Myers has better chase music than GF though. 
---
If you are looking for fun then I would recommend GF. His sneaking is fun to use and stronger than Myers due to his ability to crouch &amp; generally be less conspicuous. 
---
When players start getting used to GF then his power might become weaker as survivors will begin to break you out really easily, turning him into a normal M1 killer.
---
I don't think that's salt, that's just them being douche canoes
---
Birtht
---
the the the the legion
---
Oh totally forgot about the autoaim! That on nurse when she came out was nuts.
---
Yeah being able to heal completely in 2 pallet stuns or less was crazy.
---
I still like watching him, he just in that salty phase atm.
---
Nah you have to be injured.
---
A lot of the community just isn‚Äôt nice I‚Äôm afraid
---
The biggest cutie of them all
---
bulli_boi pretty much said everything there is, if you do decide to get it, the game has a really dedicated and loving fanbase (there are toxic people, but honestly ... Fuckheads like that shouldn't be listened to) who'll happily help you get into the game (as it has a really steep learning curve), people like me :D ! PM me if you'd like some begginer advice/answers to any questions you may have. Playing since release, Im sure i'd be able to help you (Yes. I had to brag about it, shut up everyone :D !)
---
In his last video about the "power play" its true he made alot of mistakes but you literally cannot lie that most of them escaped because of survivor meta perks all of them had DS and dead hard/exhaustion perks and were all incredibly coordinated i get he bitches alot but in that case he was justified
---
I mean they could atleast disable the perk 
---
I wanted to do the adept quentin, guess i'll wait
---
Get better, train night and day. Then one day, you destroy then.
---
if i'm going to be honest with my thoughts.
---
you remind me of No0b3 with your editing but really boring.
---
You are welcome (: it‚Äôs a struggle against all the toxicity sadly
---
This is so cute
---
I lost about...maybe 3-5 percent in a game where I passed a hooked surviver twice each while moving between a 3-gen area and twice while chasing another survivor. Are there percentages, times and distances listed anywhere? Is there an amount of time before it starts saying 'you're camping'? I ask because I usually play trapper or hag.
---
he has been
---
I...I can‚Äôt understand if that‚Äôs a dark joke or not sorry üòê
---
They removed it with end game collapse.
---
That works too, I guess...
---
Nice Job man, welcome to the club! Now let's wait for the next chapter xP
---
Agreed. But I remember McLean saying they aren't able to do that for whatever reason.
---
They remove it.
---
Appreciate the offer! I'll probably end up taking you up on it after I play tonight!
---
I feel like I should be able to wiggle the entire time the killer's hook bar is filling. If I fill my bar before he fills his, I win.
---
‚ÄúFucking shitty camper stupid fucking tunneler hope you die drowning in a toilet bowl‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThanks man hope you have a better g-‚Äú
---
Blendette has left the chat
---
Myers isn't human, he is evil
---
As someone who plays survivor and killer id say the changes were overkill, any killers that complain about needing to hit someone one extra time are just being babies its really not that bad and as survivor it rarely was the difference between me making it out or not, generally either it activates and helps me out in chases, maybe saves me, or doesnt get activated all game so was useless
---
I‚Äôll give you an upvote because of effort but a downvote on your execution.
---
Sorry, bro, yes survivors get favored but I have recently discovered while playing them the last week to avoid shitty queue times that... yeah, it ain‚Äôt as easy as it seems. Unless you‚Äôre abusing bugs like the Wake Up bug in which case fuck off.
---
Maybe that was just the entity checking if you did a pretty good job so far
---
You ever seen ghostface tank like 7 shots to the chest in the movies?
---
This is the AJW perk but backwards name?
---
Good concept though, allowing up to a max of 24% wiggle progression seems pretty viable.
---
Really? I was kinda excited for that minor buff to it when they put it in the [PTB](https://i.imgur.com/GBp9xlF.png), then they just trash it? that sucks.
