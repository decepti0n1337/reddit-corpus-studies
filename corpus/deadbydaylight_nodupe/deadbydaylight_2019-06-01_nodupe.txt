Hell, last night I got fucking tombstoned and it was the first time he saw me. I had been doing gens got 4 done and never even got seen until a useless teammate took him to me. Less than a minute into the chase just as I slammed a pallet on him even while stunned he was able to tombstone me. I had never even been hit by him or injured before I got instantly killed.

---
Noed isn’t a hag perk it’s for everyone.
---
Yeah, the 60 second passive sleeping feels like a bit of a stretch to call it a buff lol.
---
Unfortunately there is no real way for bhvr to prevent that. If people have the ability to be assholes, they're gonna be assholes. When I get tunneled I just do my best to keep the killer busy so my team can make it out.
---
Found a survivor main... Most likely plays on console
---
I meant a problem with the fundamental design of the game. You shouldn't have to rely on a perk to avoid something like spaces the killer can't pass through but survivors can. Things like that are bad game design and should be patched out. Not "fixed" with a perk.
---
I agree about the fact it have to be a challenge, but a challenge is supposed to be completable.
---

---

---
EGC start when the hatch is closed. unless you have a key, forget about it.  
---
Doors are close each others.... I wont mind about it
---
When EGC was announced, they said that we will have 3 minute to escape.... I thought it was fair, but they reduce it to 2 min and now it's impossible, because you have to open a door in 30 seconds. if the killer come, it's over, even if you mind him, you cant escape. And if you manage to avoid him, if he notice you tried to open the door (wit hthe red dot), he gonna camp. So you cant escape since you have to go to the other door and open it. Since the killer will check this other door, you have to change door again and the Entity will catch you before you escape.
---
But.... well, anyway, it was already "the first who find the hach win" before EGC tbh.... i just find that EGC is another method to taunt survivor
---
I can’t imagine genuinely thinking that insidious camping is a problem, or that it’s unfair. 
---
You gotta take the post down. This is all troll stuff, I’m convinced.
---
Thanks! I've been playing killer wrong and kicking every pallet, nearly every time. This will help once I figure it out :)
---
I agree with those changes.
---
Though one idea I had for a rework was for him to essentially function as an alternative to Billy where he moves almost as fast with better turning but he needs to refuel his chainsaw as it has a power meter and he needs to refuel a lockers.
---
Exactly, part of the reason I love playing Freddy since i got him was being invisible and being able to sneak up on people. I won't really her to do that now
---
Yea because the devs can’t counter them... just like why they reduced the number of pallets on a map and changed flashlights and decisive. We already know the devs suck at their own game and they make these changes based on their experiences. So many killers had zero problem with the amount of pallets and instablinds but just because they did they had to change it. You can’t use that as a reason because they don’t change it for any reason other than they can’t play against it.
---
Beautiful.
---
If looping is toxic so is spirit fury+enduring, it’s not.
---
There are no god windows. And the only thing that loses you a match is focusing on one person to much. If you are having issues with people looping you you have the choice to bring in perks that help against that.
---
Turn on the subtitles
---
Freddy went from being an m1 killer with a hindrance of a power to a m1 killer with a gimmicky power. 
---
Either way hes better off without the shackle of waiting for a hit.
---
The comments do
---
Look at it from the perspective of a new/newer player though.
---
In order to get the content this game has to offer, a new player either needs to:
---
A) Pay $93 for the base game and every character.
---
B) Grind up the Shards to unlock each character individually (9k per killer). As a more casual player myself I earn 2k a week, so over a month between each killer. Keep in mind that you then need to grind that killer up in order to get their perks, since you can't spend Shards on Perks without setting your Killer Progress back.
---
Doing this means that it would take you a year to unlock every *killer* in the roster, nevermind the four that come out a year and any survivors you wanted.
---
C) Some combination of the two which could easily combine the expense of the one with the tedium of the other.
---
That's not going into how if you like a Killer but hate their default skin (Legion for me), you'd have to pay shards to get Devil-May-Care Joe or whatever other skin.
---
And **that's** not going into how a ton of killers are incredibly weak without certain perks. You'd have to grind up the shards to get Hag for Hex: Ruin, Spirit for Spirit Fury, and Leatherface for BBQ and Chili if you wanted the most basic of Meta builds; you're looking at nearly four months before you can even *start* putting the build together.
---
Keep in mind that certain Killers also need certain corner case perks as well; Myers wants Bamboozle so you need Clown, Trapper wants Fire Up so you should get Freddy, and a couple of other corner cases like that.
---
Getting into this game as a newcomer is so bad that I have friends who refuse to play unless we're doing KYF; we can't do any sort of perk build without putting in an insane grind to it.
---
Are they in Braille?
---
I mean it's a test build, supposed to be for testing.
---
If Noob3 is toxic, then what does that make Monto?
---
New Dwight outfit
---
I ran into one today, and it was the first in awhile honestly. The entire month of may and I've only been camped twice
---
Yuss
---
I don't think you can. They said you could only stalk survivors one at a time. And if you do stalk multiple it ups the chance you get spotted so it would just be perfered to stalk one by one.
---
 Don't go around assuming. you know what they say about that.
---
my friend gifted it to me and it would be rude to decline.
---
then i put it in favourites so she'd approve :)
---
Same
---
These loops that are better than others are literally just a 45 second stall. It doesn't matter how good or bad the survivor and killer are. There is no mindgame, no alternative. You either run them 3 times around, or abandon them to go after someone else who also goes to the same spot. Repeat. There is no skill involved. T walls are a great example of skill expression. A good survivor can drag out a T wall for a minute if the killer is bad, but if the killer is also skilled he can read them and get a hit within 10 seconds. Loops like that should be the goal. You can run them for minutes, but based on skill level it's also still possible to retaliate.
---
&gt; Use bloodlust and hold W
---
&gt; All gennies done by the time you finally catch up with them.
---
Balanced, as all things should be.
---
It wasn't whoever found the hatch first lol. If the survivor found it first they won, but if the killer found it first you're both locked into waiting until the other side made a move and it was god awful.
---
Yes the situation you're describing is difficult. But if all 3 of your teammates die amd the killer gets to the hatch before you, you should probably be dead. At some point you have to stop getting second chances.
---
It isn’t a problem tho. It requires skill to end a loop. You get rid of loops and what can survivors do to avoid a killer? Be immersive? That’s even more annoying for both parties. Loops are the only method survivors have of delaying or escaping a killer, if killers struggle with that then that’s on them. You can’t change a game because one side “op” when it uses the only thing it actually has to escape the thing designed to kill them. Hence perks. That’s why they keep adding them. It happens in so many games and it works in so many games. Those games don’t change the main focus of their game because people can’t counter it, they made changes to what people can use to counter it yes but that’s it.
---
Nobody is forced to do anything. You're not forced to use bamboozle, but I recommended it because he was complaining about looping. No one is forced to use hex ruin either. You seem to be seeing this one sided. As if survivors had everything going for them and for the killers everything is against them which is completely wrong
---
Maybe it's cause it's unfun for people to deal with. Just because a lot of people don't have a problem with it doesn't mean that most of the rest also don't. High end players will abandon chases in certain areas because one of those loops are there. It can lose some of the best killers matches because they can't chase in one section of the map. It's not just because the devs struggle with them.
---
But even if it is. The devs design the game, they test it; they will be above average so if they're having issues with something, likelihood is that a lot of other players are too.
---

---
Except you literally do not have to participate. At all.
---
I'm confused. What is this?
---
Thank you for all this amazing information and I have another question when I bear trap someone do I leave them be or still hook them am sorry if am asking dumb questions am still very new to the game
---
That's a horrible idea, so if all survivors are there and the killer has no reason to leave they get blinded and are helpless and have to leave, also what if while blind they get stuck like manage to walk into a corner and have no way of telling where they are walking or anything.
---
I was wondering. Was this guy inside that locker for 2 hours?
---
Hello?

thanks huntress, very cool!

Its better to wait for the ptb, they did say some of the stuff are subject to change in the stream.

I KNOW there are gonna be games where Ghostfaces will be tea-bagging with survivors and I'm HERE for it
---
I actually can't even.
---
Change i can get behind.
---
No more asking for permission tonhit survivors.
---
Thank you. 
---
Your idea is interesting, however, it sounds like someone's suggestion for a nerf to Billy. (Not saying you want Billy nerfed.) It's too similar to him and is still a worse version of him.
---
Billy is the ultimate map pressure while bubba (should) be the ultimate insta down. I feel that's what the devs were going for. They're different play styles and (should) be basically opposites im that regard.
---
Who was talking about infinites? Real infinites haven't been in the game for ages. I swear people just like to call any long loops infinites.
---
the internet*
---
It's not toxic, but it's gameplay that's fun for one side and not the other.  It also takes most of the agency out of the killer's hands (unless Nurse or Legion) and basically has killers waiting for survivors to mess up instead of being able to do anything about it.  
---
Good game design would come up with a way for chases to be interactive and dynamic for both parties involved while maintaining an aspect of fun for both killer and survivor where the more skilled player ends up winning.
---
&gt; The Rift.
---
Worth mentioning: This is the battle pass portion of the archives, so we have confirmed plans of adding battlepasses to DBD, people can make of that what they will.
---
Yeah, I'll admit I made this post in haste and regret it, but I'm still not sold on this rework.
---
More or less I'm thrown in a nasty character crisis since Freddy was the only killer I'd really played for a long stretch there, so now it's going to be weird not having his Transition Mindgame and stall.
---
I'm not talking about loops in general. I'm talking specifically about things like God windows. If there's a seriously broken meta build but one perk that's useless otherwise counters it, that's not good design. That should be changed. Otherwise balancing means nothing because you're just rolling a dice with your build.
---
Go back to r/shitpostcrusaders.
---
Exactly. 😉
---
We normally get a survivor and map in the 3 month updates
---
I can’t stop watching this gif
---
What does any of this have to do with Dead By Daylight?
---
They don’t need 14 days to test one character. Companies didn’t use to do this and it’s totally unnecessary, unless they have that little confidence in their infrastructure.
---
&gt;This is a killer main sub.
---
&gt;proceeds to both killer mains
---
&gt; 40+ upvotes
---
Hm
---
It was the only perk that got revealed when ghostface was leaked for the first time. But they ended up scrapping it probably.
---
Imagine actually participating in Twitch chat
---
&gt;There are no god windows
---
Wat.
---
I can think of at least 2 without trying. One on macmillan. One on one of the farm maps.
---
You can say the same thing about all the killer clutch perks. BBQ, NoED, Bamboozle, Tombstone, Hex ruin. The huntress hatchet hit zones. All kinds of lazy things that do not take skill for a killer. Run against high tier killers and they have no issue with loopers or at least the ones I go against don't. Most the the killers I have run against that complained about looping were very underskilled and even then they would not go after anyone but the looper.
---
I’m sorry but have you seen them play? They are not above average. And I disagree with a couple of statements on the high end side of games. Most of the more skilled killers won’t just avoid a loop because they can’t loop it, they’ll go straight to it and remove that loop ASAP (like killer shack). Chase a person there for a full gen but get rid of the pallet and down the person at the same time? Fucking worth it. That can be what wins a game right there. I had never seen a single person say the main aspect of the game wasn’t fun until reading this post. Looping even after this rework will still be in the game, so will flashlights and pallets and survivors can still use them as well as they ever could, if you struggled with them before you still will after. If you don’t find that fun or if others don’t find that fun it won’t change with this rework.
---
My guess is because they said new Freddy will be able to put down fake pallets for sleeping survivors
---
If it makes you feel better i read in Chandler’s voice
---
Who the hell is Bruno and what does this have to do with DbD?
---
Don't thank me, I'm just regurgitating information. Thank OhTofu for this amazing video https://youtu.be/VPr_bQdVkj0?t=322.
---
Obviously its easy to wake up, but it adds time when you regress a gen, or fuck up a heal, or with the new thing spend time doing that instead of a gen.
---
Those cosmetics in the "leaks" were just placeholders. The ones we actually get are going to be new and tie in with the theme of the archives for that time period. I don't understand people like you that go on rants without knowing all the facts.
---
Also, you don't speak for the entire community :)
---
&gt; wow its almost like the game has dailies that does the same thing
---
To be fair, just because the game has dailies that distract players (mostly survivors) from their main goal, it doesn't necessarily make the dailies good design either.
---
Y’all seem to not understand basic English. 
---
Just because my comment got upvotes, it doesn’t negate what I said. 
---
Maybe survivors are vocal when it comes to upvotes and downvotes, but killer mains are the most vocal with commenting, and especially being combative. This has been clear by numerous replies to my comment. Try again though.
---
We dont know how his traps even work. Maybe unlike Trapper or Hag he is able to place them done much quickly since they only work in the dream world. 
---
Speaking of that, the Dream world will be a constant threat, and it will always waste survivors time passively without having to do anything. 
---
Teleporting to any Gen at any point is stupidly strong. 
---
We also have no idea what else he gets from the power.
---
I think the main problem is that you cant mind game at loops, because theres no windows or corners to cut off line of sight. Youre basically just going to get chased until you cant find another pallet.
---
Sounds like something you might want to bring up with Support honestly.
---
Wait they are scrapping the perk entirely and working from scratch?
---
Devs gave bloodlust, because it was literally impossible to catch a survivor on certain loops.

I'm not talking about generic looping. What kind of fucking idiot thinks loops in general are broken? I'm talking about shit like the endless basement or god windows. And high level players absolutely will abandon chases in those areas.
---
Stall was pretty much a gamble since it fully relied on survivors getting a skillcheck wich is a reason why i dont like the current freddy.
---
Yes the stall isngood but it would've been better if it was not controlled by the fucking rng.
---
I get gens done, make rescues and distract the killer by triggering notifications and then vanishing.
---
\- I know that EGC was made for this but it still unbalanced and just gave killer new method to taunt survivors actually (but devs couldn't prevent it, I agree)
---
\- I just put ruin + thanato for example since I saw lot of people complain about it actually
---
\- same thing for NOED. anyway, it's easy to counter : just destroy all unlit totem before finish gen
---
\- Ruin can be a real pain if you are like me : a cursed player who will trigger 50 QTE... and yeah, if the map is the game and if the killer is a traper, you can forget about remove it...
---
For survivors perks :   
---
\- Mettle of man will be revamped (as they said in previous live) to be less OP...
---
\- DS was revamped to be fair for killer and less op for survivors. So less players use it now.
---
\- Adrenaline wont prevent survivor to be downed by NOED... .and it's situationnal : you need to be wounded to use it.
---
That’s what I thought first too but then the next thing they said made me think it’s not four new maps, just four Badham Preschool variations with everything in different spots :(
---
*what the fuck*
---
&gt;Looping itself isn't toxic, however the longer/infinite ones are most definitely utilized the most BY toxic survivors.
---
the person you replied to?
---
Maybe they didn’t scrap it. We might see it in the future. I don’t know though.
---
Nothing happens. I started playing again a few months ago,after not touching the game since 2016/17.
---
Survivors always will passively fall alseep without Freddy having to do anything thus survivors will HAVE to miss skill checks, waste time to find the clock, or wake each other up which wastes time. 
---
The point of it is to make him more powerful while in the dream world but still fuction outside of it, while keeping some ablity to stealth.
---
This is reddit for shitposting. Theres a whole other section for taking shit seriously. You guys can stop white knighting it. If I make a suicide joke I want someone to tell me to kill myself.
---
Ayye
---
They are not god windows they are just better spots that takes a bit more skill for the killer to get the person from. I think they want to rework more survivor stuff they should look into reworking the clutch perks of the killers. I mean they complain about all the survivor loops, pallets, and perks yet they have some pretty hard core clutch perks.
---
Idk who this is but I was using my data so thank you lol
---
Even worse, it only marks one survivors spawn location
---
Oh no he’s rapidly clicking his flashlight he can’t hear the terror radius oh no oh god
---
Thanks for being another shining example of how this subreddit is filled with crybabies.
---
I 2nd that emotion.

"checking out *THE CHAN-CHAN MAN* "
---
I got banned when they looked into my account (guessing thy noticed I abused the p3 glitch, oops lmao) but was assured the cosmetics will be there after the ban is over. ty :)
---
It’s kind of annoying, had this cashier guy been announced as a survivor people would have been up in arms, now because it’s a meme at this point people rush to make him real
---
Nice to hear
---
So how does it works ? do you lose your steam cloud save as it goes to their server or it stays there get migrated and never get touched ever again ? 
---
HAve you got any achievement that randomly popped in without doing anything ?
---
That would be weird. Like what would they switch around? Pallets and generators are already random so..I sure hope you aren’t correct, I don’t want to be spreading false info or hype :/
---
I thought that was the Ghostface trailer cashier lol
---
Hopefully they can come up with something fun and balanced.
---
Thought I'm secretly hoping Ghost's perks are movement based ones to help slower killers like clown
---
They said it’s a 16 second duration with a cooldown.
---
Yeah I don't really understand what sleep does any more. Does Freddy still get auras from it then?
---
I agree, and the suburbany maps are my favorite
---
Yes, you get a mask for both Meg Thomas and The Trapper.
---
Jesus the amount of subs you've posted this in is astounding.
---
I applaud the sadness.
---
well, you waste time with that, so it's actually good for the killer
---
poor Amanda
---
I don't know if this is just the twitch chat, the community showing how it is so toxic, or just people trolling, because either way, I can't find it funny, cause that was a big stream, all people wanted was watch all its content.
---
Windows already have a limit to them? They have counters, it’s called mind games, you don’t need bamboozle to end it I still believe it requires skill. It requires skill to run those loops and it requires skill to end those loops. One survivor fuck up and they die, one killer fuck up and the loop goes on for maybe ten more seconds especially if one window is closed, which is easy to do if you know how to push the survivor where you want them in order to force them through the windows. My point still stands that it’s one of the biggest parts of the game and it’s the only thing survivors can use to get away from a killer, nerf that or remove that and you’ve broken the game. You don’t have to change it to fix the problem. Perks are a fine method of change. I don’t want to go into a game and know that I don’t need to bring certain perks like bamboozle, that just makes the game too easy. It’s like a survivor going into a game knowing they need to bring DS, adren, insta heal, etc because the windows aren’t reliably anymore. You have an issue with one of the main points of the game, maybe don’t play it.
---
I never said this.... that said, that's how they work for some points. As i said : when killer complain, they apply changes.
---
Oh punish the survivor for trying to survive makes sense if you dont think about it.
---
I have a question: How does a battle-pass getting added help the artists get properly compensated, surely we should assume they're getting the same amount of money either way, unless they've stated as such and I missed that memo?
---
Than
---
No idea for the remaining cards but what will you do for suits? Normal suits or special dbd related suits? If they’re dbd related you could do it as dc, escape, killed, and killer(the symbols at the leaderboard where it shows perks, addons, items, killer abiltity, offerings, etc)? There’s four different “outcomes” for a game and each has a simple, small logo which represents it.
---
But Freddy isn't outside of the dreamworld in the movies. He's a *dream demon* who kills in dreams, not some guy who somehow has the ability to make people sleepy.
---
Does Than make you bleed more as well or no?
---
:thinking:
---
When you Reverse Bear Trap (RBT) someone, you don't want to chase them, but you don't want to just leave them alone either.
---
When a Survivor has a RBT on their head, they have two and a half minutes after a generator is completed to take it off or be instantly killed. This creates a slight sense of urgency especially as it gets closer to the deadline, and it forces the Survivor to take the trap off  or get kicked out of the game, and the most points a Survivor gets is escaping.
---
As a Killer, you have two primary jobs; keep survivors off gens, and kill said Survivors. A Survivor trying to take his RBT off isn't on a Generator, so he's not progressing the game. Also keep in mind that if you have a Survivor with a RBT on their head and are chasing that survivor you've kept one survivor off the gens, going up to two survivors when someone comes to pick him up off the hook. If you've got a Survivor with a RBT on their head, are chasing another survivor, down and hook that second one, then a *third* survivor has to come and pull him off the hook. You've tied up more survivors for longer.
---
What's more when a Survivor is Hooked, Downed, or being Chased their timer pauses, so instead of dying in 2.5 minutes it might take them 5 or so minutes if you chase them long enough.
---
Having said that, if you round the corner into an injured survivor with a RBT on their head, or the first person you find after they get unhooked is said survivor using a Gideon Box, by all means down them and hook them. They may get the RBT off and you'll have to d o it the old fashion way.
---
32
---
I play consisten4ly with  a 120 ping to the killer,because I won't find any better lobbies.
---
Regards to adrenaline, it actucates upon powering of the exit gates, you still recieve the boost regardless of state. I don't keep up with the live streams because live streams bore me. I think killers are getting buffed because the perks are situational and it doesn't take much for a set up to crumble. 
---
Tbh Idk why they revamped NOED, it doesnt make sense and it was fine as it was. 
---
Trapper is a weak killer and to be honest i suck with ruin skill checks. But I also play killer, as long as it remain crutch in meta, it will be combined with other perks.
---
What about shirtless David?
---
Yeah but you see, some perks are just better perks that take a bit more skill from the survivor to beat the killer that's using them. /s 
---
I never said a word about clutch perks. I said some loops are broken. They're the ones being addressed. It's a good thing.
---
I’ve been running a swf with some new players and it’s way more fun than i imagined. I met them on discord and we played a bit last night. Even against killer i usually hate(fucking clowns, man. They terrify me) we had a shit ton of fun.
---
\&gt;the chance at getting a 4K.
---
implying theres a chance if 1-2 survivors know how to abuse broken game mechanics LUL
---
So because there is a vocal MINORITY of people on this sub, that automatically means they own it?  Lol, nope, try again kiddo.  Majority of people on this sub are definitely survivor players.
---
Not really, your not suppose to be able to go from window to window, pallet to pallet is fine but when survivors go window to window on coldwind bloodlust forces them to use a pallet or juke the killer.
---
Yes but he has been taken out of the dream world plenty of times in the movies and had to act in the real world.
---
I never said they own it, kiddo. Maybe come back and comment when you learn how to comprehend what you read.
---
Don't play shit like prayer beads and a mori then jackass.
---
But he is primarily a dream demon. Not some guy who's outside of the dreamworld.
---
That's how it works in Korea.
---
Better stay awake like a methhead !
---
LOL, Dude same with window loops some window loops are just better than others and takes a bit more skill to beat the survivor using them.
---
On PC leaving the game doesn't depip you anymore as survivor
---
Don’t cry about it.
---
My thoughts exactly bro lmao
---
I never said they own it, kiddo. Maybe come back and comment when you learn how to comprehend what you read. Killer mains are so touchy. Lmao
---
Nea and the pussycats
---
so we just gonna ignore the rank 16
---
Thanks!
---
Yes. Please.
---
Boomers rising up.
---
it seems being in micro nap state punishes you more since you can't keep track of freddy while full on sleep lets you see him from far away
---
Yeah I'm gonna cry about how you are a crybaby. Good comeback.
---
rip, but yeah good point
---
Damn, still crying?
---
Gain advantage is not a problem, but if survivors is left with nothing to fight the killer, there's no need to play survivor anymore since they can't win.
---
Loop weren't op and there was a lot of counter for killers : they learned how to mind, they had som perks to help.... and in the worst case, they just had to break pallet so no loop anymore, even if they lost survivor.
---
I know that killer is supposed to be powerful, to be a real menace for survivors, but since the begining, there was a lot of adjustment who nerf survivors. some were fair (infinite vault), some of them.... understandable (DS), some understandable (mettle of man) but... I mean, there was so little adjustment to nerf killers ! 
---
So I'll say what I mean once and for all, clearly : if devs keep going against survivors, there soon will have no fun to play survivors, so nobody wont play survivor anymore since the only fun role is killer....
---
Who said I do that? I just don’t consider what he’s describing as toxic.
---
I love how this is the same as someone saying “Just break the pallet” in response to ridiculously safe loops, but gets way more downvoted.
---
Are you reading my comments before replying? I'm not talking about loops in general. I'm talking about *god windows* about loops that have no mind games, loops that have two options when faced with them: chase the survivor till they run around half a building and through a window 3 times for the next 3 minutes or abandon the chase.
---
Didn't survivors complain about body blocking in the basement? Seems like that got addressed...
---
A lot of people here complain about general loops being broken and window loops are also... general loops. They are easy to counter, they aren’t infinite, and one survivor fuck up and you’ve won. High level players do not abandon those, in fact we love it when a survivor goes to them coz it should be an easy chase. Listen if you don’t know how to mind game that’s fine, but I will say bring certain perks tho, coz I’m not gonna change the main aspect of a game for the people who don’t know how to mind game. Learn it. It’s actually quite simple. If you can’t get it then don’t play killer or bring other perks to help you. But we change so much already for the bad players (saying bad, not new, coz some people have thousands of hours and still can’t do basic stuff) that I’m taking a stand for survivors to keep the only thing they really have to stay away from killers. Window loops are general loops and they are way easier to end than pallet loops.
---
Actually it wasn't scrapped it was just renamed.
---
at the same time if they can distract the killer and delete the NOED then they can potentially all escape. happens plenty.
---
It doesn't take skill to run a god window, that's the point of them.
---
Nope. Camping sucks and isn’t fun for anybody.
---
I mean they are adding more pallets to compensate for the shorter loops so technically this is worse. I’ll just go from loop to loop until I need to throw down a pallet. As killer I’m gonna have a harder time though
---
oh boy having to lose the first 50-100 games to get all the broken-op meta perks is such good gameplay!
---
Sloppy is 10000 times better.
---
Acting like the devs only do things for killers shows how biased you are
---
100%
---
Except no one said cosmetics were pay2win.
---
All I can see from dbd reddit is that killers want the gamer made easier for them.. I've heard from actual killer mains that being a killer is as easy as it as ever been.
---
&gt;We normally get a survivor and map in the 3 month updates
---
Technically we already got a survivor (Ash), now we will get the killer and they are giving us a map rework before the next chapter, which would be the "new map". 
---
Chapter 13 will go back to the old formula, introduce a new map and hopefully killer + survivor.
---
Apparently it does because killers always bitch about them.
---
Oh it was. My bad, ill edit my original post
---
You got a point, even if the official reason was "it could be a way to take the game in hostage".... and some killers toke the game in hostage with this.... now give me more counter examples where devs heard survivors ?
---
The amount of people in the twitch chat chanting it had me baffled.
---
Play to pay
---
No.
---
WAZZZ UPPPPP!!!!
---
.... wait what ? you serious ? when did they changed this ?
---
Idk do you play survivor at all?
---
It‘s actually kind of cute lol
---
Yeah, you're actually just ignoring half my reply now so I'm just going to be dismissive too.
---
God windows cannot be mind gamed. These are the windows being addressed.
---
Most windows can be mind gamed. These are being left as is.
---
I am reading them hence why in my reply it was all directed at Windows. Would you like me to sit here and explain exactly how to mind game window loops? Because they have them. Do your chases go like this: find survivor, survivor jumps through window leading to nowhere useful for them so I vault window, they run around the building back to the same window and vault it, so I follow, by this point in time I have bloodlust, oh shit they did the exact same thing again and I have more bloodlust, abandon chase. If it goes anything similar like that then holy shit. There’s no way I’m gonna listen to your points anymore. Also considering if they run through it 3 times it would be blocked off.
---
Yeah in twitch chat
---
You're the one that got all touchy and offended by my original post literally responding with "Hm" to what you said.  Literally "Hm" and you come out swinging like I fucked your mother.  And I'm touchy?  Lol, okay, take a look in the mirror.  Survivor mains are the majority.  The votes show it.  The sheer amount of crying on this sub about NOED and camping is enough to not take your statement about killer mains being the "vocal majority" seriously.
---
1. hit dwight
---
2. dwight gets magical speedboost
---
3. dwight uses movement perk
---
4. dwight loops and pallets until all gens done or killer gives up
---
imo game should automatically end when 3 survivors are dead as its impossible to kill all 4 with the dogshit hatch mechanic
---
inb4 normie surv mains downvote, go kys
---
No, high skilled players got tired of complaining about them about 2 years ago.
---
Lmao you’re trolling me and you’re not even good at it, buddy. Try harder next time. 🤗
---
Discordance is going to be a must have on future Freddy. Being able to disrupt two survivors at the cost of nothing will be amazing
---
Oh god its prayer bead spirit 2.0
---
Yes, they may be getting the same as before but this is a way to sustain the longevity of the game and content.
---
Me: States facts
---
&gt;"Lmao you’re trolling me and you’re not even good at it, buddy."
---
Okay
---
Oh, right. So if you evade detection, you're allowing the gen to be locked out. Well, could be interesting. I wonder if you could combine it with Corrupt Intervention to be able to challenge all gens in the early game.
---
This happens the other way around too, when killers disconnect (doesn't happen a lot) but yeah, they are going to try to address it.
---
If you think “god” Windows can’t be mind gamed then this rework won’t help you. No perks will help you. You shouldn’t play killer anymore because this is literally a git gud scenario. You’re one of the few people who play this game for a while and still can’t learn. I won’t cater my gaming experience to you.
---
Yeah it'll be gone once thats over, I did that before then the free thing was up mask was gone. You have to buy death garden to keep it.
---
You still haven’t done a better job...still can’t comprehend what you read? 😩
---
they have multiple ways to work against campign (not when the gens are done ofc): making the hook timer go down slower if killer is close and not in chase. This could be a main thing, because that would give time to check the hook and go back to doing gens and actually getting them done. Making Kindred default to survirvors. DS should recharg if the killer camps for 30 seconds, so you can actually get more chances.
---
And they should do it in a way that camping killers should never get a win and a pip. "you want to be toxic? we cannot reward you then."
---
Yes, but being outside the Dream world does in fact fit him. Hes a normal guy when outside it but becomes more powerful while inside it, excalty like the new power works.
---
High quality facial animations
---
As a legion main, I agree.
---
Honestly, speed boost is not really interesting for me : I can go as fast as I want, if doors are not open before the killer come, speed wont help me. Trapper is powerfull if you know how to play him : if you manage to keep 3 gens safe (close each others of course), you won since you just have to watch them and push survivors to panic. And of course put a trap in front of ruin totem.
---
It might cost a lot of money fighting it, is the point.
---
People still think doc is annoying.
---
\&gt;killer has to break it or they will literally never catch you. 
---
this is why i camp hooks every game with insidious or someshit, i dont give a fuck about trying to play normally when survivors always win and even then they stay at gate to waste more time
---
Found a killer main... Most likely echoes the opinions of other killer mains and contributes nothing to most dbd discussions.
---
Like everything Legion related.
---
I can comprehend just fine.  You saying that "I can't comprehend what I read" doesn't make it true.  I've understood everything you've said thus far, and with every response I'm beginning to understand more and more what a frothing-at-the-mouth individual I'm dealing with.  You must really care about this game a lot.
---
It's possible it'll be Pinhead
---
Yeah he is , and I get it.  It is just easy to get a ton of bp on him.
---
Gameplay being engaging and fun is far more important than strict accuracy to the movies.
---
*laughs in Fortnite*
---
Oh my gosh. You’re still here and still don’t seem to comprehend anything you have read. 😟
---
He deffinately should be crouch spamming
---
That's what I yelled out!!
---
Yeah but good survivors know what to anticipate, i think its unfair for survivors to be given crutch perks and good items (IMO) and then have killers who have to go against that with no help. The initial speed boost from adrenaline comes in crutch because you can lose a killer
---
WAZAAAAPPPP!!!!!!!
---
I'm assuming Ghostface can? Haven't been able to see any new info yet.
---
Yea, non-killer basement house is known as infinite house to some. It is in Haddonfield and Preschool.
---
Nothing. With add-ons you can see auras for a few seconds if they're close enough
---
Summer could be Southern Hemisphere which is December for us.
---
Only useful with addons
---
Fair, I don't know all the new ones.
---
How much can you get per game with the doc?
---
I appreciate that kind of response and thought
---
i’M aLrEaDy wiNsToN.
---
the item alone is useless, its only useful with add ons like gold token and prayer beads letting you see survivors auras
---
Mobile version???
---
Except if they didn't have anything on the other side then they wouldn't be a problem. It's more like this:
---
&gt; survivor vaults window
---
&gt; killer vaults window
---
&gt; chase round building
---
&gt; killer gains bloodlust
---
&gt; repeat 2 more times
---
&gt; window seals
---
&gt; survivor runs to pallet loop nearby
---
&gt; drops pallet on killer like any other pallet loop
---
&gt; killer loses bloodlust
---
&gt; last 3 minutes wasted
---
Which is why Good killers usually chase it like this
---
&gt; killer recognises window and abandons chase.
---
Unless they're playing nurse in which case it's
---
&gt; survivor breathes
---
&gt; nurse moris survivor
---
Tell your stepdad "hi", Tyler.
---
&gt; We dont know how his traps even work. Maybe unlike Trapper or Hag he is able to place them done much quickly since they only work in the dream world.
---
A trap that's only effective half the time isn't as good as a trap active all the time.
---
Also keep in mind that people constantly complain that one of Freddy's biggest weaknesses is how easy it is to get out of the Dream World, and they've made it easier on several accounts with this rework.
---
&gt; Speaking of that, the Dream world will be a constant threat, and it will always waste survivors time passively without having to do anything.
---
It was always doing that if you took Range and Skill Check reduction addons. Now it wastes less time for the same reason The Plague's power doesn't quite work; even if the Plague knows where you are, she's still highly loopable even if you're broken.
---
Freddy lost his passive slow down of the game while in dream world. That's a huge hit to his viability, especially if they want you to run around placing traps; even if he places traps instantly you still have to travel there and get to the place you want to set up. Traps that are only viable half the time, mind.
---
&gt; Teleporting to any Gen at any point is stupidly strong.
---
It's really not. 
---
Nurse, Spirit, and Billy apply pressure through fast movement and the ability to get anywhere quickly with their abilities. The key word being *anywhere*. If Freddy hooks someone in the basement and there are no generators nearby, **he can't teleport to protect the unhook**. If he hooks someone even decently distant from a Generator, Survivors can just look at it, see the blood, and run away. 5 seconds head start, followed by Lithe, followed by a potential Decisive Strike, followed by a couple of loops is enough for 2-3 gens to pop at high levels.
---
And that's not even going into how horrible generator placement can disrupt his power. Say the top generator at The Thompson House.
---
&gt; We also have no idea what else he gets from the power.
---
He's going to get pallets that are dead give-aways if you only see them in the dream world or a trap that doesn't actually stop survivors. 
---
Play the Clown, walk around to various loops, and designate a spot on each of them before going after the Survivors. You can only throw a Tonic at that dedicated spot when a Survivor loops you there. Congrats, you now know how horrible those traps are going to be.
---
Why is he so chonky
---
Well yeah that's twitch chat for ya
---
The update before the most recent one. It'll show you lost pips and rank but when you get off dbd then get back on dbd your pips from dc come back
---
That's not great idea. Buffing stealth isn't a nurse nerf directly, and for good nurses it probably doesn't matter. However, by buffing stealth you nerf all killers that are unable to handle stealth (Doc, Legion, probably some others).
---
Oh, you're just cheap. Okay I understand carry one. Should have said that from the beginning.
---
So you're defending it?
---
It's not, just bad gameplay for both sides. With a map rework comes other alternatives that can be more fun and engaging. Imagine a map with more places to hide, more corners to try losing the killers and maybe new ways to create some distance that doesn't involve running in a circle repeatably.
---
I was gonna say he is Hag 2, but you were faster :'(
---
Ya still can’t comprehend what you read. How embarrassing for you.
---
Could you Also tell me some other good perks to run on Amanda?
---
Yeah, killers nowadays are just straight up spoiled babies who demand to get kills handed to them.
---
Er, no. The license holders allow BHVR to use Freddy on the condition that he's accurate to the movies. Being able to walk around outside of the dreamworld is not accurate to the movies.
---
I’m sure the back wall has an opening and they were able to just walk through it right before they jumped out.
---
Oh I see what you mean. But I would say the same thing about being on hook, you sit there hoping the killer doesn’t camp you and that someone comes to help you.
---
Go on then, how do you mind game them. Let's go with the macmillan god window.
---
If you read the roadmap, it’s over the year.
---
Honestly not sure its been a while since I played.  I know in the past I could earn more in a bad game as him than a 4k as a different killer ( I also play the hundreds, clown, Myers, and the pig).
---
Win or lose, I never earn a lot of bp when I play survivor lol.
---
And David does........ things.....
---
You can’t catch up to them with bloodlust 3 times? Bullshit. Do you know how fast bloodlust is? They shouldn’t make it to vault it a 3rd time. Killers do not abandon that chase idk where tf you get that from.
---
Did you seriously just say that Doctor is unable to handle stealth????????????????????
---
60 seconds isn't much for an addon though, since by the time you hit a 2nd person half that time is gone.
---
Nope, that’s patently false. This is an overwhelmingly killer main sub.
---
People still camp with these changes implemented and would still camp and tunnel. It would make it more of a detriment but a majority of the people who do that will not be hindered by it. They will keep on doing it, unfortunately. I'd be up for some changes though. Especially Kindred as base kit, which is something I've been interested in for awhile now. But I don't think it will ultimately solve the problem.
---
If they removed bloodlust than the small loops become a problem.
---
Yup, bought the game and expected I'd stopped paying for it there but you're right. Pay to win games are the best, let's just turn dbd into one of those.
---
Eh, Adam has a very noticeable white jacket but you can buy a black one. That is unfair to say the least. I wouldn’t put them past it do to more stuff like that.
---
Ok, let me explain
---
Survivors always try to help each other for 2 reason
---
official reason : this is a cooperation game, you need each others to have more chance to survive
---
officious reason : 1 500 points.
---
When you know this, insidious camping is the better way to gain some free kill : wait for survivor who will unhook his teamate, grab him, put him on a near hook wait for the next dumb survivor. who will - of course - come try to save his teamates. it work better in basement. you can watch angrypug play like this often, with his insidious leatherface. It's fun to watch... less fun to live.
---
of course, there is some counter like kindred or the "signal" or.... just suicide on hook but.... pallet loop had also counters.
---
that's troll stuff if you want, but I'm still convinced that devs just not give a damn about survivor game experience
---
Don’t forget you have to be running “Tampered Timer” and “Jigsaw’s Sketch”.  Because it ain’t one of Amada’s games if you’re playing fair.
---
Ya sure lol.
---
Not a joke, it really is. It’s crazy to suggest otherwise.
---
Today's Dev stream confirmed the PTB for Tuesday and release for the 18th.
---
Win to Pay
---
Froody
---
You're hilarious friendo. Watch some high level killers play.
---
It fucking disappoints you when you open a chest.
---
We dont know how the traps will work in a loop. It could be like clown bottles in a loop for all we know. 
---
The differnce is, survivors will be forced to wake up and we dont know what other effects there are of the dream world. 
---
Yes and Nurse Billy and Spirit dont have any else in there power. Freddy has this with built in Stealth, traps and pallets, and teleporting, and whatever other effect the dream world will do.
---
Killers on this sub tend to be a bit...soft.
---
I was thinking more because the killer moves faster than the survivor and I'm trying to get away with no pallet/window/ledge I can jump off in sight.
---
I don't stream and try not to be a dick.
---
With double points all the time we'd have ebony moris and broken add ons every game, no thanks.
---
&gt;prestige 
---
Prestieging is a part of the grind, it is meant to take time.
---
Kaaay...a bit unnecessarily harsh
---
I didn't see anything. Kind of like when I play as killer
---
never noticed it.... that's just dumb, since it will give more reason for RQ...
---
Fair question. I'm not in the industry so I'm not a reliable source, but I know very well game artists are working all the time, sometimes companies even get freelance game artists to work on their game on cosmetics or concept designs even if not on the payroll of the company. That being said you're asking about the artists in behaviour's payroll, those artists are also always working on designs and assets, some of which don't make it to the game (R.I.P bunnyfeng).  Cosmetics help mostly by giving the company income to pay the staff including artists, as well as probably royalties being paid for the licenced killers. In addition once a cosmetic is added to the game the artist credited can add it to their work portfolio, which in the competitive art industry is a huge help when trying to make your work known and get better job opportunities on the side.
---
For real, people in this game should use their minds to get away from the killer. Im glad they are going to remove safe looping.
---
Nice, can't wait!
---
I would always pick Sloppy over Thana.
---
Whys
---
From what I know they’re going to reduce large loops (so safe loops) and increase more small loops on the maps (so unsafe loops).
---
Idk if this is correct though
---
We want an intense chase, being outsmarted, you hiding somewhere and not sure if well find you or not.
---
Imagine if it was a movie. Man watching go in circles for 20 minutes would be pretty boring. Its not Nascar
---
There's no way Dwight was not modeled after him.
---
Grab a juice box and take a nap little guy, you’ll feel right as rain after.
---
the point is that people would rather have nothing than having a batterpass is beyond me. If you don't like it, just ignore it, and you are still getting free stuff btw. Why would not having it be better than having it? Why are people so mad about battlepass? No one is forcing you to pay and Developers got bills to pay. This is a win win for everyone.
---
I must of missed the cofirmed part but i knew the release date was the 18th. Now im excited.
---
I never played freddy but im also hyped for the rework, ill get freddy in a few days and try him out.
---
Well... I think it depend to how you want to play your survivor anyway. I'm not a big fan of adrenaline. I take if I dont have auto-heal for my survivor because it's a free heal for late game but that's all. I try to stay away from the killer as much as i can.
---
Insidious camping loses the game for killer if the survivors aren’t braindead. 
---
But I’m going to take this all as troll stuff. 
---
Either that, or pug spews some serious bullshit about the survivor experience since you watch him enough. 
---
And I know pug frequently says that survivors are better so.
---
&gt;This sub isn't a killer main sub. Say something like: "MoM is balanced" and people will gift you gold, talk about "Noed being balanced because it has legit counter play" and people will downvote you into oblivion.
---
I assume you definitely weren't here when they nerfed DS. Oh and theres plenty of NOED activists in this sub, you have no idea
---
Me and my friends play casually in swf and only sweat against each other in kwf so I dont really care.though I feel like theve done enough for looping.
---
There are multiple Macmillan maps which one? Regardless any window including “god” windows. I’ll address the mind game and just the aggressive play coz both work extremely well. Force them through it the 3 times, which is easy especially if they have to run around to get back to the window. Forcing would be aggressiveness, don’t back away from anything and try and mind game by being like “oh gonna hit you, oh wait na I’m going to get you on the other side!” Coz the survivor will just stand there. You stay on their ass. They either block the window or you hit them. If you need to mind game that’s when you hide the stain. But don’t just lunge coz you think they are still standing there, coz that just gives them more time if they weren’t standing there. If you come back around and see they are still there then you lunge through the window and get the hit or you are right behind them and can hit them before they do anything. You have bloodlust tier one at least by this point. They aren’t escaping you even if they run from the windows.
---
There's a double blood point event from the 14th until the 18th too, if I remember the dates correctly.
---
They’re both toxic.
---
\*Staring Intensifies!
---
I don't think the rework will be available until the 18th at the earliest unless you have the Ptb
---
Killers aren’t here to be rational, they just want their 4K with no real effort.
---
Ikr. He looked so cute in that outfit.
---
Yea I do. I also am them. I also play against them. You’re the one who thinks “god” Windows even exist and that you can’t counter them.
---
I like to pretend that he didn’t step in during cuts and was just sitting in the locker for 3 full hours
---
Yes
---
I will never understand the people who use broad generalizations and think it only applies to this very specific community.
---
Have y'all ever played league or overwatch before?
---
You should maybe try and actually read what he said. There are some tiles which are too strong and even a survivor with minimal skill can waste so much of a killer's time. The guy even gave some examples which tiles he thinks are broken.  You just chose to ignore them and decided to go full on virtue signaling because you can get rid of random debris loop. Go you!
---
I tend to run a perk build that anticipates that the killer is gonna find me but tbh I don't use dlc perks on survivors. Usually lithe, hope, adrenaline and self care
---
To clarify, he isn't confirmed, *per se*
---
It's likely, however, as leaks from a while ago claimed that Spawn would be in game, which has turned out to be true. The same leak claimed that Ash would be in the game. As well as this, a chainsaw can be heard at the end of the Kombat Pass trailer.
---
Despite this, however, Bruce Campbell said not long ago that Ash wouldn't be in MK11. We can only wait and see.
---
the you fit into the Otherwise catagory, we typically dont mori you unless we need a quick advantage but if you're a dick your definately getting mori'd and if you have .TTV in your username you will have a mori reserved for you and you alone
---
To be honest the only real tweaks that The Game needs in my mind is more staircases to the upper floors and less places to exploit Balanced Landing with. Also John needs to install some goddamn lights I can't see 3 feet in front of me on the bottom floor.
---
Dr.eggman: FINALY A WORTHY OPONENT. OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY!
---
Play clown with exhausted addons lol jk
---
Why would you ever read any twitch chat?
---
This.
---
Oof.
---
yeah, too... anyway, Legion could kill the game if they did nothing about him (he still broken, but more manageable for survivors that said)
---
Emperor Ghost 😂...The Architect? I don't know. I'm sucking it up. I complained earlier but Ghostface will always be my sweet baby ❤. We need to form a group.
---
Harder to discern exact location (lullaby instead of heartbeat)
---
Dream pallets and dream snares only work on sleeping survivors.
---
Considering that they said it would (granted, it's not a final time) take about 60 seconds to go into the dream state, one failed skill check isn't that much of a set back.
---
I just got myers but i dont know his builds and how to pkay him.
---
Because he gave a very vague example of the areas. Ironworks, ok which part? That window that has a pallet on the outside? Oh yea. Force that pallet down and break it, like I said. Pantry? All those windows upstairs and downstairs with the pallets? Windows are easy. Survivors can’t loop them for long. The pallets? Oh yea... force them down with aggressiveness. Survivors with minimal skill cannot loop well at all. Especially at Windows and they often drop the pallets too early so you won’t even get stunned.
---
Ochido fans tbh
---
The twitch community is one of the most toxic communities I’ve ever seen, the second the Chinese girl opened her mouth the chat flooded with “English only :LUL:”
---
absolutely ridiculous
---
Yes please!
---
Im sorry for the downvotes on this comment survivors can get 3 gens done before first hook stage even ends plus bt
---
He had to have been saying that to cause a ruse. What other pop culture icon uses a chainsaw that could fit in Mk?
---
Yeah. You just don't know what you're talking about. Walking in a straight line at a survivor isn't mind gaming. Mind gaming is things like moonwalking or reversing around a corner with bubba's chainsaw. It's things like chasing a survivor towards something you want to keep them away from so they try to go the other way. It's not just running a loop without stopping. If you run a god window (coal tower I think has the one I'm on about but I'm never sure. The factory building with the upper floor and the steps outside) by following the survivor (which is the only way you can run it because of how wide a loop it is) then you're just wasting far too much time.
---
Like the bubba, I ran into last night that as soon as we busted Noed just DCed out before we even were able to get the gates open. Funny thing was he even brought in Bloody Streamers lol. He was a pretty high Tier killer too rank 5 I think.
---
Please don’t say BBQ is a crutch perk when most use it for the blood point gains
---
Agreed.
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree with you. It's just that nothing is concrete until it's confirmed.
---
Bagilly
---
Bloodhound isn't really needed once you get better at tracking because just the normal blood is enough, sloppy is a good perk but for wraith I'd probably just run the standard killer build of BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury, Enduring because besides the first hit stuff and his add-ons he's a m1 killer
---
They showed an overhead view on the stream showing two different versions where the school was on a completely different side of the map, I’m worried that’s all they meant
---
Maybe at this point survivors should just start off injured or in the dying state? Maybe then  the game will be truly balanced /s
---
I swear every update the survivor (or atleast the solo) experience becomes more and more tedious.
---
calm spirit dwight
---
It is about as much of a clutch perk as decisive was.
---
The way that they explained it was that whether you went the free route or the paid route you had to still play the game to unlock the rewards. Paying just gives you other things that the free tier does not.
---
You're stretching too far. Freddy being in the entity's realm isn't accurate to the movies so your effort is moot.
---
Gameplay comes before lore accuracy.
---
Technically Amanda died but she's in the entities realm...
---
The wraith isn’t very good in high tiers period. That combo isn’t bad though. 
---
Enduring/ spirit fury combo is great on most killers especially ones that have nothing to help in a chase.
---
Oh alrighty, just mad kids
---
Well if that’s true, hopefully it’ll feel varied enough.
---
Would be great if they could stop assuming I never play killer when I bring up something that would improve survivor gameplay. :/
---
yes, we can see, you attacked the playerbase on a feeling and dismiss every information that says that twitch chat is toxic on all games.
---
Doesn’t the fact that these all even *existed* already show the game is (or was) more sided to the survivors?
---
2nd chance perks, pallets, flashlights...the killers had to complain to get something done, while these benefits were just handed to the survivors.
---
That’s literally still in hot. At least wait a little bit to repost.

Flair checks out

RISE FROM THE ASHES FREDDY MAINS
---
ITS PRIME TIME
---
I'm sure whatever we get will be great, but that's a little disappointing. I love the full chapters. It doesn't feel like a real DLC without the map and survivor.
---
Yeah I looked at his power again and realised something worse
---
It takes 60 seconds to fall asleep
---
So if you wake up you're immune to Freddy's chase powers for a full minute.
---
This alone makes him far far weaker than old Freddy ever was.
---
60 second Fedora Man Bad
---
Just keep working on the generator when someone gets downed and you’re fine. Also this is gonna be hilarious on Jumpscare Myers.
---
So I really need to start levelling all my killers to get the teachable perks? M1 killer???
---
I actually said the first bit wasn’t mind gaming so thanks for reading my comment. Hiding your stain isn’t moonwalking? Alrighty mate. I didn’t address any specific killers there so the bubba one is irrelevant coz we were just talking in general. You don’t chase survivors away from things, they immediately run to where they want to be and you have to force them to go where you want from that point on. Ironworks of misery I believe is the map, coal tower is the smaller one with two windows downstairs and one is normally blocked off. I was also thinking of that very loop when I addressed your other comment and said bullshit you can’t catch them with bloodlust. Because bullshit you can’t.
---
And you think letting a survivor loop you is countering them so it's a perfect fit for an argument eh?
---
Ok buddy then tell me how you outplay the Badham Preschool basement. That should be specific enough even for you. And this time actually give it some effort, because so far you have just said "just make them drop the pallet 4head"
---
General Good Perks:
---
- **Whispers**: As discussed above.
---
- **Nurse's Calling**: When a Survivor is healing within 28m, you see their aura. This allows you to crouch and sneak up on them for an easy ambush.
---
- **Spirit Fury** + **Enduring**: Allows you to play really aggressive around pallets (Enduring: Reduces Stun time from pallets by 75%, Spirit Fury: After breaking 2 pallets, the next pallet dropped on you automatically breaks. You're still stunned). These two are pretty core for most M1 Killers like Pig.
---
- **Hex: Ruin**: Any skillcheck that isn't a Great Skill Check regresses the generator, giving you more time to find survivors.
---
- **Hex: Huntress Lullaby**: A free (on PC) version of Hex: Ruin once you level the Huntress. Gives Survivors less notification for skillchecks per token, at five tokens they receive no notifications at all. This makes them less likely to notice you sneaking up on them.
---
- **Monitor and Abuse**: Gives you slightly longer to pull Survivors off the generators, but pairs extremely nicely with Whispers  since you have more time to notice it before they hear your Terror Radius.
---
- **Play with your Food**: Pop the RBT on the Obsession, now every time you run into them you just let them go while they chase down the right box. Grants you an easy speed boost for getting the other survivors and if luck is with you, you have a general idea of where the Obsession is anyway.
---
Perks to Avoid:
---
- Anything to do with Stealth, including **Insidious**, **Tinkerer**, or **Dark Devotion**: Pig has a much better version with her Crouch built in.
---
- Anything to do with Terror Radius, including **Overwhelming Presence**: Pig should be approaching people while crouched, so she shouldn't get any use out of these. You could maybe make a case for **Coulraphobia** to prevent healing while you get looped, but it's so corner case that it's not worth it.
---

---
I know you didn't ask, but her best add-ons are VHS Tape and Combat Straps, and luckily they're both pretty common. They make her Ambush come out incredibly fast and also give you a faster crouch/uncrouch.
---
You right, we can never trust those sneaky bastards at NR
---
[Twitch chat mods the whole time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dME9qCD9Cs0)
---
They said from now on they are doing two new maps (by this I think they meant realms) and two map reworks per year.  They seem to be staggering them in year 4.
---
yall do realize all the endgame thing did was make it where you couldnt trap someone and make it a guaranteed kill, if you're one of the people complaining about it, it just shows that you aren't a good enough pig player to utilize her dash to get kills and instead have to rely on endgame cheesing. Just sayin tho most actual good pigs wern't affected by it, only the noed babies
---
I realsied something worse
---
And his chase power is tied to being asleep
---
So if you happen to wake up before he engages you, he's a 115 killer with no power until you fall asleep again.
---
In my eyes this makes him far far worse than old Freddy
---
60 second Fedora Man bad
---
OP: Survivors are stupid childish idiots.
---
Also OP: Killer main
---
He’s the same hatch king he’s always been and always will be
---
Crutch*
---
See I've tried the so called high tier killers like nurse, spirit and Myers and I just don't do well at all,however with wraith I regularly kill the entire team. And especially spirit,her abilit just seems like short term invisibility that can only be activated once the meter is full but wraith can go invisible all the time? Am I missing something with spirit?
---
Oh don't worry, they deserve the comment. It's something they said to me a while ago when I made a very good point and they got mad.
---
Maybe because he’s been banned twice at this point.
---
But I could also play Dead by Daylight!
---
... Being absolutely serious, I don't play shooters on pc, so I need to wait for this one to eventually hit console if it ever does.
---
i love how killer can decide to depip somebody the same way, it's incredible.
---
And its only helpful in a chase if they happen to be asleep.
---
If they wake up before you enage them they get up to a full minute immune to your snares and pallets
---
You always forgive a shirtless David. No exceptions.
---
Just drop it bro, I took a look at her twitch and of course she is a claudette player who hides in a corner. There's nothing to gain here and she has already made it obvious she has absolutely no clue what she's talking about
---
Sorry for the typos, it's late. :P
---
Be aggressive. Don’t pussy out of pallets because a decent survivor will wait until you lunge. If they are standing on the other side hit through it and them drop it. It wastes time yes but getting rid of those pallets is your goal. You don’t outplay all the time, sometimes a survivor might fuck up and you hit them and they also drop the pallet, but you want those pallets gone for end game. Then the loop is completely gone and if you catch another survivor down there you should be able to catch up to them before they make it to the other stairs.
---
They're the Steve Buscemi editions
---
&gt; not good enough 
---
it has 0 fucking thing with "git gud" or being good enough. they're called infinites for a reason, Genius.  even if you fuck off to go deal with someone else. the people who abuse them stick real fucking close and the moment you enter chase with them run right back to them. 
---
Nobody wants to fucking remove window looping you cry baby, they're asking for balanced map so shitlords like you can't abuse a broken design and then crow about how good you are. I can't believe you equate removing infinite loops and making maps balanced with removing looping all together. 
---
&gt;bring in something like bamboozle
---
lol you say that but I bet you're the type of fucking survivor who babyrages when someone suggests that if you don't want to deal with NOED that you should just cleanse totems.
---
I'm no expert either, there's a lot of great builds demonstrated on YouTube. 
---
My only tips are: do not feel like you need to stalking at all costs, and edge the power bar to the tip of hitting tier 3 and then get up close behind a survivor before actually going into tier 3, that way you aren't wasting a lot of time catching that first survivor and have a more time to potentially catch a second while still in tier 3
---
Did you read the recent news about it?  They seem to want to do just that.  David S. Goyer is writing it, and says he’s going to make it very dark.  His track record is hit or miss, but I have confidence it will blow every direct to video sequel out of the water.  It’ll have a budget at least.  I just hope they nab a talented director.
---
Op, it’s confirmed for Tuesday :)
---
Actually, the definition I was using typing Clutch is tight or critical situation
---
Letting a survivor loop me what? Ok now you’re pulling shit out of your ass.
---
could you give an example of the addons? i wasn’t here for their release or updates.
---
I know, i just want to try him out before the rework.
---
smol Claud is best Claud
---
LMAO. If you get looped by a dwight the whole game you should honestly delete the game. Not all of us are insidious wraith gamers you edge lord
---
that dwight got a hot lil bod 👌🏼🥰
---
Meanwhile things that are genuinely overpowered on the side of killers have existed for far longer and still aren't getting addressed (*cough cough Nurse lasted longer than Old DS and Prayer Beads Spirit was here before MOM*)
---
and also rotten fields and torment creek
---
This fucking thread is WWIII
---
I play survivor everyday!! You sound dumb...
---
I've honestly switched to Clown for BP farming. Works just as well if not a little better imo
---
The duck is a parasexual? Want to fuck a parachute?
---
Or you know he left the locker between video transitions
---
It is actually explained, across a few dev streams. Basically, once BHVR got the rights to Elm Street, there was a catch; New Line only allowed them to use stuff from the remake. Dave Richards also went on to say how they narrowed it down to remake Nancy or Quentin- but decided to not go with Nancy as, and this is almost word for word what Dave said, ‘Remake Nancy lacks what the original Nancy had, she isn’t as interesting and we didn’t want to go for Nancy unless it was the one from the original series. Quentin, however, was a much more interesting character to us.’
---
And this is true- new Nancy sucks. And Quentin is the closest the remake has to a good character (except for Freddy, but even then...). So, in short, New Line still want to promote a remake that came out nine years ago which nobody liked and the dev team went for the best possible option for a survivor.
---
Im glad im not the only one.
---
same he had really good voice lines especially when the margwa spawns lol
---
Can we have Canadian Darth Vader as a killer?
---
Yea, I agree with the other guy, worst I've seen from you is call other people "silly little sausages". I'm not a fan of the occasional "Lol, Reddit is so dumb because I found these few comments in a community of 100k+" but that's your opinion and you're entitled to it.
---
But you're definitely an exception to the rule. You've managed to foster an audience with a certain level of politeness and civility. Standard trash talk at times, but without resorting to something similar to what I mentioned above.
---
I'm bad at phrasing it, but there's a difference between
---
* "Ha ha, take that fucker!" when you win an intense chase
---
 and 
---
* "Lol, look at this stupid idiot. Probably is going to tell his mommy on us later. What a fucking loser. Doesn't matter if I win or lose, this guy will never amount to anything in his life"
---
And far too often, I see more of the latter. I'm not even saying Twitch streamers have to be paragons of virtue. But is it so much to ask to remember that we're all playing with and against other people? And not just bots meant for our personal gain.
---
Me too!!! So happy to see more of a story mode. I was very impressed with what they are doing for this year!!!
---
So, just be aggressive and make them drop the pallet, even though they don't have to drop the pallet until after vaulting a window three times, which was exactly the point of overpowered structures. But even though you haven't said ANYTHING you do different, you are this special snowflake who can just magically make them drop the pallet before they have to, got it
---
Glad to know you are this much better than Scottjund and Umbra, who permanently complain about the broken tiles the game has, but I am glad to know it's not a problem for the rank 12 claudette main
---
Ill have to give it a shot, especially if means a less toxic post match experience
---
I wanna suck him dry.
---
Spirit is used more for mind games. Standing still plays her phrasing animation, allowing you to screw with people. Also, she is entirely invisible while phasing, whereas Wraith is only partially. She also can attack straight out of the phase, whereas Wraith has to wait a few seconds.
---
If the killer is dumb enough to stay on someone for five gens thats their own fault. Real talk
---
Since they were talking about the rank rework becoming specific to each killer, (a good trapper ranks up comparative to other trappers skill level) it would be great if you got a cosmetic for said killer upon reaching the highest possible rank. A bit of an incentive to actually do it
---
Killer main downvoting, try getting better.
---
Im so hyped for archives but at the same time scared because I have a feeling that some of them like Meg's are going to be really sad :(
---
Nowadays I'd be surprised if you went start to finish in a match as Doc without a disconnect, so you lose out on the farm potential.
---
Oh joy. Yeah, I'll take your word about their twitch and stop here.
---
So infinite loops were healthy for the game? Bc that's what bloodlust was trying to solve. Before if you knew the infinite spots you would just run to them and if the killer followed you they would lose the game. Of course that means the killer can never actually catch you.
---
And yet, being able to walk out of the dreamworld on his own isn't accurate to the movies. 
---
Lore accuracy comes before gameplay in regards to the *licensed* killers.
---
ash don't give a fuck about anything lmao at least in the serie
---
&gt; We dont know how the traps will work in a loop. It could be like clown bottles in a loop for all we know.
---
The idea they've stated is a Slow. We know how Slows work. It works like Clown's Tonic.
---
&gt; The differnce is, survivors will be forced to wake up and we dont know what other effects there are of the dream world.
---
No they won't. There's no longer a built in Dying Light so that's out the window, so there's no reason to worry about an M1 Killer knowing your location when he's easily loopable.
---
We also do know the other affects of the dream world; Freddy can place traps that don't kill people, or he can place Pallets that people recognize as fake because the weren't there when they were walking through it before. On top of one, ONE, of those, he gets to see your aura if your out of his terror radius. That's the best part of his ability, and it was there before the rework.
---
&gt; Yes and Nurse Billy and Spirit dont have any else in there power. Freddy has this with built in Stealth, traps and pallets, and teleporting, and whatever other effect the dream world will do.
---
Nurse: Literally ignores everything that Survivors have to keep themselves alive. Doesn't do anything with their power.
---
Billy: Instantly downs anyone they hit with their power, along with destroying pallets instantly if the need arises. On top of being an M1 Killer with no downsides. His power doesn't do anything but let him move around.
---
Spirit: Has the easiest time pulling Survivors off of gens/unhooks/pallets because of her ability, along with the mind-games around pallet loops. Doesn't do anything else with her power.
---
Do you even play this game, man?
---
welp
---
The killer is suppose to be able to catch up, they are faster. Survivors will keep running to the same loops if they are rank 5 or lower. If your gonna play killer but not Chase survivors idk how you will ever get hooks.
---
YouTube
---
All the broken key is truly good for is disappointing mew when mew open a chest, and using when you're completely out of items to run
---
It would’ve cost a shit ton to seek the rights for both the mask and the Scream name itself- and as Mathieu explained, it’s better to go with the instantly recognisable mask and make an original character around that. Scream fans will still be attracted to it as it’s still presented as Ghostface and isn’t using a mask like the TV series (which isn’t bad, but it’s nothing compared to THE mask), and they get to create their own new character.
---
There will be a battle pass.  
---
It’s called the rift.
---
Not god tier, but possibly high.
---
The guitarist was killing it
---
Dont chase the same person for 5 gens forehead.
---
Yeah. The wraith is simply easier to play than those killers but they are much stronger against competent survivors. At lower ranks the wraith is powerful but as you get higher you get to people that are very coordinated on gens and can loop m1 killers for a very long time. 
---
Simply put he is easy but weak against skilled opponents.
---
That's going to be retardedly op, but kinda nice after gens get done. 2 perk freddy seems nice. Wonder how they're going to balance things after possibly nerfing loops, MoM and buffing killers.
---
LOL. It takes skill bud. There are no infinite loops in the game by the way.  I also have no problem taking down totoms for NOED because guess what that is what you have to do to remove the clutch perk. If you don;t like people looping good loop spots then run a different perk like bamboozle because that is what is good against countering looping Just like taking totems down is countering the clutch perk of NOED.
---
It was mentioned in the stream. They can't do it though until they have dedicated servers and migrate the friends/party system to be fully in-game.
---
But survivors also got Ash so they had more survivors to play around with then killers did. 
---
Are people forgetting that Leatherface exists as well and did the same thing? 
---
Also, keep in mind its not their fault, if they cant get the licneicing to it then they wont do it.
---
How many more effects does he need to be an effective killer?
---
He already has:
---
1) Built in aura reading that kicks in every 60 seconds.
---
2) flickering for mind games, so pseudo stealth at a distance.
---
3) Teleporting to a gen with a 5 second tell that it's coming.
---
4) EITHER the ability to place fake pallets OR the ability to place slowing traps.
---
and that's it. They're not going to give him much more than that.
---
On April 2nd.  2 months ago, essentially right after the last chapter.  It's like if we only get a survivor next chapter and people justify it with "but the Freddy Rework" except even longer of a time difference.
---
Happy cake day sir and yes, they can. It’s their character and their design, just with a VERY popular mask that’s been used for countless reasons.
---
&gt;we don’t know what the anniversary event will consist of yet.
---
spoilers: A bunch of people with fragile ego's DCing when a slight breeze blows
---
Tbf it WAS inflated by the banning of puppers and noob in chat
---
FCK ME WITH A RECK MOM
---
Watching the gameplay from the livestream and seeing that he can walk forwards and attack survivors is way to powerful I hope he gets nerfed before this power can be put to use!
---
Thanks! That’s really nice to hear, hopefully he can get some love in place of other killers who aren’t so fortunate...
---
Twitch chat is disturbing. Best to just go fullscreen and pretend people that fucking stupid dont exist.
---
no day 1
---
AAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Have you read the licence ? Can you show it to me .
---
Ash and Leatherface did not count as one of the four main chapters per year; so neither side had to deal with more than 3 months between releases until now.
---
I think we petition for more major fixes than pumping out content.
---
Like i said, we dont know if he even still has the aura reading or what the dreamworld does thats all im saying.
---
The way she thinks all window loops are the same should have already been telling you she has no god damn clue. Let's just assume every single window loop in the game is the same, just be aggressive 4head
---
Douche Spice was the least popular of the Spice Girls and for good reason
---
I would rather use up a toolbox on a gen that is almost done that makes the killer guard that gen than have to use it on every gen that does not get repaired because of Im the only one doing them. Have had that happen multiple times. Although I understand where you are coming from.  What I like to do with my toolboxes is use them almost 99% up and then just do it regularly and make it out and keep that toolbox. I have found that is the easiest way for me to keep them since I have had a hard time finding them and the addons on the blood web recently. I have kept my current toolbox so long I forgot how long I have had it and I have used it every game.
---
I had this happen to me today.  Im new and only rank 17 killer. After my first match with The Shape I got a message saying I was being reported for tunneling. Had no clue what they were talking about.
---
It's not the streamers responsibility after a while.
---
You get different Teachable perks by reaching certain Blood Web milestones, levels 30, 35, and 40.
---
So for the Pig, you'd get Hangman's Trick at 30, Surveillance at 35, and Make Your Choice at 40.
---
Keep in mind that they don't unlock automatically, you have to make your way over to them and unlock them with blood points. This means that when you unlock the teachables, you're not actually getting a new perk for that particular blood web.
---
?!
---
I never asked who affects gameplay more.
---
I stated that A) people should show more empathy and B) accepting a killer paragraph as a chapter means they can try to pass off a survivor paragraph as a main chapter at a later date.
---
And? Why does that matter you guys did in fact get a new survivor before killers did so saying 'we got nothing new' is a complete lie. 
---
There is no reason to be upset over it people are just salty. Stop trying to make excuses for something that doesnt even matter. 
---
A new survivor isnt evne as big as a deal as a new killer and you know it. Killers control the pace of the game, survivors are just skins with perks.
---
Spirit fury+Enduring+Bamboozle+BBQ
---
watch them cry tears of sat as you eliminate their MoM through pallet swing after pallet swing
---
Daddy Micahel has competition for me now
---
I don't need to find them on other characters bloodlines do I?
---
This sub would riot even if we got Carl.
---
**what. else. would. it. do**?
---
Explain that to me, or you're just holding out a false sense of hope that he's going to show up with 50 abilities and one of them might be good.
---
They didn't mention the Aura reading going away, but they specifically called out the slowdown effect. It's likely to stay.
---
Spirit. I just find her play style fun and I like her lore.
---
I just did lol, got a 3k that sprint burst and lithe was a wasted perk for them lol!
---
hes a reliable killer with decent base perk that give vison of gens if 2 people are doing them helps to proc his ability also he can get a perk that gives vision of people exiting lockers alot of kill potential great killer
---
I'll say spirit. The amount of mindgames you can play with her is just awesome.
---
I used to main her, before Billy and Michael.
---
Since when does a terror radius matter while you’re in a chase. Survivors only look for the red stain anyway while looping, and the music is loud enough to tell you if a killer is chasing or not. Wtf is this perk?
---
&gt; A new survivor isnt evne as big as a deal as a new killer
---
Unless you don't play killer.
---
Lmao for real though she was dope
---
Maybe survivors in the dream world have blindness, maybe some other kind of smaller scale debuffs. 
---
Hes going to be good i dont care, im just saying we should wait until it comes out and see what it fully does.
---
Clown is great antilooper
---
Thanks! I suppose I haven't seen it yet cuz I just started 😁
---
I would be fine with that. I think most people would. With all the other stuff they announced in the stream it’s understandable that they won’t have a survivor as they are probably spread thin.
---
I mainly meant the perks, not his powers directly
---
You should go with NOED or Corrupt Intervention instead. Ruin is inconsistent and good survivors can easily counter it.
---
&gt;•Game health - improved matchmaking (eliminating long wait times/ improving player pairing), dedicated servers (overall gameplay review / managing disconnections), "those who disconnect repeatedly will be treated in a special way".
---
This is all I care about, did they give any timeline for this? last I heard was they were waiting on Dedicated Servers to address DCing which they said won't be until august. I can't image people are going to deal with mass DC's for another 2+ months. 
---
I already stopped playing survivor because tired of getting fucked over, it's not really fun either as a killer. can't imagine being a new player and this is your experience while trying to learn the game. I'm sure it turns a lot of new players off who might have otherwise stayed and help the community grow
---
Im a spirit
---
Its still not a big deal because again, they are just skins. 
---
And your not taking into account the licnesing issues.
---
Theres always a weak link.. yo do you play killer ever?
---
Sorry, Grammar Nazi here, it's teammate! Lol but seriously excellent meme.
---
Is she going to the other side or is she just standing there? Lol she can end loops quickly without too much effort.
---
What exactly are they doing?
---
Legion. The amount of game slowdown you can get by spreading out damage is ridiculous
---
They kinda are, though. They gain distance on you. When I play killer I can usually still stay someone close to where they ran, but it's a guessing game, and it buys them time, which is very valuable in this game.
---
&gt; Its still not a big deal because again, they are just skins.
---
To you.  It's still not a big deal to you.
---
Siting behind some object and going around it over and over again, can't find a way to catch up to them.
---
Lmaooooo🤔😁
---
The fact that they're revisiting their backstories and actually showing it cinema style is amazing. I can't wait to see lil Dwight with his pizza box
---
Ew at him passive aggressively calling you “honey” after looking at your twitch.
---
Attacked? I'm part of the playerbase. Twitch chat is absolutely toxic on all games, that doesn't change my point.
---
Yes, and there aren't many weak links at rank 1.
---
uuuh go downstairs then? Sure the upstairs loops you can't cut line of sight well, but downstairs there are a good number of tiles that can cut off line of sight. Honestly the game is fine and one of my favourite maps to play as both Survivor and Killer.
---
Aren't you that streamer everyone says is a dick?
---
No. Objectibly speaking its not as big as a deal as a killer. Use your head, killers change how the game is played because of powers, survivors wont. 
---
Your also ignoing every other point ive made.
---
Y?
---
The title directly associates the two.
---
Pig. Pig cute. 
---
I also like Legion, Hag, Clown, Freddy and Hillbilly at the moment though
---
No0b3 has a history of being banned on DBD. I *HEARD* he used some kind of cheats to get perks on other accounts faster so he didn't have to re-grind everything, but I've only heard that, so I don't know if it's true. 
---
Puppers joined chat and got banned for 30m for saying "No0b3" which was an auto-ban by the mod bot, then people started saying "FREE PUPPERS" and then the mods seemed to start targeting him, either that or they made the bot target his name and his account to stop him messaging any more.

That P3 outfit has justtt the right amount of blood on it.
---
It's not surprising in the slightest that there's lots of man-children and literal kids if youve seen endgame chat and the dumb shit posted on here
---
Tbagging after a pallet is often used to get that killer to break the pallet. If you just run away before making sure the killer breaks the pallet then you can get caught before the next loop
---
Ah yes, my favorite *Deceased before Dawn* developer, Matthew Coat.
---
Mathieu should just be the next survivor in chapter 13, and have this as the default skin 😂😂
---
Halloween 1 will always be my fav 80s slasher film.
---
Then you get a Nurse.
---
ty buddy gonna buy now
---
*toxic survivors will do infinite loops + teabag you
---
Absolutely
---
She thinks jut because you can get a hit after vaulting that window three times and gaining bloodlust the tile is "outplayable" nevermind the point being how much time it takes and how badly the survivor has to screw up for it to go any faster
---
I love pig, but I don't think the people i play against her as understand how cute she is.
---
Well they are accepting applications right now.
---
Honestly no. Good survivors remember the good totem hiding spots. Also ruin tends to make survivors get better at hitting great skill checks.
---
If you pallet shine me more than once I'll usually smack on hook and nod because it's just bm trading at that point. I'm above camping and tunnelling but not some good ol bm.
---
I really don’t understand how survivors are supposed to play? Looping is OP how? It’s your only way to not die instantly to the killer. 
---
I don’t see what justice they will do to continue on buffing killers to the point that they just have to look at you to kill you
---
You have equal leathality to an opponent in both CSGO and overwatch if they go to spawn kill you, so not exactly relevant to this discussion due to that.
---
Better yet - Torgo!
---
I was thinking the Blue shell was a viking helmet and the bullet bill was some sort of hole.  Nintendo has a major Star gaming character that is somewhat obscure in the U.S. so 1 + 1 = Fish.
---
Yes he is, you can shut that shit down fast!
---
No way. They just think "ew holding a button for four hours and hoping I don't get tunnelled"
---
I hope they're pleasantly surprised to find that I leave trapped people alone and try and let them have fun.
---
Factual statement
---
So when are they reworking shelter woods and that big ass map that's nothing but corn
---
Kate, don’t really need an explanation haha
---
I didn’t assume shit. This is my personal opinion. You’re the one assuming lmfaooooo shut up
---
Maps are so rare that it's kind of a waste to run this.  Which is a real shame.
---
i wasnt saying you were but thats how it works best way around it is to get crafty walk backwards to hide stain or surprise them also some killers are better at downing then others it takes time to get the hang of things
---
Most important question: does Freddy still have the dream world filter? It was literally the only choice of colours that I could see survivors in this game.
---
That’s fair. Take out bloodlust if loops are going to be nerfed
---
Except every licensed killer has things that don't line up with their movies so it actually doesn't and you are blatantly wrong.
---
Survivors looking at him means facing him or swivelling camera? SO they have to get off the gen and turn to face him to cancel the stalk?
---
She was fucking wicked!!!
---
Comically missing the point.  Freddy has always been able to walk up to people and hit them.  There was just a delay to it.
---
Imagine if Clown had to wait 60 seconds before he could get his bottles back.
---
Imagine if a survivor could become immune to Trapper's bear traps for 60 seconds for no real benefit.
---
Lol, I think we misunderstood each other. I play against pigs and they are SUPER FRUSTATING! I always feel like I get camped with a trap on my head,
---
&gt;What map are they reworking?
---
New Springwood will be released this August (?), during the mid chapter patch. 
---
[Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large)
---
It's really not. A outfit isnt racist but people will make it racist.
---
I like to give the killer 2 more hits for extra points. But hey if ya want less points I will just leave.
---
Hang on a fucking second.
---
The Entity has influence over time and space.  It pulled Adiris from the babylonian era and Jane from the modern era and they're interacting like usual.  I do recall them mentioning the entity could traverse reality and pull people from different worlds, hence Leatherface, Freddy, Myers and Pig all being in the same environment.
---
The entity took Rin before she was fully dead, Adiris was also on Death's door, but didn't Jane fully crash her car?  I guess that's not a guaranteed death, but if the Entity can pull stuff from different times and spaces, I figured death would be one of those no brainer things.
---
Is it because she is hot? Or cause she literally sings when she gets hooked?
---
it does suck considering those 3 are probably some of the biggest reasons DBD has survived this long with the player base that it has, they actively play the game and by doing so promote it to multiple reasonably sized audiences
---
doesn't surprise me that people were making a fuss about it, it's kinda bullshit that they did ban mention of them in chat, and it just made it worse for themselves by doing it in the first place
---
Lithe now activated after a sprint into a vault able object, rather than having to solely rely on a chase. This makes the proc of Lithe less reliant on the killer being super close and in proximity for a chase.
---
Call me crazy, but i genuinely enjoy playing Freddy. He may be bad but i find him to be fun. And isn’t that the point of a video game?
---
Except the other killers are at least baseline in line with their movie counterparts. Walking around the real world is definitely not part of Freddy's baseline character, so you are blatantly wrong.
---
Is it overheating?
---
It’s a cultural outfit that has nothing to do with him lol . I ain’t even gonna start with you cause I can tell ya don’t get it .
---
You are insufferable.
---
You have to be trolling
---
Wasn't there during the stream, can someone catch me up?
---
I feel it
---
Trapper is fun
---
Survivors are just skins with no real bonuses except for perks, so really it's just a matter of preference.
---
I'd probably recommend:
---
- Claudette: Self Care allows you to heal yourself when safe, Empathy allows you to see allies when injured, and Botany Knowledge allows her to heal faster.
---
- Meg: Quick and Quiet allows you to vault or enter a locker silently,  Sprint Burst helps you escape from the killer, and Adrenaline heals you and gives you a speed boost when the last generator is completed.
---
- Feng: Alert is underrated and can provide a ton of map awareness since it shows you the killer's location whenever they break something, Lithe is a great Exhaustion perk to help get away from the killer, Technician is hot garbage.
---
- Tapp: Tenacity doesn't come up much, but it'll save you when it does. Stake Out acts as a sort of detection perk for when the Killer is nearby (and will help train you for paying attention to Whispers) and grants Great Skill Checks as long as you have tokens, and Detective's Hunch will ensure you start learning where Totems spawn and where Generators are located.
---
Tapp has some of my favorite perks, but the others are good too.  Really just pick a Survivor you like and go with them.
---
Legion with iridescent pin, enduring, and spirit fury is my new addiction
---
Being white isn’t a heritage lol.
---
If it's going to be refocused into a stealth game, then it needs to be a death on first hook sort of situation. There is nothing fun about spending 10 minutes looking for immersed Claudettes in corners skulking around while gens go left and right. Only to find one, have them disappear into the fog and heal and hide again. Shit is boring as hell on both sides.
---
So ghostface is none of the original killers billy stu or any of the copycat killers. Make sense but It kinda sucks we don’t get Sydney as a survivor
---
So are people that arent Mexican not aloud to wear a outfit? You are obviously dumb dude. I see you are one of the ones that would make it racist so yeah let's not start. Have a good day man
---
Yep it is. Freddy is fun because he feels like a jumpscare killer. They hear the lullaby and try to hide, but you find them and they panic. With the rework we might lose that, but he does kinda need it tbh.
---
What are people's thoughts on this anyway?
---
Noob3's fan base is great today
---
Still no mention of colorblind options even though they can easily just give us a option to change aura colors...
---
Events have already done it.
---
Sounds like a good Friday night.
---
Nah, I got this game 2 - 3 ish hours ago, I even made a post looking for tips because I was installing the game.
---
It's hit or miss. I'm at rank 6 and I feel like I still see people that will ditch a gen the moment they see ruin.
---
“Japanese words and stuff” lol
---
No. But it’s what it implies.
---
Does playing a lot of Myers and Pig count?
---
Laurie, she’s the ultimate final girl (along with Sidney, who we sadly aren’t getting)
---
Scrap my idea, this is much better
---
I don't care to be completely honest I might buy it as another thing to do
---
Nothing is as tense as stepping in a trap and hes coming right for you. Michael is fun too, I love being jumpscare myers the most.
---
nope, checked pc temp and cpu/gpu usage, all completely nominal
---
I’m going to save this so I can come back when I watch the dev stream after it’s over because I don’t have enough commitment to watch it.
---
And only one side can butt dance.
---
This is the fundamental inequality of DbD.
---
As a big ol Queen I will say Kate is one fine looking 01010101 and I jus love the way she looks and I loved her reveal trailer, the guitar tune jus got me
---
Can you give me your discord?
---
i too dislike the idea behind rework, man :c
---
Same man! Hahaha
---
Pacman never called a Ghost a cunt while throwing them on an antique meat hook though
---
yes. if they burn through ruin, imagine what they do without it.
---
And totems will continue to get improved spots
---
Do I hold the streamers directly responsible? Hell no. Each person is only responsible for themselves. Do I think certain people create an environment of "Acceptable targets" and substitute being a crass jerk in place of having a personlity? Absolutely. 
---
I think it honestly wouldn't even be half as bad if they weren't so two-faced about it. Like I can at least respect AngryPug for him and his content style. Don't think I could ever watch it but at least he's brutally honest about what kind of stream he wants to present.
---
You want me to prove you wrong but you can't even spell, okay.
---
Which is probably good? This game is a lot of fun, but the core gameplay, especially on the survivor side, doesn't exactly scream "perfectly balanced masterpiece of competitive gaming".
---
One thing that keeps people away from this game is that they go in expecting a horror-action vibe but most of the survivor gameplay is Scooby Doo/Yakety Sax. I'd love to see survivor's silliest tools replaced with equally viable, less ridiculous ones.
---
I would say they change it, I think it‘s not clear if this will be a buff or a nerf...
---
They said they try to avoid infinite loops so that looping is more like a chase and not just running around until someone makes a mistake or so.
---
What do you think waka waka means?
---
:)
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted. Nurse is unanimously seen as broken by the community, yet has never received a rework lmao
---
Fucking Freddy is getting a rework, yet no news about Nurse.
---
..fair enough
---
In the dbd stream they announced a rift coming out next year it gives more cosmetics for challenges, but there’s also a paid mode, giving you more cosmetics
---
Notta; I've given you everything you need, now you just need to sprout your wings and fly baby birdie!
---
I didn't say it was?
---
Am fine with this if they take away bloodlust(ya know that thing what was made for anti looping).
---
Really? I’ll make sure I try those perks out!
---
Not a native speaker but ok. Reddit is for everyone on this planet. If you have such massive problems understanding me then I‘m sorry for my bad spelling :)
---
darn
---
I support Buff Freddy over fucking Nurse any day. I am so sick of Nurse after 2 years of her bullshit.
---
I also enjoy iron maiden and whispers. I've also heard good things about shadowborn
---
Yea I definitely run Iron Maiden
---
I appreciate the reply but the problem is that it’s peer to peer like the old cod games were. In them, as long as the party leader left the lobby first then the other members could still be in the party once they backed out too. So that’s why it shouldn’t be an excuse for a game being 3 years old and is active.
---
Again, I do love the game and can wait for QoL changes, I was just asking a question. I also don’t browse the subreddit all that much so that is my fault. 
---
Thank you for the reply :)
---
Thanks, bud!
---
kinda rewarding though, knowing you made someone upset enough to shoot himself in the foot... right after you shot his other foot lol.
---
what sucked for me was you know where the tips come up where it says "the nurse", "the legion" and it tells you who the kller is that didn't show up for me why?
---
A symmetrical game where you and the other guy both have guns and can kill each other equally is by no means comparable to DBD, an asymmetrical game where you are defenseless to retaliate against a killer aside from temporary stalls.
---
That is why the comment saying it was a killer main sub got 50 upvotes... stop trying to ignore what other people say under the guise of "killer main so must be biased."
---
One thing has you pay 50 a week. One has you pay for something 2-3 times a year.
---
But yeah totally same thing
---
how are they changing looping?
---
it's probably principle of the thing
---
This is the 3 year anniversary exclusive we're getting
---
They’ve been saying that for a while now. I just can’t help thinking I’m better off taking a perk that will be useful throughout the entire match rather than one that best case scenario will likely only last for five minutes or so.
---
Nurse would have noed activate after 1 generator is completed
---
I hope they do the swamp.
---
It's funny, because this got downvoted. If it was a killer main sub, this would have as many upvotes as the original comment does.
---
A wild intellect has appeared
---
I am actually liking the idea others proposed of reworking bloodlust if safe loops get removed, because Bloodlust is kinda silly outside of loops. Bloodlust out in the open just means a potentially 25 second chase gets reduced to 8 seconds most of the time.
---
When the dull totem you're cleansing lights up.
---
Hey guys, just came in to say FUCK Haddonfield.
---
Again, this was mocking the mods for censoring anyone not using English in chat and putting ENGLISH ONLY PLEASE after every single one they deleted, not the person speaking. Chat did this for anyone that didn't speak English to chat/taunt the mods. Yes there was inexcusable insults and slurs and I am not condoning those I am simply making sure people understand that in this specific example chat wasn't mocking the person on the stream but the mods.
---
No use of cunt  :-p
---
Guess that's the No0b3 of old  :)
---
this also a game and games are meant to be fun. would suck penis if that was the case with all of the aura and endgame perks.
---
Ohhhhh okay, sorry I didn't see that part
---
He is. It’s not like they’re hiding that fact.
---
Imagine thinking self care is a good perk
---
But with the speed nerf how do you ever reach anybody?
---
As Mexican I would love this
---
Watch some YouTubers or twitch streamers
---
And even if you do that. Some people's mentality even after they become "adults" doesn't mature to that level.
---
That’s so good
---
*baby dweet
---
I knew I forgot something
---
So just hold down M2? Wtf?
---
Either you're new to Twitch/Gaming or stupid, if you take twitch chat seriously you need to step back and really think.
---
It's like those people spamming VAC in CS:GO streams when a pro does a decent shot. Each game has something else.
---
DO I LOOK LIKE....
---
well even if they Hit the skill checks, it slows them down.
---
The only Problem remaining are the sometimes sucky Totem Spots
---
Lmao now you’re changing your statement. First it’s literally impossible to lose killers without loops but now acting like I’m saying it’s so easy to do it. My god this sub is a survivor pity party
---
I don’t use Bond all that often, but if I know a teammate’s in the area I’m leading the killer to, I tend to change course, if possible.
---
IM A BAD BITCH YOU CANT KILL ME
---
I think it's supposed to combo with I'm All Ears. You'll have a 6 second aura to track survivors during a Chase.
---
k
---
Is it worth marking anything other than the hatch?
---
As long as the outline is surrounding survivors, yeah you can.  While holding M2 though you do get slowed down considerably, plus Tier 3 is (usually) temporary, so you have to build up your tiers again when it ends.
---
So I was playing him ass backwards. I was using the power when I saw a survivor to chase them down. I need to hold M2 basically to stalk and then release when I see them, rinse and repeat?
---
Yeah but once it gets destroyed three seconds after spawning your left with three perks and nothing to fight against gen progression.
---
IT IS CHECK TWITTER
---
Now we know what happened after they ended the stream.
---
SEXY TIME HAS BEGUN
---
np
---
This is a very silly way to look at it. It's not just for "killer mains". As survivor, you're getting a brand new killer, with brand new abilities and perk to learn and play against, to shake up the gameplay, and offer more variety in matches. To say that only killer mains benefit from this, is ridiculous.
---
IM FAST AS FUCK BOII
---
&gt;If that’s the case then sort by controversial?
---
Seems pretty balanced to me. If anything it seems slightly survivor sided.
---
&gt;I said they make up the majority.
---
Based on what? What you had for breakfast? What you think isn't necessarily true. This sub is pretty balanced. Most people keep on the posts that they agree with. If you go on a post saying EGC is good and say something against it, you get downvoted. If you go on a post saying EGC is bad and say it's good, you get downvoted.
---
&gt;And I don’t use it as an argument to dismiss “everything” I disagree with.
---
Didn't mean to imply you personally, but many people do that.
---
&gt;I’ve been on this sub for an extremely long time and have seen a lot of survivors get absolutely crapped on and shamed into silence by combative killer mains. Try again?
---
I've been on this sub for quite a while too. I've seen killer mains get absolutely crapped on by survivor mains. Try again?
---
Adam has some of the most interesting perks of the game. Makes for some weird plays. The rock has saved my ass a few times too.
---
Id give you a silver but I'm broke
---
HELLO
---
Ohhhh so should I hold it down all the time basically? I should I release during pursuits?
---
&gt;go kys
---
What a lovely person you are.
---
You got it all figured out bruh
---
Does this mean ranks will be unique to each killer? Or will they still have a global rank for purpose of matchmaking?
---
its really not always that fast and every Second they waste looking for it is Time they dont work on gens
---
There's also the fact that the map is generally way too window heavy which means that if you don't have Bamboozle it instantly becomes massively Survivor-sided.
---
Playing on Haddonfield is literally a checklist: if you have Bamboozle or are one of the five Killers who do well on Haddonfield (Trapper, Hag, debatably Legion and Billy, and Nurse is just good wherever) you win, and if the Survivors have Balanced Landing you lose.
---
Give it a break with the melodrama you literally have no idea what the rework is going to look like
---
Yeah I do agree that its interactions with Doctor create issues but it's honestly an issue more with Doctor and less with the map.
---
Interesting choice for first rework
---
Wholesome :)
---
Pretty much.  You tier up pretty quickly, so sometimes it's in your benefit to stay in Tier 2 if you know you're close to needing it.  Like if they have 4 gens done or something.  You'll learn to pick your moments with practice.  Or just run a permanent Tier 3 add-on
---
Can I get an ay men in here?
---
This would be kinda frustrating and would encourage camping. 
---
No thanks.
---
you go to the nether and build cobblestone walls to protect from thr ghasts
---
even different games because it was my first time playing.
---
Sadly this is the case for almost any killer/addon that's considered OP. Can't wait for temp/perm bans to be handed out when dedicated servers launch.
---
rip puppers &amp; no0b3
---
No which one of the two? Always hold, or hold when looking for survivors and release when in pursuit? Thanks
---
I used to think self care had a knife in the icon. Took me way to long to realize it was a bandage lol.
---
Lol, get good
---
The start of a match you want to find and stalk survivors while trying to not be seen. Get it to tier 2 as soon as possible. 
---
Once I get to tier 2 and can move at normal speed, I only use the stalk if I know they don't see me, or if I lost them in a chase and want to try to spot them. 
---
I'll build up stalk meter so it's almost full and ready to go into tier 3, and then I save it. When a situation goes down where there are multiple survivors I've caught off guard or I really need to stop them in their tracks, I'll stalk them quick, finish the tier 3 off, and go into one-shot mode.
---
The jist of how I recommend to play him is get to tier 2 as soon as possible, and then just worry about hooks and generators. Don't overuse the stalking too much, going from tier 2 to tier 3 too often. It takes a lot of time.
---
&gt; chases the same survivor for 3 min
---
Some people just don't know when to stop a chase. If a survivor knows how to loop, and is in a particularly strong area of the map, learn to give up chase. Come back to him when you've chased a less skilled survivor. That way, the good survivor is more likely to run into a dead zone, or think a pallet that has been used is still there. But then again, there are many maps with very strong areas that survivors gravitate too, or games where all 4 survivors aren't potatoes.
---
Wraith. Bing bong never gets old
---
I'm a bit disappointed that Chapter 12 will only have a killer, but not for that reason. Aside from the 3 perks, survivors don't add anything gameplay-wise. Going against a different killer changes the game completely, while going against a different survivor doesn't change anything. New killers benefit both sides.
---
The guy in the back of the 2nd pannel is looking at his ass
---
I believe it is pronounced Turdette if they are wearing all brown cosmetics.
---
Exactly, they just dont think.
---
And yes. You were doing it a bit backwards. Stalking slows you down, so you want to do it in moments where you're not seen, you're sneaking up on them on a generator, etc. For chases and everything else, you'll be an M1 killer
---
Wraith.
---
I like his backstory, and there is no better feeling than decloaking and body blocking a survivor, trapping them in between my body and the generator, watching as they slowly give up hope and give in, not even moving as I hit them twice and hook them.
---
Seriously though, watching people shit themselves when I decloak right behind them is fucking hilarious.
---
Lmao you’re full of crap. Survivors get crapped on every single post and every single comment. Killer mains, like you, come at survivor mains very harshly and with attitude and they are the vocal majority. You don’t know how many upvotes my comment had to begin with. My comment could’ve had 200 upvotes and it’s going down and now it’s at 40-something. So, again, your argument makes no sense. Perhaps you’re having a hard time reading? Maybe reread and then come back to this comment? I don’t know how else to help you. 
---
This sub is ANYTHING but balanced. I am laughing at that thought process. Pretty much anything that’s not crapping on survivors gets downvoted and argued with, “but MoM! DS! BT!!! NOED is balanced just do totems!!!” 
---
This is exactly what I’m talking about. The combativeness. Go somewhere.  I read pretty much everything on this sub whether it’s about killers or survivors and that’s what I see. You will never tell me that killers have it hard around here. Clearly as you can see by the replies to my comment. You take care now.
---
Depends on how you want to play.  Three standard ways to play it. 
---
1.  Stay in Tier 1 for sneaky grabs
---
2. Spam it as much as possible to get as much use out of Tier 3 as possible.
---
3.  Get to Tier 2 and, with practice, pick your moments for the best effectiveness.
---
For a newbie Michael, I'd probably rush Strategy 2, so the latter of your statements.
---
And if only one gen doesn’t show up white? You’re gonna walk towards that gen? 
---
Some survivors get off the gen/hide to avoid BBQ aura, so those generators would get locked. 
---
Imagine that you’re a killer with this perk and all generators turn white. Why would you leave the hook? Survivors can’t punish you for camping anymore. 30 seconds is 1/4 of a hook state. 
---
Think of the lurking variables.
---
I remember when the wiki had a release day for The Spirit and everyone was losing their shit because the devs didn’t release on that same day.
---
I've got one for you.
---
&gt;!PLAY THE DAMN GAME, YA LAZY STALE END PIECE OF BREAD!&lt;
---
This pic makes him look like he has a huge dong bulge owo
---
I'm way more excited for rank rewards
---
Knowing the average location of a faraway survivor encourages the exact opposite of camping.
---
Read my response to “trey does YouTube”
---
God, but stealth is so boring, from both sides. At least for me. As a killer, you spend the whole game looking around for the brown pant brown shirt claudette in the grass, and the second you find her, you down her in &lt;20 seconds. As a survivor, you just hold M1 on a gen, and the second you hear a heartbeat, go hide, until the killer gives up. Chances are, if you're stealthing, you'll be in a bad spot if you get found. IMO thats why killers like leatherface work well in very low ranks. Because when you find the claudette in the corner, she has no where to go except for eating your chainsaw
---
Knowing no survivors are on a gen at that exact moment is no reason to camp past what reasons already exist. If the killer wasn't a camper before, this wont make them one. If they were, this probably wont change anything. All it is is a simple tracking perk or at least a perk to slow the game down a bit
---
Hopefully, we get to see THE Baby Dwight
---
I'd rather have Tux Freddy or New Nightmare's Entity.
---
That would be SICK! One of my biggest issues with the game has always been their really poor ranking system, this would be great!
---
HA! GOT EM
---
okay and
---
Lol
---
Not Mudrunners those guys are chill
---
Exactly.
---
Trapper. Simple enough power that is always satisfying to see successful. Just wish he'd get some much needed QoL changes.
---
Unfortunately, if they increased it too much it would likely decrease the amount of time people play the game, which decreases the likelihood of purchases.
---
Plus, if you get a lot of points every day, then it decreases the novelty of events as well which are super enjoyable
---
One blink but every hit is an instadown.

Took from around 2:22:30 in the stream vod.

Humans in a nutshell.
---
I dont even know why I follow this subreddit lol, the fan art is nice but the constant back and forth is hilarious, killers get angry at pallets, survivors get angry at "face campers".
---
But let's be real here majority of toxic players are survivors lmao, DC after missing decisive and leaving the rest of us to burn.
---
Bc you always know which side she's approaching from? Lmao
---
I’m assuming this is a troll post.
---
But I’m a friendly person so on the rare off chance that it isn’t...
---
You really got no choice but to play, bud. Killer will bring you better BP returns, so put on your BBQ and Chili, and get out there. We all had to do it and continue to do it, so you’re not alone in your struggle and it is a heck of a grind, but just enjoy the game and feel good as you earn your way to the top. 
---
If there was a hack, you’d be cheating not only the game but yourself. You wouldn’t grow. You wouldn’t improve. You’d take a shortcut and gain nothing, experiencing just a hollow victory, with nothing risked yet nothing gained. This is your chance to show you know the difference.
---
LOL, I call them both clutch perks. Which they both are crutches just as bad as each other.
---
Slip n slides confirmed for DBD

Wake me up inside
---
Sorry for the bad quality. This is an old video, wish I still had the original that was saved to the system
---
HI BITCH! WHATS UP BITCH! SUCK MY DICK BITCH!
---
No way! 
---
Yay I’m not crazy. XD
---
While that is true, a main reason why people don’t camp is to put pressure somewhere else in order to slow the game down in order to win. 
---
If you eliminate the survivors ability to win the game/punish you by taking away their generators for thirty seconds, you win if you camp. 
---
I can catch someone at five generators, full facecamp them, and have one dead with two generators left AT MINIMUM. 3 alive, two full generators left? The killer is favored in this situation. 
---
Survivors will often waste time trying to save as well. Any survivor not on a gen cannot punish a camping killer, especially if they have to heal because you hit them.
---
Pretty good jig so far
---
spirit can run into survivors and by touching each side of a gen she can tell which position they are in......
---
We could do with a few more casualties I reckon
---
That's true. In terms of facecampers, it screws over survivors. I get that BHVR wants to stop gen rushing, but continuing to add perks isnt the way to do it
---
That's kinda my point though, reduce the reward as well as the ability to grief targets in that fashion. It'll keep happening until discouragement or a fix are dreamt up, you're correct about that. But I kinda refuse to kill my optimism that perhaps one day a fix or harsher penalty for playing like an asshole will be dreamt up.   
---
That being said, even though I don't agree with your resignation to not finding a solution on the issue I don't know why people are downvoting you.
---
This is a killer main sub -survivor
---
No, this is a survivor main sub. -killer
---
Nah, only ones that claim that are crybabies that got told their opinions were wrong, got downvoted, and decided to blame it on the sub being mostly the other side instead of their opinion not being so great. This sub has what is called people who play both sides and like making fun of whiners on both sides. If anything, technically more survivors play this game (obviously, its a 4v1) but both sides get plenty of love and hate here.
---
Fortnite itself cost money. The BR part does not
---
Legit thought he was wearing the infinity gauntlet for a second there
---
Its still a nerf.
---
I’ve never seen someone this delusional before. This subreddit never ceases to amaze me.
---
MOBILE???
---
Without knowing the cooldown, it's impossible to know what kind of buff it needs, if it needs one at all.
---
You're making the mistake of assuming the best of people, when that's not the case.
---
Let's say Thrilling Tremors has a cooldown of 45 seconds and you want to buff it to a 30 second duration. What's stopping me from picking up a survivor, activating the perk, dropping the survivor again, and then following them around with Deerstalker to pick them up again? The Survivor is losing a ton of their Bleedout timer, the Gens are slowed down more than even Ruin could hope for, and if all Gens are white there's no point in even leaving that survivor since the rest of them can't do anything about it.
---
I'm willing to put my money down on Thrilling Tremors being meta anyway even at 16s, especially if there's no notification to the survivors working on a generator that they just painted a bullseye on their head.
---
I’m ready for dedicated servers!!! I thinks with just that we will see a drastic change in the game and how it’s currently been operating across all platforms!!!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't they have a thing saying that even they paid version of the battle pass was accessible with play time? And they kinda have to keep adding more monetisation if you want them to keep supporting the game since the longer a games out the fewer copies of it are sold and the ones that are generally are on sale. So complain if you want but it's either you put up with some cosmetics you have to do an absurd grind for or you get much less to no new content.
---
Full screen baby
---
Why? As already been said, he has a free hit at every start of a chase and then has to chase and mindgame like any other killer. Sorry, but i really dont see the downside
---
To be fair, there is a good and side to it. Sadly, the bad side is what most people see and it gives DBD, a bad rep.
---
*devs change the rules with 0 warning*
---
You: "ShOuLd HaVe KnOwN"
---
If the survivors ever did this, the Entity would either eliminate them or their memories, or torture them until they don’t try again. The Entity is practically god, so you really can’t do shit against the color apart from stunning them
---
This sounds amazing.
---
I play both sides so that I always come out on top
---
that about the events is a really good point but we also don't get much events. Maybe if there were a couple of events a month they'd give the players more options to get some BP and they'd receive a huge amount of players in those events, idk
---
Damn... that's crazy
---
You are the bad guy. But this does not mean you are bad guy
---
We all know the second survivors get nerfed, less people will play them. Just like legion! :D
---
SHUT UP YOU DICKHEAD NOW FUCK OFF
---
“Toxic killers when they hear BHVR is doing a killing rework” see how fucking stupid that sounds?
---
I don’t think this was a good idea, I don’t have time to play much, and if I really want a cosmetic from the rift I’d like to just buy it instead of it disappearing forever if I’m too late. The hallowed blight event had cosmetics that can still be bought. Limited time items are the problem.
---
Made me think that Ghostface is a hit man
---
^^ My (a LF mains) reaction when I see LF basement camping with insidious
---
Looks like someone at the office forgot to switch from their business account to their personal account.
---
Unless we're gonna start getting a new item in chests...
---
Underrated movie
---
The wiki should be for confirmed information. Therefore, they shouldn't have put that on there. Doesn't matter what the devs have done in the past, you can't expect them to do everything the same way forever.
---
No way we would never find this guy. He would walk by the killer dressed as trapper.
---
As I saw it, being in his radius puts you into micro sleep which is why he can attack.
---
Maybe all the survivors start SUPER tired and progress to sleepwalking after a period of the initial contact?
---
Sounds like Dimension films didn’t wanna give any of the Scream franchise rights over for use in the game. There loss on any extra profits from a movie that will never get a reboot or installment especially since Wes Craven died. If I owned the rights to a movie and someone like this company wanted to have rights to use any likeness from this movie, I would have a contract written up on who gets what for $$$$ ASAP since DBD is a rapidly growing game.
---
I totally get what you’re saying about camping and I think that perhaps at lower ranks, this could be an issue. 
---
That being said, I think the majority of killers that are all gens go white will instead appreciate the brief gen slowdown and try to use that time to quickly chain another survivor to get that edge. 
---
I actually think this perk could be fairly powerful when there is just 1-2 gens left. Pop Goes the Weasel and this perk should be a scary new type of 3-gen strat, I think.
---
i was shocked
---
Like spawning in the radius is one thing, but that hit is on some whole other level.
---
It would be great if a channel like Game Theory checked out this game.
---
Why are people saying Claudette’s brown skins are pay to win? They literally cost like 900 iridescent shards lol
---
Okay. 
---
This needs to be a cosmetic available to all survivors for free.
---
or maybe they're releasing a killer alone because they released a survivor on their own. facts are facts, even the sad ones.
---
This is great.
---
Haddonfield is not that bad! I play it all the time both sides and it all depends on how the person plays and knows the map. My Shirtless Myers gets 4k’s all day long while laughing and smoking a Cigar from the Haddonfield roof porch.
---
I dont think they mentioned anything about his aura reading, so it will most likely stay, but they said the action speed penalty is gone.
---
&gt; What would be his power?
---
depression
---
I would love to know what an Iridescent Dildo would do. 😂
---
At least we can put aside the p2w hysteria, since they stated the paid part of the track (I think tome = free, ridt = paid) is cosmetic only
---
honestly all I want is a Robert Englund skin
---
The only fix to that would be point changes and stricter ranking system, but anything to keep the total garbage away from my random solo survivor  games would be great
---
what a genius idea, get looped and waste a bunch of time, then waste even more time camping the person
---
He looks like the Bill Bye of BHVR.
---
While I have no delusionz of granduer here, I would like to zsee how I stack up against the other huntress players
---
They don't use 14 days to respond character. The PTB normally runs for under a week. The rest of the days are for tweaks that need making. For instant EGC timer being shortened, Plagues holding vomit to move faster ect. If PTBs had been done before Freddy we wouldn't be having a rework.
---
Yep.
---
I wont even set foot on a twitch platform. It's always clunky when I try to use it anyways. I want a battlepass for cosmetics as long as it isnt super expensive.
---
&gt; That being said, I think the majority of killers that see all gens go white will instead appreciate the brief gen slowdown and try to use that time to quickly chain another survivor to get that edge.
---
This wouldn't be the case.
---
No gens are being done, so there's no point to patrol them since Survivors can't be on them. If Survivors can't be on them they're probably going full Immersive to wait out the timer. This all boils down to trying to find a bunch of people who don't want to be found while those people have only one thing they can actually do during that time.
---
So the question as a killer becomes: Do I walk around without having a clue where anyone is and hope I run into someone with the potential of the one survivor I *know* where they are being rescued, or do I just sit here and wait for them to come to me since it's the only thing they can do at the moment.
---
As someone who plays Killer 90% of the time, I'm choosing the later every time.
---
How the fuck are cosmetics P2W? Claudette jokes aside that is.
---
Im not complaining but 4 days isn't a weekend bhvr
---
&gt;anyone above the age of 24
---
"Omg I'll like get a Nintendo tat to show I'm such a nurd"
---
Making stealth godly will destroy this game. Theyre not getting rid of loops, theyre getting rid of the huge loops without counterplay
---
That's not true. I like bamboozle on both sides.
---
Because if I go buy it on mobile or the switch I want my perks characters and progress to be able to boop too. If I'm at home and then I have to go somewhere I want to pick my phone up log in and play anywhere I go. I dont want to Dbd games to grind on.
---
Hahahaha
---
I’m a survivor and a killer main, but I don’t loop and play Spirit, so this has no effect on me.
---
I bet my ass once.  Still can't poop right.
---
So now killers balanced around their weakness to loops are gonna get stronger. 
---
Get ready for Billy to dominate rank 1 once they finish gutting Nurse
---
Just got a 2K + DC + hook with narrow escape.
---
A big improvement! He takes time to get used to, but it sounds like you're well on your way now
---
Oh no, the m1 killers are already strong enough as it is!
---
My man, Zangief &lt;3
---
It happened to me with micheals chapter when I bought it from the Microsoft store. I didnt do anything it ended up fixing itself.
---
Me a solo Survivor: drops key and instantly picks it back up 4 times
---
Other survivors: this kid is a retard
---
Me: waves at them to come follow as I know where the hatch is
---
Other survivors: don't follow the retard Carl
---
Me: hatch escapes
---
Other survivors: die to NOED
---
Wait does freddy still have tracking? I didn't see any talk of it so I assumed they got rid of the aura reading like they got rid of action speed debuff
---
You are....idk.
---
His chainsaw gets a 100% reach extension and +5% movement speed while charging.
---
Why are you being downvoted?
---
I enjoy the hunt. The kill is worth more than the prize. 
---
I honestly make more bloodpoints from it anyway, maxing hunt and deviousness.
---
We seem to have different takes on the matter.
---
Those suspenders are doing absolutely nothing for those pants.
---
I think the main improvement I noticed was improved sneakiness from evil 1 strangely. Evil 3 was actually slower than non evil for some r ason?
---
I'm not talking about Leatherface and Trapper kiddo. I'm talking about Billy and Spirit. Spirit specifically is designed to be weak to stealthy gameplay, Billy is the same way. 
---
The prevalence of anti stealth perks and lack of strong stealth perks keeps that from being a viable strategy. Distortion? Garbage. Only good for 3 uses and then ur without a perk. And considering every killer runs BBQ the higher up you go, have fun getting value out of that when you need it most since you can't re-earn tokens. 
---
The only good stealth perk Surviviors have is Urban and that's bc it does what a stealth perk is supposed to do. Conceal presence and allow the Survivior to remain nimble while close to the killer.
---
I’m going to keep dc’ing until they fix the Hitbox if i’m unfairly downed byebye
---
I love that you screenshot your own comment
---
You sound new.
---
&gt;One guy flubs a generator once, and the killer somehow finds us all
---
If someone misses a skillcheck, the killer is audibly and visually notified of the failed generator's location. 
---
You also need to learn how to loop. Yes, it's two hits until you're down, but a good survivor can loop and extend the amount of time the killer must waste in order to get those two hits for up to several minutes at a time (more, with certain perks).
---
I cringed at the post tbh. I don't really know what else to say. To each their own I guess.
---
They need to  rework Shelter Woods and The Game. Two heavily killer sided maps. I once had a Shelter Woods with 0 jungle gyms. Not one. All the loops were that one easily-mindgamed loop with the pallet in the middle. And one Twall. That's it. That map is horrible.
---
Cringe as you will, its a hell of a lot more fun than killing everyone in five minutes and never seeing them use a generator. Its just not fun for me.
---
I had the chat closed for the most part and the first time I opened it some guy named "morimemichael" posted it. I seriously rolled my eyes.
---
Im guessing 7 maybe 8 hours worth of play so far.
---
Im relatively new, but as a killer main, I find it easy to crush looping? It wastes a minute or two, but its not much, I think.
---
1 DCing is already painfully common. Losing connecting to my 87 megabyte internet my ass, and that's over wifi with shitty weather 
---
2 they are making legit punishments for DCing
---
Not even close to that low.
---
Yay for gaming laptops
---
If f13 would have had a stable game and continuous new content it would have been serious competition for f13. Most people that play f13 first scrutinize dbd because you defend yourself with pallets instead of baseball bars and other formidable weapons. They screwed their own game up so much that it wont ever compete with Dbd.
---
Get to higher ranks and I bet you you’ll eventually start whining about how easy the survivors have it.
---
Something I’ve noticed is that killers are very easy to win with early on, but at higher ranks, survivors tend to get the advantage.
---
As with Bill
---
The killer is going to have a bad time
---
Technically it still makes more sense if Pac-Man is the killer (he is) and the ghosts are juking too.  All playing mind games on each other.
---
PAC man even even has a terror radius when he eats the right pellets.
---
Wait. Ive never had every survivor loop me. WAIT. OH SHIT IM THE WRONG ONE, FUCK
---
It's not a spoiler if it was shown in the trailer.
---
You are what's wrong with the community. DCing because because you were "unfairly downed" Grow up man, if you can't handle getting downed and having 2 more chances then quit the game like seriously I try to be nice but seeing these commenys makes me want to main hillbilly with NOED and insta chainsaw.
---
Fucking THANK YOU
---
They said there will be more risky loops vs safe ones, but that means more loops. I believe it’s to separate good survivors from the bad, where they don’t fall for mind games etc. Riskier loops means more mindgames
---
I'm starting to feel glad we didn't get this place as a map... imagine the literal hundreds of pallets in there.
---
Please play a different game.
---
A bit of both. The archive itself is free. It has a web of challenges for all players free of charge. It's rewards are lore, cutscenes, cosmetics and the new charms.
---
New tomes (sets of challenges) will be added to the game periodically. Old tomes will still be available indefinitely.
---
When a new tome is released, a "rift" is available temporarily. Rifts are essentially a battle pass with free and payed rewards. You work your way through the latest tome for cosmetic rewards. (It should be noted that the devs went out of their way to specify that these rewards will not aid gameplay. No camouflaging cosmetics).
---
I really dont understand the constant hate on bbq when you can just make your aura impossible to see on a gen or just use a locker for a sec, but anyone who isnt the one being hooked should be on a gen anyway so... ?
---
Only killers that dont get looped are basically nurse, clown and hag. Huntress if the object making the loop is short, otherwise shes extremely weak to the loops. Outside of those the only killer who is even considered good is billy. This change wont really help high tier killers while it does help the lower ones, so im pretty sure it will be fine. Theyre adding more palettes again as well, so its not a straight up nerf
---
Not Me! Now if it’s a Dr. Yah fuck him and that Map! Any other killer and I’m gonna escape!
---
Sheltered Woods is just really unfun for both sides. The map is insanely big (like third biggest map in the game I'm pretty sure) which makes it a huge pain in the ass to play without tracking perks. Also you literally can't activate Balanced Landing on that map other than at the shack or if you manage to glitch out and "climb" the big stump in the middle of the map.
---
exactly i think the hit was more frustrating.
---
Isn’t the chainsaw a OHKO anyway?
---
I'll be honest. Pay attention to if someone is doing rescues or not. If it's a good match where you think people are putting in equal work then risk it all to save them. If you feel sketched out just leave. I promise in end game you can unhook someone and get hooked and they will walk right out of that door without a thought. Just do what you feel is safe.
---
Guess everyone already forgot about Ash
---
Soon and I hear they are adding more, tighter corn rows!
---
You mean identity V
---
Because toxic survivor mains out number killers 4 to 1
---
That's why the feedback is so unbalanced
---
They can delete that map for all I care I hate the swamp more then Mt. Ormond!
---
SINNER LOL!
---
The freddy snare traps will only be good depending on how they work, they said they take 2 seconds to arm, if freddy has to stand there for 2 seconds to place it it absolutely blows, if he insta places it but it takes 2 seconds to arm by itself then that's ok
---
That's because the people you are playing against are also new. Come back again once you get to under rank 10.
---
I'm not hating on barbeque. I use it all the time. I'm just pointing out its prevalence. 
---
And adding more pallets is fine and dandy and I agree loops need to be weaker. But Surviviors should have some kind of defense against the killer that ISNT "run in circles".
---
The hit isn't completely free. Hit or miss it's a FOUR second self stun. The survivor gets plenty of time to get to a safe area. It's just a worse power than other killers have. It's mostly downside without having much real strength.
---
Exactly it would be the ultimate cunt build and to make it worse  use a ebony mori. Basically one hit  with chainsaw or end game and you're fucked
---
Oh hey that reminds me why do the ranks regress?
---
You know the saying
---
If others can't so it for you then you gotta do it yourself
---
Amazing
---
How about devs fix the game
---
this. survivor is like nurse. youre trash and get shit on at first but the skill ceiling is insanely high, to the point where it's incredibly frustrating to go against a good survivor if you're not equally as skilled.
---
OH GOD! NO GOD PLEASE NO
---
Keep being a little bitch then.
---
If a survivor can run a killer so long that bloodlust is needed then it actually helps you as more gens can get done.
---
A minute or two is enough to get 2-3 gens done IIRC, provided everyone’s on a different one.
---
I have no idea what you’re saying.
---
Ive never thought of it that way.
---
^ This. I am not feeding a killer an easy 2k because he managed to down someone with NOED after playing shit the rest of the game.
---
I’m all against NOED but if you are going to use it don’t use it on billy.
---
It's because you are new. Higher rank play goes like this. 4 survivors each on a different generator hitting ruin skillchecks. You find 1. Now 3 gens pop as you hook the first survivor. 1 survivor goes for the save as the other 2 finish the last generators. You injure the one who made the save and down the 1 who was on the hook. Gens pop adrenaline on the injured and downed survivor. You get t bagged at the gate.
---
Neither do I. Tl:dr, wow this game is pretty- aaaaa im dead
---
Maybe the mods couldn't tell the difference between the idiots and normal messages
---
Honestly that's why I have nekopara. Someone gifted it as a meme so now I just have it
---
Yeah, this. I'm fine with the battle pass but would be happier if I can buy what i want from the pass individually in the store. I wouldn't even care if it costs more.
---
👏 It's 👏 not 👏 a 👏 nerf 👏 it's 👏 a 👏 re 👏 work 👏
---
Seriously. Loops will still be there, just not specific really nasty ones, and useless/poor loops will be made better to compensate. Loops will (according to BHVR at least) be less one-sided towards _either_ side. This means more opportunities for skilled players to outsmart each other. The only people negatively affected by this are survivors who solely rely on long loops, rather than mind games, jukes, reads ect.
---
Hex
---
You know, I don't think the nazis would ban you from spamming racial slurs
---
A Dwight Fairfield Senior Prom Outfit would actually be a pretty dope cosmetic for dwight mains like me.
---
killer moonwalking their stain isn't an exploit
---
That means they activated frenzy and jumped that window to hit you that fast
---
I hope you aren’t above 10 hours. 
---
I get that you’re (hopefully) new, but to have these opinions means that you’re either new, or have never been at a relatively high rank. 
---
The game is killer sided until around rank 4 or 5, a little lower lately. Survivors have been getting better and haven’t been as high due to the rank changes.
---
It was confirmed. Ghostface is a paragraph but the devs messed up terminology and called him a chapter. 
---
This is on the devs not the wiki
---
Can we get a shirtless Mathieu?
---
Why would someone buy a dildo that's part hand
---
I agree, dear lord yes we do, have my upvote.
---
“Unfairly downed” sounds like you’re an utter crybaby. 
---
When your precious unplug ability gets taken away, it’s gonna be a bad time for you. I can sense the salty posts in a few months.
---
Most of the bullshit loops usually have at least 2 windows...which is basically why it is bullshit in the first place!
---
It completely ruins the experience of the game when your getting down from the most bs hits so I think its something that you can complain about.
---
There’s still a reason to patrol even if survivors aren’t on gens. You’re right that they may go immersive. Just pair it with Whispers and that will help in those occurrences. 
---
And yeah, lots of people do hide, sure, but I’d say that most matches, there’s at least someone who will stay on a gen, especially if it’s almost finished. Not to mention, the reason it lasts for 16 seconds and not more is that very reason - you’re implying that survivors that are blocked from gens will rush in to save. 16 seconds isn’t that long. If the killer were to go to a gen that’s progressed but blocked off, you know someone is probably nearby so it does serve a tracking purpose for observant killers. 
---
Half the game for killer is not knowing where everyone is. It’s a high-risk game that way. I totally get the points you’re making but I don’t think most killers would camp. I think all the gens going white is not going to happen all that often. Heck, if you go nuts and run BBQ, Iron Maiden, and this new perk, you will find someone after every hook. No auras? Well, they’re all next to you. And if it does turn out that the gens all go white more often than not, heck, treat it like a brief Hex Ruin and take the risk to find another survivor. Borrowed Time is rampant anyway. You may find one and get double hooks or they may get rescued while you find no one. That’s literally just the way the game is.
---
Wasn't F teir persay, but was unargueably the worst killer in the game.
---
I don’t think they mean identity V, this is the DBD roadmap
---
Stop both?
---
Iiiiiits..... saturday niiiight!!!!
---
Exactly my thoughts as a fellow Huntress main. I've only been playing killer for a bit tho, so probably not too well!
---
Well they're new maps on how you define maps, are the 5 autohaven maps different maps or 5 different "variations?"
---
Lmao
---
Just saw the time stamp, I thought this was just a well made edit for a joke... 
---
Oh my God it's coming
---
It’s odd that the sub can’t seem to get this. 
---
At face value the perk doesn’t encourage camping, but nobody thinks of the negatives. 
---
I would outright turn into a camper if I could do this.
---
Scary Terry costume when?
---
Well if its happening to you every game maybe you should just use the perk lol.
---
It’s worth it to dc and ruin the other survivors time? Yeah that’s so fucking worth it.
---
Honestly ruin is a crutch for crap killers who cannot put pressure on survivors doing gens, I’d much rather have that alot for something that can’t be taken out of my use within 30 seconds of beginning trial
---
Oh god please no, from the description of his powers on the stream he seems like he's going to be extremely weak already
---
Why though?
---
Im a killer main and i suck at survivor and theres one tile on autohaven i think. Its the big building that looks like a garage, not the gas station. You leap in the building through a window then run out the other window, you quite literally break chase by looping the building doing that so they never get passed bloodlust 1 before they lose it. Its not QUITE infinitebut its a good 3-5 minutes of PERFECT killer play to catch up. If its a huntress, there is NOTHING she can do about it.
---
There’s 4 other people in the game, you know. Selfish move!
---
You mean you don't like the measly 6 legendary skins, no emotes, and maybe 1 highlight intro? All on top of the same event we've been playing since 2016?
---
No worries
---
David cause his grunts are hilarious.
---
It's ever game I'm the sole survivor. That's not often enough to just flat out run it 100% of the time.
---
So, you didn't participate then?
---
Fucking kek
---
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT
---
You’re an interesting guy apparently
---
My thing is, when will killers get emotes?
---
Im aware
---
Interesting
---
Yea no, as stated a survivor doesn’t amount up to a killer, again, survivors are just skins with perks, no reason to add more survivors, ALSO there’s currently 17 survivors to the 15 killers, so of course they going to skip survivors
---
was he stuck in that locker for three hours? god damn
---
I watch Noob3, and this is about as accurate as can be.
---
My experiences must just be one sided so far. Ive put about a week into this, around four or lower hours a day, so probably under 20, but still, I just really like the hunt more.
---
As long as haddonfield is a thing I will keep doing I don’t care
---
Its even more selfish for someone to play killer when they know they have a horrible connection.
---
In the past few months this subreddit has visibly shifted from pro-killer to pro-survivor and I don’t know what drew that line but it’s pretty interesting.
---
Forgive me. XD

Someone always has to try and justify it. No, it's not that, and it's not latency either. It's shitty game design, that's all.
---
Killer: Survivors get too many chances to out play the killer.

Proceeds to outspeed the survivor, face camp, and tunnel.
---
Give me Robert's face on Freddy and I will play him at least five times a day. Can't even see his face while playing as him, but at least I'll know I'm playing as the real deal.
---
Well there supposed to bre op, would you want a shitty add on that was hard as hell to get?
---
If they follow their same pattern for releasing chapters and mid-chapters, then the mid-chapter Freddy rework PTB will be on the the 16th of July and will be released on the 30th of July.
---
From what I can tell, the 60 seconds is Microsleep, which is kinda like the transition with him flickering, except he can diddle you without penalty
---
Exclusivities doesn't mean exclusive items.
---
32,000*
---
Were you standing right next to the hooked Survivor?
---
Sounds kinda fun tbh, I'm guessing everyone hates playing a survivor against it then
---
The hook system by itself is the main reason why people disconnect. We're in an era of quickplay. We want a game now and we want it short with no wait time. Take a look at how fast paced Fortnite is and how popular it is, people dont want to sit still stuck on a hook until MAYBE a team mate will come unhook you
---
I want you to watch that video again, when hit, he goes into that (I do t remover what it’s called but it’s like borrowed time with the health bar) that literally means, they went feral frenzy and jumped that window and hit you, don’t be mad because you thought that the killer should let you escape
---
Yeah. It was the only way to keep people off him/her.
---
If I wandered off people just unhook em.
---
Enduring, Brutal Strength, and Spirit Fury are 3 perks that when combined (usually Enduring and SF) really shorten loops. For most killers, I think it’s usually better to not respect pallets. With perks like those, you can swing with confidence through pallets and if you get stunned, it’s no major loss of time. When SF is activated, you’ll usually still get the hit. 
---
I also break pretty much every pallet as killer, I don’t bother trying to save the couple seconds it takes to break it, as it usually bites me later. Alternatively, if the loop is unsafe (rather small), you can Bloodlust them. Basically just corner them from side to side so they keep vaulting back and forth, and eventually you will be faster than they are. 
---
What killer(s) do you enjoy the most? (:
---
So they were swarming around you trying to unhook them instantly?
---
Were you playing Leatherface? cuz thats just in there nature to do that.
---
9/10 times that's what happens.
---
They didn't go into too much detail about it but they did briefly mention that seasons will be longer (2-3 months is my guess) and that ranks will be determined for killers by comparing them to the same killer, rather than by how well survivors do.
---
That’s your fault when you could have looked at the connection to begin with. 
---
Now if it’s lagswitching it makes sense but still I would stay. This game is a team oriented game not a selfish ima dc because something unfair happened to me. Which you’re playing with 3 other people who have to endure your dc which makes the game a lot more hard on the others. 
---
People don’t really survive the 3v1.
---
What you don’t get is that they’d never do that for the reason someone stated above - killers actually effect the gameplay. A survivor is literally just a skin so it doesn’t matter. Killers effect how the killer plays AND how survivors play against them. Look at this way- even if you’re a survivor main only you’re still getting more variety in your gameplay with someone new to play against.
---
I really appreciate the tips and response! I like The Pig, The Wraith, and Myers so far!!
---
Kung Fu this, bitch!
---
LOOPING IS NOT TOXIC, ITS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FUCKING SURVIVE. I KNOW ITS NOT RAGE WEDNESDAY, BUT FUCK IT.
---
Here, you’ve earned your upvote. 
---
Though it seems a bit OP. 
---
Might wanna add that it applies Exhaustion for the match as well. 😂
---
Don't even have him as an option yet.
---
Rip i really need that for adept rn
---
Your fine then, some survivors are idiots that think instantly rushing the hooked survivor while the killer is still there means he’s face camping
---
I think he's implying that the reason people are so toxic is because they aren't really having fun, and the reason they aren't really having fun is because the game isn't actually fun.   
---
  
---
My counter theory would be this: toxic salty whiners exist in every difficult game because some people are very talented at blaming other people and systems or literally anything else before they reflect on how they could improve as a person or a player.
---
In that case the killer speed should be dropped to 100. The circle jerk continues.
---
Great now I'm imagining the entity grabbing some fruit loops in Walmart!
---
I only leave it open to gauge the in media raizes sentiment.   But events like this are plotted beat by and beat &amp; rarely faulter from form.  Even big gameplay only channels more often than not keep to a rather 'predictable' structure where the only Godhonest interaction chance you have is through donation or subscription alerts.
---
It's why I migrate towards smaller chats.  I get to interact with the streamer and have a true sense of community.
---
the dead by daylight twitter account liked this
---
Halo 2 was where I started my online gaming none of those compare to the sheer stupidity of twitch chat. Anyone who finds that shit amusing needs help or a fully developed brain
---
My Freddy is BBQ, Enduring, SF, and Ruin.
---
Also if you’re new to the game a type of camping I like to call is Proximity Camping. It’s where you aren’t necessarily camping them but you are keeping your heartbeat in there radius and checking them constantly so you can get another free down.
---
Only time I don’t get mad at those is when the killer knew someone was around to which I accused 1 guy and he told me, then I apologized said gg have a great day.
---
They want you to stand still and take it.
---
I’m colourblind
---
theyre probably not going to change anything about it unfortunately
---
Yes we very much do. You seem to be new here so welcome. This is the internet. Now if you'll excuse me I'll be over here harming myself for mommy's attention.
---
[WAZZUP](https://tenor.com/3ZcG.gif)
---
Hes not saying its twitch chat to excuse them. Hes saying its twitch chat because it happens in literally every big stream of any event for any game. Its not exclusive to DbD players. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if a ton of the spam were from people who have never played the game before, saw a large stream, and then proceeded to spam racial slurs. Twitch chat itself should just be turned off for any events like that.
---
They are. That's literally what this post is saying.
---
what kind of malls do you go to? that was a home depot
---
I wanna see clips of Ace at a bar seducing girls. The Chad needs a cinematic backstory.
---
And Myers is just... myers... he just appeared
---
Why you bully me?
---
Why can't it be Ghostface stalking?
---
A good ~60% of the twitch chat comments were being deleted consistently throughout the stream as mods were deleting rude comments, as a lot of messages were insults and spam-- but a large amount of deleted messages were deleted for whatever reasons. Any message not in English was deleted, as well as any message naming noob3, puppers, and other misc random things really. Many seem to think the moderators were having a power trip as it felt like you could get deleted for saying anything really.
---
Falling asleep allows you to confuse survivors with fake pallets and use dream snares (traps of some sort) to hinder their movement. Survivors can actually interact with the pallets but they just explode into blood. The fact they can interact with the fake pallets makes it so they’re stuck in animation, so you can get a hit on them.
---
I know im just agreeing with the meme dude
---
I don't see the problem here. The killer isn't keeping the game hostage, since there will be a definitive end (the survivor dying at the end of the timer). 
---
&gt;Being forced to sit there and wait 4-5 minutes only for the amusement of the killer is ridiculous.
---
This, and the change at the end as a whole, sounds more spiteful than anything else.
---
Can confirm, I love him the way he is
---
Oh why it’s seem bad is because it’s a cheap way to climb ranks while totally ruining the fun from another person. Just like purposely tunneling others. 
---
The whole point of the game is to get bloodpoints and pop so camping makes it to where one players whole game is staying on the hook getting rescued getting hit a few seconds later and hung. 
---
That’s why camping is typically looked down upon, unless you have a good reason which there’s usually not much.
---
Went from slowing the game down by making people spend time waking each other up, to slowing the game down by making sure no one wants to be anywhere near the gens.
---
Of course! (:
---
Pig is actually quite good at ending loops with some practice! Depending on the map, some loop walls are high enough that she can crouch unseen and use her ambush attack to fake out the survivor. It’s a 50/50 shot but some good listening for vault sounds and you can catch them off guard. 
---
Wraith can get stomped quite easily with pallets but he does have some add-ons that can help. I forget what they are called (Shadow Dance maybe?) but they do something along the lines of allowing him to perform actions quicker when cloaked, including breaking pallets. Don’t be afraid to combine that with an add-on for faster reappearance and follow someone cloaked. Get real close and when there’s no nearby pallets, uncloak, and use that speed boost to get the hit. Combining this with perks like Brutal Strength and heck, even Fire Up if you wanna go mad with it, can be a strategy that really throws people off. I’ve used it with varied success and even had one 4K match where I was able to basically eliminate most of the pallets within the first few minutes of game. You get a nervous survivor and it can be a goldmine.
---
I don’t have a ton of experience w my poor Myers, sadly, but mannnnny people swear by Enduring/Spirit Fury with him. Get that Tier 3 just about ready, get on a survivor’s butthole with SF ready to go, and get that instadown. (: 
---
Are you playing on PC or console?
---
Freddy work is in the mid chapter of 12 so its about the same timeline as Ash coming in after Plague
---
If u lose frequently or rank reset
---
Thanks and definitely; it does seem a bit OP.
---
Its basically a separate set of challenges and when completed gives you items and more lore information
---
If they fuck up the loop system at all I imagine alot of survivor mains are gonna stop playing the game
---
Come on you've never looped the shack window and then tryed to window juke the killer just to realize they have bamboozle?
---
You can’t see blood when phasing.
---
It's terrible as killer as well. Theres way too much shit to hide in and hide behind.
---
whats wrong with dwight?
---
Depends on a killer. For hag and trapper it's a must, they need time to set up. For billy, spirit, nurse they can do fine without it.
---
True
---
I must be good then, I rank 1 with Trapper all the time.
---
school girl
---
Watch ohTofu for tips on killers and Ulyssis for survivor. Also watch the 3 year anniversary stream to get caught up on stuff
---
You are awesome!!!! Thsnk you, lol. I'm on ps4
---
Freddy’s Rework: https://reddit.app.link/bIpTC1ZG9W
---
Ghostface Perks:
---
I’m All Ears: When a survivor performs a rushed action outside your terror radius, you see their aura for 6 seconds.
---
Thrilling Tremors: Whenever you interrupt a survivor’s action (grab them off a gen/totem/chest) all generators that aren’t being worked on are blocked for 16 seconds. Blocked generators are shown in white.
---
Furtive Chase: You became obsessed with one survivor. Each time you hook your obsession, your terror radius is decreased by (can’t remember)
---
The sub is in full on Hype mode, unfortunately.
---
I've been trying to tell people that the Freddy Rework, on paper, isn't as good as it sounds, but people don't believe me. Teleporting to Gens is amazing for getting around the map, but outside of that he sounds like a very bad Trapper.
---
I mean this is absolutely the wrong style of thinking. You can't say a issue is just one person being spiteful. That's the kind of logic people used to have about d-strike. Things can be problems and people can call them out. I'm sure by your flair for stacks (assuming you mean BBQ and chilli) and your defense of killers you can understand disliking the old d-strike. 
---
I'm not saying my idea is perfect. Sure their maybe a better way of handling this mechanic. But there is no real way to deny this isn't flat out bming. If a killer can pick you up and kill you to end a game (and I even accounted for the d-strike by specifiying after 1 minute) and they choose not to, and make you wait that absolutely is the definition of holding you hostage. By the logic you said that "it would eventually end"  you can say no game was ever held hostage since all games will eventually end.
---
His perks are really just not that useful when you get past like rank 17. At that point all of his perks can be replaced with game sense and just knowing how the game works
---
Show some School Spirit
---
Ok,but I hope the teleport part it's an add-on
---
The shit people's deemed as being a toxic
---
Isn't
---
Seems like killer Mains are just sensitive.
---
I mean /shrug I feel like a fake pallet is a fake pallet you're getting a hit if they thinjt thysyre running through a doc pallet too.
---
School girl because you can buy the other one with shards.
---
"duude"
---
Atleast your username is appropriate for the game.
---
You are in for a very rude awakening my friend.
---
Hey! I posted this post and I'm not a dev, but I'll help you out. You should send a ticket to the devs at https://support.deadbydaylight.com
---
Make sure you specify to them whether it was an Auric Cell purchase or a Steam/PS Store/Xbox Marketplace DLC purchase because that's probably important :)
---
Remember kids: If it isn't 100% in the killers favor, Behavior will change it to be in their favor.
---
Pancake reveal before the foot reveal 😢😭
---
Fastest hand in the west
---
Well thanks for the downvotes, and Ill play until I get there. Thanks for being such a clear cut community.
---
Beat me off to it.
---
* randomly drops god pallet*
---
You’re playing the game correctly then. 
---
The only problem is that the survivors are too. You’ll get to a point where you’re chasing someone around a piece of wood for a while.
---
The Plague
---
those are just my initials but lmfao☠️
---
You responded to me. 
---
Not them.
---
But there was never an infinite window loop? After three or so times a barrier pops up that prevents vaulting
---
Best advice I ever give anyone new is just don’t get too frustrated. Sounds like you’ve already got that covered. I watch a ton of YouTube and twitch to learn mindgames and tactics. It’s helped me out immensely. Eventually you’ll learn when you give up on a survivor that’s looping, or how to mindgame properly. Don’t give up, don’t get angry, and keep learning.
---
School girl.
---
Gotta see how it’s implemented. 
---
I think it sounds good.
---
Well, Ive yet to get there. Ive had a couple try, but they usually fail at it and I let them run and try to learn a little. 
---
Im just trying to enjoy my learning curve.
---
If you spend a minute or two on a single chase in ranks 1-8 all 4 survivors will escape with ease
---
Huntress with no hatchets
---
LMAO
---
Anime
---
That's fine though. If that's how they want to do it then I wont participate in the game. Those two key features will make or break it for me. I'm not holding my breath I also dont have a lot of faith in any big franchise I like because I'm always let down. But if they do decide to do it in a manor that I see as acceptable then it will really solidify my respect for them. Yanking us to a new platform to rebuy DLC will not cut it. As far as I know I havent seen any mobile games that would allow someone to move stuff from a console.
---
He and Patricia make a cute couple
---
How so? She is pretty mediorce in everything and doesn't fall flat on stuff IMO.
---
Whoopsies.
---
Well, I am not nearly there, so im fine for some time, with my slow hunts and frequent long matches. Survivors get to enjoy themselves in the eerie chases I try to provide, and I get to enjoy the chase too.
---
Aw shit you right
---
Leatherface is arguably the worst killer in the game. His power is complete dog shit. 
---
You basically have to master camping to get any benefit out of him.
---
What even
---
Dude stop, let me go
---
You’ll get there eventually.
---
Your “curve” is probably higher than where you’re currently at. 
---
You can probably get to rank 12/13 without having to know any tricky parts of chasing. You’ll start getting your ass kicked if you just follow survivors around starting rank 12. Unless your enjoyment is strictly around long chases, it wouldn’t be a great time.
---
I'm not sure why Puppers would be banned to be mentioned as I don't see what he ever did wrong, but Monto and No0b3 are pretty obvious as they're at fault for letting themselves get banned over little dumb things that wasn't even a big deal in terms of exploits and now because of that the Devs don't want to ever forgive them
---
“Oh my god that’s a reach!”
---
????
---
Plenty of other choices. Doctor. Pig. Cannibal.
---
Back to rank 20 you go!
---
Again, that is my plan. Hunt for a while, entertain them a little, and usually, kill those who stay far too long.
---
Was gonna ask r/whyweretheyfilming
---
hey if you kill me im leaving
---
Honestly would say Plague but that could go bad and Susie's 16 so yeah not touching that. I would say as much as this pains I would say Pig. For mean I'd say Clown because he is Dummy Thick
---
Also a good starting survivor for a new person I would say is meg. 2 good enough perks to help. 
---
Killer is hard to say who to start with because it’s all on what playstyle you like. 
---
But Billy, Nurse (on pc mostly) and Spirit are the top three. 
---
Michael is really fun but can be very punishing so I wouldn’t recommend starting off the bat with him. Get everything down first and the feel of the game then try Michael.
---
How do the devs mess up their own terminology? They stated that a chapter can refer to just a single character.
---
It brought attention to the grind which is the problem. Battle Passes feel a lot more like work as a result of the fact that it highlights the grind. In Warframe the game is all one huge grind to get the shit you want until you get the new shit that comes out that you want, which means that every other mechanic exists to cover that up: The mission types are predictable yet varied, all the guns are fun to shoot, great mobility options hide how 2D the maps are, even the crafting, trading and wait timers feed back into the grind as you often times don't have a true "Value" for what you are getting as the true value of each thing is highly complicated by needing hundreds of random ingredients to craft a thing, breaking all that grind down, visually, in a very 2D way, kills a lot of the attempts to hide it. 
---
DbD has none of those things and the game is still a massive grind so I can't imagine a battle pass going off without much complaining.
---
Fair enough
---
No one runs Rancor.
---
Infinite is used in this sub to describe a loop that is so long it might as well be. If you've ever tried to chase a surv who knows what they're doing around one you would know
---
As a partial leatherface Main I kinda agree but disagree because I like him so damn much
---
Gg EzY i TrAP kIlLeR dEvS wHy U bAn Me HeRe 100 BiTs
---
What do you mean they’re not working? You need to be on either side to throw them. Is the throw button showing and when you press it, you won’t throw it down?
---
It is because it points out that the whole game is a grind, and most people hate obvious grinding. Warframe is only as fun as you can ignore the fact the whole thing is a grind which is also how DbD works.
---
Oh my go just no
---
Oof, I didn’t know Susies age till now... 
---
Wiping that under the rug ya! Amanda seems like a muderous bondage loving gal
---
And for Plague... as long as the infections on her face we good.
---
PLEASE AHHHH
---
Oh my god that comment has been used, try another.
---
Because waiting sucks and the prices are extortive.
---
Omg I just saw that part,so beautiful
---
watch the clip again. there was not enough time for a vault and a hit to take place. even with feral frenzy.
---
True, but the difference is with a doc pallet, they can Dead hard to avoid the hit, and if you whiff they might be able to make it a window or another loop. At least with Dream Pallets, they’re locked in an animation so they can’t use DH.
---
Because it's just a picture of text which could easily just be a text post but it's not so it get can karma
---
I like Freddy's bloodied glove but from the leaks Ghost face has the least sloppy bloodied set plus his mask has blood under the eyes that makes it look like he's crying blood.so your answer is ghost face i guess
---
Mostly agree, but they *are*  fun, IMO. I think Thrilling Tremors will be at least decent, especially when combined with perks like Surveillance and Pop Goes The Weasel.  
---
Furtive Chase seems quite fun, especially when you think about what opportunities it could enable. Obviously against top tier players this will matter less (most things do), but chasing someone with a smaller terror radius could, for example, give a false sense of security to heal, exposing themselves to A Nurse's Calling. Again, not meta in any stretch, but fun to play around with.
---
It's also fun to think about is how it will interact with Monitor and Abuse. Once fully stacked (which that part admittedly sucks), the combined effects means a given killer's terror radius is reduced by 8m at all times, -8m outside of a chase by M&amp;M and -16m \[Furtive\] + 8m \[M&amp;M\] = -8m in a chase. M&amp;M's reduction \*outside\* of the chase is obviously more useful, but it's still neat.
---
i usually go for either leatherface, prayer bead spirit, instadown clown, 3 gen strat doctor, or iridescent head huntress just to try to piss them off as much as possible. oh, and bring an ebony mori
---
You can fill it in. You can type custom text after selecting a flair.
---
What's the origin of im boutta head out?
---
I mean dude what did you expect, you played the game at very low ranks, didnt do any research and posted a bitching fest about problems that did not exsist. Maybe try asking where your going wrong rather than just ranting the game is broken
---
I mean 16 is legal in Canada so yeah I guess if you move there the FBI won't get ya. I don't really look at the NSFW side often but yeah Amanda needs more and maybe Plague if it doesn't involve disease.
---
Damn I don’t know how to feel about it
---
Let's be real, iridescent add-ons in this game are just poorly designed. Instead of providing OP shit, they should alter the mechanic of an ability instead. Shake things up, not make them broken and unfun on the receiving end.
---
Anytime someone fails a skill check I just point at them to make fun of them. It's like I'm calling them out  for sucking. Or like I'm pointing at them at laughing at them. Sometimes I'll be able to do it often enough that the other survivors will catch on and do it with me (or at me if I fuck up too)
---
Better comment. 
---
Yes, my post was uneducated, hence me coming to be educated.
---
so?
---
I think the Brand New Part or the Mint Rag are some of the best Iridescent add ons in the entire game. They both offer new abilities that aren't inherently overwhelming
---
Than they need to grow a pair if random people who they will NEVER meet affect them to that extent. Change my mind 😜😜😜😜
---
Why are people downvoting this?
---
I mean, it was just surprising. I went from a party on xbox of survivors who were enjoying our roleplay to 'YoURe NEw ArENt yoU bITcH lEaRn to LOOOOOOP'
---
I second that notion is the saying
---
but I second that emotion is a futurama episode
---
Same reason people rage message on console. 
---
Mad they got beat.
---
Sheltered have to be changed, if they changing survivor favorived maps, balance and change killer favorived maps too. Survivors getting nothing but nerfs since I started playing and it's getting pretty frustrating.
---
Lol the game is only like that depending on your playstyle. If you play immersed survivor, the game becomes a game of hide and seek. Same also with just playing meme builds that are based on dumb shit, like Full Sabo builds. 
---
Only reason the game feels like the way it does now is because Pallets and loops are the only reliable defense survivors have against killers due to all the perks that reveal survivor locations. (Seriously, there are a metric fuck ton of perks for killers that are great for finding immersed survivors.) Add that with the new ranking system that generally doesn't reward anything past a meta playstyle on survivor the higher you get (And pretty much relies on survivors farming each other for a pip) and you get the current game. (And yes, I know the Meta build was still popular before the rank changes, but with them changing the rankinh system so heavily like that, it pretty much completely limits the ways a survivor can play and still pip.)
---
Dumb Me: it isnt that much progre- 
---
Realization me: Goddamn thats clever
---
They just announced today! Dedicated servers go live June 18th. *butt wiggle*
---
How has this been posted so many times? Do people just not care anymore?
---
I play on both sides but mostly play on survivor side and imo the toxic things are t bagging, using that goddamn flashlight on every loop and gen rushing...
---
Another thing, shit takes time to change. Nothing happens over night and anyone that tells you otherwise is a goddamn liar. I didn't plan on coming on Reddit to give a speech to some kids but here we are. Now if I may, I'm gonna head on back to shit posts and telling people to go kamikaze themselves into a propane tank with a car.
---
So just quick question, what is ghostface’s power?
---
Doc, Huntress, and Nurse are all really hard because of the frame rate still
---
i’m not denying it was a frenzy hit lol. it shouldn’t have hit me in the first place is the point.
---
If soccer fans had twitch chat instead of being at a stadium I'm pretty sure the chat would actually be worse
---
Lol nice try his pink addon will be without a doubt, 
---
You can determine the progression of gens by the intensity of they're aura.
---
*fat shaming
---
You know it’s a repost dude why are you posting it. You literally commented on the original one.
---
They're saying we're all getting fucked.
---
i'll bet its a lisenced killer
---
PLEEEZ!
---
STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM MUH TOTEM!
---
Who was being “mean”?
---
I was one of the people on your last post. Most people were explaining how the game works or asking if you were new.
---
NO.
---
That is a terrible fitting suit.
---
Are you being chased by Freddy or Doc? Because their powers mess up your actions like throwing down pallets and window hopping.
---
Sorry you were victimized by reality. A lot of DBD players run on cunt fumes and hatred.  You'll find occasional good, helpful people though.
---
New player?
---
If not, the shitpost tag is appropriate.
---
I'm also a soft bitch haha, I get how it is
---
Definitely a shitpost
---
Especially with EGC.
---
No not new, since release and rank 1 on both sides  killer is just so much easier than survivor.
---
twitch chat is toxic everywhere, i see nothing new here..
---
Tbh I think sometimes its pure attention. I played against a Myers yesterday and i spawned right on his totem so I start destroying it and he comes over and hits me off. 
---
I was more goofing around than playing serious so i meme'd and was standing there pointing at it like "hey man.. please?".
---
Of course he didn't give it to me and instead downed me, hooked me, and then for some reason camped me until I died lol.
---
I didn't really care and just left and moved on to the next game once I was dead. After the Next game though I noticed he commented on my steam profile "easiest 4k of my life"... like why?
---
Has to be for attention right? I didn't tbag, I wasn't there at the end to say anything to him, and I didn't even loop him since I stood there memeing lol.
---
I mean if you really think ducking is toxic that's a little sensitive.
---
Ah. 
---
So you’re a troll. Got it.
---
I don't think you understand what cuckoldry is.
---
He’s a troll.
---
You know, I really don't care for Will Farrell's comedy, he's just not funny to me.
---
As a voice actor? God damn is he phenomenal. I don't think I've seen an animated movie with him in it that I didn't like yet.
---
In a mostly toxic way. Seriously, look through the comments, not just yours. You were calm about it, a good chunk just started with "you have a lot to learn" and other smirky comments.
---
Personally think that a well coordinated group of survivors can oust any killer. Just my opinion.
---
killer main. only play survivor for daily's.
---
Start saving up now. I have 1mill saved, 4k shards to buy perks i own from the shrine and i'm gonna save up 3 dailies. That's easily 1,300,000m bp there
---
For survivor When I first got the game I was trash at being in a chase so in my experience I would recommend urban evasion and being stealthy
---
Look at his name. A troll and a deceiver.
---
Alright. Now let's have some sanity and help decrease tunneling and camping that hinder the experience for everybody
---
Or we just be insane and play with a tunneler and campers every god damn match and think " yep that's how the game was intended. Just stack odds against survivors in every way possible "
---
Yes!!! I didnt see anyone talking about them! I loved them. The female guitarist was going all out in the beginning!
---
I feel the same way. I want so bad to play trapper but 90% of the time survivors seek out my traps and disarm them no matter where I put them. even spots that I've seen to be somewhat effective the survivors never seem to fall for them.
---
What am I changing your mind about? Why am I being tasked with changing your mind? I don’t fucking care about your mind. You’re missing an incredibly large piece of the story where someone asked if OP was okay and he said “no”. There’s no joke there, homie. I’m so sorry that human empathy completely destroys your world. You telling your depressed friends to kill themselves, while pretty vile behavior, is probably fine because *theyre your friends*. Do you know OP personally? If not then shut the fuck up and let me be nice to someone for the sake of being nice to someone.
---
As if they are gonna nerf killers lmao 😂😂
---
Then*
---
Yes she was!! Super talented, all of them. The best one was the Ghostface store music, baha.
---
I don’t know. I don’t think so.  The blood is a visual clue that he’s coming, tinkerer is sound. 
---
Though, you can cancel your ability it would make for good mind games and literally push the survivors towards you. 
---
But I’m under the impression it’s his lullaby that’s the terror radius. Who knows if tinkerer will take that away.
---
kate, i like her bloody hair.
---
Honestly you’re probably right. I think a lot of players in this game have weirdly large egos that they just wanna mash in people’s faces.
---
This sounds like way too much and very complicated. The extra, guaranteed way to wake up is also bullshit, especially since it's yet another thing that nullifies a stealth killer's stealth (much like Pig's Jigsaw boxes alert everyone on the map that the killer is Pig before they even see her).
---
Or how about if there's only one survivor left, being downed doesn't put the EGC timer into slowdown mode. Seems much less complicated as far as solutions go, and reduces the maximum wait time to 2 minutes.
---
Now I imagine a Dwight  going insane with a hatchet murdering  all the killers
---
Reddit jumps on the uniformed/ignorant. 
---
And salt/rant flairs will inevitably draw salt from other people for whatever reason. Probably due to the fact that people tend to speak about the overall game state after one bad game. 
---
I would try to pose your “moral dilemma” as an actual question next time rather than the objective statement you made.
---
I used to main legion until I got spirit.
---
Groovy answer
---
Either you havent left rank 15 yet, or you're a trash survivor. Good survivors are the real killers of rank 1 games.
---
I don't understand what scummy about it? Has devs agreed and called it scummy?  Or is it killers bitching only?
---
And what's a good loop and a non scummy loop? And how is a survivor supposed to survive then?  Where is the proper handbook on how a survivor is supposed to act?
---
I have so many questions lol
---
YES
---
Oh another nerf to pallet looping?  When will it end, when pallets are removed entirely?
---
#ENGLISH ONLY
---
I love that! I was planning to go with the normal ones but your idea is much cooler, I'll keep it in mind. There's no way I'm happy with the normal ones after your idea!
---
I can't tell them to go away, I was a baby survivor once too! I'll just make sure the killer hooks me and leaves the newbie gets away
---
The PLAG gets no love, dude. :(
---
Doctor? Seriously?

r/unexpectedscp
---
That's looks like David's Christmas sweater to me.
---
What i read in this community is that they want ti make all loops shorter und more unsafe.
---
Ah, the beginning days when the game is scary... Before I realized that many times the killer has about the same idea of what to do as you do, or less, and how predictable they are.
---
Believe me, many people agree with you, unfortunately your opinion is being downvoted as many SWF players are threatened by the idea that they won’t be able to cheat at the game if sentiments like this gain more traction.
---
Get a brain. There was a split second between when she vaulted and when the hit took place. There was not enough time for the killer to vault after her even with frenzy. It's bullshit hitboxes. Give it up and face the facts.
---
Doctor is horrible.
---
No man that’s not it at all. Watch the stream bro, they don’t want to change anything except unfair loops. When they remove they even want to add more unique loop tiles
---
Almost the entire sub acknowledges that
---
Her traps are useless after 5 gens are finished.
---
LORE UPDAAAAAAATES!
---
Baby Claudette is my new favorite thing.
---
I get this a lot as survivor and killer, but mostly as survivor with a camping Huntress. :(
---
reminds me of the ol' dildo in the campfire back from 2016
---
Huntress, I'm really good with her
---
At inexperienced ranks, the killers can feel very oppressive. I highly recommend watching some streamers. Pay attention to how they approach situations, and learn about the killers without having the pain of learning as they're killing you. 
---
As with most pvp games, a huge factor to long term success is map knowledge and that will only come with time and practice. The more you play the better you get at instinctively knowing where pallets are and if you've already thrown/seen others throw the ones near you (making that area significantly more unsafe and not a good area to lead the killer towards). You'll learn likely totems spawns making it easier to get out from under the pain of killer perks like ruin, noed, lullaby, devour hope. You'll get better at efficiently finding generators, I remember my first hours how many matches I pissed away because after the team had finished 2-3 gens I spun my wheels endlessly not being able to find the not yet completed gens. 
---
I find that watching streamers helps with the learning curve without the frustration of losing every match built in. Also, don't just watch survivors watch killers too! It's really helpful to know the mindsets people have as killer. Things like if you're getting chased by a hag or trapper and it feels like they're trying to herd you in a direction, they're probably steering you into one of their traps or if you're the obsession and the killer is avoiding you it's probably because they've got a perk like rancor or save the best for last which gives them benefit to not going after you early in the game.
---
Trapper is my favorite killer (I am a survivor main), and I don’t agree that he is the worst killer, but I do think he is one of the most easily counter-able killers in game. 
---
Playing as and against him, I don’t know. I don’t think he needs a rework or anything but he definitely needs some help.
---
Just keep playing and you’ll eventually get better.  You just need practice. You’ll start dying every match and not get any kills. Then you’ll get one sacrifice and escape every once in a while. And before you know it you’ll do just fine. And don’t be discouraged by the toxicity. In my experience it’s only present at some ranks. Just have fun and ignore salty messages.
---
How funny is it that the people are complaining the most about this system is people who have been around with the game for a year or less. However veteran players are excited about new content.   
---
# 🤔

---
He has to stalk you for 4 secs to get an insta down on you for the next 20 secs (no survivor can look at him while he is stalking tho or otherwise his ability goes off and goes on a cooldown) he cal also lean against objects and crouch at normal speed while loosing his red stain
---
Is that not what the paid DlC's essentially do? As well as $10usd cosmetic sets? They obviously already have a monetization for this game, and a quite effective one as I see more players with cosmetics then without. They even abandoned ship on their other project to solely focus on where they already have that monetization. 
---
Literally everyone saying you can just ignore a battle pass is completely wrong in this instance, as it is now being implemented into the newly found "Archives" aka story. 
---
Down vote all you want, but a prominent part of this reddit is it is a DBD community, so don't expect anyone to hold off outrage when this is one of the few places to do so.  
---
Y'all cry like children about people crying like children when really it is just the same old routine of buisness putting monetary gain over quality of the game, they may not be as big as EA, but to act as though they have lost any money throughout their financial venture is just laughable.

On paper he sounds really scary, I hope that translates well to actual gameplay.

Uno, dos hijo de tu puta madre estoy mamadísimo.
---
I can't agree with the phrase "if it makes you angry it's toxic" it really isn't. You're seemingly just letting it affect you too much. You can still follow them and hit them so I dont see the problem.
---
Damn I can't wait for DC punishment....
---
Ya'll want to put us through a bunch of bullshit stacking second chance perks, you can eat your bad maps and frustrating builds and like it.
---
I feel really bad for Bhvr to have these people in the twitch chat. But let's be honest, demanding for these fools' ages won't change.
---
I don't know about the moderator scene, but are there bots to identify awful comments and put communication bans on these users?
---
It was a very pretentious post, and whiny.

“It is usually “”””””The Doctor”””””” bro just call him Big Herman

I noticed he puts the *same* scream in almost all of his videos.  It's a near ear-rape screech from a Male streamer that's in every single one.  It drives you crazy when you start to pick up on it.

Wow, prick

*Insert Your Lie in April-Uso To Honto*
---
I feel you. I've got about 150 hours in, I'm loving it. Dome games I'll end the match with 0k and they'll all say gf and give me tips. Sometimes I'll get a 4k and they'll spam "ggez" and "go kys". That's just how people are on the internet. 
---
I just had a 4k where someone with Mither followed me down into the basement while I had a survivor. I got a double hook and low and behold the other two ran down. Needless to say it was a short match. A rank 8 proceeded to tell me how trash I was for camping...
---
YOU ALL CHOSE TO COME TO THIS PARTY! Lmao.

Just learning to shrug it off and play for your own fun will help you enjoy it a lot more. GL and HF friend.

Them I'll just die on hook. There is nothing devs can do to force me into playing a game against hostage doc or shaman prayer beads spirit.
---
He’s only shown his socks which is a tease
---
Bhvr devs get a lot of hate sometimes, so seeing positive posts like this does put a smile on my face.
---
How am I being a jackass? It is cheating to use external means of communication which is a common SWF tactic. Other players have confirmed that SWF groups are not fun to play against and would not willingly play against them. 
---
So what is wrong with his suggestion to better compensate killers for putting up with those premade groups? As long as the compensation was worth the misery of playing against SWF squads then the queue times will be just fine.
---
Someone doesn’t get it.
---
In all honesty it's probably too controversial, like it would be fun and cute, and I guess gay people, or, like hardcore supporters and such would buy it, but the assuming small amount of haters would cry until earth's end, and the game at this state cant afford to do controversial stuff, it needs players
---
Same, but I was talking Power and Perks as a joke?
---
Fungoose? What bud I think you are thinking of someone else man. Fungoose is one of the nicest people out there with great skill knowledge.
---
Also Nurse 2.0
---
Well kinda some of the perks are joke like X Gon Give It to Ya but the main charge ability would work good for him I think also the whole the more he gets stunned the more chance he has of losing his hat was also a joke
---
I remember that one survivor tried unhook yourself. Fungoose was going to save him, but after that he let him die.
---
The amount of billies and nurses at high ranks shows how weak killers are against loops even billy is weak against them but he can punish you so hard if you fuck up so he's top tier 
---
The problem with loops is that the whole game is based on them 
---
If you go to forums when a killer comes out , the first thing people talk about is if they are loopable or not and if they are , then they're mid tier at best if they aren't loopable they CAN be high tier 
---
There is no balance between hiding and chasing and most of the times survivong the chase is so easy thst people don't even wanna hide , people want killer to chase them BY THEIR CHOICE which shows how broken alot of loops are 
---
And as soon as a killer isn't loopable (nurse) they fail .  this is a great move from devs to promote some more risky gameplay 
---
It's crazy how safe people are at some certain loops that they aren't afraid to get hit at all 
---
With the changes , we'll have way more mindgames and a lil bit more skill in the game . they aren't nerfing anything , the budget is the same but they're making sure survivor feel more danger when they're in chase 
---
If they continue going this way the game will most likely gain players cause it will be more fun and balanced as much as i remember , after so many nerfs to killers after a balance came out players went from daily 10k to 25-30k 
---
Also , you're telling me breaking pallet is a counter to looping ? This shows you either never touched killer or have very low playtime as killer 
---
The whole problem here is that you can't break the pallets cause they have to be thrown down first and killer had to get near the survivor for them to throw it down , if killer could break pallets while they aren't thrown down then we'd have no loops 
---
In big safe loops like the ones they're removing . killer would have to waste so much time to get near the survivor just to get hit by a pallet and by the time they break it , survivor is teabagging at another safe pallet 
---
That was a problem and changing it is completely reasonable
---
( Sry for text wall btw)
---
I had to check if it was real LMAO
---
This fucking community is swear...
---
what about bIG DADDY
---
It’s not dead. Dbd team said they plan to work on the matchmaking. They had a live stream of all their development plans for the year and such. Things will get fixed. :) hold strong!
---
You're literally using a level 1 killer with no add-ons and no perks. What do you expect?
---
Trapper's add-ons are actually pretty solid all around, with being able to carry around and start with extra traps, increased setting speed, injured when disabling them, and a bunch of others. 
---
Traps are still powerful without add-ons, you just have to be smarter about where and how to place them. Because you don't have Hex: Ruin on Trapper or even Corrupt Intervention, you don't have the time you need to set up the traps at that rank. Also from the sounds of it, you're throwing traps all over the place instead of setting up a bunch of them around certain generators and patrolling those ones.
---
Also, lastly, traps don't have horrible hit boxes (well, they're not any worse than the rest of the hit boxes in the game), you're just placing them too far to one side. A properly placed trap can't be avoided except with Dead Hard. An improperly placed trap the survivors can just run past, and you've got a larger hitbox than they do.
---
I don't know but you're not alone
---
Thanks for the downvote lol. Anyways, calling a large amount of players "cheaters" is unnecessary. I'm not against compensation for killers against swf but to be totally honest, the balance continues to improve killer in a way that makes swf less and less of a problem. I do apologize for calling you a jackass. I just think comments like that are divisive and we already have to much division in this community :)
---
Have a good night/day.
---
I wish they'd change Haddonfield, I hate playing there as killer.
---
Which is fine for survivors because there are 20 safe pallets on the map. They do need to somehow include more windows though.
---
You're just too good
---
Indeed it is, couldn’t believe my eyes when it came on my feed
---
Spirit: love to play her, hate to play against her
---
Get past rank 10 as Killer.
---
Then you shall know pain
---
Literally the only reason I see as good is if you hook in basement, someone messes up right after and also goes in the basement. Then the other two run over and are plainly in sight as you come out of the basement.(I'm in yellow ranks so this tends to happen every once in a while.)
---
Other than that I'll camp someone that follows me flashlighting me and messing me up because they know I'm awful (which I am). By God if I manage to down you I'll take that 1k. This I do not consider a good reason (or tactically a good move) but it's more for me. lol
---
What?
---
I’m gonna report you
---
Ah, Rosie, I love this boy.
---
am i only Freddy main to not be excited with the given information?
---
School girl! I just bought her blue uniform and hair.
---
the geisha Spirit is very uncomfortable. her sleeves are wiggling, it's distracting.
---
Barbecue and Chili with a killer and We're gonna live forever with a survivor.
---
I too fell into a trap of outdated information and got Halloween edition because of Laurie's DS, then I read in-game description and was like 'Wait, how is THAT a must have, if it's so situational?'
---
You obviously have no clue as to what were talking about here. Loops like the window at iron works that if ran correctly can be ran so that all 5 gens will be done by the time the surv is caught. Literally any loop that isn't a mile long wall + a window and a pallet are not scummy.
---
What the fuck
---
YOU BETTER STOP
---
climb the ranks with facecamping? ahahahah, you seem like you haven't played for a very long time.
---
From what I can tell, it's just going to be Ghostface and the event.
---
I'm *hoping* the pallet changes are included, at least, but I very much doubt it.
---
This is what annoys me. Everything they announced sounds good, but too much of it is too far away, meaning the game is going to be same-old-same-old for quite a while yet.
---
Holy shit are you actually this stupid? First off I'm a survivor main, the only thing your comment proves is how bad and salty you are at dbd. The only person complaining about stuff here is you. "Infinite" loops should not be in the game. If you need to rely on these to survive you're shit
---
The escape rate is fairly low. I think that's a common misconception . People aren't escaping as often as you think, in fact they die 60-70% of the time (dependant on rank).
---
Secondly, play to get the most points instead of playing solely to make it out alive. Escaping should be a cherry on top. Don't be super stealthy as the game doesn't really reward you for that - go for the unhook, commit to gens, take hits so team mates can wiggle, loot a chest, be ballsy. If you made it out of the match with 20k points even if you die, still consider that a major win. 
---
What perks have you been using? Maybe there's a better build out there for your play style.
---
The look changes when you prestige? Dafuq? Just went P1 with Freddy and haven’t noticed anything? Guess I have to look again.
---
Leatherface and legion are debatably worse in my opinion.
---
Since when do they need to rework any of those add-ons you've mentioned
---
i mean yeah, there is no certainty there. i just don't like how the Dream world works now. it's not about gameplay, it's rp thing.
---
Think about it like first place in a competition. 1st place is the best while 20th is bad
---
For Pig, Rules Set No. 2 should be base.
---
Hopefully if we talk about the snares enough, they’ll become a base part of the kit.
---
And with deathgarden now too.  Seriously, thank you behaviour
---
Yasss
---
&gt; There is no challenge in playing a game against a Doctor with his Terror Radius covering the entire map while having to bring madness down from 3 every two or so minutes because the killer is just walking around with his fist closed.
---
You say you have to bring yourself down from Madness 3 every two or so minutes, but that's enough time to complete a generator and have time to spare. 
---
There are also several ways to combat Carter's Spark, as crouching reduces the rate in which you gain Madness as does being in a locker. 
---
&gt; There is no challenge in playing against a Spirit with silence and lightning speed phasing pulling people of totems or generators.
---
That's why you wait until she's in a chase to get on a Generator? Or run something like Spine Chill to know when she's looking at you? Spine Chill is probably one of the best perks you can run in the game if you're not some meta-slave. 
---
If you think either the Doctor or the Spirit are OP with these builds, why don't you try using them at high ranks? I'd love to watch you get destroyed by people who know what they're doing.
---
&gt; If you think these are "challenging scenarios", you are stupid or a troll. I'm sorry. These aren't fun for any of the 4 survivors, why should they play it?
---
To the first part, neither. I'm willing to figure out how to counter something and work it into my strategies. That is not stupid, and it certainly doesn't make me a troll.
---
To the second, what is stopping a Killer from DCing and wasting *every* survivors time, add-ons, and Offerings when the four of them are about to leave and just T-bagging at the door? It's not fun for the Killer, why should they allow it to happen? If you think its "fun" to have to chase every survivor seven times in order to finally secure the win, you're either stupid or a troll.
---
&gt; I have nothing to say about the first part of your comment because it is nothing but a shallow assumption based on nothing.
---
And yet it obviously struck a nerve.
---
&gt; Since we are in the assumption level, I bet you were one of those guys abusing double blade Legion just to make survivors life miserable.
---
Notta, never leveled Legion until after I heard about the rework coming out, and never got either blade add-on before I stopped leveling him. New Legion isn't my style yet, and Old Legion definitely wasn't.
---
Notice how I actually refuted your claim that I abused the Double Blade Mend glitch instead of you just dodging my claim that you're running MoM + Adrenaline + DS + Dead Hard? It's really quite telling.

If you really are fragile, I recommend clicking on the chat button in the post game chat to disable it.
---
This man is a national treasure
---
Wait I skimmed. Where the flying FUCK is he getting _teleporting_ from?
---
Claudette, as toxic as she is, deserves to be S tier.
---
Source: Vanilla who loves himself some Chocolate.
---
You’re all fine mate. The game isn’t as hard as it is in red ranks so people can be interested in the game. Unlike Darksouls god so many people complain that games hard or unfair. But that’s a different game for another time haha.
---
You must be new here.
---
Freddy doesn't.
---
YAAAAA!
---
They are fixing things for killers for a good year now, I wonder when they start to improve life for survivors too. Shelter woods and the game have to be remade, rotten fields should be just straight up deleted from a game.
---
Survivors now passively fall asleep every 60 seconds. They're reusing his "fall asleep" animation as a "point it at a gen to teleport to it after 5 seconds while blood and a Freddy 'husk' show up next to it".
---
We do know he can cancel it mid-channel, but we don't know if he has to stare at the generator until he teleports or if he can tag the gen, look around freely and cancel it whenever.
---
It's an awesome concept but I doubt it's going to happen just because of how much backlash some people are going to give it.
---
Hell there are some people who are still moaning and complaining about the whole soldier 76 being LGBT if they gave any hint that David might be in that pool I could imagine people flipping the lid about that too
---
I messed up the fingers a bit, but heres my poster of the Legion, enjoy!
---
not gonna lie I'd fuck ash no homo though he's legit just a hot man
---
Every day we stray farther from god’s light.
---
No it implies that toxic survivors can’t run around massive loops until the gates are opened
---
Youre a terror person
---
&gt;From all the material ive seen, may 31st was the only day they had promoting. This is the first time im seeing anything about june 18th
---
The release date was revealed here many days ago: [GHOST FACE....](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/65355/ghost-face-nintendo-switch-release-date-and-third-anniversary-livestream-news#latest)
---
But it looks like they edited out. Weird.
---
Jk 😂. Doctor pisses me off so much haha.
---
Inception. They think they are awake, but really they've been asleep the whole, and freddy is merely creating the illusion that they are falling deeper in slumber. Also it seems like he can hit anyone at any time, however his powers (pallet and snare) only will work when the survivor is asleep. Apparently you will know he is nearby as you will hear a heartbeat, but his song will play when you are asleep, probably with no indication of distance too. And my guess is regardless of state of sleep, you will also see blood pour out the gen when hes teleporting.
---
Imaginary.
---
His power seems super strong if you stay stealthy. But if you fail at that, he seems to be a basic M1 with small mind game potential
---
From what you are describing. They don't exist.
---
There is no perk in this game called "Haunted Grounds"
---
If he doesn't scream "wazzup" when peeking around corners I'll do it myself
---
Killing "only" used to be the killer's objective back in the day, during the victory cube. Not anymore (thankfully).
---
Isn’t bill like 70....
---
I don't really feel comfortable with that stance.
---
Not salty. There are ways around like gen rush. Flash lights. Borrowed time etc. But it shouldn't be a thing in the first place. There isn't any incentive to not camp or tunnel other than hey, don't be a dick. Which I never do cuz I am not. I give em a chance but if the persom I'm chasing runs to a hooked survivor and pulls then out. Well. I hope you have borrowed time.
---
This game isn't perfect. I just wish it could reach it's full potential.
---
"Husband, come back!"
---
You find that the only problem with this?
---
Understandable. :(
---
I hope whatever they do release is something you can come to enjoy as much or more as Old Freddy.
---
This
---
You have to consider that you won't actually get 16 seconds of use out of it. The timer will start when you start the pickup, during the animation you can't freely look around so you are limited by which generators you can see go white. If there are flashlights in the game you can't just position yourself to look in the direction of the generators freely because you might get blinded if you don't look at a wall. The drop animation takes time too. All that shaves off time from the actual use you can get out of it and bleedout timer is stopped for that duration too.
---
16 seconds is too low to do anything meaningful. On the plus side it has immunity to lockers, so that's cool.
---
I will never get tired of good Huntress plays. That was amazing.
---
If you got less than 20k as a killer, it's either you had a really bad game, or you got 4k quite quickly. Also, survivors DC really hurts your BP gain
---
A part of me kind of likes how he is now.. I’m nuts for admitting that out loud. But seriously. He’s not the absolute worst. Not as bad as the community makes it out to be. I feel confident with current Freddy. I’m afraid the rework will make him TOO good and everyone will be rushing to play Freddy. He’ll become meta. I have a weird thing where i enjoy playing the least popular/strong characters in each video game. So maybe that’s why I’m afraid to see him get the rework, knowing he’ll be leagues better lol.
---
I could imagine one of his addons makes it so blood does not show when hes teleporting to a gen. Couple that with Surveillance and you got a freddy with easy jump scare potential. Maybe an add on that makes it so for x seconds, he emits no terror/singing after a teleport
---
They are fixing probably all the issues you’re thinking of, but fixing multiple bugs takes time, so just wait. Every mid chapter patch fixes a whole lot of bugs, some you haven’t even encountered.
---
Judging by the username, much homo

twitch chat is this generations Woodstock, but for a longer period it appears. If I happen to "accidently" open the chat on some streams I often question myself if I live in the same world as some of these people.
---
Yep, this happened.
---
Yeah but he's bill
---
It’s not if they remove bloodlust and entity blocker.
---
What happened?
---
I bet I-am-fun-at-parties. Lol but for real I agree. It only slightly irritates me when I get my vision back to them teabagging me.
---
I just go down to the basement and chill.
---
The sleeves on the kimono one fuck me up. Idk I feel like it’s just me but when I’m chasing a survivor the sleeves flap all over the screen and it makes it easier to loose them imo. School girl all the way.
---
Which I'll take over shit like Yamaoka's and Ormond.
---
Yeah it was a hard choice
---
Just started playing Legion recently. My current build is; BBQ, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Nurse’s Calling, and Sloppy Butcher. I plan on swapping out Nurse’s when I get Thanatophobia for even an even better stall. Usually running add ons that decreases stun time and increase killer instinct detection range. It’s done wonders for keeping people off gens and slowing the late game down.
---
I agree. 
---
I understand the need for the survivor's system to be measured the way it is, because it's hard to gauge how well a player just by escaping. But there is no reason the killer ranking system should work the way it does. The killer is one player, they don't have to rely on teammates or work different objectives or anything like that, they just kill and that all that should matter for pips.
---
subtle
---
tell someone who cares
---
Doctor is your standard M1 build. 
---
Spirit fury, enduring, BBQ, and ruin. 
---
Legion is the same. 
---
Except on my legion I run M&amp;A, Sloppy, Ruin, and BBQ.
---
As much as I hate the way they play, I can't deny I love these guys. Adorable fanart!
---
They need to sticky a PSA about this, I am sick of seeing this every 5 minutes. This is not the goal of the game, the emblems are. Read them.

Blade throwback.  We matched cosmetics to play blade and whistler from the original Blade movie
---
On him both Bamboozle and Pop Goes the Weasel are bad for two, large reason:
---
* He doesn't move fast enough to make use of Bamboozle properly.  There is little reason to hop barricades faster as your power slows people down.
---
* Pop Goes the Weasel is the same thing:  By the time you get to the gen to pop it, the power has either run out or you've gone far enough that you don't get a ton of "Grace" time to go back and check your hook.
---
Both of those powers are significantly better on other heroes which is a pretty consistent problem in DbD.
---
I played super mario world for AT LEAST 150 hours when I was a kid to finish everything and get all secrets and blah blah. 
---
Ive put in well over that for dbd. If you play the game fine without extra tasks given, then its your own damn mindset at fault if you think it suddenly becomes work?
---
Cause they’re all weebs and should be wiped out
---
Jane and Kate are SS tier for having jiggly thiddies. David too for being #DaddyDavid
---
Watch PsychoScorpionz on Twitch. He's an excellent Pig main.
---
Don't expect kills from RBT. They're for slowing down the game.
---
It's really not that important when to put traps on survivors. Just make sure you use them before the last gen get repaired.
---
WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH, HAHAHA
---
Seconded, I haven’t seen anything about tracking either
---
I guess I’ll be gEnJi.
---
Lose your purple flashlight with double battery add ons?
---
Feng is my main and im only at level 14 with her. Im using Technician, Spine Chill and Lithe. I do play as Nea and Kate occasionally. I use Urban Evasion and Kindred for Nea and Boiled Over and Kindred for Kate.
---
Spirit is the worst killer in the game to verse.
---
says yA mUm
---
*yes i have no friends*
---
Only if you consider getting your ass slapped bad. I find mind games playing both as and against spirit fun
---
It’s simple. You say you understand why survivors are measured how they are. Well, if a killer plays like shit (hard or proxy camping), they are denying survivors the ability to pip. So why should they be able to pip themselves, even if survivors may feel forced to take chances in order to pip or get decent bp? Sounds fair to me.
---
Awww. I wouldn’t tell you to go away...
---
I’d just leave so you can think about what you’ve done.
---
Hehehe
---
I love it thank fuck
---
You sure about that?
---
Usless fucking fact: Your game actually crashes
---
I just had to tell this to someone
---
They are adding a lore bit, a battle pass based on doing challenges which can be upgraded to premium with money, Freddy is getting a complete gutting for his rework, Badham is getting reworked, some more maps are getting changed (infinites) and they are going to mostly focus on game health this year.
---
what he really needed is 0 objective progress upon transition aka help him protect gens and totems, not allow people to actually heal those on the ground and so on. because that would be his most weakness. people just sit on a gen till they are asleep hoping for a skill check(cause Dress add-ons don't influence skill checks in transition). and maybe some add-ons changing cause, for example, Black Box sucks ass and either Obsession gets woken up before you get to them or overall only works on low ranks who don't know how to loop.
---
i understand, however, he's not really fun to play against. personally i hate facing Freddies. unless they play like me - no camp/no tunnel, of course. but overall the games against him are just boring unlike against Spirit. just old loop de loop and praying for skill checks. so hopefully the rework will be at least more fun for playing against him.
---
I feel like there’s no punchline here and this is your honest to god opinion on how fuckable the survivors are.
---
I'd say Billy isn't good on Haddonfield. Yard mazes mean he can't run anywhere except the main road.
---
I heard that they modeled him after a different dev. Can't remember the source but I believe it was one of the different dev streams (or a recap)
---
Maybe just get blood points better. This is a brutal 1v4 where both teams try to screw over the other, not day care.
---
Adorable! I love it!
---
But did we get Bunny Feng?
---
Someone just rage quit and reported me because I looked him on strode. Wtf
---
StAnDiNG sTiLl iS a miND GaMe
---
So you are mad because you’re horrible at the game? Solution - Just practice :) we’ve all been there fam
---
As a high rank killer main on console, I feel like we're just so used to being shit on constantly by survivors it conditions us to be defensive whenever a survivor main comments on the killer side of things. In my experience, it's typically the newer players that think killer is broken. The basics of killer are alot easier to pick up then the basics of survivors, so the newish killers tend to have little trouble picking up 4ks, whereas survivors need to master gen positioning and 360 mechanics and etc. But when you reach the higher ranks, the survivors have all the agency and really set the pace of the game, making the killers job wayyyy harder
---
This could have been me, I'm not sure. If it was I was happy to
---
It really is
---
Considering i just got morried 5 times in a row... no.  But it does piss me off
---
Just to clarify, this list is assuming the killer is at least halfway decent at said killer, and is not using addons.
---
Naw just gotta not get caught
---
They wouldn't pip if they camped and got a single kill, that's not completing their objective.
---
Honestly, the only reason I don’t have Ruin is because it refuses to appear on my web. I haven’t had any need for it so far though. If you can get a 3 gen as Legion you can basically stall the game indefinitely. I had some issue with dropping rank from people DC’ing against me and was dropped down to rank 8. I’ve been using Legion exclusively so I can get more comfortable with their play style. I’m currently a rank 4 from this.
---
its worse. Billy is strong on any map
---
Bro next time, make a throwaway account oost thr comment, get back on you other account, screenshot,  post here.
---
I honestly find it far more interesting when developers of games start doing things like this. Mix-n-Match always has more entertaining results than something completely unique IMO.
---
sadly no they are just being a dick
---
i'd say no, but its a jerk move
---
tbh thats a good point. At least they could introduce a way to block certain maps as killer
---
I thought that was box art then saw this and looked again. cannot unsee.
---
Why are you making drama out of it? The post was subjective and not a big deal.
---
that chat was ridiculously aids fucking hell
---
And smaller streamers actually moderate their chats and tend to ban racism, sexism etc. so there is a chill atmosphere.
---
Absolute unit
---
"Do ThEsE pEoPlE eVeN pLaY tHeIr OwN gAmE??" Shut up, its tentative and likely to get changed in ptb.
---
the hell are you talking about the hillbilly is an absolute dread playing against
---
Well no. 
---
Doing nothing as a killer should lose you the game.
---
It's crazy how you're getting down voted so much for a pretty true comment on the game.  Yeah, people should be excited for a lot of the stuff they have announced, but people telling others to be patient, they are fixing bugs on a game that is going on 3 years old is fucking stupid.
---
They also used a "Haddonfield" offering to top it all off. I strongly resisted backing out, glad I got to serve some slimey justice.
---
Man I love how bhvr did this stream they all seemed like a family and were very passionate about DBD and what they have in store for it. Can’t wait for the future it’s gonna be a good job 😊
---
Yes it is, it's faking using your ability. How can it not be a mindgame?
---
Nurse and Huntress.
---
I feel like there are two main legion builds:
---
The first is thanatophobia, ruin, sloppy butcher, and a perk of your choice (I prefer BBQ or monitor and abuse). The idea behind the build is use your power to get as many people injured and mending as you can, and rely on that to slow down the game long enough for you to m1 people to death with your 115 movespeed. I prefer this build, just because I feel like thano is a super underrated perk, and it combos so well with butcher and mending. Between mending and self care, it's around 70 seconds for them to get back on a gen after you hit them, which slows down the game alot.
---
The second is spirit fury, enduring, ruin, and a flex perk. This build is much less effective at slowing down gen progression, but seeing that the spirit fury-enduring combo is so damned strong right now, your chases are guaranteed to be shorter then the thano build, which will allow you to create pressure that way. This build is arguably stronger, as it creates way more pressure when it works, but sometimes they get your ruin in the first 39 seconds and they finish 3 gens before you get a hook 
---
When it comes to playing legion, I recommend trying to spread deep wounds as much as possible, and then Sprint in front of a survivor and try to body block them from a window or pallet as you cancel your Sprint and eat the stun. Legion is awful, absolutely AWFUL at gen patrolling. You need to try to chain hooks and create pressure that way, you can't just surveil a few high priority gens and hope to get people like you would with Billy or nurse. You have mobility but it's not quite that good. 
---
Sorry for formating, I'm on mobile. If you have any other questions, feel free to send me a DM.
---
ds will only work if you tunnel off hook now, basically
---
Wow, someone here is offended. I made a meme dude, don't treat it like I insulted your family.
---
At this point, I use it as a tactic to keep the agro on me but only at lower ranks because I know how quickly my ass can be facecamped if I taunt the wrong killer
---
This is Freddy messing with our dreams.
---
Aha nah. 2 month old account and they want 6+
---
Nurse is and always will be the worst
---
u/chattywindow getting official dev acknowledgement
---
i love the stream memes soo good
---
Dude what do you mean “gutting” Freddy got a massive buff with his new powers smh
---
I'm hyped!
---
His entire power is getting replaced. While it is a good gut, his entire power is being removed for something better
---
I think Kate was originally designed for Leatherface.
---
But the yakety sax vibe can be a lot of fun!
---
For dedicated servers to happen now, they would need to rush them. 
---
If the first test told us anything, it’s that they aren’t ready. Pushing DD servers right now would make 100% of your matches bad instead of the 1 match you had tonight.
---
happy cake day
---
Oof this is serious.  Thanks god I'm at console lul
---
They aren't gamebreaking by any stretch of the imagination.
---
They are ULTRA-RARE for a reason, you can't run them every game, and even having them doesn't mean you will.  
---
Iridescent Head for Huntress? You still need to aim, you don't magically hit every hatchet just because you have this one addon.  
---
Ebony Mori still requires you to hook every survivor before killing them, and you'll depip if you don't at least get 6 hooks requiring you to delay the game to not be punished for efficiency.  
---
Iridescent King still requires you to track down and shock survivors.  
---
On and on.  
---
You still need to work at the game in order to make these things useful, they don't give you an automatic win, unlike keys being a cheap escape for Survivors.
---
Ohhh ok
---
Wes Craven died??!?
---
Jump cut every 2 seconds so you don’t even know what the context of the game or the chase is
---
looks pretty good, didn't notice the finger thing until you pointed it out lol
---
'' Jet Olsen is a small town journalist that covers his own murders at night as Ghostface.'' That's so clever and sneaky wtf xD
---
Holy fuck it's huge OwO \*pants\*
---
Are you being anal about the s? because there is a perk call haunted ground.
---
Wish Friday the 13th would take a few tips from these guys they're so dedicated to fans.
---
So.... survivors:
---
Sprint every 40 secs, stamina doesn't recover while running, run slower than killers, killers are prized (bloodlust) for not being able to catch a slower target, DS nerfed, vaults are blocked after 2 uses, lunges are idiotics, hitboxes are even more idiotics (even in a 60ms game), killers hit you through pallets, can't fight back which is a insult for Ash Williams, and now want to short loops? Well at least I hope they fix their shit exit gate spawn I fuckin' love a nurse rank 1 camping siamese exit gates.
---
It is sad ppl are going overboard about it. I may not like it but I can understand why some ppl like it
---
Never play on this acc again,buy a new game.
---
Cant wait for all this... IN SIX MONTH'S
---
Find some friends to play with and just have fun.
---
This is a new ability. You can't do gens if you didn't found  ghostface in the locker. Would be OP.
---
Yeah, I don't buy battle passes either but I never had a problem with them too, so long as there are no gameplay features locked behind them, I'm fine with them existing.
---
Mods deleted comments saying "carl" when he popped up.
---
 I doubt most of the deleted messages were that bad
---
I swear it went from n\*\*\*\*er to posting pic puctures, to asking for Feet pics, to disrespectin other cultures. This happend in 5minuites.
---
No mither wasn’t meant to be good, it was put in there as a hard mode for survivors.
---
No Pig at !!! ???
---
Personally I use schoolgirl in black with the prestige sword
---
You're either really stupid,a begginer or just trolling.
---
I’m a little bothered for me that a paid game will have it with no way to unlock it
---
With the good skins Nea goes up, with that cop skins Tapp gets soon he will dominate everyone.
---
Ron Jeremy next killer confirmed.
---
New player. What do people mean by baby dwights? I know the character dwight, but...
---
wouldnt those waking up devices and extra ways of waking up makes it very hard to keep survivors asleep? they can just instantly run to one of them once they fall asleep or if they know how long it takes they can stand by a gen or a hook to start and wait for skillchecks
---
also i dont quite understand what sleeping survivors suffer from other than seeing fake pallets or maybe traps to slow give them hinder but otherwise if they avoid those they dont need to worry about anything, am i understanding this right?
---
ofc they do LUL no killer no games... also its a asymmetrical game, the killer is supposed to be OP on a 1v1, because the game is 1v4..
---
I'm not sure why he'd continue to play a game he's clearly not enjoying anymore.
---
He seems really serious and vexed a lot of the time when things don't go his way. 
---
He talks about how potato his teams are, but he'd be a nightmare to play with. He doesn't go for saves and he messes up really safe loops.
---
I use to really like watching him, but now it's all just a bit weird.
---
His power erases the stealth element of the game and at tier 3 survivors are unable to do objectives???
---
Whispers also eliminates stealth. Stealth isn’t relevant in high rank. 
---
The doctor has to waste so much time to put you into madness 3 (if a doc player actually does this) and THEN chase you. 
---
Like I said, useless.
---
New player...what's a 3k?
---
But I like playing survivor. Killer isn't that fun to me.
---
They are working just fine but they got a little reworked a while back making them less of a pain for killers so maybe that's why you think it's delayed.
---
God Survivors won’t let us just kill them!
---
So toxic!
---
Oink
---
They have to fix bugs on a game that is three years old because they are consistently adding new content. I’m sure if the devs stopped caring about DBD, and just let the game fade into oblivion with its starting cast of only 1 killer and 4 survivors, there would be no bugs. 
---
I’m sorry but if you think it’s easy to continuously add a survivor and / or killer every several months, completely revamp entire systems the game runs on, change core mechanics of the game along with adding new perks that grant new abilities one could never do before, ALL THE WHILE having zero bugs simply because the game is “three years old”, then you’re a bit of a moron.
---
Cant wait
---
It takes like 5 or 10 seconds to put them into madness 3 if you can use him right, not to mention whispers doesn't give you their exact location. Oh and I forgot to mention his ability lets you stop survivor loops while getting a free hit.
---
kate
---
Oh. You’re one of those people who thinks his power actually stops looping. 
---
Alright well have a nice night.
---
It wasn't explained very well, but from what I understand -
---
Being awake protects you from Dream Snares and Dream Traps.
---
Being asleep makes you vulnerable to Dream Snares and Dream Traps.
---
Thus being asleep will make you very bad in chases against Freddy - it's like going against a Trapper and a Clown mixed together.
---
Again, his power wasn't fully explained but I think this is the gist of it.
---
I think he can move immediately after the 5 seconds.
---
That's actually a Polish political activist in case anyone wanted to know.
---
biggest salt mine know to mankind, the dbd sub reddit
---
i like that. makes it basically the survivor equivalent of bbq
---
You too, stay mad my dude.
---
Don't be so generous to him/her.
---
Saying GG is toxic anymore even
---
They are referring to new players like you, the playstyle is very obvious and they usually run Dwight.
---
Not in the next year.
---
Dont forget the slow zooms/pans every other jump cut.
---
If someone says things like: I feel like this game is killer sided because there perks are better and they are quicker can anyone help? It will be recieved better than KILLER IS OP BOYS NOED IS A THING LOOK AT BILLY THAT MAN FAST AS FUCK BOY.
---
I certainly don't. I played a while around last Christmas again but stopped again when they introduced the patch were killers suddenly had 10 meter long arms. 
---
I really loved the game, that's why I'm still lurking around. I don't think I ever played something more in such a short amount of time.
---
That's the only thing that justify lack of Carl as survivor
---
We evolved as a community to the point were someone makes a nice post with 0% toxic and people downvote it because? Take my upvote brother.
---
Am I the only one that thinks it is only going to be useful for low/midrank?
---
It spews blood when you are charging the teleport and any good survivor is going to see you charging it and dip another way.
---
Honestly it feels like we are losing freddy and getting a worse nurse/better trapper hybrid...
---
sigh
---
This is amazing
---
Gotcha! Thank you!
---
Jerzy urban
---
Ah i misremembered.
---
Yeah if someoned is being pulled off there's probably no counter, but if the person goes down regulary i guess there will be time to let go and then sit behind the gen until the person is hooked and BBQ wears off.
---
Unless it immediatly activates once the hit connects to the survivor, but we'll see.
---
yeah. i feel like that would kinda ruin it since they wouldn’t get the likeness. for example if laurie actually looked like jamie lee curtis, she would 100% be my main, but i hardly play her because i just don’t see “laurie strode” in the character that we have.
---
Overwatch still lacks lore, we all officially fully superior
---
Make him a skin to... Idk, maybe Jeff
---
i like the way he is now, but i like the rework even more
---
Like most M1 killers he clearly dresses to the right.
---
Damn, I've never met anyone who finds Leatherface remotely fun to play against. Him and Doc are my least favourites
---
Nah, bubba is thick, he will be alright
---
I main survivor, but randomly tried the insidious bubba build. It was a massacre!
---
franklin’s ain’t that bad
---
Wait. Doctor was nerfed? What was he like before?
---
*chuckles in rank reset*
---
I had that also once a long time ago. I did not got the escape points, cause I died at the animation.
---
Somewhat appropriate?  
---
source: [https://m.twitch.tv/iatethecrayon](https://m.twitch.tv/iatethecrayon)
---
I swear, his new rework just feels so much Freddy, fake pallets slow downs and teleporting. He will be the dreammaster again.
---
Solid work.
---
To further add to OPs post. You can get 3 months of gamepass for £10 (someone from murica translate please) on CDkeys.com
---
Its just cosmetic and legal right?
---
yes he actually feels like he can torment the shit out of people
---
Right? Franklins comes in fairly clutch imo when you see a swf join with flashlights, toolboxes
---
"but chat spamming copypastas and racist shit enhances the experience!"
---
I would rather have some sub-optimal matches instead of being at mercy of a DDOS attack. I can wait, but I wouldn't want to play dbd until then as to avoid this thing happening again.
---
Hey, listen up you stupid fuck moron, did I mention anything you brought up?  No I didn't.  I just said that there are and have been legitimate problems with this game over time that that have been fucking stupid, and have taken too long to fix.  That, and criticism towards BHVR and the game even if you don't like it are warranted.  Even if you love the fucking game or not.  Down voting someone for speaking the truth or their opinion on it because you don't like it is dumb.  And dont talk to me about game development, no I don't work in the field, but I've played plenty of games that push more content than DBD does and they don't run into nearly as many problems.  Stop white knighting you fucking chode.
---
that's because he is childish and it can actually be funny for a game or two, but I can't bring myself to watch more then 2 games because.. well it gets childish...
---
I have been called. Don't listen to anyone here but the official oinker.
---
Our oinkgirl is best played by crouching to gens to then ambust for early hits or just standing up, uses all traps as soon as possible, use ambush at not to big loops to get survivors to make mistakes, dont tunnel a trapped survivor but feel free to hit them if they walk to you.
---
Freddy can use that wait time to mindgame leading to hits and downs. On small to medium sized map freddy can apply presdure instead of chaseing yet still retain downing potential. This is because freddt can mindgame during the dream transition phases and then use his aura reading to keep tabs on the survivor while he pressures others. Freddy can then mindgame again upon the injured survivor breaking out of dream. 
---
Leatherfaces power on the otherhand is only good for basement pressure and a slightly faster palletbreak without charge and cooldown addons.
---
Legion can apply pressure like freddy however lacks the downing potential freddy has with his mindgames. They can apply injured fast however past that has nothing. If the survivors are good they can also just not heal to prevent legions stall simar to the strat of not cleansing against plauge.
---
God's Work
---
I actually love Franklin's...but shrine as a whole...
---
They gonna buff billy and nurse obviously...
---
Yeah I should have posted that lmao
---
Considering the rework Freddy is about to get, might I suggest Legion tier?
---
You can do either one of those: ignore them. delete them. Set it up so only your friends can comment.
---
Not a great memory
---
That's one of the reasons I chose to watch it through HybridPandas stream. Bamboo Crew were positive and mods were on point.
---
That's not confirmed, the year 4 roadmap is just a list of things that will definitely happen. While a new gamemode has not been announced, it does not mean that it won't happen
---
Depends honestly, in smite there are tons of p2w cosmetics
---
Imagine being chases, then you get slowed and deadhard to a pallet which then falls apart in blood so you run further to see Freddy pop out of a gen and kill you.
---
Ngl I dislike playing vs Myers, EW3 feels like shit to deal with. Would put Doctor and Freddy to "Pog" tier as well and drop Spirit to "Ugh" and Nurse to "Doesnt deserve to exist".
---
I run two exhaustion perks. One of them is Balanced. The other is a toss between Lithe and Dead Hard. Balanced is godly on some maps, but pretty much useless on other maps. I find that even if I am not using the speed portion of Balanced, the reduction in lag after a fall is so nice. I can't go back.
---
Youre God dam right it did. Respect.
---
New Meg skin confirmed?
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
He has a right to use what he wants.
---
It's gonna hurt survivor. The only changes being made to the game within the past 4 months are are for killers.
---
Darn.
---
So 20 seconds of exposed effect is countered by sprint burst.....bruh
---
Again? :( Why'd you leave him to begin with?
---
Same dude
---
You can tell because I'm an example lol
---
Yeah I think you have noticed the Keem Scream my man.

I hate that the cycle of toxicity makes it so that I cant even be nice without it being taken as some sort of sarcastic jab. I send gg after a 4k because they did a good job and gave me a challenging game, and I get back "stfu trash"

Sometimes I buy something, sometimes I grind for the enjoyment. Though, everything s/b be available to grind towards.
---
Now that I read it, that kind of sounded dirty.
---
probably is a basement leatherface with insidious
---
Eh, I kinda disagree to be honest. Everything in moderation. Mixing and matching is why Siege is getting really stale and lazy right now.
---
Yeah, because racist chanting and violence towards rival teams fans is much better right?
---
Hate the game, not the player! Why would anyone care? Survivors could use meta perks too and cancerous items.
---
The mask license was all they needed. Its like the Netflix series, they didn't get the license for the mask so they took the same concept but made a new mask, this made it so they could write their own story with their own characters. DBD just got the license for the mask, so they could make up their own story and character. Ghostface isn't really a character, more like an idea.
---
Sorry boss but I don’t think sub rank 15s are going to be using OP perks...
---
It’s a crazy thought, but you can actually show respect to the other side sometimes. Mind blowing, I know. 
---
Have a good night, boss.
---
Do you play on console or pc?
---
Those are the people you play with/against...
---
Alternatively, Invisidette.
---
We don’t know yet
---
Want to be a god of mishchief and mess with people? Doctor. Want to have high map mobility and fun teleporting abilities? Play hag. Want a mix of both, not focusing on either particular play-style? Play Freddy. Everyone wins, I kind of really like these hybrids. I like how with Ghostface they’re incorporating things from Myers and Pig, so this’ll be fun.
---
There is no “best map” for an M1 killer. 
---
Azarov’s/Sheltered Woods isn’t the worst.
---
Well that's good.
---
PS4

[deleted]
---
Coldwine is overall the best but Yamoaka is a good substitution
---
"Looks like" ???????????
---
Bish that's just a semi
---
Yeah, mostly survivors need a BP buff.
---
An incredible survivor game might net me 20k BP whereas an ok killer game would get me around 25k BP
---
No one has ever said cosmetics are pay2win. It's the fact that they want to add a fucking battlepass to a game you have to PAY for, along with paid DLC 4 times a year if you want to unlock the new surv/killer to play for yourself without a grind. I think it's just fine putting cosmetics in the store permanently and letting players choose if and when they want to buy pieces of it.
---
With a battle pass im 100% sure there's going to be cosmetics exclusive to that, and in order to unlock the entire outfit we're going to have to pay to unlock every fucking premium tier for it. It's only going to stay up for a month or 2 and then it's gone forever or for a long period of time.
---
Of course, no one HAS to buy cosmetics, we're not being forced to. But it's still annoying when they're going to lock these outfits behind a paywall when we buy everything else.
---
It's fucking greedy. Literally NOBODY asked for this.
---
And dumbasses like OP ignore this because they don't want to take the 3 minutes to figure out how this actually might be a problem.
---
thanks for pointing it out that changes it a lot
---
There is no “effort” involved with running in a circle until you catch up to somebody. All this pallet update is doing is adding MORE pallets to a map but removing the SAFEST ones so that theres more chances for the killer to initiate mind games instead of the survivor just constantly knowing where the killer is and the loop being so long theres no room for mindgame.
---
Dude, we're discussing changing game mechanics to make everyone have more fun/progress a little easier.
---
Noone asked for your wierd macho facade
---
It looks like the timer is active aswell so that should be a bug, I still believe that the nerf was stupid and not well tought off. There were other nerfs that would allow her to have the endgame pressure wiyhouy making her OP. But scince I see a Pig, upvote.
---
Puppers is a fog whisperer I highly doubt they hate him
---
Good idea but if its like any other battle pass thingy, if you arent going to pay up anything then you won't be getting much after the first 5 or so levels
---
Trap isn’t activated. You have to put a trap on before all the generators are done. 
---
It’s a lot more logical now.
---
This is the part were you tell us why you think that and you give us objective arguments.
---
Oh is he, ok wll then why the hate for monto and noob
---
Why do they hate them? Based on what is this claim made?
---
Urban co ty tu robisz?
---
Did you watch the stream ??
---
that's bc you're probably lowranked and people there don't often play against him. in the purple and red ranks you get pissed on by suriviors hard
---
Well that sucks :/
---
It's supposed to promote not farming that's true it's still a nerf nevertheless. You don't double your BP. As a killer BBQ gives you stacks for doing your job. WGLF stacks are much harder to obtain. You can also not say it's a fair trade playing with less perks for double BPs (if you get the stacks) when the other side can do the same with a metal perk.
---
Same tought for me.
---
You’re joking right?
---
Whoa. 
---
I’ll be honest I see like three of these posts a week so I thought it’d be the same story. 
---
Think that’s a bug.
---
AHAHA
---
Yikes
---
The leveling system as a whole
---
No  i thimk they hate they give him js unreasonable
---
I hope a never face you if those are your picks. Nothing personel kid.
---
thanks \^\^
---
It was in the anniversary live stream they have been advertising for the last two weeks, the stream was yesterday.
---
Dude, for the tiny ass company based in Quebec, they’re are doing a hell of a job getting horror licenses for us. People don’t realize how hard it is to get the rights to certain characters, just be grateful we got Ghostface at all.
---
One side can bait, fake and track, the other can... Guess... And even then the first one has the upper hand... "Mindgame" killer btw.
---
Play killer instead then ?
---
WLGF does double your BP. Yes WGLF stacks are harder to obtain as there might be 3 other people trying to get them. But there is a difference between BBQ and WGLF, just because they both grant you more BP doesn't mean they are the same perk for just different sides. BBQ was meant to be an anti camping perk, it would give killer something to do instead of guarding the hook as they could see others auras. Int he beginning however BBQ didn't give 2x BP in the end, it gave you 100% more BP for actions when someone was on a hook. WGLF for also a lot stronger before. Back in 2017 it used to stack up to 200%, which was later nerfed.
---
Just cause BBQ is stronger doesn't mean WGLF needs a buff.
---
Pay to (pay to play)
---
Dude, that's awesome
---
I know that, but is there a SPECIFIC place where I can find them without having to rewatch the entire stream? I a timestamp would help a lot, too
---
Those are a lot of Hexes. Personally I would never run more than 1 hex as the odds of them finding all of them are greatly increased. but since you are playing Hillbilly it might be fine.
---
Doc,Spirit &amp; Hag
---
Good survivors will push through Ruin as if it doesn't exist.  
---
A full on totem build isn't that great because you don't have anything going for you in chases; you can get looped for a much longer time than usual.  
---
This build could work, but not against a team of okay-ish survivors.
---
I don't run this build on any killer who can't patrol totems and gens well. It works wonders on Hillbilly though and it is tons of fun.
---
Billy, Huntress and Spirit are my top 3.  
---
Nurse and Hag come in close.
---
Meh, killers had to endure hostage situations and bm at the gates for 2 years, you can handle 3 minutes.
---
I am currently easing through the green ranks with this build. I definitely think good survivors can play smartly and negate this build's effects.
---
Trapper, they have to buff him HE'S ON THE COVER FOR FRICKS SAKE
---
2 Fengs 1 Kate
---
the PLAAAAG
---
Oh, that last person looked like Feng to me. Idk why
---
It kinda does, a try harding swf group will probably brake your totems anyways by timing a multiple cleansing with one of them being chased, thus making you chose between comiting to the chase or saving a single totem. Meanwhile a bunch of randoms are nearly the same on purples and red ranks, and randoms have the hability to potato the entire match, making it possible to still run this build.
---
pillowphile
---
Surprisingly enough, survivors at higher ranks have become somewhat competent.  
---
I'm personally using the basic M1 build on Billy, but I use Whispers instead of Ruin, and it works wonders. Once in a while, however, I'll get a team of good survivors and I'll get completely crushed, even with a generally good build. If you want to play a killer with totem control, use Nurse or Spirit with Mother Daughter Ring.
---
I can't tell if that's a joke or not.
---
Not a killer main however i do believe some loops need a fix or rework especiall some infinite window loops that still exist
---
Its the weekly post everyone !
---
Your death is inevetable
---
Heres the problem... you're whole premise is built on "mindgame" This means, *POTENTIAL* hits. this. Is. Usless. Legion gets a free first hit, then its just normal chase of just hit them. A GUARENTEED free first hit is infinitly better then a mindgame potential first hit, with aura reading on others. Leatherface at least allows for, under the right circimstances, a instant end to a chase. It may be a RARE circimstance, but its still nice. The other biggest issue with Freddy is he's just useless in many situations. Hatch standoff/race. Useless. he has to wait and can't do anything. unhook near a gate. He has to wait and can't hit them. unbreakable. Has to wait and can't do anything. You see what im saying here? Sure, there are times where Freddy gets a M1 where the others coudn't. But in sooooo many situations, he's just left to sit and wait, and watch as the survivor runs away. It's too much of a negative that costs you entire kills, let alone hits.
---
No
---
Doesn’t his power stop if a survivor stares at him for like a second? Wouldn’t that prevent it from being used in a chase?
---
Hope you still reported them
---
Adrenaline isnt Noeds counterpart, pre-nerf decisive strike was. That was nerfed so noed should def be nerfed in some kind of way
---
Could someone explain to me by typing noobs name in Behaviours twitch chat gives you an automatic 30 min ban? Does Behaviour hate him?
---
Don’t really play killer so I’ll throw a curve ball and say my favourite/funnest killers to play against (not in order): Myers, pig, huntress, trapper, hag
---
I guess it was bugged. You could have a survivor in deep wounds(BT effect) and down them as a non-Legion character and maybe still get progression?
---
That is a ridiculous idea. Getting points for letting your team down lmao
---
If you don't like the current game or community then a new game mode probably won't help you.
---
*stands up from gen and stares in Nea*
---
You shouldn't be rewarded for disconnecting on purpose.
---
I'm a game programmer lol
---
Cant wait to struggle completing the harder challenges. 4K basement without addons or perks on legion.
---
For doctor I use:
---
Discordance, overcharge, sage the best for last and ruin
---
For legion I use:
---
Bbq a chilli, enduring, thanatophobia and ruin 
---
Might not be the best build idk but it’s up to you.
---
It’s so clever each of them need and a different thing and it alines with the characters and I love the detail
---
I would say tapp
---
Freddy
---
I like how you profied ONE argument after so long and it something everyone would have done.
---
I'd pay to see Bubba default dancing in-game
---
One hell of a dead hard
---
She did, however she was leaked right around Leatherface's release. It's not that unfair to think she was meant for him instead.
---
Solid summary
---
UMMM ACKCHYUALLY IT'S 4 SURVIVORS, NOT 5, SO THIS MEME DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE
---
^/s
---
Ok that's a huge input, lemme break it down into the things I wanna comment from my side and then make a conclusion of sorts.
---
&gt; that super altruistic team that always unhooks when you leave
---
You call it super altruistic but honestly it's just a healthy play. In higher ranks you are almost always being unhooked before the second stage and it feels good, both as survivor and as killer. Unless you mean something else here like the situations when the whole team just sits around the hook and then unhooks immediately after the killer moves 10m, but that's as much super altruistic as super dumb, and if anything it only makes killer's life easier as gens aren't being done.
---
&gt; Just because you don’t see the altruistic team doesn’t mean they aren’t there.
---
Because of the things above, I'm mostly ok about that. They don't do gens, so I can leave and patrol everything. If they unhook too early, I can just come back and either find the unhooker or slug the unhooker.
---
&gt; Also there’s a term I like to call proximity camping but in this case it’s more of checking around a bit then leaving.
---
That's definitely not a hard camping that I was talking about in my previous post. As long as you know what you are doing in terms of map pressure and you don't tunnel it's all fine.
---
&gt; Alright so I’m a trapper doing a daily in the game with 2 people left. I’m going after the god looper I finally get them down I walked away and they got instarescued. I found the god looper again so I chased them again ran into BT, DH and Decisive strike.
---
So, basically what happened here. You tunneled the hook-farmed guy in a 2-survivors game, so their BT and Decisive got to work. In those conditions, I'm honestly glad they had those perks.
---
&gt; But within that 5 minute chase again I saw the Kate a few times, but if I gave up on the god looper I may have to loop a good Kate so might as well try and get the god looper down. Also no gens where being done and 1 or 2 gens should’ve been done which also corrects my thinking that Kate’s here for the insta hook. 
---
&gt;Once I get her down I hook her and my bbq goes off but I don’t see Kate yes I know you can hide in lockers but I seriously doubt that. So knowing Kate I stayed around for a little bit to see what happens, low and behold here comes crouched Kate.
---
So, Kate wasn't doing the gens while you were chasing that looper guy for a five damn minutes. So, basically a fairly gecent player was matched with 2 disconnects and a seriously dumb Kate player, and you went tryhard on him, tunneled him and camped him afterwards. 
---
&gt; End of story I won and predicted right.
---
You basically was beating up a player who had no chance in that game. You can call it your win, but honestly I think that guy would win against you if the game hadn't cucked him with 2 DCs and a stupid teammate.
---
I mean they are giving smaller channels the spotlight. second when it comes to noob he has changed but a lot of his fans sure have not
---
I’m All Ears will be countered by the fact that nobody will run it.
---
Freddy, hillbilly, plague.
---
this post failed the moment you called yourself a survivor main. clearly don't have experience in playing killer to have a say.
---
Totem counter should be added to Small Game.  
---
Billy changes? Really? Nurse, I can agree with, but Billy?  
---
You want to remove any non-survivor sided maps? What about Haddonfield, or Lerys; probably the worst designed maps game-play-wise.  
---
I wouldn't call a NOED nerf a QoL change, but a balancing change, rather.(same with killer changes)
---
*Patrick from spongebob laughing*
---
I'm a Baby Dwight and some Doctor once brought me to the hatch, closed it and watch me die :(
---
Yes, lets reward players for ruining the game for others.
---
Boo!
---
he was always fucked at late game. at least leather face can camp freddy was fucked if the gates are open
---
Whispers is quite an underrated perk imo. I don't own Spirit and I am such a shit Nurse. Billy is so far working wonders for me in map pressure with the right add ons. I love this build so much xD
---
Yeah, crouch to 90 speed and watch them run the fuck away from you, sounds great.
---
1. Yes this is bullshit, you shouldn't get punished for RNG
---
2. Both maps are boring, bland and have no obvious lore tie-ins, they should both be removed
---
3. Yes
---
4. Not a massive issue but sure why not
---
5. Ghost Face's stalk mode can be cancelled, Plague is bad and it takes long to get to the point where health states don't matter (= broken effect)
---
6. Will still happen even with dedicated servers, it's a feature, not a bug. Hits that seem like they shouldn't connect will still happen even with dedicated servers if your connection starts lagging
---
7. It's disgusting how there still isn't a proper punishment for disconnects
---
8. No
---
9. No
---
10. Yes
---
u/sniphskii you're a meme now
---
I like to be stealthy on jake for the added challenge of being big
---
Baby meg too.
---
Third Seal is annoying at best, definitely doesn’t need to be a totem perk.
---
* New Power - New sleep cycle and new dream abilities.
---
* Sleep Cycle - microsleep! (awake, freddy will be able to hit you right away, freddy blinks in and out at distance), survivors fall asleep passively! (when asleep, hear lullaby instead of TR, Freddy is fully visible)
---
* ANY failed skillcheck wakes you up, you can wake each other up. Dream object (clock on dresser) will always wake you up.
---
* Dream visual is changing for the better. Dream World is staying.
---
* Dreams Abilities - Dream Traps and "something else".
---
* Dream pallets! You can place them on spawn points where pallets normally spawn. Awake survivors do not see these. When interacted with, they explode in BLOOD.
---
* Dream Snare! (Not sure if they want both or one or other) Can use actively in chase. Place on ground, takes two seconds to arm, when survivor walks over it, they are slowed initially and for some time after.
---
* Generator Teleport! - You can aim at Generator, channel ability for 5 seconds, and teleport to gen.
---
No? Bloodlust was added because there were large loops in which killers could not reach the survivor. If they remove large loops but not bloodlust, survivor will have a problem to loop because the same pallet will be used like 2 times?
---
honestly I want this on a t-shirt.
---
Was that a teaser for ace finger guns?
---
Buncha tryhards. You failing a still check means 10% more prove thyself at a 400% bonus, and the killer gets to come by so I can get bold or possibly get a stack off you. 😂
---
Probably Leatherface. A lot of other characters look a bit...meaty when prestiged. Sorta weird on Myers, but quite good on Bubba. Plus, meaty Bubba is very appropriate!
---
I'm mad, I just recently got into legion, bought his chapter on the sale because I wanted him for ages, then after a few matches got his Joey body with the blue points because I was saving for legion himself and then the sale came up, but I hadn't actually noticed spirit fury was such a good perk on him and it was on the shrine last week when I got the cosmetic but I didn't have enough of the points to buy it.
---
i love these  dbd youtuber starter packs
---
Oh boy this is nothing I mean the game will end or you will bleed out. Remember not long a go when people would not leave the game when all the gens were done and exist gate were open ? Few minutes on the ground should not get you mad. Go get some water in the meantime
---
found a confused baby claudette had played the game for a week. She was didnt know fast-vaulting excited levels of baby... I let her go
---
P3 stands for prestige 3, at which point the character with the 3 prestiges will have the option to wear cosmetics covered in blood, when applied to claudette, it makes her practically invisible.
---
the playstyle being easily spooked and obviously confused
---
If he can teleport, will he be a 110% killer?
---
Pig can mindgame loops with the ambush SOMEWHAT, above about rank 10 it's often a poor choice since most survivors will run away from the loop, not around it, when you crouch because it's her ONE tactic in a chase with her power.
---
To use that WITH I'm All Ears, you have to crouch after the pallet's already dropped (which is wasting your own time 9 times out of 10) and then they have to vault it as well, and it goes on CD so you only have one shot.
---
To say this would be good for her, let alone worth wasting 25% of your perks on is an absolute joke.
---
I good compromise leaves no one happy.
---
I always thought Spirit was a hybrid between Wraith and Nurse
---
Everyone: “Freddy is F tier! He’s so trash omg buff him.”
---
**bEhaviour completely reworks Freddy**
---
Everyone now: Ewwww they’ve ran out of ideas, Freddy is a copy of other killers.
---
Also forgot the good ol' "YIKES"
---
It’s a shitpost.
---
The teleport is a 5 second channel, so I’d say probably not
---
Let's: fuck my drag right?
---
Can someone summarise the freddy rework for me real Quick? Idk where to find patch notes
---
&gt;Because people in this game don’t give a shit about each other and would farm each other for days.
---
That's why you give 2 for a safe one.
---
&gt;Just by the way you’re talking I have a pretty good idea you did that a lot.
---
Nice assumption, in some situations it's just something you have to go for, getting punished for it is stupid, especially with how hard it is to gain stacks.
---
&gt;Now getting stacks for doing generators?
---
Not necessarily for gens but for something for sure. Getting stacks on wglf is ridiculous.
---
They should take atleast 20k of your own bloodpoints for making the game shit for everyone else cause you're a selfish person  and give you (atleast) 10 min cooldown for leaving
---
I'd love that but going behind their back to get ghostface without paying for the scream license probably burns too many bridges to do so in the future
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bvc6qg/freddy_rework_explained/
---
This might help.
---
Pig, Huntress, Nurse. 
---
Maybe Spirit will take 3rd spot soon, just learning her, and she's quite fun.
---
I know that L4D skin for Jake was based on Francis from L4D.  But I feel that the end result looks more like this guy.
---
The Freddy part starts in 1:13:30
---
Lmao and here I am running around as a spooky Candle boy.
---
They still did say it was exaggerated though.
---
Man, they said that Ghostface can't stalk and make survivors exposed while his ability is on cooldown and survivors can send his ability on cooldown by just looking at him for 1 second.
---
Yeah, more pallets = nerf survivors, sure.
---
That potential is high, and with the ability to pressure multiple survivors equal to that of a chase. You shouldnt be chaseing as freddy as doing so is a waste of time unless you have spirit fury or are at a mindgameable jungle jym. You should instead be abandoning chase to pressure others and then returning to the first surv to down. The potential for this down and the pressure applyed is higher than what leatherface and legion can do. Of course freddy can be outplayed in these phases and failing them is a big deal for him but if the right reads are made and enough pressure is applyed freddy becomes a big threat.
---
Since when do they hate monto ????
---
'toxic' btw. Yes I have been very toxic in this post.
---
Nea, because I’m a toxic cunt.
---
Nurse can strike survivors by teleporting through them, Ninja Gaiden style
---
Its called fashion sweaty
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Pretty good job... ;)
---
*copy/paste*
---
    FREDDY REWORK!
---
    Difference between update and rework - update is like Wraith and Legion changes. Rework is change of power completely, killer plays differently, addons and everything else changed.
---
    Why change Freddy?
---
    Players were frustrated playing as him and against him. Invisibility by default is hard on new players. Action speed debuff is a bitch. (my words)
---
    Old freddy was delay type character - new freddy has map mobility and an active power. No more interaction debuff!
---
    New Power - New sleep cycle and new dream abilities.
---
    Sleep Cycle - microsleep! (awake, freddy will be able to hit you right away, freddy blinks in and out at distance), survivors fall asleep passively! (when asleep, hear lullaby instead of TR, Freddy is fully visible)
---
    ANY failed skillcheck wakes you up, you can wake each other up. Dream object (clock on dresser) will always wake you up.
---
    Dream visual is changing for the better. Dream World is staying.
---
    Dreams Abilities - Dream Traps and "something else".
---
    Dream pallets! You can place them on spawn points where pallets normally spawn. Awake survivors do not see these. When interacted with, they explode in BLOOD.
---
    Dream Snare! (Not sure if they want both or one or other) Can use actively in chase. Place on ground, takes two seconds to arm, when survivor walks over it, they are slowed initially and for some time after.
---
    Generator Teleport! - You can aim at Generator, channel ability for 5 seconds, and teleport to gen.
---
The waco kid!
---
This is the truth. The hide and seek part is fun to me, it's scary and that's the point of the game.
---
I want to be worried that if the killer finds me I'm likely dead because that's how it works in horror films.
---
no point saving now 2x bloodpoint is happening before he comes out
---
Thank you
---
If you say you can counter Huntress and Hag more easily than Billy, you've clearly not gone against a good one.  
---
I agree Hag can be countered with flashlights, but if you see one if the pre-game lobby, just don't use her; there's a really low chance a survivor will find a flashlight in a chest.
---
yea it has like 4000 players right now
---
they did a huge rework of the whole game. relaunching it as deathgarden bloodharvest. it's in free weekend now, if you buy it soon you get a free gift copy as well
---
Omfg reworks are so good, finally a reason to buy him
---
People always forget the recovery on the axe throws is a lot quicker than a regular hit.
---
Removing the forced choice and adding some sort of protection for perk nodes on the web would be an amazing start if they are unwilling to raise the bloodpoint values.
---
I thought leatherface didnt have a survivor or am I wrong
---
I have basically 0 issues with any of the killer dailies (although I am at the point where I can have at least some semblance of a decent build on my killers, having to play some killers without decent perks for 30k could be a nightmare)
---
The survivor ones are often a bit naff though, especially "sabotage hooks" or "open an exit gate with x survivor", really any survivor daily that isn't the player's main just puts everyone in the lobby at a slight disadvantage unless a player has a build for every survivor (because that would be a good use of god knows how many bp right)
---
I have been in red ranks for 8 months, I think I played against few good hags and huntresses.
---
Best man
---
Don't know if you paid a-lot of attention, but most of those were auto-deleted comments because they contained X word e.g. Ochido (yeah that was one of the words), No team of mods is fast enough to keep up and immediately ban comments in that time-frame.
---
Honestly the only live mod comment bans I saw were the Esports ones and a couple outliers, and I was there the whole 2 hours, eventually getting bored with the waste of time band skits and "I did X in the development process" that I just started looking at the removed comments to figure out the keywords for auto-removal.
---
Try paying attention before trying to create a Skubstorm.
---
I would love to not have to smash a button to struggle.
---
I really enjoyed the hunter gameplay but I'm not sure about scavenger. Hunters dona really good job of filling the power role and are a blast to play. I feel like scavenger is a lot harder and requires a lot of teamwork to do well but it's kinda hard when a dude yeets on you, 2 shots you, and instantly executes you.
---
Pointless status effects?
---
So making survivors glow red forever, be permanently exhausted (disabling the strongest survivor perks), making them not trust any pallet and all the other effects are pointless? Just by shocking a survivor you can stack all of the Doctor's special conditions on them, and unlike Huntress you don't need to aim.  
---
And at what point did I reveal that I'm a killer main?  
---
I merely pointed out that Iridescent Addons are in no way overpowered, as they still require the killer to follow up with skill, on top of being rare to even get in the first place.  
---
The only possible thing here is that you think I'm a killer main because of the hate for Keys, and yet even die hard Survivor mains think Keys are cheap and in no way fair as they reward you with a free escape for not playing the game.
---
Same.  I main *freddy* when i play killer and Haddonfield is not a problem at all if the survivors aren’t those crazy rank 1 swf groups(to which it doesn’t matter what map it is, I’ll lose with freddy any time)
---
They had that, it's called DLC. As a bonus, they also have paid cosmetics.
---
I've said it elsewhere, if Behaviour *needed* to add a battlepass system to sustain their game on top of the base price+DLC price+the price of any cosmetics players may or may not buy, they would doing insanely bad as a company given how popular their game is.
---
Thats what they said with Decisive Strike, yet they eventually reworked it. There are problems with both sides and being vocal about those problems is the best way to get change
---
The legion was a case of his power being weak but for the survivor it had no counterplay. The legion wasnt a good killer to get the 4ks (not that many of them were) but he was very good at making sure he got that one survivor. ghostface power seems good in low but bad against high ranks
---
"survivors will not have access to a bat which they can use to attempt to fight off the killer instead "
---
Listen I do like some point that has bye bye cosmetics but I do not think we should have a battle pass just saying
---
I’d be up for him becoming sort of an illusionist thing though
---
*Kind of what i was hoping doctor would be but that didnt happen*
---
Yeah that was fun except for the infinite loops so the only viable killer was trapper.
---
They actually called the Leatherface DLC a paragraph.
---
Depends, does it proc if your screen looks at him, or your character? If it’s character only then we’re doomed
---
I picked Nea first, due to balanced landing and the crouch speed for self survival and stealth reasons. I figured they would be the most important attributes to the game. I have her somewhere around 30-40 currently and It seems like Meg kinda makes Nea irrelevant. Having to fall to burst or just sprint? Easy choice. Plus urban evasion isnt on my top 5 picks. 
---
Of course there are other characters with perks for altruism and other specific perks but for the basic survivor- why would anyone pick Nea over Meg? 
---
Once I level 50 and use all my items ill switch to a new character, probably Meg... unless altruism or some other perk oriented actions could get me them big bloods.
---
Removing bloodlust would probably be a buff for Beast of the Hunt /s
---
New dinoflask vid is up, that should make you feel better
---
Do we have to delete the other folders ? or just put this one inside and were'all good ?
---
That's brilliant 😂😂😂
---
Without the grind, the game falls flat. It's not horrible right now, but something does need to be done eventually. Every character added to the game adds around 400K (rough estimate) to the BP grind
---
IF YOU WANNA FUCKEN BRAWL, COME DOWN SMETHWICK ASK FOR DANNY G
---
yes, its coded badly. essentially its you down someone as killer who is affected by deep wounds.
---
I literally only play leatherface because I love the movies
---
So far, I can’t say much till I have tried the new one, but I prefer the old one.
---
Great idea actually, with better screen placement of course.
---
This answer has been used for over 2 years now. When will people realize that waiting for over 2 years isn't acceptable?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
u/ninjachocobogirl
---
Can you send a link to where I can read about his re-work? I keep seeing memes about it but I have no clue what it is..
---
You're partially correct, but he's also different in other ways. People still fall asleep, which is completely unique to Freddy. Also, billy does not teleport to generators. The fake pallets also explode in blood, which means the survivor may (?) be animation locked, which would allow a free hit.
---
Wtf lol. Guess they wanna celebrate after the event as well
---
Slave-dette and bds-meg
---
Wouldn't call placing exploding blood pallets the peak of engaging and fun gameplay.
---
That video is pure gold
---
I probably wouldnt go as far as to say i prefer the old one but yeah
---
How about you start whining when you have actually played him.
---
What does oc mean?
---
If we ever get emotes this needs to be one
---
just use mouse wheel for struggling
---
&gt;!I really enjoyed my Meg mask. I don't play her much but I think it's really pretty! The Trapper masks are mostly good but the deer one is pretty weak (it looks like that ugly Dweller's mask from a Hat in Time)
---
I've had some fun with it but I have a really hard time playing Scavenger. Tbh I probably just suck but I die almost every round. Still lots of fun though, and has a lot less grind than DbD
---
Thats why I tried to avoid the usual balance talk and focus more on the fun aspect
---
I used to do that, but you didnt answer my question
---
I approve this message
---
Ace and David at the same time. Because I want to.
---
I mean if I remember correctly Ghostface is just some random guy in the movies as well so it’s pretty perfect as far as I’m concerned. Ik it sucks we can’t get the normal outfit but I honestly like this outfit more as it looks almost like the entity rewarded him for being chill
---
Nice but still waiting for bunny feng
---
A slugging nurse is cancer and deserves every depip they can get
---
oh my, please bhvr, i want to give you my money!!!
---
RIP cashier Carl
---
I think devs confirmed last night that they can't exactly tell 
---
They may be able to tell the difference between dc and internet 
---
But they can't tell the difference between dc and pulling thr plug 
---
Maybe they should give you only penalty (10 min and more) if your internet fucks up or u pull the plug 
---
And if you dc in game it also costs you 20k bloodpoints up to 30k if you keep doing it 
---
Bloodpoints matter alot to people so punishing them with bps could be a step forward
---
I am sad to see current Freddy go, I love playing as him. 
---
BUT the rework seems cool. Hopefully the phasing is a real mindgame so survivors have to pick between mind games or false pallets / slowdown traps.
---
Doctor = huntress lullaby , overcharge , unnerving presence and distressing 
---
Legion, just discordance will do.
---
do you need a program to use your macro? if not it's most likely not bannable
---
This would just let you know where everyone is and make several perks useless though. I'd be fine with it being an add-on for a few killers but if it's just passive for every killer then it just sounds like hell for a survivor. Especially if they have dces. Nurse or Billy for example would make even quicker work of survivors.
---
It'll also make the protect-3-gen comps hell on earth.
---
I stop working on the gen and stare at them for a second when someone misses a skill check, then I usually miss one a few seconds later.
---
I dont, its built-in, i just need to bind the macro to the struggle key and im good
---
I am now under the impression that this subreddit is the worst of the worst of the DbD community.
---
I've never seen so many crybabies in one place in my life. 
---
Thanks for the laughs though.
---
IMAGINE WATCHING SOMEONE'S STREAM JUST TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT ON A FORUM 🤣
---
This is rad
---
The Doctor can find and track survivors faster than any other killer saving a massive amount of time. Whispers only tells you when a survivor is within 32 meters of you, the Doctor's power tells him an exact location after just a few seconds. The power also can be used to interrupt certain actions, but I would say that aspect is inconsistent at best, although he can consistently use it to interrupt loops like the window on Ironworks. Using any kind of Restraint add-on allows him to track multiple survivors across the map, which allows him to know where to apply pressure, and that combined with his madness skill checks can cause him to slow the game significantly.
---
You can modify the perks yourself if you want to. The devs confirmed they won't ban people for it. r/PerkByDaylight has some free perk packs posted by some generous people.
---
Why not both? Its a good combo
---
wait what? I didn't watch the stream but I read some things up on it and didn't here about this.
---
No one uses chode to talk about the perineum. That's dumb. Everyone uses it to describe a dick wider than it is long, and everyone know that.
---
The more you know. :)
---
They stopped stacking them and would have to get rid of one of my other perks :(
---
Matthieu is a qt confirmed
---
Billy is better but and since he's based off of leatherface I think that's the reason they gave Leatherface such a good perk set. I'm putting all my bloodpoints into leather-daddy to get his perks.
---
Tbh it gives me a goal and makes me wanna play more 
---
I think bloodweb is good as it is
---
*cries in silence*
---
This sounds so cool to play against and to play!
---
Some people dont know, but 2 people dont mean half the time
---
what bait? thats exactly what they do
---
Imagine being triggered by 4 letters....Bruh
---
tbh, i find his and Laurie's adept achievements the hardest to get
---
They made movement changes way in the past because 360s were too easy to pull off and they didn't like the game being about that. They want it to be more run and hide rather than run in circles and juke. Which would be fine, if every single other option wasn't entirely luck based.
---
Oh right
---
I could honesty get behind these being added to the game
---
Honestly I don't have any problem with Pale Rose, but *fuck* the Grim Pantry. I would rather play on Rotten Fields every day for the rest of my life if it meant that I never had to see Grim Pantry again.
---
My thoughts exactly. Hundreds of posts on here whining and complaining about the community and then everyone is surprised when they're all together LIVE and act the same way.
---
Hood Freddy 😎😎😎 epic s*x
---
most of those messages are people typing in all caps, as all caps gets you auto deleted.
---
Also saying ochido or noob3 also got you autodeleted.
---
Too many emotes also got you deleted. Thats why there is so many removed.
---
Noob3 has also been banned multiple times by devs.
---
yep free to celebrate the launch. on steam since about 2 days ago
---
They changed it so you couldn't block the hook save by facecamping but the definition has always been the same.
---
k.
---
All I know is they improved 360’s on recently by removing dead zones on the thumb sticks.
---
you really are dumb....
---
I believe he has been banned once, not multiple
---
I dunno about console. I'm a PC player.
---
The great thing about playing on console is almost nobody plays nurse, let alone while being good at her.
---
I hate the swamp so much. I feel like whoever designed those "buildings" has never seen a man-made structure before in their life.
---
15 of them in fact, there's enough time in 7 minutes (5 minutes looping+2 on hook) for 3 (**perkless**) survivors to fix 15 generators without toolboxes.
---
Add in toolbox and perks to make up for the brief time spent running between generators, profit.
---
They banned his main account, Ochido is like lifetime banned 😂
---
you have a few winter party starters
---
This is so true. It's not the looping it's the cocky attitude while doing it for me :/
---
You're not wrong 👀
---
Nurse isn’t comparable to anyone other killer in the game, she’s far beyond the other killers, she breaks the game, no one will deny she’s crazy op, but because she’s hard to play as it’s acceptable apparently.
---
Mods or really just replace the files
---
I actually want to know
---
If you want your points so badly, then suicide on a hook. Still an incredibly shitty thing to do to your team, but it’s within the bounds of the rules.
---
When will people learn that it's just Ez.
---
Ace is from 2017.
---
Omg this makes me think what a twisted version of a wizard of oz inspired killer and map would be like
---
Fixed that type right before you said it
---
Doesn’t bother me, the only good thing about chapters are perks and the killer anyway, survivors are just skins.
---
Myers, Doc, and Freddy.
---
I let me team do the heavy lifting to get this haha
---
Well ...
---
Yea - perks exist which is great. What I hate is that I feel forced to get them and not have space for anything else just for run. Every time I take BT off I regret it in the next match. DS is I guess the one I can live without the most recently but still prefer to have.
---
&gt;People that get 0 gens done after you get downed from your 5 minute chase.
---
*Doing gens, you?*
---
Well this is awkward....

So true!

---
Yeah, that definitely sounds like a bug. I have absolutely seen people’s heads pop going into the exit gates since the EGC was added.
---
Killers think survivors playing well is toxic nowadays, you're toxic whatever you do.
---
Yeah she's on a different level I admit, I'm just throwing her there because she's still in the game, still crazy OP, and you can't say killers have the short stick when she exists the way she does.
---
But like I said above, even without her killers still have an easy time; it's just a matter of "but i dont want to play x". You can't call for survivor nerfs when you still have powerful tools like the clown, nurse, legion, and other stuff to counter loops.
---
Loops are only powerful vs a set few killers, and that's if they decide to tunnel a single survivor all game and the survivor manages to get to the right moment at the right time. Killers SHOULD be punished if they dont even try to play smart, but as it is right now, they don't.
---
Keep in mind the devs did say if for whatever reason it does get detected and you get banned they will not help you
---
Jeez, glad u got someone other than doctor lol. Every game for 5 games I had last night was a doctor lol
---
As a survivor player primarily, can confirm. Fucking hate clowns. Love playing em though.
---
are the archives like the krypt in mkx?
---
My disappointment is simply in not getting Sidney; now I can't simulate ogling Neve Campbell all day like I did in my youth... :(
---
August 30, 2015
---
But... The Scarecrow was in need for a brain and Claudette is the smart in the group
---
Well, the thing they are trying to do with the loops stuff is make less of those super safe loops where there is no mind game on them, if they exist survivors can just abuse it and it takes no skill to use them.
---
Yes it is bannable, its just that right now they don't detect it because their anti cheat is stupid. I would not worry about being banned for using Macros but i don't use them myself.
---
He's not really defending it as much as he is saying just don't let it make you mad. I mean if t bags make you mad to the point that you go online and rant about it, you probably shouldn't be playing competitive multiplayer games.
---
You gain more defensive but they are less op. Have you guys even considered the power of the jungle gyms
---
You're right, Thrilling Tremors might make a good combo with Pop Goes The Weasel, especially on high mobility killers. I didn't think about that
---
What if it's a mate they regularily drink tea with?
---
well it happened to me without knowing how.
---
Unarguably? Honestly, it's debatable. Leatherface had literally no benefits whereas you always get a free hit with Freddy. (Just pull them in right beside you.) Legion was pretty bad because it was hard to disperse reliable damage, and trapper relies entirely on well placed traps, which they may or may not see.
---
CONTEXT: Before all of this, i kept approaching the generator when he kicked it so he obviously saw that the gene was tapped again. (For people who will assume I faked it)
---
I kinda have a bad feeling about that rework.
---
Sure some loops are too good, but if you make every pallet unsafe then you'll just get bloodlusted on every pallet.
---
i defend Freddy's current power and i don't think that he was the worst killer. But to be honest, i can't deny this new power is much better than his old power. They just need to make the dream world an actual threat in his rework
---
Yea. Too bad the killer in the OP depipped for only getting 3k. I hope they rework the ranking system.
---
I have nothing against loops, i have problem with nearly infinites, they are problem because it's not fighting for the life it's running in circle till killer DC cuz he can't catch you
---
Those loops aren't the ones mentioned in the stream tho.
---
Everytime a billy run bbq
---
By running faster than you, vaulting over obstacles normal killers are blocked by, hitting you, LoS'ing you and watching you bleed out as you continue to try and loop him? Alternatively, if he just wants to apply pressure on the map he can just hit you and wallhack his way to the rest.
---
Plague range spits on you till you go down if you try to forever loop her.
---
On the other hand there are enough exploits and strong pallet loops in the game at the moment that getting a kill in the first three minutes (time until 3 survivors complete generators including running between them) is pretty difficult, especially since you often won't get a hook in the 80 seconds before 3 pop.
---
Getting your kill with NOED is definitely more legit than avoiding a down because Adrenaline popped, given how ridiculously easy Adrenaline is to activate and how uncounterable it is (will even proc off the hook, that'd be like NOED proccing with all totems down).
---
They can't remove those, even if you fix certain tiles you will not fix the rng system.
---
The loop might be perfectly fine by itself, but if rng spawns several of them together then you will often have some really op setups that require bloodlust/entity blocker, otherwise you just have to let them go.
---
I'm all ears can be good on smaller TR killers, Terrors sounds pretty decent and the ability to change your obsession is the main thing on that other perk. Imagine it with something like save the best for last.
---
I don't understand why the killer doesn't just break all the pallets before they get knocked down.
---
You think they'll use his Scream origin then?
---
Wait wait wait a loop rework?
---
That would be **Angry**pug.
---
Would be fine to me, unless killers had such a good amount of killers who don't need to mindgame you to kill you anyway. Why would clown need to mindgame you when he can just hold W and throw bottles to slow you anyway.
---
Freddy is going to have some serious synergy with Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
To me you sound like a salty suvivior who is bad at this game.
---
Suvucrios are always at an advantage because it's a 4v1. If the killer can't down somone fast enough, they have no pressure and thus will lose quickly.
---
Suviviors can out play every killer yes including nurse if they are smart.
---
ruin isn't necessary on nurse
---
New killer leak, “Cockzilla”
---
But I'm serious. Like it's just free cosmetics for playing. People keep bring up this pay to win excuse but never tell me what skins, or bloodpoints, or charms or anything in the pass that's really going to do something that's game changing.
---
I will give you the first one, and the first one alone.
---
Dont like it,  not interested. Asymmetrical horror games I enjoy. FPS games I do not. They have marketed that game to the wrong demographic.  But I hope it does well...just not my bag.
---
When does this happen in stream?
---
Whoah, how did I miss that?
---
Not really, it doesn't matter that there is more pallets if every single one of them is unsafe for the survivor. 
---
With safe pallets the killer has to kick them, giving you valuable time to get away. With unsafe pallets the killer can just go around them and ignore them, getting a free hit with bloodlust as you can't evade him at that speed.
---
Those... are not the add-ons for Omegablink, other points aside
---
That's just not how battlepasses work though
---
Idk but i just looked it up after reading your comment lol
---
The most valid reason they have is: They're afraid of missing out to not get that 100% wich really just says something about themselves.
---
WTF? Are you high? What's next, giving points to the player with the best lag? For F sake.
---
yeah have fun walking around everywhere
---
Strongest pallet in the game tbh, you have so many options there.
---
Too bad all of the options lead to you getting hit because it's a fucking awful pallet.
---
I think eventually, they will remove perk tiers entirely.
---
Yeah that's what I'm worried about too.
---
The wonderful wizard of saws
---
That is one meaty looking stick
---
Absolute favorite thing to do
---
"Try playing red ranks".
---
I am in red ranks.
---
"your only catching them if they make a mistake, as you and the survivor will just be holding W until you eventually catch up, and then you get stunned + break pallet."
---
And then the pallet is gone. If it was one of your oh so dreaded infinite loops, it's suddenly not so infinite anymore. See the issue? The survivor will eventually get caught if he does this. YES it will cost a shit ton of killer time (depending on the killer...), but it's the ONLY way for survivors to stay alive and even that is only for a certain amount of time and ONLY counters tunneling killers for a limited amount of time. It only slightly punishes tunneling killers.
---
I hope they go the route of Wraith and just have fun with it.  I remember a post about a freddy rework where he could trap lockers to lock survivors in them or make sense have Nightmare skill checks, that basically are difficult to hit that injure you on miss.
---
I think the behavior of some Claudettes in game would not follow that...
---
Nah Yamaoka Estate is straight up unfair for the killer if there’s Claudettes.
---
Neat
---
Sorry but i dont think we can get to a agreement here. I respect your own opinion, of course, but ill stay with mine. I think a 4 second stun is a small price to pay for a free hit. And even if the survivor gets to a safe place, which they most likely will after any hit because of the little boost, a normal chase starts. The chances of losing them are higher, but most of the people should be able to follow the scratch marks, blood or even just the moans of pain
---
You may be good and experienced in the game but you sure can't hold a conversation or use logic, twisting other person's words and spawning fake arguments out of thin air.
---
Or it's the other way around. That's more satisfying, getting your revenge
---
Discordance, Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel and less we forget, Tinkerer.  
---
Freddy is gonna be a gen guardian depending on his potential teleport cooldown.
---
I'm so fucking happy😭.
---
Freddy Mains RISE UP!
---
the OG robe is not coming probably,since it's Scream IP and not ghostface
---
This is me in general and regardless of map.
---
I hope there won't be an add on that removes the indicator for gen teleport.
---
That hurts me because i spent 1mill on spirit not too long ago and got like 3 if that.
---
There's also MacMillan which is basically a matching color palette to her.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peFfFHqBk-c
---
Rudimentary edit but I always wanted a nicer full head of hair Nea. Also there are plenty cool skater girls with long full heads of hair!
---
I bought Freddy a long time ago. He’s a rework with new mechanics, not a new Killer.
---
&gt; I am in red ranks. 
---
Red ranks for killer?
---
&gt; but it's the ONLY way for survivors to stay alive
---
You can hide from the killer you know, you can juke them you know, theres more ways to surviving then running around pallets holding W for 2 minutes and occasionally throwing pallets till the killer catches you.
---
OK not that one, but there are some obsession perks it could pair well with. I don't remember the name but it's the one that gives movespeed
---
Billy also has to move in a line so it doesn't always work
---
This doesn't force survivors to play killer or vice versa. This is just a small bloodpoint multiplier to one side to balance out the queues. Again, no ones being forced to play the other side, but just encouraged.
---
It's exploitive, which is why they're looking into changing it.
---
Lol is this post a joke?
---
I do get what your saying and your stupid and wrong. You just sound salty and mad from a bad game.
---
Okay you got me, I didn't know he had been nerfed. Still not a survivor too stronk issue, but more a legion isn't as strong as the other killer's issue. Even if you can abuse loops on legion differently than some other kills, it doesn't mean that loops needs to be nerfed. This is actually an example on why loops needs to exist if anything, if they don't legion is just gonna rush and kill you and there's nothing you can do to save yourself, how is that fun?
---
Despite that, after the nerfs he's one of the weaker anti-loopers but doesn't change the fact that there are countless of other very strong anti-loopers if you truly distaste survivors who dare to survive for a some seconds.
---
They can't bring it back cause it's red
---
He does the best ad reads ever, you gotta admit
---
I said address, not apologise or admit...
---
A trick that I madly abuse is this When its maxed and they’re actually smart to get closer look down and blink
---
Me when I see a comment that makes no sense...
---
How does one whine withiut knowing what its about. Example plz?
---
ace in the hole is actually pretty good for hoarding addons and items when combined with plunderer
---
I mean, this is the closest we're likely to get to Scream 5. His lore is incredibly interesting, and I like his look.
---
But this isnt exactly for the bloodpoints, but rather to balance out queues. It just encourages more people to play killer if there are too many survivors queuing. And some people don't realize that killers make more BP anyways, so it would be more noticeable if it was said under the "play as killer" button
---
Pretty much at the very start
---
Nurse can be mind gamed besides the fact everyone knows its unfair to use nurse to compare to anything. And don't insult me because I'm right. You can out play every killer, mind game vs nurse, move differently so she can't hit you. Juke her blinks.
---
I'm a killer main, I'm rank 16. But I watch high level rank 1 players play both killer and suvivior and they do what I said
---
Radical!
---
Nope.
---
Ooooh stop it... As if you would enjoy playing the game if everyone was on basic perks. You wouldn't cause they are garbage. Except noed/adren
---
"Red ranks for killer?"
---
Yup, but I play it much less because I don't enjoy it.
---
"You can hide from the killer you know, you can juke them you know, theres more ways to surviving then running around pallets holding W for 2 minutes and occasionally throwing pallets till the killer catches you through bloodlust or you making a mistake."
---
Hiding works until you inevitably get found. Juking will buy you a little time at best case scenario, but it's almost impossible to juke red ranked killers, but sure it can work once in a blue moon.
---
If you're talking about hiding from killers during a chase, that's impossible unless you luck out (I'd say 1 out of 10 chance) or the killer is bad.
---
Not necessarily stunning
---
Just a small trip
---
Haha yeah it’s “Show the love guys” which over time has just become “Shalob”.
---
Rest of it is “You get the Cap, Emotes and Linkage, welcome to the Tru3munnity” Which is just a running inside joke for him to say it so fast you can’t tell what it is.
---
Still a waste, then.
---
I would give 20$ for a scaredy cat dwight skin.Please BHVR uWu
---
I made this :)
---
I like it a lot I'm glad it is making a comeback
---
Dwood*
---
I do well. Probably better than you. Doesn't change the fact that survivors dont need more nerfs, and killers aren't weak. I'm salty, but not because of a particular game, just because the game is going in the wrong direction. I'm calling people who call me dumb, because they're dumb, ez fact.
---
They are though? One loop pops up on nearly every instance of Michael's map. There should be no obstacle in the game that forces the killer to break chase on a survivor they can clearly see. That's fundamentally game breaking to the design of the game itself.
---
This is awesome!  It is very detailed and looks pretty much exactly like in the game!  Good job!
---
HOW DID THAT HIT WHAT?!?
---
Ain't it the truth, ain't it the truth!

---
only char model changes, having these stereotypes about using certain char models is pretty cringe
---
I said address, not apologise or admit... If he were to address these allegations and prove through evidence that these allegations are false, then more people are inclined to believe him. However, the fact is he has not addressed any of these allegations, and his former “friends” started to distance themselves from him, make it seem that these allegations are true.
---
Lol good point.
---
You're stupid, dumb and wrong. Gottem.
---
I'm salty, but not because of a particular game, just because the game is going in the wrong direction.
---
agreed
---
*notices your locker
---
OwO
---
Whatta cutie
---
Truth hurts, so they will downvote. Many players just want to think they're good and anything that gets in the way of that must be toxic lol.
---
Faced 3 Claudette SWF's yesterday in that Map, I am now suffering from chronic anxiety
---
I've read pretty much every comment posted on here, and to be blunt you just seem salty, and are complaining about some stuff that was literally patched already (for example, legion being nerfed). Even if the killers are "favored" it's FOUR AGAINST ONE, so they SHOULD be favored.
---
Delete this
---
Personally I've been playing a lot of no mither to get the injured healer achievement and I'm honestly loving no mither. Grant it I do play more casually than other people.
---
Did you ever played this game as a killer especially against 4 man SWF?  Sounds like you have no knowledge about it.
---
Damn you BHVR why did you have to confirm rewards for ranks my desk just fell over because of that.
---
Wat?
---
Wow filming a screen - vertically. I need a 60fps gif right now.
---
Thats what makes it more interesting though. He doesnt just flash a big sign saying "ill be there in 5 seconds" and just fucking appear there
---
Honestly, I'd love this game in every way if the SWF players quit.... but yeah, you're definitely right in a general not-salty-like-me sense.
---
Still think it's Bullshit that Puppers was getting all his messages deleted for no reason.
---
Lol you haven't even explained how I'm wrong. Your just salty to be salty with no proof as to why. I have.
---
My main issue is that this game has a $20 barrier to entry with $70+ in DLC (If you want all killers/survivors/perks to play with) with a full cosmetic shop and now a battle pass. It's a Free 2 Play game with a $20 entry fee. Buying just the base game might as well just be DbD Trial Version now. I have no problem with these systems existing but at this point it might as well be a F2P game.
---
They revealed them all towards the end of the big livestream yesterday.
---
Maybe more interesting to you. I don't agree
---
Since I brought Deliverance I was the first one on the hook
---
If it doesn't include skins that can be bought separately, but just has it's own, that'd be bad.
---
That wasn’t edgy it was spicy as hell
---
Since I brought Deliverance I was the first one on the hook and I still jumped off
---
I was the first one on the hook and I still jumped off
---
Yeah, I don't understand how people can think its not toxic to TRY to piss other players off. Toxic, BM, or just being a dick about it are all one and the same and cover things like tbagging.
---
I was the first one on the hook and still jumped off, and I was running no mither
---
If you do better than me...why are you bitching? Ppl don't comprehend what ur saying? na man everyone gets what you are saying...and pretty much everyone agrees ur wrong but hey i'm just a dummy what do ik?
---
I'm salty. I'm not complaining about anything in particular other than killers thinking they're being treated like shit and need more buffs when they're actually strong as shit.
---
Which they are, but they're favoured to the point where they get free 4k wins 9/10 games, and even then they cry about toxic mechanics while running around with NOED, Nurse and other disgusting free-win tools which close to break the game.
---
At the end he's going to get looped for 5 gens like most killers.
---
Cheers!
---
I’m loving DBD at the moment. I’m keen to hear suggestions of what I could do next
---
None of the tools in this game are "free-win"by themselves
---
Thanks
---
I always watch anything from the dev's with twitch chat turned off, I really enjoyed the anniversary stream yesterday  and had no idea how bad it was until I saw this today. :(
---
Yeah Scavenger is pretty hard because if the Hunter finds you it's pretty much over for you
---
please double back again AUUUUGH
---
There are many attractive folks working at Bhvr! I’m team Mcote.  It’s not a competition but if it were that would be the winning team.
---
They won't necessarily all be unsafe, though. We'll have to wait and see what happens when they come out really.
---
This is so god damn adorable! And the details are amazing!
---
Don't be worried, they had a small team and they've been hiring more people so they're capable of more pushes on multiple fronts. 
---
Supporting dead by daylight and having the community grow is what allowed them to grow faster and produce more
---
Only the Hunter is in FP so it's not really an FPS game.
---
I’m glad I was watching on YouTube and on console so I didn’t have to see any of the toxic comments on the livestream. It pisses me off how childish and rude people will be when they’re anonymous behind a screen.
---
"If you do better than me...why are you bitching?"
---
because its not about if i do better than you or not, guess you didnt comprehend that.
---
There won't be a survivor and the perks have been revealed during the stream
---
neither is looping
---
Survivors are still in full control of the game unless they really need the insane loops like crotus penn
---
I never said it was 😂😂😂
---
Believe it or not, when I played on Xbox (I play PC now) id get invited to party chats where nearly 100% of the people in them were 10-13 year olds and im not even joking.
---
Why do people hate on his besides the above?
---
Can you explain to me that build? I wanna expand my Freddy builds just a lil bit.
---
You forgot clown because of the slow-down traps.
---
The word “noob” or his physical username?
---
I'm not talking about the fact that you posted it here, but looks like you're just spamming "It's a shitpost." on every comment, so you do you.
---
Is it worth doing with the Freddy Rework coming?
---
WHOA just wear what YOU’VE ALREADY got? i NEv3r w0ulD h@ve TH0UghT 0f tHAt
---
Because people fail to understand that this gameplay was posted as a joke to portray how stupid it is to complain about survivors.
---
You could do most of the powers from the other killers. Bear traps chainsaws ect. Sadly I don't think there is an item for legion or Freddy or hag ect. You could also do some of the items like medkits or keys
---
Is there a way for helping your chronic anxiety?
---
Got to love Bricky
---
Dont like how Ghostface can crouch at full MS though, specially after how they gutted pig's endgame
---
God really ? I have over 1000 and don’t even have adept huntress.
---
After all, it’s the way the character is *supposed* to look. 
---
🤯
---
oh sorry i wasnt able to watch it
---
what are the perks :D
---
nope but i ddont run gay shit that you cant counter
---
Mind if I put this as a TL;DR on the original post?
---
Hey, I wasn't asking *why* you're commenting the same thing on every comment without reading them. I'm not the internet police, there's no need to justify yourself.
---
Indirectly, by calling me salty, complaining and that killers should be favoured when the whole thread is pretty much made because of the loop rework.
---
Tbh I love it
---
If this isn't an issue that affects you then this isn't a post for you, move on with your day.
---
lol what if i want my killers and survivors look good? skins≠skills
---
but default Dwight is best Dwight &lt;3
---
Honestly they can be annoying and childish, but at least they are warm and welcoming. I've been to some chats where people are so nasty to each other. No0b's chat is all there to just have a good time and be silly, which I can appreciate over the alternative.
---
Oh stop with your "indirectly" bullshit. I told you exactly how I feel, you're being a bitch over a change that was needed because you're not winning games as often, it's as simple as that
---
I’m going to go over each and every one of the things bad about this, and I’ll be nitpicky asf
---
1. Prescott not Presscot
---
2: Why does Sidney have one perk?
---
3: Apparently ‘Blend In’ isn’t part of his power, it’s an ‘ability’
---
4: There won’t be room for ‘payphones’ on the map.
---
5: A skill check is far too easy to turn the phones off.
---
6: ‘Hacking’ is ridiculous
---
7: ‘Hacking’ is also OP
---
8: Blend In is beyond terrible 
---
9: DBD isn’t for playing ‘minigames’. Try CoolMathGames.
---
10: Two Ghostfaces is also terrible. I don’t fancy 1FPS gameplay.
---
11: Showing the survivor’s aura for 5 seconds is too long.
---
12: BHVR already told us EVERYTHING we need to know about GF.
---
13: There is no survivor coming out.
---
Then feel free to use skins. Just hope that the battlepass doesn't contain the best skins for the characters you like.
---
I'm All Ears: When a survivor performs an action while sprinting (vaulting, going into a locker) outside your terror radius their aura is revealed to you for 6 seconds
---
Thrilling Tremors: When you pick up a survivor (works when you grab someone off something too) all generators that are not currently being worked on will be blocked for 16 seconds and shown with a white aura (like Surveillance)
---
Furtive Chase: Creates an obsession. When you hook the obsession, gain 1 token, up to 2/3/4 tokens. Every token reduces your terror radius by 4m while in a chase. When the obsession is unhooked, the unhooker becomes the new obsession
---
And I love this, it's a clever loop hole and basically they can do whatever with ghostface and add more cosmetics for ghostface.
---
That one is Ochido, not No0b.
---
By all means old chap
---
I still see people run it for the BP. I think if they added both a positive and a negative it would dissuade farming. It could show the killer the aura of the person unhooking for a few seconds, or gives them exposed. But it also does something beneficial to the unhooked, like seeing the killer's aura or leaving no scratch marks/blood trail for 5 seconds.
---
Thanks 👍🏻
---
Well said
---
I could understand it a couple years ago, but he's so much more chill now. I don't care for his videos because of the random sound effects and Three Stooges music, but his streams are laid back and I like lurking there.
---
You know tbh I was really scared they would make Freddy into something that he’s not but they really did a 180 on him and made him into a Freddy that will feel like Freddy. I can’t wait to make blood spurt out of a gen and then show up to survivors like SURPRISE BITCH!
---
I personally don’t mind a battle pass, but I don’t think that there should be a payed one. I know, BHVR is a company at the end of the day and they need their money to maintain and update the game but the fact that you have to pay for the game, you need to buy some (mainly licenced) dlc is you want to play killers like the pig and Micheal, then adding a paid battle pass on top of that? I think it’s asking too much of the dedicated players who buy all the dlc and cosmetics because of how much they love this game.
---
Thats all reasonable to say except the "dirty game" part. Why is it the killers fault they're playing properly but the survivors are solo and lack the good perks? The game was originally intended to be played without communication anyway.
---
Going easy on survivors gets you teased too much in my experience if they somehow dont notice you letting someone get a head start in a chase or such "nice killer" actions, so if youre new or unprepared then its a trial by fire until you get better. Niceties are for farming during events.
---
But it's just cosmetics? Why do you(I'm saying you but I mean anyone really) need every DLC AND cosmetic? Why does anyone NEED everything? 
---
Well regardless of why, if someone wants EVERYTHING then they should understand it going to cost them the most money. 
---
You want EVERY Pop character? Expensive.
---
You want EVERY Pokemon card? Expensive.
---
You want EVERY Comic book of Amory Wars? EXPENSIVE.
---
I don't understand how people that want EVERYTHING want it for the same price as people that just want some or a few things. 
---
This game is nowhere near to being F2P. Hell the 2 top tier killers come with the base game, an you don't even need the DLC perks to be top Rank with them.
---
I just seems to me, that battle passes have a bad reputation because of other games.  An regardless of how little the pass affects the game people grab their torches and pitchforks an scream from the rooftops.
---
I personally will never get the pass, because I do not give a single shit about cosmetics, but that doesn't mean I don't want other people to have nice things to spend their money on.
---
by your logic keys arent cheap as you still need to complete a decent amount of gens to have the hatch available. all of those (except the irid king , which i didnt mention. no idea why did you tbh) are tremendous shortcuts. maybe 1 person dont use those every game, but if you play red ranks you gonna run into those more often than not. if you think having your work cut off in half to finish the game isn't gamebreaking i really don't know what to tell you.
---
i don't mind paying for my characters to look good. i love that bhvr doesn't give in game buffs for real money so i'll gladly waste a bunch on cosmetics and battlepass, sounds fair to me. besides, more things to accomplish in game is pretty cool. 
---
one thing i hate about battlepass though is that they add it instead of certain rewards for devotion. my near devotion is just... there... not doing anything for me. sad :c
---
he is pretty decent
---
Ah, then this post wasn't directed at you because you don't have an issue with battlepasses.
---
i don't understand why you have it.
---
And report....I wish they had random, delayed notifications for when your reports get banned. No identifiers, just "someone you reported got banned, thanks for helping keep our community a good place" sort of like Blizzard with Overwatch. It makes reporting toxic asses feel alot more impactful, and easier to move on from with no hard feelings.
---
Meg being the obsession is such a nice detail
---
Man they deserved this, Round is over but they couldn't let that one guy go. 
---
Heading into the basement with the killer there is totally suicide
---
It

KILLERS

Basement
---
Yah, I remember hearing about it on the news and seeing stuff pop up on YouTube.
---
Depends on what you define as winning. I rank up [way] more than I de-rank, so I guess I'm winning. So you're wrong.
---
The ranking system is a whole different thread for me though. I'm just complaining about the loop reword because they're not as needed as you guys make it out to be. It's actually not needed at all.
---
It can be cancelled which leaves room for mind games, you can potentially use it to scare a survivor off a gen but get a free hit in if they're ballsy enough to stay on it.
---
Having studied psychology for a few years now and knowing vulnerable people (along with my own terrible impulse spending in the past) I've learned to hate this sort of time exclusive paid content because it creates pressure on people to buy it.
---
This isn't just an issue with battlepasses exclusively, it's an issue with all forms of limited time content that has exclusive rewards that will never return.
---
It's easier to say than 44/80th time
---
hell yeah!
---
This comment was pretty cute tbh, I'm gonna upvote it.
---
I think both sides have advantages to balance each other out
---
Wa ha ha
---
Yeah for the longest I always play high and always heard something in lobbies. Thought it was my browser or something but could never find anything so thought I was tripping lmao
---
To Infinity and BEYOND!!!
---
The problem is that a battlepass encourages people to play more than they normally would. This is a problem because game addiction is a real thing and a battlepass rewards unhealthy behaviour.
---
It's also anti-consumer because you are forced to take cosmetics you don't want to get the ones you want further down the pass progression (obviously if you like everything this point is irrelevant to you).
---
There is literally no advantage for consumers that a battlepass has over already established cosmetic distribution methods, such as the store.
---
i majored in philosophy with a year of criminal and ordinary psychology studies and see no problem with this particular battlepass since it only brings cosmetics and you can see the content there and freely decide if you need it. if it would give a buff then yeah, that's pressure.
---
As long as they are yellow and that would be so dope!
---
Don't diss our man Monto. Even if it is a "LITTLE BIT"
---
I agree with most of your nitpics here
---
as i was mostly just jotting it down so i would remember it
---
the minigames part is subjective as me and some friends love going into kill your friends and doin little games and such
---
and the other thing was I just found access to the chapter info as i have shitty australian internet.
---
Hacking is mostly cause i wanted to incorporate the Scream "do you like scary movies" kinda feel
---
also the misspelling it because I havent seen scream in a while
---
Also I realize now Blend In is useless as I havent seen someon in a locker in ages
---
lastly the reason for one perk is because I was going to add on in replies as coming up with perks can take a while
---
No, you need to shave dem legs!
---
I don't think we're getting this Freddy until early August late July so why not
---
dont forget generators spewing blood when he teleports to them.
---
I'll buy it if I love at least half the skins in the pass.
---
I love how DS is now, it serves its purpose. I can't just be tunneled off hook now
---
I’d be more happy if you could get it with shards as well. I’m not to fond on the battle pass but I’m not hating on it.
---
They are going to rank you based on how you perform vs other people playing the same killer.
---
I been seeing the opsite someone says they do not like it and I see them getting just shit on with downvotes
---
Unfortunately, if you try to implement such mechanics in DbD you get really boring game play.
---
Because most of the people in this community are whiny sons of bitches, just look at the chat in the 3 year anniversary stream, unappreciative assholes..
---
If only all brains were rational like that, unfortunately they're not. Impulse buyers, game addicts, people with OCD etc. are all harmed by this system and it can cause a lot of problems for them. I myself have had to quit fortnite because of it as it caused me that much stress to do the passes within the time limit and if I failed then it felt like a kick in the gut that never faded away because that reminder of an almost complete pass is always there.
---
I don't expect the average person to understand these issues which is why I specifically target this post towards people who do have these issues and/or understand why it's a problem for people like us.
---
Yeah I get its not entirely relevant to this post but Ill take my opportunities
---
Best thing mentioned was the fact that they said theyre gonna be punishing disconnects finally. Greatest part of all of this.
---
To ALL the Nintendo Switch players... HAVE FUN WITH YOUR HORRIBLE FRAME RATE GAME! 
---
That Is All.
---
I just can’t believe it was that bad, when my nephew who plays Fortnite on his switch and they all look the same across all platform versions of Fortnite!
---
Insidious camping a t-bagging Nea in the basement helps I've heard
---
lOouhh xhcg ggoi u hih ioiovtvzzrsdaareaawwwtssestr:4/
---
I'm glad there are others who understand the actual issues rather than just saying "lol don't buy it". I wish I had a neurotypical brain so that this stuff doesn't bother me but unfortunately it does and like you mentioned, it rewards me for unhealthy behaviour. 
---
Breaking free of Fortnite was difficult because these systems are so addictive and since I did that I ended up going cold turkey with cosmetics in any game that had any form of paid cosmetic which is what prompted me to make this post.
---
True, but he's literally countered by being seen unlike Amanda, because I recall they mentioned if a survivor keeps line of sight of him for more than a second straight he's forced to end the crouch
---
The vine sound clips he uses seriously fucking kill me every time. I miss vine so much.
---
That was never a hag perk, and it doesn't add a bunch of extra totems, nor did it ever.
---
All it does is give a notification for when a survivor is cleansing a hex totem and slow down the process.  It also grants bonus BP for the hunter category.
---
glad that shitty perk it's gone, i never understood what's so fun about being slugged and dribbled constantly
---
Honestly if they do it like the Fortnite one where you only have to buy the first one then you can earn the rest by playing enough I'll be 100% on board with it.
---
And that 5 second stun is glorious.
---
Because I'm the one who said it and I'm a filthy Killer main I guess.
---
The snares and fake pallets will probably help a lot
---
They definitely are, the devs have said in the past that the game is not meant to be played with voice chat which is why they purposefully omitted it from their game.
---
I tried using other killers, but as soon i  got bullied i go back to my Billy. The fookers never bullied me again.
---
That’s really cute
---
Having the huge main road to run across is really convenient though.
---
I just wanna cut those straps around his shoulders so I can see that bod
---
Ok so this build is a mix of Monto's End Game build with addons that I find really useful. Use BBQ to locate survivors, Ruin stalls the game, Blood Warden &amp; NOED are the finishers if they complete the gens. I use Nancy sketch to increase my range for ease of sleeping survivors &amp; Class Photo is my Ace in the hole, being able to sleep multiple survivors helps with keeping track of them and stall gen progression. Ive had people tell me Ruin just helps them wake up easier, which it does but the benefit Ruin gives with stalling the game is worth it. Plus with Class Photo Im never really struggling to re-sleep survivors. This build is all about keeping survivors asleep/protecting the totem and stall, stall, stall.
---
Watch Army of Darkness, you'll see the real Ash, he's not a super serious guy at all.
---
[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/)
---
Traditionally, no, but who cares? The devs are free to take liberties with the battlepass. There isn't a hard rule in place that they have to use it in any specific way. Also, they would probably make more money that way.
---
Thank you!
---
So muscular 😍
---
I have some really good headsets and like the challenge of solely tracking by audio. Its really satisfying, you really feel like some fast ass invisible predator that the survivors have no idea about if its gonna pounce them. Then BBQ+Discordance+surveillance and you got. yourself a absolute monster.
---
Don’t tell me what to do
---
I believe that was the intent tbh. It's meant to look like some old-timey swamp city. But some of the structures on that map take my suspension of disbelief and beat it to death with a baseball bat.
---
Funny seeing Siege mentioned here, I almost exclusively play R6 and DBD. Are you by any chance the pro player? Or just a dedicated fan :o
---
well... it's good that you're able to solve this for yourself with certain practice. would assume it's also the reason you went to study psychology. 
---
but do tell me, if you'd see this post would it even matter to you? pretty sure people with issues you listed can only help themselves or can get personal help from a specialist. so frankly i see your post bit useless in this matter unless you mostly made it for yourself as part of practice of your own issues, yet another reminder. i do that too quite a lot regarding different matters so i'm not shaming or anything.
---
JenDenise and Scott do it as a joke. Clearly the concept of "Having a laugh" doesn't appear in your dictionary.
---
I think it was looking at him for 5s(?), but miss piggy needs something rn. Speaking as a pig main of course
---
Only 6 weeks later!
---
Hot AF
---
Honestly I just think that doing a gen while a trap is active should reduce the timer an additional 30 seconds. Give her a bit more threat in the midgame and also play up her theme and stall goals
---
I'm literally only disappointed by the no Cashier guy Carl.
---
Like even they just released him as a skin an no perks I'd be chill with that, give me that thick sad boy an his scared puppy eyes. Lol
---
Everything else I agree with OP, we just got Ash an now were getting just Ghostface. 
---
The lack of map does suck but we're getting 4 reworked maps and they said something about truly randomized map layouts or something that all sounds good to me.
---
As long as Ghostface is $5 like LF was I'll be chill about getting him.
---
I know I am making a sweeping generalization but I believe majority of those idiot's are high schoolers or lower. Guaranteed. There may be a small fraction of them that are actual adults with high school or middle school maturity levels, but most are kids.
---
It really makes me want us to start using a "real id" type system like some countries to completely block out the kids too young to play the game.
---
Good bois gunna murder someone to heck.
---
Monitor and Abuse is going to be even better on Freddy now.
---
His name or anything similar (No0b3, noob3 etc)
---
I just dislike it coz I want them to focus on other things. I can’t believe this is something they even focused on for a second. Are skins really a priority for anyone?
---
Except the introduction of a battlepass doesn't mean they're going to stop releasing cosmetics in the store, so there's no point in doing so.
---
I think that map is fine but it suffers from the "Too big for ~~Smash~~ Dead by Daylight" problem similar to Red Forest and a lot of the other older maps. Games on that map are really boring as you're hardly ever found and have hours to hide from the Killer, especially if you're running Spine Chill or Premonition.
---
I think a lot of maps would be a lot better if they got a similar treatment to the swamp maps and were made much smaller overall. Just trim some of the fat on the edges of the map so walking from one side to another doesn't take the better half of an afternoon.
---
I don't think this would work terribly well to get killers to switch to survivor b/c survivor BP, even boosted slightly, is still scraps compared to killer BP. I don't think this would work to get survivors to switch to killer, either, b/c by playing survivor they are already turning down the increased BP of killer for reasons other than BP, so upping the BP gap slightly likely wouldn't do much to change their minds.
---
Tl;dr I don't think this would be much more effective than an indicator that says which queue is faster (unless the multiplier is too large, which would be its own problem).
---
the PLAAAG dude
---
Probably. On PlayStation, you can barely find a DbD party without one or two (or more) kids
---
“It lets the killer end the game if theyre not having fun” is certainly not a significant reason for the endgame update lol.  
---
I don’t like being left on my first hook until I hit second phase, why not add a mechanic to automatically unhook me when it gets to that point?
---
I don't care if ruin is up or not, I always go for great skill checks. Too many points not to.
---
WELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH!
---
Survivor Adepts are easy, I literally got Ace's adept in a single try like a week ago an he straight up has the worst perks in the game lol.
---
My favourite part is that its going to diversify the meta a bit(only by 1 perk, but still) by giving people a reason to run SB
---
I mean, I understand what problems there might be for certain people, but I think its definitley possible to trancsend that feeling of preassure
---
Been playing since May 2017. I don't like it.
---
He’s wholesome coz he is willing to spend money on a video game? Supporting a company that already has enough money from the base game, DLCs, skins, and soon to be battlepass? You’re easy to please.
---
Ok first then going to address your issue of changing your gameplay to counterpart that is counterplay.
---
In the same way that you restrict your healing if the killer has nurses calling or work on separate generators if the killer has discordance.
---
Second thing difference between decisive strike counterplay and no one escapes death count to play was there no one escapes death is something that you can counter without having to equip any perks. 
---
I asked decisive strike or at least the old one way Ahead to equip the Perk or hope you can dribble a survivor to a hook which always wasn't always possible.
---
As for the totem counter I'm actually fine of this idea as long as it's attached to something like small games my problem with it being in the base kit is that it's giving way too much free information with no penalty.
---
What's the point of using of a perks if you have a bunch of information given to you for free meaning you could just basically run your meta perks it keeps the builds very stagnant.
---
As for noed having a time limit this was already a version of no one escapes death existed however it turned the game into a very annoying everyone just basically runs and hides for the time to wait out.
---
It used to be 2 minutes and everyone we just basically run off and hide in a locker. 
---
I guess with the new endgame collapse this probably might be a little bit more possible as they can't hide it the killer opens the exit but still
---
I don't care what the other survivor does or thinks. I'll still stay.
---
Now if someone misses a skill check? Fine. Two or three though? I move on to generator because they might be sandbagging you...
---
How to solo survivor: do gens, don't go for unhook unless you see someone else getting chased (either seeing the chase, someone gets injured, or obsession tendrils are wiggling). Not that hard.
---
Let's assume they go with the same model as Fortnite.  That:
---
1. Forces me to buy cosmetics I don't want in a bundle rather than just getting the ones I *do* want cheaper one at a time.
---
2. Forces me to play the game more than I am comfortable with to get the items I have already purchased.
---
3. Pressures me into making decisions I may not be comfortable with yet sooner rather than later due to a mixture of artificial scarcity and artificial time gating.
---
So let's say the next Hallowed Blight I really want for my favorite killer is 200 tiers deep into the fall paid Battle Pass...... That just sucks for no good reason (from a consumer friendly point of view; of course from a greedy monetization point of view it makes sense).
---
Battle passes are just a time-gated monetization tactic to pressure people into paying and playing more than they would otherwise when that perfectly good content could have just gone straight into the cash shop.  This is okay in Free to Play games, but it's not okay in a paid game with 4 paid dlc packs (usually more) per year.
---
Cool !
---
Interesting, i wonder why
---
That's very well done. I like it a lot.
---
Okay but for real isn't it hilarious how they're suppose to be "mature adults" and they're such awkward nerds in the best possible way. Watching them is just great cause they're so human and they appreciate the memes. For all the hate they get, their nice and dedicated people. This is fucking priceless though XD.
---
The plague feels like a mix of Doctor, Amanda &amp; Legion to me.
---
Yikes deed
---
And also you know... the ole' rule set no.2 base kit &amp; make rule sure no.2 stop searching until the trap is active... or, like... doing something with the 2/3 of her addons which are just useless
---
Wdym
---
No I'm not, I want you to tell me how killer is so much harder than survivor. Survivor get nerfs constantly. You never see killer nerfs nowadays
---
Because you're supposed to be 1/4th of the killer's total power. For it to be balanced, in theory, the killer needs to be 3/4ths better than 1 survivor. And he needs to be as strong as 4 survivors combined. However it's very very hard to gauge that when you have a near infinite different styles of play with a map system that is also near infinite.

...I think you are very mistaken. All of the people I know including myself are veteran players. Some of us even lost our shit in that bug from a while back? Some of those got banned and had to buy it again... coz of a bug in their game that’s at the time they refused to compensate for. So they had to re buy it. We’ve spent over $100 on the game each. We’ve put so many hours into the game. We don’t want to waste anymore on a game that we don’t even enjoy half the time because it’s so broken but continue to support it because we want it to become amazing because the premise of this game is just brilliant. This is not the way.
---
It's not about wanting or needing everything; it's about how many avenues they are monetizing the game. Base Game, DLC, Cosmetics and now Battle Pass. That is 4 streams of revenue for the game. The game is more and more becoming a gigantic cash shop now. It's not healthy for ANY paid game to do this. Free 2 Play? Sure; of course the game is free it needs avenues but this game? No, not at all. It's unacceptable. 
---
When you buy this game now you're barely getting half of the content (if that). At this point what does just spending $20 for this game even get you? This isn't about "Reee Cosmetics" or "Reee Battle Pass"; I'm cool with them, I buy cosmetics and battle passes in several games. It's just how many different ways they are trying to get us to spend money and how they have designed the grind to earn these things to be so painful that we just purchase items that can be earned for free as it is. It's actually scary that microtransactions in games are now being praised like they are in this case. 
---
You could argue "Yeah but all the unlicensed killers and so many outfits can be acquired with shards anyways" and this is 100% true however the absolute grind for any new player to even attempt getting these things is borderline unreasonable. Want a killer? 9000 shards. That's quite literally going to be close to 40+ hours of gameplay there alone for ONE character. You're looking at around 400-500 hours of grinding shards alone just to get the unlicensed roster of survivors &amp; killers/perks in game. That is absolutely a F2P level of grind. Hell, so many cosmetics are 21600 shards as well; that's a full devotions worth of grinding there. That's mental.
---
I know this is getting off the discussion about the battle pass alone but I'm just overly frustrated with how little players are getting now for buying this game. No game should have you spend money just for you to launch it and see over half of the characters locked with a big padlock because you need to buy them, a cosmetic shop with big advertisements every time a new cosmetic comes out and now a battle pass front and center too. It's entirely too much.
---
What are you talking about? I never said it did? Also the point like I said, is that it would mean more money for them. Instead of paying say $25 for around 4 cosmetics in a pass, they could set the price anyway they sent for individual outfits. I would be fine paying say $12 for an outfit if it means I don't have to grind for it.
---
Because it’s not.
---
&gt;but do tell me, if you'd see this post would it even matter to you? (cont.)
---
Honestly probably not, had I still been in the state I was four years ago I would've probably impulse bought the pass and all of its tiers regardless of what was in it. Maybe some people would find it useful or just happy that other people share their issues with the system but if that isn't the case I still feel good getting my thoughts out there, kind of like less aggressive venting lol.
---
I want to thank you for being patient with me even though we don't see the pass in the same way, I can definitely get a bit carried away when it comes to negativity and I'm very thankful that you took the time to listen and discuss this
---
Seems like discordance will be strong on him if he can teleport to gens. Seems like he is going to be fun to play.
---
It's a 5 man co-op game. Killer and Survivors gotta stick together and farm each other from time to time.
---
Now I want prom outfits for everyone
---
Every survivor nerf is to balance the game even if some of them are a little harsh and what do you mean how killer is harder? it's a 4 on 1...survivors have toolboxes,loops,flashlights,keys the only thing that i don't think killers should have is an ebony memento mori...ivory should be enough...Seriously if u honestly think survivors are weak then you don't understand the game very well.
---
I don't think I understand, what are you refering to?
---
The main reason I'm unhappy with the decision is that it lowers the bar for what is going to be one of their 4 "main" chapters per year now.  I don't see a way this doesn't come back to bite consumers in the butt later.
---
What would be faked about this? All I see is a killer with low awareness.
---
There were almost no racial slurs from what i saw but sure
---
I can accept this.
---
you were polite in your post, you politely replied to me and to other person in the thread and i see you're not some silly attention seeking person, i wouldn't blast at you like i usually do here :D i only blast at idiots or when i misunderstood something like an idiot
---
and yeah, whatever the actual help, it's nice to know someone has same issues as you do and found a way to deal with them. some maybe even try this out. and that's wholesome:3 if someone tell you your post is stupid - they're stupid.
---
You do realise exclusivity of items is a huge draw in games? They're never going to put battle pass items into the normal cosmetics store and it's just wishful thinking to think they would lol
---
Legion, Huntress, Plague
---
Even with additional blood points it still wouldn't be pay 2 win.
---
That'd be like calling League of Legends pay 2 win.
---
You can reach rank 1 as killer or survivor with using a single perk, add on, or offering. You can also do it without purchasing a single killer or cosmetic. The free killers, hell even the original four killers is good enough to reach rank 1.
---
Dbd cannot be any further from pay2win as of right now.
---
Daddy 😫😖
---
We will see ;)
---
And that accent. Grade A man right there.
---
I suppose I’m one of the odd ones here, as I’m excited for what’s to come. Sure, there’s a lot of things they need to fix, which some are plans in the roadmap. 
---
New chapters, or in this case, just having Ghostface is still going to be good fun. It keeps the game refreshed so we don’t get burnt out. 
---
Freddy rework is in the mid-patch after this too so we’re getting a lot so far within the beginning of this roadmap.
---
Devs can’t please everybody, sadly. Though that’s how it is with any other game haha
---
Furtive Chase seems like it will be very beneficial to Someone like  Legion as it will allow you to get much closer to somebody with killer instinct before they notice and start running
---
I obviously understand the game more than you. Killers have fucking powers, now while some are bad like Freddie's they win chases for the killer. Killers have way better perks. Killers also are alot faster than survivors with the exception for nurse, you get something called bloodlust where if the survivor is actually outplaying the killer you just get a speed boost and this can stack up to 3 times. They are nerfing every good/decent survivor perk. Some do need a nerf lik MoM but not DH or SB or SC they dont need nerfs they are good in the state they are now. Even with the rework for DS it's still an ok perk. AND NOW the devs are reworking looping and most likely are gonna nerf it. Killer perks never get nerfed what so ever
---
Maybe some, but the real point in making the system to hook people that much more into playing the game. Now there is this constant prize dangling in front of you as an incentive to keep playing. That'll bring more numbers in.
---
More numbers = more money = improved game.
---
**Angry Waa Noises.**
---
*cries in lonely wealthy man*
---
Seriously tho this is so sad. I want to give Bruce a hug.
---
You can’t do so on console, sadly. Atleast I’m sure it’s not possible to actually do that. I WOULD love to have different color perks 🙁
---
I get your point. But Dbd and siege are on their 4th year of content. Both are adding new and reused assets makes sense. Keeping the game feel without breaking it with something new. The fact both games are still getting supported so much after all this time is amazing. I wish siege devs would focus on game health like dbd seems like they are going to in year 4. I know it’s just talk now for dbd but a plan is in place. but operation health 2 would be nice or siege.
---
Ikr. ^^^^this.
---
Back when dedicated servers were officially announced about 3 months ago, I made a post asking the community just why they were praising BHVR for it and pointed-out that they were just encouraging further unacceptable procrastinating.
---
*aaaanddd...* I got strawmanned and analy downvoted... 
---
The Stockholm Syndrome is strong.
---
They can always just put the clothes in the store at the same time the pass is available. Once it expires, the outfits could be locked which would keep the exclusivity. I don't see why they would turn away people willing to spend more money.
---
So? Even with that this Freddy is now strictly better. Before all he could do was walk up to people and hit them with a delay. Now he can hit them without a delay and teleport to generators. The two traps are just benefits on top of that.
---
The current survivor meta is self-care, balanced landing, mettle of man (new Ash perk) and adrenaline.
---
Be warned with mettle as it is going to get nerfed in the future
---
Mettle of Man. It’s about to be nerfed into the ground though and it’s very justified. 
---
Decisive Strike was also completely changed
---
Here I am waiting for 30+ minutes for a killer lobby but when I switch to a survivor I get a game almost immediately.
---
They just 360 into you, try standing still and revving in place to make your next move
---
The only thing i have a problem with is how expensive the cosmetic micro transactions are. 10 bucks is just too much for a single skin, for me - a broke ass math student. If they would halve all the prices, I would propably use money on them.
---
I understand they need to make money to support the game and I am 100% fine with micro transactions and a battle pass but they could definitely re-evaluate the prices.
---
I view these "avenues" you brought up as more of bringing every demographic of player under a different type of money making "umbrella" of sorts (sorry I literally can't think of the right word I want to use).
---
There's your standard casual killer and survivor mains. So you've got your basic player base for base game, DLCs, and character specific cosmetics that stand in the shop now.
---
But then their are also people who play ONLY survivor and ONLY killer, Those are the targeted crowds for the stand alone character purchases from the shop, cosmetics battle pass and grinding.
---
These are the players that either want to grind for everything or want to shortcut buy everything.
---
It seems, to me, that instead of trying to fish every penny out of everyone they can, BHVR is trying to open up possibilities of revenue from multiple facets of the player base. An I'm a big fan of having more options for everyone.
---
Replace self care 👎 there are better perks
---
nah i drew it :D
---
Bubba and Hag I think have the best base perks
---
More smaller loops, less long semi-infinite loops, more pallets.
---
No u
---
Yamaoka Estate is suicide material for killers no matter what survivors are playing on it. My pink haired Nea is a stealthmaster there lmao.
---
I would say it’s a good idea if we didn’t already have it for Shards which let you earn BP
---
jesus christ op did you make this god-tier shitpost
---
True, I keep forgetting about the heal speed changes because I don't use it myself
---
^(ENGLISH ONLY PLEASE!)
---
like 40 seconds against lvl 3 sloppy, really awful.  Can be up to a minute vs certain add ons
---
Nah they are both just toxic in general, i’m not talking specifically about this one incident. Because they both have a massive rep in toxicity and shouldn’t be whisperers period
---
I might be in the minority opinion here but as a killer main i fucking love going up against p3 Claudette. Why? Because every single one always acts like they have some kind of invisibility cloak and trys to pull the shittiest maneuvers, Run around corner crouch and try to sneak past, run past tree crouch and wait etc... It's so funny that they think it actually works.
---
I did a meg one too, someone wanted more and i thought id do another one
---
Current Freddy is simple. New Freddy is a lot more complicated.
---
The blink distance from a full charge can be shortened by looking towards the ground if there is no terrain beneath you to pass into, but this does not shorten the blink travel time, it just stretches the full duration into a shorter travel distance.
---
It's somewhat difficult to get used to, but can work well against survivors that like to run back towards you as you blink.
---
What does the window by the basement affect? Helps survivors ?
---
Freddy got massively buffed and I am here for it
---
Sounds like something people would exploit, yeah
---
You have an honest talent for this type of stuff then
---
But scratch marks are already very obvious to notice for non colorblind players
---
Pretty much. Solo survivor is about playing it smart and only saving others when you know it's safe, hoping people will return the favor if you get hooked.
---
Not really, its just a mix of different art styles
---
I know the saying.
---
I’m quoting a song that I thought everyone knew.
---
https://youtu.be/mv9cWgkpIZ4
---
I'm a doc main.
---
But how is that toxic?
---
I am capable now, this post is for those who aren't who weren't worried about this sort of thing until those leaks came out. This wasn't an issue until games started going as a live service and it's causing a lot of problems for the more vulnerable people in the community including people with autism, addiction problems, mental health issues and children.
---
I will admit that it's not as bad as RNG systems but the timed availability is what makes the system predatory in nature.
---
In the description of the Hag’s power blackened catalyst, it states that she has gained this power from using a *finger* from somebody
---
What? Does he know why this was happening :x?
---
What would you argue is the current meta? And why balanced instead of sprint bust btw?
---
Not impossible. I got home from work last night and out of my 5 games I got 3 4ks. Also geez kid calm down, you're that toxic person.
---
Yeah, and it makes it less of a sandbagging perk.
---
And also realize the killer just took the easy way out because he doesn’t have to mind game it at all now
---
I'm gonna stop arguing after this cos it's taking up way too much of my time and you're not understanding. It's not going to happen. Doesn't matter if it could, or if there's no rules to what devs can do with a battle pass. It just won't happen, because it doesn't make sense.
---
If they're putting battle pass cosmetics in the store, there is literally no point in having a battle pass. The whole idea of battle passes is exclusivity. Putting anything in the store removes the exclusivity of it. The fact you're trying to belittle me by saying I "obviously don't grasp" your stupid point just highlights your arrogance and honestly I'm going to laugh at this when it comes out and you're proved wrong lmao.
---
DbD is like a mini horror movie, so it’s just the cast hanging around when not “on set”.
---
Holy shit ikr! Its lawyas camping pigs and annoying as fuck doctors at night, and all of them use NOED.
---
It's fine. People can have their own opinions.
---
I don't hate the devs or anything, I just wish they would focus on fixing the old content. There are so many issues with DbD right now. 
---
For me, their time and resources would be better spent making sure all the old stuff is working properly. I would gladly wait a little extra while for content if it meant the devs were working hard on improving what we already got. Imagine if the devs finally addressed horrible map design, annoying bugs, and the crappy emblem system. Those efforts would go much further in improving the games health.
---
okay lol, there are actually people who claim pallet looping is toxic though, which is really dumb
---
it’s all preference and opinion on your play style, if you’re not “scared” of the killer than balanced landing helps loops, but if you walk around or urban evasion around run sprint burst
---
11, 12, welcome to hell
---
Flair should be salt/rant

I kinda thought they were. They didn’t make me bust a gut laughing but they made me smile. Then the subreddit kinda just became flooded with them and it stopped being funny real quick.
---
It's not matching anything, MacMillan replaces everything's colour with dark blue.
---
Urbana to bym ruchal
---
Doubt they would care if they knew in Dbd
---
Overwatch community is filled with desperation
---
they said the tomes will be there forever, pretty sure the skins that go with the tomes’ rifts will be the same way
---
Tho the major issue i see with him is that his power can be too unpredictable for him.
---
 Half of his ability can only be used on survivors who have fallen asleep which you have no control of since it happens passively. Not only that literally everything wakes you up
---
The thing is, many other players (including myself) are getting tired of the devs adding new content when the old content is in desperate need of fixing. That implies to me the devs are either inept, or they simply don't care about the current issues. Hard to say. Maybe if the devs did a better job at heeding our feedback, the game might be in a better state. 
---
As of now, we have horrible map design. This is probably the main reason the game has balance issues. 
---
Let's see, oh, sounds are broken again. You may not play killer, but it's annoying as hell not being able to hear survivors during a chase. Which means Spirit is not worth playing. 
---
There are still plenty of bugs that haven't been resolved yet. The loading screen bug is still there because I constantly get teammates as survivor who crash during the loading screen. That wastes so much time having to find new games.
---
Disconnecting has become an epidemic. I won't go too much into this. Most people are aware. 
---
The current emblem system sucks imo. It still doesn't properly reward match performance. 
---
I probably go on and on, but hopefully you get the picture.
---
Yeah, because it's a fact. Why wouldn't I repeat it?
---
If you're done now then so am I.
---
They even talked about rank rewards
---
I dont even have a 6 year account that outrageous.
---
I don't have discordance yet, so currently running bbq, nurses, ruin, and haunted. still is an absolute monster.
---
I was there for half an hour, but when people found out that ochido and no0b3 names were banned, the trolls started spamming it leading to mass deletion of comments.
---
Then there were the haters.. Messages like
---
Fuck you BHVR, Fuck your game, FUCK BATTLE PASS REEeeeee
---
Then what I found disrespectful was the fat shaming comments, like the leading manager not queen, people were calling her names, other devs who game people were commenting on their bodies and such.
---
And then the trolling to the mods, of course the mods wanted the chat to be in English so they can properly moderate it but people started spamming in different languages and when the French devs came in and started talking, trolls just started writing
---
"eNgLiSh pLeAsE"
---
Overall just a bunch of edgy 14 year Olds with a lot of free time just being proper cunts
---
Trapper rank, Spirit rank, etc and rank rewards
---
I like it. Smaller loops = more mindgame potential = more skilled play
---
I'd honestly prefer it that way. Why spend money on a battle pass for things already in the game that anyone can get? 
---
Having exclusives, yes would have more people buy it and yes it would be timed exclusives but they are exclusive and it would give people a reason to grind it out compared to that one nea shirt you can buy on your own with shards or some meg pants. 
---
Content available for everyone outside of battle pass, for me personally, makes me not want to buy a battle pass. Why? It's nothing special. 
---
Why do people buy fortnite battle passes? They offer season exclusives. People want the outfits. 
---
Let me get an exclusive reward for paying extra for something compared to "welp I can get it faster than you through this BP" 
---
I see less people buying a battle pass for content in a game that you can get at anytime.
---
Yeah, they’re really turning the game around. I think I’m most excited for the expansion of the lore, I’m a bit of a reader and I love the story of DBD.
---
Wow i want these cosmetics now
---
I'm gonna keep dcing now just to spite you :)
---
I watched it with Puppers, pretty chill
---
For some it is but I think it’s really good for stealth killers due too all the grass and rocks everywhere, same for hag and trapper it helps a lot. But for other killers it can harm them a lot.
---
I do read them, Officer
---
I’m not sure you realize but the game is rated [17+, meaning around half of high schoolers can still legally play lol.](https://www.esrb.org/ratings/Synopsis.aspx?Certificate=34926&amp;Title=Dead+by+Daylight)
---
Fixed
---
Have to see it honestly
---
Lampkin lane...
---
I can agree with you there, but for newer killer players... They might just bloodlust. Dunno tho
---
I hate you
---
Probably just making a really open map to be different to the others
---
so dope 😲
---
Don't play the fucking game God dammnit, devs are listening if you are so fed up unintall it and don't come back
---
Yeah that sounds pretty toxic. Glad I watched the live stream after then
---
Except they only work on sleeping targets which he has no control of.
---
So to cut this short and end this little argument...those really great loops will be nerfed and those really bad loops will be buffed from what i've seen on reddit (i might be wrong) and no..you do not understand the game better than me because if you would you would not complain about killers being op when they are not...except nurse i can agree on that..sure there are great killers but you are putting it like survivors can't do shit and that's just not true so i will say what ppl said to me when i first started the game and thought killers are broken...Fucking get good and learn how to keep the killer occupied while the others repair if you are found...And with this i am gone goodbye.
---
Here's my two cents about shit like Battlepasses, lootboxes and anything of a similar vein.
---
They're not exactly a product of Satan, except for people with no self control, I'm talking people that will drop 500$ for a single legendary skin on CS:GO, or even more than that just to have every cosmetic from an event.
---
The majority of people that complain about lootboxes are, I would say personally, the same people that would rather buy everything than unlock it for free. The fact there's a random element to it angers them because there's no guarantee to get everything regardless of how much you spend. And yet if you were to grab every item from an event and put it behind, say idk, an 800$ paywall, then they would rather splurge 8 hundo for them rather than, say, a couple of bucks, and then earn the rest(or as many as you can) through in-game free lootboxes.
---
Now as for battlepasses, its similar yet different, you get to see everything that you're going to unlock as you progress through the battlepass, right? But, these people have the mentality of "I spent money on this battlepass yet I still have to earn the things in it, what gives? I want my stuff now" Which again, I understand, but its such an entitled point of view, these people, what they're really complaining about, is not that the cosmetics cost money, but that even after spending the money they have to play a certain amount to get what they payed for. (As a bonus note, I don't know if battlepasses expire, i.e. you didn't finish it before the next battlepass so you miss on all those cosmetics that you didn't level up the battlepass for, but if they do, then that's also doubly the reason as to why people don't like them, because it gives you the impression of being forced to play for something you spent money on)
---
They are both predatory, don't get me wrong, but everyone gets angry when shit's behind a paywall, yet most of them would buy it anyway and then complain that they 'had' to buy it when in truth you could just fume about it and not spend a single penny on it. Yeah you could miss that really cool Hanzo skin, but did you reaaaally need it?
---
I quickly switched to YouTube because there the comments were closed and I wanted to have a peace of mind haha.
---
It was an update that buffed the wraith
---
Have you seen Friday the 13th? Friday the 13th still has bugs that have existed since launch and the devs dont even give a fuck about their own game. They hardly did to start with and now they are making another half assed game that'll be a cheat out of your pocket. If you want a bad company try gun media.
---
yeah she gifted me it so everyone would see it in my library
---
It might also make Enduring+Spirit fury even more powerfull
---
Do you know why I pulled you over?
---
Agreed. It's all about the money though unfortunately
---
Seeing the bear trap would probably be the coolest one to me, even tho I dont like trapper.
---
Til most people on this sub walk around with stick firmly lodged into their asshole at all times of the day
---
&gt;Head to the exit gates to find the final survivor.
---
you mean keep going back and forth between exit gates while survivor eventually opens one because its impossible to stop it
---
I dont like the way most people play them either, but I wanted to draw them. Thanks!
---
Susie with the ruler and compass needles attached to it is great, fool.
---
Dunno what you're expecting. You can't win em all. Try a different play style if what you're doing isn't working for you.
---
Literally no one cares what you think, you don't represent the opinion of skilled players
---
I never seen nor use these "infinitely loop's" people speak of. Seriously. Never seen it done. You are might as well day there are unicorns in the game and I'll be like cool. I'll go back to not noticing, doing my own thing and still hate all the things still wrong with this game like camping and tunneling
---
I can't see jack shit through the corn.
---
Poop
---
Bruh kate looks like she got hit in thr face with a pan. David ass look like he got pink eye in both eyes.
---
In the recent stream, they said that the game should soon be able to handle it when someone dc’s. And shouldn’t effect the game as much. No dates, but they’re working on it.
---
Badham is survivor sided??? I've always had great luck on it as a killer cause of how small it is?
---
For me The Game map always ends up being down to the killer choice. Same with Lery's
---
Yeah. I've played and mained him since the day he came out. Been there for all of his ups and downs and made a name for myself in some ways.
---
But I'm more than happy to welcome these new and upcoming changes, and eventually adapt to them. As much as I'm worried about where this could leave him in a state of balance, I'll be open minded about it. Alot of people will say that it's overpowered and some people will try to go to Freddy's defence and say "don't nerf him day one again!".
---
I don't want him to be Overpowered. I don't want him to be underpowered. I just want him to be in a place where he won't be the #1 killer and won't be a complete joke. Most of all, I just want people to be happy and enjoy the new rework of Freddy, whether it be playing as or against him.
---
Inserting?
---
The wonderful wizard of death
---
There's gonna be a contest for a fanart and the winning fanart is gonna be added to the game so you can draw bunny Feng ;)
---
Team Megatron!
---
Racism, sexist comments, etc. go hand in hand with a persons maturity level. Comments telling people to kill themselves are really made by those with lower than average IQ or the maturity level of a high schooler or lower. Why? They don't understand the sheer impact or gravity of that comment, even as a joke it is not ok. And they literally do not understand why, hence why they tend to regurgitate "its just a joke".
---
You make a good point about the rating. That should be increased to 21, or just disable the ability to chat/message other players/talk on twitch until you reach at least 21. You know, so their maturity level hopefully catches somewhat up to their age. It beats having a 17 year old still talking like a high/middle schooler (usual rebuttals like "why you mad?", "you're just bad", "stay salty", "yikes", and the various racists/sexists/homophobic/self harming insults they have to stick to due to not being intelligent enough to do otherwise.
---
Oh yeah!
---
Had moments on Yamaoka where I'd follow scratch marks to some grass and I stood in disbelief how literally invisible a survivor was. It's not just "ah, I see you barely now that I focus my eyes", literally invisible. Had to swing to confirm they were there.
---
Did you watch the Anniversary stream?
---
Anytime I ever tune into his stream it's not even a minute until he's complaining about something. It also really bothers me how he rides this "I'm so analytical and only use FACTS and LOGIC" dick every 10 seconds.
---
Survive with friends
---
Yeah I loved it
---
I wonder if they'll go into detail about what happened to her mom? :c
---
Hope they like stick figures
---
Whats the dickbutt addon?
---
And yet the game is 3 years old lol. Still a buggy mess. 
---
But hey, at least we get Ghost Face soon, who will probably be another lackluster killer. 
---
Listen friend, I'm not trying to paint the devs as evil villains. But I do believe they deserve sharp criticism with how they've handled the game. 
---
These devs have a long history of making bad decisions.
---
If it's anything like Fortnite, there's definitely an advantage considering a single legendary skin in Fortnite is 2,000 V-Bucks ($20) and the Battle Pass is like just over $10, while giving a numerous amount of value within it.  Yeah you're not going to enjoy everything, but a lot of people don't feel comfortable dumping a ton of money into cosmetics alone, so a Battle Pass gives a ton of stuff for a great value.
---
Now the only downside yes is if someone doesn't play enough to earn those rewards, although once again if it's like Fortnite, you don't need to play an obscene amount, it's just taking care of the challenges effectively to earn tiers.  I would hope that BHVR is going the same route, and the pass isn't just XP based.  Although it's the variety of challenges that I'm concerned about as Fortnite obviously allows for WAY more things to be done, rather than DBD stuff that I can think of like:
---
Hit ___ survivors with ____ attack
---
Escape ___ times
---
Heal ____ survivors
---
Escape chases _____ times
---
I feel it's all going to be more challenging stuff while in Fortnite a lot of the challenges can be done pretty damn easily if you just focus on the challenge and that's it, as they're designed for both casual and more experienced players.
---
Still haven't counter argued my point
---
You know there is an actual movie scene with that scene.
---
Who said anything about not dropping the pallet? 
---
Instead of breaking the pallet, since the loop is unsafe you'll just get hit from the killer running from one side to the other and getting movement speed.
---
There is no point in breaking an unsafe pallet, it's much better to leave it up and force people to sit at it so that you can get a free hit.
---
Offering never get added because they break when in game. Don’t look good, so a wasted effort.
---
Never played it. But isn't that game dead? Is that what you want to happen with DbD lol?
---
yes.
---
Just played a match two days ago where I got chased into the corn and I just sort of, stepped to the side, stopped running, and crouched and the killer walked back and forth a few feet away from me a few times before getting frustrated and moving off to chase someone else. It was great.
---
Don't forget: **CUNT**
---
I been saying this forever. I know the changesi want.
---
As of now there isn't an incentive to camp and tunnnel like a no skill having asshole besides "hey don't be a dick"
---
Why not makes the killer get Less or no points if they are camping near a hanged survivor. It would encourage killers to idk...not fucking just stand there and wait... which fucking works. That's the most frustrating part it works. It's easy points. I don't agree with it.
---
when I play killer. Don't need to camp and tunnel   in order to get everybody. It's not right to camp. Too easy, takes no skill and don't feel right imo
---
The disrespect is immeasurable
---
Holy is that trappers face lol
---
Yeah I got corn four times in a row as Legion last night and just completely turned off the game lol
---

---
they are 150000 bp for the desperate.
---
If people were forced to play survivor, and they only wanted to play killer, then they'd suicide on first hook to get the game over fast. Terrible idea.
---
I love the idea but it has to be done right.  And like others mentioned, the bloodlust might need to be looked at/nerfed.
---
Rank 12 killer, yeah it was taking a long time for me yesterday. When I was able to get 4, they were mixed rank. 20's with 8's and 14's, etc
---
ehh this post seems like it’s high on sodium
---
Spirit fury is just an incredible perk in general tbh. Good on Billy, wraith, Amanda, legion, Mike, trapper. It's probably one of the best perks in the game rn
---
Deranking for faster queue times.
---
I hope they buff his perks before release, most of them are completely worthless.
---
I hate coming against these rank 20s. I want people my rank(12)
---
They didn’t say, but I would think not. That would seem a little too powerful.  It’s also one of the issues new players had with Freddy, which was one of the reasons for reworking him.
---
If you don't have a backup survivor to fall back on i would prestige once you have used up all your point offerings and have a good pile of BP's to prestige with and grind out the early levels once you prestige.
---
In addition during a double BP weekend is a good shout.
---
You're a rank 16 killer main, just because you watch rank 1 players dont make you as good or knowledgable as one; enough said.
---
But for good messure: yes I have, several times actually, you just for some reason can't understand me.
---
You can't mind-game a good killer, less so a Nurse, at high rank. If you do, it's purely because of luck. 9 times out of 10 you WILL lose if you try to mind-game someone who is naturally faster, stronger and at around same level than you.
---
You're basically saying "just juke xD!" when I'm talking about people who are experienced and have faced countless of jukers in the past.
---
I know how to juke. I juke all the time. It works, but rarely. It's not a strong or reliable tactic and it isn't justification enough for survivors to be nerfed.
---
_a soft t pose_
---
That was my immediate thought after prestiging, I should’ve a) had a backup, and b) used up all stuff + stacked up bloodpoints to get back up quick
---
Thank you for the comment
---
Freddy’s rework can
---
Forcing a Bloodlust hit is going to cost them time, just like facecamping. It's only something bads and trolls will do.
---
Not native English here. So when does he do this sound?? And the survivors can spot him from 32 or 13 meters??? Cant understand it properly
---
I watched the stream but didn’t understand the meaningful ranks, I might have missed the end of it, but is that just where you get prizes for certain ranks?
---
You're great!
---
At least in Coldwind you can see smth through corns, unlike in Yamaoka, where there's tall grass, big ass rock and trees in every corner
---
When are dedicated servers coming?
---
It's at the end of the road map
---
I can see what you're saying. I have the same worry. Thinking about what I would want from him to fulfill the fantasy of being freddy... I wouldn't have picked fake pallets and slowing traps.
---
The teleporting is fine to me. Makes sense. He pops around in dreams. But I wish they'd done something better with phantasms and horrors rather than fake pallets and slow snares. That being said, both will help his big weakness, which is looping. 
---
But flavor wise? Feels kinda lame.
---
Honestly, unless you care about the bloody clothing or achievements for it, 'never' is the answer.
---
There's no other benefit to prestige other than the achievement(s) and bloody clothing.
---
The difference being that you have approached it with the mentality that you will be buying the battle pass, so of course you want it to have exclusives so you can feel better than people who don't have it. And that's fine. But why are you already prepared to pay for it? 
---
&gt;Why spend money on a battle pass for things already in the game that anyone can get? 
---
I buy every DLC that comes out immediately with money, even though I could save up iridescent shards to buy non-licensed chapters. Other people spend money on auric cells to buy cosmetics, some of which can be purchased with shards instead. People are quite happy to pay to speed up the grind of a game without getting exclusive content.
---
f13 seems nice.
---
Dude his perks are bad save for one good info one. No one fast vaults out of chase, and smaller terror radius in a chase is hardly good except when paired with that perk. Tremors is the only good one because it functions like BBQ and chili by telling you where to go next but that’s it.
---
Rip noob3s account
---
Yup. And they DC on the hook right before it's about to sacrifice or on the first down.
---
Hell no. I mean dbd actually gives a shit about their fanbase and their game unlike gun media who went and said they dont care about their game on social media. I'm simply saying would you rather have devs like that? Didnt think so. I supported both games since their console releases and I'm not afraid to say I'm proud of BHVR and I'll continue supporting them because they actually care about their fans. They have dbd and deathgarden going for them right now.
---
And many more!
---
Honestly the map reworks sound better for the health of the game for the long run, ppl have memorized these maps like the back of there hands over the last 2-3 years.  The only thing that worries me is the fact that the 2 most recent maps they’ve made are 2 of the most hated maps by players (yamaoka and ormond).  They claim they’ve learned a lot more about map making then what they knew 3 years ago, but it’s almost like they’re getting worse.
---
David has No Mither but whatever you say
---
Petition to just put him in the fucking game as an op killer
---
Yes, if you are a killer main, you’d just start a game and suicide asap.
---
If you think plague counters loops then I know why you complain lol
---
Claudette should’ve been tinman because they are heartless
---
And what's wrong with that? Some of us have other things to do like work.
---
I said *Assertive*, not *INsertive*
---
Mom pick me up I’m scared
---
I mean the other benefit is something to do, i have over 1k hours in the game and im working to get all my survivors to P3 Lvl 50 just cause it's something to do.
---
I already have all the survivor teachable so there's not a whole lot for me to do considering i only play killer for daily's usually.
---
No you’re not the only one, first thing that came to my mind as well.  Like not even average perks but F tier.  Only one I could see getting some use is the generator perk tbh.
---
Wait are people actually defending battle passes now? I'm totally losing faith in todays gaming communit.
---
poopy
---
Nancy's Masterpiece.
---
Nope. If you DC you're a shit and dont deserve any points.
---
That’ll happen when you play the same game nonstop for years. I found him back when he played injustice: Gods Among Us, and he was fun to watch then. Learned how to play flash from him.
---
It was from Snapchat
---
[WASSUP!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txt_VqGkD3E)
---
I think you're pretty great yourself.  Let me know what you think about the rework!
---
Exactly I hate that. I play doctor to get blood points and those low ranks never save anyone. I hate most when they DC on first down. I don’t get my BBQ stack.
---
please don't make me pay more for a game that already costs like a full game with all the dlc
---
free2play brings in a plague of problems such as hacking and bots.  not that those dont exist now but they will become a much bigger problem if it was free.
---
[True, true](https://youtu.be/A3oL7v7PLac?t=50)
---
How will I'm All Ears work with Q&amp;Q? It doesn't make the notification but his perk doesn't specify a notification does it?
---
Because there are 4 survivors.  If it takes even 1 minute to chase and down the first survivor, the game is already over.  3 gens being done by the first book is unacceptable for a decent killer player.  They have to have some tools to get downs in 15-30 seconds to even have a chance.  Remember a killer needs 8-9 hooks to “win”.  The game is based around the inevitability that the killer will always win a 1v1 against a survivor if they are decent.  The only downside to this is the possibility of tunneling, if a killer wants a certain survivor dead, they have the tools to make that happen, and it is quite frustrating.
---
I absolutely agree, this kind of marketing technique is preying on a good amount of people who will be feeling pressured to spend money on the pass. It's mot a question of wether it's their fault for their decision or not, it's about exploiting your playerbase, specially younger players who can't necessarily make sense of how vicious passes can be.
---
You people are obnoxious with the attempted cringe uploads. They were having fun. Big deal. The only cringey thing is people making fun of them for having a good time.
---
i'm new at the game, what does SFW means?
---
I would also love to see the trap! This bell is amazing!
---
To be fair, new killers are a lot more impactful than new survivors. Perks aside survivors are ultimately just skins, whereas killers have their own powers and playstyle and change the game entirely. Even if you're a survivor main, a new killer being added means you have to learn what they can do, what their addons are, and how to counter them, whereas if you're a killer main, a new survivor just means a slightly different looking target and maybe another meta perk or two to watch out for.
---
Not to mention we have more survivors than killers anyway
---
i'm new at the game, what does SWF means?
---
..... Why?
---
During double bloodpoint events is the best time, you can recover the character quickly.
---
Sounds like you need to either play more or don’t prestige.  Prestige is not mandatory, it’s an optional feature for high hour players to have something to progress.  Ppl shit on the grind, but honestly if I had all perks on all my characters maxed out, I wouldn’t play this game nearly as much, if any.
---
Honestly I used to really like the map but playing on it a lot I've started to identify a lot of the issues with it. It is honestly a Haddonfield Lite, with a lot of the same problems that Haddonfield has (overly safe window loops, overly safe pallets, really obnoxious impassable pallets.)
---
TBH the main issue I have with the map is the generator placement. Three or four generators can spawn very close to the preschool which means that a Hag, Nurse, Spirit or someone similar can easily set up a 3 gen strat on that map. To this day I still remember the 20 minute 3-gen game against a Doctor with Overcharge on Badham.
---
Bloodlust takes forever anyway.
---
Nope, icon packs aren't bannable. r/perkbydaylight might have something you like :)
---
How dare you
---
Sounds spot on.  Another noobstomper.  Not that there’s anything wrong with that, I mean I love ghostface and will still play him.  Fun is fun, don’t need a sweaty 4K every game to enjoy it.
---
More lore sounds cool
---
I once bitched about the second thing. I then got a lot of stupid memes and people saying "its meant to show you the struggle of fighting the entity" which is dumb af in my opinion.
---
I agree with you, I just believe that they would get more profit from the battle pass by also offering exclusives in it as well. 
---
Of course people will buy for quicker things for the convince but I believe even more would buy for exclusive things and that a majority would also think there's no point in getting it if it comes with nothing. The entire battle pass doesn't have to offer only exclusive things either, it can be a higher tier reward with the things already available in the game a mid tier /low tier reward depending on the item. 
---
Does it make people feel as if they have to grind out just to get something? Sure but its also a reward for doing so or for playing often ( not sure if they'll be challenges you have to complete to progress or if its strictly off playtime/pips). 
---
I also probably wont buy the battle pass, tbh, not unless it came with an exclusive I actually wanted in it (I stick to one character anyways). Im not a big battle pass buyer.
---
Holy hell, that's such a fun idea!  I like being able to watch survivors after escaping/dying because it's like a mini-horror movie and you're yelling at them to go left when they go right
---
THANKS!!!
---
1. Yes please. Its like releasing the button causes a skill check, every....damn....time.
---
2. Meh. If you want a map then use an offering. 
---
3. Yes please. This is super annoying.
---
4. Yes. Unhook then try and wiggle around trying to find the healing angle.
---
5. Before adding more instadowns we need another instadown protection perk like Mettle. 
---
6. Frustrating, but hopefully dedicated servers work out. 
---
7. THIS. A dc should be heavily punished. Lose all items, lose 5 pips or be auto deranked 1 level, or have a corruption counter placed on that survivor. Corruption counters prevent the accumulation of blood points for either a period of time or for a certain amount. A DC causes the entity to corrupt your next 10,000 bloodpoints.
---
8. Neutral on this one. I don't play them as killers and don't have too much problem with playing against them.
---
9. I'd more like to see it as a one shot/two shot/three shot deal. Each swing when active reduced the counter (1 counter for each rank) Get rid of the active totem. 
---
I'm going to add another one:
---
10. End Game Collapse. When the game gets down to 2v1 and the killer gets one of them down, the game is essentially over. Killers just soft camp the hooked surv then can freely wander around the map and close the hatch. 1v1 the surv is never going to get the gate open.  Reduce the gate open time the further into egc it gets or add a perk like "Final Panic" that increases gate open time to like 25 seconds with 4 living survivors, 20 with 3, 15 with 3, and 10 with 1.   
---
Instead of this constant cat and mouse game of nerfing this and buffing that, create more diverse perks to deal with those things. Want to end loops? Then take perks that increase your vault and movement speed. Want to prevent NOED? Then take an anti instadown perk.  Break the Ruin/BBQ/NOED trifecta for more diverse perks, same with the Sprint Burst/Dead Hard/Balanced/Adren template for survivors.
---
That’s what I think they shouldn’t change about MoM. If you heal then your aura is revealed, if you don’t then you’ve basically given yourself the exposed effect.
---
It bothers me because it's a form of double dipping on people who have paid for the game and the DLCs
---
The amount of hate this subreddit shows this man is absurd. Yes, he passionate and competitive,  but he also gets matched up against very good players. Rng that he gets is awful at times too, but he still continues on. He plays well, but he gets frustrated at times...but honestly, who doesn't? This game can do that at times.  But he is honorable,  never been banned and plays straight up. Everybody's favorite content creators in this game have for the most part been banned a few times. I, for one, enjoy tru3 and this community's despicable character assassination on this guy is unwarranted and juvenile at the least.
---
Nice to see they're listening to players unlike what seems to be most game companies
---
Okay.
---
What about people that paid 70 when it first launched?
---
im thinking your aura will be revealed but without the sound notification he wont know where to look or to look at at all, depending on if the perk reads like Alert and you are notified that an aura is revealed.
---
Prestige once you have gotten the teachables that you want from other characters, if you prestige and don’t have anybody else’s teachables then you’re wasting bloodpoints.
---
Upvote for Quentin
---
Yeh that's what I was thinking too, like with Object of Obsession where if you're just lucky enough to see it on your screen you get to see it.
---
Outstanding
---
Absolutely amazing!
---
Amazing but fake news, Claudette doesn't blend into the background.
---
That's fucking sick!
---
Oooof
---
Its so funny, i think 90% of people running it dont get that it does this
---
Oh absolutely more people would buy it if it had exclusives. But that's the point of my original comment. People feel pressured to buy so that they don't miss out. They're not necessarily buying because they want the cosmetic, they're buying because they don't want to lose the option to have the cosmetic. IRL limited edition products often become coveted collector's items and so maintain/increase in value, so this business tactic is more acceptable with physical products. Digital limited edition products have no resale value. It's just pressuring players to pay so they don't lose the opportunity to own a cosmetic.
---
What do you mean by toxic?
---
Only 5% dc ? I see you're an optimistic one.
---
That's just his flashlight
---
The problem with the community is that every strategy that wins the game is considered toxic by someone, so there is no way to not be toxic. Why would a play avoid the meta just because it considered toxic. Killers who camp for kills are face campers, survivors who run the killer around so their team can do gens are pallet loopers, survivors who do the gens in groups are gen rushers, killers who try to down every survivor quickly without hooking are slugging, killers who chase and kill one survivor at a time are tunneling... this community just puts negative names on every strategy in the game just to make players look toxic when they are just trying to play and enjoy the game in their own way.
---
True. We know that there're "changes" and what they are - we don't know the precise numbers, and in DbD numbers can really fuck a mechanic over.
---
Youre the one getting pedantic about a term you don't even understand the history of
---
He literally says GG every game???
---
Source?
---
My understanding is...Scream got the license to use fun worlds mask for their movie.  Scream created the robe.  Scream owns anything relating to the movie (voice/robe/etc.). Scream licensed their robe and likeness to fun world to sell authentic ‘scream’ costumes for Halloween around the popularity from the movie.  It’s like a partnership but still 2 separate entities.  Any scream merchandise with a ghostface mask that was not previously negotiated on when they first made the partnership would have to go through both parties.
---
I got all Meg’s teachables then prestiged, in my eyes there’s no point relevelling her until the end since I already have her teachables. Currently levelling up another survivor instead and will keep him level 50 until I have a good amount of blood points
---
Definitely fake.  Who the fuck runs **Up the Ante** now that **Deliverance** exists?  All lies.  Obvious photoshop.  Lame.
---
I know
---
Ah THIS. Honestly being camped doesn't annoy me as much as my whole team crouching behind something waiting to make a save. That or actually getting farmed by them and awarding the camper with more points.
---
So you know you're lagging because of work downloads but you decide to play anyway and scoff at the people who accuse you of lag switching? Interesting...
---
Is that one of the things they're changing?
---
jUSt clEanSe tHE DuLl toTeMs
---
Blood comes out of the generator when Freddy channels it
---
Besides the hundreds of cosmetics you're gonna get both for free and with the paid passes in the future.
---
When was the last time there was double bloodpoints? I presume there will be when season 4 releases?
---
On that topic, what does **actually** happen when season changes? Is it just survivor and killer rank being reset back to 20?
---
&gt; Chat did this for anyone that didn't speak English to chat/taunt the mods. 
---
oh well jeez in that case ITS STILL RACIST AS SHIT.
---
Survivors who intentionally trash talks in chat like making fun of the player and/or racism. The second reason is DC after getting down once, or if decisive strike doesn't work. For killers, it's all pretty much reason #1.
---
Blood will gush out the gen and he will appear next to it
---
There are definitely way more killer mains than survivors. Just take a look at queue times on both sides.
---
Really dig the blood splatter effect. Awesome artwork!
---
Just as a disclaimer, they can be banable as it's modifying the game files, but no one has been as far as I'm aware.
---
Yeham I thought you were just some kid saying ‘dEVs pLEAze @dd mY chARAct3r gHOStf@c3 i want 85% 0f all m0NEy thx’
---
Originally there was no counterplay to it. But with changes to lockers to sole Survivor along with the introduction of Distortion it's pretty balanced now
---
No sir
---
They could always just not play that killer lobby 🤔
---
I love the rework. All the goriness to it is very in line with original Freddy from the movies. Amazing
---
You actually lose points for camping these days. You got a pretty limited amount of time before you have to leave the area of the hook unless a survivor stupidly just runs up on it.
---
You're not wrong lol just seems like a butthead thing to do
---
Why the repost?
---
I'm just talking about those who make the 2b2t Minecraft chat server wholesome and DCing after getting down once or if decisive strike doesn't work. That and those who watch their fellow survivor die on the hook t-bagging while the killer is miles away hooking someone else
---
They said he was modeled after someone else in the office
---
His Patrick Star feet are the best
---
Thank you 😊
---
If Carl isn't going to be a survivor I'm disappointed. I feel as though my demographic isn't being represented as a chubby white bearded guy. Please let Carl's twin brother get taken by the entity
---
As long as the battlepass objectives don't hurt gameplay then i can support it.
---
Thanks you so much!
---
I’m glad you enjoy it! Thank you 😊
---
Someone contacted EAC. They said they don't check those files, ask the Developer. BHVR had already said go ask EAC. If neither if them care, that folder isn't going to start getting checked randomly.
---
Reminds me of my old Ghostface Mask. If you squeeze this rubber heart, blood pours over the mask from the top. Your art is dope.
---
For some reason my original post was deleted. It wasn’t a mod, it just poof, disappeared. So that’s why I reposted!
---
Seems like it might make a cool lamp as a decoration
---
&gt;/r/deadbydaylight is not a platform to shame other players. **Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light**, and no calls to action against another player.
---
Yikes that they DC. Your build is disgusting but wow those survivors are just dumbasses for DCing
---
Pssst: not really supposed to show their names buddy. This post is probably gonna get taken down. Also this is pretty mild compared to what I’ve seen, not even worth posting here honestly.
---
I played Scratched Mirror Myers on the hospital and was accused of ‘porting’ and ‘bugusing’. He said he reported me to Sony, and that I’d expect a ban. I didn’t.
---
Hackers are very rare occurence so that isn't really a real reason to prefer console over pc.
---
With the way it is, skill wise, the best survivor will ALWAYS beat the best killer other than nurse. Skill caps for killers are just too low. That's the outcome of non-vesatile killers, every versatile killer they nerfed to Oblivion because survivors cried. So now they have to alter the game mechanics because killers are crying now. Legion is the most recent victim of my example. His power could be used to close distance, get through loops, and find gens being worked on (with the fuming mixtape). He could injure a lot but not kill right away with his power. He was versatile, survivors don't like how their one build can't counter a killer that counters a little bit of everything.
---
Which I don't really see that as a bad thing. Yes, some people will miss out but it happens. I understand the buying because they need it (how many people bought season passes for fortnite after season 1 because they missed out on "john wick"?) but at the same time business can't stop themselves from doing something that can generate more revenue or maybe even generate more people to come back because a few are pressured to buy something because of their need to have everything.
---
I've voiced my reasoning before that a battle pass is a dark path to follow, as they will put more desirable cosmetics behind grindy paywalls (instead of just regular paywalls) and may eventually attach tangible rewards to the Battle Pass.
---
I'm happy that they *said* it's not going to be pay-to-win but what they *say* and what they **do** are two very different things. I may be labeled a pessimist but it's only a matter of time before Shirtless Myers or Swimsuit Kate is tied to level 100 of the paid battle pass, or you start getting Shards, Bloodpoints, and even Auric Cells for the paid battle pass.
---
I was like “If someone doesn’t get out of it then i’ll kermit”
---
The imgur is fan art tho iirc
---
Season pass time
---
Forgot about the names. Deleting.
---
I don't play very much DBD anymore, but I would totally sit back with some chips and queso and watch some people die.
---
Oh really? Awesome! Guess I'll be getting my own icon packs now haha
---
I don't really get this subs hate of tru3. I've watched a lot of DbD streamers and streamers in general. Any streamer with a decent following has some arrogance or 'I'm always right mentality'. But I don't think tru3 even is arrogant. I've been watching him for months now. He is very knowledgeable about the game and when I watch, he always gives credit when it's due, he plays at a high level, he doesnt ever get toxic, he plays every killer and plays survivor, and he gives good game advice. So many other DbD streamers are arrogant and can't admit when they got beat, they are toxic, they talk shit, or they are either super killer or survivor favored. Tru3 by comparison really doesn't seem as bad to me if bad at all. But alright.. Let's hive mind against a streamer.
---
Would love to see this as a cosmetics set! Especially with either Nurse, Spirit, or Hag dolled up as the Wicked Witch of the west!
---
You have all of the DBD sub reddit behind you brother
---
Absolutely!
---
They've managed to keep a game this cool going for 3 years! That's better than any of the critics have done.
---
Since I mostly play Trapper and Pig, Yamaoka Estate is honestly one of my favorite maps as Killer. Plenty of stuff for Pig to sneak around and the tall grass everywhere makes Trapper a joy to play on that map.
---
They should rather nerf tunneling by removing 1. Bloodlust or 2. Make survivor for 2 seconds invincible after unhooked instead of that 0.5 sec or so.
---
And how was ds in even the slightest way a buff to survivors? Its gone from absolute most OP perk to mid tier.
---
And mom is OP. Not so much after a couple weeks tho and its been only a month since ash exists in dbd.
---
And maybe the same with enduring+Spirit fury

True but you can't base this off Mcote just just saying stuff on stream. He sometimes just says things. Something is a bug, Now the same Something is not a bug and intended, We'll never do clowns, Now here's a clown, We'll never do religion, Now here's a Priestess. Unfortunately we just can't take what they say as fact.
---
If you attempt to make a hide-n-seek game out of DbD, you will get a very boring game, because it has already taken the path of a chase game. Look at Friday the 13th. In it you feel the urge to hide when Jason is close, not loop him
---
idk why people hate him
---
No but you're out your damn gourd if you think there shouldnt be a reward for getting higher ranks because... reasons I guess? Lol. Ranks are supposed to pit you against higher level players, why that means there cant be any reward for getting there makes literally not an ounce of sense
---
Wish I could draw as good as that lol.
---
Fuck yeah behavior 🎉
---
He still has generator teleportation, which can most likely be augmented by add-ons
---
You forgot the “hello” voice clip
---
It's extremely rare for me to get accused of that.
---
Well soon I will be down downloading and then will hopefully not cause issues
---
is the horror film about legion or u just using the mask?
---
That's the one.  It's basically a formula at this point, drives me insane.
---
Ds went to mid tier, lol, it not even usable anymore. At rank one most killers are good enough they don’t need to tunnel
---
Yeah, but not for the right reason. My dad saw a mask covered in blood on the floor and freaked out because he thought that the blood (behind a VERY see-through plastic barrier) was spilling on his carpet.
---
Oh you must be that meg
---
They're going live the chapter after Ghostface according to the roadmap
---
Well you don’t know unless you try!
---
This answer has been used for over 2 years now because it’s a valid answer, because mid chapter patches fix tons of bugs, haven’t you seen? “Also 2 years to wait isn’t acceptable” you never even mentioned any specific bugs in there so you can’t just say 2 years is unacceptable, unless you mean in 2 years they should’ve fixed every single bug in the game ever.
---
I would say prestige as soon as you can. But if you aren't a completionist like me, then you don't have to.
---
Literally.
---
What do u m an
---
OH I’m a mong
---
The secret is practice and a lot of wasted paper ahah
---
I understand how to play the different killlers. That is exactly why I thought this was satire, as you called Freddy god tier. Maybe at lower levels, but at red ranks Freddy is shit. I enjoy playing as him but it is painfully obvious how bad he is.
---
i like it, spirit fury might become a problem but well see and so can be said with bloodlust at the lower skill groups.
---
Why? To track progress of the daily?
---
Why are you disappointed in the community praising dedicated servers? It’s what we wanted and they’re finally getting it
---
Don’t know why this was down voted...they don’t have a actual release date yet. Just sometime this summer. They did testing of the servers on the PTB awhile back. And they said if things go well it would push the servers live faster. So the test did well so I’m guessing maybe around chapter 13 release. After Freddy rework? Don’t quote me. Just guessing based on how the push things out.
---
You move you surpass 15, you can never go bellow that again, 20-15 if for new players only.
---
Ahahahahah
---
A Claudette is literally invisible in a dark place in MacMillan
---
Oh trust me I want all survivors max lol
---
Would it not make most sense to keep them level 50, use all offerings and all tools, stack up bloodpoints, and then prestige and that’ll help power through the first 30+ levels?
---
Someone else has also said to get others teachables and then prestige, so possibly getting everyone to rank 50 and then prestiging slowly like that?
---
Oh so itll notify survivors that hes going to the gen. Such an odd arrangement of powers. I'm interested to see how it's all used together.
---
Right? I was gonna include that but I didn’t want the title to be too long
---
So I go back to 15?
---
Yeah my friend made the same mistake of prestiging his David without having anybody else leveled up so he just wasted like 1,300,000 bloodpoints.
---
Surveillance+whispears op gona be op build just like pig
---
It doesn’t change the fact that half of his ability is unavailable on non sleeping targets. Not only that it is his ability to end chases basically making him an m1 killer against any non sleeping targets
---
Well I’ve learned now haha, even if it was the hard way, so am I right in thinking to get every survivor up to level 50, and then prestige one I want and so on?
---
Nice Dokaebi btw
---
Have you watched his streams? He does *when he wins*. If he doesnt do well he just leaves or gets salty
---
The best reward for me as a killer main is playing peaceful games at lower ranks
---
That’s exactly what he needs to do, is pop out of gen.  Gawd, how horrifying would it be to do gens after that.
---
Haddonfield is only bad if you are not the Doc... or michael... which is kinda strange because they both do exactly the opposite from each other.
---
The biggest thing to be aware of since the spirit's release would be the End Game Collapse, you should look up the specifics on that but the TLDR is the hatch spawns regardless of how many completed gens there are, the killer can close the hatch now but can lo longer grab you out of it and if they do close the hatch it powers up the exit gates and begins a countdown from 3 minutes.  At the end of the three minutes all survivors still in the trial die.
---
Prove Thyrself got a pretty healthy buff, it now grants an extra 10% repair speed for each survivor on a generator, especially great with bond.
---
For the most part I run Bond, Prove Thyself, Adrenaline and Sprint Burst and some kind of tool box.
---
All the exhaustion perks are still considered meta, adrenaline is almost always part of a high ranked survivor's build.
---
D Strike now only activates when you get tunneled off the hook and go down within a minute. 
---
Self Care is now in kind of a weird place because they slightly slowed the healing speed a bunch of patches ago and buffed sloppy butcher which makes self care take almost a minute to heal yourself without a med kit, IIRC.
---
Same thing happened with the Legion fix, all the hivemind followers were repeating how Legion « died » ect... Just because they heard of it from multiple people but they don’t even know their reasons !
---
Freddy needs to be better no doubt, but my christ this sounds like cancer to play against when you get down to like, 2 gens
---
hate to break your bubble dude, but freddy rework isnt going to be a thing till a month or two, dedicated servers will continue be tested till the next chapter release(the one after scream), archive is going to be a midseason patch for the next chapter release and rank reset happens next next chapter mid season patch.
---
&gt;map is literally filled with tight corridors with the safest pallets in the entire game especially near the basement, and the freezer room and maze are juke city
---
"It's killer sided!"

To be fair though isn't the corner watermarked for who did it?
---
I don't mind being charged, I just wish they actually looked good lolol
---
No it's not. This was from the community portion, they just talked about their favorite memes, fan art, and cosplay.
---
Still should credit
---
Nice to know and yeah, that does sound really good (not the grinding part tho but whatever). Many thanks!
---
1 -You can always choose your side. It's good to play with both, as it boost your decision making skills.
---
2 - the game has never been so well-balanced, so, it's a great time to buy the game. And there is an event coming with a double bloodpoints weekend.
---
3 - You will get bullied, even if you get a 4k. It's not in every match, and definitely not in higher ranks. But it's fine, not how people mentions it, and you can even punish the bullys in the same game. The game is balanced for the killer to get 2k. So, if you can't take a 4k, that's ok.
---
4 - If you are a meta player, Nurse is the greatest (in PC). Hillbilly and spirit coming in second (community's opinion). But it is up to you, every killer is ok to play, and I recommend you to find what is the best for you.
---
I mean the dude is using the NPC meme, you can't get more brain damaged than that.
---
precisely. particularly the chase dailies but it's just nice to have
---
We can't say for certain even on that tho. If his ability is gonna end up with so many downsides at the end then i don't even think he would be better.
---
I just don't like the idea of a killer being dependent on a power that isn't reliable because of the fact that he needs to wait for it to suddenly activate
---
I want old Freddy (
---
Agreed
---
Alright many thanks!
---
Im not saying it is a big issue in DbD but hackers can be a big problem in some PC games, which as i say is one of the reasons why i prefer console gaming.
---
This executive looks like a fatter Randy Pitchford
---
yeetus
---
ok bubward
---
I just read your name. Thanks for the perks on my survivor idea.
---
There’s people that use it as its advertised, a massager. But it’s on the desk so idk lol. Also there’s people that are into vibrators and you don’t have to put it inside anywhere. Also it’s none of our business XD.
---
Humans share things like this so as to relate with other people who have experienced the same. 
---
They probably just want others to bitch along with them. Just human nature, nbd.
---
I feel ya. A simpler solution might just be a pop up notification once it's complete.
---
You can do it before queuing and while in a lobby. 
---
You'll press either play as survivor or killer and sit in your own alone lobby and you can change everything, killer/survivor you want to play, outfit, perks. Then you'll press find lobby and you'll go into queue, and when you get put into an actual lobby you'll have until you find a full lobby plus 30ish seconds to keep messing with stuff.
---
So I'm kind of torn about this. This scenario only really hurts if the survivors failed to complete all the gens, and the killer finds the hatch before the last survivor. So before egc, there was no chance of a gate escape for the last survivor in this scenario, now there is. The killer can instantly lose if the survivor finds hatch first. The killer can also lose if the killer goes hatch hunting while the survivor camps door (there's a guessing game here, I know). 
---
But the real key point is that the killer has already done their job in this scenario, preventing the completion of the generators. In this scenario it should be rare for the last survivor to escape, and the survivor should consider themselves lucky, not skilled if they do escape.
---
All that being said, even when two survivors need to get one of the gates open, it's hard on the same wall even with two of you.
---
Daddy Mathieu\~
---
I hope it's gonna be like that and now they can go ahead and just add nancy thank you :)
---
Time to buy Freddy 😏
---
The fact they got rights for just the mask instead of the whole character just kind of bummed me out, while the mask is iconic, we like the characters for a reason.  Them taking this loophole really just cheapened the whole thing. Should've had it all or not at all.
---
It's almost as if cleansing all 5 dull totems is a massive waste of time and completely worthless when you are not in a 4 man SWF
---
Except its throwing shade at the devs that arent responsible for people's individual choice to disconnect. Sure, the devs need to put work in to counter the problem, but it boils down to people in their playerbase being shitty and people being shitty isnt going to change just because you get pissy with the devs
---
Nice alright. I'll probably get the game then!
---
You're welcome
---
And? Lots of people have them, I'm sure he uses it on his gf/wife.
---
BROO I PLAY BOTH SIDES AND I HAAATEEE CORN MAPA AS SURVIVOR AND KILLER
---
Main Spirit/Nea
---
&gt;Can I always be a killer or will the matchmaking put me as a survivor at times? I must admit that I'd hate playing something else than the killer.
---
You pick a side to queue up as. Fancy some survivor? Queue as survivor. Wanna play as killer? Queue as killer. You are completely free to pick who you want to play.
---
&gt;Heard about a new patch with ranking and stuff, is it the right time to pick up the game?
---
I personally don't think enough details are known about the new matchmaking system to say now is a good time or not.
---
&gt;How badly will I get bullied on this game as a killer? I'm winning all my games in Deathgarden and am by no means a bad player but I heard that survivors have the edge in this game?
---
In low ranks, you'll dominate. In high ranks, it's more skill-based, but survivors definitely have the edge, and build variety goes down the shitter. Survivors also like to get really fucking toxic in post-game chat sometimes. You'll be fine if you really enjoy killer and have thick skin.
---
&gt;DLC chars, anything I should know about? I'm definitely a meta player.
---
Every character has 3 unique perks. They can't be taught to other characters until you unlock the teachable version of these perks in the Bloodweb of the original character at level 30, 35 and 40. I'm saying this because most meta perks are teachables from DLC characters.
---
Every week, 4 different teachables show up in the Shrine of Secrets. It's the only way to unlock teachables of characters you haven't acquired. You buy these teachables with Iridiscent Shards, which are earned after completing a match. A teachable in the Shrine of Secrets costs 2000 Iridiscent Shards.
---
You can either buy the DLC for the perks you want or wait for the Shrine of Secrets to have a perk you need, which could take ages. Two perks you'll absolutely want to have as killer are Ruin and Barbecue &amp; Chili. Ruin can be acquired by leveling the Hag to level 35 and Barbecue &amp; Chili can be acquired by leveling Bubba to level 35.
---
Because they're annoying, and I do know the feel of iridescent heads, they suck, but so do instaheals, so it really depends on what wide you main, I mostly main survivor, so I'm only scared of tombstone Myers and leather face in the basement
---
I mean what do you count as toxic. I’m always called toxic for looping so if you’re one of those people then no.
---
I actually spit my coffee out reading this as I scrolled, GJ :’P
---
Wouldn't surprise me considering there's already a Spongebob reference.
---
10/10 perfect killer
---
DS is an anti tunneling perk. If you never get to use it, then you never get tunneled. 
---
Also, your DS idea is a bad one. It would be still useless against a killer who can end chases quickly ( aka The Nurse ), but OP against killers who struggle with chases ( aka The Trapper, The Cannibal, The Clown, The Doctor, The Legion, The Pig, The Wraith, etc ).
---
No. Thats not toxic. I'm talking about those who intentionally make the chat very unwelcome and disconnecting after one very small mistake
---
Nice thanks a lot. I heard about the chat toxicity and I don't mind it. Would make me laugh more than anything else.
---
I was expecting more action in action based game instead of mahjong archives with activities that will likely ruin many matches. Oh well at least my expectations were quite. Let's see how long people can play one game mode till they uninstall.
---
Credit to u/walruspuddng for the format.
---
Ayyy my boy! Those Amory Wars comics ain't cheap! LMAO
---
Hey mxjic, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Damn, sounds pretty good (job so far), thanks !
---
Also, while is chasing a survivor considered tunneling ? What is supposed the killer to do, leave you alone, so you can complete all gens ?
---
I think that’s your own projection - it might not be intended to be shade, as that is a regular meme people use in response to the game being weird.
---
Because some skins you'll have to buy for $10 a pop, as we do now, and some may only be available if you pay $10 for the premium pass.
---
That's on top of the $30 game and multiple $10 DLCs.
---
That's a lot of money to be asking of your fans.
---
I use BBQ and Nurses with Billy. I typically switch between Ruin and Tinkering. 3K and 4K almost everytime but only pulling in about 30-40k, feelsbadman
---
How is it unusable. I use mine almost every game
---
Let’s agree to disagree lol
---
Playing against a Spirit that camps their totems all game is incredibly boring.
---
Game is heavily survivor sided if you know how to run the killer around. Doctor on that map is a different story though.
---
Thanks man, most underrated comic series out there!
---
 An not cheap by any means, those 1st editions and then theres show specific editions you can only get at the concerts.
---
Needs less clothes :P. But really, really good so far, gonna work on it more?
---
Next killer: Ghost Rider
---
That's pretty funny
---
What about survivor queue times?
---
where can I find the details about freddy rework
---
I wanna bust a nut too
---
Then ignore them. It was just Ruin, HG had been popped in the first minute. ToTH and Ruin were active, they had 2 gens to go and 3 of them alive. Like jesus christ i wasn’t even running beads.
---
The game may actually feel like it left beta finally.
---
Almost always instant.
---
Imagine being a Rank 5 and still having to DC instead of just taking a loss
---
The Cotes is cute but this Stefan is more spit in your face cute
---
Aight you do you boo
---
You did a great job!
---
Look at all the MoM, BT, and DH. They clearly had plenty of second chances and it's not like you had prayer beads. If you came to them just, oh IDK, get off the totem?
---
In my experience, DS is still a very popular perk, especially at high ranks.
---
And ? Your idea of a perk would still be useless, because people would play just Nurse, Billy and Spirit all day to end chases quickly and avoid DS.
---
And If a killer chases you for the entire match, he already lost the match and depiped, I see no reason to punish him more
---
He posted it in comments
---
I never see it being used. I never see it saving someones life when being used. I never get to use it when i have it on. Its like unbreakable in this case which i think is a bad perk too.
---
Thank you. I can't find one that just flips the green/gold colors. Some of them are sweet though.
---
Killer main here! 
---
If the survivors wouldn't automatically try to mock any killer they see, I would enjoy it more. See, for me it's immersion &gt; points. 
---
It really sucks to do your best as the Killer and having survivors making you feel like it takes them no effort to avoid you and are no threat. It feels like you're wasting time trapped in an exploity loop rather than it being a thrilling hunt.
---
Though IF you catch them, it's super satisfying... Only for them to say that you're bad and that you're worthless in the post game chat.
---
If you can't catch them they say that you're an easy killer to play against. I don't mean to harm the actual person behind the player, so why are they? 
---
This is what demotivates me from playing more. I miss my Candle wraith and kimino Spirit.
---
I like the wraith in the background too.
---
I’m not enjoying the grossness coming from them the last few days. Enough about dildos and vibrators. Degenerates, everywhere!
---
Literally can’t win in their eyes. I understand what people say, ‘just ignore them it doesn’t matter’ ‘they’ll always say something’ etc, but man i just kinda wish i could have a nice short chat after a game with the people i just spent 15 minutes playing it with.
---
Regardless of performance or how the game went, it’s always the same. Add on top DCing on first hit, most of them not letting me hook them if they think they’re gonna lose, and hatch always spawning, it’s hard for me to even pip 2/5 games.
---
Because when he got banned a while ago people would spam their chat asking why he was banned and to unban him
---
Current DS is fine and fills the purpose its for which is to counter campers and tunnelling.
---
Lol nice
---
And totems are a toxic build now???? LMAO. What happens when i run SF and Enduring? I’m “afraid of loops”? it’ll go on till the end of time
---
Imagine getting triggered over a twitch chat lmao
---
What's the motivation to pay if you get cosmetics you could just outright buy?
---
Not to mention, this is all optional. They're not asking anything of the fans, just don't buy it.
---
What would you think if they limited the perks you could use together by their rarity?
---
So say both Enduring and Spirit Fury are ultra do you can only use 1 or the other. 
---
Same with say DS and MoM etc. 
---
It would definitely add some more variety to games and encourage use of some more niche perks
---
Give Distressing a go.
---
I noticed that too, I think he was specifically talking about crediting in the title though
---
IM A VIRGIN
---
Why do your perks icons look so cool?
---
https://youtu.be/FLjnysLPy-4 take on
---
Yeah this joke has run it's course
---
His perks look really fun to use tho
---
Is this in regards to perks, cosmetics, or everything as a whole for survivor?
---
Youre acting like nobody uses those 3 killers at high ranks anyways.
---
The killer should get punished for tunneling someone for a very long time so he doesnt do that anymore and rather focuses on more important things. This change in DS and would 100% reduce the gen rush posts in this subreddit.
---
your DS idea is terrible because decent killers can just purposely end a chase and start it over again + why do survivors always want to take advantage from strong perks in exchange of doing nothing?
---
Make a version with less clothes PLS!
---
didn't we like know that? he didn't mention they will all come out like now with ghostface
---
Love the proportions on this, the mask is awesome too &lt;3
---
Using this icon pack, just put it on today!

Thats awesome

**SHE'S BACK**
---
Man, clown can be countered really easy, just throw pallets erly when facing him, if you are greedy against a clown you are gonna get fucked. The only killers who don't need to mindgame is nurse.
---
They already play billy at high ranks. Nurse is like i said OP against everything in this game. She should get nerfed. This is a perk for less skilled tunneling killers. A good killer also wont fall for current DS.
---
And of course the survivors will get the gens done in some amount of time if you cant kill them. The difference is if they do that in 3 minutes or 10.
---
Hey alien_coffee, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
I have several saved clips of me escaping solely because of DS
---
would you follow your own motto if you were the toxic one? doubt it
---
See, it's an illusion. He does not really want a discussion, nor he wants to take a critique. He does like praises and he does like to pretend as if he cares about two-sided conversation, but in reality it's all about him. Classical narcissism, and it's a bit too late to do something with it at his age :/
---
They aren't making you pay anything. It's cosmetics, it doesn't affect the game, and you can already access a bunch without paying
---
Fuck yea dude.
---
**Vomits**
---
The scarecrow also is the most able to blend in with a corn field, Claudette's a very good at blending in
---
thank you, you too. You're a good bot.
---
Ma'am, this is a Wendy's
---
He's been here all along for those capable of learning hard killers.
---
Uh...see what had happen was I kinda freed one of em cause you know he said he was good at cards. So i was like bet if he win he can go Scott free....I didnt expected him to have a ace in the whole tho...I'm sorry I ruined dinner I'll go order some pizza from freddy's
---
This is a year ago
---
Traps are luck based and do nothing at the end
---
Shit people being shit
---
This 100 times. All these perk packs totally neglect the offerings
---
I love it, especially how they considered powers from the actual movies. Dream snares are like the one scene from the original when Nancy goes up the sticky stairs, and dream pallets really show you Freddy is the one IN CONTROL in the dream world. I seriously can't wait for all the mindgames I can pull as him.
---
As if that changes anything
---
because your DS won't always work. what if your teammates don't do gens? you basically run the killer over in vain 'cause the extra minutes you'll get from DS won't help you either since nobody works on gens and the killer will take a huge advantage from this since they want to get rid of the strongest survivor and demolish the others after. nothing? because any good survivor can run a killer around with or without strong perks, your DS idea is asking to get chased (same like MoM, asking to get hit) which there's no counterplay, you can't compare those perks with perks like Deliverance or Adrenaline which are very strong but in exchange to profit from them, you need to do the objective or be altruistic + that those have counterplay as well.
---
“Nothing personal kid”
---
As if it was that wrong in the first place
---
I try not to be too opinionated so people dont attack me for how I feel lmao
---
But they are really cool!
---
I'm glad! Now when survivors are looking back at me chasing, they see me teabagging at full sprint! Like, DURING the chase.
---
When they go stiff and you just know it's happening yet again
---
What is your strategy when you use it?
---
They did fix the aura reading on ormund so its not complete shite anymore
---
Agree to disagree
---
I believe that they mean you will be ranked against other players doing what you do, rather than against the opposing team. So if you're playing killer, instead of ranking up if you 'beat' the survivors, you will rank up if you score better against them than the other killers who faced them. I expect we will get some details about exactly how it works eventually. As of now, 'meaningful' ranks just means like ranked against like.
---
Michael will never be redundant

You are gay

But why does that crow have a bow?

Also gonna put this here: both sides have toxic shit, we just need to deal with it

Hey Genkanna, I hope you have a wonderful day.

Tbh, this was kinda funny 😁.
---
Aw thanks, I hope you have a wonderful day too DayWisher
---
That gen-teleporting thing is going to hurt everyone that doesn't have Sprint Burst, and will be damn good with Pop Goes the Weasel. But I guess he still has to actually chase you and M1 you afterwards, though, so.
---
Is faking a window vault a mind game?
---
Bondage clown would look like a rotisserie ham.
---
Not if your team leaves you which happens a lot more lately.
---
And if that kind of killer even gets just that 1 kill or 2 then thats like a win for them. They killer should be taught to not do that and rather go for 1. Less skilled survivors. 2. Focus on gens
---
You can tho? They said it's available with playtime right, meaning shards?
---
Ohhh so I shouldn’t break my own totem? And thanks so much tbis is really useful. I’m going to level meg up now!
---
Not dehumanizing a gay person if you are a gay human
---
IHSHAHA
---
Except not getting a character can set you at major disadvantages if you have to wait on the shrine of secrets to get their teachable perks. Some, like Hex: Ruin or Barbeque &amp; Chili  or Make Your Choice are meta mainstays for killers, especially the two you’re referring to on those latter perks.
---
A battle pass in a $20 game with over $70 of DLC is getting ridiculous, and the “only cosmetics” argument is paper thin and tired for a game you already paid for. Its still not good for a game. You are essentially forking over a subscription fee to be encouraged to constantly play for challenges and rewards, some of which you might not even be interested in. Buyers are doing for a price what the game wants players to do in the first place.
---
Its not right for these devs to be crawling around like ticks trying to suckle off the success of mechanics that worked in a FREE TO PLAY game to get even more money from the playerbase than the quarterly DLC and pricey cosmetics shop nets them.
---
You’re assuming I’m gay then? For what reason? I guess you’re gay since it’s all you can talk about lol
---
Myers cannot counter it completely, his Tier 3 still counts as a hit and unless he uses Tier 3 on you all 3 times you will still get to use it at some point.
---
That's decent. I just feel like an unconditional headstart on a killer is always worthwhile
---
Not to mention it still makes u the obsession and when killer see that they just slug and wait it out. So you still get tunneled. For some killers without mobility, by the time they get back to the hook area, the ds timer has already worn out. The perk is garbage.
---
Yeah I am tough guy or should I say tough gay
---
He's trolling.
---
Check the sticky on the front page
---
I heard that a streamer got banned in dvd because of pics like that so is this legal?
---
I wont grind again every survivor to p3 with all perks 😅
---
:D
---
Wow so you’re a homophobic troll. I’m putting your username on the list, thanks for outing yourself you PoS ;)
---
It was in the stream, I forget what time though!
---
I honestly feel they don’t mean it like that. I think they mean the rewards are available with play time.
---
See but the reason game companies began using these unethical practices is because they worked. If people did not buy battle passes or season passes or whatever the game decides to call it, then they would die off. They continue to exist and thrive because people allow them to by supporting them.
---
what i love most about these hexes is that i swap them between Hag and Spirit without using Ruin so when i'm playing Hag, the survivors will think it's DH and will desperately trying to get it. and with Spirit, they will ignore it at all cost thinking it's HG
---
Ash in B tier based of off voice actors? This is actual blasphemy
---
I don't think you understand what tunnelling is, tunnel is when you are unhooked and the killer chases you instead of the unhooker, DS already counters tunnelling, so your rework of changing it so its based off time you are being chased is just a buff to campers as when your unhooked you can just be hit back down still.
---
I was tired and legit thought" how the hell did that guy manage to be in the locker for 2 hours"
---
You can't break your own totem. Only survivors can break totems. If you're breaking a totem and it doesn't have fire under it, there is no hex perk on it. If it has fire under it, there is a hex perk on it. You'll also get a bunch of bloodpoints for breaking a totem. 600 if there's no hex on it, 1000 if there is. :)
---
BOOOOOOsted.
---
tinman probably also has calm spirit, considering his expressions he probably would be screaming nonstop
---
Imagine using self-care in 2019 lol
---
This was really hard. Some survivors have really good screams on the hook, but their pain/struggling noises are not very good. Some more notable characters like Ash or Bill are true to their characters which is awesome, but their performance doesn't match the tone of the game and can feel a bit awkward.
---
I have no idea lol. Maybe because I said "good". Either that or Skynet is watching.
---
First of all I never said you were disrespectful, second you were just complaining about how survivors bring you down and they insult you ecc.
---
That is what your comment was about, complaining.
---
Also I don’t think you wanted tips on how to play since you never asked and even so there is legitimate flair in this subreddit for that kind of thing.
---
How is chasing the injured survivor tunneling? Its the smart thing to do. Chasing someone for 3 minutes is not the smart thing to do.
---
Going for the injured survivor is camping in my opinion.
---
I am not sure. I cannot find a game as killer at all. It is usually instant.
---
I’ve noticed this too. I main Adam and got that cosmetic the day of. Love the head piece
---
What's wrong with Self-Care?
---
Oh ok, well only time will tell, heh. *shrug*
---
Nah to chuck survivors is why.
---
David's scream sounds like the voice actor was in genuine pain. You hear that shit all the way across the map lol
---
MoM is the only OP perk tbh. And a key isnt equal to a mori
---
Constantly. Granted i have pretty bad connection , the best i get i yellow,rarelly green. But there are times where i get people wiyt red and cant seem to get to go down. Ofcourse i dont leave the lobby,the wait times are unbelivable.What i dont understand is why the survivors stay if they see what the ping is ? As far as i know survivor que times are much faster. Someone correct me if im wrong. And tell me if im being unreasonable in not living.
---
Prayer beads for spirit
---
Anal beads from Freddy.
---
&gt; Chasing someone for 3 minutes is not the smart thing to do.
---
As i have already said, the killer is punished for this as all 4-5 generators can be completed within 3 minutes by 3 survivors, they will also lose a pip.
---
The killer does not need any additional penalty for chasing you through loops, its already there through the pip system and the fact that survivor objectives go extremely fast when the killer does not defend them.
---
If you dont like it you dont have to get it...
---
*makes mental note*
---
Whilst that is true it's much easier to complain towards the people putting these things into the game than the people purchasing it, especially when a lot of the people buying it are completely oblivious to the darker side of it. Not to mention yelling at everyone isn't a good way of getting your view across, you know?
---
Um excuse me??? Fengs squeals are  S tier.
---
I mean even if our collection is shit it's not lag switching unless we make the connection worse at specific points.
---
that is not a gamer build from the killer
---
Freddy and green mori
---
People just got mad because they, themselves started calling it a battle pass, which reminds them of fortnite and it’s mainstream to hate on fortnite. I bet if people just called it a season pass instead of battle pass they would be less mad. But I really like the name rift for it.
---
JOIN THE MEG CLUB

Cry.
---
Remake Freddy looks fun, but the way they were talking about it sounds like it's a little more "balanced" then they'd like you to believe.
---
Nothing, it's just not as universally applicable as it used to be. It's a pretty great boost to MoM for sure.
---
MoM, Adrenaline, Balance Landing with an offering for Haddonfield, DS+Deliverance+Unbreakable ( so you can unhook in the killer face and hit him with the DS, without him being able to slug you ).
---
You’re too kind ❤️
---
It is obnoxious. As someone who is a great team player nothing makes me want to dc like a shitbag selfish teammate. I only don’t do it cause it will punish everyone else.
---
"The PLAG dude!"
---
I made a post with just the format on it you can screenshot/download it there :)
---
What more of an excuse do you need?
---
Its just cosmetics God dammnit.
---
Don't buy it if you don't wanna support the idea.
---
And is it released yet? No. So stop assuming that it's not gonna promote fun.
---
Sorryforactinglikeabratiamjustreallystreesedoutrightnow.
---
Awesome
---
Why do I hear boss music?
---
It now takes three *protection* hits to gain full stacks
---
Its like winning the game right? You literally dooked on them so bad they left the game.
---
AFAIK he's getting the gen teleport no matter what (which takes 5 seconds to channel and creates a visual tells at the generator, so not quite a nurse blink), what they're unsure about is whether he gets fake pallets AND the ground traps
---
Huntress tied up people in her house in her lore, hag was also tied up. Nurse is literally getting choked by her mask, they should all be bondage
---
And me thought you played a Ebony Mori Nurse 😁.
---
Just ignore that guy, they complain about everything.
---
The Killer is in your terror radius. Run.
---
heal yourself to almost full and then next time you are in a chase fully heal after you drop your next pallet since by that point it will be close to end game anyway
---
&gt; Yes my idea is that they get even more and directly punished. So they notice "hey. Maybe i shouldnt chase the same guy for 3 minutes"
---
There is nothing wrong with chasing someone for 3 minutes, the killer has 5 generators worth of time to invest, and if they choose to invest most of their time in 1 chase for 1 kill, that survivor does not deserve an escape because the killer chose to manage their time like that.
---
It would be like giving the killer a perk which says "if no generators are completed in 2 minutes, all survivors not doing gens get exposed and can be killed directly by the killer for the rest of the match" because the survivors chose to do something else rather than just fixing gens at the start of the game, such as looking for totems.
---
Fuuuuuuuuu
---
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ they need to start making it so where if you quit a certain amount of times you get banned for 30-60 minutes
---
The thing is you don’t even have to pay for the battlepass. Even the “paid” section can be unlocked through normal gameplay.
---
i think they fixed it in the newest patch or the previous one cuz it was even hard to see gens.
---
I could do this all day
---
And you can do this all gay
---
I don't watch montages I watch then play full games.
---
You can still juke killers. Nurse less so but she's different from every one else.
---
You go near a building, say the shack. You have several options, go for the pallet, go for the window, fake out the window making them waste a hit. Change the direction you run in. Run away while the killer tries to find you.
---
Besides the fact, killers are supposed to be stronger in a 1v1, it's a 4v1. They have to be more powerful to balance it out. The point is to waste time, not be promised a free escape
---
It's super Freddy!
---
I would say that 20 seconds should be more than enough to hit them , especially as you will have the jump on them
---
When you're that age, everyone is underage.
---
how do you blink downwards to basement?
---
Rank 1 toxic survivor main here, ruin is useful until about rank 6. Most survivors at high ranks have faced ruin so many times we kinda know the locations and how to work through it. The perk is excellent for newer killers. Even if the perk last 10 seconds, if every survivor is working a gen and fails the skill check it pretty much resets those ten seconds. Multiply that by four and that forty seconds or most of a gen. Now of course that the most optimal situation but ruin generally last about 40-60s. Past rank 6 It does slow us higher rank survivors down but not nearly as much as lower rank. Your answer from me is more depending on what character your using. A trapper at rank one needs ruin to place traps while a billy with enough skill should be relatively fine.
---
It would be tough to give up, but I would if it would mean that the community would prosper
---
The voice actor for Laurie did a really good job sounding like Jamie Lee Curtis. The “husky” quality to her voice and scream is there and it sounds great
---
Drew Ghostface son of Derek Ghostface.
---
Great drawing looks awesome
---
What app do you use?
---
I guess you could say that but I don’t sit waiting 10-15 for a match only for it to end seconds later because the killer is upset
---
I know its insane but i see alot of people including my friends that are upset about it. Its like if you went to school for a PHD and i didnt go even graduate high school we should have access to the same types of jobs.
---
Well, if we compare that to EA......
---
Picsart and meme generator. This template was screenshotted by me during the stream.
---
Ya but i its like you were beating the shit out of some person in a fight and they decided to run away instead of still fighting you. Who wants to get fucking beat up?
---
We need a infinity glove as a cosmetic.
---
Thank you :-)
---
To be fair, the DS rework was a nerf and MoM is getting nerfed as well...
---
The fact that they are purple ranks and the killer is yellow ranks
---
Well,you can see him teleporting because the gen starts to spurt blood everywhere,and I guess the teleporting range is limited?If it has unlimited range that shit would be broken AF.
---
The DCing is toxic, but the teabagging is just people having fun, not that bad imo
---
In excitement of the upcoming ghostface chapter, here's my offering to the entity.
---
“Do you like scary movies?”
---
I agree completely. She was actually originally in S tier! I moved her down because her struggling noises were super awkward. I kinda regret it because the rest of her noises definitely exceed a lot of the other survivors in S tier.
---
You can buy it with shards, they said it in their stream.
---
My idea is fair and manageable. Your example was unfair and OP. The killers objective is to get a 4k and dont let the gens get finished. Doing anything else like investing their time to something that stupid just to complain on reddit for genrushs is dumb.
---
It would like i said. "Teach" the killer to do something else like for example noed teaches the survivors to do totems (you cant believe how many times i heard that phrase in this subreddit)
---
And if you can run a killer for 3 minutes. You do deserve to escape or atleast make the killers time a bit harder.
---
Again. A good killer woudlnt notice much if any of this rework.
---
Pig because I like the saw movies. It is are my favorite horror franchise and I'm glad they brought pig to the game.
---
plag squirt that ooey gooey green pus 🤤
---
1.It is your chance on wether or not your will play killer 
---
2.Honestly yes, this has been something that a lot of people have wanted for a long time 
---
3.Yes, it’s common for some survivors to get annoyed it pissed when they lose or don’t do good in the game 
---
3.There are a lot of good perks that killer’s have such as Bamboozle, Barbecue and chilli, pop goes the weasel, discordance, make your choice, blood warden and probably a few more I didn’t name for killers
---
 i'm just saying that they're being somewhat hypocrite
---
I think it only ends the stealth where he has no terror radius or red stain
---
Even after the nerf it’s still arguably the best survivor perk. While it may take longer than it used to, it is still a hell of a lot more reliable than having to find a teammate (if any are even left) every time you get injured.
---
I mean, even if it was payed, I wouldn't mind. It's just cosmetics and you can't blame them for trying to make money and cosmetics are quite harmless way to do so. Not to mention that we will get stuff from the free pass as well.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Pretty happy about all of this to be honest. Looking forward to these exciting changes.
---
Ahhh, I get what you mean, but doesn't this make enduring+Spirit fury almost nescessary for m1 killers?
---
The title says "see themselves", not "see their weapons" ;)
---
To be fair, I'm with you in some way on Ash. I think it's primarily because Bruce was given no context to the lines and the screams, I've got the audio files and honestly it's kinda obvious from Bruce's tone that he has no idea what to emote for the lines, especially his "Ugh, what is this place?" line.
---
I agree, the gen teleporting is the only thing that I found to be Freddy. Fake pallets is sorta Freddy, maybe if he teleports around them(something) Freddy should be a trickster in my opinion. I think another thing to replace of traps would to be able to send a clone to chase you, while he’s turns invisible for a bit.
---
Hey gDayWisher, I hope YOU have a wonderful day.
---
It's easy to not notice if you dont read. I heal and leave and no killers ever come. It's so brief too when I'm killer that it's usually not worth pursuing because they will be so far.
---
When you have spine chill Prayer Beads Spirit is a free win
---
Self Care is mediocre.  Slow af heals that waste an incredible amount of time.  Borrowed time literally only punishes baby killers that camp and tunnel off hook.  How is that even remotely a crutch lol?
---
&gt; I view these "avenues" you brought up as more of bringing every demographic of player under a different type of money making "umbrella" of sorts (sorry I literally can't think of the right word I want to use).
---
That’s also the way I see it as well. I enjoy being able to play the game as well as all the new chapters that come out, but have only bought one cosmetic item and that was the fucking puppet. The only other killer or survivor cosmetics I have were free from events. I don’t buy anything from the shop because skins are ridiculously expensive imo but a battlepass that’s no more than $10 is very much worth it and if it gives you enough currency to buy the next battlepass for free it turns into a shit ton of cosmetics for the price of one in the store. 
---
For someone who has no problem buying from the shop but also now wants the skins in the battlepass it kinda sucks, but with the amount of skins in the pass it’ll likely end up being a way better deal than buying just one skin anyway.
---
I think you mean baby Megs
---
Well yeah, but i mean at that point what does it do for him aside from hes short, yknow? if it removes all the benefits of crouching except for the literal squatting down, it basically cancels it out
---
I dont think he will. Myers constantly has a low terror radius while ghostface (to my understanding) has a terror radius of 32 meter.
---
He can turn that off for 6 seconds (if i remember correctly) and thus probs can be lengthened via addons. Yet survivors can deny his attempt to get the exposed status affect if the see him. He needs to stay hidden and that can be quite hard with only 6 seconds of 0 terror radius.
---
Myers doesnt suffer from the same issues. Yes he has to stalk longer, but only for like 1 second since reaching tier 3 takes 5 seconds instead of 4. Its not targeted to a single survivor and lasts longer.
---
Ofcourse i cannot say this for certain since the ptb isnt out yet, but i think mikey still takes the cake here.
---
That being said while i will stay with mikey, im excited to see how ghostface will operate once people get ahold of his playstyle.
---
Tru, but if you don't... oh boy
---
Yes! To all of this... minus the insidious camping lol. That’s a legit strategy (albeit a noobish one that hardly pays off) that does occasionally work.
---
Wait... how can an opinion be wrong? That's the point of it. It cant be right or wrong 😂😂
---
I really don’t get what I’m supposed to do in this situation.
---
Its not exactly like that,but even if it was ,isnt killer supposed to get stronger the longer the game lasts already ?
---
The battle pass only sucks cause there will never be any Laurie cosmetics :(
---
It could help with mindgames around loops and unsafe pallets. Like Hag it’d be hard to see over structures so he could moonwalk and land a hit potentially
---
It would be tunneling if I purposely chased the hooked guy. I went back to the unhook and followed scratch marks and I found the injured guy that was hooked. So what am I supposed to do? Say naw this is tunneling and leave him? No. 
---
Also you call it “tunneling” when I have 2 survivors and I’m after the injured one. What am I supposed to give up? 
---
Also also within the chase I would see a fully healthy Kate, should I stop and go for her rather then the injured person who would take me on for another 5 minutes? No that’s fucking dumb. 
---
Also I “camped” him. Alright I have my explanation. What would you want me to do? Usually walk away to other generators have the person get insta saved and then be on another long chase? 
---
No I knew the Kate was there so I stuck around for a bit. The persons struggle bar didn’t even hit half and as soon as I was about to leave Kate showed up.
---
Ehh, I don't know. I feel like the Battlepass would be cool if it didn't go so over-the-top as Fortnite. Perhaps make the Free one actually quite expansive and not really limiting and pointless unless you have the paid one.
---
I'm going off of all the noises the characters make! There's actually a surprising amount of voice clips in the game's audio files ranging from screams, to grunting, to running, to dangling, and even falling (which I think was a recent thing the devs added). The average character actually has around 7 minutes of "dialogue" which is insane since all of them are only a few seconds long!
---
The fuck how is ds a crutch then by their logic. And no i only really see bt fuck kids up on purple and greens ranks.
---
So you think its bad to go from injured state to healty with 60 seconds of time wasted while carying any addon as well?
---
Yea :D The main disadvantage is that it's small and survivors are confused for all the time, where the killer is.
---
equipping both is actually terrible
---
How dare you bring pig into this
---
It's not a matter of legal vs. illegal, but IIRC the Devs have said that they won't personally ban over it, but if the program they use to check for file tampering catches it, they won't reverse it.
---
YOUR SOUL IS MINE
---
So you think i love getting tunneled for 3 minutes?
---
And survs should get rewarded because ist something. They. Are. Actually. Meant. To. Do. Without. Being. Dumb.
---
And so youre saying that tunneling for 3 minutes is fun? You dont get the point. If a killer tunnels you for 3 minutes and then kills you. They are happy mostly. So make them unhappy so they change in the way they are playing.
---
And a good killer wont fall for current DS too. A good killer does not camp a hooked survivor. They dont have too because they know. So lets make the new/bad killers know too so they get BETTER
---
You shouldn't have? I thought if they dc you keep your stuff. If you dc you lose it. The last time I had a purple key it was a leatherface and he was farming with a claudette. He used Franklin's on me then I left and she used it to open the hatch. The way items work are complete bullshit.
---
Just because you can write, doesnt mean you should.
---
Theres no need to report them as the devs know who does this stuff
---
Pig skins are fine tho, Billy.
---
What is this copypasta from? Bruh
---
This works generally, but he could also just chase people from hook. So you see someone get hit, then the other person so you think, I guess I gotta go just to see him waiting to hit you too from hook. It’s not always simple.
---
Well hey, I'm pretty sure no one in the stream saw the chat. They were too busy focusing on discussing the stuff they are doing.
---
It still amazes me how survivors can throw salt at someone who is trying to win with a low tier killer. Their life is hard enough as it is
---
&gt; So you think i love getting tunneled for 3 minutes?
---
If the killer is following you for 3 minutes you are sort of a bad player because you can't escape him in a chase...
---
So there is a little chance of getting banned?
---
Idk why they dont sell this icons, they could make some more money, or add them with a dlc or something
---
I was trying to watch the stream, while waiting for a car repair, on my phone.
---
My battery drained in 12 minutes. 
---
I usually can watch twitch for hours.
---
Is it? What are the primary reasons that certain privileges in life have an age restriction? Driving, drinking, smoking, vasectomy, tubes tied, tattoos, voting, etc. They have an age restriction for similar reasons. Based on studies, certain age ranges aren't capable of making appropriate decisions yet.
---
High schoolers and younger have the mental capacity to speak and know what words mean, but still lacking to know actual impacts of their actions. Specifically collective actions.
---
I'm not going to be standing outside offices to advocate for this any time soon, but sometimes that unorthodox opinion needs to be stated in order for others to also think outside the box. I'm content enough with just ignoring them personally.
---
I didn't want to really say it, but since you have a David profile icon, I feel like you'll protect me. I'm not a fan of his campfire voice lines because, like you said, he probably doesn't really know how the dialogue will be used.
---
Also, this is kind of a weird nitpick, but the game's lore explains that the characters return to the campfire after each game, regardless of the outcome, trapping the survivors for eternity. Don't you think Ash would know what the place is by now, and why does he only sound mildly annoyed that he's forced to repeat the trial until the end of time?
---
Redditor, this is the third time this week you have made the same joke in class.
---
Bondage Doctor...so perfect
---
Never lol. Unless you REALLY want the bloodied outfit then it is a monumental waste of time. Especially now that you can get a ton of cosmetics. 
---
I’ve prestiged 3 times (2 times with myers. Once on David King) and regretted it all three. Although I have leveled both characters up to 50+ since then I still have not managed to get back the perks I lost. Literally have nearly all unlocked on them but the ones I want are among the handful I’ve yet to get again.
---
What is archives?
---
Well camping pretty much means staying in the vicinity of the hooked person to stop them from getting saved. Though like you said, sometimes you have no choice but to camp (Gates powered, scratch marks near the hook). The only time I consider camping as toxic is when somebody does it at 4 or 5 gens.
---
So does that mean the lost tapes, Benedict and vigo were observers? As it stands everything they know on perks items and add ons are either themselves or they came from the journal or the tapes. So we didnt have any fog observers in this era until now.
---
Camping is when you hook / kill a survivor, or if you don't immediately go to the other side of the map when you hook a survivor. To ensure you are not camping you should immediately go to the other side of the map and let them unhook, then count to 10 and then continue playing.
---
I am sure his gf/wife uses it on him aswell...
---
Your not tunnelling or camping at all. Just   ignore the salty survivors and play the game how you want :)
---
That is the only way I play.  I think platformers are the only game type where I feel like I NEED a controller to play halfway decent.  WASD is life.
---
Or his ass hole. Why should we care? I know you dont but other people.
---
Lovely!
---
Fuck I fucked up asking the question lol
---
This is the first time where i have actually seen a leatherface get more than 1 survivor with his chainsaw in one attack. (other than when he is camping ofc)
---
I know I shouldn’t have, it was probably a bug, still it’s infuriating af
---
Seriously though!! It feels like we're the only two people who know ghostface just left between the dev corner scenes! Like really, if the devs can switch spots and get on and off the stage without us seeing it, what makes it different for ghostface?? 😂😂
---
I love how you only qoute that one bit and left out everything else :)
---
And if im bad and manage to not die for 3 minutes shouldnt i be rewarded with something too? Like the killer is meant to be rewarded with a kill if he does the same?
---
Bad killer tunnels. Lost gens but gets a kill and is happy for being rewarded.
---
Bad survivor gets tunneled. Lost match gets nothing from it besides a depip and a bad mood and is called toxic.
---
Anytime I lose a item because of someone elses action I get pissed. It's about the only thing that still gets to me.
---
First off, I play survivor 99 percent of my games as I don’t care for killer.
---
I had a daily a couple days ago to get chainsaw downs as Billy, a SWFs joined, and I decided to be nice and to just stay. Sadly they used a Haddonfield Key, which for me is awful for frames (Xbox) and all had BL. Anyway, I got beat up, t-bagged etc, so I D/C. I just simply told them they beat me, and I just wanted to move on, get my daily done and have fun. Sadly they just wanted to keep spamming messages talking shit. 
---
Anyway, purpose of this is I wish we could forfeit without it being a d/c. Not all games are fun, and some games are super frustrating. As a survivor, when a killer quits it is usually because they are getting destroyed. It’s shitty for the survivor, and I wish they implement something for it. It’s def tricky
---
*david downing noises*
---
Yeah ditto.
---
People have problems with loot boxes because they are literally gambling. A battle pass is just a different force of DLC, one where you pay less up front for the possibility of getting more by playing than you would get just buying the stuff. It seems like you’re just virtue signaling and coming up with nonsensical comparisons to justify your knee-jerk adherence to “battlepass is bad”. You haven’t made one actual argument why it’s bad for the game, just continuously saying it is
---
Boo
---
It’s better then what we have now at least
---
Awe, come on. Mcote was just having fun. Leave him alone! BibleThump
---
Before you have to leave the area? Wat happens if you don't ? Well not sure what ur talking about but camping and tunnel rate is the same
---
 I still see it happen alot
---
Play your way? You mean the way was made to be played. The game wasn't made to have bitches disconnect. It's not about points, it's about handicapping the rest of the team. Survivors aren't entitled when they want to save someone. Also, you are gonna lose the match if you camp while everyone does gens. I can't tell if this is a joke or not cause it is so grossly garbage that people can't actually think this. You said you handicap the game by getting moried so you handicap it even more. The hatch thing is obvious or you could kill yourself on hook. Literally stop playing the game if you are this delusional and garbage.
---
Also, don't lie, you have no friends if you act this entitled and gross.
---
This is coming from the person who a month ago posted about people quitting ruining other people's fun and them being babies!
---
You've become the very thing you've sworn to destroy!
---
boo we have to pay for extra content we didnt buy at first.
---
That is true! Survivors can bitch about getting grabbed while stationary due to the alleged lag switching but they don't realize it also makes survivors sometimes teleport around.
---
No. MM can snowball a game easily. You stalk at your convenience and level up based on your desire/need. MM will always be the stronger killer in the sense he can down multiple survivors within one tier 3 phase.
---
Ghostface you don’t build up stalk. It’s per survivor and they can interrupt it by facing you. So, ghostface is really about being as sneaky as possible. 
---
At least that is how I interpreted it. Ghostface seems like he sacrifices a lot of that strength for stealth. Which I’m okay with because I love playing sneaky.
---
You don't have to
---
Well spine chill is literally useless unless you’re immersed
---
Litterally just read the first sentece and knew who it was lmao
---
&gt; Bad killer tunnels. Lost gens but gets a kill and is happy for being rewarded.
---
Yes, he is the killer
---
He got you, you lost the chase, even if it took 1 second or 1 hour, you lost the chase, and he won the chase.
---
So yes, he deserves the kill, and if he wants to be happy getting 1 kill out of 4, why do you want to ruin his fun.
---
You literally are making the point that the killer should be sad after getting 1 kill, if he enjoyed it, then why make it so hes mad?
---
&gt; I love how you only qoute that one bit and left out everything else :)
---
Tired of arguing with you tbh, because you complain about things which aren't problems. Never heard a survivor say after 3 minute chase, damn i wish i could escape for free.
---
It's only temporary, next lobby you have your old rank :)
---
lol who the fuck gets mad at ivory mori's

I want him to choke me

If that’s what you need to enjoy playing then by all means do it. But just gotta ask out of curiosity, do you not have fun if you aren’t leveling up? I mean, I get like that with plenty of games so I absolutely understand but this is not one of them. Actually, this is one of the few games where after I unlocked everything I wanted I didn’t feel like there was any less to do. More like I got something out of the way. 
---
What has kept me entertained from this game has actually been more about advancing my strategies and skills rather than unlocking things and leveling up.
---
Why aren’t DLC’s double dipping then? This is a silly arbitrary distinction
---
Why does the killer get to ruin the survivors fun in this case? Oh because you main killer and are killer sided.
---
And you didnt qoute anything else because you had no arguments for them.
---
While I do agree that moris can be extremely unfair if the survivor was tunneled
---
That survivor most definitely deserved it
---
No then every killer would need multiple ways to play, otherwise it would be unfair.
---
I'm talking about insidious face camping which is just the most cunty thing on earth
---
Don’t think I ever have. But I pay for really good internet.
---
If hes fine being at a disadvantage, sure. You physically cannot camera snap or do the same things on a controller that you can do with mouse and keyboard. If he's willing to hinder himself intentionally that's his call I guess
---
*Michael breathing noises*
---
not really
---
Maybe, just maybe 🤤
---
I have an item hoarder feng build with plunderers ace in the hole and pharmacy so I open then fast :3
---
I love Bruce and all, but honestly the lines in the campfire are rather lackluster, but as I said I'd chalk that up to him not being given any context, hell even some of his injured sounds are...weird like the one where he goes "woahoah". 
---
I wouldn't really worry too much about the line in the campfire and the lore, given how inconsistent the lore is at times and I guess BHVR didn't really bother having the "What is this place" line play as a one off or anything.
---
If you do nothing then no pip...might as well not even play the match.
---
It's a predatory business practice mostly. It's part of the reason fortnite has so much money, other than children of course. It pressures time constraints and exclusivity, making a limited "supply" of digital goods. It's the new lootbox really, another way to gamble but with guaranteed rewards IF you waste your hard earned cash and time on it.   
---
You are paying them for a chance to earn cosmetics, and not everyone is going to have the dedicated time to earn what they just payed for. But shilling your money and supporting business decisions like this only make them do this more, and other games will follow. The masses control stuff like this with their wallets, and just like every other trend...BR, Survival games, Lootboxes. They'll use it more and more until we finally release it's another scam to try and milk us.
---
I do feel all ghostface needs is the ability to stalk outside of night shroud( but it will obviously be lobger that 4 seconds in that case). A tool to help in chase ,ither than hiding the red stain for mindgames.
---
&gt; Why does the killer get to ruin the survivors fun in this case? Oh because you main killer and are killer sided.
---
Actually, i play survivor more than killer.
---
Ill mainly only play killer now to level up my survivors, with BBQ and stuff.
---
&gt; And you didnt qoute anything else because you had no arguments for them.
---
You aren't quoting my stuff now, so ill take it that you have no arguments for them
---
&gt; You love how noed is right now?
---
NOED is alright, i don't break totems for it i just play as if the killer had NOED after gens are powered, just gotta take your time when opening the door and wait for a good opportunity.
---
Agreed. I personally watched the stream through another DBD streamer,  their chat was so much nicer.
---
It's very jarring knowing Horvath did the sounds for David, I do recall McCote saying they "played" with the sound files after Horvath recorded them, which I'd imagine is to make them deeper or so, as Horvath's got a relatively softer voice than David's in-game voice.
---
no deleting needed. The folders are labeled the same as the ones in the “Icons” folder in the DBD directory. So Items, Addons, Perks. Just drag the whole folder of the ones you want to use and it will replace the files
---
One thing is that you can only unlock the perks for the DLC by buying it or spending super grindey shards. Also, what slasher fan doesn't think Michael, Leatherface, or Freddy is cool? Another reason. Also, it's nice to have variety in powers and everything. Just my take.
---
Exactly

[**r/**wholesomememes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes)
---
He is so cute tho
---
all the packs totally neglect the offerings because it breaks the offering screen and isn’t worth it
---
I agree with my playstyle, but some people don’t care about pipping and just want to escape. They get enjoyment out of hiding and escaping like a game of hide and seek.
---
survivors can see the key in your hand, you can message them telling them you have a key.
---
Unhook a survivor 1m from the killer (0/3)
---
Why are you getting downvoted ?
---
Wym? The "gameplay balancing" and "game health" bars span the entire length of the roadmap meaning they will be constantly be looked at across all patches
---
Leave their weakness behind. The fog will eat them for their lack of observation
---
Tbh I never saw it as cunty bc I always assumed that they must either be new or dumb lol. I mean, hiding out by the hook with insidious to try and ambush survivors is one thing. But standing right in-front of the hook in plain sight completely defeats the purpose of insidious. 
---
Lmao of all the ways to be cunty that one just makes ya look like you have no clue what you are doing.
---
the biggest DBD streamers use and distribute perk packs. BHVR has expressed they don’t care but will not help if a anti chest catches it. On that note, EAC also mentioned they don’t look at these files. It’s literally just PNGs
---
1. It’s just some pixels in a video game that one day, maybe not someday soon but one day, will likely die and become irrelevant 
---
2. You can make addiction and argument for anything in any game nowadays. Play all day to get bloodpoints and P3 every character in the game? Addiction. Have to have all the brand new cosmetics in the item shop that are way overpriced? Addiction. Log on every day to complete your daily? Addiction. I just find terms like “addiction” and “predatory” to be complete cop puts when it comes to reasons why such and such a system is bad. It’s like people said this shit about lootboxes (which are those things and actively feed on underage gambling and gambling addiction) and just started calling every micro transaction those words and turned them into a whole lot of nothingness. 
---
3. So if you’re not sure if you’re comfortable making a purchase, maybe just don’t. If you have to question whether or not you have the money or time to complete it, it’s probably best you say fuck it and skip out on it. If by the end of the season you find yourself close enough to the end that you know you can finish in time, then buy it. They’re still just some virtual items in a video game that hold no actual value in your life.
---
Sounds frustrating to play against. I've had plenty of games where I get hooked first and never get to touch a generator because the killer runs back every time I get unhooked.
---
I prefer to cry myself to sleep at night, while others prefer the immediate relief of bitching at you because you didn't play the way they wanted you to. As long as you're not trying to an asshole, I see no problem.
---
What is this Twilight? But also same
---
but if i hide in the corner all game and escape i should rank up right?
---
You watch Puppers for Puppers, not the gameplay.
---
Her wig went flying
---
The changes are needed due to large amounts of complaints on both sides. It’s like Legion. It has to go.
---
Distortion won't work. You'll just drain it at the start. Sole Survivor only works late game and lockers are very inconsistent.
---
Well I was gonna go over in pen like I normally do, but not sure. Might make more sketches of daddy trapper
---
If you like sprint burst you should like urban evasion. The reason sb is bad is because you can't run without using it up, and if you run into the killer you've done more harm than good. You make it seem like It's difficult to find a drop or window in a chase. It isn't, on maps like the game balanced landing is great because there are places to drop everywhere and the increased recovery from stun is necessary for some loops, e.g. laurie's house on haddonfield. On almost all maps you will be able to get to a spot to use your exhaustion before you die. Dead hard is great because it extends loops, you can pallet loop for 2x the amount of time because you can be more risky before you drop the pallet and if you're against a baby killer you can basically infinite them at very safe pallets.
---
WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
---
Haha :D
---
if it makes you feel safe people like noob3 and Jendenise literally use these packs on their videos and livestreams and distribute it and have been for months. i’ve personally been using perk packs for months and nothing has happened. Easy Anti-Cheat also doesn’t care about these files, it’s hardly any deep modification to DBD
---
If only it were Robert Englund Freddy then he'd be perfect
---
today i managed to escape a match, i didn't see the killer once, i didn't get attacked once, i just did gens and got out
---
i depipped. an escape should ALWAYS be a safety pip no matter what
---
nurse tele over pallets/literally anywhere &gt; freddy can tele to like, 7 or so specific, static locations

Benedict is already presumably dead after the Hallowed Blight event’s storyline killed off a journal writer that was MUCH like Benedict, but unknown, and I really hope Vigo is the observer, because he canonically can take control of the Fog, to the point of creating the Hatch, and I wouldn’t be upset if we finally met him ingame
---
WAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
They are, and I’m not a fan of them either, but I’d rather an exchange of “give me 5 bucks and I’ll give you this product” over “subscribe and maybe you’ll get these things”
---
Yeah, it's true. I always use Urban Evasion, Self Care, Sprint Burst, and Mettle of Man. This allows me to move quick across he map (and unseen) and break into a sprint anytime. In the end, I just would rather make a mad dash for it immediately than find somewhere to jump. I agree with dead hard, and have seen it used well, but I don't know how to use it, so idk.
---
Did she actually use to promote that though? Some people have been getting deranking to bully and deranking for faster queue times mixed up.
---
This is def not confirmed
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Lmao. Seriously though. If I see someone has a key I’m sticking near them if I know the hatch has spawned.
---
I don’t understand why people are bad mouthing Tru3, he’s an amazing player and puts a huge amount of effort into his streams and puts a show on for the viewers so that they enjoy themselves, if you don’t like him or the way he acts, there’s plenty more streamers out there that you can watch. 
---
Don’t go around bad mouthing streamers because you don’t like them, it ruins the viewing experience you get when watching him or anything for that matter, just please think before you say anything bad about someone, this is his life, let him live it the way he wants to and not the way you all want him too
---
Anti Cheat is really what I'm concerned about. Where did they say EAC doesn't check these files, if you have that statement on hand?
---
people will call it “tunneling” when they were recently unhooked and go down.  Most survivors will heal at the hook, so that’s considered “tunneling” and “toxic” to go for the person who was just unhooked and injured
---
But a battle pass isn't going to change anything about any of that?
---
I'm so glad this became a format
---
I watched from YouTube as I couldn't bear to look at the chat, on YouTube the comments were closed (I wonder why), i usually don't like watching through someone else's stream maybe it's just me but I visited hybrid pandas stream, people were so nice there.
---
Iron Will isn’t really a second chance but I agree
---
Unfair how? Did the other killers got nerfed after the first week to the bottom of the killer's tier and lasted like that for like 2 years? not to mention getting an actual rework that completely changes their playstyle like it's a new character?
---
Besides, something like being unfair because the others don't get the same is a really bad excuse, Some get something, some others don't, that is how things are in pretty much everything. Besides here is understandable, there are 2 different enough versions of Freddy, Some people have gotten used to old Freddy, some others want the new one. I think it's more fair this way.
---
Now a good reason would be that it would be too much work making the add ons work correctly depending on the Version you are using or something like that. But so far we don't know if it would.
---
I know, I was addressing the first part. "Need every DLC"
---
Or in case they die ignobly. I'm a scavenger, and proud of it.
---
Actually idk how to qoute in reddit and i also dont care about that. Nonetheless i answer most if not all of your arguments that need answering.
---
And getting tunneled is not fun for survivors most of the time unless you got a whole setup and team for that which i dont mostly if ever.
---
Imagine you was a new survivor and got tunneled for a long time by a bad killer? Not exactly what you think of as fun? Maybe its for the killer. Not for the survivor and its not a rare thing to happen at green ranks for example which is what this perk rework was intended to be for mostly.
---
I dont think itll work well with the store we already have, but if there wasnt already a store then it might be fine. I also dont think it helps public opinion that "battle pass" is most often associated with Fortnite
---
&gt; do you not have fun if you aren’t leveling up?
---
I do, i play this game primarily with my girlfriend so i enjoy playing that aspect of the game with her, my issue is i get extremely bored easily, so staring at the same survivor game after game is a bit eh for me to be honest.
---
So i like to spread out my blood points, plus it's bragging rights :P
---
Who is Morris?
---
Ah yes, because the Legions arms are total weapons, the same with every other killer i mentioned.
---
Yea I would never go for the injured survivor in that situation
---
Wait, they are not trolling the killer at all. 3/10
---
Meg imo
---
Glad that you're so positive
---
Oh, I had no idea it broke that. Would you consider doing killer powers as well? IIRC, those won't cause any bugs
---
I added Iron Will as an edit because of how good it is against spirit, not because it's a second chance perk
---
oh, my mistake. of course such skill needs to be rewarded ;)
---
"We all see the same sunset" - S.E Hinton - The Outsiders
---
So...'sup ?
---
It’s what they planned on doing but it’s definitely subject to change
---
And both deserve to be nerfed simply because of how much of a pain they are to go against 4x over.
---
I don't think a lot of Survivors understand; when you run into one killer using Ruin or NoED, you have to deal with that one thing. Yeah sure Ruin slows down gens, but there's still four people who can work on gens.
---
When a Killer is forced to chase a survivor, hit them once with a speed boost, get Dead Harded, hit them again, hook them, and then they're the first person they run into again so you chase after them, get Dead Harded, hit them a third time, get Decisive Striked, chase after them again, get MoMed, it's more than a little tedious when that happens 4x a game.
---
Survivors never get good perks because a good Survivor perk forces the Killer to deal with it 4x, and all these Second Chance perks have made it where the killer needs to catch Survivors 7 times for two hooks instead of four.
---
You know how Survivors roll their eyes and say "Oh, this again" because Hex: Ruin is seen as too prevelent? That's what MoM + DS + Exhaustion + Adrenaline is like for Killer, but we have to deal with it four times rather than just the one totem you guys have to worry about.
---
I know, i couldnt help but laugh at those assholes when they said they would remove safe loops.
---
WAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZAAAAP
---
Perks are toxic for killers to use, didn't you know?
---
Lol “staring at the same survivor game after game” now that I completely understand completely😂. I used to play as one until I’d get killed then switch to the next and cycle through like that.
---
How do I say this... it’s quite crude...
---
When I saw the announcements... I got a boner.
---
When they were mentioning the UI change ingame that displays all players that you have added in one UI, they mentioned what that implies to the game, they were smiling and shit so I smiled. I thought “CROSSPLAY!? SAY IT”, and then they said “you can match up with your friends and requeue in the game now!”, then my heart dropped.
---
I know dude! But most people just ignored that they said to nullify this they will be adding more short loops where both the survior and killer will be tested on their skill and their ability to mind game instead of just going around and around.
---
Fair enough, altough with Freddy I always take survivors complaints with a grain of salt, specially after the one week nerf and even then people kept complaining about him.
---
And killer mains complained about both the nerf and him being weak. so him getting an extra version should not be a problem, just don't choose him.
---
The livestream
---
You start losing points if you stay within terror radius of the hook.
---
Down a survivor that's rescued from the hook (0/50)
---
WAAAAAAAAAAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
On the other side, with killers it makes perfect sense.
---
Well the biggest game right now is successful cus it takes the feedback from its players
---
I knew they were going to keep doing patches, but nothing displayed that they were still planning mid-chapter patches quite to the grandiose of the same ones we had gotten previously. 
---
That's the part I feel wasn't communicated well.
---
*C O C K Z I L L A*
---
Honestly, in this game it depends who you ask. In reality camping is when you guard a hook or gen. Tunneling is when you key-in on a certain player, especially one who was just unhooked. (Btw although people complain both are legitimate strategies and completely within the rules of the game.). 
---
But according to people I’ve played against ‘camping’ has been everything from hiding out by a hook to ambush the rescuer, to literally being chasing another player on the opposite side of the map from the hook I was supposedly camping. And tunneling has usually been thrown around for any chase that someone got salty about.
---
Reasons why Twitch chat is turned off. Last Letter from the Producer of Final Fantasy XIV was filled with nonsense and idiocy. Scum of the Earth.
---
This made me happy
---
It does, cause you cant get Carried by 3 other People doing the work
---
That's true, but Mikey, LF and Fredward all together cost about $15 for just those 3 alone, or $21 for all three of their chapters.
---
Which isn't that bad considering. And even then that's a decent amount of choices to try through and swap up your playstyle, and you still don't even own half of the rest of them.
---
Holy fuck.. This is good
---
New mori is looking...painful...
---
So you decided to steal the movie poster cause that's how good it is this can definitely fool me for a scream poster it's amazing
---
They probably messaged you calling you a camper
---
Mc cote fan base rise up and also
---
Side note I would love to have that skin for Dwight.
---
What is everyone's obsession with the pig?? I dislike going against her and play as her...
---
I liked the new idea but the same assholes kept spamming "nooooo." Looking at them crying was the most satisfying part of the stream.
---
Don't bother. Bots aren't worth saving anyways.
---
no
---
Hello.
---
If you're looking for an honest take on why some people dislike paid battlepasses, then I can share my perspective.
---
People who dislike battlepasses are opposed to them because it creates artificial scarcity on skins and forces you to buy them in packs.
---
Before, if five skins came out together and I really liked one, I could wait for a while to think about it or save up money, then buy that skin when I wanted to use it. I get the content I want, they get my money, everyone is happy. This system gives me wiggle-room as a consumer to make a thought out decision.
---
With a battlepass, I have to decide within a few months, buy the whole set of skins together (I might not even want all of them), then grind out games until I unlock all of the skins. This system preys on people who feel obligated to get skins because "If I don't get it now, I'll never be able to," and can turn the game into a chore.
---
Obviously, I can just choose to not buy it, and I will choose not to buy it, but I would prefer to be able to just buy the skins I want without a time limit.
---
Yeah, I said that without sarcasm.
---
I know haha, some guy got blocked by spamming FUCK YOU BHVR too many times
---
We've yet to have a reason to believe that it has a limited range. But even if it doesn't, that does not make him busted.
---
The better question is can he teleport to completed gens. Most likely not. Which means careful completion of gens will be important. It's already smart to factor for which gens on the map you do. Now even more-so.
---
Meg or Nea. Adrenaline is really good and Balanced Landing is fucking busted.
---
I would agree, but if i start walking towards it and it pops i dont know what you want me to do.
---
Maybe it's just a massage stick
---
Meg
---
WAZZZUUUUUP
---
The reason so many killers immediately go over to check on their totem is because they’ve had multiple matches where the survivors have spawned next to it and it’s been cleansed in the first 30 seconds of the match. You have to flip a coin as to whether you’ll chase the survivors off your totem, or lead them right to it.
---
What do you mean standing in the corner of the map, doing absolutely nothing isn't the smartest play?!
---
I'm lucky if I can even make it to the totem before it's destroyed lol
---
BECAUSE BAD &gt;:(
---
For a momment I tought they were caramel dancing.
---
Literally not at all, its easily one of the best perks imo. Can avoid nurse blinks, spirit, gives you info that youre the one being chased, tells you if theyre trying to juke you, gives you enough boost to open a door in time. Its one of the best information perks in the game
---
imo they should always be opposite sides of the map. that way they can't spawn in the same corner but on two different walls either.
---
I put it down and stand on it while rubbernecking. They usually can't pick it up but they'll see the item prompt. Then I pick it back up.
---
I wonder what the scope is for faking a teleport to a gen to make the survivor run out towards you. Probably need a low terror radius to make it work.
---
His Night Shroud power lasts forever until he’s spotted by a survivor- in which they must look at ghostface for more than 1 second to pull him out of his power, and puts it on cooldown. He can attack freely while stealthed, and crocused. It takes 4 seconds to stalk somebody, and the exposed lasts 20 seconds.
---
They can’t ban them because they can’t prove people are using a third party service. How could they know if you are using the discord app on your cellphone while playing the game or how could they prove that your chat party is talking about the match as opposed to any other subject?
---
Voice chat is still cheating, but it is not something they can actually crack down on.
---
What is happening in there.
---
Uh. aurora borealis.
---
Right I laugh at people who use it. Or if I play with new people they save me and ask if I have selfcare.. who the fuck runs selfishcare now?  Its literal garbage and wasting so much time. Do a gen stupid. Lmao
---
What level of Hell do Quentin mains go to? Asking for a friend..
---
Yeah, mainly because I used a splinter offering to play him, and beat them without a perk.
---
Why the fuck you getting downvoted? Did people forget iridescent perks = more expensive perks?
---
Yea
---
Flop
---
Curious, what game would that be?
---
So Ghostface is allowed to be toxic?
---
You really shouldn’t finish off by insulting someone, It invalidates your opinion and makes you look childish. You can disagree with someone without being disrespectful.
---
chilling... killing..
---
That is actually impressing.
---
Guwop
---
"I actually play as Nea, Too!"
---
They showed him targeting a gen to be able to teleport. He can't teleport as freely as a Nurse but he can still jump between gens easily.
---
Like 5 seconds lul
---
Fortnite
---
But this is video game. Their feeling will get hurt, not their body. These people need to learn go grow up
---
You say that but when BE showed perk usage across all ranks, Self Care was still in top 4 even in red ranks.
---
I would mori myself if I see that
---
Self care isn’t that good anymore?
---
Nah my ps4 is shit, it takes a lot of time to load a profile
---
u/alien_coffee Is this what you asked for?
---
With me I won't go out of my way to make it so the survivors can't 'play the game' but if they're being very annoying (teabagging, pointing etc) then obviously I will try harder but I will never ever facecamp or send hatemail because that's just actually ruining the game for someone.
---
Why
---
LOL. I'm not disappointed
---
Run kindred so the survivors can see the killer if he is camping.
---
Yeah I agree, complainingsomeone is using a green mori while they have a red key is at least somewhat hypocritical.
---
 By the way were you using dying light with the green mori?
---
It’s not as good as it was, but still one of the, if not the, best survivor perk by a good margin. Without it if you are injured and don’t have a medpack you are literally screwed unless you can find a teammate to heal you.
---
Randy would also have been awesome. Now you're making me sad :(
---
Self care isn’t even top 5 right now...
---
You waste so much time.
---
The terror radius is the area in which survivors start to hear that heartbeat effect. It's different between some killers, and some perks can make it larger or smaller. I use a giant terror radius build when I'm using the doctor all the time.
---
I love your comment. Honestly survivors have to learn that everything isn't the killers fault and they themselves need to get better as players and not throw out buzzwords to excuse for their poor play
---
They made it sound like there would be a leaderboard-like system.
---
I assume it will have general ranks but then it will have numbered (#) ranks at the top.
---
I find current Freddy fun. I agree that he'll be op, and he'll nerfed, and maybe hell be bad and unfun, unlike current one
---
ooh nice when’s it gonna be done
---
I wonder why... Lmao
---
I'm surprised they don't have dead hard And adrenaline.
---
True, but the alternative is to rush to a generator while injured and just crank the gen out instead of healing. They're more likely to just hop on a gen rather than look for someone to heal them.
---
It seems like everyone eventually gets that one game where they beeline towards the hex totem as soon as they can move, and it still gets cleansed before you get close. After that it really does seems like it's faster to find a survivor by going to your hex than initially patrolling gens.
---
Obviously it’s a matter of opinion but I’d still confidently put it as number 1. It really doesn’t take long at all so you can’t say it’s wasting so much time. Especially when the alternative is having to run around injured. 
---
What would you say are the top 5
---
More than 3/4 of the time, in my case, the killer gives away the ruin notification. Maybe an SWF is better coordinated, but in solo games, which make up, from what I understand, the majority these days, ruin lasts a lot longer *unless* the killer leads you right to it. 
---
I typically go toward the heartbeat at the beginning of a trial, cause more times than not, I'll find ruin by following the heartbeat.
---
His feet are like tennis courts attached to legs
---
WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPP
---
I'm curious why you think that. Especially when putting it on a spirit, but I don't know maybe I'm not realizing something.
---
Like the exposed status doesn't matter when three tokens are on devour hope, or is it something else?
---
i’m on PC and i can still the 60fps in the corn. i just hate that map because it’s impossible to see and it’s got the cow tree and haymaker loops. however playing hillbilly is *really* fun on that map
---
32 seconds is almost half a generator. So yes, I can say that with confidence. 
---
Without question: D Strike, Balanced, Dead Hard, Mettle, Adrenaline.
---
Heck
---
Although a necessity, that very action unfortunately shows the survivors where the Ruin is.
---
As a survivor, I always run as quick as possible to find the killer and follow him, because I know he'll lead me to the totem.
---
I like jake personally iron will and calm spirit are great
---
Its defeintly long then 5 seconds. I think Tier 1 is like 5, Tier 2 is about 7, and tier 3 is praobly more like 10.
---
F. What ever happened he deleted his profile lmao
---
They need to make it so the gates spawn on opposite sides of the map.
---
Naps By Daylight.
---
Me neither, but for whatever reason, even if it's luck, the one they trap is almost always ruin or devour, lol
---
No real surprises here, just the stuff that had already been leaked, most of which is not exciting. And concerningly little actual gameplay-relevant stuff on the agenda. This has left me disappointed, for the most part.
---
**Game optimization and dedicated servers** - These have long been announced and are something we are still waiting for. No real new information provided on these fronts either. I am anticipating better framerates and hopeful dedicated servers can improve gameplay (primarily due to ridding us of host latency advantage), but it all remains to be seen.
---
**The "Archives"** - The battle pass thing. While I don't too much care for lore in this game, I don't personally mind the concept behind this either, if it's purely cosmetic in its rewards (and has no quasi-P2W cosmetics that allow characters to hide better), but it's definitely a somewhat-concerning step for the game to take; paid game, paid DLC, paid cosmetics, paid battle pass - people like to argue "don't buy it if you don't want it", but if enough other people are buying it, it leads to a game where more and more content is only ever available through microtransactions. A "community" too accepting (buying into) such money-making schemes only feeds into a tendency to make increasingly larger aspects of the game "purchasable", either locked behind hard paywalls, or otherwise "incentivizing" paying money for the content, by psychological or practical means. That said, DbD is notoriously slow in its development, so I don't expect this tendency will take over anytime soon. I do think all these hard or soft paywalls for content will turn potential customers off of the game, and I have read of other battle pass designs that have turned people off of games for other reasons, but I am not all that concerned about this. Although I'm also not particularly excited: the lore in this game has never really fascinated me, "missions" will just replace what we now know as daily rituals, and we have been getting cosmetics anyway.
---
**4 more Chapters** - I'm glad they are keeping to their 3-months schedule, but there are some concerns here. They have now made a point of establishing that "Chapters" can also consist of just a character. And we already know one other of the three remaining Chapters will not feature a map. They have also not spoken nor shown anything pertaining to mid-Chapter patches. There are the two map reworks and the Archive updates, as well as Freddy's rework, but nowhere is it explcitly shown or mentioned that they will be going forward with bigger mid-Chapter patches.
---
**Switch port and Mobile port** - Already announced and leaked, and rather concerning. Not only is this time and resources spent porting and maintaining the game on the platforms it is ported to, rather than spent on improving the game itself, but if they still insist on keeping the game identical on all platforms, that will mean all limitations put on the game design by those platforms will also affect the game on the other platforms. The limited specifications and limited means of input on a mobile device will affect global design decisions, such as the complexity of killer abilities or the viability of a variety of visual or mechanical aspects of the game. For an obvious example, we've known that the Nurse's ability is not well-suited for console play, so this leads to BHVR not designing killer abilities that work in ways similar to that of the Nurse (which, she is certainly an overpowered design that should have long been addressed, but she is also an interesting and unique design, and could be balanced, if BHVR would just... stop for some reason refusing to do so).
---
**Map reworks** - This was one of the few more exciting parts for me, especially the layout variation bit, ...but then all of this is apparently only for 2 maps. Changing 2 maps over the course of a year is just too little, given how rare it is to even get to play on any 2 random maps. Unless the idea to "rework" certain windows and safeness of pallet loops is a global project (and ideally comes with changes to mechanics as well, such as Bloodlust, Entity blocker, Bamboozle, potentially turning problematic windows into wholly new chase elements, such as doors), this is just not really exciting, and it's weird that they would dedicate two more people to the map design dev team (which prior to this was apparently just one guy, ridiculously), yet cut down on new map releases and only plan to rework a mere 2 others.
---
**Freddy rework** - I thought they did a pretty poor job of showcasing this. There was no actual gameplay footage of the two dream abilities, for one thing, and I don't think anybody really understood how the new sleep cycle works. So you don't manually put people to sleep anymore - does that mean they just gradually fall asleep all the time, going through the two(?) phases? Can Freddy see auras at any point anymore? Can you see Freddy's aura at all times (with perks)? Can Freddy hit you at every point? Does being asleep affect survivors in any other way?
---
The dream abilities sound pretty lacklustre. We've seen fake pallets with Doc, and they are not a strong ability. Being able to also change tile appearance to make windows appear blocked or walled-off would be more interesting and new. The traps just sound like worse Clown bottles. You apparently have to spend two seconds placing them, which, if you cannot move during this time, will not be very viable of a chase tool. Again, seeing this in action would have been more telling. From the sounds of things however, I would not say Freddy will be majorly improved this way. Having anything to help his chase is of course better than having nothing, but losing current-Freddy's ease of getting in the first hit and potentially the aura-reading ability in the process kind of makes me think this could end up being a Freddy of similar strength. It also depends on the add-on reworks.
---
The generator teleport ability is the intriguing one. The survivors get an early warning on the teleport, Freddy has to channel the ability, and it goes on a cooldown, but the mobility and potential in-chase utility of this could be the thing that makes Freddy considerably stronger than he is now. Pop Goes The Weasel Freddy might become the new nightmare.
---
Wait with freddy and green he got pissed? He must be great at this game to complain about the weakest killer in the game needing a bit of control
---
Love his kind
---
Me neither. But what I'm getting at is how is a fog observer made? Do they just stay there so long they figure stuff out. When one gets cast out do they replace them immediately or do they wait until someone else figures it out.
---
**Ghostface** - So indeed no map or survivor with this DLC, which is of course disappointing. Then the ability "Night Shroud". While I do enjoy the Evil Within I-type gameplay of finding off-angles and hidden spots to stalk survivors from, and am excited for a more consistent gameplay experience relying on that tactic, the "look at Ghostface for a second to break him out of his ability" mechanic means that Ghostface has no in-chase tools whatsoever. As such, he seems like a worse Myers: Myers with Monitor &amp; Abuse and/or Dead Rabbit can also sneak up on survivors, and with Evil Within III primed, this likewise means instant Exposed status effect, and additionally, a longer lunge range and faster vault speed. I will withhold judgement until I try him out on the PTB, but from the sounds of things, he seems a little mediocre. Spine Chill is also a real concern, and similarly to Myers' EWI, should not apply to Ghostface in stalk mode. I also wonder whether a survivor cannot simply keep rotating their camera at 1-second intervals, in order to altogether prevent Ghostface from stalking them. This will largely depend on the angular cutout of the survivor's Field-of-Vision that Ghostface has to be within, for the "break out of stalk" mechanic to apply.
---
Ghostface's perks are rather awful, which does not surprise but still disappoint me. **"I'm All Ears"** is a meme-tier perk similar to Iron Maiden, with only very niche and rather gimmicky utility. Survivors do not regularly perform rushed actions outside of your terror radius, and even if they did, you already get a notification for that, the aura is not really valuable there. The only real utility it could potentially have is on killers and with perk/add-on combinations that yield very low terror radii, such that the aura-reading can potentially be beneficial mid-chase. But then it is also on a completely unnecessary cooldown, which renders it useless given that even in those cases where you can get in-chase aura-reading, the value of those reads is not consistent, all the more so because it happens after rushed actions, which usually already give away what the survivor is and likely can then be doing anyway. So yeah, awful perk. Especially ridiculous that Ghostface himself cannot really profit from it, since he will most likely as good as never be able to remove his terror radius in a chase. **"Thrilling Tremors"** is more interesting than the first perk, but still just a low-value effect. Blocking generators that are not being worked on (and only for 16 seconds) obviously means that the perk's stalling capabilties are nigh non-existent. So that leaves us with with the aura reading part, telling the killer which gens are currently being worked on. As opposed to seemingly many players on this subreddit (given the high opinions they have of Discordance and Surveillance), I do not consider this information to be very valuable. You cannot defend generators without slowly but surely losing the game, if you are not playing for a gen cluster of 3 dedicated generators (in which case you don't need to know which are being worked on anyway, you just patrol them), but rather, you have to commit to singular survivors and down them, to actually progress your objective. For which you merely need to identify the position of any 1 survivor. Barbecue &amp; Chili and Whispers are already sufficiently well-suited to identify as much, including generators that are being worked on, and they also have utility that goes well beyond that. Tremors could be nice with Pop Goes The Weasel, but then that's already two precious killer perk slots gone, and I really don't think they can best the popular BBQ + Ruin duo. More like a "fun", gimmicky off-meta equivalent of them. **"Furtive Chase"** reduces your terror radius by up to 16 meter in a chase, but I fail to see the impact of this, as survivors can either see you or still have a 8-16 meter range within which they can use your terror radius intensity to gauge your movements. It could be nice for Freddy, but he will most likely not keep his aura-reading abilities; it can kind of combo with "I'm All Ears", but that's underwhelming for the reasons mentioned, and even on low terror radius killers, would still give the survivor at least 8 meters; it might be cool on Myers, since it can completely remove his terror radius in chases, making it harder for survivors to gauge his movement when Line-of-Sight is broken, but even then I still can't see how it would be very impactful, especially considering that first you have to have gotten 4 hooks on Obsession survivors.
---
**Rank rework** - They haven't really given details about the things they are aiming for here. The only rank (and according matchmaking) changes I would be excited about are having ranks correlate more with actual kill and survival rate of players, as well as a preferential pairing of players with more-similar hours played, on a best-possible-match basis. The other thing would be rank rewards, but not holding my breath on that either. They also didn't say anything about player level/Devotion becoming more than a "you have played this game" counter.
---
They do talk of "gameplay balancing" as something that will happen throughout the year, but with how little in regards to that has been happening in recent months, as well as the lack of a mention of mid-Chapter updates dedicated to balance, I am doubtful much of the base gameplay experience will be refreshed. A central aspect for me in this regard are the perks - a major perk overhaul is something that would be great for the game, changing how the game is and can be played on a global and meta basis. So many perks in this game range from basically useless to mediocre, and the pool of those viable and impactful enough to become staples consists of around 10+/- perks, respectively, most of them having been around for years. That makes for a stale and repetitive perk landscape and - insofar it affects it - gameplay. Breathing life into that big pile of subpar perks would likewise blow fresh wind into the game, create exciting and interesting new builds, combos, interactions, and meta-reactions to them.
---
Downvote me if you wish
---
But I use a macro for struggling since my keyboard is SUPER LOUD and I usually play next to my sleeping parents, and in 300 hours of using it I’ve never got banned. I used my Alienware macro first but I changed it to razer synapse
---
Ik it won't happen but i can still hope right? (I was refering to og Nancy)
---
Why would I downvote you? An long as you answer me ur good lol
---
That means their last perk will probably be BBQ. 
---
No whispers, no Enduring/Spirit Fury, No Nurses, No Sloppy, No M&amp;A. 
---
I’m fine with it.
---
Haven’t played in a long time. Are they going to stop supporting it?
---
I dont think so. Myers still has the passive immunity to dection, a smaller terror radius all the time without anything to do, and a faster vault. 
---
He also has a much more powerful instadown with a longer ranged lunge as well. 
---
Ghostface on the other hand can only expose one person at a time, so he will be much weaker in that aspect. Not to mention his TR power ends if someone just looks at him.
---
Not talking about you ;)
---
Probably just me but the eyes and mouth look humorously phallic.
---
I would recommend running Haunted Ground with Ruin to trick survivors.
---
Nice to see they invited Hideo Kojima
---
If you turn this into a prop or a 3D print file, I need it!! I would cry to have a actual bing bong prop
---
At this time of day?
---
When I get off from work, I'll screen cap a few of my favorite builds for ya!
---
cringy
---
Bob did you even read your own post? You’re the one who brought up characters and how “having them doesn’t matter” and I responded on how thats an invalid point. Which you have immediately caved to and tried to pad out with “Thats not that bad”
---
Its not wrong for a company to make money but it is wrong for a game to exploit its player base. A battle pass isn’t the scummiest thing they could do by a longshot and it would be fine in a free to play game, but again, this game already costs $20, charges $10 per quarterly DLC, and the cosmetics shop is fairly expensive and charges you an in-game currency to use.
---
Your defense is “Yeah, but they need more ways to charge us money to pay for the things they already charge us money for which have obviously paid for themselves by charging us money for them because thats how goods and services work”. 
---
Like are you thick in the head?
---
^^^^^
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPP
---
What's your favorite scary movie?
---
I’m not trolling. I’m by no means an inexperienced player but I do main killer and still have a hard time hitting rank 1 as survivor to be completely honest. I hope I didn’t waste my time replying but was hoping that since you seemed so confident about your argument you would at least be able to explain your reasoning.
---
I still poop myself a bit every time I turn around and there's a Myers close by.
---
If the survivor is sitting in one place self caring through sloppy butcher they might as well not be in the match.
---
I am always happy to see self-care on the enemy team, it has won me a ton of killer games. People waste a ton of time.
---
I mean, i think having more loops that are less powierful is better. There are plenty of times where your stuck with no pallets or window vaults and that really really sucks when it happens. 
---
Bloodlusting is already a pretty pointless mechincac in my mind, espcally since its buggy and doesnt work half the time.
---
Put skillcheck button on mouse. Itch with hand on keyboard. Success.
---
Wow Self Care, you can heal yourself who cares
---
Im offended at how low Jake is, his noises are gr8
---
Lol really?
---
I feel like I am the mean one now lol
---
Where did you get the extended version of the meme?
---
The problem is when you put it on someone like Nurse or Billy. That 16 seconds is a long time for them. If they don't see a Generator go white, they'll be on top of the survivor incredibly fast. If they see all generators go white, they have 16 seconds of flying around the map to find people without punishment.
---
It might be meant to find Survivors, but it's a better BBQ and Chili; not only does it tell you where the Survivors are, but if they do the equivalent of hiding in a locker (jumping off the gen) it actively slows the game down.
---
No, exhaustion recovery while in a chase is fucking cancer and must never come back
---
But its also always going on and passive without anything from Freddy so that might be too powerful base line. 
---
I do think being in the dream world will do something though
---
Every time I’m using we’ll make it and someone sprints off I’m chasing after them like 
---
“LET ME HEAL YOU GOD DAMMIT!”
---
1. you will die and become irrelevant, does that mean you should be fine with that one cosmetic you want being bundled into a more expensive and time consuming bundle?
---
2. you didn't actually say why it's not encouraging addiction, you just ranted
---
3. you seem to be erring on the side of buyer beware, why should I want consumer unfriendly practices in a game I like just because I can say no? Do we have a proper overview of the battlepass yet to show that it's possible to come close to finishing it without paying? I doubt it because hallowed blight was such a grind fest that no-one but children had time for it simply encouraged paying after first making you want the pretty pixels by pretending you could grind it out
---
This is a virtual forum in a virtual land that hold no actual value in your life. Do you see how silly that argument is?
---
I never said anything about self care but go off
---
It really isn't worth the time investment. You waste too much time doing it.
---
Oh shit, what type of rewards?
---
Sitting on a generator near a wall, physically impossible to watch more than one angle, Spine Chill is literally like having eyes all over the place. Not to mention, I can't tell you the amount of times that the action speed boost has helped me finish a gen while the killer was coming
---
I won't buy it, because like you said "don't like don't buy it".
---
But that doesn't address my question. The developers look to be adding more monetization schemes to the game, potentially scaring off old and new players.
---
It's starting to get on the level of black ops 4 monetization except for the lootboxes... But you never know, they might even do that in the future, for the players
---
Tru tru
---
Yeah and they took the feedback from the people before they would get rekt and implemented the strong points from apex
---
We want respawns
---
We want mobility
---
We want to ping items
---
And so fortnite copied it all. Thanks to that they are winning.
---
The Gen one is quite good, it shows you who is working on gens and where they are, and slows the game down a bit. 
---
Also the TR Aura reading can be really good on killers with small/no Terrior Radius.
---
As someone already pointed out, you can make a straw man about any perk and make it sound irrelevant.
---
You made this... I made this. *reposts*
---
EA can't hear you through the wall of money they've built between themselves and their playerbase
---
YO PICK UP THE PHONE!
---
I've had time when someone runs we'll make it and THEY run away instead of healing
---
Who does nothing all match? People want points/pips/fun.
---
If they did nothing all game then it means the killer lost a 3v1, with the key guy being a gigantic sandbag.
---
Its an entirely free system that gives you FREE stuff that you just work towards. 
---
Gameing Addiction is a person problem..if someone can't control their habits thats a complety different problem. 
---
The advantge is has is that its Free.
---
saving this for a week from now when my friend will understand the meme
---
I love this show.
---
I got downvoted to oblivion last time I said the battle pass will be cool the last time on this sub. 🤷‍♀️
---
How much does a Killer need to be able to slow the game down before the game slows down too much though?
---
Say they add in a perk that blocks off a generator after you kick it for 30 seconds. That sounds fairly reasonable, right?
---
Now half the gens are blocked right off the bat, the remaining gens are blocked whenever Billy picks someone up, and then after the Survivor runs away from the Gen because Billy is sawing his way to it, Billy kicks the gen and blocks that one off too.
---
We're talking about slowing the game down to a snails pace instead of just giving the killer time to work.
---
I mean purposely losing the game is toxic yes, I’m saying that people who run the killer and teabag while he chases, that’s not that bad, but yea I agree that losing the game or refusing to help is toxic
---
There is no problem because if people acuallty payed attetion, they said it was going to be FREE. Meaning you wont have to pay money to get FREE comesmetic items that you dont pay for. 
---
How is that bad...?
---
Bye 😂💀
---
Since the survivors disappear when they die, where the fuck do the skulls come from?  
---
Are they just a simulacrum by the entity? So in the end it's just really good halloween decorations...
---
Yeah but self care is actually a perk literally used by EVERYONE
---
The thing is two of those are kind of fun while one is just bullshit and takes no skill, screw people who use them its like pre nerf iri heads on huntress.
---
But see, your saying its going to slow the game down to much, but its bascally just a worse BBQ and Chil depending on the range and cooldown. 
---
16 seconds isnt going to slow the game down worth shit.
---
no, it's the stereotype. if a Spirit has a hex totems and it's not Ruin, they think it's 100% Haunted Grounds (while it's actually Devour) and try to ignore at all cost and they won't realize it's Devour until you get 3 tokens which they'll do anything to cleanse the totem, making it easier for Spirit to kill them
---
Im still not sure how u can justify waisting that much time while the killer is chasing someone else. There isnalot of times where u can pop the last gen and have adrenaline save the survivor getting chased. Selfcare is good when u r new to the game, but one u know the maps and what gens r safe to do injured, then selfcare becomes alot worse. I used it my first 400hours roughly, and ever sense i stopped, i havnt put it on again for the next 1k hours ive played. Perk just really isnt as good as other perks that dont as much time
---
Moris do need nerfs/changes, yeah.
---
Where is the not_queen love?
---
your mom looks like a fatter Clown
---
The 4th unseen panel is when you trigger a gag trap where a hag trap has no right being.
---
Cuties.
---
Yeah, I think the most 'toxic' behavior in all of DBD comes in the post-game chat.
---
Why the fuck do we need to know you made an edit to your post just for it to be a typo. You are what's wrong with reddit.
---
I'd pass personally. What makes the perks fun is that you can use them on any character so it would annoy me if say Nurse got an exclusive perk that would be extremely useful on one of the lower tier killers for example.
---
This is actually pretty good
---
I hope it's one of those injured-leave vacations and not one of those bullshit 3 day weekends.
---
Tbh, I think he's not going to be as strong as everyone are expecting him to be, now he has a lot less end game potential now that there's mirrors all over the place, which means survivors can still wake up even if you put all 4 of them to sleep when all the gens have been powered, and his ability to teleport to generators will most likely work only as long as the generator is still incomplete, he can still be looped into oblivion like any other M1 killer, and his traps are bootleg trappers, and devs themselves said they're not sure if the want to make the traps part of his base ability, or make it an addon that removes the teleport ability, the latest if most likely going to happen, and BHVR loves to make killers addon dependent, example - addon less Trapper with 1 trap.
---
sHrouD oF SepaRAtIon
---
Also, I usually play solo. I’d imagine it would be less crucial if I had teammates I could reliably find to heal me if need be.
---
I get that. I was just thinking they would most likely have to waste time on one of the hex haunted ground perks before they can figure out which is the devour totem.
---
Hopefully that give you enough time to get a down and a mori. But it would cost another perk.
---
Although maybe the best choice for spirit would be hex: devour hope and hex: thrill of the hunt since there would be two totem. The only downside is that If they start cleansing they will probably think that you are up to something knowing that they are cursed.
---
But alternatively they could think you are using that to find them to insta down them when they break the totem.
---
The one survivor I really wanted. This phantom pain still lingers, why are we here, just to suffer?
---
You just uwu'd her face
---
My God, what have you done?!
---
Self care doesn't really waste time, unless you can find someone within 12 seconds, SC would have been faster.  
---
Borrowed can be used in conjunction with MoM to potentially unhook right in front of the killer and make him need 3 hits to down you.  
---
Take this best/worst case scenario:  
---
Killer hooks Meg, Ace has MoM ready and unhooks right in front of the killer. Killer hits ace because Meg has iframes. Ace gets injured. If the killer goes after Ace he still needs to hit him twice, if he then hits Meg, BT pops up and she runs away, then HER MoM is ready and will need 2 hits to down.  
---
The survivors are free to do w/e they want right in front of the killer, and the killer is 100% powerless to stop it unless they are a few select killers that can 1 shot, and even then it might not help.  
---
It feels like being held down and beat up while you can't fight back.
---
Sketch him with his bloody clothing items
---
WAAAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUP😝
---
"Pull them in right beside you" And... then you wait 7 seconds. While they run all the way to whatever pallet or window they can reach. Simply put, hes just an m1 killer but worse. yes you can mindgame, but its just... not enough. Its not spirit level.
---
Its yellow tho
---
I play solo at rank 1. It really isnt that bad as long as u dont over stay on gens, and u find the closest loops and check them for pallets
---
I meant after the stun is over
---
16 seconds every time/every other time you pick up a Survivor is, though. Assuming competent survivors (which is where stalling the game would be most relevant), being able to pick up Survivors bare minimum of 12 times blocks off the generators for 3 minutes of game time, and that's not including flashlight saves, pallet saves, or any other reason a Killer has to have to pick up a survivor multiple times.
---
Keep in mind that's time blocked off from doing gens. Hex Ruin at least allows you to complete a Gen in 80 seconds if you hit your skillchecks, this just completely blocks it off no progress.
---
It won’t work. For example, being immune to crows circling around you is much weaker than wiggling faster. You’d see nothing but Kate’s running around.
---
What does paying for tiers matter? It, is, still, free. You still get the stuff without having to pay? 
---
And the system we have now isnt going to change..you can still buy what you want...so its just extra. 
---
Thats not my fault that people have gambling issues and feel like its a problem when its not. Its the persons fault not the game. If they cant control urges they need to get help.
---
Yeah, I agree, Spirit is better. I like to walk in circles around the survs as soon as I pull them in to confuse them honestly, and try to predict movement based on what's nearby.
---
My friend calls it "The Golden Broccoli" and he laughed really hard when I bought the headpiece. :P Will take me a while to get the rest 14k shards.
---
Unless you can find a survivor within 12 seconds(16 with sloppy) and have them heal you, you wasted more time than just using SC. Add in the extra gen speed if you have a toolbox, and you end up saving a ton of time in the long run.
---
Yes, and if your on a gen when it triggers, that gen wont be affected, then you can do do other things since it wont do it. 
---
The entire point of ruin is do slow the game down, and Ruin kinda always gets removed withen the first 30 seconds of a game anyway so that wont matter. 
---
Killers NEED to slow the game down to function and be effective. If they cant slow the game down and get map control, gens get done faster then the killer can stop it.
---

Up until recently I used to trash on Quentin frequently but after buying him I have opened my eyes and I saw a cutie
---
Personally I dont like it. While I think it might be cool to see survivors have unique passives depending who you are playing. Forcing certain perks on both of survivors and killers would make them have to stick with a certain type of build.
---
Theres too many ways to wake up from freddy though, so there is no pressure. Once put to sleep, if he's not coming after you, you can just mozy on over to a gen and wake up. Or selfcare. Or sabo. It doesn't apply pressure because the moment you're not being chased in the dream, its just easy to wake up and go about your business, and he has to wait another 7 seconds before he can hit you again.
---
League has been around for almost a decade now, and a big part of why is that they take feedback from their players. The community likes to meme Riot a lot, but after playing Blizzard, EA, Treyarche, and more it makes me appreciate how Riot actually gives a shit.
---
HWID banned?
---
Same kappa
---
...what. ITS OPTIONAL, you dont need to buy cosmetics, COSMETICS. They are optional for god's sake, how is it gouging if it isnt required?
---
nope
---
The point of Exhaustion is to give you a bit of power and then force you to stand still in order to recover it. This translates into evading the killer, then stopping at a Gen/Totem/what have you to cleanse it in order to get the Exhaustion perk back.
---
There's only 2 leveling ups. 1-&gt;2 ; 2-&gt;3
---
If the surv are potatos rip your pips, or if you play scummy rip your pips
---
Cool
---
So what then? Zero in gen protection means gens went incrdibly quick, silver in sacriifcie suggests one hooks.
---
Huntress better
---
Not when you have ruin+bbq+Spirit fury+enduring lol
---
Gross.
---
Oh, badass I didn't know you were on reddit. I found you randomly on YouTube and have been really enjoying your guides.
---
But I've been wondering. Once you cover every killer what will you do?
---
Anyway I hope your channel grows since you put a lot of work into your videos.
---
If they know to hop off gens, they're just blocked for 16 seconds, which is usually longer than it takes for the hook to go up. Not to mention that they'll likely be aware of it for the second down onwards, and know to just hop off and hide near their gen for a few seconds.
---
First off, if you disconnect your internet you don't receive a penalty, they need to fix this. 
---
Secondly, if you DC x amount of times in a row you should receive a cool down and massive rank adjustment.
---
its a possibility but as of now I don't want to oversaturate the theme with icons on everything. If I get a good idea on what to do for the powers i'll probably work on them.
---
The NOED was his safety net in case he didn't get to tier 3
---
Thanks for making an argument that explains why you think that.
---
And that wont work because your using 3 other perks.
---
Not really, if you have several unsafe weak pallets, the killer doesn't need to kick any of them. You can easily get a hit around those pallets, in many situations it's better to leave them up so that you can have a survivor trapped around them.
---
Safe pallets are much more valuable, because the killer is forced to kick them if they want to get a hit. This breaks bloodlust + gives you a lot of distance.
---
Mouse and keyboard for killer and controller for survivor is what I use. Only issue is when people run to pallets to heal, you gotta aim it a very particular way to not accidentally throw the pallet.
---
Like I said, that happens. The totem spawns are random; but that's not often, at least in the survivor games I play. I'll work through all the generators, hitting ruin skillchecks while the rest of my team, at red ranks, is searching for ruin.
---
We must never return to that Hell.
---
Tbf, I do think most, if not all, ultra rares  need to go.. On both sides.
---
But, I saw in another comment that it was an ivory. That survivor is just a dick lol
---
That and I think that the blood spurting teleporting animation will not be instant like the Hag which will give the survivors time to take off.
---
A generator is blocked off for 16 seconds every time a killer picks up a survivor or interrupts a survivor. 
---
It doesn’t seem like that great of a perk to me, at least in relation to slowing the game down. How often does a killer really interrupt a survivor or pick up a survivor? Not too often for 16 seconds to make much of an impact IMO. If anything it will be good to sort of pinpoint where survivors are.
---
Agreed. BHVR has come a long way over the last year with how they handle the community and DBD development as a whole. I remember the dark days of their apathetic attitude, the Freddy nerf, and patch 1.9.2. Since then they have completely changed how they approach improving this game and interacting with the community. Its awesome to see how DBD his evolved along with its developers. I love this game!
---
What 3 other perks? Bbq and ruin and then what?
---
They makes sense. When you put it that way, it's very true that technically he has a need that no other characters do: put them in the dream.
---
I just noticed the power icon sticking out alongside the aesthetic addons when in game. It's no rush, just a suggestion
---
As a killer main I agree with this
---
Exactly what I do
---
You just want a free escape card for the next time you get grabbed. I highly doubt the Killer was "tunneling" you as you perceived it, and you're just whining because you got hooked again.
---
Please do another one for razor blade ASMR
---
Oh wait this the wrong post...someone was saying how using the new Ghostface perk where it blocks gens when using it with ruin and Corrupt invertion is op.
---
I’m not that artistic either, I just like making a huge mess xD
---
I rarely run Moris, but I run a Shroud 8/10 games.
---
Is there a file of this I can 3d print somewhere? This is sick!
---
Hey, franklins is great for bubba's basement and flashlights. I once made a kid rafe in bubbas basement and report me bc i used franklins without even knowing he had a dull key with weaved ring and he died on hook
---
Yeah but this is like the 4th rank rework that I've seen come and go and every one so far has been clueless and ineffective
---
Ash's other perks were shit, didn't stop MoM from being one of the most annoying perks released in months.
---
You don't need Enduring + Spirit Fury for pallets if the game lasts long enough that there are no pallets. Nurse doesn't need those perks anyway. You don't need Bamboozle if you know you can stall out until there are no pallets (since most killer builds either run Bamboozle or Enduring + SF). Again, Nurse doesn't need that perk anyway.
---
You could have made D tier W tier but you didn’t.
---
And the new tier: Generator stats bleeding.
---
Where did i write about my own tunnel experiences? This ds idea just came into my own head after i read a thread about MoM and how its gonna be as useless as DS after its rework lmao.
---
You just seem like a salty killer tbh lol.
---
*gen has period
---
&gt; Doesn't Hag come with the base game? Or is her and Doc still considered DLC?
---
I think on console she does but not on PC. Theres a couple killers and survivors you get on console but not PC, and on PC we get bill but console doesn't get him.
---
How tf is that gatekeeping
---
Nurse doesnt need any perk to be useful, stop using nurse as an example everyone knows thats dumb to do. 
---
So you get vaulted, looped, and palleted and for what, smalling the game down a small bit? Those perks wont be nearly as powerful as you think.
---
Yeah it's wierd not a lot of people give attention to balanced landing. Probably because it's not good on certain maps but if you use an offering especially to haddonfield that perk becomes maybe on of the strongest in the game.
---
SC takes 32 seconds, or 38.4 seconds with sloppy butcher. If you can find a survivor within *16* seconds, you won’t waste time. It’s generally better to tough it out and work on a gen since allies will usually come to a gen if they see you anyways. Use bond or aftercare to see everyone.
---
60s into a match
---
Any map with excessive LoS blockage is bad for Killers.
---
It makes it easier to rescue someone.
---
Billy ain't fun
---
Had a game as killer yesterday where someone popped a hatch when I was passing by it, when the survs only had one gen left, and three of them were alive. I slammed the hatch, started EGC, and was able to hook the other two left behind. It should've been an easy sweep for them to get out, if that one person had just held on a few seconds more.
---
New mori for killers, when you face a 4 man running mom, go to the basnemnt and hook yourself
---
Freddy is anchor arms buff now
---
F
---
Fred boi is having a rework? I think I should start playing again.
---
Because most people don’t understand that developers need to make money to continue development. They think that: oh well they sold 1M units at 20$ a pop, 20M is surely enough to last them forever, it sure would me.
---
And think that all future development is made by people who love the game enough to do so without pay and have an alternative source of income.
---
“Because CoD makes new copies every year! If they wanted to make money they should just make another DBD!”
---
You should have gotten a gold in devout, since you got 4 kills, so it must be some sort of bug.
---
&gt; Even after the nerf it’s still arguably the best survivor perk.
---
please stop spreading lies like this. just fucking take iron will and do the fucking gens and stop wasting time healing. 
---
Self care is 32 seconds, 40 with sloppy butcher. that's half a gen. 
---
that teammate that's been running the killer for 5 minutes and already used his DS and deadhard? your self care just made it so he doesn't get adrenaline. 
---
do the fucking gens.
---
We all hate it too tho
---
And you're supposed to be what's right with Reddit with your comment?
---
This isn't a bad idea, but honestly nurse isn't getting changes any time soon, and probably not ever. Yes she is overpowered, but the community doesn't hate her with the same righteous fury that legion got, and most killers that got a heavy rework are DLC killers (technically trapper and wraith got some changes, but didn't really amount to much).
---
Hmm, can’t say I’m fully aware of the games pricing throughout its history. 
---
Presumably they would be compensated with Auric Cells depending on the time difference between the price changes.
---
If they paid $70 for it, and BHVR reduced the price 1 year later, there doesn’t need to be that much compensation, asides from maybe an “Early Adopter” cosmetic.
---
Edge-cases such as purchasing a month or so prior to the announcement of the price change would need to be brought up with support, and would likely be Auric Cells equivalent to the difference.
---
Ikr his groan pains especially are so sad
---
if you go down immediately as soon as the killer shows up self care isn't going to do anything for you anyway. might as well just run to the hook.
---
Should've put hag
---
I’m a Nea that’s not even funny cuz I 4K everyone including the killer
---
I’d say nearly all survivors would not be happy about a change since looping is one of their only forms of survival at this point. 
---
I still think it’s unneeded to put “toxic” in the title since putting it there implies a toxicity with looping.
---
Hurdur reference from superhero movie
---
How about not comparing Cote to someone who disrespects his player base and links animal abuse videos to the public.
---
Oh no! You beat every aspect of his argument!
---
That would be cool
---
Gens got smashed by a rank 8 and their buddies, and you relied on a 1-hit perk for the end game. I assume that the last person got slugged and bled out, too. So, you got a Silver in Devout for only killing 3/4 people, you didn't get very many hits or hooks to get Malicious past Silver...
---
wtf are you talking about, "character assassination?" The worst thing people are saying here is after watching him for a while they don't like him anymore. No one is making shit up, they're just expressing their opinions.
---
Then what would be the point of pips? If you wanted to you could get pips from hiding on hatch till the last guy died if that happened
---
no way it will be buyable without money, this is bhe we are talking about. just like pubg, their battlepay is not earnable. But if it's a 10 dollar pass and have a lot of cool skins people will probably buy it, because it's cheaper than getting 10 dollar skins. I don't know how will bhe strike balance here for themselves in the long run.
---
Truth be told that's the only one that scared me. XD
---
Yeah same here
---
Crouching Pig, Hidden Radius.
---
Jesus I never knew people would get so defensive..
---
I made a post with that suggestion, got downvoted as hell.
---
MoM reveals your aura permanently until you're downed again. There's no time limit on the effect. If an aura is showing and disappearing again without anything triggering it, it's because someone is using OoO.
---
Myers can't even max deviousness if he stalks every last drop of stalker juice out of all four survivors. Doctor almost hits max deviousness within 2 minutes of the round starting.
---
What does prayer beads do?
---
We have so many of them now, we need to break them up into ultra rares
---
Removes the spirit's vacuum sound when she's phasing
---
It’s an opinion not a lie. And healing is not a waste of time. While, yeah it may not end well for my teammate getting chased, it may make the difference of whether or not I make it out.
---
Personally I think it's a great perk but I wish it wasn't so strong against invisible/ stealth killers. 
---
Wraith already is pretty bad so this just hurts him too much for no reason.
---
Pig is decent but still has trouble. Again I think this  too powerful against her since it negates one of her core strengths.
---
As for spirit. I think she is actually a great killer and if played well can be top 5 but spine chill makes the invisibility way less. 
---
Honestly if they made it so it can't detect invisible/ stealth killers I still think it would be a great perk. Hell maybe even give it a little bit of a buff. I just dont like the certain killers idea certain killers lose a large aspect of their power at no cost for the survivor other than taking the perk. 
---
But idk maybe I'm completely wrong. I'd like to know what you think.
---
Oh god
---
Oh right, the healing time change, I forgot. The rest isn't all that true though.  
---
You think that if you take exactly 16 seconds to find someone to heal you, you SHOULD come up even right?  
---
But you don't. I mean YOU do, but that takes 16 seconds of both you and the other survivor to heal you. That means the total time wasted was 16+32.  
---
And if you don't heal right away and the killer find you, are screwed, on the hook you go, wasting even more time, since every second on the hook is wasted PLUS every second of every survivor coming to rescue you.  
---
Not to forget that you can be much stealthier and mobile when healing with SC than with 2 people, you can heal somewhere, move a bit to avoid the killer and heal some more, something much harder to do with 2 people.  
---
Also, people will be much more timid when they are injured, potentially leading them to crouching everywhere, hiding as soon as they hear a HB, wasting even more time total.  
---
SC WOULD be the decent but not OP perk if it was less than 50%, like even just 40% healing speed would make it so that it's better time wise to find a buddy to heal you at a gen. Other than that you and up, at BEST at equal time lost, and at worst back on the hook in 1 hit.
---
I mean, I suppose if you are a super conservative religious person that might be scarier than anything else in the game...
---
Have the devs said it's cheating?
---
True that, I still have yet to see anything pay2win, the "best" cosmetics to hide with are generally the brown ones anyways
---
Then how do you evade when Wraith pulls up and downs you quick. Or Billy comes running towards you and no pallets around? at least make the chase a lot longer by taking a hit somehow.
---
and if you buy the base game u need like 40-50 hours just to get the claudette (maybe dwight's bond instead of claudette's self care) and meg's adro, so you can start leveling nea after that and get a decent build. The entry in time is horrible also, so much grind in a game you paid for.
---
As I can see noed is like the auto in csgo
---
Toy story
---
&gt; But aren't DLCs and cosmetics one time purchases?
---
Yes, but more get released over time, as it stands Behavior likely has a rough estimate of how much money each quarterly DLC will bring in and can plan around that. Like I said, paid cosmetics are a bonus on top of that.
---
&gt; And what if a DLC doesn't appeal to a part of the player base... Is that the sign of a bad company or a company that needs to sustain their current client base when DLCs or cosmetics don't appeal to a group
---
If a DLC doesn't appeal to the majority of the player base (and as such vastly under-performs) then Behavior has failed to make money by selling content that interests the player base which I would consider a failure on the part of the company.
---
For reference: A battlepass would *also* be a "one-time purchase", like the DLC a new one would be released every quarter but unlike the DLC you'll have to work to receive your content and you'll only have a limited time to do so.
---
Can I have that
---
“If you don’t like it don’t buy it” didn’t really work out for EA either.
---
Playing trapper isn't fun because you need to beg the entity to make people run through your traps
---
I'd agree with you but I play killer. A 3k can barely be a black pip if it happens too fast. Literally being punished for efficiency.
---
So until they fix that, survivors should have to do gens to pip.
---
Bröther the toxicity is absolutely bonkers towards killers in the higher ranks, but you can punish it if you get good with the right killers. (Billy, Nurse, or Spirit) or you can just play to have fun and senselessly slaughter poor souls with killers like Pig, Michael, and Wraith. The DLCS aren’t all about the perks. You can buy them for their powers. The ranking system is being made more efficient, so no worries, it can’t be any worse for you than it is for seasoned players
---
To be honest I do not think this is as big of an issue as it seems.
---
The dream pallets only effect survivors in the dream world which takes 60 seconds (Could change) to occur to a survivor. Freddy cannot accelerate this meaning survivors who fail a skill check or use the dream clock thing will have 60 seconds where his power does not impact them.
---
The Dream snare I imagine is very similar where it only affects asleep survivors. Normal survivors have nothing to worry about.
---
The teleport has a cooldown meaning he cannot abuse it to cover multiple gens really quickly. It gives him amazing map pressure and can interrupt gen progression but in a 3 gen strat, the gens are so close that the teleportation doesn't really matter unless Freddy decides to chase a survivor away from the gens.
---
WHAIT FOR THE WAZZUUUUUP
---
they have a track record of only caring about the money. just the recent excample: infinite loading screens for half a year.
---
Correct, They are free cause they can be bought wiht shards. And we dont know that it will have exlusive items. Where did you see this, because they never said that. They never said they wont bring the items back and why does it matter if its exclusive anyway, every game has excsuive items. 
---
And again, its NOT a problem. People are the ones who claim its all bad when its not. Its a live service model game, they are in the norm to pay for comestics they need to make money.
---
I take it a Freddy main made this. No matter what Nurse will still be the best killer in the game. I prefer hillbilly and huntress but the last box didn’t at all make him sound better then nurse
---
We complain
---
We bully
---
We be toxic
---
We whinge
---
We whine
---
But most importantly
---
We appreciate the devs for giving us a game so flawed yet perfect
---
Wow I never thought of this strategy. Will try with my P3 Claudy group.
---
Exactly!
---
Just that ranking will be reworked in it's entirety and if you watch it on YouTube it's around 1:02:45
---
You want to have 6 second chances, don't be surprised when someone wants to take them away from you.
---
That's a total babe though, so it's okay to uwu them. 
---
But Hag on the other hand eats babes for a living.
---
WAZZUUUUUP
---
I'll be honest, I've been thinking recently that it would be nice if they would introduce power variants for some killers. Basically, allow them to choose between maybe two or three different baselines for their powers that change how they work.
---
Myers would be really easy to show this off. Allow him to choose scratched mirror/vanity/tuft of hair as variants on his baseline power, just at lower power than the add-on boosted ones. Say, scratched mirror only lets you see auras withing 8m or 16m, and the tuft of hair requires you to fully drain 3/4 survivors of evil before it goes off.
---
I think it'd do a lot to add variance within individual matches, since you wouldn't necessarily know what a killer can do just by seeing them, and it wouldn't be quite as oppressive as having to spend BP every since time you want to change a killer's set at all. This would also allow BHVR to add further customization to their killers in the future, instead of having to go all the way in adding completely new characters for minor changes.
---
The combination of both but mainly his rudeness
---
So many noob3 messages
---
Self-care literally prevents that unless it’s an insta-down like the chainsaw. If you healed then you won’t even be at risk of getting dropped by one regular hit.
---
the other way around would have been funny too
---
I do agree that Trapper is bad, but my point stands. 
---
Freddy has to wait 7 seconds to even HIT a survivor, at least Trapper and Nurse can still hit people normally without their powers. Freddy cant. Freddies power doesnt even give him much in return.
---
Definitely awake, he can’t use snares/fake pallets against awake survivors.
---
OHHH SHIT NOICE!!!
---
it’s a known issue for sure https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/bug-reports
---
unsure what the dev progress is on fixing this issue for players
---
I've seen this happen too, glad to know I'm not just going crazy.  
---
..I really hope it's a bug.
---
Get out of the locker damn dwight , I'm bringing iron maiden .
---
I still can't get over that nerf. I see where you are coming from though.
---
Clothes : EXIST
---
DBD Community ; IS THIS A NEW COSMETIC?
---
This. The devs don't mind but they have no control over EAC or w/e checks the files.
---
I wouldn't worry about downvotes from people here, a good chunk of the subreddit is pretty illogical.
---
They hated me for I spoke the truth
---
OMG flying killer. I need it. That would be horrifying
---
He's wearing cover up, because he has to go to a friend's house for Christmas. Doesn't want to scare Grandma
---
Upvote just for Deat Meat mention.
---
James is the greatest
---
u ken do it brudda
---
Lmao dude. Yes, because finding bugs and fixing them is the easiest job on the planet and takes literally no time. Also the artists and character designers should stop all their work and release no new content while they wait for their debug team to fix a problem. BHVR sure ain’t perfect, but there are way more money hungry dev teams out there.
---
Ah okay i understand what happened, NOED got you 4 free downs at the end of the game, you shouldnt pip cause of that
---
He also has the power to just be able to stare helplessly at someone as they finish cleansing your ruin if you run it. Or just watch as a survivor finishes a generator or opening the gates, completely unable to stop them.
---
Dota2
---
Yeah but this is much different.
---
Your idea is biased. It would result in an almost guaranteed escape versus any killer without mobility.
---
Yeah even without using distressing (but why would you not use it on Doc) you pretty much have those 8k in deviousness guaranteed.
---
There are three types of camping; Face camping, Proxy Camping, and Visual Camping 
---
*Face Camping* Which is considered very toxic and unsportsmanlike is when the killer hooks a survivor and stands directly in front of the survivor staring at them and preventing any other survivor from rescuing them. This type of behavior is common with Leatherface mains and survivors mains who play killer just to get revenge after being face camped.
---
*Proxy Camping* Not as toxic as face camping but still considered toxic. This is when the killer roams the area where the hooked survivor is located, looking for any other survivors attempting to save the hooked survivor.
---
*Visual Camping* Staring from afar outside of the area of the hook survivor but waiting for the hook survivor to be saved so you can chase the rescuer and get points in the Hunter category. This form of camping is only considered toxic if the hooked survivor is tunneled. Most killer mains don’t consider this camping but rather a good strategy if done properly.
---
But they didn't say that ONLY real men wear it, just that 'real men' (w/e that specifically is) do wear it.  
---
If I say that gay blacks wear hats, I'm not saying straight Asians can't wear them.  
---
Now, they might have implied it, but we can't really know that.
---
Is this the actual lore? I can't find any info on outside of game.
---
It's not productive!
---
As if I didn't need more reasons to like him.
---
It used to stack based on how many you were stalking However they changed that because of potato survivors.
---
Hey, stop kink shaming
---
Yah the way they we’re talking about it all, it does seem like we might get a cross platform game in the future. Baby steps, gotta crawl before you can walk.
---
If they release a bad product for the game and people don’t buy it, it ultimately hurts the game. They spent time and resources and money putting it out, and not making that money back hurts the company, the employees, and the game.
---
Content that helps the game &gt; Greedy bullshit to monetize it more. Maps. Characters. A NEW GAME MODE???
---
Theres no reason they couldn’t make money from cosmetics the way they’ve already been doing. Pick and choose what you’d like off the in-game store.
---
I’d be okay with a Battle Pass if there was any reason to justify it, but there isn’t.
---
In exchange for tracking and 50 percent action reduction? Value.
---
You must’ve been popular in high school
---
BILLBILLBILLBILL
---
MCote put a disclaimer on all the info they released about ghost face and stated none of this is final till after the PTB. I know we will see some adjustments and changes.
---
115 killer with no power making chases last awhile
---
I know, that is why I said "usually"
---
What did it remind you of?
---
Exactly. Thats the biggest thing that makes him bad. Yes, it can give mindgames. But its such a downside, that its really not worth the dream transition benifit, or the aura reading.
---
Only if you never or barely played the game prior to the price-decrease. Then you’d have to bring it up with Support.
---
But if you think that you get compensation for the price decrease if you have more than 100 hours on the game, you’re an entitled brat.
---
You’ve more than got your money’s worth.
---
Sadness

DOOM DOOM DO DO DO DO DO DO DOOOOOOM

Gotta get those pitiful &lt;1000 bloodpoints tho
---
I can understand ochido but I know that monto and noob3 aren't really controversial
---
I always heard him saying Danny G but I didn’t think he actually was
---
But even on a small map, you sleep them, you hit them, sleep someone else, kick a gen. Thats PLENTLY enough time for the person who you slept first to self care wake up, find someone else and wake them up, find another gen and wake them up, or sabo and wake up. Its just too accessable to be worth it. Its too much of a negative for the benefits.
---
Did you escape?
---
Yes..
---
What did it cost
---
...my life
---
You know you can't buy all of the killers with shards, right? And a lot of cosmetics can't be bought with them either. That's the point I was making you're saying it's all free when *it isn't*
---
We saw that it has exclusive items when they said so on the stream. 
---
Why does it matter that it has exclusive stuff? Because it's *timed* exclusive stuff meaning if you miss it, it's gone forever. This creates a lot of pressure on people to complete the pass within the time window and encourages addictive behaviour. 
---
This isn't a paid cosmetic, stop strawmanning and actually pay attention to what I've been saying.
---
As for the Devs needing money, it's already ten dollars for a skin as well as all the DLC and the fact that the game is paid too, they're fine with or without a pass so don't make that pathetic argument, this isn't a charity, it's a business and businesses can be ruthless.
---
Im fine that they are changing pallets, they even said the reason was to promote skill based gameplay, thats good and fine. Bloodlust kind of negates the skill factor for killers though, it was a fine thing on those L O N G loops for catching greedy survivors, and I'm pretty sure they'll be looking at infinites soon too.
---
I don't know if they'll need to look at bloodlust right away, but I think after infinites get removed, bloodlust should get ditched. Because bloodlust itself doesn't promote skillbased gameplay, but can be a necessary for long loops and/or infinites, or poorly designed maps which they will also look at.
---
In short, after map design gets better, bloodlust needs to get ditched.
---
You can loop around a single pallet for 20 seconds.
---
I know they don’t need to only three years in but I can’t imagine how this sub will be if they ever release like a teaser video for DBDII.
---
You don't read the full thread do ya.
---
Also he should still credit the artist.
---
Man, im not gonna argue about this again. Just telling you I believe the Legion fix was actually one, not a nerf
---
Didn't you know? Protecting your Ruin is toxic.
---
Thats why you keep a close eye on said person to mitigate the randomness. Knowing freddy ive had a great amount of luck doing this strat and from my personal experience it works.

Yeah, my idea for stopping disconnects is to just remove the button. To dc you’d have to close he entire game. It takes a while, so it discourages dc’s. I think that would help.
---
You act like the exposed effect matters.
---
Isn’t Furtive chase only while in chase?
---
Then if killer somehow manages to rehook, salty survivors bitch about hook camping and tunnelling lol

It's always haunted grounds until it isn't.
---
Even Jake is like “whaaaaat the fuuuuuck???”
---
It is still free. Wether or not its all of it does not matter, what you can get you can still get for free. 
---
Just because its exclusive doesnt mean it wont come back in the future either. Plenty of games do that either. 
---
I'm not strawmanning i am paying attetion and what your saying is wrong and stupid.
---
The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
---
He loses his Stealth power. His stalking is differnet
---
I have never seen this magnificent meme before.
---
Was the hat active? I see it's red in the status bar, but I think that flashes after escaping anyway.
---
Survivors no longer get popped if they leave by gate if the hat hadn't already been activated.
---
In deed I was. A comment 2 threads down is still not the same as literally flashing it in the title
---
Nah if you read her bio she got lost when she was like 14 so hag is probably either pretty young or has the mind of a child, like huntress
---
Actually pretty cool. I'd love to get a dictionary thrown at my face.
---
Is it just me, but I feel like the gen telepoet isn't that strong if the survivors get a 5 second headstart, Billy and nurse may take longer to reach a gen, but survivors have a lot less time to react when they arrive
---
Due to ranks constantly resetting there’s not really much of a difference between 8 and 13, it’s a difference of a couple days of playing
---
I'm All Ears is really bad. Basically useless. The only real use would be on killers with low terror radii (and only really Myers with Dead Rabbit and/or Furtive Chase), so that you can potentially get aura reads mid-chase - but post-vault aura reads are not very valuable aura reads; vaults regularly already severely limit the possibilities for plays a survivor has, so if they aren't using Quick &amp; Quiet with Dance With Me and Lithe, you are unlikely to often garner any beneficial information with that aura read. It's basically the equivalent of mid-chase Alert, and how often does that really help you do something you could not have done without it?  And then the perk is also on a cooldown (because it's a very powerful perk, as they said on the stream).
---
Thrilling Tremors is mediocre. Since you are not blocking generators that are being worked on, the stalling potential of the perk is obviously very low. Using the auras to tell which generators are being worked on is Discordance/Surveillance-level utility, and those already hardly see play over perks like BBQ and Whispers. Tremors + Pop Goes The Weasel might be a not-entirely-awful, poor-man's BBQ + Ruin.
---
Furtive Chase is underwhelming. While you are chasing survivors, they either see you or still have 8-16 meters of terror radius to gauge your movements by. I can only really see it be interesting on Myers (0 terror radius in chase) or with Play With Your Food, since not only does the dynamic Obsession mean you can find and down your Obsession consistently without having to tunnel a survivor and risk losing your perk, but the lower terror radius actually allows you to break chase state with less distance, while being able to initiate it with regular distance (because out of chases, your terror radius is regular again too). Still rather gimmicky.
---
From the sounds of things, none of these have the potential to have an impact on the meta. They don't even have neat-enough niche usage to have real mid-level/semi-meta impact, I feel. (Unless Freddy against all expectations gets to keep his aura-reading ability, then Furtive Chase would be pretty awesome on him.)
---
please
---
This one was a really long time coming, since I've been wanting to come up with a way this could be a thing forever, but only the other day did I get an idea I was satisfied with.
---
This is nothing official, just a vision of what may have been.
---
i wish i knew too,,, at least he's still a cutie in my eyes :c
---
Yeah, this feels like OP is trying to shit talk someone without actually calling them out.
---
Well, you’ve never been followed as far as you know lol
---
Nea
---
I really liked this concept. This and the one for the Shining were my favorite concepts I've seen.
---
Current meta hasn't really changed all too much.
---
Exhaustion Perk, DS, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline.
---
Do note DS is now an anti tunnel perk, it only activates for 60 seconds after getting unhooked, but is still useful for cucking tunnellers, or a way to take a hit.
---
I wouldn't reccomend Mettle of Man because it's getting nerfed.
---
Self Care is also okay. Dunno if you were here for the heal changes, but healing takes longer. About 16 seconds, 32 with self care. It can be a lot of wasted time or a life saver. Take it if you'd like. But it gets destroyed by sloppy butcherer, which slows down healing.
---
I get that. The problem is balancing for solo survivors when swf is in the game. 
---
Personally I think most killers are too weak to beat a swf team but can easily beat a team of solo players.
---
For this to be fixed in any way the game would have to be changed a lot. Personally I'd like it so basically every game is swf even for solo players by giving a ton more communication like emotes and voice coms while also giving them the ability to see other survivors with aura (obviously some a lot of perks and addons would have to be reworked) then buffing most killers.
---
I get not every swf is like a miniature army but it does basically give a ton of free perks ( but needs good communication to work) like saying where you are, they can easily find generators, and are also able to tell where the killer is.
---
With out trying to balance out swf by basically adding it to the game. The game will always be between a killer being to strong if they can't communicate or the survivors being to strong if they can communicate.
---
Sadly I don't see this changing any time soon since the devs have acknowledged that swf breaks the game but said they will do nothing. Plus a lot of survivors like playing solo and not worrying about the team and if these changes would be made that would probably upset them a ton since communication would basically be required to win.
---
Plus it goes against the devs design philosophy of it being a game with very little communication. (Although this was the philosophy when the game was just released so it might have changed.)
---
Adding old windstorm to his base kit imo is big enough to consider it a rework, it's not just a number change.
---
I think the only kind of exhaustion that should recover during a chase is exhaustion caused by killer add ons. Otherwise I think exhaustion is fine how it is. Although the bugged exhaustion add ons that cause permanent exhaustion untill your hooked needs fixing asap.
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Ok let me say this again slowly for you because you're clearly not understanding what the pass is.
---
So the pass has stuff in it that's exclusive (this has been confirmed in the stream). There are two types of pass but you progress through both at the same time. One is free but the other you must pay to unlock. Both paths have their own unique stuff in them, you can't get everything with the free pass alone.
---
You. Have. To. Buy. The. Pass. To. Get. Everything. 
---
Maybe the stuff will come back in the future or get added to the store after the season is over, that would be preferable but I do not see that happening as no battle pass system has ever done that except Black Ops but they put the stuff in loot boxes which is worse than a battlepass.
---
You are strawmanning because you're saying that my argument is paid cosmetics is bad. That's not my argument at all, I'm saying that the battlepass system (and all limited time availability systems) are predatory and harmful to the more vulnerable members of the communities they are added in. In fact this entire post was about my method of avoiding all of this crap entirely but someone has to jump down on my throat about how wrong I am about a system that has already negatively affected me in past games to the point where I had to stop playing them completely.
---
I think it SHOULD be a f2p game.
---
Then you would have seen someone already say that and me respond to it? *Thinking*
---
OK a lot of meme are bad on this subreddit but this one made me choke
---
But he wouldn't be the one complaining. You're only a pos for running a meta build if you complain about opponents having meta builds.

Hello fellow hoarder
---
😹yeah, I’m sorry
---
WWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAPPPPP
---
I'm going for 1000
---
You really don't need to hide if you know how to run chases.
---
40+ seconds is more than half of a generator, multiply it several times for every time you and x number of your teammates do it and it adds up to quite some time. It's like a 2nd ruin at that point.
---
Just wanted to get one moonwalk off at the end, didn't you? Shame it didn't work out.
---
Myers is swole af in the movies wym
---
Hey i know the clowns beautiful but dont call mcote ugly just to push the point &gt;:(
---
I've never seen anyone permanently lit up. When does it happen once its fully activated? I usually get the 3rd and 4th hits together. I also play immersed sometimes and it doesnt seem like I'm being seen. I dunno.
---
How is it biased? It's just make things consistent. You think it's fair for a 4 squad to choose between 2 gates as far as possible and a solo survivor who can't escape cause the gates are close to each other? Because these scenarios happen often.
---
I get perfectly what your saying, but your argument is still stupid in every way. How is it predatory and harmful? If people really run into a problem where they cant control their urges, then they shouyldnt be playing any MP game because hate to break it to you, every game that is live service does it. 
---
I'm saying, people are overreacting about the system being bad, that was my only point i was trying to make. The system littrely is harmless and only does good things, but people refuse to look at it that way. 
---
So what you got to pay, you can not pay and you still get free shit, which isnt harmful. 
---
People say loot boxes and battlepass is bad, but how? Who the fuck cares when its only god damn comestimcs items, it doesnt affect gameplay, and people who have to buy shit have a problem they need to get help for.
---
Hehe thankyouuu ☺️ love they username btw Idky but I like it
---
Only rarely, usually when a survivor loads into the lobby with red ping and then decides to stick around for the match.
---
why did you do this
---
What’s the outfit David is wearing?
---
it was worth the ban
---
I hate to break it to you but this comment is pretty cringe and you’re about to lose subscribers.
---
Being solo doesn’t make a difference. I play survivor solo only and I spawn right near Ruin often enough that I always immediately check for it. It won’t be in your line of sight but it can be really close to survivor spawns. If this wasn’t a thing (which it shouldn’t be), there would be more of an incentive for killers to stay away from it.
---
Picture ash as your survivor.
---
If I had a quarter for every pixel in this image, I'd have 5 cents
---
Idk, I feel like this fits better on Ash. Would be a cool cosmetic either way
---
I think I missed it; they’re implementing rewards for leveling?
---
If you get downed after being protected from a hit, it won't activate. You have to be protected, run free, and then heal to full health.
---
A complete set of the highest quality is 10$.
---
Most of the times you don't really need the complete set though. Combining a high quality survivor top with some other standard or cheap clothes often looks better imo.
---
Yes.
---
Look, I'm just going to be perfectly frank at this point. You clearly have no clue what issues are related to a pass despite myself and other people on my post saying how it negatively affects them. You're ignorance is appalling and your claim that paid stuff is still free is honestly the stupidest thing I've seen all day and I just went up against a survivor with self-care and no mither so that's really saying something.
---
I have no desire to talk to someone who can't be bothered to actually listen to what is being said and instead repeats the same thing over and over again completely disregarding everything. Good day.
---
[real men] [wear] [pink]
---
Who wears pink? Real men.
---
What do real men wear? Pink.
---
If you don't wear pink, are you a real man? No because real men wear pink.
---
This is different from your sentence, because your not making a statement about real people. Gatekeeping has to do with controlling what real things can do.
---
What’s even better is letting them do any gen they want and they do it to themselves so you can camp the last 3
---
&gt;Also, I usually play solo and honestly worry more about what raises my odds of escape over the team as a whole
---
This is basically their entire point as to why they think Selfish Care is bad in their opinion. You are wasting 30+ second  Selfish Caring to save your own ass instead of putting that time towards trying to get the team to survive the trial.
---
The only t-bags I understand is a survivor notifying me they want to be healed.

---
So I get that your terror radius disappeared but did they not see you? Running back to the pallet is one thing but vaulting it? Your husk would have vanished already.. no?
---
So now Legions aren’t gonna get compared to Nurses, good
---
That’s still less time wasted than would be if someone gets slugged or hooked.
---
And even if you are excellent at chases a good killer is going to get a hit on you. As killer I’ve never went against anyone that was so good that at chases that I couldn’t hit them. Yes they may try looping but only an idiot wouldn’t break off the chase and go find another
---
I could be wrong, but I’ve heard it’s just a visual bug and it doesn’t actually remove a pip.
---
Lmaooo this happened to be twice while i was playing as legion. Easy 4k lol
---
Having it in the comments as better than no credit at all
---
And you arent listening to me. I am getting perfectly what your saying, but it doesnt mean i have to agree with you now does it? Because i don't. Maybe its just me and able to control my urges because im poor as hell, and i get that there are problems that exist, but they should get help instead of letting it BE a constant problem. 
---
Maybe instead of insulting me, you should take your own advice. I do get what your saying, but i think the logic is invaild. 
---
Also im saying, you still get stuff for free, not paid stuff is free
---
Hopefully that’s the case.
---
I remember showing my friend how to play this and thinking our first game was gonna be an simple killer to play against. Then I heard micheal hit tier 2 and told my buddy to look around him then he screamed as he was grabbed from generator 😂
---
Exactly, people acting like they have a gun to their head. If you don’t want it, don’t buy it and it’s not gonna give anyone any advantage over the other guy. If they can make extra money from the game and keep up with the improvements, i.e. bug fixes, optimization, ect, ect and other things as promised, I’m all for it!
---
Its almost worthless though compared to if the OP was not a dickhead and put it in his title
---
I might be the worse killer ever, because when I play non-freddy, from the time I start a Chase, it takes at least 7 seconds to hit anyone, since theyre able to see me from a distance and react by running or vaulting somewhere. But I guess everyone else is just hitting people as soon as they see them.
---
Can i get an explanation of whats going on here? Looks like Claudette just thought you were afk lol
---
From that perspective they are right. It is not a team focused perk. But from the perspective of a solo player it is crucial
---
Like Bill was pretty much  Leatheface’s survivor
---
Honestly both keys and moris should not be a thing. They’re both just stupidly unfair.
---
*schwop*
---
The only thing that should be changed about hope is that it shouldn’t proc if you’re hooked.
---
Whoever made this seems to hate hatch and likes to kill themselves on gens in impossible situations
---
101th...
---
I don't care if you downvote me!
---
Only reason that’s different is because LF/Bill got a map too. 
---
This time there is no map. Practically the same concept though.
---
It happened to me yesterday when I was playing double red add-on trapper, and the hatch was on that side too. In my head I was like, welp gg ez. You did this to yourselves lmao. Oh and I had ruin up on that side still with a trap you had to disarm to get the totem xD
---
Well yea it does take time, but Freddy has the 7 second wait plus the extra time it takes to chase them.
---
My biggest issue is that you can do 3 gens alone, and then get instadowned and die on the first hook and MAYBE safety pip
---
oof thank you.
---
You mean like, no teachables at all? 
---
Like only the base perks?
---
Mmm, Salty-O's
---
And what would the counterplay be?
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
And yet, he has a skull on the sweater :P
---
I've only been play for about 20 hours and only character beyond level 5 is the Huntress, and I have zero killers unlocked who aren't unlocked by default.
---
It’s like getting called a “baby killer” and the survivors have all purple tier 3 perks while you only have 2 of the starter perks 😂
---
Bloodlust. Which isn’t good counterplay just bad game design.
---
NOED
---
Yep same when I first started I picked up the nurse and got smashed.  They stayed behind for like 10 minutes even with me trying to force them out so I just dc.  Got so many angry steam comments.
---
DAMN YOU REDDIT, 1 hour late I guess, flairs OP
---
Nah I think it’s fine, if they’re devoting 2 perk slots to that, and it’s also counterable by dropping the pallet a little earlier
---
Lmaoooo they'll call us toxic for sure
---
Makes a claim but doesn’t know how to back it up with evidence and reason
---
By leveling up you should be gaining iridescent shards, use those to unlock perks in the shrine of secrets and to buy non-licensed killers.
---
A great perk in general though (I think) is whispers, which allows you to see whether a survivor is within a certain radius of you, helping with early game tracking
---
I had 3/4 salty survivors comment on my profile on that match. I’m just like, you legit did this to yourself. How is this my fault? haha
---
If youre talking about the skull above the bell, its actually Phillip’s boss skull, the one he killed before being taken by the Entity
---
Who was the killer in Friday the Thirteenth?
---
Zeg makker
---
It’s not constant? You have to buy the battlepass. Along with the game, it’s DLCs, and if you choose to, it’s skins. The incentive to keep playing is because you enjoy the game. If you don’t enjoy it you don’t keep playing. They have other priorities to make the game more enjoyable instead of extra money for limited time offer skins that could be made available in the store for the same price. They are making more incentives to play already such as a more meaningful ranking system. This won’t bring more numbers in. 
---
Free game is released, woo everyone tries it. Battlepass releases, people actually consider buying it because they already know they love the game and because they got the game for free.
---
$20 game releases, people buy it, some people love it some don’t, some refund some just keep it in their library untouched and uninstalled, some people don’t buy it because it’s expensive to them. Multiple paid for DLCs come out, same deal. Skins keep coming out, people choose to buy it or not. Game keeps being breaking, people lose shit due to bugs, people get banned, people are having a bad time with the game but keep playing it because they like the game just a lil bit. Battlepass releases, people who’ve never played the game wont consider it because of above statements. New players think it’s pay to win because if they don’t buy it they won’t get everything as quick as others and they also have to buy the DLCs to get all the perks they want so they are pissed and maybe even stop playing. Older players go either way, we either buy it or we don’t. But then there are the older players who are sick of their shit coz they only care about money and not their actual consumers so we take a stand and try to voice our opinions about it being a waste of time, money, resources, when they should prioritise other things and even when they can do this same thing but put the skins in the store for everyone instead of limited time deals.
---
This won’t bring new players in and it’s pushing old players away.
---
It could have been the add on for no phasing sound, or just lack of experience against a spirit😸
---
More like Meg mains
---
Look, I'm sorry for being snappy but all you've really said is the following:
---
1: Free stuff is free even when it's paid.
---
2: There's no problems with a battlepass.
---
3: People with problems should get help.
---
I agree with the third point but the others I 100% disagree with.
---
Just because some things are free doesn't mean that you get everything from it. Using the killer example again, it doesn't matter that you can get spirit for free if all you wanted to do was play Michael, right?
---
The original post was about making the pass not a problem by avoiding the issue entirely, using default cosmetics so that you don't buy into the temptation but your comment wasn't about that and honestly I should've just ignored it rather than engaged but I did anyway because I'm tired of people trying to shut others down.
---
Either way, the original post wasn't for or about you, it was for the people who aren't happy about this system coming to the game.
---
Same thing as before. 
---
Except now you just cancel frenzy and run after them when you want to kill someone.
---
I’m not a fan of *killers* getting special “perks” as you’ve described, cuz it may make more difficult killers (from a survivors perspective) all the more “broken”, ya know? 
---
For the survivors, honestly I’m a fan of the idea, but at the same time, I can 100% see why it’d be problematic: if one survivors “passive” was stronger than the others, you’d see an overabundance of that stronger character. This idea has been raised in the past, and a specific example was for Claudette: she can heal herself 5% faster than the rest. We already see plenty of bloody Claud’s running around, but with something like this, I could see the survivor diversity drop even further.
---
damn bro
---
the ptb for ghostface is out june 4th
---
Eh, earth will be fine. Humans, though? Pretty dicey.
---
yeah I feel that! in the meantime i'd probably try out HappyClown's icon pack, they have the killer abilities there and are quite minimal. Im not sure if it will suit the pack but its worth a shot
---
One gen explosion really isn't stall potential, one failed skillcheck/ one 6 second animation is really not stall potential. It alerts you to where they are at best. Freddy is useless in a chase, this is what makes killers bad. If they have no way to down people quickly, the killer is terrible, its as simple as that. thats why leatherface is above him in tier, because at least there are times where a whole chase is ended instantly. That can save you almost 40 seconds or more depending on the survivor. Someone being in the dream world doesn't cause danger to them, its just the same as any other killer, except you do everything slower. Its no threat or danger.
---
those thighs tho
---
It's basically the loot box before it became trans.
---
My best bet is to look up other builds and watch others play. I recommend fungoose on twitch.  
---
Because In dbd you’ll need perks from other killers to do better. This shrine this week is bad don’t buy anything from it. 
---
If you like chancing hex’s then huntress lullaby is pretty good to use, I wouldn’t use Hex: Thrill with it though. 
---
Also if you like playing with the huntress you don’t have to use other characters you can play her and use that bp to level up other characters. 
---
Also huntress doesn’t exactly have a skill cap imo so just keep practicing and get better. A good huntress can win with zero perks, same goes with nurse. Unless you get a horrible map.
---
So the [Spirit](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rin_Yamaoka) has an ability to turn invisible but leave her body behind until she reappears elsewhere, it looks similar to just standing still. So you can essentially do this:)
---
Hey shortie, you alone?
---
New legion is all about hurting all of survivors and mindgames
---
As the new legion your main objective now is to feral frenzy as many survivors as possible
---
You can either chace the one you just frenzied or go for another survivor you previously frenzied
---
The more you do this the easier it gets, as you have to keep survivor as much occupied with healing as possible
---
Hope this helps
---
You missed my entier point.
---
Legion because stabbing many people is fun. Also because I know how tiresome it is for survivors to only face hillbilly/nurse with a rare huntress every blue moon.
---
Hex: stop being a fat piggy
---
Noob got banned at least once, so yeah he is kinda controversial
---
Well maybe you didn’t do well enough in the other categories. As far as I know it gets more hard when you rank up so that 11k in green would be a safety etc. 
---
Unless of course there devs scrapped that idea.
---
Spirit can phase. When she phases, she leaves a copy of herself behind but she is actually moving on the map. Claudette thought that it was the copy but the killer was just mindgaming her thinking it was the copy.
---
Uhhh. 
---
Whispers 3 only, any other whispers isn’t great, sloppy butcher, bitter murmur, Deerstalker. 
---
I don’t recommend noed but it’s an option.
---
You don't even know the definition of "tunneling" to begin. 
---
"Killer chases someone for more than 60 seconds" is not tunneling. It's a basic chase. The discretion to stop chasing is entirely up to the killer if the survivor is in too safe of a spot to successfully win the chase. 
---
DS used to be a GOOJF card because it could be used at any time, by anyone. Not just the Obsession. I'm probably one of the *many* people who didn't have that much of an issue with DS as it was since I ran Enduring with most of the killers that I played. I don't run it anymore because DS is less of a threat because I rarely encounter the same survivor 60 seconds after they get unhooked, or I slug them if I do and chase the person that unhooked them. Frankly, DS is a mediocre perk and only Killer who run their own Obsession perks ever suffer from it. Since its rework, I've only been stunned twice by it.
---
The devs rework perks if they get feedback from the community, and unanimously agree that the perk needs to be reworked. For some odd reason, the devs never play their own game. At least not in the capacity that we do. If they like where a perk is at, then they don't change it. (Like NOED). 
---
I've read my own comment history, and it's far more respectable than yours. I have far less **NSFW** shit on my profile, kid.
---
Your post is in the trash burner as we speak. So clearly no one but you and other children like you think it's good. You're far more "unlikeable" than me, even by your own side of the fence.
---
Perk reworks are only controversial because this community is full of mains who don't know the other side. The people who do will usually disagree on a change because they know how the perks work from both perspectives. I don't run DS as a survivor because I rely on my own skill to escape, and I don't find DS to be a threatening perk because I'm not one of 5% of killers who camp hooks and are stupid enough not to realize when someone is the Obsession, and probably has DS, and proceed to pick them up again.
---
But again, they might have meant it in the: Real men CAN wear pink if they want to and there's nothing wrong with it.  
---
They might not have meant that, but you are judging a whole person on 4 words that can be taken in different ways.
---
Its not like were camping a hook lol
---
U tryhard 😂😂😂
---
I'm saying free stuff is free when its free  which part of it is. 
---
I dont see the problems with a battlepass. 
---
Yes they should as it wont get better. 
---
I never said you got everything free, i said you got some stuff for free many times, so some of it is free.
---
The problem with that line of thought is, you don't know they are an asshole until after you mori  them.
---
So how can you purposely run it to shut them down, when you don't know they are assholes?
---
I was just wondering if you are ever gonna change it so that when we play with friends we don’t have to constantly invite after every game? It would be really nice to stay in the lobby with my friends
---
That's gross. When are we getting it?
---
Thank you. (:
---
Neas just crouch and point at you, Megs sprint burst away
---
I’d probably replace Deerstalker with Lullaby. Deerstalker doesn’t help much or needed much while Lullaby could be quite great especially at t3.
---
Seems like there should only be one iron desk per detention hall
---
Someone else said June 18th I believe, are they wrong?
---
Kids are this game’s main source of toxicity? Lmao. I’ve seen grown ass men telling people to kill them selves either cause they didn’t escape or get any kills. Know what your talking about before actually saying stuff
---
It's the Activate Windows logo

Aww that’s such a nice thing to say 👍 I’m sure he’s glad somebody recognized that he does indeed try his best
---
the ultimate weapon
---
I didnt that this subreddit was fill up with salty survivors
---
I mean, even if you don't patrol, if you don't find someone before they unhook, you are going to go to the area since you know 2 people were there recently.  
---
Once you get there you might see disappearing scratch marks, so you follow those, then see blood, so you follow the blood, then you find the injured survivor and you tunneled them on purpose somehow.
---
As a solo red rank survivor, I strongly disagree. I do not think it is crucial in the slightest as I have never used it and ran resilience instead.  I think it's a safety blanket people keep when in reality they can take a medkit with faster healing and free up a perk slot for something more suitable for escaping.
---
But everyone plays differently, that's what keeps matches spicy. Good luck out there!
---
Good Edit dude
---
All that violence made me do a naughty in my pants.
---
Well yes, and no.
---
Spirit Fury and Enduring isn't exactly necessary right now, but very meta.
---
The new change will allow SF and Enduring to activate more, but they won't be as necessary due to the fact that most loops will be mind game-able, there will also be more pallets overall, so survivor might be able to get to another pallet before you can get a hit off.
---
So to answer your question, Maybe? Depends on how they actually execute it.
---
now this is the big brain play “she isn’t good if she doesn’t exist”
---
Just keep in mind during the free month there are a LOT OF NEW PLAYERS. The game is very complex and deep tactical but you are going to have to somehow separate yourself from the MASSES of brand new people. 
---
These players wont yet understand much and how games actually should play out, and it will be discouraging to start with. You won't even really get to experience much of what the game can be like, jst because of the quality of the other players. 
---
Everyone learning at once, with a few people sprinkled in that have been playing for a long time.
---
It will ease up as time goes on but stick with it, check out some videos on Youtube or watch some Twitch streamers playing killer and try and get the feel for how the game plays out for them. Being the killer is about killing the others but the actual "lore" of the game is that you are putting on an exciting show for The Entity.
---
So really the game is meant to be played where the survivors have a chance, and its an exciting match for everyone involved. Its ok if they escape, its fun to kill them all but it won't always happen. Understanding that while 1 person goes to unhook, thats now 2 people that aren't working on generators. So can you protect your gens, prolong the game, get more hooks, chases, sacrifices.
---
Because of the power imbalance of a 4v1 game you gotta allow others to have fun, in my opinion at least. Survivors can be a bunch of little shitheads though sometimes.
---
I like it tho, it's kinda how he's supposed to work. In his world, you are meant to be his bitch.
---
I havent played in a while, why is Hag good now?
---
Sprint burst. Lol.
---
I fail to see how. The "benefit" is not that much of a benefit. Being in the dream just means that you can hit them. Its not "faster downing potential" becuase all it means is "MAYBE" which doesn't matter for shit man. Maybe ill insta down all 4 survivors in one Billy chainsaw. MAYBE I'll be unoticed by people while I tier up as Myers. MAYBE they'll walk into my trap as trapper. MAYBE doesn't mean shit in terms of actually how good they are.
---
Looks like the spirit to me.
---
Not a huge fan, seems like the power is really strong and I’m with a offering for reducing time to get call back it would be to strong
---
I dislike keys and Moris because they shorten a game. Too many times I've had a fun game where both me and the survivors are busting our asses only to have a random key end it all. Just disappointing. And, as a survivor, getting hooked once is game over. Which is the idea but it just takes a lot of the thrill out for me.
---
&gt; Wow it lights up when killer is looking at you how convenient    
---

---
WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUIUUUUUUUP!?!
---
Hey yeah, I didn’t even think of survivor items. 
---
Eventually I want to make a tile and just beef up the graphics. Not sure yet whether I should make it game ready, or just high poly detail. Time will tell, but will take time. 
---
Cheers for the suggestions :)
---
115% movement speed, longer teleportation distance, and insanely quick trap placement.
---
Bear trap it is :)
---
I usually save my moris for when I run across asshole swfs the second time around (which happens more often than I'd like to admit it does) then I also equip the most annoying as shit killer perks you can imagine, Franklin's/Ruin/NOED plus whatever other perks and addons that make the killer I'm playing annoying to the max and watch the tears roll.
---
All I can imagine is closing a chest next to a window and just seeing myers peering in before sliding away

Test build June 4th and official release June 18th
---
i agree
---
The current perks that exist for faster/easier wiggling are;
---
Boil Over: Allows you to make the killer sway more while wiggling which can make traveling to the hook more difficult. Also hids auras of hooks within 12 or so meters. Not that good unless you are in a small map like the Game.
---
Flip Flop: 50% of your recovery when you are down is converted into your wiggle bar. Pretty decent perk for slugging killers but to situational as most killers will pick you up as soon as they down you. 
---
Decisive Strike: After being unhooked, for 60 seconds you can escape the killers grasp through a skill check. This only activates once. This is an anti-tunnel perk which can be useful if a killer is tunneling you off the hook.
---
Sleeping besides him &lt;3
---
I swear I seen this already yesterday
---
Fucking claudettes
---
They got a map?
---
Yea, I mean, you can tell someone is an asshole sometimes by play style.
---
But I've had far more assholes in post game lobby, who weren't using a "toxic" play style. And people who run toxic, be nice.
---
Hell, I went against a nurse who face camped me, because I ran in a literal circle on the plague map. And they weren't even blinking.
---
What I'm trying to say is, you can't always tell who is an ass, and who isn't, just by the way they play. Not saying don't mori. If that's what is fun to you, that's fine. :)
---
I didn't know insidious would still work, cool. But if they have heard you phase in the match before and know you dont have prayer beads, itd be a dead give away that you're phasing because they'd hear the sound when insidious activates
---
can someone explain the dream object or as stated the clock on dresser? Have we always had this?
---
His moves are killer.... im not sorry...
---
David is good, but no mither makes it so I wouldn't consider him in a top tier spot for best unique perks for a character.
---
This is very country roads
---
The rules for this sub require the source to be a comment that includes a hyperlink, and also require that there be a source so if you look for it on this sub you should look for a comment. There's no need to clog up the title on top of that.

No....

With dedicated servers they talked about punishing people for Disconnecting. Of course people will still rage quit BUT when they can track the proper info on it. They’ll punish them :)
---
Which was was for The Shining?
---
"I also tbag the killers on escape!"
---
Happened to me yesterday when I was playing Plague except I wasn’t doing it intentionally, it just happened. Still got my 4K tho lol
---
You mightve seen my other stuff check my profile
---
Yes it did not spark joy when they showed it. But it’s early in so hopefully it will be better upon release.
---
Her wig was snatched by Plague
---
I mean playing without BBQ &amp; Chili you're cheating yourself out of double blood points.
---
Probably whispers, sloppy butcher, bitter murmer, and lullaby.
---
Blood lust. 10% speed on survivors. Lol.
---
Flip flop won't be horrible for me because I have a higher level unbreakable. (let's you get up while downed faster)

---
Some weird synergy with Myers and the ghost face perks. 
---
I'm all ears + Furtive Chase with Myers will give him 0 terror radius during a chase. This should mean that Myers will be able to see the auras of survivors doing rushed actions which will make mind-games much more difficult against him. 
---
Other than that the only decent perk I can see if Thrilling Tremors as it is good for tracking gen progression. 
---
It saddens me that Mcote was saying that these perks could change the perk Meta when in reality the same perks for killers have not really changed since the start of the game. The only change being Spirit Fury instead of Brutal.
---
Ghost's gonna be a new top tier on this list.
---
I think the opposite with Claudette, Botany Knowledge and empathy are good while self care... not so much. If I need to be healed, I would much rather run Bond and look for someone else to heal me if needed. Even new players will heal you 99.9% of the time.
---
i think it's a bug 'cause it happened to me as well
---
Where the holy fuck did i say that tunneling is when the killers chases you for ONLY 60 seconds? And tunneling is in this game when the killer only goes for you for a very long amount of time and ignores everyone else you peanut.
---
And i know that ds before the nerf was OP. WHERE THE FUCK DID I SAY THAT IT WASNT? you make all those false accusations which start to piss me off tbh.
---
And who cares wtf im into lmao i have a lot of other posts.
---
And how am i unlikeable you child? "Weee survivor bad wee" "weeee false accusations weee" "weee im awesome weee" like a baby.
---
And who in the holy fucking shit hell uses DS these days anymore. It doesnt even have to be skill anymore to not use DS like you implied to. "Oh look at me, i dont use reworked ds. Im so amazing at this game". Who uses that shit perk even anymore. Just have a killer down you and wait the timer out. Theres your "balanced reworked perk" lmao.
---
And you just proved my point why my post has dislikes wtf? So why make that Argument before to begin with?
---
Most survivors mains play killer every once in a while just to get BP to use on their survivors.
---
That's not my point. I'm talking about when get stuck being a gen jockey or you run the killer around all match. You can't pip very well like that and you should because you are doing your part in escaping. I'm not saying every play style such as the one you mentioned should get rewarded but if you are actively participating in gameplay and doing well you should pip.
---
Fair enough. Agree to disagree. And for the record, i do see your points.
---
Lmao red key
---
Yeah I definitely woulda had him at a tier above on his own. Forgot to say somethin about him in the comments till now
---
No no it was this exact image.
---
Yes?
---
We already have a set that comes with very similar glasses to McCote's. I've actually been passively watching the new Dwight cosmetics to see if we'd get McCote's square rims.
---
Nah we want the Leatherface with makeup on
---
I literally just drew it....
---
No progression whatsoever is what made me play this game less and less. Once you level up everyone to 50 and get almost every character there's really no motivation to keep on playing.
---
Hopes up for the 3rd year!
---
The issue with Flip Flop is not because the recovery is to slow. Rather its because most killers will instantly pick downed survivors instead of leaving them to recover. As a result, you will not get much use out of Flip Flop unless you are against a killer with a slugging build.
---
It’s the other swamp map variant. 
---
Grim pantry.
---
I swear Thrill of the hunt adds 5 totems to the map.
---
Naw Apex ignored feedback from players until it’s like a dying whimper. Fortnite only does real changes because they have competition and listen to the player base on some things.
---
Looking at you dwight in the locker!
---
When you hit someone in Frenzy, you need to decide to run away to find others to hit, canacel your power to save it to chase, or to stay in it to keep up with a survivor for when the stun kicks in. Also if you should use to avoid a loop.
---
Never thought about that brutal Myers combo! But people usually only fast vault while in a chase that’s close so still useless. I like the idea of the obsession hook one but you could just run something better, if anything, these perks are meant for fun. (Which can only be done at rank 10 and below)
---
Once again, posts like this are just inviting trolls to inevitably ruin your day.

I mean if you focus on the GOOD side of her face, she does look cute.

Killer main or survivor main?
---
We had Ash come out so that kinda makes sense really. 
---
Like someone else said LF with Bill. 
---
And we aren't getting a map cause we are getting map reworks.
---
Makes sense
---
Very interesting that you didn’t show the ranks.

This is what I saw so I apologize for mistaken it as yours. But I wont apologize for that shit attitude of yours.
---
Baby Dwight’s
---
That was the patch that came with the ECG release. 
---
Many Pig Mains, Glen0ck amongst them, had their heart shattered by the nerf.
---
During the PTB they also implemented a system where if a survivor with an active RBT was in the pig's terror radius, the timer would not progress. Luckily this was taken out with the full patch release.
---
The RBT only kills survivors who try to leave when its activated. Means the pig has to use all her traps before the last gen is finished.
---
Makes me laugh when killers get baited. Staying a distance and running then stopping is so obvious.
---
Probably even funnier
---
Why the image at the bottom
---
Yikes. Didn't know this. I guess I'll get the cannibal up to 35. I've been using the Huntress at level 3 to just farm points. I'm actually surprisingly good with her even without any perks or items.
---
It's a new item to allow survivors to free themselves from the Dream World without a skillcheck. I'd imagine it functions similarly to Plague fountains in terms of basic use.
---
I already said I understand the map reworks and Ash was clearly a solo release. Still feels kinda shitty that the Ghost Face "Chapter" is really just a paragraph.
---
Sorry, but I have had a shitty day so my attitude might transcend to the internet especially when i feel offended.
---
WAZZZZUUUP
---
WAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
They are good ideas but how do you make good perks constantly that change the meta and keeps it fair? That’s really hard to do so I still respect them ig, but there are some games that manage to do that. That’s what I was getting at too when I spoke of being in a chase with the Myers build, it can really only counter 1 perk that’s not really in the meta. The killer himself is pretty cool tho, decent idea but still nothing too unique. I’m just ready to play new Freddy, he sounds fun asf
---
Perks : Hex:Ruin, Monitor and Abuse, Enduring and Spirit Fury/Surveillance.
---
Add-ons : an Apple ( mandatory against survivors who don't cleanse ) + effectiveness/Black Incense.
---
Strategy : infect everyone as quick as possible, after they get broken, you can use Enduring and Spirit Fury to get the second hit or you can leave them and try to ambush them later with Monitor and Abuse and Surveillance. If everyone is broken and nobody wants to cleanse, you can use your Apple to get Corrupt Purge. Black Incense will give you free wallhacks when survivors are broken, so you can use it with an Apple to snowball into a 4k.
---
"I'm sorry little one"
---
That's me when I see a baby Meg running into walls and stuff. Can't kill em, ever. Just too cute.
---
Kudos to the killer for keeping his chill through all that. What a sport
---
Pretty much we were messing around and brought coin offerings + two of us had plunderer's and this was the result of finding a key.  
---
Clip is from [twitch.tv/not\_ryu](https://twitch.tv/not_ryu), unfortunately my shadowplay wasn't running but I grabbed permission to clip it haha.
---
I think you fucked this meme up
---
Hahahahaha tbh I have never read a comment disagreeing with me that I have agreed with as much as this! Aside from disagreeing on how useful self-care is I agree with everything else you said. 
---
You are 100% right that it’s a safety blanket. Albeit a very useful one. Honestly couldn’t have picked a better term. In truth the main usefulness of this perk (at least in my case) is more so how it affects my mentality than anything else. For some reason knowing I could heal if need be makes me play better. It is much easier to be a bit of a hero when I know that if I wind up taking a hit I won’t be stuck walking around injured until I can find help if there is even anyone left to help. Plus idk how many times I’d have been screwed if I hadn’t healed before trying to make a save or escape. I know I could use a medkit but then I’d have to leave my flashlight behind and where’s the fun in that? Lol
---
And I couldn’t agree more about different play-styles being what keeps things “spicy” lol. The huge variety in builds is a huge reason this game doesn’t get old
---
Not really use noed if you want. If you arent getting hooks or sacrifices before the gates are powered you wont pip. I use noed sometimes as a salvage perk to earn as many points as I can if it turns out to be a 0k or 1k match.
---
I do this so often my friends make memes of me
---
I'm All Ears is absolutely worthless lol. Basically the only time survivors will do a rushed vault is when they are IN your terrior radius and being chased by you. Who thought this was a good perk idea?
---
But if they miss a skill check... lol idk I just love knowing I can heal myself if need be. Frees me up to be a bit reckless
---
Awesome. 10/10
---
It wasn't just Mcote, it was the Creative Director Dave as well specifically speaking about Paragraphs.
---
WAZZZZUUUUUPPPPP
---
My current main is billy ( not because meta, he is the only killer with bbq, and he’s fun ) 
---
 
---
I like the idea of the spirit because somewhat stealth and I can yeet people off of gens if done right. Her perks are good too. I also have spirit fury already from shrine.
---
Looks really nice 👍 you’re a talented drawer.

Idunno

make it a bit more effort, i guess?

Murphy's law is Ruin is somehow found and cleansed first anyway.
---
Thank you so much, I can't draw hands though 😂
---
Me neither. A lot of artists can’t, it’s a common struggle.
---
The game's designed for toxicity I think. Killer doing objective is frustrating for survivors and survivors trying not to die is frustrating for killers
---
*is doing gen* 
---
hmmmm 
---
*gen at 80* 
---
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

*hillbilly with tinkerers comes out from a cross map snipe and downs me*
---
Why are they so hard lol it doesn't make sense
---
I had this happen 2 days ago the guys like if I’m not having fun then why should I quit playing.
---
Which I hate that mentality in a TEAM game. I had good reasons and explained he never texted me back. 
---
Most the time when it’s a 3v1 killer wins and it’s hat much more hard on the other 3 playing.
---
He didn’t just quit right away he tried 4% off twice and didn’t want to struggle. His excuse for that was I didn’t want to die on my next hook. Yeah all kinds of stupidity.
---
Once I finish every Killer, I have a few ideas for things to do. But since they release a new Killer every few months, I won't really run out until they stop updating the game.
---
Omfg 😂 people hate other people for not whining aboi t optional cosmetics? I'm losing faith
---
Its a massager. Its not intended to be a vibrator. There are actually people who use it for it's intended purpose lol
---
Mostly survivor, but I like killer when I’m alone or my friends don’t want to join me
---
I use Ebony mori's to control the game into an interesting match for both survivors and me. And depending on how the game goes, I change my mori use:
---
If I am enihilating the survivors and am about to win the game before 2 generators are done, I'll wait with killing people off untill I have everyone hooked twice. And then it depends. I either give the last guy a chance by killing 3 survivors or I first slug everyone before I start to mori.
---
If the game is going ok for both sides, I'll just play regularly but instead of putting people on death hook, I mori them
---
If survivors have the adventage and the game goes down to 1 or 2 generators, I'll use my mori first chance I get and then continue playing the game normally
---
If survivors are owning me, I'll take every mori at the first oppertunity I get.
---
I like to think of it as dynamic dificulty scaling. And I think I'm doing good since I enjoy these matches and I get a lot more gg's and "fun game" than when I do a game without a mori.
---
An exception to everything I just said is T-bagging survivors. (I mean the agressive kind of T-bag some survivors do after dropping a pallet). I'll tunnel and camp those guys with everything I have.
---
 [/u/VredditDownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/VredditDownloader/)
---
And the perks and addons
---
I have to think they really are that naive, since they keep on adding to that pile of subpar perks nobody in their right mind would want to use over the few perks that are actually powerful and impactful.
---
personally, i would replace unrelenting with something like thrill of the hunt, makes survs think theres another totem and all that
---
 Good Hag......  Players represent.
---
+ Distressing instead of SFTS 'cause your TR will be increased and it'll be more easier for you to find survivors while in Frenzy
---
Well I can tell you either getting Hex:Ruin or Pop is great. Depending on which you like more. Ruins passive but can be destroyed, Pop you need to kick gens after you hook someone and it can’t be destroyed.
---
I would treat him as a typical M1 and run Spirits Fury and maybe enduring. Enduring is getting a nerf so enduring may just not be that great. 
---
Then the 4th perk is up in the air for decisions. Discordance is pretty good. You can run Make your choice if you want to. Bamboozle if you want to. You can combine Brutal strength and Enduring to get back into chases quicker.
---
There will be a double bloodpoint weekend June 14th-18 - a perfect way for new survivors to get hella BP.
---
and he smurfing too fuck em.
---
They only got the licensing for the Ghost Face mask... They could've made a original Surv.
---
Is hope any good?I remember using it when i first started out but always thought it was bad
---
The nurse, then it would be Spirit or Hillbilly
---
They’re all over this sub red so tread carefully
---
If he meant [can], then she would have included can. It's not up to me to guess every single word that someone might have wanted to include in their statement. It was 4 words, and I replied based on what those 4 words were. If the person wants to clarify or rectify their comment, then I'll rethink wether or not I should keep my comment.
---
Also, a bit hypocritical of you assume they didn't mean what was written.
---
You're also assuming things based on what I wrote instead of being open to the possibility I meant different things.
---
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind
---
Nurse is the best killer but her ceiling is crazy high and her floor is crazy low, with Spirit and Hillybilly as a tier below her.
---
Said every killer main ever.
---
I think so. No killer ever expects it. A lot of the time once the gates get powered, they'll give up chasing me to try and get someone else while they can. Other times it helps me counter their speed boost from NOED. It's saved my ass plenty
---
Yeah. The core mechanics need an overhaul, like the very idea of pallet looping, camping etc
---
I liked that idea, I'm already changing it
---
When i try to open the game on Xbox i get a initialization error ( i allready uninstalled )
---
Any help ?
---
You we really about to defend him if it were ebony... look at his setup &lt;tosic survior&gt;
---
In order 
---
Nurse
---
Spirit
---
Billy
---
Now each list varies on other people Nurse is always first but Billy’s and Spirits places change.
---
If you are on console nurse is more hard and I think it still may be top tier on console. On pc nurse destroys.
---
ashy claud
---
I mean I'd be concerned but not after having every gen pop in five minutes. They can and they will on lower tier killers. We need these perks for them.
---
That's actually a good point. He is going to lack some build diversity as his power can only be used really against survivors who are working on gens. 
---
The same issue as the plague where her power kind of removed all anti-healing perks and instead kind of pushed her purely to gen protection builds. 
---
I don't think he will get nerfed for that reason. Leatherface's whole design is around camping and hook protection. Hell, there is even an achievement for hooking survivors in the basement as Leatherface.
---
I dont know personally I feel Ghostface will be like a Freddy where low rank survivors hate playing against him whereas high rank survivors can easily counter him.
---
I've never seen an online game where one side applies such stupid and arbitrary rules on the other side and calls them toxic if they don't follow them
---
"why can't he go down the hatch with me" lol
---
I'll definitely try to use it,but the other don't seem to fit my play style very much.
---
Unrelenting is garbage
---
Aye, Freddy is a full blown re-launch of the character.
---
I mean in that scenario you kinda are a baby killer (in the new/non-threatening sense, not the dumb 'lol ur bad' sense)
---
Now if they're saying 'ggez' that's kinda a 'no shit'
---
No one would use it then. 1st hook is normal hooking. 2nd is struggling so 3rd is last and last is death so you couldnt do anyone on last hook. Even after a survivor on second hook could just be brought to thr hook and killed. I do agree it needs nerfed but i think. the rarity should be pink still. Instead i think the mori should work on everyone after one survivor has been sacerficed or every survivor has been hooked once. Then you would at least need one survivor dead or all survivors hooked once before being able to mori anyone.
---
I run adrenaline instead.
---
I like the idea of being able to buy individual cosmetics, or $10 to be able to earn them all through playtime.
---
I *believe* Fortnite does that, since you can buy all the skins individually.
---
Problem is that’s what we said 3 months ago at the nintendo direct. Now it’s been 3 months and no progress and it comes out in 3 months. If it looked even slightly better then fine I’d be willing to wait but I have little hope now.
---
Fair enough. I like being able to run around the map without being harassed every time I try to do something. And it's a better option than Urban Evading around everywhere and pissing my team off lol
---
Nea: "bruh moment"

But you guys got Ash recently. What more do you want? Killers had to wait longer for something new

Billy, Nurse and Spirit. But also Huntress is super fun and really good. Michael Myers is good too if you can take the time to learn him.

Solo Q. Depends on your playstyle if you want to be a looper and help people DH and BT. Instead of DH you can run BL. But I’d recommend running one of those exhaustion perks.

If you want to help out your team you could run bond and leader. But that requires a good team.

I wouldn’t run selfcare at all.

You can run Urban if you want to but don’t urban all the time.

Enjoy the sweet succor of low ranks, before you are hollowed out and forget the sensation of happiness. For that is what awaits all high rank Killers.
---
And we take it, for it stirs something primal and right within us brother.
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
---
That's my point, they run from all killers, killers need at least 7 seconds to catch up.
---
Legion is better than Plague imo... most would disagree. Honestly both killers are sort of low tier. But legion is good at stabbing things, so if you enjoy stabbing things then play legion.
---
Gosh i'm sorry but he's sexy. I need his ass. I mean look at those thighs, he must be thicc af.
---
Yes but everyone else doesnt have the 7 seconds built into them and can end it faster if they are lucky.
---
Hey thats pretty good
---
It looks pretty bad and the frame rates were horrible. I can’t for the life of me figure out why this game looks like something from the PS2 days when everyone else’s games are doing a million things more and work and look great. I’m not trying to knock BhVR but whatever the coding they are using just ain’t cutting it. It’s 2019, but I’ve heard everyone say it was going to look horrible and they weren’t lying.
---
you'll only need to play one game to get bingo lol
---
*Heavy breathing*
---
How dare he play as Claudette. Jk he’ll grow out of it with time.
---
A lot of the men have prestige that helps them hide well, or just other cosmetics. When I was a David main, his Foggy Day jacket immediately turned me into a boulder or tire 8/10 times I tried. But yeah, big difference compared to someone like Feng who is basically a Polly Pocket
---
They’d need a looooooooot of server space to do something like that, no? To save entire matches? Maybe something where if we press an assigned key binding, and it’ll start recording the last few seconds of gameplay?
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!
---
This really made my morning thank you
---
then don't play a male character?
---
Well thank god for d-strike amirite
---
I mean you can just leave the loops it’s not that hard. Although, yes she is great and I love her if they touch her I will kill them 😊
---
matchmaking is garbage?
---
Just that no one has been talking about it since the stream so...
---
It probably will, if they ever introduce lootboxes they can kiss my VERY loyal ass goodbye as well
---
i like this, wheres it from?
---
Praise Atua
---
You and me both sir, you and me both :c
---
Aqua teen hunger force
---
I imagine its for behavior. Im tired of people saying the perks and builds are toxic. Its how the players play that gets toxic
---
nurse, almost always on top for every tier list ever lmao
---
Dont think it's that heavy, other games have it.
---
Cypress Mori
---
I prefer playing on my switch to playing in my PS4 so I really hope it improves. 
---
But hey, worse case scenario, I guess I’m not rebuying the game and DLC. Shame though, lot of money to be left on the table.
---
It’s like a free escape in every game now. -.-
---
i like to play spirit too, but im not a big fan of going against her
---
What do you mean by "guys". I'm note a Killer main then anything. And Ash was a standalone DLC not a apart of any Chapter. A Chapter "(In the past)* consisted of a Killer, Survivor, and a new level. I can understand why they aren't doing the map thing anymore, but I still don't understand how they consider just a standalone Killer a whole Chapter.
---
Stop! You violated the law! Give the sauce or you’ll be finned
---
Bond, DS, MoM, every exhaustion perks, Iron Will, Emphaty, Kindred, Alert, Unbreakable, Stake Out, Jeff's teachables
---
Thank you all for the comments really appreciate it
---
I applaud you people who do not use ruin
---
You are awesome.
---
:(
---
Oh yeah like how huntress dream mechanic works.
---
Its probably the addon uses your Terror Radius, and then adds a few meters on to it and you can see any survivors within the range.
---
The addons is terrible though, because you can see the survivor but due to the Feral Frenzy changes there is no way you are going to be able to catch up to anyone that far.
---
Sounds like Freddy to me
---
True, guess I’ll have to wait for rank resets to play him until I have start either purposely de pip or play a viable killer. Maybe we’re saying too much now? Maybe he’ll be more viable than we think, though I doubt it
---
Freddy starts dream on someone. Chase starts. 7 seconds later hits target.
---
Trapper sees and is seen by survivor. Chase starts. 7 seconds later hits target.
---
How is this different?
---
Gotta love this community, they say you use toxic perks but all they do is use perks that give them an advantage cause they don't know how to play the game.
---
Never really thought of not using self care because i thought it was so good,but i see alot of people saying it's really bad in high ranks.
---
Ok so you're going to ignore a number of positive educational streamers like fungoose, crunchyeggrollz, usyllis etc all who have contributed more to the dbd scene than just cool juke montages?
---
Fixed it
---
##DontJudgeAQuentinByItsCover
---
WAZUUUUH
---
the four horsemen
---
Nurse is the best killer assuming you are on pc
---
Now hold on whats wrong with Quentin
---
Why are you being downvoted  my dude? You make an awesome point.
---
But... the rank...
---
So the BBQ and Chili would stack on top of that? That's insane points.
---
I feel like every time im against myers I always get spooked and run right into tier 1.
---
So instead of the perk naturally having a counter, the killer has to equip a perk to counter it. No thanks.
---
His crying while injured never fails to make me laugh
---
WAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
That's not really a counter.
---
Builds can not be Toxic, Toxic is not trying to win, it's trying to intentionally be a jerk. Ruin+ToTH+Unerving presence+Distressing on a doc is annoying to go against but it's not toxic, but if the doc using it is using it just to annoy people and be a jerk then they are Toxic, the build is still not toxic
---
I'm talking about ever since the livestream I haven't seen people talking about it anymore, I have already said this.
---
As much as I hate Claudette, her screams are incredible
---
Mom, DS, exhaustion perk are staples. At higher rank, adrenaline, if lower ranks, self care is safe as some teammates are just dumb and won’t heal you lol
---
How is it unfair? The entire point of Killer - to kill. Bringing an Ebony Mori does not guarantee you will get to use it on everyone either. In fact, I've gone up against a number of Killers using one and escaped myself, and with others. I've also had entire teams wiped out through the mori. Perfectly fun and fair either time. 
---
And like Leider said - ebony ones are stupid rare. I have Killers with nearly all available perks at lvl 3, and only 4-5 Ebony Mori. I suppose if you dump all your BP into a Killer for hundreds of hours, sure - you could get a ton. But...you kinda deserve that then.
---
He needs self care :)
---
My first Myers game I experienced tombstone Myers. I was like wtf?! But was amazed at the same time.
---
I really don’t get how people can think metal man is op and Moris aren’t. I hate metal man but moris are fucking terribly balanced
---
Yeah lol got me by surprise i wasn’t being toxic or anything ahaha
---
Rusty Shackles Hag seems to throw survivors into disarray pretty bad too since they have zero indication that they’ve sprung a trap unless they’re running Small Game or something.
---
we just got dodged 3 lobbies in a row
---
the 3 horsemen and the 1 horse?
---
I have to admit. I've never encountered a "fair-play" Leatherface. I'm not telling that there are none, I simply haven't met one yet...
---
It's kinda frustrating to get into a match, seeing Leatherface and the first thought is "well...if he gets me...im 100% dead"
---
In my case it's either camping or tunneling.
---
I really hope you guys won't get my "luck"
---
Ohh well do both haha ur art is good. 😎
---
I'm getting the same message. Not sure what it is.
---
Have you played as a killer before?
---
Don’t ruin the dream.
---
amazing artwork btw :)
---
Once literally emote waved the killer away from a bleeding out survivor and had the killer follow me all the way to the gate before I escaped. The other survivor managed to open the gate on the opposite side and get away safely. Feels good to help out in this game honestly
---
1, Yes and 2, It was a joke.
---
WAAAAZUUUUPPPPPPPPPPP
---
big rip ik D:
---
This is one of the better ideas I’ve heard
---
Can't wait until rework is out and see how much complaining there is about him needing to be nerfed, cause you know it's going to come.
---
Ok good. Because survivors can often survive. Even if you get a 3K that means each survivor had a 25% chance of winning basically.
---
Spies from the Shadows is still just as good as before, they added a cooldown because it was getting extremely annoying getting crow notifications over and over again.
---
The Clowns bottle refill dance is my favorite
---
Every time an Ash enters my lobby and starts talking all I can feel is extreme hatred for him and the players using him. Can’t wait for MoM to get reworked so I can enjoy his presence
---
Just messaged you
---
Mangle- Slows down healing( Sloppy butcher and and certain addons cause this.)
---
Hindered- slows doen movement speed( Clowns bottles and other killers addons cause this.)
---
Madness- makes skill checks appear all over the screen. Im not 100% on the percentages( Strictly doc)
---
Blindness- you cant ser auras at all( third seal and some addons from killers can cause this)
---
I think thats it.
---
Well there’s hindered that decreases your movement speed. And broken that prevents you from being healed. exhausted which prevents you from using exhausted perks like sprint burst. Blindness that stops you from seeing auras. Mangled makes you be healed slower and then there are some killer specific ones
---
Sloppy butcher gives you the mangled effect that makes survivors heal slower and the blindness effect makes survivors not he able to see each other
---
And this right here is exactly why the perk is broken. Thank you
---
I’m confused what am I looking for
---
I try and be chill for the most part, I admit depending on what's happening, I can sometimes get a bit irritated, or even just flat out pissed when I'm Killer at times. Though that usually requires a full SWF group constantly flashlight saving and me somehow missing them with attacks by a hair. 
---
I only get annoyed when I throw up a BPS and half my team rage quits. Like...even if you only get 5k base, that's still 10k you just threw away in a short amount of time, why? lol
---
Yes. BBQ &amp; Chili, and We're Gonna Live Forever (the survivor BP perk) would stack. 
---
On top of that, all five players could use the Bloody Party Streamers offering (another 100% additive stack each, totaling 500%). 
---
So if you get 20,000 as a killer in-game with full BBQ &amp; Chili stacks, that's 40,000. 500% of 40,000 is 200,000 which would be your total BP gain from ONE game.
---
Well I mean it is realistically accurate

Wait. Did you capture this yesterday?

Can you link template?

Also what’s wrong with Claudette. I use her most of my games :/
---
Naa today, same place same characters??😹
---
Bruh same
---
Exactly! BhVR is shooting themselves in the foot because allot of people probably won’t buy it looking like this and will end up in the $5 bin at Walmart and I foresee it being on the free list of games to download if Nintendo does something like that.
---
And that's all they are and all they ever will be. Sacks of meat.

Preach!

I don't understand

WAAAAAAZUUUUUUUUPPP

Moonwalking Myers 👌🏻

I’m reading this as I’m stuck on the infinite loading screen :(
---
to quote a guy on YouTube who said this once:
---
FINNA GET MY LORE
---
Battle passes is a manipulative as fuck, that's my biggest problem with them, or any cosmetics for that matter. "It's not p2w yada yada", let me explain. It hits your FOMO( fear of missing out) hard. Someone buys a cosmetic and uses it in a game, other person sees it and immediately thinks " looks nice, should buy it too". I know a lot of people have control over them, I personally don't care about cosmetics, I just use my p3 gear, but I, and other people who have control over their actions is not a target audience. Target audience is poor bastards who have no control over their spending habbits. They just have to have everything in a game, even tho they will never use it. We knew this for a long time, they are even called whales( people who spend a lot of money on a game) and dolphins ( your average spender). Most people don't care about this thing, it's harmless and not p2w, why do you care? Well, be happy you can fight back your urges to spend money, some people can't, and they are being robbed blind by this manipulative systems. Phone games started it, seeing ALL of multiplayer 'live service' games doing it is really sickening. At this point I only play dbd and rocket league, tho rocket league is predatory as fuck too these days and I play it less and less, dbd might also go down the drain, if half the screen will become buy our cosmetics, battle passes, windows cleaners, toilet fresheners etc.
---
I’m on Xbox one and whenever I try loading it says initializing error. I’ve restarted disconnected yes reconnected WiFi but there is no fix.
---
wow! TOSIC!
---
 WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUIUUUUUUUP
---
It's kind of like no mans sky, they could have left it alone and be terrible, but they worked on it, and it's amazing. Props to the devs!
---
I mean, he didn't touch them all game.
---
Bro, honestly, just don’t worry about what other people say. I main survivor, does it take away the fun for me if I’m hard tunnelled by a killer and/or camped? Yeah, it really does. I get frustrated and a bit salty but I don’t go messaging the killer about it. I get over it and move on to the next match. As long as you’re not breaking any rules then do whatever.
---
Good job, man. Pat yourself on the back! :)
---
This is true for players that are fairly skilled, but I assure you there are people that plateau in green for a given reset.
---
You should use NOED, Spies from the shadow is pretty bad.
---
Not out yet but ghostface teabag
---
Lolao true
---
i like
---
So you think he singled you out?
---
If you go to help and tips, and the game, it shows a list of status effects and what the icons mean. Same with Proficiency Indicators. 
---
Mangled (Broken bone icon) means injuries take longer to heal. Healing speed decreases by 25%. 
---
Blindness only removes auras and doesn't actually impair vision. While a hypothetical blindness thing that would hit the killer would be pretty powerful (Gen auras, hook auras, etc.) there's not much in terms of auras survivors can see by default (IIRC only dying survivors on the ground, which can be reduced to a certain distance with Knock Out, and auras of Survivors on the hook as well as the hook itself IIRC) unless they're running something like Bond, Empathy (See auras of survivors, and injured survivors only but at a greater distance) or niche perks like Windows of Opportunity (Pallet and Window auras) or Alert (See killer's aura when they break a pallet/kick a gen)
---
Hemorrhage causes increased bleeding (Not speed of bleedout when in dying, but the actual blood trails) and running Sloppy Butcher + BloodHound is a great way to track survivors if you're often having trouble with scratch marks which can be iffy sometimes. 
---
And yeah Exposed = one-hit downs from "most" attacks. I don't think Huntress Hatchets can one-shot you even with exposed, and Legion's frenzy definitely can't. (NOED + Feral Frenzy would be nuts)
---
I once got hit by a survivor, ran away a distance, turned around and pointed, they paused, turned away and back, I pointed again and they walked away. I also do the same with lockers and they’ll open it every time, power of suggesion
---
It's not a phase, entity mom!
---
It actually looks like you're in a horror movie in this image.
---
Was it confirmed he would be 115MS after rework?
---
I'm saying that they were teaming up.
---
all hail the all seeing wraith
---
#WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!
---
I mean, it cuts down the work the killer has to do to win by like 30-50% depending on luck.  
---
It's like if survivor only needed to do 2-3 gens plus doors to escape. That's why they massively nerfed the BNP, 4 survivors with 4 bnp was way too broken.  
---
If it gave you 20% less work it would still be OP, but not broken like it is. I don't know how they can make it like that, but if you tunnel off the hook, ebony can end a game really fast unless survivors just don't rescue and do gens.
---
WHAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!
---
WAAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP????
---
I love pointing or waving when a killer is running towards me. Sometimes you can have them leave you which is a solid mind game. If not then hey I was being stupid and earned the hit
---
Or maybe it has something to do with you stepping into a trap? Lol I mean, ya can’t really blame anyone else for that
---
She does, look in the shop, I’ll even get a picture of you think so strongly feng doesn’t have blonde hair
---
I mean, people were crying about LF being OP and needing a nerf...  
---
People will cry if they don't know how to play against a new killer, and deem their own ignorance as proof that he's too OP.
---
It’s a risky mind game but so hilarious and satisfying when it works
---
Yo?
---
I know it's pretty obvious but it had me fucking spinning
---
Hey, a trash bin is exceptionally useful! Don't go knockin' trash bins!
---
Just play TOTH without NOED and watch everyone freak out.
---
Play Haunted Grounds and TOTH for extra excitement.
---
That's why I went from killer main to survivor. As survivor I at least have teammates. Killer feels too isolated to play it nonstop.
---
Can we get the reports to start working on console?
---
Yeah? Thats Claudette is that what your trying to say? They said that in the livestream
---
no that'll just make it harder to get perks
---
the girl in the picture is claudette, the cinemates are basically animated backstories from the ingame characters.
---
Yeah, really is a different game as you go through the ranks.
---
we're getting animated backstories from the characters, the devs said they wanted to add a real story, and this is part of how they do it.
---

---
I've started to learn to take my time and not rush people as a killer main. I've been playing The Shape which requires you to take it slow and loving him. What would be a good DBD Youtuber to watch in your opinion?
---
Although it IS possible to get all the non licensed characters with iridescent shards right? so not necessarily $70 in DLC for everything. even then you'd have to play for hundreds of hours to get everyone with iridescent shards. 
---
speaking of that, why do you have like 300,000 shards saved up?
---
If you haven’t seen recent developments, Sony has become a lot more open to cross-platform.  I don’t see why DBD couldn’t do it.
---
same here. when i encounter an asshole SWF for the second time i always switch to doctor with franklins, ruin, NOED and sloppy butcher with a pink mori.
