While you didn't exactly explain at all what the joke was I finally got it. It's because one of the wheels are always bad
---
---
---
actually it counts towards pips as well. look it up
---
Encouraging Try hard with friends. Fun
---
Lmao what??? I play both sides equally and survivors have plenty of great perks.
---
I'm fine with the balance of the game for the most part. I do about 60/40 solo/swf. You need a very strong rando team to win at high ranks for sure.  But when you do it's very enjoyable. I mean killers are supposed to be the dominant one.
---
You're confused. You die on the hook when you're the last survivor alive in the match or if it's your third hook, or if you don't struggle. If a survivor is on the hook and dies while you're getting hooked then you won't get to escape/struggle depending on how long into the "dying" process their animation was.
---
Only took a few years!
---
While I agree the Legion’s lore is more so “Frank’s Lore”  
---

---
imo. Frank’s troubled upbringing is what lead him to become a delinquent/murderer, Julie is just madly in love with Frank and is will to do anything for him, Joey I think had always been more likely to bouts of violence but I think Frank was his catalyst (as well as getting fired), and Susie was the naive girl who followed her best friend into the wrong crowd and didn’t know how to get out.
---
I think Frank and Joey both fit in “Asshole from day 1” and that Susie and Julie would have their own tier of “Forced/Manipulated into murderous acts” Wraith could probably fit there as well.
---
What's hunt mode?
---
at least it's unique and dynamic unlike just a solitary throat slash i.e. the pigs mori
---
Dedicated servers have made her more consistent to use and fixed the hit boxes kinda because of the servers. She’s now definitely S tier in the right hands, but it really just depends how well you can aim, she has a huge skill range.
---
You haven’t unlocked them yet
---
Oh man, do not say such things in this group. Downvote patrol is coming.
---
Isn't that the same as being broken and getting downed in one hit though? At least by cleansing you don't leave a trail and make a bunch of noise
---
dude I need one of them
---
Demogorgon looks like it wants to speak to the manager.
---
Myers was the og head tilter
---
You can use them in a custom game
---
You will after a few month of not playing. Happened to me. Then I wrecked all the people at rank 19-20 and felt bad
---
Ehhh seems like most agree so far.  But in the end that's just facts on what happened.  Not even stating an opinion. 
---
Besides internet points are internet points lol.  Thanks though.
---
Yea just lil bit:)
---
I hate going up against trappers
---
Pffft we all know that identity v is clearly the superior one
---
I fuse my lvl 10 Shape with my lvl 40 Wraith what persona do I get
---
OMG. Best update ever.
---
My friend got reported for bodyblocking windows as billy cuz "bodyblocking banned" lol
---
I mean I guess it’s tunneling if you go for the one who got unhooked other wise no not at all.
---
I don’t have Bubba, nor have I bought it from the shrine of secrets
---
Actually, if you have better connection than the killer, it’ll favor your view point over there’s, so if it misses for the better connected player, than it IS a miss.
---
when it opens up its flower head thingy.. its designated as hunt in files.. usual walking has the flower petal thingy all curledup .. I suspect it unfurls in chase..
---
The problem I see with your build is you invest too much into the endgame. There’s 2 problems with this
---
The first is about ranking up. One of the most important things you need to do to gain a pip is to slow the completion of gens, only one of your perks does this (SB) and it’s not going to be enough when you start to rank up. My recommendation is to remove remember me, and try to level another killer like nurse, leatherface, hag or legion to get a good teachable perk.
---
Your second problem is with Noed. Noed is a really strong perk, but believe me, if your Noed totem gets cleansed, your entire build will fall apart, and since you only have sloppy butcher for the mid game, you’re going to have a bunch of hooks to get to sacrifice people.
---
TLDR: don’t run remember me, it’s not very good, get a different teachable to help with mid game.
---
well heres hoping they put in an outfit or something lol
---
I tend not to but if I lost the one who unhooked the survivor I will go after the one who was just unhooked
---
That’s tomorrow. Today is servers and bloodweb.
---
Get BEST perk head on now for sale, apply directly to the forehead
---
Recklessly? Lol fuck off. Most Hags come running back to the hook to tunnel anyway. Traps so they can teleport and tunnel if the survivor runs, otherwise just run back and catch them since they cant crouch walk away fast enough either
---
When you’ve played enough, you just stop getting mad and eventually don’t care. As a solo que player, that’s the closest to fun I see for this game :D

I'm terrible at the game, but I used to really like the idea of OoO and SS. It's a shame OoO is used exclusively for trolling the killer, because I'd have loved to use it for trolling my friends. Too bad every time I tried using it tunnel vision activated, thanks to everyone being an asshole in the obvious way instead of trying to do something that's actually fun. 
---
SWF sandbagging build would have been glorious had I ever had the chance to make it work. And now Endgame Collapse exists, so there's no point in even trying.

Yeah, but now she has a ranged attack that can hit and/or down multiple people at the same time

I'm still wondering if Head On + Totem Heal Perk + Decisive + Adren is gunna be strong, cause you can hide in a locker and the killer either opens it and gets DS'd or you full heal and head on him.
---
It's when a killer gets right up in your face after hooking you until you die.
---
When people say they want shirtless myers
---
damn, sick burn
---
I think it's more survivors can have what BVHR considers a good game and still die. People think it's a loss when you die but believe me, yesterday I died 10 games in a row but apparently scored enough points to rank up the entire time.
---
This PTB?
---
That's not all that different from her regular spew though, it just works faster. To me it still seems worth to cleanse
---
Would you rather one member of the team be fucked at different times or all members of the team be fucked at the same time? Because that's the difference.
---
Yep, got back to the normal game due this happening a lot
---
As for your performance in game I suggest the youtuber Monto who showcases perk builds as well as Pain Reliever who makes videos on individual perks, strategies, and how to run loops.
---
Well its is the first day of a build we new servers so I wouldnt stress on it yet
---
Well how long does it last?
---
Thx ma dude :)
---
Sounds cool
---
I like being the obsession, it makes the killer think that I have DS and makes it so je ends up not tunneling me. The aura reveal is permanent while you're holding the key ( not necessarily channeling it ), so it's pretty neat
---
A good hag won't play like that. Trust me. I know how to play her. It's not exactly a secret that better players in majority of situations aren't going to go tunnel. Because they'll already be on someone else.
---
Pro gamer moves by Nancy
---
Another good way is to wait till she’s in a chase and trigger as many traps as possible, in the middle of a game setting up a new set of traps as hag will hurt you more than help you so if you can trigger enough the game will basically be over
---
So much yes!
---
Finally
---
what have you brought upon this cursed land
---
this animation would be the best in the game if there was a decapitation
---
New Killer: The Mario
---
Nah bro, he just had high sensitivity.
---
No that's perfectly fine. I'm a survivor main and you just have to be smart. However it is considered tunneling if you go after the person that was just unhooked.
---
Thank you
---
Omg a baby Dwight. Hiii!! I’m a survivor main and I rarely ever play killer so I’ll offer some tips on that.
---
 
---
Not being the first to go down: it’s quite simple but equally as tricky—don’t be found. Ducking and dodging the killer as they are patrolling is not an easy feat but it can be done. Honestly, I’m almost always the first one found because I immediately hop onto the first generator I see cause I’m trying to get tf out of there. Being found is not a problem if you’re good at evading the killer, but seeing as you’re new I won’t expect you to be able to do that. Until you get better in that region, avoid being found first. 
---
How to not be found first, lol: Dont jump on the first gen you see. Don’t fast vault windows, don’t quick enter lockers, don’t miss skillchecks. Patrol the map for a bit until you 1: find out where the killer is or, 2: are confident enough that you won’t be found right off the bat. Also don’t run away and don’t sprint across the map randomly with no destination. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen someone or been the person who gets spotted by the killer because I started running when I could have just hid, i.e. slid against a large tree or duck behind a bush as the killer rounds it. They have a very narrow line of sight and can’t see behind them unless they turn around or pan the camera a great amount. Use that to your advantage. 
---
What to do when you’re found: Loop. Get to a pallet or window. Put as much distance as possible between yourself and the killer. If you’re doing a generator make sure you know where you’re going to go when the killer approaches. What is your exit strategy? Get there. Never drop the shack pallet unless you’re dead on hook. Do not drop the shack pallet if you’re not injured. I like to think of the shack pallet as “everyone’s pallet” and most killers are afraid of it. When it’s gone that is a huuuge advantage to them. Try and stun killers with pallets. Buys more time. There are some awesome videos on YouTube of how to properly loop killers. :3
---
How to escape a chase: escaping a chase is probably the hardest thing to do in my opinion. You have to be very calculating and stealthy about it. If the killer has been chasing you for enough time then you’re probably the only thing their going to be worried about until you’re on the ground. When you run you leave scratch marks for the killer to see and they last for a few seconds. Your best bet for losing a killer is to blank your scratch mark trail. The only way you can do that perkless is to stop running and hide. Practice doing that a few times.
---
Good luck, have fun out there and happy hunting.
---
I'm a new player (less than one month in), so anything is helpful, but was REALLY hoping to get Discordance or Pop Goes the Weasel so I wouldn't have to buy Legion or Clown.  Enduring is definitely a nice add, though.
---
Thinking about getting Urban Evasion for the future, although I haven't played a single game as survivor yet and don't really feel the urge to do so.
---
Awesome! Just took a listen and subbed, great stuff!
---
From a bug to a meme
---
It's not about hitreg,it's about the hitboxes being so bad.
---
[Watch this](https://youtu.be/Wow0L59qyiQ?t=485),there's no way that happens because of hitreg,it's because hatchet hitboxes are so fucked up

[removed]
---
I dont know why that would be a joke but yup, this ultra rare add on is only good if you dont want to be tunneled due to Remember Me or Dying Light,etc.
---
I already own three of these perks. Am I gonna buy them again? Yes, because I'm a slut for bloodpoints.
---
Use bond, its a life saver
---
This took much longer than it should’ve
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAP
---
It’s kinda hard to 360 on console, though not impossible. Your best bet is to do crisp 180’s.
---
Hey btw, what's ur GT?
---
Leagon has King Crimson confirmed.
---
That's it. That's the game. I'm idling because that's clearly going to happen now. How dare I bring commons because I just want BP?
---
I was away from DBD for about 2 months, came back to rank 16, even at rank 14, I still ended uo in matches against rank 20's
---
The worst example was when I was 14 and in a SWF of rank 9 and 1. We got matched with a rank 17 survivor and a rank 20 killer
---
The funny thing about people who think bodyblocking is bannable is if BHVR didn't want bodyblocking in DbD they'd remove collision altogether because they have for a few edge cases. For example, Myers doesn't have collision with survivors when stalking so he can't bodyblock someone into a corner and get T3. Survivors also lose collision with killers when the killer has hit them while carrying a downed survivors
---
thank god, i dont have to level misss fatass to get head on.
---
and being a freddy main means i can now get enduring without levelling billy
---
I chose to have a black survivor there because of saminations video in which tapp happens to be the one the huntress chooses as her husband. The word enslaved is added because of the meme template which I'm sure you have seen before somewhere. There is no correlation between the colour of tapps skin and the word enslaved
---
is this out for xbox?
---
ooooooh, I thought you were supposed to hang around as the killer, not right in their face of course but close by, you know so they don't get unhooked?
---
On the PTB, because of this new Oblivious status.
---
Ash is getting new cosmetics? Finally.
---
Tempted to get urban evasion but head on is such a meme plus I've been playing Dwight so I mean might as well mess around with lockers
---
A good hag wont know. DBD however is not full of good hags. Thats why 90% of them are camping little shits and unfortunately with Hag its very easy to do.
---
I dont do it because I know if they’re crouch walking, they’re slowed down anyway. And if they ran, normally the trap they do set off shits them up and then run away before later coming back for the save. I plant traps as a decoy and its surprisingly effective. This way I’m pressuring the hook and chasing another survivor somewhere else on the map at the same time.
---
Ayyy. Head on.
---
&gt;That's not all that different from her regular spew
---
Its all different
---
Regular vomit = damages you only one state, gives you broken, now she can only damage you with M1.  
---
Safer to loop around since you only have to worry about keeping yourself far from her hit range
---
Corrupt = you get hit from afar, unlike huntress she can hit multiple people with it, she can now just tap to use the power twice and you're down.  
---
Not so safe now, and you probably screwed your team as well
---
&gt;To me it still seems worth to cleanse
---
This would be the same as just standing still and leting myers stalk you.  
---
You're giving more power to the killer
---
I didn't know she could only damage you with M1 after getting the broken state
---
Finally! Now time to find friends who like dbd!
---
You can buy legion and clown with iridescent shards btw, and if you’re on console everything but head on can be gotten for free as doctor, billy, and nea are free.
---
And if you’re on pc doc can be purchased with shards as well.
---
In general i wouldn’t buy Urban Evasion, Overcharge, or  Enduring if you’re on console or Urban Evasion and Enduring on pc. Save the shards for a licensed killer/survivors perks or a survivor/killer you don’t have
---
Awesome. 2 more perks o still needed to unlock
---
Let’s gooo head on and 150k bloodpoints for urban :)
---
Yep.  
---
Her vomit cant down you normally.  
---
Only corrupt can.
---
U like?
---
just save up your shards and buy both killers once you get 9000 shards.
---
Yeahhhhhhh okay that makes sense. Well it's still debatable, however I'm now leaning almost fully towards not cleansing
---
Why the fuck are Jane’s perks only 2000 when they’re in the shrine for the first time?? I thought first time perks went for 2700. They did this with the last Jane perk that was in the shrine too. I want those 250000 sexy sexy bloodpoints for the new chapter
---

---
Oh wow, Second Wind might actually be worth running now! Imagine unhooking yourself with Deliverance but using Second Wind to heal back to healthy - all while looping the killer or doing gens.
---
I guess the killer could just wait outside. It's not like you going to Narnia.
---
F
---
Step 1. Raise sensitivity to max.
---
Step 2. Rotate camera in one direction.
---
Step 3. Swirl character in opposite direction.
---
*Example:* Rotate camera right while spinning character counter-clockwise.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Yeeess! I was hoping for some head munching!
---
There really weren't any mentions on the patch notes themselves, but they said these status were gonna be introduced with this new DLC. However, they also said that, at first, it was only gonna apply to the Demogorgon. Apparently that isn't the case.
---
I haven't played enough matches to be able to provide you with a complete answer, but from what I could observe so far in situations in which the survivor knows the killer isn't emitting a heartbeat (say when you're asleep against Freddy and you can only hear the lullaby instead of his actual terror radius), you get the Oblivious status. For all purposes this impacts or cancels out any terror radius-dependant perks, be they good or bad (it impacts Object of Obsession and cancels out Borrowed Time, Diversion, Stake Out, Coulrophobia, Infectious Fright, Overwhelming and Unnerving Presence).
---
Undetectable should be the other side of the coin. The killer gets this notification to be aware of these effects.
---
Thank you for this extremely insightful post.
---
SWF does not make the game easy. It gives you a big advantage if you try hard and only talk about the killer's position and actions. Most people don't do that though. In fact I survive more as solo because when I'm SWF we are overly altruistic and its more casual/fun. Solo has no obligations to the other players.
---
I can't imagine solo is hella difficult either. There really isn't that much of a difference.
---
See, if they wait outside, they get Head On. If they wait a bit to the side, then I can take a hit after I heal from the perk, if they open the locker they get DS'd, and if they wait at a locker for a full minute that's 1 minute worth of generators.
---
Search YouTube there are plenty of videos. 
---
Doing a 360 is really easy. 
---
With the left thumbstick, do a clockwise motion will holding left on the right thumbstick. And reverse for opposite spin. It takes practice and more importantly timing to get it down. Once you figure it out, it's second nature. But you will still get hit almost half of the time depending on the killer.
---
Wooow, you’re an asshole
---
&gt;how is this not fair when you can combine perks like Deliverance and Borrowed Time to practically guarantee you get off your first hook?
---
The fuck does this mean then?
---
Well some people misunderstand this as the killer is supposed to win or have OP/toxic gameplay.
---
Make one of a survivor next
---
Is this a Sackboy Nea?
---
This is so great. I love the expression.
---
Left behind and dark sense are no longer poop tier? Pretty good job so far.
---
Me too, he is such a cute boy I want to date in high school
---
Killers and survivors both have teachable perks that you can unlock once reaching a certain level on the original Survivor / Killer perks. And yes, you are supposed to be matched up against people of similar level, but people have been going against others that are way higher / way lower ranks than them, and on PS4 (as I have seen) purposefully Deranking is an issue.
---
Lmao wow. You’re kinda rude. They’re not “really easy”. Most killers can 360 you right back.
---
I literally only bought Jane for head on wtf
---
Y’all
---
I wish this were an actual buff. A decent player with spirit doesn't need to trick people with the 'standing still' thing. She's plenty strong against a survivor in a loop with her basic phasing.
---
YAAAY! THIS IS SO EXCITING
---
If the basement is in the downstairs of the balham building, whenever you go in it the fps drops to like 5.
---
I feel you man, I feel you
---
aaaAAAAH
---
I think when a killer DCs your supposed to keep your addons, but I usually dont. A lot of time when I get killers DCing it's because they dont like the map, so they rage quit like a child
---
The previous match i was up against all red ranks but at least they werent toxic
---
You're lucky if you get Badham and are running a Hex perk. It has a far greater chance of surviving a decent amount of time than any other map because they actually put in good totem spots (unless the totem is placed in the pre-school. Then you're fucked)

---
Honestly they need her with no pig head. Just her face with a big hood or wearing one of her own traps
---
Ohh ok sorry for being stupid
---
Just like your theory about the blinks , reaching red ranks its just the tip of the iceberg, theres a huge skill gap within rank 1 alone. I know pleeeeeenty of people that got 4ks without EVER playing nurse like EVER. Play nurse or spirit is a garanteed 4k. a friend of mine 4k'd his very first game, against all 4 rank 1 survivors.. on fucking rotten fields. Nurse has a skill associated with her sure but its veeeeeery simple to use, way too easy, her power is absolutely broken as well. My point being for such a powerful and broken killer she should be way harder to use, maybe not 3 hours but you shouldnt be able to do what she does not even with 3k imo. With the normal killers you get punished for making mistakes, with those two you can male a shit ton and still do well.
---
What does that have to do with actually pulling the move off. It’s easy to do. 
---
Also there was nothing rude about what I said. I even said it won’t work half the time depending on the killer.
---
OMG NICOLE TV
---
And anyone trying to get that impossible steam achievement total.

Dedicated servers are gonna be a harsh wake up call for a lot of players. They are not an all-encompassing fix for connection issues and a lot of people will find their experience degraded than what they had with peer-to-peer.

That being said, the implementation of dedicated servers will be continuously updated and improved just like everything else in the game.

Base game has 5 killers and 7 survivors (Trapper, Hillbilly, Wraith, Nurse, Huntress killers, Dwight, Jake, Meg, Claudette, Nea, David, Bill as survivors). The rest are all DLCs, but you can earn the non-licensed ones by saving up shards (one currency earned from playtime)

I mean it depends on the situation. If it’s you and one other person, with three gens left, then that’s a hatch game in my opinion. I would die on hook for the other person, and expect the same.

Aww thank you so much! Im getting so many positive replies that now i really am determined to make other surviviors, even killers!
---
I just need more practice as i am new to making dolls. So stay turned.
---
Oh so that's what those were, lmao I've been guessing all day.
---
So what your saying is [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/WINDOWS-10-HOME-KEY-32-64-BIT-GENUINE-LICENSE-ACTIVATION-RETAIL-OEM-WIN-10-HOME/362658248229?hash=item54701db625:g:my8AAOSwFCdc5Kk5) is legit? Because I have the free version too and wanna get the full.
---
Clown and hag should be higher imo
---
Hahaha this is true, my 3 man swf is usually screaming with me laughing. Granted im the only one who plays consistently.
---
I do find solo much eaiser to survive, i just dont play the game seriously when i got my brothers yelling in my ear.
---
Not speaking for anyone else obviously.
---
Well, it wasn't supposed to be, but hey! That works haha
---
I wish they would release some Laurie skins for the new movie.
---
Finally some decent survivor perks!!
---
That's what happened with me, my first survivor game back I looped a rank 18 killer for 4 gens before I let him down me and kill me because I felt bad and he did good during the chase.
---
Haha. Which one would you like to see next?
---
Steve: STOP MESSING AROUND WITH THE FLASHLIGHT NANCY, WE GOTTA GO!
---
It's so bad. But perfect for memes.
---
Thank you so much! 😊
---
Clown Legion Cannibal and Trapper are the weakest killers they need buffs
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Omg a baby dweet🥰
---
Where do you get the statistic that most CEOs are psychopaths or sociopaths? That sounds just wrong. From what I’ve read, the percentage of psychopathy in the general population is about 1%, whereas psychopathy is about 4-5x more prevalent in CEOs, lawyers, and some other top careers. That’s still only about 4-5%. On the other hand, sociopaths tend to be violent criminals who end up in prison.
---
For xbox too?

---
They could try to fake out, but I guess if that's the situation, it might just be better to eat the Head On since it causes Exhausion.
---
By the way, how effective is Head On? Is it likely you'd escape the killer after using it?
---
No problem! Hope it works well for ya!!!
---
Lol for sure.  Either way, what I said wasn't a complaint, it was a fact of what happened. I've been around for a very very long time with this game. But ok 🤙
---
Yeah, I thought it was working?

Hmm, Head On this week, and Nancy's Inner Strength coming soon? If Iron Maiden shows up on the Shrine, it can't be a coincidence.
---
She takes a ridiculously long time to set traps up in loops, if you dont have ruin your gonna have a bad time. While also having a 110% movement speed she is easily looped and her traps are 50/50s compared to the success rate of freddys pallets and trappers trap in loops
---
69, 169, 269, 369, 469...
---
Just a normal attack with my knife as Pig
---
Ooooohhhhhh
---
98% upvoted. Who the fuck are you 2%?
---
quick dumb question i’m kinda shy to make a post about- what exactly is a ptb? Is it a test trial or something?
---
Yeah it was just a basic swing
---
Its literally like that for all perks.
---
does anyone have a link to his perspective?
---
Are ya ready kids?
---
Can we please have rank reset take longer than every month?  It makes sense if DBD is your main game, but if it's not, and/or you take some time off to play other games, or clear your backlog, your rank gets trashed.
---
I think it's a bit more effective now, as they fixed this:
---

---
i wish i was able to play the demogorgon but for some reason it doesnt show up
---
I mean I bought mine from a *SLIGHTLY* more legit online retailer for like, $30 as opposed to $100+ so it might be?
---
Spirit is a very high tier killer, although she takes some getting used to. Shape (Myers) is pretty fun to play and he's high/mid tier. I hear Reworked Nightmare (Freddy) is pretty good, but I haven't gotten the chance to try him out yet.
---
Kinda. People on computers get access to things early so they can test it out and leave feedback. PTB stands for Public Test Build or Public Test Beta. I'm not sure.
---
Thanks! Great job!!
---
I feel like there is a lot wrong with this tier list
---
They should do it like friday the 13th did: you can only hear people when they are close to you
---
Im level 34 with nea
---
No, it comes out on the test client tomorrow. Won’t go live for console or pc for probably two weeks.
---
No. Only the PTB gets it early to test.
---
You can't select him currently, the Stranger Things stuff won't be available until tomorrow. I'm guessing the killer cheated/glitched somehow and managed to play as him.
---
Why the name change? Especially to something nowhere near as catchy.
---
This is so beautiful
---
Have you ever considered that maybe, just *maybe*, not everyone who plays SWF is a "try hard" and some actually just want to play a video game with their friends?
---
This simple concept is lost on far too many people.
---
And Ashe once farmed me for deliverance but after that he got chased for all 5 gens and door
---
I mean, that's working with the opposing team either way
---
No mither, object of obssesion, babysitter,mettle of man. Add ons i would suggest a green key.offeribgs...a very small map so either game or lerrys.Have fun dying every game :)
---
But you cant see auras when phasing...
---
And makes more sense. By blocking vaults you "contain" them. "Limits" seems more like "the limits of X" or somethings. Maybe "Cruel Limitation" would fit better, but its still not as good as confinement.
---
That's a huge buff for left darksense
---
That's an incorrect assumption about me. I've followed this game since it's reveal when the devs described their vision for DBD. This SWF and now new "party features" are being added begrudgingly.
---
I assumed this was common knowledge. Just YouTube / internet sleuth this stuff.
---
Don’t worry, devs said that they’re gonna reworn all of the old maps one by one, so Thompson house is most likely gonna get a drop down opening on the second floor when the rework comes, eventually.
---
oh! cool! so they’re playing with the stranger things characters already?
---
If borrowed time was active, or the maniac got MoM to proc, endurance protects you from the next instance of damage that would put you in the dying state
---
You did a great job! I know everyone has already said this but if you ever take commissions I would buy this in a heartbeat
---
Faulty logic, but ok. It can be nerfed from its original vision. But yes, it never came out on live servers.
---
I’d also like to know if you plan on selling these! I’d love a Feng one!
---
Yes lol. I don’t get mad anymore. Well the only time I get frustrated is when killers camp or my teammates just leave me on the hook 😂🙄
---
no decapitation ResidentSleeper

---
Huh, for once they actually didn't fuck something up! Good on them!
---
See if you can scoop it up cheaper on humble bundle or something its not much cheaper but my friend got lf for 1.50
---
SWF is not that strong though
---
You get info on like spirit fury maybe, and can coordinate specific things like BT, DS, Deliverance and Unbreakable
---
Ex Dbd player (considered the best in the game in his prime) who swore off the game.
---
It’s not just huntress FYI, it’s Plague also, there’s a massive delay on her puke.
---
at least you got 2 other good perks too.
---
&gt;The beads will run out.
---
You aren't spamming the item all the time. If you use it in small bursts to find out your team's location, it will last you the whole match while also providing much more info than the ring.
---
&gt; No range limit either. 
---
In what situation do you need to know the location of someone who's over 48 meters away from you? You won't join them at a gen nor will you get a heal from them.
---
Again, it's not worth it for just 1 aura read, plus if you are using ds/are just unlucky (it only says it LOWERS the chance of being obsession, it doesn't remove it) then there is a change you will become obsession and the add on will be completely useless.
---
You know, I doubt it's powerful *enough*, but Dark Sense and Deja Vu seems kind of legit since you can see where the Killer is and if they are next to the Generators.
---
“Go Michael, use Hi Jump Kick!”
---
She sure does!
---
It was trash tier before. Except it was trash bc its design shoehorned it into shit tier. Bc if it was any good, it was gonna be game breaking and disgustingly overpowered. 
---
No sensible killer main likes old dying light, even the dude who makes the Entity Education videos said he'd rather have old DS and remove Dying Light from the game entirely. It was shit and it was horribly designed. No perk should encourage Tunnelling. 
---
My idea for a light rework would be that the obsession status transfers to the Survivior with the most points in the benevolence category, in order to deter Tunnelling.
---
Buy from someone with a solid feedback rating and multiple transactions. But yeah I had no issues, and if I did, it was just 5 bucks, on to the next lol
---
That was not an assumption about you, that was a blanket statement.
---
As for the vision of DbD, three years ago BVHR was a small studio of three people and the game featured three playable killers. Now they have 16 killers with a 17th on the way, have secured the licences for eleven characters from six horror franchises, the game is on PlayStation and Xbox and is coming to Switch, and is mechanically very different from what it was three years ago.
---
The game has exceeded expectations, and had to change over time to do so. Do you actually believe that they're implementing QoL changes that will encourage their players to keep playing the game for longer and potentially draw in new players? I sincerely doubt that.
---
Death is not an escape
---
Awesome! I’ll take 20 for non-voodoo purposes :)
---
Awesome! I can show you the ropes and help protect you later tonight if you want. GT is Dbreadd, send me a message if you want to play!
---
That’s talent don’t let anyone tell you otherwise
---
Survivors:
---
“What happened to this gen progression that we 99’d?”
---
Myers:
---
Gone, reduced to atoms.
---
Here's hoping they give the other Killers unique chase music. I'd love for Wraith to have a series of bells/chimes when he's chasing you.
---
She can 1 shot survivors according to a clip i saw earlier
---
It's incredibly difficult, that being said, It's very rewarding when your time practicing pays off. My advice is to never use extra blinks or range add ons, or you they become crutches that hurt your over all skill severely. I let that happen to me for a bit because I didn't wanna practice after going back to her and it bit me in the ass. The best way to learn and master her is to go in with no add  ons and practice for many hours. And it will be frustrating and very difficult. It took me almost 48 consecutive hours to do well with her after watching several guides and seeing many people such as tru3 play her many times. From the experience I've since acquired on her I can tell you it's all in 2 things for the most part with nurse, prediction, and muscle memory.
---
I’m on console
---
Nerfing a perk before it’s even tested. Sounds like bhvr to me.
---
And do a simple google search on how to acess the dbd ptb
---
This is awesome! Great job :)
---
Balanced Landing is one of the best perks in the game so it was still worth it to level up Nea.
---
That's my usual game plan especially if they've been super altruistic all game. Chances are their buddy is gonna get the downed guy back and i get to catch them, if im lucky down them both.
---
Id suggest you just level Nea since shes free
---
The average SWF is much stronger than the average random team.  And a really good SWF team is super strong.  You're able to know whose being chased, location of the killer, if anyone is closest to hook, is the killer camping, etc, etc, etc.  I play SWF so this isn't me bashing on it.  This is me stating the facts of why it wasn't in the game originally.
---
Wow you sure showed him for disconecting
---
Agreed. Should just compress it all down into the "invite friends" button.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Didn’t even know he ever played Dbd. All I know him from is whining about Fortnite every second he played the game
---
What would be really cool is having an in-game proximity chat for solo queues.  That would make the game even more realistic and would add a sense of familiarity between the survivors.
---
The glowing type state? No he didn't unless I'm thinking of the wrong perk
---
Don't undervalue rainbow map, it's a pretty good item, it can save you a lot of time.
---
I agree that odd bulb is garbage, nerfed to shreds. I'd put BNP on the same level.
---
Syringe is an amazingly broken add on, what do you mean? It's the only ultra rare that is actually worh its price (I think rainbow map should be purple). It completely resets the chase, and if you are mechanically capable of doing a syringe tech then it's even better. It's definitely way stronger than a styptic. I'd take it over the ring every time.
---
I was jk
---
Fixated and Iron Will will mess up Spirit. 
---
People will still cry for a nerf to her tho
---
Have you tried reading??
---
Might help you instead of making stupid questions
---
yeah he was a monster. look up his dbd gameplay on youtube.
---
Or, you could restart.
---
I mean it still doesn't have a real punishment. Losing pips is honestly a benefit to some people considering how often you get spirit or nurse or toxic builds(like iridescent head huntress) when you near the red ranks.
---
Yes would you like to tell me what's wrong with the list
---
That makes me feel good! I wont give up 😊
---
Plague freddy and hag should all be a tier and nurse should be s tier imo. I play on xbox and nurse is still the queen. She's just a rare sight on console.
---
PTB is two weeks before it goes to all platforms.
---
Even more reason to keep someone slugged now I guess
---
What ? No ! It’s the survivors fault for triggering the traps.
---
I shall now use this phrase in every single one of my end lobby chats. Thank you very much.
---
Good! Good luck in the mist!
---
Aren't your scratch marks visible though? And then the mother daughter ring makes them mot visible?
---
A horrible one
---
I forgot 72hrs was a dbd player I only remember that that because Claudette has a orange reskin which says it's for him
---
Nothing you do in the PTB will affect your account in the official server in any way.
---
You can literally use paint
---
M’Laurie
---
I guess thats who the phantom people are, those guys that appear out of nowhere every once in a while in game.
---
Honestly suicide shouldn't even be a mechanic. The entire goal of the game for survivors is essentially to keep 4 people alive as long as people. As each dead person has an exponentially increasing negative impact on how much time you have to open the gates. I mean just losing 2 people means you can no longer power gens when one of the remaining two gets hooked, and then it's just a matter of hatch play.
---
It did, yes. Hatch follows the normal spawning/opening rules PLUS it always spawns and opens when one survivor is left in the match.
---
Finish all the gens with 4 survivors up, Hatch will spawn. 3 survivors escape via gates, Hatch will open.
---
3 survivors dead with 0 generators complete, Hatch will spawn and open for last survivor.
---
Killer can now close the hatch. Doing so starts the End-Game Collapse - Powering up all generators and doors. Survivor still needs to activate the door to open it.
---
Of course! If you start selling these be sure and let us know. I'd totally buy one.
---
time to use every flashlight &amp; instaheal I have lol
---
Fuck that I’m getting head
---
What u doing son?
---
Yes that will be a massive counter to one of her most powerful builds
---
I just emailed them about that the other day too lol.
---
IT  SAYS IN THE WARNING
---
cant you read????
---
Shit now that i see ash is getting his season 3 finale skin idk if i want her outfit anymore
---
Doctor because I like abilities that revolve around sapping the survivors and slowing them down with debuffs.
---
Does this have anything to do with dbd?
---
Fuming Mixtape and Iridescent seal would like a word
---
Devour hope is perfectly fine
---
11.99$ good sir
---
obviously this comes out the week school starts so i have no time to play. nice.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused the Exposed status effect audio to overlap with The Shape's Tier III audio SFX. 
---
the real fix, bois
---
*stalking intensifies*
---
he will barely play it
---
A week after the ptb is gone
---
Errrrrrrrr I would absolutely mori every single one of them
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Thanks you random citizen
---
I didn’t know the cashier had a name 
---
Carl suits him
---
Thank you random citizen
---
it’s the tunnels from season 2
---
Lmfao. I'm imagining future plunderer's builds. "Oh look. A broken key. I can open *another* chest with it. But **harder**"
---
Best tip I got for the Doctor: Survivors cannot drop pallets for a couple seconds after you use Shcok Therapy on them.  Just throwing that out there.
---
Her traps take 2 seconds to set. They last for 5.5 seconds. Dont know where you get 50/50 from
---
&gt;why would you ever have the lights on in that case
---
Lights would be on by default
---
"Begging you for mercy"
---
Aight chief thx
---
When I finish it I’ll post a jpeg version. I just don’t want to make a JPEG file of an unfinished sketch because it feels like a whole lot of pointless.
---
Matchmaking posts are forbidden now. Delet dis.

Congrats!
---
For the exact date of when the dlc comes out around 17th or 18th considering PTBs are 2 weeks long. Yea the bloodweb change is pretty cool but seeing 4 perks in a bloodweb bothers me.
---
Most of the killer ones seem strong but I love most of the ideas, especially the contorsionist Perk.
---
Thank youu
---
This is actually a really good idea. I play both Plague and survivor and I feel the same way. These nerfs would make the gameplay more interesting for killer and more fun for survivor.
---
That's a really nice idea but they'd have to make sure the songs bells don't sound to close to his bell or it might confuse survivors and be a little unfair
---
Nurse should be higher Freddy,huntress should be lower
---
An actual good meme lmao
---
Still equally disappointing
---
Really? I mean I’ll take your opinion. But you can get 2 perks at once tho
---
a buff for my impatience
---
Not at all, we got a perk that could consistently slow the game down and they nerfed it.
---
I’m kinda stupid but it’s the spirit before death?
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I mean if you're asking about the current bloodweb obviously no but PTB bloodweb you can but it's kinda hard to do not if you know the patterns though then it's easy.
---
Dedicated servers are going to be a negative for every killer because they wont have 0ms latency anymore, and hatchet hitboxes are mostly a problem with latency. On the survivor side, hatchets look like they hit you without hitting you, but to the Huntress, it looks fine.
---
how clong have you been watching aaron for?
---
You shouldn’t go below a rank 12-13 during reset or depip depending on hours played and if you reach level 10.
---
VERY VERY FRIGHTENING

since the last time I've seen my son
---
ig you’re right
---
Groovy
---
He smells the N o u g a t
---
They tested it internally and decided it’s not right
---
This would actually be a lot cooler, and strong idea. Idk about permanently revealing your aura, but being able to channel your aura with a skeleton key to say "hey come on let's go" could be worth it. And you could use it with the add-on that lets you keep it if you open the hatch.
---
Sort of? More like a *spiritual*(ehehe) awakening of sorts during death where she’s entering the entity’s realm. I might do something similar for a couple of other killers but I’m not sure.
---
If it does, you might wanna get that looked at. 
---
I can be your guy for that.
---
Well of course the head remains the same if he gonna be eating ass
---
Trapper makes me too paranoid to enjoy a game.
---
Cleanse ruin.
---
In all fairness it was about 4:30 Am for me so it may have been similar for the legion. We were possibly both very sleep deprived ahaha.
---
Doctor is one of the worst killers when survivors are actually good, because most if his power just fucks with what you see
---
Hey I mean if you like it, you like it. But for me as someone that hasn't watched the show the icon is just a disappointment compared to  Ghostface or Micheals as they change when using their abilities
---
I've been playing for awhile and I'm good with gens, trash with loops. I've basically accepted that if I'm spotted, I'm dead. I can't seem to improve this portion personally
---
tbf rsgloryandgold didn't deserve what happened to him but hes still an asshole and a racist who's been banned multiple times on twitch
---
Imagine putting someone from the established top 6 in the worst tier lol. Hag should be near the top
---
Oohhhhh okay!!! I'm assuming gen rushing is turning on the boxes faster? :0 
---
I like to use the wraith but he's super slow so I feel pressed to keep people on the hooks :3
---
Nurse is bad on console, freddy and huntress are where there at based off of high rank matches and doctor sucks because he cannot prevent loops and hag needs prep time to be viable
---
Cross fingers for purchase with shards? Some of the other outfits that have released this chapter have been available for shards.
---
Fully agree, a good attitude and being able to brush the salt off and hop into the next one is crucial
---
Do you actually like being in red ranks? Your a madlad
---
Best perk art in the game, imo.
---
Doesn't seem like it. Hopefully they'll add it at a later time
---
Not a bad week imo, but no perks here that are particularly special. It ain't bbq, ruin, or pebble, but at least its something.
---
I want it too!! It's on one of her perks... But they haven't announced it AND it wasn't leaked.
---
So yes? At least at some point. I dount we'll get it when the DLC drops.
---
Oof try Wraiths transformation lol
---
Na I want her to have a nice red beautiful dress that she wears in multiple episodes
---
Look how they massacred my boy...
---
God stop being sixth-grade me
---
Yeah. It's one of her cosmetics already.
---
DLC tomorrow right?
---
2nd best girl?!?!?!
---
It's also the only one where the survivors fight back somewhat.
---
It is harder to pip in red ranks.
---
 "cruel confinement" on Google comes up with animal and prisoner abuse cases, they probably didn't want to be associated with that
---
I wish it downloaded a second client or put new shit into a new folder... it sadly just replaces stuff.
---
You won’t have to download as much (some files stay after you go back) but it’s still annoying
---
This is too vague to really give all them justice for a category. while the top ones are accurate, the bottom ones need to be put into specific ones because they're complicated
---
No.
---
Ugh. I want it! :c
---
&gt;How is seeing 1 person all the time better than seeing all 3 people whenever you want/need to?
---
Bc it's never enough to know the obsession is getting chased. Knowing *where* they are getting chased, what pallets they're dropping, where they're taking the killer. All of that information packed into an add-on that doesn't consume ur keys charge, meaning if the killer doesn't have Franklin's you can have a permanent global aura reveal on a Survivior. How fucking stupid are you to undervalue that? Especially as a soloq Survivior. 
---
I hover between red and purple rank as Survivior and information is how I made it there. If I had a global aura reveal on the obsession (there will always be one bc I always run Decisive) to carry around every game, I'd fucking JUMP at that chance.
---
Litterally just got billy lv 30 for enduring
---
That’s good!
---
No. The PTB for ST is tomorrow. The full dlc won't be released for a couple weeks.
---
And it’s only on pc
---
~sigh
---
How is a global aura reveal on the obsession that cannot reduce ur key charge useless?
---
Fuck keemstar, that dude is nothing but a has been poser looking for anything to get him some views and he is a straight up dickhead!
---
Blue. No, yel-- auuuuuuuugh!
---
Not really, but holy crap, the achievement for “left4dead” will be 100% easier
---
Sounds like an alarm clock lmao
---
Did you actually have noed active? They could’ve cleansed it or the totems.
---
Did the person flash in white? If yes, it was a Borrowed Time or Mettle of Man endurance effect
---
I reaaally hope this isn't intentional lol
---
They can’t leave with them if they are activated. If the traps are inactive the survivor can leave with it on.
---
It's like she lands a hit and then immediately warps to the next Survivior. 
---
It's like Legion, but actually good
---
Awesome!
---
Yep coming right after my girl miss Piggy. Big brain pig main.
---
Hail to the king, baby.
---
Mhm. It's alright though. Us console users can wait for the dlc just a bit longer.
---
I thought the doc comes out tomorrow too
---
Xbox? lol
---
Don't lie, how many of you looked at this and tried tilting your head back like that
---
Seems like they do forget, otherwise they'd buff over half of the useless perks in the game instead of 1 or 2 per chapter.
---
How? Left for dead shows the hatch, but you need to escape via the exit gates?
---
Oof yes I’ll have to his backstory is um interesting to say the least.
---
Ok so how do you activate them? I put them on shortly after the exit gates opened
---
Yup
---
Well knowing BHVR they know that the community will loose their shit for Biker Kate so most likely they'll make it Cells only while Jeff will probably be Shards.
---
Wheres his fucking nose
---
No he didn't flash. And yeah I made sure it was active the red totem was there and it was lit up in the bottom right corner. Maybe it was just a fluke.
---
You need to finish all gens singlehandedly and escape in general I believe. So w r o n g.
---
But Pug already plays this game?
---
Finally!
---
ya but the nea was not and nea and kate was honestly the best one in my opinion
---
I am wrong. You are right sir. Good show!
---
I'd love to see Detective's Hunch get the same QoL change Dark Sense just did...
---
This is strange that this is happening for all of you. I know for a fact that all of my friends and I keep everything when a killer DCs. Like it will say in the end-game that you lost everything but once you go back into the lobby you will still have it, including any pips u might have lost. That's what occurs for the people I play with, including myself.
---
I'd love to see Detective's Hunch get the same QoL change...
---
Yeah me too even as a huntress main this is too strong.
---
Let's not leave out Jeff.
---
At higher ranks you will never catch anyone without phasing :P She's just too slow and gets looped super easy if not using her power, just practice! Use her power a lot, at first you may be loosing survivors a lot but you get used to it \^\_\^
---
Head on is just on the shrine ma dude
---
Its face makes me think of corpse flowers
---
we're a rare breed lol
---
I play for the fucking salt
---
Thank you!  I won’t be on again tonight, but I’ll touch base when I’m on again...I’m JusticeWar247.
---
I can’t believe the killer is using NOEMG.
---
You could always just intentionally derank
---
I never go past purple/green ranks for the express purpose of that i can succeed using other killers and perk builds that aren’t meta so i can actually have fun
---
It was pretty amazing.
---
Even if she was to get nerfed those suggestions are shit lol
---
Damn it. I need to keep up with things like that. Didn't know he was a racist piece of shit.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a bit after the pedophile situation, I only learned about it this year don't beat yourself up about it
---
Spine chill exists bud.
---
I honestly think the exhaustion for the clowns and huntresses add ons should be reworked.  It was before you couldn’t get it back from running.
---
Fortnite has a shit ton wrong with it that a causal player couldn’t see at first glance. Shit, this community moans and bitches even more than the Fortnite community. He’s not whining just to whine
---
Yeah, really at the end of the day you win as long as you are having fun.
---
Awww, that's nice
---
I have thought about this. But I truly want to learn to get better at looping, mindgames, and in general. I felt such glory when I finally got to red ranks. But now I'm nothing more than sweating and frustrated anger. I literally just Mori'ed last game because "he had to do a challenge," which is fine, just frustrating it was me, you know? Just part of the learning curve I suppose.
---
Don’t use Urban Evasion
---
The demogorgon hates bright lights. Known fact
---
I’m talking about the hag. 
---
She and Freddy are on exactly the same level and people debate which one of them is 5th and which one is 6th
---
Update: It works!
---
Lol such low effort troll bait.  No way this is legit.  You're even more trash as a troll than you are as a player in the fictitious scenario you laid out in your post.
---
This isn't about whether it is a good idea or a bad idea.  It is about why it is(or was now) the way it is.  That was their decision making behind it.  That's it.  This isn't my thought process, this is theirs.
---
The whole disk allocation thing is so frustrating. It keeps jumping from 16mbps to 0. And after completing the whole download, it requires almost half an hour for allocating the files. I hate going back and forth.
---
There are some good youtubers with some tutorials like OhTofu that can help with looping. I’ve been rank 1 for a long time consistently and would say I’m good at looping (sorry not trying to brag) and what made me get better is watching people like N00b3 play the game and then trying to replicate their routes and their mindset while playing the game. I try not to be toxic but watching good loopers, videos, and playing a lot really helped me gain the knowledge and skill to run killers around way too long
---
I bought spirit. Have played a few matches and i love her.
---
Bare in mind this is a stereotype, nothing is set in stone and I understand not all meg mains are like this. It’s a meme and the sole intention is for this to be an exaggeration.
---
Welcome! Typically staying around a hooked survivor is bad. It gives the other 3 time to heal, repair, etc. sure you’ll get the sacrifice BP, but it’s kind of a dick move and you’re losing out on other BP potential... That being said if players are rushing the hook then that’s just poor play on their part. 
---
There are a few tactics on both sides that are considered unsportsmanlike, but just watch this subreddit for a day or two and your bound to see a complaint about each of them!
---
It’s Quentin Byers from strange street
---
Thank you. That’s really neat.
---
Sorry about that. Don't get why they'd feel that way though. Just a quick way to have a dead game in my opinion.
---
I have no idea how you have fun against Legion or Pig. They're my least favorites to play against BY FAR.
---
Well BHVR would be right.. I reeaalllyyy want biker Kate! Thanks
---
Yeah. Wedding Ring not channeling (no confirmation on this that I know of) makes it a little better, but do I really want to know the location of the obsession? Especially if it's a blendette crouching in a corner? I mean, less likely to be the obsession is nice...but a lot of obsession perks would rather you not be the obsession.
---
Yes , noobs are in fact carried by noed , thanks for reminding us
---
Doesn't stop it but it dodges the hit still so you'll be ok either way
---
WE'VE BEEN BLESSED
---
only took em a few years
---
how’d u make ur survalience pink
---
Ignore, probably just Nea.
---
the man behind the slaughter
---
Quentin tried to do that, although then again, they didn’t have his likeness to begin with.
---
The demogorgon is hollow confirmed? Like a jack o lantern!
---
Yeah, it was changed pretty quickly after release if I remember, a month or 2 maybe?  And the reason it has taken so long to actually have a real party system is because their original build was never meant to have such a thing.  So what we got was basically just a hack job of at well, least we got it in the game.  Maybe shouldn't have taken as long as 3 years, but they had their priorities else where, deserving or not.
---
The best move would be to wait for the heal, then try to rip them out really fast. They’ll use their DS for the match, and waste a heal. (Getting ripped out of a locker injures you)
---
custom icon pack
---
The streamer is AutumnRobot btw. If you check her latest broadcast and skip to 1 hr and 17 min in, you’ll be able to see the whole match. 
---
Seems the killer was a dev on the BHVR team.
---
It’s a samination dead by daylight parody inside joke, if you wanna understand it watch those
---
I actually tend to find that whenever someone is new, the game spawns them near the killer. It has been the case for me and all the people I have introduced to the game. I don't know what it is but is just happens.
---
Yes! Confirmed! Bite into him like a big chocolate!
---
This was me not 4 years ago
---
If they’re running you around for a while why not just leave them and go find someone else? Best way to counter looping imo
---
You were extremely close to him. Even a no lunge swing wouldn't have missed
---
Damn, that dog sure can give good   S U C C
---
I haven’t looked at the PTB, can someone please clarify the shadow demons for me?
---
Exactly
---
People forget SWF is people fucking around with their friends
---
Like 9/10 times SWF are easier than solo queuers who are average
---
I feel like gens should be more challenging or remotely dangerous when doing them. IMO I think M1’ing for 2 minutes is boring and superbly easy to do once you consistently land great skill checks after a lot of practice. And fixed Quentin’s face, his meth face scares the children.
---
Actually in this case it wasn't, this describes how no one says anything, but the swf in chat just insults people out of nowhere. Don't just spam r/uselessnobody everytime you see one being used.
---
This was in the game before dedicated servers too. Saw a clip on here a long time ago of someone getting a four piece headshot and insta downing everyone
---
Yeah, it doesn't sound terribly useful outside of SWF. And if you're already SWFing then it's massively less useful for the experienced players who can already communicate where they're looping the killer lol.
---
That said, I think it's very likely that it's just BHVR being inconsistent with their wording and that it will also be a channeling add-on, furthering its worthlessness.
---
I don't mind the wait. I love the game and hoping it continues to get bigger though I'm wondering how long they will continue adding characters.
---
Wraith, I played the game from it's start and he was always the coolest imo. I love the combo of windstorm + shadow dance
---
&gt;Is it not the objective to keep all survivors and killers playable at red ranks
---
Nope.
---
They could do it like American horror story except every season a new killer/survivor story
---
Console players here, anyone know if we can edit our load outs/access blood-web while searching for games while swf?
---
Since you’ve been gone
---
Why do you hate Meg mains? Stop avoiding the question.
---
Quick and Quite
---
:(
---
also low rank neas
---
Invite me to play with you.
---
Waiting for the heal wastes time, and Head On was fixed to have a full stun zone for the entirety of the animation.
---
I was also gunna pair it with Adrenaline in case the last gen pops and you need a quick escape, but IDK if the adrenaline waits until you're out of the locker, it probably doesn't.
---
Me at Texas Roadhouse
---
I haven't gotten the exhaustion-causing bug since the last PTB which is why I figured it's a 'new' bug.  Or maybe it's the same old one that they broke again. It just doesn't feel this buggy on live.
---
Couldn’t agree more.
---
Out of all the survivors it’s who I see Tbag the most when I either get stuns or at a common I can’t avoid and whenever I’m in an swf they’re toxic as hell. But again it’s a stereotype and not supposed to be taken seriously.
---
Yeah. It’d be a really risky play, but the survivor would be absolutely rekt if it worked. Not much else you could do if you reach the locker after they have head on ready.
---
quite what?
---
As killer? No. As a solo survivor? Yes, it at least gives me a better chance of getting teammates who are experienced enough to get there, in some shape or form, they should know how to play the game well. You still get your occasional potatoes, but it beats the other ranks.
---
it always shows the obsession without even using the key power
---
Stress? Here's a thought, people who get stressed over a video game could always just, ya know, not play it, instead of complaining and getting stressed over a video game. Alternatively, they could git gud, but that's too hard.
---
No, I don't give a damn about the random people I match against in a PvP game, the objective is to win not ask if they feel okay and cater to their precious feelings, so they can all eat my bag and so can you trash puppy.
---
Tbh survivors are just skins when you’ve unlocked all the perks so it makes no difference cuz every character does that.
---
More than likely yeah.
---
He had a gaming chair.
---
I feel like every game that I feel was good personally had the entity displeased, and vice versa. Like if I made some sick calls with Nurse and managed to down all 4 survivors with 4 generators left to go, I shouldn't be getting -1 or safety pip just because I didn't get enough chase time.
---
You won’t be saying that when I bring pharmacy and botany knowledge. Oh I forgot to mention prove thyself. But no I’m useless I possibly can’t be useful when all my perks are team based.

---
Exactly what I was thinking, make them travel in a group and either have the ability to send them to go do something or make it like the doctor with his modes
---
He had a gaming chair!
---
Its not about that. I get into the really low ranks and it just blows. Teammates suck and the killers are too easy.
---
On killer I'm rank 20 and slaughtering baby Dwight's and Megs is demoralizing/boring.
---
I’m sorry p3 Quentin I’m sorry the bad man hurt your feelings.
---
Ooo, rank 17, such an improvement, it’s literally three pips, it’s almost impossible not to pip
---
I wouldn't recommend bringing a Mori when and if you go against her. She would probably disconnect. Still worth a shot though if you have a bunch of them laying around
---
I give it an E for effort
---
got killed by a plague didn’t ya
---
I mean, I wasn’t trying to offend people who use NOED. I just thought the elephant looked like a baby so I called it a baby killer. I’m sorry if I offended you.
---
The fact that you think that the Hag has no map pressure proves that you know nothing about her. That's literally her thing. 110% movement speed doesn't matter because the Hag is one of the only killer who doesn't actively chase survivors. She completely nullifies loops and forces survivors to run to the next one. Hag is easily in the top 4 or 5 killers in the game, even on console.
---
Also works for "when the killer camps you but all your teammates escape"
---
"I feel like Dwight would love a Locker build."
---
So this is what they've been preparing for.
---
I'm assuming as long as the game has interest and there is a profit.  But they'll eventually get bored of the project and/or come up with an idea for a sequel, whatever that may be.
---
Nope, this just isnt true at all in the slightest, they planned swf from the very beginning
---
happened to me too. loaded in with the pre-match UI still visible, could still hover over offerings to see which ones were used. couldn't move, had to DC.
---
I’d swap legion and wraith, and Ghostface and Clown other than that it’s spot on
---
Quiet, my bad.
---
This made me laugh way to hard because its true!
---
I thought a chapter drop on a season reset I could be completely wrong and it’s just random but if it’s the 17th coolio
---
no problem haha, i was just poking fun, no grammar nazi-ness intended
---
She cannot nullify pallet loops nor can she apply map pressure without using mintrag and her ability his nullified by crouching. The fact that you think hag is top 5 proves you know nothing about her.
---
Haha, glad I’m glad I could make you laugh :D
---
Welcome to the group.
---
Why people think im being sarcastic , hello ?
---
"Good" is an understatement, it was just old decisive strike 2.0
---
I agree, that's why I wish they'd have every survivor (at least from now on) say something. Even go back and give the original characters voices, maybe not Laurie and Quentin.
---
Yo no mither is a crutch perk I mean seriously the ability to infinitely revive yourself? Crutch perk 100%
---
is teleporting not enough pressure? how is trapper better than her? his traps can be spotted from miles away, even in tall grass, oh and they can get deactivated. if everyone’s crouching everywhere that’s enough pressure, how is legion better than her?
---
D A R K S O U L S Q U E N T I N
---
i get consistent 4ks in rank 5
---
Bitches about deranking, admits to DC ragequitting.
---
????
---
DO you know who OchiDO is?
---
Ok now Take OchiDO multiply it by 300 and you have roughly half of what Keem* is.
---
Trying to not feed your opponent in a PvP game is toxic? Okay.
---
It still looks like taped on straw from the back, just with more volume now, maybe Laurie found some shampoo
---
This has been how DC’s worked on PS4 since launch. If killer closes app (console version of alt-4) instead of traditionally pressing leave, it causes the survivors to lose their data, points, items, and offerings.
---
AHOY, Creatures of the the night!
---
Well than, I guess I'm wrong.  Can't hate on me for something that happened 3 years ago lol.  I remember it sure feeling like it was because everyone was bitching about it.  Can't believe it fucking took them over 2 years to say something, like fucking hell behavior.
---
Going against/with Quentin’s is definitely a rarity due to how ugly the poor boy is, but I never had an issue with the players. They’re typically just gen jockeys/totem sluts imo. It’s super interesting you play with so many shitty Quentin’s, though.
---
Maybe deep down in the laboratories of BHVR they’re calling out the dumbasses in the game to play Quentin.
---
That doesn’t contradict my point tho.
---
I know it's like a personal opinion thing, but man I think it looks way worse
---
why tho? she was pretty well balanced, she DEFINETLY didn’t need a buff, maybe quicker reload if anything, that’s bs
---
Closer to [r/antimeme](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) tbh.
---
Sorry but literally anyone with any knowledge with the game will tell you hag is top 5. It’s pretty well agreed on that it goes. Nurse, Spirit then Billy. Next is mostly always huntress or hag
---
They really need to get rid of rage quitters somehow
---
It's been like, idk, maybe two years since i last played... Stayed on this sub to keep track on the news but nothing really made me reinstall, now this minor update makes me want to play again
---
It wasn't. I can't land a hit with those so I've given up lol
---
That’s not a new change. It’s a bug involving hitreg. See, when a hatchet hits the head, it somehow counts that as two hits. As for the multiple target hitting, that’s because he hatchet projectile is bugged in a way that doesn’t make it despawn the moment it makes contact with something or someone, but rather persists for about half a second more.
---
You can't buy licensed killers with shards, need to spend real coin
---
Don’t tell me you just said a samination reference
---
It benefits them, but it would run everybody else's experience.

---
I should have specified for a more meme type build. Babysitter I think would be the better helper to deliverance than borrowed time but I'm not actually sure about that
---
I really want to play doctor but the bully its to strong, fucking devs buff doc
---
Hell ya!
---
Are you the flash? you literally commented faster than the screen could change for me lmao
---
It’s my time to shine!
---
Hey give the sleepy boi some love he looks like a train hit him after the last meth rehab.
---
Oh that is dont go to happen I play in ps4
---
What’s the change?
---
FMHachet
---
Lol my entire life is this subreddit/game, so I'm always here
---
I remember when I started playing as legion without any cool perks, so i just threw noed in there. The post game chats were quite the cool place :')
---
Bite the curb, Laurie!
---
AppStore does not have dbd on there hmmmm
---
&gt;Just like your theory about the blinks , reaching red ranks its just the tip of the iceberg, theres a huge skill gap within rank 1 alone.
---
I don't understand why it's so important for you to assume I'm bad at the game.  Whatever, I'm not engaging on this point anymore.  
---
&gt;I know pleeeeeenty of people that got 4ks without EVER playing nurse like EVER.
---
Need a lot of context for this statement to mean anything.
---
&gt;Play nurse or spirit is a garanteed 4k.
---
No, it's not.  That's just stupid to say.  I understand your overall point about Nurse being easy to learn, I disagree but I at least understand why you think that.  This statement here though is purely idiotic.  Are Spirit and Nurse the strongest killers in the game?  Yes.  Are they guaranteed 4k?  No.  Stop mixing hyperbole with argument.
---
&gt;a friend of mine 4k'd his very first game, against all 4 rank 1 survivors.. on fucking rotten fields.
---
No, they didn't.
---
&gt;Nurse has a skill associated with her sure but its veeeeeery simple to use, way too easy, her power is absolutely broken as well.
---
That's just not true, not a single one of those statements.  Her power is not simple to use, it's not easy, and it's not broken.  If you want to argue that her range add-ons or her extra blink add-ons are broken because they give her too much recovery potential, sure, i don't necessarily agree, but I think it's a reasonable position.  Arguing that her base power is broken is simply incorrect.  You can play mindgames with the Nurse, they're just not the same kind of mindgames you play with other killers.
---
&gt;My point being for such a powerful and broken killer she should be way harder to use, maybe not 3 hours but you shouldnt be able to do what she does not even with 3k imo. 
---
I could not disagree more with this statement.  Obviously this is a difference of opinion here, I'm not trying to pass this off as objectively true, because this starts to get into the question of why you play Dead by Daylight.  But I see this as a survival/horror game.  And it's legitimately sad to me that in a survival/horror game where the roster of killers includes serial killers, supernatural humanoid monsters, and a literal dream demon, there are only 2 killers that actually frighten survivors.  I think the Nurse's power level should be the base power level for all killers, that way the game would actually feel scary instead of feeling like Loop and Pallet-Kicking Simulator.  But, of course, some people just loving looping.  I don't know why, I can't imagine what's fun about that, but it's what some people want out of the game.  For me, I would vastly prefer if all the killers were actually scary and posed a threat to even the best survivors.
---
You know, under her mask, Susie is always smiling. She’s definitely enjoying being a killer.
---
Alright guys. I got Overcharge and ruled out Head On. What should I get?
---
Urban Evasion or Enduring?
---
left behind lets you see hatch at 32 meters, dark sense pops on every gen (not just yours) dying light i don’t quite get but for every hook as long as obsession is alive you get stacks that adds up to what dying light is rn, is deactivated if obsession dies.

---
Eh it's only 12 billion BP, that's only like a quarter of the amount you need to level up all the characters. You'll make it back in a few years!
---
Bubba. He just wants to protect his family, even if it means slicing a man or two into pieces.
---
Reminds me of when people used to make them name "freddy = DC" to bait the killer to play ad freddy (before the rework)
---
As a ghostface main I definitely tunnel these guys down because I literally can't use my power against them
---
Everyone does
---
I mean, not everyone plays it how you think. They could be talking about something else entirely, it’s not that hard to discuss something different to what is currently happening. For example: A friend and I were playing today, all we really exchanged was who the killer was and when we thought we were gonna go down. We mainly spoke about other games we were planning on playing together. The information we exchanged would be found out inevitably and so it didn’t really give much of an advantage. Not everyone treats the game that seriously, just chill.
---
I didn’t think you were being sarcastic per say. When you said thanks for reminding us I thought you got annoyed at the post. I apologize if I misunderstood.
---
IM SO EXCITED !!!
---
It clearly says public test build on the screen..
---
I had an idea of future maps having more dynamic events happening as you finish generators. Not too long ago I posted a map idea on the cruise ship in where one of the areas of the map in the boiler room there would be steam pipes that could stun a survivor or killer if they run by at the wrong time. Another map idea Im working on would have a forest fire that progressively gets worse as the generators are getting done with falling trees that would force killers and survivors to react quickly while in chase. Maybe just an entirely new map engine instead of just flat maps along with new game modes.
---
ME TOO LMAOO i was confused for a sec
---
I have like 50 of those anniversary cakes on him so I have yet to use a single offering that isn't that with him
---
I’ve had this happen a few too many times! Hella annoying! The last time it happened I would leap off the edge and it would put me back into the map on the other side of the door haha
---
Is... is that quote from Steve talking about getting women to like you...?
---
The entity is displeased
---
It's a good comment. I made an exit.
---
Oops my bad I honestly knew his name just wasn’t paying attention. Thanks my guy! 🙏
---
What map?
---
People hate killers that you have to play differently against so good on you
---
They said it would when it preps it's pounce move
---
Dark Sense is pretty good, Left Behind seems kind of useless imo.
---
 Yeah it’ll help you find the hatch but like 8/10 my experiences the killer always closes it the second it opens unfortunately.
---
Bro that would be sick and really unnerving when doing a gen with teammates. 😳
---
It’s a perk icon
---
The hit boxes are just enormous spheres, but hey, at least they are consistent, You can play around them.
---
I'm looking forward to trying a Better Together/Prove Thyself combo.
---
you're fighting the entire DBD community at this point. google any tierlist from bigger streamers/youtubers that's up to date and see for yourself

Well that gave me a smile :) Just don't feel the need to apologise for having an opinion is all. Appreciate the positive energy you're putting out.

Exactly- there are definitely some cosmetics we haven’t seen yet. At the very least; Steve and Nancy’s default variations, this outfit for Nancy, and Steve’s Babysitter outfit (I’m imagining, since that’s also a perk icon). I’m calling more, though.
---
*Please H2018 Myers I’m dying over here BHVR.*
---
steve is quentin. just a few years from now. after all the partying catches up.
---
Why? The killer has to be close for BT, if they’re close, no scratch marks probably isnt going to save them
---
Bruh why you rule out the ones that you cant get for free
---
Cruel “limits” is now only 24 meters
---
Surge is now only 24 meters, and although it works with overcharge and pop, they’ve said they plan to remove that.
---
Babysitter got buffed. It’s 30 seconds but works in terror radius.
---
Basically:
---
They nerfed already weak killer perks
---
The actually weak survivor perks were left the same, in favor of bugging the already good perk (I just want fixated to work while injured!)
---
Bro those were all here past weeks, there is nothing special left
---
Not sure how you think you’re contributing with this comment then ¯_(ツ)_/¯
---
Aw awsome! And alright, I’ll keep that in my mind dude. Thank you :)
---
Just down the hook rushers?
---
I think its funny to see the killers reaction to it. I mean obviously they won but just the sheer confusion is hilarious as well Haha. I think it just sucks because you technically won but it's not going to give you the win lol
---
I had an idea for a random perk mode.
---
The survivors and killers all start the match without perks.
---
There are 16 boxes around the map each with a random perk that survivors can open up to 4 of.
---
The killer gets a random perk for each Unique survivor that they hook.
---
I figure this would help keep matches more interesting rather than everyone running the meta perks every damn match.
---
I will never get back the time I just spent watching this.
---
I stay around in case I need to bodyblock for an incoming survivor
---
Good point actually but considering leakers managed to datamine the add-ons and this icon it's very unlikely
---
LOL you don't understand what generalizing is. This is reddit, not my thesis. You take things so literally in an attempt to "win" a reddit argument or like I said because you have Asperger's.
---
Feel free to provide the information you have showing how many players each platform have. Pc you can easily check. Xbox and PS4? You have absolutely no way. You are just pulling numbers out of your ass
---
Amazing!
---
What platform you on?
---
I'm rank 2 with legion and get consistent 4ks it means nothing.
---
Ultra-rare shouldn't be overpowered or game breaking, it should be a unique change to the game. This is an interesting addition.
---
rancor perk
---
I was hoping someone had said this. I thought the same thing lol.
---
Rancor
---
yep 17 is the guess. the 24th seems too far into the month to be mid-month
---
Yeah you are the idiot. The downvotes can clearly show that. Without swf this game would be dead. Thats facts. Solo queuing is horrible. Most SWF dont talk about the game, sweating through their ears. Most swf just want to enjoy a game with their mates. Just cause you got bullied a few times by a swf doesnt mean all swf are op. Most swf are too altruistic and lead to a ez game.
---
It wasnt even that strong yet they nerfed it, sigh
---
So dramatic! I love it! 
---
If this was the chase music for him I would be so scared.
---
While it doesn't seem all that great of an add on, I'm excited for them to add more add ons and maybe items into the game.
---
I've always wanted an add on for firecrackers, maybe you carry more than one in, maybe longer blind shorter fuse. But new add ons coming into the game are great.
---
Headshots can instadown.
---
Remove the piercing, tbh, and it would be a great Huntress buff. She's already gonna take a hit from dedicated servers, and it rewards well aimed throws.
---
Shadow men?
---
they're actually the best. the killer is too disgusted by its face to chase them for long enough
---
Twas a joke, guess survivors dont take too kindly to them.
---
I doubt it
---
But not every swf plays in a way that provides this advantage, not every team communicates every little detail of what’s happening on their end to the people they are on comms with. Some people just want to play a game they like with people they like, it’s that simple.
---
What they said lol Rancor. I like it so I can toy with my obsession and hopefully get a free kill at the end.
---
Yeah, they same way the tested ghostface internally right? Remember him in his ptb? Let's not pretend like bhvr actually knows how to play their game
---
There’s gotta be some dbd fans out there. They at least play on Xbox and ps4. I’m just saying, queue matching wouldn’t change on a specific platform. There’s players, yeah. Doesn’t mean how many players use one console to play the game doesn’t mean it would change any of that or just because there’s so many players there it would "queue faster". Try responding with a respectful comment next time.
---
There's a video by PainReliver showing you the exact moment to time it. I suggest you look it up on youtube
---
what?? killers arent supposed to be nice! so thats the doctor's personality when u actually talk to him. survivors should just talk to killers more often instead of screaming at them
---
Plague needs to be nerfed. You're right.
---
Wow man, I’m a killer main &gt;:(
---
Did they put this at all in the patch notes? I don’t recall..
---
Shh stop you're using logic now
---
Dc husks?
---
I really love this!! 😍
---
Very nicely done.
---
Shes not bad on console, just a lot harder to get used to on console, ive gone up against a few really good nurses on consoles
---
Cujo! :D
---
What do you propose then
---
You mean Boo?
---
Nice! I suggest not leveling up discordance. As it gives more info at level one. The whiteness stays less, so you can tell if the survivors are still on it when time expires
---
Best part of the PTB so far. Too bad it still takes 10 years to find a match.
---
Thank you. I have one of survivor
---
I had to because the first thing that popped into my head was a this verse from 5 years ago
---
Remember that unbreakable is god tier on everyone except Bill
---
My body is ready.
---
Head On FTW!
---
Eh never really go for that
---
They probably won't ever buff  sabotage to where it was during the perk use of it as it just made playing killer unbearable and just a slug fest making matches boring and if they added it back to where it was now it's would just be no mither galore.
---
Really? You don't ever react vocally when the killer is chasing you when you're in comms with your friends? Not even "oh man, he's chasing me!" lol
---
Honestly, I really don't take the game that seriously. I have fun, win lose or disconnect (not me.) I just find it really funny that something so obviously unbalanced as this implementation of a party system can evoke such hostility if someone dare criticizes it. I post a single dissenting view and people start hurling insults at me. The very notion that *SWF groups with comms* possibly promotes toxicity, has people responding with toxicity. lol I mean look at how long this thread is.
---
People are going to LOSE THEIR MIND if BHVR finally adds some sort of in-game radius-based comms system. The thing I fear is that people will disregard it and continue to use discord or something because it's become a crutch for so many people.

I got 75% of one and 75% of the other and played another one np
---
It was, they nerfed to the ground tho. Flashlight saves now have to be timed perfectly and are super hard.
---
You are wrong as fuck. Shes a top tier killer even on console.
---
As far as i'm concerned it isn't. may be but I only started playing very late last year
---
During chases, the furthest I’ll go is “yeah I’m taking a hit here” or “I’m going down” or the occasional “he missed/ oh that hit me but it shouldn’t have” all of which can be can be learned from the bottom left corner of the screen by me having the injured, healthy or dying symbol around my name. As I said, not all people take advantage of it and I’m sure many others like myself aren’t taking it seriously enough to be like “stunned him, oh yeah that’s definitely enduring” or “the Myers is approximately 7.6372 metres behind me I can continue the loop, so get on a gen”.
---
I do think that you shouldn’t receive any form of hostility for a dissenting opinion though, comment sections for something like a video game can get like that sometimes even though it’s important to discuss things. I do also agree that swf can provide an unfair advantage and potentially ruin the experience of a killer but as I’ve said not everyone takes it as seriously as some others. 
---
But yeah, I’m not sure how well a radius communication feature would work because as you said there are ways around it like discord, it’s unlikely that everyone will be happy with how comms will work in this game but not everyone can be pleased.
---
nah thats the side POV of koichis pose
---
Trash take? I actually don’t know what that means in the context.
---
And the only legions that would do that are bad legions that don’t use their power properly, or if there’s no other survivors around. Also, while killers can pressure you in certain directions or angles, ultimately it’s your place on the map and which corners you decide to loop that really define where the chases lead. Unless you have literally no pallets, or are physically stuck in a hallway, you can always steer towards different routes, especially when first hit by a basic attack or Legion’s power.
---
They explained it tho. They did a few last minute changes cuz he felt too strong and had no time to test them (and it ended up being very terrible)
---
your Comments have no structure and make no sense
---
Thats why i love it so much haha
---
Broooooo
---
It's not shards was leaked awhile ago .
---
I mean I also stay just in case I need to save the last survivor. She can't know you're on the hatch and not getting chased.
---
So much this.
---
Rancor is more useful than you think imo. Gen gets done I know where their last locations were and if its right next to a gen I just port there. Plus I get to toy around with my obsession after i figure out who it is, and get that free kill at the end. I do agree that pgtw is a nice perk but for my playstyle it just never really did much for me. Almost everybody tells me to go with that perk lol
---
It is what it is🤷‍♂️
---
&gt;Nurse is bad on console
---
So you Basicly fought 1 nurse in his lifetime then and said: "NURSE IS USELESS!" Nurses fuck people up heavily. 
---
&gt;doctor sucks because he cannot prevent loops
---
Incorrect. Use your ability. It stops all actions for a few seconds. 
---
&gt;hag needs prep time to be viable
---
She doesnt really need prep time, she just needs a good player with good trap placements. The traps take like 1 sec to put down so its not like it takes a year to put down traps.
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted. "Tactical Disconnects" are completely uncounterable for the killer currently.
---
They plan to add husks which would solve it.
---
In terms of "Don't be sweaty and slug for the 4K" that's such a bullshit argument. That can be twisted in all sorts of ways, like how about survivors not being sweaty and yanking the cord? It's completely uncounterable. 
---
I get it being slugged sucks and waiting 4 minutes to either bleed out or be hooked is boring, but I at least get some enjoyment out of it as the survivor: If I can crawl away and manage to bleed out before the killer can hook me (Looking for the last guy, comes back to hook me, etc.) I can take my "Small victory" and BP. 
---
And I don't see his "Rarely." I see it often, usually right after I down the second to last survivor (2 dead, I find the third and down him) so I'm not even "Slugging" yet. 
---
If it's that boring go browse the subreddit, make a sandwich, etc. Four minutes isn't long. Fuck it, why not bring Unbreakable then? That's some counterplay! Survivors just need to *adapt*. I'm saying that half-jokingly but it's true! If you brought unbreakable, and get slugged for the 4K and haven't used it yet, you can get yourself up!
---
Im extremely confused....
---
I 100% think this is a good idea and support this. Been playing killer since there were only the three original boys and dicing has always been something that pissed me off and messed with the game.
---
The new meta will be very anti-hex for killers.
---
Nope shes not as good as she is on PC you may have a hard on for her but shes just not as good as her goddess tier PC counterpart
---
I’m just saying. How would moving to a different console solve their impatience with queues.
---
Lol my first game was awful, shelter woods against GF
---
First hit on me was when i threw a pallet on his noggin and he still hit me through the pallet
---
&gt;  Surely theres a middle ground somewhere
---
I think the middle ground exists already. I love (both as a survivor, **and** as the killer) when the hook gets sabotaged *RIGHT* when the victim is about to get hooked. Then, if the other nearby hook was 99%'d, that one also gets sabo'd right before the hook.
---
It's ultra rare moments like that, that I love about DBD. It seems that as it is, it's the main purpose for sabo.
---
Imaginary internet points mean nothing...  this is my opinion and it's perfectly ok if you disagree. You're (and others) the ones getting all salty and resorting to personal insults, DMing me, etc... 
---
But anyway, it was fun while it lasted but this has gone on entirely too long for a topic that honestly doesn't bother me that much in life. (I've just been reply to messages as they come because people keep replying.)
---
again, more players=shorter queues
---
Everybody tells me to go with pgtw, I dont know, I agree its a good perk but with my playstyle it just never really seemed helpful for me personally. I might buy it off the shrine if it appears again and I might have to try getting it teachable someday, but for now I gotta prepare for the dlc, a glorious feast of perks is about to fall upon us lol
---
They gotta take that shit out. Just put the little plus signs lower and remove them
---
I don't like convos that last 30 secs ( cries ) :(
---
I think instead of breaking the hook a fully sabotaged hook will increase the timer but only for the first time a survivor is hooked on it
---
Definitely not. If the hook recovery is too long it's too strong if it's too little then it's bad. Sabotaging a main way of progressing the killers objective can never really be balanced plus sabotaging really isn't a central game mechanic at all it's just something that you can do like search chests
---
You are still wrong. You either dont know how to play her or you are trolling. Shes equally good if not better if you know how to use her on console. Also by what do you base this "shes just worse on console" part on? What does she lack on console?
---
you also have to realize that nancy's perk (afaik) uses any totem, right? It's not contingent on cleansing a hex
---
whats wrong with him giving the game exposure?
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T LOOP HER AROUND A PALLET 5 TIMES????
---
That was gnarly
---
One of my all time favourite scp's.
---
I know there's no set list and it varies on add-ons + the person playing, but is there a tentative tier list for the killers? Like I know Bubba is in one of the worst spots at the moment and that the Nurse is strong in the right hands, but how do the other killers fit in? 
---
Thanks for any help!
---
Whats PBT?
---
If the servers go out like this, I'm probably taking another break
---
I never understood the hate for doctor. He's not even that good and Ive had people honestly tell me they'd rather face nurse or spirit.
---
Ngl it’s still kind of a banger tho
---
Goro enters...
---
Who is this guy?
---
The authentic Doctor experience.
---
Try Dead Before Sunrise:Horror.  It’s on the app store!
---
This happened today to a Dwight on xbox. 2 of us got out and one was healing by the exit. Kate got out at the last second.Poor Dwight got killed by the timer next to the hatch.
---
Yup. 1 gen left to go, 3 survivors left. 2 were on hooks.
---
The last one had at least one hook rescue that they could have grabbed, if not both. I was off hunting for him pretty far from either hook.
---
Good to know
---
Input delays hold her back
---
LOLOL I can just tell from the way you write that girls don't like you. Don't worry, you'll find some chubby bland girl one day who will settle for you.
---
I hope you find someone as well, cheers.
---
Goblin mutant vs normal actor.
---
It’s weird that people are just now reacting to this when I’m pretty sure this has been a thing for a while. Also head shots can insta down. Wasn’t this a thing??
---
&gt;
---
Treatment mode slows you down, charging the shock slows you down even more, and hitting them stuns them for 2 secs.
---
The slow down isnt enough for you to lose too much momentum.
---
Oh I see gotcha
---
So Close Yet So Far
---
But out of 5 and slowly lowering numbers and higher percentages, what are the chances that at any time someone will cleanse it? It’s up to the killer to decide that, truthfully.
---
What upsets me is u have a chainsaw and u didnt use it in a moment like this
---
ptb...
---
congratulations you have singlehandedly made the worst tier list i’ve seen so far
---
Not unless someone realizes NOED or Ruin is active. I’ve surprised people with NOED before too
---
Weird, because I could download it from there
---
Do they have the new survivors on there?
---
Yes, 100% free
---
But it’s still in beta...
---
I will buy every feng cosmetic regardless of quality, but holy shit this one is lacking, maybe it’ll look better in game, idk
---
Thanks, I hope you can too.
---
Or when your teammates 3 gen and you almost got the gen done and he comes and kicks it with pop goes the weasel
---
Sorry? What do I need to get through?
---
maybe they could reduce sabo time, but make it so hook breaks after one state, and the survivor is automatically rescued
---
The people saying it is pretty good are wrong. All it does is reveal hatch in radius when you're the last survivor. Problem is you waste a perk slot for it, theres no guarantee you will get the hatch, and the goal should be to escape through the gates with your survivor buddies making perks for helping this cause much better. If youre going meme builds or just want a hatch build or a build that focuses purely on your own survival then maybe it could be considered decent.
---
They’re the _real_ new killers.
---
It happened again.. first I get bbq &amp; chili and then 2 days later on the shrine, then I finish hag and Myers and their perks are in the shrine and now after I finished doc and am halfway through finishing billy this happens.
---
Someone burned one in a game yesterday when the ptb dropped...we ended up at ironworks.
---
ah yes it's all coming together...
---
That doctor cosmetic is amazing.
---
That's so cool! I'll take one of Michael Myers and one Lauri Strode! 👌
---

True, so I'm sure that was their intention.
---
Developing AI is not as easy. Look at EA DICE. Star Wars Battlefront II has one of the worst AI ever implemented in a AAA game and they had the resources to make it good. 
---
Even the developers of F13 Game said they couldn't code Jason to be like a player and instead focused on the counselors survivors which are also pretty bad. It wouldn't come close to playing a real game. They didn't have the tutorial when I started playing, but I've played it and it's good enough to teach you the basics. 
---
You can learn a lot just playing daily for a few hours, even with bad teammates.
---
classy
---
yeah? they’re still at d? that doesn’t in your logic of the tier make them significantly better than him _like they actually are_
---
Ashy Slashy, meet Seeya Nea.
---
Never thought I see this reference here.... I love you and be safe in the fog
---
Dying Light really reinforces StBfL now since you don't want your obsession anymore, and its not a perk that requires you to tunnel anymore.
---
Doesn't mean it's a good thing. Ed Wood deliberately used cheap art design in his movies. He is now regarded as worst director of all time. I don't get why people using 'its their thing' as defence. A horrible thing is still horrible. Downvote me all the weebs want, it doesnt change the fact, it looks off putting.
---
Smaller player base.

Are we supposed to take your side when you sent an unsolicited message intending to incite the other person??
---
Huntress has the mind of a child
---
It kinda looks like you sent a salt message and are retroactively playing the joke card. Obvs I dunno the situation tho. 
---
All I can say is if you were joking, people send/get a LOT of shitty hate messages on console over the tiniest little things so I don’t really blame this person for not assuming you were messing around.
---
Idk why you got downvoted this is just a joke
---
And now I need to make the killers and survivors in Little Big Planet.
---
I hope people will stop posting these, some day
---
*Nervously laughs running Deliverence, Borrowed Time, Were Gonna Live Forever and Mettle of Man*
---
That... doesn't make any sense. They revealed an idea for a perk, and they changed the perk to be not as good as it was. They nerfed it. Skipping the "live" state doesnt mean it wasn't nerfed. It's also not a big deal, as we shouldn't care until live release. But to say it wasn't nerfed is just silly.
---
You not only started it, but escalated it farther than it’s worth.
---
Yet another post about this so sick of seeing this 10 times a day
---
Most likely explanation:
---
Theres probably a small ass amount of people playing on console so expect to be going against the same people alot
---
*happiness noises*
---
I do love the head on saves and i like adept acheivement hunting but similar to everything else it just gets very stale after a while and I wish the game would have more dynamic elements instead of being forced to come up with creative ways to play yourself.
---
I totally understand that but I was only trying to make a joke about it to them. But they were just being  rude and I have no right to be rude back so you don’t really have to side to me
---
Kinda wish they still left the old speed boost on there too, I used it to 1v1 practice with my bro lol
---
So how do people have the perks?
---
Dude acting like swf gives PTSD.
---
I haven't heard of Tofu before, I'm definitely willing to check his videos out, thank you! I have been an avid watcher of No0b3 and I agree, emulating his play style with looping has helped out tremendously.
---
I also definitely want to spend some time focusing on pallet spawns at certain locations, pallet management,  and L/T walls as well. I have NEVER been a fan of Balanced Landing even as a Nea main, and have always opted for Sprint Burst. But maybe I'll change my mindset.
---
Even if this was intentional which i doubt it was, it’s only a nerf to baby spirits, actual good spirits will not be affected by this at all.
---
LOST TO THIS MONSTER

Okay think of it from my perspective:

I loved jojo since the 90's and no one talked about it at all except one other person in my life. then 2015 rolls around and all of a sudden the whole internet is talking about something I thought no one even knew existed.

---
Tiers work like this
---
S-can easily get 4ks, are good in loops, and can end chases quickly
---
A-can get 4ks easier than most killers but not guaranteed all the time, are decent loops and may require mind gaming, and can end chases if they strategize.
---
B-have to strategize more to earn 4ks, can be looped but can also be a anti-loop, and can end chases if they are smart.
---
C-4ks are difficult and require planning on how to get players sacrificed, are easy to loop and can struggle on most loops, and cannot end chases quickly without proper planning.
---
D-4ks are possible but extremely hard and requires a build to be viable, struggle the most with loops as their kit is limited to situations, and ending chases quickly will only happen if the survivor messes up.
---
Pennywise as killer and Bloody Ronald McDonald skin

Okay, I thought on what you said more and while I _get_ what you're saying, it still just seems silly. Yes it wasn't nerfed per say because the "entry point" (how good/bad the perk was going to be to begin with) wasn't set yet. So therefore while it was made worse it wasn't _nerfed_, it was just made worse. Basically it wasnt taken from A tier to B tier. It was just made B tier. Am I close? Do you get what I'm trying to say? I've been thinking about it and that's all I can come up with, otherwise I'm lost and we're just on different pages lol.

Bills been on console a little bit but everyone I’ve met has been absolutely dreadful even in red ranks. No gens get touched, no saves made, but don’t worry cause Bill is there in some fuck off corner of the map crouching because he’s scared for fuck sake Bill help us we’re dying.

Ever since I heard that BHVR made a new monster rig for the Demogorgon, I can’t stop thinking about the possibilities of The Shy Guy coming into the game.
---
Ah, I guess that makes sense.
---
&gt;Bc it's never enough to know the obsession is getting chased. Knowing where they are getting chased, what pallets they're dropping, where they're taking the killer. All of that information packed into an add-on that doesn't consume ur keys charge
---
That's not better than seeing auras of 3 survivors whenever you want. I don't really worry about spending all of my key charge since if I'm bothering with using aura reading on keys at all, I'm using beads and I know how to manage my key uses.
---
&gt;How fucking stupid are you
---
Ad hominems really add a lot to the argument, thank you for including that.
---
I wish more of the community was nice like this 🥺
---
There have been many instances where I'm the last survivor where I can't find the hatch. I may actually use it as a crutch perk since I only ever play solo.
---
People were saying non human killers wouldn't fit into the game and look, we're getting Demogorgon. Even though I love Stranger Things, I never expected we would get Demogorgon in DbD.
---
And yes, I finished book. I know Pennywise is extremely powerful, but I'm pretty sure they'd find some power to make Pennywise fun and playable gameplay wise.
---
He gonna give you his chainsaw  ;)
---
Whats toxic about using a perk the way its supposed to. I'm a killer, im not obligated to give her the escape just cuz she opened the gate. I was testing my new perk build out and I'm happy to say the test was a great success lol
---
give Wraith a mr.Krabs skin 🥺😩😩😩
---
LBP has been my nostalgia trip since August. Reliving those memories help with the moving process.
---
No, no it's not. Stop making excuses of BHVR's part.
---
This occurred because BHVRs backend connection management was poorly designed, not because it "needed dedicated servers".
---
(Galileo) GALILEO, (Galileo) GALILEO, GALILEO FIGARO, MAGNIFICO-O-O-O
---
Honestly I feel like this Left Behind change will make some people do nothing all game because they know they can get hatch
---
I tested it on my Doc and got BBQ AND to Tier 3 within 4 Webs 
---
N U T
---
It's a joke dude nice build tho might steal it
---
I hope the dc penalties coming up actually work as a deterrent
---
Dope texturepack
---
For the performance issues, it’s been 24 hours and honestly you could be going against dudes who have had the game for 3 years due to how the ranking works ( not all vets play so constantly that they are always red rank ) 
---
So my advice is to honestly just have as much fun as possible and let the skill develop over time. 
---
I’d easily reccomend OhTofu’s you tuber starter guides as well as FunGooses more recent YouTube videos on matches, he explains the game at a very high level and is just an absolute unit.
---
But to repeat, have fun and keep at it, you’re sure to become a natural if you put in the effort and time!
---
I mean, I'll go back and try to save or leave as a group. No one left behind
---
Yes of course
---
since you Chili, when you hook someone, you just teleport to the gen with people on it, and smack it down to oblivion.
---
Its the unfortunate reality haha!
---
Someone gets it lmao
---
If you are having fun against a killer then the killer isnt having fun. In case you werent aware, the goal is to kill or survive. Not have a tea party and maybe slap someone.
---
jk, I always put my name, I did it once and got used to it
---
ugh it's hot 💦💦💦
---
Thank you good sir! It is a combination of a few.
---
When they all come to save him and you just want one kill. Yea, been there. and if they rescue him and they all escape it's so frustrating.
---
tHaNks mAn, aPpreCiaTe iT.
---
No one escapes OINK
---
A good chase with back and forth mindgames is fun for both sides. Its a video game. Its meant to be fun to play. As i said i dont care if i die if i know that the killer outplayed me. With spirit its a pure guessing game. When did i say that the goal isn't to kill or survive?
---
Yeah, I have no intention of it being any form of a ranked mode. Just an alternative way to have fun. But I’m afraid this game doesn’t have the user base to support multiple modes.
---
3 TTV'S?
---
Yikes my dude
---
Dedicated servers are nerf for killers.
---
CHANGE MY MIND
---
I wish we could just get free play as survivor or Killer to get used to maps and different perk/addons without needing other people in the match. Ai would be nice but might be too much for the devs. They already have the very basic so in the tutorial but more than that and it could get complicated fast.
---
Yeah I had no intention of it being any form of a ranked competitive mode. Just an alternative way to spice up the game and have fun.
---
What the fuck are you talking about!?
---
Have you seen anyone actually play her?
---
Her "hitboxes" might be fixed for the survivors side but they're now garbage for her as the hits seem to be survivor sided now, which means on her screen many hits will phase through survivors unless she can guess where the survivors are in one second (or more if they are far away). Yea you'll never hear anyone complain about bullshit hits anymore because no one will play her in this broken state where it takes a lot of skill and a fuckton of luck to hit anyone. Go watch Zubatlel's last night stream now and then come tell me if that looks like skillful killer we have at hands
---
Looks amazing, reminds me when I used to play LoL and they had animated splash screens.  
---
How do you make these exactly? Is it easy?
---
Hey one laat question! Do you have any tips on noy to get bullied with him? Theres some games where I do really good and get all 4 stacks of bbq, then there are some games where they completely destroy me on the gens and i cant get all 4 stacks.
---
Then what are you doing here?
---
😜
---
Cool another addition to the add-on/item junk draw.
---
Thanks and yes it is. It's just a little tedious, and time consuming.
---
Idk
---
If she has a good headphone and you don't have iron will, you are still dead.
---
It's a developer. Rank 20 btw. The killer's sounds are awesome though and he has his own chase theme
---
Welcome to the top, it sucks, you gonna love it!
---
I play on console, so I don't know about the experience on the ptb rn. But, I do know that almost every time I try to fucking play killer, I get fuck all frames, and it's almost unplayable. To make it more annoying, when I play survivor, my frames way better
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/czhah5/honestly_the_vanossgaming_dbd_video_is_pure_gold/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Have not played as killer but as survivor the lag seems worse than 200 ping. Getting hit from what, on my screen, is half a weapon length away.
---
What are you, an anime villain?
---
It's literally a joke in this sub. There was a post that made it to hot about a month ago with the angry crowd meme. First tile is a person standing over a crowd that is angered by his words, saying I like dead by daylight. The second tile is "Just a little bit", which is a reference to Monto, a DbD YouTuber.
---
I don’t even know who this guy is.
---
I'm sometimes baffled by these fucking totem spawns
---
I'm suffering severe frame drops and hitching only on the PTB which makes the game unplayable.
---
Dope
---
24 hours ban for 1 DC? That's a little harsh. I say 15 minutes then after that go 1 hour, 3 hours, then a full day for the fourth offense.
---
Thanks man. Means a lot.
---
Yay!
---
Looking forward to seeing your videos where you showcase character models/skins.
---
*every video* made my *MONTO*
---
There are a lot of times where lag makes it so that the killer hits you through that window when you clearly were already the fuck outta dodge, or huntress hatchets, those things are fun to dodge, but any killer with a little lag can really fuck ya good with a hatchet,
---
I mean you're not wrong but am i wrong either? Because usually it is a joke when something goes wrong but eh, whatever
---
ADD IN VOICE PROXIMITY AND I WONT USE DISCORD
---
Reminds me of reins of castomere
---
Just don't look at anything that includes "gone wild" or "gonegay"
---
Breaking at a random time makes it very hard to use, some killers will keep coming back to the hook or camping. I think having the break free option would make it usable.
---
When you got on foot on the second floor
---
Hag 2.0?
---
*T-posing intensifies*
---
they can't just make it immediate 24 hours because people will probably disconnect like they've always been doing with no consequences....while dc'ing is shitty, adding major consequences to something that currently has very light consequences just isn't fair, they need to at least give a warning
---
That's a stalemate situation - I'm not colorblind and it could make it easier for me to see marks if I turned the option on. Would ruin the game for many people. Yet it's already ruined for many people like you. Though it's preferable for it to be added since you have to play too.
---
DAMN IT I FUCKIN CHOKED LMAOOOOOO
---
I don't think it's possible. I could be wrong, but never heard of it before.
---
&gt; What're your experiences like?
---
I've played Pig and Huntress on 80ms server... I won't play Huntress when servers will go live, she's not fun anymore. I guess, Nurse is out of the question for me, too.
---
The Entity hates you
---
TrU3Ta1ent for sure!
---
Yes and no. 
---
I mean, let's agree that 'needed dedicated servers' is a poor excuse.
---
However, I wouldn't put the blame on 'it was designed poorly, either'. DbD was never conceptualized as a party game. You were explicitly meant to be matched with strangers you had no way to communicate with.
---
The entirety of SWF is a tack-on that wasn't part of the intiial concept,
---
thus it's not surprising that the underlying code was never designed for that (and thus was 'poorly designed' towards adding new SWF features).
---
If the specifications change, never blame delay on the programmers, that's one of the frustrating fallacys of day-to-day IT business.
---
Bleen
---
I used Small Game earlier today and just kept dropping every fake pallet I could find. The Freddy did not enjoy it.
---
I think that they also buffed second wind, they also nerfed 2 of the new killer perks as if they where even viable.
---
..............so anyways
---
The fact your a tentacle handed,two headed,ape demon is scarier than a crippled human with a reverse starfish on it
---
FarmerJohn, I love his sense of humour!
---
Can you do it?
---
To add to what /u/jay212127 correctly stated: SJW wasn't meant to ever be in DbD, and they only added it in after an overwhelming amount of community backlash over it. They had the choice of letting their game die whilst maintaining the initial concept, or letting their concept die to maintain the game.
---
They chose the latter (and I won't blame them for that), but most of the balancing issues DbD has are a byproduct of that decision.
---
(And in this instance, some technical debt, too.)
---
I stopped playing for quite a while, and even then I only got up to like rank 15 from rank 1. It may have to do with the changes they did to ranks, but I've kind of forgotten what all has been changed.
---
Yes.
---
Hey man you gotta give the killers a break sometimes
---
Incorrect.
---
What's happening is this:
---
Currently, a hatchet's trajectory and whether it will hit is calculated on the Killer's system, then this information is sent to the Survivor. This is why hatchets seem to have HUGE hitboxes, from a Survivor perspective.
---
On the PTB, this same information is calculated on the server. This is why there's a brief delay on throwing them. Also, likely due to poor server tickrate, a single hatchet is being registered multiple times. So a hatchet can be registered as hitting twice ("headshots") or hitting *and* missing ("piercing").
---
3 hooks per non-obsession and each hook gives 3%
---
That's 9% per survivor. In reality the max you're going to get is 24% when the last non-obsession is on deathhook because the obsession ISN'T affected by Dying Light + gets faster healing.
---
If the obsession dies the entire perk shuts off.
---
It's a nerf. On average you're going to have a slow that's weaker than thanataphobia for most of the game. 
---
The slow comes on gradually over time and not all at once like Dying Light currently does. You have an Obsession who can rush gens at normal speed and heal SUPER FAST, but like the proposed remember me nerf they wanted to do, if you DO decide to kill him everyone works faster since DL deactivates. It's a lose-lose situation. Don't go after the obsession, he rushes gens. He dies, DL no more.
---
If you DO decide to slug the obsession with Knock Out or something and somehow get some value out of the perk, tryhard SWF might have the Obsession disconnect once they realize what's going on, and there's no counterplay for a "tactical disconnect" like that. Likewise being slugged repeatedly sucks for the survivor.  
---
On a side note with Old Dying Light at least once the Obsession was dead, you were discouraged from tunneling then on out because getting hit with DS meant there was a new obsession and DL would deactivate until you killed the next one.
---
With the new DL the killer might be encouraged to tunnel people on deathhook hoping they eat a DS since they can now go after the OG obsession-no-longer for more stacks. 
---
Like I just don't see much value out of the new DL. Old DL was a bit of a "Mori Or Nothin'" perk that was a way to slow the game down. Sure it was "ALL OR NOTHING" if you get the obsession dead 1 minute in or if you're looped for 5 gens, but it did it's job. 
---
New DL seems to require way too much work to get going, and in an "Average" game the effect is too small to be worth running. You also have once again the Obsession running around unaffected.
---
I am a rare Jeff main when I play survivor, so I get a little happy when I see others play him, but earlier I got two other Jeffs in my lobby and we stuck together the first gen, until one got downed and put into basement, so me, the other Jeff, and our Laurie teammate rushed the basement all at once, running straight into the poor Huntress who didn't even have a chance to leave, and started like a minute long cycle of unhooking, going down, rinse and repeat until we all went down.
---
She gave me hatch in the end, and it ended up being probably the funnest game i've had in weeks.
---
And what stops killers from constantly running slugging builds making the game unfun? I hate getting hostage games into basement face camps into beads bullshit, having a DC penalty of 1 day is stupidly harsh, this isn't some competative game, this is a casual game that some people play religiously.
---
Dont call me friend buddy.
---
I'm quite sure it does, your hook health bar changes colour.
---
This subreddit gunna just [whiteface](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/csogcw/im_excited_for_another_indoor_map/) memes
---
It happened the last time they tested dedicated servers a while ago yeah. Definitely seems to be linked to that
---
no they need to add looping into the tutorials it's so basic i still had no clue what to do and had to play tutorials a bunch of times, looping needs to be added to tutorials and other things.
---
Doing something like this so quickly after rolling out dedicated servers is really risky. Not to mention  there are still ulterior means of disconnects beyond someones control that the player should not get punished for. I do fully agree that simply depipping is not nearly enough of a punishment for the act, but an immediate 24 hour ban is a bit much for someone as well to start out with, maybe an hour or two at first.
---
I will fully admit that I intentionally dc as of right now when I am in a game and someone is lagging beyond belief to the point that it is unplayable, and I do not think that I should be punished for a day because of someone elses terrible internet or their choice to be downloading an update/game (I play on ps4) because they do not have the sense to play something else that does not require them to be to be the host.
---
For me it's the ace uwu
---
Dude doesn't even use a Karambit knife right.
---
First time having a heart attack
---
It might've ended up like Freddy's in that case, his is ugly. They shoulda just done his flower head.
---
They don't have looping back when I was playing in February before i offivially started actually playing it, I still had no clue what to do or where to go.
---
Looping needs adding as does duking.

No one ever said first timer perks are more expensive, that's a speculation that this sub told themselves. It's *probably* how much actual time passed since release. Don't believe everything on here.
---
I gotta tell you that Alert is more consistent
---
Beta or no, as someone who has no internet besides data, should be worth a try, I've always wanted to play the game. So far I've only watched gameplay a lot of if, but still only watched.
---
The mega hickey
---
1. Killers may move faster, but Survivors are in 3rd person and cam see more at once. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
2. It does encourage slugging as, with this perk, the Survivor has a far easier time finding the hatch than you do.
---
Warning: “hey you DC one more time it’s a 24 hour ban. Doesn’t feel fair, file a ticket we’ll try to resolve it within 15 min to an hour. If we find out it’s on purpose 3 day ban. If it was an accident 10,000 BP our bad.” Post that everywhere. Make a livestream announcement. Let the heads roll.

Here you go.

Wow and thats one of the devs playing like that
---
you what?
---
Omg Kate's expression is so clueless, it makes the meme much better.
---
&gt;	Fuck that gnome piece of shit
---
FTFY
---
Is it still a frowned upon form of camping when it's endgame? I had somebody on hook once, gates were open, and their friends kept coming to try to save them. I didn't stand near the hook but I pretty much did a circular camp. 
---
At that point, I don't know what else I'm supposed to do except turn around and let them all escape??
---
Weirdly enough it’s glitched so that you do gain a short sprint burst as well as the head on stun when exiting a locker if you have both. So not entirely ridiculous
---
Telepoortation takes a lot of time. So it's gonna be hard to control gates
---
Yeah,  but he's not especially annoying anymore.
---
He's more pitiful than anything else.
---
Yep another selfish perk sadly
---
It’s not toxic if it’s ironic /s
---
Thank you for the info
---
I can already sense the toxicity
---
I got jumpscared by a Survivor.
---
 Neither! Was a Ghostface. Stared at us for a while before disappearing somewhere. I had to watch the David to the right get three crows swarm over his head before dying lol.
---
I love that these bloodweb changes are a massive improvement over how it is currently, yet people are still bitching in this comment chain lol.
---
It's still a meme perk but I like it
---
Me because whenever I face a pig they will tunnel you once you get unhooked which means it is almost impossible to get your trap off. I have never met a pig that keeps the rounds "fair".
---
They ruined their own game
---
You wouldn't be saying that if you saw them in their current state :)
---
DOUBLE KILL
---
TRIPLE KILL
---
MONSTER KILLLLLLLLLL
---
Good news: he looks human. 
---
Bad news: it's Steve Buscemi.
---
It’s probably being released to advertise the game which follows on from that.
---
There’s very little reason to use a skin from that scene if not.
---
I join a lobby as default jeff and the other 3 were 2 default Jeff's and one fancy jeff and we all just fucked around with borrowed time and the killer was playing along because of 4 jesuses
---
Nice! I made beanies as well, i do have some other stuff on my craft IG page, links in my info section.
---
And thanks! I know its not the best but, more  practice ill get it down :)
---
Came for this
---
He’s had some pretty based tweets recently, definitely understand if you dislike him though.  This is good game exposure though!
---
I'm on PS4, but I just got the game a week ago and I find matches in under a minute most of the time.  I did just have a guy disconnect as the final survivor when I dropped him, but that's the only one I've seen so far.
---
I honestly didn't know this game existed, otherwise I would have got it a long time ago.  The stranger things DLC is the only reason I found out about this game.  I am excited to get that, but I'm also excited to try out all the other killers and survivors.  I'm hopeful this game will get and keep a lot of new players.
---
True, but the new Dark Sense might actually be worth it now in noob builds with limited perk options.
---
It's so B I G
---
Koichi?Am I a fucking retard or is that a JoJo reference
---
That’s survivors being stupid. They’ll call it camping, but there’s no reason for you to leave if you see another survivor running around
---
In my opinion, Left Behind is now just a selfish perk that only helps you if you lost. I will not bring that perk in game ever because I want to win and try to help the rest, not just waiting for them to die
---
Then there should be visible cuts and bite marks on their faces, but then again, no other mori animation has anything like wounds, aside for the missing finger from The Clown.
---
When they nerf it before we can even TEST it.  It didn’t even seem that strong to begin with lmao
---
Killer instinct with pink add-ons
---
You probably didn't hear Jane voice lines. 😏

They clearly know how to play their own game lul

I might try it on billy, blocking windows for a chainsaw killer is devastating

🤣🤣 bubba may be a little difficult for me, i was gonna try  billy and nurse first.
---
As much as I love the Aliens franchise, I don't really think you could do a good xenomorph in DBD. It's scary in the series because of its speed, but DBD favors slower, stalker-type killer design.
---
The weird thing is that this spirit had no terror radius at some point. What perks was she using?
---
Are you on pc or console? There are communities on PS4 that have live lobbies 24/7 and each chat party is labeled for the type of players wanted.  Yhe one I’m in has 42K players in it.  You never have to play solo again if you don’t want to.
---
I love how bad vanoss was at this game
---
Legacy btw
---
Except any smart killer will see the generator at 99% and treat it as if its already completed.
---
You could prevent a 3/4gen situation by not getting to that point in the first place.
---
if i’m not mistaken this was in the last PTB with dedicated servers as well, along with the hidden “headshot” one shot with the hatchets
---
I don't mind OoO players as long as they're not in a SWF. Fuck that shit.
---
Hey not a bad idea a betraying survivor but then it should guarantee some bonus: like you will see the aura of the hatch and be able to open it by hands.
---
"They don't forget about old perks" but what about No One Left Behind? It became more irrelevant after the collapse. The minuscule you get is not worth the slot, especially during the collapse.
---
I mean the exit gates were powered. Camping when the exit gates are powered is very smart to secure a kill. But i wouldnt straight up facecamp like the dev here i would proxy and move around more
---
cheers
---
But Lithe, Ds etc help in chases so they indirectly help the rest. I don't like perks that help you if the rest die. I imagine the amount of P3 Claudette's that will crouch until everyone is dead to find the hatch and that will be horrible
---
It mentions it in her lore
---
If it's not there at release i'm sure it'll be added in future.
---
Christ, I cannot wait to play this thing, it's gonna be so much fun
---
You got it!
---
I play on ps4, how do you join these
---
Nope, nothing about being a child, even mentally, she is an adult.

Oh.

Anyone got a mobile version of this ?

Anxiety: There isn't a killer around... But maybe he will be soon... That worries me...
---
Gain a X% speed to healing, repair, vaulting skill when you are within the killers terror radius but lose X% speed when outside the radius.

...or something like that. Idk dude, Im on the toilet. Life is more worrying to me when theres an unknown

Ngl most of the legions games I had tunnel and camp
---
+ He's racist.
---
+ Doxes people he disagrees with.
---
+ sends his followers after them as well.
---
+ Made fun of bashur which almost brought him to suicide, or did as his channel is gone and his second channel has been abandond.
---
He's like Ochido but 10x worse. The Fact BHVR are are indirectly endorsing him shows the wrong message to potential people who would play the game.
---
'Just run Spine Chill and Iron Will'  is not a healthy game balance philosophy. The game shouldn't be unplayable against a specific killer if you aren't running perks that directly counter them. Having a perk available to make playing against one killer slightly more bearable isn't a reasonable form of counterplay. There are only four perk slots and 17 killers, with the addition of the demogorgon.
---
*They're the same picture.*
---
Clown and Trapper are C ??
---
Disappointed ngl
---
Left Behind seems a bit useless to me. If you are the last survivor alive you can already hear the hatch anyway. Not worth the perk slot imo.
---
Nurse is F Tier on PS4.
---
Take all the reasons why people hate Ochido and praised that he was banned, and now amplify it by 10, Now you have Keemstar.
---
you cant hear the hatch from 32 meters tho it is useful anyway
---
&gt;I don't mind ~~OoO~~ players as long as they're not in a SWF. Fuck that shit.
---
ftfy
---
Congratulations!
---
I just *cough* want a *wheeze* simple life!
---
Finally, Myers' adept doesn't consist of conflicting perks.
---
Ruin, tunneling and camping is the experience I get from killers at rank 7 almost every match the paatb2 nights so it doesn’t seem like rank has much to do with it aside from the killers being harder to evade in a chase.  Probably I need to get better as a Survivor.
---
True :D
---
Now we just need the same for detectives hunch!
---
Had only a few games on the PTB last night, but I was purposefully delaying DH until I saw the killer's lunge animation (which should be how the perk is supposed to work), but every time I either went down without DH triggering, or I got the "exhausted whilst bugging out on the floor" glitch and still went down. I was really hoping servers would make DH and pallet drops reactionary since everyone is centralized to a game state, but still no luck.
---
Unless you do the disgusting 3 gen doc strat
---
And I've just spent all my bloodpoints on getting meg to P3 LV50 .....
---
A buff for my cellphone not going off each game cause I got an invite.
---
What movie is this?
---
I just hope we get to see it in post game screen, so killers can see that not all the swf groups are toxic af.
---
Technically all you need to do is play Billy with bbq and you can have 1m bp in a couple play sessions. Imo, Billy is one of those killers where once you get good with him, he's always fun to play, and almost all of your games are going to be quick one way or another.
---
I may have some general tips for bp farming that may help you out.
---
1. Play a killer that has high mobility like Nurse, Billy or Freddy (not Spirit though, she is great in chases but she just doesn't have the same map pressence a killer like Billy would have). You want to either kill everyone relitively quickly (not too quickly though) but all also pressure survivors into doing gens instead of wasting time so you are not spending half the match looking for them.
---
2. Do not run ruin, it sucks when all the survivors get all the gens done and you are not able to stop them, but the more time they look for ruin the longer the game will be and the harder it will be to find people in the early game.
---
3. Ofc run BBQ.
---
4. Don't use all your bloodpoints, if you're about to max out just throw 100-150k bp into something and then play more games.
---
billy was my first and only P3 killer, it’s honestly just so painful to see how fast bloodpoints diminish :/
---
Also for console?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Cuz dedicated servers prob not right?
---
I love how it was terrible before the patch too
---
What about literally half of the perks in the game, which are in no way shape or form worth a perk slot
---
It triggers with Small Game? Really? Huh.  
---
What about when you're not in the Dream World, does it still trigger when there is a Dream Pallet that you can't see?
---
It really doesn’t take long to get to 900k
---
Scalpel, sponge, huge dildo...
---
-Doctor, are you sure...?
---
Give me the huge dildo already, nurse.
---
Also, now all 3 Myers perks are about NOT going killing your obsession and Laurie’s DS makes you an obsession, which helps with Adept and makes sense lorewise
---
The Doctor honestly looks amazing, can’t wait for it. Just an FYI as well for people who don’t know, a data miner said the reason there’s only 5 cosmetics in the files is because the Halloween event will apparently” have earnable cosmetics so these will be released in the weeks up to that point.
---
I didn't see a tearing type motion, just sort of like a dog playing with a toy, waggled it a bit, spat it out, barked at it menacingly
---
BBQ was on the shrine like a couple weeks ago and the dlc is like $5. If you can afford a $20 game then surely somewhere down the line you can find $5.
---
That being said, dbd is basically played the same way over and over again except slightly different each time. You just use bp to get new tools to play with. So if you need BBQ to have fun in dbd, then you're playing for the wrong reason, play to have fun, not to just unlock stuff.
---
oinks from the shadows
---
Amen to that man. Something about hearing that damn flashlight click over and over again really pisses me off. Don't get me wrong, if they blind me while I break a pallet, I don't care. That's a legit strat. It's when they taunt you it just gets the blood boiling.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/czijik/ps4_problems/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The code for SWF is basically patchwork because they developed the game actively not wanting group play time push the horror atmosphere and SWF was just built on top of it.
---
They often said it's not as easy as you claim because the code doesn't allow it. What is more probable? That they are lying because they didn't want to put a low amount of work into an easy fix or are too stupid to do this easy solution or that there were major things stopping them and their claim they'll have to implement a huge change which will coincide with hosting servers is truthful?
---
I think it's ironic how much Myers does not want anything to do with Laurie in dbd according to his perks.
---
#You husband now
---
Why do you?
---
Except he still teabags and makes fun of killers in most of his videos, while not namecalling them directly, thats true.
---
HALLELUJAH
---
SWF was planned. They said so in a youtube QA. They just released KYF before SWF
---
Would you be willing to provide a source on that?
---
It strikes me as baffling that, with matchmaking servers, data management post-game and Steam integration in place, you would need dedicated servers to carry over an assembled party. I'm entirely willing to believe that dedicated servers might be necessary to have a continously maintained lobby with the same people in it, but that's not the same as simply gathering up the (up to) four known players after a match and throwing them back into a SWF lobby, even if it is a technically new one.
---
If that's truly, 1:1, what the devs have said though, I'll remain baffled, but assume there's a really weird technical quirk that would prevent that obvious, if not streamlined, solution. Or it's more of a "Yeah, we COULD do it without Dedicated Servers... but it would be messy and we will rather delay it until we have those, because that will make the feature implementation easier."
---
Actually, the latter strikes me as the more likely reason, and it wouldn't conflict with a dev/PO simplifying it to "We need Dedicated Servers before we can do X".
---
I love tier IV Myers memes
---
Ikr. Ironically the next line was my immediate thought too when I read the original comment.
---
Lmao. Plague's unplayable. Also Huntress's ricochetting hatchets are back. 😂
---
Yeah, I always thought dying light didn’t make sense lore wise because you have play with your food and save the best for last which are both perks based around not doing anything to your obsession until the very end then you got dying light which just says “tunnel your obsession Michael it’s the only thing you can do to not waste a perk slot”  which have you seen Michael hard chase Laurie Strode in a film after Loomis failed his job on numerous occasions.
---
Eh, you're relying to much on the sntihealing aspect. Antiheal builds are pretty unreliable in my experience, and it is becoming easier and easier to get around healing debuffs these days. I think you will be better off running Ruin, Pop, Dying Light and then maybe Sloppy to counter the altruism buff the obsession gets a little bit or use STBFL to take advantage that you don't really want to go after your obsession.
---
Where have I lashed out? I’ve done nothing but shown respect even while you’d call me names or assume I had disorder because I pointed out your contradictions and your incorrect statements.
---
As long as this works both ways and if I teabag you for three or four gens you don’t get salty then we have a deal.
---
YEAHHHHH
---
The Doctor’s wearing hospital slippers! I love it.
---
Yeah it is....;)
---
i don't mind teabags and flashlight spam in game, but the post game chat is so toxic, some people forget that they talk to an actual person with feelings
---
btw i can understand why a killer tunnel a toxic survivor, but sometimes i just get tunneled because I play SWF or because I loop them, it's not fair to tunnel someone that just wants to have fun and all
---
Fantastic Skins, can't wait for Ash, Now if they could just fix his hair
---
New meta:  self care, spine chill, urban evasion, left behind
---
Run DS if being tunneled is an issue. That’s pretty much honestly. Yes, it sucks, but you can’t really change how killers will play.
---
I get sometimes it’s needed if gens are being done too quickly, but some people do without caring and just want to ruin people’s games.
---
I like it actually.
---
P3 head with Scoops Ahoy body baby let’s go
---
i’m not saying that it does. 900k isn’t enough to level up every single survivor and killer. so take that 900k and multiply by however much is required to get every character to level 50 and get all perks on all characters so you can have build diversity and try new things and you’ll see where i’m coming from. and as somebody who doesn’t want to spend however much money buying cosmetics I go for P3 bc free cosmetic/you don’t have to look at the same plain design constantly and it’s kinda cool, hence the “relinquishing your soul to the entity”.
---
I really hope they streamline them and make it so the look like the entities fog rather than just solid black, cause right now they just look, well, bad...
---
If it is not a Dead by Daylight trial, I would say the Pig. She will put me through a trial that I will pass as long as I listen and appreciate the hell out of my life. Hopefully she will be apprentice Amanda and not jaded, vengeful Amanda who tampers with tests to make them impossible to pass. It is a better chance than being killed on the spot.

I’m a survivor and when I see people like that I just feel bad for the killer, they are trying their hardest while they are getting made fun of for it. I don’t bag unless im telling to killer to specific hit me for mettle of man or borrowed for that speed boost. Otherwise I think baggers that are toxic as hell  I think deserve to have a little bit of the “I don’t like you so I’m gonna hook camp and let everyone else go” sorta treatment.
---
It activates only when all gens done. Not so op but slightly need nerf. Like removin bonus speed.
---
I think it's very badly designed. By the time you get its full effect (reaching the same action speed reduction as the old one) all the non-obsession are probably dead and still the obsession is immune to its effects.

I mostly played Freddy to rank 1. Freddy without addons might be worse than hillbilly and Huntress, but its the addons that place him there. Running The yellow and green ropes together, and God forbid you use the paintbrush with swing chains, he deserves a spot in the A tier. He might be the worst of the A tier though. The problem with legion is his fatigur after using his power. Even if he runs across the map, the fatigue give survivors enough time to run to good loops. Also his addons dont do anything which makes power recovery addons the only ones worth using, other than his pallet breaking addon :P
---
Yeah, they are pretty trash the higher rank you are. You can still do well with them obviously, but they just aren't very strong against smart survivors. Clown can be countered by throwing pallets a little early and there is usually enough pallets where all the gens will get down before you run out of pallets. Trapper can either do very well, or the survivors can somehow miss every trap.
---
Enduring hadn't been up for 4 weeks. I was worried something bad had happened to the devs
---
True point, but the issue is, it's a perk that will only work in the specific circumstance of you being near a survivor, near a generator, as it's being completed. 
---
There's a real synergy with Tinkerer there, and it does give you a boost if you arrive in a generator 'just that tiny bit too late'... but I'm not really sold on those niche uses yet.
---
No I died, was playing solo he just wanted a reaction
---
I wouldnt necessarily swap them, the fact that Plagues addons are extremely good is what makes her get a spot in the B tier. And the problem is that Wraith cannot sneak up on survivors because his footsteps are way too loud. But his addons are really good too but no addons remove his footstep sound.
---
Spit my water everything after reading Wrape. Take your upvote.
---
I play so nicely to good survs. Glad to hear your one of them.
---
The downvotes say otherwise lol
---
You can trap Infinites and can stun with the poison. I would say they are a B

oh no

I have. She wasn’t a slut. F u for saying such words to ma crush
---
One time I joined a game where there was 2 other Jeffs beside me. One was a default and one was a prestige 3. We just kept tbagging(each other, not the killer) , looking at the sky and flashlight saving each other. That was a fun game
---
Yeah. My bet is the survivors screams. The demogorgon clamps down on their head and shakes them around a bit before spitting them out dead but still intact.
---
I’m just one of those survivors that respect killers for how they play, that saying if you get a 4K because noed saved your ass I’m gonna be a tad bit salty NOED is a pet peeve of mine.
---
I don't like considering add-ons in ranks, as I can just bring up the add-ons the "stronger" killers have. Billy has Insta-saw, and Huntress has iri heads and infantry belt. Unless the survivors are gods, those add-ons are probably more useful then slowing the game down a bit.
---
You also have to consider that some killers have really busted add-ons as well. Plague has a add-on that lets her see all survivors auras when they vomit which easily bumps her into A-tier, Wraith has that silent bell add-on which puts him into at least B-tier, Clown has Insta down bottles, etc.
---
&gt; Actually, if you have better connection than the killer, it’ll favor your view point over there’s, so if it misses for the better connected player, than it IS a miss.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Unless I’m just plain wrong. I could be.
---
So, in theory you are correct but, funnily enough, I just played a match where I had way better connection than the killer. I asked him how was his ping after the match and he said it was red while mine was 60ms.
---
During the match, I got hit when he swung 2 bodies away from me and also saw the same thing happen to another survivor.
---
Also She might not be in the same power level as billy, but she isnt in the same power level as the B tier killers either. She is kinda the odd one out. Her addons are amazing as well which IMO gives her the A tier. Billy cant be compared to Spirit and Nurse because he gets looped, where the others dont.
---
I agree with you to some extent. I don't tunnel most survs just for looping. I usually start the game rather weary when I notice it's a Sfw group but don't instantly act poorly towards them.
---
Post unfortunately goes against rules now sorry friend
---
really? I'm sorry, I didn't know
---
Maybe I can weigh in.
---
Ashes is wrong, but also right, so you can stop down voting them.
---
There will be a new survivor status effect that will prevent the survivor from hearing the heartbeat when in the killer's terror radius, called Oblivious, iirc.  This will also effect spine chill, premonition, etc.
---
So no, stealth killers won't become "immune" to detection perks.  Only when the oblivious status effect is in play.  Destroying the Demogorgon's fleshy teleporting mound, for example, gives the survivors working on it the Oblivious status effect.
---
If someone knows more, please feel free to add any additional info or correct me if I'm mistaken.  I'm just here to talk about the true true.
---
You have to hook someone after the gates have been opened lmaoo
---
Be more careful looping and be diligent on gens, thing about trapper is that by the time he set up the traps, two gens are already done and he does not have any realistic way to slow the game down and his traps are more or less just hoping the survivor runs the loop you're hoping they'll loop.
---
Frenzy, hit, unfrenzy, hit.
---
I N F I N I T E M E N D but that doesn’t work anymore so your best bet is nurse calling.
---
If you're able to keep me distracted for four gens that's on me man so I definitely wouldn't be salty about it.

I haven't noticed it changed but it might be, survivors tend to not mess around when opening gates so will have to test in KYF.
---
He can be looped, but it can be extremely difficult to loop a good Billy. You can technically loop a Spirit as well, but that is more of a guessing game tbh.
---
Oh, I knew the perk, just not the abbreviation lol
---
oh ok, so this skill just plain sucks then
---
Good Point
---
I’m glad Ash is getting more skins
---
If all the non-obsessions are dead then you clearly did not need it that match.
---
Report back after test. Currently away from my pc
---
People see mori’s as an unbalanced mess from killer and survivor perspectives. Survivors think that it’s unfair because they don’t get play more and killers hate it because you get jack shit for bp and can’t get a merciless if you use it once or twice.
---
Moris are one of the unfortunately many addons/offerings that are really strong and don't have counterplay. Moris, even a green one, make killer SIGNIFICANTLY easier and there's nothing a survivor can do about them. It's a shame too because they are cool, but pretty game breaking.
---
Clowns insta down bottles cant be compared to iri head. He literally has to be up in your face and its very hard to land the bottle on you. Iri head is a very strong addon, but it has to be paired with a belt to be viable. This makes it so rare to play against. The plagues aura reading is good, but doesn’t help her in a chase. I still somewhat agree with you, but i didnt rank killers based on no addons because everyone uses addons. It would be unrealistic to make a tier list based on no addons.
---
I'll probably stick to Alert for showing me where the killer is but this is especially nice for players who only have access to base perks

Yeah. If i made a tier list based on the skill of the pilot, billy and huntress would definitely be S tier. Same for Hag. But i didnt make this list based on skill. Good players dont need a tier list to know which killer is good and who is bad. This is more aimed at the newer players coming for Stranger Things and should give them an idea on which killers to play and learn.
---
It depends in my opinion. 
---
If you use them the moment you get chance and tunnel, then yeah, they're bad. 
---
I use them for the fear and pressure they create as well as using them when someone would be dead on hook anyway. 
---
That way I get my blood points for hooks, and the survivors have a fun (if not nervous) game.
---
Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
---
It's glorious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35rVw1zskA
---
Well not exactly if you abuse the end-game timer I’ve seen killers get a 4K just because of blood warden exsisting in their loadout.
---
Mori spamming literally has zero purpose outside  of being a toxic POS. I'm still amazed they left that shit in the game for this long.
---
Mate, I've seen streamers who main Huntress with over 1k iri heads. It's not hard to get iri add-ons if you dump all your bp into one killer. Lol
---
Also, Paintbrush is also and iri add-on.
---
Also I wasn't comparing clown to Huntress in any way, I was just making a point that add-ons bump a killers power level.
---
you should check r/dbdgonegay
---
It is a great perk to catch yourself some cocky survivors in the end game
---
Especially if you are able to down them in one hit, with the "no one escapes death" perk for example.
---
But it is not meta.
---
&gt;Since you run DS every match, don't you think it's not a good idea to use that add on with it? If you stab the killer, your 7k points add on becomes useless.
---
You rarely ever get to use Decisive unless you force it where I'm at since most killers actually respect it or know how the deal with it.
---
If you have and criticisms, let me know!
---
Fair enough I suppose.
---
If you use them against a team of vanilla survivors then yeah it’s in bad taste.
---
If you get a genrush swf with multiple toolboxes or instaheals then no, they know what to expect.
---
She get her power if you cleanse and then she is huntress 2.0
---
So pretty much you the survivor give her the power
---
This is definitely one of the better animated Mori's in the game. A bit sad they're not removing the head afterwards though
---
I can see why they'd certainly pile up at max levels, but as a new player I've only picked up 7 across the killers I'm playing (Trapper 50, Huntress 47, Cannibal 42, Shape 17). Focused more on perks and extra BP offerings than Mori's.
---
Having no counterplay is a big flaw in it, I tried saving a friend by attempting to flash the killer in the animation. I promptly turned tail and got hunted though. Good learning experience.
---
Would they be considered a crutch for certain players trying to reach higher ranks easier? From what I have gathered, the longer the game goes on for the better it is for your rank.
---
I agree that now is the time to do it. They are reworking the netcode for the dedicated servers, so might as well redo lobbies while they're at it.
---
But. If they really wanted to do it before, they could have. Claiming that the code is bad isn't an excuse. I wonder how bad it really is seeing how scared they are to even consider new features.
---
I don't see how the current way of making things is "patchwork" though, unless they implemented it like monkeys. SWF lobbies are just pre-lobbies before the killer lobby. They were built on top of the current game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing considering the current P2P architecture. Adding a "save and backup" feature to have that lobby survive the actual game isn't that dirty or complicated IMO
---
This is scary accurate at purple ranks.
---
Nope, this is actually one of the worst things you can do as Killer in 90% of the situations that come up.
---
If you have one person on hook, he's not doing anything so you can leave him and another Survivor has to waste time to pull him off the hook + Heal him, tying up two Survivors for a time. If you hook a Survivor and stay in the area, then you have one Survivor on the hook not doing anything, and three Survivors who are out and about doing Generators without anything stopping them.
---
The only two times you want to stay next to the hook is if you *know* someone is nearby (Scratchmarks, you actually saw them, no one popped up with BBQ and Chili) or if the Exit Doors are already powered. Otherwise, you're wasting time just by standing next to the hook.
---
Streamers have over 1k iri heads because they dont use them while also having dead by daylight as a job. Iri head alone is not good because you can only carry one hatchet at a time. Its the fact that if you have to pair it with infantry belt to make it amazing. Also a bad Huntress with iri head and belt can still do bad. Also Freddy can use the green and yellow rope addons and that is enough for him to be A tier.
---
Fucking exactly! Lol
---
Now I would not compare these two games at all not only is there many more ways to escape Jason there are ways to just beat him up and shoot him the whole feel of the game is different the map is bigger Jason has different abilities and he does not need to hook you or anything like that to kill you the only problem I have with swf is that it is biased to playing with friends for solo survivors and it is unfair to the killer in some ways I say they need to change something to motivate killers to play with them cause a lot of killers will doge what they think are swf or the swf are more planes before the game even started with him and it can be over in 2 minutes
---
Wow.. another Dwight cosmetic. How great. We totally needed that. Hooray. You know... For a struggling student and total loser(i can relate)... He certainly seemed to have one hell of a social life and a bunch of careers. Always out of the house doing something. At least it's not as terrible as the parachute outfit.
---
As a Feng main, I'm glad she's getting another cosmetic. I'm disappointed that it's terrible. I don't think I'll see anyone using this. Myself included.
---
Ash, Wraith and Doc look good though. Welcome additions for sure
---
I honestly became a killer main just because I dont have any friends but the time i spent waiting for a killer lobby is unbelievably longer than the solo survivor ones
---
Because killers learn early on that it’s efficient to take out one survivor as fast as possible in order to win the game.  So they do that, over and over and over again, and the other survivors let it happen by either unhooking irresponsibly or by being too slow on the gens.
---
Its only when they move up the ranks they learn that it wont work against good survivors, then they begin to learn about applying pressure. Until then though.....
---
It would be cool if it came out on september 11th but probably not
---
I'm interested In their mori lmao.
---
I'll send this to my girlfriend the next time I want nudes
---
LOL yes you were SO respectful
---
Head On, apply directly to the forehead

Dude I play both but if survivor gave you as much bloodpoints as killer, and I was somehow guaranteed to always have good teammates I would probably become a survivor main and rarely play killer
---
Next on BHVRs to Do List:
---
Nerf the pig...again.
---
I'm pretty sure I can't do anything about some other survivor pissing off a killer which makes him go into another game and face camp me for no reason. You're kinda just giving yourself a reason to be a dick and not listening to your own assess your playstyle, and treat others like you want to be treated ideas.

Yea they do punish you rank-up worse, but it's still no fun to go against them. The people that use them dont care about the ranking anyway, they just want to bm.

I'll tell him eventually, I already told him and showed him how to use perks, but let's just say his perk choices are... Interesting. I don't feel like explaining every single perk to him but at the same time kinda want a challenge. Do I tell him?

I was playing solo on PC because everyone I'd try to SWF with would end up to be a constantly screeching kids.

Yes but this image in this post Is the same on leaksbydaylight, he is Simply Stolen lol
---
When on ps4 ? *sad emoji*
---
Been dodging lobbies for about 30 minutes now, over 10 attempts and  no good ping. 
---
You click "search for lobby" and wait a few minutes until it finally puts you in a lobby aaaaaaaand red ping.
---
Why she look like quentin ?
---
Birthday cake!
---
Have they said anything on what time the Stranger Things stuff hits the PTB?
---
He posted this first the idiots on your subreddit take from here almost no one on your subreddit does any of the leaking it's just stuff they took from other people and they slap a stupid watermark on it
---
Except for you to get the 9 stacks of Dying Light only the obsession will be left and Dying Light doesn't do anything to them.
---
Damn it’s fuckin sick!

Fuck the entity. We need a revolution.

Did you see my comment below?

everyone here is talking about Head On and i'm sitting here, looking at Enduring and thinking "I'M STILL IN A DREAM, PALLET EATER"
---
Rethinking all of his choices in the end

they removed SWF and replaced it with GHOSTS

Yes it is very low risk for very high reward. Yes she has no real counterplay to looping but doesnt stop you from being a one hit that can just infect everyone on your team easily and being punished hard id you even try to heal. What I dont get is why it has the reach it has. High walls on lets day mother dwelling can just be sprayed over for an ez hit and that is downright stupid.
---
I just wasted 9000 shards on Jane because I thought it would take forever for Head On to be on the shrine.
---
I love the part where they said to not excessively use pallets and flashlights lmao. Sounds like you would get on their nerve no matter what you do.
---
Yes but if survivors don't cleanse Plague can down survivors in one hit at all times. Plague is in no way worse than Wraith.
---
\- Protector: Someone saves you, now is your turn. When someone unhooked or heal you, you can see that survivor's aura always and with no range limit. When that survivor receives a hit and you are 2/4/6m from him, you will receive the hit instead.
---
Except for the fact that if you are the only surv showing good behavior throughout the game there's a 100% chance I'll let you go after recking you teammates. I only play bad against bad players, that's the whole point of my posts. If you aren't a bad player you have no worries about encountering me. Even if I recognize you many matches later, if you play with manners you safe. I can't speak for other Killers tho, only myself.

I can’t wait for the shadow people on PS4!
---
I like it, makes the menu look neater.
---
SWF will never be removed. It'd just be the dumbest change ever.
---
You can tell him to click on rightmost box.
---
Also, my problem is not with what you tell him to run. It's with your build when you're killer and he's survivor
---
Make healing unbearable, use perks that slow healing down so much to the point where they just don't bother anymore.
---
Most survivors can run the killer around for a long time (If they don’t have PWYF of course) anyway, just go to the other end of the map to cleanse and the killer will have to give up pressure and waste time.
---
Just git gud gamer 😎😎😎😎😎

Were you able to test Huntress? I've seen a few people saying dedicated servers broke her.

gta character editor is really really bad

Hell yea
---
Use STBFL and frenzy the non survivors to quickly build up stacks. If you hit a survivor and there's no one around, you might as well hit them again with frenzy to gain an extra stack then go and down them. Once you have a lot of stacks, survivors will have a really hard time trying to get away from you especially when they're all close together.
---
&gt;Were you able to test Huntress? I've seen a few people saying dedicated servers broke her.
---
I've been testing her since yesterday. Played about 20 matches so far. Its not good.
---
She is still playable but not very enjoyable and I am struggle to land flicks. Plus she is current bugged AF now and your hatchets some times 1-shot survivors or go through them and hit multiple survivors if they are lined up.
---
I know, meg was the only character i could make look somewhat decent
---
Bullying your friend because he doesn't understand the game instead of explaining the mechanics makes you the worst friend someone could ask for.
---
Lol huntress is a one hit headshot, it’s insane.
---
They’re spooky I haven’t seen any builds like that surprisingly maybe just spirit and paint brush and swing chain Freddy
---
It scares me how the survivours look exactly as the people in the show. More scary than the game itself

That big brain moment when they trigger a trap at a loop and they come running to you cause they think you're gonna teleport.

O-O

Dang, I was hoping that was an intentional thing. Even if it was just some lore that would be pretty neat.
---
funny thing is they did remove the spam at one point but brought it back prob was a glitch they have not bothered to fix yet

Hope you enjoy the game! ; ^)

you have no idea how to use the perk

&gt; Plus she is current bugged AF now and your hatchets some times 1-shot survivors or go through them and hit multiple survivors if they are lined up.
---
This will be fixed, hopefully. But they can't make her enjoyable again, I'm afraid.
---
Yeah I've been playing for a long time. You're mad you don't get bullshit hits anymore?
---
Because DLC content is not available yet
---
thanks mate
---
Weren't these bugs already there the first time they released the servers in the PTB, months ago? 
---
I'm not confident at all if they're still planning on releasing them in a few weeks.
---
I’m both cases they were in what I think would be called A pose. I don’t think the disappearing when I looked away was a coincidence either. If it is just glitching silhouettes I’d assume there’s a redraw when I look away and back and that just fixed the glitch.
---
Lol
---
Fun fact: the person running this has started as Obsession every time I've seen it in the ptb.
---
Tbag a rank 20 nurse 3 inches away while her blink if fully charged

if it is true it is prob a glitch. although I find it sorta funny cause I remember some ppl who say if you just leave noed will not knock you down I guess with this system they are right lol. but ya prob a glitch and will be fixed im guessing

K, ima tell him about perks when he gets online lol.
---
Dude looks like a half life 1 npc
---
Is true... Specially when you have two very special add ons....
---
if its in the game and working as intended then its for you to use at your own discretion regardless of what the other side has to say about it. the only thing i can say that would be toxic about it is mori rushing. id atleast save it until mid/late game that way both sides can earn a pretty good amount of points before getting the shaft. honestly i usually forget a have a mori and it goes wasted any way so i dont use em lol
---
In about 5 hours, I'd say
---
To be honest. If that meant no hittable vomit I would take it but I could understand why not. (Another note: I have no idea why they turned legion into old freddy status but who knows. I mained legion when they first came out and it felt fun using feral frenzy. Now It feels way to damn slow and feels like im fatter than the clown running. One issue I had with the nerf was vault speed which made no sense when they had nerfed everything else about feral frenzy and decided to nerf something that made legion who legion was as a killer. Its like removing Tier 3 from myers so people would stop complaining about insta downs or removing the ability to teleport to your traps as hag and only seeing the visible aura.)
---
&gt; Lol, mark my words dedicated servers won't fix issues since the codes are executed client side. Will make it worse. And seems they got potato servers too.
---
In theory it should get rid of unfair hits but not long ago, playing survivor, I got hit by the killer while he was 2 bodies away from me (running in a straight line). 
---
In post game chat I asked him what ping he had and he said it was red while mine was green. In theory this would be possible if the pings were the other way around (mine red and his green). 
---
So servers didn't even fix this, at least this first phase.
---
Thank you 😊 
---
Unfortunately no one knows, that's purely my interpretation of how he might look considering the picture on the driver's license is so poorly detailed.
---
Umm ex-fucking-scuse me? Where's Spine chill? That's like the most important perk on avoiding the killer.
---
Haha true. I just don't play killer anymore.
---
I don’t think they will use dark sense, as well as Last Man Standing, the meta perks will continue to be meta perks and I dont think we will have a new one for survivors that can replace decisive, borrowed time, dead hard, balanced and adrenaline, the last “good” perk we had was mettle of man and it was op, now it’s trash, my advise is for people to stop playing by the meta and start using some fun/interesting builds, DBD Isn’t a competitive game, is just a casual one
---
Oblivious hides the killer terror radius and red stain. Basically making them a night shroud ghostafce. So I’d say it’s pretty balanced
---
Depends if it’s used for a daily or not.
---
Even then as long as it’s not during a blood hunt or an ebony every game then it’s okay I guess.
---
Because when you think about it they are just the killer version of keys. Both things that let you skip stages of the game for an early win
---
How did they change the left behind achievement

Zero fucks to give. 
---
You give zero fucks, about almost everything, any perk or power that would give a killer or another player a token, instead gives them nothing at your expense.
---
"You have to care sometimes, right?" 
---
"Nope."
---
Do bones
---
Okay but OP doesn’t know much about the game. They literally said they’re a new player. Such a jump between “you’re new and don’t know much” and “you’re bad,” which I never said either of those things. You can interpret it however you want, I really don’t care but there’s a big jump in what I actually said and you assuming I meant to insult OP. Doesn’t matter though cos reddit users will downvote literally anything, no room for rational discussion whatsoever. Will downvote myself to get it started
---
You will always connect to the closest server they said. Apparently the only server is in fucking Antarctic!
---
Ok this pleases me as an ash main now moar
---
 Wait wait is this an issue with huntress now, or will it always be a issue no matter what
---
I'd recommend fungoose, Int3r4ct and otzdarva on YouTube or watching them stream, they're very informative and educational. Fungoose just made a video explaining things for beginners and he's in the middle of making another.

Uuuhhhh OwO

I love the new badham preschool frontend menu, ngl

Press choose character, choose other killer, enjoy

I dunno Megs perks are pretty good too
---
Well ain’t you slick....although that would be kind of hilarious to run at least for the first few weeks. Sit there and watch them get confused and rage when they can’t get the beam right. 
---
Ok that’s it now I wanna do it too.

This is as unfair as insta heals, IMO...

Are you kidding? Most games it's usually three Rank 1 survivors with their "rank 20" SWF so they can bully grey/yellow rank killers.
---
This guys look so shit
---
Ugh, she looks so beautiful!
---
Yes and no. It doesn’t actually tell you about the perks the Killer is using but you see your scratchmarks EXACTLY as the Killer sees them, so if they are using Predator you would see the effects on your scratches. 
---
For example as well, if it’s a Legion who goes into FF then you won’t see your scratchmarks for the duration until they come out of it. Same thing if you use Dance With Me, Poised, Distortion and anything else, you won’t see them until the effect wears off.
---
Oh... I just got spoiiled. Guess I had to be more careful
---
„It‘s not a kill when i dc before the killer hooks me the third time“
---
Tag it as a spoiler. Fool.... though dbd has never removed limbs off survivors.

well, can't help you with that then

all I can give you is my F

# F
---
He looks like the evil future Ceo spider-man
---
Thank you lol I'll take it XD
---
But he’s legacy 3 hillbilly, that would take forever to get back in the day of the slow and super grind fest bloodwebs. Even then, he should be at least a little bit competent if it his first time in a while
---
You should see Red Dead Online's
---
I'm convinced Rockstar just thinks it's hilarious for every player to look like a hillbilly
---
That’s the meta talking. The other perks are actually fine.
---
That’d be one hell of a buff, I’d never take it off.
---
Closest server **available**.
---
I’m confused can you actually?
---
Either Lagswitch, normal lag on either side or a desync bug
---
Does anybody have a video or gif from the new hatch animation?
---
Not a fan of the hair, gonna be honest. Too frizzy. Looks messy.
---
Nope unfortunately it wouldn’t actually let me change the med-kit or the add-ons. When I clicked on them it would just do nothing.
---
Shame
---
It can't be because his dead hard would purple in kyf and it's green
---
Nope it’s just a bug I found, had to disconnect from that match as I couldn’t get off the menus.
---
why does it look like some type of insects
---
UWU demogorgon-sama
---
Evil Within 4 looks great
---
he's other beard cosemtics are affected as well. it only looks a little better in ultra
---
Dark Sense is gonna go in my Stealth Jockey Build. Dark Sense, Poised, Sprint Burst, Technician. Find a gen to quietly do, find the killer, get 10 seconds of no scratches, Sprint Burst to the next one.
---
What about hag
---
Aw sorry forgot to tag as spoiler
---
🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
And the Trapper’s Honing Stone Icon there too.
---
I wouldn’t bring self care, I used to always run it but then you realise that since the nerf to self care the time it takes to full heal yourself is time you could have saved via teammate heal, or bringing a med kit. It also sets up bad habits like self caring in a corner for 30 seconds when there’s 1 gen left. I made all these mistakes when I started but honestly dropping self care and picking up another perk with utility is great, especially since ruin has been in the shrine this week maybe run Small Game?  Familiarise yourself with totem spawns etc
---
Also console or PC?
---
well, that billy asking you to do the gen anyway so I think he is memeing ...
---
Saving the steam ID of your previous lobby?  
---
Oh no dont know of any programming language that would allow you to save a long string of characters... 
---

Maybe we should just make a new data type for saving these weird squiggly lines...
---
and a group of these we will call "string"  
---
bro this isnt 1970

Ez points, tbh.
---
Using the dream snares and fake pallets I think
---
Seems like the help team may not know and they’re pushing it further. Perhaps it’s an odd case that needs a bit more elbow grease.
---
Don't put the support team on blast like this, it's not fair; they are trying their best and this does not help.
---
With anything like a bug causing you to crash it would be best to post a bug report with evidence of how it happened, your PC specs, what killer/survivor you were playing as etc.
---
It will get you far better results than putting the support team on blast.
---
In movies freddy couldnt hurt anyone unless in dreamworld but i guess it makes sense

Killer hit the generator and left. He also left the slug on the ground. They are all on comms with Discord. Seems like the killer was letting them Farm.
---
Ironworks of infinites. FeelsBadMan
---
O i n k
---
Yeah starting at level 40
---
Jesus fuck, read what I write. I want there to be *some reason* to care about the obsession other than perk effects I might not even have. Yknow, so their mark as OBSESSION makes sense.
---
I mean... The killer hit the generator and left. Wearing Legacy. Left the Jake slug on the ground and didn't appear to be going anywhere in a hurry. He also did not attempt to M1 you and the whole swf on comms thing is also pretty lame. Something tells me the killer gave up or you were farming.
---
I tried making Kate but some how they don’t have her basic ass hair style
---
It doesn’t help your customers to have a bit response then keep them in the dark for nearly two months. After a few weeks of hearing nothin I went back and simply asked if there was an update and provided more information. Nothing. Again a couple weeks after that. Nothing. I don’t like blasting people when they are trying to help, but at this point it doesn’t seem like they are bothering, and considering I’ve dropped a load of money on this game, it’s utterly ridiculous.
---
Or just widened, to balance it out
---
When the killer is boutta check your locker
---
That Homer is scarier than the actual Michael myers

---
*any ranks
---

Gimme da T I T Y
---
I’m not sure how to take that. Hah.
---
.... fair point.
---
I get it but they have a stream to run and to give people what they came for, so to speak. If you go into a carnival for free and all the rides and games were shut down, you aren’t going to pay to use them or stay. They all have a business to maintain and run effectively and they can’t if they get slugged or whatever the case may be.

&gt; A few weeks ago, we stated that we were looking into the Player Pips and Rank Update errors (see here for more details). We believe we have found the cause for these issues and are currently testing a fix internally. If all goes well, this fix will be included in the next update.
---
I know thats why I only did meg, its pretty much impossible to do someone else
---
Because headphones are anything and it's a waste of a perks lot. You can hear the hatch from a greater distance than most generators.
---
Then again whenever I die I have to spectate dumb teammates who will walk right past the hatch because they're too busy eating or listening to music while playing and have practically no sound.
---
I like this it is very good
---
It’s in the game so yeah. The survivors can suck it up if they’re that mad about it imho I mean it’s one game.
---
They're still in an influential position and a role model of sorts and shouldn't be DCing unless they're actually being held hostage or facing some other rule breaking like cheating etc.
---
True I am a killer main but usually play swf a lot with a buddy of mine, again always do bones
---
Well pug is a acquired taste, for sure. Especially when he goes off on one of his rants but I’d be hostile too if I played the same thing for 70+ hours a week, all week, every week. Even more so having it as dbd. Hah. He’s a good dude though.
---
KNOWN ISSUES
---
* The Hillbilly's chainsaw spring movement speed is randomly reduced to walking speed.  
---
We really need something like this at the live servers.
---
A crippled amorphus retard cant walk at regular speed and get that rushing gotta go fast one hit, change my mind.
---
\#BalanceBilly #ForFuckShake #WhyTheFuckHeHasALL
---
Dying light got feral frenzied
---
Most likely.
---
The event hasn't been confirmed
---
WHAT DOES IT STACK WITH
---
We did it boys. Swf is no more.
---
Well Incase it is can you help me out?
---
I agree with you, to a point. For sure.
---
Adam does know he needs a Safe Unhook score in order to get Deliverance, right??
---
Cause 5 minutes of being slugged is enjoyable. I'm not gonna waste my time
---
Wtf is that?
---
You did see the "Shitpost" tag, right?
---
I believe it's because they have a shit tick rate/refresh to the server and yourself computer. (Basically what detects your location locally and on the server.) A quick connection reduces this but if they have a high refresh rate on the servers then it doesnt even matter.
---
I think this might be the reason.
---
I think everyone was waiting for this update...
---
There goes her athletic part
---
PC but probs same thing on console lol
---
I wouldn’t say her hairs basic, it’s not a common style.
---
it's still been three years, if you dont play killer for a while you *will* feel rusty, expecially with powers like chainsaw or hatchet. There's plenty of reason for them to be so bad, maybe he's letting a friend try the game? I wouldnt say that the legacy is 100% hacked so easly
---
Damn.
---
Its a joke
---
ANSWER US GODDAMNIT

&gt;I knew people would be horny and kinky and shit but like what the fuckkk

Well i wanna brutally murder both, so... good job

I would say being unable to play the game is indeed a ‘critical issue’, if you don’t think so that’s your opinion, but I don’t see how it isn’t one. I’ve worked as a QA with a ticketing system before that received a VAST amount of tickets per day, and I can tell you for a fact that replying to the vast majority of them, even if it is just a small update, is NOT that difficult. If I wasn’t able to get back to every single one in a day or two, I’d have been let go. And I had no issue with it because it wasn’t hard. Nearly two months waiting for a simple reply even along the lines of “We are still looking into this” is mind boggling. I’m not trying to be a jerk, I truly appreciate how hard it can be to work as support for a video game, but I don’t understand how I haven’t heard ANYTHING in nearly two months.
---
what is swf I’m new to the game
---
All good man, but might I ask what exactly do you have to do to play w/friends?
---
The guy with 0 character and next to no backstory but seems to be popular somehow.
---
Thank you. I’ve clearly been an idiot and missed this update. Much appreciated.
---
The thing about BP is: you can only get 8000 per category. Those can be doubled by BBQ and further raised by BP offerings (but no other perks).
---
Doctor is one of the easier killers because the hardest category to max to 8k is deviousness, which is basically "use your killers power a lot.
---
So to answer your question about what to do in game: shock people a lot with your power, and try to hook everyone as often as possible to get the sacrifice category maxed.
---
Don't fall for the trap perks like distressing, thrill of the hunt and such.
---
They say they increase BP of a category, but you cannot overcome the cap of 8k BP, so if you can reach that cap naturally (which you can) those perks are a waste.
---
(Distressing is still cool on doctor because he profits from a bigger terror radius).
---
A bit of non asked advice: i use the plague to farm BP, i get about 50k BP per match without addons and offerings with BBQ rank2.
---
I find her to be super easy to do well and rack up BP
---
&gt; As far as I understand it they basically built a lobby that then throws the people on the server of the game
---
I still don't see how this is an issue, regardless of the code quality.
---
&gt; the lobby is not really able to communicate data
---
Why wouldn't it be? And anyway why would it need to? All you need is the steam id of the SWF host, which you already have.
---
&gt; The clients sending updates about leaving a server and the regrouping just isn't in the code and since it's P2P there would have to be a system in place checking who of the group leaves first in order to make him the groupleader since otherwise there's no group people could join into as long as the old leader is still on the killers server.
---
Have the same host, have the other survivors silently (with a spinner or whatever) retry until connection succeeds or until they start another lobby / quits the game. There are ways to make it work.
---
&gt; Sure they could have implemented it earlier if they wanted.
---
I don't say they should have. But people need to stop saying that the game and its current P2P architecture aren't meant for that.
---
dbd on mobile
---
Except they also get bloodpoints for dying as the obsession. You're really thirsty for bloodpoints, huh? Idiot.
---
r/wooosh
---
Careful now, this is for the dedicated servers test. No sign yet that this will come in the chapter patch. (as Ded servers still seem a bit off being ready imo.)
---
Imagine being so bad that you blame your failure on the group of friends your playing against communicating with each other
---
Personally i don’t feel pharmacy or self care is as necessary as something like Decisive or another strong perk like that(OoO being another good one but not as good imo).
---
I accidentally left a tuft of hair and tombstone on Myers when I played last and ended up only getting two moris in. I felt so defeated but got a mori in front of the exit, so that felt good at least.
---
Personally I think each totem should have its own Aura Color. For example ruin is purple or lullaby is red.
---
That way you know which ones to focus on or protect and I also think totems should be smaller and harder to find with better spawn locations. Perhaps the killer gets notified when you're working on the hex or hex totems take longer than dull totems with the possibility of an overcharge skill check that alerts the Killer and resets progress if you miss it.
---
Tired of having totems out in the middle of a field or next to a generator constantly. Each hill is pretty much guaranteed to have one as well.
---
&gt;I could not disagree more with this statement.  Obviously this is a difference of opinion here, I'm not trying to pass this off as objectively true, because this starts to get into the question of why you play Dead by Daylight.  But I see this as a survival/horror game.  And it's legitimately sad to me that in a survival/horror game where the roster of killers includes serial killers, supernatural humanoid monsters, and a literal dream demon, there are only 2 killers that actually frighten survivors.  I think the Nurse's power level should be the base power level for all killers, that way the game would actually feel scary instead of feeling like Loop and Pallet-Kicking Simulator.  But, of course, some people just loving looping.  I don't know why, I can't imagine what's fun about that, but it's what some people want out of the game.  For me, I would vastly prefer if all the killers were actually scary and posed a threat to even the best survivors.
---
You make it sound like Dbd is some kind of Role Playing game, you are facing people here, not NPC's, if you are on top skill ranks, against top skilled players in what universe is it supposed to exist any sort of domination? make survivors scared? wth, this is a performance based multiplayer game, ofc it has a horror theme, but in no way shape or form is this a role playing 'im the killer so i  should be able to kill everyone easily' type of game. just like every other ranked game, when you reach the very best levels, EVERY GAME is hard, takes a toll mentally, its challanging, makes you tired, and you often don't succeed. that's how EVERY ranked game work. how do you think Global Elite on csgo is, Diamond on Siege or LoL, there are hardly any complete domination games. you are going against the very best it's supposed to be a pain in the ass. if you dont like dealing with looping and pallets and you like how nurse and spirit work because they are the only ones that "actually frighten survivors", you are in the wrong game imo. Pallets and looping are the chasing FUNDAMENTALS in this game, the best skilled killers out there are the ones who can deal with it. not by using killers that ignore them, but actually outplaying survivors within the  fundamentals. makes me wonder what sort of experience you have on survivor role, did you ever faced a 5k + h nurse? legacy 3 nurse? do you have any experience what so ever to back up what you say regarding her having counters? or on what mind games you can do to her? go watch GammaLunatik's VODs and tell me what do you see there, is that fair to the game? call me old fashioned by i think both nurse and spirit are shortcuts to victory that shouldnt be able to exist, they make the skill ceiling go down tremendously because people will go for those rather than learning how to play around tiles, why go thru something thats hard and painfull and you can take the easy way out. there are killers out  there doing super well with Hillbilly, Huntress... even Pig. Don't tell me that's not levels ahead of a Nurse/Spirit shortcutting his way by not getting punished for mistakes.
---
No doubt if you're having the issue on PC then consoles will be in trouble. 
---
Can't say I've ever had a problem, I'm running a 1060 and a i7-9700k.
---
damn,thats a good point
---
“STAY SAFE OUT THERE” what is this he Purge? Lol
---
Now to do literally everyone else!
---
It’s one of the best feelings as a survivor, too bad it’s nearly impossible to pull off unless the killer is boosted
---
Imagine winning as a low tier killer against a coordinated group of survivors with meta perks, a key, toolboxes and insta heals.
---
no....no way
---
I hope that this is not max charge range.
---
I honestly stopped caring who I face a while ago, but I do find it rather disappointing that some folks camp or Dodge still.
---
That should be the KYF name. Now that SWF is gone at least and you just play as survivor.
---
pretty weak
---
I think they're doing a pretty good job...
---
I always seem to find toxic pigs, no idea why. Her traps discourage tunneling and yet I can't remember the last time I played against a pig that didn't tunnel guys with traps. Shame because she's fun to go against if not played like a dick. I also hate NOED, mostly because you only know if they have it when someone gets hit...
---
Yeah, swf only makes a difference if you’re playing with people who are actually good, lol. I play swf pretty often with some irl friends who are casual players. Honestly my games probably go better in terms of survival rate when I’m solo, but I have a lot of fun playing with them so that doesn’t bother me.
---
Played with a Dwight yesterday who hid in the locker and let me die on hook. I mean he died too of course shortly after but it's amazing how true the meme is.
---
Dark Sense: Now works like how you thought it worked before.
---
The difference is that no one is forcing him to play DBD, but that's where his audience is for him to make money. If anyone else was as hostile about their day job as he can get about DBD, you'd flat-out tell them to find another job, not make excuses for why they're hostile.
---
But I haven't watched Pug so idk how hostile he gets or how often it happens.
---
Nea is very crow friendly ..
---
Using mori's, a very intentionally added mechanic for the killer that is a more powerful option that hooking, **cannot** be BM, because the term 'BM', to my knowledge, means intentionally engaging in behavior that has no positive effect on your gameplay (often the opposite, see teabagging behind a pallet instead of running off), with the sole purpose of annoying other survivors.
---
So, no, no BM.
---
However, the point can be made that using Mori's is not exactly a lot of fun in some situations. It's a part of DbDs design philosophy that the playing field is not even. If the killers brings an Ebony Mori, RIP survivors. If the Survivors brought all BNPs, Displeased Entity (this was far worse before Mementos and BNP were nerfed, mind you). So, running into those 'extra powerful' offerings/items too often will definitely be annoying because you know you will be bound to underperform.
---
I think the big discrepancy here is that a killer mori is more impactful than a single BNP, and it potentially diminishes the fun of four players, vs a full set of BNPs being required to diminish the fun of a single player.
---
So, whilst not BM per se, mori's are a bit of a tricky topic.
---
I personally do not use them often outside of either clearing out a killer (aka, using up all items before presitiging), for a daily quest, or because I got matched with a 4man SWF in perfect username and outfit coordination (because those tend to be bonetough matches you might want to bring extra firepower for). And even if I do bring a Mori, I won't necessarily use it (in the most optimal fashion), if I think it will be more fun for everyone to deploy it later.
---
But that's personal preference.
---
Oh, and then there's Devour Hope, I will gladly give full Mori rights to any killer going through the pain of gambling on that Hex :D
---
Why are you booing him, he’s right!
---
You should propably wait unti the new chapter gets released, the patch will include a change to the bloodwebs which makes it far easier/faster to get all perks at level 50
---
Crows make you bleed out faster. EZ
---
wth did i just read? ok this explains a lot, i will argue no further
---
Dude you are a terrible friend and human waste. Hope he founds out and dodges you, as it seems like you have no other friends. Hope I see you ingame so I can mori and facecamp you. Garbage.
---
You see. The obvious solution to this is to run no mither. Honestly I don’t know why you don’t have it equipped. Especially along with self care. The god tier combo that it is.
---
Hag that set bear traps :))
---
Ok
---
People usually are: shirtless = tunell to death and be as toxic as possible, even tho the david is playing fair. That's why people don't use it.
---
In the end screen the killer had an iridescent add on so maybe it had a trade off for less range on it. There's probably add ons for range or charge time also, I don't know though
---
The demogorgon is physically hurt by light, so that's why the flashlights will work against him
---
The "Quit Game" Option looks like he's dabbing without being zoomed in
---
I though the demogorgon was gonna be a boring killer but after seeing that pounce I need him
---
Lmao imagine chasing a meg and she suddenly turns into a David
---
Yeah. There's a surprising amount of pigs that don't know how to play the Killer. They tunnel somebody with the reverse bear trap and then complain about it never getting kills.
---
She even has the perk make your choice which encourages going after the person who did the unhooking and not the person who just got unhooked. Genuinely have no idea why people who play her don't know how to play her effectively.
---
And not every game will have a key. Even then it’s really not big of a deal if one survivor does escape.
---
That’s why you bring unbreakable
---
I had a claudette comment of my profile "10/10 would loop again. Go ahead and delete this comment if you dont want to be seen as a bad killer" all she did in that game was feed me tier 3 and get downed 3 seconds after i found her every time.
---
When u ______
---
Random reaction image with no relation to dbd
---
Today is the 4th
---
In the end the swf in the group didn’t like me “doing the objective” so they messaged me and I ended up farming with him and killing him
---
Damn then, your fan sounds a hell lot like a ps4
---
That is terrifyingly accurate
---
You should of just not of stayed in the lobby my guy
---
I feel like naming myself the same thing, picking Trapper, and trying to help survivors do gens
---
* Nurse 
---
* Spirit, Billy
---
* Freddy
---
* Everyone else except Bubba, using Ruin
---
* Instasaw Bubba with Ruin and Play with your Food
---
* Everyone else except Bubba, without Ruin
---
* All other Bubbas
---
Nurse has the greatest mobility in the game, and there's nothing survivors can do to slow her, so once you've mastered Blink you are effectively unstoppable.
---
Spirit and Billy have exceptional mobility compared to everyone else bar Nurse - Billy isn't as easy to steer as Spirit, but he only needs to hit you once.
---
Freddy is very hard to handle if he combines a regular gen patrol with a proxy camp by hooking someone beside a generator. That's a lot of pressure, even before perks get involved (e.g. Make Your Choice).
---
The next "tier" is a tribute to the power of Ruin - in my opinion it papers over a lot of cracks, and solves a lot of balance problems. It buys time for Myers, Trapper, Pig, and Hag to get into their groove, it buys time for "slower" chase killers to travel the map and start pressuring.
---
Bubba doesn't have speed, and doesn't have a travel gimmick - but if you use Play with your Food then you can be booking it around the map at 130%, or 140% when actively sawing, and you have an instadown.
---
While certain killers have an easier time without Ruin than others, for me the distinction isn't great enough to warrant splitting up this tier into individual killers. For me, having or not having Ruin is of far greater importance - and virtually everyone is running Ruin at high ranks.
---
Finally, we have any Bubba not using the "ideal" combination of Ruin, Play with your Food, and instasaw. These Bubbas are slow, have no way of generating pressure outside of running a basement build (and hoping survivors fall for it), and are noticeably weaker than any other killer at all stages of the trial.
---
Please bear in mind that the highest kill rate on PC belongs to the Hag, who gets *at least* two kills per trial. Virtually every other killer is two kills *on average*, and two kills is the stated balance goal. If tier lists were made "to scale" then I believe many players would be shocked at how moot the difference is outside of the "big three".
---
Ah yes, the breast. Perfect for gaining purchase on the body before opening your mandibles and consuming the remains of your prey.
---
I think two slugged players should be able to help recover each other at a reduced rate if they crawl to each other.
---
smh my head, this is just like fashion nowadays. Kids are paying real life money for torn up clothes.
---
Same here. It helps me play more lax in general which makes DBD more fun imo.
---
I was pretty sure Blood On Your Face only procs for moried survivors?
---
What are you talking about?
---
Manually quitting and turning off your internet have the exact same effect: You quit the round because you're bad/made mistakes/are a baby.
---
This *should* be bannable. 
---
I had three rounds last night where all survivors ragequit within seconds of one idiot doing it. That behaviour shouldn't be allowed in any way.
---
From that angle she terrifies me.
---
I don’t exactly agree. I can understand that he missed the chainsaw, but the m1? Even if you’re rusty, the controls will feel natural regardless of how long it’s been.
---
\*Unbreakabro
---
DC is disconnecting from the match. When you leave the game, you can still spectate.  They are still equally bad imo tho
---
He's not nearly as bad as he used to be tbh
---
Well sometimes I play against a 4stack as a stealthy killer with 1 of them having object of obsession so he can just tell his friends exactly where I am all the time and then yeah, doesn't really feel all that fair for me anymore
---
Thanks
---
If a perk shows up there, it means someone else's perk is affecting you. If it's blue, it's one of your teamates perks, therefore it's good. If it's red it's the killers perk which means its bad
---
Low key thought you’d modded in Jason before realising that cosmetics exist

That's why they have Ptbs. So they can test and make changes

Replaced SWF with black people with crosses on their chest. WHEN DID DBD BECAME SOME POLITICAL &gt;:(
---
I wish
---
&gt; held hostage
---
Ehhh being slugged all match is pseudo that
---
I use thrilling tremors, bbq, ruin and pgtw on rank 1 as freddy.
---
Another nice combo is the basic bitch build: enduring, spirit fury, bbq, ruin if you use the palet addon. You have to eat all palets as soon as possible and the game is yours.
---
Yeah, that's the miner cosmetic set, I like to run it with the Death Garden Mask and the Circus Strongman melee weapon.
---
remember when u get full alternative outfits for survivors for buying the dlc :/
---
wait, he's out on the PTB already?
---
This seems to happen when the killer is very laggy, for some reason. Hopefully dedicated servers ameliorates hit.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeah true oceania in general
---
Billy was definitely fucking around OP :P
---
Can also confirm he's wrong. Qutting out in-game is still DC'ing and will result in you being banned.
---
🦀🦀🦀SWF is GONE!!!🦀🦀🦀
---
it’s just a meme
---
I think it's for when you see the obsession's claws moving, you can use it to pinpoint the killer location. I think it should be purple or green
---
Something small would be nice, but after whatever Chinese new year was last year with exclusives I think they stopped with them

So drop link. Nobody made you lay there for 7 minutes

---
Well that sucks.
---
Agreed
---
What's the trophy?
---
&gt; Doesn't change the fact that DCing is a bannable offense
---
Only if you literally spam disconnects like 50 times in a row. Occasional disconnects are ignored.
---
&gt;Sure slugging is boring but there's nothing wrong with it, it's part of the game.
---
But this isn't slugging. Slugging is done to gain map pressure and snowball your lead to win the game. Here the game is over and the killer chooses not to hook anyone just because they want to be a dick. 
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with disconnecting there. Why lick the floor for 2 minutes with literally 0 chances of doing anything when you can just leave? It's not like the game has a "give up" button for a situation like this other than disconnecting.
---
I was the same way with sprint burst for awhile but the glory of balanced is that it makes a huge difference when jumping off things and you get the stagger reduction even when exhausted so it works no matter what plus you have more control over when you want to sprint. I actually pair it with dead hard because then I can choose which I want to use in the moment and based on the map. Even if I don’t use balanced all game I know that I still get that stagger reduction which saves me many times. Worth testing out and trying to get used to
---
To be fair, ever since the End Game Collapse these people have existed so all this is doing is taking away a perk slot from their builds so that they're even weaker while everyone else is alive.

Remember when that was the only viable strat when hooks didn’t respawn ?
---
It's a big deal for that survivor, and that's what matters here. Left Behind, Sole Survivor, there's plenty of perks that are individual benefit rather than team-based, and Left Behind is now viable for that niche rather than useless

Here is a list of all of the current Fog Whisperers: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49385/fog-whisperers-program-launch
---
Pig's ambush at pallets isn't really a mindgame if you just run to the next loop as soon as you hear/see her crouch.
---
Spirit might be fun to play, but she's not fun to play against. You're not playing any guessing game, it's the survivor who has to guess whether you're using your power since it has no animation. Strong killer for all the wrong reasons.
---
Plague is not B tier, she takes too long to affect the game. C at best.
---
Everything else seems pretty accurate. I'd swap Clown and Plague in your list.
---
I played a game today in OCE with 40 ping. Clicking a flashlight was instant but I was being hit through pallets when I was a good 3m away from it and the pallet was already down, the killer was obviously on the other side of the pallet. And this just kept happening every game. Really odd.
---
What is that skin, how is it obtained for people. I'm new, someone explain pls.
---
Some jokes are great, some are really, really tired. I also dislike the animation style he uses; puppet rigging seems incredibly lazy to me, and boring to look at.
---
I believe because Freddy's dream world makes it much easier to see scratch marks.
---
HERE COMES THE TRAPPERR

Not really from a game. But I’d personally love to see Predator make his debut. Map would be either a jungle or subway setting. Plus they could do something with his capture/ projectile net shot, shimmer or his infrared abilities.

Bad? The difference is often night and day.

However if it’s blue and looks like an old lantern, it’s a killer perk called Dying Light, so get ready to get tunneled.... until the rework for it comes lol
---
Keep working this looks awesome
---
&gt; DCing is a bannable offence
---
It's not really. It's just "I'm out" and you get banned if you do it more than a third of your matches or so

Probably later in the day.

I like how people are saying Left Behind is decent now. Like yea it’s better then it was before, but it’s still not good lol.

Around 10am pst skins come out bro
---
Been a minute! I've been very busy, but I hope you all enjoy my new Hag artwork
---
This is still significantly better. You still get to pick from 4 perks instead of 2. Getting ruin and level 3 bbq on prestige killers is going to be way easier now.
---
I know this has been done to death, but I'll bite.
---
NOED rewards shitty killer play. So does Blood Warden and Fire Up and Bitter Murmur and Rancor. They all activate when some/all gens are done.
---
Perks that reward shitty survivor play include Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Deliverance, and Self Care (don't get hit or downed, like a skilled survivor wouldn't?)
---
OR, and now hear me out, reserving perk slots to create a specific playstyle is either perfectly reasonable, or else freebie perks like all the ones above should be removed across the board.
---
Omg, Im taking sleeping pills so i dont gotta wait all these hours
---
No, I'm just saying screw the other updates. That this was the only one we need
---
Has anyone ever actually been banned for disconnecting? It gets parroted a lot from some developer comments, but you almost never see people complain about actually being banned.
---
For anyone who has bad memories of getting slugged till they bled out, I recommend this video:

Some people consider it unfair because the SWF get so much information that the killer is at a large disadvantage.
---
Could you explain to a non player what is going on?
---
I loved watching Pug at first because of that "TAIWAN NUMBER ONE!!" clip, but then watching him in DBD made me realize he's just a bit too immature for my liking in a streamer
---
Felt appropriate for this sub. Just stumbled upon this, and it seems like our boy Mike Myers has a rap soundtrack.
---
Thsts really cool
---
Huh, didn't know that. Noted.
---
Okay im hard
---
&gt; and you get banned if you do it more than a third 
---
So... Semantics?
---
I like his stuff but he uses the same jokes a lot.
---
No way, they actually made these perks a bit playable, hyperClap for them
---
Try using Red Dead Online’s...
---
I stopped watching pug after witnessing his childish post game arguments (whilst he slowly typed looking at his keyboard, lol). Pug being an adult, I would expect being mature to go along with that. This also applies to him DCing when something doesn't go his way. Being a streamer, he should be a rolemodel in the DbD community.
---
I love it when people that have no idea how p2p and servers work said dedicated servers will fix all the latency related problems.
---
My own opinion is that this game doesn't need them as the match size is only 5 people and it would've been better to improve the p2p netcode. But since they've made so much effort for the dedicated servers i doubt they will back off anymore. May god have mercy on our souls

I said Rockstar games in general. I’ve seen the Red Dead customization and it’s... interesting choices.

It is a dick move to leave people slugged and not hooking them but it is not a valid reason to DC over. The killer isn't breaking any rules, the game is progressing, albeit slowly.

He said fun, not good. Not everyone cares about meta
---
I completely agree with you on spirit. The mind game is all on her side and for the survivor we get a killer that looks like they stand still and have no idea what's happening and it's pure luck if you went the correct way to avoid her. Not to mention they don't have a vault animation either, again just standing still then suddenly on the other side and the survivor has no idea of they are vaulting or phasing. So boring.
---
To be honest I would consider myself a Doctor main, and I always always go for hits rather than get them to their 3. The tier 3 isn’t to good depending on the addons but it’s easy for you to get tier 3 just chasing them. He’s similar to hillbilly and huntress in the regards as well the pilot can play him.
---
Old crackhead lmao xD Biker Kate should be live in 1 or 2 hours
---
Spirit is a guessing game. If the survivor has iron will you can easily lose them or they can vault to the other side of the pallet that you are mindgaming. Most survivors at red ranks run iron wilI solely because of spirit and nurse. Wouldnt put clown at B. His bottles are way too underwhelming and if you drop a pallet early he has no ability.

Grab one.  The other still working. Stab her. Hook both in like the fitst 90 seconds? I was very confused.
---
Imo its a bit under rated. Its good for a more stealthy play style. Allows you to try and hide, and if you are found out, its your get out of jail card. Also possibly the best exhaustion perk for when you get unsafe unhooked. Best chance to escape.

Naw only devs got him unlocked

I feel like the easiest would've been Nea
---
If gas station knives were a person
---
this is so cute! love her lil high heel :,)
---
This is basically the killer's way of "holding the match hostage". They fixed that for survivors now, so yeah this is considered toxic
---
You must've forgotten just how much this subreddit loves to overreact.
---
Hello everyone. I have finished \*\*Hello Zepp\*\* and is ready to post it. Next song is huntress lullaby and I want everyone to start putting more suggestions in the comments for me to do!
---
I think he just let you be dude.. lol
---
The game is survivors vs killer. The survivors are trying to open exit gates and escape, the killer is trying to kill them all.
---
The killer achieves his goal by hooking survivors on hooks that spawn around the map. You have to hook each survivor 3 times, on the 3rd hook they die.
---
You catch survivors by hitting them twice (some killers have special abilities that let them down survivors in just 1 hit). Once they are down, they are lying on the floor and can't really do much. Either the killer picks them up and hooks them, or a teammate has to pick them up. If neither of those things happen, the survivor will bleed out after 2 minutes and die.
---
Here the killer won, he downed all survivors so nobody can get up and help their teammates. But the killer decided not to hook the survivors, forcing them to stay on the ground doing absolutely nothing for 2 minutes, instead of just hooking them and letting everyone move on with their lives. This is seen as a pretty mean spirited way to act.
---
A witch, a tank or charger from the left 4 dead series, potentially even a hunter.
---
Like i tinnel every flashlight carriere lol
---
I have been running Iron Will with him, love that perk. Just mostly see other people saying level up to get self care for everyone and some other perks first.
---
To explain, unless you bring one of a very few non-commonly-used Perks, you can only recover from "dying" (being on the ground) if another Survivor comes up and heals you.  They cannot be in the dying state to do so.
---
So basically, when all four Survivors are downed, the game is typically over, but it can take seven minutes to bleed out when on the ground, so it is a rather boring time.
---
Well if you've played for three years, surely we've taken many breaks. Can't always be great. Would be a boring rollercoaster if it didn't go down sometimes.
---
Miss-spelt Harrington, only realised afterwards, please have mercy
---
thats legacy the only way you can obtain it is if you played 3 years ago when the old old old bloodweb was still around and you managed to prestige the character theres only legacy for the original killers and survivors +Nurse who came out soon after release.
---
Why proximity? Adding chat would change the game completely, and all for the sake of balance. If they’re gonna do that, they my as well do it right; if not, it’s just stay as either no one using their mic, or trying to invite randoms to a discord
---
Oh yeah thanks for mentioning.
---
DCing *excessively* is a bannable offense. I have zero problems stating that I will disconnect if the match looks to be unfun or a waste of time. I understand unfun is subjective and I don't believe everyone disconnects for the right reasons either. Unfun doesn't mean "getting stomped" either. I have gotten destroyed and had fun plenty of times. Iridescent Head Huntress? I'm out. Killer wants to literally ignore everyone to tunnel one guy off the hook while everyone tries to body block? I'm out. Omega blink ruin tunneling nurse with a mori? I'm out. Basement bubba? I'm out.
---
I would've left the OP's game too.
---
Sorry, but not sorry. I bought the game to have fun. There are some very glaring unfun aspects to this game that need to be addressed, until then I address them myself. Again, you don't need to bully to have fun. You don't need to be "winning" (whatever the hell that actually means in DBD) to have fun. You can be frustrated and die over and over again but still have fun (ex. Dark Souls games).
---
Does that mean I am leaving most of my games? Not even close. If I was then I would be banned. If it gets to the point where they really start to implement time penalties for leaving games then I will just die on first hook fast. It's all about moving to that next game.
---
Honestly though, if you're consistently (and I mean consistently) having at least one survivor disconnect in your killer games then you should really take a hard look at your play style. Killer really does dictate how toxic the game is going to be. Despite what the killer circle jerks over here believe, survivors do not hold the power. It does not matter if they all bring an insta-heal (which shouldn't be in the game either mind you) or purple flashlights all running DS/Adrenawin/BT/BL. You, as the killer, still dictate whether the match can be an enjoyable one or not for yourself and everyone else in the game. It doesn't matter if they are body blocking the shit out of you. There are easy ways to counter that and most importantly it also means they are not doing generators so it should end up being an easy game for you in the long run.
---
Yeah I see that a lot, tunnel people with traps on their head then say pig is shit. Nah, you played wrong. People with traps on their heads ain't doing gens so when you tunnel them the other 3 are free to get gens done. You'd think that'd be obvious but apparently not. Which sucks because pig is fun to play against and is a pretty good killer to play as when you play her right.
---
This is why I love Sharon so much. Mostly just uses streaming DBD as a means of interacting with the chat, she tries reading or responding to every message she can, and is just so dang wholesome, even when she's like "this game is bullshit and I hate it."
---
Yeah but he still needs some QoL improvements. Maybe after he shocks survivors get the penalty to vaulting instantly etc.
---
&gt;Pig's ambush at pallets isn't really a mindgame if you just run to the next loop as soon as you hear/see her crouch.
---
As a Pig main, when I see someone do this, the next time I face them at a loop I crouch at the pallet, stand right back up immediately, and chase them down before they get to the next loop. You've effectively broken the loop in under 5 seconds.
---
I've been playing for like two years and I run it on every killer over all the perks in the game when a match has obvious SWF or 4 toolboxes, or if I'm playing a crappy killer like Clown or Hag or something.
---
Even doing simple animation it can take forever if you choose to draw each frame by hand. I guess he could change his style to be more stylized and with a slower frame rate.
---
Competitive edge, as if this game is competitive in the slightest with all the bugs and stupid things in it XD
---
NANI?
---
Yeah, that would require the survivor to know that you're actually using your power, or they'll just vault right into you standing still. Standing still should not a mind game, and as I said, the guessing game is entirely on the survivor. As for Iron Will, yes that's very strong against both Nurse and Spirit, but you shouldn't have to take a specific perk to have a chance against a killer's base kit.
---
There's only a few safe pallets per map, after that, you just double/triple back on unsafe vaults and get the down. Plus clown has the added affect of bottles making survivors almost completely blind. That shit really fucks up visibility, especially when trying to survive an unsafe pallet.
---
Ya it should honestly be...
---
Each time you hook a Survivor that *is not* your obsession, you gain a Token. Each Token reduces all Survivors generator repairing, Sacrifical Hook sabotaging, Survivors healing, and self-healing speeds by **3%'/3.5%"/4%'''**.
---
Looks safe to me
---
And ingame she's gonna look like some playdoh figure because the devs can't code or do anything game related right.
---
He could have been telling him to do the gen and that's why he let him be. Perspective: there's more than one. The killer wasn't being serious here..
---
Nothing tops orignal PTB Kate
---
You bleed out in 4 minutes, not 7.
---
I thought he meant he wasn’t a prostitute lol
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, that can work. Depends on the loop.
---
You're actually autistic.

---
&gt;DCing is a bannable offense
---
*laughs in 2 bans (3 strikes) for comm abuse but 0 bans for DCing several hundred times*
---
Damn. I wish Xbox allowed us to change our gtags so we can do meme names like that!
---
Too late, we already got one of those in here.
---
Don't call then guy, pal.
---
Pig, Wraith, Myers: Am I a joke to you?
---
It's painfully boring and you are not ruining anyone's gaming experience by disconnecting there. 
---
Your teammates are gonna bleed out no matter if you stay or not, and the killer hardly cares if you leave since they weren't going to do anything with you anyway. 
---
In what way does disconnecting there affect the match in a negative way? I'd understand if you were to disconnect because someone died and now the game is 2v1 instead of 3v1, but here literally nothing changes. You just don't have to sit there doing nothing.
---
?? what how? The saving of steamID can all happen in the local data of each player for both party host and members.Even if one dumb troll hacks the steamID of a streamer to his local party member list, the streamers dbd client will have no issues at all realizing that he is not and does not want to be in a party with a random player....  
---
I understand why your tag is Professional Arguer, you have no point but just wont stop trying to refute basic programming knowledge
---
Did Identity V do something to stop it?
---
Not saying he did,, he must have been attempting to depip or something. But my point still stands, some people in this community will stick to their odd play styles like camping and slugging, but in the end they'll be getting less points. Bloodpoints are the whole reason we play this game, right? So why spend 5-10 minutes in a game to get a measly 5k points? Seems like a big waste of time to me
---
*smirks in plague*
---
Fuck, time to downvote myself
---
its probably because he sees with echolocation
---
all of the jokes feel like I was sent back to middle school. not funny at all
---
If you want to play a killer with no eyes then just close your eyes.
---
Why would your vision come from that point if it didn't have a way to see?
---
Should've run Unbreakable /s
---
Typical Dwight
---
r/funny and r/dankmemes had a baby and this subreddits memes happened.
---
That's not true. They once said a pretty high number on stream, I think 60 or 80% and I personally think they were exaggerating, but I've had several times where all I did was DC like 50, 60, 70 times in a very short amount of time and nothing ever happened. Those were high percentages too, DCing like 40 times out of a total of 50 matches, but nothing ever happened to me. Either they flat out ignore you unless you have a 90% or higher DC rate or you need to have a  minimum of 100, 150 or even 200 matches played within a said time frame before they look at your DC percentages.
---
The execution is different but the objective is the same
---
I personally think NOED is worst when it's not expected. So if you go into your game thinking about NOED, cleansing totems, and trying harder to avoid the killer in the endgame, it's not all that horrible.
---
playing at moms is gonna be torture with this

Sounds kinda shit.

Its cute until she starts sacrificing you to the Entity

Well to clarify, there is a bloodpoint event, but we have no idea when it is, other than that it IS NOT tommorow, as the leaked poster indicated.
---
Should implement Vultures, wich start eating you out.
---
Good art mate
---
What are the choices?
---
Or maybe you need to be patient and Relize there will be bugs that will be fixed instead of having that kind of attuide
---
&gt;Sorry, but not sorry. I bought the game to have fun.
---
Amen to that.
---
Maybe the ghosts won’t hit us with “doing gens, you?” After the match.
---
No, I think that’s a bug.
---
I can't wait to shine a flashlight into what looks like an anus with teeth...
---
Oh. So a hook is a finishing kill or something. Gotcha.
---
Well it's not like slugged survivors will get much points or rank up
---
Any choice
---
Thank you kind stranger.
---
I know OP isn't actually gonna uninstall man. I'm just relating to the anger you can get when a player is holding the game hostage, that is immensely frustrating. At least for me. You either have to DC or just wait on the ground to die. 
---
I had a game similar to this where a Hillbilly carried me to the corner of a map, constantly downed me, picked me up and forced me to struggle out, then would down me, rinse and repeat. It is literally the definition of holding the game hostage dude.
---
As long as others agree on it
---
He's not wrong in that sense, it takes WAYYY more than a 33% DC rate to get banned. On stream they once mentioned like 80% or so, but I strongly believe you also need to reach a baseline of played matches in a certain time frame before they start banning. I've had times where I DCed like 40 out of 50 matches within 2-3 days and nothing ever happened to me. Even if, DC bans are temporary and also strike based, getting banned 4 times in a row is impossible, there's a bigger chance you get banned for communication abuse before that.
---
As a survivor main, the worst Legion build I have seen was coulrophobia, distressing, Sloppy Butcher, and unnerving presence. Then they also used the game offering. With destressing they could pretty much reach the whole map with Killer Instinct so they were pretty much just keeping us in deep wound the whole game.
---
Looks amazing gj
---
It's literally slugging and the killer isn't holding the game hostage. If you're downed you're going to die in 4 minutes.
---
Ah thanks.
---
You only get banned if you literally spam disconnects every game for like 40 games. 
---
Occasional disconnects are ignored, and are pretty much accepted by this point.
---
Oh, sorry. I thought you meant frames. Oh well, I'll take the -3 karma
---
Sis
---
When discussing this with survivors, they always say "A good spirit is literally uncounterable so it isn't fair!" But you see, if you have to be good with her power to use her effectively, the devs did a great job, because that should be the point. The more skilled you get with the power the more powerful it becomes. Same can be said for becoming skilled at looping and pallet running. Just because it's powerful in the hands of a skilled player doesn't mean it's unfair.
---
In my opinion you sacrifice too much by playing noed just because you could run something that helps you during the game rather then after the game is already done. i believe that playing killer is about applying pressure and noed kinda screws you over of course you get a down at the end most likely but you could ve gotten 2 or 3 downs during the game if there was a perk that would help you pressure more.
---
but that is only my personal opinion
---
This is a quality post.
---
Probably better to keep the tutorials and help on the left. That way new players will see it before the other game modes.
---
yes this was happening, usually when people got hooked a silhouette showed up at the last thing they interacted with (usually the gens), ir at least thats how i experienced it
---
Yeah the title is just a joke.
---
Yeah, so is the comment. I’m dry, I know.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Fair play I didn’t expect that.
---
Exactly! Everyone in this situation will get less points unless they're very good at running the killer around, and even then, they will get no points in other categories. OP was playing against the Ghostface, a killer with an instadown ability, so once he catches up to you, you're dead. It's a loss for everyone in the game, because you either dc and get no points or waste your time and get hardly any points. People who play like this are assholes.
---
It was Jake the whole time!
---
It's not bannable for going like "I dc every spirit match" or "I dc on haddonfield when i play most killers"
---
Me too, a fucking Claudette scared the fuck out of me after I kicked a gen.
---
I'll sometimes do it if I'm running Dark Sense and there's a totem nearby or chest I want to search before revealing killer aura.
---
I understand. Trust me, i do. We all play games to have fun, no? :P
---
 Still, i only DC if there's someone actually breaking the rules (holding the game hostage/cheating/working with the killer...). I don't really have a problem with going vs scummy tactics. I don't care enough :) 
---
&gt; you should really take a hard look at your play style
---
Well, i do main Nurse so that's probably the reason.
---
I go out of my way to NOT tunnel or camp though and if someone DCs i let rest of em escape. I want others to have fun too.
---
I'm not exactly sure. Maybe they were smurfing or someone else was playing on their account. Or, theybdudntbfeel like trying. I honestly do that alot to derank.
---
Yeah I don't understand why people defend devs this blatantly scummy. From not banning major streamers that constantly break the rules to troll, to falsely banning people and refusing to unban them. It's honestly embarrassing how much of the community talks about how thankful they are the devs are willing to charge them money to play this game.
---
Then how come Steve keeps his perfectly-hairsprayed hairdo? How about the other survivors with relatively styled hair? She may be caught in a limbo, but so is everyone else. Even the Plague has relatively better hair, and she’s sick with the Black Death on steroids. Nancy has no excuse.
---
Played a p3 nurse who did that straight cancer
---
Doctor looks great, I'm gonna buy for sure! Not so sure about others, look kinda meh, but the quality is low. I main Feng so I will probably get her as well.
---
You can get up to 24k without hooking. Pretty easily too if you use perks like distressing/BoP.
---
Also what if they have all of their killers maxed and don't need bp anymore?
---
' Well, because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to **watch the world burn**.'
---
Ok but let's be honest, kicking a gen at 99% with PGTW is one of the most satisfying things in the game.
---
Is that a threat?
---
Good point :) I suppose it doesn't matter.
---
Hag disliked that
---
&gt;pug
---
&gt;chill
---
Does not compute.
---
I LIKE IT BIG lol
---
She was still with Steven when she was banging Johnathan. They had a fight but they weren’t broken up yet.
---
Yes she is a slut.
---
And at the end of season 2 she starts hitting on one of the freaking little kids (Dustin) and I don’t doubt for a second she banged him.
---
But hey if she’s your crush going by her track record you have a pretty good shot. I’d say good luck but truly nobody needs luck when it comes to getting into her pants.
---
This is the first one where she actually looks like Nancy. Hope she's updated in the game.
---
more like terrible
---
S L U G G E R
---
It’s fun to do this
---
Thank you i will ^^
---
Yea, because they had a longer approval process than normal because Clown is when they introduced the Auric Cell cash shop. 
---
And apparently Sony/Microsoft are wary of games suddenly adding in microtransactions when they didn't have them before and need to make sure everything is legit.
---
But my god, the legion of console players certainly made sure to let this subreddit know every day how upset they were.

I have met more claudettes hiding in locker and not unhooking team mates than actuall Dweets.

&gt; It's literally slugging and the killer isn't holding the game hostage.

Ofc he is, All he has to do is put them on hooks.
---
Nice subjective argument.

Just dont watch it, if your only thing is to complain

they dont release cosmetics for ptb, and its gonna be the base price like all the other outfits

Sweet I got enough for it and dlc

yep

The game ends either way. Slugging isnt holding the game hostage.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDqsgbtpDLk

way too situational as a perk.  LIke how often do you have time to  crawl towards another survivor to recover them.  Better off with unbreakable.  It's a super rare occurence so i don't see why it wouldn't be baseline
---
yeah i agree
---
Run unbreakable Tenacity and no mither.
---
Some once happen to me, but with waith, it was fun as hell game and kinda cool way to make game funnier.
---
Blame BHVR being incompetent and cheap, purely the only reason why they're staying.
---
Oof
---
Doing what this guy did specifically, no. It's really frustrating and time consuming, but not technically holding the game hostage. It's still a dick move though. "The game ends either way" isn't a good justification for any shitty behaviour in the game from either side.
---
This kind of comment in this sub is cancer. OP did a fairly valid criticism of a Killer and i think its good for BHVR/Community to be aware of this kind of bug.
---
Personally i main Billy when i play Killer and i don't encounter this issue nearly as much as OP. Maybe happens once every 2 games or so.
---
Don’t tell me that was a real bug. Was it???

Explains it better than i can.
---
He isn't. Holding the game hostage is urban evasioning around the map with 1 other guy left and not touching gens, hiding from the killer as much as possible while not progressing the game. Taking the game hostage is slugging people, picking them up and dropping them over and over again to then just smack them again once they get up. That's all taking the game hostage. A 4 minute bleedout isn't a hostage situation, a 15-40 minute holdup is.

Counterpoint being killers need to slug to even have a chance at a 4k tho. There's to many ways to save a survivor from hooks, and slugging 2 guys goes a long way in helping you get a chance.

And A three Dc “ Only got one kill with an ebony Moro”

Imagine grabbing Meg after she got unhooked and suddenly she turns into Laurie
---
Also as a little reminder, mutes, bans, etc do nothing. I've been ban evading for the 5th time now, reddit won't and can't do jack shit.
---
I heard poor huntress is useless now too, along with one hit shot shenanigans
---
One of these is a high quality 4k render and the other is a low resolution icon data mined from the ptb. Fucking hell what do you expect.
---
For example, Ace has a really quiet grunts of pain but he's taller than others. They are just little things and they don't make too much difference.

---
I usually try but this post gave me an idea for a slug run. And the first girl DC, no one got a gen done and when the last 3 were all down I hooked them all. Got a decent 20K points (I usually get close to max), and still pipped at rank 7. Used ruin, deerstalker, infectious fright and take down. Is toxic esque but honestly for just casual fun it was nice to be different
---
How’s it broken
---
The hag rips your guts out and eats them....
---
Gosh darn it. I actually lookedz
---
I dc if my team got no gen done after i run the killer around the half map before he hooks me. Most of the times they are rank 18-20 and got 2k-5k points but no a single gen.
---
Then i ragequit and most of the time the next game went better in every way and im happy again :)
---
Not gonna lie but I think the Billy was just letting you do again considering not only did he not pick up the Jake that was right by you.
---
He seemed to just leave the second you started working on it
---
There’s a difference between eating a badly rendered organ and ripping off an entire head
---
No, that's the other one, oblivious is about the survivor not hearing the heartbeat
---
Iri seal is fine. Especially when paired with Worship Tablet to counter-act the movement speed debuff.
---
If you cleanse you are fucked by the red goo  
---
If you don't cleanse you are insta down which is also bs
---
I mean, did you provoke them?
---
I've found that doing a fake out works from time to time, fake going left but spin right.
---
Lots of times killers dont expect you to spin so you can dodge once before they get on their toes and expect it
---
she threw up on herself and got the broken effect?
---
Yeah unless you have all red ranks there’s a very slim chance you will escape.
---
Mostly what other people have said but I'll add that if you only play one survivor you'll have to split you BP between your main and whoever you're levelling, otherwise you'll run out of items and offerings on your main.
---
And what time would that be, dickhead?
---
There are fucking morons that actually want SwF gon lol that’s the death of this game. Solo q is a much worse experience than killer but crybaby killer mains rarely pay survivor so they’re only thinking of themselves lol
---
 I was indeed! So yeah, in that case, its more a matter of just clarifying the terminology. This game has always been a little inconsistant with that, and they've been putting effort lately into getting things more in line with eachother.
---
How?
---
Just don't rely on it. A good killer might miss once or twice, but when they know you're gonna try that shit it's pretty easy to get. I've had people 360 me once and think they can do it all game, they die pretty quickly.
---

&gt; If you don't cleanse you are insta down which is also bs
---
translation: I can't loop pls hold my hand
---
I love you all...  XD  LOL
---
Facts. That's kinda the reason for The Huntress change idea because it goes in line with the Terror Radius working in increments of 8.
---
Plague is easily a low midtier killer lmao it doesn't take red ranks to win, it takes basic looping knowledge
---
It's token based and I don't know what the maximum amount of tokens is. Most people seem to theorize that the max is 9 by hooking each Survivor 3 times excluding the Obsession. Yeah there's no sudden swing when you Mori the Obsession but that playstyle did honestly just come down to luck.
---
I think new Dying Light is far healthier for the game as a whole but it risks becoming the new Pop Goes the Weasel. IE the new perk that got buffed which stalls gens and is suddenly run by everyone.
---
Effectively, a Survivor has several health states:
---
Healthy&gt;Injured&gt;Dying&gt;Hooked.
---
If a survivor is hit once by a regular attack, they are place in the Injured state.  If they are hit while injured, they go to the ground and are Dying.
---
In order to sacrifice a survivor, the killer must place them in the Dying state (usually) and place them on a hook (usually) three times.  There are, of course, ways around this.
---
There’s so much to unpack here.
---
Alien with Sigourney Weaver survivor and a derelict spaceship map. 
---
Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger in a jungle map. 
---
A vampire killer would be awesome. As well as any Eldritch creatures.
---
It's EXTREMELY RARE but those offerings can fail.  It's not a 100% chance but it is incredibly high.
---
I always just scream with I accidentally trigger a Hag trap. If anything, we hardly communicate real valuable information. It generally is screaming while running or calling bullshit lol
---
Pretty sure that dbd is the og
---
Gotta admit it’s kind of fun chasing around 4 jakes with iron will and still hearing them from far away lol, I feel as tho iron will should work against sickness, you got slashed across the face and not a peep? I little puke should be fine as well lol
---
How? The game is rated M. The kids playing this game don't have a reason to complain when the game is not suited for them in the first place. It's like going to GTA and complaining to Rockstar that the game is too violent.
---
This is Adam, Jeff, and Jane all over again.
---
thats pretty toxic
---
That works for every single killer, if you are half decent at looking they cant do shit
---
exactly
---
mfw Trapper pulls out a damn golf club in the Endgame collapse and starts putting around MacMillan Estate
---
Stranger things could be bringing in new players you know
---
There would be a roll-off period for offenses, I'm not sure what it would be. Lagswitching and actually taking a game hostage is so ridiculously rare, just take it and report it, take the time to record it and ensure they get banned.
---
Doesn't calm mind make you quiet for sickness?
---
I don’t see company run servers changing much except now killers can lag too. I wish they’d stick with what we have.
---
Even before the endgame collapse, as soon as 2 generators were completed, if it didn't look like everyone was going to survive then those players would just hide around and wait for hatch.  It's just now they can do it without having to ever touch a generator.
---
I love your art style! This is great c:
---
Yes, but it's automated and there's some ridiculously high threshold. You could go from rank 1 to rank 20 by DCing every game without getting banned.
---
Lol I said the same thing till I stealthed  my 1st killer  and got noed slapped at the end lol
---
If u do that. I will turn on John Wich mode
---
Hello! Doc main here. Nothing is more fun than running Unnerving, Overcharge, Distressing, and Lullaby. Iri King, and range shock.
---
As soon as 2 gens are done, no one is having fun anymore.
---
If the above condition is complete, and Lullaby is still up? GG.
---
nah, still works.
---
Tried turning it on and off again?
---
For me Myers, Hibilly, and Huntress is S.  I usually have the most fun against those three.
---
Brand new to the game but im 3-0 as the huntress and it hasnt even been close. Obviously higher tiers will be better at avoiding hatchets and whatnot but she is still so much fun to play.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Yeah i did, the power is still BS sadly..
---
Ptb today tho
---
Levelling the bloodweb while on the hook lol
---
You can always remap it to something more convenient than space, I've heard of people putting it on the mouse wheel.
---
David with no mither is A tier ? lol
---
yes indeed moris are a game mechanic that you need to play around, you disconnecting and leaving your team a man down is not something anyone should have to deal with
---
public test build; testing for new stranger things DLC
---
Old Laurie might kill the killers
---
No Mither is trash but WGLF is basically mandatory if you're grinding, and Dead Hard is meta.
---
Oh ok thx
---
Or you could teach him how to use perks and then hell belike, you darn bugger.
---
I watch them because I want to laugh, sometimes he is funny, other times it’s beating a dead horse.
---
“Nea the killer”
---
“Toxic Survivors”
---
“You husband now”
---
ye, so if Myers with limited exposed is mid Tier, Plague with infinite exposed should be mid Tier as well, right?
---
Dead hard can be baited after the killer knows you have it and WGLF doesn't help you in any way during the game.
---
sadly im a console player :(
---
I mean it's still a good mori. Would've been great if it had a decapitation, but it's still this monster fucking eating your head for a bit.
---
It's the man's equivalent to a total package, look at Freddy, now look at him, now look at ghostface, now look at him. He's your perfect boy. He is, boi...
---
This is funny, but also related to some pretty messed up events :/
---
okey
---
bill in d tier? unbreakable and borrowed time are two of the best perks in the game. left behind is now pretty decent in the ptb
---
Don't act like you wouldn't
---
k
---
seems just as bad honestly just you traded a neat meme perk for a boring bad one
---
I bet 100 updoots rn that The Archives will be added in place of where SWF used to be.
---
It's fine my brudda just a few more weeks
---
fully immersed blendettes everywhere are screaming at you
---
I'm rank 3 but I don't belong here, every killer that have the same rank as I stomps me/the matfh, I do great against ranks 6-5, but I can't stay there, they should make ranks to survivor harder too
---
*is that a private cinnamin bun reference?*
---
ahh yoss... again
---
Looks like more effort went into those at least.
---
\#WorthIt
---
Technically, the blue is the bonus altruistic action speed you have that's the counterbalance to the perk, but it also warns you that you're the target obsession, and if you're killed, everyone else gets a 25% debuff to all actions, unless another obsession is created. It's being reworked in the next patch to be an anti tunneling perk where a debuff is applied for each non-obsession person hooked.
---
I do agree on the first part but in my opinion the second part isnt quite right objective efficiency isnt only about getting quicker gens with perks but also about creating space for other survivors to work with dead hard gets good survivors more efficiency than leader or prove thyself does just because they can loop one more round they can potentially dodge a hit that would down them etc and so does d-strike borrowed and adrenaline the 30 seconds the chases take longer is more efficient than doing gens just slightly faster.
---
&gt; Plague with infinite exposed should be mid Tier as well, right?
---
Well, like I said elsewhere, lower mid, but yeah. Not sure what your point is. She's not "really strong" like you said above
---
Excuses
---
Aftercare is an upgraded bond if you put in effort, and Breakdown helps so you don't run into the killer and can get to safety whilst also sabotaging the hook instantly.
---
Like I said, gonna update it once the next update settles in
---
S- Dwight , Nea, and Jeff
---
A- Meg, Claudette. Laurie, and Bill (after the changes)
---
B-  Feng, David, and Tapp 
---
C- Kate, Jane, Quentin, Adam
---
D- Jake, Ash,  and Ace
---
Don't forget Ash with his blue hand
---
Perfect idea
---
WGLF isn't a a good perk for escaping though. It's basically just a BP perk slot, which to me means his perks are lower tier.
---
Old laurie would annihilate legion
---
Unless you need a killer achievement, give the last one the hatch. It’s the nice thing to do and it’s not fun ranking up fast as killer anyways, so it’s a win for everyone.
---
Yes Brother, Have Fun
---
*wah intensifies*
---
If it takes basic looping knowledge, then why y'all complain about noed?
---
Thanks now I have a picture to show people whenever they call Meg a crackhead
---
I decided to test this. I unlocked lvl3 left behind on my dwight yesterday. Hid in locker until 1 crow came. Ran around until crow left. 2 of 3 games I managed to get out via hatch. The other game killer found it first.
---
The second knife is his dick.
---
What... I thought this was a mobile bootleg version, Jesus it’s ugly
---
why not tho? Whats not strong about permanent exposed? Sure, if no one cleanses you have no Power except the exposed, but isnt that good enough?
---
Also, if at least one cleanses...
---
I love my new flair but this is cool too
---
Really i havent seen that at all
---
But MK is still M? Alright
---
It’s valyx he has prove thyself
---
What friends? As far as I know he at least hasn't got any to play dbd with by the looks of it
---
Ah I've played on a modded server so maybe some of the punkier hairstyles were modded in.
---
I like the pants and that's about it
---
what does this have to do with the PTB?
---
I was wondering why I have to buy this "coming soon" chapter before I can even test the killers/survivors. Great!
---
Depends if you want blood points or are using the Mori that lets you kill the last player
---
From the survivor POV I think that moris can be really fun ways to end the game, especially after a long chase or exciting moment. Obviously it's up to you, but I think a general guideline would be to not mori the first survivor who just got off their first hook; give them time to play a bit, and make the mori be an exciting finisher near the mid-late game
---
Just finished watching Stranger Things. Can't wait to play mah boi in his scoops!
---
Survive with friends, it’s how you play with others on your friends list
---
He is sensitive leave him alone.
---
Not talking specifically about you, dumbass
---
Oh that's annoying. Lol
---
This is real good. I can picture him unmasked doing his little "jumpscare and laugh" reaction that he does while waiting for a lobby.
---
Survivor: Bond
---
Killer: Corrupt intervention or Thrilling Tremors
---
Uh oh
---
**nut**

Nancy looking like a supervillain

# [Patch Notes 3.2.0A](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/668468/#Comment_668468)
---
Lucky you man, pc is spirit, billy, and nurse almost every game.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
Very true, but that cycles back to the awful "NOED just helps bad players" argument. A GOOD survivor player doesn't need Dead Hard at all because they won't get found, and definitely won't get hit, right? It's a very dumb mentality when you realize all perks are supposed to cancel out an error or shortcoming. Ultimately, as long as Survivors survive, and as long as killers kill, their perk setups are irrelevant as long as they assist in doing so. Except unprovoked facecampers, fuck those people.
---
Me again :P
---
I waited so long for your next sketch!
---
Very nice, keep drawing bro, I'm waiting for next.
---
As a survivor, balanced landing.
---
Adrenaline goes off while you're in the locker. Had to take it off my Head On build because it cucked me a few times. Plus Q&amp;Q and Iron Will are better for the build anyways.
---
Yep they're out
---
Then why bother replying that to me? 
---
uh oh spaghetti-oh 
---
also a certain someone is bigmad yup
---
A chef
---
Hex: Ruin.  Just to low the game down a little bit.
---
I AM AT SCHOOL AND REALLY WANT TO GO HOME RN BUT I HAVE A GOOD 2.5 HOURS
---
They are available.
---
NICE
---
Make that seven
---
Ok thanks!!
---
HOLD IT! You're not just the carnival, you're the entire fair!
---
Thanks for such a good write up (I did giggle a bit at the "All other Bubbas")
---
How would you say the Doctor and Legion are performing? Those are the two I love the look of the most, but I'm not high enough tier to see how they properly perform.
---
I think the confusion comes from the fact they specifically mentioned Legion, Doc and Clown, none of which are licensed.
---
lmfao OP thinks Bubba is a top 3 killer oh my god
---
If you added that you'd have to limit how far you can solo recover
---
except its garbage, 24 meters lmao
---
Just FYI, if for some reason the characters appear to be locked with the "Available in the Steam store!" message being show (like in [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/ENDBkiw)), just restart the game and it should fix itself. Worked for me at least.
---
That was fast
---
Considering the devs also mentioned he is a funny guy and when the Entity took him he was 'smiling in anticipation', I think he would totally do that :))
---
What I like to do is stay as stealthy as possible when the match starts and figure out who the killer is and figure out if they're gonna camp right away when they get their first survivor. If you're too much of a threat and they spend too much time chasing you, then you might get camped purely out of spite. If survivors are toxic then they usually get camped from what I've seen but that's usually the tbagging flashlight survivor. Running borrowed time is a life saver for people being camped but it usually only works really well for proxy camping or when your team is working together really well. Camping is much less prominent at red and purple ranks because it's hard to rank past that if you camp someone and everybody else escapes so that's when you have to start worrying about tunneling but just try to not let it get to you. I take a break if I deal with camping, tunneling, or lots of ebony moris because you can't do anything about it since killers can play how they want to but I've personally gotten a lot better by dealing with those killers because it's an incentive to stealth better and not get caught. I use spinechill to avoid detection and if you live long enough you get plenty of evader points for stealth. Look up painreliever on YouTube, he has lots of excellent tips for avoiding a chase and breaking a chase quickly! Good luck :^)
---
Now it’s 8
---
it's definitely possible to make decent looking characters, but it's a chore and a half.  
---
There's so many examples of good character creators and we get some of the worst :/
---
Yay. Nerf to all aura reading perks. Because OoO, Dark Sense, and Alert were such broken perks. I'm so glad I can go back to running the same 4 perks until the day I die. ^^^/s
---
(I don't mind the status effect except for the blocking of all aura reading perks).
---
Pervygorgorn
---
I wouldn’t say botch them completely, just make their appearance in the bloodweb more appropriate if they are indeed supposed to be “ultra rare”
---
Killer: BBQ
---
It's not for the first time in the shrine, it's for the most recent chapter that's available in the shrine. When ST comes out, any Ghostface perks that go to the shrine will be 2700.
---
Most recent DLC is never in the shrine, and the one before that is more expensive.
---
Did we find out if you can blind the killer?
---
feedback: bruh wtf
---
Um...you know that Huntress's lullby is already like that right?
---
L4D Witch?
---
Survivor: Borrowed Time
---
Killer: BBQ and Chili
---
*jazz... jazz hands*
---
I SUCK AT KILLER AND ESPECIALLY DOC BUT HE IS MY FAV ANYWAYS AND IDK HOWWWWW
---
Bruh hes so lit 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Nope that’s just someone’s shit internet
---
sounds like normal PS4 servers lately
---
a lot of ppl look back at the killer as they run but i could never seem comfortable with that
---
What he said
---
What??
---
Oh shit, my friend and I played against a Ghostface with that name.
---
No fix to insta-down hatchets yet
---
retweet
---
*sees your flair*
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
The only perks on that list I’d admit aren’t helpful in any situation is Up The Ante because luck has always been a terrible mechanic and needs to be reworked entirely and Buckle Up because the niche situation where someone is slugged for long enough almost never happens unless you’re actually going against a meme build and the effect is sub par even in a medic build. 
---
All of those other perks you listed are just fine in set builds because that’s their intent. The problem many people have is being dead set on a “Do Gen no heal, get adrenaline” meta for survivors and refuse to shake it up personally. Once you get the core of the game down in survivor gameplay you barely need perks and much less need to follow a perk meta.
---
It’s live now. Just got it
---
You should look to unlock Davids first two perks. One is a point perk that will help you progress faster and the other is Dead hard. You should probably aim for Dead Hard, Borrowed time, Any of the exhaustion perks that aren't head on or sprint burst, and adrenaline. None of these will be useful if you aren't good yet though. Look up tutorials on how to use dead hard. Its better as a perk to get more distance rather than a dodging one.
---
Updated PTB notes from today: "Oblivious (Survivor) and Undetectable (Killer). Currently, these status effects are applied to the new Killer, The Demogorgon, and The Nightmare."
---
&gt; *Oblivious (Survivor) and Undetectable (Killer). Currently, these status effects are applied to the new Killer, The Demogorgon,* ***and The Nightmare.***
---
Well, that's something I didn't expect.
---
I definitely need to practice this more. Maybe increasing my sensitivity would help me look back and forth
---
It's a test. For now it's now Freddy and the demo. It's going to be added to other stealth killers once it's tested on the ptb.
---
Until she gets hooked and goes bald momentarily.
---
RUSTY SHACKLES HAG AND PRAYER BEADS SPIRIT ALL WEEK SO FAR AND ITS ONLY WEDNESDAY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Its for oblivious. When you are sleeping you get oblivious.
---
BBQ
---
But why not test it on the Killers they're actually going to use it on??
---
Freddy shouldn’t have Undetectable as his red stain isn’t hidden though. Where have you seen this?
---
Already response in the main thread sorry
---
Yes, there was. They turned dedicated servers off.
---
“Ight Imma head out”
---
A brute whis blind but canse sense movment and sounds and smashes through walls.
---
It's barley the start of the school day, I NEED TO GET HOME NOWW
---
Freddy has oblivious, as survivors hear his lullaby and not his heartbeat.
---
Notes: "Oblivious (Survivor) and Undetectable (Killer). Currently, these status effects are applied to the new Killer, The Demogorgon, and The Nightmare." And since Oblivious only applies to Demo, it'd make sense (from the way they worded it) that Fred has undetectable.
---
Yes, but for me personally, it doesn't seem useful for me. I understand what you can do with the perk, but it just didnt seem all that worth it to me. And technically not HIS perk, its the clowns and id have to grind out more levels for a perk im not really interested in, so as I said before, pgtw just isnt my cup of tea. Plus half the time I dont let them get to the endgame anyways lol
---
Could you do another screenshot but of Nancy in the lobby ? 
---
Really wanting to see her likeness in game properly compared to the survivor profile picture.
---
It's a dedicated server issue.
---
*Hopefully* it should be fixed before launch.
---
THANKS
---
Thank you. From OPs post I thought he was saying these were intentional new things. Whew.
---
Racist.
---
Oh my god that's evil
---
BHVRs own unique character. Just a different backstory, not as crazy of an attack like the witch. The crying I guess would be similar. Maybe her screams of anger/rage temporarily blind and disorient survivors?
---
If you have tinkerer you'll be there before they finish it (usually)

Seconding this!
---
GOOD JOB SWF WHO RUSHED GENS IN ONE AREA NOT CARING THEY IF THEY 3 GENNED THEMSELVES SO THEY COULD JUST LOOK FOR THE HATCH AND KEY YOUR WAY OUT. YOU GUYS ARE EXTREMELY GOOD AND DEF NOT BOOSTED
---
So why doesn't it list the Killers that have Undetectable alongside the ones who have Oblivious? Why only list one?
---
Yes please
---
And I love you fellow redditer ✌️
---
I couldnt tell you why people do it other than the name pun. But its not bannable so we cant do anything about it
---
yikes that username, derrick comedy reference?
---
Dont know man
---
No. He has Obivlius not undetechable dude.
---
I am the only person that wants the left early  reward to increase to the point of a full sacrifice (three hooks)
---
Because then I wouldn't care if they DC then just because they gave up on the first down 
---
I mean why should other players get punished because of someone's else's salt and bad attitude
---
Agreed... Or some kind of Banshee.
---
Something with sound would be interesting.
---
Thanks! Will do :)
---
Because they said spefically that it wont be out for every killer.
---
Yeah but noed is a speed boost as well as an insta down which is why it's bs
---
Link?
---
I think you're being dramatic, switching to dedicated servers for a game designed around P2P is no small task and isn't going to be 100% right out of the gate for testing. 
---
Right now I doubt the goal for the dedicated servers on PTB is for them to give everyone a low ping experience. It's probably to ensure no glaring issues occur, stress testing and to make sure everything is routing correctly. After that they can open up the floodgates.
---
are you complaining about undetectable?
---
god forbid stealth killers actually have some kind of stealth while in stealth
---
The add ons I used in the match just now were the insta-down add on and the one where it sets a random unset trap every 30 seconds
---
The difference is now killers will also have latency so there won't be any lag switching or just lag that heavily benefits the killer.
---
You can also click on the portrait &amp; back out of the store page, that worked for me.
---
Big brain plays
---
This needs to be his canon face now. I love it.
---
Makes sense for Freddy, as you’re only supposed to see him once you’re in the dream world.
---
Sometimes, BHVR just says no
---
They limited themselves to no power it'd seem, so it was probably just messing around for most of it
---
For Survivor, I'd bring Urban Evasion. I've gotten so used to being able to circle trees or gens around a killer looking for me. 
---
Killer, I'd say BBQ &amp; Chili. It keeps me from the temptation to camp and helps me get right onto the next chase!
---
Tunneling off hook? Killing after first hook? Bad manners, but not an incorrect usage - it devalues play, and ultimately has a negative effect on BP and Emblems. If people get caught by Blood Warden, though, it's open season
---
Wait how does freddy get undetectable?
---
im sure it can run dbd, its not a very taxing game, idc if the cd doesn’t work or if it gets grinded up
---
*H Y E H H Y E H H E Y H*
---
And had googly eyes
---
Most good jokes are based on social taboos and messed up events, kind of redundant bringing up that point man. Usually best just to live and laugh when times get tough and remember that life is a special thing that can be taken away easily. FeelsSadMan
---
i didnt know that
---
When they first announced it? They said: Players will have the change to try them out on the new killer, then we will roll it out to our other killers and perks and add ons as time goes on
---
Like a yellow bear.
---
Probably because they just recently changed Freddy. Code's still fresh. Dunno, that's just my guess.
---
Unless you got UE already and want 150.000 bloodpoints
---
Fuck yea
---
Also with the way YouTubes algorithm works, highly detailed animations aren't worth doing. Gotta pump as many out as possible to make a living.
---
The thing with my perk choices is
---
I run DS to counter tunneling because then getting tunneled off the hook goes from "what did I do to deserve this" to "yeah tunnel me bitch can't wait to stab you".
---
I run Borrowed Time to save teammates from facecamped because getting facecamped isn't fun.
---
I run Balanced Landing because I suck at using dead hard and well gotta have an exhaustion perk.
---
Adrenaline I use because it's just op
---
FUCK YOU NEA GROUP FOR SOMEHOW LOOPING ME ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND CALLING ME BAD IM ONLY ONE MAN I CANT CHASE 4 ASSHOLES AT ONCE
---
No Mither.
---
DO YOU HAVE FRANKLINS?
---
Pretty good Job so far, Three years and every single time they try and change anything big they completely fuck it up without fail over and over
---
can someone tell me what they are dbd forums are blocked on my school wifi
---
Same tactic works for devour
---
I agree, but I'd add wiggling to the list. 
---
The reason these bug me as much as they do is it doesn't matter how fast you tap or wiggle, the result is the same, so the act itself seems pointless. You should be able to just hold a button down, or make it more involved.
---
I mean, she looks more like an idle Persona 5 character
---
Where I live school is already done. But I wish you a happy schoolday.
---
Cause I just don't really care about Head On compared to the other two.
---
Both are good at getting Bloodpoints, but struggle with kills.
---
Buffing up Doctor's Treatment mode basically means broadcasting your presence to survivors *long* before you arrive. If you build him as a regular M1 killer then you'll have more success, but then where's the fun in playing a killer if you're punished for using their power? Good at tracking survivors but not great at downing them, so stack up on instadown perks like Make Your Choice.
---
Legion's power also has a drawback - you can't down survivors during Feral Frenzy, only injure them. Legion can build stacks of Save the Best for Last at a ludicrous rate, though, so if you take that then you can be very dangerous for survivors - use Feral Frenzy to get to a hook rescue and you'll often have time to down the unhooked survivor *and* get a quick hit on the unhooker before they run off. Improved recovery is just great in any situation where there's more than one survivor on you, as well as cutting down the time you spend in a chase (faster recovery = less of a headstart for survivor).
---
At high ranks... Doctor will suffer first, and hardest. Legion still has their mobility, but the "big three" have the same mobility *or better*.
---
Heh, your downvotes. This sub is irrationally convinced that Overcharge is in any way a viable perk, and that anyone in red ranks would ever run it. It's not even good for memetastic doctor builds.
---
Just level up Nea for UE, you get Balanced Landing in the process
---
This is going to make killer mains mad
---
Anyone wanna play 8 ball?
---
THE DEMOGORGON IS SO FUCKING AMAZING I LOVE HIM LOVE HIM LOVE HIM HIM!!!!! SOMEONE BOOK A CHURCH!\~
---
This be true, thanks for the insight
---
The silhouettes look so weird and should just be the white plus.
---
I was informed on here because I'm a console pleb.
---
The official discord is great to find people to play with
---
Its not that rare, i have it once a month. If i get a 24 hour ban because i had to dc then how is that fair?
---
take my auric cells
---
not me being broke when this and stranger things come out when i still want demise of the faithful....she's gorgeous
---
THANKS I REALLY APPRECIATE IT
---
That's my question too. I expected Pig first, because Ambush seems like it would be the easiest to modify, so this Freddy change has caught me flat-footed.
---
I guess we'll find out what's happened soon enough, when people start playing some Freddy games.
---
Yup. You just have to also be way more careful in order to not get hit by him before unhooking, or else you're gonna be asleep and BT isn't gonna proc.
---
That Leprose Lichen is bad imo.
---
lol
---
cry more. 
---
it only applies while they're actually in stealth so at worst it's a situational "nerf" and these killers are generally the lower tier, less used one so it's good they got some actual love
---
thank fucking god they did this
---
the survivor main tears are delicious
---
Please don't mainshame. It does nothing but encouraging toxicity. And I am myself a killer main myself btw, even though I play both sides.
---
Yea NOW i see it it wasnt there before
---
Spine Chill and Ruin
---
What means PTB ? And when does this dlc is released on ps4
---
it's particularly hilarious that you're crying about Pig who is pretty slow while in stealth lmfao
---
I like you
---
Not new freddy.
---
If you want to play killer I’d probably see what killer has a power you like and just hold off on the meta perks, and play games until you get the blood points to buy through the hags bloodweb for ruin. As far as the swf goes, you’ll be able to find some people if you play survivor enough. Gl in the fog
---
Biker kate or apocalypse ash????? i can't decide
---
As far as playing Identity V, no they didn't and they won't. Thats why I quit cuz the number of campers were insane .
---
The new PTB 3.2.0A patch notes make reference to these status specifically. For now, they only apply to the Demogorgon and Freddy.
---
I hope they didnt remove his terror radius outside if dream state
---
They call the killer “Of the Abyss?” Lol wtf
---
Awesome, I really needed an Ultra Rare addon to a Very Rare item to let me partially counter a perk that nobody ever runs.
---
&gt;solo players are selfish.
---
Some people just don't have friends that play dbd
---
Actually, Trancas International were involved Halloween 2018, and also own the franchise as a whole. So maybe some additional negotiations with Universal may need to occur, but it’s a lot more possible than you’d think.
---
You can counter Devour Hope and Make Your Choice by everyone running Up The Ante and if Slippery Meat if you wanna play safer.
---
No, because the killer's perk are Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Hex: The Third Seal, and Hex: NOED. No room for other perks.
---
For real, dude is such a f*****
---
That’s not the name of the killer. It’s probably one of the powers
---
Spine Chill.
---
That’s the power name....
---
Some ppl just don't have friends
---
Apparently I dont know how reddit works. No need to be an asshat about it.
---
Let me guess, do you hate Spirit?
---
Probably anything with "forums" in the name
---
They're still pay off you get bloodpoints for it
---
Should have Ran No Mither and a Rangers.
---
Tell that to Mortal Kombat and Gears of War.
---
Man, i feel ya. I dived to save others (safely of course) only for them to abandon me on hook when exit gates are open :'(
---
That's not a fix, that's a roll back
---
Lol left behind was gargabe the ENTIRE time it has been released, its now not a complete joke of a perk but still not great. They really need to rework perks faster.
---
No Ultra Rare and 1 purple?? The fuck is this
---
So he does have stealth from the portals. Seems like he wont need add ons that badly
---
SAME
---
PTB is the public beta for DLC or new updates to the game, it’s only available on PC though. Not sure exactly when the DLC is getting released, but sometime this month.
---
Public test build. It’s a beta test thing for PC. Will be our for console in 1-2 weeks, prob 2.
---

---
MorezPack has been updated for 3.2.0.
---
Because there’s a lot of bugs on ptb now apparently
---
K, well in my experience, especially when we have a 3 man and we try to help our rando, he runs off and sits in basement for half the round for hatch.
---
I met a rank 20 player who ran no mither and self care unironically. He thought he could take one hit, get hooked, unhooked then healed. He thought he was 10,000 IQ but I explained how no mither worked and explained some good perks like adrenaline
---
I love rank 20 some times
---
Guys, it isn’t meant to be a huge change. It’s just a small bonus for buying the actual DLC.
---
No, I enjoy playing against Spirit. I use it as my information gathering perk. It is nice against her however.
---
The problem with the sound notification is that it could mess with players more than it would killer’s, when ruin is active I am constantly on the look out/listening to hear if it’s cleansed. Not to mention, the sound could alert killers to your location.
---
Well, you tried.
---
Freddy gets another buff to his kit that literally includes everything (traps, slows gen progression, teleporting, loop ending) and now add Stealth to that list too, but Pig doesn't get the buff?!?! Please tell me this is temporary, why doesn't she get undetectable
---
True, but then don’t be a dick to others in the game or wait for hatch for 5-10 minutes while your team does gens and loops the killer. Seen randos do this on first hook while we’re all on struggle or worse
---
It is it basically makes it impossible to escape unless the the hook is further away (which for me is always right next to me every time) or they are really bad
---
Who needs friends when you can be with Dwight
---
PTB is the test server they test the new content on before it gets released to everyone.
---
The PTB is only available to PC players
---
They're just crying and moaning about the killer's ability because they suck. Nothing to do with bugs
---
Right, but your time would've been better spent on actual objectives, which also give blood points
---
Damn! GG!
---
I LOVE THIS AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE GORGON!
---
Nah I just play the game normally
---
Bruh it’s just a worse version of hags
---
It’s being tested on PC. It’ll be released officially in about two weeks.
---
YAY! FINALLY! I've been waiting for this for over a month!!!!!!!
---
I hope I don't run into that guy lol
---
They are. They're testing it on Freddy.
---
Think about it like this: if this breaks the killer entirely, would you rather it break just Freddy, or all the killers for the entire ptb? You would be even more mad with the latter option right?
---
Be patient. You have to wait just like the rest of us.
---
Play with the demogorgon while you wait.
---
I meant with the PTB dedicated servers, do you know if they’ve updated it?
---
Biker Kate, baby!!!!
---
I like how it bloodies up the Survivor, like how they get covered in vomit with the Plague's mori.
---
Same here. As soon as I saw it I was so anxious to get it.
---
"Test"
---
*cries in console*
---
My only issue with this achievement is that it’s an achievement that is completely out of your hands. It’s up to the killer to choose to hit you, and if he or she doesn’t then *you* suffer because you get no progress. 
---
I wouldn’t mind if it were a smaller number, but 250 times for an achievement that isn’t even in your control is outrageous. I’ve missed out on so much progress from killers that refuse to hit me and hard tunnel instead.
---
Even though those perks, espcally OoO littrely fuck all stealth killers? Making them not be stealthy

---
Failing that - 
---
&gt; ***PATCH NOTES 3.2.0A***
---
&gt; ***Feature and content***
---
&gt; *Feature - Added 2 new Status Effects:*
---
&gt; * *Oblivious (Survivor) and Undetectable (Killer). Currently, these status effects are applied to the new Killer, The Demogorgon, and The Nightmare.*
---
&gt; * *Oblivious: The Survivor is oblivious to the imminent danger of a nearby Killer. They do not hear The Killer's terror radius and they are not considered as being within the terror radius for power or perk effects.*
---
&gt; * *Undetectable: The Killer enters a stealth-like mode which suppresses their red stain and terror radius, and blocks all Survivor aura-reading abilities.*
---
&gt; * *Content - Added a new Killer (The Demogorgon).*
---
&gt; * *Content - Added a new Survivor (Nancy Wheeler).*
---
&gt; * *Content - Added a new Survivor (Steve Harrington).*
---
&gt; * *Content - Added a new map (The Underground Complex - Hawkins National Laboratory).*
---
&gt; ***BUG FIXES***
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused Killers to retain collision when being stunned by Head On.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused Survivors affect by The Clown's gas to only scream the first time they're affected.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused a crash when exiting the Tutorials.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused cosmetics equipped in a public lobby not to be displayed in a match.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused the host to become stuck in the Custom Game lobby after attempting to leave the party.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused a crash when pulling the Ethernet cable and attempting to leave the match result screen in a public match.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused no audio cue when receiving a Toast notification.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused two friends accepting a game invite at the same time to cause either a crash or an Unknown Error.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused the Friends List to duplicate if the player accepts a friend request in Steam.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that sometimes caused the plus signs on the silhouettes not to be displayed.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that allowed the spectator in a Custom Game lobby to send invites to players.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused Feng Min's face to disappear depending on camera angle in-game.*
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue that caused a spectator in a Survive With Friends party not be brought back to the IIS when disconnecting the Ethernet cable.*
---
&gt; *Misc localization improvements.*
---
My only real auto include is Iron Will. After going against so many Spirits and Nurses, being able to shift escape-mindgames in my favor a bit more really helps vs most of the killer cast. Plague and Legion can still circumnavigate it but  hardly see them anymore. 
---
An exhaustion perk is really nice and useful in all cases. Any of them do, so they’re pretty much interchangeable and only dependent on the map. I personally like Lithe just so I can play the unsafe pallets and windows a bit better. 
---
The last two slots are honestly tossups for me at that point. I have had the most fun with Poised and Technician combo or the Stake Out Diversion combo. Free GSC for someone else looping the killer or even extra escape tech with Iron Will and pebble.
---
That’s wiggle, they’re talking about struggle which is x on ps4 or a on Xbox
---
When you're asleep.
---
I play like 60/40 Killer and i think this suggestion is reasonnable.
---
But i never use Noed so...
---
Hilarious. Never encountered that one!
---
We added the patch notes in the comment :)
---
Oh, thats interesting
---
Nancies unite
---
We all love the trapper
---
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON DOCTOR IS TO LEARN HOW TO SHOCK WHEN AT PALLETS. HE IS VERY LOOPABLE  SO PRETTY MUCH GARBAGE AGAINST GOOD SURVIVORS BUT YOU NEED TO LEARN THE CORRECT TIMING TO SHOCK SURVS SO THEY CAN’T DROP THE PALLET WHILE IN A LOOP WHEN THEY PLANNED TO,  THAT FUCKS THEM UP MOST OF THE TIME.
---
Lichen should reveal all auras, not only injured ones.
---
That should be an added feature, yes. After you queue in you should be able to continue to use your left hand bar and do stuff while in the search.
---
He doesn't. He puts Oblivus on surivors in the dream world since it was kinda like that anyway
---
&gt; Dedicated servers will be disabled for the remainder of the PTB as we review the feedback
---
Traduction: We turned off dedicated servers because they're trash.
---
Imo, I think it's better than Hag's. Sure it's unoriginal, but it's fucking ***brutal***
---
Why does it need changing. 
---
The killer forgoes a perk for a whole game, the potential for that end game perk to be removed even before he gets the chance to use it. That first surprise strike is their reward for playing the rest of the game with 3 perks. 
---
It's down to survivors to make sure they either book it the moment the gates are powered or take the risk.
---
I don't even use this perk, haven't in all my time playing, but even when playing against it I never stay and neither did anyone I'm playing with.
---
Yeah, it's the name of it's power.
---
Worse? It's so much better
---
I know that now thanks
---
I still wish the head came off but I get why they can't do it.
---
His power is called that
---
HOLY SHIT, GUYS!!! I was in game just now and I had no idea the new stranger things characters had gone live. I had gone straight from one game to another. Then, on this game I got the Temple of Purgatory map. I went straight from spawning to going underneath the temple to do the one gen there so I didn't get the chance to see any of the other players. The whole time I was doing this gen all by myself, which as you know takes a long time. During this whole time, I kept hearing this weird roar from up above me. I couldn't understand what was making that noise. I thought it was the pig doing her crouch roar thing but I couldn't understand why it sounded so different. It was only when I completed the gen that I went up again. And only then, did I see the demogorgon!!! And I saw all the other players were playing as Steve and Nancy!!! That was such a surprise!!! lol
---
No peepee.
---
He never DC’s? You clearly just typed in noob3 then put dc king into search bar without searching it
---
It's okay bud. You're allowed to curse in the internet.
---
Yeah definitely hacking. Why can't people just play a game the way it was intended. 
---
Saw an interesting video from Puppers last night where a fellow survivor was speed hacking but the killer was also hacking. Was a shit show lol.
---
it looks like he broke her neck with all the wriggling, idk i like it
---
I wish there was a game mode with boosted speed ( for both killer and survivor ) and the goal was to survive as long as you can. Have bigger maps! Get hooked once and your out!
---
Awesome thanks, was a big complaint I had while playing with friends and wanting to change perks and buy blood-web. Glad we can do it now instead of just insta queueing to find lobbies
---
Looks prettier than my attempt, too!
---
Red Moss I tested in KYF and it's terrifying.
---
watch yourself lol
---
You need to chose the balance between normal players and the top 0,1% that max everything, use meta perks and strats and always play SWF.
---
You can't do either, and if you chose one, the game will be unfun and unbalanced for the other one.
---
sweet now survivors have less syringes and bnps
---
Straight up this cosmetic but swap the top for the american flag top.  Guess back to maining Kate, see you later Ash!
---
Define brutal.
---
The Queen of the Silver Dollar. \~Emmylou Harris
---
*wants to hug sam and his trapper* ☺☺🤗
---
Next update " we have given Freddie the power to just mori people it's a little buff that  we think should help balance him out .... also the pig can no longer use m1 "
---
Spoilers for season 4....
---
That's the joke
---
It definitely sucks whne it happens, some people likes to play dirty and cheat in games. LOL, I can imagine the shitshow.
---
Name of the Pounce to my understanding.
---
Mhm. And since it already worked like that it isn't really any change, its more just to make it make more sense and be constient.
---
I believe this is just a lack of clarity on their part. For Ghost Face and Pig, their stealth modes apply Undetectable if I'm not mistaken.
---
Ah ok I think I didn't make it clear enough. The soundeffect should be different than the one from the hex totems and can be heard by killer and survivors however there should be no visual effect for neither killer or survivors. Will edit that, thanks for noticing. \^\^
---
For the second part dealing with steam; most of the friends in DBD I've gotten have been through playing matches. So if someone is friendly or does well try shooting them a message/friend request. You can probably find swf groups on the discord(?) I'm not that great/been busy with college but if you wish you can add me on Steam as well.
---
You know the magic as well
---
Survivor:Bond
---
Killer:Ruin
---
HERE COMES THE TRAPPER!  
---
GINGERSNAPS!  
---
HERE COMES THE TRAPPPPPPEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!
---
Lol k. Thanks for the downvotes everyone. For asking a question.
---
Dedicated servers are laggy bullshit
---
I'm confused
---
where did that picture even come from?
---
Technician only reduces the sound of *you* working on a gen. Meaning the gen still makes noise and anyone else working on it makes noise. Also, the chance to silence a skillcheck failure is useless once you learn to hit even a good skillcheck.
---
Flip Flop, and Tenacity only work if you face a slugging killer or if you run them together with Unbreakable.
---
Boil Over just sucks unless you face a seriously low rank killer. The hook aura blindness only matters if the killer can't see the actual hooks and the stagger effect on them is so irrelevant its laughable. 
---
Wake Up saves 3 seconds on opening a gate or 7.2 seconds vs a maxed out Remember Me. Vigil saves 8 seconds on any Tier 3 Exhaustion perk while you aren't running around. It affects nothing else except on-hit killer addons which next to no one runs. 
---
No One Left Behind saves 1.92 seconds on healing others and 0.24 seconds on unhooks *after* the gates are powered. 
---
Deja Vu stops becoming necessary once you know gen locations on maps and is even outclassed by Detective's Hunch.
---
You can edit your flair so it can say whatever you want
---
Yeah it’s cool but it would be cooler if the head actually was eaten
---
On
---
I wasn't too confident on the fine details of switching from Lullaby to Terror Radius (and vice versa), but the Oblivious status certainly makes it far easier to understand.
---
Thanks for letting us all know!
---
You realize they are rolling it back to figure out how to fix it, right?
---
Did the GhostFace hide behind the walls or something?
---
Really with the witchhunting thing and his toxic behavior to other less skilled players are you going to defend his toxicity? 
---
Not including the paedophilia with that eh?
---
its not funny
---
Well it's easier said than done pal. Especially in solo.
---
there's a difference between this, which is simply a counter, and the aura reading issue which renders the killer's ability useless
---
Yes. That’s how SWF has always worked. I think the difference is you can now invite friends from the normal solo survivor lobby as opposed to SWF having its own menu icon and secondary lobby.
---
Could've been said the same for survivors so easily and more consistently (some fog whispers)
---
We were are alive and in perfect health, he preferred to stand in front of me rather than look for others
---
Jesus christ, I really hope they fix it.. it's really unplayable when the game is laggy as donkey doo
---
sounds like it's a you issue
---
You can counter NOED by all dying before end game.
---
I get less experienced survivors at green ranks a lot. At red too actually, but it's too hard to double pip there
---
Exept Jason
---
I also really like the survivor perks.  Being able to see my own scratch marks was something I've always wanted, so I can practice at keeping those to a minimum, being able to show other survivors the generator I'm working on to help them find them is also really good. 
---
The new killers dash attack looks to be the biggest obstacle to worry about here, basically skips the entire first half of the chase although I've only played in a few games so far so I can't tell if the ones I dodged were because it's possible to dodge or the killer just wasn't good enough to aim them properly but stealth should be something that's enforced more often on survivors so I like that.
---
From The Abyss is the name of its overall power. Shred is the name of the lunge.
---
So why do they say Demo has both when he only has Oblivious?
---
Yeah. The game was not designed to have communication. Otherwise there would be game chat. Swf wasn't even in the game at launch lol.
---
Using third-party options for communication is seen by part of the community as cheating or and unfair advantage that ruins the game for some people do to survive with friends death squads that exists purely to bully killers.
---
I find it unfair and annoying but it's not the end of the world.
---
Yeah, that annoys me. Let me get hit or let me get the stun, stop telling me both happened.
---
I’m sure you do, but majority of solo players I play with do, and I’m assuming most of them aren’t on reddit either.
---
Low rank.. next
---
Camping like that should result in depip and 3 escapes, not a big deal
---
Like it or not we need SWF right now. Removing this feature would cause a decrease in the number of live players. I get it, facing a 4 man mic squad giving out SWAT team callouts with the best gear and META perks is extremely frustrating. It's twice as frustrating when they are toxic about it all.
---
However, not every Survive with Friends group is like this, a good number of them are casuals who at most will give a callout of "We're facing Myers" and then just talk casually while occasionally screaming when they get scared or chased.
---
I get that those rare awful experiences tend to get stuck in your head, but not every SWF is like that, besides, fewer survivors mean longer queue times. Do you *really* want longer queue times?
---
No, I just want Ghostface to be playable against kids who run OoO every round lol
---
Kinda late on this, but thanks :)
---
Unfortunately if they did that the game would have to be banned in China because they don't allow decapitation in their games.
---
no
---
noob here, what does PTB stand for?
---
AKA the DBD experience here in South Africa
---
FUCK RED RANK SURVIVORS. YOU ARE THE SALTIEST MOTHERFUCKERS I'VE EVER MET, GOD FORBID I GET A 4K BECAUSE YOU'LL BE IN MY MESSAGES ASKING HOW I'M RANK 1 WHEN I STILL "TUNNEL" "CAMP" AND "DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME". FUCK YOU, I WENT AFTER YOU ALL EQUALLY, I IGNORE THE UNHOOKED PERSON AND GO FOR SOMEONE I HAVEN'T GOOD/HAVEN'T HOOKED TWICE YET. AS FOR CAMPING? DONT MAKE ME FUCKING LAUGH, YOU CHUCKLEFUCKS SELF CARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE AREA I INITIALLY DAMAGED YOU/HOOKED YOU IN AND THINK I WON'T DROP YOU AGAIN? YOU'RE LUCKY I ONLY DROPPED YOU AND DIDN'T HOOK YOU FOR BEING STUPID. I WIN THESE GAMES CLEAN AS FUCK BUT NO, YOU ALL WANNA CRY AND SAY I WON BY FUCKY MEANS. GET OUTTA MY FACE AND STOP BEING SUCH SALT STICKS BECAUSE YOU GOT OUTPLAYED. I WONDER HOW MUCH YOU CRY WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY CAMPS AND TUNNELS BECAUSE WE FAIR KILLERS JUST CAN'T WIN WITH YOU.
---
Thanks, what's your steam account name
---
Listen here you little shit...
---
IF THE GRAB ANIMATION GOES OFF AND I DONT GET THE GRAB 1-200 MORE TIMES IM UNINSTALLING
---
It's sort of a synth/horror theme that starts faint and increases in tempo the closer he is and if you are actively being chased, just like Myers (actually forgot about him since I haven't consistently played in a long while)
---
Counter noed by not doing generators
---
Dang that’s unfortunate
---
Oh I thought they were referring to undetectable, not oblivious, but that makes more sense
---
I prefer Jane
---
No mither is a hard counter for Make Your Choice too. Can’t spook me with a one hit down if I’m already a one hit down ;)
---
Except there won't be a 2xp weekend
---
A Scorpion/Spider based killer. Or an insect one.
---
He has both; undetectable when exiting a portal for a few seconds, oblivious for survivors when they are sealing the portal
---
How is playing with the Demogorgon?
---
Player test build
---
Can't mmwait to Mori this fucker
---
wow you sure told me
---
Because Demo does have both. When he uses portals he gains undetceable for a period of time, i dont know how long
---
I didn’t think girl 2 was that bad, definitely better then jenifer Aniston
---
I want a Doll/Mannequin killer, it's a big trope that we haven't got yet.
---
Absolute madlad
---
&gt; I for one am happy that they're ditching P2P
---
for select regions*, some areas will still be P2P.
---
Counter surveillance by letting the generator fully regress before going back to it.
---
Don't worry everyone in this game plays like their new and is unbelievably boosted and braindead. You'll have those moments alot and it's amazing LUL
---
Kind of agree. Hag straight up tears their throat out with her teeth, scoops their insides out and goes to town munching down on that shit. This is just the demo sucking on their head.
---
I wish people would stop calling her Plag. It’s Vomit Vixen, AKA Bulimic Barbie.
---
Impatient little fuck, aintcha.
---
Bubba is excited for new basement victims
---
*Sad chainsaw noises*
---
 So far i know Easy Anti Cheat can't run normallly with dbd now. It connected to the game so bad. And it checks ur files every load. So it just can't work fine Untill they fully rewrite the game.
---
It’s not really a pvp game but ok.
---
THE PLAG IS MY LEAST FAVOURITE KILLER STOP HITTING ME WITH YOUR VOMIT FROM ACROSS THE FUCKING MAP
---
Can confirm, heart eyes . 😍
---
Fuck, I'm crying
---
god I wish that were me
---
*BING BONG*
---
OK thanks my guy
---
The Mew add-on made me really sad, i try to block that scene out of my memory lol
---
Anytime, have a good one :)
---
I was legit scared when I heard it for the first time. Combine with demogorgon charging at me. Haven't felt like this for a long time in DbD. Well done BHVR.
---
Alt when you just checked a gen and don't see anyone then take 2 steps and spies from shadows goes off
---
How's this brutal? He literally just sucks the person's head and that's it.
---
Counter tinkerer by not doing gens to 85%
---
Kate x Jeff otp
---
Just add counter for evey dull totem that way you'll know exactly how many are left
---
Its probably a bit grotesque
---

But don't i have to buy the dlc eventually to play them anyway?
---
*gives tips to avoid be out of the game too soon with 1 sentence of criticism* "why so salty?"
---
... Don't complain about the community when you're not any better. He just made one criticism while almost the whole comment were suggestions, don't be such a snowflake
---
I think you can edit flairs.
---
**AH!**
---
Casually faces no mither team would the killer commit tho
---
Yikes.
---
His power will scream EEEEEEEEEEO! And every survivor will shout back at him, revealing their auras for the duration of the scream. The latter one increases depending on how long Freddie charges his power.
---
Why did my brain see it as "a smooth piece of wood" at first?
---
Goodbye post. Read the rules. We're tired of seeing these posts.
---
I wish the Demogorgon stood straight up with the survivors dangling from its mouth and dropped them before the end, kind of like when Jon Jones dropped Lyoto Machida
---
&gt;Bloodpoints are the whole reason we play this game, right?
---
Is this sarcasm?  I assume it is but the rest of your post sounds serious.  Does anyone else play the game to have fun?
---
Y E P
---
You only have them when using your teleport. You cannot exit the teleport early, you can only travel to set destination.
---
I agree. I also love Nancy’s healing perk. It’s so good. Last killer had sloppy butcher but I still healed in like 8 seconds.
---
Steve, ash, old Laurie and bill. The killers never stood a chance
---
Pacifist run
---
How many portals are in the base kit?
---
No problem happy to help :))
---
She's been my main since I ground for DS before they changed it, lol.  Then I got her to P3 because I had already dumped so many points into her, and now she has all the perks unlocked so I use her all the time.  Also yeah her default blue is super bright, so I usually either do the P3 version or her green/brown outfit.
---
I didn't say it was
---
How so
---
Does Steve talk like ash?
---
I run small game hunter and cleanse all 5 totems every game. Can you guess who I main?
---
I never said it was a good joke
---
I would think so, or else it really wouldn’t be too good
---
When the killer closes it and the exit gates are right by each other they aren't at an advantage? 
---
Not everyone is going to run this anyways and if they really care about hatch that much they'd just bring a key
---
Nah dude it's been like that for a while now I noticed it a while back
---
This is so sad. Alexa play despacito
---
That's pretty cool.
---
Absolutely agree with your points, thats why I dont want to change the effect itself. I just want to do something about the lack of knowlegde because that is a major concern upon the community and I thought it would be nice to have a soundeffect for dull totems too but I too think its not really desperately needed.
---
Poor legion was hit by this all they had to do was nerf the ebony add ons not the whole damn power poor legion is garbage now
---
Demogorgon's sucking heads? Scary.
---
You can counter Iron Maiden by not exiting the locker for whole game
---
They also removed kill your friends. Now I can only do it out of game.
---
How many portals can you have out at a time?
---
I'm ready to be horribly upset whenever I play against this guy
---
I'm personally more of The Crapper fan
---
This video legit made me laugh my ass off, thank you for brightening my day up a bit!

I think that’s a little unfair to call randoms like us “selfish”. It’s not out fault that we can’t hear you tell us to do something. There’s only so much you can understand from crouching and pointing, you know. If you want us to be more helpful, you could tell us in pre-game chat about the game plan or what you want for us to do. I’m sure lots of us are willing to cooperate. Those who don’t are, admittedly, kinda selfish, but that’s just from my experience.
---
Where did i say it was bad? I said it was lovely, I have no problem with the ranking system, too quick to jump to conclusions kid
---
Lol what the fuck!?
---
Yes.... finally I can keep playing with my imaginary SWF
---
J E S U S   J E F F
---
The screenshot from the live build is only a few minutes old.
---
It's not a bug it's a feature
---
Apparently China doesn't allow decapitations in their games
---
You can counter a Mori by dying on first hook
---
It’s what she deserved
---
"haha don't have negative opinions on anything and never DARE give criticism"
---
Curse you current obligations and meetings can't wait to get home and spend those million bloodpoints I grinded out last night on the PTB.
---
I hope they take those dumb silhouettes out the background oh my god they look so trash
---
I've watched quite a few of his live streams while he animates and honestly he puts so much work and patience into each and every frame. Don't put down an artist for their style when they're giving us free content that they put so much heart and work into
---
Idk, but decapitation would get the game banned in China so thats why they don't do it
---
Could you please do one about Suzie? Your style is amazing.
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted but hey i hope you had fun in your little game
---
Took it at a weird angle lmao
---
End game builds are gonna be nasty on him.
---
God i hope not, i really want demi to be viable!
---
Hmm. I beg to differ. I could be wrong here, but I don’t think that was memeing around. Maybe he was being serious at first but then decided to screw around when he missed the first time or after the chainsaw.
---
SCP-106. At least, a killer based off of him, because you can't monetize SCPs.
---
The Old Man
---
One of his powers would be a big acidic pool he can place one at a time of, if survivors enter it they get sent to the pocket dimension they have to escape from before they bleed out. If they bleed out, the Entity will grab the downed survivor and throw them back into the normal map, inside the killer's terror radius, with a mangled status effect that lasts until fully healed/exiting the pocket dimension. Bleedout and any other status effects (except hex curses) stop when they escape, but they will be injured. Also, they would drop in a random part of the map, but a set distance from the killer, with no indication where they entered or exited the pocket dimension. Usage tied to a timer, on cast it starts at 10% radius and expands to 100% over 20 seconds. Cannot consume survivors below 30% size. Cannot grow under objectives; will stop growing when it "hits" one.
---
He can walk through walls with 25% speed, but it consumes the power gauge depending on how much time was spent walking through walls. Power gauge refreshes very quickly when standing in the acid pool.
---
You have several "marks" you can place at the cost of your gauge. You can place these marks on walls and lockers. You can enter and exit the pocket dimension through these marks and the acid pool (30% size). Survivors entering a marked locker will send them to the pocket dimension. Acid could drip from lockers to make it less bullsh!t.
---
Addons: increase the speed the pool grows at, increase the speed he walks through walls, decrease power gauge drain, decrease time between pool casts. 
---
The ultra rares could be: 
---
Sacrifice: The Entity puts survivors bled out in the PD on hooks instead, with the hook's aura surpressed to the killer for 10 seconds. Survivors put on hooks this way won't be instantly sacrificed (they will struggle instead). Grants 50% extra blood points in sacrifice.
---
Catch: If a survivor walks in front of a mark, they will be pulled into the PD unless they pass a skillcheck. Old Man can now enter the PD from any wall (but still only exit through marks) if the gauge is at least 50% full, and can find and kill survivors inside. You send healthy survivors to the PD on a succesful hit, emptying your power gauge. No acid pool. You can no longer walk through walls.
---
Peril: You can mark generators. Marked generators will have a 50% more difficult skill check when they touch it, and the other skill checks are also this difficult, with 50% more frequency. Failing this skill check will send them to the PD, healthy or injured. Mark is on until replaced. Costs 2 marks. Survivors' location are revealed when walking past marks on walls/lockers, and when they escape from the PD.
---
Base stats would be: 105% speed, short lunge, 20-24m terror radius, average height (around Legion). Kill animation would be: Old Man pulls survivor inside the pocket dimension, breaks their femur, then leaves. Survivors see themselves dissolve by the acid, trying to find a way while crawling.
---
Might look like a Demogorgon x Trapper x Freddy.
---
Kate has always been the hot one so if your into biker chicks
---
I think one of the jackets from biker dlc or heist expansion would fit better
---
The sounds he make are really creepy love it .
---
More like Nancy is too busty* 😤😤😤
---
Guessing by the description of Red Moss, the portals are “Of The Abyss” and the pounce will be known as Shred. It says “Colliding with a dropped pallet while using Shred will automatically destroy the dropped pallet”
---
Jasons not in dbd
---
The game is rated M. It could be rated T for how mild it is.
---
I love that my boi the clown is chilling with Pizza Dwight In this image
---
I had a match last night (A Claudette, A Nea, and two Feng Mins) where most of the match I spent pulling them out of lockers because I guess they didnt know scratch marks and blood trails were a thing.
---
The worst part is the Claudette was P3... And I pulled her out of lockers 3 times.
---
Next you're going to say: "gg ez"
---
I think “Shred” is the Pounce Attack.
---
Now this is how games should be! Everybody having a good laugh and enjoying the game, instead of going full try hard on both sides!
---
I know that but it means you can scout the whole map while teleporting and you can see all the survivors so you immediately know where to go to get in a chase. On top of that the demogorgon is undetectable for a bit after he teleports meaning he knows exactly where the survivors are and they don’t even know he is near
---
I mean my first game I did the same thing. I also didn’t realize for most of the match what generators were, and my old laptop was laggy so I failed all skillchecks.
---
I set my alarm for 730 AM so I could buy this when it went live.
---
**[NEWS]**
---
Trust me you aren't missing much dedicated servers are a bit buggy at the moment especially with the already messy hitboxes in the game and most games are just 4 survivor friends vs a eboinie mori killer(aka extremely sweat on both sides).
---
The people who played against me in all matches said was scary and the pounce was probably the scariest thing.
---
In this match i was using the pink addon who breaks a pallet if they drop it during my pounce. Really cool.
---
You can counter all exposed perks and add ons by running no mither.
---
Survivors-1
---
Killers-0
---
He can have 6 portals. Haven't seen at the cap but i magine you just replace them.
---
*gasps*
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Am I the only one who doesn’t think she looks that good? And that it’s a weird outfit for a country singer? Just my unpopular opinion
---
Take your upvote and eat a dick
---
😘
---
Yeah gasp
---
You don't lose your offerings
---
No listen here YOU little sh!t...
---
*DCs*
---
Yea 6. Honestly very few times where you will need that many
---
Does the unhooked person or the unhooker have to be awake in order for borrowed time to work?
---
Its only that was because the game has no way of telling if you dc from quiting or actually losing connection. Dedicated servers means they'll be able to punish people from quiting more and they did state this was their plan awhile back on stream
---
Do you have a template for this?
---
Then why is hag in d tier as her traps help with loops and legion in c tier as his ability doesn't help in loops that much and his low speed hinders him 
---
And nurse should be at least a tier 
---
You obviously have no idea
---
I'll fuckin' do it again
---
Half the new maps and most of the old maps are utterly trash for her. 
---
She's the only projectile killer not allowed to be 115 for some stranger reason, even though Plague's ability can damage as well.
---
And Clown's gas is basically about cutting loops short, yet he's just as fast other killers as well.
---
Huntress is NOT in a good place right now.  Even some of the better Twitch streamers with her like Scott and Umbra agree she needs to be looked at.
---
Yes he slows down. That add on is actually terrifying, and it's much much faster than a regular break.
---
Don't wait at pallets against this guy
---
Obviously you can still do it but it makes the game less enjoyable on the survivor side since now they have to wait to bleed out to get to the next game rather than the killer just hooking them to get it over with.
---
Why wuld they bring Jason to DBD when he has his own game? Trapper is BDB's take on Jason.
---
Yes. 
---
And feels a little bit slower than spirit fury but way faster than kicking it.
---
I think they physically can’t do that cause of there games engine
---
I can't wait to get my hands on him either! I might actually buy the dlc for once, just because of demi
---
Still waiting for new cosmetics for Pig :(
---
WHY YES, THIS *IS* A JOJO REFERENCE!
---
MICROSOFT WILL NOT ALLOW TWO VERSIONS OF THE GAME ON YOUR CONSOLE.
---
Wow that seems like a lot of work! Thank you for giving us great content :)
---
To be completely fair that skin is from an episode that predates Plauge iirc
---
Good build! 
---
I personally would run bbq, ruin, pgtw, and stbfl
---
Anyone else thinks she looks a little bit like Leilah from Netflix's movie, Bright?
---
Hey I’m a console player and I was just wondering about blinding the killer. I haven’t seen any eyes and to me the killer looks taller then the others.  I’m i right or is that wack.
---
I mean I have 4200 hours in the game and have been playing since beta. I have moments like this still. It happens.
---
Agreed, it makes it interactable but not bullyable
---
Finally the menu won’t make me feel bad about not having any friends.
---
*VISIBLE ANGER*
---
wait holy shit is there a full version somewhere??
---
Had to re-upload it and make it “relevant.” So putting amandas mask on top of my pet pig should work, correct?
---
Killers don’t need 3rd person because if there is only one person left sound is the much more viable way to find the hatch. In my experience there is a good chance that the second to last person is left to bleed out while the killer hunts the last one. In this scenario the perk does nothing. My point was that slugging is already encouraged so that last person won’t get hatch. I think it’s a problem but I don’t really think this will make it worse. I think that killers who already slug at end of matches will continue to do so but I doubt people that don’t will suddenly feel like they need to and I don’t think this perk will become meta in the high ranks. Good players don’t rely on hatch/find it without this.
---
This is a site with a popular thread dedicated to people missing the joke so I dunno...
---
Ah true. Plus people would abuse it by playing annoying sounds to the point where you'd mute them.
---
That was such a seminal moment for me. I thought it ate Dustin's turtle but the truth was much worse.
---
Doesn't seem like it, it breaks fast but it takes a time until you can move, like a cooldown.
---
Spirit might be strong but no way is she in the same tier as Nurse.
---
He 'chews' the head, kinda like how a dog shakes his head around when holding something. That actually does a lot of damage, plus the Demogorgon's mouth is full of sharp teeth
---
Q&amp;Q, Calm Spirit, Urban Evasion and new Left Behind and you've effectively countered everything as long as you crouch and hop into lockers
---
same just came back to playing the game (played very rarely a year ago) and came back to the bbq and so on
---
It’s the Farrah Fawcett hairspray.
---
Plague is 110 speed as well. I havent had many issues with her but a buff would be nice
---
CORRECT
---

---
He's not even op, though! He's mid tier at best...
---
I had hooked the Adam within the last 60 seconds of this clip. You can visually see how much of the gen progress is taken away from downing a survivor on the bar at the bottom.
---
don't hate on Jason, his daughter died of cancer recently.
---
Why though? Lmao
---
How do I gain access to the DLC? I have the PTB but I can't play those characters.
---
Side comment but has anyone ran into a Freddy who doesn’t want to farm lol?
---
I know but it is not not half transparent or pixealted AF on the live build.Like for god sake you can see claudettes bald head
---
You can counter Spirit Fury by not throwing down pallets.
---
One time I was trying to heal somewhat near a locker (SOMEWHAT) and it pulled me in the locker instead of healing me. The killer had Iron Maiden.
---
Clearly you haven’t watched him long enough to know that he used to dc against every legion he went against
---
Well, how you fix it is to bring both solo survivors and killer up to swf level.
---
SAME FOR FUCKS SAKE
---
I’ve been watching him since those amazing 360 montages lol
---
The map is so well designed, so detailed and so fun to play that it makes me wonder why all the other chapters' maps look like so much worse in comparison. Like, they're not bad, The Game was my previous favourite but even that, the Chapel or Temple of Purgation don't look like they took even half the time this one took.
---
Makes me think they got some juicy deal or they have more respect for Stranger Things. It's weird. Did they just know it'd bring in more people and put in extra effort?
---
No
---
bro you made him prestige 3
---
FUCKING SCHOOL THE PTB RELEASE THIS MORNING AND IM HERE AFTER THE SCHOOL I GO TO A DANCE PRACTICE AND PROBABLY I WILL GET TO MY HOME AT 9PM TO PLAY ONLY 2 FUC***GS HOURS
---
Doesn't matter, with the 2 Survivors and 6 perks they get from witch a few are quite frankly to good to even be conssidered to be in the game, they can't have this Killer be to weak or they lose out on buyers. Survivors will whine soon enough, they will get their way like they always do and you will be stuck with another shitty killer that only has 1 remotely interesting perk.
---
;-;
---
I believe it.
---
Might finally switch to him now lol
---
Good now everyone has seen it so you can stop spamming ebony mori's or at least admit you do it because you're bad and not because "I wanted to see the animation 17000 times".

It lunges THAT far?

No. And the actors don’t voice the grunts or screams either.
---
Like the actual actors? No, i dont think so
---
Nancy's voice got age restricted I Swear to fucking god i cant even. Did youtube think it was porn or something?
---
I love how the devs actually called one of their perks babysitter
---
**Karen no.**

Are they ever going to fix the rank update error it's been happening for years
---
\*Puts on low settings\*

\*Graphics look bad\*

No way :O

Lol if this was real i bet not so good killers will be over the moon 😄

This is the cutest thing I've seen all day, I love your style!!! what pens did you use if I may ask? ^-^
---
"The Hair"

Or run Small Game and search like a mug!
---
You’d better not dc or you screwed the team fr your own selfish gain. I hate it as much as the next guy but i take advantage of the altruism boost
---
So cute
---
I mean it looks fine on the live build,what did they do to turn it into this?
---
Glad you like it 😊
---
“Babysitter”.
---
I’m in absolute love.
---
what did you/they do?
---
What?
---
Four players versus one player.
---
Player versus player.
---
PvP
---
Yeah, that's how it works.
---
Happy Cake Day! :)
---
It’s Black Incense.
---
&gt;Hit them in the head for a one shot.
---
This isn't accurate. I've had multiple one shots while hitting survivors on the foot.
---
Wait so the portals aren't the good part of his power it's his damn lunge? Like does the lunge just completely make the portals not worth using or what?
---
to cool for school
---
Nurse is excited for new people to make uninstall

Yes but actually no

---
Epic
---
Can this be used ingame?
---
TWO WEEKS? FUCK ME
---
Jason in the Thumbnail lol
---
What hag skin is this again?
---
I've never dc'd from dying light. I've never been that miserable from it, dont see it that often anymore. The boost is nice but once the killer found me I was their only goal until they killed me. Made for some fun games :T
---
Demoigoron? Are you the pregananant guy :p
---
I mean the portals aren't bad or anything, I just rarely used them in comparison to the charge attack. The charge attack goes really far and you can actually hop small gaps with it.
---
So Skyrim it’s not allowed in China? Just wondering
---
*Shadman confirmed as next killer
---
A new perk from the Stranger things dlc, on Nancy, called "Inner Strength." When you cleanse a Totem, Inner Strength activates. Once active, hide in a locker for 10/9/8 seconds while injured to be healed. Inner Strength deactivates after you are healed.
---
I wish the killers can see what they look like while doing stuff like that😂😭
---
It's not the code, it's the dropdown menu over it.
---
You dont need a code.
---
DCing won't happen. Most people DC via quitting the game through the menu. Devs literally have an option to quit the game for a reason. Why would they have it in if they didn't want people doing it?
---
Good, I’ve had soo many bad games just cause of dying light where the survivor dcs and we’re all fucked because of it.
---
No they dont reset. Its lockedo ut when you place 6
---
They also removed the "Switch to Survivor/Killer" button so now you have to back all the way out to switch. Please bring this button back!
---
Survivor gets a decent perk, NERF IT! NERF IT NOW! SURVIVORS OP PLEASE NERF.
---
You should always be aiming at the neck/chin area anyways, regardless of killer.
---
but the gorgon is giving them kisses :(
---
You've done a pretty good job so far
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/84219/
---
This is the link to the official DbD forums with info on the PTB!
---
Shit I didn’t know that, I always tried aiming at the face, thank you!
---
does anyone know if these are the actual actors or just good impersonations?
---
Its meant to be there for if the killer holds the game hostage or the game glitches out. The devs said they want to punish frequent leavers.
---
“The survivor’s rulebook for killers!”
---
“Is there a killer’s rulebook for survivors?”
---
“*Hahahahaah*”
---
It’s starting to feel like he’s just another killer main who picks on survivors.  Some are godawful with their “rules” but there’s no “if someone dc’s you must play nice!” it’s always just been frowned upon to camp, tunnel, and slug.  Anything else is fine to do, even if annoying.
---
I read that as 32 kills lmao I was like fuck is he teleporting to other matches now? Swiping kills from Doctor
---
You husband now
---
If you buy the DLC you get the extra cosmetic.
---
only on PC
---
hahaha, I want him to be in the game so bad.
---
Original post made by u/PotatoBoiXavier
---
Honestly that's kinda depressing the main ability gets outshined by the damn secondary ability. Got one question though is the attack circle to the ends of the screen allowing you to hit survivors that are near the edge of your screen or is it tinier?
---
you most likely won't get banned for it. both EAC and BHVR told us they don't really care about those. you just replace the files
---
Wait does the Demogorgon have a custom chase theme like Myers?
---
So this does infact work ingame ?
---
To give more diversity in survivor models, up until Jeff they all kinda looked the same with David maybe being a bit more muscular. After Jeff we got Jane and she’s completely different to the other female survivors who all have the exact same body.
---
Wut
---
Ok thank you so much
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
Jeff is her stand!
---
Low usually looks better and is better for performance since the game is unstable as fuck. They've changed something to make it look like shit
---
This isn’t real life it’s a game, I’m not saying they have normal heights but seriously look at them in game, every male character is tall and blocks the middle of your screen lmao it’s insane. But yeah Steve is a god I height
---
Like seriously, I spent 9000 shard on Jane not even a week ago to get Head On.
---
Like how Zer0’s B0re worked in BL2?
---
SWF is still in the game, it's just merged into normal Play Survivor now.
---
That joke was hilarious! 
---
"you know I can't read...without my reading glasses!"
---
No, that would be myers
---
I don't see any reason for them to move it. It doesn't really give any information away other than the killer you're up against. 
---
And it's not information that can be used against the killer. It's just a cool thing that's awesome to reflect the beastly nature of the monster you are up against.
---
MEH
---
🧂
---
I love Doctor, but I'm often wooped even when I'm on my A game.
---
No, you can use the perk several times, so long as you break a totem to activate it.
---
agreed its cool
---
By far the most attractive she's ever best she's ever looked, imo.
---
They just took a well known killer from ST and put him in the game, it doesnt matter if the demo is dead the game has nothing to do with the series.
---
“*lol i’m having a staring contest with the killer*” - baby steve, R.I.P
---
wtf xD
---
yeah but that's not a fix. starting to look at a problem to solve it isn't having fixed it
---
You even said it yourself "especially it being the best perk" i dont want crutch perks like that, its a good concept for a perk for sure but its just way too fast. No way it should outheal actually healing by another survivor. Look at self care, its pretty slow but still a good perk
---
I actually didn’t know this either. I never use flashlights because I could never get them to work. Thanks!
---
I still wanna know the backstory though as I like reading them and if it's a specific demogorgon or a random one
---
Everything is hard when you play Leatherface
---
Why you gotta do the doc dirty like this? PepeHands
---
Oh man this is good
---
How would you do that? Almost no one ever uses game comms in other games like R6 or other team-based games.
---
Really though, people are just so hyped up about the new killer and the fact that it comes from Stranger Things so they're not willing to accept that it's not the absolute best mori out there. The Hag's mori is still the most brutal there is currently but I'd put the Demogorgons in the top 3. Like a lot of people said the mori would be better with an actual decapitation, even if China doesn't allow that they can always sensor it for that one region. Video game companies do that all the time.
---
Oh yeah im excited for this perk and i wanna try that combo, but its just way to fast for healing
---
pfff poser &gt;.&gt;
---
I like outfits that dont fit with a survivors theme and are different.
---
You haven't bought me dinner yet.
---
**loud annoyance sigh**
---
P3 Claudette: “say sike right now”
---
My demodog is named Dwight. He hides in lockers all the time
---
As a killer you never have a valid reason to slug all 4 Surviviors.
---
Demogorgon Rave
---
yeah, do you expect them to have it fixed without looking for the solution? thats what you implied with your post. it really doesnt matter anyways, especially since they don’t fix bugs during the PTB
---
In how many games you escape thanks to the key? It's useless. Using perks instead of key add-ons is always better, yes, they have shorter ranges, but they don't have limited use, you don't lose perks after match, you don't have charges on them. Keys have purple and red rarity, very few charges, you lose them when you die unless you use purple offering/purple add-on, you lose them when killer runs Franklin's, you lose them when you use it main ability - open the hatch - unless you have purple add-on, you lose it when you run out of charges. Pretty useless.
---
When I play Bubba I'm only excited for Jake's tho
---
Yeah, I'll imagine this from now on, behind the mask. Nice work.
---
If they remove it I will be extremely disappointed
---
Mods?
---
ok
---
How do you not know this bro...
---
AH!
---
Now close your eyes
---
For whatever reason when Steve gets sacrificed while spectating, Steve's hair teleports down to where his head is when standing.
---
The entity must of just picked a random ome since it was tired of taking human killers
---
His ebony add ons werent the problem. It was that his power made it so that a survivor would unevitably go down with no counterplay if legion just get chasing and activating feral frenzy. This on top of the moonwalking exploit was just ridiculous. Even with all of this the killer wasnt even strong, just obnoxious and unfun.
---
Takes about 3 secs longer than insta heal wtf
---
They most likely just sensor out the decapitation for that region, BHVR could do that if they wanted but I've heard before that they don't make the mori's extra gory because they don't want it to come off as cheesy like Mortal Kombat (just an example) and they want the player to be scared. I personally wouldn't mind the extra details to make the mori's more intense, but maybe when the company gets bigger they'll have the manpower to do all that.
---
That sounds fucking Lana Del Rey style. I love it
---
Yea another said it just grabbed a random demogorgon
---
As I stated give a generic voice chat for everyone in the game and then buff killers, not buffing them for SWF. Or do something else, idc it was just one idea to stop people complaining about swf
---
IM REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT DEDICATED SERVERS ACTUALLY SUCK AFTER LIKE A YEAR OF DEVELOPMENT. IT'S LIKE PLAYING WITH RED PING AND THE LAG MAKES KILLER VOMIT-INDUCING TO PLAY. PLEASE GET SOME KIND OF PLAYER PREDICTION LIKE A NORMAL MULTIPLAYER GAME. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
---
Bond and Incidious (Hehe)
---
&gt;Survivors will whine soon enough, they will get their way like they always do
---
It's interesting to hear some weak points about the demogorgon as all I've been seeing is that damn lunge and how good it is. Any other weak points about the demogorgon or good points?
---
i mean i don't expect a fix this soon, but you did say they fixed it bruh
---
Is your flair and Sr Pelo reference?
---
Definitely swap out Windows. Having decisive active while you’re in a locker healing is an amazing combo.
---
Boo me all you want but the perk was better before it cut the time of ds in half and it was beautiful
---
Everyone dc’ed against legion
---
But you don't censor that in the case of something like an online game. It's like what happened to seige
---
Virgin "Blunt Weapon" vs Chad "Bare Hands"
---
Well theyre kinda running out of unique things to say. 'This survivor is good at looping and teabagging to get that killer ragequit in no time!'
---
There is absolutely no way the PTB will be 26 days long.
---
Then beg
---
Turn it up and drop the beat!
---
Yeah. This morning I created one about pig
---
Edgar for Chonky Jane but Vince for pretty much every thing else.
---
apologies kind sir.... it needs to be put somewhere though
---
The hit box is weird, I had a killer line up and whiff. It’ll take some practice but I agree it’ll be tough to counter.
---
I JUST MISSED RUIN ON THE SHRINE FUCK MY LIFE.
---
It's been confirmed for the 30th. It's on the Steam page
---
It's ptb these kind of things are expected
---
Look it up

I just recently found his channel and he's now my fav dbd streamer besides Noob3.

Low usually doesn't look better. Idk what kinda backwards day bs is that.

---
Personally, I have played this game enough (devotion 2) to feel confident without the extra information Windows would give me. That’s really what your decision boils down to.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Whispers, Nurses
---
She's very slow which is why you should really use and learn to use Whispers, because the faster you can locate a survivor on a very slow moving killer the less time you waste. Tracking is really important, hence the BBQ/Nurses
---
Vinc3ntVega....your welcome
---
So it kinda balances it out making him mid tier or what(it's all subject to change but the demogorgon seems perfectly balanced)
---
FunGoose is pretty damn legit.
---
No, it isn’t.
---
Looks normal to me
---
Chonky Jane time is so fun
---
DAE notice low is incredible while ultra setting is utter dog shit?
---
Fair enough
---
The better one
---
It is
---
JUST THIS LAST HALF HOUR HAD TO PLAY TWO GAMES IN A ROW WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAL ANYONE! I AM BAD ENOUGH AT THIS FREAKIN GAME AND JERK KILLERS HANG OUT IN RANK 15 WITH ME SO ITS JUST SO GAME BREAKING TO NOT BE ABLE TO HEAL!!!
---
Otz for the theory, tru3 for the practice.
---
Then monto for fun, and farmer john if he ever uploads
---
No it hasn’t. It’s a placeholder. It’s coming out before the 24th, that’s all we know.
---
Any guessings for the release date?
---
Haha, oh man, you got weeshed
---
That sounds busted but I obviously haven’t experienced it for myself yet.
---
\**When everyone forgets literally every COD since the beginning of time was P2P on consoles, and not a single person complained about connection issues*
---
Although I should note, the host leaving was a big issue and they couldn't properly figure out until MW2 or Black Ops. But they did, and it just worked.
---
Thank you so much I was looking forward to that
---
The Switch version comes out on the 24th, it's not possible to release it before the Switch version releases, so it must be sometime after
---
I just wish we had more country or glamor outfits for her that’s all
---
Maybe it’s the new theme for all the killers but I’ve only played against gorgons. I’ll check and get back to you.
---
No it [isn’t](https://imgur.com/gallery/yI8sjIY)
---
Berticuss for the looks
---
FunGoose for learning
---
Hexy for personality
---
True for analysis of things
---
I'm also liking TricksterShadow because i faced him a few times in game and he's pretty good.
---
Does the whole invitation/friend system work with dedicated servers off?
---
no problem :3
---
Meta was ruin. Now it's pop.
---
No you can't. You can't look around when you are teleporting. You are only looking directly into the tp spot.
---
I KNOW EVERYONE IS EXCITED FOR THE PTB BUT ON XBOX ONE IM FUCKING TIRED OF POOR CONSOLE OPTIMIZATION I FEEL LIKE THIS GAME DROPS FRAMES LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER I CANT EVEN GO TO THE STORE AND BUY A SKIN WITHOUT IT TAKING 10 YEARS AND EVERYTIME IM IN A CHASE THE FRAMES DROP
---
Thanks you just got him a new sub

That's why I flaired it under shitpost instead, plus I wanted to elaborate if people didn't get it.
---
They set a deadline for dedicated servers to be released before the end of summer. That is the 24th. Dedicated servers are coming out with the next chapter. The Switch release has nothing to do with it. Besides, the PTB is only 2 weeks long. Always has been. Stop bullshitting.
---
Hag: gets bloody hand
---
Survivors: yo whos that killer
---
I don't think the theme of the character should outweight the balancing needs, but alright.
---
Amanda doesn't have the same philosiphy as John Kramer, she doesn't give people the chance to escape, she makes unwinnable traps.
---
Which also fucking confuses the hell out of me how she was going from comforting a teenage boy in Saw 2 to putting people in unwinnible traps because she's a psycho
---
This looks like a very solid build.
---
It’s not a Demogorgon bug, I’ve blinded killers while carrying survivors and they didn’t drop them.. sometimes the killer is ALMOST 100% blinded and you’ll get the points, but if there’s a tiny space on the killer screen where they can see, they won’t drop.
---
Hybrid panda. For that fun but still educationally atream
---
If you have a PC.
---
I dont know, hes at least VERY close to Freddy level, map control and molbity, good chase, minior stealth and tracking.
---
HIS VIRGIN HAND CAN HOLD A BEER NOW
---
It’s jugglypuff as seen from above!
---
*Public* test build
---
I’m glad she found her lost shoe ;–;
---
That’s most build. Ruin to stall the game a bit, Pop and BBQ to keep pressure. It’s a fucking nightmare to play against whenever I face it myself, and love it for him. 
---
Brutal Strength, Sloppy Butcher, Enduring. He has plenty of options for his last perk slot and he’s just so fun.
---
Hell yeah! Awesome screenshot
---
These Nancy's are too afraid of the truth that Steve is better
---
Nobody is going to complain about Inner Strength.
---
do you just call every woman you talk to a thot
---
I really love the improve your gameplay/video review series from Ohtofu, he really hammered the importance of map pressure as a killer.
---
OMFG!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO NACY'S FACE????
---
I like his stuff but coming on here and going into almost any thread and seeing the same random "I watched Samination! * joke here* " comments on every thread is so annoying
---
No, because Joe Keery and Natalia Dyer, the actors of Steve and Nancy in the show, didn't come and voice the characters for some reason.
---
Yes. Just right click dbd in your library, go to properties, beta tab and select public test. The game will just need several minutes to update. Every thing you do in the public test build will not be saved to the live game so have fun with all your items and add ons!
---
You honestly believe that a PTB for what could be the biggest chapter in DBD history adding dedicated servers, ***two*** survivors, a new killer, a new ***map***, ***nine*** perks, and more won't last for 2 weeks.
---
Its weird seeing how few people said noob3
---
I don't think a single Killer main is going to say Inner Strength is OP.
---
&gt; personality
---
that's one way to put it i guess lol
---
If they did itll get banned in china
---
#AH!
---
I for one think Small Game gets slept on. It helps counter 3 killers and NOED, and gets you those sweet sweet bloodpoints.
---
Please don't give me a ranking boost as killer, I'm trying my absolute hardest not to get to red ranks too fast every season. Ranking up faster would honestly be a punishment for the killer.
---
&gt;30-minute stall time to get into any more matches for both parties that disconnect
---
Why? You can have people crash, get stuck in a spot, get held hostage, etc. Not every disconnection is bad.
---
The lunge on demo is nasty
---
Where’s Zubat?
---
Inner Strength activates whenever you cleanse a totem(not sure of needs to be hex) and gives you a buff that heals you for being in a locker for 10 seconds right?  Seems kinda situational?  It takes about 26 seconds to self-care, and you need to break away from a chase in most cases anyway. So it's a conditional, limited self-care that halfs the time of self-care.
---
I kinda like small-game better, if only it would temporarily reveal the aura of the item it detects for getting rid of hexes. I try using it and it's incredibly innacurate, and if the killer can lay traps it's basically worthless.
---
Inner Strength just doesn't really sound...that good? I mean not bad like some of  the other ''weird healing'' perks but not something I could imagine killers raging about.
---
i just realized we need an old woman as a survivor, it would be cool.
---
Just right click dbd in your library, go to properties, beta tab and select public test. The game will just need several minutes to update. Everything you do in the test build will NOT be saved in the current live game. Have fun!
---
Jeez, and I though the hag was a messy eater.
---
Too advanced for the animation department I guess
---
I'm confident on most maps, just forget sometimes and like to know when a pallet is or isn't there too because of someone using it.
---
That and I'm still not use to all 9 variations of Badham there are now. Lol.
---
Well, yes because that’s what’s happening.
---
usually a week or 2 after the PTB ends
---
I can respect that.
---
Tru3 and Umbra, sometimes Hexy but not usually as of late.
---
Yes, I'm an idiot lol
---
Eh, nobody is really going to complain about it. The only people complaining are toxic baby survivors such as yourself that are complaining about people who aren't complaining.
---
Plus, why are you acting like the game and perks aren't heavily SWF favored already 😂😂 the only people who say it isn't haven't made it to red ranks.
---
in DBD it does since the heavy shading and blurryness of ultra can be really hard on the eyes. 
---
Making low worse on purpose is fucking dumb, just keep it as it is.
---
I didn't know they posted this, excellent! Unfortunately those stats are quite vague, especially because there are so many variables to take into consideration in the category of team size. I would really like to see it broken down more, such as: by platform, rank, region, and what timeframes are used. For instance, was this data collected before or after a rank reset? How many days worth of data did they collect? Without more specificity it's not very beneficial.
---
Lolllll
---
My suggestion to you is... 
---
Don’t get so easily upset by someone complaining 
---
And
---
Don’t name call. It just shows how childish you are
---
I'm listening to broken by lovelytheband and it looks like they're dancing
---
This new chapter is amazing. I'm so glad, that after 3+ years, they're finally coming out with a new gamemode and implementing dedicated servers!! I can't WAIT!
---
That’s Megs Mom
---
thank u I knew what that was but just not the acronym 😂
---
What is?
---
Lookin like a used bendy straw
---
I forgot Zubat damn it
---
Says who? Last I checked Jason is still tied up in a lawsuit that could take years yet.
---
&gt; while the range of the detection is only 4 meters
---
are you sure? i saw someone post a video of Demo guarding the gates from across the map and they were able to activate killer instinct
---
I personally love it.
---
ZubatLEL, Noob3, Monto, Scott Jund and Ussylis
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TUNNELING AND CAMPING ON THE PTB ITS THERE FOR FUN NEW BUILDS NOT SO YOU CAN JERK OFF WAITING FOR AN ALTRUISTIC FUCKING STEVE TO RUIN MY DAY
---
It shouldn't as it breaks it on contact
---
Can you blind him?
---
If I'm not trying to do anything specific I run BBQ, Ruin, Iron Maiden, and Nurse's Calling.
---
They brought bubba when they had hillbilly.
---
I don't see it simply happening because of the ongoing lawsuit tying up any new content for jason for potentially years to come.
---
All cocky survivor mains have a minority complex that they obviously felt like they needed to let out on that kid.
---
Gaming on WiFi surely can't help. Can you not get an ethernet cable?
---
1: don’t
---
2: play legion
---
So you'll have to plan them out similar to trapper and hope survivors clense a few thoughout the match
---
I like this power a lot
---
They could just release this version in the censored builds
---
You can counter Ruin by not doing gens.
---
Prove me wrong...
---
BHVR will alway cater to the 4/5th of players becasue it's better to have a killer disgruntled then 4 survivors that whine and nag like a sow in her mire!
---
Well we did it boys. Make Your Choice is no more.
---
I know what you mean. It's always enjoyable when we can have funny moments like this.
---
I love it so much.
---
Typical. Deletes his comment and tries his best to hide that it was ever here.
---
Why is he grabbing her boobs? xD
---
I personally think that you should have put a spoiler tbh
---
Sound like a baby but what’s ptb mean?
---
Really? The PTB lasting 2 weeks. It always has, and it always will. 3 more perks being added won’t change that.
---
&gt; Data involving rank was collected shortly before a rank reset (April 1st to April 7th).
---
Downvoted for encouraging people to be nice to each other...
---
If I see one ingame I’m letting her live 🤤
---
Not in my current location, unfortunately; when I'm at home, I have my Xbox wired up, but when I'm visiting family for long periods of time such as rn, my hands are tied. I intend on buying a wire ASAP, but that's hardly a bandaid solution as of right now...
---
...Oh no.
---
Mommaaaaaaaa, I just killed a man
---
They're groovin'
---
He looks really average to me. Nothing really stands out about him
---
The entity didn’t want you dead it was asking you to take a leap of faith so it could assimilate you into the ranks of killers. You failed the test.
---
Ye fair enough mate
---
You got issues if you get politics level heated about this kind of stuff
---
*sees stampede of crack shippers approaching*
---
Oh no.....
---
Iron maiden isn't a counter. It'll only work after the survivor is healed. If anything this perk will just increase tunneling. Can't heal on a hook and if they have comradre leave them bleeding on the ground.
---
I feel like the only thing inner strength will be good for is maybe doctor since skill checks can be a pain or with huntress Lullaby active. That's honestly all I can think of.
---
Is there any place other than PTB where i can see the new survivor/killer perks?
---
oh people have been
---
it seems like it's chilled out a bit, though
---
For Learning Otz! 
---
For fun any small streamer that's playing for the first time and is scared
---
Power is making the "female" killer getting a raging hard on. And for the survivors to turn into lolis i guess.
---
Kinda looks more like his posture changed to me.
---
Pain reliever because he isn't obnoxious and doesn't try to clip memes into his gameplay like others.
---
Otz is good for brainstorming. Tru3 is good consistency and for seeing both sides. Hybrid is a cool dude. Space Coconut is all around great and I want to see him able to go full time.
---
Those are the mains.
---
There are some people who don't know of Otz and those people seriously need to check him out
---
Yeah you tell yourself that pal
---
Bubba was from a franchise up for the taking, Bubba really isn't that bad actually, Billy is just to good, there is a reason rank 1 games either have a  Nurse or a Billy.
---
The big thing is they can't nerf all killers, so they choose to sectively keep the older killers strong, none of the DLC killers have staying power to match Billy or Nurse. (Maybe, arguably Spirit is actually good 2, I mean you can get 4k's with her without perks, add-ons or offerings by just using headphones)
---
Public Test Beta
---
Public test build.  Basically the test servers before updates are officially released.
---
this also prevents someone from being hooked there again, thus saving your teammates.
---
BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, I'm all ears. Swap I'm all ears for iron maiden if you have iri head
---
Ahh thank u &lt;3
---
You can counter Make your choice by looping the killer around the hook you dummies.
---
I know I’m super late but they announced the Archives coming out with this chapter
---
I see. I'm not judging, was just curious because I had a friend that was oblivious to the fact that signals can be interfered with on WiFi and whatnot. Aside from that, I really wouldn't worry much about being banned. The devs would be able to tell if it was intentional or not, if they even bother to look. If I can recall, you would just get a softban for 24 hours for your first offense anyway. If that happens, then start worrying.
---
TO THE NEA THAT DC’D RIGHT AS THE GAME STARTED SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU SAW THE FREDDY TIMER, FUCK YOU!!! YOU WASTED AN ENTIRE GAME FOR 4 PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU’RE TOO BIG OF A CRYBABY THAT PICKS AND CHOOSES WHO THEY WANNA PLAY AGAINST!
---
For the record, we aren't going to run Mad Grit. We are going to run Haunted Grounds
---
No one knows
---
That's rough, while I personally understand not wanting to play with kids, they should just kindly leave. Imagine bullying a kid as an adult, yeesh
---
It's the Playable Test Server, they drop unfinished/unbalanced stuff there so people can test it before they implement it in the live game
---
The totems could have a small representation of the perk over it, just to help out
---
I'm positive they could implement more gore if they chose to, but I recall them saying it had something to do with "If the there were ever any decapitations in the game, they wouldn't be able to sell the game in certain regions of the world" Or something. 
---
Imagine if they implemented the type of body/model deconstruction in Left 4 Dead 2. By just changing the alpha on certain parts of the models mesh, they could anchor new gore models to them, giving the effect of exposed ribcages, missing limbs, etc. 
---
https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf  Here is a really cool indepth example of how the effects are made, and on an old source engine from 2004. And with survivor heads already being a separate model from the body, beheadings probably would never be easier for them if they decided to do so.
---
Yes go to Steam game library  -&gt; DbD -&gt; Properties -&gt; Beta and opt in for PTB
---
We need to see more of the Demigorgon to really make a judgement call. He’s sort of a mix between Freddy and mint rag hag with a lunge attack in a similar vein as pig while still being unique compared to each of those killers, I have a feeling he’ll be a pretty decent high to mid tier killer just like Freddy and Hag. Freddy is a safe buy while Demigorgon is at least a semi-risky buy assuming you want to just buy a good killer
---
This meme
---
Yup Badham will throw almost all of us a little off, lol. Can’t wait until every map is reworked! /s
---
It helps a lot as killer. Don’t have people spawning on Ruin instantly
---
Oh i forgot the bear traps forgive me he uses them in his game too.
---
Them not adding him has nothing to do with similarities because they based a killer on him.
---
It has everything to do with the ongoing lawsuit and that the rights are in legal limbo.
---
I'm sure if the price was right they would lease his likeness to anyone who could pay.
---
Personally i want new movies and a better stand alone jason game. Not have him in dbd.
---
Aww thanks for the advice!
---
As a bill main Freddy is the death of me.
---
Np, friend! I'm a ps4 user too, unfortunately i don't think we get access to it tho...
---
I’d agree, and honestly the majority aren’t? But a good 40% of the people I used to have on my team would sit in corners and be useless so it’s not like I’m just makin shit up.
---
Yeah, cause MoM was in no way almost game breaking and neither was Autodidact... You get enough skills to secure safe unhooks and self healing (especially with the new self heal perk coming out with the DLC) you really shouldn't be worrying.
---
If you can't hack it playing a survivor... stay away from the killers, 'cause let's be honest the one one only reason people main survivors and don't touch killer is because they are afraid they are going to go against survivors that play just as toxic as they usually do!
---
Not a problem, cheers.
---
hahaha this made me LOL.
---
Some people play on low because not everyone has a nice graphics card and because higher performance. This is terrible
---
Outsider here, can someone eli5?
---
Yeah we don’t, be cool if they added it in future the way day z has it
---
I mean if they are cocky then you just spelled out the definition of cocky.... Thats like me saying "all rude survivor mains are mean", like it's redundant.
---
It's more you wrote out that every survivor main *is* cocky.
---
Its there.
---
No I missed that I will have to go back through the Vods and see it.
---
Does it have to be break-heal-break-heal, or can I break 2 totems at the beginning of the match then heal twice later on?
---
I've yet to be able to get into a match as the demogorgon. It's been like 5 or 6 lobbies now. If i could guess it'd be some problem with one or more of the new perks, so I just keep changing things in the hopes that I can actually play. It just sucks out of 700k points I only got one hawkins offering that I used right away before knowing it would consistently crash.
---
What's with her lips
---
There was a post by someone an hour ago about it needing nerfing.
---
true, I love watching gibs and iosefka, especially if they play together.
---
The Engine has nothing to do with a Skin witch is getting "changed" in an animation. Lmao
---
i run bbq, nurse's, bitter murmur, and iron maiden so i know where them survivors at
---
You can't see them all at all. You can't move your camera during the teleport, your vision is locked at the point you are tp-ing too. 
---
You only see the people around the spot you are teleporting to.
---
Get nom'd
---
How do you access the PTB?
---
the demigorgon model looks so weird to me its like he is missing some textures or something?
---
PTBs tend to last roughly a week or so, with the update going live 2 weeks after the PTB started.
---
So Chapter 13 *should* release on the 17th.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/gibsandpieces/clip/AlluringMiniatureShallotPermaSmug?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time
---
Arousing.
---
Weird because I figured Freddy of all things didn’t need a buff. Wraith, The Pig and possibly Ghostface would be better candidates since they are countered way harder with aura perks than Fred would be.
---
How are they going to add Jason then?  
---
How are they going to make him different from the Trapper?
---
I mean your the advocate pro-Jason so enlighten me?
---
Captions is tough, huh...
---
Otzdarva, FunGoose, PainRelievers and Tru3 are my go-to people.
---
Lol what a dotard you are. You find a totem at the start. Everyone passes by a totem at some point. Voila, next time you need to heal you use a locker. You just saved yourself the hassle of having to self-care and hold m1 for 32-40 seconds, or run around looking for someone to heal you.
---
Pretty much everyone has said its going to be meta. Its the most talked about new perk. Everyone is talking about how its their fav new perk in game. The devs themselves said they had the most feedback about this perk.
---
Why? Because its a really strong perk. Stop trying to downplay it just because your noob ass is terrified it might get nerfed.
---
I want there to be a killer that says "Reeeeeeeed Robin!" And the survivors all have to reply with "Yum!"
---
Why does it look like dbd tried to make the gta meg and fucked up?
---
Why is the 2018 mask always only under the Miramax trademark then?
---
Hag blushes in the distance.
---
No, it’s not the hitboxes, it’s latency issues. It counts one hatchet impact as two due to connection issues.
---
They probably do, it just really doesn't sound practical
---
I really should've done the same but the cut off date is almost a week before PTB actually releases. We don't even have a lot of time to save up on BP.
---
Sounds like an acceptable solution.
---
Sad :'(
---
Agreed. It's like most of those cringey game animation shorts, just really unfunny.
---
I love how analytical he is with the game.
---
Franklin got a perk.
---
Except those extra perks only appear after lvl 40, iirc.
---
There’s a quit match button in many games that will still punish you for leaving the match. It’s there for your convenience in the rare moments you actually need to leave the match for whatever reason (IRL stuff happening, killer is holding match hostage, etc), not for you to abuse because you’re losing.
---
Even now leaving the game early to avoid a loss is a reportable offense.

Purchase them for the bloodpoints. Thats all I did. Same thing happened to me. But I had bought them way before them being in the shrine (like 4 months ago) and already had them leveled up to where I wanted them. So I just spent the 2000 IS for the 150k BP. Shards are pretty easy to come by anyway. But it does suck. I kept hoping for bbq or ruin to pop up while I was leveling them up so I didnt have to worry about it, and a week or two after me getting them leveled up theyre in the shrine lol
---
vs the Thad "Whatever the hell Ghostface is doing"
---
slorp
---
Wait are you implying autodidact was game breaking? Regardless my point was to argue how it's always killers getting nerfed and survivors get everything when that's not really the case. Also safe unhooks literally have nothing to do with either the 2 perks I mentioned nor any of the new perks so idk why you brought them up.
---
Yea better stop playing mostly killer and go back to survivor I guess, I get labeled survivor main enough here so might as well.
---
But you cleanse a totem for your heal? And there’s limited totems.It does not need nerfed...
---
no u

Just tried perk-less and add-on-less, still got a crash so if you're having this problem too you're probably just boned until there's a new hotfix or something.

Demogorgon's real power is that hardcore nodding he can do
---
Oink
---
Counter BBQ and Chilli by staying close to the killer all game.
---
They changed that a while ago, but it might have bugged back at any time. I don't use flashlights much.
---
Sort of, they both have good map presence with teleporting. 
---
They will both have insane hook/basement pressure if they use their teleports. The demogorgon has to be more selective.
---
Hags teleport *is* her chase power, demo is map pressure + separate chase power..
---
Not if you do it the efficient way.
---
Although what I really like about the mori is how midway through you can see the survivor go limp which I think is a nice touch
---
SAVE THE TURTLES

Bloody Ash is the only true Ash. so Bike Kate it is. :3

Sorry, buddy. Someone beat you to it already. Still a good job though.

Sorry to be a meanie awhile ago someone got a perfect game with the demogorgon
---
You could counter DS by disconnecting when seeing a obsession sign.
---
If you never hit any great skill checks then tapping might be superior (not 100% sure). But its way better to practice it and get better than waste your time tapping.
---
Cool
---
Look it's very simple, Killers cash in on faults made by Survivors, that is all this game is. If you don't fuck up you can always get away...
---
Killers aren't that strong as BHVR promises with their 1 strong Killer VS. a team of 4 survivors. There isn't even a team of survivors anymore the only way we see 2 of you guys at one place is becasue your going to fuck up get your teammate of a hook and if we see that you're the idiot for getting him of... but no then it's the trashy killer tunneling and hook camping... it's never the dumbass survivor that wanted altruism points over the safety of his teammate! Because no one likes blaming themselves!
---
These days hook camping with insidious is the easiest BP grab a killer can go for, because you can put your money on the fact that there will be a Survivor coming not even 10s. after Hookey McShouldermeat is swinging in the wind!
---
REEEEE
---
A nodding demogorgon is now the cutest killer
---
Ah damn looks like I'm not the first, but ay it was my first ever game with him so that must give me some street cred lmao
---
Jesus how old are you
---
I don’t know what’s worse dying over and over again on hooks or dying over and over again to high rank players in gta 5
---
The lifespan of the game does.
---
The unhooker
---
Is it any different than hearing a chainsaw, or screeching from some of the more phantasmal killers? It seems more out of character to remove it rather than keep it.
---
Devs spoke about this before they straight said that they could add gore but if they did the game would be banned in certain countries so they'er not going to.
---
Samination's parodies though..."Here comes The Trapper"
---
Bugged. Took me 10 minutes.
---
Do not chase too long. I see more hags than I like who commit to the chase far too long.
---
No fucking way, thanks bro.
---
It also works with devour hope
---
possible? yes.
---
I'd still think it's normal tho
---
Counter Iron Will by not hitting survivors
---
Ehm I guess so, I just played a round with the demodog and I waited in Q for about 2 minutes
---
BHVR always has great reasoning.
---
You trolling&gt;?
---
I really like Farmer John and Aaron Plays
---
don’t you dare put that on my sweet Steve Harrington
---
I’m actually a low rank survivor and I genrush people with ruin. Completely fucks the killer if you power through it.
---
iirc You can't show video game decapitations in some countries.
---
I think its good the way it is, they have to make it sorta kinda suitable for everyone haha I think the cracking sounds when it gets your face make up for it
---
Ash did it first. **But Ace wore it better.**
---
I have to wait like 5 minutes.
---
You have made my boy look great, wonderful job!
---
Trap every hooked survior.
---
Pay attention to survivor routes, trap them.
---
Traps will screw with survivor cameras, place them to the left and right of windows and entrances.
---
Watch Space Coconut guides on YouTube
---
Remember that you can wait to teleport, about 6 seconds. Use this to mindgame survivors in a chase.
---
Never chase, unless 1) they are running toward traps, 2) you can get a hit in 10 seconds
---
Counter the entity by uninstalling the game
---
It is actually a huge buff for Freddy and he already was 4th best killer in a game. Now he's gonna almost like spirit.
---
I feel the portals are personally weak as you need to go over then stand on it then teleport(I think I'm correct). But yea the lunge is kinda weird because its whole attack range is big as the screen (from what I seen) and it gives alot of distance. I'm still processing my thoughts on it but from what I've seen the demogorgons lunge needs some sorta downside kinda like the cooldown you suggested or a big ol indicator so survivors atleast know or just shrink the attack range a little bit (not too much).
---
I don't watch them anymore. I was just giving my opinion in a discussion. In fact, it's pretty obvious from my post that I don't really enjoy the videos so why would I watch them?
---
Because that guy doesnt know what different region clients are, every game that needs to censor does it, games like WoW make entirely new models for it.
---
Not a tip but if u want a big laugh put ten traps in a small area and watch a survivor pee their pants when they walk into it and get jump scared by ten hags. Did it only once, the victim was an injured Dwight, never laughed so hard in this game before
---
the Baldo strikes again!

Did you really just-

Her face looks the same so its very well done

Are you ok?

DO YOU KNOW IF YOU KEEP THE BLOODPOINTS YOU EARN ON THE PTB? SORRY FOR THE NOOB QUESTION--IVE NEVER PLAYED PTB BEFORE

AAAAAAA

Indeed my friend
---
Counter DS by never hooking anyone.
---
It's there but the screens are static, they don't show anything.
---
I mean, compared to Wraith's, it's absolutely insane.
---
U gotta get gud and actually not die in 20 seconds so your team can cifer then the hunter won’t have time to camp or else all of them will be popped
---
Dang that a big lab
---
I expected the head to be more fucked up (wish it was a decapitation though). It feels like a slurp, i "don't believe" the survivor dies to that.
---
You can counter Devour Hope by killing yourself on the hook
---
You are really asking for nerfs? lame.
---
Yeah but wraith, trapper and billy released more than 3 years ago, makes sense that their mori are meh.
---
My guess is either next weeks wednesday or friday
---
I don't have those perks sadly however thanks for the YouTuber ecommendation!
---
If they can’t do decapitations they should make the face more bloody
---
I get shit sometimes from people who don't care for my opinion of him, and they're usually like, "you just don't like him because you're a survivor main and don't watch his streams!" (I main killer but they can't handle any differences of opinion) but the stream thing is kind of right. I watch a small handful of his YouTube uploads every week but I barely watch his stream, so on Sunday I decided to do that and it was even worse than what's in his YouTube videos.
---
He played this match as Wraith and before it started began making excuses in the instance he lost because it was an intentionally bad build, but he had to remind his viewers over and over and over of it. Like, dude, everyone gets it. You're playing a subpar build that doesn't work well. Get over it (I've also noticed that he can be rude to viewers over the builds they ask him to do. No other streamer does that).
---
But anyway, he ended up winning because someone disconnected early on and it was one of the new Badham maps and only one loop the survivors were able to get to was safe. The rest of them were some of the most unsafe loops I have ever seen.
---
And he was just overjoyed about how awful the loops were.
---
Then later on he played a match in Lery's where there were two safe loops in the while map and he complained about it.
---
It really bugs me how he does shit like that - hypocritically celebrates big dead zones while crying about a very small number of safe loops while acting like some unbiased logical genius.
---
I watched him a lot when I first started playing, but he's very anti-fun and has a toxic attitude despite being a more-or-less fair player in game.
---
The people that live there?
---
Right? I don’t want it on the phone if I got it a console it looks like they took dbd and threw it in the microwave for a minute rather just play identity v on the phone
---
Thank you !
---
+1 for more gore pack. They make more money, we get the content we want and the regions that don't like it can block it. It's a win/win.
---
&gt;from what I've seen the demogorgons lunge needs some sorta downside, kinda like the cooldown you suggested or a big ol indicator so survivors atleast know or just shrink the attack range a little bit (not too much).
---
Yeah, as it is right now it's Pig's dash but superior in every way that matters. Has shorter cooldown, shorter miss recovery, shorter charge time, no penalty for canceling, much faster.
---
&gt;I feel the portals are personally weak as you need to go over then stand on it then teleport(I think I'm correct)
---
You are correct! The way I've been doing this is setting up one or two teleports at key locations, and then holding the remaining 4 for future use. Basically whenever I hooked someone I'd plop down the portal and from there I'd tp to a portal I set up around one of the generators.
---
Keep an eye out on the weekly shrine of secrets, they might pop out eventually!
---
And no problem &lt;3
---
I feel the exact same way. Something about the comedic timing/ delivery just doesn't click with me. It's super cool to have an animated series for a game though
---
think issue with freddy rework, they did him first then turn on dedicated servers but everyone had their fill and went back to live, so they switch the formula.

IN FOUR FUCKING DAYS OF PLAYING KILLER I HAVE NOT HAD A MATCH WITH SOMEONE ABOVE RANK FUCKING 12 MOTHERFUCKING MATCHMAKING!
---
Then how would you know Meg is sport.
---
Hopefully i looked in the shrine today hoping for haunted grounds to do a cheeky build
---
Tip: play spirit
---
It's delayed, maybe cancelled
---
I am begging. Begging to differ. I don’t even understand what you’re trying to say here.
---
Haunted Grounds is also pretty useful on her, especially since she can get some cheeky hits off lol
---
So youre saying spirit is in the same tier as freddy and huntress who are all loopable killers? Its a known fact that spirit and nurse are the best killers in the game, even if nurse is a little better than her.
---
Nah, it would be too gore intensive and would risk their M rating.  They have pretty strict rules they follow to avoid getting put in an A rating.
---
First of All. It was the 5th-9th and second that never was a Real anouncement
---
Yeah, it's a good meme but the nobody thing is so damn old.
---
The counter is haunted grounds and not running sloppy. It's a good perk for sure!
---
Conversely if you play plague then it's a dead perk lol
---
First of All. It was the 5th-9th and second that never was a Official anouncement
---
It's a pretty brutal neck snap I feel it works well and the animation is great
---
True true, probably why we also can’t see the survivors top pallet get pushed into their skull when they die to a rbt.
---
NO
---
Idk, does he eat peoples heads on the show?
---
Which countries?
---
campers &gt; mk ll
---
Good to know I'm correct about the portal and you needing to stand over also that's interesting way to use the portals but I still feel they're week because well what if you get into a Chase you can't just teleport to the hook you either need to find a portal to get back there or just walk.    For the lunge there really isn't anything to say more but it needs to be tweaked so it isn't just demogorgons only using the lunge in chases because of how good it is.
---
I was making a joke, but you continue to beg I guess

they didn't say but likely china maybe Australia idk where else
---
YO IM FINNA BE A STEVE MAIN
---
Same goes for the fingers, but look at the. Lost. He doesn’t give two shits about models. He cuts for whatever limb he wants.
---
Sounds like a punishment for most killer players and a reward for dicing survivors. The killer is then forced to deal with a more limited selection of viable killers and playing against survivors and swf beyond their rank.
---
Récord the gameplay pls

Claw Daddy, Nooooooooooooooo!

I could say the same for hooks, they should leave holes.

Probably delayed as the PTB came out later then expected maybe around the 10-16th?

Alright everyone, a new update came out about the patch, and sadly, the Stranger Things chapter is now no longer happening thanks to THIS comment.
---
must have bit them getting stabbed i guess
---
LMAO sure bud. Go ahead and DC in the ptb whete everyone brings moris to see it.
---
Lockers OP please remove
---
That's actually a great example, because folks had mentioned that when the Pig was released and one of the Livestreams around that time they went into detail why. Unfortunately I do not have a link. I personally would love a little boost to the gore but I get it.
---
1. You don't chase with hag. If you see survivor is good at looping, leave him and go trap. If he's a bit weaker, you can run him down.
---
2. Trap all the abusable places, and bring people into them.
---
3. Run monitor and abuse, hag is small and you can sneak up on fuckers real good.
---
4. One trap at the hook, not 7.
---
5. Learn mind gaming pallets. Hag is small and is hard to see, abuse it to the max.
---
6. It will be the most hated tip, but if you have someone in a basement, he's dead. Soft camp the basement. It's an easy win for hag, if you only want to win.
---
7. Have few randoms in a middle of nowhere, where survivors feel safe and think they can sprint.
---
8. Always have one trap in a killer shack.
---
Honestly, I don’t watch stranger things but it’s a discussion. I personally believe it would be a pretty good addition considering the fact that Netflix let Bhvr do some things that weren’t really on the show.
---
Oroboro is hilarous
---
I'm dying
---
Yeah I’d scream if I’ve been shocked too.
---
she barely deserves to even have one
---
Restarting fixed. Thanks for the thumbs down! Also thanks for the suggestion!
---
*Noob3*
---
I usually find players that do this are the same players that have 3k hours and don’t need or want bloodpoints or ranks. So the traditional punishments for such cheap plays have no affect on them.
---
I mean...  it’s not like they’re losing bloodpoints or anything.
---
👋🏻
---
You're in for a rude awakening if you think the servers will be implemented smoothly or relatively on time, or if you think it'll *help* with the getting hit through windows issue.
---
I've never seen a DL survivor dc, which is nice. I normally go immersed when it's me, then when the killer can't find me killer they tunnel someone off their 2nd hook hoping to get d-striked, which is the smart play tbh.
---
I'm glad they're changing it, I hated it as survivor and felt guilty running it as killer.
---
That's how I recall it looking when I play on low in the live build.
---
Hell, nurse is SLOWER than survivors.
---
Her running noises need to be lowered definitely
---
Yeah I don’t understand why people like his videos. The animation is okay but the comedy is shit. Literally. Fart jokes.
---
You forget about some brutal aspects like the Mori’s. For example, the Hag rips the survivor’s kidney out of their body and proceeds to eat it as the life fades from their eyes. The Clown crushes a survivor’s skull and cuts off one of their fingers. There’s also partial nudity, like how the Hag has a tit exposed or how the Spirit has nothing but bandages to cover her body. And if that wasn’t enough, the killers’ designs and backstories are pretty brutal. Some are mutilated to the point that they should, or might as well be, dead.
---
This is true.
---
@TF2Captain [came up with a great suggestion that they add a gorepack as a DLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/czmnrj/i_managed_to_mori_steve_on_my_first_game_as_the/eyzn1ir/?context=3&amp;st=k05mz4pe&amp;sh=b8b925af). I whole heartily agree. It solves all issues.
---
Thanks im screenshotting this
---
I don't see how this is a spoiler, there's plenty of stranger things stuff on the sub and it's all public as of now, you made a great meme, good job
---
They’ve added it to Freddy apparently
---
Oh, definitely Australia. Actually, I’m surprised it’s not already banned in Australia considering the violent nature of the game.
---
If i get a job before it comes out ill buy it. For now im getting biker kate. Im a sucka for leather

That's why PS4 gay

Yeah, i bet its getting... turned on...

Fuck yeah im into biker chicks

90s jake
---
Kinda sad the whole head didn't get ripped off, but I suppose with all the unique cosmetics, it'd require soooooo much werk
---
It happens on every platform. It doesnt happen all the time so take a break, shake it off and move on.
---
😭 git gud?
---
That's awesome. It would be cool to see the survivors doing different things/poses down the road . Like Kate playing her guitar or even something goofy like Dwight with a pizza box on his lap. Just random little things that could happen when you go to the title screen.
---
I recommend the DBD discord. People there aren't perfect but they rarely will DC or suicide or do totally stupid shit.
---
Clown. Cuts off finger. 
---
Hag. Literally eats insides. 
---
Demogorgan. Just sucks on your face a little.
---
You should always have all ten of your traps out, if you’re not in a chase and you have traps you need to place, place them. You’ll thank yourself later. 
---
 The other tip I have is you can fake putting a trap down in certain areas if you know a survivor is watching you, this would be good in situations where you want to save a trap and just want to pressure a survivor to crouch walk or go a certain direction i.e fake put a trap in a loop to get a survivor to abandon it, if SWF pretend to lay a trap under a hook or gen to make them more hesitant to run over there
---
It happens sometimes, also considering you're on console turn your messaging you friends only and those idiots can't harass you.
---
You were already basically effected by Oblivious before it was even a thing, how is this a buff?
---
This actually happened to me last game lol
---
Ok but does it make you scream everytime you "cleanse" this thing?
---
It's a fairly short stealth duration.
---
Damn that fucker is big. Rip Myers being the tallest
---
I'm a console pleb... That why I didn't know.
---
So glad they finally gave us a shirtless character. Partially-shirtless doesn’t count, HAG. Same goes for you, SPIRIT! And trapper. And Wraith. And... oh, wow. There are quite a few shirtless killers.
---
Just let the other survivors die so you can look for the hatch.  
---
Took me a minute to figure it out.
---
I hope you like it everyone!
---
I just know that some people like to not know what the mori looks like
---
/r/youngpeoplereddit
---
Normally a killer downs a survivor and hooks them. The hook gives the survivor a little more control over whether they stay in the game or not. You can try to pop off the hook yourself or struggle/give up to stay in the game or kill yourself and move on. 
---
Slugging is when you down a survivor and leave them crawling on the ground. Normally survivors need other survivors to pick them up to recover from the dying state. Some killers like to troll survivors by slugging the entire team so everyone is crawling on the ground and slowly bleeding out. It takes like five minutes to bleed out and you either have to sit there doing nothing until you die or dc and lose all bps for the game.
---
Basically this killer is forgoing more bloodpoints and rising in the ranks just to annoy other players and waste their time. There really isn’t any reason to leave all four on the ground for the entire bleed out duration if you knocked down all four you may as well start putting them on hooks for a better score and to end the game faster.
---
I like when Ultra Rare add-ons fundamentally change the way the power is used. These are okay, better than the other add-ons, but I don’t see them being fun to use compared to other add-ons than things like Tombstone, Iridescent Head, Redheads Pinkyfinger, or the Hag’s add-ons.
---
Still looks fun tho
---
Rest in peace billy too
---
What is DayZ like on PS4?   I keep holding it off as people keep saying bad things.
---
Not sure I bought the full outfit for Kate when it first came out since I was a hard Kate main then.
---
Okay
---
That’s what people said about New Freddy, yet here we are.
---
Steve is the real Nancy
---
It's been the same for me all day, it's the only game affected though
---
Big brain play
---
Ah, yes. I, too, look like a buttplug monster when I throw up at night.
---
Thanks, filled it out.
---
Slugging from a killer perspective is super hard. You lack a lot of control and it's hard to predict where survivors will be. Also certain perks like undying or the Adam healing perk, or instaheal medkits, can make your life a nightmare.
---
The clown stomping on a survivors head wasn’t anything brutal. It would be if there head got squashed or at least add some gruesome sound effects to it.
---
I haven't tried or seen much of the PTB yet, so could someone fill me in on something? Is the audio cue directional, or do you hear it all the same at all ranges?  
---
Because I'm all for hearing it at all ranges, as long as it's directional. It'd be nice to have a rough idea of how far away it is, sort of like Billy's chainsaw. And Billy's crippled inspiration's chainsaw.
---
Some people say that this Jake is lieing on the ground to this day
---
The lights always flicker when there's a generator inside.
---
Why you bully me
---
It's not a buff. You couldn't hear his terror radius while sleeping anyway. You still hear his lullaby.
---
Hah. If I domt hit you until endgame you'll waste all the totems. Ez counter
---
Its good that you cant use it whenever. Hag cant do it either unless her traps are triggered, and thats her entire playstyle.
---
I hope you feel better after that long ass vent
---
If its not then im 178 cells short :(
---
&gt;His personal perks, (...), enable him to benefit from helping his allies and playing selflessly.
---
Aaaanndd a ttv playing like this
---
Y'all realize that the stun on pallets isn't instant. There's a very small delay when you start dropping the pallet and the stun hitbox kicking in. Good killers who know the timing use that to get both the pallet and the hit in one go. Unless you're talking about being stuck in the drop animation cause of lag then yeah screw that bullshit.
---
He always keeps it at a level that really new players can understand, with context.

I imagine he has a lot of new players in his chat asking questions.

Ban evading on reddit is easier than breathing.
---
Please tell me how so that I can because when I tried to paste it to reddit all the emojis became cameras
---
I believe it has something to do with him teleporting to generators and the demogorgon teleporting across the map.
---
I was so stoked for this at first, but I know I’m gonna drop hella money on Stranger Thing and never play anyone but Scoops Ahoy Steve ever again.
---
In the show, all Demogorgon kills are done off screen.
---
Fucking swf
---
It was! I just wanted to clarify that it wasnt "every COD since the beginning of time" lol, especially because I thought they were still using P2P a couple years after they made the switch. Made me feel pretty smart after learning that...

FUCK THE STUPID FUCKING HUNTRESS CAMPING THE GENS LIKE A GODDAMN COWARD AND FUCK MY STUPID FUCKING TEAMMATES FOR NOT DOING ANY GEN REPAIR AT THE LAST GODDAMN GEN,LEAVING TO ME AND LEADING TO ME GETTING TUNNELED THE ENTIRE TIME
---
Haven’t played in a while, what is new Freddy?
---
Do that and then delete the emojis
---
Why not both?
---
I mean i think it looks like a pretty standard lunge at first; he was right on your butt as you turned the corner. But that was some solid ass looping after the unhook, well done op
---
You can also counter by instantly unhooking so you and the killer can farm
---
Do it here with default settings

He's a BIG boi and I love him
---
Yeah I was just coming off of OverWatch and was tilted as hell. He got me and that’s all there was to it, I appreciate the compliment too
---
A werewolf. Since we have non-humanoid killers now.
---
Exactly its the 4th, and was the ST DLC PTB opened up at exactly 11am EST today?  Yes, yes it was.  Just the devs PTB notes they released last week said it would be.  Reading is knowledge and knowledge is power.  Read more and stop being a fucking meme idiot.
---
Aaaand I’m not actually a ttv it’s just in my reddit name big boi
---
Yes, it's normal. PTB uses a save from several days ago (29th?)
---
Of the abyss is likely placing portal cooldown.
---
The reason it took so long was because they literally failed certification. Sony has a maximum time spent, and BHVR’s patch almost exceeded it 2X
---
No no i got your point. Just wanted to make a joke out of it.
---
Steve's not on the bench anymore!
---
The lunge is 100% getting nerfed m9, it needs a cooldown for how far it goes with little charge time
---
Beyond that its pretty k
---
Must be playing them wrong
---
200IQ logic
---
Painreliever and Otzdarva are pretty great, Noob3 has some pretty fun streams (but his internet trash so he can't really do that anymore)
---
I got accused of cheating because my friend and I powered through ruin because “nobody can hit great skill checks”
---
You can't report tunneling even if you wanted to...
---
[Nope lol](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/84219/)
---
Was referring just to the party keeping system part
---
When did they change that? Lmao it’s always public test build, but I’m happy that in this instance i look like a freakin idiot
---
Yeah expect Bill to rise exponentially
---
What is causing the portal sealing speed increase?
---
I'm almost there. I honestly think because console players rarely ever see a good Nurse they're far less likely to DC against a good one. been playing Nurse on console ever since I got the game back when it was free on PS Plus, and I'm pretty sure atleast 2000 hours of my total 4000 hour play time has been dumped into her, most of my games are 4Ks but they're always close games.
---
&gt;the difference for the sound indicator is that all the examples you mention is the killer can guide the attack, Demo cannot.
---
It/He can guide it just as well as Huntress does + he doesn't get a slowdown if he decides to cancel it.
---
&gt;Besides, i've already watching multiple streamers dodging it or dead harding through it so I don't think it's very powerful.
---
I never said it's impossible to avoid, I said that it doesn't give much feedback and most of the time you just have to guess whether or not he/it is actually using its power, which isn't ideal.

Now to submit this to my teacher...

Well rip your hope because lights flicker in houses when theres a gen that hasn’t been completed

Imagine preemptively shitting on people for something that will never happen.

He can be strong, but still has plenty of counterplay
---
The thing that’s really holding him back imo are his addons
---
I don't recall specifics but still bad planning. I overall brought it up as a joke though
---
I too would like to hear of this new gamemode...
---
Bricky??
---
I thought player test build sounded really wrong too but for some reason that's what is now haha
---
If they do that, maybe the killer will never get the red stain back after the mori, remember its bhvr
---
Just stating it.
---
You don’t plan to fail certification...
---
I like to imagine that he shakes the survivor's head so violently that their neck shatters.
---
ah HA!
---
How are you not banned yet
---
i thought you were talking about what some people call a "counter" which is fake vaulting a window lol
---
Just like Meg's ginger hair. It's always nice to see that my hair survives on the hook when i get sacrificed as her. Not a new bug lol
---
I had people say the pounce was scary as well. I’m sure sneaking up on people after a teleport was too.
---
When is the next double blood points weekend?
---
It'll also stop killers with potato computers which can't fully host the game making it unfun for everyone by periodically freezing.
---
Yes, it will dissapear and you will be able to place another one.
---
Am I misunderstood the effect? Will Freddy still have his song playing while we are in dream world?
---
? what a shit reply lmao no points made just a salty spirit main
---
The Temple is Purgation is so impossibly bad lol.
---
You dick. Take the upvote.
---
Theres no escape from being body blocked into a corner. You have to DC in that situation. If killers know that they can get others banned then more killers will start doing it.
---
A dad joke involving stranger things.....have an up vote
---
in what way does me pointing out looking at the sky apparently being BM make me seem like a casual? no logic
---
Plan and prepare are different. I don't plan on having a tree fall on my house but I have insurance.
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
Unbreakable would be the perfect perk for now.
---
r/dadjokes
---
But huntress can also hit over objects. As far as pounce attack....just look behind you to tell when he's going to use it?
---
Sorry, must call the r/PunPatrol
---
Exactly. It’s no different than hearing bubba or billy’s chainsaw across the map
---
no, if something is fundamentally busted it needs to be changed. the weaker killers just need to be buffed too.
---
HOLY FUCK WHY DOES EVERY SURVIVOR RUN AFTER UNHOOK, LISTEN CLAUDETTE THE KILLER IS IN A CHASE WITH JAKE CMON. ALSO WHY DO MY SHITTY TEAMMATES HAVE TO DIE WHEN THERE IS NO GENS DONE.
---
Actually no, what you just gave as an example is preparedness. You got your own example wrong. Planning is what you expect to happen. Being prepared is being ready for what could happen. Again, my point still stands, and you’re still wrong.
---
Record it. 
---
Report them.
---
They get banned.
---
Move on. 
---
Don't DC.
---
[Damn it](https://imgur.com/gallery/xvPR8CG)
---
They changed it to Cruel Limits, for whatever reason.
---
well obviously it's not always gonna be fun vs swf because you may vs a rarely very coordinated team, a bunch of people just having fun or a group of toxic babies that want to ruin your day. i wasn't being serious or realistic, hence it was a joke.
---
sorry if it was misleading.
---
Its kinda weird thinking about having to buy animations for the game on top of the game and other DLCs/Skins though... It would be pathetic actually..
---
is it the same for pc?
---
I have a PC but play on Xbox, so technically you’re wrong :)
---
So how do you recreate this
---
“Put a hex on it!”
---
I play on console. Therefore, I could not have played the PTB.

Not mandatory and think of it as a donation for the company.

I was greedy, i wanted him to open the door then down him and let the entity finish him, he dead harded and escaped...
---
I’m mildly upset I didn’t hear the iconic death oof followed by his flashlights icon laying next to him.
---
I mean, apart from this post being against the rules, you’re playing a P2 Spirit, with 3 teachable perks and you still got 3 of them and did well so maybe you shouldn’t be at yellow ranks killing all the noobs?
---
Unlock the monado's power.
---
Rank reset bro
---
Clearly the one doing the fucking should pay.
---
#raisedright
---
For context, my friends and I were testing the new stuff in a custom game and by accident, I switched to killer while it was starting and we spawned as two headless Demogorgons.
---
Think that's been done
---
I personally would put those 2 the other way around ngl
---
Wow such good input that really shows your iq and is really appreciated by everyone on this subreddit... if you're gonna be a cunt just log off
---
It was rank reset over 3 weeks ago. And if rank reset put you to 13 that means you were originally in purple ranks anyway.
---
Consider spine chill *was the counter* to stealth characters I find this concerning. Does premonition still work?
---
I mean I main Pig and it'll be super helpful for me but it's kinda BS if spine chill is actually ruined now
---
PTB has been 2 weeks long most of the time.
---
I'd say the 17th or 18th
---
In fact i was rank 10
---
I enjoy Monto and Puppers stuff. Noob3 can do some funny videos. 
---
My favourite is Geef by a mile, he is really chill and very funny but best of all he tries his hardest to interact with everyone in his chat and he has clearly made some good friends who he cares for as he always make sure to let them know they can talk to him if they are having issues. He is just a really cool guy who loves him some chickens.
---
Got purgation for me. I'm pretty sure you can get the offering rn but the map isn't actually playable. Probably a mistake on the devs part
---
Didn't they make it so you have to be like 32 meters away from the hook for MYC to activate? I may be on glue though.
---
I thought the Demogorgon's were from the upside-down not the inside-out.
---
Little over edited and isnt consistent in what stuff you're using but just ease off a little on the editing and you're fine
---
With a capital S, apparently
---
Do you really think solo players can coordinate totem cleansing? Or tell people how much they’ve cleansed?
---
Heck, I doubt they can even count.
---
Outplayed
---
Imo if you boast about bringing in a Mori just because it says TTV. You're an asshole.
---
Its not breaking any rules, not abuse of qla mechanic, it's just discriminatory and immature.
---
It's like a shark and a crocodile with Slenderman's body
---
I'm giving my ptb feedback and first impressions. I could say that everything is fine and dandy and not to change anything, but then I wouldn't be really giving my honest feedback, would I?
---
In my opinion he could use some small adjustments to make him better to face.
---
Spirit isn’t fundamentally busted, there are ways to play around a killer other than looping around a pallet, if you never figure that out of course you’ll struggle against them.
---
While it's a good combo, it feels wasted on Freddy. Get the Blood Warden teachable then do it on someone else
---
that doesn’t make sense, but thank you a lot for the fix
---
Definitely
---
Just wait till Season 4, you will be very suprised
---
How long before ps4?
---
It does, it’s called censorship and many games have that. For example in some games you can turn off blood or other violence.
---
"nobody is complaining about Inner Strength"
---
What? Have I been living in an alternate universe these past two weeks or something?
---
this seems a bit unfair considering that survivors can now get the hatch opened without ever touching a generator.
---
It's good for knowing if they're headed to you or just walking around
---
Is it safe to assume you are a fellow tapp main?
---
Maybe 15-20 secs?
---
It looks so fucking dumb when the head just pops right back out.
---
Of course I am I learned to live with the fact that this game is biased beyond repair, it's not that big a deal... as soon as you acknowledge that ranks mean dick and BP amounts are the real measure of winning or loosing, getting ahead in this game become surprisingly easy.
---
You can be the most toxic piece of shit killer in this game and walk away with about 3x the best survivor's BP amount each game! So, yeah that's why I stay a killer main, I'll see you in game maybe hook camping you, tunneling you and taking all them nice BP's to the Bloodweb, to buy more shit to be a more toxic killer.
---
\- Don't give me that look, the only fun thing about this game is to cause the opposing side aggravation in this game and you know it!
---
It’s a leaked trapper skin don’t worry
---
It's a trade-off for que times. It would be nice if there could be a handicap for matches like this but would just be exploited by the dbags who already take advantage of the poor swf matchmaking.
---
RIP that zombie’s dick.
---
......OH NO
---
CONGRATS FOR GEN RUSHING ME INTO OBLIVION TO THE CONSTANT RED RANK SWF TEAMS WHO I CONSTANTLY GET MATCHED WITH. I'M A RANK 7 KILLER WHO IS ONLY RANK 7 WITH NURSE AND I AM TRYING TO LEARN OTHER KILLERS. I'M AWARE THAT I SUCK WITH EVERYBODY ELSE I'M SUPER GLAD YOU TBAG EVERY CHANCE YOU GET, CLICK YOUR LIGHTS AT ME AND SIT WAITING FOR THE LAST SECOND TO LEAVE THE GATES. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME FOR YOU TO SUCK YOUR OWN DICKS PROUD OF YOURSELVES FOR BEATING A VERY VERY BAD SPIRIT. HANG THAT TROPHY ON THE WALL YOU FUCKING DID IT YOU DBD LEGENDS
---
yeah it's surprisingly big but also really tight it's weird
---
Also holy hell, the model porters [work](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1853904442) [fast](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1853913791) [as hell](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1853919641).
---
It wasnt even swf it was just me going into a random lobby while i wait for my mates but yh i agree with wot u say
---
Ehh I mean I wouldn’t even say what good ole’ Ghostface did here was necessarily toxic. He didn’t tbag or slash at our slugged bodies, just downed us all and pretty much disappeared into the map. True to his name. I think killers should be allowed to do stuff like this, but its just annoying and I feel doesn’t make the game THAT enjoyable on either ends. He only got 11k BP for that match too, so is it really worth?
---
But specifically for Myers I’d probably do the same thing you do, especially if the survivors have been getting too many safe hooks off. Not toxic at all since you don’t leave survivors to bleed out.
---
It's the only DLC that would continue to add value after each passing DLC for more killers= more interesting gruesome effects. Wouldn't be a hard sell for me, that's for sure.
---
i like that it's kinda like a dog shaking around some meat, decapitations don't really do it for me tbh
---
&gt;But huntress can also hit over objects.
---
Huntress has wind up time and much longer punishment if she cancels her ability. With Demo you have a much faster wind up and survivor has way less of a window to react. You can get hits before they even get to a pallet. In terms of windup it's as if we got old tinkerer on Huntress again.
---
&gt;.just look behind you to tell when he's going to use it?
---
Not on tall loops like jungle gyms, shack, etc? You can't see each other, no way to tell what is happening. All you can do is go for a 50/50 guess, something that isn't exactly much fun to go against.
---
&gt;I don't agree they should be hand holded with audio confirmations before each special attack.
---
It's not handholding, it's not having to guess whether or not the attack is actually happening. Imagine if huntress didn't have wind up sounds for her hatchets at loops.
---
It is good to know that but sadly i suck at survivor so i will never see that
---
Even as a killer and seeing the gen auras I couldn't get to them half the time.
---
The devs have gotten better about fixing bugs, but these Huntress bugs have been on the servers since their first test. I didn't pay much attention outside of her, but I'm guessing the issues effecting Plague and Clown were the same way.
---
My concerns come from the fact that at least one of these was a known issue for months that wasn't fixed and that the current state of the dedicated servers is that it is nearly the final state.
---
This was on the live servers.
---
my uncle is Matthieu Cote's man servant so I can bend the rules a bit
---
I get like 1 to 3 every bloodweb. But I get one *bloody party streamer* every 4 bloodwebs.
---
I WAS EIGHT WHOLE AURIC CELLS AWAY FROM GETTING THE FULL BIKER KATE COSMETIC SO NOW I HAVE TO PAY MORE IF I WANT THE LAST PIECE AND I JUST WANT THE BLOOD HUNT ALREADY SO I CAN GET PERKS AND SHIT
---
Indeed. Now we just have to hope BHVR sees this and starts implementing it. Then it will be an even better urban legend because we’ll already have the posts denying it!
---
Oh man
---
Do you hear the Whisper Men?  
---
The Whisper Men are near.  
---
If you hear the Whisper Men,

then turn away your ear.

Do not hear the Whisper men,  
---
whatever else you do.  
---
For once you've heard the Whisper Men,  
---
they'll stop and look at you.
---
huntress oof
---
Have you heard kates ptb hook sound?
---
Whatever the opposite of dummy thicc is, that's Steve. He's concave lol. Otherwise they all look AMAZING!
---
I feel like Trapper is gonna get the "we couldn't license them" type cosmetics.
---
Are you sure you're ok?
---
Seriously seems pretty broken.  Fuck survivors I guess
---
I already do, I use Ace in the Hole first tier
---
Hey, you’ll get there one day!  Just keep practicing! :)
---
Wow thanks for the basic tip everyone knows.
---
&gt; but Tru3 just started insulting him and kept making excuses for everything, unless I missed something I didn't see this David be toxic to deserve some of the things Tru3 said.
---
He does this exact same thing with youtube titles. he one a week or so ago where it was called "you picked the wrong killer to try and bully" and not a single survivor did anything remotely rude
---
&gt; biggest reason being he refuses to do SWF
---
Which is just goofy. I'm not a fan of how SWF players can relay the location of hex totems and it makes some funky shit happen with matchmaking, but he acts like it's the most unfair, game breaking thing of all time.
---
&gt; making a point he deems to be 'logical' and any counter argument is just someone 'creating their own narrative'.
---
&gt; Good guy but it kinda feels like the game is burning him out and his fanbase is pretty hardcore yesmen so anyone saying something different or critical get's drowned out or deemed toxic.
---
A while back he was playing a survivor match against a Plague who did pretty poorly. When the gates were opened she had one person hooked and one slugged in front of the hooked survivor. I said "poor dude. I hate being slug camped. It's obnoxious" and Tru3 and his chat had a literal meltdown over it, saying how I think all survivors deserve to just walk out and how I want killers to lose and how I'm illogical, etc. and this went on for over 10 minutes. I've never faced abuse like that from a streamer and their chat before. It was *insane* and it was mostly led by his mods. I didn't even think the Plague was doing anything wrong. It's obviously the best thing to do if you wanna secure your kills; I was just trying to make a point about fun, but fun isn't really a thing that registers over there. And for several days after that all of his stream titles had something to do with how logical he is lmao
---
And as an aside, I think hooking the slugged survivor could have resulted in a late game snowball, but whatever.
---
It doesnt really decapitate anyone in the series that we see but it does chew on them a lot
---
Horrid eldritch monstrosity from beyond the stars
---
Nice of them to nerf one of the few off-meta perks and reduce perk diversity even more! I’ll be swapping it out for DS I guess.
---
Didn't go too far with the edits because I didn't want anybody making a meme similar to this first lol
---
A killer that makes good use of it , especially kill see RSS with instadown potential like chainsaw bois.. it is a force to be reckoned with
---
New on the community, what is NOED?
---
I would rather call Jason "the slasher"
---
I do do them though.
---
Natalia Dryer lmao
---
Eh. As a doctor main I agree and disagree. On most builds it’s useless but using a sneaky doctor with Enduring and Brutal strength and ruin with M&amp;Abuse can be surprisingly effective. If you’re running unnerving or some shit don’t put it on though or running calm.
---
New Freddy can hit survivors to put them in the dream world. He can teleport to unfinished generators or you can use the temporary clone to mind game people. He now has fake pallets he can place down. His default is the dream snare, which slows sleeping survivors when they move over it. Everyone falls asleep after 60 seconds. Survivors now have an alarm clock they can interact with to wake themselves up. (Similar to Jigsaw boxes.)
---
Then you may bitch.
---
You stupid
---
yup would be nice. I am a R1 nurse main but I don't play frequently anymore. The grind up to ranks were it actually gets challenging takes too much time for me. I just play a couple of matches each week and I usually end up like rank 16 or so. Still I oneshot most groups with 3 or more generators remaining. I shouldn't be up there even if I don't play a lot.
---
The toxicity of survivor vs killer mains is showing. Inner strength isn’t even close to NOED and I’m glad they are putting perks in That force survivors to do totems. It’s like forcing them to do what they should have been doing if they hated NOED so much. I’m newer so I haven’t seen people say use Small Game, but it sounds like something killers would say just to get you to waste a per slot. I’ve played for a month and the totem spots on most maps are super predictable. If small game sucks so much then don’t use it, and pay attention to totems. Iron Maiden can actually be used effectively though. I doubt anybody is going to complain when IM can work well with some builds and could get you a free down on everybody using this hyped perk. 
---
I saw Tru3 complaining that this will ruin slowing the game down which will probably be a little true for red ranks, but for casual players and green ranks I imagine this slowing it down a lot if all the survivors are running around not doing objectives.
---
otz or farmer john :^]
---
Figures this amazing costume is cells only, but Jeff's ugly ass costume that's part of the same collection is purchasable with shards. Fuck these devs

baby survivors, right on time

He was farming
---
Ah yes, the  S U C C
---
Pretty standard build for freddy. I'll take MYC over bamboozle because the snowball potential is pretty great
---
I just find it fun to fuck with people...
---
I literally just replied to a comment saying his power is OP like 15 seconds ago
---
I agree that they should give a noise notification when he's gonna lunge but nothing else.
---
IMAGINE A MR CRABS RUNNING AFTER YOU BAHAHA
---
5 blinks suck though
---
Straight up it's a great perk, not god tier but good enough to make it well worth bringing even at tier one
---
Freddy rework: Prime time bitch!!
---
This is mine that i finally just got yesterday and it works pretty well.
---
T3 BBQ- for BP and auras when hooking
---
T3 Rancor- play with the obsession, locations when gen is repaired and a free mori at the end
---
T3 Tremors- slow down gen repair and see which gens are being worked on
---
T1 Discordance- lasts 8 seconds so you know if 2 or more are on a genny and since it only lasts 8 seconds you get frequent checks to know if they are still on it.
---
Might be switching out tremors for the new mind breaker when its released, because tremors is the only perk in my build with a cooldown amd me no likey cooldowns lol figured mind breaker wouldnt be too shabby. But thats just my build I made based around his genporting.
---
Add ons- I throw on some pallets and a dress or a brush maybe. Just whatever I'm feeling up to atm.
---
Barb mains rise up
---
Never saw why people liked stranger things
---
Holy hell, lagswitch on Xbox? Great now I gotta start worrying about that shit. Be sure to report his ass.
---
The lunge is not that long and it can only go straight. It's fine
---
Obvious bait
---
I still think nodding Billy or Myers is best tbh
---
Nice work.
---
gosh its disturbing how similar this turned out lol.
---
It begins.
---
you know, there are perks that turn it off right? Also killer powers that do the same
---
Making a fresh account just to prove ur some high minded person!
---
That's the dream-team of whoop'in that evil ass
---
Mate. T-Bagging is a common thing to deal with as a killer but it only exists to stir you up. And flashlights are a part of the game, gotta learn to deal with it. Not even an unfair part seeing as there are two perks to deal with them and strategies to deal with them
---
&gt; How about that Enduring was buffed to make the popular Spirit Fury combo even stronger.
---
Okay, hold on, I don't care about the rest of this discussion but this is just nonsense. It also stopped applying to stuns and buffed DS, Head On, etc
---
I feel like survivor mains in the PTB are just being Mori’d every game so killers can see it and content creators can show it off. Must be pretty boring for the survs. But yeah. It is true. There’s no point DC’ing at death anyways. You’ve only got like 3-5 seconds before you’re back in the lobby anyways.
---
It truly is pitiful but we all did yes
---
I'm gonna be real with u chief it's not even the best chest perk
---
BUT!!!
---
The fact that you can get an instaheal is great, but I wouldn't use it outside of a looting build.
---
Also, I didn't realize we were talking about the perk in my first reply. Oops
---
Carl the cashier &gt; Barb
---
Rave party
---
And yet here you are commenting...
---
weird human hand ash
---
Clown cuts off the survivor's finger and sucks on it for his mori.
---
What's wrong with using your power to get the last kill?
---
lol at this discussion below, its literally on the screen.
---
Sounds like he has a lot of new abilities. Where does he rank now among other killers?
---
Literally instant buy
---
Its okay.....so am i
---
Yeah but everyone is like "steve boutta get his finger cut off" does he get his finger cut off in the show or something?
---
Not op for sure, but I do think he could use adjustments.
---
I don't like the trend this subreddit has for being against any criticism regarding new killers. A killer doesn't have to be super op nurse tier broken character to warrant some adjustments.
---
 It was the same situation when Ghostface released on ptb after his fixes and he was pretty buggy in relation to his power. Everybody who mentioned that sometimes the game refuses to reveal him no matter how hard one looks at him got shouted down and downvoted. We still have the same problem with bugs on GF where sometimes you reveal him behind a wall, sometimes you cant reveal him when staring straight at his face months after his release. Characters can have problems that aren't just "being op".
---
Look at Doctor for example. Nobody who's got some pactice in would call him overpowered. He definitely feels outdated/could use buffs. Yet he has some problems, like his ability to hold the game hostage or how his treatment mode interacts with grabs on unhooking survivors.
---
No but actually yes
---
Is this a Fibonacci sequence?
---
yea but it's not as easy to notice the technique they use for the fingers as it would be for the head
---
Most I've heard say top 4.
---
Just ride, my friend!
---
That makes, wish the devs would tweet something if it would be delayed or whatever
---
Could be swf
---
Ah, gotta check him out for myself. Thanks for the info
---
Why cancel when a lot of players would be waiting for it ?
---
May your matches be fun and your sacrifices fulfilling.
---
&gt;Why should I play a game which is supposed to be fun if I only rage about it nearly every time.
---
Pretty much why I haven't played the game in over 6 months. Even though I loved it. Just waiting until they do something about Facecamping after which I'll happily return. But until then, no point wasting my time just to get facecamped because a low rank killer thinks dropping a pallet is toxic...
---
I heard his funeral will be held by Nance "The Nance" Nancington
---
If they have OoO then they probably have a looping build so I mostly just avoid them until they directly get in my way.
---
Yeah, I messed that up. Wish I could edit titles.
---
I use Phobia instead of lullaby
---
Little did we know Steve was the nerd all along
---
Terror radius =/= Shock therapy range
---
While in Treatment mode you gain Static field and it's always active, as long as you stay in TM. While Shock Therapy is doc's "zap".

I think it just needs a slowdown if he cancels it (like huntress when she cancels a throw). That way if you mess up your play you can get punished for it.
---
Relax bro it's test server not live this wasn't even in a real game I did it in a kill your friends lobby... OOF ..
---
Ayy good lookin out, thank you.
---
God I love this community.
---
Nurse is just bad on console I played her with all the builds and add ons and couldn't get consistent pips but when I played legion I was able to get to rank 4 with him.
---
sadly no, although i do like playing him sometimes, i rotate around a bit on survivors
---
SOVIET UNION ANTHEM INTENSIFIES
---
Why is that necessarily bad for the trapper?
---
Some say it looks odd, but she's always had odd cyber cosmetics.
---
&gt;  get labeled survivor main enough here so might as well.
---
I went through your history and you almost only talk about playing survivor. And you have a comment saying:
---
&gt; "Adrenaline isn't free though, you have to collectively complete all the gens for it to activate."
---
But you don't *have* to do jack fucking shit to get Adrenaline
---
Like, you clearly main survivor and that's okay lol
---
From what I've seen, no. Once you place them they stay there till they get destroyed, at which point you can place it again in a new spot.
---
This means new code, during certain circumstances crap like this can happen, just like not being able to heal allies or being stuck in a pallet, remember its bhvr
---
5. - 9. September is double BP iirc, release should be in 2 weeks (maybe, possibly, don't quote me on that)
---
The hands labeled "android hand" :D
---
Did I say anything otherwise? That's why I pointed out thr combo with Spirit Fury, that is objectively better now, am I wrong?
---
Also my point was not of the assumption that MoM was fine, but it still got nerfed. The person I replied to said BHVR always caves to survivors and never nerfs them.
---
We in party city
---
like quentin slowly falling asleep only to quickly wake himself up?
---
I dont get why kate doesn't have her guitar, that'd be awesome
---
No, because I'm arguing they should have been prepared for any delays by planning accordingly. You're failing to grasp that but grasping at straws at the difference of planning vs. preparing. If I ship out a product around holiday season with a will be delivered by date, it is up to me to be prepared for the delays I know are there and plan accordingly. 
---
How do you get prepared? With a plan for what to do. 
---
You tried though
---
How do you want to get better going against noob killers? :P
---
AT LEAST FUCKING ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MULTIPLE TROPHIES/ACHIEVEMENTS ARE BROKEN BHVR. WOUNDED HEALER HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR FUCKING MONTHS, SINCE AT LEAST MAY, AND NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID.
---
One person prob downvoted and then everyone just monkey see monkey dooed
---
Ah!
---
LAST NIGHT I WAS MATCHED WITH RED AND PURPLE RANKED SURVIVORS WHEN IM GREEN RANK WITH SHIT PERKS. THEY BEAT MY ASS, TEABAGGED ME, AND MESSAGED ME GG EZ ON XBOX. THEY RAN BT, DEAD HARD, ADRENALINE, DS WHILE I ONLY HAD STARTING PERKS FOR SPIRIT AND WAS BAD AT SPIRIT WHEN IM TRYING TO GET BETTER. I WAS SO FUCKING MAD AND STILL KINDA AM NOW
---
Can we get cosmetics that aren't fucking purple for once?
---
I can beat rank 10 killers easy but RANK 2 ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I tried facing my friends brother Rank 1 nurse and the only good thing I did in the 2 minute game was get a pallet stun on the nurse
---
My build is PGTW, Ruin, BBQ, Make Your Choice
---
ringa-ding ding baby
---
But why should I get downvoted when it's the true
---
The blood point date was shot down by devs and they said they don't have one planned at the moment
---
Barrowed Time technically shouldn't have ever worked while you are asleep since it's triggered by the Killers Terror Radius. Whether they added Oblivious or not, this change was probably coming anyways.
---
no just steve has very succulent fingers
---
Just clean that shit and let mom sleep
---
&gt; Did I say anything otherwise? That's why I pointed out thr combo with Spirit Fury, that is objectively better now, am I wrong?
---
You were intentionally leaving out the aspect that was nerfed to try and make it look like dev decisions are more killer based than they are. Don't give me this shit. You're not sneaky
---
&gt; Also my point was not of the assumption that MoM was fine, but it still got nerfed. The person I replied to said BHVR always caves to survivors and never nerfs them.
---
X Doubt
---
If you thought Mettle was a legit change then it wouldn't serve your stated purpose to mention it
---
PRETTY SURE NO BUT I'M A CONSOLE PLAYER SO GRAIN OF SALT
---
You know these could be good hints for devs? 😂
---
This sounds like something I need to play
---
I "had" to DC
---
Lol you get mad at me for saying that you are a console pleb, is actually a console pleb.
---
Replace bamboozle by Brutal Strength that way you waste less time breaking safe pallets and kicking gens.
---
Or you could also run surveillance, it also works with Demigorgon perk that make gens regress(when it’s available).
---
I imagine you'd have a different opinion of that now.
---
I think I remember them saying something about the Endgame Collapse being different on this map? Is that the case?
---
Try to get meg leveled up so u can get adrenaline, bill is also a good option, and another good one will be nea, that way u can run a perk build of:
---
Adrenaline
---
Balanced landing
---
Borrowed time
---
Unbreakable
---
And this perk build is really good until u can actually get perks like decisive strike
---
But then Steve would be bald
---
Thanks for the advice! :)
---
there's a thing called reusing code, its the point of methods, you write a piece of code and give it a name, so next time you need that you just write the name
---
PUT A GUN AGAINST HIS HEAD!
---
Can't hide traps well because of a severe lack of grass.
---
And if u don’t like unbreakable( cause it’s very situational) u can also run spine chill instead
---
By DC both you and killer loose BPs, and you also fuck up the team :D there's always a better way :P
---
I like how this is a universal experience
---
No. Nothing from PTB carries over to the live game. They are completely separate.
---
Same thing with Kate's brown hair
---
Being a white knight and claiming that this wasn't funny apparently. Little do they know comedy is subjective
---
Hey cool, I was beep =)   
---
Nice seeing the mori, pretty brutal!
---
I edited in an example of a vendor that offers that service, although I'm sure you can find more at all sorts of price ranges
---
How did he get a killer instinct from it? Haven't been able to play yet...
---
I’m pretty sure the reason for the Mori not decapitating the survivor is due to the way the character models are built. They’d have to create a new model of a headless survivor for every single survivor and I can’t see them doing that
---
Dumbasses
---
Yeah. They can have the perk logo perhaps. I think that would definitely be a step in the right direction. Giving them a different Aura color or color blind setting would also help grow the player base. Right now the current orange color scheme can be very off-putting to people who have certain color blind conditions. Definitely a big oversight from the Developers.
---
I don't think spirit will get undectable. Hopefully.
---
_The killer mains have gone too far._ - Survivor main.
---
Should have been Billy Herrington.
---
5th to the 9th of September. People were saying it's confirmed, I don't have a source though.
---
Yeah I don't get why we have to grind on a test build.
---
Doesn’t matter if you get blinded at pallets if you have a very good headset.
---
Now much to do when picking a survivor,but I got a funny story.
---
Once I was playing Nurse and I down this survivor,as I’m about to pick him up,I hear footsteps behind I turn around and hit That survivor,then the whole team came to try in heal this man.
---
Got 3 injured and they went far,so I go pick up that survivor,then the pallet get dropped on me,she missed and I was like:All your efforts,no gen Progress...wasted.
---
Then I realized I was stuck in the pallet...
---
But they were nice enough and lucky to find a Flashlight and blind me,but I don’t know if the survivor I was carrying DC’ED after/before the flashlight save.
---
I got out and got my 3 kills.
---
ah i feel a bit dumb now
---
You do realize that lunge is shorter than pig's ambush right? There would be no need.
---
Makes sense to the since the perk was designed to counter him at the time. Unfortunately it does ruin certain Killers like Pig or Ghostface but it will save your ass from a jump scare Myers pulling you off of a generator
---
Just deal with it for 2-3 weeks it'll be updated in the ST update
---
Wtf is going on!!! LOLOLOL!
---
&gt;Thank you for the picture, OP, this was the info I was looking most forward to.
---
You are very much welcome. Every PTB I always go straight to KYF to check the level 3 perks and all the add-ons instead of waiting for a content creator to check them. People are usually too hyped to actually care about these boring information. I care.
---
u dont need to hide ur traps, they will walk in anyway because there is no space for move around
---
Yeah it's by no means the best chest perk but I started using it shortly after I spent a few months perkless, and while I never fully intended to start using perks again I felt that Ace in the Hole Tier 1 suited my desires for a perk while still not really having too big an effect on my gameplay
---
Gotta have them bloodpoints lol.
---
More brutal than Legion's Mori
---
I have a portal at the exit gate, if they walk within about 5 meters of it, I get the killer instinct
---
They can totally add an option to disable Gore. I remember that from the first Black Ops game. I also remember it from Left 4 Dead 2. That way certain regions of the world that don't allow Gore can leave bodies intact but slash marks or heads getting ripped off are actually visible if you allow it.
---
I see she's wearing the combat straps.
---
These are neat and really fit the character of Tucker and Dale
---
I remember a game against a pig. My first ds chance was ending when she decided to put me a trap.
---
The second chance was ending and she was going to pick me up but decided to break a pallet nearby instead. I died.
---
It *hurts* bro... :'(
---
Regarding your third point I hope they don't change that, it adds a lot of skill on *both* sides regarding portals. Demo can't just mindlessly place portals and survivors need to be smart enough to know which portals to clear and which to leave
---
The Night of Opulence dress would like a word
---
(I insta-bought this biker set though, Kate is my bae)
---
He’s decently powerful, but not OP. He can gaurd exit gates and multiple people on a hook pretty well, plus his pounce attack, so he’s def gonna be high tier, but not broken OP
---
Who’d plan for their “shipping company” to basically say “yeah, your product doesn’t meet our standards so we’re not delivering it” They’d have to of seen their own mistakes and preemptively redone the patch. The only way to prepare for that would be to know it’s bad, and that’d mean they wouldn’t of made it that way in the first place. They can’t see the future
---
Mate everything in this game is considered bm
---
Pig has to crouch first and charge it up with a warning roar, and it doesnt work with Exposed effects
---
Demo can yeet himself off high ground everywhere and catch up quick in chases by spamming it
---
Inspired by R Lee Ermey's character from the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
He made the shirtless Myers sfm model, we cant ban him
---
Certain European and Asian countries censor Gore and don't allow it. Biggest examples I can think of are Germany China and some Southeast Asian countries. Mainly China though. Decapitations are not allowed to be depicted in Chinese media from what I'm aware of and the game is very popular there.
---
They could totally add a gore slider like Left 4 Dead 2. The game that came out ages ago. Even the original Call of Duty Black Ops allowed you to enable or disable dismemberment and body wounds like bullet holes or slash marks.
---
It's short for: Hex no one escapes death
---
It's considered a cheap perk for bad killers because once all the gens are done the killer can one shot survivors unless they cleanse all the totems beforehand or find the lit totem (when all gens are done a random remaining dull totem becomes the noed hex totem, so in order to get rid of it you have to cleanse all totems before finishing gens or happen to find the totem)
---
TL:DR perk that allows you to one shot if gens are completed
---
Hag is garbage, her traps cant stop basic pallet loops and she has no map pressure if the survivors know where you put them because its obvious where they are put most of the time
---
I uncontrollably laughed loudly in an Uber drive and scared my driver because of this comment, thanks. XD
---
Hag is like this with everything
---
Okay?
---
Have the same face because i cant get to PTB :( And i really want my scoops Ahoy! Steve already.
---
Darkening them prob makes it fine
---
All those years of Urban Evasion really changed her
---
That seems really strong. How do you survive against someone that puts a portal on both switches and four gens? Seems like he could just spam his detection power and guarantee an easy win
---
Pack Tacos, Brother! It’s party time!
---
The whole “me waking up my mom at 3am to _______” is a meme
---
Nice! I’d love some tacos atm
---
Learn to play against him
---
u/UwUtranslator
---
I’m glad he’s getting more cosmetics. Ash is far as we know is the strongest survivor out of the group and is the only one that is not scared of talking. Ash is a true alpha male.
---
That's one of his ultra rare add ons!
---
https://i.redd.it/7za2nsvyjlk31.jpg
---
^ That's a list of all of his add ons. Red moss lets you break pallets with your dash as you would with Billy's chainsaw dash. It also lets you activate your teleport slightly faster.
---
Yes but it’s simpiler to have everything the same rather than certain versions been different
---
Lmao i didnt even notice, was too busy hearing AH AH AH
---
The clown can be pretty fun to play.
---
I just uploaded the clip of me 'tunneling' him
---
I would believe that if they didn't have the Clown cut a finger off or The Hag rip your stomach open and pull your guts out.
---
If they can animate and handle the endgame collapse or the entity killing someone... They can handle Leatherface leaving a slash Mark when he pulls his chainsaw up your back or the demogorgon ripping your head off. Left 4 Dead is a decade old and can handle dismemberment or decapitations. Doesn't need to be Mortal Kombat level of Gore but just some red stuff and a little bone.
---
Ok! What build is good on him?
---
mood
---
It’s pretty buggy, but its godlike compared to standalone release on PC (which was the last time I played it)
---
Literally look at him
---
PLEASE JUST DELETE YAMAOKA ESTATE NOTHING MAKES ME WANT TO QUIT PLAYING MORE THAN GETTING IT TWICE IN A ROW AND HAVING RUIN INSTANTLY CLEANSED
---
There is a difference in this game when folks run good perks, and then you get a 4 man team built with meta perks that just take their victory to verbally abuse the other player
---
Yeah I don’t understand why people aren’t getting it
---
I second that
---
You deserve karma and also deserve to lose it, but I’m a fallout new Vegas fan so I have to give you karma anyway because you basically just stealth killed a Fiend (the joke is that for some reason if you stealth kill specific enemies, you get karma)
---
&gt;I remember seeing a post a while back about a double BP Blood Hunt event going from September 5th-9th. Is that still going to be happening?
---
This has never been officially announced so my guess is no. It could happen and whoever leaked this information will be happy but if it doesn't happen, you shouldn't be expecting to begin with.
---
Still not as bad as Meyers and his tombstone chunk that lets him just straight up kill you the first time you meet.
---
Get the perk called diversion, use it every game
---
Holy Shit! 1.0k upvotes!? MOOOOM! COME QUICK AND LOOK AT THIS!!!!
---
Yeah it seems really situational tbh, it may be worth it if it also blocks pallets
---
So no head?
---
Well shit.
---
Tbh all of the streamers ive seen really rarely get 4 mans with my boy demogorgon
---
Why. It would've been only a mediocre perk anyway.
---
for who?
---
Hag if you don't have ruin
---
yeah i almost always get goofs that play like that. hardly ever do i get survivors that don't cleanse
---
Jeff has terrible posture. Kind of reminds me of the worms from Men In Black. Probably why I haven't played as him. He's also incredibly loud
---
It’s a survivor perk
---
Puppers because he’s cool af and fun to watch
---
Monto for the same reasons as Puppers
---
Otz because he’s cool, fun to watch, and teaches a lot. 
---
And Tru3Talent because he’s super educational. He seemed smug at first, but I’ve realized he just has a resting smug face. He’s actually pretty cool once I gave him a chance.
---
Yes and the devs have released a statement on this.
---
How would one join the DBD discord?     ...I’m asking for a friend... *cough*
---
As far as I know, they didn't outline a specific reason. It's the PTB, things are subject to change, even if their own discretion is the only reason.
---
I actually hope surge does work with other gen breaking perks, and I dont think it would be OP if it works with pop because that's a bit situational
---
God I whish mori's would leave marks on bodies. Bubba's mori does not even leave anything. And he FUCKING puts a chainsaw trough someones chest. Clowns mori is nullified because corpses have their fingers again after the animation.
---
He's joking don't actually do it
---
*Leather squeaking sounds intensify*
---
Yes, never had many problems with the matchmaking but lately I got a lot of killers down to rank 12.
---
Except for today. Today the lowest rank I saw was 5.
---
Ps4 btw
---
I died of laughter when I encountered this. Tried to reproduce it again for the lols but couldn't after that.
---
I feel like the devs are making the same mistake with Demo's add-ons that they made with Pig.
---
The portals are good, but Shred is the main power.
---
SMH. This isn't a lag switch. Just poor console netcode. It's the same as survivors running out into the endless void at exit gates, it's a desync but the killer isn't doing it. This wouldn't be how it looks. There are plenty of examples of real lag switchers out there, and it looks totally different. With a lag switch, the packets all catch up at once on the client (you) side. So you wouldn't be able to change position (you'd teleport back even if you did) and the killer animation would be akin to a speed hack (all actions would appear very suddenly and fast as your client recieved the information).
---
Maybe to powerful in small maps like the game ?
---
lmao i had a feeling it was a joke. cheers
---
Bro, this is unreal engine 4. People make entire living rooms looking realistic AF in this engine. It should deff be possible.
---
The virgin "Face" vs The Chad "Maw"
---
if you want a killer I recommend Plague and if you want a Survivor I'd recommend Kate or Jane
---
I did, it plays a heartbeat effect, hard to hear in the video tho
---
My GF would be more than happy to verse you or any biker Kate. Maybe next time
---
That’s very unlikely when he was perfectly fine the whole time even loaded in with a 50 ping so yeah
---
Fuck off.
---
How easy do you need it to be? There used to be multiple infinities per map. Now there is 1 left?
---
Git. Gud
---
Xbox and im getting straight up red ranks when im green
---
Iron maiden noises
---
Console, yes?
---
Thought for a second that Myers is standing behind Steve and got really spooked for a second.
---
I'm interested...
---
What am I looking at here?
---
This killer is so much fun
---
REPAIR A GEN ON THE PTB? CRASH.
---
HOOK A SURVIVOR ON THE PTB? CRASH.
---
UPGRADE BLOODWEB ON THE PTB? CRASH.
---
BREATH ON THE PTB? CRASH.
---
DEMO IS SUPER FUN AND PEOPLE SEEM TO REALLY LOVE ~~STEVE AND~~ NANCY, BUT THE PTB IS ABOUT AS STABLE AS A THREE LEGGED GIRAFFE THAT JUST CAME HOME FROM A NIGHT OF HEAVY DRINKING.
---
*Stealth kills himself*
---
Now this looks like a job for me
---
Can you please stop typing barrowed?
---
4 meters is littrely just the same range that survivors can interact with it. So you bascally have to be touching it to get it. also, his teleport does have a cooldown and is slow
---
I like it the way it is, but I was hoping to see that their head had disappeared when I first watched the Mori.
---
If surge has 24 meters I cant see it realistically ever hitting more than one gen :/
---
Specially clown Mori
---
then what’s the point of taking urban evasion except for the LOS blocker.
---
Well an idea is when it comes out, demo Gordon has cruel confinement. Won’t work forever but it’s more helpful for a while
---
I literally do.
---
What
---
There should be NO infinites just like there should be no campers or hard tunneling. This has nothing to do with needing the game to be easier this is about game balance and removing obnoxious bs from the game.
---
Trying but thanks smartass :3
---
Cool. So you don't have to hold a button to activate it? It's automatic assuming they are near your portal? Great finish btw! He looks amazing to play.
---
:( it’s no joke it’s great
---
Which is a stupid argument. Just because unbalanced shit exists doesnt excuse adding more unbalanced shit. Do I think the lunge working with NOED is that huge a deal? No. But the fact is that this exact argument is being made and that so many people are supporting it, which is absolutely mindboggling.
---
Whatever builds you’d prefer! I usually run bbq, bamboozled, discordance, and the last perk I alternate on the clown. I like rancor for perks in general.
---
Borrowed*
---
Wraith rocking some dread chains
---
That is the point...
---
Besides, how does fixated working while injured invalidate that in the first place? It either already did, or still wouldn’t. The only thing that’d change would be people using fixated, and then urban when injured, which is a pretty weird build.
---
What rank are you?
---
Lol, you play goof one time and you are expelled from the tree house.
---
IMO that Billy was just trying to give them a break. Either that or the guy gave the controller to his 8 year old brother.
---
I like Noob3 and PainReliever, but Tru3 is goat for me
---
That is a fair assessment, as this game is not forgiving in any way. It would be good if there was a tutorial of some sorts to help understand all of the intricacies of the game and some tips like don't fast vault everything.
---
I thought the same thing. Not the same when it just smooches you to death.
---
randoms piss me off sometimes but not as much as when i roll with a swf. got my buddies trying to tell me how to play the game even though ive been playing since beta lol
---
He looks like he's about to give Dustin a lecture about how to impress the ladies.
---
It’s a joke.  Smh.
---
His add-ons are weaksauce (except his pinks) but he's really good at base so he doesn't much need em.
---
Yeah it was his phucing fault he ended up there instead of running like most would do
---
NOW THAT THE STRANGER THINGS CHAPTER IS ON PTB, IF YOU PLAY ANY OTHER KILLER ON THERE BESIDES DEMOGORGON, I'MMA BE REAL PEEVED MAN. I WANT TO SEE THE COOL NEW GUY!
---
ALSO THE AMOUNT OF FACECAMPING ON THE PTB IS REALLY NOT NECESSARY. WE'RE ALL PLAYING LEVEL 1-10 STEVES AND NANCYS - ITS NOT LIKE WE CAN ATTEMPT A BORROWED TIME SAVE MAN. QUIT IT.
---
Im pretty sure he was meming around. At least i really hope he was...
---
So this Is a freddy nerf 💀💀💀
---
buT lEGioN aLrEadY gOt A rEWorK
---
Indeed. PC can play the ptb only, of course but they can’t do anything live until release day like the rest of us.
---
Their rework is Garbage
---
Yeah, but it's probably cuz I play too much gta lmao
---
Are you slow? Your job as a killer is to kill. It's not mean or nice.
---
Is this the best Map ever?
---
Like, at first, it seems shit, like, so confusing and troublesome to go around, but then you realize that it complements in such a good way the Idea of Terror Game the developers had: Wits Battle while in High-Stress Terror Scenario, not just looping around.
---
I can forgive bugs. Especially in a game with lobbies like that. Hmm. Maybe next time it’s on sale I’ll try and pick it up. Been waiting for that game to console since I first found out it existed 😂
---
Every terror radius based perks is going to get effected by this though, no more infectious fright freddy
---
If this was a nerf on purpose that sucks cuz I just bought spirt
---
tbf Hag doesn't actually change the body's model, just adds in some gorey bits on top of it... the Clown does actually remove a finger that's true, but they could have different models for hands vs the rest of the body. can't say for sure since I've never messed around with their models / actually know much about 3d modeling in general :) 
---
🤷‍♂️I agree they could do the work to be able to support this stuff, but it doesn't feel like they have *yet*
---
Low Amp Filement and Long Life Battery.
---
&gt;I care. 
---
You’re the real MVP
---
FRED KREUG gonna get a piece of that ass.
---
FOR REAL.
---
Does this mean we're gonna get people crying that he takes no skill and that he must be nerfed?
---
Beauty.
---
The spirit can fake vault a window by phase shifting while standing next to a window looking like they're vaulting
---
Good point. I'm guessing they atleast thought about doing it earlier though
---
Oh well damn yeah thats fucked
---
LMAO this is the guy who said you were tunneling him? YIKES
---
Only if they replace the running sound with Mr. Krabs running.
---
Read the subreddit rules before posting please
---
Even the pink one where he can see injured survivors is just meh. Doesn’t really change up the power very much like other pink addons. If anything, it should have another bonus to it.
---
r/angryupvote
---
Well... I mean, that’s the sacrifice you make for going with low settings.
---
DONT YOU DARE BRING THAT BACK INTO MEMORY
---
So play Nurse then
---
That doc skin is wild. Oddly enough I think I like it better with the opaque mask.
---
And I thought I was a bad survivor
---
Inner strength is for survivors, it's the one that allied then to heal by doing totems and getting in a locker
---
This prob won’t happen again when it actually release because the good survivors will get used to it and be able to juke it
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Sounds like the youtuber when you say it that way
---
It does indeed work with NOED.
---
Jeff is one happy boy
---
No I think it was that other perk that blocks windows
---
Sorry for stupid question, I’m not quite sure what PTB means but does this mean the new characters are live? Or is this only on test servers?
---
So do I, want to not queue up together?
---
No, we want a Steve Harvey survivor
---
Looks like a troll offering
---
Yea inconsistent movement speeds is very weird. I'm curious on why your really on a no mither sorta deal. You a no mither user too?
---
Yea true.
---
We need more people like you \^\^
---
Looks like someone's been shitting in the tall grass ¬. ¬
---
Yeah... I am. 
---
Flip flop
---
Tenacity
---
No mither
---
Yes Match Making is broken
---
It is very possible that you are just getting decent survivors.
---
It’s not an offering it says key add-on right on it
---
It blatantly says key addon.
---
you can play against him kinda like huntress with the pounce. it's scary, but he can't turn with it, just dont' go in open spaces. also break his portals the second he's in chase, you do NOT want all the gens portalled up, his map pressure is insane if he gets to set up
---
IT HAPPENED
---
Gonna get Head On. Hoping for Pop Goes the Weasel and Thrilling Tremors next week
---
And they sound like they don't give a fuck about their situation. Especially Steve on hook.
---
The actual Temple building is really cool.
---
What sucks about Temple is that it's on Red Forest, with all that realm's problems.
---
also haunted ground
---
Looks like The Joker gave them laughing gas
---
What even is this game lol
---
Like OG beartrapped amanda?
---
Is this fr?
---
As a pig main I hope they fix that out of spite / jealously
---
They've been trying real hard on maps ever since Badham, plus they didn't have to make a map for Ghosty, so they've been putting resources into this one for a while.
---
**depth tutorial mode
---
This 100%! The current tutorial is horrible, and doesn't help at all. I honestly had to go to YouTube to learn how to actually play killer!
---
Doesn't work with Pigs m2
---
Oh RIP, the title threw me off, the way I though it was you give it in, you are not the obsession and the killer gets to see the obsession. = troll. My bad lol
---
Sorry I needed to speck slowly for the idiots in the back.
---
Sounds good, let's play SWR.  Survive with Randoms.
---
CRUEL CONFINEMENT WAS SUCH A METAL PERK NAME I'M DISAPPOINTED THEY CHANGED IT TO CRUEL LIMITS BECAUSE THE FORMER SOUNDS MUCH MORE BADASS

Oh yeah woo yeah
---
Thank you! Those ultra rare add ons sound really good.
---
Hit your middle button with the speaker in it.  That should swap it back
---
I  Bagus4 like the idea of a Steve Harvey survivor
---
No, this is new. Since the PTB. I've always played on low and it looks way better than that normally.
---
Urban Evasion will hinder your skill. Get used to the killer being on your ass so you can learn how to interact (looping and outsmarting) with them. A lot of people suck at this game because they try to stealth the whole way and rank up because of it then go down in 10 seconds in a chase. And besides that walking perk for Nancy is better.
---
"Ultra rare key offering"
---
I too dislike reading.
---
You must of hit the touch pad thing in the middle of the controller, it inverts the controls when pressed.
---
Demogorgon in open spaces is basically facing a god nurse, you'll get hit and then almost immediately hit again if you don't dodge correctly.
---
With balanced landing, pretty much any drop can become an infinite (haddonfield, harvester)
---
Speak*
---
They won’t be able to hear it that quietly, turn up the volume buddy
---
he thinks the servers will fix anything gigalul
---
Nice. As a no mither user I prefer a gen rush build with resilience and TINH(this is not happening) with dead hard. Anyways that's off topic I kinda agree with ya now that fixated should work while injured.
---
You could actually switch the characters around and it would still work.
---
Glad to see another fellow Xbox player on this subreddit
---
The caption itself deserves my upvote
---
What do you mean???
---
Totally. One of the best cosmetics they’ve ever added.
---
Your signature will bring us the best dbd survivor ever.
---
Damn that sucks.
---
Really hope they fix matchmaking soon.
---
Yeah it is pretty lame. Like at least take the skin off the head.
---
How's that Farrah Fawcett hairspray taste?
---
What makes me a good demogorgon? if I were a bad demogorgon, I wouldn't be sittin here, discussin it with ya now would I!?
---
The mori doesn't decapitate. It looks dumb.
---
I used to run resilience. Eventually I decided to just go all in with anti slug. They leave me for 2 seconds, hit a flashlight saver, and I’ve crawled away far enough to either completely get up, or flip flop out
---
Just don’t get hit at all and problem solved
---
Yep!
---
That’s a big oof if I’ve seen one
---
Man I don’t think even that epicness will make me turn my back on the new and improved Kate.
---
The rave possibilities are endless!
---
thank you
---
Imagine thinking these survivor perks are too good to be in the game lol
---
Smh
---
You get them back when they are destroyed yes. But no if all of them are placed you gotta wait until one is destroyed before placing one again, which should be changed
---
"The Public Test Build, also known as the "PTB" is a special BETA-branch of Dead by Daylight exclusive to the PC version."
---
What would his perks be
---
Demogorgon does seem pretty good, but the portals need to take longer to be destroyed, and a meter to tell the Demogorgon the leap is ready would be nice.
---
Ohhhhh okay thanks
---
Oh that's good. It would be annoying if you couldn't get any back at all.
---
Interesting. I just prefer resilience as I'm usually not the one getting chased more so on generators or saving. Nice to see a anti-slug build but if I'm honest why pick unbreakable, is it for faster recovery?
---
/r/hydrohomies did him good
---
Just in case you only played today: the dedicated servers were only yesterday, we're back on peer to peer for the Stranger Things PTB.
---
*P3 Claudettes
---
Oh yeah I totally agree. If they just made it a temple map, maybe made the temple larger and gave it a small courtyard it would be amazing.
---
Can we have a texture pack for this?
---
Just have them turn into a HK student when getting beheaded. Boom china approved
---
Husband bought this as soon as he woke up this morning. She really looks good and totally different, BUT I really want a cowgirl cosmetic for her - even if it's just the cowboy hat!
---
Nice downvote btw. 
---
Spirit still requires you to chase the survivors, albeit in her invisible speedy form. But she can still be somewhat be looped and gets stopped by walls and elevations. Good Nurse on the other hand is literally unstoppable; your opinion is just bad.
---
He's live on PTB
---
That top row looks cursed as fuck lol
---
I was saving for steve and nancy .. but not anymore i guess ....
---
My Nvidia runs it fine
---
No there was a data-mining situation and the devs confirmed it as fake
---
people don't like streamers
---
Reading hard
---
The doctor totally fucks
---
No idea. That’s for the devs or community to figure out
---
I think the map is great for trapper, every blind corner could be a trap waiting to get you.
---
Dang, I really want that in the game now. Maybe we could even have stuff like Ace doing a card trick or Claudette patching somebody up.
---
Really? I thought was the whole time. I played yesterday and it was great
---
Harvey Dent would be proud.
---
at rank 1 your gonna get pretty good survivors most of the time. you can't really play characters you don't have perks on, especially if your new to the character. ur just gonna get looped and gen rushed like that. at rank 1 you gotta play killers ur really good with or you gotta get perks on someone before you try them. obviously to do that you just play ur good character and spend the points on the new killer you wanna play. it just be like that sometimes
---
Same tbh
---
Yeah. Not gonna bother discussing with such ignorance.
---
There should also be a dr phil killer with Steve Harvey
---
Hes live on the ptb
---
How did you do it?
---
If we really wanted to we could see Feng Min playing on a laptop
---
they had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
WHY THE HELL ARE PURPLE RANK SURVIVORS SO GODDAMN BOOSTED?!! I WATCHED A BABY HAG ALMOST GET A 4K BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CROUCH. I LITERALLY DIED ON MY FIRST HOOK AFTER LOOPING FOR 3 GENS BECAUSE THOSE MOFO'S RAN TOWARDS MY HOOK. ANOTHER THING, JUST OPEN THE FUCKING EXIT GATE!!! I SEE SO MANY PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE THEY 99 THE GATE AND RUN AROUND LOOKING FOR EVERYONE ELSE. UNLESS SOMEONE IS ON THE HOOK JUST OPEN THE GODDAMN FUCKING SONOFABITCH GATE AND LEAVE!!!!
---
the "tutorial" that this game has should just be changed to redirect you to a YouTube video on how to actually play
---
Rank 1?
---
Wow! Nice drawing. Who are you planning to draw next?
---
What would the chapter be called? ‘The Game Show Chapter’ seems too lame
---
TTV = twitch.tv 
---
It just means they stream, typically when its someones steam name it means they're live and streaming at that moment
---
YOU SONUVABISHHHHHH!!!!!!!
---
HOW DARE YOU HURT DADDY STEVE!!!!!
---
Unfortunately, our outlooks on this discussion are at odds, mate.
---
don't take me on this but I think every emergency red light lit up
---
I stopped watching all of tru3's stuff after his Kingdom Come:Deliverance stream. 
---
First I watched Absolver, in which he easily spent up to 30 minutes of dead time looking for objectives the whole chat was telling him about, then he replayed the same boss over and over because he didn't understand he had beaten it. 
---
Honestly the way he only halfheartedly tries something when he doesn't get it pisses me off. He's a good player, but if he doesn't get something, it's like he shuts down to all advice. People will tell him what to do, he'll start doing it, it's almost working, and then instead of doing the next logical thing to finish it off and learn the concept, he'll drop it, and wander off on some tangent of the game trying to "figure it out" for 40 minutes. 
---
I was already fed up from Absolver, but KCD absolutely made me rage. I only made it to part 3, after he spent half the steam savescumming an area to steal arrows, only to do the exact same freaking thing every time, and surprise, surprise, was caught, every. single. time.
---
**Of the Abyss** is the channel, and the ability to place portals, **Shred** is when you attack while channeling **Of the Abyss**.
---
This shit happens with every game that does p2p. For Honor sub would not stop whining that p2p is garbage and dedicated servers will fix shit netcode. SSBU does the same thing. Good p2p netcode is way better for games like this because it removes the middle man. Its literally a direct connection to the other people. Dedicated servers however now require a relay in-between you and other people. Not to mention server side  lag compensation. And on top of it all, p2p works even if servers go down. I definitely think if they would have invested more in the p2p netcode and not gone the route of dedicates servers it would be just fine.
---
OH MY JESUS GOD WHY DO THE HIGHER RANKS ALWAYS GET MORE IDIOTIC AS THEY RANK UP?! I WATCHED A RANK 3 GET KILLED BECAUSE THEY'D RATHER 99 A HOOK THAN GET HEALED. STUPID BITCHES GET STUPID DEATHS.
---
All of the viable killers have speed abilities and the only one who doesn't has hatchets.
---
No mither would have been useful that game
---
PURPLE RANKS IS FUN AS KILLER
---
no this is Patrick
---
With a doctor Phil skin
---
Congrats on you first perfect but that rank 14 I feel bad for him in a match with green purple ranks
---
Maybe broken was a bit of hyperbole, but it doesn't seem like a fun mechanic to play against.
---
!remindme 1 hour
---
LMFAO! That would be amazing!!!!
---
Any streamer that doesn't start out with a 2 and a half minute intro and perk explanation. 
---
I get the whole "new players" argument, but basically a fifth of the video is just waffle about stuff I memorized 10 hours into the game. That's literally like the first skill I learn in any video game; I memorize the skills/perks/addons/items/abilities/ect.
---
Sadly you can't...

Steve screams for like 10 seconds sometimes
---
We asked 100 Dwight’s....name something you do to help out you escape.
---
SOMETIMES WE HAVE PERKS ON US THAT SHOW US WHERE THE KILLER IS OR WE HAVE TEAMMATES WHO WE KNOW ARE BEING CHASED. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND WILL TRY TO HEAL AFTER UNHOOKING EVEN IN THE TERROR RADIUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. USE YOUR BEST JUDGEMENT OR BRING A MEDKIT WITH BOTANY IF THEIR DUMBASSES KEEP GETTING YOU KILLED. BEST OF LUCK
---
When did they make it stop working with pig? I could have sworn it worked with her 😞😞
---
There back story are in the show.
---
“ I BGFNCY like the idea of a Steve Harvey survivor”
---
THERE IS AN ADD-ON THAT SHOWS YOU HIS RANGE/HITBOX BEFORE YOU USE IT, IT REALLY HELPS YOU GET A FEEL FOR HIS SHOCK ATTACK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
---
YES!!! Finally they are able to get back to the way the game is supposed to be: Random, limited communication and scary!
---
She looks like Ashe from Overwatch.
---
My general feedback is that it was enjoyable that the ping I loaded in on didn't generally change throughout the game. This meant if I had joined a lobby and it was 300 ping I could just leave no problem. However, I was confident that if I joined a 100 ping lobby it would keep like that. In addition, I look forward to the tools the devs can use to track behaviour (e.g. DCing) actually being used.
---
Laughs in mirror mike
---
I play with randoms all the time and we do fine
---
he straight up squeezed the titty right after holy damn demodog you go son
---
Oh fuck sake we don't need a new 10X worse ochido
---
I just played a match, and it doesn't feel like its on a dedicated server. I had 300 ping as survivor, and at the end of the match it said HOST DISCONNECTED when the killer left. If the killer is STILL hosting the server, then its not a dedicated server. I don't get it.
---
Truth.  And Hex Ruin was on there last week, but I had already grinded for that myself.
---
To be honest, IMO Enduring is generally as strong a perk as PGTW and stronger than Discordance.  Just not for the killer/build I'm trying to make.
---
You could counter thst by preducting where they are going to juke juke huntress.
---
Just run iron maiden
---
He's fun to watch but his humor is one note and his survivor gameplay in particular is the same thing every time. 
---
"I'm going to run a gen build!" Loops killer all game.
---
"I'm going to run a looping build!" Loops killer all game. 
---
"Saying cunt after every sentence and to describe every other player in the match is hilarious, especially the 403rd time!"
---
"Being sarcastically boastful about how good/toxic I am is humble and not at all boring to hear every video!"
---
Oi, i'm not raging but i'm just here to ask a question. Didn't we have an upcoming double bloodpoint event?September 5th or something?
---
I JUST HAD A TOXIC FENG BITCH DO THAT TO ME!!!! SHE KEPT INTENTIONALLY MISSING HEAL SKILL CHECKS AND DC'D THE MOMENT SHE WAS FOUND.
---
What is mori???
---
Why is the Hawkins laboratory calling it the upside down? Isn’t it just a term that the kids made?
---
I'm thinking of a Demogorgon Basement Camp build, where you run Deer Lungs and Unknown Egg, place a portal at the top and bottom of the stairs after hooking a survivor in the basement, and then find a corner of the map to hide in, when the top portal notifies you of a survivor, travel to that portal just before you think the unhook is gonna happen, if you run Make Your Choice, you can snag the person who saved on the way out, and if you run Devour Hope, you should be far enough that you get a token before/while (depending on distance) tunneling.
---
Would it be fun for survivors? Probably not, would it be effective? Nobody has tried it yet so we'll see.
---
Bonus points for a gen being in same location as the basement so Surge hits the gen every single time.
---
Ash’s backstory had 4+ paragraphs in it.
---
Plastic Demogorgon
---
WHAT OUTFIT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?! KATE HAS A BLACK AND WHITE OUTFIT BUT THAT IS A COMMON COLOR COMBO!
---
I think Trapper should get a secondary ability, like the Pig and Freddy.
---
The dedicated servers were PTB yesterday. Today’s PTB was for the new dlc.....

I'll ban evade for as long as reddit makes it piss-easy. Takes literally less than 15 seconds. Logout, register, random email, username and password who cares and boom. Reddit doesn't require you to verify your email.
---
i know i said "new offering" but in my defense i was distracted by the item i had never seen before ever
---
Hawt
---
What is happening ?? lol
---
The thing is I'm new to pc, I'm rank 15. The whole rank 1 thing was just to prove I'm not a potato who can't mind game or loop correctly. I need the perks right but how can I get the perks if I need them to win
---
calm down its a video game
---
Yeah it’s end of season 3 spoilers for the show
---
Yeah, sage advice from you, I'm just being impatient lol.  A lot quicker to just get it off the shrine.
---
What is it now Sif
---
Did the devs mention removing the scream?
---
i'm reposting because yall can't forgive me for being distracted by an item i've never seen before
---
Doesn't Ash have an entire show + movies to work off of? Especially the movie parts &gt;_&gt;
---
"Hide in a locker"
---
Same energy
---
Even for survivor?
---
These are my favourite, especially when killer has proof
---
Agreed, it should work while injured as well.
---
I still need to know from which gay porn is that picture. I NEED IT.
---
No, it doesn't appear so.
---
**Intense Tbagging**
---
You overestimate how much you can see in the upside down. It’s not comparable to the Plague’s Black Incense. 
---
They’re both really good, but I wouldn’t say they’re both amazing. Moss definitely feels pretty strong, a lot like Legion’s pink add on.
---
Would love it.
---
I’d buy this cosmetic in a heartbeat.
---
Is anybody gonna mention jason?
---
Thanks, good advice, it's really just a matter of how patient I am.
---
I don't want Overcharge at all, only Doctor perk I'd want is Monitor and Abuse (unless his perks are reworked).  I don't mind spending a few bucks here or there, so I'll probably just buy the licensed killers I want.
---
When you're hooked you wake up regardless
---
Hmmm. Have you played against him much?
---
Wait, do you mean what is that or what the Dems mori is?
---
Not quite. You can brute force it after a few trips and it doesnt take too much time. The time that the Ironworks infinite eats up to force it down is the main issue. Mini infinites are fairly situational as well and cant be used consistently with no mind games like the one being mentioned.
---
Good point.  Will keep that in mind if I ever feel like playing survivor one day.
---
There's a ton of animations like this already at the fire. They aren't quite as in-depth but each one shows off small glimpses of the characters to some degree. Bill sits in the same pose he died in in The Sacrifice comic, Quentin starts falling asleep and jolts himself awake, Laurie looks around nervously for her brother, and some of the more aggro personalities (meg, david, ash, etc) seem antsy like they're ready to get out and kick some ass. Its one of my favorite small details about the game.
---
I can't find the link but all they said was that they were currently investigating it.
---
Did you mean "naked"?

---
Ash Steve and Jeff look normal
---
I mean they’d have to get the license for the tv show first
---
I don't have access to the PTB, could you show us what Nancy's fireside stance/animation is like? I love these so much.
---
What is Deathgarden?
---
I mean if games from 10 years ago on technologically inferior engines could handle it... I'm certain this could. It's not like we're asking for Mortal Kombat levels of Gore. Just a little red stuff and some bone.
---
Ptb in nutshell
---
Tactic confirmed. Got the kill.
---
Why does she look like she wants to speak to my manager
---
Wouldn't be possible the Ghostface we got is from the mask license not the scream character  movie license plus if they do anything similar to the mask it could lead to a sue from MTV
---
My though it that Cruel Confinement is associated with animal and prisoner abuse if you Google it and they didn't want DBD be associated with that stuff
---
her face look gross to me something seems off.  otherwise I dig it.
---
*Meanwhile it’s number 4s answer*
---
oh alright. well it's the same as I said, if your struggling with other killers then play one your good with and build up blood points. you don't have to spend them on the killer your playing. and if you do want to play other killers you just gotta put time into them and get good at it. no killer plays the same and you gotta look for certain win conditions with each one
---
You already said it was after lvl 40, I didn’t refute that, I just added more information
---
happy killing my friend, see you in the fog
---
It's completely contingent on the license owners
---
Game and lerys suck for trapper
---
SteveHarveryDisbelief.gif
---
āh!
---
Doctor would get a Dr.Phil skin and instead of laughing when he hits a survivor he says “to the ranch”
---
Would the Mask license be able to get us the Wazuuuup! Mask, or would that be a separate license all together due to Scary Movie?
---
Ever heard of a game called Naughty Bear? You play as a teddy bear named Naughty a Bear in a happy carebear-esque village. However, Naught Bear is driven to killing them after they wrong him many times. The game has no blood or gore; just stuffing and cotton. Yet the game was banned because of violence. The game isn’t as violent as DbD, btw.
---
Found the guy that runs directly to the infinite at the first sight of the killer. Maybe you should “git gud” at looping instead of relying on help from the map generation. And before you try, no I’m not a killer main.
---
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO RESPOND, FRIEND!
---
I mean they can't really add a whole lot considering they are characters from a licensed show they don't really have in depth backstories if the characters themselves are simple
---
I like how theres this big brick gate thing attached to this building, it's so out of place
---
Looks like the new toxic gamer uniform tbh
---
No. But that doesnt  change what facts are
---
“YOU CAN’T SIT WITH US!”
---
They actually have the license for the mask I believe so the wazuup mask is actually possible so is a purple,green another colored mask
---
Cod is a terrible comparison though. Games with a lot of players in a lobby are way more vulnerable to a desync than dbd.
---
Part of me wants to downvote because this new key addon has already been repeatedly posted about yesterday...
---
But damn Steve's looking fine
---
Wow premeditated dismissal of killers complaints this is some next level survivor right here
---
Yeah well im at rank 15 rn. I have to work my way back up to where i belong
---
yes but he does his best
---
I can counter play most killers, but fuck I suck against Doc.
---
I’ve been trying to figure out when the next one even starts.
---
&gt;When her closest friend, Barb went missing
---
Does this bother anyone else?
---
Reminds me of that one scp.. (the 3D glasses one)
---
Those Nancy and Steve ones sound super NSFW 💀💀
---
I doubt there’s WiFi in the entities realm
---
Can someone explain what’s happening here?
---
*claps*
---
Good answer! Good answer!
---
China doesn’t like anything over there lol
---
If the game makes you rage constantly, uninstalling is probably the healthiest choice. Spend your time on something you enjoy, life’s too short to waste doing something you hate if you don’t have to.
---
XD
---
Is there a double blood point weekend coming up anytime soon?
---
Watch, you're going to get called out for this post being "against the rules".
---
Yeah it coulda been cool if they made the brick part like the rest of the place and the gate
---
I mean, the event in his backstory didn't happen at all in the show/movies, they could have done the same for Steve &amp; Nancy imo
---
That's not what he said.
---
What about the ps4 glitch where when entering a match, instead of loading, you see the dead by daylight logo pulsing and you can see the menu options like the bloodweb, loadout, etc.
---
I mean that specific comment wasn't calling the killer OP but saying that it's stupid you take ages to destroy his portal, can't stop without resetting it, and are forced to give away your position. Regardless of whether that's right or wrong, he's not calling the character OP so Carnegie's point stands.
---
Either way, some people will call him OP but this subreddit often makes it out like all survivor mains ever do is decry any new killer as OP, which simply isn't true.
---
I'd heard through Reddit it was tomorrow but now a streamer is saying it's been delayed.
---
I jaythebearded like the idea of a Steve Harvey survivor.
---
Especially if he gets a perk titled Survey Says
---
Wouldn't ever be possible having a decapitation in-game is enough to ban it in some parts of the country
---
I sort of want the "Shadow Dude" to be a killer. Obviously without the plus symbol, but a creepy "Faceless, shapeless person" could be a neat idea for a killer.
---
I mean quite a bit of people are bringing it up how creepy it is. Only problem is cosmetics and prestige for it.
---
And nea*
---
I would settle for the skin being ripped off too.
---
The problem is that it would get the game insta-banned in quite a few countries, but still...so no head?
---
You’re playing doc on console, you deserve it lol
---
No, the game released with an M rating. Don't know what you're talking about. It was banned in... Uzbekistan, though?
---
I also saw something about it being tomorrow, but I have yet to find anywhere saying that other than that one person.
---
IKR, it’s like saying “looping is toxic”
---
Being hit through a pallet isnt unintentional
---
I'm rank 9 so if u want add me onedart-1kill
---
I was doing a daily lol. Had to get 4 shocks. Trying to grind for Steve
---
WHERE ARE THE CAPITAL LETTERS YOU FUCKING RULEBREAKER? (YES BLOODHUNT STARTS TOMORROW)
---
Source? The [patch notes](https://i.imgur.com/5qZTs9v.jpg) say the dedicated servers will remain til the end of PTB.
---
If they want this game to succeed this can't happen. I'm fucking raging. I can tell you there's definatly better killers in queue than me I was waiting upto 10 mins. How am I the best pick for those teams. I even put a mori on one game, massive waste.
---
Easy: Just play Wraith or Ghostface.
---
We have to come together as a community to make this Steve Harvey thing happen
---
Worth noting you can't get rid of his portals until he's used them once,  which seems a bit weird to me.
---
Lmao he thought you tunneled him? What a loser
---
Agree. Headpiece is ugly, rest is really good.
---
devs shot the date down it was announced prematurely. Matt said in Vinces stream a bit ago "you'll see it soon enough" but thats all he gave
---
Ill be back on in like 10 mins
---
There's a known problem with matchmaking right now. If it's game breaking for you, take a break because it's likely not getting fixed until dedicated servers
---
They have to spend the entire time moving slowly and paying attention to avoid traps out of chase. In chase, her traps are very effective. I honestly dont know why you say her traps are ineffective in chases, when that is one of her greatest strengths. Maybe hags are different on console but on pc she is top tier
---
I never liked the MTV version anyway, the idea that it was a post surgery mask instead of just an iconic costume was weak.
---
Agame where the killer facecamps and tunnels after every hook is usually the easiest game to play, as long as someone has borrowed time and a bit of common sense. As soon as a killer is playing like that, im relieved because theyre predictable. Gens will get done and 3 of us will get away.
---
Since pc only ptb users to play right now does it have the new soundtrack when in main menu or killer menu?
---
I'm not on rn
---
Low settings dbd looks like a playstation 1 horror game
---
From my experience playing him, this isn't the case (I could be wrong).
---
ALREADY FUCKING ADDED THEM NOW, WHY ARE WE FUCKING SCREAMING? THANK YOU FOR THE HELP, MOTHERFUCKING CHEERS.
---
Oh trust me i'm with you in that mm in this game is complete trash. But Apparently this reddit has a rule against these posts. It's hilariously stupid.
---
Well, its takes a bit of time to get out of noobie ranks and I've rarely ran into hardcore SWF. Just smurfs who derank or stay low and just know every loop by heart.
---
What if the abimation you saw was different based on which country you are in? That doesn't seem too far fetched?
---
What did they do to bully you?
---
I honestly can’t tell the difference, hair looks the same to me in both pictures. Face is better though.
---
thats exactly my doc outfit lol
---
What's wrong with doc on console?
---
What's the name and description for the new Doctor weapon? I keep trying to figure out what it's supposed to be, but my current theory is it's a piece of a surgical robot that was ripped off of the machine given the "Drill bit" tip and wires on the end.
---
Wasn't delayed, was just never announced
---
With the grammar? Yes. I think there should be an additional comma after Barb. Or they could just get rid of the comma and it works fine.
---
So she's emerging from a wall on the Stranger Things map.
---
*Ironic.*
---
PS1 demogorgon
---
yeah, but he can't tell if you're near it unless he uses it to "activate" it luckily
---
Survivors are able to level without being able to get even 30k bps/game. You just have to play more
---
Nah, the possible physics fuck ups aren't worth it.
---
Its another game by Behaviour. Its like DBD but futuristic and with guns
---
I honestly think the host advantage is fair on the killer side, as long as the ping is under 150, as a survivor can play around lag, while the killer can't. For example a survivor can drop a pallet early but a killer would need to predict the survivors exact location to hit them which is just dumb. 
---
Btw do you mean ping of 30 to the server or to other players? Usually dedicated servers increase the overall ping so i doubt that 30 will be consistent
---
3 gens in first 2 min and a dude running an infinite around the middle. I'm just bad but still. Rank 14 versus two rank 3s is big brain
---
This.
---
A comment in another post said there should be a gore dlc, maybe a function to turn on “excessive” gore in the game.
---
Why?
---
He was my favorite :D
---
Why is there a cooldown for using tunnels? Demagorgan is just a bad freddy smh my head
---
I'd so rock old Laurie
---
Can someone please explain?
---
how sweet. fresh meat..
---
Why people keep asking this? BHVR never announced any bloodhunt. 
---
Yes the wiki showed a date on their page but the wiki isn't BHVR.
---
I am sure once dedicated servers and the new chapter goes live they will pay more attention to it. 🤞🏻🤞🏻
---
Silhouettes really not necessary, just leave the + icon and it'll be fine.
---
Lmao okay you're not grasping this so I'm done with this loop we're on.
---
More importantly.. that’s a bomb-ass cosmetic set you’ve got there.
---
Would buy, I loved the show.
---
I definitely will have to take a break. Maybe perminently. I only started recently. I like to play older games that have had the time to clear out bugs but the more I play this the more a meme it becomes
---
Not gonna happen because the game would be banned in certain regions.
---
Omg didnt even think of that bc of the hype... now I want him so bad T.T
---
That joke was so corny all killers became temporarily blind.
---
Take your upvote, you bastard!
---
I don't have pc lol
---
you and your friends are weird!
---
Maybe you should just take a break,clear your mind and come back. Everybody has bad games and gets tilted eventually. Here's an old clip of tru3 getting cooked and even he lost his shit and rage quit. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VgdnN6Pv2TE
---
You gotta 3 gen them. 3 portals at gens, 1 at each gate, and 1 for keeping when you really gotta teleport or put it in the basement for the camps like a hag but better, he’s op you can’t even do gens
---
Can i take this format?
---
Get Behaviour'd
---
Sure lol
---
The only reason the rule exists against these posts is because this sub gets spammed with them. Everyone here agrees matchmaking sucks, and the devs are aware of it. 
---
Having the discussion for the 100,000th time isn’t going to do anything but clog up sub.
---
Yes it was made on kizoa.com the best free online video editing software
---
Is it really 5 meters, like a 5m radius? I've played him and I didn't think it was that big, that's fuckin ludicrous.
---
A Robert England Freddy skin would be cooler, the MTV adaption was mediocre I'd rather not have it infect DBD.
---
Worst part is that he followed the entities rules while Nancy and Steve didn’t(Won’t stop me from maining Steve though)
---
Use pastebin
---
The head isn’t removed because they don’t want the game being banned in certain countries.
---
But I think just sucking on the survivors heads is enough to kill them
---
um.......ok......i wasn't not already calm?
---
r/jokes
---
She really does look amazing in this skin. I’m a Kate main, so it’s hard to resist!!
---
Sorry I guess.
---
When hag places a trap next to a pallet and the survivor trips it then they go to the pallet because they know they'll get hit if they dont act quick so you could go for the teleport and they vaulted to  the other side already. Let's say you go for the survivor you get stunned by the pallet but your trap went off so you go for it and they are already on the other side because they are situational on pallets. If you try to place down a trap at the loop the survivors will run away to the next one. You could fake it but that isn't as effective against good players.
---
Hawkins is fucking terrible. Who the hell thought "Hey let's combine The Game and Lery's?"
---
Fr I’m rank 2 and going up against rank 16 killers and rank 20s I feel bad so I don’t illy them.
---
Which normally i'd agree with but when the issue has gone on this damn long with no resolution then yeah, spam away. This literally effects the game and we've gotten nothing.
---
It’s probably more like 4m like prove thyself range, it’s pretty small, smaller than a hag trap, but can’t really be countered if used correctly. He’s insanely good at 3 gening, best killer at it actually
---
Most of the feedback I've seen seems to think that Demo is on the weak side. Then again I'm browsing the Steam Community Discussions, and they still think Ghostface needs buffs.
---
She’s mine too. Especially cause with her white default top and blonde hair she looks like Sheri Moon Zombie in Devil’s Rejects.
---
Killer main here; teabagging, sure it’s annoying. Looping???? Wtf you expect them to do? That’s quite literally the best way to waste your time. Learn to switch targets. Aka git guud.
---
I agree with this, why is Doctor so underestimated on console.
---
"Have you played the PTB?"
---
"No, I'm on console"
---
"Thank you for completing this survey"
---
If they were to do that they would have to do the same for every killer
---
Jakes, not Jake's. Learn English, idiot.
---
But they can make more accounts, and that doesnt solve the issue of me being unable to escape the situation without a temp ban. I have to report them, and they likely wont be banned for at least a week.
---
Ah okay, thanks.
---
What is so bad about Doctor?
---
You’re still part of the problem.
---
Yeah, it's just the easiest way to win at those ranks. Playing against tunneling effectively isn't something you regularly see until red ranks where everyone is running BT, DS, Adrenaline, and DH.
---
I don't understand why it only works while healthy. It would still be a mediocre perk even if it worked while being injured.
---
The devs are aware of it and have officially acknowledged it repeatedly. You’re spamming into the void.
---
Also i've been hit through walls 3 times as nancy vs demogorgon and i can't understand why.
---
ON XBOX SURVIVORS QUEUE UP IN A SWF GROUP UNDER YELLOW AND GREEN TO FACE EASIER KILLERS AND GET BOOSTED
---
Quiet infidel have this demogorgon and be gone. 90% what's going on.
---
Out of interest, could you also post the names and descriptions of individual cosmetic pieces?
---
It was leaked not confirmed. So who actually knows... could be tomorrow or next month.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what actually happened
---
New hair graphics
---
Which is why I think it should work while injured.
---
*killer uses a Game offering* me: hears screaming

Would hate it
---
Kinda looks like a cross between Billy, and hag to me. Honestly seems pretty cool
---
She looks very focused.
---
Changed it just a few weeks ago iirc
---
Lmao its easily one of the two strongest perks in the new chapter, but hey it needs to be buffed even more!!
---
Why didn't he go back into the locker you grabbed him from instead of the other one?
---
Why doesnt NOED work with Pig's dash then?
---
The wiki (and I guess game?) would disagree with you about that.
---
&gt;**Special Attack: Shred**  
---
Press the *Attack button* while charging or holding **Of the Abyss** to dive forwards and unleash a vicious slash. 
---
Phrased like that, his power is basically regarded the same as the Pig.
---
I don’t see how. It’s only primary use is speed, as the scratch mark effect can be learned and becomes unnecessary.
---
The last great one?
---
The abbatoir window is open 50% of the time as well.
---
That seems pretty complicated to me.
---
I hate them.
---
*nurse suddenly blinking from the top floor to the basement*
---
OH YEEEEAAAAAAAH
---
If youre in a chase Pig needs to crouch and charge before the dash. The Demi's lunge looks better tbh.
---
It’s been like that.
---
I remember when fortnite did this with the holograms. It was weird.
---
There's a difference between acknowledgement and actually working on it because so far we've seen absolutely nothing except bullshit.
---
Lol you forgot killers can vault over windows? Thanks for the laugh
---
Dont downvote me survivor mains but I hope his pounce is un360able
---
They mentioned that they tried a killer that broke through walls and such but it didnt work
---
Get them goggles out of here.

Tldr

I don’t care what anyone says you can’t remove the function to play the game with your friends lmao that’s dumb

Ah ok, I thought it was officially announced, damnit reddit.

Bottom row looks normal, top row has been claimed by Satan

Basically a stay off my fucking gens build. Thrilling could be replaced with Ruin or something else of your choice though same as BBQ if you don't need points. PGTW and Discordance are too good to change though.
---
No Mither also counters NOED
---
Right now, when injured it’s strength as a perk drops from urban evasion tier, to windows of opportunity tier.
---
It’s good, not great, and then it just becomes straight bad.
---
You got a link for a template?
---
Poor Steve
---
Not really, it's only oblivious, and Freddy didn't have a TR when survs were asleep. Only thing that's changed is Freddy can't run TR perks, and sleeping survs can't use BT.

How much are you being paid, since it’s “your job” to kill? 
---
You can choose to be nice in any game, including this one. That fact that your tiny brain can’t pick up on such a simple concept shows that you are part of the problem with this toxic community.

Too complicated from a development standpoint

Well... she looks around nervously for Michael. Remember, Michael and Laurie were only established as siblings in Halloween 2, and DBD only takes from the original movie.

Demogorgon gives mad head........sluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrp!

I'm more unhappy with them having the demogorgon's title be "the Demogorgon" instead of "The Monster"

It's like a hatchet, it goes in a straight line.
---
Ima have to pass on that one
---
Cause behavior hates the pig
---
They probably should've Googled it first.
---
Thanks, I laughed so f* hard with this comment
---
I mean I kinda prefer old Jeff but I don't really mind since I never see or play him so I probs wont even tell the difference in game
---
I THINK THE HAG WAS GETTING A DAILY BECAUSE WE WERE ALL PURPLE RANK. EITHER WAY I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYONE TO DO THAT. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST ENJOY THE GAME BUT ALSO TRY TO USE THEIR BRAINS. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
from what i can tell if one is destroyed you can place a new one but you can't remove your old ones
---
Pretty much. If 6 year olds play gta v i say just screw it. No point at all in having ratings besides for those overprotective mommies that'll teach their kid a thing or two with the belt of justice.
---
Yeah I think you are right, also knowing behaviour it would probably be very well optimized /s
---
The devs are aware of many things but they just haven't been able to put in the QoL changes that this game needs. People forget about the issues when the devs release licensed content but the truth is many of the game's problems have been there even since release. The devs either can't deal with these problems effectively or they prioritize new content over all else, or both.
---
So dont tp. Its a mindgame. If they vault back you hit them, if they run you tp. You can also place traps in narrow hallways or on longer loops so that survivors cant avoid a hit. Shes obviously not as good as nurse, but below legion? Bullshit
---
W-what?
---
True but it's harder to make use of. Most of my experience with that window involves people trying to reach it but getting downed or running it once then getting caught because they misjudged your move speed. That's just my experience though.
---
I'm not arguing that the game should be easy, I'm arguing that the game should be scary.  I probably should have explained better.  What I mean is that right now, aside from Spirit and Nurse, there is exactly one type of Killer/Survivor interaction:  looping.  Any killer (other than the two previously mentioned) that approaches you as the survivor triggers the exact same response, find a loop, start running in circles.  That's not scary, it's not immersive, and after 3 years it's pretty boring.
---
What I like about Nurse and Spirit is that they require a different sort of Killer/Survivor interaction.  With Nurse, it's all about breaking line of sight and forcing her to predict your movements.  With Spirit, it's about misdirecting with your scratch marks and managing the sounds you make.  That's really cool to me because it's a different interaction from the standard "loop until there are no more safe loops."
---
Again, it's not about making the game easier, it's about varying the ways killers and survivors interact with each other.  That variation, to me, makes the game more immersive, scarier, and just more fun.  
---
Again, if you love looping, fine.  I'm not saying you or anyone else is wrong for that.  But this game doesn't have to just be about looping.   Letting killers have powers that operate outside the normal looping paradigm and forcing survivors to play in different ways to react is a way to keep the game fresh and interesting for people who maybe don't love running in circles all the time.
---
&gt;makes me wonder what sort of experience you have on survivor role, did you ever faced a 5k + h nurse? legacy 3 nurse? do you have any experience what so ever to back up what you say regarding her having counters? or on what mind games you can do to her?
---
Just once, just one time, I want you to respond to me without belittling my ability to play the game.  Just once.  I have not once insulted your ability or questioned your hours or experience.  I just don't understand why you constantly need to return to this.
---
And yes, I've been a Rank 1 survivor and I've played against great Nurses.  I've been stomped by them, just like I've been stomped by great Huntresses and great Billies and probably every other killer in the game at some point.  But, because I don't have enough hours in the game, you'll never put any stock in anything I say.  So [here's Tru3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FofNyEmggGM&amp;t=508s), who has thousands of hours in the game, explaining and showing exactly how to counter a Nurse.

I love the doctor wdym?

They don't have the *Scream* license though. They have the Ghostface license from the *Scream* films. Also that mask sucks.

Koolaid Man Nurse when?

Thats not bullying lol just sounds like a map you arent particulary great at and thats fine

Self care actually takes 32 seconds 😎😎😎

I almost want to give him respect for trying such a ballsy move, but it sounds like he was a dickhead from the other comments

Fun fact, you can counter iron maiden by never leaving the locker.
---
Weirdo
---
It still works if you use them on windows, or to direct survivors away from pallets, you just can't count on them going unnoticed.
---
Normally when they lag switch you can’t move though? At least that’s how it’s always been for me
---
....yikes.

Eh, it isn’t that bad. I mean, I’ve seen Nurses do

Use slippery meat. Best perk in the game

Stop gen tapping please, it's better if you literally just eat ruin skill checks. Even If you never hit the great skill checks

They should be pillars of smoke, not human-shaped outlines.
---
It’s the retro 80s demogorgon
---
1. Yes. They can see them coming out of the portal.
---
2. From what I can tell it get's cancelled. Not 100% sure 
---
3. Progress does not carry 
---
4. Not sure.
---
5. Not sure 
---
6. I believe about a week or two
---
7. Doesn't make me jump very much
---
Why did they rename simple formula to furtive chase? Who knows
---
This wasn't meant as a reply to your comment. Was meant as a separate comment entirely. Had a brain fart. My bad.

Yes

How long does it usually take for the PTB to come to stable? I'm new since the anniversary.

Now thats what I call a pretty good job... so far...

---
Maybe you should cry about it. You know, like a baby.
---
I agree it's pretty wimpy. I get the old one was unfun as fuck for the obsession. 
---
**How I'd change it.**
---
I'd just have the obsession also give stacks, and be affected by the slowdown. Once the obsession dies similar to STBFL you can't gain any more stacks. Still would reward not targeting the obsession right away and prevent tunneling the obsession to death, and since the obsession is slowed down too there's no reason to want to target him.
---
It's too similar to the proposed Remember Me nerf a year back where they wanted killing the obsession to remove half your stacks.  Simply "Locking" your stacks once the obsession dies would discourage tunneling him and if he was slowed down too, there'd be literally no reason to want to tunnel him either. 
---
As it is now you gotta slug the obsession repeatedly so they can't do gens.
---
It was posted to the wiki, which reddit then reposted here.
---
I MEANT BY RARITY
---
And it turned out that clown was a forgettable killer that no one ever plays
---
Yeah, Cruel Confinement was much cooler.
---
I honestly thought he was going to  chop up the head
---
I laughed out loud to this!
---
From what I’ve seen so far most people are using the tactic of camping the basement with portals.
---
Perhaps iron grip and agitation could prove useful?
---
&gt;So dont tp. Its a mindgame.
---
That's one way to get pallet stunned
---
&gt; if they run you tp
---
To what trap, if it's at a loop and they run what are you gonna tp to the trap on the other side of the window/pallet they vaulted.
---
&gt;but below legion? Bullshit
---
I mained legion to rank 3 and got consistent 4ks and I played hag to 40 and I got safety pips and the occasional pip even though I placed my traps correctly in loops. Hag is only good for ruin and nothing else.
---
Cause that makes sense logically right? Aim at their neck to blind their eyes 😳.
---
Survivors are still going to step in the traps anyways.
---

my boi ryan with the rank 1 killer games

www.twitch.tv/ryanpez69
---
I think know that other guy,but i don't know where i met him...
---
Holy shit, BHVR actually listened to the complaints about him.
---
They look ridiculous.
---
What effect does oblivious have on Spine Chill?
---
So guys, is the killer hitting you after you vault a window intended or still broken hitboxes? Coz I can kinda see it being part of the gameplay, but im not 100% sure about that.
---
Well they also found two flashlights and one of em just followed me around all game 360ing me over and over. And the nonstop teabagging too. Just real salt inducing all around.
---
Why doesn’t the survivor head come off during the Mori?
---
Problem is that you’re bound by the placement of your portals, and you can’t exactly free-look either during it. 
---
Like u/Chiffonades said, it’s not as good as The Plague’s very rare addon
---
Is that not the exit gate just missing the wall texture?
---
Fair enough. 👍
---
I like to think they're the exception not the rule
---
For those confused, when you first place a portal survivors can't see it until you burrow through it. The aura of the ones they cant see are white and ones they can see are yellow.
---
The killer instinct effect only works for those in the viscinity of a portal, so putting those by gens or hooks and detecting them via killer instinct seems to be the way to go.
---
I could also be wrong
---
r/thanksihateit
---
Heh
---
I almost did too. This is gonna make playing Doctor painful for me...
---
Since Bill is on console now i'm pretty sure you'll have to level him up like the others.
---
Am I the only one that's really not a fan of the ghost people? Just doesn't match any kind of theme in the game, I'd rather have a random crew of my own survivors [or select a few favourites] or just nothing at all. The pure black ghosts just seem so out of place
---
Yeah that’s probably the best reaction it’s gonna get.
---
Oh lame.
---
Hey man, this is pretty good :D
---
He’s been on PTB for 1 day. Calm down he ain’t OP.
---
Yeah sure its annoying but lighten up a bit (flashlight pun)
---
What the guy below said
---
Lol. Yeah idk I just get sad when I see red ranks over and over at yellow
---
gen rushing is a bit of a problem
---
this is a really really bad idea though
---
Listen, I dont know, these pig nerfs are a mistake
---
Don't like the face, but the rest looks alright
---
I don't know exactly what caused this, but I believe it's an issue with the heartbeat generated from detecting survivors near portals.
---
When the glitch began, I was in a chase with someone while I was also detecting the survivor I was chasing and another survivor. Might be something with the audio stacking that causes the bug.
---
no the gate is different, it's a pair of two door like gates
---
GET BACK HERE DWIGHT ME BOY, THE ENTITY IS GONNA GIVE ME A LOT OF MONEY IF I HOOK YOU!
---
I feel like the reason survivors are of bigger concern is these new players are just joining to play as the Stranger Things characters.  I feel Steve and Nancy are much more appealing to play as for ST fans than a random Demogorgon is.  Still valid points op.
---
Can still be un360able, can't 360 a hatchet
---
That sucks
---
I find that its the new norm so I just go with it. Plus I find lobbies really quickly so to me its a fair drawback. Lobbies used to take me at least 15mins, huge waste of time
---
Also how long has the match making been broken like this
---
When did you play legion?
---
If you did before the big nerf  then you have no idea 
---
And also
---
One of my favorite quotes from bricky 
---
"You will always beat a good nurse, you can beat a great nurse but you'll never beat a god nurse"- bricky 
---
If you master nurse It really doesn't matter what you play it on you'll never lose
---
My lobbies still take 10 min because my Nat type is bad at Uni
---
Reminds me of Onision's vegetarian body
---
Yup, im the tiny brain because i wanna kill people as a killer. Grow up.
---
Nice.
---
The ghostface just sighed lmao
---
It's PC
---
I’m just kinda imagining her shouting something about Bob doing something
---
Nice
---
I was unaware you could kill people who were already dead. Or that there was 5 survivors in a match. But good for you! Improvements always nice.
---
BHVR said that decapitation would raise the rating of the game, and make it potentially illegal in some countries.
---
calm down its a comment
---
Umm... looks to me like he was just meming about.
---
If by “the entities rules” you mean dying, plenty of characters didn’t follow those rules either.
---
Me too, before S3 :(

I look at steamforum and I only see „he is weak“-posts. Ironic

I love his stun sound,almost as much as wraith
---
michael and laurie were definitely established as siblings in the first one
---
Search on YouTube for some looping guides. If he has not play with your food, you can loop him for ages.
---
If he is camping just go do gens. Theres nothing you can do
---
In case its not obvious, he was somehow able to run out with an active RBT on his head
---
wait actually nevermind
---
Survivors can see yellow portals? 
---
So what does the killer instinct do though? You see auras of those who were cleansing?
---
Borrowed time and decisive strike are your best friends vs this guy. 
---
Hell, I run those perks every game anyways pretty much
---
Okay .. then who does it work on..
---
To bad he escaped because the pig was nerfed to hell and back because she was "too op"
---
Steam forum is a place full of whiny killer mains.
---
Demogorgon Dance Party
---
are you sure it was active? they only become active after a gen pops, so they won't work when you put them on after the last gen pops.
---
What is Chad? :(
---
Yeah, it's a comma splice.
---
Did anyone even say they were gonna remove it?
---
Lmao what.
---
-There is no indication in the original film that they’re related. None whatsoever. Maybe you’re thinking of a scene John Carpenter was forced to add in for network television a couple of years after release, but you buy and watch the film now (which is the original version) and there’s not a single reference to them being related. 
---
-John Carpenter himself has gone on record as saying he only introduced the brother/sister dynamic in H2 as a lazy plot twist when he was drunk writing it. 
---
Go watch the movie, and point out where the sibling relation was established.
---
I think they say something about this when they talked about dedicate servers in the 3rd year stream. Now with dedicated server they can give this people some "special" treatment
---
Stalking my old comments now?  Whatever floats your boat man.  I stand by that too, Dead Hard is a BS perk that has no counterplay when used optimally at safe loops.
---
Completely positive, its even red in the bottom left
---
Yes bro, Audrey and Noah were such good characters. I never watched s3 since its a reboot and it didnt have the Brandon james mask.
---
I USED LIKE 350 SQ TO TRY AND GET PRILLYA FOR THE 2ND TIME ~~900 LAST TIME~~ AND SHE STILL DIDNT COME AND I MAD &gt;:[  
---
IM ALSO MAD THEY HAVENT FIXED MY FUCKING ETHERNET AT MY GODDAMN APARTMENT SO IM PROBABLY GOING TO GET RANK RESET AGAIN BEFORE I CAN PLAY.   CANT WAIT TO GET FACECAMPERS AGAIN AND GRIND MY WAY OUT OF 17
---
you did it too early
---
Bought Myers this morning and literally first game with dying my obsession dc
---
What are they doing to change it?
---
I think Nancy's being held hostage
---
best part is at the end when he starts placing ANOTHER PORTAL to continue the dance party
---
No bloodhunt is currently announced
---
You laughing is the best medal I can get
---
Not even remotely ignorant. Spirit cannot go through walls, pallets, or up or down floors instantly. She cannot teleport into the basement like Nurse can. They're good killers but in no way comparable.
---
This is what actually happened
---

---
Moried by the hag
---
🤣🤣☠
---
The person being carried had been bleeding on the ground for a while. He timed it so when he was dropped, his bleedout toner would immediately hit zero. Basically he was slugged for 6 minutes and 59 seconds.
---
Nope, he cannot replace portals if all are up, which is a unique deficit to his pretty neat deployables.
---
Albeit it's rarely relevant, because glowy portals REALLY draw survivor attention, so if you ever have all 6 up, you're bugged out and stuck in an empty game.
---
&gt; If these can be believed (I don't) this put's the average survival somewhere close to 50% per player. If you're a 'skilled survivor' (R1-2) it's 70-80% on PC.
---
A developer confirmed that this part of the statistic was wrong. The system only counted people who finished the match as rank 1 survivors. That means most survivors that died (and depiped to rank 2) didn't count, so survival rate for rank 1 was really really high on the statistics. They said the survival was like 48% on rank 1.
---
&gt;somewhere in mid 30% would make for more interesting games. I'm going to predict you disagree.
---
I this way of thinking has plenty of problems, actually. I can make that number go even lower, I'll just play 3 blink nurse with range and mori. Does it makes the matches more interesting? Do you think it's more fun to play it?
---
Regardless of that, it's not about survival rates. Removing the sound indicator makes it less of something you can predict and dodge. You just guess. If you guessed right, you avoid it. If you guessed wrong, you get hit. It's spirit all over again, you don't have feedback that lets you react to things. You just take a guess. That's not really engaging, nor fun.
---
Got it, I'm looking up looping rn. The video is covering some tips but is there anything u can personally share about it that I should focus on?
---
if your far away you can hear the (slightly) quieter roaring of him when he uses his pounce or he lunges at someone, meanwhile when you're close to him it's very loud
---
It's like a fuck you to trapper mains, there's next to no where to set up traps and too many routes to avoid them :(
---
Big Sad
---
Him ans Jonathan :(
---
I never said it wasn’t
---
Yup, I was terrified, It was so fun.
---
They made it so when you hook survivors other than the obsession there is a penalty to repair progress
---
Maybe a huntress skin would work.  Just replace her lullaby and throw pikipeks or something
---
Go to the fungoose chanel on YouTube. His rap god looping tutorials are fucking sick. He uploaded one versus letherface some days ago where he didnt take a single M1
---
nvm im a dumbass and didnt pay enough attention before
---
oh, i'm sorry, i thought you were confused at first so i told you what's wrong, nevermind
---
It's exactly like a hatchet. In fact, it's better than a hatchet, it has a wider hitbox.
---
ok ur right buddy my bad
---
then what was the point in posting?
---
it is, but OP probably plays with controller on pc
---
Agreed.
---
It could even be made an optional toggle just like in so many other games.
---
Would be awesome to see parts getting chainsawed off and what not.
---
Or ya know, the chainsaws lol
---
At least it actually mentions how she got into the Entity’s realm.
---
Read Michael and Laurie’s backstories. They never actually mention how they got into the Entity’s realm (though we can assume it was when Michael was shot out of the window)- it simply says ‘lol Michael came home and Laurie fights back’.
---
Mr entity...
---
He's low tier tho
---
No problem!
---
No I believe you thanks tho man you're awesome
---
English isn’t their primary language.
---
is he well trained ? phil likes to chew on people sometimes
---
Im just curious about your thinking. What's wrong with that
---
thanks my dude
---
His new skin looks fatter compared to the others
---
YELLOW IS UNLIKELY, BUT I CAN SEE A GREEN OUTFIT BEING AVAILABLE AT SOME POINT. LATELY THEY HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON DOING THE MONEY MAKER OUTFITS.
---
Hi! Are you gonna be doing the new skins soon ? :3
---
It looks like the blonde vampire chick from Blade but with a shitty dye job and pony tails.
---
Yeah, this started like 3 months ago
---
At leasy the killer is fucking good, but yes the perks are trash. Well maybe the mind breaker...
---
Jendenise is actually a jerk though, that's the thing. And No0b3 was also a jerk at one point before cleaning up his act. 
---
People mori streamers because they assume anyone with TTV in their name is an asshole. Is that assumption fair? No, but let's not pretend there hasn't been fuel for those assumptions in the past or even in today's community.
---
AngryPug is a great example of a prominent asshole on Twitch. He bans anyone who disagrees with his views on the game in chat and shit talks the opposing side whenever he beats them or when they beat him. There is no being a good sport with him. He DC's whenever the game goes in a direction he doesn't like and talks himself up like DBD would die on Twitch if he stopped playing it.
---
So yeah, not all TTV names deserve moris but at the same time there are definitely ones that *REALLY* do.
---
xD yeah. So many moris are kind of... underwhelming.
---
Demo trying a smooth flirting approach this time don’t be so negative guys.
---
Is this a trick question? People were going to do that anyways, lol.
---
Or even just the skin. I was pretty disappointed. Could easily be a commercial for a Steve lollipop.
---
Supposedly they stayed mild on gore because other countries (I think Germany or Australia) have pretty strict standards when it comes to dismemberment.  Obviously they didn't want to lose potential players, so they kept the violence to a minimum. 
---
At least that's what they said up until they released the hag, who ripped peoples' guts out.  I don't know if they're still trying to use that excuse or not.
---
Yo is it weird that Nancy’s are kinda turning me on
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Who's loud
---
There aren't ragdolls in this game
---
Y’all horny for a shitty horror game character I’m out
---
3n7i7y
---
Never said ragdoll, but alright
---
It’s clear they know how valuable this property is for the game, and they’ve put a lot of effort into making it special. Also no doubt many of the devs are fans as well.
---
Monitor over noed?
---
I wonder if this is an oversight and will be fixed at released. A lot of secondary actions don’t work with perks so not sure why this is atm.
---
I let my wife play on my account sometimes and the survivors straight up abuse the fuck out of her. I'll take the controller and massacre them in a minute or 2 afterwards when I'm sick of seeing it. People can be shitty sometimes. She doesn't like playing much either because of people like that. Her favorite killer is billy but she doesn't really know what she's doing. I don't use him very often myself either but I at least know how to use him and destroy people. Honestly idk why people like playing 1 shot killers or the nurse/spirit. It makes the game to easy and boring to play for both sides.
---
I know but it seams like you're thinking of Friday the 13th. How would that fuck up physics? Give an example of what you think could happen.
---
&gt;another viable slowdown perk to replace ruin or pop
---
replace
---
#replace
---
sure......... because killers never stacked any of the game slowing alternatives devs provided.
---
I already faced a Demogorgon using Corrupt Intervention, Ruin, Pop and Surge. Let me tell you, it was obnoxiously boring working on a generator against this shit. I wish they never came up with Surge. 
---
He hooked someone, applied pop to my gen. Once I am about to finish it after recovering the progress, he downs someone near the gen (rancid, small map), hooks him and applies pop AGAIN to the same gen. 
---
Over 2 minutes working on the same gen.
---
inb4 a million people downvote you for being right
---
Some people wouldn't see the head pop off, others would.
---
I main Otz as well. Still waiting on Shirtless Otz skin.
---
Tier list goes:
---
Ash
---
Steve
---
David
---
Tapp

Jeff

Laurie

Quentin
---
Everyone else
---
Not currently, and as far as I know there is no plans for it in the future.
---
She “was” with Steven because she didn’t get the chance to breakup from what a recall. She didn’t love him and wanted to break up.
---
She just danced with Dustin cuz he was alone, plus, he didn’t have a dick, 
---
Yea, what happened to Barb was sad. I think she was drunk that night. Not sure.
---
I'm not thinking of Friday The 13th, no.
---
Okay, let's look at it this way. Survivor models in DBD do not have collision, per se. If you had a part of a survivor get detached midgame, it's high likely it's going to end up phasing through something, which would look ridiculous.
---
Yeah it’s only MA (15+) here in Australia
---
I'll have to see if the bloodweb is kind to me, I just keep getting bullied by the swf groups so I ran noed
---
Why you gotta attack doc, when ghostface looks like a kid acting scary
---
I dont play survivor dip shit. Don't tell people they need to tell other people live because its "muh positive thing to do". Asshole.
---
[Yes I do. Have fun.](https://i.imgur.com/nIiuizi.jpg)
---
You trap the map before they start, and force them to the trapped area. Much like trapper, you must spend time setting up the map early on, but you dont have to spend as much time because you start with all traps.
---
You can trap while being looped, forcing them to leave and risk getting hit or drop the pallet early. 
---
Every other person on this sub would say hag is better than legion. Ask anyone else.
---
You are also ignoring the fact that hag can trap outside of loops, letting her close the distance or get a hit. 
---
Her traps are hard to see, cant be disabled without an item, she doesnt have to pick them back up once triggered, and she can place them whenever she wants. Just because your not good with a killer doesnt mean their bad
---
I consistently 4k with hag as well
---
Thx
---
Well I think it makes sense I’m pretty sure the weekend before a new chapter there’s double BP
---
Did you make this in blender?
---
Yeah, I heard that, too. On that note, I live in germany... and we get the gory stuff here, too. Sometimes, games are unduly censored, sometimes not - it's very weird. Fucking legal bullshit.... Like, we have, to my knowledge, uncensored outlast here. We also have the Saw movies on free TV and what not.   
---
Anyway, thing is: At worst, you can make different versions. Sure, there is some extra work attached to that, but not horribly much - stuff gets censored/changed all the time based on country. China has a number of especially strict rules and still gets the games - for example, the depiction of (animate?)skeletons is an absolute taboo there - I think other undeads, too.
---
How’re you gonna spell “because” wrong, man.? At least have good spelling to help your shitty argument.
---
Agreed, the face should be a lot more bloody  and the neck should look like it's broken. Other than that it's one of my new favorite moris
---
Main menu
---
Cool down because consistency
---
&gt;Not sure what you mean be getting pallet stunned
---
If you just walk up to them willy nilly you're gonna get stunned 
---
Also trapper can place traps outside of loops but he can hard counter loops and can be glitched into the floor for sneaky plays while hag has to mindgame a trap while in pallet loops
---
That would completely put me off. Why can't they just do what every other game does. If you queue with higher ranks the entire lobby is classed as that rank and its down to the higher ranks tk carry the low ranks. Apex does this sucks at times but at least your going into a fair game.
---
inb4 game's name is changed to *Bullying Simulator 2019*
---
Roses are red, blueberries are blue, this joke sucked.
---
Awww is someone cranky
---
The detection only works on activated portals. If it’s just placed and hasn’t been teleported to, it won’t detect survivors. Survivors can only close activated portals. The cooldown on base kit is retardedly long. Demigordon kind of really sucks
---
Does it have it or just original music
---
What was that killer instinct ability?
---
Why is there a 4 next to dying light?
---
You can have 6 portals active at once. Killer Instinct appers when survivors are around 4 meters from a portals, but only when the portals are yellow. They turn yellow after you use them at least once. This affect happens when you hold the RMB power but this slows you down. 
---
You can teleport to any portal at any time they don't get closed unless survivors do it. The charging ablitiy is the portal cooldown.
---
What was that killer instinct ability

Guess you’ve never seen the difference between a good and bad nurse lol.
---
It took me some time to notice the difference
---
Haha I was doing this earlier. Why does it make you scream sometimes
---
lol nice. how was it? Personally I like 2 and 3 better than the first. More character development and such.
---
Try putting on a tar bottle
---
As the game currently stands, the killer meta is "just run Ruin" or lose. You don't hear anyone complaining about it.
---
It also doesn’t work on the huntresses hatchets if I’m remembering correctly.
---
*\*kiss\**
---
Once a sabo Jake, always a sabo Jake. It’s an uncontrollable urge
---
Says who 
---
You?
---
And also I'm pointing out what was wrong with your placement logic 
---
Can you please explain how legions ability helps with looping other that geing a almost free hit
---
Not against the demigorgan
---
Why not make it to where it rips his head off I dont understand?? Isnt the game rated M?
---
rip
---
Still she was a balance killer that players said was "too op" and she got about 5 Nerfs making her nearly useless
---
I stopped taking you seriously when you called the Plague OP, and used emojis before spelling nerf wrong.
---
Dying light got a rework, it now gives a 3% penalty to repair, healing, and Sabotage speeds for every survivor you hook that isn't your obsession
---
Very big F indeed.
---
Oh it's autocorrect, thank you a kind person
---
only triggers if you are far away
---
FLAIR CHECKS OUT
---
Yep. Sad oink :'(
---
He definitely roasted you man, you should feel honored and delete yourself my dude!
---
I agree but then again they cant just spit word for word what happened since they seem to want to keep the time frame they left vague so they can add outfits later on I bet.
---
Haha nice so original and hilarious
---
Not nice^^
---
You cut me real deep just now :(
---
I think it's really silly to watch. I don't care whether others do it cuz they're gonna do what they wanna do, but it DOES look utterly ridiculous when you're going for the immersion of the horror story
---
The Demogorgan isn’t its actual name to begin with. It’s a fictional dnd name the kids gave it. That’s most likely the reason they are willing to give it “the Demogorgan” as an ingame name.
---
They are good for being unnoticed hopping into the lockers tho
---
Yes that’s super weird
---
The Ghost Face wants a word with you
---
Taking off our shirts, bout to make these rifle burs.
---
The Shape is what masked Michael Myers is referred to in the actual Halloween script, not something they made up
---
Alright I fixed it up just for you cus ik you think your so good at the game but this is coming from my view playing on ps4 and if you don’t like what I said fuck off no one cares I just want to see if anyone else can relate
---
I’ve heard a lot of talk about how it won’t be now, and it’ll be at a later date since it was never confirmed by BHVR. Don’t get your hopes up, unfortunately.
---
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT. EVEN WORSE IS THEY GET TO RUN WHILE YOU ARE STUCK AT THE GEN AND YOU JUST STAB THE GEN WHILE THEY SPRINT BURST 10000000 MILES AWAY TO EVERY GODDAMN PALLET ON THE MAP. FUCK.
---
Freddy be getting down tho
---
Counter doctor by DCing
---
Lmao
---
Not on the Bubba's face regrettably
---
Please BHVR Ash needs more outfits
---
they'd probably have to go to the actual actor to request permission lol
---
hol' up
---
Demogorgon isn't it's actual name it's what the kids nickname it because they likened their situation to D&amp;D
---
I agree
---
The speed is HUGE in avoiding the killer. I’ve been using it all night and the difference it makes is insane. Hell you can walk around most areas and avoid running a lot more now.
---
* Screenshots highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).

This has to be fucking satire

i think it's moreso do they have the manpower for it.
---
You meming? Or serious?
---
Just browse this sub for 4 minutes, you’ll see about 50 of them
---
Wait why?
---
You can also counter it by disconnecting before the killer gets you to the hook
---
I mean so most cosmetics if you're buying the dlc it's for the characters so getting a extra  cosmetic or two is nice plus yea sure Jeff's may be kinda bad but these two atleast have noticable differences

**HOW CAN ONE FLOWERHEAD BOY BE AT FIVE PLACES AT ONCE**
---
Same
---
Oh boy, another killer that guarantees death if youre last survivor in EGC
---
Yeah no salt but you would think people would’ve seen the hundreds of post about ranks by now
---
let freddy carry a gen over to the exit gates and teleport to it
---
Sadly yes
---
Same for the Basement.
---
Well they got permission to use his likeness so I mean they can do it now if they want
---
mori with new killer on new survivor in first game and done with yellow mori. damn
---
It's far worse. It's what all the discussion was about on the patch notes post.
---
Oh, thats really cool! Thanks!
---
Also I want to add. In the lore death is not am escape and all the killers are abducted. The whole point is to amuse the entity during this hunting game. The killers never get to kill and the survivors never actually survive. So maybe we are both just getting bullied by the entity but we are so focused on being against eachother we dont actually ever escape this hell. We can work together and figure a way out. Almost like rome when they abducted people to fight eachother and entertain the citizens and rich. Thats what we are -_- we needa hold hands and not fight and beat the entity up.
---
It’s spelt “Demogorgon” and the killer is referred to as “The Abyss” in the game so...
---
What about David
---
2018 Myers mask would be dope in game
---
Why would you walk up to them? I never said that
---
Stupid question...but what's PTB?
---
it's not like i said "omg i want to fuck her she's so HOT" like what? plus im gay i just really like pretty women in cool outfits
---
It’s an icon that indicates someone who is a fog whisperer in the DBD community I believe
---
Who mentioned a perk that didnt work? I specifically said the stranger things perks. Learned to read you dumb fuck lmao
---
This is OP and needs nerfed immediately!
---
Also Halloween 2 got retconned with Halloween (2018) anyway

The scratch mark effect is information. It can be used to learn how scratches appear from a better standpoint. 
---
Small game is unnecessary if you're against a majority of killers and you've memorized every totem location.
---

---
Aww billy no mates got no friends himself?
---
With an attitude like yours I’m not surprised nobody wants to play the game with you.
---
Holy fuck no. That show was an insult to the movies.

****HOW COULD YOU FORGET ABOUT BARB****

No problem, happy to help

Take the L almost everyone disagrees with you this may be for you but almost everyone else says otherwise

Learn to use the stain! Knowing when to hide the red light your eyes give can be useful

Doesn’t matter what killer you play against, if they decide to face camp, you’re gonna have a bad game. Leatherface is just best at it.
---
Second, if we aren’t talking Facecamping, leatherface is actually one of the worst killers. So to be blunt, it’s you and you need to improve.

Now we can hit the dab as a survivor. The best timeline.

Oh man dude I would surf for fuckin hours looking for a decent looking character 🤬they make them all like crackheads

Was just a lil bit of sarcasm but sure bud.
---
Dude I gave up on that editor😂😂you can’t make a good character on there
---
Naw man, I hear people complain about it all the time, and rightly so. It is certainly a problem. At least in that case you only have one opponent, since survivors are all the same +- perks. The point I was try to make is that it's unsustainable to have that in place against killers, since there are too many killers to run perks against all of them.
---
