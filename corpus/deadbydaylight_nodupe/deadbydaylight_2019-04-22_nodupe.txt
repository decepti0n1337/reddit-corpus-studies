So you're saying that almost every killer in the game is useless? Why play killer then? The only reason you played legion was to take advantage of exploits and broken add-ons? Was that really the only thing that made him "good" was to cheat the game mechanics so you can cheese the chase and abuse exploits with error in design? I guess now you'll have to get good lile everyone else. Boo hoo so sad. Let me get a bucket for your tears.

2/10 poor attempt
---
Some person decided to t-bag me while I was playing the pig. I t-bagged her then I killed her.
---
NEXT TIME DONT WHACK HTE PALLET
---
You wouldn't survive in a bih map
---
Zzzzz l2troll
---
Gg!
---
Yeah walk away
---
it's all staged
---
Try telling that to all the mediocre PS4 Billies that can’t play without it. Don’t even get me started on NOED Billy.
---
Just played against a legion using the infinite mend glitch. Halfway through the match he dced and I walked away safe and sound with my purple flashlight. Hopefully he'll be banned soon!
---
Right? Entity REALLY didn’t want Claudette getting out
---
i play on ps4 and thank u!!! billy doesnt need any exposed perks, he has!! an instadown!! ability!! i played against a billy with myc??? gosh people on console dont know how to apply pressure
---
Yep. Pretty much everything he said. The only thing I'd add is that with setting up you'll need to prioritize and work fast. Iridescents will help out a lot but the big thing is to spend at least one generator setting up and then work with what you've got. You will still need to be active and apply pressure but be mindful of time no matter what. 
---

---
Here's some advice for where to set traps:
---
• Don't set them beneath Pallets under any circumstances. Survivors are always on alert for trap placements and beneath them and they'll either disarm them or avoid them, which can screw you over. Instead, place them around outside corners before Pallets because survivors tend to hug corners and take the shortest routes to pallets available. They'll get snagged in the middle of the first loop if you can properly anticipate their routing.
---
• Beneath windows, particularly with heavy camouflage or in Michael's house. Survivors will get nervous during the stress of a chase and not anticipate it. 
---
• Around random corners given camouflage, for more or less the same reason given in the first example. 
---
Here's some examples of effective locations:
---
• On either side of the Killer shack pallet. 
---
• Tops of stairs. 
---
•On the Thresholds of door frames and the top and Bottom of the big vault in the Game. 
---
• The Windows and patio steps of Michael's House. 
---
• Along narrow pathways, particularly on Haddonfield or Springwood. 
---
• The Ironworks of Misery Infinite Window and "Catwalk Mines" (Traps that can be concealed at the tops of those stairs). 
---
•The side steps leading into the Temple of Purgation.
---
•Around the corner near the bottom of the basement stairs, and in front of the chest. 
---
• Camouflaged by vaults leading to the exterior of the Coal Tower and Groaning Storehouse.
---
I really wish they would offer the Killer some counter play once the gates have opened. Would it really be the end of the world if Killers could just shut an open gate? Even with the collapse, survivors have three minutes to get the gates reopened and the timer stops when someone is hooked. That’s an eternity, even with blood warden.
---
No, it's a unique and very fun map!
---
*\*Doctor's laughter intensifies\**
---
...most of the time...
---
Idk how good he is but getting the traps to work is super satisfying haha. I’m relatively new to the game but hag almost seems OP? I just put markers next to teleporters and get everyone almost every time
---
He isn't punished for whiffing attacks, like at all. You'd have to 360 him more than once. And people with brains (though I guess, that's not many players) are just going to wait while you spin around. 360s have never worked on anyone competent. 
---
Playing pallets doesn't work. You either wait and try to time it while they're in frenzy, in which case they can just run through and hit you even if you react in time, because this is an online, peer-to-peer game with latency, or you throw it down in hopes they run into it, which doesn't work because they're rewarded for respecting it unlike every other killer. If you don't throw it down, they're so fast in Frenzy that you aren't going to get another loop even if they respect it hardcore. They win in every circumstance provided they aren't about to run out of Frenzy, because they get so much time in it to just wait and see what you do.
---
The last point is irrelevant because we're talking about in a chase, here. No one's arguing that Legion doesn't have shitty map control or actually good game winning potential, and this more relates to that than him actually having counterplay in a chase. You know, the actual fun part of the game where you get to learn mindgames and utilise different skills to outplay people, instead of just hitting QTEs and holding M1.
---
I saw some comment about that a while ago. I think it'd be a lot of fun, honestly. No doubt it'd be absolute chaos. The only issue I have is that connection already is kind of awful with just 5 people (on my ps4, at least) so having 12 sounds like it'd be lag central.
---
I disagree, but eh. My playstyle vs. yours
---
Sure, but your idea of fun gives other players a worse experience in their game, and that's not cool. Be decent.
---
BANG!
---
I  mean, he groans and purrs on lobby and lorewise maybe he knows a word or two. Maybe he's a autodidact ir something, since there's a add on that's basically an instruction to his chainsaw.
---
No one seems to give him enough credit for this affinity towards mechanics even though he supposely dind't recieve any kind of education or social interaction. Poor Billy =\
---
Gotta love throwaway accounts.
---
Yeah that sounds about right. This game has a lot of short term fixes to long term issues.
---
bunny feng... please
---
Right, because FF doesn't increase his speed above the 115% buff he's about to get or anything since he's currently one of the slowest killers in the game right now next to nurse, spirit and Huntress. Right? The update hasn't even gone out and you're already crying over nothing.
---
I might need to find an empty drum because a bucket just isn't going to be enough for your tears.
---
Oh please, shut up.

---
Cause your a liar. Lol.
---
I'm a Billy main so every time I spawn in on Gideon meat plant I want to take my own chainsaw to my eye sockets, but to be fair, that's on me for playing a killer who is situational and can be made an M1 killer on a lot of maps due to his mobility being negated by clutter.
---
Lol
---
/s basically means the post was sarcasm. 
---
I don't really miss with him any more than any other killer, I guess.
---
Well... depends on how merciful I would be I guess.
---
As a killer main I'm putting the game down till mettle can get better balancing tbh cause you can combo it with so many things it literally becomes useless to try and punish a save
---
In the end it doesnt even matter
---
Imagine crouching around and the killer only seeing bright blue bunny ears
---
billy is gay
---
Piggy bugs survivors to play a game with her
---
I used an xbox controller on PC for 1.2k hours, never had any issue wiggling. You just lightly go left and right. No need to mash at the thing. Works just fine. Is it just somehow crappy on the actual console?
---
No one wanted or asked for these changes lbr. The system makes you it so both sides have to do X,Y,Z to pip and everyone thinks that's stupid.
---
You can’t lunge attack it has to be a short attack.
---
I’ve started to play Billy a lot and I haven’t gotten the game yet so I’m lucky
---
Wth? Just put them in a wheelchair at this point, they're gonna run without even standing up lol
---
I was the killer so I have no clue. Made the game *soooo* fun tho
---
Insidious, iron grasp and franklins. I think the survivor has a point
---
I think the same killer would be pretty fun tbh
---
Hag.. I hate going against that ugly bitch
---
I thought the camp penalty is gone once gates are powered. If it isn't, it REALLY should be. I know camping is cheesy but once the gates are powered (or open) you're only option is pretty much camping.
---
an idea i've always had is that there's just a basic version of the perk you buy once then an upgraded version that you have to earn. Like for self care, heal yourself x times with self care and boom now you have a better self care.
---
less RNG progression
---
*"ooh"*
---
Top 10 **bruh** moments
---
I think I my favorite part of this picture is the wire spool on the flashlight lmao
---
equips balanced landing!! Let's goooo
---
I mean if you’re lucky you can, and not every game does noed spawn
---
[removed]
---
I’m down with that, have 2 game modes.
---
What the fuck is going on in this pic lmfao
---
The makeup effects look near professional and the costume is amazing itself
---
yeah, you use Ruin on yours so it's different. i have more of a time crunch
---
Glad you made it fella. Otherwise it will be another two years before it happens again.
---
If i kept the audio in you would here me getting mad at myself for doing that
---
I mean even this is better than adding voice chat.
---
Yup, just 4/4’d by camping ;D
---
I can only assume you're too new to remember how BNPs worked in the beginning. It wasn't an increased repair speed it was an on button.
---
Just DC then lol. Gives them 5k and you can play a real game. If you want max points farming is easy. The only reason anyone tryhards 3v1 is because they're a jackass.
---
Probably just a shroud of seperation /s
---
Thanks! It did help
---
Thats what I said to my buddies saying "Up Leatherface" lol
---
Doc with his ability to cock block vaults/ pallet drops can be incredibly strong
---
But Pig can't do anything until she downs her first survivor. Even going around sneaking slows you down so much.
---
Frenzy GUARANTEES a hit unless you're flat out bad. It's unavoidable in every sense. Then afterwards you get to play as a 115%. In essence you only need to win a single chase against survivors, with the added bonus of stringing multiple injures together very easily if it's a small map and stall everyone at once.
---
You can't really do it "Anywhere at any time". You have to have Self-Care (or another sleeping survivor, or a medkit,) AND already be injured. Typically you don't really get away from Freddy mid-chase. 
---
IMHO dream transition should halt action progress entirely during it. (Once you are asleep, you get the 50% action penalty as usual) 
---
It's not survivors waking up that irritates me, it's survivors popping totems or finishing up a gen literally right in my face that irritates me.
---
Umm no way are they taking me sweet adrenaline what did adrenaline ever do to you besides an amazing speed boost and heal?  Adrenaline is an award for doing your objective "gens"...  
---
Noed is stupid and rewards bad killers.. cant compare the 2.   
---
CLEANSE ALL THE TOTEMS YOU SEE.. STOP BEING LAZY
---
When dedicated servers come this could be an option. Dunno about the state of console DBD atm but I heard it has improved. If that is true there is some leeway to make chaos modes like this. However I do think 10 gens is too much, since multiple killers increases their power and map pressure by a lot.
---
Ruin makes doing even basic gen progress fucking painful for most so it should be taken if only because it makes it easier to kill them all at 4 and 3 gen then the 1 or 0 gens they will be at otherwise. 
---
Like yeah, you can apply a lot of pressure, but it's also just fucking annoying.
---
I love that movie, I quote it quite often. "THREW THAT SHIT BEFORE I GOT INTO THE ROOM" is one of the frequent quotes
---
The result: https://imgur.com/a/lUJqc1I
---
This was definitely the most unfun match I've ever played. Tryhard nurse with mori that slugs
---
I just don't get it. we're the ones bringing the bps's and you go tryhard and you're toxic in the end game chat. I'm not asking you to farm just have a little fun.
---
I'm starting to get a suspicion that BPS breaks my game in a sense that when i see someone offering this, I get kicked out the match. So far it happened 2 times Q_Q
---
Can someone explain this comment, and the replies?
---
That snipe was wonderful! Feel good about yourself random internet human.
---
Hello again!
---
I think freddy's fun with decreased transition add ons or increased speed ones.
---
It’s because they’re insecure about their game having glitches, exploitable things, and anything else that could make them look bad. So they will ban for anything you do wrong even if it’s not your fault like the hag placing a trap under a window causing you to fly.
---
But all the killers are actual people. The Babadook is a monster/abstract being
---
All the congratulations! It looks outstanding!!
---
Trapper is my go to. Lol
---
Was he actually fast
---
https://imgur.com/a/rizHbGm
---
https://imgur.com/a/urf1ckh
---
No I like it just fine
---
I do too.... maybe less traps and she can be bareable.... also that Hex Ruin can be a bitch
---
Yeah. I actually think it increased the charge cause they flashed it like, half the game
---
By playing around his chainsaw efficiently and skillfully. Don’t expect to 360 Billy to death. Find cover and use it when in a chase, force him to M1 hit you. 
---
If you get caught out in the open with zero cover expect to get instadowned by a good Billy. That’s just part of it. Kinda similar to Myers. Always assume he has enough stalk for T3 and play around that.
---
There was one saying how he hasn't done anything to improve the community. Good for you that you missed it.
---
This is kill your friends though no?
---
I believe he was a (very gaudy) Nea.
---
Dude your build is killing you... get rid of botany and selfcare... throw on some adrenaline, and a good exhaustion perk. Not sprint burst tho. Balanced landing and deadhead are better choices. Throw on borrowed time because it's nice for clutch saves or unbreakable for those pesky sluggers. Or even ds for those tunneling twats.  All are way better and help you more than selfcare and botany. Bring a medkit with good addons and you heal super fast.  Or have your teammates heal ya.. that gives them points
---
&gt;People mostly were annoyed by him when he was overly common in high ranks.
---
Basically every game I get is against Billy. Doesn't feel like things have changed.
---
This is the most uninformed comment I've ever heard. You must be a low rank survivor.
---
Hey thanks a lot man! Since posting I have changed my build to nurses, agitation, iron grasp and ruin for basement trapper. Has worked quite well combining that with keeping the three closets gens with the basement and I’ve had 3/4 games where I have 2/3 people in the basement at a time. It’s so fun to chase people into traps, and like the crane on auto haven I’ve been trapping under the window and caught more than I expected from it. I’ve been trying to do like you said and trap around the loops no the pallet, kinda like predicting their path with nurse only setting traps LONG before hand instead of blinking.
---
I'm going into tier 3 here
---
Can confirm this, hooked up with him through Grindr app....then he literally hooked me, would not recommend.
---
Naw just new and yeah I'll tell ya I'm fanning flames but for real new stuff is bs there's no way about it.
---
Is tunneling toxic it's the killer main objective to kill. Gen rushing is like that. It's not toxic it's just frustrating and annoying.
---
i mean im typically at purple ranks?? how is this uninformed
---
Right? Never again would I touch survivor for that I would have a partner to share the burden of whatever outcome of the match and probabily making good laughts/moments
---
This survivor reminds me of Derek Zoolander.
---
I feel you. 
---
I always run resilience and there's always some folks following me around despite me saying in the pre game chat "I have resilience and BT". I hop on a gen and they just stand there bagging to heal me. I get off to point to the gen, they start healing me -.-. GO AWAAAAAY, YOU MEGSQUITO.
---
I did that to a freddy.. fucking glorious
---
Oh shit, you're gonna make me pop tier 3!
---
I have a feeling that your brain poses a mental disorder. I've never stated that i want current legion to stay, i even wrote it in the title that we want a rework. I also said that every other killer has a power helping him to down a survivor, except legion after the nerf. He will be a useless version of the billy since billy can insta down survivors with a chainsaw while legion only can create a timer that doesnt go down aslong the survivor is in a chase/terror radius/mending. 
---
So get your shit together before putting your salt on other people.
---
Just lemme stalk more
---
i usually hang around jungle gyms and t/L walls when i can against billys. and around short/long wall loops, i try to stick super close to walls. when all else fails, run towards them so they back up and rev. surprisingly, it works a bit.
---
Trap protecting a trap. Brilliant 😂😂 I’m not being sarcastic either that is golden. I would totally fall for that as a surv. WHY THE FUCK IS THERE TWO TRAPS 😂😂😂
---
And whats that movementspeed good for when you can't hurt injured survivors or survivors that have been affected by Deep Wound? Yeah right, nothing.
---
So pointing is bad manners.. yall make up new shit every day. Is this let's get offended by everything safe space type of game?
---
Freddy's power slows the game AND helps him find survivors dude
---
Feels bad man
---
Then... Why does the unsportsmanlike report include it? I just wish the devs would have a better system in place
---
Pinhead.
---
It isn’t gay if you say no mither first
---
“Legion, you’re weak. Why? You lack hatred.”
---
If you dont have urban you might as well just stand out in the open and say here I am.. lmaoo
---
If the killer isn't camping then because you're being an asshat by not saving them. Especially if you didn't even check to see if the killer was camping or not
---
Gamertag?
---
I'd just like to try it out lmaoo
---
Iron Grasp is useful all around, Franklins is great for countering gen jockeys and altruistic/toxic-clicking flashlighters, insidious is reserved for either toxic teabaggers or situations where I know the other 3 will swarm the hook
---
Dude you are playing pig you should teabag them back.
---
They don't really have a way to know if the DC was manual or if their internet cut out or smth
---
&gt;at least let them try
---
Fucking why?
---
What would you want to see implemented into the game from him and his world?
---
Idk it’s such a low chance so might as well try
---
Better get used to it. This will happen in a solid 1 in 5 games or so.
---
Some of those times you'll get in though but the guy who fucked up the loading will have left and it'll be a 3v1.
---
How so?? It literally doesnt hender the game what so ever... they put those mechanics in the game so why not use them. I've seen plenty of pigs tbag...
---
Oh wowza no one else agrees lol. Guess i’m just very sympathetic
---
You can't be serious.
---
The only exception would be Legion for that it would be nice having your gang with you, and as much as I know there's a lot of people who would like to be sanduiched by Myers, imagine 2 Myers with infinite tier 3. It would be slugging party. 
---
I dunno though, thoso things should be tested in PTB, should this mode even come out
---
Except that’s not a toolbox, that’s an ammo case! :D
---
Well of course she is, she floats. How can someone who floats not have perfect balance??
---
I mean, it is a purple flashlight, it lasts awhile. I also really doubt a toolbox add on worked for it lol
---
My friend gets booted from matches all the time.he jokes and says I guess my free trial is up guys.
---
camping doesnt hinder the game either? it doesnt slow down any gen progress, the 3 other survivors can do gens and get out. and so ? as you’ve said, its a mechanic , pigs are allowed to teabag.
---
I wouldn't know. I doubt the engine can afford to do anything really fancy.
---
I think it will be Michael and Laurie cosmetics  whatever it is Im excitied 😊
---
Ya that particular bubba in your video seemed like he was still gonna kill you lol
---
I mean, she could have just, you know, killed you
---
I do quite like that idea. Even though I think Adam is a great character, it would’ve been cool to see a terrible and monstrous person like Rins father to be a survivor, to show that there’s a fine line between being a survivor and a good person, and that not all survivors are good guys like Tapp or Bill. Even though David was not that good of a person in lore, considering that he was an alcoholic that loved starting fights, he’s nowhere near as sinister and vile as Rins father.
---
Why is this downvoted?? This is awesome!
---
I like it. I think I'm gonna use this one.
---
got into a game with a moon walking legion, they killed 3 survivors with an ebony mori and when he was about to mori me i DC'd cheating him out of the trophy :)
---
Yep.

Tell me how it goes! By no means am I the best Wraith but having feedback helps
---
Haha this match is lit af!!  That was hilarious to watch...  I love spamming lockers especially when my friend is searching a chest next to it... but I didnt see anything wrong they're out there trying to survive and have each others backs..  
---
Typical killer behavior throwing those damn bottles everywhere 🤨🤨🤨
---
Just like I am to my parents
---
Unrelated but just wanna blast this FREDDY DOES NOT NEED A BUFF! Also no that's normal speed you just got played son.
---
"Looking cool Farifield!"
---
Yeah. I feel really bad for him. Just a disfigured and unwanted child who was locked away.
---
i love this
---
Trapper would be S+ tier
---
These kind of pig players give a bad name to those who are actually good with her.
---
Whoever finds it first, wins. That is literally as balanced as possible.
---
when survivors are in sleepy world freddy can see there auras from far away so it can help him track survivors
---
Rank?
---
If they made this into a window decal without the words I would definitely buy it.
---
What I recommend is pick whichever survivor you want to "main" and by "main" I mean which one you want to never prestige until much later on. Because you lose everything on your character when you prestige, it's nice to have 1 character that you invest into so you have access to all the perks you could want without having to find it again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For example: I have probably around 300 levels worth of BP invested into my Claudette, aside from a few perks I don't have unlocked along side like 2 or 3 perks I just simply don't want, I have everything on Claudette. Meanwhile a lot of other characters I already have prestige levels since I don't need them to have perks.
---
In all honesty though, while you DO get better bloodwebs, it's not much better. I think I heard something about how it's like 1% better per prestige so it isn't very noticed unless you have a lot of prestiges. I know I've seen pictures of people with dozens of prestige levels across their characters that have bloodwebs with a ton of high quality items.
---
R you serious camping hinders the game. One person gets to literally do nothing but be stared at by the killer hindering them from pipping and bloodpoints.. try again with your argument because that was just stupid.
---
Pig mains rise up
---
Right here https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b2c4v5/before_they_were_taken_by_the_entity_unknown/
---
Take my upvote. Run. Save yourself!
---
huge F
---
im gonna repeat, it doesnt hinder the game *in itself*. it doesnt slow down the entire game , it doesnt slow anyone from getting out. just literally do gens and get the fuck out. its not that complicated. back to our main discussion, if you do something unenjoyable to killers, killers are gonna do something unenjoyable to you. :)
---
You use iron grasp to get people to the basement, insidious to camp them. And Franklin's to be an annoying cunt. Yes you are toxic, you have no right to complain about tbaggers and flashlight spammers
---
never expect killers to play nice just because you brought party streamers
---
How does that even happen
---
Why point when you can just run out? That’s what makes it BM.
---
He dosent need a hook or a MORI to kill anyone. He just needs his cuteness and he can kill anybody
---
The Warden from Call of Duty Zombies
---
It's not meant to be a deterrent. Just a name for what they're doing
---
Big brain meg plays!!! We love a smart Megan
---
This dude most definitely bypassed eac and messed around with the Cheat Engine value.
---
I'm honestly not gonna be able to let go of pyramid head. 
---
The vampire would be neat af, the original vampire lore is that they could turn into fog or mist to travel instead of the more modernized bat version, it would work really well in game and would give more use to the thick/less most offerings!
---
Because you don’t download nurse, she’s just in the game, you have to download the huntress chapter separately
---
And of course it’s my rarest achievement lol
---
Hell yeah haha, would be cool
---
i'm aware of that but when they immediately are able to get out of that dream state by messing up a skillcheck, its still a useless power just like Legions.
---
Like how you have Hillbilly and nurse at lvl 1
---
I can hear the Discord convo. “I trapped the shit out of the hatch”
---
 If there's only 1 or 2 gens left then it's still possible to have both of you escape. If the killer is camping then I understand not going for the save because then you'll just be trading hook places and giving the killer more points. If the killer isn't camping then you're an asshole because you're practically making it 100% certain that one of you dies rather than taking that possibility that both of you survive.
---
I camp at endgame since I effectively lost at that point
---
HI JULIET :D
---
Same but when you have Urban Evasion it's the best
---
I face camp teabaggers on hooks. Just because I know they'll rage the hardest.
---
I made 5 killers DC on Saturday morning :) I wasn’t even being toxic, just looped them and kept running in different directions using few pallets to break the blood lust. This all started from 5:30am till 1pm and the last one was a scratched mirror Michael who got run for 4 gens, then decided to DC as I was running out the gates. So yah that made me smile and this was on PS4 lol the second guy DC after hooking us all 2 times each and we had 1 gen to go, and I infinite looped him thru the red Forrest house, then he just stopped and DC, sent me a message saying I sucked and he didn’t play with people who infinite loop, lol okay and he had BBQ and NOED too!
---
Im not ignoring it mate im just not gonna say the same fucking thing that the 103k members of dbd are going to say which is "fix matchmaking bhvr!!!!11"
---
Yeah
---
Youre essentially gambling a great chance at making a safe escape for a low chance at both escaping and a high one of both dying. Doesnt sound worth it to me
---
I assume you are the mentioned toxic survivors that i use Insidious for. If you were *listening*, you would have noticed that I only use Insidious on toxic players, and always hide *outside* the shack, leaving an opportunity to juke me as I come down the stairs, then run away while I'm on cooldown. Camping in the basement for every hook is silly, as it deprives me of my delicious Chili, and I have trouble predicting where the basement will be anyways. And on the subject of Franklin's, I would argue that flashlight users are just as annoying.
---
Huntress seems to have found lady gaga lol
---
The Babadook is a gay icon
---
Pretty sure that wouldn’t work. Besides the clown’s horse, I’m almost entirely sure that the Entity only takes humans into its realm.
---
If you wanna BM better get ready for Camping, tunneling killers. Or you know, stop with the Ochido toxicity
---
no, i was crying, i was trying to do a heart shaope but traps cant be that close soo...
---
Oh no I have to hit someone like any other killer to down them. I can't abuse spam stabbing with Frank's anymore. Waaaaaaaaaah. You're an idiot. Straight up stupid. Survivors don't have invincibility juat because they have deep wounds status active. Get good kid.
---
I thought it said Jake Paul XD
---
Just to see what he looks and sounds like just search up Blood of the Dead Prison Scene and there should be one only a few minutes long.
---
An exploit? XD really?
---
Who do you consider to be toxic? Survivors that loop you for 5 gens? Bet if you got looped for 5 gens you'll still use your insidious camping shit.
---
the irony, doesn't kick anyone out but rather traps them in the arena
---
Will do!
---
Omg those pants are AWFUL what outfit is that from, I need them
---
Yes, because flashlight spamming is on the priority list on things that need to be fixed. The fuck?
---
Why thank you
---
Ahuh
---
Clown since no one plays him also legion
---
Okay then let me ask you this:
---
Are you going to play Legion after the nerf? Because i believe that you've never even played any killer and only mained survivor. Me on the other played both for well over 500 hours and see that by putting another m1 killer into the game with no way of downing a survivor except in breaking every pallet on the map is somehow helping.
---
I mean, what does faster vaulting do when you have to sit through that longass cooldown animation before you are even able to down a survivor? Before you could've used your power to down a survivor if he keeps looping you or just used so many pallets, and even then you got punished because to hit someone 4 times with FF takes half of the games time (well in higher ranks to be sure).
---
over MULTIPLE pixels crouching up and down\* and people going click click click with their flashlight
---
Gonna be honest: I work weekends. Typically have Monday and Tuesday off. Means I miss the lion’s share of most of these bonus weekends. And I’m still annoyed they didn’t have one.
---
imagine being so salty over flashlight clicking and t-bagging. just tunnel the shit out of them and facecamp
---
You could make a match take ages. I once had to play for an extra 20 minutes because 2 Jakes broke all hooks and the basement was on the center of the map. They'd go to the edges and I wouldn't be able to get to the basement fast enough
---
Consider this, why would i spend my time trying to deceive some redditors with my post. There's really nothing to gain from it
---
Still soft
---
I would too bucko and I guarantee you’d eat that grass, that’s why I’m offering.
---
I suggest you try technician, imo it's an underrated perk
---
I do use Adrenaline lol comes in handy during end game looping. Also I use botany for healing ppl (I like to heal as much as possible and it helps get heals over quicker). 
---
Usually I switch back and forth between Sprint burst and dead hard tho just to make it a lil different each round. As for balanced I tend to not run it much cause of flat maps like cold wind. Sometimes it can be difficult to find a spot to jump down. 
---
As for Borrowed Time, I usually only use it in solo since my friend usually plays with me and has it. She's usually the one who unhooks as I do gens and heal ppl.
---
Yeah I use DS every so often but some killers are smart and wait it out before downing u again.
---
The world sucks because of people like you.
---
So basically its
---
\-Not Scared
---
\-The edgy bois ™ 
---
\-The people on their phones or staring at the wall
---
\-The babies
---
\-The assholes loudly snackin on their food through the dialog.
---
Is that directed at me? Geez I don’t get it. Everybody has to be nice and circle jerk, nobody can criticize someone else being a crybaby or gloat without being “toxic”.
---
So if I wanna (bad manners?) get ready for camping? That doesn’t make sense to me. I probably have it wrong.
---
did it actualy work
---
The Reason Why We Were Down There Is My Teammate Got Unhooked Then He Trapped Him There
---
\+1 to bring this to the attention of the devs
---
Must be a PC only issue I’ve never had this happen to me ?
---
*Bubba noises intensify
---
I read the post-game chat. I didn’t think to look at the load out or anything
---
Thanks for the info! That's actually pretty cool, I never knew that before.
---
YoU CaN't EvEn SpElL pLaGuE rIgHt WhAt A lOsEr AmIrItE 😂😂🙄🙄🙄😎😎👌👌
---
EVERY TIME!
---
he has the right idea but i think it's a bit too much, i had an idea that for flashlight clicking if you do it a lot, then the flashlight malfunctions and cannot be used for a few seconds and also loses a bit of its charge, as for the teabagging, if you do it a lot, you crouch slower and slower with each crouch just like in CSGO
---
Lit 😱🤟🏾
---
Yeah, they were crouching as fast as they would sprint. They did it the entire game which made it hard actually hit them in chases
---
19
---
true
---
10/10 would click my flashlight toward the killer again
---
Bruh Dwight OP
---
Bruv it's killer it's gonna kill people not snog Dwight this has nothing to do with the LGBT legit no one cares about a characters sexuality
---
Na, you're not the only one n never seen.
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
The answer is, if she had STAYED ON IT the killer would have likely just PULLED HER OFF. Then they will either hook, or drop her on the ground and let her bleed out. (Because a killer that is this level of fucking petty to get a kill would likely slug everyone and leave them to die just to be rude. It’s cunty. It makes people not want to play. It IS abuse of game mechanics and is the epitome of toxicity. As a survivor main I’m usually the first to fall out other toxic survivors. But killers are just as fucking bad too. And I’m so sick of this subreddit condoning this behavior and excusing it like it’s ok. Want to know why the game is going to shit? PEOPLE LIKE THIS IS WHY.
---
Dang gotta say just looked back at all your other dbd cosplay. Gotta say still killing it. 🤔🤫absolutely no pun intended. Barely caught that. Keep it up. Do you ever play survivor game, sorry If i assume you just play killer cause of the cosplays
---
is that canon? where was that confirmed?
---
It’s probably gonna be the freddy rework details or some new cosmetics. 
---
I doubt it would be a new character since we just got ash, they also would probably want to see how the community reacts to the freddy change so they can change some things before it goes on the ptb.
---
OK, by this logic, killers who walk a player over to the hatch only to hook them anyway or sit in your face and swipe at you or "face dance" while you die need to chill out too, though.
---
Are you one of those guys who says "nobody cares" whenever an LGBT character is announced in a game?
---
Yh because no one cares

Platform: PC

Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: I dropped a pallet down at a Spirit w/ spirit fury who was carrying a survivor. Killer remained unfazed and proceeded to hit me. Afterwards I asked the killer, they were confused aswell.
---
You can make all the assumptions that you want to on whatever side I "main" or don't "main" but the fact remains I have over 3k hours put into this game with a 50/50 split down the middle. I play whatever side I feel like it. 
---
You've made your mind up about this update that buffs him while also removing exploits associated with him and his add-ons and calling it all a nerf. Why don't you wait until the update before you cry like a baby. There's no point talking to you. Honestly, look at the downvotes you're getting and none of them are even from me. Idc about internet points. But the fact you've been downvoted on everything you've said should tell you something here.

Thats good or bad for me?

I don't get how the title correlates with the post
---
Re...real...really... yy...uo love me...??
---
I forgot the add on names but the one that decreased the timer and the one that adds a box work well together. Additionally rule set number 2 can be used as a replacement. If you only want kills then u can patrol the boxes, but this isn’t really viable and can cost you sacrifices.
---
yes 😍😍😍😍
---
Because I wanted to know if the killer had Iron Maiden locker perk. I ended up waiting 10 or so minutes to find out, but I was afk at the time so I wasn't able to ask the killer how he knew I was there. Hope that makes sense
---
Totally agree, I also suggest that if a survivor runs for a certain time they should have their legs cut off and be instantly teleported to the killers shoulder, also make it so that generators go back to 0% repair after 3 seconds of not being touched by a survivor and have Ruin not be a hex perk. With these changes the game MIGHT be balanced imo.
---
I think he DC'd.
---
Well typically it’s frowned upon to act without manners. That’s not a new thing. 
---
All I’m saying is you shouldn’t be surprised when you tbag/emote at the other end of a pallet and get camped while on hook. Then tunneled if you get off.
---
Absolutely genius
---
RIP
---
A reminder that Anna has the mind of a fucking 6 year old
---
Fuck you and your "facts"
---
You got adept legion. Is that supposed to be hard or something?
---
I can’t. This spirit was camping all game and I’m not letting her get all of us. Also I want those 5k bloodpoints. I don’t care if I have to wait and hour for it, I’m gonna get them.
---
1) No one runs insidious aside from camping bubbas.
---
2)Cleanse totems because NOED doesn't activate if totems are all cleansed.
---
3)VC doesn't protect you granting you immunity but it removes blind, substitutes for bond, knowledge of who is in chase which normally is only known out of vision if they are the obsession, and grants a large amount of coordination advantage. Removes the immersion factor too.
---
bUt iTs A lEgIT sTraTEgY
---
Also, the Babadook is gay
---
Insidious pig
---
Each time a survivor searches a box, they have a 50% chance to remove their helmet. This means the best way to get rbt kills is to pressure someone already helmeted off of boxes...and get a little lucky.
---
I mean face camping is shitty, don't get me wrong, but he's right.
---
Your just crying cause you lost, it's just a game man, move on to the next round an try again.
---
My current build is Head on, Quick and quiet, DS, and Mettle of man.  Very fun solo survivor build.
---
Mettle is old ds in chase extending, its amazing for buying time, DS is extra protection.  Both make me the obsession usually, which allows me to give my team info when being chased.  Head on NEEDS Quick and Quiet to be used mid chase, but Q&amp;Q allows me to do vault mind games (especially at LT walls)  
---
Ill probably take off Mettle but atm its too good as a solo survivor.  They should change it tho that if you aren't the obsession you entered borrowed time state when hit.
---
But i like this meme'y "fight back against the killer" build, i just want more info on how head on works. It's easily the most fun exhaustion perk to use, even if its super wonky on when it works.
---
fail a skill check then run for hatch
---
&gt; I still don't know why you're being so aggressive.
---
I'm actually not. You're just being thick headed and it's irritating to try explaining something so simple to someone as dense as you.
---
&gt; with no game changing power 
---
I actually play pig. She has no "game changing power" either and I can 4k in under 4 minutes with her in most instances. I have video to prove it as well. That's besides the point. The point is the power doesn't need to change the game. Legion is meant to slow the game down just the same as pig does. It takes time to mend. It takes even more time to heal ever since the self care nerf that survivors got. You're not always going to find someone to heal you and they're not always going to when they do see you. What a shame, you'll actually have to learn how to run loops and mindgame as a killer. You say legion is just "another" mindless m1 killer now. He always has been. Literally nothing is changing.
---
&gt; further down the tier list of killers 
---
You actually believe in tier lists? LUUUUUUL First off, those are subjective as any killer can be "S" tier in the right hands. Tier lists are opinion based. People might think pig is low tier. To me and in my hands, she's god tier. Survivors are at my mercy all of the time. I literally suck with other killers because I don't play them. Not because they're bad killers to use in some imaginary tier list that someone made based on opinion.
---
&gt;  even below Freddy 
---
Freddy is on a level all of his own because of how slow he is and how useless his power is over survivors and his inability to do anything to survivors outside of the dreamworld which in of itself is a joke since you can run around a loop and pop a skillcheck with self care right in front of him. That's why he is useless. Anyone saying anything in this game is Freddy "tier" and it not actually being freddy is about as intelligent as the snot that I blow out of my nose when I'm sick.
---
&gt; his abusable power just made him broken and annoying to play against 
---
Which is why he is being fixed and getting a speed buff but you're still calling it a "nerf."
---
&gt; So instead of being a salty survivor main 
---
Really? Because I have a brain and use it I must be a "main" of anything you disagree with. sure thing buddy.
---
&gt; i mean the fact that he now has a useless power 
---
What's useless about it? Upon hitting someone anyone within your new 32m TR will now light up, pop distressing in your build and boom, you can see where anyone is at within almost a 50m radius around you. It's a free BBQ that's active longer than actual BBQ is. What can possibly be useless about that? It also wastes survivors time if you lose them or if you decide to break the chase off to focus on something a little more important.. you know, putting pressure on gens, They're forced to now mend AND heal because you're not super slow like before. You move as fast as trapper now and 115% killers are a little on the hard side to loop and run IF you don't know what you're doing. If they do know what they're doing then you can mind game them and run loops. Legions power is now going to be like spirits with the upsides to pigs time wasting for survivor. What is so fuckin bad about that?
---
That’s what they all say!
---
I tried that. There was a gen near it but she just turned so now she can see the gen, and she’s a spirit and can pull me off.
---
Do charged hatchets only travel faster or is there some other sort of buff as well?
---
And yet, this update would probably have less bugs than the updates we’ve been getting...
---
Still at it?
---
I would say run The Hillybilly with Brutal Strength, Spirit Fury, Enduring, and Ruin. If you can unlock those perks
---
You make a good point. Kinda wish there was a balance between the two. Steam makes it so that you can't private msg until you're friends, but you can chat with other dead people who are in SWF in the death lobby.
---
Yep, she’s not as patient as me.... hopefully
---
as far as lore goes hes just a massive bastard but not necessarily evil, all his perks revolve putting yourself at risk to help others (distracting the killer with longer chases). 
---
even though people love to defend billy and wraith they did still kill people - david's never gone that far, he just likes a punch up
---
It's unneeded there is no need to bring sexualities and gender politics into games unless it affects gameplay. Btw the only reason they made soldier 76 gay is so everyone stopped slagging them off and escape media criticism
---
Is there an achievement for the trap killing somebody? It’s dirty but I can see that being a hard achievement to unlock legitimately.
---
dwight and claudette as killers - new chapter 'revenge of the nerds'
---
It's fucking toxic
---
Let me know how it ends, I wish you luck if you're sticking it to her camping style.  (If only because I'm salty about three consecutive Spirit campers earlier today)
---
That's a really silly attitude to have.
---
Enjoy your game.
---
With the Pig nothing causes more DCs than if you teabag them back after downing them even tho they were doing it non stop until they were downed.
---
The point of this post was the reason he was facecamping, not that he facecamped
---
This looks PHENOMENAL. I’m obsessed and inspired!!!! You snapped sis. Adiris was served
---
This post was made by Amanda Gang
---
Did you report them?
---
Feel ya. Sometimes - like... a fucking lot - the people in this game are making me incredibly mad. :P Doesn't matter which side you play, someone always wants to be the dirtbag.
---
The small parts are very annoying to print on a vinyl cutter
---
Come back in an hour. I’ll still be here.
---
I will. I’ll beat the dirty campers for us all!
---
I mean it was only two survivors left, and this is a quite hilarious way to finish someone off. The alternative was just downing them and throwing them on a hook to die when they got helped off.
---
I don't understand why people send hatemail. No one's mind is going to change and you're not going to learn anything. Just move the fuck on to the next match.
---
The engame is so biased to killers it's not even funny...

Personally I think that end of season rank rewards would serve to cut down on DC’s more than people would expect. There’s no magical way to completely stop it. People will always do it, no matter the penalty or potential rewards for not doing it. But if there was a way to pick up a nice bounty of bloodpoints and shards, or even exclusive cosmetics sometimes, then especially in the second half of the month just before rank reset a lot of people would be pushing forward just to try and get to that next rank and next set of rewards. You could still quit, but it’ll knock you farther away from something you may really want. Those that don’t care will always be around, but I think it would lead to a lot less DC’s if there was a reason to keep ranking up. 
---
Maybe I’m wrong, but I’d really like to see the effects that rank rewards would have on DC’s and just the general enthusiasm and health of the game in the long run. After that point, I would discuss bans, as DC’ing could be ruining other people’s chance at rewards by doing it. Or introducing both at the same time even. I dunno. 
---
TLDR; give us rank rewards nao, we’ve waited long enough. It’s something to work for and may cut down on the overwhelming apathy towards rank
---
Holy shit ur a genius.
---
It really do be like that sometimes.
---
Which ones are good other than BBQ?
---
Juts started playing her as well a few days ago. She is definitely a fun killer to play as, I can see her being my new main. What build are you currently running with her?
---
Same, I want to collect as many Ebonys as I can on Myers, as many Tombstones, and Tufts of hair, post my numbers, and get 7 upvotes.
---
Pig's power has been incredibly terribly designed since release.
---
The only reason this isn't a bigger issue is because Pig isn't good/prevalent. Otherwise, she should be bitched about just as much as Legion has been.
---
The only killer who's happy to be pallet teabagged
---
Enduring shits on Head on but i still use it anyways. Doesnt matter if they got an indicator. If they dont realize the locker is what stunned then theyre actually mentally challenged
---
Lol im bad with body postures, still practicing, pretend you didn’t see it :3
---
Bamboozle and Lithe are good. Boil Over is not.
---
Yes babe, that literally what i feel, i playing legion just because i can run after peoples stab them to death with multiple stabs, i was new at this game in december, and after seen that peoples complaining bad about legion havent touch him i guess till february, but when i did, i found that it was fun for me to play him, and after nerfs revealed, i was like what the hell, he is not even overpowered, i know about exploits and moonwalking, but why not just fix it, why peoples like me enjoying playing him have to lost enjoyeble character, better look after omega blink nurses and how enjoyeble to play against this nurse, but i guess its fine and fair i guess
---
I got an idea. Try to do a gen far away from her ??
---
Lol 500 is already a lot for me! Appreciate:3
---
hm :/ thats what I fear.  I would say buff Head on's stun like DS but DS also had the survivor jumping off the killers back, which made enduring stronger.  Ill test it more but it's probably fine the way it is.
---
Appreciate! This is the first time I’ve try this, ill do more in future
---
Well, that sucks. Killer DC'd only once today, but I am pretty sure it wasn't his fault.
---
I once got a hatch interrupt with a Phantasm trap and it was the greatest feeling.
---
Thanks for your like! Yah she seems to be a innocent girl before taken, so i guess i shall do something to present that
---
Lol same! Thanks for your like! (and heart❤️
---
Dude btw
---
Yes, i was inspired by Amanda &amp; Pig contrast, that was rly cool idea too
---
Also blizzard hinted at Soldier 76 being gay since the first Christmas event so don't act like they all of a sudden chose to make him gay like HiRez did with Fernando in Paladins.
---
Me against spirit or legion
---
I would try and get an an exhaustion perk. Lithe is probably one of the best ones (makes you sprint at 150% your movement speed for a few seconds after vaulting a pallet at the cost of 40 to 60 seconds). 
---
I would also get We’re Gonna Live Forever (David perk) to maximize your BP gains.
---
So you think that Bubba and Michael are op to?
---
you could have gotten another game and received your 5k bp by the time this ends
---
Yes, then we can start with 4 No Mithers and leave even more no blood, whilst starting sacrificed
---
Did it work?
---
Wait.. no fucking way this is back, right?
---
...RIGHT?
---
Lol her father should be a killer at some aspect. Yah i shaped her more innocently instead of darkness and cruelty. She is not that violent in the lore so i tried to keep her as a cutie:3
---
Looking forward to it
---
Low tier Mori looks like it's disappointed in itself.
---
He assaulted a referee because he was salty he lost the match.  Pretty much sums up every last survivor I play with when NOED activates.  I’m a survivor main btw.  Also David was really spoiled too, right?
---
Really? just self promoting your twitch off of a screenshot of a bug that was mentioned a million times on this sub already?
---
Hopefully the do add cooldowns to DC's (30mins,2hours,24hrs,1week) like in csgo.
---
sKiLl
---
Right. And what rank are you playing at? Couldn’t even see the video, btw, just heard the audio.
---
It does work, this was a bug in December 2016 (along with a lot of other wonky shit like invisible Myers with a Chainsaw stacking Bond perks for infinite wallhacks).
---
1 "charge" on a Flashlight = 1 second, so a spool adds 30 seconds to a flashlight. 
---
You could also do bullshit like stack Lightweight so you would never leave scratchmarks. Imagine being blinded at every pallet, then the survivor running off with no scratchmarks.
---
If this is back we have a severe problem. Last time the devs all went on vacation right when it was shown by a large streamer how to do it, so it ran rampant for 2 weeks before they came back and fixed it.
---
We're gonna live forever, just not you.
---
That is what i was talking about
---
I've seen toxic, and I've seen this. He carried on for a long time, pretty sure he was trying to trigger the killer, I acted like I'd left and watched it all unfold. 
---
Huge Y I K E S from me
---
But how does he BM outside the wall?
---
Go on the character select screen and hit right on the dpad (not sure what this would be for PC) on a Survivor/Killer. It will bring up their bio and teachable perks, if the perk has checkmark next to it then means you own the teachable.
---
Still waiting
---
Lithe I'm pretty sure only works on windows.
---
I suggest getting we're gonna live forever from David ASAP then getting lithe from Feng. 
---
If you don't usually get chased I would suggest getting prove thyself before lithe if you usually do the gens.
---
Right, lol. Camping doesn’t take any skill, that’s why it’s a start that really only works when 1, the survivors play like idiots, or 2, you’re playing at the low ranks. Rarely ever does it work at the higher ranks.
---
The game is really tough if you don’t have the DLC survs and killers. The only thing you really can do is wait for shrine, or cave and by dlc. 
---
Now if you only like playing Survivor, you can buy the survivors for $5 each or 9k Iridescent shards (Unless They’re from a movie/tv show. 
---
Just how DBD is. They need money and we need balance

Damn, you got me.

How do I remove someone else’s post?
---
Hello, killer who likes making games fun here.
---
It’s not that it’s a bad strategy, it’s that it isn’t fun. Staying on the hook all game isn’t fun. Sitting there as killer isn’t fun either. The chase is why people play the game. By camping, you completely remove the fun element of the game.
---
No it works on pallets too.
---
It does work surprisingly often tho...
---
I've seen some people post that they don't care about other players fun. That the game isn't supposed to be fun, they don't care if they ruin it for others. It's just toxicity.
---
Adrenaline is top tier (Meg). Most of the exhaustion perks are good. If you feel like you are always getting pulled off the hook right in front of the killer and going down because of it you can get decisive strike (From Laurie. Shes in the Halloween chapter)
---
Yes, at the *lower* ranks, which is no surprise at all.
---
really funny video, like I honestly had to laugh :D
---
no, at Red ranks....
---
That's the passive effect of deliverance, "When you have this perk, always be found first."
---
it was between that one and ["Sure, Jan"](https://i.imgur.com/IbPGYG0.gif). i thought JLawrence worked better :p
---
I have a few problems...
---
You were hella toxic for no reason and judging by the comment you made, you are, indeed, a toxic player
---
You lucked out this game and got dumbass survivors
---
You wouldn't pip from this in ranks... probably green and up
---
Facecamping isn't a valid strategy because it's a shitty thing to do and there's noting worse than playing survivor and just sitting there on the hook, looking at a killer who is looking at them
---
Facecamping takes no skill, it's literally standing there, confirming your kill, an ape could do that.
---
That's all the reasons why I find this post downvote worthy, you can downvote this and tell me to kill myself all you want, it doesn't take away from the fact that I am correct, if you would like to try to actually place a valid arguement to any of these points I will gladly take a look and respond. Have a good day and pleade change your toxic ways.
---
Thats why if they get close i just stop so they cant pull that sneaky shit on me, miss me with those grabs

Nah fool goes to cry in the corner and contemplates why the heck he’s always the last one. Tough life ain’t it
---
so you intentionally fucked over your teammate .... lmao garbage
---
Nah. I doubt that very much.
---
What next? 
---
When the killer hook someone he goes to the another side of the map? ( No camp)
---
When someone is unhooked the killer cant hit this survivors again until he hook another one? ( No tunneling)
---
When survivors drop a pallet, they will have the status "a little bit tired" so they cant vault windows or run normally.  ( No loop)
---
Remove all perks, post chat, swf.
---
Killers dont kill anymore, they are looking for new friends.

Friends by daylight.

Try reading. Looks like it’s about a fifth grade reading level so it may be a little hard for ya. It says bodyblocking is not bannable, holding the game hostage is (which would be bodyblocking someone in the basement with no way for them to escape besides disconnecting), trapping someone somewhere who has a rbt on is not holding the game hostage because that survivor has a timer on which they are alive and will die sooner or later
---
Wasn't her father the one who killed her? To me it wouldn't make any sense to make him the survivor.
---
Listen, I'm quick to leave a MF in the basement to die.
---
The problem is random disconnects are a thing, which is entirely the game’s fault.
---
I will say today I’ve been getting booted from the game more often than usual. My screen will freeze and then all the sudden I’m at the ending screen of the match but no one else DCed. Makes me wonder how many people are just getting booted by no choice of their own. But other than that yeah it’s pretty irritating when people DC intentionally, I never understood it bc even if I’m getting tunneled/camped I’d rather die and get some points than none at all.
---
She's only level seven right now but I like Rancor and Hex; Haunted Grounds I'll def look into getting my normal perks on her; 
---
Iron grasp and Brutal Strength, maybe Overcharge and NOED just cus it can come in handy
---
As a camper, trust me, it does.
---
Nah.
---
It actually is consistent. The entity changes people into mad versions of themselves that lose their humanity over time. So typical survivors actually turn into killers as they experience more and more endless trials.
---
Can I join as Jurassic Park?
---
It also means you’re basically admitting to being a pretty shit killer.
---
I didnt actually go near him when he was hooked. I really think he mistook me for some other survivor but I wasn't gonna cry about it
---
There are multiple addons that are good. You could go with the addons that put a status effect on a trapped survivor, you could go with tampered timer to add extra anxiety, but my favorite combo is Slow-Release Toxin and Last Will. Trap as many survivors to make chases easier without exhaustion perks.
---
Tampered timer and jigsaw's annotated sketch( I'm talking about the purple one) on a big map they'll just die if they aren't lucky
---
It might just be. You can kinda tell. If they don’t move for a few seconds, like they stop wiggling or something and then suddenly dc, then yeah, it was intentional. The pause in movement is usually them fiddling with the menu for a couple seconds to click the disconnect button. 
---
But again, random disconnects are a thing. I’ve been disconnected at the loading screen. I’ve been disconnected while opening the exit gate. I’ve been disconnected five seconds into the match, and a few times I’ve been disconnected while picking up survivors as a killer.
---
It’s either wannabe toxic survivors or people who feel entitled enough to screw over everyone else by being so unsportsmanlike
---
I’m not camping to “secure a kill”, I’m using people as bait. There’s a difference in the intent between camping to make sure someone stays dead because you’re not a good player, and camping in hopes that someone takes the bait to get easier kills.
---
Man I’m glad I’m skilled af and only out of the 20 or so games I played the last two days, less than 5 people got away.
---
But no one's getting facecamped in these games. Nothing scummy or out of the ordinary is happening. Survivors are just giving up on first chase and it's not making any sense to me.
---
I hope so. I need to see if I wanna buy Kate's new stuff or if it's actually as awful as the leak looked (in which case I'm picking up some Wraith stuff lol).
---
How so? What skills does it require?
---
It's so pointless when they D/C after their first getting downed. Not doing their team *any* favors. Just helping the killer at that point.
---
Yeah it’s just people being fucking telly clappers
---
Why didn’t you just finish the rest of the gens? Does she has Prayer Beads?
---
Probably Trapper or Myers. They both have a very straightforward power and it isn’t too difficult to understand. They aren’t horribly bad either. A good Trapper will fuck you up and Myers is a scary motherfucker.
---
that’s when you go do gens
---
Nah. Once you camp, you’re letting everyone else know that you’re a pile of hot garbage who doesn’t know how to play killer very well. Also, noed on Bubba, lol. 
---
The only reason I imagine you even got this kills (and again, I doubt you’re really playing at the red ranks) is that you clearly weren’t playing against particularly competent survivors. So don’t be too proud, because you’re still pretty shit, as you’ve so willingly demonstrated.
---
&gt; When the survivors are swf and do everything right, most killers aren't getting any kills since that is how the game is made. 
---
That's because killers are making mistakes. I make mistakes still and it will cost me the chase. I say hey "I fucked up" it's not the survivors fault. you blame SWF for the downfall of every killer as if they're some godly presence in the game. They're not. 
---
Traps being frustrating? lol. Only against bad pigs that tunnel the 1 trapped survivor. It's a cakewalk and a minor inconvenience since I would rather be doing anything other than searching those boxes for a key. I wouldn't call it game changing at all.
---
&gt; boring ass m1 killer which requires you to have no brain survivors in your game. 
---
Are you sure about that? Because there's not many that are "brain dead" unless they're new to the game or just don't participate in chases and stealth everywhere. Those are easy downs. I look at this game as a game of chess or a RTS when I play killer. You have control of the chase the whole time. The only thing you don't have control over are pallets. Either eat them or waste time respecting them every 2 seconds. However, you do have control over where the chase goes and not a lot of people know that or think of it. You can corral your survivor to anywhere on the map you want them to be in a lot of situations. go wide in the chase and cut them off to make them not want to go towards you or that one direction you want to corral them to. It doesn't take any longer to do than chasing them normally. You thinking legion is only viable because of his frenzy is making you a very poor killer in terms of map control and pressure because he has none. It's time to learn some new tricks instead of abusing exploits.
---
We're at an impasse because you can't see the bigger picture behind the changes. I think it's a very healthy change for the game in terms of gameplay and balance from both sides. 
---
So onto the next question.
---
&gt; Would you play the Legion after the update?  
---
I don't play him now because he's broken as fuck. He's not fun to play, I couldn't give a single fuck about fast vaulting windows and pallets as a killer. Especially since a lot of the pallets on the maps aren't safe to loop on. After the update? Hell yeah I'll play me some legion and I won't DC anymore when I see one as a survivor. I won't have a reason to because there's going to be some counterplay to him and it's going to make the game a lot more fun. I can't wait for the update and give him another try.
---
r/clarification
---
K then I still definitely suggest we're gonna live forever to boost your blood point allocation by a bit, but I definitely suggest lithe afterwards as it will help you in more situations than prove thyself. If you find that you really enjoy using lithe I suggest getting quick and quiet right after, so you can more easily escape chases by breaking line of sight.
---
Lithe is found on Feng lvl 35
---
Quick and quiet is on Meg lvl 30
---
We're gonna live forever is found on David lvl 30.
---
Yes that is it genius. I'll give you a award for that.
---
Why don’t you just hook the spirit
---
Mad man
---
Time to just leave em on the floor! Did they have a bleed out timer then though? I didnt play then.
---
You posted a video of yourself playing like a piece of shit and decided to try to brag about your skill when people called you out on it.
---
If you consider anything in this video to be skillful, you’ll never make it above green ranks.
---
For real, he’s acting so proud, like he actually did some shit 😂 camping takes no skill whatsoever. If he did indeed play at the red ranks (doubt it) then he was probably playing against swf groups who cared more about saving their friends than winning. 
---
All in all, any killer who facecamps is openly admitting to themselves that they’re too garbage to actually play any other way.
---
downvoted because of your annoying attitude
---
Plus even killers think it’s dumb because they can’t get bonus blood points from more hits and stops the progression of useful perks like thanatophobia and devour hope
---
Hate speech is absolutely looked at, filing a report for it will result in escalating ban punishments.
---
Note what they do and do not accept reports for. (For example, report for hateful speech, don't report for disconnecting)
---
uh.... ok
---
Dwight teachable perk bond works well if you are more of a solo player rather than a SWF player
---
The achievement is to put on 125 traps, none related to killing with the traps
---
Alright boys... I failed you all. She juked my ass hard and phase walked behind me and I don’t see the red stain. She grabbed me and I couldn’t even text her afterwards because it’s PS4 and she had messaged off.:
---
You are a bad guy...
---
 but you are not a ***bad*** guy
---
I always stack the Z block and Unicorn block. The paint brush is nice but 110% on an already bad killer is too much.
---
It's definitely well above half my games in the past few days that have had at least one DC.  It's out of control.  As killer, I've had multiple games where all 4 DC (when caught).
---
If you DC intentionally, there should be some punishment.  Not severe- maybe BP penalty?
---
I reported in game but that link says:
---
&gt; "Whilst you can report offenses directly to our support, please only do so for serious offenses like cheating, hacking, DOX/death threats."
---
I was prepared to be outraged. Then you ran into a wall. Then you kept restarting the sequence. Then you didnt run to another box. Then you died and I cheered for the killer because god damn.
---
Oh ffs NOED is balanced, stop gen rushing and do the totems and it won’t even activate. At least give an effort to try to prevent NOED. It’s fine as is, just get good.
---
Injured Dwight? Is that some sort of cosmetic I don't know about?
---
I don't find it so bad, speed doesn't really matter for my build with M&amp;A because no terror radius means I can just break chase and juke them
---
Gosh darnit sorry guys.... just felt good to have someone looking at me for a change 😓.... 😂
---
&gt;NOED rewards skill because it rewards you for winning a chase after it activates. You can't use it effectively unless you win chases. Therefore, NOED requires skill.
---
Are you genuinely having trouble understanding what I am saying? Because it sure isn't this. I have NO clue why you are talking about a scenario after the perk activates.
---
&gt;Your argument is that MoM is skillful because you can win the chase (by losing the killer) after it activates
---
Quote anywhere where I called Mettle of Man skillful. Quote anywhere where I said anything about a scenario after it activated. Stop using a strawman and address my points. ***To aquire*** Mettle of Man, it promotes helping teammates by soaking hits for them or losing the killer in a chase so that you can heal safely and go back to take another. If you end up failing your chases, you won't get to properly use the perk comfortably. The scenario after it is actually activated by the killer's hit has nothing to do with this.
---
to activate NOED, you must fail applying pressure to the generators. To activate MoM, you must successfully get the proper M1 hits during chases/soaking hits for teammates and then win those chases by evading the killer. 
---
My point is that this requirement promotes better gameplay than NOED does because you get it done doing your objective properly. Keep fighting random strawmen and quoting the word "skill" despite me never saying it, though.
---
Thank you for the information though. Definitely helps. A lot.
---
Bro don't talk to me with your 1 side of the argument mentality. It's not against the rules but it's scum. I play killer so much and if someone dc's I don't fucking tryhard and instadown people after being unhooked. so chill tf out.
---
After the Legion update DCing became semi-sanctioned by the community due the Legion in general. Afterwards the ranking system was blasted so people didn't care about rank anymore. So you had a good amount of people who were emboldened to DC and were not punished and maybe even in their eyes rewarded for doing so by being able to face easier killers. With this subset of people dcing so often it started a chain reaction where people would see others DC often and then it would become "okay" for them to do DC and so on. So now we're in a place where people DC if just the slightest thing goes wrong in most games.  
---
It became such an issue that the devs had to remove the pip punishment for DCing as people with tons of hours were getting down to rank 15 and being paired with new players.  
---
For those of you who tough out a match even after multiple DCs or Suicides you're my hero and if I could I would give you more bloodpoints &lt;3
---
I wonder if you could stack 4 resilience's together to get a 36% bonus to everything...
---
Same
---
I honestly wasn't expecting such a nice match tonight
---
Yes I feel that I'm correct about everything.
---
You're welcome.
---
good
---
People can speculate and give their own ideas on why though. I mean we should have more maps the map rotation gets very stale.
---
me, that claudette: hello friends and family how are you i came home but im too big for you guys
---
4/4 all day everyday. Not dumb, pro. Get gud kid.
---
*toxic*
---
yeah I think that's the worst I've seen so far lmao
---
Quick someone post me to /r/madlads
---
Ahaha I barely notice it, maybe it's because I get about 20fps so the whole game is already terrible
---
 “Legion’s base movement speed is increased.” That’s good.
---
“Legion’s terror radius has been increased to 32 meters.” That’s not good. **Why is that not good? Expanded TR means longer tracking and knowledge of where other survivors are or are going to be going. Tracking is a good thing for all killers. Why is this bad?**
---
“Feral Frenzy takes longer to recharge and now requires a full a full bar to use.” That’s bad. **Why is it bad? You already stated that hitting them again in FF doesn't reduce their mend timer. Why would you need to use it again right away unless you were using it as some sort of instant BBQ while in a chase? Makes no sense. 🤷‍♂️**
---
“Feral Frenzy lasts longer but is significantly slower.” That’s … neutral at best. He’ll probably have the same range but be more susceptible to speed bursts (which he was already susceptible to). **They haven't given specific details but as it stands now his FF speed is as fast as a cloaked wraith. By significantly they might mean reduce that by half. We'll have to see. Either way, I'm sure it will still be faster than his new base movement speed to give FF viable power and use in the game.**
---
“Legion can no longer see blood spots in addition to scratch marks.” That’s really bad. **How so? Maybe for new baby killers that can't track for shit.** 
---
“Feral Frenzy ends on missed attacks.” Hey, Leatherface! How’s that ‘Never screw up’ mechanic working out for you? **You're really comparing an already guaranteed hit to the wide area of a killers chainsaw slow movement speed without add-ons? Yikes.** 
---
“Feral Frenzy no longer reduces the mend meter on successive hits.” This is *really* bad. **That's really good imo.**
---
“Deep Wound no longer depletes in the Killer’s terror radius.” This is bad for ALL Killers. **A punishment for tunneling off the hook is a bad thing? It would only apply to "all" killers if borrowed time is active.**
---
Legion has no map pressure, no stealth, and an ability that cannot down people. What are we missing that makes him decent? **The new update! 😁 115% movement speed killers can down you pretty fast without powers if you get caught in a bad area or an area where there's no pallet and especially out in the open. Deep wounds already applies an injured status. Which means you just hit them again, like any other killer in the game, and they go down. Them having to mend doesn't give them invincibility.**
---
Your argument is shit though. I play tons of killer and I don't have anyone to worry about but myself. Have you ever tried playing solo survivor? I'm not talking about SWF I mean solo survivor. 2 people DC. that sucks you're screwed. Enjoy wasting 10 minutes just hard losing. Flip the arguement. Killer. No team to worry about. It's me vs them. and my skill vs theirs.
---
Lol same. Sure, the last chapter did *some* work for the terrible quality but it’s still a shitshow.
---
You didn't say a single thing about specualtions you wanted answers 
---
 to your questions and thats going to be impossible from us normal players. The only thing i can say about maps is that there will always be a new map with every DLC, like how it has always been.
---
Is there a site or list of all unlockable cosmetics or smth? I didn't even know these were a thing
---
I think I'm losing a frame every time I load the game at this point, it's the only explainationq

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
Lmao yesss! Thank you, this was perfect
---
you arent really playing the game though are you? just abusing it so you can feel good about yourself when you probably dont have enough skill not to do this desperate crap.
---
Also I just saw lithe in the SoS and it is at level 35.
---
No, I agree with him, you’re pretty goddamn stupid. You’ve proven it with this video. What kind of moron shows proof of their stupidity?
---
Dont hatch standoff, it's not worth it. Even if they camped.
---
Oh yeah, with the shrine of secrets I definitely suggest only getting perks that are on characters you don't already have.
---
The point of playing games is to have fun. If your idea of having fun is ruining fun for others, you're a dickhead and you dont deserve to play multiplayer games. You're toxic and its disgusting.  Keep acting like everyone else is sensitive when really you just need to look at yourself and realize you're an asshole.
---
This is quite interesting, thanks for the info. On top of redoing this with a less respected killer, I'd also like to see this survey done with an above average nurse and see how that affects BM.
---
And since we don't yet have dedicated servers, can you state what region you're matchmaking in, and what time you played most of these games?
---
It's the killer's choice if they wanna be sweaty or not. I just do it because I'd rather get onto the next game. Would rather not waste my time farming if it starts 3v1
---
Someone else pointed it out, its a foshing tackle box but its just something i found last minute to add on. This was more of a trail run, full versions of the costumes arent done yet
---
because players would rather get the game done as fast as possible in 3v1s
---
Sportsmanship is severely lacking in this game; the developers literally had to add End Game Collapse just so survivors would be forced to leave...
---
I really do hope it gets better. This is the only asymmetrical horror game where the killer dramatically loses their sense of "horror" and become and nonthreatening entity.
---
Survivors should be able to all dc or it should reset in lobby in 3v1s then. Why should we suffer through a game for that shit? lol
---
The game was rigged from the start
---
Yeah, that's the thing, this game is actually taking place in North Korea, and there's absolutely NO FUN ALLOWED in Korea.
---
9 feet tall?
---
ya and if a killer hits a survivor already the hook they should get another chance to yeet off it 
---
/s
---
none of this stuff should be the priority. and the teabagging and clicking is annoying but it doesnt need to be fixed, as if they wont just come up with other toxic crap to do.
---
people adapt easily
---
I think for a lot of killers it is more fun to play lobby simulator than pallet, teabag, flashlight, gen rush, mettle of man simulator.
---
You need to get over yourself. I don’t do these things but it’s funny how hurt you get about just the idea. I don’t deserve multiplayer games? No, YOU don’t since games like these are rated for Mature audiences who don’t cry “toxic” cause you don’t like the way someone else plays.
---
You gotta send the Devs an email with your report, evidently they don't look at report tickets put through in game.
---
They've always been the only thing to play for lol. I mean as survivor I keep my rank in check enough to stay away from 15-20s every season but that's it, no further ambition to rank apart from keeping it so I don't get stuck with noobs in matchmaking. As killer, I and many other killer could not care less about rank since the matchmaking makes you see people of all ranks every game. Especially since so many play SWF anyway, ranking is pointless for killer and doesn't reflect anything. Just like it doesn't reflect anything for survivors either but since on the survivor side of things it affects what dumbbell teammates you get it's at least a little pertinent to rank a bit.
---
-gets 4/4, apparently I’m bad at killer-
---
Whatever you say chum, like I said, I don’t care what anyone who doesn’t get 4/4 every game like me says about anything. Get gud kid. Stay in your lane.
---
Why should killers have to care about fun in a 3v1?
---
bbq isnt broken guys i swear
---
Am I the only person who thinks all 4k should be double pip
---
I think facecamping is arguably a "Valid" strategy, but a frustrating one for survivors (Die on first down, insidious bubba feels super cheesy, although that's probably the best use for insidious etc.).
---
I actually played basement bubba a few times and depipped with a 3K and a few unhooks. Besides the chaser penalty, you flat out miss-out on bloodpoints and emblems from extra hooks, pressuring gens, etc. 
---
Against experienced, coordinated survivors (Especially SWF) facecamping hurts you. If they're aware of it (say it over discord, or a hunch after 2 basement hooks on leatherface, or see it happen) they'll likely just do gens and escape without falling for the bait.
---
The only time I really go to the hook and camp is if I spot a survivor, or patrol the hook if it's near my 3-gen. I main doc btw and I do this as doc's treatment mode can grab people. Likewise with beam and range addons I like to zap the hook from far away to   sometimes deny unhooks.
---
I hard/facecamp once the gates are powered if I have hooked a guy. Otherwise I never really go out of my way to camp.
---
I remember the days when if a killer stood in front of the hook it blocked the unhook prompt. You could hook a guy, stand in front of the hook, go make a sandwich and survivors couldn't do jack shit. Hence the term "face"camping. (Killer stands right in front of your face watching you die.)
---
Yeah these skills seem to be popular amongst the suggestions.
---
I didn't know how much I needed a horde of nurses and trappers to kill link and zelde until now.
---
Yup. That's exactly who I had in mind.
---
I'm trying to figure out why you think it's scum. "other people do" isn't a good explanation, it's not my fault you cant elaborate and continue to side step the question.  Why should the survivors get the game over the killer just because there's a DC?
---
I was thinking of something like "only watches loli hentai" for Freddy but I also thought he would make fun of people for liking it tbh.
---
I think if you do it quickly with minimal generator progress it should be. You should be rewarded, not penalized, for shutting it all down quick
---
Kinda weird the tab icon is different for the dead by daylight tabs
---
This would finally give me a reason to Run Hangman's Trick. Did you use Petrified Oak as well?
---
Well yeah she can be used for evil but that doesn’t stop pig from being pig
---
i was once facecamped from first hook until death by a plague for the dumbest reason
---
she got me sick and i ran up on the hill to use balanced landing and bc i was sick i threw up on her, she was walking  down below along the hillside. she started shaking her head and when she caught me she stayed right infront of me unmoving. i spectated and she did nothing even close to camping for the rest of the players. 
---
throwing is her whole thing how could she be mad??
---
Make sure to play both sides so you get the 300 xp bonus for your first game.
---
I wouldn't mind some kind of silly broken "Arcade" mode where you can pull shenanigans like that
---
Let me post a rank 20 game and use it as a generalization as why the worst strategy works
---
It's usually the dumb Megs
---
I absolutely love this and need more of it

Who hurt you
---
A bunch of sheep dude. Believe it or not, it's the thing to do now.
---
&gt; I couldn’t even text her afterwards because it’s PS4 and she had messaged off.

Good.

The game is bugged as shit now. I know people dc ALOT on purpose, but lately dc's have been out of nowhere and multiple dc's at once. I honestly think, if not the majority,  then a large handful of these dc's are from the current bugged state of the game...or its definitely possible I'm completely wrong and people are being assholes. Guess we'll never know.
---
Very well done.
---
I need the gas mask. Helps with Toxic Survivors.
---
This looks awful. I wanted new / larger game modes, different objectives etc. and what do I get? Endgame collapse facepalm.
---
Oh god, I've never played killer before. Here goes nothing.
---
There is an achievement related to putting on traps, and another for killing survivors after exit gates are opened, but not any related to killing with the traps themselves.
---
why Spirit?
---
&gt;It really is not that difficult.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;it will only make you a better player playing against a coordinated group.
---
So... do you think going against a SWF group is difficult or not? You're contradicting yourself in your salt.
---
I would keep focusing on unlocking the worthy teachables you're missing.  I'd definitely recommend Nurse for Nurses Calling and Billy for Enduring next assuming you never purchased those from shrine previously.  Both are phenomenal meta perks and synergize well on a variety of builds and killers.
---
I didn’t know that! I’m gonna try it out as Distressing helps with her paltry Deviousness gains, so may as well see how UP plays with it. You’re right about the skillchecks not presenting much difficulty, however.
---
Well luckily. If you live outside of Australia then you don't have to worry.
---
I'm pretty far away.

I was actually going to settle with Linkin Park. But then we agreed that the names would either be based off actual park locations or like.. Car parking.

So I then went with Dog Park but then ultimately settled with South Park.

---
I thought it meant legion secretely likes anime but makes fun of people who watches anime.
---
That would make it so much worse for lobby dodging.  Every babykiller in game would dodge swf by default.
---
It wasn't photoshopped. For convenience sake, I cropped my name and just put it above me. If you want, I can show you the unedited image to prove it is not photoshopped?

 I actually did record the match that happened after this screenshot was taken. It was.. Hectic.
---
But it would be soooooo much better for everyone else
---
good job man
---
i salute you
---
the only dlc i bought with real money was leatherface just to do camping
---
I imagine some slugging or basement plays were done.

It requires a flexible play style. As in he needs to be flexible enough to bend over and tongue fuck his own asshole.
---
Not really. Even with our noble attempts to break hooks, we were a dysfunctional quad group and still died to hooks ironically. 
---
But we had fun.
---
Yea but in the real world no1 uses such perks and by the time this happens like 1/100 games ppl will still dc, suicide and camp. This endgame doesn’t help core problems. It just tells me the devs wasted time workin on such sidetracks rather than real enhancing content thru the match or gamedesign. It’s a neat contribution but won’t affect 99% of the matches imo
---
Take away BBQ points fucko. Should be what? 9-11k? Moron
---
No the problem with that is swf would get dodged constantly to the point of them no longer being able to play the game.  This would in turn chase those players out of the game completely making a sizable impact on our playing base which in turn would screw queues for the rest of us.  You need to factor in the whole picture.  A huge chunk of our player base is swf like it or not.
---
P...please.
---
I can't read a damm thing on the link.
---
Oh no
---
I also thought of that. Maybe that can be Joey? I only had 2 legions to work with so that's why there's only 2 in there.
---
Take my upvote for Dolphing
---
Lol ah okay. Clearly that's a very rigorous, taxing style to play and we should all give a congratulatory celebration for his hard work and dedication to such an amazing way to play.
---
You, sir, are my fucking friend. Everyone else can be lame and follow the rules.
---
Well it really sucks for killers who want to have fun but get stuck with SWF
---
what
---
Fucking love the shading and color play
---
If you wanna make sure you're not coming off as toxic, move your head up &amp; down (:
---
I would like to thank EVERYONE For the amazing upvotes, ya'll are just..
---
MMMMHHHH
---
The type of food that Gordon Ramsay would say is finally a piece of delicious fucking food.

For all the love for this image, I will proceed to make a sister post that links to the VIDEO that was recorded after this image was taken.
---
I did while I stood still for her to knock me down
---
I think that's a Trapper skin, but you ain't wrong, it looks good.
---
Pick your poison.  They're a necessity to the player base for better or worse.  I play a lot of killer and encounter them all the time.  I just play them like any other game.  Hard fought swf games have been by far my most rewarding victories.  Also for every depip squad you'll encounter there's like 4 or 5 swf teams that simply suck ass lol.  They aren't all gods.  Mics obviously give them a big advantage over randoms but communication won't teach a shit player how to run a killer lol.
---
Good, very good
---
gg ez baby killer
---
These fixes would essentially add backlash to expressing this kind of behavior. It would severely limit the number of people who would engage in this behavior. There will still be people who would rather deal with the consequences than just not do it, but they are likely the minority. In my opinion, the fixes proposed here are heavy for the actions they would correct, but they would probably work.
---
I think the main takeaway from this clip is that there ARE solutions that could add punishment to ill mannered behavior, but the devs are either not interested in implementing them or are actively trying to work them into the game. I would imagine that these particular behaviors, ones that I personally feel are on the lighter side of bad manners, are not a primary concern to be "fixed" by the dev team.
---
For me, taunting is a-okay in game, as long as it's not followed up by rude comments post-game. I just want my "gg"s and move on to the next game. People that talk shit post-game are being rude and petty imo, and represent a real problem that should be handled by the report button. It may not be the most powerful blanket fix to hit the Entity's realm, but I personally would prefer more reserved action against BM than in-game punishment.
---
What I am getting from this is that Michael is **SO** evil and powerful, that even in our world his blood lust is unstoppable.
---
If anyone needs to "get gud" and "stay in their lane" it's you since your obviously too bad at the game to play it as a normal "gud" person plays it. honestly who is so insecure that they have to camp the survivor not letting them play the game and your probably not even at green ranks, your probably the killer that dc's every second game to stay with the rank 15's and then say "I get 4/4 every game"  when your just face camping  and then you think your good enough to say "I don't listen to anyone without a 4/4 every game" which btw no one believes because its not true.
---
I played against that WHO! person, idk i just thought that was cool
---
I personally don’t care if a characters gay I just don’t want it to be one of those stories where it shoves it in our faces.
---
Like any good game needs some story/lore.  Although if a characters sexuality is to be brought up than it should fit the circumstances in the game not that of today.
---
3 botany - yes, healing speed in general is stackable.
---
self care - yeah I tried it in December 2016. it works.
---
4 stake outs - probably not.
---
3 up the antes/slippery meat - yes and no.
---
4 WGLF - Yes, due to BP Stacking always stacks
---
4 boil over - OH FUCK OH GOD NO OH NO
---
2 open handed/bond/kindred Well.... Yes Yes yes Yes yes yes yes yes yes and yes
---
Also Prove thyself doesnt stack
---
thank you!!!
---
Killers are by far more important. Killers are the lobby you join. If killers leave there is no game, just a bunch of survivors in a circle jerk complaining about NOED. 
---
And no m8, communication gives a huge advantage and ruins some killers like Myers or wraith or really any stealth at all killers might have. There's a reason there isn't in game chat
---
Yup. Flair checks out lol
---
I would be okay with this.
---
Or seeing auras of survivors outside of your terror radius...
---
Sounds like they are just a bunch of betacucks.
---
He thought you were a dog i guess.
---
He's a dude that got burned and started haunting people in their dreams. Babadook was never an actual person.
---
i lmao when i see msg from survivors u dont pip u dont get many bloopoints
---
i dont wanna pip u losers survivos all i wanna is to see u die on the hook
---
I agree with you but not like to the extent to call them babies and stuff. But I think a lot of killers have an extremist mindset and assume anytime they didnt easily 4k it was obviously a game with toxic swf, and games they got a 4k stomp it couldn't have possibly been a swf because swf never loses.
---
When that shit happens while I'm playing killer, I let them wiggle off, and give them a ten second head start. Not their fault the game's a bitch.
---
How did I just know you were going to itemize each and every one of those points …
---
Before I start explaining why water is wet, please answer this question: do you even play Killer? Like more than just casually or for just dailies? Because I feel like the guy throwing around terms like “baby killers” shouldn’t also be the guy who doesn’t understand that having standard Killer movement speed doesn’t mean you have decent map pressure.
---
&gt; I know alot of people who play dbd are little kids who got it when it was free on PS4.
---
No you don't.
---
Yeah, just make it so you can't earn BP and let people go wild. There will be obvious broken combos so it would have to be in an arcade kyf or something, but would be hilarious
---
Don’t find it funny at all actually. Try having shit like this happen to you all the time, you wouldn’t find it very funny anymore either.
---
My #1 choice is Pinhead from Hellraiser, with hopefully a map inspired by the Cenobite world. I figure he’d have some kind of ranged attack power, maybe like a hook on a chain that pulls survivors in a specific direction. And probably some kind of cool secondary power that I’m not creative enough to think about. Aesthetically he’d fit the game wonderfully and I think they could figure out a way to make the lore work.
---
#2 choice is probably Harry Warden from My Bloody Valentine. Always loved the aesthetics of that character and I think he’d easily fit the game. Not sure what his power would be, but the map could be a mineshaft. I would like to have another indoor map in the game and exploring underground tunnels sounds claustrophobic and creepy. 
---
#3, Jason. TBH it’d be a challenge for the devs to come up with perks and a power to make him feel unique at this point, but he is one of the most iconic slashers and feels like he needs to be in this game.
---
Pyramid Head would be cool, and Id love a foggy Silent Hill map, although they’d have to figure out a way to not make it look too much like Haddonfield.
---
I'm a PC player and I've watched console matches. With that framerate you fuckers should be happy that you have any killers at all. This game is pathetic for killers on console.
---
That's like saying you don't have to respect black people and they shouldn't expect it lol. Fuck you
---
Practice with nurse = near gauranteed wins unless you mistime a blink.
---
You said I offered no input. I finally gave you my Input. But yeah ok. 
---
Reddit Logic. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
PS:
---
And no I don’t fucking play Claudette. Because on PS4, 90% of Claudette players are deadweight sandbaggers that wait for hatch while hiding in lockers or plain sight. I see a Claudette in the all brown outfit, I leave the lobby. Because you can literally bet money on them doing any of those things. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I did not know this, I thought it was like a “stay put ass hole” type smack
---
yeah I purposely left out the lore that he diddled kids cause thats not an appropriate stereotype to attach to someone who watches anime vehemently
---
I still really like the one from the carnival set, with the weights. Perfect for that burly beefcake.
---
You'd see less Billies if A. Other killers provided his map pressure and B. Console wasn't a 10 FPS slideshow. People would play Billy even if his chainsaw wasn't an instant down.
---
Nurse
---
Ok uh what
---
I honestly had a stroke reading the title
---
HARDCORE MODE (yea I’ve had this happen to me on PS4 a few times really had to sweat it out)
---
***Screams in Freddy: “NOOOO”***
---
Obviously an idiot who has no life. Probably getting off on acting like. A dipshit
---
I'm surprised they devs can't tell if it's an internet disconnect vs a quit game. From what I've seen there is no penalty for quitting, and even though people could still pull plugs, at least nailing the quitters would be a start.
---
Also at the end of the video, the animation for the karambit gets put onto the hunting knife so it's just kinda floating in Julie's hand.
---
He went out with 22k and could have had 50k. Someone didn't know how to see the big picture. Bless their heart. Sorry about the waste of BPS.
---
F for respects for all the people I’ve done that to....forgive me Survivors!
---
You missed the point of their comment. They nerfed the killer so much that nerfing FMT is a non-issue. It's like removing the nitro boost from a car after you already tore off the wheels.
---
People will not "adapt" to a new Legion playstyle. People just won't play them. Which is what the community wanted.
---
I played Wraith today against what I believe to be a SWF, and had a decent game hooking most if not all of the survivors twice. After the gates opened I hooked a Feng, and while I was a bit salty she'd been sabo'ing my hooks all game, I left her and went after her teammates. She got unhooked, and everyone escaped. There was no teabagging or drawing the game out.
---
After the game I got messages from each of them, saying good game, and a thank you for not camping the hook. Those messages really made my night, so if any of you are reading this, thank you!
---
When you get a survivor up to lvl 30,35,40 you get option to unlock those perks as teachables (they'll be orange), once you have them as teachables they'll show up in other survivor/killer bloodwebs
---
Ok.
---
How the fuck is a facecamper running the biggest crutch in the game telling anybody to get gud?  How the hell do you see any skill whatsoever in what you do?  A first day player can do this shit bro.  It is so fucking sad man.  You are hot garbage dude and I'm telling you this as a rank 1 killer that 4k's without NOED crutch or babycamps while playing Wraith, Freddy and Trapper.  Learn how to play scrub.  Babytrash like you make all of us killer mains look pathetic.
---
Oh damn ok I’ll try it
---
Crikey folks, this here is what we call troll bait. Now it may look just like your everyday salty survivor main, but the amount of trolltastic posts it has made in this threat shows that it truly wants to be a master baiter, but just remember, it can't survive if you don't fall for its master baiting. Don't even look at it. It will bugger off on its own.
---
It's hard now, I'm thinking End Game will make it harder. SWF would be your best bet
---
Yep. They're pointless. Which I think is what the plan was.
---
Playing on PS4 and have noticed a lot of DC'ing from survivors. I only DC when the connection is godawful and it is obviously working in the Killer's favor. But I hate when a person is down immediately and then they DC. Way to fuck us over.   
---
I am a survivor main but when I play Killer, I love when people who have de-ranked try that toxic shit with me and then IMMEDIATELY DC when they're down.
---
Who is this guy btw and from where? That's a relatable meme haha
---
Out of curiosity do you remember if the stacks of WGLF were earned by unhooking or by taking a hit for someone?
---
I was getting weak BP returns lately and realized this morning that I was trying a new (for me) build
---
I got adept legion today
---
Thank you
---
Also you can get teachables from the Shrine of Secrets in the store for shards (if you haven't bought leatherface go into the shrine and get BBQ and chili right now it's a very very good perk and this is the first time it's showed up in the shrine in more than a year)
---
Both were unhooks.
---
Damn, well there goes my big idea.  Best of luck on finding a fix!
---
the point of the hex is supposed to be high risk high reward that would destroy it. I think some just need to be hidden better
---
You're bitching on Reddit about a video game and calling everyone toxic. Fuck off kid its obvious you're 12
---
Thanks
---
This is false. While I DO prioritize my fun first I understand that there are other players in the match with me that want to have fun too. I think fun is subjective but in my opinion the best fun in a match is when no one is toxic be it killer or survivors. But most importantly the best fun in this game(again in my opinion), is playing BOTH sides.
---
I think heal speed can't go above +100%
---
1. Yeah, probably.
---
2. It could be made to "If a survivor in this radius has this perk, the skill check odds stack for all in the radius and users of the perk receive extremely difficult skill checks." Because the whole point of the perk is A. I don't like people, and B. The game likes to spawn me and everyone in the match together, meaning all 4 survivors and a Leatherface just around the corner.
---
3. The point is to be able to close the distance to the killer and bait the killer away from an ally. Ofcourse, I wasn't really thinking about that and will make a quick change.
---
No. The Babadook was a mediocre horror movie monster. The movie would have been a lot better without the Babadook. The only scary thing about it was its voice.
---
I never asked to delete legion or else. I rarely play legion, but I liked him how he was and their way of changing him into m1 boring killer is terrible.
---
He must be nerfed, but not reworked.
---
If I recall correctly, Open-Handed has a limit to how many will stack. I think max is 24? additional meters? Someone please check me on that
---
Seriously get barbecue and chili ASAP it is an amazing killer perk and you may not have another opportunity to get
---
Omg people are WILD.
---
That only happens 5 percent of the time tho.. unless your in 12 plus ranks might be more frequent the risk factor is still there because the perk is destroyable.. it's very rare a hex will last more than 80 seconds, unless the map is lierys or the game
---
Thanks for the response. I seem to have a lower BM rate on the west coast of the US, but I haven't ever tried recording this infromation.
---
What
---
The difference is mostly that Freddy can sleep multiple people quickly, and depending on add ons and luck can keep people asleep for significant periods of time, while also granting detection if they choose to fight through the debuff.
---
Legion's new power ONLY stalls if he chains hits, which often means by the time you're up to hitting a second or third person, the first is already mended. The time it takes to move between running targets wastes a lot of his stalling, and there's really not much downside besides the 10 seconds of mending. (Not to mention he becomes blind to someone the second he looks away, no scratches, no blood, potential iron will.)
---
Hell, you can probably still not heal against them, because the only value in their power is initiation, so you aren't exactly going to get to a gen and go "right, who's injured here, I'll just down you," they'll be frenzying in from a distance, and there's 0 downside to getting frenzied while injured.
---
Basically its an initiation that's MEANT to stall but doesn't. It can be a mobility tool too, but self-stunning and waiting for the power to recharge makes it a poor use if you find someone without the duration left to hit them. It's not like Nurse who has no cooldown, or who can damage regardless of the health state of who she lands on.
---
We've already got plenty of killers whose powers revolve around an easy first hit, and most if not all of them are regarded low tier because they're still loopable and they lack map pressure. The difference is their powers actually do other things, and can be used to down as well.
---
Aren’t you the guy who worships streamers like Jen and Kitty while shitting on tru3?
---
Made a quick change to mania, and if part of your question is about the madness, base tier 1 madness is 33% insane skill check.
---
Actually laugh every time this happens to me.
---
Bunny Feng min please
---
So you’re saying you’re a crazy dumbass who makes inaudible noises instead of talking ... yeah seems about right
---
You can't have it both ways, people argue Billy is 'balanced' because he's a 115 killer so he's SO EASY to loop, you can't then take Legion and be like, 'but wow, now he's 115 that's basically a free down!'
---
Thanks for reading it! I agree that the ghost thing is by far the most far-fetched, but I do think even some sort of spectating system as a character in game would be cool!
---
Map-wide terror radius always confused me on them. Like when you hit someone, your killer instincts hits the whole map, so you know which DIRECTION the other 3 are in, but you have no fucking clue if they're in frenzy range or 3/4 of the map away, it'll take away the ONE thing their power does after this change which is chain hits.
---
he actually got 110k BP out of it, 100% for each streamer and max bbq stacks. True he could've gotten more if he I wouldn't exactly say needed to farm, but just played without a Mori, could've easily gotten 150k+ points with the 500% increase.
---
Yeah I think this post is pretty great these changes would be fun but the one change I wanna see the most is 
---
The devs fixing pretty much every exploit and bug in the game instead of banning players who were using it.
---
Haunted grounds update
---
Oh trust me, I will lol.
---
They said freddy info is next month
---
Is it just me or does the commentary contradict itself around the 20 second mark the commentator says players can start the end game by 
---
(opening the exit gate or closing the hatch) 
---
And then he goes on to say both killer and survivor can open the exit gates 
---
(Only the killer can close the hatch) 
---
Is anyone els confused by this only thing I can think of is that, if the hatch is opened by a key let's say when there 2 survivors left and 3 gens hatch spawns and is opened by a key, survivors can close it and start end game but I dont see point in that
---
I’m pretty sure it’s a selected box. And not 50/50 every box. Yes it can be the same one for multiple helmets but still one box is the right one the rest are just to waste time.
---
Get well soon :*
---
Yikes
---
Noed isn't always a 4k and I personally would not call it brokenly OP but I get what you're saying
---
I forgot to factor that in! Yeah, pretty much what he got, he could have gotten more of. But, whatever, yanno?
---
I main freddy mostly. End game is harsh and I usually run decreased action speed and skill check add ons to avoid gates being powered and blood warden for when they do but blood warden doesn't last long enough.
---
why do you talk like that
---
As I already commented on this post. I used a poor choice of words.
---
/r/BetterEveryLoop
---
Although you made a few mistakes here and there, this shit is scummy and no one deserves this, except those who do this kind of shit
---
When did the devs say that?
---
Okay so I should burn through my addons?
---
Yeah well I was not suggesting anything sexual about you, but if you want to think a guy wants to flirt with you i assure you, you probably like men
---
Definitely get BBQ, and I’d say, play the killer you like playing, lvl them up, once you’re somewhat happy with your perks, save up points to lvl up the killers with good perks, then snag those teachables, save up more points, prestige your fav killer who’s already at lvl 50, then you can get the good perks, imo you should just play whoever is the most fun. Just my opinion.
---
They do not, unfortunately.
---
Yes get BBQ and level up whichever killer you like. It can be easier to farm BP as a killer so that’ll help you get your survivors up too.
---
Around spirits release. They said it again when legion was released.
---
Nice one man. The killer bug is real, soon you’ll be leveling someone just for the teachables
---
weird, thanks for the quick reply
---
If you have all those saved up, spend them on a killer with good perks, get all the teachable perks, then start playing the killer you like, lvl them up as you go and you’ll probably get those perks you wanted around lvl 10-20. That just my opinion, do what you want.
---
Look at this killer camping and tunneling, while also using Noed ON MYERS, and then crying when he gets t-bagged.
---
How do I know you’re camping? Because the chase with Jane happened at the same place you hooked her, which means that you were around when she got unhooked.
---
Also, you use Noed on and insta-down killer, or noed in general - That alone tells me you’re not very good.
---
Also, who tf bloodlusts? Only rank 15 killers do. 
---
Yea sorry OP but I hope you didn’t expect to get upvotes.
---
I have mixed feelings, largely because im the survivor that does that "toxic" for the meme, i will never do it to the killer, but i will walk up to my survivor pals and flashlight spam as a joke, or crouch spam as a "thank you" or "ayyyy wassup" idk. Toxicity is weird in this game.
---
Yeah I was having more fun than expected. Like I went in thinking I wasn't going to get anyone. I almost forgot about the blood marks.
---
Didn't The Spirit's lore mention something about her making an oath with the Entity? I took that to mean she traded a lifetime (unlifetime?) of service in exchange for her father's death
---
Fuck the guy who asked him if has autism though. Shouldn’t say stuff like that it’s messed up how people think it’s okay to make fun of someone who was unfortunate to be born with a disability
---
On an unrelated note, I did come up with a build including Spine Chill.
---
* Spine Chill (anticipate killer)
---
* Quick &amp; Quiet (jump in a locker)
---
* Head On (by the time they start checking, you'll have it)
---
* Dance With Me (gtfo and hide in another spot)
---
Oh hey, interesting post history, figures a Trump supporter talks out of their ass when having a debate
---
Yeah but he said may twenty something. I have no doubt that it could be ghost face but I’m kinda thinking it’s something else.

Well who do you think has the best 3 teachables?

Yeah when I saw that I thought that definitely crossed a line

I never realized how good that line could be for hatemail, I'ma reply with that from now on.

As you can see 50% remove first box, 25% second, 12.5% third, 7% fourth. This is a 50% chance to remove at every box, and proof that you don’t have a specific box to search.
---
You're arguing chicken vs egg here.  Without survivors killers don't have players to fill their lobbies.  You understand the majority of the base plays both sides right?  If you lose swf players it reduces both the amount of survivors in the community as well as the killer pool as well so it is a double hit.
---
Bro reading comprehension....I specifically state that mics aka communication gives swf an obvious advantage over randoms.  I main Wraith and wreck swf all the time.  They're a part of the game, they aren't going anywhere so I suck it up and play them.  I rise to the challenge and don't whine incessantly about them.  Like it or not the exodus of swf players would have a huge negative impact on the available player base.  It's simple math man.
---
They will most likely be transferred over to what they are being turned into, just like wraith.
---
Maybe they just snapped out of there............................... sorry
---
Okay seems fair. Thanks for awnsering.
---
Replied in seconds, your welcome.
---
BBQ + Billy = ez game
---
Good job dude! If you have any questions or just want some tips, feel free to ask me. Otherwise good job!
---
Up to you. Lithe is my personal favorite exhaustion perk since, unlike sprint burst, you don’t have to walk everywhere to avoid activating it.
---
Ah yes, the wild reatards in their natural habitat. Such fascinating creatures.
---
Pig reverse bear trap
---
So just pause chapter and new content creation and pay those guys to do nothing for a month while the bug fixers do their thing?
---
Run bbq+c for killer, doctor, with some survivor pudding and you’ll be set to get a bunch of bloodpoints
---
Yeah I only yell it just to yell it. Most of the shit I yell at this game ate more for relief of yelling at something. I almost never mean it.
---
Random perk mode with random killer
---
Not my fault! I thought it was a urinal
---
Bro why are you getting defensive nobody is judging you. You live your truth bro don’t let me stop you.
---
You are our Piggy main!! Oink!
---
Depends on who you play. Certain killers grant more bp for their basic actions. Clown yeeting a bottle and getting a hit? Bp. Plague puking on everything in sight? Bp. Billy by just existing? Bp.
---
Ok jokes aside killers do generate more bloodpoints, and people who know how to do that, can use that feature to their advantage.
---
Thank you kindly 😊
---
I’m not gay lol, if you say something negative expect to get a response don’t be a pussy and call them defensive for replying to you.
---
If I could have one thing from here that is realistic, it would be skill check struggle, I hate spamming keys.

Wow rude to not include hag

tbh, from what i have been hearing (havnt been able to play in a few months) i woyld rather have them temperairly ruined than nothing changed
---
Yeah, doctor with b&amp;c will net you bloodpoints for days, even without 4 kills
---
Yeah I'm gonna get it. Thinking back on all of my chases it will absolutely help.

55-60k per good game playing with Freddy and bbq. Add in a pudding and it's like 75-90k a game.
---
Because a lot of people DC in this game for many reasons, and 80 percent of players in any game are survivors. I DC all the time when the ping the killer has is green/yellow but then the connection is garbage. Getting hit through every pallet, being unable to throw pallets, getting dead hard shakes WITHOUT dead hard, teleporting are not fun. Add to that some very poorly designed maps, some very toxic add ons/items and people don't always want to play.
---
Hehehehe
---
Imagine using sprint burst with 3 vigils. What the actual fuck.
---
Wait, if you stacked self care level 3, would your medkit like last way longer than it should since it adds durability???
---
And on that note, 16% movement speed for noed, yikes.
---
Probably just coincidental, bps affect killers too, no?
---
Truth. I honestly feel like this is just a blanket nerf to silence the survivors who are complaining about the moonwalking and Frank's Mixtape nonsense. The complaints are justified, but for the devs to act like they wanted to reinforce Legion's role with these changes is ridiculous. Legion is going from "dear God wtf are those add ons" to "loop me daddy". Like every other killer that isn't nurse.
---
Would that count as an unsafe hook since she died right after the rescue?
---
I did some research, the only thing about hatch spawns that changed is that when only one survivor is left it always opens. I’m 99% sure the rest of the rules about hatch spawning stay the same.
---
A prime example of pathetic loser who is worthless. They try so hard to feel "powerful" but when they turn off the game, its back to their shitty reality. 🙄
---
Thanks, Satan.
---
Nice. I’m surprised the most at it not costing 2,700 shards.
---
Most of these “things” that you hate are just the way people play, I used to think the same way, but I realized that you just gotta deal with campers and tunnellers and “sweaty” people, if you’re gonna get mad about that, I can’t see you ever enjoying this game. I get that hitboxes and stuff are absolutely garbage right now, and no one enjoys that. But people being “sweaty” and wasting pallets or just being straight up bad, is a part of the game. You can’t just get rid of those people, and if you wanna play a team game, you run the risk of getting shitty teammates.
---
100% No
---
If the killer’s communicate then 1 can camp while 1 can hunt.  What happens when 2 killers chase 1 survivor. Imagine facing 2 pro Nurses or Nurse and Billy. Imagine 2 trappers with iridescent stones.
---
From killer point of view all I would see is.
---
10 adrenaline, 10 Deliverance, 10 DS.
---
Bbq with doc/plague is pretty good. Shock everyone as much as you can, and puke in everything in sight. Make sure to get everyone hooked once for max bbq+c potential.
---
Ebony Mori and Omega Blink, Jesus. That build is so ridiculously overpowered. The omega blink nurse addons are bugged, so the accuracy debuff doesn't work. I've tested this in a KYF by lining my HUD up with the environment to blink the same way every time. It has no effect on the landing position whatsoever, it only increases the range.  
---
  
---
I'm sure this guy thinks he's so good, but he's just taking advantage of an exploit, not to mention he's already playing the strongest killer in the game.
---
And the exposed effect would stack enough to kill the player in real life
---
So will there be a penalty or not?
---
I just want Legion removed from the game honestly but oh well wutcha gon' do
---
r/randomlyracist

---
Why would you use your palm?! You can do like the slowest rotations on the planet and the bar fills at normal speed.
---
Please change the flair from “Discussion” to “Salt / Rant” you even said “Rant over.” 
---
Also, I’ve made a point to never lobby dodge as killer, because I play survivor too, and I know how annoying it is.
---
plunderer's instinct 4 times gives you a fucking pistol
---
It doesnt. Theyre the same speed.
---
As a bing bong can confirm
---
What's sad is the Clown is actually halfway decent yet he's rarely ever played and someone like Legion is just the absolute worst when it comes to anything at all about killers in this game and I see them relatively often
---
If it has anything to do with Ghostface it has to be a cosmetic for Lefgion, there’s no way they’d announce the next chapter before the mid chapter PTB is even out.
---
This comment alone makes me wanna post a video and show you how you can spin the stick calmly without breaking the damn thing.
---
They watch people on twitch do it, so they want to do it.
---
Trust me Remember Me has done me better with Freddy than Ruin or anything else. Blood Warden is decent but not always viable. The point is to spend the time beating the obsession‘s ass and use aura reading to find everyone and make them all trade hooks over and over. Do it fast enough and they can’t get gates powered at all, and barely get hatch capability. 
---
Here’s what I do:
---
Red Paintbrush &amp; Class Photo OR Pill Bottle
---
ANY additional aura reading on Freddy is very helpful, so aura reading perks are your friend. These are my usual perks:
---
-**Nurses Calling** (good for finding those smart survivors who stay in your terror radius to avoid being seen, this is an Essential Freddy Perk) 
---
-**Remember Me** (ESSENTIAL!!!! A full 6 stacks of Remember me makes those gates take YEARS practically to open. The only person you need to worry about opening the gate is the Obsession since they are immune to the perk’s effects.)
---
-**Thanatophobia** (Keep everyone asleep and injured. This is a good compensation perk if you don’t use the slower action speed addons. However it is susceptible to skill checks being a problem sometimes. But this is also why I make sure everyone is asleep and injured if possible. Healing already takes forever, Thanatophobia increases my chances of finding a healing survivor.) 
---
Here’s your wild cards you can mix and match with:
---
-**Rancor** (In most cases, those gates getting powered is inevitable. Especially if you don’t run Ruin or something of that sort. This is a good Remember Me combo. You get full 6 stacks before the gates are powered, and if you didn’t already kill the obsession, you use this to do so the instant that last Gen pops. Since I like to keep everyone asleep, As soon as I see one Gen left I hunt down the obsession. I will either keep downing them and staying close or stay in a purposely long chase until Rancor is ready. Plus when gens are completed I’m told where they are anyways so it’s easy to find them usually, but of course not always. Rancor is a good last second door locker when combined with Remember Me. You just spend your time guarding the gates after.)
---
-**Dying Light** ( Another good Remember Me insurance perk. Those gates will basically NEVER EVER open if you kill the obsession and have the full 6 stacks. If you want to trade something like Thanatophobia for this one, it works decently too but it’s kind of overkill. It’s still possible to do without this. But as we all know, slow action speed can make a Freddy game much more difficult, or any game for that matter) 
---
-**Bitter Murmur** (Obviously anything that gives you extra glimpses or aura reading is great for Freddy.)
---
-**BBQ** (Again, ANY additional aura reading is a great help to Freddy)
---
-**Iron Maiden** (More funny and for scouting, but works better than I would have thought. This is decent when combined with a fast dream transition for the survivors you find that weren’t already asleep. But this has helped me find so many survivors trying to shadow me out of sight, it’s amazing. However since Jane came out I do get cucked sometimes lol. But like O said, decent for finding the people who like to hide in lockers all the time.)
---
Other honorable mentions:
---
Coulrophobia, Sloppy Butcher, Blood Hound, Corrupt Intervention, Dark Devotion, Tinkerer, Monitor &amp; Abuse, And Surveillance. 
---
Find as many survivors as possible first, and put them ALL to sleep before picking one to target. If someone else runs in front of you mid chase, smack them once or down then and continue chase on the original target. (Sometimes I will completely switch to that person if it means putting equal pressure on all the survivors.) Now there’s one person in your aura reading who can’t repair gens, wake up, etc. that pretty much guarantees another survivor to not be repairing gens to come save that person. And if you’re already chasing one? Then that’s only one person doing a Gen. But if they are asleep their #1 priority is to wake up so again you’ve bought time for yourself. Equal pressure buys you a lot of needed time with Freddy. Red paintbrush or M&amp;A help you sneak up on survivors. By the time they realize you’re close enough to put them to sleep, it’s too late to run. That is another huge advantage and it makes it easier to keep putting everyone to sleep. 
---
Find the obsession first if you can for your first target/chase. Make sure they are your first hook if so. DONT TUNNEL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. The worst thing you can do with Freddy is tunnel people down one at a time. I see so many Freddy players make this mistake. EQUAL CONTINUOUS PRESSURE drags the game out, gives you more points, and results in more sacrifices more often than not. 
---
If I took Killer more seriously, I could get my Freddy to Red Ranks at least. (The highest I tried was rank 6) With my strat I nearly always double pip, and have the capability of a 4K. However I frequently let the last one left go. Either a bug that made me pity them, or an asshole teammate that kept screwing them, etc. and even still I almost always double pip and Max all emblems except Sacrifice. It’s also possible when you let two people live.
---
Thank you. Looking forward to more.

Happened to me one time
---
Oink
---
Have not been seeing this much, I’ve seen the last survivor just give up and find the killer and let him either take them to hatch or kill them, but I haven’t seen a lot of giving as soon as something doesn’t go well.
---
Well it just so happens the Freddy is one of my favourite killers hahaha, will be sure to give it a try.
---
PS4.  Been playing 2 years.  Couple thousand hours in
---
Reminds me of how I hid in a room with one exit and a P3 trapper spotted me and just placed a trap at the only exit. I tried to crouch around it and stepped in it....
---
Bonus points for the ones who just turn, look at you and either accept death or DC.
---
I agree they should take the addons out but they can ban people if there was a house with an open door you still shouldnt walk in because its not your house
---
All you do is whine. Every time you whine about a killer perk someone should remind you to get good and stop getting hit.
---
Lol yeah unfortunately lots of camping trash on console.  I just try to punish that shit by running them as many gens as I can before they get the opportunity to do so (I play a lot of survivor too).  Playing both sides keeps me fresh.  Lot of times the queues break for survivor though on PS4 so I have to play killer if I don't want to stare at the campfire.
---
The 360 was too sick for them
---
Coming from a pure blood survivor main (rank 1) I see this stuff all the time, for various reasons and have done it myself a handful of times
---
1. You’re the type of survivor that somehow get the killers attention every. Single. Game, so we figured that we might as well waste the current killers time and buy our friends some time.
---
2. The dc glitch, I have played DBD on Xbox and pc and this is exclusive to Xbox and the one I pull the most, you make DBD code think the killer dc’ed but really you did, it’s a normal dc but you can’t spectate and you get blood points as well as seeing the killers perk, this mostly happens on dead hook considering you are going to die anyways.
---
3. Killers being an ass without knowing it
---
4. You’re messing around or have gotten bored
---
5. You’re a pussy and if the match doesn’t work perfectly for you then you dc
---
6. The killer is purposely being super toxic 
---
7. Your friend is tired of being tunneled so you kill yourself so their not first dead
---
8. Killer has an ebony or pink add ons
---
feel like we did a pretty good job so far guys
---
I don't think their system is advance enough to do it that easily. This game has so much bugs, it should be back in beta. Lol
---
Damn these dudes dropping bombs from their fingertips
---
I sense a Claudette....lol jk. On PS4 though...it’s usually a Claudette in either P3 outfits or the dark brown (Shit color) outfit. You can literally bet money on them being deadweight or a sandbagger on PS4.
---
Which would be hilarious, considering Legion sales are going into the toilet.
---
Yeah it's the same in every game. If they exploit a glitch then they should have some sort of punishment.
---
Holy ball busters, that new just broke every speed law known to man. Even sonic can’t catch up. 
---
Nea: “Haha, you’re too slow. Now Michael’s gonna kill you.” 
---
Sonic: “Wait what?” 
---
Michael: *Stabs the shit out of sonic*
---
If there were better perks people would use them. Most other perks that affect gens suck. The blood points grind is atrocious so people use BBQ to lessen it. Get over it.
---
when that happened the survivor just looks back then looks down then I just down him bring him down the hook. Well if they ask if i would've spared him when kobe it's a killer game so yea lol.
---
Based on the forums; at base level, hitting a Deep Wounded Survivor with Frenzy does nothing. Depending on what add-ons you run, it can apply effects such as; Blindness, Mangled or it can take 25% of the Deep Wound timer.
---
McLean commented in some thread that it can
---
It was against a LF on Lery's he had all addons that increased stun time so he stood still for 13seconds.
---
Well done my friend. Very thorough indeed.
---
I am glad you liked it. Anything you want me to do next?
---
I've heard of granite and andhesite, but what kind of a mineral is amirite?
---
You don't fuck around with a good Nurse, you just get your shit and leave asap.
---
This would nearly be impossible to do ingame.  First pig would have to keep track of which boxes the survivor has visited, which essentially dedicates a huge chunk of time to just following this claudette around while leaving the other survivor completely free to do gens.  Then, the survivor has to be unlucky enough to not get it until their last box, which is something like a 12.5% chance.  For the love of god, do not call for Pig nerfs over this.  The odds of this ever occurring in an actual game are slim to none.
---
I mean, not really lol. If you sleep me as Freddy and then leave, who cares if the gen takes a bit longer? it's basically the same as having Ruin up, which doesn't actually slow down good survivors. Sure you could do that "sleep everyone and then start hitting" shit as Freddy in low ranks, but high rank players will absolutely FUCK  you if you don't keep them on the hook
---
Freddy is also in 3rd person!
---
Legion? Disgusting.....Maybe after the nerf.
---
Totally legit.  Totally.
---
F....the poor bastard. I’ve done that before in a similar game and I felt so horrible when it happened. 😭💔
---
The only thing really worth puking on is gens tbh, but since I suck with plague, catch me puking on everything I can find. 🤢🤮 it’d be nice if they did increase the infection points on survivors tho.
---
Okay mister best player in the world now explain to me, give me some real reasons that might actually change my mind, how does this prove you as skillful, tell me what about this takes skill. You wait and then press a button, please elaborate on where the “skill” is. I don’t care if you got a 4/4, tell me what about this make you skillful.
---
&gt;Out of the 205 survivors: -137 DCed when first hit this is equal to 66.8%
---
Jesus christ. Like, I know everyone has experienced this to some degree but seeing it put into numbers like this is still mind blowing. If I'm reading it right ~29% of games ruined within what can be considered the beginning of the game (First hit d/cs d/cs within the first 10 seconds, and d/cs when Ruin was cleansed because lets be honest, I can only imagine someone d/cing for that if it occurs early on).
---
So almost 30% of games just outright ruined from the get-go. Yes, the 3v1s can be salvageable but it's an uphill slog with the constant thought of "fuck it, I should just d/c too and find myself another game". 
---
If BHVR is waiting until dedicated servers to do something more concrete they may want to consider some triage in the meantime. Obviously whatever auto-punish bot is currently too lenient. You could probably halve it's leniency and still see way too many d/cs for this game. And yes, I get it, having the game be the one that crashes you is a significant issue here.
---
But right now DbD is like an old tree with a tire swing on it, except the tire is damaged and warped and hard to stay on. Yes it sucks when you fall off mid swing through no fault of your own. But you know what's a better problem to focus on? The insect infestation that is destroying the tree slowly that just gets ignored.
---
That long shit people agree to and never read. The EULA...yeah, it's in there. Near the top actually.
---
GOD i had a game like this a few days ago... all of us popped streamers, loaded in, were doing work - next thing i know three of my teammates are down and hooked and i have to go try and save them... killer got about your killer's amount, i got one-hooked with a half a gen's worth of bloodpoints. i was like "i played David for THAT??" ugh.
---
i'm not even asking for them to farm! just, you know, maybe let people save once before killing us all so we can get the unhook points? idk. :( sorry about your streamers man.
---
Just wrapped up my insomniac session with a really great run of hatch escapes using skeleton key/add ons. Including one with a tunneling legion who made the obsession D/C and another dude immediately after (this was on The Game).
---
Last game we played against Spirit and I let them know I had a key in pregame. We kicked ass and she wound up getting our Bill but the other 3 of us took the hatch which was conveniently right by an exit gate.
---
Here I thought it was going to go horribly because our first game was Legion + Ruin (well hidden) + Swamp. I wound up just letting him kill me when I was the last one left.
---
Still had a great time. Surprising number of non-toxic killers out tonight. Survs too.
---
They're banning people who know about the bug and are purposefully abusing it. If you didn't know about it and used it accidentally, you're fine. They can tell the difference through internal data, like match history. If you don't normally play Legion and then suddenly you're playing double mend addons occasionally and only those addons, then yeah they're gonna assume you're abusing it and probably ban you if you're doing it a lot. They also have chat logs, so if people were to call you out on it and you ignored it or played dumb and then continued to do it, well, that's more evidence towards intended abuse. It's not just mindless banning if you even think about using the addons and I don't think it's anything worth getting super angry about.
---
Aww but hatch standoffs are teh lulz
---
Its a very scary situation when 42.4% of people you played with DC'ed during a game. 
---
The Devs have really got to do something about DC'ing during a match. Having almost half the community break a rule consistently tells me that maybe that rule is not being enforced.
---
Because not every game needs a battlepass
---
The reworked Freddy is getting nerfed before he even gets released.
---
I absolutely love playing Trapper.  I feel like I pretty much only want to play him with a bag addon to save time (brown will do) but once you learn what loops and spots to shut down on the various maps he is a lot of fun.  He's easy to snowball downs with too as the game wears on and they burn through more of the pallets leaving mostly your trapped defenses left.  Just pray you don't get the game map every run and you're in pretty good shape lol.
---
This is the question that needs to be answered...
---
Dude I’m sorry but what do you expect? You said something dumb trying to “correct” me. I’m actually a pretty cool person, I just say it like it is and people don’t like that HAHAHA.
---
My second game ever was a legacy 4 man swf...
---
I experience this a lot now. I had lots of games where we all spawn together and the killer close by (no offerings).
---
I can see that you’re very cool, look at all those downvoted you have in the comments.
---
Dwight mains, IQ -100.
---
#pathetic
---
I’m aware of that part. I meant “why did it happen right away?”
---
Doesn’t the timer for the trap get reset if the player wearing it gets hooked?
---
The way this happened there was no chance of getting the trap off at all.
---
Why do so many people in this community assume that everyone only plays one side? I *am* a killer player on console and even with the low frame rate, if someone needs NOED on Billy they have a lot to improve.
---
Haha this reminded me of the term “Get DICE’d” on Battlefield 3 &amp; 4
---
Acctually 2 killers DCed 7min into the game when ruin got cleansed, they were Nurse and Billy.
---
I mean 57,6% isn't an asshole, that is more then I expected. Still way to much people don't care. I think if a survivor DC's they should spawn with an RBT on that is active next game, so it shows who DC and who don't, and it is fun to watch them suffer.
---
Dude's in for a surprise when he makes it down to lower ranks. Yikes.
---
Now I want to see Rin mori him
---
Wow, ok genuinely shocked by that. Like if my Ruin lasts until the first hook I consider that a game where it earned its keep. Anything beyond that is bonus gravy. But if you have a game that's lasted 7 minutes AND Ruin is still active? I'd would have more money on a survivor d/cing than the killer. 
---
Still, thanks for the heads up on that one.
---
That title, what a mem
---
No idea dude. I'm no dev by any means so I don't know how easy it is to ID a volitional ragequit compared to a crash or a network issue. For instance if some shitheel really wanted to get around this they could just kill their internet connection.
---
But holy cow. It's the worst part of this game for me right now, even though it has numerous issues. 
---
It's just so frustrating on both sides to have people ragequit. I'm a survivor main and it's especially bad for us in how much it swings things towards a killer. If they're being sweaty there's a better chance than no everyone dies.
---
But hey, BHVR is busy making sure everyone can get their David body pillows....
---
He isn't going to change that much, if you play him for bp then he probably won't change at all except for getting a speed buff. Nothing about legion is digusting, it is how people play him that can be digusting. When I play Legion everyone that doesn't quit leaves in a good mood and full of bp.
---
Lol. Everyone complaining at you using a perk is stupid. Teabagger got what she deserved. You were a nearly perkless killer all game and they are complaining about your playstyle against her and her team.
---
She already got downed in the first place but her adrenaline went off and he got her again.
---
Laziest troll on the sub lol.  You keep trying to make these bait posts happen and absolutely no one ever bites lol.  You make it too obvious man.  You need to at least pretend like you are attempting to make a sincere point if you want people to respond with outrage and take your bait lol.  F for effort but A for persistence.
---
Almost sounds like an NAT issue but generally those won't let you start a game, period.
---
Its rated for mature audiences because it's a game about murdering or being murdered. It's not made for shitheads who enjoy trying to make other people angry. You really think a developer wants their game to be full of people being BMing, teabagging pieces of shit that drive away any new players? Are you fucking delusional?
---
I agree they should take the addons away from the game but the people who are doing it and know it’s a exploit deserve the ban
---
I’ve had NAT issues before, did some port forwarding and I even checked after, my type is open.
---
In my eyes taking 2 add ons to lower transition is why people find him so bad, like you LESSEN his downside but you don't actually get a lot of the benefits add ons give to them being asleep, like no skill checks, REALLY slow progress, or wall hacks on the entire team as they start to fall asleep.
---
It's how you fall into playing him as JUST an M1 killer with a delay, and then cos nobody else is consistently asleep you get rushed because 3 other people barely even notice you exist while one is asleep in a chase.
---
Like he's still pretty shit at high tiers but he's a lot more fun at mid-low tiers when you run more effective add ons.
---
It was on Springwood in the boilerroom, it took me SO long to find and as soon as I cleansed it the killer stood still and DC'ed some people really are special.
---
It’s just no skill players like those who do the moon walk shit as legion
---
It's about time for double bloodpoints, they'd usually give more warning though.
---
Generally except in somewhat rare circumstances the survivors spawn a certain amount away from the killer so they tend to spawn somewhat close by. The chances of you spawning with at least one other survivor is quite high.  
---
This is why many Hillbillies go straight to the other side of the map and tend to instantly find people in the beginning. Corrupt intervention is also as good as it is due to this, requiring survivors to travel some distance towards the killer before finding a completeable generator.
---
Me every game I have and someone either Dc’s, plays legion with 3 hit down build, uses DS then gets caught then Dc’s, uses- you know what, no. You get it, pretty much every toxic person makes me feel like that photo
---
Until BHVR stop and discourage scummy tactics like camping and tunnelling, people will continue to DC or stop playing as survivors. Unforch, they don't give a fuck.
---
Had a dude drop the hard R word earlier.
---
Having worked with a lot of people of various mental capacities, that one always really makes me angry.
---
You are absolutely right m’lady *-tips hat-* I’m single if you’re interested🥰!
---
the thing is, that it isn't only 35 sec, it's more like 1-2 min and in rare cases more, this isn't what the devs originally intended either.
---
Why should killers have to care about fun in general?
---
This is good advice for someone wanting to try killer but IMO they should nerf the shit out of Nurse. Good Nurse + BBQ is almost unwinnable.
---
Cool I saw that and that was stated already
---
Dc then? Why are you complaining?
---
I don't think you understand how bad the infinite mend was. 
---
Every time a Legion hits you with those add-ons, it stacks the time debuff on. 
---
What starts off as 35 seconds becomes 55 seconds. Getting hit again after mending turns it into 85 &amp; so on. 
---
You end up requiring to mend for around 5 minutes or more depending on how fast gens are being completed.
---
Nice
---
Then why do they play so unsportsmanlike even when killers play fairly. Why even play survivor at point if all you're gonna do is dick around and waste everyone's time and your life?
---
Ohhh well shit my bad gonna delete my post cuz I thought it was on 35 each time thx for the info 😂
---
I just try to keep a mindset of “nothing will ever be perfect and once something is nerfed, the next best thing (billy) will be nerfed soon enough.
---
Yeah it would take a lot.
---
Legacy?
---
It is really is. The other people missed the point of my question entirely. It wasn't if they should be but if they are... Prehaps I wrote it wrong.
---
Does boil over work with open handed?
---
Do you think people who exploit bugs in games to their benefit should be banned? Just because the bug is there shouldn't mean the people who abuse it are free to do so.
---
Yes, pretty much every time I play survivor I spawn with others. I’ve also noticed killers spawning nearby a lot more often.
---
I think the context of the emote matters. Like if you're waiting at the gate, give the killer a free hit and emote then leave that's one thing. But if you emote *immediately* after juking the killer, like in this clip, that looks pretty BM.
---
While I’d normally agree with body blocking being stupid, OP could’ve just tried to evade and go to another one. They wasted way too long trying on that one.
---
Nobody mocks weebs more than weebs.
---
They don't know that until they get into the game. I don't ever see survivor DC when the killers actually play fairly.
---
Legacy clothing. It's a shiny piece that was given to you if you prestiged before a specific date meaning those guys had a bunch of hours in the game.
---
Those two would be wear I start. BBQ on either of them is hell as a survivor.
---
That and buffing Freddy.
---
You're right, though. It'll never be perfect.
---
Because it is their fault doesn’t mean you can use it... every game bans people who exploit bugs even if it is their fault.
---
*vomits happily*
---
Nice!
---
Fungoose is an amazing killer twitch streamer. He is by far one of the best killers I have evern seen &amp; takes the time to explain is thinking &amp; actions while playing.
---
He also has build discussions with specific killers if your interested in learning why he chooses specific perks. 
---
Zubatlel is another good killer player. Not as good as fungoose in my opinion but he is really talented with using slugging techniques to apply pressure. You can find some of his videos on youtube but he mainly streams on Twitch.
---
Damnnohtml on youtube/ScottJund on twitch is a friend of Zubatlel &amp; an amazing killer. He made a youtube video showing him playing Leatherface with speed limiter &amp; winning 32 games in a row as Rank 1. Very good examples of how to play an M1 killer at rank 1. 
---
Overall would suggest watching Fungoose for educational content on killer. Otherwise watching zubatlel will be another good example for high skill killer content.
---
I don’t know what that is
---
As a Huntress main : fuckin' tell me about it. You can at least M1 people with your Movespeed...
---
Does not stack with multiple people using it, but who knows how it'd interact with this bug/hack. 
---
Maybe each individual Prove thyself is giving you the bonus.
---
that perk stacking bug was so bitter sweet. I remember using it for some specific perks to see how it stacked if it did at all and specifically for ones that I'd consider worse to use all 4 spots on, such as Plunder's Instinct or I think Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
On the other hand, you'd get people stacking perks like Sprint Burst I believe and they'd go off 1 after the other for 12 seconds which in turn was absolute bullshit.
---
I still hope that one day BHVR does release different game modes with intention to just mess around and in turn let people stack 4 perks, have multiple killers, etc. A lot of the bugs are authentically fun but obviously unintended so unbalanced.
---
Oh god, how did that game go?
---
Ah, I salute the Park Rangers.
---
Tru3ta1ent
---
*lol
---
It's fully possible I'm wrong, but when the bug was around before I think stacking Self-Care would make your medkit last a super long time, but I think it made self healing WITHOUT a medkit super slow since you can heal at 50% speed so I think the speed decrease stacked as well.
---
What do you think? :P it went terrible ofc, they even sabod when I had a hook opportunity. I'm not mad tho, i take hard matches as a learning experience.
---
Zubat and ScottJund are really good killers
---
What do you mean almost as bad as the nurse? The Nurse is sick? No??
---
It's a 24h suspension lol
---
With IW Spirit is actually the easiest to get away fron
---
Yeah, I think this is part of it. It’s not just the game crashing or whatever, it’s all the terrible bugs that are in the game now - invisible generators/skill checks/hex totems, wiggle bar bug, getting stuck in trees or rocks, survivors unable to heal each other, etc. etc. If you get the wiggle bar bug for example it’s just easier to disconnect or give up and move on to the next game.
---
I agree with these sentiments.
---
when i dc wich i dont do often is mostly cuz i am getting tunneled as hell from the killer and camped wich means i cant play anyway so i dc. cuz i am getting camped and then my mate farms me cuz he got no other way and i ended up being downd insta oh well gg dc
---
Not random bud but way to get the hivemind to updoot you
---
They're all secretly gay. You might think BHVR is pulling a Rowling, but it's the truth.
---
This data is fascinating even with its limited sample size. The amount of Survivors who are disconnecting versus both the Nurse and the Hillbilly in comparison to everyone else signifies to me that people are disconnecting because of the perceived killers difficulty, not specifically because of their in-game behavior. 
---
Why else would those two killers alone be almost double or triple every other killer on the roster?
---
Yeah true. Like in this case the Jake clearly thought he was ok and being Cheeky. But there are cases where it is just a “bye!” And then a feels bad
---
Never stack BPS like that in a SWF lol. Most killers have such a huge fucking chip on their shoulder they'd rather DC than be thankful for the 400% bonus BP.
---
Does everyone think I'm just blatantly lying on here or something when I say in EVERY ONE of these games the killer is playing fairly and nothing out of the ordinary is happening?
---
This is so true it actually hurts.
---
I just bought all Ace's skins (because he's my main, fair enough) and all Nurse's skins.
---
I don't even play Nurse.
---
Its pretty much from what I know a letter characters that are in smash recieve. Watching the short cinimatics(?) they get that letter I think
---
I'm surprised there are still people playing the game with how many DCs there are.
---
I still remember the day when BHVR increased urban evasion for 150% for a few days. Ah, those were the days.
---
But do imagine people abusing Dance with me 3x or Sprint burst 3x...
---
Actually Hope 3x.
---
out of my past 40 games I'd be surprised if at least 75% didn't have at least one dc. Tempted to make a table tbh
---
If u hit a survivor your toxic...
---
I've had games with 3-4+ party streamers and people STILL d/c.  Like dude, the points you'd have gotten is four games worth dawg. Just ride it out.
---
Ok that made me cackle. Take my upvote.
---
yeah dumb af
---
r/the_donald is leaking again.
---
Can someone get the braindead incel trash out of here?
---
I did meet them most of the time but you are right. If you meet a killer that is just gonna win they might feel like leaving. I personally stay to win.
---
Did you crafted the headpiece or bought it somewhere around? Looks pretty neat!
---
Like you wouldn’t dc against a beads spirit with a ebony mori
---
she totally needs new add ons , the timer reduction is great , i find the exhaustion ones really useless , since if they are on a chase , the timer is frozen , maybe keep the mangled effect . BUT  , when the endgame arrives , she will be really powerful , so she doesn't need more powerful add ons , but nore fun!
---
Yeah i've never understood why people press their ctrl button in a video game !!!
---
...
---
Were you camping?
---
Don't so be bitter. Dying this way is way more fun than getting hooked.
---
Fun fact you can hide a trap underneath the lid of the hatch
---
Because pulling that pallet down takes SKILL, don't you know??
---
Do you have an example? He literally doesn't exist in any way except a hallucination of the Mom she even wrote the Babadook book herself (&lt;--- That's up to the viewers interpretation but it's heavily implied she wrote the book if you go watch the police station she has charcoal on her hands the book is written in charcoal.)
---
That just results in just yanking the Ethernet Cable or using task manager to force a shutdown.
---
More like Abradolf Linkler
---
I know its about playstyle but i have trued a total of 7 times to play Legion and every time after i hit one survivor they all DC within 2 minutes
---
I still feel terribly sad for Sally. She just doesn't feel anything but sorrow.
---
Sadly the community of DBD has always been toxic. It's difficult to attribute it to one cause but I guess its occurred due to the nature of the game being Asymmetrical &amp; effectively working out as survivors vs Killers. That &amp; content creators such as Ochido making humour out of bullying players in the game.
---
I suppose the biggest thing that has bred hostility from both sides is on how easy it is to bully the other side. 
---
A killer can camp, slug &amp; tunnel a single survivor multiple times during a match to ruin their gaming experience while robbing them of points. This breeds hostility towards killers from a survivors perspective instead of just breeding hostility towards the player that actually committed those actions.
---
Killer hostility usually comes from facing highly skilled survivors that makes playing the game much more stressful as applying split pressure &amp; trying to maintain that pressure while under a time limit can really make killer games stressful. What's worse is the hostility is bred by having survivors brag to the killer after the match is complete &amp; gloat to them about how poorly they played which makes killers develop hatred towards the survivor side of the community.
---
Even when showing signs of appreciating the other side such as you congratulating the killer on getting a 4k, it can be perceived as being sarcastic for the killer which can result in the "ggez" response.
---
Cool beans, but what's your concept on how he'll see over the tall grass? Lol
---
A few days ago I took a Billy with good maneuverability add ons to Leary’s when he brought a ColdWind offering. He was so upset and gave up pretty quickly, so he went to the basement to guard the chest like a Basement Bubba for the rest of the game. 
---
I donated my only purple flashlight at the base of one of the hooks to say sorry before escaping.
---
How is that an issue affecting killers? And even if it was I should be able to have some say in who I play with. Who wants to go into a match knowing your gonna have a miserable time of it. Killers can avoid specific survivors so it should work the same way around.
---
I mean you were acting like noed played any significance in that scenario, so I'm surprised
---
What annoys me the most out of dcs is nobody wins off the situation. As killer I've had all four survivors dc and I depip or have one dc and not be able to get past gold devout. 
---
As survivor you're basically crippled being a 3 man that early and give an easy snowball to the killer. 
---
Great job getting stats. By any chance did you track ping as a factor?
---
When killers play out 2 mans as full try hard, yikes
---
The timer gets paused whenever chased/hooked but not reset
---
One of the biggest mistakes I ever made was joining the DBD subreddit. But yes. The community has only gotten so much worse over time. And it’s quite literally killing/destroying the game.
---
You're a smart cookie, man
---
It’s cool to see killers as survivor alter egos
---
Do you really wanna play against 3 iridescent hatchets, prayer beads or franks mixtape as it is right now. Camping and tunneling are not fun to play against those ruin the game as a whole.
---
I think that the timer just pauses instead of resetting, but I'm not sure. It could be that Claudette was hooked when her tiner was really low
---
On ps4 its r1 without mapping
---
You should put up how many times total you faced each killer to know roughly what the percentages are for DC's for each killer
---
I didn't realise you died if you don't get the reverse trap off, thought you just got downed! Seems like i don't play against the pig enough!
---
Wouldn’t be a killer game without that DC
---
They look good! Definitely would keep doing gens a bit more interesting. The only problem I see would be with the skill check that you keep your cursor over, this would be near impossible on controllers because the joysticks just aren't that precise.
---
When you are healing inside a pallet you don't throw it down
---
"There should be a way to dodge a killer I dont like"
---
how about no.
---
Sure
---
Yeah. Killer is supposed to go afk in the basement if even one survivor does not connect.
---
People do it to farm WGLF stacks and to be dick bags. But yes, also potatos-**Err** I mean...silly Survivors.
---
Imagine those more complicated ones on console...
---
Yes, I left the DC on purpose, because yall are complaining about the DC wave that has been going around lately and I am all for punishing dc’ers. But when shit like this happens I just close the fucking game and try to convince myself to not delete it.
---
Good one. Let me look into my stats.
---
Everythibg was green/yellow no one was red.
---
I play on PS4 too but it’s like r1 or something
---
Read the fucking post idiot, he is referring to killer’s names not killers themselves
---
I don’t see the pallet
---
So nobody dced due to lag. 
---
Interesting fact, if you hear the dc noise it was intentional. if you don't it wasn't
---
Heart it. I made sure everything was perfectly tested.
---
Knowing the killer you are going against would be op, on the other hand knowing the killer player you are going against would be really useful, but then a lot of toxic killer mains would eventually run out of people to play with, and this is why your idea wont find much support here
---
Don't know if 173 would really work. I'd perfer a lesser known SCP but it'd probably have to be a more well known one so my vote goes out to SCP-106.
---
Well, if it’s any consolation we had a discussion a little while ago that made your name stand out as one of the most reasonable people I’ve seen on this page. Most people are kinda just faceless and I treat them case by case. 
---
I think the problem is just that you there really isn’t a way to communicate even when you have a great game. I finished a freddy build recently and went to test it, ended up facing a twitch streamer. I was like oh great I can see what this is like after, see if it’s actually a scary build. 
---
Our chat was mostly just, gg that was a strong build. But when I watched our map, they were actually pretty genuine telling their chat it was a good build and a good game even though he died, that he actually had fun facing a freddy. 
---
Another aspect, to quote my boss. “If a person has a great experience they might tell one or two people. If they have a bad experience, they’ll go out of their way to tell the world” In that case, just look to the fact that even when people complain they’re logging in the next day, so most people are having a good time, even if it’s quietly.
---
I thought I was the only one that wanted an SCP chapter. Awesome picture!
---
Dc‘d faster than a gunshot lmao
---
Ok 1. I’d be content with just seeing their name. On console the process of changing it is annoying enough that people would be unlikely to change it often
---
2. If your afraid of good killers go play Animal Crossing. If your a killer who can reliably destroy teams just by playing the game the way it was intended more power to you and you deserve your win. What I’m talking about are killers who refuse to engage with the games hunting and chasing mechanic. We’ve all run into them from time to time and they’re annoying AF
---
Thanks! I also made a survivor and wanted to Call the chapter Servants Of The Dark but the survivor wasn't detailed enough, the survivor would've been called The Bartender.
---
All this Freddy lying around
---
Why does most people hate yamaoka idgi?It's a good map
---
You're the best man. Have you posted anything on r/dataisbeautiful before?
---
Good. Nerf him more. Not useless enough.
---
I never give up on Léry's, but it takes a good bit of luck to do well. Was it a Thompson's Moonshine + Doom Engravings setup?
---
All I want is to be able to see their names. If suddenly they can’t get games because they’re being toxic POS’ then they’ll be forced to play fairly or pay the $10 or whatever to change their names and start the process all over again
---
He is definitely one of the most fun killers to play in the game. With having a very small terror radius you will find that you will catch survivors off guard if they do not have LOS of you &amp; when chasing can use your tier 3 to instantly down survivors which is really strong, especially if multiple survivors are close to you allowing you to snowball the game.
---
He is debatably one of the best M1 killers in the game &amp; has some great perk viability. Personally, he is one of my favourite killers in the game because of his aesthetic, lack of terror radius &amp; unique chase music that makes you feel like an actual killer.
---
His perks are not that great with the exception of STBFL. STBFL is really good for reducing the amount of time you spend chasing survivors but its not game changing. Fun perk to use though.
---
Dying light is pretty weak as it requires you to tunnel the obsession to the ground. By the time you kill the obsession usually you will have 2 to 3 gens done meaning ruin is usually a better option for slowing gens down.
---
PWYF seems rather weak. Increased movement speed is great but you lose the tokens too quickly to make any use out of it. Maybe it would be good on 1 hit killers like the cannibal or the plague but overall mediocre perk at best.
---
I don't know anyone that dislikes playing him, most players I know enjoy playing him, he also has addons that change things up for him.
---
Safest T Walls in existence lol.  Killers I am sincerely trying to help you all out.  Just say no to attempting mindgames through visible walls.  We can see your glow.  You are just giving us additional loops.  Help me help you.
---
the most upset grunt i’ve ever heard would be the one to make me laugh the hardest.
---
I get stuck all the time. As killer and survivor. For example, the small grim pantry stairs, or the back of utes/pick ups on Autohaven....but leaving your team hanging with 4 gens, against Billy on preschool is weeeeaaaaak.
---
It's called not being a douche. The game is at it's best balance at 4v1. 5 survivors, and killer is extremely disadvantaged. 3 survivore or less, killer has a huge advantage where it is much less of a challenge to kill all survivors. 
---
For example take Lego Starwars. When you unlock the ghost jedi and realize you take 0 dmg the game instantly becomes no fun because now there is no adversity. Going back to DBD, when I play killer and see 3 or less survivors, I know they are screwed and that is not the fault of the survivors. I would rather give them a break and get points for everybody and let them get out so they aren't punished for the other person(s) not making it into the game.
---
Really?! Holy cow that’s more than I knew!! Last time I checked I had bobs and vegana, holy moly!!! 😱😱😱
---
Nice sarcasm. You could just down survivors, then pick up/drop them repeatedly so they know you aren't going to play it out for real. Then get your 2 hooks on everybody, let them get max heals/bold, you get max hit/chase/deviousness, then they escape and everybody gets a nice break. Playing 3 or less survivor games is the most boring gimped way to play killer and I'll never let myself play those out for real. There's just 0 point.
---
I agree.  
---
I play both killer and survivor so I know both sides can be toxic, but I see it waaaaaayy more from survivors.
---
Curious, what was the build? Was it the Sloppy/Ruin/BBQ/Monitor one?
---
Also yeah it's good to get a reminder. It's a difficult piece of human psychology that good things tend to affect you less in the short-term than bad things.
---
You're*
---
Yeah I am more main survivor now as I suck as killer haha. I wouldn't want to know who the killer is though as then you can predict who they are going as and that ruins part of the game for me.
---
so do you have a stat fetish? not judging.
---
??
---
Yeah I agree doctor would probably like anime but he would probably still make fun of weebs.
---
Killer BP Guide:
---
- Stop caring about kills and whack people with your ability as much as possible
---
- BBQ and Chili
---
Best BP farmers (my opinion):
---
- Myers/Doc for easy deviousness. Distressing makes this ridiculous
---
- Wraith for everything, ability hits grant brutality and deviousness points while coming out of invisibility will net you the 300 points for survivor found EVERY time (means you can cloak/uncloak to farm it)
---
I love how 1 survivor thinks he/she is looping me but feeds me every pallet on the map in the first 5 min and others does the gens furthest away so I can do the 3 Gen strategy with no pallet around
---
You could make a better quality version in SFM instead. 💁🏻‍♀️
---
ALL AROUND ME ARE FAMILIAR FACES!
---
(just let traps still work in gates, &amp; idk, maybe speed up the collapse timer)
---
Same on the killer side for dcs. Getting tired of losing rank just because survivors dc before their first hook
---
A certain streamer complained about survivors deranking a few months ago, and now he’s deranking as killer. Some other streamers have been making fun of him, called him a hypocrite, etc., and he’s mad about it. They’re all arguing on twitter and everyone involved looks kind of stupid.
---
\&gt;Implying this guy is joking.  
---
This goes beyond humour, friend. This is some deep, underlying hatred he needs to bring up the next time he goes to a psychologist.
---
Lmao nah, wouldn't have the same effect as your vid
---
Or you can just kill them and get to proper match faster.
---
Some people just want to move on to the next game as quickly as possible.
---
How, bout now?
---
No, but you deal with it. There's lots of broken shit in a lot of games, but dbd is the only one ive ever seen where everyone just thinks its acceptable to quit. Thats not even what I'm talking about tho, people literally dc over any little thing and its such bullshit. Theyve gotta do something about it.
---
What a good game
---
when endgame comes they'll have a limited time of only 3 minutes of bm.
---
It’s annoying that survivors are able to complete more than one gen? Seems reasonable.
---
Sure but it's still a big F you to the survivor from the game. And then it feels extra shitty when the killer won't even at the very least let you get a few gens and saves done for a safety pip. It won't matter come next patch, but there is a kind way of handling it as killer, and then a non kind way.
---
You had 2 other boxes to go to so why were you staying on this one? It might not be the right one anyway. When you started touching that totem, if the pig was blocking correctly, you wouldn't even be able to get out from that corner. Just leave next time.
---
I never DC in a game so I don't even know if it actually still does it or not. I just see many people say this and I was under the impression that it was intentional, it may be a bug.
---
it's not just about deranking. It's also now about BM. The entirety of DBD-twitter is now a fucking cesspool.
---
Do you guys know what's thw worst in thw whole situation ? Even if they do something about the dc /which they wont in my opinion/ people still can just kill themselves on the hook right away and the effect is going to be the same /like the dc/ - we still gonna be fucked
---
The problem is the game is so broken right now you STILL get bloodpoints when you DC. At least if you pull your internet that is, and you keep your item. Needs fixing big time.
---
I still don't understand how can Nurse see anything.
---
Won't even matter come next match, but if the game ends way too fast, everybody depips and gains nothing. And in particular I had a 2 man earlier where a person played party streamers, so now their offering just got wasted because the killer didn't care, and you can't tell me that doesn't feel shitty. Is it a requirement to farm? No, but it is something nice to consider so that the survivor isn't being punished for the game not working.
---
I can't help but disagree. He's not toxic, tries not to tunnel (From what I've watched anyway, which granted isn't much) and most of his complaints seem legitimate. 
---
Of the complaints I've seen from him:
---
Farm maps: if you think farm maps don't heavily favour survivor you're quite wrong
---
DCs: definetely an issue right now
---
Lag: while this one is somewhat dependant on the killers connection having a bad connection can force you to drop pallets early, miss skill checks/great skill checks (ruin is a pain with 200+ ping)
---
I don't understand how Killer can get tilted by this. Pressing a button is so bad!
---
She doesn’t, so she sits in silence lol :)
---
Inb4 the doc is a legion and everyone dc’s
---
Doing them a favour, but whatever makes you feel better.
---
He has incredible build diversity, most perks work on him and his add ons are wild. 
---
Most killer add ons feel like they just tweak some numbers. Faster/more charges a speed boost or exhaustion effect here and there. Meanwhile, Myers alters from having massive terror radius and the ability to instakill, to being the stealthiest killer in the game. heck, he doesn’t even trigger spine chill in tier 1, amazing. 
---
I am biased, he’s my main.
---
If survivors don’t cooperate when I try to help them and they’re the last one, I down them, shake my head no at them, and hit what I’m telling them to do. After they finish, I throw a hatchet in the direction I want them to go, and then I get them up and make sure they follow me. If they don’t I down them then shake my head no again. By then, they normally start to listen lmao
---
I guess if it was intentional the devs wouldn't want to admit it, regardless, since it would encourage the behavior. Not that anything seems to be stopping these rampant DCs anyway. :/
---
Maybe the dc’er/crasher put that offering
---
So a problem about your answer to farm maps is that Killer is supposed to have the position of power, it should be their mistakes that make chases longer, not survivors. One good survivor can loop you forever on farm maps, even just pig tree can waste easily a minute. Now ofc you should abandon someone who's looping you really well but if all 4 people are like that good luck. 
---
I don't know actually anything he's said on twitter as I don't go on twitter. I've seen a few videos from some of the YouTubers you mentioned. I do think Zubat is good but he's had some of the same complains mentioned above (IE: "thanks game")
---
And about endgame collapse, I think it's not a bad idea to throw ideas around but personally it's unfair to judge it before you've tried it.
---
Did you not watch his reaction video? He definitely understood the purpose of what they were trying to do in ending standoffs.
---
No it was the person who made it in with me. But all the same it's a waste of party streamers.
---
I mean... the Entity is probably one of the most powerful SCPs, if they were to exist in the same universe.
---
Ah I remember all those kobe man Ace with these things before Deliverance came out.
---
i feel you
---
Damn, I hope it did not happened again. Was quite fun to see as survivor, but literally unplayable as a killer.
---
So you've been playing for two years and you're just now complaining about something that doesn't even matter?
---
If you have noticed it for two fucking years, it obviously isn't an issue that needs looked at
---
They can and will. Welcome to what a E X P L O I T is!
---
Hitboxes aren't always the issue either, sometimes a bit of lag will make your hitboxes wonky. I know I've gotten a few hits that I shouldn't have before.  
---
I think it's good to criticize the game because if you just sing praise 24/7 nothing will get fixed. I'd rather have someone who constantly talks about what's wrong than someone that doesn't.
---
Why do you care so much about your rank
---
You say that but I use that with the Freddy add on that starts one person in the dream world them people DC because they think it’s a mori lol.
---
Will do. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Well, on a serious note, some survivors will bitch regardless of what you do so just do whatever you want
---
Not getting any RBT kills becasue the survivors DC to quick.
---
No I don't watch his content any longer because I think it's garbage. But there's a difference in offering ideas/suggestions versus demanding/complaining about tweaks made to something not even tested yet.
---
So what, one survivor just keeps looking atthis badboi and he cant move the entire game?
---
BM? How? Some people will argue about literally anything.
---
1. Because it’s a ranked game?
---
2. There’s less bullshit and better teamwork in the higher ranks and just in general a more fun and challenging game experience
---
He's a pizza cutter; all Edge, no Point.
---
I meant as in it’s so easy to pip that depipping a game is nothing
---
*Orangemanbad.jpg*
---
I said in the very comment you replied to that I just noticed it. Because I only recently started using an aura build for stealth. 
---
Either stop being an ass and fuck off or actually try seeing where I'm coming from so we can have a conversation. If you're tilted over my comment and opinion on how the perk should work, guess what?  You aren't obligated to comment dude. You can scroll right on by and save everyone the time.
---
thank you
---
And survivors dodge every lobby if their ping is over 150ms. You know why?
---
Because they know it's gonna fucking suck
---
Same with SWF, killers would just rather just not go through that stress and try to have fun. I feel like that's better than actually getting into a game, shitting on them, and then get no points and have all that time wasted when they DC
---
He will be S+ tier because there are no pallets or windows
---
Yeah but it’s just annoying
---
True, gotta save those for double bps
---
So, you're saying the developers can't ban people who're INTENTIONALLY abusing an in-game exploit? And er...the EULA which no one ever reads, because reading's overrated has this to say what actually confirms they're in their damn right to do so; "Interfere with the ability of others to enjoy playing a BHVR Service or take actions that interfere with or materially increase the cost to provide a BHVR Service for the enjoyment of all its users." 
---
Utilising this exploit violates that completely, so the player intentionally abusing it loses their right to even complain about it.
---
Np
---
Nurse had the advantage and people hate her, and for good reason. If every killer was like Nurse, the game would die. It's asymmetrical so you will never have a 50/50 split of balance. But if it is slightly survivor sided, which it is, the survivors have the advantage as a whole, which means 4 parts have to do their job correctly. 
---
Take Death Garden, heavily killer sided balance, game died before it even made it to launch. Not to say all survivors should be able to run circles around killers carelessly, but if a team of survivors do everything right and still can't "win", then they will stop playing out of frustration. Then killer lobbies will have no survivors to fill their lobbies.
---
Where's the bullyhunters when you need them?
---
The Devs do make so interesting decisions, they didn’t harm the game at all they were literally showing off the glitch and helped the Devs
---
Biggest jump I've literally ever seen.
---
Devs said they're making it to where everyone is auto disconnect at loading screen if it's a 3v1. So starting with fewer at least will hopefully be solved. Maybe they'll add something for disconnect as well with this coming patch/ptb tomorrow.
---
It’s range is really small, it’s only in front of the locker. Head on determines if it’s a stun at the activation of the perk. The stun seems a big range because the animation plays of the survivor rushing out THEN the stun plays. 
---
Also very impressive, i tried it against Freddy and got grabbed :/
---
The last thing I wanna see is my loading bar at 10% with my logo infinitely loading
---
what about my the doctor
---
I don't watch many dbd youtubers or streamers, but I enjoy watching HybridPanda. He's a killer main, but plays both. I think he's really good at explaining perks and builds
---
:/
---
You need new friends
---
The amount of freaking times I hatchet a hidden Claudette by accident...
---
I wish more people would realize this:
---
&gt; (i know I’ll get downvotes for saying those who camp are pathetic but these are my feelings)
---
Camping is only a viable strategy after the doors are opened/powered. What is the killer supposed to do, go patrol gens that aren't even relevant to the game anymore? Patrols doors that are on the opposite sides of the map that you can't circle back and forth to in the 20 seconds it takes to open them up?
---
If the doors aren't powered, there is a ton of ways of going about things that are more relevant to the state of the game. If they are, there usually isn't anything else the Killer can do.
---
If a Killer tells you camping is a legit strategy and did it prior to the gens being done, he's an idiot. If you're complaining about being camped after the gens are done, you're an idiot. (Not you specifically. The Generic You)
---
I think my favorite throw hands down was up and over the lip of the mothers dwelling catwalk, right where the gen is. The rank 2 claudette was in so much shock I made the hit she didn't bother struggling. 
---
Man, that was a satisfying throw. Perfect curve.
---
&gt;The Devs do make so interesting decisions, they didn’t harm the game at all they were literally showing off the glitch and helped the Devs
---
If they wanted to do that, they could've easily privately shown the video to devs or used support for that. 
---
By publicly showing how to do it, they didn't help devs at all, they just created more work for them. 
---
Well deserved.
---
Honestly at this point I will play dbd for at least some considerable amount of time only if new modes/activities emerge. New chapters can't get me hooked for a long time anymore, sadly
---
I mean my teammates in general. Been playing solo
---
They didn’t publicly show how to do it though? They just showed gameplay of it
---
I think OP meant movement speed wise without blinking
---
I might hehe :)
---
This needs more upvotes, your style is bloody incredible!
---
Or you know, you could just keep playing, get as many bloodpoints as possible and go on to the next match because it’s just a game FFS. 
---
Don’t get me wrong I know it’s broken and needs to be fixed but DCing on purpose is a pussy move IMO.
---
Why should survivors be forced to play a trial against a killer player they've gone against previously and had a miserable time with? 
---
Op wants to see the user name, not the character they play. And I agree with op on that. There's some *players* who main killer and consistently just make the game unfun. I should be able to dodge a specific player I've had issues with. The killer can dodge lobbies they don't like the look of, we should be able to dodge players we don't enjoy playing against.
---
I finally got BBQ without needing to buy Leatherface and it showed up in my Huntress Bloodweb the very next level, I had a 4k with my level 1 Trapper with nothing but first-level Agitation on Lery's and got like 7 traps for my Ritual, I had two really good matches as Billy where I finally learned how to use his chainsaw sprint and had nothing but Sloppy Butcher level 1 on him, and I got a PS Plus deal for 2 unrelated games (one was even the Ultimate edition!) for $8 rather than the $25 I was gonna spend on just one of them. Feeling very good this week.
---
At low ranks where killers are almost guaranteed to tunnel off hook? It gets used all the time to great effect.
---
&gt;They didn’t publicly show how to do it though? They just showed gameplay of it
---
&gt;Me and Luc was the first ones to preform the "multible killer glitch" and we both got 24h ban. It's funny how we didn't do the glitch after I released the video.
---
Judging by his tweet, he did show how to do the glitch on his video. 
---
Also before typing this reply, I went to check this video and he actually shows a few steps there. 
---
Once again, well deserved.
---
Here's a tip from a huntress main:
---
A) put a tiny marker (tape, post it) dead center of your screen. You'll see your aim improve drastically when you have a pseudo crosshair. 
---
B) practice throwing. Only way you'll improve. One suggestion I've heard is throwing every time you get a BBQ proc. Eventually you'll hit them. 
---
Mind you, I say this and I'm still ass at cross map hatchets. xD
---
The killer can just change their name every match.. not hard to do on computer atleast.
---
Holy shit I thought this was a collection of screenshots at first! Amazing cosplay; you look simultaneously lovely yet chilling!
---
Why are 10 years old kids allowed to play dbd and post in reddit?
---
Idk why it matters anyway. Dude is banned for 1 day. He's inconvenienced at best lol

---
it was because of a clip of a streamer making rather.... interesting suggestions on how to "stop" BM in the game, which another streamer may or may not have poked fun of.
---
Infinite loading screens, matches starting with less than 5 players, and disconnects are very bad right now. In the [Developer Update](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019) they said starting with the mid-chapter patch (which is coming very soon, the PTB for it is tomorrow, the 23rd) games will be cancelled if they start out with missing players. Of course, that won't help if someone disconnects at the start of the match if they get downed instantly or once they find out it's a legion or a nurse or whoever. That's just people being babies, honestly. Maybe they won't disconnect against Legion after his update.
---
The only way to fix disconnects is with harsher disconnect penalties, but that is hard to do right now with the infinite loading screen and crashes ruining so many games. Infinite loading screens count as disconnects for the affected player when they close the game, so I imagine they're being very lenient with punishments right now.
---
As for losing pips and offerings when killers d/c, yeah, that's a problem they need to fix. Hopefully they'll fix that when dedicated servers finally come.
---
But pc isn't the only platform and we really need to stop doing things just for pc. It's difficult to do that on console and honestly, we paid for this game. We don't want people to keep dcing. It would fix at least a few people from doing that and it's an unknowingly needed qol change, a big one for consoles. It would also be a way to force players to play and keep others enjoyment in mind, because as we all know, it's a game. Challenging yes, frustrating at times yes, but we shouldn't be forced to be miserable because of players who consistently go out of their way to ruin the game for everyone else.
---
A str8-facts title on a dank meme? Take the upvote.
---
How do you feel knowing that with the new endgame mechanics killer would get the hatch 100% in this case and you would be dead?
---
I would feel good not wasting an hour and a half. :)
---
The reason it works against other killers is because other killers aren't Freddy
---
Freddy's greatest and probably only strength is being able to track without being tracked. You don't know where he's coming from and you don't need to because he's a trash baby killer and you'll probably be fine
---
Wraith has decent mobility and has pretty good mind games at loops. Pig can strike quickly and slow the game down with her traps. Being able to see where they are sometimes is *fine* because they have other strengths
---
There, *that* is why it's inconsistent. This isn't a change that needs to be made
---
You can BM, but you can’t BM and stand in the exit gates waiting for the killer to come by just so you can BM and leave. That’s called holding the game hostage. 
---
You shouldn’t BM, but if you want to be a prude, then yes, it’s not against the rules.
---
That’s why I dc’d tho cuz it’s just a game
---
I hadn't played for a couple seasons and was reset back to 20, this doesn't happen anywhere near as much as you'd think
---
You are not being consistent in your logic. 
---
“Solo survivors even when they are decent are boring stomps im most of the matches, swf with comms is the only thing that ever really poses a challenge at this point.”
---
“Dbd is not a competetive game, it's more of a party game that you play with friends.”
---
“If you balance killer around 4 men with comms and good cooperation you'll destroy this game's casual playerbase.”
---
So, solo players get stomped, SFW are the only ones that stand a chance, most casual players are SWF, but if you add coms (Essentially making them all SWF) you will destroy the player base?
---
I think you are getting emotional and not looking at the points I was making (or that you are making for that matter). If you actually listen to my points, you would see we are basically in agreement. 
---
As to Deathgarden and balancing, you do realize that balancing can be fixed, right?  Deathgarden was not killed because of balancing, it is still in development. It is a small, obscure game IN ALPHA without much fanfare or advertisement.
---
Sorry, I dont understand you. You can't download files? I can also upload to Dropbox if you need
---
2 Times Legion ... your Brain is small
---
He already drags the game out, that’s why people DC. It’s a long ass game where all 4 survivors get out (when they don’t DC) with little to no challenge but it takes fucking forever coz you’re stopping every second to mend.
---
If it hits endgame and all 4 surfs are alive, the killer would be lucky to get one kill, unless your team messes up real hard. If they dont have any endgame perks, the killer's done for. All the survivors have to do is open one of two exit gate for 16/20 seconds(I'm not sure of the exact time), and leave. They made two exit gates so the killer cant just camp one, and with most killers, it takes well over 10 seconds to travel from one exit gate to the other, which is another 10 seconds going back, so you have enough time if you wait for them to leave and patrol the other one. If they have remember me or blood warden or whatever, you will have a much higher chance of dying in the end game, but that's the perk's job, right? And the killer is sacrificing perk slots for endgame perks, so they're playing with less perks mid game. The endgame collapse is to get rid of teabaggers and anyone who lingers after the game basically ends, but they just dont want to leave. It's just so people cant hold the game hostage. The game has never been killer sided, but bHVR is doing a great job of balancing it out. Btw, what is the reason you said the endgame is killer sided anyway? I'm just wondering, that's all.
---
&gt;Idk why it matters anyway. Dude is banned for 1 day. He's inconvenienced at best lol
---
There is also [this](https://i.imgur.com/BVNhliD.jpg). He was fully aware of the consequences of reproducing a bug **multiple** times and even on a Public Match. Now he acts as if BHVR was a villain for suspending his account. Guess he did care about his account in the end.
---
I'm not saying it *has* to be, I'm just saying I *personally* would like of it was a perk that reads aura based on if a killer currently has a heartbeat terror radius. That's all. That's literally all. I'm not saying I want to force the devs to change shit or that I wanna uninstall the game because of it, that's petty. There's literally no reason to insult or talk down to me. Yet you did it before actually understanding what I was saying and without *actually reading* the reply you directly responded to.
---
This sub is pretty skewed to side with the killers. They kinda love being victims which is... ironic.
---
Add me on steam and lets play. I am also tired of this. :(
---
I love little things like this. Just a nice quick visual to go with "tremendously, considerably, slightly" haha. Simple and clean bruh
---
Well they showed the World that this Bug ist possible and with that big Community theres No way someone wouldnt try to recreate it and Share it 
---
I got Banned to but theres No Bann time shown Just No Connection...
---
The difference is SO underwhelming. I can’t believe I ever cared about losing a purple toolbox.
---
I was just making a suggestion that honestly would balance it for killers more and make It a more interesting perk to use. It freaked me out at first when I notice it, and when I made this post, then after thinking about it I thought "hey, it would be p neat if it worked this way instead".
---
A good friend of mine always said “In order to get better, play against people better than you.”
---
I'm glad somebody actually even remembers that.
---
The problem is, though, that idea was created before the "Endgame Collapse" which would require the original idea to be changed. Maybe not much, but still.
---
That's a thing? Do you not receive the pip penalty as well?
---
I didn’t know people hated nurse that much
---
This format looks familiar...
---
Meh, the blocking/dodging killer thing has already been tried and done and people kept dodging lobbies where the killer was actually good, We had a ping indicator and a block tool which was officially endorsed by the developers and a few months after endorsement the devs had "expressed their distaste for a block feature" and requested he removed it from the program, so it was only a ping indicator.
---
Damn that's gonna leave a mark.
---
No seriously that really good.
---
I think you replied to the wrong person but yes!
---
I replied to you cos you were getting downvoted for saying something accurate.
---
I think it's called "replacing the items, add-ons and perks icon"
---
I enjoyed the game till I got to the subreddit. I'm on ps4 so I don't get salt messages at all basically. I've gotten one in two years. 
---
Come onto the subreddit (after also being in a Facebook group and on dbd twitter) and this Reddit has made me miserable with the game. A lot of people here are toxic, selfish, and honestly kinda assholes. God forbid you have a wrong opinion, you will get raked over the coals to hell and back. And I feel like there's nothing the devs can do about it, and there's nothing we can do about it. These people don't care that they're making others miserable in game or on here either, they just say "lulz uninstall". It's old. It's grating. The player base will be the death of this game well before any glitch, bug, messed up killer, perk addon, anything the devs do.
---
let me just die as a dolo and add the 3 other survivors to tell them what he has.
---
I don't like farming so when I get asked if I wanna farm I agree, switch to leatherface then purge them with a big chainsaw slap
---
I made an entire DLC chapter idea on DBDs guide page on steam. It got a lot of praise and was based around 106 as the killer
---
Well, yes, I was talking about situations like that as the exceptions.
---
I just find it too exaggerated a reaction when people get triggered by it unless it was used in the way you said.
---
Hopefully they do fix it. I hadn't played since before legion/plague so maybe a patch messed  something up. Hope the next patch fixes things for everyone.
---
Bad Manners, videogame term for disrespectful cunts
---
I’m during digestion of legion add-ons.
---
Good to know it(probably)isn't my internet. I've been taking screens of the after report screens as proof that it says the killer left rather me voluntarily DC'ing. Hopefully that's enough to cover my ass if I'm getting reported. I'll check that bug thread ASAP.
---
I'm going to upvote every single post that talks about this until the community takes it seriously lol.
---
There's a thread on the DBD forums about this. I've had this issue since Friday, but nothing about my internet has changed. I get kicked out of 80% of my games, and I've seen survivors being kicked out as well (no sound when DC).
---
I hope the devs are going to work on this before releasing the endgame collapse, because this is a gamebreaking bug.
---
The only way Urban Evasion will ever be useful
---
Y did u kill me
---
Feels like a joke. I literally have a dead by daylight tattoo as you can see in my post history, and I'm at 2000 hours as of this month. I don't deserve to be banned when I spend a ton of money on this game and contribute to the playerbase.
---
When is anyone's guess, but according to [this post](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/11/activities-and-livestream-roadmap) on the forums, the surprise will be "ON FORUMS / SOCIAL MEDIA," so it'll probably be posted under the "News" section on the forums and on their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR). If it's worthy of a longer announcement video, like the end game collapse stuff, it'll probably be on youtube, but nobody knows at this point. I'd just check the subreddit in a couple of hours. I doubt anything will be announced before noon EST.
---
Not a rumor, they literally said that on ERB News last week
---
Might have been bannes for hacked legacy, multiple killers in a game exploit or for legion exploit, you never mentioned any of these things.. but i feel bad for u
---
no easy way to fix until dedicated servers as the game can't tell if you disconnected or the killer did
---
Aside from the wiring skill check, they’re all doable with a controller in my view.
---
she dc's 'cause she got outplayed by a Hag then i'm pretty sure the other did it as well 'cause they didn't want to have a 3v1 match
---
It sounds like you play on console.  You on PS4?
---
Ye
---
The speed of the dot could be adjusted to accomodate controllers
---
Then they face camp anyway
---
These are skill checks that should only take less than 5 seconds to complete at a time
---
I will just leave this here
---
[Samination DBD Parody 5](https://youtu.be/Vd_3JmDoKNc)
---
this should be there next patch, they said it a week ago
---
Dude you can totally look up the killers name in the lobby then unless they have their settings blocked.  Just hit the playstation button go to players than party and you can see your own lobby.  Just look for the name that isn't the survivor.  I used to do this back when I was immersed and couldn't run a killer to avoid some of the facecamping babydick trashcans.  Nowadays I'm actually pretty nice at chases so they don't bother me.  They gotta catch me first if they want the camps.
---
I dont think any of us play games for a dose of reality friend but you do you.. plus ya know it's a game, suspension of disbelief is pretty standard
---
Outplayed by Hag? More like outnerfed by devs
---
Congrats my dude! Hope to go against you and your bing bongs soon.
---
no im saying if they were bad you should not rank up. Ranking up should only happen if you're good, thats the point of being a higher rank. Killing 4 noobs doesn't prove your good does it? and honestly now that I think about it the only way you didn't pip in a 4K with 5 gens left is you camped the hook multiple times. Would make sense why you black pipped. So yeah you don't deserve a pip if you camped.
---
Simply finding a survivor first causes docs anymore so until they decide to take major action against this.. welcome to dead by dc
---
Looking at the stats, you’ve listed 8 killers instead of 7 and none were nurses... I think the DCs have finally made you insane
---
Thank you so much for this ! I always wonder whats better to put on Engineer's Toolbox - 15 + 30 charges or 30 + repair efficiency/ or 30 + speed/ - this one will be way harder to tell even if recorded
---
You still get a pip
---
survivor kinda sucks now
---
There's literally no reason NOT to DC other than morality.
---
Are you going to do one on killer, the way you did survivor? And what platform are you using btw?
---
Right? Like I didn't even hate Legion thaaat much but what they did to him... They took his power, like all of it
---
I think a lot of people think everyone is DC’ing. A lot of the time they just get kicked for no reason. Happened a lot to me this week
---
I thought it was The Plague conception art
---
Damn this cosplay is the best 
---
If they make a movie about the game you should be the Plague
---
Maybe if I play Insidious Hag and guard the basement chest all game they will be ok with that?
---
Essentially what the other guy said- levels 30, 35, 40 unlock the unique perks for that killer/survivor for other killers/survivors. However, if you go into the store you’ll see the Shrine or Secrets. It’s page of four perks that refresh weekly; the perks can be bought with iridescent shards (which you get from levelling up), and they’re all unique perks that, once purchased, are instantly available to find in the bloodwebs for every killer/survivor (depending on the perk you bought). So, if you want BBQ and Chili but a) don’t want to buy Leatherface and/or b) don’t want to level him up to 35 just for that perk, you can unlock it in this week’s shrine.
---
well,then people will start to pull the plug,no big difference here.
---
Sure it looks underwhelming, but it does so because of the small amount they can work on to begin with. How much difference would you like? 20 seconds? Its already just a lousy minute, gens get fixed by solo survivors without a toolbox so fast that ruin is virtually mandatory, and even with ruin it doesnt take that long.
---
When a bug allowed this, people *did* stack tons of sprint burst.
---
It was insane.
---
And then the other ladies vote her out of the game in a shit twist.
---
HALLELOOOO indeed.
---
Idk what it is
---
Hahah he removed it!
---
So survivors are not allowed to say what they think? What kind of nazi logic ist that
---
At which ranks (more or less) did most games take place?
---
Maybe they're releasing a liscenced killer. I've heard speculation Th eyre working with lionsgate I think it is. Perhaps were getting one killer this year, and the devs will spend the rest of the year working on fixing the game instead of adding chapters. It's in a good place to do so with the number of characters we have right now, and makes sense to me since we haven't gotten a roadmap yet for this year.
---
yeap
---
Is there an ETA on dedicated servers?
---
Cheat. Using cheat engine.
---
It was a bug back in the day
---
You should see my Steam profile, pages of angry comments from people I dealt with as Killer because I didn't follow their made up rules or they feel like them being bad needs an excuse or crutch to hold onto.  
---
I find it hilarious and each comment I consider a trophy.
---
Yeah I feel like at least 50-60% of ps players keep things private. Most of the time I’ll do what you said and there’ll be max 2 players listed there
---
BBQ was in the shine of secrets a few days ago and lemme tell ya that was the fastest purchase in the west
---
What?
---
__Hahah he removed it!__
---
You can say what you want. Doesnt make it true.
---
And of course the one that DC'd is one of two people in the game with 4 perks, with multiple characters' worth of teachables, DCing against a literal first game Wraith.
---
I despise these type of people
---
Until you look at the patch notes since last year and notice survivors not getting buffed once and killers plenty of times?
---
You should probably layoff the p**n there pal.
---
r/dankmemes hasn’t had a dark meme in at least a year.
---
Yeah I never really got the whole sweaty thing.  I remember one time I got messaged post game for being a sweaty killer.  I didn't camp, tunnel, or use Noed crutch I simply beat that ass, pretty sure they were swf.  I asked them to elaborate how I was sweaty and they basically just kept typing lol and tryhard at me.  Some survivors just can't handle losing.
---
The Babadook manifests to anyone experiencing the stages of grief. He may seem like a mental hallucination but it is implied in the movie he can manifest if you've seen the moment where the mother stands up to him as well as the bowl of worms in the ending.
---
But then they ban people who dc due to bugs. The wiggle bar bug, giant character bug, I've been stuck in my spawn spot before and wasn't found cuz I was on the edge of the swamp map with nothing important near me. That would also temp ban the occasional person who has outside things going on causing them to need to leave the match.
---
Yeah, killers were getting buff because they were weak against survivors. Only one thing got nerfed for survivors and ds still works.
---
Yeh I primarily play hag but wanted to try some others out, managed to get 2 as wraith 2 as billy and 4 as trapper and huntress. Any advice on playing nurse or any killer for that matter?
---
Imagine how many killers are gonna do this at the endgame collapse. 
---
“Okay guys. What do you want to talk about while we just sit here?
---
No one knows, I kind of want to stay up to see what it is (I'm in Aus), but I'll be angry if it's a completely worthless announcement
---
Well then you’re not much of a team player.
---
I wish they would temp ban the people who lobby dodge. It sucks trying to find a game for sometimes 10 min to get disconnected from lobby immediately and have to wait again...this happened 3 times in a row last night wasting 30 min of my time when i had to go to bed on an hour and a half. If you are dodging lobbies you shouldnt be able to create a lobby for 5+ minutes.
---
Getting hooked next to the hatch is a cruel and unusual punishment
---
Thank you so much! 💕
---
I’m sure you’ll get there someday! Just work hard and do what you love, don’t let anyone tell you anything else!
---
You know legion is 4 people right?
---
Mäjmäjs
---
I also think they might have been an SWF. Was playing Huntress btw.
---
Thank you 😎
---
*vomits back*
---
Thanks!
---
All of his addons are good, but even with those good addons he’s still a shit killer. Just have to hope his rework is good.
---
Well? Which map did you get?
---
Made it all by scratch on my own! I have a highlight on my Instagram that shows how I made it 😊
---
Not that i support him but megs are horrible beings
---
Thank you so much! Love the little feedback! 💕
---
Coldwind. Two people DCed when I downed them.
---
Hopefully you'll post your findings on the offical DbD forum, as the developers have far greater presence there.
---
Forgot to say thanks when I read this lol. Thank you.
---
Thank you!
---
Ohhhhhh I would’ve loved that so much! I just wish I had found fake hair that was more her color but I could only find black or blonde ones :( feelsbadman
---
Oh my, that's fascinating. You deserve higher praise! Props to you!
---
*vomits*
---
In /u/XxXMeinFuhrerXxX 's case, I think "Thanks, Hitler" is more fitting.
---
oof, that sucks
---
&gt;Afaik she can't grab while she is crouching
---
Combat straps.
---
Mom he b bullyin me call fbi 😭😭😭 I cri so much ritenao 😩😩
---
Wouldn’t wanna see that as survivor either yikes
---
Generally some of the worst combos. Iridescent head + infantry belt huntress being an example.
---
I used to call myself Vommy Mommy on steam :D
---
Maybe it’s because I’m low rank trash but almost none DC’s on rank 11-15. On Xbox atleast, I don’t know if it’s worse on PC. Probably should be a quitter penalty imo
---
Hitting through pallets: not being near a pallet get stunned.
---
Hitboxes: hiting them not registering the hit.
---
Counterplay: yeah thats a thing certain things killers cant do to counter survivors.
---
Mori : Instaheal, instablind.
---
Noed: cleanse totems
---
Stop complaining.
---
It was pretty funny. They got 3 gens done before I even downed a single person. Three stealthy P3 Claudettes and one default Jake who ran around sabotaging hooks. Found the Jake first, downed him, he DCed.
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
Yeah I actually play more survivor than killer haha. Tappi Boi is ma dude&lt;3
---
I’ve done a Tapp cosplay version of myself and a Feng but I never thought my Feng was good enough to be on reddit. I could upload it someday though if you’re interested! ^ ^
---
How a monster who can walk through walls and send people to his own dimention another version of a spirit who can just phase through very fast?
---
Pig: Oink
---
So much yes to this.
---
It can't be fixed. Not with the way the game is at the moment. Your Internet can be fine and the game itself can disconnect you and send you back to the 'press space' screen. Happened to me a few times.
---
STAHP LICKIN YO FINGERS THIS AINT KFC
---
*happily vomits back&lt;3*
---
This is the one thing I hate when I see people playing hag. You only need 1 maybe 2 traps at the hook. If it triggers right away, just teleport. If it doesn't, you know you have 2 people slowly crouching away from the hook
---
Thank you! :3
---
Hiya! :D
---
The only good map is the farmhouse out of all those well depends what killer you are
---
You shouldn't tunnel people with DS for obvious reasons.

&gt;though she may attempt stand up and grab you after really quickly
---
literally the same sentence lol
---
Thank you! I’m
---
Pretty happy about all the work I managed to do in only 2-3 ish weeks.
---
F
---
I'd be praying for the Jigsaw piece.
---
I'll admit I dc occasionally under certain conditions. If I get spawned I'm right next to the killer and downed in less than 10 seconds from the start of the match, I'm out, I'm playing a game to have fun and that's not fun. Happens far more often than it should, spawning in and already having loud killer music on me.
---
Monto shows good perk and add on builds for all killers
---
Some gaming terms really are idiotic. Tryhard...as opposed to not trying at all? How stupid?!
---
Noob - We all had to start somewhere sometime.  How stupid?!
---
Sweaty - Bitch, I live in Ohio and it snowed a few days ago. I wish I was sweaty.  How stupid?!
---
Boosted - Has so many meanings it isn't even a relevant term. How stupid?!
---
What it boils down to is that when people feel like they are on the brink of losing...instead of taking responsibility,  it's easier to throw out one of these idiotic terms. It shows weak mindedness in my opinion.
---
E🅱️IC
---
It sounds like youre lost to the survivor side of things... i cant convince you of these issues. Hace a good day bro. Also lay off the p**n
---
Bowel movement
---
killers are doing it too. game is dying because the devs have been too slow reacting to things. hopefully things start improving with the announced changes
---
Being a survivor is no joy these days so there are going to be less survivors playing which means longer queue times and more DCs and you killers all act so surprised. As if i am going to cleanse 5 totems every match to prevent a endgame wheelchair. Seriously thats boring as fuck and not doing it can result in a loss so its lose/lose while for thr killer its a clear win/win
---
Yeah I mean, what's the point now, its better than before i guess?
---
Had swweaty Billy with a green mori just destroy us after throwing 3 streamers. I can understand wanting to use the offering but he slaughtered us. Still left with 60000 new BP. Worth the stress.
---
It should, and remember to tell him that he'll get banned for using it in public matches
---
If you get a grab on an enemy you can hook and sacrifice him.
---
That’s not holding the game hostage at all. Killer can force you out whenever they want if you’re right inside the gate.
---
So you can alt-tab to DC? Seems like something that should be handled in developer end, which I know they plan to counter.  But, I’ve played other games online and performed the same keyboard shortcut and I’m still in the hook as if I never left.
---
Grays you made someone DC!
---
GeT tRoLlEd EpIc StYlE 😎😎😎😎
---
I play killer and survivor equally. It's rare that I get a match where I'm not tunneled the whole match or facecamped.  If I was in a match with somebody and got destroyed fairly, at the minimum you would have gotten a ggwp from me good sir.
---
I kinda feel like it was on purpose. There's a general motion survivors do when saving someone. They tend to get close to the hooked survivor before unhooking them which the David did not, he pushed the button as soon as he got to the hatch. I play as both survivor and killer so I've seen the way they unhook alot, also I know u have to be decently close anyway for the action button to pop up for saves. Besides unless the David just wasn't paying attention to the button and wording on his screen then I bet it was intentional.
---
If it had "your" in it, not "you're" :c
---
Sculpture wouldn't work.
---
Hell, Old Man wouldn't work either, he's a slower hag.
---
Kinda hard to figure out who.
---
Map would deffo be the Infinite IKEA
---
Is there a reason you stalk my profile lmao. Atleast i have good taste
---
Im not a killer main. Im a survivor main. I just see from both sides and i know that certain aspects on both sides are broken. But i understand that survivors are still really strong.
---
Yeah sometimes they definitely DC. It’s obvious when they get downed. But for instance on Friday I was playing a tombstone Meyers. After the first mori the game was getting pretty tense. Then all the sudden I get disconnected. Killer messages me on steam and is like “did you do that on purpose?” I told him I disconnected. He said that this is his sixth time trying to get the achievement with tombstone, and every single game someone got disconnected so he couldn’t do it.
---
You look 100% like her btw
---
Dont let the toxicity influence you, idk where i heard this from but i play the game with this mentality "If someone hates you for no reason, give that motherfucker a reason"
---
I play by those rules, i play in ps4 if some motherfucker complains about me camping  tunnelling when im not even close to doing that then the next time i see their name im changing my gameplay completely i just tunnel the guy camp him and then let the other guys leave since im not interested in them
---
__When my "the doctor and you see a survivor try to drop a fake pallet on you" what?__
---
I always look to see if im yalking to a nazi or something.
---
The BEANUT
---
I’ve got no issue with Billy but after so many games in a row with him at higher ranks it gets a bit boring. He seems the most common killer I run in to for some reason. I just want to play against Michael :(
---
First fix the crashes and shit and then start banning
---
I agree about jokes about rape being really bad, but want to point out something real quickly.
---
DbD community overall and r/deadbydaylight in particular do a lot of murder-related jokes. I get it that murder jokes come more natural in gaming community, while rape-related ones are basically unrelated outsiders.
---
While joke about rape are definitely bad, are people who do those like *definitely the worst scumbags to walk the earth*? I easily can imagine a complete scumbag who doesn't do jokes like that for example and also really offensive person in Internet who wouldn't do real bad shit irl.
---
People DC'ing randomly is often due to a bug (if the DC makes no sound, it's this bug). I keep talking about it in disconnect-related threads to make the issue known, because people who are affected by it can't play the game at all T-T
---
a few more times just to be sure
---
I personally disagree, most times I see thicc as large thighs, bewbs, or butt normally. And nowadays most people are overweight. Even if you body build, you’re probably overweight because you weigh more than your age class because of the muscle bulk.
---
I mean we got Freddy and Hag
---
I don’t like James design too much either, but that’s your opinion
---
I would report him myself if he used it but he isn't that toxic.
---
Had a game yesterday where the killer brought BPS, as well as 2 survivors (grand total of 3 BPS). You would think that would be a well played match by everyone. Nope. He attempted to facecamp, but thanks to a survivor with Borrowed Time he only ended up with one kill. Seriously, if there are 3 BPS up, you should be focusing on maximizing your points, not facecamping for a single kill.
---
Only real men play games for the realism. Get outta here
---
I agree not worth getting worked up over, but its annoying when a killer ends a game in less than a minute because of stupid survivors (looking at you billy boi). Like yeah you're ALLOWED to kill every one that fast but why not let it play out a bit? Turn 14k bp to 24k+. 5 gens and a lot of hooks, by letting one dummy go when you got 2 slugs and hook, you're boosting your BP, emblem, and the survivors get to play a little bit longer and don't have to suffer 15 minute wait times lol
---
I play legion
---
Yeah, that is very true. I doubt something in real life would take less than 5 minutes, but yeah. I mean, idk, it the best I can come up with.
---
you are soooo fucking delusional if you think survivors are underpowered and that killers are op.
---
then again you're crying about a DS nerf which already shows that you're not a good player so w/e.
---
Adrenaline, Mettle of Man, Dead Hard, infinite pallet loops and random hex perks on hills, being able to finish the game by doing gens in 4 minutes while the killer is getting looped not because he's bad but because there are so many pallets,
---
sUrVivoRs ArE uNdeRpoWerED
---
I believe (may be wrong here) that in the Saw films when Jigsaw’s various accomplices (who wore pig masks) captured someone with a pseudo-jump scare there tended to be a roaring sound. I believe it’s a reference to that.
---
Not too much better tho, at a certain point it's not helping anymore.
---
Just say the magic words... [O O G A  B O O G A](/intensifies)
---
Me neither. That’s why these posts sit at the bottom so no one has to read except the controversial viewers
---
"Alright. Who's looking at him right now?" 
---
"I got it! Y'all get a gen done and then we'll switch off." 
---
"Alright sounds good."

173: D A R N
---
THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE
---
That was outplayed lmao, here let me toss the safe pallet way too early then back track to where you can teleport onto me
---
I think anyone who wants realism should play escape from tarkov. You can bleed to death from a shoulder wound
---
And there's absolutely nothing we can do about it. If blocking someone on Steam actually prevented them from appearing in the same lobbies as you, we could at least pass around our block lists and compile something like a Sexual Offender's Register for people who DC, and then they would be forced to only play games with their fellow worthless trash people, which would be a poetic hell from which there would be no escape. But because there is no way to exclude them (and they know this), these fucking animals can shit all over everything with no consequences.
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
That’s so fucking sad honestly...
---
My toxic what?
---
Usually I just want the 100% BPs and a super toxic build is most likely to get the most points
---
Lol try doing a gen in the upper floors of houses in Haddon and spring. Sometimes when u finish a gen and u think ur safe since u haven't gotten attacked yet, u go to leave the room and 'reeek' u get cut. Scared the living hell outta me every time
---
Omg Haha t-pose asserting dominance. That's a good one!
---
Good job! Keep at it and soon you’ll learn the ins and outs! Welcome to killer gang
---
Doesnt matter was called out on it people were upset that a fog whisper broke the rules and gets away with it. Then we all let it go...because if the devs dont care then who will.
---
What about over 976 nights? Nurse has been meta-defining more or less ever since her release, and hasn't substantially been touched in years. Same for Billy. It is inaccurate to say the meta has changed a lot, and unfair to say anything more would be "sweeping" changes. Most of these things have not been changed at all. There have been new killers, of course, and most of them are pretty solid designs, but they don't see nearly as regular play. Take your Hag example - she's almost vanishingly rare to be seen. The majority of the perks constituting the (small) pool of those defining the metagame are years-old, as well, for both sides.
---
Some of the less-frequently-played killers should be buffed, some of the more-frequently-played killers need some adjustments. Making Nurse's post-blink lunge range scale to amount and/or distance of blinks; making Billy's post-sprint cooldown scale to the duration of the sprint; decreasing the size of the spherical hitboxes of Huntresses hatchets; removing Spirit's in-phase collision... Rebalancing some of their add-ons, as well. In turn, buffing the various other killers. This should help get them on more even footing, and lead to a more even spread in how often they are played.
---
A lot of the perks on both sides should be buffed. Most of them have basically been non-options in the meta. Some game mechanics should be changed. Challenging camped hooks should be an a lot more interactive and engaging gameplay scenario. Tunnelling should be adjusted for with game mechanics, rather than trying to doctor around it with perks. Slugging should be made more "fun" for survivors. Give slugs something to do other than recover. Maybe something to crawl to, ways to signal things to other players. Pallet play could use some new dynamics again, such as killers being able to cancel the breaking animation, creating new mindgames. Maybe killers being able to break unused pallets, and survivors to repair broken ones. Quasi-infinites could finally be addressed, maybe giving them a limited number of vaults total in a given trial, before the window collapses. They could remove the headlights from generators, making it harder and therefore more important to manage to find them. Or, since it is Easter time, bringing up an old idea: hidden generator parts around the map that survivors have to find, and killers could potentially even be able to hide them themselves.
---
I do think most of the new killers are in a good-enough spot and at most have some adjustments here or there for them in mind. Most of all, I would really want the perk metagame to be a lot richer. Just for one example out of dozens of things I have in mind, Dying Light should apply its debuff whenever the Obsession is being chased, or in injured/dying/hooked state, while Dark Devotion should make anyone you land a hit on become the Obsession, then triggering the terror radius transfer (it would then probably need a cooldown). The combo here is obvious: you would have Dying Light active for much of the round if paired up with Dark Devotion. Since it costs half of your perk loadout however, and since Dark Devotion only has a fairly gimmicky effect, this would not become a dominant build, but definitely one regular enough to be seen to be relevant, to be one of hopefully various options making up the meta, and it would actually lead people to try and get the best out of DD's gimmicky effect. Thanatophobia should also decrease the speed of pallet and window interactions, whereas Resilience, Spine Chill and Leader should also increase it. Saboteur could reveal hook auras within a certain range, as well as their "health" status, giving sabo builds actual chances to become relevant again. Diversion could give the survivor an over-the-shoulder view, similar to flashlights, allowing them to aim the pebble, while moving, and instead of a mere Entity explosion notification, should resemble certain interaction sounds, depending on what you throw it against (such as a window/pallet vaulting sound, pallet dropping sound, locker entering/exiting sounds, etc.). Head On should have the activation timer reduced or removed. There could be more proactive perks for killers too, like maybe something that lets you pre-charge a super-lunge that has twice the reach and can break pallets, but you have to stand still for a certain amount of time to charge it, and it has an increased recovery time penalty. What about making Insidious a temporary-effect perk you can trigger at-will at any point, without needing to stand still. Maybe rework Stridor into something that rewards you for following a survivor's exact pathing, having them leave a faint foggy trail behind, survivors being able to see and erase these trails by retracing them, as well. Make Monstrous Shrine allow the killer to erect a hook at any applicable location of their choosing, but it collapses once a hooked survivor leaves it. Ash could have come with a one-time-use shotgun perk that lets you stun the killer from afar, but only for like a second or two, and only if you actually aim and hit them. Just random ideas to throw out there; I've forgotten about more actually-impactful perks I would like to see than there have been actually-impactful perk releases and adjustments. And coming up with straight-forward buffs for many existing perks is easy too, since it often times is only a mere number change. There is no real reason not to elevate many of the perks into the "strong" category. More than half of all perks are currently essentially useless, in meta terms, and the pool of strong, actually meta-defining perks is limited to around 10 perks each - again, most of which having been in that pool for years.
---
I agree and you have my respect. But I’ve seen some DAMN good suggestions on what some changes and reworks could have been.
---
Thank you very much &lt;3 don’t put yourself down! Huntress definitely takes some practice, especially if you’re going for snipes/cross map hatchets. How long have you been playing her for, do you have trouble with just snipping survivors? I can give you some specific tips if you would like :)
---
Just ignore them and move on.
---
What's the deal with all the DCs lately
---
I would just move to the next jigsaw box. What is this dumb shit?
---
We're already on it, don't worry.
---
No, playing with friends is fine, although incredibly annoying for low ranked killers. The problem was the toxic players screwing around. Their actions were toxic.
---
I don't know buddy I'm enjoying my time here guess to each the own.
---
Hope you start enjoying it too :)
---
Thanks for the read
---
Ye, brown toolboxes are pretty legit too; think the benefit of toolbox would be highlighted better if there was a claud doing gens without one, alongside the others
---
if i bring a mori, and see that. Fuck killing its farming time.
---
Why would he though? It's not like it's a *broken* perk.
---
I just wanna see how fast it feels. Lol
---
The dc rate against legion is really high. I played 3 games last night and ALL of them had dces. 
---
1st game: all 4 dc
---
2nd: 3 dces
---
3rd: 2 dces (on a 3 man game)
---
*Laughs in Thanatophobia*
---
5 min and then double it every time they dc
---
It says "forums/social media", so I wouldn't get your hopes up. I think someone discovered it has something to do with contests so all hype is dead for me.
---
I'm gonna take I wild guess it's true and Jen. I don't understand how they manage to do it all the time and then their fans join which is more oil to the fire. All these posts about attacking either side is fucking retarded too considering they usually attack their character rather than the opinions.
---
I couldn't even use it once because a wraith uncloaked right next to my hook and downed me and hooked me as I clicked the button to hit the skill check
---
I have no idea, but me and my mate were pissing ourselves laughing at the thought of this Myers looking at 3 default davids, all injured, and just noping out
---
OwO what's this
---
~grey toolbox~
---
Is A the new cool thing kids talk about? In my times we had E
---
darn :'(
---
That seems super toxic. This was also back when pig wasnt a thing right? So you couldnt use hangmans trick
---
Running Urban, so fully deserved
---
Well your who saves your friend when shes on the hook?  Shes literally stealing thousands of points from ya if shes saving and you arent..I'd rather save then do gens. You get way more points 1500...  
---
I've just recently started using ds and let me tell you its come in handy killers arent really worried about ds anymore. Which is awesome
---
Oh sorry officer I thought this was the wild west
---
What he said is true. [Here’s a clip of one of them](https://youtu.be/13YMrJLV4sE)
---
Chill bro I’m not stealing your bf
---
Wasn’t even facecamping lmao!
---
Right I took urban off for ds.. then I had like 2 hag games. I didnt survive those matches lmaooooo
---
Happened to me (and others as well), and for me it turned out to be a faulty left stick of my controller. Sony's controllers are kind of known for this kind of defect (you'll find lots of such reports on Reddit). You can use a controller test program on a PC to check if it's your controller.
---
If shirtless Myers ever does get added to the game, he’ll always be T3 because i’ll always be looking at him. :)
---
Story time!
---
was in game with my friend, we were the first to die and stuck around to watch the match
---
it was a Meg who was a great and i loved her gameplay and a claud who i hadn't seen much of her till i started spectating 
---
Meg was in chase for a good amount of time, i switch between both. claud is just crouching places not doing gens while Meg being chased......Meg get caught and hooked.
---
Claud hiding around the hatch, waiting for Meg to die....Meg unhooks herself.
---
neither of them do the last two gens..Meg spotted Claud ofc and saw she was doing nothing while she was on the hook so she stayed hidden from the killer too 
---
the game went on for SUCH A LONG TIME
---
me and my friend praying the killer finds Claud because we don't want that selfish player to escape.
---
Claud got sick of waiting for the killer to find Meg again, so she went herself to find Meg, dragged the killer to Meg.
---
the killer ignored Meg and went ham on Claud. me and my friend start cheering 'YEES YEES YEES GET THAT SELFISH CUNT!!'
---
Claud on the hook just chilling, meanwhile Meg found the hatch, Karma is a bitch
---
Meg waits for Claud to die then escapes thru the hatch 'YEES MEG GOT OUT' we were so happy and we congratulated her for the escape post chat and told Claud that we saw everything and she was such an awful player
---
the killer said "she showed me where meg was, that's why i killed the claud not the meg"
---
Gosh! felt great to see Claud get that hook
---
A popular theory is new halloween cosmetics.
---
Oh I dont think and ever be in a match together I'm a rank 5 survivor...
---
He's awesome and definitely worth buying. I love them jumpscare moments and being able to instadown with your basic ability. Oh, and nothing feels better than tombstoning annoying SWF groups.
---
Not really, every online multiplayer game should have a quit option just in case something happens in real life.
---
I liked the Babadook as a character but I really wasn't scared. The movie was also over-hyped for me so I was expecting something more.
---
Woah terrible analogy asshole
---
Wouldn't say exploit bud
---
Telling someone you're posting a screenshot to this sub is mega cringe
---
Nah I usually let her since she has Well make it and Deliverance. I save sometimes when she's almost done with a gen or being chased that is if the other survivor doesn't beat me to it lmao.
---
Yeah I used it last night after reading some of these comments. I got to use it once out of like 5 games? I think? But yeah it does come in handy when killers aren't aware u have it.
---
It was totally random. Had nothing to do with what he said. If you think that's the same level you need help
---
&gt;how about no.
---
Why not?  Don't like the idea that people might remember that they got face-camped, tunneled or LF mori spammed? Hmm... 🤔
---
Me, when I just see a completely normal, worthless dull totem.
---
But survivors can see straight through coldwind jungle gyms, i really don't think many killers thrive on coldwind with that in mind
---
Can you post images or something? This post is useless if you don't own Smash...
---
If I see sandbagging shit you can bet I’ll turn my headlights on them. If anything Meg deserved a personal escort to the hatch at that point damn
---
And existing is also cringe so lets just die now
---
Why would your hypothetical rework only be for PS4?
---
Manipulate your red stain you don't want to know how many times I got someone with out needing to blink because of it .
---
I have been called. Yes its on there twitter. Go on reddit search for Pig bad news endgamem should be the first one.
---
Honestly, I feel like Dr. Bright would make for a better survivor ~~or even a killer if you took it the right way~~ (the chance for different cosmetics would be crazy). But a D-Class would work well if you took into account how some of them also have anomalous abilities. Good example is the "Confinement" series by LordBung, Connor would probably introduce some interesting perks.
---
173 mechanically wouldn't fit that well in DBD, but I have a feeling that the one that I've seen alot of people want in DBD (SCP-049 aka: The Plague Doctor) wouldn't have a place, due to the Doc already having a Plague Doctor esque cosmetic set coming out soon. He could still be visually different from those cosmetics and would probably have to be a short killer so it wouldn't cause confusion
---
And I'd say that the "realm" would be the SCP Facility, allowing different layouts of different "Sites" to be used as maps. Also allowing the ability for more SCP's to be in the game, but more as interactive things on the map what would make it truly unique. (Also the idea of a pocket dimension map is kinda exciting ~~and maybe even an Entity Based Infinite Ikea would be pretty rad too~~)
---
I am surprised the sub doesnt have more highly voted posts about this issue, its legit killing the game.
---
You're right, but people always forget that Left Behind has one very important use case. If all of your teammates get killed before you can complete two gens that's usually gg; it's almost impossible to complete a gen or two on your own to get the hatch to show up. Enter Left Behind - all of a sudden you get at least 100% increased repair speed (25% for each remaining gen). That means you can complete an untouched gen in 40 seconds without a toolbox. Even if you're starting from absolute zero you might be able to complete a gen before the killer finishes a full round (depending on killer, map / gen spawn, perks, etc., of course), but if a gen already has progress on it you can bang that thing out crazy fast. Then you find the hatch. EZPZ
---
I know it. It's not how I want it.
---
no i have inside knowledge
---
Maybe it deletes all of the grease from HybridPanda's hair, gives him a haircut, and makes him look presentable?
---
Jesus fuck dude calm down. I don’t know who shit in your Cheerios but god damn.
---
if you get hooked in the game you get hooked in real life
---
14:00PM, weird
---
That’s enough reddit flashbacks for one day, goodbye
---
God forbid the killer be able to 4k when they earned it
---
Ability to injure an entire lobby in first 40 seconds and anyone thereafter for no effort, and then a 115% killer on top of that
---
Mate... He's still very strong.
---
Well. You should be prepared for buffs or nerfs to characters, even the nerfed ones. So you sound a little silly. And also they aren’t all nerfs. I was also angry at the changes, but looking back on them I can see that legion will definitely be playable
---
I hate this. But will give upvote uwu
---
I like Ormond, but they need to fix the aura visibility on that map. It's fucked.
---
If I have a choice between a hatch and a hook that's 5 meters from it, I just can't help it but hook them
---
No, lmfao. HybridPanda plays on PC. That image was just showing he had gotten the game on PS4 too.
---
Unrelated, but I’m curious as to what a high level Legion main thinks of his upcoming changes
---
Oh no it’s the plague *chocks on vomit*
---
I'd say its a pretty survivor sided map so I can see why a survivor would use it.
---
Julio boolio is obviously the weeb
---
Ah ok. I’m don’t watch his content so I wouldn’t know. Well there goes my hopes for a good update.
---
He certainly isnt just making rape jokes, but is also a real racist.
---
I would set the map in a run down version of site 19 and use scp-035 on a tall ass body
---
Mate leatherface can DOWN an entire lobby in five seconds. Break pallets instantly AND is a 115% killer ontop of that.
---
Mate... Leatherface is really strong.
---
Point being if you put a killer in their best possible scenario, all of them are really strong.
---
ALL OF THEM.
---
Freddy rework maybe?
---
yeah the david was trolling
---
i just know what worked for me, got to rank 2 doing that, so maybe i was jist facing bad survivors then?
---
Lmao great job.
---
The game is literally the most Killer-sided map according to official BHRV statistics...
---
Yeah, the only problem right now is that if you restart the game or even just play a game you get the pips back that you lost. In addition, there hasn't really been any news about people getting bans, temp or permanent, for disconnecting too much recently. This combination has made it so the leave game button has been abused. Not that it's a reason to remove the button, but it is an issue.
---
its banneable. rip
---
I know most people dislike The Game, but it's grown on me so it's one of my favorite maps to play on
---
Calm down there homie. There’s a lot of people who play both, and honestly everyone should play both. This “Main” shit is dumb. And I’ll stop you there. I played survivor until I started playing killer too. Killer is definitely harder, but sometimes I feel like chilling and running away at times as survivor. Stop berating an entire half of the game because you’re angry. Not all survivors are toxic dirtbags. I know I’m not.
---
I do think the community is overreacting a little, I’ve said before that I think of these changes as giving him less reliable tracking than the doctor in exchange for easier first hit potential 
---
Am looking forward to the changes and agree there was no counterplay. Appreciate the quick reply too
---
All good brother
---
Powerless? He still gets a free hit, he'll just end up becoming a better wraith by the end of it.
---
Wait wait wait did you just say bubba is OP I I gotta make sure you actually meant it and I'm not reading this wrong.
---
It used to be, yeah, but they added a ton of safe pellets about two chapters ago the
---
YUP🤦🏾‍♂️😂
---
I assume it's getting located by the killer instinct but not getting hit.
---
It is a bug. I knew it existed and I was really waiting that this happens to me because it is funny but I joined a normal match and ate my fucking rice and damdandan 2 killers in the match.
---
Lol just because it benefits the killer doesn’t mean it’s not BMing/toxic. When I play killer if someone (like the survivor in the OP) is stupid, of course I’ll take that extra hook/kill, and it’ll feel even better because they were BMing. The two things aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
Wow you think you're edgy
---
Solo queue is the biggest torture in this game by far, gaving bond or empathy just makes it worse if u see what they are up too
---
This is meant as exaggeration but I was watching some guys stream and when I hooked him he told his teammates I was soft patrolling his hook when I was running in a straight line away from the hook.
---
If you pull your internet cable I've heard you lose no pips and keep your item. Someone would have to confirm though
---
It's basically the same as complaints about tunneling or slugging, I think "genrushing" as a term is fucking moronic, but  the general idea is just "unfun gameplay" AKA trying to end the game ASAP
---
So, a jock, a torture porn enthusiast, a weeaboo and a farmer all walk into a bar...
---
Not sure actually. Only time I got it before was dropping a firecracker without the killer being nearby. Never got it out of that though.
---
I just run DS, BL, SC and Kindred, just so I don't get farmed or left to die on one hook. If I'm playing SWF I'll swap kindred for adrenaline.
---
100% agreed, people seem to think he'll be worse off just because he can't meme with add-ons or moonwalking anymore.
---
Thoughts on Pill Bottle plus Brush? Pair them with monitor and couldn't you just pull them off a gen if they disrespect you?
---
Neither do I. It’s like when survivors complain that the killers don’t give them hatch. The killers objective is to kill and the survivors objective is generators.
---
Don't forget NASA
---
you where the strongest person ever but you couldnt protect those that you cares for
---
You said if you don’t escape. The only other option is you dying...
---
I mean, she's probably matured somewhat, but socially she hasn't had anyone to be with so like, she's probably not the most developed. Though it probably manifests in ways that don't really matter for serial killers who live in the woods.
---
Wait. can doc actually fake pallets? I have never seen that before
---
The nature of console (single screen) is that you're stuck on your couch waiting for another match if you DC. On PC you can easily DC/reset the game and watch some youtube or do something else on your second screen. So the "quality of life" for being a DCer is higher on PC.
---
Yes, the qutter penalty should be bigger. Should probably start ramping up until you are waiting 5-10 mintues to re-que.
---
People don't realize that the reason Legion sucks without Frank's/exploits is because you can't down survivors like a normal killer so it's get looped to hell at 110% or FF to get deep wounds down. At the very least now he'll be able to play normally. 
---
Also the comparison to LF is a bit unfair. Survivors have to play poorly for LF to saw more than one survivor. Legion just has to have survivors be kinda close together to get at least a couple injured fairly quickly.
---
Done this before. Best thing ever when they actually fall for it.
---
Recently more killers have been disconnecting when i play survivor with 3 friends, it used to only be every once in a while but recently its been almost every other lobby where the killer DCs as soon as they see that we're partied up. The fact that it sometimes takes so long to even find a lobby, then you finally get one but the killer just leaves is depressing.
---
Thing about Billy or Nurse is that they feel busted in the hands of someone experienced and kinda crap in the hands of someone who doesn't have decent knowledge in looping/ tiles/ pressure
---
Legion still very much gets a "free hit" with his frenzy that is unavoidable. (Unless you're *really* bad and miss the swing)
---
Billy and Nurse are still *very* top tier, but I'm arguing Legion isn't nearly as bad as a killer whose power is to *become* an M1 killer after 8 seconds of seeing a survivor in a world that's locally fogged the fuck up.
---
So she’s asserting dominance over herself?
---
Bring spinechill and be more sneaky sneak. Or Dwight-it and hide in a locker for about 30 seconds, or until killer comes by and leaves. I used to hate being downed first, but if you dc first then YOU are the problem with dbd. Someone might try to save, or be smart and use that time to pop gens. Just think of it as “hey, my teammates are doing all the work now while I just hang out over here lol”
---
**tremendously**
---
EZ noed lmaooo guys buff tier 1 and 2 noed
---
&gt; Not healing against Legion turns them into an infinite T3 Myers
---
*on top of having an odd-ball "fuck pallets and window vaults* ability to throw into the mix for potential denial/ force plays.
---
D-BOIS! D-BOIS! D-BOIS!
---
But that gives a disadvantage to the rest of your team :&lt; also there are plenty of games where I've been found almost straight away and have still managed to escape, matches might not always start out great but they have the potential to finish well :)
---
Well there are quite a few who could work but noone knows nor cares about them. Like Smokey the killer cop who screams "RUN FUCKER RUN" when chasing someone. Or a kumiko who gets pissed when people call her a kitsune and can mind trick people into commiting murder, cannibalism and abortions. Or a three feet tall naked oldman who kidnappes children and tortures their families. Or a russian witch who makes webs out of her hair and uses it to catch humans.
---
The list just goes on.
---
Why would anyone feel like an asshole for running NOED or old DS or using old BNP? Because they have a fucking brain and realize when shit is overpowered or braindead?
---
No0b3, is that you?
---
My first killer game was as Wraith, too. I would've 4Ked but I was looking away when the last person unhooked themselves.
---
"summer" is all we have at the moment
---
Hey no problem man, happy to give my opinion on it. I think his tracking will still probably be fine, especially with the larger terror radius giving him more vision of heartbeats when he hits. And yeah I do understand some of people's concerns, but with most games it's pretty evident that seeing changes on paper is almost pointless to speculate so definitively until you've actually gotten to test them in game, so I'm just waiting for it to go up on PTB to form a proper opinion on it
---
thanks!
---
She had been hooked twice and after the second one I went to walk away and literally 2 seconds later they unhooked her. So I decided to go back and check it out and they decided to try and heal her on the spot. Oh and no one tried to block for her so yeah, easy kills lol.
---
thank you, makes sense.
---
Also thank you.
---
Yeah, but if the person is already injured, you're likely not going to frenzy unless you have the add-on that breaks pallets when you slide over.
---
Well where are these pallets? I think ive seen like 3 that whole map!
---
Problem is, it can go a little too fast... 
---
Which is why hex ruin is meta for all killers... I wish they did something to change this
---
*happens when someone gets hooked basement*
---
Ah it's such a gratifying moment to do that as a survivor, but to have it happen as killer it's like really? Stay on, just die a little. Perfect vacation.
---
True but it can be used to quickly deny broken windows along long walls, or at the very least break away from a chase from a survivor stalling you too hard on a strong tile, stalling them, and quickly finding someone else to hassle.
---
Really depends on how long the stun phase after frenzy is in this update though. Hopefully it still stays long so Legion can't just endlessly breathe down someone's neck.
---
What does ok mean?
---
Dont know about others but why do i always end up doing the grab animation and no grabbie grab? I understand with the hooks and gens coz it doesnt matter much but the hatch grab is infuriating
---
Wow, I play on xbox and thankfully there is no chat. I can't imagine if there was.
---
...Everywhere. This is an objective fact, dude. if you want I can link the video of Puppers and Monto talking about it
---
like the 3 min countdown will change anything. So much potential in this game and it will never live up to it.pity
---
You're underestimating the spaghetti code.
---
Been playing killer more as I recently got back into dbd, I even played wraith which I never do and somehow got a 4k :)
---
Also don't let those sfw ruin it for you, especially on ps4 as there are communities dedicated to it. The best tip for that is focus on gens and don't mindlessly chase them around, as it wastes time
---
Honestly, this was pure luck. But one helpful thing is timing. When they are in the jumping animation, just click your Weapon Swing button. Don't lunge, and chances are you'll sometimes Hatch Snatch them. I'm usually the loser in these types of situations, but I managed to Bamboozle in this case.
---
Gens dont need to be done, the Killer can und the game whenever ge wants
---
*south park*
---
You've never played against doc with addons?
---
Doc creates illusions, images of himself standing there as well as pallets
---
I much prefer this kind of explanation over people attempting to play internet psychologist and talk about their deep seeded desires and prejudices, I feel like this is much more accurate to the situation at hand tbh
---
The good part of playing doc is that you learn how to accept that it's ok to ot get even 1k and be called trash in the end game because your build for farming is too annoying... I need help...
---
No, it happened to me once. You see prompt and you press the button not even realizing it was for hatch instead of unhook.
---
Then let's copystrike the game Dying light too
---
Well if the DbD "celebrities" would stop behaving like they're in highschool and try to treat one another with a modicum of respect, maybe this wouldn't be an issue.
---
Oh who am I kidding, it's probably better to just constantly shit talk and demean everyone not in the "clique" and then act offended when they dare to fight back.
---
it's the game too, me and my buddy were playing last night and every other game at least one of us failed to load the game.. not saying that's what happened here but yea
---
Wearing that makes you the obsession, pay to lose smh
---
I wanna see the perks
---
"You have low karma and your name i dont like it, this is my counteargument &lt;3 reddit btw where everyones arguments are lol negative karma, lol post history, lol 0 arguments ever because I'm fucking stupid." How do you function in real life when you actually have to adress what someone says rather than bitch and moan about how they have low karma (btw that's because of triggered morons like yourself, not my decision). I bet you don't talk to people irl anyways. Also your name lets me know your gay af.
---
Soery, Dalies
---
so satisfying to see :D
---
YUMMY YUMMY BLOOD
---
Oh shitsu dying light was made before dead by daylight
---
I learned the lunge attack hard way but what i mean is that the hand comes out and do the grab animation but the survivor went into hatch like weeeeee
---
Nooo waaaay
---
Heheheheheheheeheheheehheheehhehehehe
---
might be a DeadbyDaylight Issue but you should also check if it is a Nat Problem
---
Yes waaaaaaaayyy
---
Nope
---
Well, when all else fails, I M P R O V I S E
---
Actually, according to the lore, you don't die, you run back to the campfire and start another obstacle. I believe it's the same for those who escape. Meaning no one actually wins or loses except the Entity.
---
True. I usually dont partake in any luck based contests anyway, and the art contests are not better since my drawing skills sure are lacking.
---
I hope its something worth while at least
---
If we look in the top right we can see a * rank 20*
---
Doing Gens U?
---
Not at that length. She was nowhere near the window and it's not like it was a slow vault.
---
well his ability wasnt that great in the first place
---
That would be absolutely fantastic. But as u/MatMaf said, i probs shouldnt get my hopes up. We will see.
---
When the devs learn to fix their game, then we can talk about punishing DCers.
---
I thought they said it wouldnt even be on the ptb, only legion stuff? Im not certain tho.
---
Problem with legion was really just he was unenjoyable to play against. They made his power weaker to push him in favor of being a mouse 1 killer by buffing his movement speed so i think he will be ok but his ability is going to not have more utility than giving him 1 free hit. Which is a bummer really but if they manage to escape after that hit at least you will slow them down.
---
 Freddy I have high hopes that he gets an entirely new ability. The idea of pulling people into the dream realm is cool but really it gives him 0 edge to do anything other than just left click and hunt people down. I like the idea of reworking dream realm so that everyone starts in it and the effects of being in the dream realm are different. Then give freddy some type of useful ability for being in his realm. Players will of course instantly know they are versing freddy.
---
Imagine dc'ing against doctor, a hopeless m1 killer.
---
Could be. Honestly hope it would be something else.
---
That DC is relatable. There's no way that should have even hit you tbh.
---
Same, especially if you're talking about gates being powered at 4 gens with 4 people still alive lol. Wasn't sure what they were trying to prove there.
---
Or we could acknowledge that everyone is trying to play this game and punishing your team-mates for something the game did to you is like screaming "FUCK THE DEVS" as you kick the meg on the generator in the stomach.
---
Nowadays thats just how survivors are. If your first down, theres no reason to play the match in their eyes. Dunno why, its stupid, but its how it is.
---
That's actually false, one of her friends got told they were getting close to 35% DC rate she never got close herself
---
I truly want to play solo because it is so much more adrenaline inducing than ez-pz SWF, but no matter what rank I am I always seem to get matched up with survivors that make it painful to play solo. Wasted pallets, only lasting 10 seconds in a chase, suiciding on hook/DC'ing, nobody coming to save me when im on hook.
---
I will say, however, when you get those teammates that know what they're doing, and you all sync up and play as good as a SWF without comms, it's something magical
---
Play killer, I find it easier to gain XP as killer. Best way to do it as survivor is to do one gen then start doing a few totems then search a chest then 99% a couple of hooks. Even if you don't escape you'll still earn decent XP, the hatch will also give more XP if you want to risk it
---
Can’t killers vault through windows anyway, though? Should we get rid of that too?
---
Ah, I see. My bad
---
It would honestly work if he had 200% speed and insta downs but could only move if he wasnt in the survivor's render distance
---
How about nurse then?
---
I had this claudette tell us that if it was a doc she would dc. The moment a scream left us she was fucking gone lmao
---
*Angry Wraith uncloak* “I’m about to end this whole man’s game”
---
Yah I guess I can agree with that. Plus since closing the hatch powers the exit gates now perks like noed and whispers are going to be a lot harder for survivors if the hatch gets closed and they are last alive.
---
Im confused by that mans logic lol
---
*Laughs in Resilience*
---
Nurse actually take quite a bit of skill to be even halfway decent with her. (On ps4 anyways)
---
No, im saying pop a couple more ppl to play test bug fixes rather than dlc. Cause a few more eyes will help
---
Never seen that before
---
maybe you should avoid dc'ing in the first place
---
Literally who are you talking to. Haha
---
I love the logic of some of you fools though. On here complaining “ToXiC sUrViVoRs!” In one thread but then in another one “there’s no such thing as bad manners in a video game.”
---
Fucking. Logic.
---
Lol I think Clown's 15% speed vaulting perk is more than enough for a killer tbh.
---
And if she tried them all....?
---
If the teammates are crap then whatever really. If they're actually decent and helpful then I'll try to stay. If not, bye bye.
---
*docter*
---
Exactly
---
Ive used kindred too in the past, thing is I get rarely caughtand If I do I mostly got my pip already so no drama there. Its just the lack of teamspirit some ppl show that really itches me
---
Not coincidence; this reliably happens
---
There is no reason to pretend those survivor characters haven't been severely handicapped to be in the game. A pallet to the head stunning the killer means that it is entirely possible for those legendary licensed to destroy it.
---
You missed my point.
---
I mean, it can be funny don’t get me wrong. Quality as DBD memes in here. But Christ the hypocrisy is strong in this subreddit sometimes. Makes me want to go back to the Overwatch subreddit, and we all know how awful that place is.....
---
The best combo is Commodius+Clean Rag+Swivels.
---
When he first came out I got banned for a day for “insta downing”
---
They always do streams at that time.
---
You could always get better and not fuck your team over.
---
Nah, I mean AM/PM is a 12 hour format thing and 14 is 24 hour
---
I refused to. One of the first perks I bought in shrine was Franklins (back when it was like 500 shards a perk) because I knew I would never buy LF. I like to watch lots of gameplay before I get a game, and I knew about toxic LF mains before I even purchased the game. Lol. I just see so many people abuse his power and then face camp with it I knew I wanted no part in it. I’m aware of how petty I can be when my salt levels rise....you can’t give me that power. Also I just don’t find him interesting or fun to play or go against most times. Can be fun to loop if there’s no instant chainsaw though.
---
every month or so i revist DBD to see what the state of the game is. Yesterday, i played three games, and in every single game all of my teammates did was crouch and walk around the map. Some things change, but DBD seems to always stay the same.
---
I do wish this also showed the grey box and without any toolbox for comparison
---
Something got fucked with the map generation of Lerys with a recent update. It's now littered with safe windows and potential infinites, it's so gross. I don't blame any killer for DCing on current Lerys.
---
Omg laughed way too hard when nurse transformed the BPS in a hook  . Good job OP, keep up
---
Take your upvote and get the fuck out of here.
---
YES I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYONE SUFFERS LIKE I DID .
---
BLEED.
---
Wraith is overall a good tracking killer. If you need advice on what perks to use, we as the community are happy to help.
---
Ah ok my bad, I never had BBQ until this past Shrine and didn’t know you got limited stacks depending on tier.
---
They are already on death row man, why you gotta bully em even more?
---
I blinded a teammate with a firecracker and got that too
---
more than likely you damaged the control stick while wiggling. It's a very common issue for console and you'll probably need a new controller
---
Because when m&amp;a switches to chase mode, the shift in fov can look like a slowdown
---
Haunted Grounds is great, love watching it bust when I get into a fresh chase. My current build is Haunted Ground, Ruin, BBQ, and Deerstalker.  Definitely sounds like you can do some work with the build though.
---
It's a bit embarrassing to say but I'm not sure how to clean the inside of the Playstation controller, Would you mind telling me?
---
I’m not sure exactly WHICH video they posted since there’s quite a few now, but the video that became most popular and was pretty early on, was not just ONE game, it was multiple, because they wanted to see how many killers they could shove into a single game. 
---
Like someone else said, they popularized the glitch and knew full well others would figure it out, which they did, and proceeded to ruin other people’s games (one of mine included). 
---
As for the Dev’s decisions, I think the ban should be longer, 3-7 days in the least for using blatant exploits to ruin the games of others. It is nice to know that the ones who ruined my game will at least receive a small ban. Hopefully not just to person who played the second killer, but the accomplice who invited them into the game, knowing what they were doing. 
---
I did find out about how the glitch was done, and considered playing it in a KYF mode if possible, but definitely not a public match. My friends and I decided against it in case they started doing bans regardless of KYF mode or not.
---
That's perfectly fine! The limited stack thing is actually a brand new adjustment to BBQ, so we are all still getting adjusted to it.
---
Oh, sorry. No i didn’t
---
Having to run in a circle because of a center lake would either be tedious of a gimmick because the killer might only walk in one direction/rotation and never find anybody, or fun as something beautiful and such. I don’t think it’s practical of a level design though. But I definitely not against a more water themed level
---
Good job though i thought it was going to be a mori.
---
M.A.AB hags are so powerful that i do not know why people bother camping with them. I hook, walk away for about a few feet, turn around and see a claudette crouchwalking to the hook, easy grab/slash and hook.
---
You could probably find a video on YouTube, that would probably help more than me describing it
---
* updated drivers?
---
* how much RAM do you have?

---
you should get a piece of paper that says "sike you thought"
---
Wait, the guy who DCed had unbreakable? Is that how the perk icon looks on console? :o I know bill ain’t on console but I never considered that Unbreakable looked different
---
Out of the 100 games you played every single one had every player connect at the beginning of the game? I find that.... hard to believe.
---
Yeah, I was gonna buy a couple of Dlcs when they were on sale but I would need like 10mill bp to level them up. Lol
---
You gotta let them get some unhooks or, if they're really not doing well, smack them, lose the chase and find someone else or keep chasing longer than you have to. That's if you really wanna get the chaser stat up
---
They're afraid of us maxing out I guess... Idk about you, but I'm so close it's not funny. Only a few more years to go.
---
It’s still shit bc most pallets are rng and you just have to hope there’s a pallet in the next room you can’t plan your routing at all
---
I get your point, but I wasn't thinking about a huge lake. 
---
Just a small pond that has a bridge traversing it, with a broken railing to jump down in the water and cut the chases.
---
Something that will let a lot of people dissapointed, probably. Let's see, probably will be announced in the next 2 hours.
---
that's true! We all get it hard but it's even worse when you're left alone.. I only have very few people that used to play with me but got so tired of their DCs that I rarely play solo. I'm waiting for them to have dedicated servers up!!
---
Saw this exact comment in roast me not 3 min ago in my feed. I wonder...
---
You could play as spirit. She’s great as jukes just go into your power for a second then stay still. They’ll freak out and run right infront of you. (That’s what I do at least and who I main)
---
We should be able to place them wherever we want. I want it all to be accessible based on my likelihood of using them. this is like the least significant thing for user interface they could do I have no idea why you're pushing back on it lmao
---
Why are you mad that he didn’t want to go easy for extra blood points? Not his fault he doesn’t need the extra bp.
---
Playing Freddy on The Game is awesome. No grass blowing your cover, can't pinpoint your Lullaby directly,close proximity easier to sleep multiple Survivors,etc etc.
---
Haha there was a lot of talks of a new liscence with the PTB out tomorrow. 
---
Yeah I'm guessing there will be a tweet about it soon.
---
Let’s see who the survives bitch about now and get nerfed into oblivion.
---
Where in the forums does it say that?
---
it's sad because it's a fun game ugh they keep adding content but this should be top priority
---
Leatherface. I can just not get the timing with the chainsaw down.
---
if you could earn blood points, imagine stacking four bbqs lol

Ever since the first week, I’ve only played against the Plague once.

I know not having a brain is Legion’s thing, but this won’t work against anyone with a brain.

I'll add u lol. I'm always down for new dbd friends ^^ my name is L3gitHyuga1997 on pan if u wanna send me a request. I'm working rn but I'll accept it when I get home. Hopefully I'll have psplus, it was supposed to end yesterday but I was still able to play when I went to bed at midnight so idk lol. But u should def give wraith and Spirit a try. Or maybe someone like Huntress that way u don't have to really chase them.

After playing a game solo today, a guy just waiting near me till I go to second phase and die instantly because killer was close again (good reason from killer, someone would probably be near before I go to second stage).

Only to see him DC after he walks into a bear trap close by....
---
Thats fair.
---
What's this???
---
This sums up my emotions perfectly, thank you
---
Add ounishment for d/cing, done
---
Cool! Hopefully it'll be something decent at least.

He did a super complex way to counter the Hag... “CROUCHING”
---
Giving me supreme queen realness.
---
I’ve seen her a bit, I’d like to play against her more often, she’s a lot of fun
---
Thanks for your service good sir!
---
I still remember when my survs were being particularly assholish. They truly believed their dicks were so big that, when I went to a corner to refuse them chase points, they forced themselves into my view. 
---
I turned, smacked them, and managed to run them down right before they got to the gate. They were the embodiment of all survivor salt.
---
as a fellow nerd, this pleases me
---
i have made fairly large spreadsheets on google docs to track the speed/charges of all the survivor addons.
---
additionally i just made a way to track how many games required to get perks with the new chapters. 
---
some of us just like number!
---
Tru Tru. Then again tho I think if they did that for one map, considering all maps are the same and there's no mechanics differentiating them other than more floors, they would have to implement that into all maps that's outdoors. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying it's a bad idea cause it's creative and I like anything to do with water lmao but I feel like it would take some time if they did try to implement it.
---
If you are getting sufficient framerates in other titles, that suggests your general system is at least not a major culprit. Make sure that DbD is using the dedicated GPU, rather than integrated.
---
The game has been getting worse in terms of performance, again. BHVR really can't seem to handle engine updates - even now that they implement them "incrementally" they mess up a bunch of stuff every time, like audio and performance.
---
There's a few things you can reasonably do to improve things. Obviously, set graphical detail to low. Reduce the game resolution, but don't use scaler for this; you want to either set your desktop resolution to something lower, or run the game in exclusive fullscreen mode, letting it change the resolution itself. Exclusive fullscreen mode also improves performance. This can be achieved using the GameUserSettings.ini. In it, you can also disable V-Sync. In "fps boost" configs around the web, what you will additionally find are Engine.ini lines, but that file should be left alone, as it is actively modifying the game and its visuals in unintended, unusal ways. There is mention of some Steam launch parameters for the game (-useallavailablecores -malloc=system -sm4 -nomansky -lowmemory -d3d10), but while I can say they did give me a handful more frames when I tested them, I think most of them do basically nothing. Worth a shot, though.
---
Overclocking your GPU is a possibility, as well. You should check your GPU/CPU load while playing, to see which of the two is the bottleneck. Most likely the former.
---
I'd actually be ok with that. Even as survivor. It would give the killer more worthwhile offerings to play. As killer I never play that offering cause it barely affects me anyway.
---
I've been DC'd on the hook and during chases a few times. What gives? I have a pretty stable wired connection—so I doubt that's it. DisZ GaMe is A MeSS
---
Yeah I hope so mate. Dedicated servers would be the best surprise but could be anything.
---
I always get excited when I see updated for DBD so now I need to just wait and see haha. 
---
Just save BP just incase it's something big
---
If I had an IRL emergency, I wouldn't click through several buttons to leave the match. I would exit out of the whole game all at once
---
At least in that case, the survivor is still consuming a hook, the killer still gets points / hook-related perks , and they don't get that feeling of "fuck you" that drives at least a portion of d/cs. So a small silver lining.
---
I'm very confused by this guys comment
---
Hey man let the lady u/MistressChara speak for herself

you beckon little dwight over to you, who tenderly exists his fave locker. little dwight crouches over, without chad urban evasion, might i add, and watches as you put an item on the floor. you croch away with chad urban evasion. skeptical at first, little dwight picks up the item "wow" he thinks "david left me a medkit" but alas it is a slip of paper that reads *butt*
---
An abmination
---
Not really, because I get DC’d, on my screen it’s the killer who DCd, and I’m still in discord with my friends who are still in game, and discord doesn’t kick me off.
---
1) If you don't want to run it don't complain, you're telling the same shit to people who complain about NOED right? "Just cleanse totems LMAO", so in that case just run insidious and you will never have to worry about BT. Also Bubba doesn't even need insidious to counter BT, he has a chainsaw. No one's getting off the hook unless it's a kobe.
---
You just gotta keep at it. It takes forever and ever.
---
Im hoping its some kind of BP event announcement
---
Seriously, I made a post yesterday about how my playstyle is still valid, fun and effective and started a shitstorm because my views are not “the correct” way to play. Like how tf are you gonna tell someone how to play? You’re really just telling them to play so it fits your play style. How about YOU adapt to me, I’m the killer, boi.
---
Yes, they would definitely have to work on new animations and mechanics.
---
Yeah, thinking about it in recent days I realize that the purpose of the Legion changes wasn't really to make him better so much as to make him more balanced and have some counterplay unlike before. So hopefully if he isn't fun with the change, he will be with a tweak or two. And Dream Demon definitely needs some spicing up with his power.
---
It's bad enough that the Reference pose(Or A-Pose if you will) meme is still somehow alive (With everyone calling it T-Posing even though the arms aren't perfectly lined to form a T.) and the Nea is the Killer gag is still being beaten to death.
---
Now we have this abomination combining the 2 into a low class joke.
---
Downvoting.
---
Ohh shit, never knew that. That's good to know lol
---
No out of all the games I played I took the 100 were all people loaded in.
---
Yikes. You would get an ebony omega blink nurse. I remember one game I had where I was playing Trapper and this SWF all used streamers while I used a pudding. As soon as the game began a Nea ran up to me, I put my trap down, she stepped in it and we all started farming together. We all walked away with over 100k bloodpoints each. I'm sorry you couldn't get a willing killer yourself.
---
He didn't have any progress from being dropped because he wasn't dropped until the end, where, at that point it let him go
---
We keep the community alive.
---
My internet cut out through no fault of my own.  Time for me to get punished!
---
It happens when you use a firecracker/party starter. 
---
It causes a noise notification for the killer.
---
It's called hacks and it's obvious. I have recorded proof of it. If you want to live in denial go for it, but don't spread your idiocracy to others, thanks.
---
It's the complaining about NOED after gen rushing that bothers me. 
---
I feel like BHVR needs to give some sort of passive buff to survivors after popping dull totems, or empart some other sort of importance over getting rid of them to new players.
---
If you tunnel and camp; you lose points. Not exactly a mystery here.
---
Please be something good 👏🏻🙏🏻
---
But it doesn't fill up the bar, it just instantly drops you on the ground
---
My pleasure! Cosplayers always spark enjoyment in me and make me want to step up my own game lol
---
for me, Freddy is definitely annoying to play against. especially if there isn't any grass/corn nearby, it's impossible to hide from a freddy that is very thorough.
---
It was my brother on the hook
---
Congrats, you're the problem! :D
---
Why play the game if you're gonna DC when you don't get your way. Sometimes you get dealt a shit hand, doesn't mean you get a pass to fuck over the other three survivors just because you're too much of an asshole to get killed in a game where the only two outcomes are get killed or escape.
---
Plus with iri button you can break pallets instantly.
---
Also, because you mentioned it and I didn't see: by default, that's no tool box and only one survivor working on a generator, with no speed up or speed down perks, it takes a minute and 20 seconds to fully repair a generator, barring Great successes.
---
blinking happens in sync for all survs
---
Haha I hope. We'll see though, BHVR is good at dissapointments and amazing announcements alike.
---
Lmao
---
Her add-one are garbage and her ambush is very counterable. I heard they are planning to change stuff about her soon!
---
i had a daily for Billy, and holy shit was i bad with him! after a few games i got it, and decided never to use him again.
---
oh my stummy hurts lol
---
So you are not seeing the bigger picture.
---
Every.time.
---
This could be interesting then. It did take a long time for a Freddy rework so won't be anytime soon haha.
---
Yeah, you're probably right. It's a shame, but reality is the way it is, I suppose.
---
You'll often find more than one person on one gen, especially at the start of the game and when there are 2/1 gens left. I really feel like people are underestimating him.
---
Is there ANY map thats liked by the community ?
---
It's hard to say if it is more cringey; that someone is talking about how much they would enjoy watching a fictional character get raped or that you decided to screenshot it and show as many people as you could find.
---
Yeah that's what I was doing in that game.
---
looking forward to the trapper nerf where he can only trap himself
---
Well yeah, said it was my first game.
---
i made a spreadsheet which tracks each survivor item with a drop down menu for selecting addons and shows the number of charges and speed increases.
---
i plugged in the toolboxes with the addons shown and i received the same numbers you demo here.
---
it was nice to have confirmation that my numbers are accurate. thanks for the chuckle fellow nerd
---
Had this happen to me lol but at least the killer was near so they might have been panicking idk
---
What does it look like on PC?
---
I dislike Ormond for the damn aura visibility, and I dislike the Game because it's an absolute nightmare when trying to find hex totems.
---
imagine if perk stacking was for killer like imagine being in tier 3 on michael with a low raduis or stacking bbq and chili to where the aura reading lasts for 16 seconds and getting 400% extra bloodpoints along with it or on nurses calling where it affects the entire map
---
Reality can be whatever I want
---
It’s Bill’s face, in the same pose as the console version
---
It’s Bill’s face, in the same pose as the console one.
---
Their rank system is a joke
---
I would absolutely take The Game over Shelter Woods any day of the week. The Game can suck but at least I feel like I have a shot at surviving.
---
On the flip side I legit don't think I've ever won on Shelter Woods.
---
In the video he did the glitch in multiple games. Idk why he’s acting like the victim lmao.  Maybe for them they was doing it for fun but it caused plenty of chaos for the community.
---
I see the most disconnects from Freddy but I see Freddy more than Legion.
---
Ends up at Lery's
---
Dude, Farming Doc is the only reason I still play DbD; my goal becomes "Get 4 BBQ stacks" instead of "Get 4k" and it relieves so much pressure off of me.
---
And making the survivors scream is a fun boon. Really I enjoy the shock-into-M1 when survivors try and smack me with a pallet they just stand at.
---
Or I'll get a survivor that just stands there at the oallet and completely lets me fill up my devious. Tons of fun!
---
Even if the billy 4k he probably depip too.
---
I recently updated my drivers but I noticed no difference. I have 16 GB of ram and never run out of it so that shouldn't be a problem. I have quite some software on my laptop, perhaps something could be conflicting but it's going to be hard to find out what. The game's installed on my HDD. I'm on windows version 8.
---
Nurses calling is an amazing perk, and even more amazing on the spirit thanks to her small heartbeat radius
---
Yeah- fun fact, if the talons around the icon are moving, it means the obsession’s in a chase. Very useful if you aren’t the obsession- you can see if the killer’s currently after them.
---
Activate your Windows man
---
Ok this is literally me every time someone cleanses a lit totem when there isn’t ruin and we can’t confirm they have devour hope.
---
Im pretty sure im destined to stay at rank 8 forever because of the teammates and killers I get. Like even if I go full tryhard mode someone Dcs and the killer is fucking Nurse with 5 blinks or some shit
---
Would nurses, bbq, ruin and monitor be good?
---
Are we really still shitting on Legion?
---
Thats not false...show me a clip from that stream. She also openly said she did it on 2 podcasts. What are ypu saying.
---
I’ve only played Leatherface once but I was actual trash at him. Same with Nurse.    
---
I’m honestly trash at every killer but Freddy and Trapper
---
*fixed an issue that allowed survivors to be trapped in bear traps*
---
When Legion was first announced and before everyone found out about the moonwalk/ add-on exploits, I questioned thinking "Isn't he essentially a perma T3 myers if it's wise to not heal against him but he can just M1 you any time?"
---
The only thing to counterbalance that was that he was 110% speed.
---
People REEEEALLY underestimate how much of an entirely different experience being looped as a 110% and 115% killer is without a really good ability to offset it like projectiles or traps/ teleports.
---
That’s be pretty good. Kate, Quentin (finally), David, Dwight, Meg- I’d be up for it
---
That’s the build I run, sometimes switch ruin for discordance
---
ya a lot of ppl forget about that cause of legion and the end game collapse lol
---
Name 1 game other than DBD that gives a fuck about your shit internet, leave game = get punished, fuck off with your BUT WHAT IF excuses, hhead lookin ass
---
Next you're gonna tell me Evil Within was also made before DBD smh
---
Correct. Survivors also get less points for blitzing gens and immediately leaving.
---
Well, to be fair, with a closed hatch and a trap on your head, it will be pretty annoying.
---
Civ VI.
---
BHVR: I missed the part where that’s my problem
---
Hey! First off thanks for your advice, I checked ingame settings and found that it's using my 960m (which it should, intel HD 4600 probably won't help). I do also feel the game's performance got worse, on maps with rain I just cry as killer since I legit do not even see whether my attacks connect anymore. 
---
I'll see what I can tweak with regards to the resolution or steam's extra launch parameters. I actually have my GPU slightly overclocked, it gives me a few more frames in every game so that's nice but I'll turn it off to see if DBD may run better.
---
As for reducing mist, whenever I offer that thing some survivor offers the purple increased mist and I die a little on the inside lol
---
Weird. I wonder why it's different then. I'd much rather look at that bearded hero.
---
They open the chest, and inside is a picture of a crudely drawn dick with the Entity’s signature on it.
---
“Hi DbD”
---
I usually reroll Billy dailies. I dont mind nurse ones because I can get better with her blinks but i gave up on Billy entirely.
---
Ok ...
---
She basically was having a conversation with BHVR and SHE asked them if she should lighten up on DCing and there response was you're not at the mark yet but yeah you probably should, also the number isn't 35% anymore anyways they're changed it to be lower and haven't told anyone the exact number after the change
---
It is really sad. I'll get on and play and regardless of the outcome, I'll be completely calm and content in the post chat, only to have people attack me like rapid dogs with no remorse. I try really hard to turn people away from acting like that, and tell them that their words are hurtful and whatnot. Often I need to just let them be and not respond. 
---
I'd say don't lose faith in the community entirely. The nice people you do meet will make it worth it, I've found. It's like finding a real diamond amongst thousands of fake ones, and it's nice when that happens. That's my mindset at least. That being said, feel free to add me if you'd like a like minded person on your friends list.
---
Also the burden of proof isn't on me? You made the claim I just said you were wrong
---
Quite like the pretty Lady Leatherface idea. 
---
At least if he facecamps me I have something pretty to look at.
---
It's also cool because you're actually doing it. Survivors can only mimic a tea bag but you can actually get over downed survivors and crouch over their heads reapetedly. It's hillarious.
---
Bill is only on PC so it's different on console
---
Probably because Bill couldn’t get licensed on Console. It’s a bit weird
---
On ps4 I can work through ruin but it's very difficult. I have had a few games that 5 gens are done and ruin is still up cause we cant find them. It's rare but does happen.
---
Of all the licensed characters, I’d honestly say Leatherface is the most likely to get anything- and if he does, it’d probably be Pretty Lady.
---
they wanted to keep the cameras even in moris so survivors had 3rd person and killers had 1st person when they released the hag they tried to do her mori in 1st person but couldnt make it work since it was to jumpy und flashy so people would get sick seeing it from 1st person so they made an exception with her mori being 3rd person but they just made more flashy moris so they kept the 3rd person perspective for alot of the new moris
---
Any individual who can hoist David or Jane in a fireman's carry with only minimal speed loss isn't someone I would call defenseless or weak.
---
okay amigo I will help you out. some of this is bullshit and yo know it.
---
this for example:
---
&gt; Pig or Wraith can surprise people easily on that map
---
is true for literally any map. they can always surprise people easily it's the fuggin point of their abilities, and you're ignoring that the reason they are still weak on that map is how bad they are with pallets. it's peak bad faith shit
---
The Game is one of the best maps for Nurse imo
---
Forget ranking up, its better if you stay around green ranks anyway. You actually see some variety in killers
---
Legal battle? I was aware New Line’s contract with BHVR stayed that they could only use remake stuff, and the same applies to everything Elm Street in the last 9 years, but I wasn’t aware there was any legal trouble over it.
---
Unless you're against me. I get the unhooker.
---
Legion needed changes, the fact you cant moonwalk people or use mixtape is a good thing
---
out of curiosity, what platform are you on?
---
I never used the mixtape or moonwalked but I hate how they're neutering their power and turning them into just another M1 killer.
---
At 4 BBQ you can see auras of every active game on all 3 platforms
---
They are bringing out a sequel to the New Halloween so it is possible for there to be an old Michael movie tie in.
---
Add: after unlocking those they have a chance to appear in bloodwebs of other characters like Dwight's perks in megs bloodweb
---
Good thing endgame collapse is gonna take care of that
---
Agreed, and he also gets Discordance to make this easier.
---
Well, two things with that:
---
A) that won’t be for another two years.
---
B) production on that had currently halted, since Blumhouse/Universal/Miramax actually don’t have the rights to a sequel.
---
You dont get the most pip points or bloodpoints for just steamrolling the other team, survivors also dont get that much for blitzing gens and leaving.
---
You dont have to let the guy go or anything but dont camp etc
---
glad you mentioned David. 
---
i've noticed that the less clothes David is wearing the crazier their play gets. If i see a shirtless David, i know shit is going to get real.
---
i can't imagine the insanity of a David in speedos
---
OwO *notices legion*
---
KKona Clap
---
They just brought out a shirtless David body pillow, BHVR would probably do this.
---
At least he tried
---
Underwear Dwight...take my money
---
i agree
---
Facing Mathieu is like battling Professor Oak
---
But they needed changes, they didnt "do them dirty" they changed all the bullshit about legion. Im assuming the ptb legion will be adjusted if hes terrible but these changes needed to happen. The fact yu could afk and hit people four times with no counter was dumb
---
Pepega
---
I did not know that. well that sucks.
---
Yeah haha. Might be something small like console can join PTB but I think that is near impossible.
---
Not really. Wraith can have problems in open maps because he isn't fully invisible and you can't see shit in corn maps or Swamp maps as Pig. Safe pallets and loops exist on every map, not just on The Game. You complain about The Game when maps like Coldwind Farm, Disturbed Ward, Ironworks of Misery, Haddonfield, Swamp, Ormond or Lery's with a bad RNG exist.
---
That is confirmed for the PTB mate.
---
The other three are running Self Care... I mean, to each their own, but what a waste of time. Especially since So many Killers(including you) are running Sloppy Butcher after the Heal time changes.
---
Hahaha I never understood the fascination with Dwight to be honest.
---
Yeah, it does. Of course, by how successful that film was we’re gonna get a sequel anyway- though it could be made by a different studio and therefore not as good.
---
God I hope not haha.
---
IIRC Kindred maxed out at 24m not Open Handed itself
---
Honestly that would be sorta big in my opinion if they somehow made it so consoles can do ptbs lol.
---
Oh yeah definitely
---
i saw that! i joked with my wife that i would buy it for her
---
Yeah, using Urban Evasion explains why you're stuck at rank 16. You get no boldness points cause you're too immersed.
---
You also found out where Ol' Man McDuffie lives!
---
Wrecker's Yard is one of the easiest map to find totems. Just look for LT walls and there is a 100% chance of a totem being there.
---
That is weird. Wonder why he couldn't get licensed.
---
Literally my point lol
---
That would be huge but I don't think it's possible as Microsoft and Sony would have to veto the patch then release it so in that time they could release on PC and get it released.
---
No you counter claimed so you. Have to prove me wrong..
---
30 charges = 30 seconds added
---
Dude, what about this is edgy?
---
Indeed 😂
---
While we should get more licensed cosmetics, I think that they should prioritize Bunny Feng.
---
Ah thank you for the information. I didn't know he was licensed but that does make sense.
---
Well lets just hope its not like the orginal remake where there rednecks. My god that was trash
---
"Some people should really try playing the other side at some point."
---
The same can be said about high rank survivor mains who play a couple of games of low rank killer and think they understand the experience.
---
There will never be any real understanding in this game.  The people who play for fun is a drop in the ocean, compared to the people who intentionally get off on harassing one another.
---
They needed *some* of the changes they got. Remove the knives until that exploit got fixed, rework Frank's, do the deep wounds timer stuff with the terror radius instead of chase and add a penalty for missing a hit while in Feral. That's all they needed to do.
---
Instead they nuked their power and increased their movespeed when not using their power to compensate.
---
Imagine if they removed Nurse's ability to chain a hit with Blink and made it take longer to charge but increase the max blink distance and made her have a faster movespeed. That's very similar to what they've done to Legion.
---
No idea why they didn’t do it in time for Easter, it was practically set up for them.
---
I call these Ruined Generators and all I hope is that they had to spend two gens worth of time to do that one.
---
You open the chest and a Spring Loaded Plushie version of the killer you’re facing pops out and goes “Nyeh-Nyeh-Nyeh Boo Boo!”
---
Where did they announce it?
---
Where you found this
---
i see.
---
It happens in the extended cut. That junkie he kidnaps kicks him super hard in the balls, and John is like "Aw! You fucker!" and shoves him into a pile of razor wire.
---
I kill both unless the sandbagger did nothing all game
---
the one that seems the most logical/fitting is Concept 4, but all in all these are all nice ideas
---
The true origins of the Jigsaw Killer.
---
a) I didnt let her do a thing, i aint her mommy. 
---
b) she likes the bunny
---
c) PG13 Horror Films are gore infested fuckfests compared to DBD so its fine
---
For me it’s meg or claudette that sandbags
---
If I ran a mori and saw this I'd just pretend I never ran it and only kill you when you're death hook. Farming is welcomed.
---
That’s possible from what you see but that’s also very limited. Think about how many things you aren’t witnessing such as glitches, teammate ping spikes, killer behavior out of your sight lines (survivor may have been teabagging and now killer is nodding after hits or other bm behavior), and even factors outside the game. I’m not excusing dcs I’m just trying to point out that there are so many things to consider for why a dc might happen, many of which you are likely not directly aware of. I hope dcs decrease in the future because they do seem a bit too common at the moment.
---
What does the Kenya image look like?
---
I mean you can report a guy for anything, I doubt anything will happen to him, you may be banned for swearing I know thats the case on xbox.
---
You got the temp ban for swearing I believe, lots of people try to bait it out of you. You got got m8, no need for your attempted witch hunt.
---
Yeah higher ranks people dc on Xbox lol
---
It’s the darkness chapter
---
Once you reach level 30 with Nea Balanced Landing will appear in the blood web with an orange background. Once you buy that Balanced Landing will have a chance to show up in Ace or Meg's bloodweb.
---
...use the hand that doesn't have a claw on it?
---
Legion's only Job was to farm sweet points but the update made him useless for that.
---
Is that Terraria I see? Oh the memories are rushing back!
---
Side note: you dont have to buy it immediately, it will show later on if you dont.
---
bruh moment
---
&gt; they couldn't implement the outfit in three parts, because the hood alone would be mismatched with other outfit parts
---
who cares lmao how is this not true for any other outfit?
---
Torture porn furry
---
I’d be interested to see how many games out of 100 had black screen or not everyone loaded in. That’s more of a feature than a bug at this point.
---
Hope this helps. Btw i set it up in multiple replies so it might be a little bit easier to read
---
Before the new pipping system I would usually always let the last guy go, now it’s a struggle to get a pip even with three people dead
---
I'm a bit late, but it was mentioned elsewhere in this post's comments that it was just a test thing.  Normally it requires all generators being powered.
---
I mean to get 100 games were nothing happend it ttok me 178 tries.
---
Thats so stupid
---
I’m so scared tbh
---
There needs to be a BP/emblem  bonus for survivors to continue playing in games where someone DCs. Also, actual penalties need to be doled out for people who continuously leave match. If nothing else, force a wait time to requeue like League does.
---
tried getting adept achievements and usually i got the achievement even when someone dc'd as long as i sacrificed the other 3. didnt get the achievement on the plagg &lt;.&lt;
---
Petition to make Josh Peck a playable survivor. 
---
*gets hooked* Hello... PAIN!
---
Please do, end my suffering.
---
Honestly. I just let them have hatch if I don’t have whispers. I kinda look around if they’re injured and just turn my headset up but other than that I don’t try too hard to find them.
---
Runs Unrelenting x4: At that point your misses have Double Strike. 
---
Runs Agitation x2 Iron Grasp x2: Buckle Up, fucker, we’re going on a long car ride.
---
oh. Now it makes more sense
---
Honestly this is why I don’t doctor
---
Clever!
---
I mean, if you wanna farm points efficiently, nurse and billy are still king.
---
So you are camping with a smaller terror radius?
---
Kind of off-topic but what peeves me off about killer mains is their want and need for 4Ks each game. It’s like when they don’t kill everyone in a match, they lost it completely. You could get one kill and still secure a good amount of bloodpoints if you chased a lot and patrolled gens, and tbh isn’t that one of the main desires for playing killer? To get more bloodpoints then what you’d normally get as a survivor? Idk, I feel like people’s priorities are in the wrong places.
---
Thickening the fog around you sounds like a billboard to the killer
---
I get soo pissed. Checks the genes first you dummy.
---
&gt; "the facts" not being on someone's side doesn't change their opinion of the map.
---
lmfao "who cares about facts I wanna be a victim"
---
why didnt you break the pallet?
---
We'll Make It. BT is great, but i just prefer always having an unhook bonus rather than having to be in the terror radius.
---
After 3 mins..
---
Its doesnt matter if they were bad or not. If you think of it the way you are, smurf accounts from rank 1 players would never leave rank 20
---
these sound like really weak perks tbh
---
Please, I need Toxic Quentin in my life, do his cute fsce and Beanie Justice!
---
I'm not approving rape jokes either.
---
But I find it weird death and murder jokes are ok and encouraged, but rape is considered the worst thing ever.
---
Rape victims can go on to lead full lives. Murder victims are dead for eternity and will never see their loved ones again or have any happiness, ever.
---
Murder is objectively worse than rape. (And people who disagree are saying that it would have been better if rape victims had died instead).
---
It's weird.
---
Lmao! The way killers move on consoles is so robotic 😂😂😂
---
It depends what your term of winning is. Because if you just do gens then escape you won't pip. So if ranking up is your objective you wouldn't want to rush gens. But if you think escaping is winning then it is your only objective.
---
Yeah, I'm more frustrated as survivor than as 0 emblems nurse lol.
---
dont dc because it just wastes the killers time alive
---
If they notice it, yes absolutely.  But that's kind of the idea for his perks. He get's found, but can evade the killer &amp; waste their time.
---
Straight to the feels.
---
PC
---
Borrowed time is more practical. As in it can be used more I think. I have a savior build with David. I use borrowed, wglf, well make it, and either dead hard/empathy/DS. It works really well and I get anton of blood points.
---
Ehhh. If you're high rank WMI is better, since killers aren't gonna be camping as much. BT is good towards end game when the exit gates are powered, since the killer will most likey hard patrol the hook.
---
Disable v sync
---
He doesn't have **P E B B L E**, so it wasn't that. I think OP might have dropped a Party Starter or a Fire Cracker.
---
&gt; Legion is really getting more of a buff unless you specifically used Frank's Mixtape all the time or were cheating. Being able to actually hit people normally is going to be more effective than using FF 27 times unless you're bad at killer generally.
---
Your comment is like a breathe of fresh air on this subreddit
---
Someone who knows what they're talking about and have played the game for more than 300 hours at least
---
please put a picture i dont own smash
---
Nurse says thank you
---
I feel that pain. One night I used two party streamers and one green envelope and I was the one with the infinite load screen all three times
---
Just give me my Bunny Feng BHVR please.
---
Getting reported for a swear word doesn’t anything. They literally just delete it and move along. Are you worried or something?
---
I'm bad with Trapper and Hag since the setting up playstyle is something I don't like and ain't good at. Also Huntress cuz I suck at aiming.
---
spine chill is a good stealth perk
---
Pussy 
---
*/s*
---
The worst part is that this isn't even a shitpost.
---
One With The Shadows and Force Of Will sound horrible. OWTS especially. 'Hey, the fog is thicker than normal over here, lmao there's a Survivor with 25 meters of me.' Killer's already find Survivors easily within 32 meters with Whispers, do you really think they wouldn't find them even easier with OWTS? And Force Of Will just sounds plain useless. The locker perk is actually a neat idea though.
---
I thought it was Legion this time and Freddy down the road?
---
What if the devs began to penalized players for dc-ing
---
I'm pretty sure they said it was both. They have been working on Freddy for months as they have reworked all his powers.
---
Yeah, but he is gonna get nerfed soon.
---
They really hand out temp bans for cussing? I didn’t know Playstation was PG 13. If they’re gonna hyper control the way users talk then maybe Sony should equally censor the non PG content they release on their platform. Tf kind bullshit.
---
Me and my friends ( 4man ) all once chipped in a party streamer and the killer brought an ebony. The killer didn’t want his ebony going to waste and ended up being an asshole
---
Stab Wounds Study is more Evil than Cold Dirt. Cold Dirt is powerful but it isn't broken.
---
I had game kind of similar to this. An injured Laurie was trying to self-care herself inside the killer shack. She thought the god pallet was still there. However, the god pallet was an illusionary pallet. She thought it was safe until I walked right through the pallet and smacked her down. She DCed right after that.
---
I got a warning. That worries me real bad.
---
Oh ok
---
It was always to get "merciless killer", however a 4k was always "merciless killer" before. Now only double pip is merciless. Side effect to what they changed and we can only hope they change the achievement to say "get a 4k with the 3 perks". 
---
Else it's a load of crap how much harder adept killer is vs adept survivor
---
It's not a win if Survivors are spend the whole game t bagging and still get away. The devs want the killers to play for the survivors' enjoyment. But it's not enjoyable getting pallet and window looped, flashlighted, bodyblocked, all while getting butt danced, not even mentioning post game toxicity. There are games where I did well and got rewarded well because I hooked everyone, used my ability like crazy, and no one was safe. Aaand 2/3 people still get away and butt dance on their way out. Getting humiliated like that is not a win by any stretch of the imagination no matter who it is devs.
---
I've pulled many a dumb fool off their gen with just pill bottle (maybe with a cube too) if I'm honest, but I've played far too much stinkman nugget boy. 
---
But yeah, brush and m&amp;a is super fun and pill bottle is powerful as it is, so I rate 👍🏻
---
Why is it stupid? Every multiplayer game I know has a leave button, even the ones considered highly competitive.
---
Just be like ”we should play together sometime, I really need help improving :/”
---
we used to not really have an excuse to sweat that much (I personally didn't care about it, and often just gave the last one the hatch).
---
But with the pipping changes it's possible to safety pip or even depip with 2 or 3 kills when you hit high purple ranks and above.
---
At those ranks, both killers and survivors need to sweat in order to pip (survivors got a little bandaid patch recently but it's still harder than before).
---
Why not just, idk . . . Force them out?
---
Well it says removed. I really liked it so I was just wondering why you removed it.
---
Maybe a 12%bloodpoint bonus for altruism and objective stuff each person gone?
---
Hahaha, the irony of using the word idiocracy to mean idiocy. You'll get'em next time kid.
---
Because, idk... I like reading?
---
Thanks lol. He doesnt even know whats coming for him.
---
Yeah thats what I was thinking about. It probably have something to do with so called rape myth and somewhat being easier for people to rape than to kill (maybe?), so rape jokes might be more dangerous than murder jokes in terms of mental barrier and straight up consequences, but thats a complex subject and I still find the whole subject largely weird
---
What are you, idk . . . Reading?
---
Like make perks that you gain tokens by destroying totems. Like 2 tokens destroyed to instantly overcome exhaustion. That would also allow a survivor perk to be “OP” but not abused. At most it could be used twice in a match.
---
I got banned for a week because my gamer tag was Bucking_Fitches, no warning too, they just changed my name and banned me without me even knowing it was illegal. I wish I bought a PC instead of this garbage thing
---
Yup, that's what I meant, thanks for the specifications. I personally just dont play killer for a whole month to derank enough so I have some chances of getting the achievement. Next month is The Spirit for me. Wish me luck.
---
Dude, I laugh a lot, sometimes for no apparent reason, making it hard to focus on certain things, best way to represent that is with Tier 1 madness. If you have a better name and way to convey that without everything else in the perk just coming up as OP, then spit it out, if all you have is bitching about something being "edgy" is the name, stop bitching, go find something that you like seeing that isn't so "edgy".
---
after the update legion will be the only killer to be able to get hooked by the survivors
---
Having an opinion that's decently common = being a victim, you actually have no logic, I'm praying for the few brain cells you have left.
---
At this point Id get rid of the 4%/struggle mechanic.
---
Okay we would have less highlights for reddit and youtube, but is it really worth having a mechanic that quitters can and will abuse?
---
Why even bother banning someone for only 24h, if Legion exploiters are going to get a 24h ban I'm disappointed.
---
Never had luck with it. Only once or twice did it last more than a minute and gens still popped. Tapping gens only slows it down 10-20 seconds with one person on a gen.
---
As you say, it requires to 4k and 2 pip. I had my worst time with Plague, didn't had too many problems with the rest (i did Freddy before the new requirements though).
---
The remake was made by michael bays company without new line cinemas permission
---
Balanced landing is pretty solid on that map and if you're a real asshole survivor, it's not hard to lead the killer to another survivor that doesn't have that perk.
---
Yup, so we need a new solution
---
Yeah I mean don't get me wrong, this is just a dumb meme. I main the stinky boy and my favourite build is green dress and either cube/speed, *at least* 2 in the dream world at any time is my goal. 
---
I do love playing paint brush with m&amp;a though just because going out of my way to scare the shit out people is better than 'winning' or tryharding in those games. In that case z block really catches people off and can be fun, but definitely is far from a good, game winning build.
---
LOL. I think reality is, Entity hates me because I'm flat out bad at this game. XD
---
lol yes if you call a map shit for survivors and ignore any and all facts to the contrary by hiding behind this thin veil of an excuse you are playing victim
---
you literally said that some random ass opinion is more important than the facts fam
---
Yeah you will definitely get a ban for swearing and calling the person a name. Just let it be, he can get you for harassment also.
---
Ahh yeah my bad, sorry!
---
Yeah the one who asked questions was joking, we typed in the chat of his stream after he told us he was streaming. He was all good lol.
---
Odd, New Line are credited as a production company alongside Platinum Dunes.
---
PLEASEEEE
---
If you pip, you (theoretically) go against better killers. Why would you do that? It is so much easier to bully killers at lower levels. GG EZ. Noob Killer. 
---
Maybe the very  beginning of matches too? Or is that too unreliable?
---
Pretty sure you didn't watch the same video I did. While he was on the ground he teleported both to the hooked survivor before being picked up, and back to a healing survivor when the killer went back to hook.  
---
Just watch the video.
---
I'm telling you man, that game was a ride. He had the add-on that makes one random trap open every however many seconds, and he put it in front of the exit gate, but remember me made it take forever to open so it just opened on my friend while he was opening the door. It was hilarious.
---
how was i supposed to know that the spirit with no ruin or toth would have haunted ground? geez...
---
I get changing the name but banning without a warning makes no sense. I’d def play on PC if i could because the Playstation policy is literally bullshit.
---
*Worried Dwight noises*
---
Camping with Insidious
---
Takes advantage of a survivor’s altruism objectives to mind-game a trap.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;DbD community overall and r/deadbydaylight in particular do a lot of murder-related jokes. I get it that murder jokes come more natural in gaming community, while rape-related ones are basically unrelated outsiders.
---
I'm pretty sure a game where your one objective is to either murder, or not get murdered is the reason murder jokes are higher in dbd....
---
Tunneling is how you spell genrush
---
Not tunnelling: 1 guy on hook, 1 guy being chased, 1 guy going for the save and 1 guy healing.
---
Tunnelling: 1 guy saving, 1 guy on hook, 2 on gens
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/413621222](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/413621222)  our game is at 1:33:10 for anyone interested hahaha.
---
Yeah but at higher ranks teammates are generally better.
---
I'm... not even going to ask about the scenario you presented. I personally don't think a kid should be playing this game unless we're talking about someone who's around High School age- less because of the violence/graphic content, and more because of the toxicity of end game chat.
---
The issue is that there is absolutely no penalty for quitting mid-game, and unlike some games (Like Overwatch) where you can get new teammates in Quick Play/Arcade Modes, DBD doesn't have that. If someone DC's, you have to live with it and hope the rest of your team doesn't follow suit.
---
And then, on the side of killer, if someone DC's and you keep trying to win (Because, well, that's sorta the point) then it just feels cheap to the Survivors, and unfun for the killer as most of them just give up anyway. They'll give up on chases and take the fun out of the game.
---
It has ALWAYS required you to double pip. The description of the achievements literally say "As X Killer, get a Merciless victory using only their 3 unique perks." A Merciless victory, after the emblem update, has always been a double pip.
---
Game files back when nurse was released. Either came with a deleted character or just to throw data miners off.
---
lmao this is the second time I've gotten this comment on this subreddit
---
It would be cool if when you equip the Old Michael Myers cosmetics, it also changes the chase music to this: https://youtu.be/6yAZprPJWA8
---
The fact that this post made you mad.
---
Soon
---
nooS
---
Ok but *WHY*
---
Where do you suggest they hide them? Anywhere they are on the map will be easy to find unless they are literally invisible
---
What the fuck? That's literally never happened to me. I'm pretty sure they have an algorithm that prevents that from happening. If you have a clip or something you can produce to show me I'll believe you but for now I'm calling bullshit
---
I rough farm. Gunna keep track of how many times I hook. May pull your boney butt off gen to do so. Once people 2hooked. Im done. Just cuss we hook doesnt mean we want you to die :D
---
Thanks, Capt obvious.
---
That would be dope but i think it would have to be implemented with the dedicated servers
---
Games against Plag end too quickly for 2 pips. Same goes for Legion. If you didn't get 2 pips, killer probably didn't either if it didn't last long
---
It's real finicky but i always say press the button like you're going for a light lunge
---
Nuh-uh!
---
Pallet and window looping is literally how you play the game, you have no idea what the game entails and what really is toxic lemme just pull up the world's smallest violin for you
---
wait they really did that? wtf bhvr why?!... well they created a reason do depip, because there's no way you'll get adept on certain killers, when you're red or even purple rank lol
---
I meant if you're playing the game and need to do something small and quick like that, it's way more convenient to just quit and do what you gotta do, then come back.
---
I understand the issue so I'm not even gonna comment on the rest of your reply. I was replying to someone who thought it was stupid to have a quit option in an online video game, because it isn't stupid at all.
---
53 seconds is much better than 80 seconds. It's literally 50% faster.
---
Well, that all depends on your playstyle now isn't it? I don't care that much to change the thing entirely, I did this out of boredom, if you like it, great, if not, it's a good thing this isn't official content and you don't have to waste your money on it.
---
Are those HardPillz to swallow?
---
He was running devour hope, and he didn’t give the entity any
---
To be honest, I don't know what I want for the ranking system lol.
---
Yeah-uh!
---
I was playing a game where we had 3 gens done, I had just finished one with a teammate. We walk by a totem and I shake my head and keep pointing and shit but she continues. Shure enough spirit was in a chase and germs a hook. That same dumb bitch ditched me on the gen for the save and also got hooked. Feelsbadman
---
Or, alternatively:
---
https://youtu.be/XmdPe8_Bfys
---
And when you select Michael, it plays 3:02 onwards of this:
---
https://youtu.be/ee1CuMf5x40
---
Whhhaaaaaaat!?!? Only really counts with top tier gameplay as everyone needs to be “pushing it” to make those few seconds count. Like i have literally had a killer run at me while i was doing the last gen and if i didnt have a certain add-on or toolbox i would have never finished the gen and got that sweet adrenaline! 
---
Although sometimes all you do is get the guy getting chased killed because noed is active now lol
---
But I made very valid points!
---
depends on the player
---
It's happened at least 5 times in the last few days, 3 of which were back to back... this game is buggy as hell, so hard to believe this happens?
---
My money is on ghostface getting announced
---
You totally killed that survivor with facts and logic.
---
A decent game with no bitching? And on console no less, who did you sell your soul to?
---
I think its r1 on the hatch im not to sure though i cant remember off the top of my head
---
You just gave me an idea. Devour hope on spirit is probably a good idea lol
---
Whilst the description has always said that, the only requirement it used to have was that no one survived. With the plague dlc it was changed to match the description
---
ahhh damn yeah i kinda forgot about that. I mean if you think about it, a killer can be host for a whole lobby including the other killer huh? Idk how that stuff works, i'm just ready for the news, tired of staring at my computer in anticipation lol
---
No it didn't, before the update (i don't remember when but no too much time away) it only required to 4k.
---
Actually double pipping is enough. I got Adept Plague with the last survivor escaping through the hatch. I had a gold Devout and the rest Iri I think.
---
Yeah, I posted original comments the moment after I saw the trailer, before that was said
---
Trying to bait out a sweat word?  Are we fucking 5 years old?  You fucked up, got baited into saying something you knew you shouldn't.  Just eat your temporary comm ban and move on with your life.  You really think it's worthwhile to scheme in DMs so you can try and snitch to mom if he winds up swearing at you?  Ffs, man.
---
ben shapiro has my favorite unique survivor perk, Poodle Bark
---
Ghostface skin for legion pogchamp
---
OMG yes it's Soo freaking cute. She is the only killer I try to use as many pallets on as possible xD (note that I loop before using it. I don't waste pallets guys)
---
*squeak* 
---
Man, jigsaw is just the cutest. ;)
---
O^I^^N^^^K
---
I'm a Killer main, i play a lot of survivor too. But i HATE Doctor, it's so annoying, but i don't DC anyway.
---
Good job mate!
---
Yup
---
I’ve been trying to get adept plague. Fucking impossible.
---
Already a Garbage post. Then you hit them with the unnecessary "say hi to r/deadbydaylight".
---
oh no it's my bad !! I thought someone else uploaded this clip. like someone took URS and uploaded
---
Main advice: don't go into tier 3 right away, stalk the survivors just enough so you're one tap away from t3. And when you're close enough to a survivor in a chase, tap and bam, an instadown. 
---
Also monitor&amp;abuse perk and dead rabbit  add-on are really good on him since they make your terror radius smaller =&gt; helps you to sneak up on survivors
---
Depends really
---
Soonish
---
That's why statistics can be dangerous! :)
---
Not just that, the controller is shit and the fps is even shittier
---
I would scream and sit my butt in front of TV for like the entire week.
---
Im not surge but I believe they said is small but that we never saw, so this game mode would be outta question by is magnitude. They would put in PTB before, for some tweaks.
---
Honestly I wasnt even hyped about this but the amount of post about it made me anxious
---
The non kind way is much much faster tho. I'm sure the survivor wont take it personally.
---
Me too
---
Wasting pallets is worth it if it means more OINKS
---
I enjoy most maps but this particular selection is nightmare if you are Huntress. Big maps, bad visiblity, horrible collision detection and poor optimalization on Yamaoka and Ski Lodge.
---
Get monitor and abuse, no terror radius at tier one. Stay hidden when stalking to get the maximum stalk points. Save your tier 3 for when you think you are going to need it and never pop tier 3 unless you're right on top of the survivor. Scratched mirror+boyfriends memo is always fun. Tombstones are a lil fcked up but can be pretty fun. Being an M1 killer spirits fury+enduring is always solid. Any questions in particular i can help ya
---
"oinks"
---
What do you think of his rework? Anything you want them to keep?
---
I don't think you can compare these two perks. They both serve different purposes.
---
We'll make it is for a quick heal and lasts a tremendous period of time, while it can come in clutch, just like borrowed time We'll make it is useful throughout the trial and can be used on multiple quickly if you get that perfect scenario.
---
Borrowed time on the other hand is the clutch play perk. You can't save that persons health state but you can sure as shit get them to the exit gate if they eat a hit. It's usefulness comes into play right at the end of the trial. (Or in 95% of cases I've seen it has) 
---
But to answer the original question, We'll make it. But Borrowed time is a top tier perk if you're looking for that save play... OR you could just make a savior build out of them both!
---
Laurie and Michael have been ''featured" for a while now.
---
I'm calling licensed cosmetics for them.
---
That's a trade secret- xD
---
These bans are just bullshit altogether. Like with the Legion bans, if BHVR can't be bothered to properly test things before sending them out the door, why should people be punished for using it? Just disable the addons temporarily to avoid it altogether... Not to mention, it's hardly an exploit. The add-ons just stack. I know for a fact people have been banned for using it when they didn't even know it's an exploit, because it really doesn't seem like one. Just seems like an OP add-on combo.
---
thanks!! it was a struggle but it worked out!
---
Then there would be even more tunneling and camping
---
No, you just have to be good enough, which to be fair, most people aren't
---
i know im just anxiously waiting to see the rework notes
---
Probably an oversight. Hopefully an oversight. We can only hope they realize it and change it...
---
I know it exists, I've just never seen it in the flesh.  I remember seeing an ad for it with apb reloaded or gta or some such, and it was throwing red and blues up on the wall as cop lights, and something with flames as well.  Just curious as to how good it looks in reality, and not on a promo vid!
---
That's actually genius
---
Oh you want it to be like it was back in the olden days? Yeah I’ll pass on that.
---
Haha same here. The talk about licensed cosmetics etc got me hype. Hopefully it's not some pointless thing nobody cares about
---
Where does the furry come in?
---
wait a minute... the Do Not Click My Name guy was in Monto’s video.
---
Wait, like reported through PSN? Cause I have said much worse things than "Bitch, please" and have never received any sort of warning. Are you sure you didn't actually say something much worse?  
---
Also, the others are right. It is incredibly petty to try and "get" them back and really just gives them more power since now you're spending extra-curricular time on them which is exactly what they want.
---
Well the in game tutorial says to tap it when trying to grab but it never works for me. Usually just slaps them, sucks when having a hatch stand off
---
The Pig...
---
Would be funny to see survivors try to do a standoff after the endgame update and get it closed in their face xD
---
I'm expecting....
---
2vX announcement
---
Freddy rework details
---
Something involving a liscense (cosmetics, new killer announcement etc)
---
Something very insignificant to the game that shouldn't be hyped up
---
Maybe even rank rewards?
---
One of these things
---
The sky is blue. Change my mind
---
I'm actually the little brother. The guy messaged me afterwards and was super sorry about it. The worse part was right as the other survivor was a out to save me, the hatch closed. I just ended up killing myself on the hook because the killer was right there and prolly would have farmed
---
They were SWF. They apparently though these are the most disliked maps by killers and wanted me to have a bad time no matter what map gets picked. Both DCers also waited until the end chat for their friends to throw some insults at me.
---
Ah understandable
---
Spine Chill completely counters it, tho. Which I use myself! :)
---
Yeah, 8 minutes of downs IS pretty rude, especially with no reciprocation.  Guess I got myself an ass and an umption now! 
---
My bad, as obviously your case is different.  I just see a lot of posts berating killers who "go sweaty try hard" in a busted match, and it can trigger me a bit.
---
I have only encountered 4-5 obvious hackers in DBD during something like 1300 hours, but it only makes me wonder of all the hackers I've encountered that were not obvious. I have friends who's actual work is finding hackers in games, and they tell me some very discouraging numbers and stories of how "most" hackers are not so obvious. In shooters you only see the people who have 100% headshot accuracy on full auto fire. Most hackers are not those. You can set it to be 30% headshots and use a non-automatic weapon. You can just have wallhacks. You can make it so that you see all the items(this is, for example a thing in Apex Legends. Hackers already know where all the highest quality loot are and just run straight to it, ignoring everything else on the way), you can just eliminate recoil. In DBD instead of running super fast, you can make it that you just run the same speed as the killer, or 1-2% slower. Nobody would ever notice, but it would make you uncatchable. I HAVE met survivors who only used speed just to equalise it with killers. I noticed it when they just ran in a straight line across the map and I never caught up to them. I was like 3 meters away from them, and they just ran straight for a good 10 seconds and I was still 3 meters from them after that. Etc.
---
Yeah that's too optimistic. It'd be great but I think they would hype it up more if that were to be implemented soon..
---
just try and keep calm and remember that you drop the survivor your holding to go after more stupid survivors whom are trying to body block you!
---
&gt; It has ALWAYS required you to double pip.   
---
&gt; A Merciless victory, after the emblem update, has always been a double pip. 
---
Pick one.
---
I would actually cry tears of joy. 
---
but it likely isn't.
---
I didn't know this, so it's double piping then.
---
You think killers' priorities are in the wrong place... when they try to kill the survivors instead of farming bloodpoints?
---
That’s fucking stupid.  They’re fucking stupid.
---
This is pretty satisfying. What was the chat like after the game?
---
Survivor: T-Bags and Flash Taunts
---
Killer: Shuts Hatch, stares at Survivor
---
S: Oh dear entity what have I done-
---
*DC Noise.*
---
Indeed.
---
yeah but ruin just makes survivors better because landing great skill checks is important and ruin is great on every killer except nurse and billy since they have great map pressure running hillbilly with noed is stupid to me because his chainsaw is already good enough
---
They did the glitch , they deserve the ban. 
---
And it's only 24 hours so what the f is he crying about? He did it intentionally so he should be happy it's not a week like I got for pretending to be a bot (for like 2 games) by mashing LMB to see the reaction of the survivors.
---
Then why bother getting these add ons in the bloodweb? We dont just collectvadd one to never use them. We will use these add ons since we spent our hard earned bloodpoints on it.
---
Tried twice and called it quits. I fucking hate what they've done to adept achievements. Adept killer is so much more bullshit now than survivor. 
---
4K and survive were perfectly fine. This change is nonsense.
---
It was console, so no chat. I messaged the survivor and he didn’t reply lol
---
this dudes hilarious lmao
---
just being able to get a sacrifice isnt the only thing that makes a good killer tho
---
True and I respect that
---
I still can't believe it's bad enough now that people actually have to abandon playing killer for awhile to even have a chance at an achievement. The pip rework is embarrassing
---
You are still entitled to an opinion regardless of the "facts" you speak of sis. No ones playing the victim because they don't like a map, that's completely illogical. And no not a random opinion, an opinion that's favored by majority compared to yours. Your facts are just that the pallets aren't as bad as they used to be, that isn't the only reason people dislike the map, and they are entitled to dislike it, they can if they want. It's the people like you who think everyone else needs the same opinion, and you have to cram it down their throat, that ruin it for every other person that actually enjoys debating. Less people agree with your mindset and for good reason, it's just not a fun map to play on, regardless of why it feels that way. Learn to accept when other people have different opinions than you and grow up. 
---
That's like saying because my least favorite color is yellow and I dislike it, I need to provide factual evidence of why its a bad color or else I'm playing the victim.
---
Actually kicking myself in the head for not thinking of that haha.
---
Hardly. Since they’re removing your ability to pull this kind of trick from the game. :)
---
Honestly I'm legit surprised i got a 4K as Wraith. Don't know why it has to incur anger or anything of the like. People act like its the Killer's job to let hatch go. Sure, sometimes I do let the Survivor go, other times I do things like this. I'm just surprised the simple mindgame worked.
---
I'll see what I can do. I'm currently looking into something better than my 960m for sure, but I was genuinely starting to wonder if that's the only problem here since I still pull more fps in any AAA title so yeah...
---
Thanks a lot for your help!
---
I had a game today where the killer was done within 5 mintues. He got 4k with 14k Bloodpoints. I don't know if that's enough to (black)pip.
---
He is though
---
Well this is a surprise. I was the Nea you accidentally trash talked instead of Jane.
---
ehh...
---
Killer is always better (or at least more effective), teammates seem kinda the same at all ranks.
---
At this point my beef is with boring killers (killers who play boring) and bad teammates.
---
Now I can just close the hatch instead. It is a great change! I am loving the idea of the collapse so much.
---
I'm confused how how a killer with instadowns isnt op? Like what???
---
I call a liar when I see it. He’s not tame at all in sportsmanship, and you’d be a fool to defend it.
---
They just need to change it to 4k, not merciless. And INCLUDE DC’s ! Not my fault a survivor is mad they got downed.
---
I’m truly sorry about that
---
That's alright man, it happens.
---
im bad with nurse because i dont have good muscle memory with her, and at the moment i have no addons or perks on her.
---
Fuckin agreed. And I'm in morning over Legion still.
---
I know, but that really wasn't the point of the shitpost
---
I actually tought it was refreshing that you went for a hook. Party Streamers + Ebony Mori is kind of an "overused" meme
---
Their point is you really don't need to 4k every game to have fun, or even win. 4ks are more of a domination than a win condition and they should be a bonus, not the goal
---
It's a video game.. how can you say anything about having manners.
---
only because I didn't get why anyone would want that
---
Maybe I am a robot- just ah, don't ask me to do a Captcha.
---
These add-ons should not exist, much like extra blinks or omegablinks. 
---
I may look like a sad survivor main but I play 50/50
---
And by doing so, you power both exit gates. Still not a hatch grab, still not a cheap trick.
---
Please don't tell me *this* is the announcement...

---
Pretty sure this game came out way before they made the perk , so technically DbD should be getting the copyright strike.
---
I mostly like it, but the left side seems a bit bland. Maybe instead of a little dirt hill you could put a box with a pallet or something? Otherwise i really like how you did it.
---
objectively not if there are 2-3 gens left.
---
Honestly speaking, I find myself surviving matches where the first survivor DC's after a minute and a half chase than regular 4 man lobbies.
---
A hooked survivor is a lot more pressure than a dead survivor.
---
I have the power of God, anime, and Frank's Mixtape on my side!
---
Surely it is. As predicted, dissapointed. Nea looks badass though.
---
Been doing a lot of farming as legion lately.
---
I usually check profiles before the game starts, see who's SWF and what not.
---
Ran into a couple furries. 
---
Slapped on an ebony mori of course.
---
4x party streamers get thrown up.
---
Mori'd them all.
---
Thanked them for 100k+ points at the end while they got something like 8k at most.
---
That was a very anticlimactic surprise. 
---
More expensive cosmetics.

r/dbdgonewild

The entire achievement is ridiculous now. As you said, *somebody else leaving* can screw your achievement. The achievement literally isn't even in your control at that point, if you think about it. 
---
If you finish the game too fast, you don't get it. Oh you dominated the game? Too bad, your chases weren't long enough and you didn't get enough hooks. It's ridiculous how fucked the requirements are now. Once I got a 4K twice but the entity was like "nah, should've done more shit" I was done. 
---
It's pathetic. It's not being "Adept" if you purposely need to keep the game going longer to achieve it. Getting all 4 kills perfectly summed up what an Adept killer should be.
---
Haha, it probably was.
---
so fucking tired of cosmetics
---
It's not like they're hacking or cheating lol. These things are in the game so it's fair game to use them.
---
Oh, no, it's fine. They deserved it. I'm just surprised a game I played in popped up like this lol
---
WeirdChamp lol
---
Platform: PC  
---
Type of Bug: In game losing connection to host.   
---
Description: I have played about 30 games over the last week and have been unable to finish 90% of them as I am randomly disconnected about 8 minutes in. It always says lost connection to host and more often than not I get to keep my item and earn some bloodpoints so it is not reading it as a forced disconnect on my side. My internet is stable and I only have this problem in Dead By Daylight. I LITERALLY cannot play the game anymore I hoped it would go after a week therefore REPRODUCTION RATE: 100%   
---
I have finished one game but it was very short. System specs: AMD-FX 8120 8-Core CPU, ASUS M5A99X Evo motherboard, 16 GB ram, game is saved onto a 1TB Seagate Hard drive, Windows 10 on SSD, GTX 1060.
---
What a troll. Surprise! You knew more cosmetics were coming but here it is! News you already knew! Surprise!
---
Were you spectating?
---
I laughed at this announcement. They are basically doing something that everyone already had access every PTB... check the game files for upcoming cosmetics. 
---
Thanks, BHVR. I don't know what we would've done without this!
---
I wouldn't mind that actually. Since clown we haven't had any licensed characters and usually chapters come with a separate killer outfit to match the theme of the chapter. If this rule of themes now applies to licensed killers too Legion would be the only person that could fit the ghost face theme. Regardless of the fact that they are getting completely gutted.
---
SORCERY!
---
id say it needs at least 2 more DCs to be the real experience
---
why does nea alway get the better cosmetics :/
---
*Sees Jane get sacrificed*
---
They just hooked Oprah! ...OPRAH!
---
Same. Good point on the patch update, it was around that time I've had issues too. Cannot finish a game if it goes on for longer than 8ish minutes.
---
if this is the surprised announcement got to say I am slightly disappointed
---
Borrowed Time. It's getting buffed. Again.
---
Me and Meg fused together and stuck in a palet next to a Billy who refused to destroy the palet until Ace died and Meg DCed.
---
that clown outfit is wild tho
---
Well Party Streamers are RARE items, easy to find in he Bloodweb.  Ebonies are Ultra Rare Offerings that are hard to find in most bloodwebs and cost much more than a Party Streamer, and also if you had 4 Party Streamers and played decently well I doubt you left the match with 2 Bloodpoints.
---
Would be hilarious lol
---
Can't wait to get some ignorant survivors who don't ever read patch notes and won't know about the hatch closing.
---
We can expect a lotta salt from survivors who feel entitled to have their free escape.
---
That's the first Adam look I actually like....minus whatever the fuck they did to his hair.
---
This is far from something to be proud of.
---
That's fine~ I enjoy playing the game. I don't need a 4K to enjoy playing DBD. I've "lost" several games, but I enjoy playing as a creature from either horror iconography like Myers or Freddy, or playing as a creepy cretin of the night like the Doctor, Spirit, etc. I play Dead by Daylight because its an entertaining, make your own horror movie esque game. Is the movie going to be goofy, with survivor shenanigans and the like, or is it going to be Jumpscare Myers coming out of nowhere. Dead by Daylight is a game I enjoy. It has its problems and it has the salty side of the community, but that isn't going to let me get angry or sad or any other negative emotion.
---
So why does it matter, whether or not what I can and can't do, as long as it doesn't affect me having fun in the process and I'm not an ass about it?
---
Facecamping is also in the game, so that makes it fair?
---
Someone needs to actually make franks mixtape
---
Why does David King's face look like the Colonel from the A-Team had a love child with his own sister?
---
Seems to be cosmetics 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58915/cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-2-7-0/p1?new=1
---
No, Entity Juice-
---
Imagine getting upset about a hatch grab
---
I guess they want to reveal costumes before the data miners do after every patch.
---
Why BHVR?😞
---
True. Sad, but true.
---
You made the fatal mistake of ‘attempting to run away.’ Killers often find this an op strat that is unbalanced and proceed to camp.
---
I didn't even get it until I saw this comment. God damn it. I hate everything.
---
These look great! Not sure why the complaints after we’ve already had a ton of announcements on upcoming things that aren’t cosmetics.
---
You don't get why people would want to organize things the way they want?
---
GET OUT!
---
*laughs in doctor main*
---
IIRC brown / common toolbox does not have increased skill check chance, just reduced success zones.  Unless it's not noted in the text the repair speed should be the same with yellow.
---
Fastest way to gain blood points:   
---
1. Select the Dr. Killer.  
---
2. Equip the following perks:  
---
a. BBQ &amp; Chili  
---
b. Distressing  
---
c.  Ruin  
---
d. Unnerving Presence (this can be subbed out for another perk of your choice, such as nurses calling if the lobby has 4 Claudettes and you know they are going to be self-caring etc. )  
---
3. Play as if you don't know where the Ruin is, because most smart SWF will following your early game movement to find out if your going to camp or protect your Ruin totem. So avoid that.   
---
That's basically it. If your not good at Dr. or not a killer main then don't sweat it. You will easily get more blood points then your Survivor counterpart every game regardless. As long as you don't camp (need those BBQ stacks) and let yourself get infinite looped. Best maps for this build are small maps in general: Ie. Haddonfield, gideon, leyer's,
---
holy fuck you are upset about this lmfao
---
&gt; an opinion that's favored by majority compared to yours
---
lmfao literally a logical fallacy
---
Also can the other ladies that aren't Nea, Meg and Claudette start getting some more regular love? 
---
It's not like Feng, Kate, and Jane are super unpopular or anything.
---
I love Janes. Can't wait for this to be all auric cells though 😕
---
I know BHVR has some kind of deal with lionsgate but candyman would be nice to see as he could have some interesting perks being infested with bees and all.
---
In the Update McLean said Killers won’t be able to interrupt survivors jumping into the hatch
---
Marv would love this
---
Yeah I mean you did your job as a survivor you're wasting the Killers time and on top of that you got his attention. Your teammates are free to do 3 gens for free. And depending how long you ran 5 gens could be done by the time you die.
---
There was a time though where it still required a 4k but after merciless killer was changed to the emblem system. So you could get a ruthless killer with a 4k and still get it, or get a merciless with a 3k and not get it.
---
Bu - but... They told us it was something that we never saw...
---
 Eh Im disapointed yet linda expected it
---
The fact that he even made half of an effort to be decently sportsmanlike after Kate was just teabagging away on the hatch is admirable. What more did you want?
---
really digging the clown and jake
---
It's tied to a hex perk. Cleanse it to remove the perk.
---
Adept on survivor is literally escape whilst you can depip. When even top streamers struggle to double pip with top end perks and characters, I don’t see how you can do it with three throwaway perks on crappy killers.
---
Drake’s wish came true. They cancelled Oprah.
---
Just because I shook my head no in game?
---
Yeah I get it but still don't really understand how rape jokes can turned out to be the worst thing (while, again, they are surely bad). From my perspective genocide/torture jokes look worse than that
---
WITCHCRAFT!
---
I dont even play Legion and i know theyre getting destroyed soon but i NEEEED that outfit.
---
And I depip and have no fun whatsoever? No thanks, idc about winning I care about fun
---
I know ya'll hyped yourself up, but to give BHVR shit for officially announcing something before a process that shouldn't even be done in the first place (leaking them) is wild. 
---
How dare they reveal cosmetics they poured time into before their fans spoil it for themselves by BREAKING into the game files.
---
Wild. I repeat wild.
---
More cosmetics for characters that already have a shit ton of cosmetics. Greatest surprise announcement ever. BHVR never disappoints with the cosmetic microtransactions.
---
SCIENCE!
---
*laughs in Doctor Flair.*
---
So the "surprise" is just them beating dataminers?
---
Don't worry, guys, I'm sure it was just a Surprise PASS, the real surprise will be here next summer!.
---
Damn its a good day to main Legion.
---
*Oh shit I forgot*
---
This happened to me before... While I Was using no mither
---
Don't worry, guys, it was just a Surprise PASS, the real surprise will be here next summer
---
I know I fucked up but I'm still gonna try to bait out a swear word.
---
Hooking and killing is literally how you play the game, you have no idea what the game entails and what really is toxic lemme just pull up the world's smallest violin for you
---
Does Nea really need more skins? I feel sorry for Feng mains. Yikes.
---
Lol the why  fck are you saying that, were you in the match? ARE YOU OKAY?
---
Winning is fun for some people. You dont play video games to lose you play to win.
---
Not really. I agree at the moment the current pip system is far too critical, but seeing how often a killer decides to simply camp the first hook, then NOED, he doesn't deserve anything more than a black pip at the most.
---
&gt;These look great! Not sure why the complaints after we’ve already had a ton of announcements on upcoming things that aren’t cosmetics.
---
Because this is an useless announcement. They just did what the community has been doing every PTB since the cosmetic store went live... showing the upcoming cosmetics and collections that can be found in the files.
---
Yea fuck that if I’m getting tunneled and facecamped I’m gonna leave
---
No more annoyed that people like you actually exist who think everyone needs to have the same opinion as them. And no hunny literally a majority of survivors dislike the map so.......
---
I'm a painter so I love the Jane one, I wish Jeff had gotten instead though :(
---
Thanatophobia meshes well with the perk at least 
---
Nasty and Filthy blade combined should be banned by the geneva convention
---
I might try that map with balanced landing in kill your friends. I think its an alright map, there has to be some problem with it though because my team always gets annihilated on that map.
---
Lmao!!! Guess they don't want dataminers doing it.
---
Technically, we've never seen those cosmetics before...  
---
I guess.
---
Yup. I don't spectate often but just felt the urge to see how the rest of the game went.
---
A+ on speedo Quentin making him beat out buff David and shirtless Myers 😂
---
It's gonna be hunt for the hatch for both the parties, saying survior has no alternative is dumb, if you get to hatch first then it's yours.
---
Hahaha, dude, it does not make someone selfish if YOU give them something because they ask for it. It means you're gullible. And getting angry about it is sillier still.
---
At some point the dead horse gets kicked so much that it's just dog food. We have now reached that point.
---
oh yeah I meant random dcs during the match.. at random too, my friend was doing a gen and got dced for apperantly no reason and I could continue no problem and the other way around it happened after I lost the killer in a chase. but yeah you're right if one dcs before the loading is complete you don't get listed
---
And that's fine by me, as Killer's have the ability to close the hatch. It makes sense and would make the Killer be kinda roided in Hatch Face offs with both Catch potential and Hatch Shutting. I think its a smart idea.
---
Science is myth, Entities hate him, click here to learn his 3 step regiment to survive a trial every time.
---
That Jane outfit is lackluster. Oof
---
Was I right in my assumption that Jane was camping and leading Bub to me with bond? I couldn’t tell for sure, but I’m assuming so lol
---
Small world
---
&gt;I know ya'll hyped yourself up, but to give BHVR shit for officially announcing something before a process that shouldn't even be done in the first place (leaking them) is wild.
---
&gt;How dare they reveal cosmetics they poured time into before their fans spoil it for themselves by BREAKING into the game files.
---
&gt;Wild. I repeat wild.
---
Unlike most games, you don't have to break into anything... The cosmetics are nothing but PNG files within the game directory. Literally any kid can access these.
---
It's actually a new game mode... You get blood points for every bunny Feng lover you make cry by announcing cosmetics on Easter Monday and making sure the surprise is NOT bunnies.
---
I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
What no, did you only read the parts you wanted to read? Pallet looping and window looping are part of the game, as are flashlights, bodyblocking, working together to over come a noed, a basement, or a camper, and I commend survivors that pull it off.
---
The problem is Survivors are super toxic but the devs expect the killer to still play for their enjoyment, they t bag at the end doors, they flick their flashlights at you, dance when they drop a pallet, they send hateful messages in the chat. That's why killing the survivors is the only real victory for a killer.
---
maybe he can get a Sketchartist outfit in the future, or a silly Berret with a pencil in it plus a DIY vest for his metal concerts
---
&gt; I feel sorry for Feng mains
---
Our struggle never ends. But we shall not give up. In the end, we will be victorious.
---
This seems like such a blunder on BHVR's part. There was no reason to hype this up as some big secret surprise. The community already does a good job on its own getting excited about new and upcoming skins as  they get discovered. If anything this is achieving the opposite of their goal. 
---
 Imagine if every birthday your Grandmother gives you a card with $5 in it. For 20 years she always remembers that card and that $5 and you always tell her thank you and give her a call back to see how she's doing.
---
Then one year out of the blue she rings you up a day before your birthday and tells you "This year is going to be special! I've got a big surprise for you!" Suddenly your mind starts to wander. What could it be? You go to the mailbox, find an envelope from Grandma and inside is.....$5. 
---
Now, on a basic level you're still thankful for the thought and generosity that went into her sending you a gift. And you certainly don't think she's a bad person or anything. But in the end you're left scratching  your head wondering "Ok....but why get me wound up like that?"
---
Anyways, have fun with your two struggling brain cells, thank god people like you don't do well in real life. Such a childlike mindset.
---
Not to mention if they get ran around by two good Survivors that there will be SIX Survivors (hopefully) doing gens, which would be extremely fast work compared to even normal gen rushing.
---
Surprise? Being able to put clothing on the Spirit without having to pay would've been a nice surprise. This is just sad and annoying.
---
Uh huh, still gives you literally ZERO reason to spoil them before they can officially announce them.
---
Then get mad when they start doing so because you expect like 2v8 mode, or a new killer, or licensed cosmetics.
---
&gt;Has fox in the same.
---
Expect to be fursecuted.
---
Wrong, worse wraith. Cloak is way better than a non-lethal anime Ninja run. They really need to rename Feral Frenzy to Moderate Jog Stab.
---
They legit revealing this stuff before releasing most of the stuff seen in 2.6.0?
---
So they showed off their own files before people could leak it, and this is bad because...?
---
I'm upset I finally posted something here and I'm getting salt from someone who isn't even in the game. I Mori'd a dude for a Plague Mori ritual and I apologized immediately cause I didn't want to portray it as BM.
---
Will these all be paid?
---
Ebony Mori is very rare as an offering - and Prayer Beads is a bit less, sure. I rarely play killer - I was just playing because I saw a Farmer John video doing a YOINKING video.
---
:(
---
Not even a bunny Feng min...
---
Wtf
---
It is called infinite for a reason, my friend
---
I know i'm gonna buy it but really? They gave us a reskin of Joe right after gutting the legion? Can't wait for Susie with Green hair and a Purple skirt!
---
You are so edgy wow.
---
Boooooooo
---
No bunny Feng min
---
Even if he didn’t tell people to do it he popularized the idea and shouldn’t get an exception.  A ban is a ban.
---
Kate has an outfit with Claud and Jeff upcoming and Jane’s outfit is in this announcement
---
I found this out the hard way the other night when I FINALLY got a 4K as the Hag and got nothing. I was so dissapointed.
---
Just today me and my friend didn't play toxic at all, we did gens, no one had urban evasion nor were we toxic.
---
But because he couldn't manage to hook any one until gates were open (saved em' with BT) we were still called 
---
"Immersed genrushers"
---
Good shit. Added extra effects to FoW &amp; OWtS &amp; added the 2 tokens from a hex cleans to apparition. I feel like apparition picking a random locker makes it less of a get out of jail free card as it COULD land you right next to the killer or on the other side of the map instead of just being able to always go as far away as possible.
---
Except you are an ass about it. Look at you. Here. Posting this. Mr. High-and-Mighty. Free win, not because of skill, but because of a game mechanic where you get to cancel your action. You were compelled by your narcissism to make this post, not out of “tame sportsmanship”.
---
Sorry delmer.  I know it hurts, friend.
---
lmao holy shit you are so mad about this wtf and I cannot wait to cite the majority of killers having a certain opinion to the screams of the subreddit and citing ur comment in an academic fashion
---
The Spirit’s one is kind boring sadly. Too similar to the other kimono.
---
I’d like to have an outfit that includes more of glass shards or something unique and not another kimono.
---
Leave him be he's a child lol
---
So this is it huh? *sigh* it's not like these cosmetics would be datamined or something
---
I've had an increasing amount of people that DC as soon as they're downed. Pretty sad really.
---
No, you play to have fun.
---
Link? I know he was in Farmer John's!
---
XD
---
I don't hate Legion players, hell I don't even really hate playing against Legion. But if you run Frank's mixtape or the disgusting 10 minute mend combo, I'm fuckin outta there
---
Yes we will
---
lemme see if i can get it. i was watching both of them yesterday but im pretty sure he was in montos as well
---
They could reduce Killer speed and BP gains and give the Survivor some sort of buff if two Killers chase them at the same time for too long (like an inverse Bloodlust) so as to stop 2-person tunneling, no cloning Killers while being weird considering there are multiple of each Survivor would prevent bullshit like the nightmare ordeals you suggested, and honestly I can't think of anything for the last point except for perhaps actually making it 2v6 instead of 2v8? But that would take a lot of balancing and messing with gen # and repair speed and the like.
---
DON'T JUDGE MY LIFESTYLE
---
~~But no really it's actually just a dumb twist on Firefox, long story~~
---
No toolbox = 1m20sec
---
I have no idea. By the end we all had a bunch of BP. Survivors were all somewhere around 17-20k. I myself had around 23k bp. Just seemed silly that Entity was disappointed when the game seemed really good and everyone got points.
---
Lol ok
---
tbh, i love BT but i despise most of the players who run it 'cause i know a lot of them rush and unhook the survivor while the killer didn't even finished the hook animation and believe me, the killer won't give a shit that that survivor has BT 'cause s/he'll get tunneled anyway. it was an unnecessary buff in my opinion
---
Looked that way to me. For a second I thought you two were SFW and just trading off Bubba so the other could heal. lol
---
If you mean you can buy some with Shards, maybe. But other than that of course you will have to pay.

---
Hardcore lag wtf thats mental
---
&gt; played the game for more than 300 hours
---
Hey, don't tell people how much time I've wasted on this game. 
---
&gt; breathe of fresh air on this sub
---
Yeah, Reddit is better than Steam forums by a long shot but it's still susceptible to becoming an echo chamber.
---
Streamers suck.
---
And yeah Survivor is easy. You just got to get a good match.
---
Same is true for killer, but it's multiplied by 10
---
There is also one hundred percent a different system in place for counting certain actions after the doors are powered/opened. I can tell you this from experience: some of my daily quest challenges will not give credit if doors are powered. For instance, a daily to get hook saves will not count any saves after the doors are powered/open (not really sure which one it is)
---
That clown outfit is terrifying
---
Just cosmetics
---
i can’t find it. maybe i saw him in Farmer John’s, but either way awesome win on that guy for being in a video!
---
You must be new. Why would you get your hopes up for even a second it was beyond obvious it wouldn't be anything major.
---
Yeah but you forgot the aftermath
---
Not tunneling: 4 guys doing gen, one possibly being chased
---
Tunneling: 3 guys doing gen, one possibly being chased
---
It's bad because BHVR bad. Don't you know the drill by now? /s
---
As much as I don't like it, I can't really agree that rape is less natural than killing is. I don't think that animal always ask permission to begin sexual intercourse, and from what I know in many cases their personal needs are their only concern. For example, male lions can kill lion cubs so the female lion can get fertile sooner, and I've personally seen a lot of street dogs obviously forcing themselves over other dogs.
---
I don't know much on this topic, yet I'm not yet convinced that rape is something that could be called "unnatural" for the sake of the argument. Definitely unethical, but the same could be said about killing too.
---
&gt;I had to respond to your comment because I've commented something similar before and it was not well received. There's a kneejerk visceral reaction to rape, it seems.
---
That's why I reaffirm my personal distaste for rape jokes several times in these messages.
---
Missing Adam in this collage
---
Yeee
---
For starters, I have 1008 hours.
---
Secondly, they announced that the secret was "Something we haven't seen before". Yet we've obviously seen cosmetics before. Most people have already gagged that this is the first time DBD has beaten data miners to revealing cosmetics.
---
But I had every right to get my hopes up. Considering the recent announcement of the Endgame Collapse. There WAS potential for something else great. Don't act like YOU didn't expect anything else.
---
David.. 🤤
---
I'll be buying that Nea and Clown outfits, I think they look sweet.
---
Mechanic David Head + Shirtless David Body = **UwU Daddy**
---
The Legion outfit looks awesome.
---
So what you're saying is, you're angry over a game mechanic, one which is hard to time without smacking the survivor, one I am excited I managed to actual time it right by using a small bit of mind game, and me posting my achievement to a reddit who enjoys interesting clips of killer v survivor interaction is a basis that I'm a narcissistic person? Whereas I've been nothing but calm and collected while you rant and directly insult me? 
---
Are you ok? Such anger and tenacity isn't good of anyone. I'm simply here to play a game and enjoy it, while sharing something I did with other people who may or may not relate. Your comment is being downvoted because people don't agree with what you're saying. Its obvious a minority on this post, as you're the only person getting upset about it. I've been rather calm and placate about it. I'm not shouting "LOOKIE HERE GUYS, LOL STUPID SURVIVOR GET WRECKED NOOB" or otherwise "being an ass" about anything. Its literally a Bob Ross quote over a small hatch mind game. It isn't getting this upset about.

Saaammmeee. Just wondering if that's Frank or Joey

And if I recall, the Gates auto open on Hatch being shut as well, so there's that.

ive had that same error on my ps4, but i only wait for a bit and done
---
Richtofen is that you?
---
Sounds like you are kind of new to this game then. As someone who actually plays both sides let me tell you this : as a killer, you either get tbagged if you lose or bitched at if you win. Best not bother with suvivor's feelings at all. The fact that you think you need to apologize for doing a mori daily speaks volume to that
---
Pick them all up after rank reset

Yeah the clothes make me think frank but thats definitely joeys knife

---
He could just sent the details to the devs, no reason to make the video and post it here, its the ONLY reason this bug became popular was because of his video. He found the bug and probably earned some cash (from the views) and also many subs.
---
Ikr. She got so many cool outfits but no cute heads.
---
Trapper and Wraith. I had no addons and only level 1 Agitation on my Trapper and after one match on Lery's trying to get my Rite of the Jaws done, I had like 7 traps under my belt thanks to some 200+ IQ placements and 4 sacrifices with 1 gen left against what I'm P sure was at least 2 people on comms, a Laurie and a bloody Claudette. Wraith is usually overlooked aside from jumpscare factor since he usually bing bongs right behind you, but honestly ever since he got the small speed boost coming out of invisibility, he's been so much better and is actually really effective, I only have him at level 7 but I can get at least 3 kills with him most of the time if not 4 if I play especially well or get lucky. Can't speak for the DLC Killers aside from limited exposure with Splinter offerings.
---
Larry the Loving Llama is the only correct choice.
---
Jane is brand new and Kate/Feng have a ton of cosmetics.
---
Meg and Nea have a bunch of outfits but they're all trash, and Claud honestly doesn't have that much.
---
You want underrepresented look at Adam. He literally has two outfits that aren't a reskin.
---
I feel like this isn’t it. At least, not all of it. BHVR said it’s something we haven’t seen yet, and some of the Fog Whisperers were definitely saying it was something special. Plus BHVR seems to be deliberately not responding to any comments asking if these cosmetics are the surprise. Not trying to get anyone’s hopes up but hey, we could all use a little hope.
---
If you help spreading a glitch you should get punished for it, that easy.
---
A lot of the time people go overboard and expect killers to ignore the hook altogether.
---
But really id say if you never commit to leaving the hook and always hover nearby to return to it your camping.
---
Us Feng mains are crying in a corner right now
---
The more you know!

&gt;Escaped +200

Wait really?

What happened to the picture?

Finally some good news
---
The mask also looks similar to Joey's too.

Simple. Don't be near it to begin with. The basement is supposed to be a death sentence if you're caught there.
---
Who should have got some?
---
lol
---
During revision for exams 🙃
---
I got to admit, this is me as killer too, but replace the fuck you with a thank you
---
NO!!!!!, this would promote camping, tunneling, and NOED. Killer pips should be based on hits and chases so that killers benefit from safe hook rescues and want the game lasting longer.
---
Yeah... It got confirmed a while ago
---
Real talk. David looks like someone from a typical Mechanic/Sexy woman porno
---
Not defending the behavior but often times as hag, when you set the trap to disable a loop the survivor will head to the next pallet and the cycle continues.
---
Woah that spirit one is so cool, loving the neon outfits too! Great cosmetics this patch!
---
Did you have a stroke
---
okay, but why does David look like Tom from The Great Gatsby.
---
I don't get what you mean. Chasing 1 dude specifically leaves everyone on gens for a long time. Even if you kill 1 survivor in 2 gens, 3 survivors with 3 gens left is very easy for survivors to win with if you're the type of killer who resorts to tunnelling.
---
Idk, I don't tunnel, and I can get like 10 minute games giving each survivor 3 hook states, chases, 4k before 3rd gen popped, and everyone leaving with 20k+ points near guaranteed.
---
Right when I graduate and start looking for a job too 😍
---
It’s a both for me. Can’t play without em both.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bg5kyq/bloodhunt_starts_early_may/?st=juspbyzp&amp;sh=c2e17da2
---
Man you get results
---
No. As a survivor main, the basement is supposed to be a death sentence. Just don't be near it.
---
Ughhh BHVR I’m still mad at you for the Legion changes, why are the cosmetics so good, I want almost all of these
---
Yeah, well. Let me be excited, alright?
---
Early May huh? Just in time for when I'm on vacation and I'm not home.
---
Nothing is going to work out for me today, huh?
---
But you can do stuff after you've secured the gens
---
I mean im happy enough. Cosmetics look cool. Theres been plenty of content drops lately
---
Yea but at least he could down people with it, now it’s just a 10 second time waster that is impossible to go down with and a slightly faster than move speed first hit.
---
I’d say that’s fair. I guess I’ll try to wander further out next time.
---
Sis you trying to use a larger vocabulary of words to sounds smart is a tragedy. At the end of the day do I care that you think its playing victim to dislike a map? No. Do I care there are other idiots out there with the same mindset as you ? Yeah I find that pretty annoying. Quote me all you want, everyone can have an opinion, if a killer feels a certain way about something they are entitled to, whether or not I think it's incorrect, it's called a fucking opinion. And tbh killer should have a lot to say about the game in it's current state, its horrendous to play killer near rank 1.
---
It's been known for a fair amount of time
---
Well at least you load in. Seems like anytime I burn a escape cake or streamers I get the infinite loading screen. They are a curse.
---
we know /u/spoksy
---
The clown outfit is dope !
---
I cant stop laughing at this. Im fuckin dead.
---
I work at Wal-Mart for a living. I have rather thick skin as is, from being called a lot of different names from different people. I've learned that anger soon fades in waves of calm and noncanterly talking. I main killer as my hands are too shaky for skill checks, and overall I love the idea of being a horror movie villain of sorts. I'm not new to the game, by all means I've been told to kill myself several times whenever I play my main man Doctor. But I've also learned conversation can out last anger, that you never know what the other person may or may not be going through. I don't know what his life is like outside of the game or Reddit, so where am I to judge his anger as legit saltiness or something else affecting him.
---
I also have my personal but simple philosophy as a killer main: Its my job to kill. It isn't my job to play by imaginary rules made by the other team, nor apply myself to them. Albeit I don't facecamp, BM, Legion Break, etc as I don't find those as fun playstyles. I main Doctor because he's a unique killer who's mechanics are overall interesting and the idea of Madness applied in a PVP setting is genius. I like the chase, mind games, etc. But in the end, when it comes to the hatch, I decide what to do with it. 80% of the time it goes to a survivor, where be it they played good, they got out of luck with bad DCs, or just I can see they are learning the game somewhat/its a younger person playing it. Its my job to kill, but in that it also entails mercy. I want people to have fun on both sides of the coin, both killer and survivor.
---
But yeah, this whole "Surprise" was a waste of hype.
---
Now when they ORIGINALLY announced cosmetics back before the official Clown DLC dropped. THAT was a surprise. Imagine if every time some cosmetics were released. The developers held like a big fancy party at some warehouse and had Old Man Jenkins in a suit walk up to the stand with an intense drumroll and he pull out and envelop, clearing his throat and speaking with passion.. That they are revealing just simple store cosmetics.
---
quick meme. 
---
i like it.
---
Some people will get upset no matter what you do. You can play fair, not go back to your hooks immediately after, let them heal up and they'll still call you a tunneling camper when you eventually kill them.
---
Its not like suvivors have anything against it, but i know what you mean, so how about pipping with kills  just "a little bit"
---
Why wouldn't you hover like in a 30-50 meter radius of the hook? It's smart, and a non issue. If you bring them to a good hook you can defend multiple generators while staying in that radius.
---
Killers shouldn't be expected to just ignore the person they put on the hook and I've NEVER understood that mentality
---
The Wrapple
---
Could be a number of things like you not actually slowing down just someone running "Hope", lag makes it seem that way, or hacker.
---
Feng has tons of cosmetics.
---
Kate too at least as many as adam and david.
---
Jeff and plague are new almost brand new.
---
I could get if it was claud and meg or dwight again but all these guys dont have many cosmetics even jake has the least of the og survivors
---
NICE !!! Thank you !
---
what about the other datamined cosmetics from the chapter 12 ptb smh
---
Roughly everything in Fortnite is stolen so.... wouldn’t be surprised.
---
That game lost its originality the second it jumped on the battle royale bandwagon.
---
Is he suppose to be a obese deformed  pinocchio?
---
3rd source. 
---
Bloodhunt is confirmed for early May.
---
Not really, compared to Meg, Dwight, Nea, etc, they all have about 10 less cosmetics than them.
---
Me when I Dwight or Feng Min and I see killer after completing gen
---
Hmm... Looks like a 10. Oh wait, I had it pointed in your direction.
---
Uhh... [no they don't](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1120388950412148736?s=19).
---
Urban Evasion x4: 1.13m/s\*5=5.65m/s
---
Myers T3:  4.6m/s\*4\*noed=4.6m/s\*1.16=5.336m/s
---
Urban Racecar actually wins this
---
God can you ladies name names already
---
OK but which member of Legion is wearing Hi-vis?
---
It's a very disappointing surprise for sure but for the Devs it's a good thing because they get to reveal them before they put them into the game files and the community reveals them.
---
It's Joey's body outfit as well from the shape of it
---
I think davids meant to look like a poiroit or some explorer.
---
Outside of hatch, a hooked survivor cannot objectively be better than a dead survivor. Survivors can accomplish exactly the same thing with 1 dead as they can by leaving 1 to die on the hook.
---
Reminds me of when it was Double BP weekend and Legion was new so i wanted to test Franks + Cold Dirt (the general consensus of Legion was weak af) and I burned a Pudding and they burned 3 streamers. *NOT A SINGLE BOTHER WAS GIVEN*
---
I think up you added an extra word 🤔
---
The only change to heartbeat was how loud it is when the killer is above or below you. So on maps like the game if the killers is on the floor above you and stand right on top of where you are the heartbeat will be much more quite.
---
I had a Hag match sometime last week where I had 2 dead and 1 gen left so I was just going around trying to find a sign of someone on a gen or totem or anything and activity had pretty much ceased. I eventually spotted Nea crouching in a corner (it was by a window and I laughed to myself because I set a trap there and I was like "this is such a big brain spot someone will for sure set it off" but she was crouched riiight on top of it) and I hit her and chased her and she stopped to open up a locker and fuckin Adam was hiding in there and I lost it. It was beautiful.
---
Great now I need to find that video.
---
I like running both sometimes so you are ready for either situation, killer isnt near heal them, killer tunnels well at least they have BT.
---
Perfect fix !
---
Really? Billy is so easy for me and nurse is just impossible.
---
No he's not weak, but he's not great and does need a rework.
---
Right now, a Freddy's success depends heavily on keeping multiple Survivors asleep at any given point in time. Games as Freddy should be played more like Doctor games than Wraith games; it's more about wasting Survivors time while you whittle them and their defenses down. He can be strong when played with skill and strategy because he is one of the only Killers in the game whose powers are a built in stall mechanic. 
---
I'll explain in-depth:
---
\- Once a Survivor is asleep they can only Wake Up if they are injured, find an Awake Survivor, or find an unrepaired generator. When they Wake Up by failing a Skillcheck, they notify you and reduce their progress. Running Overcharge on Freddy can actually be very powerful if you use it correctly because most Survivors will fail it without thinking about the bonus regression it inflicts. As long as you keep putting Survivors to sleep without injuring them you can keep making them fail skillchecks on Generators and slow themselves down.
---
\- Chases as Freddy should be more about quickly breaking pallets or downing Survivors than anything else. If someone is looping you well LEAVE THEM. Freddy suffers the most out of any of the Killers for focusing on chasing a single Survivor. You should also never injure someone unless they don't have Self-Care (almost all Survivors without Self-Care run Medkits and vice versa, but you can also injure a Survivor and wait to see if they Self-Heal or run to a Generator to tell) or you are planning to down them. 
---
\- Survivors without Self-Care are your best friend; always injure them without downing them unless they're the last one left. They'll be forced to head to a generator or another Survivor. Heading to a generator will let you get the drop on them for a quick down. Heading to another Survivor will let you find another person to put to sleep and increase your stall (chase after the Wake Upper not the Survivor without Self-Care, as the Wake Upper will probably be fully Healed and be able to focus on the objective after Waking Up while the injured Survivor without Self-Care will either want to heal after Waking Up or leave themselves at risk while they focus on an objective).
---
\- Like Doctor, Freddy can often sneak up on Survivors who are busy/don't expect him. If you further reduce Freddy's already small Terror Radius with M&amp;A or Red Paintbrush, you can sneak up on Asleep Survivors after 'breaking chase' or chasing them off a generator. This doesn't work against SWF, but it can be very powerful against solo Survivors who don't know what their teammates are doing.
---
\- Again, like Doctor, the less generators there are, the better for you. 3 gen strats are godly on Freddy. As long as you don't injure Survivors they can only Wake Up by finding someone else or failing a Generator. If you get a 3-gen you can force the Survivors to stay asleep and do nothing or run to you. Again, this is more effective against solo than SWF, but even SWF can fall victim to this strategy if you play your cards right.
---
All that said, the Freddy does desperately need a rework because his stall is unreliable and the dream state can heavily screw him over rather than help him.
---
I shalt 'splain in-depth againe:
---
\- Skillchecks are unreliable, even while using some of Freddy's add-ons there is no way to determine when a Survivor will be able to miss a skillcheck and Wake Up. Sometimes a Survivor can fail a check in the time it takes you to break a pallet. Sometimes they can heal themselves to full with Self-Care through Sloppy Butcher and never get a skillcheck. It's the same reason almost nobody runs Autodidact; skillchecks are unreliable. This can ruin both Survivor and Killer experiences with Freddy.
---
\- 7 seconds. I don't need to say anymore, but there is PLENTY more. Unbreakable, Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Instaheals from Awake Survivors onto Downed Survivors, the fact that during the Dream Transition Survivors are able to Unhook someone/finish a Generator/Cleanse a Totem/Heal a Downed Survivor/Heal themself/Open a Gate/Use the Hatch/WAKE UP ANOTHER SURVIVOR ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? This is easily the most egregious thing. Freddy shouldn't be penalized for having a power unless it's **very** strong (and it's not).
---
**TL**;**DR** \- Freddy slows the game down more than a little bit if you play him right. He's not trash, but he does need a rework because his power can hinder him in annoying ways.
---
90 at tier 3 iirc
---
Oooh Clown and Jane's new cosmetics yesssss
---
On Twitter one of the devs said yesterday that they’re working with lionsgate films. They own Halloween Scream Saw etc. So it could be licensed cosmetics or maybe ghostface DLC?
---
It is how?
---
That’s what they get for not letting others in on the secret so we could have fun too :(
---
BT doesn't always provide that save though, as much as I love it (Getting that spicy play is golden.) I've had so many killers just tunnel them to hell and back...
---
wut
---
No, trust me, I understand completely. Survivors are fuckin' awful and their behavior is what scares me away from playing killer anymore and makes my teeth grind when I have their insensitive/dumb asses on my side. But the fact of the matter is, like I said, 4k is a sign you completely smashed them into the ground and not the expectation. The devs themselves have said it. If you go in expecting to 4k every game, you're gonna be miserable.
---
Then again, with how players act, you're gonna be miserable either way. God this game is toxic
---
inb4 devs actually make "power hits" give MoM stacks for consistency. For a team that seems to communicate a lot of the community, they are quite out of touch in some cases. 
---
Remember when people complained that Nurse's Calling could see people Snapping Out of It but not Mending? What did they do? Remove the ability to see people Snapping Out of It. 
---
You can also list Rancor as a shitty perk that has no counter for the Obsession which is also stupid.
---
Thought that was a piece of bacon before looking closer.
---
It would be okay as a last chance perk. Say your on deathhook and next hit that would down you get a mettle of man hit and dont go down, no matter if its m1 or m2.  But it causes permenant broken state and aura reveal. Its literally there to save you and thats it
---
Massive disappointment.
---
The game's in shambles but here are more cosmetics! More fodder for the cattle to feed on..
---
Why does Nea have such a flat ass :'(
---
This is super common. My advice: play the game however you want. You'll receive hatemail no matter what you do. So best to just ignore them and keep having fun
---
Did they say there was going to be an announcement?
---
Where? I missed it
---
Generally BHVR calls it an exploit if you are knowingly taking advantage of a bugged addon, like in their statement on the legion mending bug. I guess if you don't realize that the addon is bugged then it isn't really exploiting. Still, I wish they would do something to fix it.
---
Meg and dwight havmt got any cosmetics here. Nea got one but every other character doesnt have that many
---
Its based on medieval jester costumes kinda like Rigeletto.
---
Will you fix the DC epidemic until then? The loading screen crashes? 
---
No?
---
Such a childish assessment. 
---
1. I called you on your bullshit, that being your declaration of “tame sportsmanship”. You’re a narcissist. Plain and simple. 
---
2. Oh wow! I got downvoted on a thread that Killer mains are more likely to enjoy and partake in discussion on.  I said something killers don’t like, I wonder what will happen?! Oh no! My poor karma!
---
3. I stated that I’m glad you won’t be able to use such a cheap tactic for a win anymore, and how the use of such a tactic is hardly worthy of a video post. You held button down and let go and got to grab a Survivor because of it, you didn’t use any skill. Hardly worth a “look at me, I’m mindgaming!” Post. 
---
4. Anyone who asks “are you okay” mid discussion is being dishonest, and you knew that when you said it. So don’t act like some innocent party. It’s snarky at best. You made a snipe at my screen name too instead of an actual response to a previous statement, so you haven’t exactly been “calm and collected”.
---
Lot of good cosmetics in this one, new late-game mechanics. Looks like it's going to be a quality mid-patch. Also, the Puppet Clown is **AAAAAAAAAAAAA**
---
But it does add a little extra time(sometimes a lot if the survivor is good enough)
---
Damn, nearly half of all those people DC'd. Have an upvote for the hard work.
---
Camping
---
Softly patrolling my shattered charge in order to secure my task, my challenge, my goal, before preparing the hunt for their fellows and typing gg ez in the communications channel in the aftermath of the playdown.
---
They really wouldn't have to add it to all maps or any others.  Dbd is really creative though and always adds new mechanics. The biggest issue would none all the maps have map specific mechanics. It would seem strange to suddenly throw them in and i dont think it would happen quickly if they did want to change other maps.
---
Lemme tell you about being bullied.
---
I took a loooooong break from this game of being a survivor main and picked it back up along with a few dlcs to play killer. I'm only rank 18 killer after playing Micheal religiously and played 1 game as bubba for a daily. 
---
That one game was actual cancer with 2/4 survivors having purple flashlights and t bagging every pallet and taking 5 mins of standing at the gates to finally end the match. I don't understand how stuff like that seems fun for them
---
Probably not. Like I said above odds are much more likely they are just trying to be offensive and upset people, and it's working
---
🤦🏻‍♀️ dude im not gonna argue with you. you can check in the store of the amount of cosmetics each character has. just stop.
---
Oh did you mean *literally* only do gens then leave? Surely there's a chase or two in there, maybe a hook.
---
I feel like nea and spirit didnt need new skins. You can tell which characters are BHVRs favorites. I even felt like Jane could've waited a while because they already made her a lot of skins on her release. nice skins tho
---
you're a fucking dumbass, toy. first of all, moving at super speed is NOT just fucking lag. and TWO, unlike YOU, mister perfect lifeform of which we should ALL obviously fucking worship, us humans make mistakes. i don't even fucking know if it was a mistake or if you're just bullshitting.
---
Wait I actually got a Hex: Devour Soap in my last game :O
---
Also "You know i had to do it em"
---
Someone please use this image for both of those memes plz
---
Is that a good or a bad thing? I may be a Doctor Main but my medical liscence is imaginary at best.
---
Streamers spend the most time playing out of anyone, and are literally God’s when they try.
---
That doesn’t make sense. “Survivor is easy (except when it’s not), and killer is always easy (except when it’s also not, and it’s not ten times as much)”
---
4 sprint bursts was a literal blast. And so was chainsaw on other killers.
---
Guess you'll just have to enjoy the DCs.
---
I think its fine where it is now but I do see where you're coming from. It being tied to terror radius is part of its counter play though
---
Well you guys did get that super dope Moonrise skin.
---
Now we just wait and see whether it's the first or the second weekend ;)
---
This idea seems alright, but I wouldn't bet money on it. Maybe the killer just being faster is enough and may not as fast and his power minimized.
---
Streamers USUALLY suck.
---
And DBD is a game of skill, and luck.
---
If you aren't that skilled, you have to hope you have enough luck.
---
If you have enough luck, you won't need as much skill.
---
Remember, if you are good ENOUGH, you will ALWAYS win, but you have to be good enough.
---
Sometimes, you aren't.
---
No, it allows some amount of counterplay to BT and gives a use for Insidious, which is basically worthless for other than a meme build in today’s meta. 
---
Camping is usually a bad strategy, but can be helpful on altruistic SWF teams that don’t understand they can knock out 2-3 gens and still save a person who is being camped. 
---
IMO, they should only remove the terror radius requirement if they change Insidious completely as a formal way of not encouraging camping. If you have a camping perk, camping is a valid, approved, and encouraged strategy.
---
Stopping the survivor like that isn’t a good mechanic in a game like this one. Why run if the killers naturally walk faster than you? Especially if the killer can stun you
---
&gt; BHVR said it’s something we haven’t seen yet, and some of the Fog Whisperers were definitely saying it was something special.
---
Where did you hear this? I'm curious now...
---
I just started playing this game literally two days ago and that shit is enough to make me reconsider.  
---
He will find me in my nightmares, for sure.
---
If they cost shards I’ll be sorta ok with it. If it cost cells I’ll be disappointed that was the supised
---
if that was the case i would just face camp and run perks to ensure i get 2 people every game
---
Are you facing Myers?
---
Are you facing someone with Distressing, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Dark Devotion, Tinkerer, or Insidious?
---
Is it a Hag using Grandma's Heart?
---
I have not run into any issues with the terror radius and you more than likely ran into an addon or perk that alters the terror radius.
---
OP being me or the original poster of the comment? I try my best to be nice and patient, but I know word things in a pompous or snarky matter that I don't want to come across as.
---
Welp we can say goodbye to noob again. Or maybe not. We’ll have to see if their ban spree is back.
---
What about bug fixes
---
Okay
---
Git gud son
---
Are you forgetting the Sweaters?
---
i get called a monster every time
---
The dog  LOL
---
&gt; his power would be throwing Dry Ice to slow down or freeze survivors
---
This is not as good Clown
---
More cosmetics that will make you spend money! "Surprise"?... The clown one looks dope though.
---
God damn it bronze chaser again, nevermind.
---
He wants pictures of Spider-Man on his desk by tomorrow morning.
---
2 kills shouldn't give you a pip.
---
close enough
---
Nope. Its every killer i face and they dont have those perks. I think the music is just obnoxiously loud now
---
Yeah I get mad when potato survivors throw the pallet down in a chase too early and don’t stun me. I’m playing her to hear the cute stun noises please stun me!
---
Yes
---
Y e s
---
yeah I see no reason why it needs it. Borrowed Time isn't that strong unless the gates are open anyway
---
Buying the legion skin because I own them all. I had to stop playing them due to salt and I’m not probably not going back to him because he’s gonna be useless. 
---
But I’m still going to buy it lol.
---
Ya I get the knocking out gens. If I know he is camping and I dont have borrowed I dont even try. 90 percent of the time either they will just tunnel the unhooked guy or the one going for the u hook will just trade and the team isnt in a better situation. I was more thinking of endgame.  Or situation where there is only a few gens left and you know the other 2 are on them so I will try to go for unhook ti help the poor camped survivor out. It just kinda sucks when there is no counter play to camping, coming from the hooked survivors perspective. I know you can gen rush, but the hooked guy has no counter available for it
---
I was about to post this before your reply, but you beat me to it:
---
"I don't know what his life is like outside of the game or Reddit, so where am I to judge his anger as legit saltiness or something else affecting him."
---
I'll admit, it does take a decent person to say something like that. Especially on this forum, and especially with gamers.
---
We're not going to agree on game mechanics, that much is clear. 
---
I will however, concede that this time, I am the asshole. I will leave this thread, and you, alone. 
---
Addition after your reply: 
---
As salty as I can be, I have a firm belief that saying 'kys' at the end of any game should result in a permanent ban, and therefore is something I've never aid to anyone.
---
Happy Gaming.
---
The only time i had the pleasure of using Devour Hope in it's full potential, was with Hag and i had Thrill of the Hunt. I had to spank a Nea three times off my totems.
---
[Discord,](http://discord.gg/aBz4aC7) you can make suggestions for future memes, by the way. ;D
---
[Album of templates,](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols) like, a lot of templates. True memeage is here.
---
Most of the maps kinda blow tbh.
---
* I'm ok with seeing Autohaven maps except Wretched Shop, because if both the shitty windows are open then you're gonna need bloodlust 3 to deal with the loop (it's literally an infinite against huntress because she can't maintain chase long enough to get bloodlust). Grim Pantry can have the same thing, Asylum Disturbed Ward sucks for the same reason, Campbell's is a solid map, Pale Rose is alright.
---
* MacMillan maps are alright. Suffo pit has some notoriously dumb RNG where one half of the map gets all the pallets. Storehouse can be dumb sometimes, Ironworks window is dumb.
---
* Some of the Coldwind maps can spawn with really fucked up loops and the see-through walls are unmindgameable. Torment Creek is abhorrent.
---
* Haddonfield and Lery's both can have really fucked up vaults, Preschool has two guaranteed fucked up landmarks.
---
* The Game randomly has massive droughts for survivors, if you don't THOROUGHLY look around before you commit to a location there's a good chance you just run into a room that has absolutely nothing to help you and die on the spot.
---
* Both Red Forest maps and Yamaoka estate are disgustingly large. Killers without a map control power (especially Huntress) are fucked here.
---
* Ormond hasn't been gross the last few times I've played on it, but the map on just a simple playability standpoint is ass. Auras are nearly invisible + the map seems unoptimized, to the point where I have FPS drops and can't hit great skill checks. Amazed that the map made it to live in that condition.
---
It happened to me today, it was taking a really long time to find a match as a survivor and then switched to killer.
---
To my surprise it took 2-3 min to find a swf i believe, with ranks going from 2 to 15. It wasnt like that yesterday
---
You also find it when installing the sky pack?
---
Did you forget with every perk, it takes up a perk slot which is one risk already? Another risk is its inconsistency, bringing in MoM doesn't guarentee its use. MoM can be powerful in the right hands, but just like old ds, it's a chase extender if anything
---
uninstalling actually lol
---
maybe dont have impossible-to-win situations for killer then
---
oh u managed to down a survivor? too bad u just instantly lost a gen to 3 toolbox premade players
---
Therapist: Dog Nea isn't real and she can't hurt you.
---
[Dog Nea:](https://i.imgur.com/Jgy9gMm.jpg)
---
yeah but i think the problem with deep wound is that if someone is already injured and gets hit with deep wound he doesnt go down and the survivors can just stay injured and makes the deep wound useless i feel like he should just do one health state because i think its kinda silly that they dont go down
---
Higher ranks does usually refer to rank 1, obviously it's a bit counterintuitive but there it is lol. Also, yes Doctor can run certain addons like [Iridescent King ](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iridescent_King) to make already used pallets appear to be usable again. Which sometimes results in survivors running to a loop that doesn't have a pallet at all
---
You know, with so many folk arguing for killing everyone and without mercy, people like you are blessed. The few funny killers that I've met have definitely made the game much more enjoyable for me. Good luck in the fog. :)
---
If they wanted to copy from dbd then the dying light costume would be designed after a trash can
---
I didn't forget, she took up too much space.
---
I am sure there is something you are missing, honestly. 
---
Don't suppose you care to record and upload an example?
---
Ah I thought I saw that
---
The problem with Claudette cosmetics is that they're all either plain ugly, or make you stand out like a lit christmas tree in the void of space, sometimes even both.
---
I'm sure if they gave a cosmetic that made her look stylish, yet not visible from the opposite end of the map (à la Cyber Punk Nea, or Winter Wilderness Kate) people wouldn't mind spending 10 dollars on her.
---
"Hey entity, this dude is like infinitely better than these survs, he 4k in a literal minute, what should we do?"
---
"Make that bitch derank so he'll face worse survs lmao" -Mcote, probably.
---
You'd think, but the only time it actually is is when the survivors are 4 non-goobers. It only takes one goober to totally whoosh on the fact that you're a spirit with no known totem effects and cleanse anyway.
---
He got left in the woods to die by his coworkers. I could understand why he would be.
---
There is absolutely counter-play. 
---
Use the rotating hooks. You can unhook from the side and bodyblock with the unhooked person. The unhooked person has immunity until they can move, so they can take hits without going down. You have to bait the hit from the killer. 
---
A fully healed survivor can go in for an unhook and get downed but rescue the hooked person, while a second person prepares for a flashlight save. 
---
You can bait a killer away from the hook by walking up to them with sprint burst or other exhaustion perks. While someone approached from another angle. You can escape with the hit cooldown and the exhaustion perk. 
---
You can try to bait by jumping back and forth from a pallet or window next to the killer. 
---
Remember that a killer can only see directly in front of them. Someone can approach from behind if you distract the attention.
---
Aight
---
But she also only kills BECAUSE it will cure her home of the plague. She gains little pleasure of it, I'm sure.
---
this encourages camping y would i not i want to secure my safety pip and swf lobby would be a huge problem most of the time on top of that i feel like it would be worse than the system they have now and there would be a huge disparity between ranks i could easily get to red ranks with a swf team but wtf does the killer get to combat that you would have a bunch of red rank survivors and no red rank killers
---
He learned his lesson, pesky Jake!
---
That is what I am saying, yes. MoM would be a problem if survivors had the tools they had before. MoM is just one of the few decent perks out of tons of pretty minor perks that finally might shake up the meta a little. With every good thing a survivor gets, there's always killers who are gonna complain about it. MoM is very much manageable for a decent killer
---
Implying Freddy is wholesome
---
Fuuuck I'm a sucker for David. Can't believe I'm actually gonna buy the mechanic face at least. It will go well with the shirtless body I bet ;)
---
Dirty hook rushers. Do the gens for crying out loud.
---
*looks at flair* the worst of them all
---
Why does everyone hate Nea's neon hairs? I'm just genuinely curious? Is it a ''I need to be immersed and be unseen the entire time."  sort of thing? 
---
Or is it just preference? Because personally her latest head pieces hae made her much more prettier IMO where as much of her older pre-cosmetic store ones make her look like a hobo who hasn't eaten anything in a month and is close to dying.
---
"Ultra Rare" as in you get like 3 per bloodweb whilst BPS seem to all be in valhalla or smth.
---
I mean, technically speaking, generators aren't your only objective in the emblem system. You'll never pip if you only do gens and never get chased, save ppl etc. But I agree, "gen rushing" doesn't exist, only killers who are bad at stopping generator progress
---
Don't coddle him.  He wants to be a content creator,  he needs to be held to a higher standard otherwise we'll have another Ochido on our hands (minus hitting on 14 year olds).
---
I tried to fit the elements about the game into the actual playable area of the stage rather than the background, which is what I did with the Killer Shack and a hill tile. The resource limit was almost at the segment only allowing 4 players and I didn't want that limitation because the number of players in a DBD lobby is 5 (yeah I'm like that). I would add your pallet idea but you can't update current uploads or delete old ones so right now I'd rather not fill up the online with a bunch of MacMillans because of good ideas after the fact.
---
Let’s use the counters OP listed: 
---
1. Play a select few killers. 
---
2. Bring in an offering that completely ruins someone’s game
---
3. Use the expose effect, aka play Myers or run noed
---
4. Get a grab that relies entirely on survivors playing awful 
---
5. Camp
---
If you can’t see a problem with this, you don’t understand Killer.
---
Sorry I'm having trouble explaining this without sounding like a prick.
---
Being able to instantly down is good but you need to look at the conditions the shape has to be in tear 3, for bubba you need to be touching the survivors back and faraway from pallets winds and you still may hit a wall, for Billy you need to be faraway from winds and pallets and not get juke by the survivor. 
---
Is it clear why bubba is one of the worst killers and why I think Billy is balanced. 
---
( I hope I didn't sound to rude )
---
Rancor doesn't have much of a counter, but it also gives the obsession ample warning.
---
If the killer is running Rancor and was already on you when the last gen got powered, yeah you're just kinda boned and that sucks.
---
On the other hand, Rancor at least makes absolutely sure you know of its existence before it comes into play, so you know you need to be fully immersed during the endgame from the time the first gen is completed (unless it's Freddy with Rancor... hey that sounds pretty fun I think I'll try that).
---
I don't even think about unhooking till I see another survivor injured at the start.
---
Okay uh....cool. just don't be salty when people complain like people do with MoM, and you can go ahead and play with whatever works. But let's be realistic: youre playing nurse. You're one of 1 the killers who won't have a problem with MoM
---
rank means nothing atm so i wouldnt worry bout it to much but yes if ranks did matter its bullshit i hope they do somthing about the dc problem that plagues the game
---
The blue is really nice.
---
:)
---
Which is bullshit because if another fucking survivor leaves they don't depip but I have to fucking depip cause a killer couldn't handle us getting rid or ruin?
---
The only Claudette cosmetic I think that's been truly hideous are her skirts and that one Japanese inspired look that came with Spirit. 
---
But opinions are subjective I suppose.
---
Also Winter Wilderness Kate is the brightest motherfucking thing in the world. You can see that blue ass puff jacket from twelve light years away.
---
~~Balanced Landing on~~ that map is amazing (if you're a survivor)
---
Oh shit that's right, this was also back when Sprint Burst was the 40 second cooldown, no exhaustion, charged while running, etc.
---
I'm curious on how it'd work now with exhaustion and if you could use it 4 times anyways, I wonder what would happen if you stacked 4 Dead Hards, would you be able to dash 4 times or only 1 time?
---
I can agree with this. It's certainly annoying, but other than being a minor inconvenience, it truly hasn't totally destroyed any of my games thus far (except maybe for one exception where they MoM user happened to get away because they played in a way that I actually wasn't aware they had it, so good on them).
---
I say if they were to remove the aforementioned addons and did something about tunneling and camping there would be less disconnects. The hitboxes aren’t helping with them being the size of the map. If I go play survivor and get hit like 3 metres away from the killer why would i want to continue the match.
---
Holy shit
---
I think it’s early May
---
"low tier doesn't equal shit" no you're right, it just equals extremely bad (some people might even go so far as to call it shitty)
---
&gt; Feng is straight up the only female survivor who hasn't had some sort of ''Collection" dedicated to her since the store released.
---
So I suppose the three Sci-Fi Fan outfits don't exist then.
---
hey! at least Meg and I had a reason! 😔
---
Yeah sure let's buff Borrowed Time some more, nevermind that it's being buffed again due to Legion's deep wound changes.
---
1 they are beating the data miners.
---
2 this is a LOT more cosmetics than the "$5" worth we usually get.
---
3 some of these are really surprising. Clown especially.
---
That's not even possible any more lol
---
It's an outfit based on a type of stock character from the commedia dell'arte type of Italian theater and puppetry.
---
You say that but the cloak is abysmal at actually cloaking him, I see a cloaked wraith across the map even on Coldwind, tho I'll give it to you that it's alright on Game/Lerys where LoS isn't very open. 
---
I'll still take freebie injured state and the pressure that applies over a mild speed boost and 'invisibility' that will spook a freshly installed Dwight every few games.
---
Considering this game is played by people who hate their lives and love the concept of either killing people or getting killed... it makes sense that a lot of players act this way tbh
---
I heard that a lot of rank 20 killers and survivors have a hard time finding lobbies. This problem is actually old so I dunno since my rank as a killer right now is 8 or something. 
---
Im not complaining about rank disparity, since is better than just waiting 5-7 min  and I've alredy been rank 1 killer last season.  Just find odd the time to fill up the lobby as a killer, specially on PS4
---
what is meme name?for real i cant find it anywhere
---
Oh shit you right. I forget those weren't launched with the cosmetic store.
---
You got me there, fam. You got me.
---
Still not her strongest showing though. It's better than those fugly skirts she has, but when they came out a lot of my friends referred to them as ''Trash Bag Feng."
---
yeah i really hate when people complain about me using my power effectively because its so stupid its like people telling you to not play your character right its soooo stupid
---
* Hag Wants To Know Your Location *
---
yes that would be a slight problem but I still think it is a better trade off then having game canceling after cancels on cancels on more cancels
---
No you get more XP if you do that stuff, pretty sure, maybe wrong though
---
Clown doesn’t stun you. The gas cloud disorients but you can still move
---
The wider hit box of the killers compared to the survivors actually makes the smaller loops more effective. Killers have to travel a longer diameter. You can actually do the math and find out that you are effectively getting a virtual speed boost. This is what makes looping huntress (out of hatchets) easier. If you take the turns tight, you are almost as fast as the killer. Add Hope to that and you just created infinite loops (until the 3 minutes runs out).
---
Spirit with monitor. Spirit is great for sneaking up on people fast especially with her prayer beads add ons
---
what have you brought apon this cursed land

Nah. The guys from the evil dead tv show didn't have the rights to army of darkness, just evil dead 1 and 2. The army of darkness design wasn't used in the tv show either.
---
BHVR knows what the people want.
---
Try not camping and tunnelling
---
Chase extenders are considered great perks, I do agree with that. That's because the devs have made it their goal to make survivors weaker as chases continue (exhaustion nerf was unnecessary, many pallet locations have been reworked/moved though some of those were for the better) if survivors actually had a chance to escape a Chase, Chase extenders wouldn't be so favorable.
---
I love when I'm called a survivor main. I've been a killer main since its release on Xbox (and I got the pc version later down the road) and the fact you use "ugh survivor main" as a way to devalue anything I say shows where you stand. The game is swf favored. Solo survivors have it really rough, most people can destroy 4 solo survivors simply because they cannot communicate effectively unless everything aligns in the 4 solo survivor's favor.
---
&gt;Three minutes that gets significantly longer when anybody is downed or hooked
---
&gt;Not long enough
---
lmao ok
---
I still do it for the BP, especially if someone else is being chased so I know I won't suffer from it and may end up with even more BP going for a hook save a minute later. You're welcome to hate me.
---
If this happened while I was the killer, I'd probably just stand there staring while laughing my ass off. Just waiting to see who would win before they die on hook lol
---
I'm so fucking tired of your shit and you've only made this comment.
---
"For gods sake i'm not Miss Piggy!"
---
Something else I thought up. a pig weapon retexture that changes the reverse bear traps to the laser trap from saw 8.
---
You do realize that they know it’s in the files and that people will find it? If they didn’t want that to happen they wouldn’t put the cosmetics in the ptb files.
---
Thanks. Let’s hope the Devs do some good rework and changes with the PTB. I encourage you to use the PTB and provide feedback so we maybe see a change that is more balanced.
---
I simply can’t agree. As someone who plays a majority of M1 killers, MoM has been mildly annoying at best. But to each their own I suppose.
---
That could work- but that would only apply to Logan, the villain from Jigsaw and not really Hoffman or Kramer himself.
---
David is really asking to get his dick sucked
---
Exactly my thoughts as well.
---
I feel like if they don't do some sort of new modes and such, even though they should know by this point that a lot of players want it just to play casually for fun,  then they should at least go threw survivor and killer perks and nerf the weaker or more useless ones to be more interesting to just have some fun.
---
It's also worth noting that the game already can, or at least use to be able to, handle a ton of players in 1 game. This isn't even the example I'm thinking of, but this video does show a 10 v 1 from the beta [https://youtu.be/HCKquqONy38](https://youtu.be/HCKquqONy38)
---
I'd imagine the main problem with it is that the killer is hosting, so everyone is connecting to 1 person and it might cause connection problems? I'm hopeful that they're waiting for dedicated servers to release before any plans to announce game modes such as 8 v 2 mode so that they don't run into issues of 1 person having to host so many more people on a game originally designed for a 4 v 1.
---
Uninstalling cuts down the amount of frozen loading screens by 100%
---
It's funny how little you seem to know about game balance.
---
lol but Dwight managed to unhook him anyway
---
Her T bagging ability makes her a high tier killer. No one can tell me otherwise
---
it was 30 sec i think Xd
---
He showed himself repeating the glitch though. Even if he isn’t promoting to do it he was using it. If it was permaban it’d be a little harsh but 24h isn’t honestly a big deal.
---
But it confirmed like a month ago?
---
Iirc there used to be a daily to get a kill with the trap, but it was removed.
---
i would love it if leatherface had this cosmetic
---

---
They could still give it to Kramer or Hoffman, since even though they never used them nothing in the movies says they couldn't.
---
Sauce?
---
What a happy family :D
---
I forgot about the killer power part of it. Was there something limiting about it that stopped people from using Wraith's or Nurse's powers? Also Myers actually.
---
I think the only ones I ever seen actually do anything was traps and chainsaws, but I believe I've played against 1 or 2 people with Wraith's power and they just never used it.
---
The new nea skin makes her look like meg and its great
---
It’s been 8 months since our last cosmetic line:(
---
Oh ok. Still pretty funny though
---
MoM is no where near as bad as old DS is, from a killer perspective.
---
For one, let's consider the fact that DS has a stun, whereas MoM doesn't. Then, let's consider you're already actively in a chase with MoM, whereas with DS you just ended one - and a non-obsession running DS could entirely catch you off guard and throw a wrench in your groove.
---
But then let's consider some of your arguing points where non-M1 killers excel against it. In order for a survivor to force it against non-M1 killers, they would have to purposely force the killer to M1 them, either by looping them well and making the killer hit them just to injure them, or by throwing themselves at the killer while the killer is taking someone to a hook. To top that off, once they have it ready, they'd have to stay injured to use it.
---
If you're already in chase and have good momentum going, MoM isn't going to make a huge difference. Is it annoying? Yeah, sure. I've had it used on me in a handful of games. Is it anywhere near as bad as old DS (from a killer perspective)? No, it's not. You don't get stunned *and* lose someone you were carrying, you just continue the chase for a little bit longer.
---
It's kind of like a survivor getting a good Dead Hard (when it actually registers) in and extending the chase. Also, until they fix the bug where it's not counting Nurse Blinks as M1s, I personally have stopped using it. But when I was running it, it either was used during the match or I most likely never got a single stack due to killers using their powers well.
---
I mean at least you gonna die at some point
---
i dont play on pc i play on ps4
---
I main both but I honestly I only feel worse for Jake. His cosmetics are 90% ass. They look good but idk he comes off bland. Everyone else has cosmetics as an extension of their character but he just feels bland and characterless
---
OfO
---
I prefer this kimono myself actually but nothing beats her cute uniform
---
True- it would also make up for a not too different Pig head. I guess they could try and explain it by saying the laser trap was originally designed by John and Logan simply reused it.
---
Great the gangs all here! Now we can die together :D
---
again, a ton of people don't read that. it pops up in the same way the patch notes do, so a lot of people probably assume it's patch notes and close it immediately. i know that's what i did at one point when i didn't care about the game.
---
I don't even need to look to see what happens because I'll being doing gens and one friend'll be looping killer. And me paying attention to skill checks my other friend'll say "totem done" and I hear "shit" followed by "OOOOOOAAAHHHHHH" and friend A eating shit on a hatchet.
---
*notices Myers’ bulgy-wulgy* ówò what’s thiws?
---
That’s weird considering the reverted the match making to the old one it hasn’t been the new one for a good while now
---
I'd agree on rape in human society but not on death as we're talking specifically about murder which is the same unnatural as rape is.
---
... With exception actually, and that's huge - war. Killing on war is not only allowed but actually encouraged as government actually wants people to engage in war willingly. I'm not trying to play saint pacifist here and have huge respect for army and military, but that's the only major difference I can find between kill acceptance in media (and unavoidable murder acceptance as well) and rape acceptance.
---
tl;dr What I came to think about is that higher powers actually interested in desire to kill but not in desire to rape, as rape doesn't have any practical use.
---
**Tremendously Increased**
---
I am a big Psycho fan and thought about it yesterday but couldn’t think about any perks.
---
Oh boy I can't wait to express my frustration about dying unfairly to the killer as my organs are pierced by the great spider gods ground dick.
---
did the person who had those perks literally just crouch away from you when you chased them? seems pretty hilarious to imagine
---
Sorry boys... I lost it. The spirit baited my ass really hard. I was their for about an hour watching    YouTube and I was gonna win it for us... but I didn’t.
---
Lol I predicated my own demise in pregame chat. People were saying their dailies and I said, "I gotta run the killer for 3mins so yeah finnin to be face camped and first hook." Sure nuff first one found. Hag so barely a chase since it kept breaking chase and her traps getting me. Then she put all 10 traps around me after hooked. 
---
Like you played normally, no flashlight no tbags I pallet stunned her once. But thats it.
---
I think I know what this killer was thinking about when he invited us to his basmenet.
---
&gt; Fps on console hasn’t been this low since December when the legion came out
---
lmao this is blatantly, totally untrue
---
i hope this is true, by the way they made it sound they just ban everyone who uses it. i know i've heard stories of people doing the 2 killer glitch before it was announced that they would get banned, and they still got banned, but that was a more obvious glitch so idk. different situation
---
I have a *source*, if that's what you're asking for?

---
Ah, sorry. I used to play on PS4 until just before Legion came out. Had everyone (survivor and killer) at level 40 to unlock the perks (and Spirit P3ed)
---
Switched over to PC because I waned to play some Nurse and Huntress. (I still mainly play with a controller on PC, lounging on the couch).
---
Consoles in general have really bad fps and servers for dbd. From experience dbd lags a lot regardless of your internet connection. And the loading does cause even more lag.
---
Shut up
---
Judging by how awful Legion is so are the devs lol
---
MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE!
---
Damn. Now I need to save to get those David and Jake outfits.
---
This is 100% true for me and I see no reason to argue with you because this is my experience with the game atm, also knowing you it’s probably gonna be a pain in the ass to have a conversation with you again.
---
Yeah killer is ass for me rn because if I pip past 15 I get matched with rank 10s. Than I depip and get 15+, than pip back up
---
It's awful
---
Actually Feng got three 'Star Trek' cosmetics
---
Give people a reason to stick around, that's how you fix a lot of the DCs. If you got some level of reward instead of sitting around for nothing so often, people like me would stick around. So many idiot teammates that don't unhook you when you're wide open, don't heal you, let you go into stage 2 when you've been clear for ages... it's not like there aren't obvious reasons why people DC.
---
MoM isn't as bad as DS, but "less OP than DS" isn't the bar.
---
Old DS was wildly out of line, so much so that even after they absolutely gutted it into its current form, it's still a solid A-B tier perk.
---
If you're playing a non-M1 killer, you won't have any issues with the perk. They aren't the ones I care about here.
---
Are you kidding me with "It won't make a huge difference"? It's like a good Dead Hard... but you can run it in conjunction with any exhaustion perks you like, including Dead Hard.
---
Downplaying the importance of +1 health state is incomprehensible to me. If a survivor plays even *kinda* well that's easily an extra 30 seconds (likely more), on top of the time you've already invested chasing them, in a game that can be ended in 3 minutes.
---
Considering that the perk tends to trigger later in the game, that becomes even more important since MoM triggering in the endgame is essentially a free escape.
---
If I make more I wouldn't want it to be one of the simple ones so I'd probably go with Haddonfield.
---
We were extremly close to an exit so I think if enough of us body blocked then we would have all made it out. 
---
That would be crazy if he did though. Alas he had the meta build so nothing fancy last minute. I was suprised there wasn't a noed but it was a good one!
---
Then you'll wake up from your nightmare and find him standing at the end of your bedpost.
---
Me nethier i just snipped it and edit it
---
Jesus christ that nea outfit is awful
---
10/10 for effort but a *nearly*/10 for effectiveness. 
---
But thanks anyway. :o)
---
Eventually, this stuff will be available by iridescent shards, like the 80s Collection is now.
---
They weren't actually, I watched it multiple times. It looks like the gates are powered when hatch is closed but no confirmation. Same with gens and doors. Waiting for more info.
---
Killers are bad at the game so the devs keep giving them OP BS. Now every killer has small terror radius (some have none at all) with perks and addons along with tons of ESP and 1 hit KO. Playing survivor is like playing a free2play game full of hackers now. Killer is no longer fun because of it as well. 
---
The proof is in how many downvoted this comment gets from all the bad killers who only want pussy mode.
---
Billy gets my ass through windows all the time..
---
A small roadmap on the forums. They said there would be a surprise today, and quite a lot of us were hoping for something like licensed cosmetics.
---
Yeah, I'm also hoping for dedicated servers to shake things up. And also optimization as well, as right now the game performance is hugely capped by how the game tracks activity of each player - basically it pings everyone's actions and locations all the time, so in order to optimize the game they are changing it to event-based system instead. 
---
So the hope is that dedicated servers + optimization will clear the road for new modes.
---
I also just noticed what you did for Quentin. Nicely played.
---
I aim to please.
---
I think they were talking about the dev's dodging questions about working with lionsgate. The tweet you linked is in regards to them beating dataminers.
---
god this stuff looks bad.  
---
of course you're gonna call anyone an entitled toxic douche when they're even giving you the perfect clothing to go with that
---
Did you play the video with sound on?
---
It definitely looks like Joey from the stance and overall look.
---
Honestly the only way to get good Bp is Killer. But then everyone still dc’s so what’s the point. Between bugs, lazy devs and toxicity there’s virtually no reason to play. The Devs just aren’t taking things seriously and the game and the players suffer for it. Happens with lazy, inexperienced, egotistical Devs. They make something semi decent with huge potential, get a couple high ticker licenses for hype, then when some money rolls in they get big heads and stop actually caring. Happens so often now, and its disheartening.
---
I should've clarified that I think it's stupid that this game has it but doesn't punish people that abuse it
---
Was farming as pig and the swf refused to pallet stun me even when I hit the pallet and waited. Post game they said its too sad she sounds like a puppy.
---
It’s a godsend on Lerry’s tho, literally spend the first 2 minutes looking for a generator pn that map lol
---
Without being a disciple of jigsaw, Amanda wouldn't exactly be teabagging in a pig costume either.
---
Ah that’s hot
---
Great outfit for Nea but I'm sick of the sunglasses. I hope there's an alt head without them. My bff is a Feng main and I feel so bad for her too..all she wants is bunny Feng.
---
&gt;I want people to have fun on both sides of the coin, both killer and survivor.
---
you. i like you.
---
there is a crazy "me vs. them" mentality with this game, and i wish more people tried to play this way - it's much more fun when you know the opposite side is having fun, too.
---
gg wp :)
---
So in other words you refuse to get better and when things don’t go your way you are going to DC? Honestly people like you How can’t handle losing shouldn’t even be playing this game. Your not gonna win every fucking game you play. Either learn that you aren’t gonna win all the time or stop playing the game. And just because the first part of the game didn’t go good dosent the mean you are going to automatically die. Just because you got hooked once dosent mean you’ll die, you still have a chance to be saved.
---
What's changed? I haven't played for a couple months.
---
Easily Myers with M &amp; A. Myers at tier 2 has 8m terror radius meaning survivors won't hear him until he is within lunging distance. As long as you hide from their LOS. 
---
Spirit with Prayer Beads can phase without any sound allowing her to grab players off gens before they can react. Without beads as long as they are in your terror radius, they will not hear you phasing over to them but survivors might expect it.
---
Wraith is good for sneaking up on players. The only issue is that the bell does give away your position but it can be useful if you block LOS &amp; use add-ons like the bone clapper or the ghost soot add-on. 
---
Myers is your best bet.
---
You're right because a killer that does that might get a black pip, unless you somehow can't beat a killer that camps the first hook.
---
Coming out in the next few weeks before the mid chapter.
---
Really, we're question Nea here?
---
*stares at Ace, Claudette, and Meg*
---
* The killer doesn't know what perks you're running before the trial, so at this point playing anybody who can't counter MoM is risking you not having a chance to begin with.
---
* Being back to "Play the top tier or lose" isn't a good sign.
---
* Nope, those are just the guys who can theoretically deal with MoM, but in practice won't be able to. Decent survivors don't step in bear traps, get hit by LF's saw, or get caught off guard by miss Piggy.
---
* **You can't balance the game around survivors being potatoes.**
---
* Having a perk that completely invalidates some killers while being useless against the others is a terrible, terrible idea.
---
Ye, that's right
---
Well, every game ever made has a quit option specifically for shit like that, so if that makes me an idiot than it makes every developer ever pretty stupid too, right?
---
Come on dude. This reads like an edgy high school student typed it. Shit happens in everyday life.
---
I really just want to guarantee a pip if you get 4 kills. Nothing is more frustrating than destroying the other team in under 5 minutes and depipping because of it.
---
I mean, you never want to mix anything with hos.
---
Always keep them pure.
---
Lol, okay. Have you even seen Tru3? He's been Rank 1 since before the Hag was released.
---
Who are you exactly?
---
Give me an incentive to stick around. I run kindred so I can see what's going on... if my teammates aren't going to try and help me before I go stage 2 then I see little reason to waste my time struggling.
---
play with your food
---
Those will be worth just as much now as it would be during the blood hunt. Blood hunts just add another +100% to the base score along with any other modifiers, it won't double what you get with the boosters.
---
Holy hell, obligatory "Thanks for the gold, stranger!" post. I really didn't think one of my first posts would gain so much traction. ❤
---
Y'all really like buffing this perk. How about we make it so it heals a health state too when you unhook them?
---
PTB is tomorrow and it always gets datamined. Always. So they just leaked it themselves
---
PSA to anyone else who may be reading these comments, don't be the piece of shit who will look in someone's face and tell them to fuck off so you can finish a video game.
---
Seriously, how old are you? You've never been responsible for someone in your life have you?
---
Crowley gave his soul for 2 extra inches so maybe 4$ is worth it
---
Gotta get that deep cleansing achievement.
---
If we’re just straight up not giving Amanda cosmetics and adding extra characters, then I want 1984 Nancy cosmetic on Quentin lol
---
Ah then yes I agree with you
---
I wish he had a goatee too.
---
That's what she said.
---
I'm rank 14 and have been activity initiating chases if the killer hasn't had one within the first generators completion, I mean I'm not a great looper but I want to have a good round and pip
---
&gt;2 this is a LOT more cosmetics than the "$5" worth we usually get.
---
lol what? ur acting like they are doing us a favor for selling us cosmetics.
---
Furries deserve the death penalty, change my mind.
---
now use the rest of the source material as a template ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I am an absolutely shit Clown. Dunno why, I think I keep forgetting that his bottles don't do damage. So I spend the whole match trying to done survivors with bottles instead of cutting off loops.
---
I'm sure many survivors will not know that you can't be interrupted jumping in either
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
What did you do!
---
&gt; the devs expect the killer to still play for their enjoyment
---
Why do you say this? I don't see any evidence that the devs expect the killer not to play for their own enjoyment.
---
But that's exactly how you BECOME a good looper. There are people with lots of hours that actively avoid being found, and then when they do get found (obviously) they have no idea how to drop the chase.
---
Looka infected and doesent even look like the perk
---
1 but how is that worthy of a surprise? Why not just make em available in the PTB like 2.0.0 PTB
---
2 thats not the point
---
3 yeah but we get these every PTB.... so not a surprise
---
Should just be a game mode that gives bonus blood points honestly
---
Already new Jane cosmetics and she's the newest survivor. WHERE'S MY DARN FAT BOI JEFF COSMETICS?!?!?! THIS GAME IS BASICALLY UNPLAYABLE UNTIL HE GETS MORE COSMETICS!
---
Caution! You could attract white knights by stating some kind of criticism, even if its sarcasm! Had like 3 of them today, loading into another universe
---
True true. Can't argue with that
---
Didn't say it was broken. There's just a lot of bad killers who use it.
---
On the other hand, I just played a round against some guys I assumed were new because they kept hook diving my Bubba and when I carried the last survivor to the hatch (and I carried him across the whole map), he called me a camping motherfucker.
---
So I am now in the process of burning through my mori stack. Say hello when you find me in the fog, p3 Bubba with 35 ebony moris and counting.
---
yes
---
I NEED THE NEA AND LEGION ONE
---
It's not confirmed unless they say it, whole video is worded pretty badly. Also Mr. Smartpants you explained nothing about gate opening part, which shouldn't be an issue for such a woke guy like you
---
Screen cap the end game screen showing their addons &amp; name,  open a support ticket on DBD website, attach screen shot.
---
Major PITA, but it's pretty much guaranteed results
---
Billy and clown. I am horrible with the chainsaw, constantly getting out maneuvered by survivors or sometimes having it go through them without actually damaging  them. 
---
With the Clown I just don’t like him at all. He feels like a worse huntress when it comes to aiming and the debuff he does to survivors doesn’t do enough to justify learning him. 
---
With both killers I tend to just run people down whacking at them like I don’t have any abilities.
---
I agree
---
oh thank you
---
Source please?

huh, Guess death *is* an escape after all
---
&gt; dc's when Ruin was cleansed because lets be honest, I can only imagine someone dc'ing for that if it occurs early on
---
I recently had a Hag who had already gotten several hooks DC as soon as I found Ruin because she was too far away to teleport to me and protect it. I hadn't even cleansed it yet. So I guess it happens.
---
I just meant are you excited for it or sad to see the current iteration go?

Is that a joke?

Go hard or go home I guess lol

Really? Didn’t even realise that.
---
The argument is over and done and we are on better terms. Let blood lie where it lies, and forge for something better. No need to stir up anything. We agreed to disagree and we parted ways.

I sincerely hope that this rework makes him even semi enjoyable to play against, cause right now IMO he is the most unfun killer to play against
---
Leathy
---
 To be fair I didn’t look at the time last comment was posted OP, fair enough pal.
---
I've been out so I haven't really seen much yet.
---
When did they say the next bloodhunt?
---
wish it was risky
---
It's perfectly fine! I appreciate you trying to stand up though.
---
Every game sub has the worst memes
---
Yeah sadly. I've been saving up shards just in case they do something like that again 🤞
---
I swear they purposely always have something set to spawn in front of the gates to cover it from the killer. I hate when i try to look from a distance if it's being opened and then i have to walk almost all the way before i can even see the damn switch
---
I'm afraid they'll change him too much and I won't enjoy him as much. I know he's not strong but I still like him.
---
I'm not really on his side, yes he showcased the glitch as a means of awareness, but one or 2 matches would have been enough, There was no need for multiple different matches. Props to him tho for actually making people/devs aware about it.
---
Yeah whenever I play killer this seems to happen as well lmao, first time this happened as a survivor though!  
---
I was gonna open the door, and I go around the bush but get startled by the Bill lmao.
---
i think what makes it funnier is that was a deleted scene added into the Directors cut
---
that means even the Production Company disliked it and Zombie STILL thought it needed to be seen.
---
The theatrical version didnt include it and had Michael kill a few guards to escape confinement.. and then Machete
---
When you throw a pallet down but the huntress respects it and throws a hatchet at u and still misses
---
That's not really tunneling, he's chasing you. People like to throw the word tunnel a lot. Tunneling is when the killer leaves a chase on someone else to go back and chase the person who just got unhooked and ignores everyone else. If you've been chased for a long time and haven't gone down that's not Tunneling, that's a man wanting to get his BBQ stack.
---
Yeah, the theatrical cut had a perfectly fine escape. But Zombie has to include that all important rape scene that really improved upon the movie.
---
Jake = Oliver Twist
---
Joey's looks great, and a lot of people play him. Not everyone is a Susie fan. Adam's looks pretty good too. Maybe it's just because I'm black, he's my main survivor, and just happy to see him getting a cosmetic with shades. I feel like you were just looking for something to be mad about.
---
No I'm not excited sorry. I dont want his power changed, I main him because I like the way his power is right now.
---
Get BBQ&amp;C instead and put it on Myers. Even better, put it on Doctor. I liked to farm with Legion using BBQ, but I'm kinda doubting that it will be as good as before now.
---
BP boosters are good, but they are modifiers that will let you reach 100% BPs and work better when you want to get points without needing to farm (work with Survivors to make points in a friendly match), just playing normally.
---
If you want to go above and beyond, get BBQ and Party Streamers. You will easily make 80K+ BPs in matches.
---
My first game was along the lines of 
---
\-I knew nothing about loops
---
\-Killed 2 survivors
---
\-Stalled the game for nearly 20 minutes due to my aggressive gen patrols
---
\-Got Looped to shit
---
I am still a mediocre killer but damn mate first real game and starting off with a 3 out of 4 dead. 
---
Seeing you as a wraith main down the line.
---
Lmao that's hilarious. I can just imagine you actually getting  a jump scare when you saw the other bill
---
uwu
---
Alright, so let's do this. Let's list every pure M1 killer, excluding Nurse, because a) it's bugged for her right now, and b) her power is extremely strong anyways.
---
* Trapper
---
* Wraith
---
* Hag
---
* Doctor
---
* Clown
---
* Pig
---
* Meyers (we'll even say he's using T1 meme build)
---
* Freddy
---
* Legion (will likely be stronger against him after rework, but currently is moot)
---
* Spirit
---
I didn't count Plague in there due to her Corrupt Purge ability. Most of these killers have built-in counters to deal with MoM. Trappy boi has traps, and good Trappers are honestly my worst nightmare. Wraith players have potential to use the body block strat to get an easy hit in. If you really want to say who gets screwed by it the most, Freddy and Pig are definitely the highest on that ladder. Spirit and Hag , I could see simply because they're slower, but they both have powers that let them easily get around.
---
My point is, most of the killers have a way of "dealing" with MoM - be it a mobility increase, a way of slowing the survivors, or in some cases, an ability that prevents the survivor from getting a stack. I've played about an equal amount of survivor and killers games since Ash has come out. The few times I *have* seen it in-game as a killer, it's been a complete waste of a perk, either because it never gets used, or because it falls under the "DS User" stereotype where the user goes down .5 seconds after it goes off.
---
I really isn't "OP" but more of a nuisance as a killer. And if it's the "good survivor" that you're chasing that's running it, you can leave the chase at any point and go after someone else. Sometimes the smarter thing to do is to go after the weaker link out of the bunch and remove them from the equation instead.
---
When you're running father's glasses and you spawn on the game.
---
Heh
---
Im so pumped for Dying Light 2
---
Not a single jumpscare that entire game from the killer, but that Bill, god damn dude! xD
---
When I started playing, a month before Huntress was released, it was too easy for survivors to win/escape.
---
Gens were stupid fast, like now, only without the 10% co-op debuff we have now. Plus brand new parts were a ton stronger than they are now.
---
It was possible to selfcare to full between hits, and borrowed time effected the saving survivor as well as the saved.
---
DS was the Meta toxic perk, and it was super tilting to killers, especially considering that we had insta blind flashlights and pallet vaccum as well.
---
Survivors that were good, ran with teams, and had good items and perks, could easily embarrass the most adept killers, even some nurses!
---
Back then, survivors had all the power. Gen rushing was not about "the only objective survivors had" it was controlling the length of the game. Killers had no say in how things went.
---
So, to sum it up: Right now, survivors are quite strong if they all work hard and play well. Back then, survivors could fuck around, have 4 players follow the killer with flashlight, fighting over who gets the save. Today, at least 1 person has to be on gens at all times or they all might die.
---
The strength of survivors has been cut down by at least half, so being caught first, hooked first, looked at, is insta DC because they know they can't moon walk for 20 minutes, BT save, DS, blind, and escape. With no worries.
---
Once Mettle of man gains traction, survivors will be a bit stronger, but because they are not able to attain godlike levels of toxicity, they can hardly handle hearing a terror radius.
---
Tldr: survivors were nerfed, and because it actually takes a brain to win now, they DC as soon as they get tilted. Which is instantly.
---
I don't know how his height is defined as average in the killer info, pig aswell , they both should be set to "Tiny little cuties"
---
Literally No one:  
---
BHVR: Hey lets give clown a bulge.
---
Who needs a hook when you have a hook hand!
---

They may reused the Joey mask for Frank.

---
Yes officer, this post right here.
---
Survivor favored... What’s your damage?
---
I have had the same thing and it shows the killer DC and then I ask them why and they say I DC with a screen shot showing I DC when I didn’t. So allot of DC I think is the game and not the people. I have had awesome and terrible games with playing Survivor and the killer DC and then to find out I got booted or they got the boot but didn’t hit the button or pull the plug and are as confused as I am.

Thanks guy... It means a lot. I feel lost right now and just depressed

The one time I tried this, the Claudette kept wiggling free and once ran straight over the hatch without taking it. I got fed up and hooked her.
---
*Scoffs in Legion*
---
You get 50 dc’s and the lgeion unlocks supposedly makes people dc instantly. LOL
---
I love the suggestion tag
---
This information is great, thank you for it!
---
No problem, wrote it during a blood hunt sometime last year
---
Then what’s the point of trying to coby if you use the luck offerings? I’ve done this not to suicide but to try and coby when my shitty random solo teammates were just standing around and not doing anything! Then I would get a cool down penalty? That’s they say I quit playing this game. It’s one thing to DC but if you dye on the hook wether you did it or just natural you shouldn’t get a penalty!
---
It’s the whole reason I’m doing a 2nd run!
---
Cant be a Zombie film unless every single character is a POS
---
Just wait till end game collapse, you're gonna walk around the bush and find a myers opening the door lmfao
---
you mean between the match itself and the lobby? my wife and i get that multiple times a day.
---
Had that exact same thing happen to me as huntress on that map, probably even the same locker...
---
Its the haunted locker
---
There's a difference between actually trying and just giving up. If you are stuck on a hook and your teammates dont hell, that will show when you waited and struggled the full time.
---
OMG That thought is actually really fucking scary haha, a scratched mirror Myers. I got my first one of those today, almost jumped out of my skin
---
They did a Predator DLC where the Predator is just a cosmetic itself. Maybe that is their new approach, then Ghostface can be a cosmetic DLC for Legion.
---
Pig. I don't know why people put her in low tier. She has stealth, mind games and stall. Yeah, she is a little bit RNG dependent and she still can be looped. But she has Ruin and Blood Warden in her base kit, she can use her crouch to get a free first hit, then she can use her Ambush to get hits at short and medium loops. 
---
But I am scared that devs might want to nerf Reverse Bear Traps because of that whole thing with End Game Collapse. She probably have the best end game from all killers right now, but if Reverse Bear Traps will not stop anymore survivors with them to leave through exit gates, then she may become a real low tier.
---
Nobody is talking about my Adam omg he looks good!
---
He has been learning from Freddy
---
Yeah i've only ever seen 1 but i run it all the time &gt;:)
---
That sounds familiar, I was an Ace if you can remember, there was also an Ash and Nea and someone I can't remember...
---
Link?
---
Won't know until we hear more
---
Yeah that will totally fix the issue
---
lol, there’s other ways players can leave the game.
---
This is like one of the most entertaining juke videos on this sub, lmao, nice job!
---
yeah dude
---
I honestly can’t remember that clearly. I don’t play this game often, but my GF says hat the jags always place traps around the hooks. The timing of this post made me think it was me. I coulda been playing you, who knows. I’m on the east coast if that helps
---
“True games” 😂😂
---
when you bring a purple flashlight with sapphire lens and long life battery but youre the only one to load in
---
I'm not an asshole just cuz black people suck ass
---
it motivates me less to leave by completely leaving the game and having to launch it again
---
You underestimate how much other players are willing to ragequit.
---
Did you fucking forgot to put /s ya cunt
---
wait, are you saying that you leave the game because there's a "leave the game" button?
---
Oooh yer one of those scary bastards monkaS
---
Dead serious, I’d rather play against legion 10/10 times 
---
My problem with Freddy is the dream state is just so damn annoying. Every action is slowed to a crawl, and to get out of it without the help of another survivor is RNG dependant, which has screwed me over on numerous occasions. 
---
I get people’s problems with legion, but something about playing against Freddy frustrates me to no end
---
no i don't, i just imagine it would motivate me less if it wasn't there
---
I hate anything to do with Nea but that hair is fucking sick
---
I mean, what’s the point to in grinding out all those DCs? People already instantly dc
---
r/TIHI
---
I'd rather face Freddy cuz at least I can loop him and help the team by running him around. Legion just tickles my butthole and makes me want to die.
---
Why is every Nea cosmetic terrible. The only good ones were the mean streets green hair and that top with the backpack.
---
Usually happens when I use Escape Cake! or a streamer
---
Most have to close it out on the loading screen because it freezes and relaunch the game anyway :(
---
someone have the man with legion main on his  and the woman with  noob  pointing to the man
---
Mom can you come pick me up
---
that's another case because there isn't a "leave the game" button during loading screens
---
Pretty gud
---
If you're telling about H.O.D he got unbanned less than 24 hours later?
---
Pipping should be base on hooks not kills. 12 hooks is a double pip, 8 hooks is a single pip, 4 hooks is a safety pip
---
That is what I read. " I don't camp, I just patrol REALLY closely"
---
Xbox? because i think i was playing with that guy
---
What are the addons for fire crackers?
---
It’s because he has a broken nose on top of his strong Slavic features. Strong forward brow bones, narrow eyes, slightly heightened jawline... also his features tend to all converge towards the tip of his nose. This makes him look atypical by traditional western media standards but nevertheless makes him more charming in my opinion.
---
Would prefer David King over any generic copy paste white male you see in other games.
---
So he basically moved at 4.52 movespeed when crouched, that sounds super fun
---
On the real tho, theres literally a long list of shit theyve straight up stolen from so many games. Why can they just get away with it?
---
just remove the "leave the game" button
---
Yes he realizes, that’s literally what his post says.
---
.
---
Mmm...look around you, very clearly you can see that the majority is killer in this subreddit. Look at the flairs, look at the majority of posts and look at the complaints. Everything is killer skewed here, which isn’t a big deal, but it’s insane to try and say it isn’t.
---
It's a copypasta
---
🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
My Nightmare has been at P3 level 1, nothing in the inventory, for so long, I didnt recognize the add ons.

I was like "is that a flashlight add on?" lmao
---
I feel like he's the "funny guy" out of everyone, wearing these strange cosmetics.
---
At the same time though  (especially if players aren't allowed to blind or harm each other) this could be a good relief for toxicity. Just meme around with everyone.
---
T-bagged killer, gets chainsawed instantly, and dc’s in the first minute of the game.
---
Man im dying, i read this in Tobey's voice
---
https://imgur.com/a/1CcWz0j
---
Explanation of what happened: 
---
There is actually no one in the locker. The Ace that was in the locker was actually out running around with another survivor but the camera had just froze on the locker. So whenever I would switch to him the camera would show the locker that he wasn't in until eventually he got hooked and the camera reset to him being hooked and after that his camera was fine.
---
Unpopular opinion, but he is right, it’s his game and money he can play how he wants,
---
But yeah they really need to do something about these DC’s
---
I was mad. Play as much as you want. I tend to go to far when I'm mad. It is a rant but the only thing I meant about the whole post is to fix the corn. Making them smaller could help, or making them less dense. Something. I get those maps everyother gamr as killer.
---
They can just run out and teabag the killer with the fun and balanced perk MoM, for example. :P
---
All we can do is wait, but I have faith with bhvr right now as I'm a fan of the end game and legion changes (although legion may need to be tweaked a little bit imo) that they're bringing in.
---
the hood would take up the  head and the torso so putting on a head with a ponytail would end up with the ponytail going through the hood
---
If you mean when the games freezes then you can’t do anything about it.
---
If you mean the game closes at random moments idk what you can do sorry

No. I’m providing an example of a certain kind of attitude and behavior that needlessly ruins the game for other people.

---
Well I don’t know what to tell you. That’s just simply not true. I hate to be out here calling you a liar but you’re a liar. There’s few posts around complaining lately, and honestly, the screeching is almost always from the killers. It went from DS (which they successfully got nerfed) and now they’re on adrenaline and mettle of man that they think is too strong. It never ends with the complaints.
---
If you’re so cocky and sure of yourself put up a poll.
---
Yeah some people are definitely fucked up in this game. 
---
I got HARD camped and tunnelled by killer all match only for them to tell me that girls shouldn't play games, I'm the reason incels exist and should be one of Brock Turners victims in chat afterward. Super disturbing to find out you're intentionally being targeted in the game for those reasons because they looked at your profile before the game started.
---
Yeah man, it's not even showing up on a Google search so idk what to tell ya.
---
Nice :)
---
I do this
---
Well Mcote is right. There's so many good underrated games under the rocks out there and they actually WORK.
---
Which outfit is this?
---
I mean, I don’t and I do agree. If you are getting tired of it, maybe you should switch it up and play something else for a while but also they should improve their game if people are complaining.
---
So basically, you consider top tier killers (except LF) to be annoying, and bottom tier killers (except Clown) not annoying
---
It's like Michael's P3 blood stain, not that bad IMO
---
''Not usually annoying'' *laughs in Doctor with a 200meter terror radius*
---
I love when someone instantly pops my ruin, there's no reason to cleanse another totem, but someone still cleanses my HG lol.
---
People don’t dress up as dogs and then go to parks and have children pet them.
---
Looks nothing alike but okay
---
My issue with that is that a perk shouldn't be required to reach your totems before they are destroyed in early game. Same thing with how I dont think ruin should be required to stop half if the gens from being done in the first minute
---
lol if anything solo players benefit from the advantage of having an SWF in their lobby.
---
No, not allowed young man
---
Yeah, apparently.
---
Kind of. At least Frost doesn't look like a goblin.
---
It means dont post fucking 2012 memes
---
Don’t be mean to Nea )’:
---
And the same thing would happen if you just followed them through the loop, but would take more than five times as long per pallet... she just chased me for nearly 8 loops around a normal Red Forest pallet without doing anything. I'm sorry but "just" moving the survivor on to the next pallet immediately would be a *vastly* better course of action than what she did.

Insane people do, and we don't kill insane peoole until they kill somebody else.
---
Can we quit the vaguebooking and get names? I can’t be invested if I don’t know literally everything 😫
---
hey you're the the same as the first source &gt;:(
---
(jk ty)
---
This has to be bait, there’s no way anyone actually finds Legion less annoying than Huntress.
---
rotten fields is actually balanced pretty nicely, as the only thing that can really fuck you over is if you get really unlucky in regards to tile generation, which goes for any map really. shack is a piece of cake to run when you do it correctly, and only having to worry about that structure and cowtree vs having to worry about BOTH + the abomination of a silo, barn, or slaughterhouse makes it much more bearable to play. 
---
it's a pretty big map however, which will expose killers w/o any map control abilities. it's reason #1 as to why hillbilly and nurse will always reign supreme to any other killer in their current states: mobility. it's an unfortunate truth in regards to how this game is currently balanced, but i really don't see a way off the top of my head to change that without overhauling a lot of how this game functions.
---
This entire sub is fucking 2012 memes now and I hate it
---
Beautiful 🥰
---
This is why i don't play solo.
---
Her Japanese outfit looks awesome though not gonna lie
---
It hasn't been realised yet but the Devs teased it today
---
Yeah it really does look great.
---
Legion's cosmetic seems very cool, I really don't like Spirit's cosmetic, Jane's cosmetic seems too dirty for me and David looks like Hitler with that outfit.
---
Plus that guy, that stayed is going to blame you and hate you for not letting you go.
---
lololololol face
---
I don't know, but Legion sure is!
---
*Laugh track and cheering*
---
Bless the data gatherers for they are doing the Lord's work.
---
These numbers don't look good though. Nearly half of all matches has a DC. That's big issue.
---
...and just like that, I'm a David main.
---
Sorry I couldn't tell you haha. You end up with twice as many points, which is really all that matters to me
---
Wow, Frost looks stupid as fuck now. RIP simple character design.
---
Account was created a day ago, we have been bamboozled bois
---
Which combination of toolbox and addons gives the best results, also taking into account charges? In the video, the yellow one is the best because it's not nearly empty after one gen, but I'm curious if there's other options that can save even more time when you consider how many times you can use it in a match.
---
Seconded. Doctor and plague are way up there for me.
---
*lullaby intensifies*
---
Weird. I might be incorrect and if so then sorry.
---
He said slow down or FREEZE, which freezing would stun/halt survivor movement
---
i dont think so you bps and emblems for that but xp i dependent from the time you were in the game
---
I have just stopped playing for now
---
My guy is just spamming r/deadbydaylight with shit memes from the stone age
---
Give us please
---
Another 100% added
---
How many days?
---
Ok, but I dont think your second idea will work very well bc most the time when I play survivor i run across the map to find ruin anyways. Itll be a little better bc it wouldnt literally be right next to me when i spawn like it sometimes is but it would still likely get destroyed very quickly. I agree it shouldnt take a whole perk to prevent totems being destroyed, but thats basically what toth does now anyways. I suppose it could just be a mechanic that a totem is blocked for say 60 seconds so at least itll stay up a bit longer
---
He's annoying and brain dead. His power has no counter play and most of his mains are toxic
---
Yeah if it was specifically to force out surviours who are still in the match as the game said then the timer should be reduced
---
Only annoying killers for me are Legion and Nurse. I'd love to play against any others because Im only vsing nurses for the last week.
---
The same thing keeps happening to me! I always think I’m getting juked.
---
Wtf this is legit like flipped
---
Your nationality can be British but you can have different racial and ethnic backgrounds. I don’t understand your point, the two aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
I love his hair and outfit, but fuck dude that mustache is so bad
---
Welp, time to get MK11
---
If a Killer tells you camping is a legit strategy, it's probably because you were whining that you all stood in front on him while he was trying to hook and then didn't immediately walk away even though you were all flicking flashlights at him.
---
OP, have you honestly never heard of Alt+F4? Or the Task Manager?
---
I've actually seen many solo survivors get screwed over by swf because they all DC/they leave them to die on hook/etc etc, so I think a little boost for them wouldn't hurt either. Might make people want to solo more to have the possibility of a little boost in bp from getting paired with swf. I'd doubt it, but you never know.
---
Not to mention, with your 2nd idea survivors will always know the totem cant be near them so they will check the furthest side of the map to find it so itd be the same situation, itd just last a few more seconds. Granted I get the killer may find a surv before they reach it but that wont stop the other 3 who are also running to the otherside of the map to find it. Combine this with the fact survs often have to go to the opposite side of where they spawned when a killer runs corrupt intervention and ruin eill be gone just as fast as it is now
---
I mean eh, I get more enjoyment out of not giving the satisfaction, I can just browse social media or read on my phone, if one of them gets cocky, free kill, doesn't really matter to me, win win.
---
Got me laughing more than any other meme on this sub reddit. I love it.
---
Spoiler Alert: We Can't
---
I just pipped in my pants
---
Wow. The accuracy of this is astonishing.
---
Believe me, if I had a nickel for every hit I've missed with the Wraith I'd have a shitload of cosmetics.
---
Thats it, im committing iridescent head
---
nice.
---
I mean but he 4k'd, if he camped, either the survs were bad enough to deserve losing, or he just didn't camp.
---
Either way, he completely the killer's entire objective, killing the 4 survivors, how much more "adept" can you be.
---
They could literally give us Bunny Feng and we'd never need another skin
---
Given how poorly optimised the console version currently is, I never assume people actually play it.  
---
That being said, have you never heard of the power button? Or exiting to the dashboard?
---
I didnt know that, but pre patch it was horrible. Probably still isnt great lol

And it's NOED.
---
If the ping in the lobby is good, and then I immediately start rubberbanding around the map and get downed, I DC. That's basically it
---
There have been very good proposed fixes for NOED, such as removing the hex mechanic and instead making the perk token-based. This way it's another chance for killers who actually participated in the gameplay but didn't quite manage to sacrifice a lot of survivors instead of free downs for killers that didn't do anything all game.
---
I don't have any.
---
Agreed
---
What instance are you referring to? I can think of several.
---
Lol that was actually because of that old shit where you could get a message from a random person and it could crash your PS4 for to a link or something in their message. I love hatemail!
---
An attempt was made
---
Thats pretty racist
---
I’ve had this happen to me on the Coldwin farm map with the house while playing huntress, freaked me out! PS4 btw the doors slowly closed shut like super slow was weird.
---
Legion looks so cool. Too bad they’re gonna kill him 😔
---
But what point are you making?
---
guess i’ll just self care, get woken up, or fail a skill check 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You're a cunt.
---
Basement chest is my favorite "game" to play as a survivor :( Even at red ranks, I *always* go down to the box to play after gens are done.
---
One is so ugly I wan to run away from it and the other one I would play a carnival game during a zombie apocalypse to win him as a prize and escape with him
---
The entity wants 3 hooks minimum for all players and wants you to run them around and feed on their fear.
---
You people are disgusting you reserve no right to make fun of someone but how they want to express themselves.
---
Trying to finish the game as quickly as possible so you can move onto the next game. Letting the survivors get some farming in does not achieve this goal.
---
THANK GOD! Ty BhVR it’s been since the fat man came to visit us and put cheap toys under the tree!
---
MoM isnt too bad on its own. It’s when you get a 4 man SWF who are all running some combination of MoM, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, and Decisive Strike that the match becomes just about unwinabble if you’re not playing an instadown Killer.
---
List of my other perks:
---
Huntress Lullaby
---
NOED
---
Shadowborn
---
Spies From the Shadows
---
Whispers
---
Bloodhound
---
Deerstalker
---
Monstrous Shrine
---
Predator
---
Dude I know right hazy regent is like so annoying lol
---
Ohh, so I'm not out of the norm? ...O-kay, thought is was just me.
---
Entity wants a show for 30 min, not a slaughter in 5 min
---
Or you can just end the game quickly so no one has to play this boring ass game. Why does the killer have to farm? No one enjoys a two man game let’s all just move on from it
---
Finally a new Legion skin, and it looks great. Glad to be able to at least look good while I sit in a garbage can.
---
On a serious note, I actually do like the skin. 👍
---
One guy I went against kept throwing pebbles at random gens and I feel for it most of the time and I never felt like more of an idiot
---
While we're at it add a BP bonus for a Nurse or Moris or instant downs and tunnelers and campers. 
---
Seriously though, as annoying as those groups are, they are a minority in the survivor world. Majority of your SWF are just friends having fun who aren't even that good. It's no different than when I play against an M1 huntress or Billy then the next match I'm going against omega blink nurse who slugs and has everybody hooked with no gens done during the first 3 minutes.
---
This skin terrifies me not gonna lie.
---
I’m assuming OP left that space in the grid under dumbass for himself?
---
Damn I’ve been trying to make myself play this game after buying 3 dlcs but I never do, that’s the incentive I needed
---
Anytime I play ash or Francis I get tunneled into the ground. But this guy who wrote that has problems...
---
Red ranks or not? Cause if you’re not playing against Survivors who play optimally than yeah MoM is a mild annoyance at best. Against good Survivors who will use that extra hit to get to a safe loop/pallet it’s a momentum changer.
---
Guilty, on occasion.
---
Lmao! They need to post these in the different mazes lol!
---
Thanks, probably spent more time than I should have just thinking ideal spots for characters.
---
Been at high ranks consistently for each "season", preferred and mostly played killer since release on xbox, and migrated over to pc killer just cause. I'm really close to getting all killers p3 level 50 on pc (I need legion and plague), safe to say I am a killer main.
---
When you start unlocking more Teachables, get Trapper's perks first. Unnerving Presence won't help much, but Agitation and Brutal Strength are both insanely useful. 
---
Agitation will be an Excellent hooking perk that if combined with Iron Grasp will make bodyblocking impossible and give you access to nearly every hook on the map. 
---
But the really good one is Brutal Strength. Wraith has to eat Pallets like a breakfast meal, and being able to shred through them any faster is not only useful but crucial to keeping chases.
---
CJ as a survivor when?
---
Laurie: You picked the wrong survivor, fool! 
---
CJ: Hey Laurie, it's me Carl! Chill, chill!"
---
On console hit boxes are ridiculously stupid. I'll get hit 3 feet after I just through a window or billies chainsaw will hit me even if im 5 feet to the left of his dash
---
are you having a stroke
---
I appreciate your introspection into my comment but I'm being very general here. I'm actually looking at this from the perspective of meeting people who talk like this. They are usually effing scum. They fall into other categories and usually use just as brutal murder jokes. It's not specific to rape exclusively or anything like that. People like that...they don't limit themselves to jokes about rape. And this isn't to say that people who make rape jokes are all scum. Notice I said, "like this" - as in this manner.
---
If I can try to explain. There's something about someone who makes a lighthearted rape joke and then is like, oh shit, maybe this is offensive, vs the kind who really try to make the comment visceral. People who really think this kind of brutality in a joke is funny. Not your "innocent" (not always so innocent but you know what I mean) rape jokes, but the stuff like THIS.
---
There's no such thing as a win at that point. In a 2 man game the killer does not need to put in very much effort to kill at all. And survivors when escaping know damn well it's not cause they were amazing. The enemy in a 2 man or 3 man is not the killer or the survivor. It's BHVR, and it fucks both parties. If killer DC's, survivors get a 5k survival bonus. If survivors DC, killer gets quitter bonus. 
---
If you don't agree then fine, but in any 2 or 3 man game I'm either going to run up to the killer and wave or sit on a gen until they come to me and it's up to them to decide. 
---
And when I'm the killer in that situation, it's going to be an absolute farm fest and I'll take my points and be happy and I'll get some grateful survivors who don't want a 2 or 3 man. 
---
And that's what's important. I don't want a match handed to me on normal terms by any means. May the best skilled player win. But don't expect players to have respect for you if you don't care that you all got fucked by the game. From the killer side, it's the equivalent of urban immersed survivors that will hide the entire match on a 3 man and not touch a gen hoping you DC. That isn't fun for anybody.
---
It's a pinned post on the sub.
---
I hate these.. I feel like I always skim past it with my eyes and it's super obvious. Can someone give me a hint?
---
I wish I had the same bloodwebs as you, exact opposite for me.
---
the little meg is me missing a skill check then sprint bursting away
---
Yes red ranks. Rank 3 presently.
---
BABY MEG VS BABY TRAPPER
---
Lmao so true
---
LMAO I triggered the sub 80IQ roastie.
---
You realize I could just rephrase your shitty little comment, right?
---
SA to anyone else who may be reading these comments, don't be the piece of shit who will look in someone's face and tell them to drop whatever they're doing just so you get what you want
---
Just Open the Damn Gates CJ!! AWWWW THAT'S MY CJ!
---
You forget that most survivors are toxic.
---
If you rush the hook as a survivor after seeing someone get instadowned with NOED you deserve the death. The very first sign of NOED should make you back off, open the gate, and leave if the killer is anywhere near a hooked survivor. The hooked survivor is a lost cause as long as NOED is present. Find it and cleanse it or leave. There is no third option which is a smart option.
---
That's why i don't, i clarify because it's so common now. I'm not using Nurse currently because it's imposibble to get a full match without a DC.
---
Yeah huntress is pretty fun to play against imo. But I hate the pig.. I always have to do all boxes to get rid of the mask.
---
DO   
---
NOT   
---
GENTAP   
---
 
---
you idiots...
---
My God that was one of my favorite parts of the entire game lmao
---
They're sending him off with a neon encore
---
gotta sell them auric cells. at least they're using the money to fix the gam... oh wait
---
Sure.
---
Can I have a BP bonus for being the camped sacrifice when they mistaken me for being swf with the other 3 players and I'm not? Because I also find that frustrating.
---
Ya see it's 1 thing to be pulled off a hook .002 seconds after the killer put you on cause a retarded survivor wants points but it's another thing to be instantly focused by a killer just to get that sacrifice. If a survivor is being a tea bagging little prick by all means destroy him. But if I'm legit trying to play and I die within 3 minutes cause of a camping asshole that's when I get annoyed
---
SWFs should be nerfed, a BP bonus doesn't really do much. If you are a part of a SWF you should only be allowed to bring in 2 perks. Solo survivors should remain at 4 perks due to their disadvantage.
---
Happened to me while I was playing Huntress. Thought a survivor popped out lmao
---
Survivors: Do generators as fast as possible, actively ignoring anything that could hinder their escape. 
---
NOED: exists because no one cleansed any. 
---
Survivors: Pikachu face
---
They actually did  
---
they bought themselves off their previous owner and decided to go full cosmetic to get the money back  
---
that was their reasoning, don't argue with me
---
Take a look around the sub. There's video's on YouTube. You have to actively ignore it to not see it.
---
Thats what he said yeah
---
As much as I see toxic Surviviors I also see toxic killers so...it balances out if that is the standard lol
---
Yes but the way you said it, it seemed like you meant that killers were the only toxic ones
---
why did't you all like... leave?  
---
"mE WaNT sAvE eVEryOnE!"  
---
"oOF mE DeD!"  
---
"sTuPId nOEd kIddO!"
---
Hahah I’m not sure who I like better!
---
or  
---
you could... cleanse totems
---
yeah i always kind of wondered what the hell was he thinking when he said that
---
It's 2 schools of thought. I would prefer, both as killer and survivor to just get maximum points and let the survivors walk, versus just killer plays normal and ends game quickly. Agree to disagree.
---
I’m sure she at least looks better than you!

I hate the corn as well. It’s easy for me to lose a Survivor without the Madness effects. It gets worse when I’m playing Spirit because I can’t see the scratch marks that well in the corn. Some of the main buildings can be hell to chase a Survivor at too. Unless I’m sure I can catch them, I’ll just immediately leave the loop and go find someone else. They’re almost infinites. At least there’s only around 1-2 that can spawn, unlike Haddonfield, where any house with a window is an infinite. Balanced Landing makes that entire map hell. If you ask me, that’s the map that needs a good looking at.
---
“Ekki-ekki-ekki-PTANG!!!!!” 
---
Nice 😂
---
Wuth her sickness, she can counter perks like Mettle of Man, Adrenaline, Iron Will and she can also counter Instant Heals mid chase. For me, it's enough to put her in mid tier, around Pig and Myers. She is also a 115 speed killer which can become a ranged killer, and yeah, survivors can not cleanse and gen rush her, but don't forget that the broken status negates the heal from Adrenaline and most of the survivors gen rush just because they have Adrenaline to heal them in end game. So most of the survivors will cleanse themselves just because of this reason. She can run perks like Monitor and Abuse for ambush and down the survivors which decide to not cleanse or she can run perks like Enduring and Spirit Fury, so she can deal with looping. With some buffs ( like, make fully sickness to give more effects to the survivors, which may help you in chases or in stalling the game and survivors might have more reasons to cleanse themselves and make her again 115% speed while holding Vile Purge) she might become easily a top 5 killer. But right now, she is just mid tier.
---
Yeah, that's my only real peeve in this game so far. Everything else about the community is unironically lovely. Most of the people I run into are super friendly and I love this game.
---
But it's kinda annoying when you get the random rager who is mad that you "camped" because they literally followed you to the hook, tried to body block it, and then didn't walk away to let them unhook for free.
---
People call camping sometimes if you don't immediately run to the far corner of the map when you hook.
---
Tunneling is kinda whatever. There are usually 2 survivors you can cycle through hooks so I'll do that when I can, but I'm only a mediocre killer right now so if you run straight into me and you're injured I'm gonna down/hook you. I'm not skilled enough to be magnanimous because if I don't have someone in a chase or on a hook, I might never see another survivor all game.
---
with this system you get punished if the survivors are bad/selfish. since if they don't save anyone, you only get 1 hook instead of 3
---
I had to stop playing the other day. 2x party streamers burned and I didn't load in. Then a cake offering and no load in. Tried another cake and finally loaded in to end up chased for ages straight  at the start and hooked and no one came to get me off the hook.
---
It’s two different opinions and whilst yours is perfectly fine and I think it’s great (I still personally don’t want to farm), there are people who disagree (not only with you but with others) and are getting shit for not wanting to farm with the survivors. I do farm as a killer sometimes but if I want the game to be over then I’m not gonna farm coz the game fucked over everyone. It’s good some people do farm but still you can’t expect everyone else to.
---
&gt;lol what?
