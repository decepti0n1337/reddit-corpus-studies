Ohoooh, you are approaching me?
---
---
---
It even gives you offerings for killers you do own! 
---
Aaaw, Wraith is so cute.
---
Trying to rile the people up does though, and it actually has shown to work on at least 1 occasion with dedicated servers. 
---

---
I don't agree with this guys opinions, and he's doing it wrong, but he's not lying when he says this sub buries almost anything negative.
---
Clau ansd hag. Good luck!
---
You are seriously fucked up in the head. You are a massive bitch to anyone who disagrees with you, and or has a question. Jesus. 
---
That's what I assumed all along haha
---
Meme format used wrong, reeeeee
---
THE PARTY STARTERS ARE ANNOYING AS A SURVIVOR WHEN YOU HAVE IDIOTIC TEAMMATES
---
Ayy thx, I know the hair looks messed up, but I will work on it make it better :)
---
Dedicated servers is something that I think almost all people agree helps, and it‚Äôs something that the devs can physically change (and are going to). 
---
Posting that people need to downvote a video that he decides to be toxic is a different story 
---
They finally need to make Claudette have brighter clothes.
---
my ps4 is fine but it‚Äôs only 2 years old so i‚Äôd just say it depends‚Äîi‚Äôve personally heard that the ps4 pro is crap but that doesn‚Äôt actually mean it is
---
Thread won, you can close it
---
Not really considering the hooked person triggers whispers 
---
I didn't know it was a meme format, lol. Just referencing a song.
---
I thought for the longest time that survivor pudding icon is a guy taking a bath inside a pudding.  It turns out it's just a pudding with eyeball and finger.  
---
Too manly 
---
Ikr? Who the heck plays trapper nowadays
---
Of course he has a ded'ard perk. Else it wouldn't be tru3
---
On low lvl you find most the fcampers . anything loweer than 16 you wont have a good team so killers get away with facecamping.
---
All you need to do is going up the ranks dor less facecamping. Then comes the moris and the pink addons XD
---
You need to be more careful till you like 13-15 lvl.
---
No.
---
Sandbaggers and their ilk. You throw down a pallet in front of your teammate or self-care so long they just die on hook, you're going in the pit, buddy.
---
Thats creepy AF
---
I don't know why he posted the meme, but whatever reasons for it, it doesnt change that the sub is very biased towards negativity.
---
I had so many free kills on this type of survivor. Some gets too cocky and end up on a hook
---

School of Rock was such a great movie to me. I generally really enjoyed Jack Black movies as a teenager.

I loathe the doctor. It's so annoying screaming every few seconds and is unavoidable. All he has to do is walk around in treatment mode and if you're not in a locker you'll go crazy...and you'll reach madness 3. The frames are already dead on console but he takes that big stick and continues to beat at them. It's just no fun. One of the most interesting ways to okay survivor is to hide. I always get a rush when I'm right next to the killer and they check every spot except mine and finally leave. With the doctor you don't get that. It's just screaming and messed up skill checks. I won't say that it doesn't take skill to play as the doctor but I think he's definitely easier to play than most. I love going against a good trapper because it's always a mind game. Is this pallet going to be trapped? Is he herding me towards this window? I actually feel like I'm trying to outwit a killer and use strategy to survive instead of loops.
---
Ooh not your art Xd its really good. Just the ingame model feels wierd and i even have green hair so its not thw color.
---
Im about to try do some art too cuz nea my new main XD
---
Okay? Thank you? 
---
If that‚Äôs your point you should probably comment separately instead of in the middle of an argument (which it may be important to point out, OP started) 
---
Break my totem? That's a paddlin'
---
Sell out your teammates? That's a paddlin'
---
Its up to who i feel deserves it more, tbh
---
Ah so you‚Äôre one of the sensitive killers because those things are all avoidable and punishable 
---
This might sound petty this soumds but the first survivor i catch mean-mugging (staring idle in the open) after i hook his boi is getting Mori'd. Challenge accepted Nea.
---
Pretty funny. Please brush up your English.
---
xD good luck with your art )
---
actually, I'm a killer main.  I play survivor but I have more fun with killer.  I have Bloody Feng as a user flair because she's my favourite survivor.  Doctor is my favourite killer, even though it gets a bit harder to play him with good survivors &gt;:(
---
If No one opinions matter but my own, why arent you telling killers to consider it a win if they get 0 kills?  If the killers' standards for victory are all that matters, why wouldn't you consider it a killer's win if they get 0 kills but they mentally consider it a win?  Basically, if the killer's standards are all that matters, why is it an issue that I, as the killer, consider anything less than a 4k a loss?
---
&gt;Me and **my group** have a rule that if **we** see 1 hit hatchets, we DC.
---
Plays swf and complains about imbalance, lmao.

You bet I'm gonna enjoy watching you slowly die. I don't even care about points at that point, I'm just glad to be rid of you and your flashlight, Claudette

You can body block while cloaked, so put yourself where you don't want the survivor to go 
---
Can't wait for dedicated servers!

Lol

What‚Äôs up your ass? lol seem kinda defensive about this

I fell for it.

THAT'S REALLY, REALLY STUPID. BUT THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME.

A very sharp thumb.

Who's worse the furby or the guy who tore it off o.O
---
Also rank 1 Myers main, I don't have ruin and still get at least 3 kills before they get the gates powered. Ruin as as much as a necessity as people say it is.
---
NOED is a crutch perk and isnt comparable at all to flashlights. You get flashlight blinded and...you follow them with sound and get your hit on them. Flashlight blinding at pallets is the worst way to use a flashlight
---
IMO bond over empathy, but personal preference. With the state of healing I don‚Äôt think self care is necessary (especially if you run bond;)). And I don‚Äôt think exhaustion perks are super meta anymore since the exhaustion changes but that‚Äôs just me. My god build is currently bond, adrenaline, BT, then honestly whatever 4th you choose. Mine goes from leader, to Unbreakable, resilience, WGLF. It honestly always changes but whatever you find comfortable 
---
Damn, that one is double good. Good placement and can't be seen. Expected, but not seen.

I HATE CAMPING LFS BUT BOY ITS FUN TO RUN LFS AROUND AND THEY GET THEIR CHAINSAW CAUGHT IN SOME OBSTACLE

I think if you with a SWYF and 2 randoms it may be better than bond
---
Looks good :)

Probable Unpopular Opinion; I'm okay with this. When I was in middle school, all the edgy/goth kids would clip their nails into points like this.

IT'S COOL, BUT NOT REALLY STUPID. I MEAN, THE TWO PRETTY MUCH DO THE SAME THING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, SO IT MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
---
Their code is likely a big mess, and any changes require a disproportionately large investment of time to ensure they aren't actually making things worse. They likely have such an extensive tech debt, that it'll always be like this. At least until they try to revamp the game completely through a sequel, or something.
---
Even then, I have about zero faith their bad coding habits won't rear it's head again.
---
No if someone is trying to Kobe it means the killer is camping 
---
What is this?
---
Slow the game down.... JUST A LIL BIT
---
Paddlin the Badham School canoe? Oh you better believe that's a paddlin'

If Legion was so strong you wouldn't be so defensive about it.

Yea it takes a lot more practice on console but once you get it down it‚Äôs pretty easy

IS IT JUST FUCKING ME OR ARE THE SCRATCHMARKS BROKEN AGAIN, I'LL BE FOLLOWING THEM AROUND A CORNER AND THEN THEY'LL JUST VANISH, SOMETIMES I CAN FIND THEM FURTHER ON IF IM LUCKY OR RUNNING PREDATOR, BUT A MAJORITY OF THE TIME IT LEADS TO ME LOSING THE PERSON.

Well usual toxic behavior; such as sandbagging and helping Killer
---
And because they ‚Äúhelped‚Äù me get kills they expect me to let them win and if i don‚Äôt in end game chat ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a garbage killer‚Äù; ‚Äúwe helped you so you should return the favor‚Äù and ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù

The last one is my most favorite by far

Got em both!

I think it's more that he played it smart. Nothing toxic there.

Depending what killer you play, check out the album The Silver Scream by Ice Nine Kills. The album was written with each song being about a different classic horror film, and there's a few songs that correspond with the licensed killers (Myers, Freddy, Leatherface, Jigsaw (Pig)). It's a super fun album and the lyrics are pretty unique for the genre
---
Never stop your opponent in the middle of a mistake.

But i mean this was a long post ago thanks for the link i‚Äôll make sure to use it in the future

No they camped the others and when i asked him he said they deserved it and he was rank 13

What was Deathgarden?

My two favorite things, this is amazing!

WHEN I PLAY LEATHERFACE, YOU BETTER BELIEVE IM THE NICEST GODDAMN LEATHERFACE YOU EVER DONE SEEN JUST SO I CAN DESTROY THE IDEA THAT CANNIBAL PLAYERS ARE SOULLESS
---
Wait, being a "godlike" survivor is being able to run around a pallet like two or three times throw it down then run to the next one?
---
Survivors can be mediocre and still be able to just throw down the pallet to win.
---
Because survivor is just easy. While killer is just stressful.
---
Honestly as a console peasant, it‚Äôs pretty bad. Before Legion and the event I had had a break from DbD and the first time I loaded in again just looking at the characters blew my mind hole it was so blocky. 
---
Excellent game with top notch style but man the consoles are in effin N64 graphics not to mention Fps issues that make killers pretty sad :(
---
A friend of mine actually thought that the Bloody Party Streamers icon represented a lobster. In her defense, English is not her first language.
---

---
It's more than just a tidying up job and they should probably just redo the game from the ground up. Spaghetti code is a funny way to describe it, but it's how the game is coded, it's a mess, and that's why when they change 1 thing, other completely unrelated things break. 
---
No matter what passive skill they add if survivor sees mori they will dc lol
---
Thx
---
I'm fairly certain they're just trimmed that way for eye gouging edginess
---
Survivors DON'T have it that easy, trust me. It takes just ONE tiny mistake, or lost mindgame to take a hit. After that?
---
Boom. Done
---
Noed. Trash killer. Not impressed. 
---
I mean, both are unlockable with the in-game currency, as is Legion and the new survivor in general. Both are cosmetic-only changes, which you don't even see while playing killer (with the exception of the wrists).  I could get it if you *had* to pay to get the characters, and then *had* to pay for the cosmetics for the other two, and then they played differently, but the devs put in a system where you can get the killer without paying them money (that's how I got it), and also how you get the extra cosmetics without paying them (which is the same for like 75% of the cosmetics for the killers since the store launched), so why you're complaining over the fact that they've got different names is beyond me. They play the same, they're all "Legion", and cosmetics being unlocked through paying or in-game currency is not at all different to any other killer or any survivor. **You are literally bitching about a name** attached in brackets to the name Legion, for a killer that you don't have to pay for and don't have to pay for the change in name. Downvote me if you want, but I'd rather pay 9000 iridescent shards for the killer then another 17800 if I choose to get additional skins than pay real money like we had to do with the other killers before the store.

No he means just repeatly clicking m1 for a short amount of time, but not do the full attempt.

Death Garden should have been DBD 2

True I was being like over-exaggerative he wasn‚Äôt acc toxic. I would have personally saved the totem but that‚Äôs different tactics for diff people I guess

she‚Äôs such a baddie.

SURVIVOR: HAHA I WON NOOB GET WRECK NO 4K FOR YOU.
---
ME: CONGRATS YOU JUMPED OUT THE HATCH AFTER I GAVE IT TO YOU.
---
SURVIVOR: YOU'RE SO BAD HOW ARE YOU RANK 1? THAT WAS SUCH AN EASY ESCAPE GG EZ.
---
ME: AT LEAST YOUR TEAMMATES DIED WITH SOME DIGINITY, YOU JUST RAN AND HID LIKE A BABY, AND YES I GAVE YOU THE HATCH BECAUSE I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO LIKE WALKING/FEEDING THE DOG AND BRUSHING MY TEETH.
---
SURVIVOR: NO YOU'RE JUST MAD YOU DIDN'T GET A 4K, WHATEVER LOSER.

ME: QUITS TO GO BE PRODUCTIVE...

Sounds cool, I'll check it out.

Or it should be comboed with We‚Äôll Make It so the perk does something at least

Fair enough- I still disagree bc I‚Äôm a stubborn shite üòÇ bc their true mistake was not looking around to see the wraith appear

WHEN DID BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS/DOUBLE BLOOD POINTS WEEKENDS BECOME A TRIGGER FOR KILLERS TO USE THE SCUMMIEST TACTICS POSSIBLE? 'OH BOY THANKS FOR GIVING ME MORE POINTS NOW I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET NONE!' SOMETIMES THEY EVEN WIN SO FAST WITH A NURSE OR BILLY NOT EVEN THEY GET POINTS
---
Funnily enough, there are some situations in Friday the 13th and Last Year: The Nightmare where you can loop the killer.   In Last Year, there's a slow killer called the Giant and you can run him around some of the tables in the library. 
---
The other games I've looped successfully in are the old style of survival horror games, Resident Evil and so on, but usually only the weak enemies/AI.
---
Tapp.
---
Could be wrong, but around 170ish?
---
TRIPLE SHITS
---
I play survivor and I‚Äôm not annoyed by it but I took a killer approach of thinking of the fact he could have got plus morte :) in my opinion- see the both polite and heated arguments below
---
I think they're clipped that way so that she can scratch and gouge
---
#justhighschoolthings
---
In their fantasy land where ir's fair, balanced and completely avoidable at all times.
---
I enjoyed all of this
---
HEY, GUESS FUCKING WHAT? IF IT'S THE END OF THE GAME, I HAVE NO KILLS, AND I HOOK YOU LITERALLY NEXT TO THE DOOR? YOU DON'T GET THE RIGHT TO CALL ME A CAMPER. I'M NOT GOING FUCK OFF TO THE OTHER DOOR WHEN I KNOW 100% THERE ARE PEOPLE HIDING NEARBY. I WAS BORN AT NIGHT, I WASNT BORN LAST NIGHT.
---
Yeah we responded to that point dwdw 
---
10 minute run - 1 gen done; the one I finished before the killer started chasing me...
---
Well since there is only one perk you can buy per blood web and there is 3 tiers of all, if I counted properly, 59 perks on survivor it should be 177 blood webs per survivor assuming you can't get the higher tier of a perk without getting the lower ones first. Then getting that to p3 would mean 329 levels on a survivor for each perk at p3. I may have miscounted but this should be accurate.
---
And for Killers there is 54 perks, assuming I can count again, so 162. Then getting to p3 is 312.
---
Getting this done on all Killers and survivors is around, I believe 12,179 bloodwebs. Assuming I did all my maths right. Probably not for this last part.
---
Iron will &gt; self care imo
---
And then you hit your decisive, or deliverance, or get flashlight or pallet saved, or borrowed time saved, or just be on your FIRST HOOK.
---
Of course you get punished for a mistake, you still have like, eight billion chances.
---
Trust me, I'm a survivor main, it's easy.
---
Heck, I couldn't see it as anything but a weird flex (but ok) until you said what it's supposed to look like.
---
I did see them, I was kind of saying this after seeing people over react about it. I don‚Äôt think this counts as toxic or camping at all so I was trying to make OP feel better after people attacked them lol
---
you did good , other guy is being a douche lmao
---
how didn‚Äôt he deserve that lmao 
---
Wasn‚Äôt this posted yesterday?
---
I know No0b3 but not that guy. Guessing he's similar. 
---
Yee I do feel bad bc IK I can come across as like, crude when I‚Äôm tryna be ironic and sarcastic, it‚Äôs a lot easier to express my actual feeling in verbal words rather than text üòÖüòÖ
---
I do kind of agree with you there; I don‚Äôt usually run it except for this toxic hag build. At that point in the game I wanted to use it to stop the hatch stand off if I could
---
Yeah but youtube terminated my account for some reason so I'm just reuploaded it to my main account rather than go through the hassle of creating another one. The exact same video though!
---
Well it'll still be like 600k-1m blood points to get all the teachables per character. So that's like 8-9 survivors the 9th is Bill on pc, so don't count that if you don't play on pc. Either way it's definitely a hell of a lot of work.
---
THERE‚ÄôS A GODDAMN GLITCH WHERE THE SNAP OUT OF IT SKILL CHECK DOESN‚ÄôT APPEAR SO IF EVERYONE HITS MADNESS 3 KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE

It's a killer album

Next update gives Nea a 5m terror radius
---
I mean if multiple gens got done while he/she was waiting then they just played themselves and they‚Äôll learn from it

I was just thinking this earlier. My friend thought I was the killer in a match and I basically spent the whole time terrorizing him.

Yeah that‚Äôs what I was saying- like there‚Äôs nought wrong with it it just COULD have made a disadvantage for the killer bc every second counts

I hate it.. she looks like fucking reincarnation of michael jackson who came back to kill some people.

FUCK THESE SHITTY FACE CAMPING TUNNELING HOES THAT THINK THEYRE SO GOOD WHEN THEY CAN ONLY GET KILLS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYNA SAVE BEFORE HE GETS DISTRACTED

FUCK ALL THESE GOD DAMN HUNTRESS MAINS THEYRE SO FUCKNIG STUPID  CANT HIT A FUCKING HATCH THROW TILL SURVIVOR IS .1 INCHES AWAY FROM THEIR FACE 
---
BILLY IS A NO SKILL KILLER
---
Damn man sorry to hear, did you send a message back asking why? 
---
Maybe for someone like you, in the top 1%.
---
But the 99%, who can't hit/don't use DS or Deliverance, who can't be saved by Glitched Time, or who can't use those flashlights for shit, Survivor dies 7/10 times.
---
I plan on using my first one ever one day soon. Lucky enough to get it from a gift and it‚Äôs a mission for Leatherface as well I got. Only been playing a few days tho so I won‚Äôt be OP with it lol
---
Why even bother wiggling after all that bullshit. My controller would be on the floor while I contemplate life.
---
When he was doing the gen you could have hit him and teleported down to one of your traps though. 
---
THIS HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY AND EVERY GAME IS WAS LEATHERDADDY I HATE THIS BULLSHIT
---
Dwight
---
The game just naturally goes fast in the beginning and slower towards the end. In the beginning, all survivors are healthy and there are a shopping seven possible places for someone to work. 
---
Towards the end, some people should be injured, hooked or even better, sacrificed. And there are only so many places to work. 
---
Wait, is Sloppy Butcher bugged on Wraith? I just started playing that Killer, so I wouldn't know.
---
Waiting so long for it when he already had a 3k and the Bill made it that far. 
---
I wish more people were smart like you.

ITS VERY FUCKING ANNOYING L2P YOU TRASH FUCKING KILLER YOU GOTTA BE A CAMPY WAMPY BABY
---
I‚Äòm only missing 2 1/2 survivors so almost there I guess :D
---
What did you say?
---
there's no point to be honest, they terminated my account with no warning. Not gonna dispute it as a 0 sub 10 view youtuber that just started, when I already have another youtube channel. If this one gets terminated then I will fight it but I'm not too mad about it
---
VERY FULL OF SALT AS YOU CAN TELL
---
I'm on right now and it says it ends in 18 hours
---
It definitely counts considering he still counts games as a loss when killers face camp and get laggy hits through objects. 
---
Not facecamped but made equip an ebony mori the next time i saw them, dude was in swf group and literally everything i did ended with firecrackers in my face or a flashlight aimed at me
---
Let's say i run a pizza shop and advertise a meal deal that comes with pizza, garlic bread, salad and a drink. You pay 20 bucks for it and when it arrives you only get the salad and drink and i tell you you need to pay an extra $10 for the rest. You'd be understandably upset. It may only be cosmetic, but Legion being 4-1 was still a driving force in the advertesmant of the dlc and i guarantee you why a lot of people bought it.
---
Devnia
---
Spirit and Legion have me legitmately worried about the Freddy rework. For all his faults he is still a lot of fun to play most of the time and just needs a few tweaks to make him mid or even high tier. I'd personally like it if survivors either receive 0% action speed during the transition or instantly fall asleep if they do an interaction during the transition. That way you don't need to helplessly watch for 7 seconds as they finish the gen, totem, or gate.
---
I mean, I've won a 2v1 versus a killer so yes you can, depends on killer skill and coordination
---
Gotta toughen that heart mate. Soon, you will feel nothing from hearing the screams of the poor souls who cross your path. May the Entity give us strength when that day arrives.
---
/r/iamverybadass 
---
Yeah, the same frame rate drops also happen the first time I'm about to connect my hit with a survivor. I know it soulds like a sad excuse, but I swear, the first swing of the match, I see what I know trough experience is going to be a hit, then the game pauses for like 1/3 of a second or something and then I see I either swung the air or hit a wall. It's like a free deadhard for survivors.
---
It's only the first swing of the match (I tried swinging right when I spawn and nothing happens, and later when I am about to hit a survivor it happens again) combine this with the first bloodlust of the match giving me the same issue and you got yourself 2 extra survivor lives.
---
I feel your pain. I need to mori someone for a daily and it‚Äôs just been sitting there for the last few days. Maybe after the event is over I‚Äôll finally go for it without feeling like a massive jerk. 
---
Enjoy spending 80 hours to grind the shards you need for a single outfit.
---
Isn't that the "music" option in the settings?
---
I had several games yesterday where Hillbilly game running at me while doing gens and I didn‚Äôt hear the chainsaw until a second before he was right in my face. 
---
hahaha funny joke.
---
it doesn't nerf freddy.
---
You dont have any addons
---
Quentin him or jake 
---
Saying the new killers haven't been good/fun to play against from a survivor perspective, I think.
---
 I somewhat agree. Spirit is genuinely scary. But Clown isn't really that strong. Pig is also pretty weak, but can startle you. 
---
Legion in particular is laughably bad for the game, though. Even with Nurse you have some opportunity to counterplay by breaking LOS or changing direction when she teleports.. Legion? Nothing. No countering them when they find you. 
---
Which he did, then immediately got hit with noed. You just proved my point that he deserved to escape. 
---
Boi look at Pigs nails. 
---
And if you aren't good, it doesn't matter how many chances you have, you WILL go down.
---
I play with a few friends who, daily, ALWAYS die more than they live. Killers are OP, except against people BETTER than them. And I'll tell you something, I'm a DAMN good Wraith. Always get at least 2/3 kills, with the 4th happening semi regularly.
---
Remember, the devs want the game balanced around 2 kills 2 escapes every match.
---
Getting 3 kills is considered a win for killers, while a 4k means they pulled a perfect game.
---

jOhN jOhN's WaCkY jOuRnEy?!
---
Isn't the whole point of the exclusively cosmetics with auric cells to do with them being able to continue paying licensing fees and continue to support the game? 
---
It's not like BeHaviour are money hoarders like EA games. By having a cosmetic shop that isn't a necessity for the games experience, but more for your enjoyment with it, I can be happy knowing that my money for certain skins and what not goes onto further the game.
---
Some weird drive to never give up? I dunno. 
---
Except it does.
---
Now i'm picturing the wraith spending his time outside of games collecting and smelling pretty flowers :3
---
It would be cool to get a nature man skin with flowers growing on him, since he already looks like a tree.
---
You leave? 
---
If the player chooses to stay, that‚Äôs on her.
---
She might also be waiting for others to leave so the hatch can open.
---
Nurse is good, I don't think Nurse ever deserves a nerf. 
---
75% survivor 25% killer. play swf a lot with the wife, and as much as I enjoy killer console can be hell and not that great at killer. Either I find someone in the first minute and snow ball (maybe 1/20 killer games) or I 2k.
---
I am currently thinking about commissioning, but I decided that I should improve upon my art first before selling my works. But, I am drawing Feng right now (on my own lol) and will be more than happy to accept your commissions in the future!
---
Ya edgy is kinda our thing
---
Everyone else left and I‚Äôm the killer 
---
Well if they were to do an "operation health" thing. They would have to make the game even worse like ubisoft 
---
Could ya tag me if you decide to post the Feng? I‚Äôd love to see it
---
Man i hate hearing killers doing this im normally running puddings or bps...or some blood point increases i dont get what the hell is with people using all their moris
---
The Pudding one is creative.

The trick i find is to make your frenzy last as long as possible, if you stab someone and theres no heartbeats, instead of stabbing them again, leave them and run toward the center of the map until you see someone. Repeat this over and over and its basically impossible to not max deviousness.
---
You can't jump of your second hook (struggle stage) ....
---
What's a Console Player?
---
So I am new to the game but have found I enjoy Killer more than survivor. 
---
What is the best strategy for the hatch? Stay close but not right on top of it? Like you said, if you camp too hard they can just repair more generators. 
---
So far I have only stopped 1 of 5 people when it comes down to 1 survivor, multiple gens and hatch open. 
---
Hahahaha, which is it? Is he a trash killer, or does he take no skill?
---
THE PLANNING A ROUTE MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. EVERY TIME I DO A GEN NOW I LOOK AROUND FOR WINDOWS AND PALETTES, SO IF I GET CHASED, I'M RUNNING WITH A PURPOSE. 
---
I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT FOLOWING THE CROWD.
---
That would work for Senzu lol
---
YEAH LIKE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THE BEST ADDONS/ITEMS AND OFFERINGS, GO AHEAD. BUT ACTING LIKE YOU'RE HOT SHIT BECAUSE YOU HAD 600 GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARDS ON YOU AIN'T THE DEAL.
---
I use my palm too, but you really don't have to grind or rotate it, just gently go from side to side. Maybe look into some stick covers or extenders, I have them on mine due to trigger thumb and they raise the stick height a little and give a better grip.
---
Am rank 9 and getting atleast two people with rank 2 and teabagging me in every pallet.
---
Such lovely sentiment, remember fellow souls of the damned the entity has blessed us, and no amount of Sarah Mclachlan music can save the fools trapped here with us.
---
I agree, they had a neat opportunity to make some cool powers with a killer that was four different people. I personally would have loved if each teen had a different power, instead of each teen being just a cosmetic.
---
For me it‚Äôs A to struggle ? It was like that default 
---
I LOVE PLAYING AS ADAM BUT WHEN HE GETS HOOKED HIS SCREAM HURTS MY EARS. HIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES!
---
Ohhhh, the good old days of infinite loops and 1-minute-wins. I remember when they patches the boards onto the windows and i was so excited. I still remember the old barn one.
---
I MEAN, I'VE HEARD THAT IT FUNCTIONS AS A WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM DCING EVERY TIME A GAME GOES BAD, BECAUSE THERE'S A CHANCE TO GET OUT. BUT THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING TO FIX STANDOFFS.
---
How about iron maiden as a hotdog with mustard on it?
---
Why.
---
I'm personally of the opinion that if I start a game, I finish it, even if it goes badly for me, because it's just a game and sometimes people outplay me. It happens. I'm not going to screw all the other players over by ditching them before the gens are finished. 
---
IM A BIT LATE TO THE PARTY BUT I THINK I STILL WANNA JOIN IN IF THATS OKAY.  
---
I STARTED PLAYING JUST OVER A MONTH AGO AND IM ALREADY RANK 3 ON SURVIVOR AND RANK 8 ON KILLER. I DONT QUITE KNOW IF IM HAPPIER OR SADDER BEING AT HIGH RANKS BECAUSE YOUR TEAMMATES ARE BETTER AND THE GAME IS EXCITING, BUT THEN YOU PLAY KILLER AND YOU REALIZE NONE OF THESE ASSHOLES DESERVE ANYTHING FROM YOU. I WAS IN A GAME AND THE DAVID HUNG OUT DISABLING AND SABOTAGING EVERY SINGLE TRAP HE COULD FIND AS THE LAST ONE, JUST TO GET MY ATTENTION SO I COULD SEE HIM JUMP IN HATCH. I FARMED TRAPS FOR 2 MINUTES JUST TO NOT GIVE HIM THE SATISFACTION AND HE WAITED AROUND, WOULD MAKE ME STEP ON MY OWN TRAPS TOO.  
---
I HATE FREDDY, I HATE MYERS, I HATE BILLY, I HATE SWEAT NURSE, I HATE FARMING DOCTORS AND I HATE LEATHERFACE, THE FUCKING PRICK, BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY KILLER MAINS DO IT, PLAYING KILLER IS THE MOST INFURIATING THING I HAVE EVER DONE. IN. MY. FUCKING. LIFE!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
YOU PLAY THIS GAME FOR 1 OF 2 OUTCOMES: FUN, WHICH LEADS TO BEING A DICK INEVEITABLY, AND YOU END UP PLAYING JUST TO PISS PEOPLE OFF. OR 2: YOU PLAY FOR THE POINTS WHICH LEAD DOWN THAT SAME FUCKING ROAD, BUT ATLEAST THAT GUY WANTS THE ESCAPE POINTS.
---
THE GAME WAS A LOT MORE FUN WHEN I SUCKED, BECAUSE CHANCES WERE OTHER PEOPLE SUCKED TOO, AND ITS INFURIATING WHEN YOU GET CUCKED BY THE DESIGN OF THE GAME! ''OH, LOCKED IN THAT ANIMATION!'' ''CANT GO THROUGH HERE BECAUSE YOURE TOO FAT!'' ''CANT BREAK THIS PALLET BECAUSE SABOTAGE DAVID IS CROUCHING BEHIND YOU, ALSO, NEA HAD A FLASHLIGHT SO WHEN HES DONE THE DEED YOURE STILL GETTING PALLET FLASHED''
---
THE GAME IS LOVELY AND EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND SPECIAL DUE TO ITS INHERENT SIMPLICITY, BECAUSE YOU CAN STILL GO FROM THIS BULLSHIT TO GETTING A 3K FROM NOWHERE BECAUSE REVERSE BEARTRAP SAYS FUCK YOU. NO LEAVE, TIME TO HARVEST YOUR HARD WORK, TO WHICH I CAN FINISH WITH: FUCK. SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS, YOU GUYS ARE DICKS AND I BROUGHT A PARTY STREAMER, YET YOU STILL CRY FOUL WHEN I GET MY ONE?
---
Depends on how you play, honestly. 
---
I want to be a survivor main, but I end up playing a shitload of killer because the bloodpoint gains are so much better, so much easier, and so much less dependent on things you have absolutely no control over (like how often your teammates get hooked, whether or not the killer happens to find you first, etc).  A mediocre survivor round gets you 10-12,000 points, whereas even if I get absolutely stomped to shit and back as a killer I pretty much have to try to get anything less than 16,000 and it‚Äôs easy to maintain a steady 22,000 every round whereas that would be considered a damn good or damn long round as Survivor.
---
And Nurse is unplayable on every map now on console. Horrendous FPS, i can‚Äôt believe they havent done shit about it for almsost 1.5 years. My fucking god, i can feel i‚Äôve slowly turned away from this game, havent got shards in months... FIX IT, or console DBD will die!!!
---
lmao yeah, i dont care about kills as legion, legions purely a bp farmer for me.
---
IT HELPS TO SPEND THE FIRST 10-15 SECONDS HIDING OR DO A TOTEM OR CHEST OR SOMETHING, JUST TO LET THEM LEAVE THE AREA. 
---
Agree completely- just curious which different builds people have found which turn out to be effective.
---
Yeah, and I used to be able to just back up and see them in the locker. Now Freddy can't even do that.
---
To me, there's a difference between it going badly and a killer who is going out of their way to cheat the game. There's no point in staying in a game if I'm on my third hook and I'm getting tunneled into a basement where I know the killer is just gonna cheese the entry. 
---
I started as a killer main but it felt like too much pressure having to catch everybody or else piss off the entity so I mostly play survivor with a couple friends of mine.
---
Eh so things go bad, just get into a new game, the match making is so quick that it dosent matter.
---
I mean it isn't like it's mandatory to run Mori's. I'm getting a dozen styptics and gen-rushing toolboxes, but I don't run 1 every single game.
---
Yeah you can change it on PS4, I‚Äôm assuming the same is for Xbox 
---
FREDDY IS SHITTY AT HIGH RANKS BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN LOOP RELATIVELY WELL, SO IT'S EASY TO STALL FOR TIME. YOU CAN'T REALLY STEALTH AGAINST HIM AND PEOPLE AT LOWER RANKS AREN'T AS GOOD AT LOOPING SO HE WORKS BETTER THERE. GETTING BETTER AT THE GAME IN GENERAL WILL HELP YOU AGAINST FREDDY, BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE IN THE DREAM WORLD THE CHASE IS THE SAME.
---
Shrouds in general are bad. If I'm killer and a secret item is in play, I just go to the furthest generator. Sure enough there's 1-3 survivors who get interrupted and now they're making no progress.
---
My opinion is that in the situation you described above you played poorly, got caught out of position, and rage quit. 
---
If the killer blocked you in and afk‚Äôed, that‚Äôs different, but if they were still trying to kill you then it‚Äôs you who should be reported and not earn points, as you didn‚Äôt for leaving. 
---
Monto did a blindfolded video at some point.  Kind of surprised he got as far as he did. 
---
I'd agree but I end up waiting on the lobby for half an hour. 
---
How is it cheating? That's the map. You didn't have to run down there. If you did, it's on you for making a bad choice in game. Nothing personal here, but I think some folks take games way too seriously to enjoy them in the spirit they're meant to be played.
---
Why you bully my Nea, sure she threw down that god pallet in front of you as Myers popped his tombstone, maybe even "accidentally" stood in that pallet when that clown lunged behind you. But, yeah maybe..
---
:)
---
THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE TO STOP STANDOFFS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT, BUT IF THEY'RE BOTH THERE EITHER THE SURVIVOR SHOULD WIN OR THE KILLER WINS, NOT WHOEVER MOVES LAST.
---
If you paid attention to their very clear wording, you'll notice it didn't say anything about them being free, just playable by picking their cosmetic (Its not that hard to understand). If you really don't want to spend any money, you can unlock both with shards. And since when is being "Positive" looked at as "naive and sad", I'd say the naive thing to in this situation is to complain about not getting free stuff rather than accepting that designing a game doesn't come free.
---
He means from the killers grasp, not struggling on phase 2 hook. 
---
Give em a glock, but in all honestly they could teeter into being trash below freddie or being too good too easily. Its going to be rough for them.
---
No, no, I'm not taking it too seriously. I just get kinda pissed when it happens every game. I love this game, and I have a lot of fun on it, I just get tired of people doing toxic shit, I mean, killers and survivors. It's supposed to be fun, it's a lot less fun for people when the killer is just face camping and doing that stuff. 
---
With my (mid-teir) experience, people do tend to heal and especially with jeffs, it SHREDS distorion.
---
^the one who makes me wait to the 5 second mark because they didn't ready up, I'm IMPATIENT! 
---
The fact that you need it at all means you're a trash killer
---
I don't think I've gone against anyone actually using iron maiden. I've seen discordance multiple times and mad grit on a trapper, but never iron maiden.
---
that sucks, I usualy instantly get into a fresh game as surivor. Its playing Killer where you can get the game held up by survivors and you get stuck with it.
---
Oh yeah, that game ended in 5 minutes for me.
---
Yes, but to a lot of people Moris are fun to use. And since they get bombed with them that is what happens. Gifts shouldn't be that likely to give Moris.
---
The trials will be less like a horror movie and more like Home Alone
---
If they where to not release anything new for 6 months the game would lose a lot of its playerbase. 
---
We all can say ‚ÄúUbisoft did the same why can‚Äôt bhvr do it????!!??!1‚Äù but we never think about how big the difference is between Ubisoft and bhvr are massive not only in teams but in the playerbase as well. 
---
Dbd is at a critical point now because if it where not to release new content for 6 months which could even be longer judging by how bhvr does things that would certainly kill the game. 
---
Thats pretty bogus, Rank 1 survivor here and fail to see how putting you on a timer for 1 hit is fun or engaging.
---
This is just part of the reason why Deliverance is more trouble than it's worth.
---
**COUGH SURVEILLANCE**
---
I don't have a problem with it most people either hit it side to side or rotate it to hard their is a set max speed for which you can wiggle and you don't need to do it that hard just use your thumb and do it lightly.
---
But hook patrolling is fine because you‚Äôre supposed to gate one hooked, the three hook thing is just a lie.
---
feng, claudette, or jake for me uwu
---
Ruin, enduring, spirit fury, and a perk that gives you info. Maybe barbecue or nurses calling? 
---
Clown:
---
Coulrophobia 
---
Distressing 
---
Whispers
---
Bitter Murmur 
---
Add-ons
---
Solvent Jug
---
Chloroform Bottle 
---
Pretty straightforward build for a newer player to get hooks, find survivors, and drain survivor items. All these perks are achievable without maxing any other killer (But Coulrophobia is a Clown perk). The Solvent Jug stops the survivors from using perks like sprint burst and dead hard.
---
This is my personal favorite build, I will add more when I get home from work. I have a legion build, but because of their current state, I would not suggest using him. 
---
I feel the same way. I'm a rank 11 myers main and a rank 10 Ace main, and I love the game, and play it all the time, even though I got spiderman and red dead for Christmas. 
---
I have a regular PS4, and the optimization helped very slightly for survivors for me, but a few weeks after that, it started to slow down again. 
---
I love playing killer, but with my problems I mentioned above, it can be tough to play, especially with the lag from bloodlust. My main concerns will be fixed with practice though, so I shouldn't worry that much. My only complain is the slow frames at times, and lag spikes that can ruin chases.
---
Once again, I love the game so much, and I don't see that I'm going to stop playing any time soon.
---
Meta perks. Enduring, Spirit Fury. Spirit fury is one of the best perks (ran with enduring) any killer could use.
---
Also try expanding your killers, it can get boring playing the same one over and over and you might find a killer you like more! Also not to be rude I love Bing Bong Boy but (x4B) he is low tier as far as killers go, the strongest killers are the ones whose powers allow you to end chases quicker. The wraiths speed boost is great and all but that time wasted uncloaking a lot of the time would be the same time it would have taken clown/trapper/billy etc. To run them down and hit them, on top of having other abilities that assist in ending a chase sooner. But if Bing Bong Boy is where the heart is than ring their death bell for the Entity!
---
Nice costume and nice photos!
---
Another bug: I played against a lvl one ruin today, it was obviously green but all of us had the ruin. We even asked the killer later if it was really level one or not, he said it was and we literally all had it. Lol 
---
iron maiden and rancor are spine chill was a typo I meant bitter murmer
---
Like others have noted, this is a cool concept but it‚Äôs clearly unbalanced. Even without playtesting his kit would make him the most powerful killer in the game, with few options for counterplay from Survivors. 
---
Jason‚Äôs power is broken as presented. The ability to turn on Spirit Fury at will with a speed boost is far too strong. There aren‚Äôt many dials you can tweak to make this power work, in my opinion. While it‚Äôs very true to Jason‚Äôs horror flavor, it offers no hope to Survivors being chased. This power needs a complete overhaul. 
---
Speed of 4.6 meters per second with terror radius of 20 meters is a strong combo. I can‚Äôt think of a real reason to give him such a small TR. Of course this all really depends on how the killer power works, but this gives him absurd ambush ability. With Monitor and Abuse he gets close to Michael Myers territory. Unless he‚Äôs supposed to be an ambush killer, and your power suggests he isn‚Äôt, he should probably have a bigger TR. 
---
Your perks are interesting, but they feel like they‚Äôre missing something. 
---
The first perk will essentially never proc as constructed, so it doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
The second one has promise, but right now I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs combatting or enhancing and it kinda seems like a feel-bad perk. Remember that Exposed is an extremely debilitating status effect so you probably should have to work harder as a killer to get it. 
---
I like the third perk, but there should be some kind of time limit on the debuff. You don‚Äôt want to go too far to disincentivize altruism in survivors. Making a perk that says ‚Äúhealing is bad‚Äù is risky. 
---
Also no idea why Jason can teleport and walk through pallets. Seems like overkill. How do you choose one power over the other? Teleport cool down is also far too short; survivors won‚Äôt be able to finish gens in the endgame. 
---
Interesting concept overall, but flawed. I like the idea of a killer who gets stronger as the match goes on. 
---
Spirit with Remember Me, Bitter Murmur, Whispers, and Unrelenting. I make sure not to let any chase last long at all, and patrol gens pretty often. I also avoid hooking the obsession at first so I can easily find them and get more hits in to make the exit gates a pain in the ass later. Matches usually end in me slugging and using Whispers to find the poor thing that tries to hide by hatch.
---
Might switch Unrelenting with Thanatophobia or Ruin though. Only had Unrelenting there from when I was getting used to her katana.
---
Sure but if you do that solo you spend the whole match doing totems and then your team might not even make it through the gen phase.
---
Most of the people using the terms never experienced the actual loops and are complaining while playing the easy days.
---
I see some potential 
---
you just gotta do more videos, the more you do the better you'll become
---
Here is some feedback:
---
-Try to rotate the legion mask(in the meme clips) of where the character is facing
---
-That tumbnail needs to be improved, try making it relatable with the video, since a galaxy doesn't have much to do with dbd and the title font is boring and plain
---
-Don't bother showing the whole end screen, if you wanna show oof thoose red embles, crop and zoom in the emblems, it's way more interesting that looking at the whole screen.
---
-Sometimes the cuts are too fast, for example when hooking a survivor it's better to change the survivor but keep the same hook animation instead of repeating the same stage of hooking a diferente survivor each time
---
Anyways hope this helps and keep making videos!
---
"But I play their game I'm entitled to all future content free of charge!" Its just cosmetics people, as killer you don't even see it in game, granted I still buy/grind killer cosmetics despite this but that's a personal choice on how I waste my money.
---
Pretty sure that song came on xD 
---
Can I pick Dwight with no perks instead he is a sexy man and I don't need no perks
---
Legion completely ignores the chase mechanics of this game like Nurse. Wait a week after the buffs go live (yes they arr actually buffing Legion...buffing their tunneling potential lmaoh and people will realize how badly they fucked up with Legion.
---
My second regret is not adding smol bubba
---
I was having a bad enough time with the group because it was a High Rank SWF with low ranks and I barely got anyone and when I finally did I got cheated out of a hook because the fucking game broke and the animatino didn't fully happen and the fucker got away.
---
Yea likely a speed hacker
---
Here‚Äôs a video I remember watching with a hacker: https://youtu.be/7vNHvxsQM8E
---
That youtuber also has a couple other games he played with hackers... check those for examples 
---
Pretty sure you can win the stand-off versus Clown if you jump as soon as he starts to throw a bottle.
---
Every time I've tried it it worked. Make sure he just reloaded though so he doesn't bait the reload into grab. (Jump as soon as you see an animation change after reload).
---
Seems like until the end of the animation, the survivor is simply treated as "dying," rather than in the hands of the killer. There are a lot of weird interactions with pick up animations, like the timing required for a pallet stun or blind to drop the survivor.
---
But yeah, it's clearly unintentional.
---
*hugs* you‚Äôre okay now. You‚Äôll get it next time its just faulty game mechanics hopefully dedicated servers come through.
---
I did get the Doctor recently, so Moniter/Abuse and Overcharged are on my radar for teachables. Thanks!
---
BUT AT LEAST YOU‚ÄôLL DIE LOOKING SICKENING.
---
EXACTLY I'M LIKE SUPER ENJOYING IT I'M RUNNING BLOODY TORSO AND PANTS AND SOME HOT ASS GREEN HAIR LIKE I'LL BE A MODEL ON THAT HOOK WHAT'S UP 
---
yeah.. I can't believe they force me to buy cosmetics.. I hope those greedy cocksuckers aren't waiting for me when I get home to force me to buy more skins, I've got bills to pay and food to buy!! 
---
I'm actually retiring from the game. That was the final straw. Not only did one of my other "Good" posts get shat on with toxic members on this reddit, that glitch was just the final straw. 
---
Probably third of fourth best killer in the game. Still unsure if I‚Äôd put clown above her 
---
Fam. Do you hear that cute stun noise. What more of a reason do you need. 
---
You‚Äôll be back you just need to cool off.
---
2 is ok but 3-4 I remember I have to use perks for my intel and they don‚Äôt 
---
David firstly because he's my husband and secondly because dead hard is one of my favorite perks. WGLF ain't so bad either.
---
Damn it, I can't argue with that, guess this post is no longer usefull now...
---
NoED should just be a 26/28/30 percent speed boost. No Exposed stat.
---
Decisive Strike should be the same, but survivor gets Broken for 35/30/25 seconds.
---
Aftercare, haven't personally run it but many Ive played with have and being able to see others across the map has been great. Really good for getting information on what's going on.
---
That physically hurts me.
---
Thanks can‚Äôt wait to buy the new nea skin

Lul! From what I read it sounds legit though I sadly haven‚Äôt seen much of the saw series so my input isn‚Äôt the best. I should go watch them!

---
Wow, me too. Guess we just get into it.
---
Well honestly this event and the current bloodwebs have made the game really toxic for both survivors and killers I was frustrated with the game a couple of days ago but I love DBD and you can‚Äôt escape the entity buddy. You just need a break from it to get your mentality in place. Vent all you need!

---
Go for Barbeque. The next level of ruin will probably show up again in the next few webs, but there‚Äôs no guarantee that BBQ will show up again anytime soon. 
---
But you can cleanse totems /s
---
She‚Äôs like a mix between the Wraith and the Nurse. All the best elements of the Nurse with some Wraith hinderances thrown in (e.g limited physical movement, limited use of their power, survivor counterplay). 
---
I‚Äôd place her in third spot, purely because in terms of potential, she has the slightest edge over Huntress, but it‚Äôs a tough judgement to make. Nurse, Hillbilly, Spirit and Huntress are the best killers currently, IMO. 
---
Wow. Are tou playing on PC or console? Because on PC, I'm sure Huntress, Hillbilly and Nurse would take the Top 3. I just feel like The Spirit is a weaker Nurse, or a worse Wraith. The Spirit can become invisible and walk faster, but so can The Wraith (albeit partially) and without all of Rin's cons like not being able to see the Survivors or the blood trails without add-ons. Besides, The Spirit can't one-hit down like Hillbilly, warp through walls like Nurse, range attack like Huntress or slow survivors down like the Clown. It's almost like she relies more on the player's ability than on the her own abilities/powers.
---
They won't ever remove any perks anyway. Thus the only "plausible" thing is reworks of perks. 
---
Im a survivor main but these 2bps have made being a survivor and getting bps really hard. I decided to play killer and it does seem there a hit or miss. I had one spawn in the middle of an open field on Crotus Prenn it was a feels bad. 
---
I mean not really, unless you're trophy/achievement hunting, you actively get less BP and it's a lot harder to pip.
---
If that is the case you can add ME, I'm tired of feeling forced to play billy over my fav killer (trapper), and feeling crushed when i see 3 swf tea bag me at the gate, after doing everything the OP said in his request. I only run mori when I know the team is swf, not to be toxic, but to be at least semi fair xD
---
I‚Äôd say pretend you are phasing, so they start walking and you can catch up. I don‚Äôt play spirit too much, just telling you what I do when I play survivor against her. She is very tough to master though, almost tougher than the nurse. 
---
I don't play a lot of Killer simply because I prefer playing Survivor, but even though two people have already considered her a mid-high tier killer, she's probably one of the Killers I face the least while playing Survivor (Rank 1). I see a lot of Nurses and Hillbillys, lots of Legions now as well, and even some Wraiths, Cannibals and Huntresses, but the last time I've faced a Spirit must've been over a month ago, and I play DBD on a daily basis 
---
CAPS PLEASE FUCKER HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY
---
Bop bbq for days
---
The point is that if any other killer tunnels, at least the survivor has some form of counterplay. You even have more counterplay against a Nurse than you do with Legion. Its that it doesnt matter how good you are as a survivor or as a killer when facing/playing as Legion. Its not rewarding as Survivor or Killer.
---
That makes me feel a bit better. I'm tired of losing track of survivors and taking pallets to the face even in phase mode, but I'll just keep trying to improve. There's nothing more rewarding than stopping in place and seeing the survivor hop over the pallet right towards you :P
---
Operation health is the reason I stopped playing siege. 6 months until new content made me find the game so boring until I couldn‚Äôt play it anymore. If they do that with dead by daylight Im sure it would be the same
---
I see her every now and then but not often. She‚Äôs a hard killer to go against IF they are good at using her. It‚Äôs very hard to read her movements. She‚Äôs a step below Nurse in terms of being able to counter her, but that‚Äôs still a strong position to be in. 
---
Literally sat there for my entire 1st hook. Paging Doctor stupid!
---
If they find all the totems which means taking longer to do the gens. 
---
Send this directly to Mathieu, by pigeon if we have to, until he learns what playing "Fun" killers is like against a 4 man SWF group.   
---
I wanna see his definition of fun after that game.
---
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?!?!!?

1 step matchmaking was legit the only good thing to come from operation health.

Always go for BBQ. The point bonus will get you through to the next Ruin spawn faster. Ruin won't get you to the next BBQ any faster.
---
because he's the King.
---
Don‚Äôt even get into the whole ‚Äúthis sub is ruled by killers/survivor mains‚Äù because it‚Äôs a mixed bag of cancer and man-babies crying over nothing.
---
NOED is a broken perk though and taking the time to find all 5 totems is essentially ruin 2.0. Seriously, the perk is broken as it rewards bad killers and punishes good survivors (the same thing that DS does but the other way around, what a coincidence) 
---
wait a minute...freddy got a kill?
---
I can only play with iron will. I haze jake..
---
dbd is my favorite game and i started playing it back in august
---
never too late to start playing the game, and i'm really happy to see the community grow =)
---
It‚Äôs very hard to win when there‚Äôs a good sfw group

Spirit is A Tier. Nurse &gt; Billy &gt; Spirit. Though, with the right build, Spirit can be better than Billy.

Legion needs to go

Firstly, Amanda did not have a lust for blood, Mark Hoffman did, Mark Hoffman evem admitted to Jigsaw that he did. Amanda did make the games unwinable, but that was because she tought the people in the game weren't worthy of redemption. And you want to know something funny? You can actually win "the game". The beartrap is removable, Mark's games were winable, Amanda's weren't. Also, you seem to think that I said that Jigsaw should be in the game, wich I didn't. I litteraly said that I understood that he wasn't the killer, but Mark Hoffman should have been. I have a feeling you just read the title and maybe the first few lines of text and then commented thinking you knew what I was going to say in the rest of the text
---
Nah then killers wouldn't do anything then just cut ppl off. The game is pretty complex when you first start but you'll get it. Also try playing a combo of survivor and killer. Too many people only focus on one then cant understand both sides. Survivor is more complex and challenging because you need to learn all of the mind games and routes but killer is rewarding too.
---
Oh alright then. I just assumed it was meant to be a trilogy then the producers wanted more money from it so they made more movie. I believe thats what happened with Friday the Thirteenth
---
They called it a cosmetic. They never said you get them all. "In the Chapter:Curtain Call players will be able to choose the Clown as a killer" We had to buy the clown. With either shards or money. Same as these cosmetics.
---
I wonder if that's the same doctor I encountered a few times on that map.  And you're on PS4 too.....
---
WHY DON‚ÄôT WE HAVE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT FUNKO POPS. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM ON MY DESK 
---
I like her Traveller outfit with the skirt and belly ring
---
Or here is an idea: actually have all 4 legion memebers unlocked for everyone and then have cooler skins for each one in the shop. I honestly don't care about cosmetics, but the way they realeased it is just scummy. Also, they don't even have their own voice. The legion was supposed to be 4 killers in 1, not 2 in 1
---
Um... I'm down for an Operation Health... just without the Operation Health...
---
The WGLF one is dead on.
---
I had a spirit carrying me to my final hook and she dropped me to rancor me when the gen finished. I hit the ground and immediately sprinted away
---
 I ended up surviving the match. Shouldn't have been greedy.
---
That is literally not the same thing. Clown is one person and wasnt advertised as a group of 4 different people. They mislead us and just further proves they gave up half way when designing Legion and just pushed it out to sell cosmetics.
---
People with .tv and twitch in their steam names.
---
Implying all Deep Wounds aren't free hits lol
---
Yeah, I have only seen the first 2, but the titles of the other ones really show that they made weird shit happen to continue the story. Also, the 3rd saw movie even ends on a cliffhanger that the 4th movie picks up on. The 4th one is the best one in my opinion
---
Since I play DBD on a joystick (even though I'm on PC), and playing Clown requires a minimally decent aim, I'd probably suck at it, at least in the beginning. I like playing against him because he's definitely counterable, and the slowing down of the gas adds tension to the chase. You always have to be mindful of where you're going if you wanna avoid getting gassed. I wouldn't say the Clown is a top tier killer because he can be countered with certain ease, but he's not a bad killer either. In the end, playing against the Clown is a fun, fair challenge, and that's much better than gen-rushing against poor Freddies or hiding hopelessly against a Nurse.
---
I think I can play Red Dead Redemption 2 or Vermintide and get beautiful 4k and smooth frames,  or I can play Dead by Daylight and it's like playing on a Nintendo 64 with the power of a NES. 
---
She seems to be the one the rights holders want used. She was the antagonist in the PS3 game. Which, notably, also had Tap as the protagonist.
---
YEAH EVERYONE FLAMES YOU IN POST GAME CHAT CUZ YOU'RE TRASH NO ONES HAPPY EXCEPT KILLER 
---
Haha. 
---
Removed - uncivil.
---
Remain civil.
---
I never leave home without Calm Spirit because of the Doc so I guess he wanted to get rid of me first. Also I Party Starter'd/Pallet slammed him 3 times. Baby killers bro.
---
You're telling me that they advertised a Killer as a group. Gave you two. And have two cosmetics that you have to earn or pay for. The same as every other killer. But because you knew the other skins ahead of time. You are entitled to the alternate skins?
---
I know that one. That is the dumbest totem in the game. 
---
He did wear a pig mask, yes. I on the other hand don't remember Amanda being confirmed to wear a pig mask. However all followers of Jigsaw wear pig masks at some point in their contribution, so thats not really something you should worry about. The only things that would change would be the background story, the killer model (remove breasts and have more formal wear) and the voice.
---
IMAGINE SUSIE FUNKO POPS ID GO OFF TO THAT IF I HAD A PENIS
---
Still nullified, thicc trumps all
---
Not sure why some people do that every time I run into someone that hides in a locker during a chase I just open it and hook them what‚Äôs the point
---
I didn't even know a saw PS3 game existed, but yeah, this is the most likely explenation, still doesn't change my feeling that Mark Hoffman would have made more sense
---
My God right?? I finally made an outfit I liked w the Christmas sweater and the thigh highs and this is just bless. I unironically disliked 90% of her current cosmetics and I main her... 
---
Sadako Yamamura from The Ring 
---
Eh just dont open chat and move onto the next game?
---
I still have hope that Mark will become a cosmetic once they can start getting deals with the licensors. If the Legion taught me anything, is that they are willing to have genderswaps. Only thing they would need to do apart from changing sounds would be to change the Pig's backstory to include Mark in their as well.
---
A training wheel perk to make bad killers feel better and a chance at still getting a kill despite playing badly all game.. also see DS for Survivors. (except NOED can be cleansed and can't really be abused like DS can be) 
---
You don't need to buy the whole outfit for Joe? You only need the Torso. Mask / Weapons are shared between killers. 
---
Changed it.

IM SO SICK OF LOSING OFFERINGS TO INFINITE LOADING SCREENS BHVR FIX THIS SHIT PLS
---
Because Amanda is a really strange and interesting character, part victim, part monster. She's integral to the story the entire time.
---
* She wears the Pig disguise to kidnap victims for Jigsaw as long as they're both alive.
---
* She's a survivor of a test, reborn as his protege and groomed to replace him until she fails her final test. Rebirth is the entire concept surrounding the Pig.
---
* She's a weirdly likeable character, she was intriguing in 1, she became likable in 2 being the only friend of the kid, and in 3 she was the villain but we still sort of wanted her to win.
---
* She fits the entity's requirement of volatile emotion, she's dangerously vengeful and angry at the world, but also obsessed with Jigsaw and wildly jealous.
---
As for Hoffman:
---
* He was never part of a test until long after Jigsaw was gone, he never fit the Pig's rebirth concept, he was just a douche that fell into the gig.
---
* He's a distinctly unlikable character, outside of the actual trials I always found myself rooting for him to fail. He lacks a real personality, he's just a bland guy who's grumpy all the time.
---
* Even once Jigsaw's dead nobody accepts him as a successor, Jill is given instructions to test him but just tries to bring him down. Gordon and whoever else at the end manage to.
---
* He never really cares about teaching people Jigsaw's message, he only really runs trials set up by Jigsaw in advance to keep up appearances, and as soon as he's at risk, just burns the lot. It feels like the only reason he ended up working for Jigsaw was because he got caught impersonating him and the alternative was bad for him.
---
* He's the dick who forces Amanda's hand and gets her killed.
---
Gens aren‚Äòt so exciting either, yet they‚Äòre flying by like nothing even though they take 8 times as long to complete (and feature less points/second than totems).
---
I agree with it being boring, but the most fun part for survivors (interaction with killers) needs to be made more rewarding (as it really isn‚Äòt)
---
It adds 10 seconds to the gen at 4 injured max rank, run DL instead.
---
Yeah I think making the disguise and feral frenzy both of part of legion would make them much more useful
---
As for the whole gen thing what I had in mind is when disguised and working on a gen legion will slowly reverse progress on a gen and making it reach a negative bar which will increase the time needed to repair it and if survivors try to fix a gen while legion is sabotaging it it will appear that the gen is being fixed but will in fact be sabotaged faster this also applies to healing as well.
---
Another ability that can be done while disguised is to disguise a hex totem making it appear as a dull totem and vice versa making it so you can protect your totems more effectively and you can attack while disguised though it will be removed when you attack.
---
For balance reasons legion looks exactly like a survivor when disguised that way legione will have an easier time against swf plus the no terror radius and crouching helps 
---
That's what Adrenaline does. It procs against injury and give speed boost. Your pick up timing is simply unfortunate. 
---
I‚Äôd start playing him if this catches traction. I could have the game on in the background while working on other stuff around the house. Free bloodpoints every match.
---
Well since it's tier two ruin and your first bbq and you got 23 more levels to go till 50 I say bbq.
---
Kerry was in the first and died in 3, that's at least slightly more than 2.
---
At the very least balancing 
---
Bop and bbq is op
---
Its on pc too
---
Ok? I literally dont care I dont want to play against Legion
---
IM GETTING THIS FEELING ABOUT WRAITH. EVERY SINGLE ONE HOOKS, BING BONGS OUT AND JUST WAITS FOR A SURVIVOR TO BING BONG BACK IN AGAIN!
---
I DONT CARE IF ITS A 'VIABLE TACTIC' ITS SO ANNOYING, CHEAP, LAZY AND BORING!
---
Its literally just a game man who cares. 
---
Do a generator ?
---
can you not do a gen? 
---
I've tried but they keep shocking me and kicking the generator.

---
guess just wait it out or dc but make sure to report the killer so he will get banned for taking the game hostage 
---
I would just quit then, or see how much of their time you could waste by just leaving the game on and going to do something else :)
---
Amanda was the Pig that kidnapped both the guys in Saw 1, was shown attacking people out of the bathtub in the Pig mask, and kidnapped AT LEAST Kerry in the third.
---
Might I recommend ruin? Thanatophobia is mostly a placebo, as the numbers are not very high. Ruin won't last, but as long as you get a hook before a gen is done, it's paid for itself.
---
I submitted a ticket earlier, heard that the issue is known to BHVR and that they are currently investigating it. Nothing about a possible refund (or if the issue affects more people) a extension of the bloodhunt event.
---
Title says otherwise.
---
Fair enough lol. There are blond options aren‚Äôt there?
---
I disagree even as a legion main. Here's my reasoning. In the lore and their story they'd galavant around at night in their masks breaking things and terrorizing people if they wanted, they'd ambush people I'm sure so I agree with a lower terror radius upon some secondary skill. Kinda like pig once a survivor is downed you can do something to them. I would say revive them cuz legion aren't emotionless serial killers based on their story. Once revived the survivor gets back up but has a cost of exposed for 60 seconds. Each survivor could only be revived once. Also upon revival your terror radius would drop to zero for 30 seconds. 
---
Amanda didn‚Äôt have the same belief as jigsaw and was more ok with just killing people instead of putting them in games they have a chance at winning and she was the first jigsaw apprentice to die so the entity took her at least that‚Äôs what was said on tv tropes
---
115 % move speed for a start and maybe some buffs to the power
---
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth 
---
I got in a locker after I was hit with Sloppy Butcher and there was just a fountain of blood spurting out the front. It‚Äôs honestly ridiculous and I would love for these bugs to be fixed.
---
Kate now plz
---
Ahh right, I forgot about the base perks, thanks mate. 
---
2 people DCd that‚Äôs a problem with the people who left, the game removes generators so that you stand some chance but they aren‚Äôt gonna let you have a free win because that‚Äôs unfair on the killers side.
---
Whatever position is annoying is where I rank her
---
Whenever those moments happen to me I just give up honestly. :P
---
This game is very hard for a begginer. Nothing is explained well and you may rage a ton of time due to the level of difference between playing killers and survivors.  
---
The 20 ranks system is very bad and you will be in a low rank faster than you deserve, skill wise. This is made worse by the fact that if you play solo as a survivor, your chances at winning a match are very low, unless you get put together with a trio of friends or the killer is bad.  
---
The game has a very nice setting but it is poorly implemented with the imbalance that exists in game.  
---
Seems like a smarter choice, thanks mate.
---
Survivor main here. I like the current mechanic for how it works, you were just put in a real shitty situation my friend. 
---
#fuckhoffman #giveamandaahug
---
Not really since the killer can‚Äôt grab 2 people at once and you can just have someone use breakdown to destroy the hook or have someone use a flash light unless it‚Äôs cannibal in that case yeah your not getting past him
---
Borrowed doesn‚Äôt even work right now. Wasted perk slot 
---
I usually see if they'll be willing to farm, and eat my 3 hooks by the end.
---
If not, most you can do is shoot to safety. Killers routinely safety if they just dunk you guys, so, hope for the best.
---
Ideal 2v1 would drop it to 2 gens, IMO.
---
What if I see them just floating, not crouching or running but they're like frozen and move forwards xD
---
Hol up I didn't knew The Nightmare got a movie!
---
You get the cat, the milk and lickage!
---
But the problem is how the execute this. They simply take away two gens, meaning it‚Äôs much easier for a killer to find a survivor and kill them right off the back by camping, and then finding the other survivor by the 4-5 gens they need to patrol. There‚Äôs no hatch the killer has to worry about, or anything until 1 generator remains. 
---
I never said I wanted a free win, but rather doing something like this in a game designed for 4v1 gameplay is outright unfair. One gen and the hatch would make a huge difference, but outplaying a patrolling killer is almost impossible alone.
---
Could be a hacker as survivors can‚Äôt lag switch 
---
I would usually say just don‚Äôt play nurse because it‚Äôs so damn hard on PS4 but if you‚Äôre getting kills then just keep up the grind my dude. Keep practicing and get those higher ranks, that‚Äôs where you will improve 
---
well, besides the joke the killer itself seems cool
---
Kill it with fire
---
Nah, I dont help survivors that run ds.  I wouldn't even farm them for a stack of wglf.
---
Kinky
---
Ah, the "Ball is life" build.
---
You took that from r/cursedimages?
---
So just because a survivor has DS you dont help them? Lol doesnt even make any sense. Not all DS users are toxic lol.
---
That would be a good idea
---
You most certainly do come across lag switchers on console.
---
Wait the bell puts him in a different world? Does the spirit also go into this world, it seems like she would but I gotta ask obvious questions
---
How did you know she was there? Also uhh she is kinda bad 
---
Oh right, because not having to wait til tier 3 is such a big buff. Completely changes the meta. And if you are wotrried so much, do totems. Either you gey the perk, or you get the points anyway
---
What‚Äôs a computer?
---
It still boggles my mind you can't stay in a lobby with your SWF and have to re invite after every game. This game must be such a mess under the hood
---
FRANK AND SUSIE FUNKOS PLEASE. ITS A MIGHTY NEED
---
Just watch the video man like I don't know what to tell you, Its like a silly meme video or something Idk what I made but it's not a troll video
---
I mean if you are a decent survivor, there is pretty much no negative side effect for bodyblocking a killer.
---
only issue with these types of concepts is time. Time it takes to achieve whatever you're doing. A very good killer is very efficient with their time. If your spending all that time to simply regress a generator, you're gonna have a bad game.
---
About 5-6 days
---
That would makes sense, I just seen the way she moves and it made me feel like she does more then pull herself. But the strength required would explain why there isn't fatigue for using it on survivors
---
Oh wel that‚Äôs fair 
---
Depending on the time you do the Mori, it doesn't cost the killer points, nor the survivor.  A 3rd hook being replaced with a mori is more points to the killer via the Kill event, and most likely less time wasted.  The survivor would have been dead on hook anyway, so no chance to get more points.
---
Nah every hag insta mori'd
---
No killer had been advertised with different appearences as part of thier premise until now. And with all crap this game and the community has went through, it makes sense that people think they should get the other two member.
---
How? It literally creates a standoff 
---
Also, what you suggest is worse than a mori, you‚Äôre saying that people should be punished heavily for a feature that was *intended by the devs* to be in the game. (Obviously not at release, but they added it none the less.) It‚Äôs an absolutely ridiculous suggestion. 
---
I got every perk on Billy tier 3 and every perk on claudette tier 3, the only teachable I don't have is pharmacy
---
What if the spirit was already in the spirit world along with the survivors and her power brings her back to the real world and since no one is there it is just empty.
---
Yea I was just gonna say this, Would give you a reason to actually play different survivors. shall we start a list ? 
---
Love your stuff!
---
HAD A GAME TODAY WHERE MY GENERATOR SKILL CHECKS WOULDNT TRIGGER. STILL MANAGED TO GET TWO GENERATORS DONE WHILE MY TEAMMATES DID REALLY NOTHING
---
Make him even worse to play against? Really? Him being weak is a problem yes. But him removing all interactivity during chases is far more of a problem and will get even worse if he is buffed without redesign/other nerfs.
---
I only let non toxic Dwights live.
---
Killers, sadly, get no bonus cosmetic whether you buy the dlc or not. I don‚Äôt know about bill since I‚Äôm a console player. 
---
To a certain extent, but this is outright suicide if the killer actually tries. 
---
I am a killer main, and hate hatch standoff‚Äôs, and somewhat agree with this, as in if people are dead, it‚Äôs probably your fault your team is dead.
---
My problem comes down to survivors having almost no chance at escape in a game like this.
---
Even as a killer, rank 5, I still think that having a lower number of survivors is a giant disadvantage. 
---
I think it's like 10 seconds and there are a few add ones that increase it
---
Don't turn around, cause your gonna see myself healing.
---
Don't turn around, I don't need to use up this lithe.
---
Just walk away, it's tearing me apart that you're tier 3.
---
I'm sneaking away,
---
So you won't have to knowwwww.
---
I don't doubt me too much, but I do doubt the DS user's presence of mind to not waste the free out I'm giving them.
---
I.e.
---
- I go and manage to make it in time to block for them.
---
- I'm slashed, and run at the last possible moment to ensure they escape.
---
- They still choose to DS the killer.
---
- Two injured people, no remaining 'Get out of jail free', my heart is broken.
---
Hit the grapes?
---
This is a horrible meme. 
---
That‚Äôs what Monto calls great skill checks
---
Beware of mods, OP, they can be quite lethal to these posts.
---
Ah. I am religious to Noob3 so I didn‚Äôt know lol.

Have a look at my proposed changes to the hatch. I made a post a few hours after this one went up.

I WOULDN'T MIND GETTING 1,000 POINTS IF I'M WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE HATCH AND I "LET" THEM OUT. ON ONE SIDE IT FEELS LIKE THE KILLER GETS SOMETHING OUT OF IT, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ASSHOLES THAT FORCE A STANDOFF IN THE FIRST PLACE MIGHT NOT ANYMORE TO DENY THE KILLER THOSE 1,000 POINTS. THEY EVEN SAID THAT THE ENTITY FEEDS OFF MORE THAN JUST A SURVIVOR'S HOPE, INCLUDING THE KILLER'S RAGE AND POSSIBLY MERCY. HELL, IT COULD EVEN GIVE THE SURVIVOR MORE HOPE BECAUSE THEY'LL GO INTO THE NEXT TRAIL IN A GOOD MOOD AND HOPEFUL FOR THE NEXT!

You will be fine. Well worth it still in 2019

How does he know you're there?

That's be a mind fuck

I don‚Äôt care for the Christmas stuff tbh. Glad you enjoy it tho.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm subbed 2 all of them

Or this is legit the only way he knows how to play, or likes to.  OR it could be a little kid, either way best to not get ego butthurt and just requeue, OP isn't wrong, but it does come off, snooty imo.
---
That‚Äôs clearly not the girl snowman, Ohlaugh! GET GLASSES ALREADY!
---
in her blink, she is travelling through some sort of other dimention called the spirit world. (it‚Äôs also the source of the wraith‚Äôs power) maybe she‚Äôs just pulling survivors into the spirit world with her?
---
That‚Äôs what they make you do on console!? I WOULD REFUSE TO STRUGGLE!
---
Luckily Susie doesn't cost that much.
---
hatch mechanics:
---
number of gens have to be finished to spawn: all alive survivors +1
---
if only 1 survivor is left, its open automatically, if not, you need a purple or pink key.
---
Nah just learn to not be afraid of the killer and make sure you‚Äôre spending as much time doing generators as possible. 
---
For killer starting out is easy as survivors don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing until better ranks 
---
Unless they are brand new then there‚Äôs no real excuse. If it‚Äôs a little kid they aren‚Äôt even allowed to play the game by the age requirements so that‚Äôs not really a good reason. 
---
I would never say anything myself to these idiots but the fact they exist is pretty upsetting in my opinion. 
---
[yes but i want the classic](https://imgur.com/a/T3bCrrO)

I have one of those, but my attracts all Killers.
---
That looks red to me just lighter. Maybe I‚Äôm dumb tho

a good spirit can be just as effective as a nurse. think of her as a nurse but slightly lower skill gap. still really good. i would put her in A rank (in a S-F rank board)
---
He's free to play how he wants 
---
might just be the lighting but I don‚Äôt have any other screenshots from back then
---
You should've waited until max bloodpoints to prestige
---
You are a fucking idiot. You talk in one post about swf keeping people playing the game. Then in another post that killers should just suck it up and play against swf as if it is a fair game. Do you realize killer queue times are worse than survivor queue times for a reason?
---
I agree with you, it‚Äôs just mostly if a survivor is doing one of those things, they‚Äôre probably going to be using another. I really don‚Äôt mind if a survivor is doing this its just part of the meme.
---
Oh then yeah, Ruin definitely sounds better :)
---
Ok! 
---
Shape as his kit outweighs a single perk plus there‚Äôs a lot of fun builds you can do with him

fuuuuuck you ebony mori why the hell is everyone using them during a double blood point run!? you don't get bonus for mori after the first hook! ugh

THIS GAMES KILLER COMMUNITY IS THE MOST TOXIC SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN. I'M RANK 1, I'M NOT TOXIC AND BI DON'T RUN CRUTCH PERKS, BUT I'VE BEEN TUNNELED AND CAMPED FOR THE LAST 16 FUCKING GAMES IN A ROW, YET YOU FUCKS HAVE THE AUDACITY TO GET MAD AT SURVIVORS FOR USING THESE CRUTCH PERKS.

I don't want to buy Leatherface because he doesn't appeal to me whatsoever and I'm still waiting for BBQ and Chili in the Shrine.... It wasn't even once in the shrine in 2018 -.-' Yes I do know that Leatherface is cheap, but somehow I really don't wanna spend money on him XD
---
Do you have IG/Twitter where we could see your work?
---
They already announced they‚Äôre rewriting the game in a new language. From Bluepoint Script to C++ so that should help a ton when it‚Äôs finished.
---
But the Devs wanted us all to have a ‚ÄúFUN KILLER‚Äù for everyone! That‚Äôs their statement... all they created was a weak killer who has to camp to get its kills, Ive talked to many legions and they all have said the same thing. Yah I have to camp sorry it‚Äôs the only way the legion is so weak. It feels special now when you get a basement camping insidious leaferface... 
---
Shape, He big n beefy he big n sneaki he behind you cheeki breeki.
---
I have a Twitter but haven‚Äôt used it for years!
---
I am really active on Instagram though! Name‚Äôs cookiehchar there! 
---
Thanks for the love c: üíï
---
How do you expect to good at a game in less than a week? That's a bad attitude. 
---
Anyway, watch Noob3's videos on twitch (not on YouTube) to understand how you can play as a survivor.
---
Watch Tru3talent's videos (on YouTube) to learn to play as a killer.
---
''Every time'' This is the 2nd post i remember from you. The same Walmart cosplay attention whoring shit. At least put some effort into it
---
It‚Äôs probably your low rank dude. At red ranks I rarely ever get camped and almost never play against a Wraith.
---
both
---
Listen to these guys, in 15 now its getting veeeery bad.
---
The devs are rank 20 players.
---
Keep forgetting how many actual children are on this website
---
It‚Äôs simple, Rock, Paper, Scissors and whoever wins either gets the Hatch or the Hook. They can add that emote lol.
---
If they respect it you wait for their frenzy to run out.
---
I've heard it may have to do with matrices... change one number and the whole calculation gets messed up. Makes me wonder how they ever get code to work in the first place.
---
power: annoying as all hell.
---
It‚Äôs the only perk in the game that actually gets worse from tier 1 to tier 3.
---
Weird. I rarely come across a leatherface who camps. I love going up against leatherface because you can loop him well. Except in maps where you can't even see where the pallets are. üòï
---
"hit or miss..."
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by that, I guess it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a killer main but what is it that‚Äôs changed in killer play for the event?
---
welcome to the master race
---
Don't worry just leave and jump back into the que man, you'll learn to be chill about things. Also avoid the text box by keeping it closed and dc right after you're done as Killer, no muss no fuss man.
---
Don't worry about escaping just set small goals for yourself, there's always next game. Besides every horror movie has everyone but one person usually die anyways.
---
Damn 1 DC someone already did and only 1 gen is done and he is still camping 
---
Yeah, it really do be like that sometimes
---
Thank you Diva, very cool.
---
Previously the ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù was actual content via dlc
---
Oh keeping count now are we ;3 cute üíï Love you too. 
---
I actually put a lot of effort into it, thanks for asking! Sculpted it up by hand, put plaster strips on it, dug the clay out, mixed the paint on my own, weathered it and even live streamed putting hair wefts on it c: It‚Äôs not latex like a lot of people has and I‚Äôm proud of my own creation :) also even resewed the jacket on my own from an old base and weathered it and painted it. The blade was made from scratch using milk cardboard packing, worbla, wood glue and acrylic paints! :D
---
Damn this is exactly what I thought! That fucking 2 v 2 raft minigame made my palms raw!
---
This is so sad, can we buff Nea.
---
Honestly, exposure will desensitize you to it. It becomes more of another job a survivor needs to take care of rather than ‚Äú*OH GOD IM GONNA DIE.*‚Äù
---
Escaping is cool and all but I treat the game as a matter of getting shit done. At least 2 Gens. 2 Hooks. 2 heals. 2 Chases won. You can change those numbers to your liking but that's how I prioritize things. Same with killer. At least one hook on everyone. Some pallet and gen kicks and 2 survivors sacrificed is a win. Also. It's a game dude. Chill out with that shit. Take a break if needed. It shouldn't be all that. Just have fun. 
---
Because people like to come in this sub-reddit and brag about there 4mans with freddy ahahah 
---
That commitment
---
pretty sure it is a glitch it works sometimes 
---
It's only when the killer is carrying you, and it's a very slow rotation. You can get maximum results with like one rotation per second.
---
It does say in the wiki that Survivors can't enter the Spirit Realm by any means and that the Entities Realm and the Spirit Realm are 2 different places. So I don't think that theory works.
---
  
---
"  The **Spirit World** is on a different plane of existence to the  Entity's Realm. Its appearance is identical to the Entity's Realm, but  those who traverse it see black fog covering their peripheral vision.  Notably, beings within the Spirit World cannot interact with beings and  objects outside of it. This is evidenced by the fact that The Wraith  minimally uncloaks himself when interacting with [Props](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Props). 
---
Survivors have no means to enter it. "  
---
A lot of people think the spirit is some big brain 1000 iq mind game killer that can only be played by people who took 4 years of calculus, but thats just not true. She can be very good at mind games and the whole "killing" thing but she can really be picked up by anyone which is why she is a cement number 3. Obviously it takes some learning but you dont need to take a semester of pallet lessons to learn how to play her. If she didn't require any learning id say higher but she is cement at 3 with billy at 2 and nurse at 1.
---
*Myers slowly pops in beach boys into the boombox, playing it on low, bobs head slightly, sits back in lawnchair, knife backwards gripped in hand, beer in the other*
---
Yeah thats what I‚Äôm thinking whenever I get chased...
---
I'd say a big nerf. Think nurse levels. Maybe less.

I‚Äôm rank 1 rn and yeah, it‚Äôs pretty bad. I‚Äôm probably gonna throw a bunch of matches or something soon, I got my screenshot of rank 1 but I honestly have no desire to be up here or force my lower rank friends to play up here anymore.
---
Still no love for feng
---
I never realized before now how perfect of a fit Samantha would be. She'd probably be PlayStation exclusive though.
---
Thanks for the advice! Somestimes I get into games with people who hide in bushes the whole game and that kind of annoys me
---
Every game usually the same P3 Claude‚Äôs, Billy‚Äôs and Nurses everyone has DD and No‚Äôed it‚Äôs just not fun it‚Äôs boring and frustrating 
---
The Spirit uses a different, more astral plane of existence.
---
Like DBD messages are why I just turned off public messaging I would like to turn it back on.
---
People are saying this is a shit meme but I like it because it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs good, like it‚Äôs meant to be.
---
Yeah sadly its not a possibility to make sure others are being useful, just pride yourself you did what you could and its on them not you for wasting that time they could have been getting Gens.
---
Best Feng Min outfit. And very cute drawing :3
---
I‚Äôm sorry but what do these mean?
---
As a survivor main this video alone keeps me awake at night
---
Is it out yet?
---
Well, That‚Äôs a different story on console there bud, no nurse, barely a billy, And I know where totems spawn, Teammates actually help, More points, more pips. 
---
I have all perks unlocked so I really just buy repeats for BP and I grind up the new killer/survivor to 45soon as i get them....well Legions p3 but thats beside the point.
---
Save the Best for Last and Play With Your Food, respectively.
---
I have it on PS4 but since i literally have nothing I don't really play much unless I'm having a really crap time on Xbox and just want to wreck. Pretty sad when i say it aloud.
---
I‚Äôm just not looking forward to the content drought it would lead to. 
---
Have to fix everything before you add in something that‚Äôll just break it even more 
---
Yeah, it helps to play with friends but all of my friends hate the game.
---
Oh yes that would be awesome 
---
No problem. 
---
J think he means spookwagon
---
Nope I've been in the match since 5, it's 11:20 where I'm at now 
---
Prestige Spirit (assuming it is) looks sweet. 
---
Looks like a big oof
---
IF YOU RUN SLOPPY BUTCHER ON WRAITH RIGHT NOW YOU'RE A TRASH NO SKILL KILLER
---
Intrestin'
---
Feels bad man, have you just been afk?
---
LOL I'M AWFUL AT FINDING GENS THERE, TOO
---
ahhh noooo I don't like to be stabbeded!
---
It depends on the match. Tru3 vs. FREDDEH is usually fun. 
---
Same plus I get to get to kiss 2 faces at once nice
---
Yeah and after 2 hours of both of us being afk I decided to move and he started chasing me again. 
---
I AGREE
---
Killer we need
---
Lol imagine if we lived in a world where the devs cared enough about their playerbase to not just make cosmetics and fix console
---
I‚Äôm so glad this subreddit exists
---
*Eventually* is the problem. I'd rather not beat a survivor down bit by bit of the course of a very long chase. The best hope is that they make a mistake while trying to loop a 110 movespeed killer.
---
WHY IS SLOPPY BUTCHER NOT FIXED EVERYTIME A KILLER WOHT SLOPPY BUTCHER HITS ME ITS LIKE IM GETTING MASSACRED AND YOU CAN SEE THE BLOOD SPEWING OUT OF ME FROM ACROSS THE MAP ITS SO ANNOYING 
---
Ok. What I've seen of Tru3 is pretty boring.
---
You can‚Äôt say his not dedicated 
---
So, they are no threat to them? I don't get it...
---
Also who the fuck gives a crap about karma anyways that don't mean anything, this community is sick. 
---
100% agree dude
---
Legit that this was just a screenshot nice cosplay
---
Yeah. He could stand to put up fewer videos and edit them like panda and monto. 
---
Some perks are killer specific
---
It's a free escape if your team is shit, when you can't even do two Gens than face it, you arnt worthy of living! 
---
Currently have a "the shape" offering
---
I'm saving it for a rainy day when I have more Mula to spare
---
david because of wglf 
---
The killer itself is literally paid dlc. What even is this stupid straw-man attempt?
---
And the Friday the 13th game being super dead.
---
Just Monika
---
&gt; all they created was a weak killer who has to camp to get its kills   
---
***THANOS PHOBIA***  
---
***THANOS PHOBIA***
---
Prior to the tears about legion the only killer I really recall seeing people pout about was Nurse... maybe Spirit, but most killers outside of Pig are serviceable ( and honestly, even pig isn't THAT bad) I quit playing Last Year because I went 16 wins in a row with various teams. As long as everyone sticks together you can bully the fuck out and steamroll the killers, there's little to nothing to force people to split up or straggle off.. and they can't catch you with the insta kills because everyone knows to avoid skylights, and vents and it's easy to do. You have the dude with the PKE meter or whatever that shows every booby trap and trap making them useless. 
---
the tank, you kite and kill, the..I forget what he is.. Smoker.. the dude that throws the chain.. he's got like 10 health and you can melt him, slasher is the one that has the most chance but Prox bomb, flame thrower or stun lock him and he's easy enough to deal with. Once the killer spawns in you just have someone out of range that keeps him in LOS so he can't despawn and go into killer vision and the assault dudes or if someone has a shotgun\flamethrower melts him while the medic just spams heals on ya.. and the killer will die before the medic exhausts his packs and needs to recharge. Unless I've missed a patch recently, it's incredibly imba and one sided. I'm surprised DBD survivor mains aren't playing it, it's like their wet dream. 
---
Not quite, while they didn't really reach the goals, the game has improved dramatically.
---
I laughed way too hard at this lmao
---
If only it were an actual shitpost...
---
This is console?? So smooth looking compared to mine
---
Sometimes it works.  Other times, I'm internally screaming "Why aren't any of you pinging those gens YET?!!"
---
Because the killer knew ahead of time that you guys were bringing party streamers. Yep, it is on them for not wanting to farm and exploit the game for blood points, not on you for reacting poorly to the killer actually trying to play the game.
---
As a survivor main I don‚Äôt get why people stay on gens until they‚Äôre dick to ass with the killer. I played hill billy last night and was able to chainsaw two survivors because they got confident and stayed on the gen lmao
---
You can go fuck yourself
---
NOED aint broken specifically cause you can deal with it as astute survivors and it means one perk less for dealing with the 5 gen rush all survivors will eventually do. 
---
I HAD THREE GAMES IN A ROW WHERE 2 OR MORE SURVIVORS ESCAPED USING A KEY WHEN I WAS ON THE VERGE OF A 4K. I‚ÄôVE HAD A LOT MORE FUN RUNNING FRANKLIN‚ÄôS DURING THE EVENT.
---
You are all wrong. He clearly means weedwagon
---
Same here, at rank 3 and lobby times are ass
---
M8, remember "steam download region matchmaking"?  
---
there *is* to ruin
---
YES  
---
Even as a killer, you stare at survivors like "**sample text**" as they can't move an inch by some reason.
---
Same. And I ALREADY OWN ALL THE CHARACTERS
---
The killer doesn't owe you farming just because it is the end of the event, and they weren't exploiting your vulnerability. They were playing the game with the intention of winning.
---
It ignores part of the sound effects for some reason.  
---
I hate having to tab out for my *Spotify-a-Lobby*^(tm) to work.
---
If it has been out for a year or more than spoilers are sorta fair game
---
I don‚Äôt know if I want him or walker more.
---
I hadn‚Äôt had Huntress leveled up before this event, same with Michael, oh boy now that I do.
---
Okay, looping is NOW intrinsic to how we play.
---
When this game started, looping wasn't considered, they believed it just was having two entrances to the pallet, maybe 5 seconds of a turn around into it. Then, hey, this is a game.
---
Looping then was toxic, so we have a really weird disconnect. The game now is balanced around the option, but people have holdover opinions, adjustments to the new meta, and are on/off salty because they "respect" pallets. (Huge fucking mistake.)
---
Now, and partially then, looping = immersion breaking. People use this as an excuse for why they feel dis-empowered as killer, and counter to anything I've said, on some obvious level, safe / infinite loops are absolutely immersion destroying for both parties.
---
So playing the game is bringing in an ebony mori and iridescent one-shot hatches, now?
---
You're rank 6 against rank 2-10. +/- 4 ranks is not a huge amount. Hell in some circumstances it's a difference of 10 games.
---
Also, RANK MEANS NOTHING. At least half of the rank 6-10s you'd come up against are people who've been rank 1 before. There's no reason you couldn't have been. Rank resets so often, and is so easy to manipulate that it's basically meaningless. The only difference between having a red rank and a green one is usually just where the player wants to sit.
---
Also if you demanded to only be against rank 6s, you'd probably be waiting the better part of an hour at least per game.
---
Oh they are, if you‚Äôre injured and you get frenzy hit then you‚Äôll start with 1 3rd of the bar down, meaning his bar recharges and you then get hit to 2 3rds down. This makes him more effective but it doesn‚Äôt fix the fact that he‚Äôs boring to play against because there‚Äôs nothing you can do against a semi coherent legion. He‚Äôs just eh because hes not necessarily a good killer but at the same time you can‚Äôt really be bad with him. You just can‚Äôt be good either. 
---
because inherently a lot of high rarity stuff is unbalanced. Most killers have rather OP add-ons that are only limited by the fact of how often they get them in webs. Mori's in general really are broken even the ivory can tilt the scales quickly. same goes for survivors, playing against a bunch of insta-heals, keys, and toolboxes that cut gen repairing down a ton isn't exactly balanced outside of survivors most likely aren't going to either have a lot, or only run them in certain circumstances.
---
I'm sure there's a reason I saw a spike in all the killers with really good rare add-ons this past week, i.e. Spirit, Hag, Legion, Huntress, etc. than I normally do. If anything this highlights why some of the ultra-rare's are broken, I'm sure if old BNP and insta-blinds was still a thing that would be abused to all hell, I got 20+ of those each quickly. 
---
I mean... yeah? Some people play with the intention of winning.
---
I am interested, I'll be sure to check. Thanks man
---
How do you know?
---
Because I said so bitch
---
I thought I was on R6 subreddit 
---
Oof. Someone‚Äôs a little defensive about poor little console
---
Gave last person the hatch after a SWF match.  It was the other 3 that were the SWF, and he was the one that burned the bloody streamer.
---
She was the first female licensed killer that‚Äôs why
---
Probably because survivors have the ability to end the game in 5 minutes or less so the killer doesn‚Äôt have time to actually play the match to deal with such things. My survivor squad has a goal of 3 gens before the first hook we hit quite often. That‚Äôs the game being more then half over before the killer has made it a quarter of the way with his very first objective. 
---
Any decent player will say meg 
---
Lmao. Did you just try to send a hateful message and get it deleted in violation of the rules? Enjoy your slideshow.
---
Don't trace, that doesn't make your art good when you post it, it looks unreal and also you may get the hate of the (s)whole art community 
---
Delete what? I didn‚Äôt even delete it lmao it got removed 
---
It‚Äôs still there dumb shit 
---
I finally won, after 7 hours I wonüî•
---
Uhh no it‚Äôs not and I put deleted instead of removed the world is ending
---
Jeez take a chill pill dude. I wasn‚Äôt even attacking consoles at the start but obviously that invoked a reaction from some guy who has nothing better to do with his time but start saying some stupid random shit. You‚Äôre not wasting mine. Have fun :)
---
lMao Nea's promo looks p e r f e c t  
---
but in-game, that lime hair...
---
Nobody is gonna say slug?
---
Ok dumb shit eat a lard 
---
imagine if we lived in the world if the player base was ok with and not cried because they didn't get a new map, perks, survivor and killers every 3 months 
---
Freddy Krueger. not a fish boi we have rn. hopefully the "full power rework" is changing the character too.
---
Let‚Äôs play spot the triggered console player
---
I‚Äôd rather be able to play the game on console than get a new map ever again full stop
---
I agree generators can get done way too fast but looping shouldn‚Äôt be blamed for that. If a killer is spending time chasing a survivor and sees gens are getting done while they‚Äôre occupied, it‚Äôs up to the killer to know when to give up on a chase and start controlling generators. I‚Äôve played a good amount of each killer and never really had that much of a problem when it comes to looping
---
More proof Nea is killer

*Cries In Console*
---
For me, I just keep in mind that it is highly likely that I'm going to get caught eventually. That being said, my job is to keep the killer as busy as possible for my team. 
---
Looping isnt toxic
---
Not with a sweaty BBQ Billy. Or BBQ in general, as in a 2 v1 there is nothing you can do once they‚Äôre after you. 
---
It‚Äôs not toxic only trash killers say that bc they‚Äôd rather you run in a straight line so they can kill you easier lol
---
With nurse survivors can at least break line of sight mindgame and juke in the chases, making her a matter of skill between the two sides.
---
LISTEN HERE I JUST GOT LEATHERFACE YEA, THESE DUMB AS FUCK SURVIVORS KNOW I GOT BBQ. I GO TO THE BASEMENT AND HOOK SOMEONE AND DONT SEE ANYONE HMMMMMMMMMMM HOW WEIRD SO I LOOK AROUND THE BASEMENT AND 3 FUCKERS ARE SITTING IN LOCKERS AND CORNERS SO BASICALLY I HANG EM ALL SIDE BY SIDE ALL NICE AND I GET CALLED A CAMPER IM NOT LEAVING IF MY SHIT PROKS 0 PEOPLE 
---
It's cool that you wanna try hard but please dont be one of those killers that 4k when everyone offers bloody party streamers. That's just as whole new level of toxicity.
---
Curious why it has to be for doc or hag and not any of the other people
---
did you about the... a never mind 
---
FOR REAL i was so happy they didn't forget the poor girls christmas sweater. God knows they've been sleeping on her. Pls BHVR end this drought.
---
Lol maybe but damn matches as survivor is hell right now it seems
---
I agree with everything except Billy chainsaw. Fuck billy players and their chainsaw
---
 wha-
---
My current annoying bug is when I knock down pallets I can't run anymore üëåüëå
---
I never look at what's burnt
---
That's been happening too. It seems to only happen when I play Meg though. I just slide across the ground.
---
I love looking at this conflict from the outside
---
r/whoosh
---
I would prefer it if it says on
---
As a survivor main, I hardly ever see a nurse on PS4. Because of that, I don't know how to juke her or even play against her. I'm sure many other ps4 survivors don't know either. Use that to your advantage. 
---
Nurse is all about predicting WHERE the survivor will go and WHAT they're going to do. She's very trial and error at the beginning. Since you need to be two steps ahead of the survivor, I would suggest playing as survivor for a bit. Learn all of the looping spots, the areas where survivors are likely to hang out, things like that. Being a survivor, and thinking like a survivor, will help you when playing nurse. 
---
There are also lots of addons to change her blink time, distance, accuracy, and amount. Perhaps you can try out different combinations until you find what works for you. 
---
You could also ask a few friends (or make some, there's a DBD community that is full of people looking for friend groups to play with) to join a KYF session to help you practice.
---
Good luck! I'm excited to see other people trying nurse out on console!
---
If u t bag ima stare at you on the hook and let all your teammates go tiss a comandment 
---
Or not even hear anything, one time i had a claudette who just crouched  in the corner of the map for the whole game.
---
Nah, it's the killer being sweaty.
---
On the Game??
---
He can eat my ass, that map is the most loop-centric map.  No long lines, nothing to be clever with. Just loops and death.
---
What rank you be?
---
Rank 2 I‚Äôll prob just play killer honestly 
---
I personally enjoy the mini game of seeing how long I can keep a killer chasing me; it also helps me stay calm since I know that as long as I distract him, the generators will get done and we can leave. Assuming everyone is doing them of course. 
---
&gt;If they where to not release anything new for 6 months the game would lose a lot of its playerbase. 
---
then it's shit game. If you need a constant carrot on a stick to keep you interested in playing then it's a poorly designed and uninteresting game. People have NO problem playing on servers that are nothing but DUST or 2Fort.  game after game after game and have done so since CS and TF were Quake\HL 1 Mods. You telling me that people can play the same game that hasn't changed in nearly 2 decades, and constantly in steams top 5 played game day in and day out with no problem but if DBD doesn't release anything new in 6 months the game will die!! Then it should.. 
---
I'd much rather then focus on Balance and fixing bugs then pumping out killers every 3 months for ADHD kids who need something shiny every 2 minutes to stay interested. That will grow and maintain a stronger community then just pumping shit out cuz people are under the impression more is always better. 
---
They took the risk and payed for it once they saw you approach, then when one got downed, then the second got downed, then hiding fucking stupidly RIGHT NEXT to where everyone got downed.
---
Greedy for that heal they make mistakes 
---
well, I'm really close to ending it all in my killer career too but not because of what you listed here. most of your complaints sound like "you" problem, not the game flaws. 
---
I'm playing killer less and less cause Trapper is fucked. Dream World is fucked. sounds are fucked. scratch marks are fucked. these things just make the game unplayable. you can't hear survivors breath anymore because if you raise your volume, any notification or chase music will be deafening therefore harder to locate immersed p3 Claudettes or blended in rocks Adams. Stridor is fucked so literally no counter to Iron Will. 
---
and 'course everyone can say "k bye" to me but that means EU zone will lose a rank 1 killer who never tunnels/camps (unless deserved a.i farmed or bmed too hard and wasn't good enough at game to afford it), never uses noed unless rp reasons for Pig. and I also don't play Billy, Nurse or Legion. wish I'd face more killers like me as survivor. 
---
He‚Äôs just a bad killer chances are 
---
This guy gets what's up 9/10 times.
---
ü§î
---
I‚Äôve have it be this way since legion cam out and don‚Äôt know about others but your not the only one
---
Honestly I had the same thing happen to me playing survivor, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt mad that the Mori was used on me, I was more mad at the fact that the killer was just absolutely god awful and unsportsmanlike after the game about it. I said gg, he said fuck you and left. Like what? 
---
Literally the only loop that bugs me is the T wall L wall but that‚Äôs not even a pallet loop, it‚Äôs just bad map design. That and various pallet loops that you can easily see over. They‚Äôre not horribly broken like any of the infinites we used to have and I‚Äôll get you eventually but they take no skill and as long as you have half a brain you‚Äôll be fine. There‚Äôs no mind gaming and no counter play for the killer, you just keep running and running and running until you get a hit or in some cases stunned by a pallet. Those are the only issues I see as valid complaints because once again there‚Äôs no counter play to them at all.
---
I GOT NO PROBLEM WITH THE HAGS TRAPS. BUT HOLY SHIT, IF THEY CAUSE MY CAMERA TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL (PS4) ONE MORE TIME IM GONNA PUNCH A HOLE THROUGH MY TV
---
You're not my dad.
---
you would he suprised what spirit can do, theres a skillcap for sure but I might as well put her at number 3 under billy and nurse if she's played by a skilled killer.
---
This.  Just went through 2 controllers in one year over the left analog stick.
---
Thats the worst feeling in the entire game. Seeing your ping spike up right before the start of the match.
---
Which is so stupid imho. I don't understand why they don't give you the killers 3 unique perks at like rank 1 or something just to get the feel of how they work. I say this as somehow who buys all the chapters and has never actually used the offering splinters.
---
BUMP. I wanna see this
---
It's for the satisfaction of destroying all 4 of those pesky survivors.
---
He didnt complain, he compared the amount of benefits survivors have compared to the killer
---
Give the 3 unique perks at rank 1.
---
Yeah, after throwing in Bloody Streamers...
---
AS A WRAITH MAIN WHEN IM KILLER I CAN SAY THIS IS TRUE
---
Unnerving is a rather rare sight tho.
---
Thank you!
---
what perks do you use on him?
---
bruh I like escaping the killer just as much as the next guy, but that shits stupid. Get theese guys banned 
---
I'd love to see an interpretation of Death, Chariot, or Judgement from the House of the Dead series.
---
Have you made your way out as far as autohaven wreckers recently?
---
Woah there buckaroo, I get where your coming from we can be a very toxic community but don't you think that's a bit far
---
Dude this shits staight facts no lie. I also played legion to rank 1, my mans a point farmer. Red ranks are hard tho you cant deny, lowkey feels like you gotta run franks mixtaoe for the 4 man swf
---
Yup!
---
Turns out jokes about the n-word are a sensitive subject. Who knew.
---
Depends how you use it. If you instantly kill everyone after their first hook you'll get less points. You lose out on 2 full chases and 700 hook progression points. If you save it for someone who's been 2 hooked, or hit struggle on their first hook, then it's more points than hooking them a final time would be.
---
I'm sure this will happen during 2019. A large part of the game is the Peer-to-Peer code to connect players to each other, with that getting a major overhaul for the change to Dedicated Servers, I'm sure a lot of the game's code is going to be rewritten. That should hopefully mitigate these bugs when the perform content updates as well as streamline things on their end.   
---
If it were up to me, I would skip a Chapter release and use that time to fix the game, especially for consoles. No point in releasing killers, maps, survivors, perks if they're ultimately unusable due to bugs and performance issues.
---
Juggling. Then you have enduring to make it easier on yourself 
---
This is the most annoying thing. Especially when the loop the killer right next to the hook. 200iq right there.
---
lmfao I love No0b3
---
If survivors get rekt by NOED then that's their punishment for not cleansing totems. It's not like survivors aren't informed about the existence of NOED and totems in the game.
---
I avoid NOED most games by going for totems when there's 1 gen left.
---
NOW I FEEL SHITTY BECAUSE I DID A DAILY YESTERDAY WITH WRAITH AND HAD SLOPPY BUTCHER ON, I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT ANY ISSUES RELATED TO THAT
---
I LET EVERYONE ESCAPE AFTER I GOT MY DAILY SO ITS OKAY RIGHT? RIGHT???
---
Maybe one day you‚Äôll get better at killer and learn to work around it. But it‚Äôs fine, you can stay in your fantasy land where anything a survivor does is toxic just cause you can‚Äôt get a kill 
---
Definitely won't see the Teacher as a character. The teacher background was taken over by Rin (and Adam, I suppose) while Susie's co-opted the ruler artwork (kinda).
---
Sounds like most Pigs
---
What? Like which? They're all teachable.
---
MINT RAG LETS YOU TELEPORT TO EVERY TRAP ON THE MAP, EVEN IF THEY DONT GET TRIGGERED. TELEPORT COOLDOWN IS 15 SECONDS (THATS THE DOWNSIDE)
---
WORST HAG BUILD YOU CAN EVER FACE IS MINT RAG WITH RUSTY SHACKLES + MYC AND EBONY MORI. THAT SHIT IS NASTY
---
Do that? Yeah.
---
SO MANY CAMPERS RIGHT NOW AGHHH GET GOOD AT THE GAME!!!!
---
I mean at that point people are just playing Nurse or Billy 
---
Ruin for me as Killer - Gone in 60 seconds (or never equipped)
---
Ruin for me as Survivor - Also gone in 60 seconds (Small game is underrated)
---
This is petty and beautiful
---
Yeah pretty much this.
---
It just feels toxic because it feels like the survivor is exploiting shitty game design....and that's because they are.
---
When I first started it used to piss me off but now I realize it's sadly part of the game.
---
Not sure why I carried on playing to be honest because it really is dumb.
---
I think OP does 
---
whats wrong with hillbilly?
---
No one is disputing that.
---
How about Condemned?
---
Ahahaha, I've watched him for a year and still don't know what the fuck he is trying to stay
---
Rng on that map is not great.. I once caught a Laurie right at an exit gate and bc the only hooks nearby were on the lower floor she managed to wriggle free and escape..
---
I WAS WONDERING BECAUSE I LITERALLY JUST PLAYED AGAINST THAT EXCEPT SHE DIDNT EVEN NEED A MORI BECAUSE MY TEAMMATES KEPT SAVING ME AFTER RUNNING UP WITHOUT A CARE IN THE WORLD. 
---
That's some small dick energy
---
Because theirs were the only ones removed, which is what produces the fake Mori stack.
---
[RERU RERU RERU RERU RERU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zZlQ1WSn5U)
---
It goes both ways, you kill a survivor they‚Äôll yell out camper or sometimes lag switcher. But if you pallet stun a killer or use a flash light killers yell toxic. It‚Äôs a constant fight between both killer and survivor mains. Best thing I can tell you is if you‚Äôre not camping and you have survivors whining about it, take it as an extra W.
---
The ONE time I brought a Mori in this event 2 ppl dcd from the start and I farmed with the other 2. RIP my Mori. I like to feel good I guess.
---
Either quit playing or suck it up princess, I'm sorry a bunch of randoms hurt your poor feelings
---
WITH THE MORI THE GAME JUST ENDS EVEN FASTER. UNHOOKING TRIGGERS MYC, HAG TELEPORTS, DOWNS THE RESCUER, THEN THE UNHOOKED GUY. UNHOOKED GUY GETS MORIED, RESCUER HOOKED, RINSE AND REPEAT. IF THE HAG DOESNT FUCK UP, THE GAME IS OVER WITH THIS BUILD AS SOON AS SOMEONE IS ON A HOOK.
---
No, you really wouldn't.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about this meme for three straight days! Thanks for the reupload b/c I couldn‚Äôt ever find it
---
That is why I dodge SWF.
---
Your right had to rethink about what you said
---
[SO SAY WE ALL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3EzRAgjo_s)
---
This is why you wait for the killer to initiate farming. Rather than run up and ask to be hooked like some people do.
---
ya were the toxic ones alright
---
I have been face camped by 6 Myers in the last 3 days if that counts.
---
There are some places you should drop a chase, yes. However if you are already committed to a chase it is actually worse to drop it than it is to continue it.
---
The fact you can sit there and say that the killer should sometimes drop a chase due to a specific loot shows you don't understand how wrong that is.
---
Ruin as a killer: a man's orgasm
---
Ruin as a survivor: a woman's orgasm. 
---
Kate literally got a new outfit a few weeks ago
---
From which movie is this?
---
Well the devs themselves have admitted it's overpowered and they've been looking at ways to rework it so....
---
Maybe one day you'll learn about balance in videogames and stop relying on crutch perks.
---
I bet you cry about NOED too.
---
I may have had one lag-switcher, or maybe even a speed hacker. Not sure. They didn't have Dead Hard or Sprint Burst, so that was the only real way I can think of that they could have continuously out-ran me. My biggest issue with the game is the fact that Self Care can be used infinitely and on other players. At least Decisive has a skill check, and can be fat fingered and fail. Regardless, a good killer is sometimes just that. A good killer. Just accept that, say gg, and move on, ya know? 
---
I think dream master, which ever one (spoiler!) Nancy dies in.
---
Cringe
---
Before the change, adrenaline would be lost completely when un pickup animation, either this is the result of the change, or it's actually not supposed to kick in until the survivor is unhooked.
---
47 on Legion. Fight me.
---
She holds you down while another killer spawns in and takes you out.
---
U sound steamed
---
Lol I love this entitled survivor excuse.
---
Juggling/Dribbling itself slows the killer down immensely and gives the survivors multiple attempts to bodyblock/flashlight save, but regardless the most important part is...
---
It's completely dependent on there being a hook close enough.
---
Comoletely avoidable though! At all times!! Let me just teleport the survivor over to the nearest hook like this guy apparantly does.
---
Btw - Cleanse the totems!
---
In the end I farmed Incase anyone thought I moried them all
---
yes u would. when you host a swf lobby, everyone connects to you. then the game connects everyone to the new host (the killer) and then after the game the killer disconnects and the game can't reconnect you to your friends because it doesn't know that you were with your friends from the moment you joined the killer lobby
---
never met a Pig like that on rank 1
---
Atleast the voices in your head can keep you company.
---
The pig is one of the worst killers in the game imo. I‚Äôd get the shape, he‚Äôs the most fun to play. 
---
I usually loop around the hook a few times, its a no brainer. /s for the dense.
---
Get off my fucking lawn
---
the points are good, no doubt. but I'd prefer a fun game to any amount of bp D: and one cannot have it with the character like Legion 
---
Common... Sense?  Sorry, I‚Äôm not familiar with that cocktail.  Is it served on the rocks?
---
What????? What is this all about? 
---
4 mahn freddeh
---
The blood hunt is almost over, just sharing what I got done in that time
---
The same applies to reverse bear traps.  It‚Äôs always the last box you check and always the first box the enemy checks.
---
And yet through some magic of sorcery, games have *somehow* managed to handle peer to peer parties since 1999! 
---
If only there was... Some sort of middle ground even, like "Leave as group" in the end game lobby or some such?
---
It‚Äôs not on the menu here actually
---
In my last 10 games It was destroyed before I even got a hit on a survivor 
---
You can be my dad, my other dad is still out buying cigarettes.
---
Awesome! 
---
Yeah a lot of shit I can put up with hut the game is an absolute mess right now. This update shouldn't have been put out, the audio especially is fucked up beyond belief but I guess they needed the dlc out on time $$$
---
That jake looked like lag and dead hard to me idk
---
I'm going to save my teammates and you can't stop me
---
You said a man‚Äôs orgasm and my first thought was Lonely Island‚Äôs ‚ÄúJizz in my Pants‚Äù
---
Well done 
---
It‚Äôs ultra rare, I had one, and I barely got to use it. 
---
Im so glad you like it üòÇ
---
Looking forward to your future works
---
why do you want tencent to but out BHVR? seems quite random and in honestly curious.
---
I only hit great skill checks when it isn't Ruin... too much pressure!
---
Not a bad build,but I run Hex:Ruin,A Nurse's Calling,Enduring and BBQ&amp;Chili.You can use whatever perk that suits you as your 4th
---
It works on Ps4
---
r/unexpectedJoJo
---
on ps4?
---
What someone already said instead of me. With spirit its a guessing game which you can lose even when you guess right due to the speed of spirit. Clown gives me fucking seizures and I have to waste pallets and slow vault windows. Freddy Dreamworld is talked about enough, sitting on a gen injured praying for RN Jesus while the killer knows your location is not fun. Pig with rng based power. Many times it does nothing, but on a bad day it can completely annihilate you no matter how much you outplayed the killer. Also the dash is fucking annoying. (On top of it there are memes of her how cute she is, she is not, also tend to be the second dumbest killers after Bubba). With Legion you just wait and take it up your a**. If he is lucky he also puts the game on hold because everyone is mending.
---
A slug applies almost as much pressure as a hook since slugs can't do gens and it takes way less time, as a slugger I run Knockout to increase this pressure even more and often ends the game with 4 slugs, I track them with BBQ.
---
Tunnel each one of them with a ebony mori
---
Usually you don't know, and that third survivor is just bait. Slugging, as opposed to hooking in that situation just buys you time, and prevents them from giving up to let the other person get the hatch.
---
It takes 4 mins for a survivor to bleed out, so at some point in that the other guy usually does what they can to not be a massive dick and heal them, so if you don't sit right on top of the slug you can know where both are at some point.
---
Perks like whispers can help you track down the 4th too.
---
1- Deductive reasoning.  They will either crawl pff into a corner and bleed out to spite you, or they will crawl towards salvation (a teammate or hatch).  Based on how the‚Äôve behaved so far, which do I think is more likely for this particular player?  (Or use deer stalker)
---
2- 
---
3- 
---
Boy you must be fun at parties.
---
In general people have to get off a gen when they want to heal a survivor that you're slugging. And then you can possibly down another survivor while they're healing the other. Using Deerstalker, Nurses Calling, Knock out and Thanatofobia are probably best perks for slugging strategy. 
---
My question is how are you making sure they aren't crawling away to get healed?
---
Purple flasholighto: Za Warudo 
---
Even better when it's Obsession w/ Dying Light and a Tombstone
---
It looked shitty and unfinished and it was a very boring and souless stunfest.
---
The idea was there.
---
The execution was Trappers Mori.
---
I'd be happy with either one tbh. Mike would be fine too.
---
Your butthurt is showing.
---
Thx for explaining that to me
---
Remember the reactions of survivor can heavily depends on how their previous games went. If they have been heavily camped a few times in a row... even a slight patrol can be triggering :/
---
But yeah, soemtimes, you encounter some survivors who just do'nt understand that as a killer you have information on your surrounding (scratch marks, blood stains, whispers or noise...) and that you are not camping them, but just lookign for their "friend" that is hiding nearby. 
---
Same goes for guarding a hook when both doors are opened. Why would a killer even bother to look for the others if he can try to secure a kill ? some refuse to understand that sadly.
---
Well, Im a greedy guts so i just farm bloodpoints every day.
---
Distressing, BBQ, Beast of Prey and Thrill of the Hunt
---
But anything that can keep chases minimal is good, Hex:Devour Hope, NOED, Make Your Choice, Iron Maiden is gold on Freddy. 
---
Then a good perk for finding Survivors are Discordance, Bitter Murmur and BBQ, Whisper for beginner Freddys.
---
Dying Light is a favorite to use just because if it procs you will see the rest of the Survivors DC a lot of the times. Its so funny!
---
RBTs instakill
---
Lol love this baby killer attitude.
---
Run Agitation if you want more movement options. Mad grit is now available to help prevent body blocks. Unnerving presence makes the DS skill check insanely small, survivors will be more than likely to not hit it. Also love how you just ignored the Enduring suggestion so you must not know what it does. Enduring helps reduce the amount of time a killer is stunned, so if said survivor lands DS you‚Äôll be stunned for a short amount of time and be able to continue the chase shortly after. That is if you‚Äôre able to track(there‚Äôs something called scratch marks which will help you btw). 
---
As in for the hooks, many loops have hooks within radius. If someone had DS they become the obsession, you can see this by looking at their player symbol. So if you happen to down said obsession you can take a look around to see if there‚Äôs a hook. If there so happens to not be one, slug them or take the stab. If you pursued the chase so long that all majority of gens got done than it‚Äôs your own fault you gave into the greed of wanting THAT specific survivor. Seeing as you‚Äôre such a ‚Äúprestigious killer main‚Äù by often calling my claims as an ‚Äúentitled survivor‚Äù I would assume you would be able to acknowledge when a loop is being dragged out and you would give up the chase and find a new survivor in order to secure the most kills as possible. 
---
Also nice mention of NOED there assuming I was going to bitch about it? Ha. That‚Äôs adorable. NOED is great and helps add pressure to survivors after gens are done and is a great counter to Adrenaline. I myself playing both Survivor and Killer enough to hit Rank 1 in both for every season, I am aware of which perks to use to help make all my pet peeves avoidable and or punishable. If I hate NOED, I‚Äôve got small game and Detectives Hunch and map knowledge. If I hate DS, I‚Äôve got Enduring and Unnerving Presence and Agitation.
---
Btw - stop being greedy and accept you‚Äôre stuck in an infinite loop!
---
Iron Maiden on Doc, *licks lips*

#PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SHOW US WHO BURNED WHAT SO I CAN KNOW NOT TO FUCK OVER THE PERSON THAT'S GIVING ME FREE BPS. YES IT WILL BE USED TO TUNNEL THE USERS THAT FORCE YOU ONTO A MAP YOU HATE OR BURN A THICKEN MIST BUT THATS STILL A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO DISCOURAGING USING BPS JUST CUZ RANDOM CHANCE IS A CUNT.
---
That's gross as fuck.
---
Yeah, but those are boring, I want more options.
---
Toxic Feng my favorite girl to Mori :D
---
Any ideas for an anti looping perk that would be fun?
---
I just down them again if they get healed. 
---
At that point it's down to just two of them and there are gens to do. The ball is in the killers court. 
---
I think Freddy is a good example, I'm sure people just have no clue how to play him. But like I said it all comes down to who you're playing and how good you are. I am good at Freddy so I get 4k a lot, but clown I am terrible at so I rarely get 2 kills.
---
Sorry not sorry about the ebony mori
---
Well maybe one day you‚Äôll learn just how many perks there are in the game to help you combat your pet peeves instead of bitching and moaning about your lack is skill. 
---
And nah, NOED is easy to counter, just cleanse totems lol. See what happens when you use your brain? 
---
I bet it‚Äôs pretty difficult for you to do that.
---
I'm on console and think console lol 
---
He had to shapeshift into her father, but yeah.
---
I was half hoping this event would show that the game could frankly get rid of any addons above yellow rarity and would still function just fine, but I know it's a pipe dream.
---
Re-balance underpowered killers around the above and the game would be much better for it...
---
I think console has more toxic killers. Alot of kids play console and play this game like a scumbag
---
Rotating is more consistent tho.
---
I'm not a programmer, what makes BP so bad compared to C++?
---
I WANT MORE MEG COSMETICS. I KNOW SHE HAS THE MOST BUT SHE ALSO HAS THE WORST. I WANT  MORE VARIETY FOR HER. 
---
NICE TRY LEGION. YOU WONT FOOL ME.
---
Sorry mate i think you are high
---
And on console, your frame rate progressively drops as the game goes on.. to the point where the skillchecks get fucked up. And if you survive long enough, I find my game just crashes and I get a blue screen error on the PS4 üòÇ
---
Why? Genuinely asking üßê
---
I was gonna say a bit of both,although with message toxicity only difference being (to my knowledge) that with pc you can chat instantly in lobby/match where as console you need to wait till end game normally to be able to see who your facing, and be able to message them.
---
I mean right? G-d Nurses are damn rare and people who play those don't use them very often cause they need to be invested in game 100% of time. it gets boring too. I'd assume most use Nurses when they see swf which is completely legit in my view. 
---
Spirit and Hag also need a full investment in game and lots of practice in order to get good kills on rank 1. even Beads is counterable especially since they added footsteps like Wraith's to Rin so now she's not completely silent. 
---
I'd say Mint Rag can be an op add-on but using it means you only dedicate yourself to going back to the hook, you're limited with amount of trapping around therefore it gets harder to catch survivors since you can't form a web around the map.
---
Scratched Mirror Michael can only do good work on Lery's. too slow and no point in this on any other map therefore cannot be considered uncounterable. even with Scratched Mirror if you're aware enough, you can get away, he slow af. 
---
Nurse has weak spots. with enough practice you are able to have a fun chase. besides, Nurse for any little mistake she might do, gets punished severely. lose pressure for a bit and that's it. I could never bitch about Nurses. yes, they're op, their power. but it's insane how far from each other a regular Nurse and a G-d tier Nurse. to not survive a regular Nurse you gotta be a baby survivor. 
---
Billy's add-ons can be juked around and you still can hide since he doesn't see your heartbeat using his power.
---
all these killers can still be pallet stunned too. and circled around safe pallets. therefore all of them have to have strategy and actually put time in the game in order to be able to compete on high ranks. 
---
no matter your skill in the game the best you can get with Mixtape is a hatch. no matter how skilled the player is behind Legion. unless they were complete potatoes, of course, but I don't count in those cause they'll suck at any killer. 
---
Survivors, having countless tools and strategies, being able to control the flow of the match? Unheard of. 
---
rank 1. really.
---
Where do I sign?
---
True, ranks mean time played, not skill. You can go to rank 1 as survivor and killer with zero perks. It‚Äôs just a matter of time. 
---
Not every survivor knows how to play optimally to bring out the OP.
---
Just like how not every killer can play nurse and 4k in half of their matches. Does that mean Nurse isn't op? Of course not Nurse is broken a good nurse is unbeatable as are top tier 1% of survivors in SWF...Unless you're a god Nurse with omega blinks.
---
Nurse/Billy/Survivors still need nerfs
---
Btw, what do you guys think are the top 8 meta perks for survivor right now?
---
I took a break right after clowns release &amp; I agree. We have more fluidity with perk choices &amp; survivors actually have to do more than gens to "win" their pip.
---
Feels much better than it did a few months ago
---
Again this "crutch perk excuse" with more mimimimi, how about GIT GUD and play with others that did the git gud - _-
---
Get remember me because I will never buy hot trash garbage pile Freddy or save shards, hmm
---
And it means that less than 2 out of 4 escape per game... don't really see your point in fact ?
---
It means less than 2 of the 4 survivors escape on average.
---
Unfortunately it doesn't account for hatch escapes. The percentage would be much lower if it did. I'd say 3 kills is nearer the average.
---
I'm the exact same story. I was considering switching my main survivor from Meg to Nea before, but this new skin was what finally pushed me over. I'm tired of Meg getting shit cosmetics while everybody else gets cool stuff. Now with Nea, I can look cool too.
---
The people making cosmetics are unlikely the ones who are trying to fix the game from a coding perspective, you understand that right? 
---
It's a rather pesronal question, and will depends on what you want.
---
Are you more interested in perks, killer "tier" ranking, fun to play, looks, or specific kind of power ?
---
Regarding perks, it will also depends on if you already bought some through the shrine...
---
It's not about escaping, you can pip without escaping, it's about the broken balance of the game and the toxic behavior of the suvivors in the process of escaping or dying, this statistic meana nothing for people who actually play the freaking game. This is nothing more than another excuse for ASSHOLE suvivors to use to bash the killer even harder - _-, 
---
I have bought absolutely nothing
---
Being sweaty means bringing the best shit with the intent of winning ü§î
---
Me two 
---
Honestly if you were to play properly, you can actually get to rank 1 without perks. It sounds ridiculous I know but it's the truth. Once double BP event is done you'll see more people gen rushing than hook rushing and you'll be escaping more games than currently. I played without perks, it's very vanilla and immersed but it spices up the game once in a while. 
---
A N A B S O L U T E U N I T
---
...This conversation is going nowhere. To be blunt about it, you're just flat out not getting it, and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to not get insulting.
---
The game really wants me to be a dick on Leatherface, got NOED 3 almost instantly and the 40 levels i've pumped into him i got 20 ebony moris.......
---
A win for me is a loss for the other. My goal is to kill as many as a can, at the same time making sure survivors do not pip.
---
It is but you are just contributing to it by this. This is not offensive, but it made for a good chuckle. Cheers, hope you will be happy without this game.
---
Oh and maybe get a better attitude, IRL. 
---
I don't know, maybe just make it so that offering aren't consumed, depipping isn't possible (make everyone get a safety pip, whatever happens ?).
---
Also you have one less gen to do, but the killer also has one less gen to patrol. The snowballing in 3v1 is insanely fast too, and makes it really hard, in an even match, for survivor to have a shot at winning...
---
But i wouldn't be too mad if games like are cancelled, offering refunded, and automatically set you back into another lobby, in fact. 
---
I think I got the most "camper" callouts at 12-17 ranks, which were mostly undeserved. These ranks are, for me, the survivors who already know how the game goes, what they don't like and how these are called in the community, they also heard they should probably call it out aloud. Also, they seem to react highly emotionally to every match, unlike higher ranks? Plus, there is high chance they haven't done any matches as killer, so they totally don't get their POV regarding common callouts like camper/tuneller which are simply legit strategy not toxic behaviour.
---
AND they make such obvious mistakes during match they kinda open the match to tactics they consider toxic. You say tunneler, all right, but when your butt was sticking out from behind the tree while your unhooker have hidden perfectly, should I pretend I haven't seen you just because you went off the hook moments ago?
---
But the story from recently, so a purple ranks team. 
---
I had 3 ppl still alive, 4 gens still to be done, one person first time on the hook, one injured and one not injured. I wanted to go and patrol, cause the uninjured was my last bbq stack to collect. A few meters away from the hook I noticed scratchmarks, going for the hook, so obviously I decided to look around. 
---
Next few meters away, on the other side, I saw both scratchmarks and blood (I was Legion with bloodhound) so it was obvious both players rushed for the unhook from different sides, like, 3 seconds after the hook, so I had all 3 ppl remaining in circle of like, 15m radius.
---
For the next few seconds I swept the area for them, found the injured guy 3m away from the hook, and when I downed him, the last guy went for unhook. I even was facing the hook when I hit the injured guy so I saw clearly during my clean-the-weapon animation he is going for it. Obviously the unhooker got grab-interrupt from the action. easy 4k in the end, not very satysfying though (didn't even have time to do my Frenzy hits daily).
---
So, they didn't seem like swf, and I got 3 separate salt messages (PS4 here) for this situation. 
---
The injured and downed told me I get reported for slugging and tunneling him (whut, he was on the hook once, at least 5 minutes before, I couldn't care less about him then, as I rushed for my bbq stacks to the other side of the map). 
---
The hooked guy called out camping (this one was out of luck there, really, I think he was the only guy who actually did something, gen/unhooks, but he should be angry at survivors for rushing the hook, not me). 
---
The last one also accused me of camping.
---
Since then, frankly, I don't care at all. I have my ps messages turned on, since I have faith in my skill, I also play a lot of surv so I think I know where is the line between tactic/toxic for both sides; I also get too many nice messages while playing killer, I don't wanna pass on that if I turn the messages off to block the salt.
---
Walt a sceonds...
---
Because there are a lot of bad players. If you are not playing a high tier killer, you can not just outplay them and win. You have to wait survs mistakes and kill em with that, so it doesnt feel good. But if the surv knows what he has to do... True talent has a video surviving va a doc calles "five gen chase" or somerhing like that. Check it out...
---
What does it means?? Means that survivors have a certain skill level. If you get it, you will wim 100%, no matter if the killer is 10000 times better than you (scept for high tier killers), and that is op. 
---
Been plenty of camping wraiths with sloppy butcher recently smfh
---
They wear diFFerent pants.
---
I've gotten 13 Iridescent Kings, 20 ebony mori's and NOED 3 on my favourite killers. Game really wants me to be a dick.
---
It sounds to me like you were successful. You helped your team win the match with only one death. Keeping a killer busy an entire match is no easy feat.
---
I find someone, down them, hook them, then use BBQ to find my next target, repeat until the match is over
---
Actually pretty :(( as Nea Main since the Hair is one big abomination and it could have been sooooo cool. 
---
Am rank 1 and almost always play with a lower/ or same rank friend. Solo queue is just meh, since a lot of randoms are bad at time management or dc.
---
I imagine what they're doing to implement dedicated servers. Just think about the code and how its centered around having the killer as host. Its hard to imagine it coming out when they said it will, unless they've been working on it for a while.
---
To problem I see with this is since the queue time s form killer are too long canceling a match would make me stop playing the game. If offerings didn't get consumed they should not go in effect either, as you can just have one offering forever if you're "lucky"
---
NEA looks A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ with Prestige Pants + Head in the new Jacket. 
---
I'd be stoked if they started getting into licenses for game characters. I found that safe head dude from The Evil Within to be pretty damn cool and even better with the DLC that had you playing as him. I'd love to see him in DbD.
---
Nah, that's fine. But what would you should REALLY do is get the other two Survivors and all rush the hooked person with no generators done. Make sure you all go down too, otherwise you're not doing right.
---
\-Totally not the Killer
---
Before giving him UR's they should fix his other add-ons, as far as I'm aware they've been bugged for years.
---
It does take them into account, they make up a significant amount of the player base. 
---
&gt; Survivors are considered OP because those who really know what they're doing, work hard as a team, and try their hardest to Survive WILL survive.
---
Killers have ways to react to this. Camp or tunnel. Run NOED. Mori. Down someone and follow them around til they bleed out.
---
If a killer wants one kill, they are always going to get at least one. 
---
Well they did buff killers and nerf survivors quite a bit since you were gone. So it is understandable ou feel like the game is *more* balanced than what it was before you left.
---
But did you get back to the high rank yet ? 
---
It's not toxic 
---
Yeah the game is in a much better state these days. Most of my killer matches are much less stressful than they were several months ago
---
Im the personification of Play With Your Food
---
Legion outclasses doc in BP?
---
I think people underestimate the chaos of bug-fixing.   
---
Most games are programmes with a lot of math (for example hatchets of huntress are most likely just rectangles, when she throws them the game just looks if one of the coordinates of the rectangle overlap with the coordinates of the rectangles a survivor is made of) and, what often results in bugs,  asynchronous coding, which is summarized the computer doing multiple things at the same time. Just imagine you do a calculation 20 times and it fails only once, the other 19 times everything works fine. Fixing something like this is just a torture, also because it often ends in just rewriting the whole bunch of code.
---
I would rather have BP than cosmetics. I do not care about looking fancy, all I need is my bloody clothing.
---
Modding will never happen.  
---
Those ideas have been brought up a billion times. From giving Survivors distinct passive effects to limiting all teachable perks to rank 1 on characters they don't belong to. AFAIK Behaviour even considered once to do the teachable being locked at Rank 1 in the past, but scrapped that. Making survivors unique I think they just said nope to.  
---
That's why you could buff perks. Also if we have 4x Decisive Strike in game, Killer knows there won't be self mends or sprint bursts so you can adjust game plan (tho I'd say there shouldn't be multiples)
---
NEWS: First DBD player to ask someone out... Asks The Pig.
---
This isn't even funny.
---
There's a couple things I do for DBD.
---
First of all, have a goal beside just "Escape."  There are too many variables when it comes to escaping as a solo survivor. Set a goal that's easier to achieve, like "Complete a generator."  My goal for every trial is "Run a loop, even just one rotation." Second of all, I stop playing if I start feeling bad. If a trial tilts me, I take a break or put down the game for the night.  Lastly, I try to get in the habit of saying "Okay, I went down. What could I have done differently?"
---
Do not compare yourself to youtubers. I watch a lot of content creators, no0b3 monto puppers vooshy to name a few. They have thousands of hours of practice. You can watch them to learn or mimic what they do, but don't beat yourself up if your gameplay doesn't look like no0b3.
---
And, if you can't get to a place where you enjoy DBD, it's not a bad idea to uninstall. There's a lot of people who watch DBD but don't play it, and there's no shame in enjoying DBD as a spectator. 
---
I think the only talent that a tru3 killer needs is every survivor instantly dies on hook 1 and pallets are deleted from the game. So are DH and DS. 
---
hahahaha omg so true
---
I prefer it if you just call my gf  Amanda instead of the Pig
---
If you're launching the game from a shortcut then that could be the cause of the issue. Launching the game directly from my Steam Library fixes this for me.
---
You know what they say, two Rodgers don't make a right
---
Are you on PS4 Pro by any chance?
---
It's funnier and if I win who cares
---
Why would you think modding will never happen? Many game even with paid DLC's sometimes include modding down their lifetime
---
This isn't a game where it's about 'getting salty', when somebody isn't even attempting to comprehend things you're telling them and presenting misinformed information as facts then you stop bothering.
---
The fact that you're trying to boil it down thus just sums up why I'm done trying to explain anything to you.
---
What in the shitpost lmao. 
---
If hatch escapes dont count then this statistic useless. 
---
If everyone sucks, killer is stronger.  
---
If everyone plays well, survivor is stronger.  
---
This game is actually balanced for the average player just fine. The insanely high skill ceiling and the abuse of SWF is the problem. The first problem is not just survivor, but also the killer nurse. The high skill ceiling allows to surpass the maximum of what a mid tier killer can do.  
---
Yeah, don\`t mind the survivors that kill themselves on the first hook to derank on purp-
---
My point is that it is for individual survivors quite clrarly
---
There's always add ons, offerings, and events for BP so I save shards for the other things
---
OFC, my bad
---
My point is that it is for individual survivors quite clrarly. 
---
Tales are told that they exist, you know. 
---
You right toxic dicks play both sides, but this isnt a clear and any meaningfull statistic ! 
---
If he'd been there *just a little bit* sooner.
---
Omg nooo 
---
Yeah, but im not a Game Developer, its up to BHVR.
---
A perk that causes a pallet to stun less and break faster if it has been near a Killer's terror radius for a long time.
---
Add muscular dystrophy as a debuff in the game that limits ability to do vaults and pallet drops.
---
Maybe even adding an offering that decreases number of pallets.
---
There are many ways to solve this to promote other ways of playing the game than Looping.
---
I wish
---
My vote lies with spirit. She's a lot of fun to play and the most fun out of the three for me. People say she's tough to learn but I've not struggled with her really. No idea why. I'm terrible with nurse etc but spirit feels easier to me. The mind game potential is where she shines for me. Stand still at a pallete and wait for them to climb right over in front of you üòÇ. She is slower at 110% movement speed iirc. But her power she is fast and can apply pressure. 
---
Clown comes in a close second. Faster movement at 115%. Bottles are good for slowing and catching survivors and shutting down loops as others have said. But he still feels a touch bland to me. An m1 killer whose power slows the survivors down. Spirits power is much much more fun and different from the rest.
---
Legion.... Well. Can be fun. Can be frustrating. This killer currently relies heavily on add ons to be effective. And then certain add ons can make them kind of overpowered and uncounterable. Without add ons is kind of underwhelming and under powered. Legion is more of a marmite killer. Some hate them some love them. My least played killer after putting some time in with them on release. 
---
Agree, can't play the female legion members for that reason. 
---
Well, I personally would keep my messages on, since finding other kindred spirits who just enjoy the game helps me to find new friends to play with. Hell, most of my DbD friends I met while playing killer. Some of them I was throwing so we could all get some BP, but others were genuine matches that just ended on good terms. 
---
I think a big part of why I take DbD so casually, and other games like League so seriously, is that when I'm playing DbD, unless the other survivors are leading the killer to me, or if I'm just playing killer in general, no other player is going to be able to prevent me from having a good round. It's not like one of my allies going down instantly makes the killer unstoppable like an early kill in LoL does. And, even if it's an unfun match, it's not going to be 30+ minutes of being unfun. 
---
One good advice would be play killer role aswell. This way you will understand how does it look from the other side and you will keep calm when the killer approaches you. Besides, it's good walk on the killer's shoes that way you will be able to juke him and predict his movements.  
---
Man I hope I could still feel the adrenaline and the fear of my first 15/20 hours on the game. Every game was soooo special and scary.
---
Lol at needing all them perks to counter one crutch perk. None of them are a solid counter either.
---
Agitation helps but again you still need to be close to a hook.
---
Mad grit is worthless and a waste of a perk slot, plus it doesnt stop DS obsession bodyblocking as you need to drop them, hitting a survivor in the way wont pause the skillcheck. So you're completly wrong with that.
---
Lastly unnerving...yeah the skillcheck can still be hit, fact is you're still hoping the survivor misses the skillcheck and its all on them and not you.
---
Add enduring and yeah 4 perks to counter 1. Sounds balanced.
---
PC or console?
---
Cause to be fair, I'm on PS4 and that shit works wonders
---
*Fix the game.* 95% of the time it's not the survivors fault that they DC'd. Either game freezes before you get in the game forcing you to force close the game or EAC just kicks you out
---
keep the salt coming hunny xx
---
Right? Everyone praises Sam, but she literally did nothing but save Mike and stand still for a few moments. Without Emily, no one would survive. 
---
Actually, mainly modded games are specifically multiplayer and not sandboxes. Many strategy games and shooters specifically find long life in their mods. But one can dream!
---
Anyhow, I just wanted to propose what if.
---
Spirit with prayer beads and tinkerer is on a whole other level
---
10/10 jumpscares
---
I‚Äôm at rank 6 at the moment, just started climbing back this week. 
---
Jeff gives me clinical depression, so much so that I‚Äôve been running hangman‚Äôs trick. 
---
Right under Billy as the third best killer. A little lower right now though while sound is broken.
---
Hahaha that does not surprise me. I won't run it unless there is 4 Jeff's in a lobby though as you run out of hooks so fast haha
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been doing. If I see 3 or more Jeff‚Äôs I go hangman‚Äôs. 
---
Just one I don‚Äôt mind, and typically I run basement builds anyway.

In all honesty, it isn't about getting kills for the killer. In my eyes, if even one survivor escapes, the killer has lost. Even if you kill the other three survivors, if one escapes, to me, that's a loss. Because, your goal isn't to kill, it's to ensure that no one escapes. Now, yes, you do this by killing, but that's not your goal. Your goal in League of Legends is to destroy the enemy nexus, and you have to kill enemies along the way. That doesn't make killing your primary objective.
---
It's like saying the primary objective of playing survivor is to repair generators. If you're oversimplifying, you're not wrong, but it's not the whole truth behind the situation. What are the rates at which the killer kills all four survivors? Not nearly as high, I'd wager. On a side note, this graph likely includes disconnects, and most definitely includes people who are throwing, which although I myself haven't seen a lot of disconnects (mostly because I'm new) I'm quite aware that the DC rate is kind of frequent at higher ranks. I've seen people DC at the first down, before even getting hooked, on streams and such.

Suspending the game? This happens when the game loads up, This is just first entering swf lobby.

Not true but most of you are blinded anyways, wtf are you talking about ! The Killer hasnt to Kill to win and the suvivors dont need to escape to win !

A WIN IS CONSIDERED UPRANKING ! What means when you pip you win .....

Well right now she is really hard to play because of the broken sounds but assuming that gets fixed relatively soon she is an amazing pick. (BHVR pls I haven't been able to play my favorite killer since legion dropped)
---
&gt; For survivors maybe but for killers wouldnt the extra chance of higher rarity addons be worth it?
---
Some guy here did the math between a P0 and a P3 bloodweb and it's not a really big difference, in fact its not worth the BPs
---
Yes they exist
---
Ahhh fair play. To be fair I just do what my dailies are unless there a nurse or hillbilly as I suck with them. And I mix the builds up to try keep my mind fresh haha
---
That's not really a strong connection, imo. Frank was one of the killers, and (if I remember correctly) isn't too much older than the other three. It's been a while since I've read up on Charles Manson, but I'm pretty sure he didn't personally lay a hand on anyone and was older than the others in the "family".
---
just you
---
I think the dbd team should make her free, because I would like to go up against her more, she's one of the only fun killers to play against 
---
Nea's green hair, it ain't it
---
I remember once when this exact same shit happened, and I was running no mither, she camped me hard with noed. But it was pretty fun to see how bad she was doig
---
I play Bond - Iron Will + Quick and quiet + Dance with me lately and it's fucking amusing. The amount of vault/lockers play that you can make is amazing.  
---
Tbh playing meta makes it so boring to me. I will never run Dead Hard / DS / Adrenaline and those kind of perks as it makes the game a bit linear and plain.
---
LMAO bro, getting a lot of yikes over here.
---
everybody around say we should do something about overpowered SWFs.
---
Is it only me that when I play SWF I derp so mouch compared to solo? :D 
---
It is like I furiously try to depip every time I go with my SWF. 
---
We are 2 red ranks and one purple rank, but that is gained during solo play. 
---
When we gather, our SWF-Power is to derp, make wrong decisions, kill ourselves with communication mistakes or generally spend too much time chatting, not concentrating on the game. Not to mention stupid altruism we wouldn't do in solo match, or lack of altruism cause we communicate enough to know that SOMEONE is closer to do something (not that they plan to).
---
The only overpowered SWF setting may be when we grab our noob 15-20 rank friends, and the killer ends up being of much lower rank than the red ranks. BUT every advantage we could have cause of it is easily nulified by derpiness of the noob friends and the fact that for them, the killer is of higher rank than he should probably play against.
---
also legion is a gang of friends who killed one person for catching them stealing lmfao there's literally no connection this kid has just watched a Manson documentary and is soyboying
---
I got around 40 Ebony and maybe 5 cypress
---
To balance it out I got a shitton of dlc splinters even tho I own all killers anyway
---
Leaving the game suspended somehow messes up instances and this ends up happening. Whenever you don't close the app and leave it un-tabbed for a long time in xbox, that's like suspending.
---
At this point anyway they'd rather directly work on DBD2 than rewrite DBD1. Doesn't make any sense to drop a shit ton of work in a product you won't even sell.
---
I do not understand thr point you're trying to make
---
Sure! Because that's soooo rentable...
---
What if the nearest pallet is there?
---
I used to get palpitations when I heard the killer heartbeat approaching. You get used to it eventually, which is a shame really
---
PC.
---
Overwhelming presence and thanatophobia are kind of meh, I would recommend Sloppy Butcher instead for wasting even more time
---
Not even sure anymore if this is a bug or just an edit
---
Rentable? What
---
Ah well that explains it then
---
AFAIK the entire bug is console only.
---
holy crap I couldn't even spot her. Top left corner lmao
---
1. Not having to wait until tier 3 now means that a killer could get it in their first bloodweb and instead of using other perks and learning how to make do with them, they use an overpowered perk that can completely turn the game around or force survivors to be terrible teammates and simply leave people behind even if theyve been saved by that person all game. It promotes bad teammates unless it is swf. 
---
2. Unless you are swf, finding every single totem is a chore since not only do you have to spend time cleansing 5 totems, you also have to spend time finding 5 spawn locations and running around the entire map. This is a complete waste of time and if the killer is decent then let's say 1 teammate is on a gen, 1 teammate is on the hook on the other side of the map and 1 teammate is being chased. You are letting your teammates down by cleansing dull totems to prevent the use of a perk that may not exist. Not to mention this may throw the game so you never complete 5 gens anyway.
---
3. NOED is a perk that any killer can get at any time. At least with DS you have to either own the Halloween DLC or get it in the shrine before it appears in your bloodwebs. The only time noed can properly get countered without issue is with swf which most killers complain about anyway. This perk basically promotes swf so killers can't really have it both ways. 
---
Have you tried tinkerer with spirit? it synergizes very well with her power and allows you to grab people off gens very easy
---
Typing with the love stick.
---
Look at FPS when Claudette gets grabbed lol
---
I do the same thing too now =_=
---
But none of those are really "fun." I'm just trying to brainstorm more interactive anti-looping perks. 
---
Wasn't me but sounds like something I could have done minus the facecamping. I'm a sucker for a good chase and if I caught you I want that prize lol, I don't care about winning or losing as long as I get what I want out of that trial
---
Manson had tons of orgies with his followers though 
---
( Õ°·µî Õú ñ Õ°·µî )
---
Maybe on console. Hitting perfect skill checks on pc is that easy that unnerving presence does almost nothing against most players
---
lol yeah just do your job
---
I forgot the bathtub one.
---
Also, I don't remember how Kerry got kidnapped.
---
Also, in saw 1, we assume it is Amanda, but it is naver really confirmed, biggets clue we got is that the clothes match
---
ds also sucks, y‚Äôknow, so let‚Äôs just not argue about it anymore, k?
---
I am 9 right now and I have the feeling the killers are the worst right now. In 8/10 games I got killers who dc, camp the entire game or tunnel even when other survivors show up, trying to get the killer of the poor souls back :(
---
it isn't, just a way to escape
---
Unfortunately, it is not. 
---
Is this game official part of the lore? I imagine it is, but it's a shame something like this was not shown in the saw movies
---
Know the map :)
---
look for escape routes always
---
I believe you won't have enough to go all the way from T1 to T3 with any of the Tombstones sucking just one survivor.
---
But he'll fuck his teammate pretty hard that's true
---
One DS vs one downing everyone? It‚Äôs a shit also 
---
so much this...
---
playing SFW yesterday, one of our team member's game crashed once every two games. For no reason. And his game had always been running fine and smoothly up till yesterday -_-
---
She tried to kill Eric Matthews and thought she'd succeeded because he ruined her life. She killed Kerry just because she was in her way, and Tim because she decided he wasn't worth saving for an accident.
---
Even though she was blackmailed into killing Lynn, she was jealous the whole movie, every time Lynn could help Jigsaw and he seemed grateful she did shit like pick up scissors and jam them into her own fingers.
---
Gotta love wraith 
---
LF keeps it at 100% until you release it.
---
As Billy you keep tapping it, you'll get better over-time with that, the most important rev-points are keeping it under 5% and above 90% (-5% for faking revs and +90% to backrev)
---
I guess shape, jumpscare fun etc
---
Same thing here.
---
Yes they are, it prevents overlooping which is the problem, causing survivors to have to come up with new strategies, which is fun.
---
Surv has about 4 and a half pages, killer I think has a few less 
---
Learn from the mistakes :O
---
I DONT want to communicate with people I don't know, solo surv would be even more aids with that
---
Same here. I panicked BADLY. And did run around without thinking but it got better. I now know the maps better and know where to run or what I am good at (often get rid of killers with balanced landing but I suck at pallet looping). So hang in there, you'll get better :) 
---
Damn. Need to add some lag.
---
Plus on Console sometimes the skill check arrow moves faster or slower. It's jarring. Hard to predict too
---
three for me, above Huntress
---
IIRC they said they plan on doing something, but I don't expect much until summer.
---
NOED alone has to be responsible for some of that.
---
We've all seen many of those games where the killer gets 0-2 hooks all game, then turns it into 2 kills with NOED.
---
If you took that one perk out I'm confident the escape rate would rise drastically.
---
ok but consider the following
---
break every totem u see
---
Oh. Thought it was just console side. My bad.
---
I normally dont get to mad as survivor unless my team is incomptent seeriously 9/10 its my team that is the reason i died not the killer
---
SWF players ruin it though.  After you have sacrificed the first person, they tell everyone else to solo the gens for the rest of the game.
---
It'd be a colossal nerf to survivors, and taking away 90% of the builds available would very quickly kill off a lot of the playerbase.
---
Limiting perks to specific survivours would make some arguably much stronger, ie. only 4 have exhaustion perks, Kate's perks are built around using windows but now she can't use Lithe or Q&amp;Q? Also the way you say it, it means they'd have to say "these 2 perks are arguably not great but they're not getting changed to be good or it'd throw off the system by being a good teachable."
---
Limiting duplicate survivors in a server wouldn't increase variation in perks, it'd leave you in a lobby waiting for survivors to drop in and out of the lobby until they find one where there isn't already a Claudette/Meg/Laurie/David.
---
How does it HELP add on reliant killers by taking away 1/3 of their perk options? Which of her perks is Pig shackled with while she loses access to a tonne of perks? What, Nurse is the only killer that can use Nurse's Calling? Real balance changer there by nerfing every other killer.
---
Clown I personally like and his perks are great, Legion is simultaneously weak and broken so you'll pip but may find yourself bored and/or frustrated (it's weird, I know). Spirit is strong, has a great power, has a lot of mindgame potential, and great perks so get her.
---
Killer perks make me a bit annoyed sometimes when it feels cheap, but incompetent survivors are what drive me up the wall.
---
This is why sometimes i dread playing solo. There are so many people like this
---
That's why you should actually buff some perks that are bound to other survivors and killers to the level. Pig could get some completely new perk to help her, same goes for likes of Trapper.
---
There ain't "a lot of builds" available, I play for a week but I constantly see only ~6-7 perks even ran by survivors, unless they are low level.
---
If you could have a strong perk to build around and weaker complimentary perks it would INCREASE build variability because limitations tend to increase creativity, unlike current situation when there is really no reason not to take 4 best suited perks on all survivors, without any roles or meaningful contribution.
---
Thx! 
---
Haha it do be like that, huh?
---
Gotcha. I was around level 35 before. Probably sitting around Rank 12 or so and it wasn't bad. Right now it's like rank 17-16 and my god it's bad.
---
They made it to where it takes longer to heal, so now people are using sloppy butcher to make it even longer. 
---
I was somewhere around level 35 before (on this account, about the same on my other one as well).
---
Wait, what the actual fuck
---
What about merciless
---
If you are in rank 20-15 the survivors yell camper or lagswitcher. They are probably mad they died.
---
If you are on rank 14-10 the survivors yell camper or lagswitcher. There is a 50% chance they are mad or you are actually camping/ lagswitching.
---
If you are on rank 9- 1 and the survivors yell camping or lagswitching, which is very seldom because they don't want to bother, you are probably camping/ lagswitching.
---
But if the survivors starts typing something toxic after they type camping/ lagswitching, they are the ones being toxic.
---
Based on my experience being a survivor and watching countless dbd videos
---
It would increase variability, but they would be nearly universally weaker builds, and the survivor community isn't just gonna sit there and go "oh thats annoying but we'll keep playing."
---
You'd nearly 100% see teams be: Claudette for immersion and self care, Meg for Sprint Burst and Adren, Laurie for DS and David for Dead Hard. It wouldn't be a magic "now everyone will be more interesting and less toxic" It'd just be all round nerfs to what people enjoy on both sides.
---
Ah, I see. Ty bro I'm a filthy casual, lol. Don't keep up with in game changes too much. 
---
FORGET CAMPING HOOK, TAKE FRANKLYN'S AND CAMP AN ULTRA RARE ITEM INSTEAD FOR THAT SWEET SATISFACTION
---
Cute :3
---
You can't use the argument that flashlights are just a part of the game and that even though NOED is a base killer perk somehow it's a crutch. If you've ever been on the receiving end of a toxic 4 man SWF zipping over with flashlights literally every time you pick someone up and don't even have a chance to position you'd understand why killers run NOED to deal with cocky little shits like that.
---
And his nose is a vacuum
---
Server data is on this sub r/kolbeelectroboi
---
I'm noticing a lot more people have dropped self care, which is cool. I never liked the perk much anyway. 
---
Yeah, this is becoming my philosophy too. Killers camp, tunnel, block the basement, etc. if it helps them win. But it‚Äôs not like survivors don‚Äôt have unfun, strong or difficult to counter tools and strategies as well. Some survivors complain when a killer spawns near them and doesn‚Äôt give them a head start, but if they spawn next to Ruin they‚Äôll cleanse it instantly. They complain about tunnelling someone, but if there‚Äôs a just-kicked generator that‚Äôs 80% done they won‚Äôt feel bad about tapping it. And they shouldn‚Äôt. 
---
Both sides have cheesy strats. I‚Äôve stopped complaining about either side playing by ‚Äúthe rules‚Äù because there aren‚Äôt any. If it ain‚Äôt cheating, it‚Äôs fair game. 
---
I think you should stop playing for awhile. If a game is actually having negative impacts on your health, then that's a sign of addiction and it would be best for you to stay away for awhile until you can manage better.
---
That's just gamers in a nutshell. So many gamers are complaining about the most insignificant or miniscule stuff.
---
P3 claudette is the widely agreed on best skin, but it is not better to such a degree that she has an ability nobody else has, just more difficult than others to see if they hide in a dark place. It isn't really comparable.
---
All DLCs can be obtained if you have put the time and effort into the game. You get iridescent shards which you can use to buy the killers and survivors if you have saved enough. It is 7000 shards per character
---
Boi, it‚Äôs a shitpost. It‚Äôs not supposed to be a good meme.

Does anyone know the original artist so I can link them and see more do their work? (*¬¥-`)

---
As a pig main, I agree. Many of her common, uncommon, and rare add-ons are really reliable and pretty good for their rarity. But her higher rarities, you usually use Box o gears and Ruleset no.2
---
(Thoughts on her Very/Ultra rare add-ons)
---
Amanda's letter: is a sin, nerfs your traps massively just so you can see a survivor that's in earshot
---
Amanda's secret: good if you hate patrolling boxes (not the best, not the worst though)
---
jigsaw's sketches: reliant on RNG, but can very rarely screw over a survivor or extend a game longer. (Not terrible)
---
Tampered Timer: good with Rule no.2 but doesn't make a huge impact in the long run alone.
---
Crate of gears/RuleSet No.2: They're good and everyone knows why these are good
---
Unlike other killers, you can't rely on a majority of your very/ultra rare add-ons, they either don't do much, hurt her, or dont do their job well enough.

Add some more, like "stay away", "do this" or something like whistle (if you run behind an injured surv. with a medkit and he won't stop coz he is not looking behind, to let him know). Some would be heared by the killer as well in certain radius. This would also open a new window to tactics (making noise to get killers attention to save injured teammate). IMO, this would add more communication while keeping in spirit of the game. 
---
Yeah! Now how can i easily tell the killer he is a camping tunneling twat that needs to fuck off!
---
Because the majority of people are below-average intelligence (myself included) as well? Not a difficult stat to understand after playing solo survivor for a bit tbh.
---
I can't say I've ever had a game as survivor where I've died and thought that I lost because of anything but my own mistakes.
---
Your caption doesn‚Äôt make sense 
---
XDD
---
I BOUGHT FUCKING TWO DAVID COSMETICS FOR THEM TO END UP NOT WORKING WITH DAVIDS SHIRTLESS VARIANT. IT BECOMES A BUGGY MESS. WTF BHVR I'M THROWING MY MONEY AT YOU AND YOU DISRESPECT ME LIKE THAT.
---
This reads like Charlie Brown about to finally go out there and kick that football for real this time!
---
lmfao that would be epic
---
They could just disable the perk until they fix it
---
CAUGH CAUGH Payday2 CAUGH CAUGH
---
r/karmaroulette 
---
That with the music is really bad. I couldnt even hear the spirit phasing because it was so loud
---
It's a bug.  If you go back to emblem screen and then back to the players screen sometimes it will then let you click on it.  It's weird. 
---
Inb4 the comments about I just wanna message the killer and cry. No I want to message a teammate and say thank God they got the NOED totem before I got hit or gg or thank you for the basement save. At least let me access fellow survivors. Even if it's to tell them they are a ü•î 
---
Beard has it's own funny ways of growing...
---
That is what I used to do as well but now not even that is working &gt;.&lt;
---
WHEN I PLAY KILLER FAIR (LEAVE HOOKS) AT THE END OF THE GAME I GET TEABAGGED. IF YOU DON'T BM THEN SORRY BUT THE BAD APPLES RUIN IT FOR THE REST OF YOU. SEE YOU ON YOUR FIRST HOOK FOR THE REST OF THE GAME RANK 1-5 CONSOLE SURVIVORS!!!
---
Claudette seems to be 50% of the playerbase at times though lol often 2 claudettes per game for me, 1 of which will be p3.
---
Rage quits come because the survivor thinks they're beaten. Disconnects are rare, they wouldn't impact the data.
---
People have been saying that for more than a year.
---
:thinking:
---
Yeah but thanks anyway m8 take my upvote
---
That's one of the survivor's perk.
---
I hate to say it, but accept the fact at the start of the match you are doomed, you are going to die.  
---
It is inevitable, you are sprinting straight toward your death.  
---
Now breathe, if you're worried about getting caught first, hide for the first 30-45 seconds until the Killer passes-by.  
---
Get on a generator and practice on hitting 'good' skill-checks, if you're on console hitting 'great' skill-checks is a bit hit &amp; miss.  
---
Try to ensure you get two gennie's done and try to help by pulling team mates off the hook before they enter the struggle animation, if the Killer is 'camping', stick to doing gen's. Until you get better at loops (which will take a while) there's no point trying to save a hooked survivor who is being camped. It's shitty and I hate leaving people on the hook but until you're better equipped at being able to pull the Killer away and survive a chase you're helping the team more by ensuring the gates are powered.  
---
Surviving longer in chases is something that will become easier in time, but for a new starter it's going to be really frustrating at first. You will need to become more familiar with maps, pallet locations, safe loops vs un-safe loops and distance management.  
---
You're going to come across plenty of terrible teammates and some really smart Killers, but for all the frustration and failure, you'll have that one game that re-ignites your love for this buggy mess of a game.  
---
Good Luck out there in the Fog.
---
I would just like to add to your comment about Iron Maiden.
---
Since OP is a Doc main, Iron maiden is actually a pretty useful perk. A lot of survivors use the lockers to avoid getting madness\screaming. This perk will make them stop using the lockers and get the madness, or continue doing lockers but hiding in them until you are atleast 15 seconds away(wastes a lot of time), or they will get exposed and downed pretty easily.
---
[TLDR; Iron Maiden is very cool and effective on Doc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi5Imxi0WGA)
---
Thanks a lot, Sir!
---
Imo it was a nerf. They nerfed the speed bonus, removed the attack cooldown, but guess what, people can use it a bit earlier. I don't know why people got so mad about it. 
---
thats the problem, not the excuse
---
What!?
---
It works fine.
---
Can you sort the flairs by name?
---
Legion is pretty darn scary in the right hands, how is he considered underpowered?
---
Franks mixtape Legions can suck a bag of dicks.
---
Didn't notice the shitpost flair at first. *sensible-chuckle.gif*
---
The only time a survivor can't find the totem is when they are on the loading the screen. 
---
By this logic then no one can say anything about survivors looping or running decisive because Sally looped the dude for like half the movie and Laurie Strode definitely fought back. Let's give survivors more weapons and be able to escape via random dude in a pick up truck just like the movie.
---
You just want to message the killers and cry. Lmao git gud, baby survivor 2 ez. Using crutches like deja vu and no one left behind,smh my head. 
---
do people really do this? Do the ranks not ever reset? 
---
The lady doth protest to much, methinks. 
---
Selfish viewpoint: I wouldn‚Äôt really enjoy this. 
---
I would have to level up every single survivor to have a decent build just to play with their particular perks rather than unlocking and levelling them on my survivor of choice. That would massively increase my grind.
---
I would also probably be forced to play with characters I dislike just because I want to use the exclusive perk. As survivor I am in 3rd person and see my character all the time, so playing a character I like with the cosmetics I enjoy is kind of important to me.
---
Then also survivors would be a required purchase for just one perk, you can‚Äôt just get it from shrine. Half the internet will immediately use this opportunity and call out the devs for being more and more greedy for money and locking stuff behind a paywall (at least for licensed survivors which you cannot unlock with shards that would be the case, in the case of Laurie and DS I bet you‚Äôll find some people who would call it ‚ÄûDbD going pay to win‚Äú then).
---
I'm not mad idk if that sounds butthurt but that's not the case. Just found the nickname and killer setup combo funny
---
That wouldn't make a lot of sense lore wise, the entity prohibited the survivors from talking while in a trial. 
---
BHVR Guy with fake mustache: "I think the better idea would be to make a new line of cosmetics, i mean thats the only reason people play our.. i mean their game, it's not like we.. i mean they don't care about the playerbase."
---
F
---
TELL ME ABOUT IT!  THE NECTAR COSMETICS WERE COOL AS FUCK, SANTA CLOWN IS PERFECTLY DISGUSTING, AND THESE NEW ONES.  WOWOWEEWAH. 
---
Don‚Äôt you be spending l all those shards in one place now. How about 2 nice cozy sweaters.  
---
I will try not to, its just really annoying that the only way I can escape is by not getting chased because as soon as I do I get hit on ground within 10 seconds
---
One thing I thought about for WGLF would be to make it a Reversed Make your Choice. You instantly heal the unhooked person one health state, but in exchange you get the exposed debuff for 30sec or a minute.  
---
That way it sticks to the theme of David sacrificing himself for his friends, the perk would still encourage positive gameplay (safe unhooks, less tunneling) and be a useful perk on top of just giving BP.
---
Imo she's 3rd after Nurse and Billy. She has the mind game potential, map pressure and her power helps her in chase. Sometimes I would even put her in front of Billy, but that depends on the player. 
---
Why? If self care takes one person out of the game for 32 seconds and healing someone else takes two people out of the game for 16 seconds each that nets the same amount of time not being worked on gens.
---
We were talking about who the new killer would be right before they announced Legion. I mentioned it would be cool to have a wendigo from until dawn and we realized the Hag is pretty much what a wendigo would be like. So I guess we already have one in game sorta
---
You‚Äôre absorbing all his good luck
---
I am going to try this next time im on my pc. Thanks for the advice.
---
So you consider healing in general a waste of time? Healing yourself with Self Care takes the same amount of work off gens compared to someone healing you because two people are busy for half the time it takes to self care, so it nets the same amount of time not being worked on gens.
---
4 hours 45 mins
---
THE WRAITH IS SERIOUSLY THE NEW CAMPERFACE.
---
Too true. He gets so mad as well. ......He‚Äôs like oh of course you fucking get the tin can of your head first try ya twat. Why can‚Äôt I just remove it from my head. Where is the keyhole. So many questions. God he‚Äôs so funny
---
If you hover over you bloodpoints it will tell you
---
Same. I've had games where I literally b-lined straight to my totem and it still got destroyed before I even got there.
---
Nope. The tips. THE GOD DARN TIPS
---
"Just because somethings sounds true doesn't mean it is". You're completely wrong in that aspect, and yes, I consider healing yourself a big waste of time, if you get hit you're either going down or run the killer until adrenaline, or they leave you and chase someone else so you can do gens and get adrenaline, and getting healed by an ally and then going on gens wastes less time an self-caring. If I feel that I need to heal myself during the match I just bring a medkit. 
---
I don't have access to turn it on right now.
---
Ahhh fuck
---
Guess I ain't sleeping then
---
Great idea btw. A craftier killer, as opposed to the other killer's ,"Charge them till they're dead!" Style.
---
The major flaw with this though is Survive with friends players using discord or Skype. 
---
"Hey man, thanks for helping with this gen!"
---
"What? I'm at a totem, what are you talking about?"
---
"Oh, guess I'll run then."
---
She looks like if Tommy wiseau dyed her hair green.
---
But she's got them red sweatpants 
---
Shit, got me there. 
---
Everytime
---
Survivor main over here, don't really understand the negativity others have. End of the day the killers objective is to kill all survivors and if that means the killer watches me while I'm on the hook so be it, it just gives the others more time to repair and escape. We all have different tactics and styles and that's what makes each game great.
---
She doesn't just strangle people in the mori; small jerky movements of the hands and arms at one point to so far as to suggest the snapping of ones neck.
---
As a game developer myself. i get it. fix one thing break 9 others. i get it.   
---
But with time you do fix the other things. and sadly it just isnt the developers initiative to fix the goddamn bugs. because the only bug they'll most likely fix is anything wrong with the shop/store
---
Im on it. Mod in a bit. expect a game ban though.
---
[Source](http://stern-0125.tumblr.com/)
---
Really? I didn't know that
---
I never said that the game should be balanced around that. I said that's how I consider winning as a killer. Technically, if you want to be 100% accurate, there literally is no winning. There's just those that get points, and those who don't. 
---
&gt;We want the CPU to work less but still reach the same end result. We will thus be converting a lot of existing code from blueprint scripting to C++ to achieve this.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/36658/tech-efforts-unreal-engine-optimization-dedicated-servers
---
Yeah Ive honestly played less this week than ive played in a while. Used to be my main game but everyone is so toxic or plain dumb
---
Yeah, I see what you mean :I
---
I guess this has a lot more Cons then Pros
---
I had a 6 game stretch where it was gone in well under a minute.
---
Fair enough
---
A non toxic survivor that isn't in a match where the killer threw? Unheard of. Proud of you bud! 
---
I said "every once in a while" lol. I'm not out here fucking around every game. But I paid money for it yeah? I can play how I want. 
---
Also. I found the salty survivor main üòÖ
---
It may be much easier, but it includes useless motions and seems to be more likely to mess up the controller if you use the force of god.
---
You can cancel it? Even at full chatge?!
---
such a fun and immersive game experience right there.  I bet whoever is playing that killer had the time of his life in that game
---
I think 3 minutes and 55 seconds would be more balanced.
---
I am p2 and 500k bp. I wanted to get 1 mil and prestige...but sleep calls me.
---
I was just about to say: He/She is probably a killer main who runs NOED. 
---
Nancy looped him for 2 films, so he tunnelled her letting the other 3 escape.
---
All in a day's Google search
---
Me three
---
I hope they plan to fix it. You're right though for sure
---
yeah from you lmao
---
True I wear that blue jacket with them

It's almost like ASMR to me it's weird. 
---
I know this is a shitpost, but atleast people wouldn't be using moris on the nurse anymore. Her just strangling the survivor for 4 minutes sounds hilarious
---
Noone makes endgame hence mid
---
I like your hook.. I think I will 
---
#TAKE IT!
---
the only cosmetics worth getting is the harajuku collection and her sweater... they keep doing her so dirty 
---
Tackar tackar!
---
I miss when you click on someones profile and see a wall of "- rep camper" "-rep camping noob" "-rep go die of cancer camping cunt".
---
I wondered why anyone would allow randoms to comment on their profile when they get that, guess they keep the wall of salt as a badge of honour though.
---
Have to say though, those comments were always true.
---
Nancys sketch and uni block not really high range and lessens time to be put to sleep
---
Yeah that's more what I meant. It feels like the game is straining under the combined weight of all the bugs they haven't fixed to this point. I find myself playing less and less killer ever since that damn chase music bug appeared, and less survivor since the chainsaw noises became borked. And I can't remember the last time I played billy without needing to do a daily because the phantom hits feel so  shitty and seem to happen at least once per match.
---
Like I get that they need money from cosmetics and fixing bugs generates no revenue, but for the long-term health of the game they really need to address these things. Especially the console frame rate. Jesus how has the console frame rate not been fixed yet, it looks like ass.
---
Fuck. I can‚Äôt top that 
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight?
---
Salty 
---
ye, but this doesnt work on PC ;)
---
No one can stop you from using discord 
---
Because when you‚Äôre the one in the hook watching all 3 teammates self caring in opposite corners of the map, you realize just how annoying it is. 
---
I haven‚Äôt run self care in about 6 months. And I actually don‚Äôt miss it at all. Being full health 100% of the time is overrated. 
---
If we didn‚Äôt have stupid people, what would we have to laugh at 
---
add  a mute Button as well
---
If half of your perks are end game perks that never get activated, you don‚Äôt have a mid game build. 
---
Mute Buttons 
---
I like the idea of the whistle. 
---
Yiss. Oink needs more. More oink. I'm a hardcore pig main but I've been playing more Michael because Pig feels weak af in comparison... Poor Amanda.
---
Pretty much.  I've noticed that people who say he's the worst killer in the game stack blocks on him and then call him a worse Wraith.  Like, you're playing a killer who's power pretty bluntly acts as a stall, yet you're just standing and waiting for one person to fall asleep.  If you play Freddy like Wraith, yes he's the worst killer, but the same applies if you play pretty much any killer like you would someone else, because each killer has a unique kit with their own ups and downs.
---
Mmmmmmmmmm
---
Hopefully you know a joke. ;)
---
i hate u :(
---
Crouching is fine, it's using the ambush attack that makes her difficult to play. If all you do is sneak everywhere, and use line of sight breakers to hide your approach, she's a jumpscares goddess. 
---
honestly my goals
---
Of course I do :)
---
Used to try and wear a sock on the hand to aid against the peeled skin. Never worked!
---
I don't have a problem with the fact that bugs are introduced with new patches, that happens with all games. But the volume of big, gameplay-affecting bugs combined with the low rate at which they're fixed has caused them to pile up. And the amount of bad bugs in the game now has really affected my enjoyment of the game; being able to hear survivors is kind of important, but I can't do it when the chase music is so god damned loud. And aside from the bugs, how long has the console version gone un-optimized? It's so choppy it makes my eyes hurt. The game just keeps getting more and more broken and the devs aren't keeping up with the breaks.
---
I hope Spirit gets some new cosmetics soon. Aside from her retextures, she only has one outfit and there‚Äôs so much potential for alternate looks for her. I really want a Samara-inspired costume. 
---
girl did you even read the post first? they dont want to always run it because its unreliable but they get stomped without it
---
I mean that virtually all of them run it all the time. If some thing is that prevalent it points towards a core issue that needs addressing. 
---
I mean that you HAVE to use it not to get completely fucked.
---
With what time? Usually they all pop simultaneously anyway and then if he does drop the chase he still lost that time. The deck is heavily stacked against him from the get go. I play mostly survivor now because it‚Äôs the control roll which is probably not suppose to be the case
---
Very nice! 
---
On a sidenote, doesn‚Äôt it seem kind of silly for a grab interrupt followed by a drop to result in a survivor being in a downed state? At least have the killer powerbomb them or something so it makes sense!
---
Then they should also make it so that you get 25% extra bp per unhook and new survivor hooked and rework wglf so I am not forced to use bbq just to reduce the grind. 
---
Exactly, just like Tyde said "Hag is bad" but doesn't use traps
---
r/lazy
---
They're alright.  They definitely have a place in his add-on kit, but the problem stems when they just stack blocks and call him a worse Wraith.  Extra points if they tunnel one person down all game.
---
I‚Äôm hoping to go to London Comicon as Legion
---
Right on.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want Ace‚Äôs teachable‚Äôs infected everyone else‚Äôs blood web.  
---
It‚Äôs more a completion thing, I‚Äôd rather not have Kate‚Äôs, Quentin‚Äôs or Tapp‚Äôs either but my Claudette has almost every perk available at max now 
---
I HAVE LITTERLY BEEN MORI'D 13 TIMES IN A ROW
---
mother fu-!!
---
ive played against a lot of killers who dont run ruin and have completely dominated our games.  
---
Prayer beads, ew.
---
Main the Nurse and rekt them. 
---
Your arguments are based on emotions or directed towards healing in general, not self care in particular. 
---
People with the name dimwit. *waves* 
---
*Cries in Console*
---
What trophy?
---
Even if I hate a survivor proxy camping is better since it still let's me do something before they die
---
I once spawned Next to the totem. So literally 16 seconds of ruin. Rip Killer. He immediately left
---
tfw PC Players talk about 30FPS being a bad dip
---
Seriously I see no reason this game shouldn't be 60FPS minimum for console or PC
---
And that's why balanced landing rains supreme...
---
Care to elaborate? I think at least one Meg in the team makes sense. I wouldn‚Äôt choose her first! 
---
What if you HAVE to run all his perks.....?
---
Coding and art teams don't work on the same things
---
I‚Äôve found Bond is a fantastic counter! And you will heal faster/more points for the team. 
---
Do you like his perks? I haven‚Äôt unlocked him yet honestly. 
---
claudette - increased healing speed (self and others)
---
meg - increased exhaustion recovery
---
dwight - increased repair speed for allies
---
nea - increased movespeed while crouching
---
jake - increased sabotage speed and chest-searching speed
---
ace - increased luck
---
what else?
---
keep in mind that these will all be very minor bonuses and not incredibly game-changing. just small buffs to differentiate the survivors.
---
what could be interesting is if these survivors changes were paired with an overall update that also changed killers and granted killers the same sort of minor passive bonuses or slight changes to them to balance them out.  could be a good opportunity to re-balance the game and give some weaker killers a boost.
---
"the re-awakening update"
---
Playing around the rules of the game. I like it! I did say no items, but nothing against finding them. 
---
Even if you are required to run ALL his perks?

Don't waste your breath the other guy has no idea what he's talking about
---
grats dude. I only started playing a week before the legion update and hit 9 last night. I hope I don't derank that much once the event ends
---
Art and coding teams aren't the same people so how about you stop bitching about things you don't know about
---
Show that clown who's boss!
---
Sure. On ps4 it's just pressing R2 while revving the chainsaw. You can also cancel huntress' hatchets this way. 
---
Rank 8 was your end goal?
---
You should know what you don't know. How the hell am I going to know what you know and don't know. Just ask for specific terms or search.
---
I JUST BOUGHT THE COWBOY HAT FOR JAKE PARK FOR NEARLY 8000 IRIDESCENT SHARDS INSTEAD OF SAVING A BIT MORE FOR THE SPIRIT BECAUSE MEME VALUE BUT NOW I AM QUESTIONING MY LIFE DECISIONS! ALSO FUCK DS AND NOED!
---
Doesnt help survivors in any way dont you have anything better to do
---
What did you do to the other david ?
---
Newish to the game (specifically hexes) does it stop working when only one totem is destroyed
---
When you use the term ‚Äúbaby _______‚Äù, you‚Äôre basically talking about someone who isn‚Äôt very good at the game and/or makes rookie mistakes. Some examples are a killer that gets looped for 20 minutes or a survivors who sneaks around without doing anything.
---
hopefully
---
Ew? Prayer beads are awesome!
---
I mean, it would make sense given her motivation. Unlike John Kramer, Amanda wants to use traps as punishment, not as an attempt to make people rehabilitate.
---
As a killer its so hard, I only hit on prediction. What bonerfart thought 30fps was an ok goal? 
---
Yep I had this issue around the time you posted. Took forever and then when one would finally load....it would be a 300 ping
---
I love it, just crawling on the corner lol
---
Crraaaaaaaaawwwllinggg iiiiiinn mmyyy ccrraawwwwllll
---
yes, I personally don't have a problem running no mither
---
OP do you have original image without text? 
---
Yup it now seems to be back to normal though thankfully
---
What kind of trophies
---
yes
---
Lol literally nothing 
---
haven't used it yet on doc, so i had no insight on how well it actually worked with him :) thanks !
---
The base healing nerf and sloppy butcher buff really helped Freddy with that, but rng is still rng with the skill checks. And I agree about him already being mid tier for me. I was reluctant at first to even get him, but I have fun with him and he is average for me in terms of viability.
---
Imgur link please? 
---
oh look, another person because other people aren't doing what he wants them to do
---
it also is because most nwer player level up first because of self care, and end up prestiging her because first girl = best girl...
---
I like running hex totem roulette with prayer beads and the yakoyuke amulet and sometimes I throw a mori on it to be toxic
---
But normally I‚Äôd run ruin, bbq, nurses and another perk (usually either enduring, spirit fury, devour soap or haunted grounds)
---
However sometimes I run bbq, ruin, enduring and spirit fury so I have a good balance of tracking, antilooping and slowing the game down just a little bit.
---
Over this last week I‚Äôve gotten about 17 teachables unlocked from grinding, so once I‚Äôve got all those perks and levelled them up imma start experimenting with different fun perk builds!
---
I got my million last night and plunged it all into her once I went p3 it‚Äôs too satisfying 
---
IF YOU SEE ME STRIKING A GENERATOR WITH MY WEAPON IT MEANS I WANT YOU TO DO THAT GEN AND I'M LETTING YOU DO IT. STOP RUNNING AWAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP. THE HATCH HASN'T SPAWNED AND THERE ARE NO GENS OVER THERE. BUT I'M LETTING YOU GET FREE BP DURING THE DOUBLE BP EVENT. PLUS I PLAYED BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS. AS DOC I KNOW I'M GETTING MY BP. GET YOURS TOO.
---
message me 
---
Thank you! 
---
Don‚Äôt chase us neas we‚Äôre toxic
---
But... that's a good escape rate. I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but the killers should be stronger. Survivors shouldn't escape often, it should be a pretty rare thing. The way i see it, the killer in a game like this should be strong, escaping right now is actually a little too easy, i think. I am by no means saying that the killer should win every match, but that escape rate is pretty great. A 40% escape rate for individual survivors is actually really fucking good
---

*oh god*

Yeah. Imagine that.

Oh, I can have a whole montage on neal. I know lol

hey

i love tapp's perks :(

OOTL, what's going on?

DO YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR SHARDS TEMPORARILY OR IF THEY WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE FOR SHARDS

But it does generate revenue.

\&gt; no ones buying the game/recommending to friends

\&gt; no ones buying cosmetics anymore.

Bad developers get moneystruck and greedy. it ruins games. Look what happens to FO 76 and evolve and 9010283749081728309470912734 other games. Devs need to stop and pay the fuck attention or get shit on by the next hot game comming out.

What about Pudge from Dota2 with hook.

Tuft actually slows down stalking because you get it permanently when you pop ew3. I like running totem perks with thrill of the hunt and you can pretty much know what totem they are at to help you find them for a good stalking. 
---
Blood on your face. 4 kills in one match.
---
Strange I got down voted but oh well. 
---
"Ope, don't mind me, just gonna sneak right past ya and grab the ranch..."
---
Toaster toaster
---
Because there is other ways to kill survivors than just camp and make it fun for nobody but as survivor there is nothing else you can do except loop the killer once you‚Äôre found
---
I prefer gamer grills. Make some tasty food while playing, what's not to love?
---
Probably if you don't restart your system on console long enough you can have fixed 15 FPS?
---
Honestly the Devil May Cry style was the whole reason I bought it, was just disappointed to find that the gloves have all the green lines on it I assume to match the sets hair.(which is dumb) I would have preferred them to be all black like I initially thought they were. 
---
Mewtou
---
You get 4 goes. 
---
Its just so OP atm
---
Same 
---
The joke. I think you missed it, friend.
---
Only reason to go to rank 1 is for the trophy. After that, it isnt qorth it xD
---
I look at a loss this way, if there are more than 3 gens left I genuinly lost, but anything below 3 then I consider it a mild victory lol. All depends on how much exp I get. 
---
The number of games this happens to me is ridiculous. 
---
Considering you're going against ghosts most of the time, wouldn't Spirit fulfill that, in the same way that Legion is kind of ghostface from scream?
---
It is OP at the moment but any changes would make it useless and near impossible for getting the blood on your face achievement
---
Adrenaline and sprint burst are both meta perks. Quick and quiet is very strong as well. I dont think any other survivor has 2+ perks that are so strong.
---
Latest way to nerf SWF
---
I played about 10 matches last night.  In 9 of them ruin did not last more than 30 seconds.
---
Hexes are such garbage.  There has to be a better way...
---
Oh, I did think it was weird that blood kept going even after healing

This is the problem. Most of us aren‚Äôt trying to maximize blood points. This event is just giving me more points for what I normally do. I‚Äôm not changing my play style because it‚Äôs double bp. That‚Äôs what the other stupid events are for. 
---
Meg - Unlimited Sprintburst (lul)
---
He got noed beware lol
---
Technically Leatherface is also in MK10, and Freddy is in MK9, so.... :)
---
But it would be great to see some of these other sources being used for killers and survivors.
---
No it wouldn't. Just make it so you can only kill 2 survivors. Already nerfed and still not pointless. You're clearly as killer main.
---
I got the achievement using Devour Hope with hag.
---
This is so sad. Alexa play Despacito 3
---
this literally happened to me and my friends last night. KIller messaged my friend 
---
I feel the same, knowing that you have to maintain the ability to be chased whilst having to stay out of line of sight makes the chases feel much more fresh and unique
---
Yes
---
I'D LOVE TO USE SLOPPY BUTCHER, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT CAUSES GAME-BREAKING VISUAL AND PERFORMANCE BUGS ON PS4 AND PEOPLE D/C OR LEAVE ALMOST EVERY GAME BECAUSE OF THIS SHIT
---
47 iridescent hatchet heads on Legion? Neat.
---
Yeah, as Zonino said it‚Äôs a pro wrestling thing. Also correct that I‚Äôm joking, but I do think a person dropped after just being grabbed should be able to get up. They aren‚Äôt even injured.
---
Hey, don't forgot the honorable mention Haunted Grounds! Sometimes they sub bloodhound for it if they have Ruin.

Don‚Äôt forget object of obsession
---
Doesn't excuse it. It's garb.
---
Me and some of my friends are getting together tonight for a session, so we could help you practice on KYF. Keep in mind, outside of one of our guys, we primarily main killer(I really just play survivor when my friends and I get together to just have a good time lol), but it would give you some practice with judging the distance for your blinks.
---
That would be awesome. I have many ideas for this...
---
For Freddy prestige 4 - survivors are dragged down into a pit. A geyser of blood erupts from the pit and showers the surroundings.
---
Another could be a Mortal Kombat- esque fatality. Or maybe a Jaws shark attack dragging them off the hook and eating them. The possibilities are endless!
---
Of course 
---
I turned off my system and started the game back up. The bloodweb reset for me but I lost my bloodpoints on what I upgraded previously. 
---
I will use them to slow games down, but that is about it. I will usually only bring an ivory 
---
Okay. So even though I spend BP on some stuff, it will reset?
---
They really could do a different one for each killer. The fatality comparison is perfect for what I was thinking. The big payoff after a game well played was always my favorite part of MK. Can‚Äôt even imagine what it would add to an already addictive DBD.
---
My guess is that OP got "Ace in the Hole" from the Shrine. My Meg was at 35 forever for the same reason -- got Adrenaline from the shrine &amp; moved on after I got her to 35.
---
I‚Äôll do this from time to time and try to 1 for 1 with you. Usually only if the hooked meat bag is in struggle though. 
---
Cool looking really cool love legion if anything any tips how u made your masks? 
---
its a swap but it revolves around the same set up lol. 
---
Not too many bugs on XBOX One-X for me. Are you on PC?
---
Only as much as a bunch of killers fill the dude-with-knife niche tbh. Spirit is the token J-horror killer but she's very different to someone like, say, the Kusabi from Fatal Frame. As long as they don't randomly choose Kizuna Himuro or Limbo Woman they'd be safe enough from Spirit comparisons imo.
---
I felt such a sense of completion after I got all teachables unlocked, good luck! Almost there!
---
Nea 
---
The "Dead By Daylight News" thing killed me
---
That‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôs supposed to be.
---
Objct of obsession, no mither, stake out deliverance build
---
He doesnt need a buff
---
Eh, it's a way of playing I guess. Should be easy to beat if you gen rush. Sucks for the guy cought first tho.
---
You can get a lot of points of that from a losing game. Survivors love to sit at the exit dancing by the exit line to taunt you, if you play huntress, just stand back and throw hatchets, often they will just run back and forth playing the shooting game with you. I was able to get a lot of people down like that, even though I didn't actually hook any of them.
---
As long as you buy enough and the entity takes enough nodes it will go to the next bloodweb. 
---
THEY FUCKED UP THE AUDIO MIX SO BAD THAT THE TRAPPERS TRAPS DONT SNAP WHEN DISARMED. I MISS MY SNAPPY SOUND.
---
Swedish fish? üêüüêüüêü
---
hey why don't you openly link to it?
---
scared or something?
---
I actually really like Ace's perks. When someone is P3-50, all perks, it's just a matter of item hoarding, and "Ace in the Hole" helps a lot with it not just being 400 green keys.
---
Also I like using "Up The Ante" in a build with stuff like Leader &amp; Streetwise to be the super-helpful teammate sometimes.
---
I just want input from others on whether I'm just super unlucky with my games and players I get, etc. :) Also, I can't just post a question or I'd break the rules
---
Exactly! This has been my experience from ranks 10-5 so far.
---
I mean killers have mori's and iridescent too so survivors can have insta heals too.
---
Thanks for a detailed response! :) Yeah, I guess there are going to be weird plays and everything wherever you are in the ranks
---
I should depip then
---
Play Killer...I learned more from playing killer than anything else...then you just replicate what you see when you get shit on.  After a while you will catch on and learn the spots that are really good for running the killer.
---
Lol facts
---
Well we rekt him as you can see he did 13k. He got only one kill as expected, which he had because of noed which is kinda sad considering he was playing Leatherface lmao. 
---
Shia Labeouf
---
I said toxic survivors 
---
Because stake out requires you to be in the terror radius
---
Yes he does. He is one of the weakest killers imo because his power doesn‚Äôt help in a chase.
---
S a t i r e
---
How dosent he. Although he is stronger than he once was he still has trouble with loops and is very addon dependant. Most killers are still significantly better than him.
---
The cosmetics cost the same by rarity, but it still sucks that they made it sound like they'd be free.
---
You've got a ps4 pro don't you?
---
Your cosplays are so awesome :) nice job! 
---
You def should consider making a lil shop to profit off your crafts ! O:
---
No, if you don‚Äôt MANUALLY CLOSE the game, it‚Äôs still open. If you tab it out for enough, it will pop the ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù message on ‚Äúboot‚Äù. Even if your Xbox is off, unless you MANUALLY closed the game, it‚Äôs suspended.
---
Ty 
---
You're very welcome!!!!!
---
We don't even the whole story. OP might have been a cunt to that David earlier.
---
Remove deliverance. Bigger pp if you don't get hooked. 
---
I‚Äôd just like them to fix the running window jump, I once made a straight run at a window, and I crawled through.  It really makes me mad, as both a killer and survivor for this part of the chase mechanic to be completely screwed up because of the 2.5 meters clearance ‚Äúfix‚Äù.
---
Though let‚Äôs be honest, there‚Äôs a lot of things I want to see fixed or added beyond the window issue, but will probably never happen.
---
They didn't, people just assumed.
---
Why do you assume I'm a kid?
---
Honestly, play killer. It can be frustrating sometimes but it is much easier and less stressful than survivor. It also gives you another view to improve your survivor gameplay from. 
---
When I first started, playing killer was single handedly the best way to improve my survivors. It sounds counter intuitive but it worked. 
---
*CLEARS THROAT*  TODAY I GOT A RITUAL TO MORI SOMEONE AS THE NURSE WHO BTW IS MY MAIN SO RNG DECIDED TO SCREW ME OVER NOT ONCE, BUT FUCKING TWICE, ***TWICE***. FIRST, I FINISHED OFF A BLOOD WEB ONLY TO FIND THAT THE GIFT BOX THAT I DIDN'T OPEN HAD A **GODDAMN EBONY MORI**. THE NEXT BLOOD WEB, I GOT A CYPRESS MORI AND TOOK IT INTO A GAME BUT LO AND BEHOLD I GOT **FUCKING COLDWIND FARM WITH A FOUR-MAN SWF.** ***JUST. FUCKING. AAAAAAAARGHTWLLLV8Y9 EBIAKN HQQQQVWK97TNHUIJMB4WY*** 
---
i play survivor aswell and i get them all as fast as i can as many times as i can, no mercy. it's deeply annoying to play vs toxic survivors , which most of them are. so its satisfying to kill them all in any way possible, they make your killer life hell 
---
That's my biggest issue too. I desperately want to make the switch to PC. But I fucking hate that you cant transfer your account over or purchasables. I'll already have to buy the game again. And that means every killer (except LF fuck Bubba) and a lot of cosmetics that I wear too. I have so many perks from Shrine too, that I would have to grind and reunlock, not to mention represtiging and unlocking all the perks I had. Ugh. With the game In the shitter right now it's not even worth it. 
---
Never had this myself, but from what I've heard it's a visual bug. The lines aren't showing but the nodes are connected. Move to a connected node and the next should light up and be obtainable as normal.
---
ill take that as a no
---
Legion is so great for farming man
---
I do the token perk because there‚Äôs no better feeling than getting 4 tokens and using the brown toolbox to trigger 4 skill checks in rapid succession for a quick and easy gen completion.
---
Insert my head under the taps trying to drink straight from the machine because as broken as some killers are, I'm lore-wise so in love with them and wanna dress them fancy.
---
I looped him for 3 gens, escaped,  piped up, and did twice as much BP as this guy so really I'm not. He didn't even get a M1 swing on me, he just killed one guy with his noed and he couldn't even use his mori. I just found this name / killer / setup funny enough to shitpost here.
---
about 1 Abs a half hour
---
I‚Äôm nervous i won‚Äôt be able to but enough due to the lack of lines connecting. 
---
Maybe the other survivors could pass skillchecks while she‚Äôs doing the mori in order to beat the shit out of her and kill the killer
---
Yeah, I‚Äôll check that out as soon as I get back on
---
Self Care , urban evasion, either lithe or balance landing and adrenaline
---
That has nothing to do with NSFW
---
I don't think that can possibly be true. If it can't run the whole game at 60 fps consistently, how could it run the whole game + a skill check at 60 fps consistently?
---
DEAR SURVIVOR I MAY HAVE ADRENALINE, OR SELF CARE AND RESILLIANCE AND AM 99ING MYSELF, OR A MEDKIT THAT HEALS ME FASTER THAN YOU DO, ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. STOP TRYING TO FARM HEALING ME FOR POINTS IF I AM NOT GOING TO YOU FOR HEALS AND DO GODDAM OBJECTIVES.
---
Balanced + Urban! Just different play styles though. 
---
Yeah, unless a noise notification comes up, and you know if you have DS.
---
Everyone has their own interpretation of what 'waving' on the hook means.  
---
Newer players believe 'waving' on the hook means, "it's clear, come save me".  
---
For older players its means, "Killer is camping, DO THE GENS".  
---
I didn't get to hear the audio, if there was no TR that cheeky monkey was using Insidious.  
---
But if there was a TR. Man, when you know its LF and his TR is near the hooked person, duck out get Gen's done.  
---
At least Laurie had BT, a noble sacrifice.
---
Are you kidding? Im on console too and there are way too many bugs. Survivors slide everywhere, trapper cant pick up trapper survivors, wraith with sloppy butcher makes survivors gush blood forever, game randomly crashes, sometimes killers get stuck when trying to grab a survivor, when a survivor is carried the aura reading glitches out, the pig can hear her jigsaw boxes globally... etc
---
Known bug. Out if the many bugs in the game rn
---
I REPORT FOR EXPLOITS WHEN THEY DO
---
Tombstone and Fragrant Tuft both dramatically increase the amount of evil required to hit Tier 3. It's impossible to get there without at least 3 gens done. You're better off going for Evil Incarnate after you're good with Myers.
---
Frankly the devs should just allow communication between survivors and balance the game around that.
---
Damn, so hard to tell. So would you say I should wave or better not? I got the feeling most of the times it means: come get me. But I am not that experienced. 
---
Nea killer, haha so funny
---
Freddy just needs to jump off a bridge. 
---
Is this the same imcows that made Csgo videos back in the day?
---
I literally only have Dwight's and Nea's and I'm working on Meg's at the moment. I've been a little busy prestiging Dwight and The Docter though.
---
There's an add-on that allows that to happen
---
Yeah before the store was a thing I brought a few teachable, mostly for killer but I also got some for Feng, Ace and Meg etc.
---
Oh, right.  I feel like an idiot, now.
---
She'd be banned for editing game files.
---
Oh yeah I'm the Legion in the pic.
---
Imagine not being able to identify a shitpost, i hope youre trolling for your sake. Yikes
---
ahh I see 
---
It's an Ultra Rare add on. It takes a lot longer to get Tier III but it last forever.

Honestly, what's the point? This disguise power seems to have no point to it.
---
Getting close to survivors? Can't undisguise.
---
Slow down gens? Why not just kick it, it wastes less time and regresses. Can't get on a gen with a survivor anyway because you have an 8m TR.
---
Sneaking around? Just use frenzy instead, Legion isn't a stealth killer. 
---
This concept just doesn't make sense. 
---
Claudette was the first I grinded out after getting WGLF as David as I felt Self Care was a necessity. 
---
GET BETTER AT PRESSURING GENS AND FINDING SURVIVORS THEN
---
Man, I really wish it was still like that. 500 hrs later however...
---
balanced cant be used on every map and streetwise sucks 
---
Nicely done!
---
They‚Äôll no doubt keep saying that they‚Äôre experimenting but nothing is really working so far, so it‚Äôll constantly be pushed back, same with the DS nerf/rework. I don‚Äôt know, but all we can do is hope. 
---
Dude I had  a Myers with that tuft addon and he hit it at the start of the match with no gens done. I was in complete disbelief. He hadn‚Äôt even been stalking me, literally just caught a laurie at the start and maybe someone else and popped that fucking t3 within minutes.
---
I can see this getting old/toxic if you‚Äôre the killer though. 
---
yup
---
dont want to be a downer but its literally a paper plate with holes and some basic drawings on it. Its 100% a legion cosplay as they do it the same way but its not really hard to pull off. 
---
Dont get me wrong though i like the photo and the idea!
---
They average out to being rank 9.5. Perfectly acceptable. 
---
No thanks, I don't like to support the growing microtransaction culture in gaming. 
---
"Its to support the game", then what is the money for the base game and all the dlcs then?
---
Imagine being strangled for 4 minutes and having to wait for it to finish to get your bloodpoints LOL
---
Real Question: Why don't devs let people make community skins that don't generate income for BHVR?
---
She has other cosplays she has done on here 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to be a downer just don‚Äôt be a downer? 
---
I‚Äôm artistically challenged so anything like this is impressive to me :) 
---
Why
---
Still main legion though
---
I was able to get a bunch of survivor teachables and adept trophies!
---
Because then people would stop buying skins, severely deminishing their income. 
---
That‚Äôs phenomenal! Congratulations! As a Killer, I look forward to chasing people of your caliber. :D
---
Play survivor at mid tier ranks. Don't bring items or tbag, and there will be a decent chance the killer is a facecamping disgrace to bubbas name.
---
On a somewhat related note I feel it ridiculous that nurse can't just force choke survivors darth vader style given her telekinesis.
---
Show me the stat man 
---
I upvoted both of you because both sides are right. Have a nice day! &lt;3
---
Nah, it‚Äôs an old PS4 that I‚Äôve had since it‚Äôs release, why?
---
I'd be happy with the classic suit and tie with no apron
---
Please make sure the nurse cannot back out of the animation sequence.
---
Can you show me your stats? Also, I didn't say all facecampers, I said facecampers who facecamp for no other reason than getting outplayed.
---
&gt;Being swf in a discord channel is objectively a stronger version of having the same survivor play the game solo. Thus even if the game would be perfectly balanced, it would either be imbalanced for solo survivors or for killers facing swf. Calling it a scapegoat is nonsense. People can use it as a scapegoat if they lack in skill, but that doesn't mean swf being a problem for true balance is nothing but a scapegoat.
---
What can one do, really? It's not like SWF survivors are inherently stronger, they just have the ability to communicate with each other. But solo survivors don't; if you design the game based around people who can't communicate, the ones who can are always going to do at least marginally better, but if you design it based around people who can, the ones who can't are always going to do much worse.
---
hahaha - boyyyyy I said no good perks. Only shit ones! And if a character has nothing but good ones, we can always take one from another character (Quentin).
---
i did some bad things in my life but i don't think i deserve this much punishment. just speaking for myself ofc.
---
How do you know this? I'M CONCERNED.
---
this
---
Yeah message me with any specific questions and ill do my best. Best thing i can say as a general advise is make sure to carefully read all the tooltips on killers and perks you arent familiar with.
---
I'm an artist. I'm bitching about 2 separate issues. Buggy ass game. Crazy prices. Pay attention.
---
All i need is jeff and Quentin... im not going to buy Quentin soon tho
---
Finished getting all the perks unlocked on the survivors and leveled up the two killers I play(billy and spirit)
---
imagine they add james earl cash from manhunt
---
question is, would he be a survivor or a killer?
---
Yes because this game is designed around being fun for one player in a match, not all five.  4Head
---
"Legion is not that bad" 
---
The ONLY times I get stomped are when I'm against someone that is CLEARLY higher rank than I am at killer (be it smurfing or the crappy match making giving me a freakin rank 1) or a good coordinated SWF. Sometimes depending on what I'm playing I can use their overcockiness and coordination to my advantage. That's why I say GOOD swf teams kick my ass. The not so good ones tend to just be overly bold and altruistic and trade hooks until they die. Bonus points if they start out being toxic and tbagging but then by the time there's only one left suddenly they turn into scared little children or potatos. 
---
THERE WERE 3 PARTY STREAMERS BURNT IN MY LAST MATCH LAST MIGHT AND A LEATHERFACE HARD TUNNELED ME OUT OF THE GAME. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY - HE WOULD BREAK OFF CHASE OF AN INJURED TEAMMATE TO COME AFTER ME. IT LEGIT MADE ME SAD. 
---
Thank you for the correction sir! Take your karma.
---
Is that the REAL William "Bill" Overbeck?? Sick play.
---
Some ‚Äúhow to not suck‚Äù videos would be nice ;( I‚Äôm so sick of seeing Meg die 
---
AS A KILLER I DON'T CAMP AT THE END BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A SORE LOSER. I DON'T FUCK OFF TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP OR ANYTHING BUT I DON'T STAND BY THE HOOK EITHER. 
---
Meh tbh hes fun but very weak.
---
Well thanks :) I'll pay attention to this now with this in mind. But as I said, most of the times hook was clear when someone did it xD but maybe all unexperienced like me
---
Yeah but you're taking up space on this thread. I want  to see actual DbD related content here not someone playing a different game lol... 
---
Finished collecting almost every perk on every killer minus billy and huntress still need a few perks for then (almost 2 million bp into billy and bbq 1 refused to show up)
---
The berserker was scrapped because they feared he would be far far too broken. He won‚Äôt be seen in the game
---
what if she sticks blinks in their throat as she strangulates them, making it faster?
---
The nurse is the one killer I almost always escape against but I sit around yellow ranks so that could be why.
---
There's a few addons that increase the speed at which you gain evil within. Also, use Monitor and Abuse and dead rabbit addon to get right up near them to stalk them while they do gens. Just stay somewhat hidden behind a tree or hay bale, etc
---
LULLABY, MAYBE?
---
Glubba glubba
---
Well whatever content your happy with im sure your subscribers would like it for me when it comes to dbd i sometimes like watching really serious gameplay like tru3ta1ent but then i also like how noob3 makes his videos have this fun twist to it 
---
I thought that nothing affects lullaby radius
---
I'VE PLAYED BOTH KILLER AND SURVIVOR THIS BLOODRUSH AND RUN INTO SO MANY TOXIC KILLERS WHILE SURVIVORS WERE USUALLY COOL. IS THIS A TYPICAL BLOODRUSH THING?
---
No
---
Jesus christ no, that perk is terrible.
---
Tis be actually good concept.
---
IF YOU BURN A BPS YOU HAVE LIKE A 50% CHANCE OF LOADING IN. IT FUCKING SUCKS. 
---
Found the troll,  or the biggest newb
---
I don't mind the high level add-ons, some are just too good I think. Legion and Spirit especially have probably some of the strongest Very Rare add-ons in the game. They should be high risk high reward. I think Michael's are a good example of balanced high level add-ons, it takes forever to get to Tier 3 when using the tombstones or hair but the payoff is good if you can do it efficiently. Doctor's works since it basically makes him a wildcard with his iridescent king, Huntress may be annoying but she does get less hatchets to throw with her insta-downs. All of Hags high level add-ons have a part of her trap amplified with either a cooldown or another part of it taken away.
---
very-rare/ultra-rare add ons that just boost everything about the killers power isn't fun to go against. Spirits Yakuyoke amulet is the biggest example of this I feel. All of Legion's very-rares just makes them 10x more unfun to go against.
---
I'm guessing this is just their new design method since Clown, just make the killers higher level add-ons overpowered to go against (granted red-heads finger isn't the worst thing to go against but he gets no downside for it) as Spirit and Legion have amazing high tier add-ons and playing against about 20+ legion's this past week that tunnel you until you die or countless 20 ft lunge Spirits helped me to see how BS those add-ons can be
---
This is quality 
---
Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt a  Nea? That just doesn‚Äôt seem like a Dwight thing to do. Dwight mains are wholesome.
---
The other three just stand there like statues? 
---
I feel like the more I play on the Game, the faster it goes. It has two or three *amazing* totem spots, but now everyone has em down to memory so they pop right away. 
---
IT'S TOTALLY NOT TRYING TO HELP, IT'S TRYING TO SCREW WITH YOU!!! ~*GURGLES IN HAG*~
---
tbh if you take the one-shot axes and an ebony mori into a game you deserve to get flamed streamers or not
---
ALSO WHY ARE SO MANY WRAITHS EXPLOITING THIS BUG?
---
You opinion is so toxic in mind of devolpers
---
Had a game where we spawned in all together, next to Ruin. Meg hops on it so I walk 10 whole steps and immediately find Huntress Lullaby. Killer probably cried. 
---
IF A KILLER BURNS BPS I WANT YOU TO HOOK ME AT LEAST ONCE BUT ALL THE CAMPERS MAKE ME NERVOUS. 
---
That perk is genuinely the worst exhaustion perk. It just activates so rarely in chase.
---
I FEEL LIKE WHEN A KILLER BURNS BPS IT MEANS, "PLEASE DON'T DC WHEN YOU FIND OUT MY ADD ONS"
---
Dude you must be really new to the game.  Its one of the best perks in the game. 
---
Got all the teachables from Adam and got halfway through leveling Laurie. Also I got a crap ton of winter party starters and a decent amount of iridescent add ons.
---
Inconsistent, I‚Äôd say? My sister and I both play on Pro, and hers is great! Not like PC, of course, but mostly stable 25 FPS with no drops or anything. 
---
Mine runs like Helen Keller built it. 
---
Where do you get those jackets or what are they called? I can never find one.
---
I have 1000 hours. So no. Every other exhaustion perk (not adrenaline) will activate so much more, and help you so much more.
---
WHENEVER I WANT TO GIVE THE KILLER A STACK I GET CAMPED OR TUNNELED SO NO. 
---
Nurse &gt; Hilbilly &gt; Spirit 
---
Nope and nope. 
---
At least it ain‚Äôt a nurse 
---
I'm alright against legion because I've adapted to playing against him and the people around my level don't play him anyway, but the nurse is really powerful if you're good with her, and everyone is at the higher levels 
---
Holy shitballs batman
---

I COLLECT ENAMEL PINS AND WOULD LOVE SOME DBD ONES. I FOUND ONE THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE FENG MIN SO I PRETEND IT IS HER.

Wtf where did all those scratch marks come from??
---
On ps4 if the legion sees a Nea, she gets tunneled for 10 minutes and hit from 5 yards away like wtf okay

They're alright if you wish you weren't playing Freddy. Which, relatable, but you have to play to his strengths to do well. Range and dress addons really help him keep multiple people in the dream world, red paintbrush is great, the purple addons are good if situational. The block addons are okay, but a people who don't play Freddy tend to think they're the best and Freddy can only tunnel because they don't understand how to play him.
---
Oh
---
After reading comments I now realize you weren't complaining about a nurse who was slugging people
---
It still seems like you could be though
---
I‚Äôll just wait for someone else to chime in. Shouldn‚Äôt take long...
---
Tbey cant. He‚Äôs licensed
---
You failed to write the goddamn title correctly
---
Its obviousely Are you are a gamer gilr&gt;??/
---
People swarming me trying to body block as I hook someone. They are instant front of the line Mori victims
---
WHEN I'M A KILLER AND THAT HAPPENS I THINK "FARM TIME."
---
WHEN I'M A SURVIVOR, WE GET ANNIHILATED QUICKLY WITH A "GGEZ" AT THE END. 
---
Lol I had a discussion with a leatherface who camped hooks and had played streamers. I pointed out it was a waste and they thought getting 27000 was not a waste. When I replied by saying with streamers you should be averaging 60000 + if not closer to 100,000 they never replied.
---
Thank you :3 
---
I cut out a shape I liked of EVA foam, heated it with a heat gun, bent and pressed it over a thick plaster cast of my own face then heated again and kept repeating these steps until it met my desired shape. Then I cut out holes, put on a small strap and painted it as I wanted it! Hope it helped :3 
---
WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY BE DESIGNED TO DO THAT. I DONT BELIEVE THAT AND IF THATS TRUE then I‚Äôve been complaining about nothing but fuck hag if that‚Äôs true
---
Unless Legion's new name is "Kissanimegotmefam" I don't see how such a thing is possible...
---
I DON'T RUN D-STRIKE AND I'M CONSTANTLY THE OBSESSION.
---
I got my rank reset from 1 as survivor to 17. So I got to achieve crap teammates and feeling like a pos playing against killers who should not have had me in their lobby. 
---
Maybe she's slowly crushing their throat instead?
---
Thank you cx üíï
---
I‚Äôve heard it before and considered it but I‚Äôm scared honestly xD Too afraid my work won‚Äôt be high enough quality for the customer haha x‚Äô)
---
I one-tricked huntress for months, almost a half a year actually, and only got that achievement recently. It's primarily luck since most decent survivors can easily sidestep your hatchets at a distance. Crossmaps are doable, but hard as hell. Most huntresses I think just use BBQ. I used Bitter Murmur. It works a little better actually since most people don't expect it, but again whether or not they run somewhere you can actually hit them isn't up to you. A decent workaround is nurses calling. It's 28 meters and survivors often times don't pay attention when they're healing, so when you see their auras, just back up some and abuse those gigantic vertical hitboxes.   
---
Another easy source of crossmap hatchets are the farm maps. A lot of their generators are wide open, so it pays to occasionally just chuck some hatchets at them. You have to practice a bit to get the aim right, but again, the hatchet's vertical hitbox is massive. Just aim high. 
---
When a survivor makes a hook save, toss a hatchet back there. If they can't hear your terror radius, they'll often times heal right under the hook, making for an easy crossmap shot. This will only work once against smart survivors and wont work at all against experienced ones. If they know you're playing huntress, they'll just move a bit. 
---
You'll come to find that 24 meters isn't actually that far, but again there's a lot of luck involved. Just take your time and play, OOOOOORRRRR sacrifice some games just to practice. When you find a survivor, let him get some distance and then start throwing. You won't hit anything for a while, but it's worth the time investment.
---
Yo that's creepy.
---
SERIOUSLY - LET ME AT LEAST TURN IT DOWN. I CAN HEAR NOTHING!
---
It‚Äôs actually not a paper plate so not really :3 
---
It‚Äôs EVA foam that‚Äôs been shaped and bent several times under extreme heat. I could‚Äôve made this in plaster or worbla as well but chose to do it in a faster way but that is still dureable :D
---
A well coordinated team of survivors can put pressure on a killer, I wouldnt really say punish. Although there are certain occasions where hook camping is acceptable (like running bbq and seeing no auras) I think most of the good players will agree if you have to hook camp regularly just to get a kill, you need more practice.
---
I P3'd Meg. Prestiged Feng. Got almost 200,000 in one game without farming. Got Kate's Teachables. And realized that I was bad at killer because my sensitivity wasn't high enough. Lol
---
Testing. A lot of testing.
---
It‚Äôs their body leaving the 5th dimension 
---
got my Kate from level 50 to prestige 3 
---
Wow when did they add Shia lebouef to dbd?
---
I HAVE NO IDEA IF ITS TEMPORARY SO IT MIGHT BE BEST TO COP THEM SOONER RATHER THAN LATER
---
It honestly blows my mind too...
---
Side note, these would also be cool to see, even though it‚Äôll never happen:

I love the legion. I've only ever played killer for dailys over the last year and a half, but I will now play legion frequently. I love going against him too. By far my favorite killer all around.
---
Doesn't change the fact that he should jump off a bridge. 
---
Focus Min, from the Spark of Focus chapter in Focus by Daylight!

I MAIN CLAUDETTE BUT I NEED NEAS BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD! ANY ADVICE?

Hell yeah. Us pig mains have been pushed around for too long
---
I say he‚Äôs good, but I‚Äôm bad
---
(Btw are addons worth using I have just been hoarding them pls help)
---
"Why is the killer trying to kill me wtf"
---
Survivor is actually better with controller. 
---
Yea but then you break chase and run off and bleed out even more than the second hit
---
"So many more paths"
---
Quite the hyperbole. Maybe on like, Crotus Prenn, or the swamp? Most drop downs aren't exactly near anything good. Balanced landing isn't exactly the most helpful for when you get ambushed. Or when there isn't a dropdown nearby. Or when a dropdown just doesn't spawn.

If I was playing killer. I would have swung at Bill again
---
\*Gone in 10 Seconds.
---
There is no DS "counter" that's a soft counter at best because it can still be used. 
---
"We all optimize down here"
---
This.
---
Either use bamboozle, or mind game it. Otherwise you‚Äôll be at the T walls for a full gen, and then the survivor will just move to some pallets 
---
WHY IN THE FUCC DID I EVER GET TO RANK 1, IT'S JUST FULL OF TOXIC SWF TRYHARDS!?
---
Also good survivors are usually pretty hook thirsty
---
They'll beg to charge in and unhook the weak guy
---
Rule #4: Don't use me as a distraction to get the killer off you when I'm repairing gens. Slows down the game. I'm looking at you "aftercare".
---
Killers are not meant to be equally strong.
---
If you put *Coxcombed Clapper* and *The Ghost - Soot* on Lery's or The Game, Wraith in these conditions becomes probably becomes one of the strongest killers.
---
They could like make it a 10 dollar skin and make twice as much off of it that they would from LF too lmao
---
Can we all just agree to not bring in mori‚Äôs same to survivors on insta heals, at least during a bp event  (although imo it‚Äôs not as bad as a mori) 
---
I would argue that communication alone elevates SWF. It's the difference between pulling everyone off gens on the 1st hook because nobody knows if the other players will unhook, or having one guy say "I got it". Certain killers just aren't viable against good SWF because they lack the map pressure to keep up with the speed of gen completion that those groups tend to bring. Maybe red rank killers can do it, but I'd wager most of the killer population struggles against them. But like you said, you can't really do anything to nerf SWF
---
How so?
---
Not if you err on the other side of the great skill check.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. It‚Äôs a shame New Line will only let people use remake Freddy, and not the OG Freddy whom everyone loves. Even though Freddy‚Äôs reveal is what made me get the game in the first place, I was really disappointed it was 2010 Freddy alongside the preschool and fuckin‚Äô Quentin. 
---
I actually do think that maybe there shouldn't be any hard counter in this game... Like it's kinda unfair for either side if the other can do something that completely negates a tactic/perk of theirs.
---
There‚Äôs perks that give you free escapes from the hook, there‚Äôs also an item that lets you escape without even powering the gates. 
---
You can normally tell if the killer has a mori, at the offering screen their offering doesn't burn. If that happens you can bet they have one.
---
If that does happen then you should try and adapt your play style for that round.
---
Almost same thing with BBnC. I make a habit of quickly jumping into a locker for a few seconds whenever a killer hooks someone.
---
It's all about adapting.
---
i don‚Äôt know why you made the clip so long, but yeah. i‚Äôve been experiencing this glitch a lot. it‚Äôs bull.
---
Easier 360s and tighter angles when running loops.
---
Killer is definitely mouse though. 
---
for being 7 days, the extra amount of moris i saw thanks to the gift boxes made kinda hard to farm. on the other hand firecrackers for days
---
Hello guys it's anomaly from sweden
---
Sadly she‚Äôs right at the bottom of the barrel as far as their priorities are going, she won‚Äôt see changes for a long time. 
---
Susie with Joey‚Äôs mask is my favorite combination!
---
DS itself is incredibly strong is the issue. It's like NOED, both are unhealthy for the game. 
---
it's really not that simple 
---
Not necessarily. 5 dull totems spawn on the map every game. If the killer is running hex perks, one of the dull totems (or more) will appear as lit hex totems. When a lit hex totem is cleansed, the killer's perk it was tied to goes away for the rest of the game. 
---
I wish x2 was the standard blood point gain. 
---
It was imbalanced back when you could morie people before hooking them.  
---
Looks like he tried to, but failed miserably. 
---
I'm not trying to err, though ‚Äî if I try to err on the safe side, I can only hit it once every 10 times or so (since erring and hitting it are mutually exclusive).
---
i never use ds with my feng, i bring alert, technician, lithe and selfcare. For all the crap that i hear people say how technician is useless, i find that most killers doesnt expect it and end up in situations where they come to the gen and doesnt know why they cant kick it
---
Billy doesn't need a nerf. He is just right.
---
&gt; there's no survivor offering that just gives you a random free escape from hook or something similar
---
There‚Äôs the key, which allows easier escapes.
---
Every meme is marked as a shitpost. Meaning no effort or low effort was made and its ultimately pointless. Yes, this is a shitpost, what im saying is that it isnt even good or sensible. 
---
Never thought about the locker for BBnC, good idea.  Guess I just have to assume mori like you said.
---
How odd. Especially considering the killers look a little off brand. I feel like a cosmetic would fall under "parody" or some other. It's just weird is all. 
---
Tinkerer is a billy teachable so no dlc, when a generator reaches 85% you get a notification and for a few seconds your terror radius turns to 0
---
Perfect for knowing when a generator is gonna be done and using your non-existant TR to get near it, then, using your power when you are near to grab people off gens
---
Overcharge Freddy is super great to play because lots of survivors just think that you're being stupid for putting them to sleep, kicking the gen, letting them wake up, and repeating.  Then after you do that a couple of times, their gen at 70%? No progress anymore. :/ I always run it with huntress lullably so it regresses the gen an extra 9% when they fail the skillcheck.  
---
Some people dont need/care about the BP. They have fun in destroying someone else fun. 
---
It seems to though. I can walk right up to people on generators before they realize I am there and start trying to hide or run.
---
Even if it didnt though, that isn't the main draw anyway. Put someone to sleep, and let them run away for 10 seconds. When you go to get them again, they have NO idea you are there. You can see their aura until they are like 3 feet away. I have hid behind trees and let them run right up to me and jumped from behind the tree and slashed them.
---
With the dress, if you get all 4 asleep, you have basically won the game.
---
Shes not weak! She can fuck with survivors looping
---
I think the Pig‚Äôs base kit just needs 1 buff and 2 reworks to raise her from C to B tier.
---
Rework 1:  The Reverse Bear trap does not activate when a gen is completed.  Instead, it activates as soon as a survivor is healed from the dying state to the wounded state (or healed to full health, if a syringe is used) or once they are removed from a hook.  Instead of activating the trap, every time a generator is completed while a survivor has a trap on them all trapped survivors have their timer advanced by 30 seconds.  Traps now have a timer of 3:20 instead of 2:30.
---
Rework 2:  Trapped survivors must find 2 keys to remove their trap.  The luck stat now affects the probability of finding a key.
---
Buff:  Trapped survivors will be killed if they attempt to use the hatch to escape.
---
With these changes, I feel like traps would be a much better way of stalling the game out, since it puts an immediate hustle on survivors togo out and get the traps off and makes it so that a survivor can‚Äôt just fling the thing off in 20 seconds if they get lucky on the first box.  It also makes it so that their teammates have an actual reason not to genrush while their comrades are trapped since it has a direct negative effect on their ability to survive.  That said, the timer has been increased by a pretty considerable margin so that these changes are not too oppressive.  More keys means the survivors are less likely to get laughed at by Billy, which reduces your tracking which is another factor that I feel makes this change positive but fair.
---
Wow, me and you both. I'm one of the people that think Quentin and Freddy are two of the few redeeming qualities of that remake, and even I thought it was bullshit. Yet, I bought the game as a huge Freddy fan. 
---
Apparently there's actually a Classic Freddy skin for the Mortal Kombat X mobile game so there's still hope for it to appear in this game, but BHVR would need to actually ask, which I feel like they have no interest in doing. 
---
They have too many of them from gift boxes and can't resist not using them.
---
Yep, I'm at rank 1 killer but can only play nurse because I get too frustrated otherwise. I'm looking forward to rank reset so I can have fun playing other killers again.
---
Touche
---
Went from lvl 15 to lvl 5 as killer with only one game with a depip (terrible map layout and friendly killer followed up with an exit gate Dstrike).  I've never played killer enough to rank lower than 12 before.  Generally only play for daily's or when survivor ques are long.  
---
I played mostly friendly killer, trying to get 8 hooks without killing.  Averaged 28k+ a game.
---
* Huntress lvl 10 -&gt; lvl 50
---
* Legion lvl 1 -&gt; lvl 50
---
* Trapper P2 lvl 31 -&gt; P2 lvl 50 
---
* Meg P2 lvl 33 -&gt; P2 lvl 50
---
* 200k on Myers (already P3)
---
* 75k on Claudette (already P3)
---
Freddy with decent adds is a pub stomper (8-15).  I used him a lot because I had a bunch of streamers.  I didn't have ruin and I found his ability slowed the game down a lot.  
---
The biggest hurdle I see going into red ranks is time.  It's not the fact that survivors are much better at looping and 360ing (they are).  That can be an issue with a bad layout, but the real problem is that they can fly through gens.  
---
This is adorable! I love the little Spirit face.
---
lery's is only good for jumpscare myers imo
---
Now we're talking.  Love both games.  Sam's alternate skin is the impossibly tight towel that never falls off.
---
No one knows how to play her properly. You use one rbt on the first survivor. And always keep one rbt on a survivor (save one for end game). You crouch when youre being looped and use ambush to fake out pallets. Theres a youtube video explaining in-depth how to use her but i forgot whi made it. My build on her is hex: haunted grounds, hex:ruin, Make your choice, and bbq
---
Also because rituals. "... Kill by your own hands..."
---
Then don‚Äôt tunnel lol
---
It‚Äôs not shaming the player and it‚Äôs in no way oversaturated.
---
Playing as Freddy is one thing but going beyond that to draw him just feels weird and wrong. 
---
Ok that's a stretch. Come on lol.
---
nice 
---
This ain't Last Year amigo
---
Probably because the extra BP has allowed them to get good offerings and they lack impulse control so they use them right away.
---
S t o p  l o o p i n g
---
I wish those were as common as you make it sound. 60k bp is very bueno.
---
I love playing tombstone Myers. It's fun. It's very easy to counter though. Just try not to feed him stalk. The only bad thing is when randoms feed him.  
---
Idk how she didn't smack you tbh lol 
---
I don't think we glorify them by playing as them. But drawing him just feels like you like him as a person. You have a point though but to me, those two feel different.
---
After a week or so of grinding on MKX Mobile (it was Freddy, I didn‚Äôt have much choice) I finally got him, and his appearance is something of a hybrid between Original and Remake, which is meh I suppose.
---
And yes, Haley‚Äôs Freddy in the remake was so damn good. Him and Kyle Gallner as Quentin we‚Äôre the only ones putting in actual effort, and Quentin was I think the best character there- certainly had the most personality.
---
Emblem Qualities give the following
---
Nothing = 0 Points
---
Bronze = 1 Point
---
Silver = 2 Points
---
Gold = 3 Points
---
Iridescent = 4 Points
---
Pip Conditions are the following
---
0-5 Points = -1 Pip
---
6-8 Points = 0 Pips (Safety Pip)
---
9-13 Points = +1 Pip
---
14-16 Points = +2 Pips
---
If you wanted to safety you'd need at least 6 points which if you want to use all categories would be 2 Silver and 2 Bronze.
---
I have to say, you can be pretty accurate once you get used to it - but it took me like 1 weeks for basic shots and another week until I could hit Nurses Calling shots like these!
---
Whats really hard is Pallet Looping on Autohaven or similar maps..
---
No, Ashley was the whiny one. But Emily was the one who called for help. 
---
Uhhh even some of the highest skilled people get fucked over a lot of the time. Noob3 used to literally NEVER escape. He simply changed his play style to be more helpful vs just being the looper of the match. Now he has a record for 50 escapes in a row. Hell even Demi (who is a toxic Jake god) doesn't always escape and that WITH SWF usually. And it's not always that they make a mistake (although especially Noob3 frequently would by burning himself out and not moving to a safer area or putting enough distance), sometimes they literally just get bloodlusted to death. They either choose not to or can't put enough distance between them and the killer and fully win the chase so eventually they get caught. 
---
But even then, everyone should know by now not to fall for Loop Bait. Especially at the beginning of a game. Certain players in certain scenarios can and WILL keep looping you if they have good connection and know the map well enough. But with the RNG being so awful at spacing out pallets now, it's not nearly as easy as it was before. 
---
Hey op id think spirt fury or enduring would be a better perk to run than unnerving presence, because rn you dont have any chase perks. 
---
Rather have a priest/bishop killer
---
That's true, but on an individual level it just sorta feels bad to get bodied by a Killer who can one-shot you from game start. x_x
---
The Doctor will see you now.
---
nice
---
Which one looks off brand? The only one that doesn't look classic to Freddy but that's because he is from the modern remake.
---
But that's also why we don't have any other cosmetics for them or they can't be bought with shards is because of the licensing agreements. At the time it was easy to import a licensed character and get the owners to agree to let BHVR splash some blood on them from the Prestige looks.
---
&gt; without any warning.
---
objectively false
---
I'd take a hybrid too, if we're being honest. It just feels wrong to play as Freddy and look at the remake glove instead of the classic glove. Even the sweater being so much darker just throws me off, as such a huge fan of the character. 
---
The event is done now.
---
BHVR ain't doin' religious characters because ***p o l i t i c s***
---
The event just ended.
---
I like Balanced Landing the most and probably Lithe the least. 
---
I want a option for a control system, calm down.
---
Freddy is a great killer, the reboot is just an injustice to the franchise. The reboot would‚Äôve done just fine without the pedophile aspect, I have no clue what the fuck they were thinking when they did that. 
---
Balanced landing due to all the new routes you can take during a chase. Especially when there isn't a nearby pallet or window, you can easily drop down and zoom over to a pallet.
---
Bad comparison. 
---
K
---
Unless they are running BNP or keys their items extend the game and increase points for everyone.
---
I personally dislike DH because it can be baited out by good killers. After they know you have it, they can typically bait and anticipate when you‚Äôre going to use it. 
---
My favourite would be Sprint Burst specifically for the reason where it can get you out of a dead zone when you need it. 
---
IF YOU HAVE NO GOOD OUTFITS FOR EITHER OF THEM ID GO WITH CLAUDETTE JUST CAUSE SHES YOUR MAIN. BUT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SOME NICE OUTFITS FOR HER GO WITH NEA. OR BETTER YET, GET THEM BOTH IF THATS AN OPTION LMAO
---
I would prefer Mike as a new surviver, cause this game really has no handsome male surviver. But I would love Sam- or Jessicacosmetics for Meg, Emily for Feng, Chris for Dwight, Josh or Matt for Jake, Ashley for Meg or Kate. And I really want a map inside the mines. As Until Dawn Chapter or new map from McMillain Estate
---
Inb4 reeee stop bullying killers comments 
---
Sprint burst is good for staying out of trouble if you're willing to walk around the map to avoid wasting it.
---
Lithe is good for taking killer aggro and ending off a chase right, which can buy more time for your teammates if you're willing to risk your own life.
---
Balanced Landing is good for making sure that you're much less likely to get caught out and boxed in, as falling from heights is no longer a death sentence, opening up more options of escape if you're willing to risk spawning a flat map.
---
Dead Hard is good to force loops that would otherwise be too long, and SHOULDN'T be used to beef a killer hit unless they're blocking your path somehow, also good for dodging bear traps, giving you a good all around safety net if you're willing to learn how to use it perfectly.
---
And then cancel out of the Mori mid animation and continue to hold them hostage
---
I will support his new dreams TIL I DIE
---
I still have no idea where the Freddy ‚Äòdarn‚Äô meme originated, but I love every bit of it.
---
I know right? I mean killers are CLEARLY overpowered and this NEEDS to be adressed NOW!!!
---
You cannot even pallet loop the huntress because she can hit the poor survivors EVERYWHERE :p
---
Yeah but that's small compared to some other killers. It puts her in high mid teir but she's still mid teir af.
---
DOOM GUY INTENSIFIES
---
haha that's pretty much all we do. Glad u liked it man!
---
But that's not toxic behavior! He was guarding his 2 sacrifices. Why would he give you the opportunity to free them? Work smarter, not harder.
---
If I believe hard enough, it‚Äôll come true.
---
Right?
---
gocus with the flocus
---
Completely forgot about the doctor being great on lery's. My bad.
---
Thanks man appreciate the support!
---
She seems so welcomed!
---
Nice! My initial goal was 500 but when I saw all those ultra rare addons I kept spending my bp on killers. 
---
I don't get it. Is this a humble brag? You got a 3k, what's the problem? Also the ranks look like they average out around your rank anyway.
---
Started playing around October but I believe they have 4 a year based during equinox/solstices.
---
Go for the Nea
---
Except this is only him at Midnight on Halloween, not New Year's Day
---
Not really, when the event started looting became the best it has ever been.
---
Or just leave the survivor
---
Thanks man!
---
Game has gotten better in terms of balance. It's still really hard as a killer without ruin or a full anti heal build because gens still go very quick, but it is a lot better.
---
pretty sure its how long you shudder and cant move for
---
Not to often, are started playing before clown came out and I thinks theirs been about 2 or 3 as well as one bloodrush (1.5 bloodpoints)
---
Honestly this is pretty much the only option. If a game's foundation isn't great and is just a tower of duct tape, it eventually becomes more viable to just make an entirely new game or keep updating and fixing more urgent bugs as you go. But I highly doubt BHVR will make a new DBD because that's a mammoth project on its own. They would have to be making insane money right now and also have massive projected growth.
---
You might want to pick up the cannibal/ hag if you plan on getting serious with killer. Bubba has a perk called bbq and chili that many think is a necessity. Hag has Hex: Ruin, which is debatably right up there with bbq. Otherwise, Hillbilly is a fine killer to start and learn the game with. 
---
&gt;Then don't rush gens lol
---
Dead by Focus*
---
Suuu QT!
---
SPRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINT
---
SPRIIIIIIIIIIIII^(IIIIING)
---
Ye, I understand. For now I'll stick with some casual Dbd uploads, hehe
---
&gt;Freddy‚Äôs reveal is what made me get the game in the first place
---
The hype in October 2017 was the single biggest hype we've had for any character. I remember spammed posts of people losing their minds about sweaterboi joining the game. 
---
...but then everything changed when the ~~Fire~~ BHVR Nation attacked; maiming Freddy into the soft, nerfed  version of what he could have been. Never forget the original hype.  
---
\**tear drop falls\**
---
Nice 
---
The bigger the map and the more visual cover it has, the better. The Game is considered the best killer map and either the ***CORN*** or the swamp maps are considered best for survivor.
---
Maybe I should have listened to the video with sound, the first time I saw it and commented I didn‚Äôt have my volume on. My bad :)
---
Champs?
---
Yeah, sometimes it seems like survivors don‚Äôt understand that I want to farm or maybe they just don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôve hit gens to indicate I want to farm and even knocked a few of them down and let them wiggle off my shoulder. Every time they just ran away so I ended up killing them. 
---
To be fair tho, I understand their wariness since some killers fake wanting to farm to lure survivors into a false sense of security. 
---
Why complain when you had a level 15 noobie and level 13 with almost no perks. Take it as a win no need to cry. 
---
I noticed that, too.  I just go to "recent players" if I ever want to message someone.
---
You know in the films when the villain brags to the fallen hero before their defeat?
---
There are two things to learn from this.
---
1. Never trust a Bill recovering under the hook.
---
2. If you're gonna hit the recently unhooked guy... wait for BT to wear off first.
---
&gt;So, I was playing as Leatherface 
---
no
---
I can't argue with that, it does suck. But the game is designed around on average, only 1-2 survivors surviving in most games. So the killer needs t be powerful. Not going to say that iridescent head combined with the combat belt and/or ebony moris don't go above the standard power curve, they definitely do. But I feel like, if you as a killer are using several ultra rare addons and an ultra rare offering, you should have a ridiculous (perhaps even unfair) level of power out of it.
---
Initially, I got DBD on the PS4 in the Halloween sale of 2017, so I had to wait another two weeks like the rest of the console players to play as him. By then, he was already nerfed to the ground and I never got to play as Freddy when he was at his strongest.
---
Funnily enough, I was playing yesterday as Freddy (now on PC) and got a 4K, and one person got really tilted in endgame chat, saying that ‚ÄòFreddy is too powerful‚Äô ‚ÄòCan all killers be nerfed please‚Äô. Even after Freddy‚Äôs balance equivalent of a back alley beating, some people are still convinced he‚Äôs OP.
---
Have you not seen Shirtless David?
---
yup.
---
step inside the mind of pedo Freddy...well Freddy.
---
gen is being worked on.  its about 50% done.  scare them off it.  kick gen.  regresses.
---
choice time.  do take the guarenteed wakeup and lose 8s of progress? Do they intentionally hit the skill check to. clear the charge and stay in the dreamworld?
---
It actually is the type of gameplay mechanic that I love.
---
Yea, on other killers, it can help slow down gen progress depending on survivor proficiency and on massive terror radius builds, its damn near fucking evil, but on Freddy, its downright insidious.  It's essentially forcing you to choose temporary safety for the price of screwing everyone over ( fucking up the gens) or play hide and seek with sharp hand joe until you run across an awake survivor or non overcharged gen (such as one with very little progress on it).
---
its such a rare gem that on the surface seems like the worst possible perk for Freddy, but once you remember freddy wants your time in the dream world to be a nightmare, do you realize how evil this really is.
---
After you understand the core gameplay figuring out what killers are strong or weak is simple. If you are just starting focus on the game itself, tiers are unimportant 
---
NOED stops them from winning as much.
---
I've noticed huge differences when using it and without.
---
Luckiest play of dbd for me was when i ran a killer around for 5 gens and hit an invisible Decisive strike.
---
Would you mind linking the video this is from?
---
Not only that, but you can't hide anywhere. Because the blood spurts directly into the air above your head giving away your position. It even spurts out of the lockers.
---
What is a good killer and survivor to play for understanding the game? And that is strong.
---
Fantastic video, loved the editing.
---
So glad you included that last clip of him being hooked again, hilarious and I was dying to know how the rest of the round went haha
---
Until you complete the bloodweb they will stay in there
---
Wow I got so used to for Honor I completely forgot that was an option. Thank you 
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs pretty good. 
---
Mostly people know the meta from playtime/experience/personal opinions, but it could also be from various streamers or youtubers.  There is a site where people have rated all the perks and killers to form a tier list sort of thing, though I think forming your own personal opinions through experience is going to be more valuable.  It is a decent place to get started, and interesting just from a curiosity standpoint though.

---
No problem!
---
‚ÄòCooldown‚Äô in this game always refers to when you‚Äôve performed an action and are then slowed down and can‚Äôt perform another action. For Legion, their cooldown is when his Frenzy ends and she looks at their hands for a bit while he cools off. 
---
go do a gen if they arent leaving the hatch
---
3 words. peer to peer
---
why cant you do gens?
---
All the salt broke this feature. 
---
the editing is on point 10/10
---
Just go for the hatch. If you get grabbed out, move on to the next game. At this point you‚Äôre holding the game hostage just as much as him.
---
5 mins seems like plenty. Make sure to post it everywhere and tag the right people that need to see it as well as reporting in game.
---
great story, felt like i was in the game reading it... I don't see toxic.
---
"Claudettes of the corn."
---
I think I‚Äôve been on for a few months . This game has taken at least $25 off of me üòí lmao I‚Äôm ashamed
---
Please PM me your Google account if you have one.  I insist.  I'd like to cover some shipping costs of these mass mailings you do.
---
Work and life kinda prevented me from getting to play the game more than a couple hours during the event. Could we maybe just get the party starters to stay in the bloodweb? (Dunno if there are or aren't, but I'm hopeful.)
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THE CO-OP ACTIONS DAILY? IS THE GAME RANDOMLY DECIDING HOW MANY SECONDS I'M ACTUALLY HELPING TEAMMATES? I DID ALL GENS TOGETHER WITH TEAMMATES AND ONLY ACCRUED 8 MORE SECONDS.
---
WTF? 
---
you know, its such a weird mental space.
---
on one hand, yes freddy is king pedo supreme who probably is the deepak chopra of grooming techniques *shudders*
---
but also... this is a game about being or running away from different killers.  one of them happens to be an unapologetic serial child rapist/killer who burned the bodies of his victims.  when comparing Freddy to the rest of the roster, no one really holds a candle to how insanely and deliberately fucked up this guy is.  plus, for a lot of us, me included, he's my favorite slasher villain because of his quips and stylish kills.
---
gotta always remember this is a game and ONLY in the realm of fiction is this ok.
---
I usually hate any kind of microtransactions but hell this is a good idea. Bet someone will comment how it won't work though. Legal shit and all that
---
defenetly Scott
---
you just said that they should have a courtesy if something not in your favor happens‚Äîmost of the time i don‚Äôt care because i sure as fuck never get it lol just finish your game and move on to the next
---
If you're new to the game I would recommend playing Claudette as survivor, and probably Hillbilly as killer.  Hillbilly is an easy to play, high reward killer with great mobility and Claudette is easy to hide with and lets you earn the Self-Care teachable perk that you will want on all other survivors you level up in the future.
---
You killed survivors, therefore you are, by definition, toxic.
---
My man Herman on his creep shit. Love it. 
---
Lol nobody wins 100% of the time.
---
I spent... a lot on there. Haha. I was Overall and TB VIP for some time. I always used the name MistressOfDeath but people know me there by Xan. The people there can be toxic, look out for yourself fam and have fun! 
---
No new ones will be in the bloodwebs. 
---
Don‚Äôt quote me on this but I think that I heard somewhere that there‚Äôs still a 1% or 2% chance to pull one out of treasure chests at any time. 
---
I can't tell if you're being serious or not...
---
It also puts extra stress on your keyboard. 
---
lol
---
Yeah, both are great killers, but I'd have to say Scott. 
---
"She was the object of his obsession." 
---
Should've saved that for Myers imo. Also, this a cover for a porno? Eh. 
---
Scott.
---
thanks
---
That's slightly misleading. You still have to have a certain amount of gens done for it to appear. So it relies on you either doing two yourself, or your teammates helping out. And you still have to find it. And if you find it with other teammates still alive, you need 1 of 2 specific keys.   
---
That's a ton of requirements for the hatch. Mori has just one (depending on the mori) just hook'em once.
---
P.S. - I don't mind mori's. I prefer not to run into them, but I don't lose my shit when it happens. You win some; you lsoe some.
---
all of your artwork is so amazing!! this is really good and also made me laugh a little! 
---
Great! I thought that stair camping and slugging would be considered that.
---
Keep it relevant. BO4, Battlefield and even Battlefront are running at 60fps with far more people playing and lots more going on in game. Even Fortnite runs better on base hardware and has 95 more players in a match. 
---
I play on the enhanced consoles, so framerate is not an issue for me, but base hardware shouldn't be experiencing these things. 
---
The maps are small, there is only 5 players in a match ‚Ä¶ it should be much better for them. 
---
I don‚Äôt see Toxic, I do see a boring game though. I feel really bad for David. You got a really early start and I would have not hooked him immediately both times after the poor soul has been unhooked. But your play style so to each their own.
---
i know it's a joke but she's not actually strangling them, she's stealing their breath like she did with the people in the asylum
---
Clown should get a Hitler Skin, I mean he throws gas already.
---
So is that trying to say that at any given % *a single survivor* will die, or that the killer is sacrificing *all* of the survivors?
---
I cant play Nea with that jacket without playing Michael Jackson.
---
Definitely toxic app . And the funny thing is everyone is like 23 and up and I feel like the adult because I‚Äôm 18 and I don‚Äôt do that toxic shit lmao . But thanks!
---
No you don‚Äôt need all those perks to counter 1, I just gave you multiple options seeing as how you hate one perk so much I thought you‚Äôd need some help. 
---
Agitation helps you reach more hooks. 
---
Madgrit helps prevent body blocks better, it also gets rid of recovery from missed swings allowing you to swing more making it harder for the survivor to hit their skill check. Not my fault you couldn‚Äôt make that realization. 
---
Unnerving will stop most if not all people from hitting decisive. If they hit it at that point it is deserved(just my ‚Äúentitled position‚Äù I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll cry about).
---
And seeing as you agree with enduring, I think that shows it 1 perk for 1. I play killer and I don‚Äôt have any trouble with DS. Why? Because I can work around it all while being aware of my surroundings. Something you should be doing to begin with.
---
But this ‚Äúentitled survivor‚Äù will continue to double pip from both sides. 
---
Without face camping ;)
---
B U B B A B O O B S
---
Okay I know Nurse is the most powerful killer, hands-down. But I cannot say she is overpowered. She requires a serious learning curve in order to be even decent. If I see a good Nurse, I respect it. I've been a player and killer main since launch, and I ***STILL*** can't get the hang of playing Nurse. That complicated bitch...
---
Around 1720 hours
---
The big thing is to not to be afraid of failure, and just try out different things. Learn and experiment to figure out what does and doesn't work for you.  You will get killed as survivor, and you will have people escape as killer. It's an inevitable part of the game, what's important is to be able to learn from it and gradually improve, as well as having fun of course.  
---
Freddy was always a pedo, its just that I believe at the time, they thought straight saying that was too dark, so they toned it down to just child killer, but it was always implied he touched kids.
---
I may be crazy but I regret nothing xd
---
Matchmaking. There are /way/ less re ranks among killers and survivors than any of the other rank groups. The game's trying to be fair by not matching a Rank 5+ with lower ranks.
---
STBFL can also be paired with Mad Grit to make you literally unstoppable on the way to a hook.
---
Whenever this happens to me I say "lol you all died to a trash killer". You always get atleast 1 guy who goes from 0 to REEEEE in 6 seconds.
---
Freddy woth buff
---
Aye crafty hand on Megs tit.
---
Exodia, The Forbidden One.
---
ones a huntress main, the other is a billy main, what do you think?
---
No, as in Rank 1 the lowest level the perk is by default - For instance BBQ and Chilli revealing Auras if they're 52 meters away for 4 seconds, as opposed to rank 2 when it's 46 meters and rank 3 when it's only 40. I fucked up, it's Tier 1, not rank 1. My bad.
---
I use a pure tracker wraith build on xbox. Yes I am a terrible person.
---
We need more answers to camping. :(
---
Have you ever thought about just doing generators?
---
I liked this video so you earned another sub lol
---
I‚ÄôM PRETTY SURE LF‚ÄôS ONLY CAMP BECAUSE THAT‚ÄôS WHAT EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY ASSOCIATES LEATHERFACE OF ONLY BEING CAPABLE OFF. HE IS NOT A CAMPING KILLER, STOP PUSHING THIS BROKEN NARRATIVE!!!!
---
Slippery meat, Up the ante (if it stacks). Other perks, i dont know
---
You wanna cry about unbalanced? There‚Äôs so many things about DBD that are unbalanced which helps make things fair for both sides. Devs admit to so many things needing to be fixed, DS isn‚Äôt anything extraordinary. So guess you‚Äôre continuing on about Jack shit. 
---
If you had the skill, the perk wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Simple as that. 
---
And I‚Äôm crying about my lack of skill? Sure bud. I can hit my skill check. I can loop a killer. I can stop a survivor from hitting DS. I can punish a survivor that uses it. Why? Because I can play killer lol. 
---
Thanks 
---
I could try, but I'd be lying to you.
---
such bravery. 
---
*sheds tear*
---
I always leave Decisive Strike user last, go for the Toolbox survivors first.
---
you aren't using dead hard right if you think its the worst, its saved me a lot of time
---
The change so that lockers hide auras made the perk a thousand times better.   You can hop in a locker before looking around for the killer, then once you confirm what they are doing elsewhere, get back out, and just make sure your camera is pointed down.
---
Still happening?
---
Keys words: ‚Äúyour location‚Äù It‚Äôs not real time, as soon as the generator is done the killer gets x amount of notifications (akin to the way a generator explosion notification works) that show up for 3 seconds. The notifications are not auras and do not move during the 3 seconds after the generator is done. It does not consume a token and distortion will not prevent the notification from appearing. I hope that clears it up
---
Ohh alright. I understand tier 1 perks. 
---
&gt;swamp
---
&gt;good for survivor
---
Nice.
---
Freddy trimmed his nails for the occasion.
---
H E C K
---
Just disconnect, the hatch will most of the time be for the survivor, this time the RNG and the killer outplayed you. Let it go and play another match and accept your loss.
---
I don't know man, zubat plays a lot of huntress and is aim is pretty insane
---
hmm
---
I bound it to a mouse button
---
Um... Kate's kind of looks like Ashley with her winter gear. 
---
Those are some pretty great perks though
---
I'll go if there's candy.
---
Quentin is also licensed so no cosmetics. 
---
I am sure the ratio of crazy, toxic players is about the same between killers and survivors. Just that there is more survivors and they get the chance to gang up which brings it out of people.
---
Have you ever thought about reading an entire post before replying? He‚Äôs clearly stated that he can not walk away.
---
Oh, no, they're... piercing through her heart and coming out the other side of her. You can see it a little bigger in the original drawing I did. https://i.imgur.com/eFVGRWL.jpg
---
Aww, thank you so much. Your comment pretty much made my day. xD
---
Fuck legion.
---
I don't see how they'll do it.  He's terrible in red rank but very strong in grey/green.
---
I think you underestimate how smart killers are and how brutal swf really is, especially when you're up against players who are absolutely above your skill level. When I play killer I never chase the first person I see if I think they're baiting a long chase. If you're going up against super toxic swf you have to play on their level. You can't always rely on a wall being there.
---
Why would I rely on a good end game when I can beat them before the last generator is done? That's so silly. Besides, you don't have to proximity camp to use a survivor as bait. Things such as Nurse's calling (and other killer abilities) can help get you to the survivors quickly.
---
Even then, these strategies work well with killers without speed abilities. I've completely destroyed swf as Freddy (mind you I wasn't in low ranks) without even using the hook bait strategy, but instead using the wake up bait strategy since Freddy can read auras.
---
Relying on end game is a gamble that isn't worth taking. What helps most is understanding survivor psychology and *why* they do things. A survivor who wants to chase is someone you shouldn't be chasing unless they are in a vulnerable situation. A survivor who is playing with their friend will help them over someone who they don't know. Using this knowledge to your advantage helps counter swf and should be implemented whether survivors think it's fair or not.
---
P.S. Camping is never mentioned in this guide because it doesn't work. It's a bad strategy, especially against swf
---
I disconnected. Left the game running for about 20 mins occasionally glancing over buy guy wouldnt budge.
---
Funny how as soon as I disconnected he typed something in french immediately though. Ejat a sad case.
---
I bet you if survivors started focusing on totems, killers would start to complain about that too. If everyone is looking for and cleansing totems, they'll be gone in no time (if they know where to look for them).
---
Really? Never? Not once have you died where you thought the killer was just better or outplayed you?
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Plus a few extra, unless we have different calendars.
---
*honk honk*  ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)
---
im pretty happy i could read the swedish subtitles and kind of understand it
---
Yeah on PC.
---
DBD is the first game where I've had to have game recording ready at a button press just for this kind of situation. What an awful community.
---
Luckily I got it all on shadowplay.
---
Facecamping every person then bodyblocking for hatch for over 20 mins. What a weird little man ü§£
---
IS THIS SATIRE? I DONT KNOW AND ITS MAKING ME ANGRY 
---
Sprint Burst will give you an advantage if you are doing a Gen, the killer approaches, then you can get to a loop safely, so if you are near the loop it will be useless, also if you are unhooked and killer is near, it will probably save your life there, or if you where hooked in the basement, will give you more chances of success to get out and heal. If you have adrenaline, it will also help you big time. 
---
Lithe on the other hand helps you if you are in the loop already, and being chased but if you are not then it might be more difficult to make use of it in the full heath state.
---
Balanced Landing, well you have to find high ground to make use of it, there are some places that you dont even need that much height to make it activate, it has the added benefit of the passive, which might help prolonge the chase a little bit more.
---
Dead Hard can be used to take the extra hit (M1, Hatchets), reach pallets or windows before the killer hits you. reach for a save before the killer downs you. jump over trapper traps, and force him to remove them or step on them. Faint that you will take a hit while killer is carrying someone and you body block. But you have to be near loops to maximize efficiency.
---
These perks are situational, so you have to know the maps and think what gens you will do according to what perks you have, or what areas you will loop/be around before the chase even begins. Also you should learn when you can run and when to stop running, sometimes you can just run to an objective (gen, unhook, loop) while the exhaution is like 2 seconds to be removed, so you can do the running and when you have the chance, stop or do the objective and have the perk ready to use.
---
Now I prefer, Dead Hard&gt; Sprint Burst&gt; Lithe&gt; Balanced Landing
---
Depending on map Balanced Landing can be the best exhaustion perk. It's also extremely good with how even on exhaustion you still get its other benefit. Can also unlock some extremely good loops if you get the right maps. It's my preferred exhaustion perk mostly because of the loops it can give you. 
---
But as a general exhaustion perk for all maps Dead Hard is the best, it just takes a lot more skill to use properly. Although it can save you due to it's i-frames. It can help extend a loop that 1 extra time, or help you make a window, which can make the chase last for a while longer. People dismiss dh due to killers with instadowns, but I personally don't get instadowned that frequently and would prefer to run dh over the 2 below this. Once you learn how to use dh well you'll prefer it as well. 
---
Sprint burst can be good, but it lacks the ability to actually help you most of the time. You get a sprint burst, but you cannot run at all beforehand and you can't run if you want to recover from exhaustion. Plus unlike the other exhaustion perks sb can't really be used in a chase and so once the killer sees you run off with it It's basically an easy down once they see you again while you're still exhausted. It's basically only useful if you have another person with you while you sprint burst away, otherwise the killer just catches up with you and downs you knowing that you can't do anything else in the chase. 
---
Lithe has its uses, but depends on map and positioning far too much when compared with the others and I would rank it as the worst of the 4. It is just too situational and isn't that good in most cases, not when compared to the others. 
---
No problem my dude :)
---
Theyre more useful on your fellow survivors than killers lmao
---
Thanks will try to do as u said definitely more helpfull than trying to figure myself but cant lie video would be cool haha &lt;3
---
Killers do get more bp. I've played killer or gone against some who got a 0k and they still got more bp than some who escaped. 
---
Very informative! Thank you! :D
---
Focus Focus Focus*
---
Ahh. Well, no, this is my original creation. Thank you for your concern, though!
---
Yes but it makes no material difference whether we‚Äôre talking about offerings, items or add ons, they‚Äôre just different categories of thing that alter the rules of the game.
---
Survivors are able to stack their items and their offerings. Multiple mists, stacked luck, purple toolboxes/flashlights/medkits, map+key... survivors also have powerful tools to help them, they‚Äôre just not as strong individually because it‚Äôs an asymmetrical game. 
---
Nice one
---
God, the old mori used to be ridiculous lmfao 
---
The rank system in this game is largely considered bad. "Pointless" would be another way to describe it. "Inaccurate" also works if you're feeling generous. But yeah, generally the rank system is considered bad.
---
Thats fucked up, but kinda funny
---
I'm assuming from a Party Starter? Otherwise that's on you.
---
Thanks. I can't either
---
It wasn't really the BH that gave out more ultra rares but instead the Winter Event with the Mystery Boxes. 
---
A normal bloodweb wouldn't give you 2 ultra rares and 2 rares per web. That said, yes, more BP would result in more ultra rares, but it for sure wouldn't result in what we saw with the Winter Event and it would definitely make the game less grindy as a survivor. 
---
Survivors desperately need a BP bump or at least a re-tweak of how BP is earned (boldness and survival categories being the biggest issues). 
---
MEG IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SURVIVOR WHY DO ALL HER COSMETICS MAKE HER LOOK LIKE A FOOTBALL (SOCCER) MUM OR A STEREOTYPICAL LESBIAN. WE NEED HIGH FASHION LOOKS FOR MEG 
---
Give me one bit of evidence that shows I'm clearly mad. You're just acting spoilt because you're not finding a popular joke funny. Get a grip dude. You lost this one.
---
You absolute monster. I love it. 
---
That's swf for ya. Breaking the matchmaking system every time.
---
Even had a friend verse a rank 3 survivor when he was a rank 20 killer. 
---
Honestly swf should match everyone in the group with a killer near the rank of the highest ranked survivor (so if they have a red rank they verse red rank killers). That's the only way to make it fair. 
---
I didnt see any icon showing escaped which is why I asked. 
---
This is going down in History
---
If you wanna be a survivor at rank 1, you have to find the hatch while on the  run
---
Seeing the kinda tricks she can pull that's a great choice for scaring people--
---
But it's always fun getting a genuine scare in the middle of a bunch of overly serious people. Probably one of the main reasons I play the game in the first place-
---
&gt;Those are AAA flagship titles. 
---
Which explains why there are so much larger in scope compared to DBD. In fact it's night and day to compare them ‚Ä¶ and pointless. 
---
Regardless, there also indie games on consoles that have smaller teams and do more. It's not unrealistic to expect solid performance in a game today even at 30fps. I would play this on PC if not for cheaters and hackers. Which is why I don't game much on PC. 
---
Adrenaline has always been meta. There is a secondary correlation, though, with the healing time nerf. A lot of good survivors just don't bother healing now because it takes too long, and guess what survivors do when they aren't being chased or healing?
---
Ouch.
---
Which means they need to implement cheaper bloodwebs. That way items/add ons are not gonna be in greater number but we will get more perks for the same amount of BPs.
---
An even better counter: Corn
---
&gt;The only bad thing is when randoms feed him.
---
Seriously...
---
2 minutes in someone gets downed and I go try to save them with no Myers in sight and then suddenly he turns the corner and tombstones me. Like seriously who the hell gave him enough juice to tombstone me so early...
---
that was pretty awesome
---
*hears chainsaw* oh fuck
---
If the circle is more obnoxious does it make it more useless?
---
Great to hear man! :)
---
Thanks man, appreciate it :D
---
Whilst that may be true, without his ability he can‚Äôt hurt anyone. So, he pulls a survivor into the dream, and if it‚Äôs a good survivor with good ma knowledge, he can be led on a chase for a while. This leaves the other survivors to do gens whilst Freddy either waits for the survivor being chased to make a mistake or he gives up on them, leaving them to find a way to wake up (with no trouble, since Freddy‚Äôs gone to other survivors) and the cycle repeats itself. The 4 seconds it takes for survivors to fall into the dream is ridiculous, and there are so many ways to be woken up. He may be unfun to play against, but he‚Äôs pretty easy for survivors who know how he works. There‚Äôs a reason that, up until the Legion, he was bottom tier.
---
but you are clearly playing against a nurse so it cant be a character offering, and why would you assume it was a seperation instead of a mori? A mori is multiple times more likely
---
Thanks man, glad u liked it! 
---
Thank you man! 
---
It's not that we're uncultured. We get the reference just fine, it just has nothing to do with anything here in even the slightest fashion.
---
Anyways, while we're spouting off random phrases for no reason at all: Driving across I65 at night 
---
Mcote.
---
I see you haven't seen this sub's thirst for Michael "Daddy" Myers, yet.
---
Did you steal this from the person who posted it like two weeks ago?
---
Cheaper bloodwebs wouldn't lead to greater numbers of addons? Did you quite think that through? 
---
Imma be real honest, I don't spend the entire game obsessing over what the offerings used were so I didn't think about it.
---
Also I've never really understood how the character offerings work because you're not supposed to have perks but I've seen people who have had them.
---
It has to do with big pp tho...
---
Dont expect another until like April. Maybe later.
---
Good ol' insidious nurse with noed and mori behind the gate.
---
That‚Äôs what I did for michael and doctor who are p3 now. Almost had spirit before double bp ended....too bad.
---
Yes I did, duh! Less nodes. You spend your amount you will have the same number of add ons, but more perks.
---
Swishing through metal like a gel
---
Gets chased for 10 min, survivors only get 2 gens.
---
Theyre all pretty much the same tbh. They just each have a different uses.
---
*SPRINTS DOWN STAIRS*
---
As you go towards rank 1, you will see good players, but also very boosted survivors, always playing in SWF. 
---
Survivors using Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Self Care, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Flashlights and Keys. 
---
Killers, more common to see Mori, Ruin, and NOED. Always expect Barbecue &amp; Chilli.
---
In console lots of Spirits, Clowns and ocasionally some Tombstone Mayers, Hillbillies. Not many Nurses.
---
Rerely you see one survivor in Rank one by him\\herself. Generally two or four SFWs. 
---
It gets really boring to always face Ruin but some people actually do commit to gens, without gen tapping. 
---
Generally the first Hooked survivor will be tunneled to dead as having three survivors is way easier for a killer, expect slugging for those three or last two to avoid hatch escapes.
---
A few No Mithers now and then.
---
I think BHVR better do their job of they want me to buy skins or dlc on their broken game (on consoles)
---
Good suggestions, except for not mixing SB and NC. Those perks are not duplicative, and indeed compliment each other. SB means you have a longer period of time to find them with NC; if they know you have NC, they waste even more time running away before healing which in itself takes longer. Win-win.
---
Ran the killer for several minutes? That's a campin'.
---
You're right, I didn't specify enough. BH + box event that gives high rarity items is NOT a wise combination. Survivors gain so little BP because they get to keep their items if they escape. If they got more, we'd have survivors with best items all games, and it'd be in their favor a lot. Franklin's would become mandatory. 
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.  I pretty much exclusively spent points on Jeff, including spending shards in the shrine for more points.  As soon as I saw that handsome bearded man I knew what I had to do.  Sorry Meg/Kate, but there's a new main in town.  After I got about 60 party starters on him, I was going to try to get to 1000 before the event was over but I ran out of perks on the bloodwebs at 420 party starters(got 1 more from a chest later) so that's where it capped at.  May the entity be kind to you and all your bloodwebs.

IM GOING TO PUSH WHAT I EXPERIENCE. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN STOP PEOPLE FROM THINKING LF MAINS CAMP ARE THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY LF. IM NOT GOING TO CONSTANTLY BE CAMPED BY LF AND BE LIKE "NAH LF MAINS DONT CAMP THEY'RE SO FUCKING FUN TO PLAY AGAINST."

Better, then much worse.
---
As a killer main, I would hate to see my 4ks become rare, but I would love to see 0ks become rare at the same time. That's the problem with trying to balance an asymmetrical game. You do have a very fair point though.
---
\*Sad oink\*
---
Pls no
---
I love this, is there more? 
---
Get hooked see not a single person on a gen. Feels bad.
---
Most seen killers on console are: Trapper Wraith Billy Spirit Clown and Hag, that‚Äôs it
---
Thank you
---
No multiplayer 
---
People who do this are pathetic, I hope they get banned.
---
No Just the regular 
---
She‚Äôs a god 
---
You could nerf SWF by adding native voice/text chat and balancing the game under the assumption that the survivors are communicating.
---
whats the game about and what toxic stuff do people do?
---
I guess next time you face a basement leatherface you cleanse the blank totems? That would have been funny if he got no NOED
---
I only give the last guy the hatch if I feel like (s)he deserved it. Not something you HAVE to do, just something that I do for sportsmanship. 
---
I just started playing, and have had quite a few killers carry me to the hatch if I'm the last one. Never really understood why.....figured they just felt sorry for me. LOL!
---
Flair accurate
---
Focus^(Focus)
---
He could have hooked the 2nd dude instead of sitting there camping, waiting for someone to come that was never going to. 
---
As other people have said, mind games/bamboozle/just leaving them to catch them out somewhere else later are all good options.  
---
If you do want to continue the chase though, path 1 is more optimal and will often make it necessary for the survivor to leave or get hit before they get the next vault.  With these walls, the survivor wants to make use of the inside area between the two windows as much as possible and to be able to ensure fast vaults.  From the drawn scenario, they will get a fast vault immediately, then another easy one if you take path 2, but if you take path 1 then you may force them to vault the same window again, except now you're closer or they'll try to make it around to the other and have an awkward angle to get a fast vault/be susceptible to mind games as you could easily go around either side at that point.
---
Without drawing out all the permutations in diagrams myself, generally with these walls it is better to take the inside routes as killer to force the survivors to take the longer outside paths.  Also on Coldwind farms the walls can be seen through, so mind gaming isn't likely to work and if they know how to do this loop properly/you don't have bamboozle then you'd almost definitely not want to waste your time on it.
---
Great job, OP! Would hate to get smacked with that!
---
Killers also complain when survivors survive.
---
It's not about you being ass, it's about your teammates being ass and the killer being good. If you're wasting time finding and cleansing every totem for a perk the killer might not have while your teammates are dying on the hook then it makes you a bad teammate yourself. It's even harder if you don't use small game and when you do you're using up what could be a vital perk slot. 
---
Its so weird and confusing for players to say "Survivors OP" or "Killer is OP". Depending on how recent these stats are, I'd say both sides are at a pretty good place at the moment. Was playing some Trapper today to squeeze some last day 2x BP and I gotta say, I was doing pretty good without tier 3 Ruin. Just the salty and butt hurt players on how they really aren't good I suppose.

Mind you, those killers, David, Jake, and Kate were already level 50 or close to it before the event started so all I had to do was prestige them and get them the perks I wanted. 
---
As a new player, that sounds dumb. If you bested me, finish me. I don't understand the pity stuff. :/
---
If the killer gives me the hatch then I appreciate it, but I don‚Äôt expect it. They‚Äôre just being silly.
---
it‚Äôs really an app where you‚Äôre ‚Äúin college‚Äù and build your dorm and talk to real people but it‚Äôs toxic only if you put your self into bad friendships and relationships ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Hahahahaha.... Ha... Heh
---
I only let the last guy escape if someone rage quits. I always figured that the quitter leaves his team at a disadvantage so I one get away if nothing else. I get some rage messages too but I solved that by having only friends message me. Honestly just be the best killer you can be and screw everyone else.
---
You don‚Äôt do just ‚Äúone gen‚Äù usually its 2 gens equivalent + 2 unhooks and a decent chase and you‚Äôll pip. People say its too easy but 90% of the community won‚Äôt ever hit rank 1. Took me 100 hours to hit rank 1 on both sides. if you want to be good then start getting chased on purpose, learn maps and L and T walls and understand movement speed and when you can get away with not throwing a pallet down. Good players don‚Äôt waste pallets unless they need too
---
"Now that I get a closer look, this isn't even that great. Not that you'll have to worry about that after I break it... your face, that is."

I'll pay you anything to ship a copy of this to my girlfriend please!

This is pretty typical. My wife and I both play (Rank 5 and 2). We typically have a 5-8 minute wait time when trying to play together. Otherwise, 30 - 60 seconds and we're online in separate games. 
---
Sure, let‚Äôs turn the toxicity in this game from a 9/10 to a solid 11/10. Nah but it would be pretty hilarious. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget Susie‚Äôs ugly thumb
---
If a survivor has done something to impress me i might give them a hatch. Otherwise, kill them. The killer doesn‚Äôt owe survivors anything or have to follow the made up rulebook of survivors.
---
I WISH THERE WAS A DEBUFF TO TELL YOU YOUR AURA IS BEING SEEN BY AN OPPONENT SEEMS LIKE AN EASY WAY TO BALANCE OUT BBQ AND CHILI AND OTHER AURA ABILITIES
---
 It's trying to match you with only two players in a lobby and there isn't any. It's most SWF are 3-4 players. So it just takes longer to find two. Hopefully the new match making system fixes that. Dedicated servers will go along way to improving that as well. 
---
It has its ups and downs but the only problem is the turbine of the console when you load up the game 
---
Yup. People always are you crazy? You want to keep them asleep. Sure, but it's not that difficult to put them to sleep, en masse sometimes. But it's difficult to prevent gen progress. This double fuck them up. 
---
Red Hot Chilli Pepper.
---
Whoa what a funny reference they had the cock socks for big pp. Maybe I should start yelling about The World and stopping time next because the owner of the World stole his brother's pp.
---
This is fucking beautiful and you are a great person for coming up with this
---
Yes. I‚Äôm constantly getting to rank 1, when really I should probably be in the 7-10 rank area. I‚Äôm an inconsistent survivor. Sometimes I do well, sometimes I fuck up royally. 
---
Im also done with my teachables just need Two from Claudette and im good until the new survivor  
---
Exodiu's penis
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem toxic per se, but it just sucks to get tunneled as a survivor. Even when you had a chance to hook Claudette, you went back to hook David again. So I‚Äôm sure there was salt there. 
---
After the learning curve, there's no counter play. 
---
And sometimes off the hook too!
---
These all seem fair points. I have been running into multiple swf stacks (I always ask at the end, they usually respond with glee). They stand out, usually they are 2 high ranks, 1 low rank and then some random sole survivor to even out the level discrepancy. This is anecdotal off cours but the most I get is 3-man swf's or none. I rarely get 4 or 2 stacks.  
---
I'm not great at the game (got rank 1 multiple times as killer but that doesn't mean anything) and only have 150 hours in the game. At the moment I'm rank 6: I've gotten multiple swf's with two rank 2/1 survivors and one rank 15 or so and if they are actually good (and not boosted into the heavens), it gets really difficult for a casual like me. But I'm always looking to improve so these tips are great. Maybe another tip: also play survivor. For every 2 killer games I play 1 survivor with an endgame build (selfcare/hope/adrenaline/lithe or balanced landing). It helps a lot as a killer. Against solo survivors but more so against swf's. 
---
Maybe some added general tips when "dealing" with swf's coming from someone with little knowledge in DbD but a lot of experience in other (possibly toxic) competitive games, especially fps games (Day of Defeat, CS 1.6 and later CS:GO):
---
\- If you are feeling the frustration coming up in a game where you ARE getting destroyed, try to laugh about it. I trained myself that if things are going really bad, I just loud out say "damn, I fucking suck." and laugh. It's cathartic. Everything that happens after that doesn't really matter. Now, I'm saying this as who is somewhat older, 20 year old me couldn't have done this. But you can actually practice it and not be a bitchy toxic killer that whines every post game chat. Don't be that guy/girl. 
---
\- If you are getting destroyed and you feel the gen rush flash light save no hook combo coming, don't ever dc. You'll learn nothing about the game mechanics if you just give up, even if you are getting looped into oblivion; you'll learn the maps more and the nuances/different layouts of it. You also give in to toxic swf's (who are in the minority) who will laugh at you over discord or teamspeak. I mean you won't ever see or hear it as the host, but you know deep down it will happen. Don't do that to yourself and don't give them that extra win. Just keep playing till the game is over.
---
\- If I have to guess percentage wise of "toxic swf's" I encounter, I say it's like what, 10 to 20%? And that even seems steep. Most of them are chill if you are chill back, doesn't matter if you 3/4k them or if they all escape. So after the game, always try to be calm and say something like "gg" or "gg wp" if they got out. And even if they are toxic to you because they owned you or you owned them, which rarely happens for me, just say something along the lines of "good luck in your next games. :)" Trust me, that type of swf group will take that information, it'll implode their brain and it will tilt them into a new dimension because they didn't get the satisfaction they wanted.  
---
Also set your profile to private. That's not mutually exclusive to playing against swf's but it'll improve your mental health playing this game. Mine was open for the first 50 hours, I can only endure so many racist words, being called a camper and ascii dick pics. 
---
that meg face tho
---
ugly thumb you say?
---
More and more killers / survivors and perks come up
---
Making it less and less likely to get the perks you want
---
Taking more and more bloodpoints to get anything 
---
Default gain being 1.5x would be fair as fuck
---
I would love to see one of the pig. Oink Oink
---
Thanks, during the making of the Cleaver I got smacked with it in my leg. Luckily it wasn't sharpen but it did leave a bruise.
---

---
I agree and I really like that second idea.  I doubt they‚Äôll do it though.  
---
These developers have no grasp of how to fix their broken end game.
---
Boring
---
Which card game is this?

What?
---
Nowhere on the data does this say that only solo survivors are represented.
---
I had her on the edge of my vision since I looked at Susie first and had a huge ~~boobs~~ WTF moment

Can confirm Quentin is what peak performance looks like.
---
Why'd he let himself go down too tho lmao..
---
Hi, that was me, yes! I'm really glad you liked your DBD goodies! &lt;3
---
I will give the hatch in three cases: if multiple people DC, since I think it puts the remaining players at a big disadvantage; if someone is really good and made the game super interesting; or if someone got fucked over by their team and I feel bad for them. 
---
"Party Starters" not "streamers."
---
The firecrackers.
---
Who?
---
No, it's them seeing you. Then you can be a distraction, but yes, it's bad.
---
https://twitter.com/Jenownzz/status/1080904920025444352
---
When you grab someone but game says "nevermind lol" and you hit survivor instead
---
It would add another level of basement chest camping leatherface
---
This is true, but especially after using streamers you would think the allure of so many blood points would convince them, heck if the killer shows any signs of farming to me i just go with it and it‚Äôs about 50/50 of actual farmers vs people tricking and if they are tricking i can usually get away from them anyway unless they camp
---
Empathy is you seeing injured people.
---
Pacifist is the injured people seeing YOU - so they can run to you and you can act as a distraction for them.
---
Sebastian would probably match better with Anima. Can't really do Laura . But yeah this is the DLC I want. Not the bs they've been pumping out
---
Why are skill checks a problem?
---
I play nurse fairly frequently on console, and the transition from xb1 to xb1x was actually night and day as far as gameplay. 
---
It doesn't really have any iconic or nameable characters to use though. Map would be good though.
---
I would like a timer, but when you down or hook someone the timer gets the exact amount of time of someone bleeding out or getting hooked(that takes some time) maybe add 20 seconds for running to the exit.
---
It's an EAC risk. BHVR won't ban you for it, but if EAC detects the file changes it can auto ban, and that won't be removed.
---
It‚Äôs fun to me i play it in my free time you should definitely try it out  if you‚Äôre interested but to be honest it‚Äôs not all that when you first start you have to kinda build up your room and character and things to learn about it. But I could help if you need any
---
Oohhhhh... you're totally right then! It would be awesome to have them since its not like the Halloween items where it's a reskin but a whole item is gone for like 11 months of the year
---
You can. If you go into controls you can change object interaction and the other one. I have my pallets and windows and lockers set to R1 and my heal, kobe, etc as triangle.
---
:(
---
seems like you‚Äôre the only one with sense around here 
---
Imo I think it should only apply if all other survivors are gone and there's one left. 
---
You get 60 seconds to leave, if you can't find the hatch so be it, leave via an exit gate and you're free. Finding the hatch isn't everything, especially once 1 or more gates have been opened. 
---
It's actually a Nea. 
---
I go for the exact opposite, if a survivor has been looping me well then if I catch them and it‚Äôs third hook they‚Äôre outta here. They played well and he gets a respectful death. However I‚Äôll give hatch to a dumb survivor who did something which I think to myself was cute. Example, there was a jake who clearly was quite new and would just hold w would crouch behind random objects while injured (jake main without iron will) and things like that. Good survivors get death imo 
---
Oh my bad
---
On PS4?
---
That's because most of those at high Ranks are SWF squads.
---
Yeah I figured there would be some risk. 
---
Yeah.
---
i get that but i mean if i wanna heal with for example X, then working on gens is also X. i was suggesting being able to switch for example healing to X and gens to R1.
---
I feel you there. Hes not horrible at rank 1. I've been rank 1 [ignoring rank resets] since right before Pig's release and he may be weak, but any true rank 1 (i dont consider the ones who couldnt get to rank 1 until after rank changes "true rank 1 killers.") killer who's competent can effectively get a 4k with Freddy perkless and without add ons or offerings.
---
holy shit, lmao
---
Mortal Kombat X Mobile
---
I think all Freddy needs is for it to be harder for survivors to get out of the dream world and a slightly bigger lunge (not sure if I'm crazy but I have a hard time landing hits with him). Those are the two major things holding him back imo.
---
I was standing there wondering in dark for 20 seconds where did Spirit get those boobs. üòÖ 
---
When I feel sorry for someone , he is mostly the guy who got sacrificed first.. farmed from his teammates. I always try to kill  the obsession. DS people dont deserve the hatch
---
That's a good explanation!
---
Just yesterday, I got called out by a survivors for allegedly taking the game hostage, due to how the last 3 gens were. Yet the survivors were the ones who stuffed the gen placement up....
---
I play both sides, but killer more recently, and am sick to death of hearing certain rules or whatnot when it shouldn't matter.
---
üòé 
---
Your brain must be a magnificent place... The work of a genius
---
I mean, there isn't much we can do but that's not too big an issue, because who is gonna want to heal and do gens side by side?
---
yeah but there's only 3 tokens and at max level it's 10 seconds per token.
---
So Freddy makes the perk utterly useless in 30 seconds.
---
Whoever meme directed this video is a god
---
Ah, alright. Then I assume you are showing off how incompetent your team was with the gens.
---
Playing legion probably boosted you. Most survivors are trash and if you're struggling with noed nurse then you need to practice the mechanics better
---
Well changing it to X would also be bad since that changes some other actions. Like pebbles.
---
Yes dad
---
I'm not the poster
---
Damn that's good content, wish i could edit to save my life ;-;
---
Says it does he.
---
I-
---
I saw the blue of your flair and for some reason thought your whole name was blue.
---
Big oof.
---
I'm not struggling with NOED Nurse, I just have to actually try, and survivors seem to be really good at breaking line oc sight (and I keep fucking getting Coldwin Farms, and I'm red-green colorblind).
---
Only gamers can say the n-word stop trying to oppress us
---
Well, there is nothing I can help with that shit map, lmao.
---
Coldwind is bad for Killers regardless of colorblindness.
---
a lot of survivors feel entitled to escape and forget that killers are playing the game to win too. they're just being childish
---
It's nowhere near as bad for tunneling as green ranks where.
---
Ruin and bbq however....yeah deffo
---
Not gonna happen sonny jim. Killers don't like shitty killers either.
---
Ipmvoe
---
been playing dbd on console since it came out. And if you really say you can't notice FPS issues then you are delusional, go play another game for an hour or two and then get back on DBD, shits nauseating.
---
Watching people actually have fun is a far cry from the rest of the community. I love this
---
As long as you don‚Äôt frequently DC and/or are not cheating like lag switching or others then those have no meaning behind them and it‚Äôs just people who don‚Äôt understand what is banable
---
Botany is 100%. Like...no comparison. 
---
Ewww
---
I just can't notice the FPS issues. I play a lot of other games and I still don't notice everytime I come back.
---
Oh that's hot, too much hot
---
It goes hand in hand when the other Survivors trip over their dicks to protect them in-game. 
---
not my proudest fap
---
In the given situation there were 3 spawns like this. When I went for any other survivor, they did the same, but somewhere else.
---
Killers are there to kill survivors (gasp!). Ebony Mori helps them do just that. If the killer could see that survivors will be burning BPS beforehand, then perhaps the killer would be more willing to hold off on the mori. I know I would, anyway. But by default, most killers go into each match expecting the worst and must be prepared for anything; that is, if the goal is to win matches and rank up.
---
Is meredith supposed to be nea xD 
---
There was another post a while ago that was similar to your whisper concept. Basically the other three members randomly went around staying near walls and such then would tell you that a survivor was in their line of sight. 
---
I loved that idea, of course there wouldn‚Äôt be a real ability if it was just that though just a great passive.
---
I don't know about PS4 Pro, but the regular PS4 and the slim suffer from some fucking awful framerate issues, constantly.
---
Have you played Nurse lately?? Blinking with her is like watching a fucking slideshow, it's borderline broken and un-useable. 
---
Also, they said we'd get four killers with the Legion, and people only got two, who look almost the same except one as boobs. Doesn't help that Susie and Frank look 10x cooler than the other two as well.
---
Low quality shitpost.
---
Coming from someone who didn't even buy the Legion, I think it is kinda bs that people were promised 4 and only got 2 and had to pay for the nicer ones. 
---
I recommend trying Nurse and blinking, you'll see just how bad the framerate can be, especially if a Survivor or three is on your screen and moving.
---
Stop bitching on reddit and play the fuckin game

You gotta drink some water and get some sleep, buddy.

Freddy isn't going anywhere.
---
I'll try that.
---
but why?
---
show bobs and vegana
---
You can't, he's pretty broken right now. 
---
4 no mither OoO just to confuse the killer
---
Did you saw this EXACT one on Instagram? I made this myself 
---
Ping doesnt always indicate someone has bad internet. I've gone into plenty of stable 80-150 ping games only to see it shoot up to 300 in game.
---
 If you knowingly have bad internet, you're ruining everybody else's game. 
---
These are amazing! How does one go about trying to get one ;) 
---
what are you doing then talking to me then? I am defending swf and your trying to attack it aka complaining
---
You can typically tell if a SWF is baiting you. They cant help themselves. They will usually use the "come here" gesture and then always teabag at pallets. The second you see any of that, walk away. 
---
This survivor will then start trying to bait you into going after them constantly instead of working on gens. You will be chasing someone else and you will see them teabagging or flashlight spamming off to the side, trying to piss you off enough to chase them. Ignore this person. 
---
Yes, me and my friends have all been crashing a ton lately. Classic Dbd. 
---
darn you are right

but

Console nurse isn‚Äôt garbage when you master her..

During the pick up animation, u cant stun them. Once they finish the animation and can start moving, that's when it will work. Same with flashlight blinds vs flashlight saves

Take your upvote, good sir.

Freddy that uses Fire Up = Smol PP

Underrated

Strangest boner ever

You could complain equally that rank 1 is p3 claudettes and decisive strikes every game. It is unfortunate, but at the upper tiers of the game you need to use some of the best stuff to give you that little bit of an edge since the people you go up against also use optimal builds. Ruin and BBQ are just a symptom of being too good as perks for the role they fulfill so you see them all the time. As for tunneling... Every suvivor player complains they were tunneled or camped on pretty much any game they lose, but if you look at it beyond just what you personally got to see in the game it usually isn't how it actually was.
---
Okay two things.
---
First, love your name, hello fellow Whovian.
---
Second, I actually mean garbage in relation to PC Nurse. PC and Console are two different beasts entirely.
---
True.
---
Who elseüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
NOOOOOHG
---
huntress and nurse are hard counters to t-bagging once you are good at them. Just need to practice until you can punish the toxic assholes that want to get a rise out of you.
---
Where did I say that ping indicates a bad internet connection? I didn't. Ping indicates your connection to the host server, which if it is red then you should expect a laggy match. 80-150 is still yellow ping and generally acceptable in most games, you just have to deal with the minor lag and input things slightly in advance. 
---
I agree that if you have bad internet you shouldn't play killer, however that wasn't the question that was asked. OP can't be banned just because his internet was bad. He also stated that survivors had yellow-red ping, so they knew going into the match that it would be laggy to some extent. 
---
So I do not see why you needed to input your opinion into this. 
---
this video dates back to when Myers had complains about being too OP and ultra-rare perks existed :')
---
 When you use someone else's photo that they took and posted on here, you should credit them. Imo
---
Gen Rush as his chasing others, by the time he gets one person on hook you should be 2-3 generators done.
---
Only thing is alot of people are trolling with Legion now and camp hooks.
---
Honestly just play like it was Day 1 of DbD, play for yourself when you play against legion and just go for gens/survive, don't try to unhook anyone unless you see him chasing someone else
---
Too true man, had to download a mod to set my resolution to like -114, but hey it runs at 30 fps
---
Nice. 
---
I normally just give them out over Twitch (RoryDiesALot), but I ordered a bunch, happy to send some out. Send me a private message and let me know where to send yours!
---
I would buy these. If she made them for sale, I‚Äôd buy by perfect billy build set :3
---
Not saying its anything major just a possible solution to a mildly infuriating problem. It happened once today as a killer and I noticed it again when playing survivor. I remember I had to quit the game for a while because it was happening nonstop, but then again I was playing against level 1 survivors. The worst time Ive had it was playing freddy and the whole team had both gates open and everyone decided to chase me somehow with flashlights.
---
Oh I agree that being hard tunneled and having your hook patrolled is incredibly boring, but on the flipside getting genrushed is boring for the killer. Like I said both sides have something to complain about and it all comes down to what the scenario in game is and what the person's playstyle is. 
---
A killer might be losing and wanting to guarantee a kill to slow the game down, so it sucks for the tunneled survivor but it is understandable in that situation. 
---
I personally like to try and 2 hook everyone and will only 'tunnel' if I see that survivor before I see anyone else. So I will sometimes tunnel without meaning to, but I also don't patrol hooks unless I saw someone closeby then I'll search for them. 
---
It is a stun yes
---
If I was Myers, I‚Äôd choose Trapper over Pig any day.
---
That‚Äôs what you meant by the love triangle, right? /s
---
When I used one it didn't show me any perks for myself, does it just show it for the survivors?
---
I get that thats why I said just add some other thing to balance it. Im not saying I want the killer to win or anything, just for the end game to be a little less toxic at least but I get it.
---
If you play with team mates you liked, Just try and friend them. I've made several friends this way. 
---
I can‚Äôt do that YET, but I recommend buying the Dark City set, you‚Äôll use the head and skirt a TON, and use the scotch plaid shirt for nea, use p2 legs, dark city head, w/ scotch. The best nea outfit to date.
---
They really need to work harder on balancing. One of the funnest part of this game is the perk system, but seeing the same perks over and over again makes the game so stale. It's almost predictable what perks each killer will have at this point; Nurses and Huntress with Nurse Calling, Billys with Unrelenting/Spirit Fury, Myers with M&amp;A, etc etc. It's just lame.
---
Imagine a prestige 3 Claudette. You know how hard it is to see her? This offering makes every survivor that hard to see. God forbid Claudette is actually the one who used it
---
Also keep in mind that just because a survivor can run to a safe place, it doesn't mean they will.  Against strong survivor groups, you often have to find the weakest link to start with because getting hooks started quickly is important and leads to big snowball potential frequently.  Catching that weak link can force the stronger players into worse areas of the map where you can catch them more easily.  It's almost always that even in a 4 stack swf, at least one of them is going to be much easier to catch than the rest.  It's not 100% of the time though and if you do get unlucky enough to have all 4 very skilled survivors on a favorable map for them, and you're not playing a top tier killer(possibly only nurse), well then good luck.
---
thats like rank 10 at best :D
---
Cool that‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôll check out the stream too! 
---
Yea I know, this was more of a rant ig than a suggestion anyways.
---
Try deleting that exe and verifying
---
I had my immediate family whom live far away come visit me for that week and I was also working... I love them and need moneys but I'm still sad to have missed out on those sweet bp. 
---
Legion is abysmal at moving across the map. Each survivor should be on one gen and survivors should try and be across the map from each other as much as possible.
---
If you get found, you will get downed, as you would against any decent killer, player but Legion you can run around a bit longer more easily. Pay attention to when Legion starts their Frenzy and try and time Frenzy ending with you going through a window or over a pallet.
---
&gt; so far I've never been able to really escape legion without getting hooked as a result
---
I think this mindset that you *need* to escape and not get hooked is why so many survivors here have trouble tbh
---
Its not really about me getting mad, its just annoying when it happens back to back.
---
Oh my gOD  
---
you're mad, my dude. You literally have the potential to become a serial killer. Not only you played killer on console, no, no, no, you did it with unreliable-hitbox hatchets AND prestige 2.
---
So for me it's super hard. The last three games I didn't get a pip. All around 10-14 k bloodpoints (yeah I know it's not that much but I am not that good). Simply because I didn't do a chase with the killer or did have no altruistic BP. Sucks for me. I take the game quite easy and always try to remember it's just a game but it bothers me nevertheless... 
---
Sounds better than what I said tbh
---
I play on xbox usually and ps4 occasionally and tbh they are the exact same, both choppy and lots of stutters.
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
Can you enlighten me on what add-ons and combos are the best for him? 
---
I myself use range and skillcheck ones. Kinda does the same thing as cubes, but instead of finishing transition sooner, you start it earlier. And pill bottle looks like a godlike add-on because of the mindgame potential. 
---
I appreciate it.
