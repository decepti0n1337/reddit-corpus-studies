If he can curve he's going to chainsaw you lmao, people who have loads of hours on billy won't m1 if you're in healthy state
---
---
---
:(
---
Depends on your playstyle.
---

---
If  you like to be focused by the killer, dead hard, BL, selfcare and adrenaline are good.
---
If you want to play stealthy, spine chill, bond, exhaustion perk (dh, bl, sprint burst), iron will.
---
No, there’s a chapter called last breath or some shit. They always do it
---
Thank you~
---
It's meant to look gruesome and horrifying. Your opinion sucks.
---
Trapper!!!!
---
It's actually one of the better ones. Her face being screwed up is a reference to teasers released alongside her, it's similar to her father's mask
---
Ok now this is the most wholesome thing I've seen yet
---
I guess it makes sense lore wise but it's essentially a bug F U to any new players that play against this person.
---
Oh jeez thank heavens!!!!!  I only have been playing for 3 months.
---
S p o o k y
---
That’s your opinion so don’t state it like a fact
---
&gt;Well that’s a lie. Plus proves my point. Can’t go inside a killer
---
Lol What? When Michael or ghost face stalks you, you can go through them/inside them. But alright.
---
Happened to me a few times on Xbox as well don’t know how to fix though
---
Yeah lots of people just get dead hard and wglf then never pay attention making them not notice the tattoo
---
Oh shit lmao
---
I Mixed 2 questions, sorry  for that.... although I wanted to know if the prestige blood is a specific skin, I know the answer now so it's okay. Still I wanted to ask you who you prestiged first as I like meg because of some skins I got on her that are very colourful so basically a killer magnet. I thought about levelling Claudette to make stealth possible, how was your approach ?
---
I find it very amusing when they respect a fake pallet
---
no just no... seriously can’t believe I’m having this convo anymore. You don’t play both sides and definitely not ghosty boi
---
i think there is a bug with that specific pallet, i have seen many people posting how it happened to them at the same pallet and once it happened to me as well
---
You’re right, and if I had to guess why that is, it’s because there isn’t any substantial penalties for DCing at the moment. But that should be changing once the planned dedicated servers come out and they start tracking DCs
---
I think she just needs some of her addons to be made stronger.  A lot of them feel pretty useless.  I think her base kit is fine however.
---
I liked it until I noticed the weird growth/sack things then it became to gross for me
---
Ever hear about a total and beautiful 180? My friend, Steve is the definitive comeback kid, bar none. Keep watching.
---
Wait to reload with the Nurse is Impracticable as she is the slowest killer in the game. While survivors are doing a generator from all the way across the map, she will just walk towards them in this way.
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
Watch a Plague down multiple survivors in your lobby with her infectious fright and the corrupted purge you just fed her and then reread the comments on this post.
---
Im getting the same thing on both killer and survivor. Never happened before until about 20min ago. Restarting didn't help.
---
DC 10x to go back to fun matches
---
WAIT A SMALL ETERNITY FOR A KILLER GAME ONLY TO SEE RED PING AND IMMENSE LAG IN THE MATCH. SO MUCH FOR DEDICATED SERVERS!!
---
Yeah bro i don't wanna be shitting my pants mid game setting this skin
---
You mean things you miss read since in both articles it clearly states it's a feature officially available to developers and you said, and I quote:
---
&gt;Its in Beta phase and its not official if it will become a full feature. Theyre most likely test before the ps5 comes out. 
---
Two spoons of misinformation and one of conjecture. 
---
Just to end it, it's not in beta and developers are already taking advantage of that feature.
---
No u
---
I personally like to run Sprint Burst, Light Weight, Urban Evasion, and Spine Chill
---
I'm not very good at chases yet, but i'm getting better. Sprint burst gives me a head start if the killer is near, or just gets me to generators faster, Lightweight helps cover up my tracks, Urban definitely helps me be stealthy, and spine chill gives me those extra seconds to be aware that the killer is probably approaching. 
---
I do swap out Spine Chill with DS once in a while so I can practice the skill checks.
---
Read what it says. You get lost 38 points for survivors being hooked and gained 37 for survivors getting unhooked.  Points not unhooks. Check the DBD wiki for more info
---
Steve's Perks are okay, none really to write home about. Nancy has a top perk and a middle perk, Inner Strength and Fixated respectively. 
---
All of The Demogorgons perks are not good, none have any real play. The killer itself is fun and intuitive, it's not Nurse or Spirit level but it's good overall.
---
That thing...is pure evil...much darker than your entity could ever be. He isn’t man nor is he ghost....he’s just a shape in the shadows..
---
It’s weird because I can play killer just fine, I only get disconnected when I try survivor.
---
Prayer beads are annoying too. Still that's 1 add on that never drops. Just because a killer is good doesnt mean it should be dc worthy but still, billy and spirit are constantly disconnected against. Nurse doesnt count shes a bitch. I've had people dc to freddy and I asked why and they said op. Just cause a challenge is in front of you doesnt mean you pussy out and never get better. Plenty of red rank survivors can joke spirits and that's cause they stay in the game.
---
What I've noticed is that the Demogorgon is really easy to joke when he uses his Shred, is that something you've noticed too? Nurse is so fun for me! I usually just slug with Nurses and deerstalker. I get a lot of angry messages afterwards.
---
Yes indeed it was. Thank you :)
---
I want the hallowed blight skins I grinded for.
---
Meh, there's many plays you can do with Inner Strength, DS and Head On, which I've seen tons of survivors using in my games as Killer and Survivor.
---
Surge is garbage and maybe the worst killer gen perk out of them all. Granted it can work with say Thrilling Tremors or Surveillance, but those two perks that still aren't as good as Pop Goes The Weasel or Ruin. Which you would take instead of of all other gen perks pretty much. Infact it doesn't even come close.
---
So perk wise, 2 good survivor ones, everything else is an afterthought and the Killer is Mid-High tier.
---
Bricky* lol
---
GOD I HATE SWF! HIGH RANK SUCKS DICK BECAUSE EVERY MATCH HAS 4 SWEATY BOIS THAT WILL LOOP YOU FOR DAYS UNLESS YOU PLAY SPIRIT OR NURSE, THEN HATE YOU FOR PLAYING SPIRIT OR NURSE! I JUST HAD A SQUAD DC JUST TO DENY ME KILLS AS PLAGUE AND LEGION! GODDAMN LEGION! THE WORST KILLER IN THE GAME! I GOT RUN AROUND FOR THREE GENS JUST FOR PEOPLE TO DC WHEN I STARTED GETTING ACTUAL HOOKS! EVEN THE LAST SURVIVOR ESCAPED BECAUSE THE SECOND TO LAST DC'D TO GIVE THEM THE HATCH! WHO THE FUCK THINKS THIS GAME IS KILLER-SIDED?!
---
It was just so I could take a smaller screenshot so I put it near the avatar
---
Horrible is a compliment for killers
---
I DID TWO DAILIES AMD UNLOCKED SEVERAL GOOD PERKS ON BILLIE DURING THE LAST HOURS OF THE BLOOD HUNT SUNDAY NIGHT! I CAME HOME FROM WORK MONDAY TO FIND THAT IT HAD ALL RESET! THE DAILIES WERE UNDONE! BBQ3 AND WHISPERS3 MISSING FROM BILLIE'S LOADOUT! EVEN AFTER REDOING THE DAILIES I ONLY GOT HALF THE BP AND DIDNT GET ANY GOOD ADDONS OR PERKS FOR MY CHAINSAW BOY!
---
I KNOW I WASTED TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS GAME BUT HAVING IT WASTE THE TIME I WAS WASTING ON IT MADE ME UNINSTALL!
---
You can literally see Trapper's face in some of his masks, and he's just some dude. Legion have faces under their masks. It wouldn't be weird to add a human killer, especially when most of the killers already are.
---
I hope not.
---
Ahaha
---
But this is the thing. In this Clip it is seen that no one was hooked, so I am a bit confused. Maybe if someone is Injured
---
Can we petition for Susie to become a Survivor cus like she's 100% miserable being the killer, she's only there for Joey, and like, she needs to do better than this. She is so soft and cute and nice
---
But... The locker was there.
---
He's not getting one at a jungle gym, or any safe loop. So I guess he's just gonna have chase me for a few minutes if he wants it that bad, which is a-okay with me. (meanwhile 3 gens done)  
---
I'm not saying he's bad. He just doesn't even touch spirit or nurse is what i'm saying.
---
He was tunneling every unhooked survivor, and I had just unhooked that injured person. I was willing to take a chase for the team but then that happened.
---
I continue as normal, sometimes if i'm in a decent mood i'll just practice my chases, but mostly I just play as I normally would.
---
He was tunneling. I was just ensuring my team got away.
---
Same.
---
Right... but I was running in the direction of the window... and then did a sharp turn into the locker... sooo... I shouldn’t go in the locker if I was running to the window... ... ...
---
My turn to repost next
---
Just wake up lol
---
I’m glad you like it
---
They probably just think you're a dick. Especially if they don't remember you.
---
Give kuzenbo a gun
---
Mayhaps
---
True the jockey is fun in l4d2 where you can play as one
---
Meh, not really a problem. Console survivors will be fine, I came from console and still use controller for survivor on PC. Playing as killer on the other hand, a bit more difficult but easily doable. I only use KB&amp;M for Nurse and Huntress. Though BHVR could implement KM&amp;B use for console just like Fortnite did.
---
Surge is a good perk in what game? Not in dbd
---
Hears terror radius: And I oop
---
I don't think the game can read your mind or intentions. You were closer to the locker, so you went into the locker.
---
Nothing was changed with "lag" though. Maybe you're getting laggy killers, but that has nothing to do with the update.
---
He is really easy to juke and not easy to juke, with his shred, think of it very similar to a very fast billy with speed limiter with a smaller hitbox and almost 0 horizontal movement when you shred. You can round the ability quickly as a survivor if you predict when he unleashes the Shred (Easy), but if you are on course to be hit by the shred you're not getting out of it (Hard), at least billy had a big ass hitbox with some horizontal movement.
---
I love nurse too and I infact mainly play her, Pig and Hunters :3
---
Hope that made some sense!
---
Love him or hate him this guy is spitting straight facts
---
GoOd BiLlY sTaYs At LoOps
---
If anyone gonna get a rework wraith or clown first. She still has a chase helper and gen slowdown.
---
 Shes good, if its a rework for pig i hope its to feel more like saw. Like survivors are put in a situation to fvckk each other to remove traps or take the long route and work together. Like the saw movies
---
I'm digging the concept greatly 
---
Just a couple tweeks and it could have that BHVR verified feel
---
No idea tbh, never have the issue as killer and only started getting it recently as surv
---
Play her without add ons at first so you get used to her base blinking movement.
---
Also don't be afraid to lose matches without so much as a 1K. It'll be rough for a while. Make sure you play as a survivor, too since here you can learn the way survivors think/move so you can anticipate and blink correctly in a chase.
---
Rank 20 spotted
---
Maybe taunt him at the pallet?
---
You think chili is over powered?
---
Running infonites that are only infinitesimal because the Killer is a baby? Not toxic. Abusing bugs where vaults aren't blocked or you can fat shame? Toxic.
---
Yeah... Someone said to me it was good in this thread too, idk what planet they're on.
---
It's because of dedicated servers. They're terrible
---
I agree with the game being weird lately, but it’s just not a fact at all to say killers have it better. Both sides have their good and bad parts, but they’re pretty equal at this stage of the game. Hopefully your survivor experience will get better in the future.
---
Every 2 minutes.
---
[removed]
---
🎶🎶HEER COMES THE TRAPPER
---
WATCH OUT FOR HIS TRAPS🎶🎶
---
Honestly all he needs is to remove the slow down when holding bottles and when throwing it. As it stands now when he is throwing he is moving at the same speed or possibly slower than a running survivor.
---
I didn't have that luxury, I was doing what was best for my team not for my safety. Idc about getting hit, I care more about my team getting out alive.
---
Welp youll get your super cool bloody skin, wich is really cool, and there will be tons of ebonys in the bloodweb along with more rare addons. I say yes, I prestiged two killers I main including Freddy and am super happy with that. 
---
Its not something you regret. It took time to get wanted teachables from other killers, before hitting p3, so it would make sense, but that bloody everything pays it off. 
---
Earlier I read some posts about point in prestiging, but opinions are 50/50 - yes/no so decided to figure it out by myself and am satisfied with it. Figure it out by yourself for yourself :) You wont lose anything, only gain.
---
I was rank 6 a few days ago and am now rank 3 and still getting camping and tunnelling killers. Starting to get sick of the game, this shit has been happening since the Stranger Things chapter and double BP event. Not much has changed so idk why it's like this now
---
You're a red rank. It's not "balanced" for YOU to play against low rank killers. Think about someone else for a change instead of you just wanting easier matches for you and your friends.
---
Also, deranking because you can't win is a pussy move.
---
Rank 7, but nice try.
---
Switch user here. What is the benefit of not including Leatherface or Freddy? Are there killers/survivors not available on the PS4 that are available on other platforms?
---
Wholesome as FUCK
---
I used to flick my stick back and forth until i watched my brother playing and he was doing the circular motion instead. Now i only do the flicking when im mega panicked.
---
What is the broken emblem system?
---
Listen I'm iffy on the changes too but we gotta wait and see instead of insulting the devs plus we're getting a PTB to test it meaning it could change
---
he also brought up reasons why people hate her by accident, he legit said she is a bit harder then legion... tell me why a top tier is almost as easy as one of the simplest killers in the game?
---
Way too easy to pip on survivor, means we get potato survivor teams.
---
They have announced 3 add-on changes. Wait until PTR is out and get full context before making such drastic, whiny complaints.
---
Honing stone base kit wouldn't be OP
---
In fact, trapper would still suck since that isn't why he's bad. Most trappers don't leave their traps for too long. 
---
Trapper spends too much time setting up, he should just be like hag. Carry his traps all game.
---
I have just the solution.
---
Mori.
---
He pallet Freddy is so boring, ngl
---
Into rank 1 you go. . . Only suffering will you find
---
Incredible rebuttal.
---
Ok and? Isn't it supposed to look horrifying?
---
i hope you're joking because if you're not that means you're a tunneler, the only reason to be angry at ds is if you're a tunneler which is a shitty and unfair way to play the game , which, usually means you aren't good enough to win so you use it as an underhanded way of unfairly winning, here i go into -karma again also imagine downvoting someone saying noed is toxic and not someone who says ds is toxic, this some backwards ass bullshit guys
---
What's that? Why I'm not feeling either salty or superior? What's that feeling? Is this... ^wholesome ^?
---
I can I just did. It's actually better and slowing down gens compared to Surge. It's bad, very fucking bad. I would be surprised if it is not buffed soon that's how bad it is.
---
And FYI, Thana was gonna be buffed to 24%, but it didn't cause it was too strong (By the Devs Ofc, I think it would have been fine), so you're saying Thana should be 20%? 18%? 22%?
---
If not Thana, Dying Light would be fine too. Thana over the course of the game slows more Gens than Surge. It's bad, very fucking bad infact.
---
You’ve never been rank 1 lmao, you lose a game you drop out, so you just float between 1-2
---
When i play as her, she just doesn't feel like a completed character and when i go against her, I dont feel like I'm actually terrified like the people in Saw are. With Freddy, Myers, Ghostface, and Demigorgon, I am actually stressed and scared. They can be anywhere. When I'm going against Amanda, I just more or less feel like "oh goddammit, im going to have to run my ass around for a few minutes to remove this bear trap". I feel like she just needs a rework. She can keep her bear traps but they either need to be able to be replineshed like how the Huntress Hatchets, Demigorgon Portals, Hag Traps, and Freddy Snares can. That or the bear traps need to be more dangerous like how Trappers Traps are. She's not scary. She's just an annoying stall killer

I can get a steady 100 on Low and now that they’ve added temporal anti aliasing to the low setting it doesn’t look nearly as terrible. It’s definitely come a long way from launch cause I used to get awful hitches and they’ve recently vanished :)
---
I'm so putting the head of this outfit on the schoolgirl body and I can't be stopped
---
Every survivor is clearly using stake out.
---
Technically no, but they are still irritating to play as killer, especially against swf where literally everyone runs to the infinite when they get the opportunity.
---
Dedicated servers today
---
Nah you just aren’t considerate of the fact that you’re facing other human beings.  Or I guess rather you value your enjoyment over them having a bad time. But again, you play how you do, but hiring a survivor who is going for an unsafe unhook and then focusing the person that did the unhooking is usually better for the killer than just waiting to hit the person being unhooked.
---
omg is it internet funnyman psychic pebbles?

$499.98 chapter
---
a survivor wasnt hosting the match, they are testing the public servers today. As for the 5 survivors thing, never heard of that, so im almost inclined to believe that you were simply mistaken on killing the first one?
---
I didnt say it was horrifying i said it was horrible. they do not mean the same thing.
---
This is supper cute &lt;3
---
Pop goes the weasel for killer(because it lasts more than 5 seconds)
---
Probably Adrenaline for survivor but other perks can really shine when you build around them.
---
He acts like it
---
I think a patch for the ranking should be coming soon it’s just that it takes a long time for Nintendo to verify updates for games
---
On console, you have to embrace the low frame rate. It affects both sides. 
---
Survivors 360’ jukes are super effective, it’s very easy to get lost between frames. 
---
Killer perks that affect skill checks are buffed like Overcharge. Nearly impossible to hit. 
---
But most importantly, the low resolution makes us heavily rely on our ears. Buffing stealth killers. And in my opinion, making that ‘quiet while injured’ perk the best survivor perk in the game.
---
It happens. You can kill all 4 people and depip.
---
Nancy is a hoe! She has really good perks though, I totally agree with you on that.😂
---
if ash doesnt say groovy ill riot
---
Swf makes noed a joke, all you need to do is give simple communication on how many bones are left
---
Man I hate endfury, it feels so unfair. But on low tier killers I understand I guess. 
---
I as a survivor am taught to get the stun, now stun punishes me. Darn, throw early? Inefficient. I'll be dead and screw my team unless they genrush.
---
Ayo wtf
---
Alright, that’s cool and all, but just remember: the next time you get matched with a rank 16 who can’t hold a chase for more than 20 seconds, you must let them go, otherwise it becomes a game for you to target them for being the weakest member of the team.
---
Since when did being bad at a game become legitimate grounds to complain about the other team?
---
There is playing to have fun and then theres playing just to win. Also, by what I mean tryhard I mean red mori, ultra rare addons, slugging, 4k or rage.
---
And then at end screen you find out the dwight was the only red rank and says gg ez.
---
I am very sorry
---
Pro tip: Pressing the vault key while hitting the window at the same time is just as fast as pressing the vault key from a distance. This is because the survivors start the vault right as they hit the window, started the vault early just locks you into the animation by auto running your character to the window and then vaulting as you touch it. Your survivor doesn’t actually lift themselves over the vault any earlier if you press the vault key early (sorry it’s hard to describe). 
---
Think carefully when vaulting near other objects that can be interacted with (injured/dying survivor, pallets, gens, totems and lockers).
---
????? Opt in to the console side aka play how everyone plays rn?
---
There is this bait I do when I play dream pallet Freddy , what I usually do is nodd my head when to go towards a real pallet and 40-60% of the time they leave that area
---
there will no be blink spam and u must to player her in the smartest possible way
---
anyway there are addon for charge asap
---
actually she is just broken
---
need to be nerfed
---
Just keep crawling! Just keep crawling! Just keep Crawling crawling crawling!!
---
She basically negates chases/loops. You can't mind game the killer when you can't see her and she can track you with sounds easily. Her travel distance while using her ability allows her to patrol the map pretty fast as well.
---
Hehe
---
Thanataphobia by itself is literally pointless, the 8% ADDITIONAL regression from Surge is actually more useful. The only reason you would run Thanataphobia is because you want survivors to heal and slow down the healing, in which case sloppy is better than Thantaphobia, at least by itself it is better.
---
The reason surge + surveillance is useful on stealth killers is because it gives you information which you can then use to potentially sneak up on survivors.
---
We're not so different, you and I
---
Are you on console or PC? I usually either go with Michael, Pig or Legion. ^-^
---
I’m learning to main ghostface rn, and I’m clapping cheeks in the red ranks. Is it really that rare?
---
Maybe I’m only doing well cause no one knows how to counter him
---
When holding a bottle he has no slowdown. When throwing, he has a 1 second cooldown that's the same speed as Plague cooldown, Billy cooldown, etc.
---
it would be balanced if it had a risk/downside to it
---
Her phasing ability allows her to move fast af and can see scratch marks and survivor breathing and moaning but they can’t see her(they only see where she was and the sound of her phasing but they can’t if they’re in her terror radius) 
---
All u need is a headset to play spirit lol
---
Oh no his internet points 😰
---
I acknowledged that, but you said you just misread about the beta, and in fact you misread the whole article and spread misinformation. 
---
And it seems that you're misreading again. Both articles say it's a ***FULL FEATURE AVAILABLE TO ALL DEVELOPERS*** and only IGN says anything about an official announcement, and they still confirmed said feature to be available (based on the article from Wired).
---
You're just wrong, no two ways about it.
---
I play PS4 OCE and have a average wait time of 3-5 minutes unless you play past 11pm than it can get up to 10 minutes
---
Having a genuine green/yellow/brown rank in red rank games is WORSE than somebody instantly disconnecting. 
---
If there are multiple low ranks you should just dodge.
---
If u play on PS4 I feel u.. I almost broke my headset coz that bs
---
Vaulting and dropping pallets causes lag somehow don’t know how to explain
---
Ye Idm billy a good billy can be a pain in the arse sometimes tho
---
Well yeah, the killers are going to look horrible, they are monstrous serial killers that are trying to kill you.
---
U only lose 1 pip when dc now :(
---
I just won a rank 3 game with no perks or addons. Xbox btw. I don’t think survivors there really know how to counter him yet.
---
Freddy is completely immune to borrowed time tho.
---
Wanna come to pc?
---
It’s from an old rockstar game called manhunt it got banned in some countries when it came out but the game’s pretty solid also has a great soundtrack imitating 80s horror slasher flicks
---
Prob coz he’s fun to play n isn’t shot tier like most killers
---
*light speed
---
That would have given me nightmares as a kId
---
Yeah keep ignoring the other stuff, good on you
---
Original is sacrier
---
Make her 105% speed when out of blinks
---
This reminds me of something that happened to me I was playing some Ghostface and i down a survivor at a pallet and I pick them up and then I see this scoops ahoy Steve running at me at MACH 9 AND IM SCREAMING NOOOOOOO BUT HE DOESNT HESITATE AND PROCEEDS TO SMASH IT OVER MY HEAD AND WHILE IM DYING OF BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA THEY TBAG AND RUN INTO A JUNGLE GYM
---
One question , can the person buy it or you win from a event
---
They just made it easier for nurse mains. Now instead of having to equip two addons for omegablink you just need one and you can add an extra blink for maximum fun.
---
Fair and balanced.
---
What? So u don’t get many nurse? That’s so lucky dood
---
Yeah out if everything here his power seems the weakest, as in incredibly weak. That and his perks just sound boring.
---
R u not on pc?
---
Not with nurses lmao.
---
My pc is a potato anyways, and I can't afford to get a good one haha
---
follow this handy flowchart
---
https://i.imgur.com/Oga1vvT.png
---
Typical nurse n spirit mains
---
I just looked through the DBD logs (since MLGA wasn't working) and noticed that the connections are no longer directly to a STEAM\_ID and are now to an IP and also have a new flag "UseDedicatedServer," so I think this problem will no longer be a concern from now on.
---
that horrible moment when you hit red ranks on console and stumble upon a PC nurse main packing prestige 3 attire
---
Just admit you're wrong, or were wrong, lmao.
---
The fact remains that the feature is available to developers and that there are developers already using it.
---

I've stared at him dead center before. It NEVER works

Wut abt sally
---
I hope you're joking because if you're not not that means that you are a gen rusher, the only reason to be angry at NOED is if genrush which is shitty and unfair way to play the game , which usually means you aren't good enough to win so you use it as an underhanded way of unfairly winning, here i go into -karma again also imagine downvoting someone saying ds is toxic and not someone who says ds is toxic, this is some backwards ass bullshit guys
---
Dead By Daylight is a competitive game in the sense that it has two teams of players competing against each other, but it’s not competitive in the same sense that R6 or CS:GO are competitive
---
I can appreciate you wanting to take the game really seriously and constantly getting better at it, but the last time we had a competitive-style DBD tournament, it failed pretty badly. The skill cap for the game can be pretty high, but the game has too many imbalances (on both sides) for it to really be considered as a fully competitive game
---
I literally screamed in horror. That man was a baby Billy that my swf team pretty much bullied all game. And then that happened...they kept asking me what happened as I literally cried hysterically and all I could say was:
---
“He learned.....” lol
---
You can't generalize and stereotype killers really.

Tier 3 tombstone with tuft of hair should just be a command block with /kill others

Had a match like this and ez bp
---
I swear whenever I play Freddy they either drop it early or they find every single real pallet first
---
It wouldn't be OP. The trapper is basically an m1 killer. If you get caught in a trap it's 100% the survivor's fault for doing so. He still would be pretty week even with this new feature considering all the time it takes to set up all these traps.
---
Wait what is that idk what it is! D:
---
I never said that it wasnt available for dev, i said that sony hasnt confirmed anything. But whatever i dont care anymore, if you just want to satify your ego good on you.
---
I just realized Killer Mains downvote anything related to BALANCING THE GAME.
---
Yeah, nurse is too weak, currently the worst killer in the game by far. She should have unlimited blinks and unlimited range and maybe she’d be balanced.
---
This one time I had 4 blendettes join at the same time , I took doc with his iridescent and the purple shock addon ,one which increases 20 % more madness from staying at in my shock area , best game I had
---
That's good to hear. What GPU and CPU ya got? I'm rocking a gtx 970 and i7 6700.
---
Double this for failing Ruin checks
---
Pro tip: when you notice the killer’s using Ruin, split up. Not only does this spread the progress so you don’t get hurt as badly when the killer comes by to interrupt you, but this also means that a failed Ruin check will only pause the repair progress of one player, rather than all two/three players at the same time
---
Thank you! ♡ I also did Wraith, check my podt history if you're interested c: Trapper is on the fourth with Spirit &amp; Doc somewhere later into the month!
---
Oh god I hate teammates who heal against legion with sloppy n thana ugh
---
Nice shadows!
---
You have achieved argument
---
He was nodding to say “No no silly survivor. When i come, you stand. No pallet looping, or running away”
---
His mask is pretty accurate lmao, no need to change it. It looks like the mask from the first Halloween
---
I honestly wish I can play nurse but I get HEAVILY motion sick from her blink :(
---
I'll go ahead and press F to pay respects from the PC. That sounds rough.
---
**NERF THE PIG**
---
Hindered is definitely not that weak. Kinda wish Pig's RBTs baseline cause hindered status. Would buy a little extra time and make having one a major liability since you would be chase fodder.
---
Not a rework just some tweaks
---
It looks like the base skin, just someone left it in the oven for too long.

Because it's fun messing around with other survivors and looping killers and need I mention having clutch moments like your whole team dying and barely escaping, all that combined with the sweet cosmetics they get makes it worth it for me.
---
**im fuckingn SHAKING RN**
---
Can't this this argument here man. Sub is mostly killer mains. And thats facts.
---
Killer: You aight, dont come near my totem
---
It’s not a BAD thing, if you’re good at the game and facing an obviously bad Killer, just do your Gens and go. No sense bullying them for an additional 15-20 mins
---
Aight
---
lmao what a cutie tho
---
Freddy's lunge is the same range as everyone else's except for T3 Myers which is the longest lunge
---
*you can never outfox the fox!*
---
We can't stop, it's like an abusive relationship.
---
Just perspective my guy he’s a killer that is as small as the hag but the movement speed of a normal killer really throws off distance judgement
---
Never have i hated and loved a game as much as dbd... Its like that girl you were with for a while, it went really good for a long time, then you had a bad break up. Then one night you get shitfaced and call her and tell her you want her back and she is shitfaced to so you get back together...
---
That doesnt mean it isnt a 50/50 chance that the ID assigned is the closest box.
---
Even if it does eventually happen (which I doubt) I wouldn't take this as any hint, a lot of conventions just have stuff like this on their badges, it isn't specifically for BHVR or anything.
---
NO BIGGIE. STRANGER THINGS CONTENT + 2X BPS = CAMPING KILLERS AND HANGING ON THE HOOK TIL YOURE DEAD FIVE SECS IN WATCHING EVERYONE OPEN CHESTS AND CLEANSING EMPTY TOTEMS. I DROPPED 8 RANKS IN THREE DAYS. NOT THAT I GIVE A SHIT BUT DOUBLE THE POINTS STILL WASNT WHAT I GET FROM A NORMAL MATCH.
---
Nah, I'd be upset if he was the killer, I want him as the survivor lol
---
Could be Alpha or Beta as the killer
---
He would make a much better killer though. With the baseball bat and his whistling. His mori could be him making everyone look like Glenn.
---
 New killer: creeper 
---
Power: self destruct 
---
Instantly kill anyone in your 8m terror radius, if 1 person dies you instantly win +100k bp
---
Yeah I dident mean that it was “bad” per se but it’s not what it used to be, sorry I dident mean to sound to negative to the perk, (I still use it) lol
---
Sometimes it's more fun to run killers than it is to chase Surviviors. Sure it sucks to get Tunnelled and camped but that's what Decisive strike and Borrowed time are for. 
---
Wait...killers want Decisive nerfed again? Okay well shit nvm Decisive is about to get gutted but we'll still have borrowed....wait they want that nerfed too? 
---
Fuck.
---
Plague is my absolute favorite killer to play as. I have Infectious Fright, Bitter Murmur, Ruin, and BBQ. I dont have all the teachables for everyone but this build seems to work for me. Any suggestions on builds for her? I like to play around with stuff but this is kinda where I landed
---
The devs said they want to keep the game going for at least five more years lol
---
You must go against pretty terrible Clowns
---
Did you get to T3 and instadown them? If so you did it wrong you need to go to the survivors and get right up against them then you will be able to Mori them
---
That's probably the best way to describe this piece of shit game lmao
---
Nah, her hair is black in the skin. You can see it on the icons for her head piece in some leaks.
---
Ghostface Should. T1 Myers already has it. Pig should have the aura reveal of Amandas letter be base kit.
---
Enter a Halloween themed screenshot and if yours is voted the best at the end of the month you'll win a copy of the game for yourself or for a friend.
---
Should’ve done a claw instead of a cloud wtf
---
&gt;Just ran a game with it and it didn't work. It slowed down my tier progression tremendously but didn't let me kill a single survivor. Is it bugged or what?
---
You didn't use it correctly. You need to avoid hitting survivors. You practically hug them and then just tap M1 when the prompt appears.
---
i'm stuff
---
I don't see how we lost context on the trap discussion in regards to the hatch but that's fine.  
---
It's pretty obvious at this point we've both presented everything we basically can on the matter.  There really isn't any other way for me to explain my position.  I agree with the devs you don't.  That's pretty much the summary.
---
This is fantastic! If I can ever get this good, I wanna try that!
---
Survivors too powerful pls nerf
---
A buff, yes, a rework, no.
---
BEGONE THOT
---
&gt;But all those maps without open field spawns still have killer shack spawns and spawns next to gens. The issue extends well past what's in OP's image
---
Totems will never be fixed because they are always tied to certain props. Post rework Badham maps had totems that were nearly impossible to find at first, now they are just as easy because people started to memorize which props to look for. 
---
They did try to fix totems spawns by pushing them as much as they could inside these props and putting debris in front of them but then again, just look for the main prop and quickly look at the "hidden" totem location. 
---
The alternative to this method would be making it completely random but then totems could spawn right in the middle of nowhere.
---
They want instaheal removed too, don't forget about that lmao. InsTahEaL iS tOxiC.
---
I SWEAR I saw her skin with White hair. WTF???
---
s7e12
---
Shut up Hitler
---
What? I had to sacrifice a little cute kitten for my mask.
---
Should I be proud of my red ranks with Pig?
---
No such prompt appeared is the thing
---
Not emotional, just tired of survivors thinking they’re the shit for ‘outplaying’ a baby killer

Dark sense gang
---
I'm on PC, but yes lately it feels like there's a delay in action when you vault or drop a pallet and somehow the killer still hits you despite you CLEARLY being in the clear.
---
That’s be so cool bc I was a pig main before I picked up nurse so I still play her from time to time
---
Why do so many killers camp at hook or beat down a survivor and try to bait the whole match long? No fun
---
OMFG I love this!!!
---
I could go on and on about how wonderful this comic and the sentiment it contains are but I'll just leave it at that &lt;3 Thanks for this!
---
I rarely see any Hillbilly's and I'm rank 3. It's mostly GhostFace/Spirit and the occasional Myers/Pig/Clown
---
Toxic or not I have only one politic with the swf make them suffer
---
The old system was fucking broken. The new system isnt any better, but at least its not the old one. 
---
They should really just have matchmaking work off of an average
---
Nah, i have fun dunking on rank 15's 😂
---
Aaaah yes the survivors rulebook
---
I love this!! It’s wholesome and adorable :)
---
What platform?
---
That's painfully true
---
I see plenty of GhostFaces and I'm on PC, it's probably dependant on the region
---
How can you acknowledge that it's a separate team who works on designing cosmetics, and still have a problem with the servers? They're working on it, and like you've already acknowledged, it's two separate teams. They aren't delaying dedicated servers so they can push out cosmetics. Everyone has every right to be upset, but saying it's taking a backseat to paid DLC is kind of ignorant.
---
cutest shit ive ever seen
---
&gt;No such prompt appeared is the thing
---
You have to be really close to them during EW3 to see the "kill" prompt. Watch some videos on youtube, maybe you'll see what you did wrong.
---
If the player base is large enough for what they're doing now, then it is, yes.
---
You'd basically just shift the starting line from the top player, to something far smarter, and then expand out from there.
---
At the same time, matchmaking itself could use a lot of work in terms of what ranks mean, but that's maybe a whole OTHER conversation, and I think again, the game is definitely big enough, and would have been/stayed bigger if it had a better ranking/matchmaking system this entire time.
---
A long time ago it made sense that the matchmaking system was kind of... just works level, but it's been a long time, and it's been reworked and edited time and time again, and they always go about it in the same way. I legit would love to be a fly on the wall in the room they come up with these choices, because it boggles my mind and has time and time again for many years now.
---
to clarify, it doesn't need to pick the absolute best match ever, it just need to A) do its best and B) make sense, and they've (to me) never tried to create a good system, for ranks themselves or for matchmaking.
---
Impressive that you can recall the exact number
---
*This looks like a job for me.*
---
Yeah, let's give bad Pig players all the more reason to tunnel trapped people by making them even easier to catch
---
Insta heal is pretty bullshit. You ever played against a swf with 4 Insta heals? I'm fine with the one that heals 1 health state but the ones that fully heal are bullshit when there are more than one.
---
I don't think so. But it's pretty dumb
---
Kinda good doesn't mean it's a top tier ir anything, it means it's a okay perk, it isn't bad
---
This is so cute, I love it!! I'm a survivor main and if I'm on my final hook and there's no chance of escape, I tend to goof around on the ground before the killer picks me up. There's nothing I love more than a killer who sees me doing that and joins in. If they end up giving me the hatch that's great but even just the fun of crawling around obstacles and playing 'hide and seek' with a killer is worth being hooked, tbh.
---
Unless it happens to spawn next to a surv, then it's basically gone...
---
It's also mandatory to run it, so killers really only have 3 perk slots they can change.
---
Ever play against Omegablink Nurse? 
---
Srsly there's enough bullshit for killers and Surviviors to fill a book. Constantly complaining about one side and one side only is asinine.
---
Same on PS4. It's been really bad tonight.
---
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be a downer, just realistic.  Nicholson was a higher tier star than any of them before he retired.  That's why I think it would be more difficult.
---
Go double pip Billy all the way to rank one then. 
---
Once u hit 8, aka ur not a trashcan, people dont just let u saw them
---
Camping and slugging is not bannable
---
Time to switch targets!
---
“Bullying”, lol. 
---
I’ll get downvoted, but I don’t think the community is that bad nor do I think it’s effecting the game’s quality. The teabagging, camping, tunneling, nodding, the shit talking, and all the other nonsense doesn’t really bother me. The people insisting that every little tiny thing is “s0 t0x1c” is more annoying than any of that, but those conversations exist more on the internet than in the game itself - so the game is fine.
---
Wraiths cloak doesn't slow him down. Pig crouch does.
---
Wait are u the dnd dude with boblin or whatever lol
---
I want that skin
---
No, but a noob strategy for sure.
---
This is supreme pure, I now know why so much of the community dedicates itself to being pure ass. It's because all the wholesome that has ever been has been slowly collecting itself together to create this one post. I am literally shaking and crying right now.
---
No it's not but I think that's something that really wont work unless your facing new survivors so I wouldnt honestly bother doing it
---
I'm on PC, play maybe 15 hours a week or so nowadays. Obviously my experience is pretty unrepresentative of what others may get.
---
Eh? It'll just take some getting used to. A good Nurse on console is super rare. If we get crossplay, we'll learn. And if we don't, well we'll just derank lol.
---
I'm on ps4 and that's what it's doing to me right now q
---
swf idiots using smurf rank 20 accounts to get easier games
---
everybody knew this
---
You probably saw the video by NecroCrafts but missed the disclaimer at the beginning saying they were having trouble rendering her hair and it wouldn’t look like that in game
---
Bing Bong Bois too :D
---
Mending timer starts when you are out of the terror radius. When you are hit you go into dreamworld where there is no terror radius and so the timer goes down while freddy is chasing you. All freddy has to do is follow you until you go into dieing state from not mending or hit you as soon as you try and mend. Freddy is a hard counter to borrowed time. So there is no benifit of being awake with borrowed time vs Freddy.
---
I love the Jake Park in the background that's just like, "Welp, see ya later folks."
---
And Frank’s in it because he wants everyone to hear his mixtape
---
Please no.
---
" Worst in existence" eh
---
But overwatch actively breeds it with their dev team
---
When frank is high
---
have you tried just doing a gen instead of wasting time hunting for the totem?
---
I mean it's more often than it should be that survivors spawn right on top of it or totem spawns are in ridiculous locations, but other than that no complaints to be made.
---
Why trapper? I'm not disagreeing just want to know your thoughts?
---
Seems pretty shit but honestly, that's a pretty easy totem to defend. 0 safety near it.
---
I play the spirit and admire this killer in his bro nature
---
His power is slow as hell he has to wastr time collecting and setting up traps which is Not Good At All
---
In one match I found this afk Hillbilly after I did 1 gen. I just ran in circles around him farming chase points while the others were doing the gens. When they were finally finished, he came back, hit me with noed and facecamped my ass lol
---
Christ. Given your name you're a really lost cause. Watch some high level killers like Tru3Talent and maybe you'd get the idea.
---
You simply cannot go for slow healing progression overall against great survivors, cause they'll have dead hard in place of self care, which again is still effectively 2 hits to down unless the survivor fucks up, not you doing well, learn the difference.
---
Thana is a mix between healing and gen slow down, additional seconds on gens is all you really need with Thana, the healing part is nice but it's mainly the Gen Part.
---
FYI, 8% Surge regression is an extra 6.4 seconds to do a generator. 1 Stack of Thana (4%) is 3.2 seconds, the moment 2 are injured Thana is better than Surge because it also does healing and is constant. 3 Stacks and it is consistently better than Surge. 
---
You should rarely be hitting the same gen(s) with Surge anyway, so Surge's usefullness is 32 metres on different gens, whereas Thana is map wide and all the time.
---
dios mio
---
Ty
---
the point of having ranks is the matchmaking system consider them
---
if u play siege and your a diamond u will have to wait few min to find a game,and you are talking of a game which having millions of players
---
if u cant find a game soon disc few time go to rank 15 and having games sooner
---
I mean im a trapper main and I feel he is fine as is. You're gonna have to give up at least 3 gens but if you have good traps near a place you can 3 gen he's A tier. Combine that with some gen slower perks(PGTW, Ruin, Corrupt, etc.) and youre gonna win many games
---
This is so fucking adorable. It brings back memories of my first time being dropped by the hatch 😭
---
That girl is me.
---
Literally who are you?
---
I maon dwight, as a new player, i love him. HO NOMO
---
Idk, her making everyone not have one health for the entire game sounds like Permanent tier 3 Myers to me.
---
Well that sucks and I hate it.
---
Dude I would love to get a demogorgon looking mech
---
i had a huntress like this last night. I am incredibad at flashlights, so i ended up blinding them like twice because i wanted to practice... I felt so bad about it but i wanted to learn lol
---
dont buy him
---
I'm PC personally, so typically Demo's are more powerful (easier to aim with a Mouse) and movement is more distinct with the arrow keys. 
---
Note I didn't say precise, because console you can make ultra tiny movements and be very precise, PC you really can't. That's the main reason tons of games have a "Walk" and "Run" option, so PC can be more precise when they need to be.
---
Head On, Inner Strength, Decisive strike, and Quick and Quiet. :)
---
It must be a trap to lower your guard
---
Lol.
---
Nah it just beat describes her and feels good to say.
---
Legion does the buff. I am getting sick of missing and getting punished for using my power (4 second stuns!) &gt;:(
---
As a survivor, it is pretty easy for me to survive Legions if they are not pro M1 killers, Spine Chill + Sprint Burst+ Jungle Gym or one infinite loop guarantees easy escape. I only remember going against one good Legion, but that's it. Other times I died to Legion, someone suicided or disconnected on hook :(
---
Fix it.
---
Survivor main who plays both sides a good amount
---
A good survivor can make the game hellish for Killers. Unless the killer is nurse or spirit with a decent set of addons (which are semi-rare and burned on use), killer is at a disadvantage.
---
Try Killer, but try it at the rank that you're at as Survivor. Sure, you can probably 4k bad players, but a monkey drunk off mikes hard could 4k rank 16-20s
---
I don't think honing stone should be normal.  But 12% is way too high considering how quickly you can attempt to escape
---
He can break pallets by default now as others stated but its honestly so easy to counter just run loops tight and don't throw pallets early
---
Oh no lmao you were a killer and she kept looping u and you were S̳a̳l̳t̳y̳
---
This is the best meme I saw here
---
Definitely Myers. Once you get down a habit of how you like to play with him, its alot of fun! I have freddy too and just dont have as much fun playing with him.
---
Or your friends can have some patience and just actually improve like we all had to do.
---
Nerf it
---
I played a Huntress game where two survivors DC'd. I just let them do gens and occasionally kick gens and smack them. Felt like that was the right thing to do.
---
I took a down to save a team mate once who would have died on hook on the last gen, and they all ditched me when the gate opened and just left even though the killer went to the wrong gate and all 3 were together. For some reason that moment made me show a lot more mercy as a killer, knowing that sometimes survivors can have bad games even when “winning”
---
happy cake day
---
I’M RANK FUCKING 10
---
WHY DO I KEEP GETTING 4 MAN RED RANK SWFS?
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT
---
Haha, original
---
This might possibly be the most wholesome "No u".
---
&gt; stuck until someone came to get you or the killer picks you up.
---
Imagine getting punished for making a mistake.  Holy shit that'd be OP
---
I haven't play against Billy in ages, I actually miss him... It's only Spirits, Nurses and Huntresses in EU...
---
This is true
---
Link? I don’t play Killer unless I’m doing Daily Quests or need some bbq stacks,  and frequently have issues with it as well. Don’t even claim to be a good killer. I’ve only even been good with pre rework Freddy and that’s because I dedicated myself to him to get good with him. 
---
But ok dude.
---
It would be too terrifying for the world to handle.
---
ME AND MY FRIEND ARE PURPLE AND WE PLAYED WITH 2 RED RANKS VS PLAGUE AND IT WAS THE BRAINIAC RED PLAYERS THAT CLEANSED VS HER WITH 3 GENS LEFT. THEY WERE SURPRISED WE LOST. AREN'T YOU HIGH RANK PLAYERS SUPPOSED TO KNOW?!?
---
What's worse, destroying a pallet and gettig blinded by p3 claudete
---
i thought so too until I noticed all his teammates were already dead.
---
YOU! You draw the DnD comics! I love your art. Glad to see you in another sub!
---
But lower ranks Spirits are the easiest thing to juke, they are confusion all the time.
---
Also I was rank 5 earlier today.
---
Well his deliverance was lit up so would have been able to do it
---
https://youtu.be/Agdz_lOtH1M
---
Idk what that means! D:
---
Same unless I’m using bbq and I want my stacks
---
Imagine being able to outrun the survivor with the exposed status and still complaining.
---
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe last one alive doesn't even get to go through struggle phase anymore even if it's first hook.
---
You can be looped so... no.  He’d be op in so far as bubba is op with PWYF (he’s not)
---
But then theres the fact it was only killed by a psychokinetic teenager. It's also from a differebt realm.
---
There is a cake beside your username, which means that today’s date marks the creation of your reddit account. Kinda like your Reddit accounts birthday
---
Does rank above mean 20 or 1?
---
Love the art style. Reminds me of the old Newgrounds days.
---
I’m actually not sure. I could have sworn I saw a video of someone using deliverance as the last one in the match.
---
Holy shit why can’t all prestige 3 look like this
---
Tbh chests were kinda thrown in at the last minute, could 100% use some work.
---
as for pallet's, im considering turning it into a slower palette vault, turning safe palettes into unsafe palettes.
---
The generators are a little harder, I was thinking of making the regression much faster then a normal regression, but then that could easily devolve into a three gen god situation.
---
Great job Father of Boblin &lt;3
---
Thats not how cross play would even work the console side would be the ones opting in and out not pc.
---
So let's say I'm talking about DBD with my friends, and they buy the game.
---
I turn to them and say 'You can't play with me until you reach rank 5, have fun!'
---
Do you think they will do it? I know that the only reason I got into DBD was because I played with my friends. If I had nobody to play with I would never have stuck around.
---
Lol my psn name is not Bloodrayne
---
My psn name is iiDeuu and was previously iiMomo. I can see why you would think so, my voice is similar in this clip. But I assure you that’s not me. My Wraith is only P1, and in that clip the girl’s Wraith is at least P2.
---
Survivors only the advantage when all of them know what they're doing which in reality is very rarely the case.
---
Survivors are only as strong as the weakest member of their team.
---
there is some random backlore where the entity removed the ability to speak from survivors. that's why ingame they can only gesture.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
no idea why they broke it, but that was the original reasoning behind no voice coms, and no other communication.
---
All seeing eyes x bbq and chilli x iron maiden = happy killer
---
Haha devs pls. :p
---
Definitely put on decisive if you have it in case the killer comes back, I'd say dead hard as well
---
Not bannable, but not very useful either, just hook and get back to patrolling gens if you don’t wanna get gen rushed back to Rank 20
---
you saw a render without the proper texture loaded

First u will never catch a decent survivor in a bad position as Billy cause you hear terror radius you run to your loop while Freddy can fake teleport as I said and survs don’t know if he is actually gonna teleport or is just delaying the gen, as I said my opinion is with no addons but if u want to go with them then, fake pallets amazing tons of free hits since good survs are gonna get greedy with loops, slow forces pallets if you spam 2-3 at a loop that’s not the best use but it’s something better than trying to chainsaw preventing at a pallet and give another loop to the survivor, also Billy gets loop cause he is a normal killer, he can’t do anything about loops he is like a Ghostface who has to charge his M1 in that aspect. As final point Freddy has way more versatility on addons, he can slow like Thana, he can push everyone away from gens(I actually don’t like this addon but it works, he has a lullaby in close maps that’s always terrifying. You have any point apart from the insta down which you will never get if there is a window near?

When i mean rank about i mean like 15,16,17,18,19,20

I am very concerned that they're making Plaid Flannel Common rarity. Don't get me wrong it's a baby training addon, but it's an incredibly potent baby training addon. The literal only reason Plaid Flannel isn't used is because it's Ultra Rare. I understand that the rest of Nurse's addons are being reworked and I imagine her base kit will be nerfed to compensate but I am very afraid of giving "the Killer who doesn't need addons" the "massive crutch that makes the character brain-dead easy to play with no downside" addon basically for free.
---
Color rank vs same color rank? Or if swf average it?
---
Ah, thank you for the clearification! fair enough, She just seems nice, I dunno
---
Well tbh I am NOT wanting to be matched with console shitters when I play survivor. No thanks.
---
It must have just been this clip. Oh my god I hope I don’t sound that that girl. Also Jesus she’s angry...I rage but hell at least I get mad about legit bullshit. 
---
“REEEEE THEY SAVED HER AND LET HER ESCAPE!”
---
Im pretty sure we had a post yesterday about how killer isnt fun to play anymore. Do they cancel out or...
---
Remember kids, DC’ing because you don’t like a killers add-ons makes you a bitch
---
We cannonballing ourselves through windows from 8 feet out now?  Dude you were no where near that window when you attempted to vault.  You got a bit trigger happy on that play.
---
CAN YOU STOP TEA BAGGING AND JUST LEAVE PLEASE? I'M JUST TRYING TO FINISH SOME DAILIES AND I KNOW I'M TRASH
---
I don’t have to deal with the PC Nurses (PS4 here), so I’d say generally Spirits give me problems more than Nurses. But playing great Nurses goes a lot worse than playing great Spirits, IMO. 
---
Nurses have the higher ceiling but also higher curve, in my experience.
---
DS,Head on maybe as it combos with DS, Adrenaline maybe but that's a little reliant on when generators pop, borrowed time obviously to secure a safe unhook. I'm just throwing perk suggestions really I don't use deliverance so idk
---
I’m sorry but did you just post something positive and wholesome on this sub? 😤😤😤
---
I’m 3 hrs late but yeah I’ve got to say this game is ALOT more toxic than Ds3 pvp. I was here since the beginning when Myers dropped and got back recently after watching a couple Ds3 PvP channels were playing this game. Convinced I bought the stranger things dlc, ghostface, and piggy Queen. After around 7-9 weeks I remember why I left 3 yrs ago. This game is super toxic from chat to dc to just overall gaming experience. I just got out of a game trying to level my trapper to get brutal strength and I got bombarded by a Feng because I “tunneled” at rank 11 on ‘the game’ map. I only had 2 perks (brutal and enduring) and the survivors had DS, adrenaline, DH you name it. It makes me sad because games are supposed to be casual and a past time imo and the toxicity ruins this game not the “tunneling.” 
---
Although R6 siege is FAR more saltier than this game. Between this game and that...I’d stay here
---
If we're doing nude skins, Clown needs to **come** first
---
Ya what r u gonna do about it, mori me?
---
GOD IT FEELS SO FUCKING GOOD TO TAKE DOWN A SQUAD OF TOXIC NEAS AND CLAUDETTES ALL WITH FLASHLIGHTS! YOU FUCKS THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BULLY ME, WHEN IN FACT YOU ALL GOT STEAMROLLED!!
---
 MY TRAPPER HAS SHIT PERKS, BECAUSE I JUST NEEDED TO GET MY DAILY WITH CATCHING YOU IN BEAR TRAPS AND NEVER REALLY USE HIM! 
---
THE SALT IS WONDERFUL! SO AGAIN FUCK YOU GUYS I WIN! 
---
PS: THANKS FOR THE BLOOD POINTS!!!
---
HOLY SHIT DEDICATED SERVERS ARE **FUCKING [TERRIBLE.](/intensifies)** I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN MOTION SICK PLAYING A GAME BEFORE BUT PLAYING LEGION FOR A DAILY I ACTUALLY WANTED TO FUCKING PUKE. I HAVE PLAYED ON TF2 SERVERS IN ALASKA WITH LESS STUTTERING AND JITTERING THAN THAT. IT GOT TO THE POINT THAT I THOUGHT I WAS PLAYING HUNTRESS SINCE THE ONLY PEOPLE I COULD RELIABLY HIT WITH MY KNIFE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE MILES AHEAD OF ME ON MY SCREEN.

GOD I FEEL SORRY FOR SWITCH USERS IF THEY'RE STUCK WITH THIS CRAP.

I’ll contribute an upvote to help battle the wave of downvotes you’re about to eat
---
stand in it and around the two minute mark u get abducted by aliens. its a easter egg for stranger things
---
Did any survivors bring a map? Maps have a add-on allowing them to mark locations with a light
---
The White Hair looked AWESOME though :(
---
Dude, me too =/ 
---
Best I got is the screenshot of postgame chat.
---
Git gud and figure it out you fucking scub lmfao. Wow
---
I would take this or the old man Myers Mask!
---
My best guess is someone was using a Map with the Glass Bead add on. It is used to show other players where they are or something about the place the market is put down.
---
BT, DS, Deliverance, your choice
---
As a Bing Bong Boi main I back this up. It's easier to signal to people we are cool by just ringing bell and not cloaking or something.
---
use decisive with deliverance your pretty much asking for suicide without it
---
That’s weird, my friend was playing killer 4 or so hours ago and he was in queue for like 10 minutes.
---
Everything seems good but i want to focus on Nurse. So i'm glad that you aren't altering her base power because that would be a terrible idea. First off the changes so far seems good. I have no clue why plaid flannel was a very rare addon in the first place so that change is nice and the recall idea is interesting but i'm not sure how it'll play out in game. Heavy panting seems fine. The biggest issue with nurse is when she can have more than 2 blinks and omega blink. After those get changed her other addons just need to be better cause most of them suck and accuracy literally means nothing. Also some ultra rare addons would be cool. I'm personally a fan of the ultra rares that change the fundamentals of the power itself like waterlogged shoe for hag or something similar.
---
Hahah no no. Sometimes killers take it easy on baby survivors. Sometimes if you’re the last survivor and the killer finds you , if you emote towards them or don’t wiggle if they down you they might let you escape. You won’t get banned for it, sometimes killers will just let a survivor escape
---
Idk but I wouldn’t worry if I was you. I think it is pretty common for killers to feel bad for survivors with shit teams
---
WAIT BUT WHY? WHAT BUILD DO YOU USE THAT PERK IN? I FEEL LIKE SLOPPY IS ALMOST ALWAYS BETTER.
---
Guys how do you play nurse well? I can't seem to figure out how to blink effectivvely, does it have something to do with me playing on PS4, can i get some tips please?
---
Rofl, this post.
---
It's more so a bannable offense for the killer i think but even that wouldn't get him banned I believe, the only bannable offensives are being toxic with racial slurs etc hacking targeting people all that basic stuff
---
Me too it’s so frustrating this new patch makes my game so buggy
---
Pretty much.
---
If the killer didn't kill you when he had the option to I would imagine it would just be a bannable offense to the killer. But honestly BHVR doesn't do shit for anything less than cheating. DCs result in no punishment, people farm with killers all the time, and I've been called some very racist and hateful things on this game without any consequences coming to those who do it so you have nothing to worry about
---
I met someone that used deadhard just for the speedboost.  
---
I was baffled.
---
No mither, second wind, inner strength, and self care.
---
OP build imo
---
She is viable not broken, yes omega blink and 5 blink is a bit much but beyond that she's really the only killer that doesn't need add ons to do well at any rank, no other killer can really do that, every killer should be able to do well at higher ranks and feel powerful, besides spirit, Billy and Nurse, no other killer really does well in the higher ranks
---
I think you'd benefit from looking at this webpage: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/joke
---
You should listen to your own username lol
---
&gt;Keep being shit and being hardstuck purple. I'd say I'll see you in game but you're far too low ranked to ever be matched against me on either side lmfao. Like I said, go watch a fungoose stream and you'll quickly (or maybe not, seems you have double digit forest gump IQ) understand how terrible you are.
---
-Comment from an asshole on Reddit which me and my friends have turned into a copypasta inside-joke
---
Averaging it gives killers unfun games because of 1 or 2 good survivors. You could say that's ruining your experience going against good killers but you chose to play with a purple rank. Killers don't get to chose the ranks they play with.
---
this made my heart sad :(
---
Instead of Jeff, How about Legion is actually all of the survivors? His character model rotates through all of them (randomly) with certain giveaways as to who the killer really is?
---
I'm just asking for some help. No need for the hostility.
---
Honestly I bounce between low red and high purple and I'm quite surprised how few Billies I've played against. Spirits up the ass yes but not a lot of Billies, and honestly very few Nurses too.
---
I've only seen this once before. someone got hit and they were running at insane speeds, they tried to vault to fix it and they just went twice as fast.
---
Are you on nintendo switch? If not, dedicated servers aren't even in right now.

O yeah your right lol im dumb

"fucking laggy and delayed" doesnt help them, smart ass. Did daddy shove an extra stick up your ass today?

Time to float needs to be changed as with three stacks it would be nearly impossible to win a chase

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IM DYING HERE
---
Hit greats
---
How else as a killer would I be joining a lobby already filled with survivors if they needed to be connecting to me first :P Js
---
Its taking me forever to derank lol. Every DC is only 1 depip... Its funner to just fuck around with my friends and get locker saves. I had a friend get downed in front of me, he used decisive and then I locker stunned the killer with Janes perk lol. Thats like 10 seconds of pure stun time.
---
I laughed hysterically at this entire comment, *especially* at balding Myers.
---
I wanna get it, but Android.
---
Okay, so you make D&amp;D content and DbD content. Any other DsomethingD content I should be aware of?
---
It is against the rules to "promote" cheating and exploits on this sub.
---
I just would like to play with my good friend thats rank one and not die in the first five minutes or so with 4k bp. 
---
As killer the matchmaking seems consistent against solo players (occasional red rank but that's no issue) survivor side if you have one red rank friend  you're kinda screwed.
---
For Survivors I would say DS and for killer I would say Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
RIP Paragon
---
Oh see youre one of the ones im talking about, definitely green rank at best
---
Ummm...It lets them know the controls are delayed, which makes the game unfun. Anyways, I can tell you're really salty for absolutely no reason at all, so I'm done with this conversation.
---
Where are you located? I played 5 matches today and didn't have a single issue with any of them and the ping was 30-40 each time. I'm in NA.
---
GOT INTO A GAME WITHIN LAST 2 MIN OF 2X BLOODHUNT AND THE KILLER BURNS A FKING EBONY MORI. CAN'T U WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE EVENT?
---
Idk man. Looks like swf lobby before you load into a game. Especially since you cant see player levels or ranks above their name. Fishy
---
Which is weird as it's fine on the switch, except Huntress her hatchet throws are beyond broken.
---
Me? Salty? You're the stupid fuck yelling at the developers and calling it feedback😂😂 the dbd  community is so braindead it blows my mind.
---
Yeah unhooking yourself as in the first phase of the hook and you get the rare chance. I wanted to be 100% sure it worked with Deliverance before I buy the char
---
wait until you get tunneled and see how much it tilts you to not have DS.  you may not care that much. for me it is rage quit inducing, it's one of my must have perks
---
Dedicateds are being tested.
---
Me too.
---
I never knew this community could be this wholesome.
---
I GOT MATCHED AGAINST THE MOST RACIST PIECES OF HUMAN TRASH AND THE FACT THEY'RE STILL PLAYING THE GAME A WEEK LATER PISSES ME OFF MORE THAN IT SHOULD
---
Next killer confirmed: Boblin the Goblin
---
I love Dwight. When I play killer, it makes me a bit sad to hook em ;v;
---
That's a pretty good build. Thanks!
---
&gt; seems they aren't removing Range addons
---
Looks like they're being changed to longer charges though which will make them a lot less useful in chases
---
I'm not sure what you mean by "correct way" or why you downvoted a fact.
---
You always get 3 hooks, it has nothing to do with who is alive and who is dead. You are your own person.
---
Maybe you miscounted, or maybe it was a bug. But in 100% of games I've played (825 hours) nobody has been insta-killed being hooked as last survivor. I've had tons of survivors pull themselves off all by themselves.
---
I've had it since it went free on ps+ and I'm not entirely sure on the time frame, if I had to guess I'd say around the time legion was introduced maybe???? But it definitely was a thing for a while after ps+ because I distinctly remember facing a pig and being the last alive and I managed to unhook myself but she downed me right away and killed me anyway. I also remember a friend I made through dbd would always stay on the hook as long as possible as the last person because he was very spiteful and did it with the intent to waste the killers time (probably why they changed it)
---
Steve from mc has a beard
---
There's nowhere near enough demand for a creepypasta killer to ever come to dbd. But, if we're talking creepypastas I'd prefer something like the rake, rather than the poorly written edgey burned boi.
---
Jeff the killer is like every creepypasta lovers first crush. You think there's something there but later on you realize there wasn't much there to begin with.
---
Neat
---
When I play killer and a survivor tries to make me chase a survivor thats doing a gen I just ignore them and continue chasing
---
A single skilled one? Not too much of an issue in my opinion as a killer. I can deal with one really good survivor as long as the others are averaged to my skill level. I wouldn't call it "forcing" considering me and the other two less skilled players are now "forced" to play red ranks. But yes, I would prefer to play against averaged killers as survivor/ having a single red rank to kill as killer I wouldn't mind either.
---
To be fair, Totems are getting much harder to find, Disturbed ward has always been the worst for this and that spawn is pretty unlucky.
---
&gt; Plaid Flannel change encourages more players to master the Nurse.
---
I don't understand why this was ever a purple tbh. It wasn't strong. It helps players who suck understand her a bit more. Hopefully it being a common means people will feel like they can actually use those addons and get a grasp of how to play her

I absolutely love New Nightmare
---
I've had a few wonky things happen but no disconnects like that.
---
I was in a SWF with "A Wholesome Gamer" but the other two were random.
---
I understand your intentions but are you actually considering your own advice? Like, do you really have friends who be ok with not playing with you until they spent weeks and/or months of trying to get to red ranks like you (brand spanking new player fyi) after convincing them to buy the game? Because if you are at red ranks then you know, you KNOW, taking a brand new rank 20 survivor into a rank 1 nurse/billy/spirit/huntress game is on the same level discrepancy of taking a bronze league of legends player against a challenger player. That new player is going to have an extremely, EXTREMELY unfun game, regardless of being able to play with their friend. This game isn't competitive in the slightest. It is very much considered a "party game", hence why most players play SWF, hence again why they have absolutely stated they will never remove SWF because it would completely kill this game. Absolute death sentence for this game.
---
So with that in mind, why do you think most survivors hate being at red ranks? Is it because they cannot bully the killer as much? Sure, that's what this subreddit full of the "reddit killers" streamers make fun of so much want you to believe (the absolute joke type killers running ruin and sloppy slugging for 4k's and waiting out DS, tunneling off hooks, etc. you know "fun" killers). The real fact is red rank killers take this game way too damn seriously to the point the game becomes boring and unfun. Nothing to do with "winning" or "bullying", but purely the fact the non-red rank killers tend to not play "4k or no k" type game play.
---
Bringing a rank 20 survivor against a red rank killer isn't simply a "oh its going to be a little rough for you, but you should still have fun since we have comms!" No...its very much a "yea...you won't ever want to play this game again huh? Nope, let's play Apex instead."
---
I don't like the old system where red ranks were facing rank 15's but the other guy is correct. A red rank against a rank 10 while your friend is rank 15 is balanced. Your rank 15 will have your version of "rough time" but still may enjoy the game. The killer should still be competent enough to down the red rank eventually. A red rank isn't going to 5 gen a rank 10 killer, not to mention there are 3 other survivors the killer can focus.
---
This is coming from a survivor main that has done SWF sessions only two times since 2016 when this game was released.
---
I'm not gonna be Claudette
---
Because that is something good for the pig mains and nobody in Behaviour want something good for things related with the pig
---
Wot? How would this effect killer mains besides not knowing if it's a swf(still doesn't hurt the killer that much) hitboxes are mostly fine they're only iffy because of latency, hits through pallets and will still exist too. Nurse,Spirit and ebonies still exist meaning 4k will still happen

---
&gt; Every survivor should at least have the opportunity to try and fail at the exit gate once hatch is closed
---
Why? They had a chance to get the trap off their heads while the killer was attacking someone else, they still had a chance while the killer was looking for the hatch, they had a chance to do generators with their team,  they had a chance to get the hatch first,  why do they deserve that many chances at a free win.  It doesn't make sense to me,  for the most part closing the hatch already puts in a 50/50 that you go to the wrong gate and in that time the survivors opened the other gate. 
---
Why should a killers power be removed just for the purpose of giving survivors yet another second chance
---
I think i just had a Server match as killer. 
---
i Saw a ping meter for me(around \~150 and i am in Europe, i hope that won't be the case later or what's the point...) and after the match the chat closed and Host Disconnected but i hadn't done so. Good to know that the tests are already live and probably in good amounts.
---
we’ve literally been disconnected 3 times tonight. it’s seriously frustrating as hell. don’t even wanna play right now.
---
Aww, I love this.
---
i didn't even downvote u?
---
I can’t touch all the doll
---
Replace billy with huntress and yes
---
Pretty much. It's fucking ridiculous that all you need to do for Adept Survivor is hide in a locker until hatch spawns and then take the hatch, but as Killer you have to have a literally perfect match without any of the pretty much mandatory perks to play the game (Ruin, BBQ, and obviously all the Killer-specific "mandatory" perks like Monitor and Abuse on Myers, Brutal Strength on Clown, Pop Goes on Freddy, etc.)
---
This is soo cute
---
This is it. On paper/played to the best of their ability it's nurse. But accounting for the actual player base and results they get spirit is better.
---
I just got matched with a red rank swf and fed them my dick the whole game. I'm not worried about it.
---
I just don't know why a friend who is able to convince you to buy a game, isn't worth a few hours of you going on your own and leveling up. Maybe if this group plays literally everything together sure, but I would hope someone who recommends a game isn't doing it purely because the game is only fun if they all play together (a real party game like Mario Party or something is different. DBD is not that).
---
The thing is this game has always had a competitive nature, no matter how shit it can be. The subtitles even say "ranked matches" on both modes. Maybe just don't reccomend the game to friends who aren't competitive.
---
However, all that being said, I don't think this problem should be fixed with matchmaking. I think we just need ranked and unranked. Obviously que times will be a thing but when are they not?
---
But that probably won't happen anytime soon, if at all, so I say just know your friends when suggesting the game. Everything is not for everyone.
---
Ohhhhhh I’m interested!
---
Progressives love them young don't you know
---
Cloud-ette? That only works if you're Otz.
---
LOL its so true. They might as well not even have a rank system at all. Cause these lobbies are scattered with all lvls. Its a god damn rainbow.
---
I know you didn’t, I’m just giving my reason. I feel like a killer Negan (from Season 7-8) would do extremely well from a business standpoint. Not to mention it’s Jeffrey Dean freakin Morgan.
---
This was easily one of the best balancing BHVR has done in a long time.
---
Even if you play nurse you need to be able to predict and blink to where the survivor will be when his teammates warn him you're blinking toward his gen. Nurse is far from a guaranteed win. But sure, "viable."
---
Sorry that you think tho but I was there with my swf squad and I have no reason to sell someone out I was just being friendly with the killer and pointing at the killer himself, I think we misunderstood each other sorry again but i wasn’t really trying to get anything from that match just tried to have a bit fun
---
I approve
---
Dueling Dildos might be kinda fun
---
I used to hop in a locker, get pulled out, hit the ds, hop right back in then head on stun. Now when I do it i get pulled out before my head on activates doing the same exact thing.
---
It's rewind time!
---
Is this...wholesomeness? In my toxic gaming community?!
---
That’s the sequence I was getting at, sorry I worded it poorly. I’ll have to try it tonight, see if the timings off.
---
How
---
He's clearly a troll
---
LOL ... I know. I never buy anything that makes me stand out and only bought Nancy's DLC because her white shirt was giving me away. Regardless, I bet there are players that think the killer is cheating when they can see them easily.
---
*Well played*
---
PLEASE.
---
LET ME EAT *YOUR* ASS, SPIRIT
---
Hahahaha thats always a good feeling, what rank are you out of curiosity?
---
I’m not crying... you’re crying
---
&gt;it's a baby training addon
---
&gt;massive crutch that makes the character brain-dead easy
---
So which one is it?
---
The caretaker would be a great name
---
That's not true. A lot of rank 1 killers have success with other killers. Clown, Huntress, Ghost Face, Billy, all viable. It's just easy to get rank 1 if you master spirit or nurse.
---
[Only if this is playing in the background](https://youtu.be/ZTg6hg1miFg)
---
Definitely not the right place to discuss it, but what if as survivor when you shined a flashlight the camera went to first person?
---
The original three fit the og chase music great. Everyone after them deserves a different track or two. Especially by this guy Rob.
---
Ive dealt with 1 camper in the passed 2 months. Then again, my definition is someone who literally just sits there. People tend to get upset if the killer passes the hooked survivor.
---
Forget 30, anything less than 50 is almost eye rape for me. XD
---
Unfortunately, it's still an issue at red ranks too. I was surprised to see how many killers were doing it on PC. It's a combination of shitty play and taking out their frustrations from the SWF group that just destroyed them the match before.
---
I'm usually 5-6 but I've gone as low as 4. Appreciate the opinion, looks like I'm in the minority hah.
---
LIterally every killer plays with the same fucking perks. It's getting so old.
---
The game heats up my card like a mother fucker :/
---
A secondary objective that needs to be completed, a double layer to the exit gates, a 'stage 2' to the trial in a new area that has a insanely otherworldly experience... a buff to all killers not named spirit, billy, nurse, reworked maps, removal of infinite, 
---
Any of these will due.
---
Last trapper and me somehow became friends after he made the game a living hell lol it was random I love him
---
Spoken like a rank 7 survivor main.
---
Lol, thanks. It’s all good though, downvotes must reinforce my point that there are lots of people that are too sensitive.
---
This game is more stressful than dark souls and im not even exaggerating
---
cursed_unbreakable
---
Killers get a toxic swf squad, get mad, then I come with my swf potato team of friends playing for shit and giggles and get all the moris, tryhards and more. I wish reputation was a thing in this game, so you know what to expect from the start...
---
You know, they’ve done a pretty good job so far.
---
And then playing against an omega 3-blink nurse with an ebony because they think you’re a toxic 4 man
---
Yup! You also can't see who you're playing with if you yourself are offline. Not really a problem as killer but it can be a pain when you don't want friends bugging you :P
---
 I personally tend to dodge offline killers, but that's just me.
---
Now there’s a man I’d kiss on the lips
---
I'm not, and I'm sure there are others that aren't. At least 5% :3
---
I am a plague main and I have an anti looping build Bamboozle, Brutal Strength, Bbq&amp;C and Ruin to slow the game down.
---
My whole strategy is based on addons and getting all 4 infected. Once I achieve all 4 broken, game is pretty much over. You cant hide or run with my perks and if you cleanse boy do you gonna regret.
---
you spelled spoopy wrong.
---
Unless someone didn't load into the match, I never had an issue with one or more players disconnecting mid game. Outside of being fucked that is.
---
You're an idiot, there isnt a difference in skill level between platforms, only technical problems
---
Your "bit of fun" shouldnt come at the expense of others. You pointed to every survivor and proceeded to BM them to the hook. I cant see how this is anything other than you being toxic and working with the killer.
---
*LOUD GOBLIN REEING*
---
Thats a lot of tracking perks and no trapping perks.
---
Oh I don't know, maybe the fact that 99.99999% of killers I play against tunnel like crazy, camp hooks, and play like dicks?
---
You're the one not making sense bud. You dont CHOOSE what platform to matchmake with, you either play on your platform or others, there is no "I wanna play with xbox players" button.
---
Yup! Drew it this week!
---
So you think that console Killers can deal with the extra strong SWF on PC?
---
You think that that console Survivors can deal with the extra strong Nurse's on PC?
---
Big fucking no from me chief.
---
How so, friend?
---
HEAR ME OUT. I’M STARTING TO NOTICE A  PATTERN- IF WE COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING BEHAVIOR LIKES TO FUCK IT UP MORE. YOU WANT AN ENDGAME TIMER TO AVOID THE GAME BEING HELD HOSTAGE? OKAY. IT’S BUGGED AS FUCK. YOU WANT TO NOT HAVE TO RE-INVITE YOUR FRIENDS AFTER EVERY GAME? OKAY. NOW YOU HAVE TO REBOOT THE GAME AFTER EVERY OTHER MATCH.

THEY HATE US.

Tru3talent also used Thantaphobia and sloppy on Ghostface while calling it the "most optimal Ghostface build in red ranks" lol
---
It makes sense that you're fan of Tru3talent as you're extremely biased just like him. He's a good player, but he sticks to his guns harder than a hillbilly on the 4th of July.
---
Surge depletes the gen by 8% and gives you information that the gen is being worked on, there is a lot of scenarios where you down a survivor 32m from a gen and immediately hook the survivor because checking on the gen would a waste of valuable time. That is why Surge is better than Thanataphobia, it regresses the gen by 8% immediately and gives you information while Thanataphobia in the best case scenario it only gives 16% speed debuff and that's it. That being said, they are both niche perks and this entire argument is dumb. Lol
---
Why do you dodge offline killers?
---
You do know that tunneling etc. is not even reportable? The Devs said multiple times  no one gets banned for that.
---
And whats Camping hexes?
---
If they’re camping go do gens, the skill checks aren’t constant just goes very slow.
---
But now they're having a surplus of killers,  and not enough surviviors. Which is why wait times for killers are so long,  because everyone wants to play killer when the game is balanced towards them. Which I'm not saying we should be able to destroy every killer,  I love a challenge, but I think surviviors should get better averages at escaping than what they are now. Just won my first match of the night, so yay for that tho. Lol.
---
This is why people should ALWAYS post their platform, their internet connection and their location to help track this issue. On PC, I never have a problem finding matches as a survivor. In fact, it doesn't take me more than a minute or two worst case scenario. However on console, at lower ranks, it can definitely take a while.
---
The entity must be insanely desperate if he's gonna start snatching 14-year old burn victims.
---
It's not an unfair advantage if it's earnt. The killer downed you,  the killer kept a trap for end game,  the killer killed every one else, the killer found the hatch first. It's entirely on the opposite end where it's unfair for the developers to simply negate the advantage that the killer had earnt. They might as well disable nurses blinking or Billy's chainsaw, or put a big dead zone where traps can't be used near gates if that's how they're going cause that's exactly what they did to pig.
---
where did you get those?
---
Honestly those swf games can be extremly fun. Knowing its your friend and talking as things are happening in game can be a very enjoyable experiance. In actually real games where you dont know the other team and there are points on the line things get much more serious and annoying.
---
NANCY SUCKS, GORGON SUCKS AND SECOND WIND DOESN'T WORK SO I JUST WASTED 15 BUCKS.
---
When I get the first skill check and it's not red … I have to check to see if I'm still playing Dead by Daylight. 
---
However, the only killer that I have trouble playing against with a hex is the hag with phantasm. 
---
However don't report killers for camping as it's not a violation of their TOS for playing the game. It's shitty play for sure, but they aren't banning anyone for it.
---
the point is, it isn't fun. slugging isn't fun. trying to keep track of all that isn't fun. getting dstriked isn't fun.
---
I didn't? Other people use reddit too. I just don't want to argue about camping, such a tired topic. Hope your games go better.
---
If that was a genuine thing you could do, I feel like as a killer main, I'd know I always had a possible friend in that lobby.
---
i just went into Google images and looked up nurse and tracer png
---
they are being tested, today was the first live server test and honestly, it went quite well for me. I had two games where I had some slight hiccups, but aside from that, it worked beautifully.
---
No need to be a cunt.
---
time to be looped for 5 minutes straight ;-;
---
Well, I think that just changed my mind. Was gonna get my THICC BOI a new skin, but I suppose he's getting put on the back burner. lol
---
no...the info
---
I mean, killers werent usually winning from lag? I was playing all day as killer today, and it really didnt feel any different at all.
---
We're going to have to strongly agree to disagree because that absolutely sounds like entitlement to me.  Getting the 3K doesn't mean you deserve an uncontestable 4k.  And your final points are grossly exaggerated.  Comparing their using their abilities vs. simply having a trap on someone is a big stretch.
---
Imagine deadlight delight on either chainsaw killer, you have to look back to see if you're going to get hit but then you'd just get stunned and getting downed anyways
---
Crowley is the killer.
---
Also Miachel or Legion
---
Seemed like it,  but my bad if not. Everyone loves to non stop downvote on reddit just because they don't agree even if someone is just trying to answer their question and it's annoying. I had one better game,  so thank ya
---
No one said just slamming pallets was bad, its the TBAging.
---
And no Bodyblocking isn't a good strat. You take free damage. And 2 perks give the killer free kills when they do it.
---
Actually no the leviathans would make better killers.
---
Me either,  I mean as killer it takes longer. As survivior I find matches quickly too,  on ps4 and we are a duo.
---
Not letting survivors do bones is camping now?
---
apparently lol
---
THAT would be sick.
---
But if your opponents are always happy, you're always losing. I'm all for the positivity, but why waste your time? Why start a game, any game, and be like "boy, I can't wait to lose?"
---
Wow. I just finished a game where this exact thing happened and I just opened up reddit to see this wonderful comic. This is beautiful
---
Well i mean, he aint wrong since you didn’t specify
---
Is that bubbanda?
---
well played, but this is kinda cringe
---
I almost never get campers in red ranks, but today I played against this madman camping with Insidious insta-saw Billy.
---
Because he is the killer and his job/purpose in this game is to kill you
---
It literally depends on your playstyle.
---
My brain shut off for a second because I was about to comment ‘what game is that review on’ before remembering what subreddit i’m browsing
---
 Now this is even more surprising
---
Thought they changed it so that it's only one pip now as opposed to two?
---
You act like some negative internet points is a personal attack on someone, and call those people mentally ill. While asking for positivity.
---
Homeboy youre the weird one what the fuck.
---
I just realised that I wrote he’s instead of hrs
---
Oh his purpose is to kill solely me and not other survivors I'm sorry but your just dumb
---
yeye, still wanna know
---
That would be amazing. They’re so underrated in my opinion.
---
Check forums or dbd wiki, that’s your best bet
---
No, no, god please no
---
I miss when that show was good. It really went downhill when every episode for like 6+ seasons straight was just "angels this, demons that."
---
I loved the beginning with urban legends and mythical creatures, when it all just became religion-ey it sucked.
---
Actually, they did explain the technical process in this very informative update: 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/36658/tech-efforts-unreal-engine-optimization-amp-dedicated-servers
---
They explained how they are converting from blueprint coding to C++ in the attempt to minimize strain on the game and provide a smoother experience so they aren’t afraid to enlighten us on some of the complexities.  
---
For some reason, they just dropped the topic with no update.
---
I’m just like, “did you try to sell out your team mate? Now I really want you.”
---
Not necessarily. You do have to play a bit scummy with this build, but I usually hook my obsession once or twice, and then make sure to slug them if I spot them, in order to not only prevent them from repairing, but also from healing. Most games I average about 3 kills. From what I gathered, after Dying Light stacks to 4 and up, most players seem to stop healing all together, making chases easier. I don’t ignore my obsession. I just make sure not to kill them.
---
I was thinkin maybe Cain would be a good killer, or maybe a good ol Jefferson Starship
---
Ok lol good luck
---
r/wholesomememes
---
In the good way or bad way for her?
---
By the logic of the mods, this should be taken down
---
They're testing dedicated servers live.
---
I'm assuming that means a program that uses the old p2p connections won't work.
---
Rip people dodging anyone who could beat them.
---
Or if he used his ebony add on that prevents skill checks from waking you up
---
Me: *In chase with killer, looping them to death* to easy
---
Friend: I found the ruin I’m gonna pop it
---
**HEX: HUNTED GROUNDS**
---
Killer: now it’s all coming together now
---
Negan would be cool as a killer! Imagine hearing the whistle as his terror radius!
---
I just had it on Myers myself, only for me it felt mostly good because my internet as killer/host is normally wildly inconsistent. (I only played killer because I had two Myers dailies, which made it worth the risk). There was one moment early-ish in the match when I stalked to a certain point, and then about 5% of that progress immediately disappeared. There was also a moment when EW3 popped earlier than I meant it to, but that was probably just my mistake. Other than that, I was just relieved to see no one was rubberbanding. When the match ended, and it said “Host disconnected” a minute or two into the chat, I was baffled and came here to see what the situation is. I’ll be relieved when we get dedicated servers (so I feel comfortable playing killer more regularly), but that doesn’t mean they’re ready yet.
---
This is too fucking cute
---
Yeah I saw that happening with some killers, but I think this person really dc’d lol.
---
No? That's a free escape for everyone else.
---
It’s gotten me once or twice
---
No other players left on the board, last man standing
---
Errrrm WTF
---
The longer I look the worse it gets
---
And you could say the exact thing about survivor, you can only do gens and leave, and get minimal bloodpoints, or you can try and interact with the killer and other survivors for boldness and alturism points.
---
Endgame collapse sacrifice gives about a third of the points of a late game hook, and bleeding out grants none. Go get a drink of water or something and enjoy denying them blood and emblem points.
---
This is the only thing I've ever gotten mad and flamed a killer for.
---
Everything else is just game mechanics or doing what they can to win, but at that point they've won and they're just wasting time.
---
It wasn't even me or even my friend who it was done to and it still pissed me off.
---
Yea my games doing the same. I guess server maintenance? Maybe?
---
That's been happening a lot for me too! It's been all day
---
Haha I like that
---
ooh my bad no i got the info from the dev update on the reddit https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/
---
Actually, the Hatch was made by Vigo, not the Entity: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Vigo
---
Fear not, plague main here, hoping to meet you in the red ranks!
---
The maps are created based on the memories of the killers and survivors so let's it's the demogorgon from Hawkins lab it would vividly remember the portal and place technically the portal is more so just a memory instead of a actual portal.
---
Lmao as soon as I seen it was Etsy I knew why such an atrocity was being marketed.
---
Terrible. You can throw hatchets straight on and they won't hit it's literally impossible to play her anyway besides M1ing her
---
How is it entitlement.  How is it an unreasonable expectation for a killer that isn't even good to be allowed to press its advantage that it earnt.  
---
You're allowed to disagree, I would just like an explanation on why you think it's fair that the pig has the reward from her good play just removed. Creating equal ground when one level of play is above the other just means that you're punishing the person playing good which is literally the total opposite of fair
---
There is a very clear difference between a killer just naturally not going after someone and a survivor working with them.
---
Typically done this as a killer if it's the last two people and I noticed someone's playing a mess and waiting for someone else to die whilst that specific person's doing gens.
---
Typically smack them shake my head to tell them not to do generators whilst I go look for the person who's hiding.
---
Oh so you do know that there are more changes coming. Your original comment didn't seem like that.
---
&gt;If Ataxic respiration wasn't touched
---
Is grim pantry considered a good map for anyone
---
That's lame, survivor ques are bad enough I can't imagine dodging that frequently. Plenty of killers are offline. Do you ever play a game?
---
the new nurse buff looks great
---
Plaid Flannel is useful and should be a common one. Add on that does the work for ya? That won't teach you a thing.
---
 Never happened , really Lucky you
---
Trapper has to trap 3 people, which requires survivors to make a mistake, for 25k
---
Legion has to hit 4 people for 30k
---
this is wholesome &lt;3 i like doing this every now and then (and when i find baby dweets) gotta push that positive energy forward!
---
Well, killers don't really have much of a choice when it comes to perks. If you are playing a killer woth low map control, then Ruin is a must. Otherwise you will get gen rushed into thr shadow realm. If you play a basic M1 killer (Pig, Bing Bong, Ghostface, etc.), you are basically inclined to run Enduring with Spirit Fury, as those killers struggle a lot when it comes to ending chases fast. I mainly play survivor, but it's quite sad that the killers are basically forced to run some perks and can't try playing with others.
---
Source on testing dedicated servers? Still seems like p2p to me.
---
&gt; and that takes no skill either
---
180 camera spin, preferably pre-charge the 2nd blink, know where to aim &amp; how long to hold for max charge without going into fatigue... Sure it's no rocket science but it takes something :)
---
Then one quits and as soon as they do another survivor joins, but the one that just joined sees the lobby isn't full as soon as they come in so they leave too
---
It’s the salt. I get it. I get pissed and cuss too when I play so well throughout the entire match and suddenly get downed by NOED because I happened to run into the killer. I get disappointed mostly. 
---
Or I get hooked right as the last gen pops. Killer secures me. Or I’m the final survivor and killer checks the exit gates. It’s frustrating because I’ve died so much when I felt like I deserved to escape. But then I actually use my brain cells and ask myself, “Well, what else is the killer supposed to do...? Go to a corner and jerk off?” 
---
Once the exit gates are powered up, everything’s fair game. I am a religious survivor main and I guarantee you, any survivor with more than one brain cell will feel the same way. It is frustrating for us, yes, but it’s not your fault. Just let us be frustrated. It passes and it’s not your fault.
---
I need  unmasked legion if they work just a bit on hair I would love it
---
Sure, variety is good. This add on just holds your hand and does the work for ya, not good.
---
You know the exact same can be applied for the other party.
---
The game is a lot more balanced than it used to be and that typically because a lot of them are very unnecessary advantages that survivors are  no longer present.
---
This is coming from somebody who plays both sides.
---
Things like vacuum pallets
---
Infinite
---
Old decisive and MoM
---
Pre nerf exhaustion
---
And those are just a few examples were very poorly balanced.
---
If you're going to act like all of these things were completely balanced and then you can't really complain when people tell you otherwise.
---
Lastly judging from the post you've made above you really aren't the type of person who should be preaching understanding the other. 
---
When you describe or talk about people in the negative and condescending manner don't be surprised if they immediately don't want to listen to what you're saying especially when you then ask for people to understand your side and makes you come off as a massive hypocrite.

KILLERS THAT DO THIS ARE GENUINELY STUPID. IT’S OBVIOUS I KNOW HOW TO AVOID AND RUN YOU, GO AFTER SOMEONE WHO CAN’T! PLAY SMART, NOT HARD!

ill be happy once we get rid of trash

How do we combine inktober with spooktober? spinktober?
---
Do you have a youtube?
---
Or after spawning in *hits sick nae nae*
---
Been doing this with Wraith. But I only have tier 1, so they continue to gen rush and never expect NOED after it as well.
---
You probably have solid internet.  It's the killers that knowingly host games with unstable connections that have survivors looking forward to dedicated servers.
---
I hate when you let someone escape and they don't even say "gg" or "thanks" 😢
---
I can vaguely see the squinted eyes of a smile
---
Or you can run what every killer runs, chili, noed, ruin, and fill
---
That Billy got his butt cheeks played by that Nancy
---
I was gonna make a list about it but I’ll just ask here, to get adept on a character (using their 3 perks) can you also use items/offerings too?
---
Start a petition?
---
"Scary and somewhat feminine"
---
???
---
That's like the definitive version of Shaggy for some people o:
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
When in the game does it say that? From the wiki article it just sounds like speculation.
---
Dunno about console, but killers on PC can check if survivors are together
---
CAN WE BUFF BOIL OVER? IT IS ENTIRELY NEGATED BY A KILLER SPAMMING THE STRAFE KEYS.
---
WHAT ABOUT PROTECTION HIT SCORING DETECTION?
---
DOES ANYONE EVEN REMEMBER ASH'S "BUCKLE UP" PERK? IT DESERVES AN AWARD FOR BEING THE MOST INCONSEQUENTIAL PERK YET.
---
THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY TED TALK.
---
Ya but how many games do killers stomp bc we solos got matched with rank 20s? Finally you can dodge new rankers but that's sometimes another 10min wait at least for me. Swf is the only way you can currently guarantee good team mates to be matched with you. Solo is a total gamble of surv quality. Even at red ranks.
---
They can, but they rarely do
---
Foreal. Shinbi was my all time favorite
---
I really dont see the decisive change as a nerf, its still top tier and you def still run it
---
Some tasty lookin beans
---
i just started playing and genuinely expected a hell hole. I got the complete opposite. Since the start I’ve had help from both sides, Killers even dropping me at the hatch because I assume they felt bad lol. I’m on Xbox though, no text chat unless they message me directly. So maybe that’s an important part as of why the toxic say toxic stuff, because they can.
---
When the killer quits and the game throws all players back to the splash/title screen and all players loose pips and don't earn anything. 
---
BECAUSE THE KILLER QUIT???
---
We should not be getting penalised because the killer/"host" disconnects to cry that he's not winning. This is the ultimate in toxic play. 
---
This has happened too many times. Why can't the game go back to rewarding survivors? Killer gets quitter bonus but we lose pips and Bloodpoints?? 
---
And then gotta press the A to load the game, get the party to work (hopefully) and then wait 30 minutes to find a match...
---
This is awful
---
LIKE I LITERALLY CANT PLAY RN IT WONT PUT ME IN A GODDAMN GAME
---
The most unskilled killer with the most unskilled addon
---
It's not scary, it's frustrating. Overpowered does not automatically equal scary. Wanna make real suggestions to making dbd scary? Slow the pace down, darken the maps for survs, give killers slightly better vision. Produce higher quality soundtrack that's actually scary, not so much like action. I'm still waiting for this mode....
---
Balanced is really good too. I think it's being used more than normal because it's so good on the new map. Spine Chill is low key a very good perk. I wouldn't say meta necessarily, but still very solid.
---
 Current range add-ons make it so the same amount of charge translates to more distance, making it so you practically get
---
CHARGE SPEED (don't need to charge as much to get the same result)
---
BLINK MOVEMENT SPEED (less charge = less travel distance)
---
BLINK MAX RANGE (you can go further)
---
After the change they suggested, you're losing CHARGE SPEED, so it evens out and the new Range add-ons make the blink work "normally" but let you charge for longer to get further.
---
You're still getting a bit of blink movement speed tho
---
Did he possibly deadhard in place?
---
ITs so minimalistic ! I love it !
---
Wtf I WANT A TROPICAL MAP
---
What type of playstyle/build did you use? I used to run Discordance, NOED, Blood Warden/BBQ, and Save The Best For Last/Haunted Grounds/Monitor.
---
During the Mettle Of Man Crisis One Punch Freddy was one of my favorites.
---
Freddy with Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Monitor and Abuse, and Rancor. With the tracking and stalling you could easily ignore the obsession all game and constantly juggle back to him and away for PWYF stacks, never hit him once, and then mori him in one hit with Rancor.

This is the concept that I don’t understand in a game like this. It sounds like you are implying anything less than a 4K is a loss for killer. With the standards that high killer sounds like it isn’t fun to play.
---
Ah yes a group of hyenas vs the elephant
---
I gonna order some ~~new pair~~ multiple pair of pants !
---
It was certainly a nerf as it's undoubtedly worse than before. You had the option to use it like it is now just no timers and you could also use it in any other situation.
---
It's still a good perk, and much more healthy now, but it was still a nerf.
---
Yup, that's what I said. Nationalists should be eradicated as we did with Neetsi, even if some still around. 
---
Trash like those don't belong to this Earth
---
This would be amazing, my wallet wouldn't appreciate it tho
---
Nonsense! Just look at that dreamy gaze she’s giving his luscious hair
---
Its been fantastic for me, best experience I've ever had playing honestly. SWF as well full team.
---
What do you mean, he's holding Nea by the shirt?
---
I no longer get to keep items I escape with now. I'm assuming this is a bug? 3 games in a rw where I left with an item and I'm not getting to keep it.
---
Quentin lives matter
---
But I wasn't suggesting that a game should ever be matched based on the lowest ranked survivor and I would also be strongly opposed to that. I don't want new killers getting demolished and having no fun.
---
If you take the average rank of a lobby then a rank 20 killer should NEVER get 3 red ranks. If you have a rank 1, 3, 4, and 20 then it should give you a killer around rank 7. 
---
I get that killers don't get a choice on whether they play an SWF or not, but its not like survivors get to pick which killer with what addons they play against. I would love to never play a prayer beads spirit ever again, but that's just how it goes sometimes.
---
You can't always win and you can't have every game be as even as possible. If you put an SWF in a game based solely off of the highest rank, then it guarantees that every game they get is strongly in the killers favor.
---
Yeah I know, but in the like 14 million different possibilities Dr. Strange looked through, there wasn't one where someone tells Mantis to shut the fuck up so Quill doesn't freak out? Makes no sense to me, honestly, but it's not like it's a big deal. Infinity War and Endgame were still fucking awesome.
---
What would be the killer though? A zombie wouldn’t work.
---
Negan??
---
Then you are more toxic than them
---
They aren't forced to play agianst higher level killers. It's their choice whether they wanna go within SWF group with high lvl survivor, or to play solo against low rank killer.
---
This happened to me twice today. I was so pissed because I dropped rank twice. I'm too scared to play thinking it will happen again. The game has been so buggy for me as of recently.
---
I actually have a fan chapter I’m working on for a zombie killer including a killer power for him. It could work. 
---
And be again/alpha/governor are also options.
---
So... If the killer do it's job and someone DC or whatever, is abuse?..
---
Wow
---
Quentins rise up
---
She was probably “encouraged” by the entity
---
No matter what I always give the least experienced person hatch. To try make them feel better
---
Um you’ve obviously never played survivor ever lmao.
---
But zombies are slow AF 😂
---
Found the camper

I would love your options 1, 3, and 4! I’d add in something from hell raiser and/or candy man.

---
dude, the demogorgon full charged shred daily is also pretty brutal

Are you not friends with him on Facebook?
---
Get good
---
I play solo Survivor and it's not a problem at all. Maybe because I'm used to get frustrated since I played fighting games since I was a kid, and those are very frustrating
---
But. Survivor still fine, it's the easiest role since you can rely on others, even just by holding one button and doing gens. Way less stressful about a timer since you control it, and overall more enjoyable even chase wise.
---
I really disagree with you. I think you're frustrated because you won't adapt or get better to the game, that's it. You don't learn from your losses but instead cry about it, if it's that easy just get to red ranks as killer then come back
---
I love hang mans trick but it’s to situational. But god dam it’s satisfying to hook 4 people on the same hook and hook someone on a hook that just got destroyed
---
Bubbanda’s just a myth

No then playing against a rank 12 wraith  because 3 1s and a 20 average out to 12 apparently

---
Again it is beyond clear we are not going to agree on this.  I'm with the devs on the matter and you're not.  Best to move on we've both said pretty much everything there is to say.
---
Rick Grimes (survivor) and Negan (killer) in DBD, 
---
"Look at THAT, TAKING IT LIKE A CHAMP!!!".........-mori hehe
---
what.
---
i agree with u!
---
Just imagine the mori possibilities If it’s a walker killer
---
I was about to say that lol
---
Sure but it's not the same as saying that to have a decent match, spirit and nurse (also Billy imo) are the best to go with. Others just struggle a lot just to get few hooks, for lack of map pressure, very susceptible to loops and so on
---
Plus, really? Crying about bbq that has at least 5 counters? Maybe 6 now that you can hide in lockers too.. you just spout "op" whenever just looping doesn't work. GitGud son
---
You can also mind game, fake directions and so on, it's not all about loops but I guess learning isn't your jam isn't it
---
Dunno why you're getting down-votes my dude, you're bang on the money. I constantly get hit from way too far away to make it legit.
---
They would easily be in my top 10 :)
---
Crap I haven't bought the updated survivor Rulebook..
---
You should shave. Looks like you have pubes growing from your jaw.
---
Yeah i spent the whole game on the killers back and also dropped a rank. Must be a new bug, this is definately a "I think we did a pretty good job so far" situation
---
This is actually really cool I need more killer vs killer stuff like this in my life.
---
Contact the support team, they’re really good with fast responses (at least in my experience) and should give you a good range of solutions to try. Best of luck.
---
Yeah, but you can get a 4k without tunneling and camping.  It's your job to hit survivors and hook them.
---
You can even make a good argument that *not tunneling and camping* is the best strategy for a killer.  
---
And if you just avoid camping and tunneling, borrowed time and decisibe strike can't do anything to stop you.
---
He argued Pig's Rules Set #2 being base kit [would be a nerf and not a buff](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/726227/#Comment_726227)

Nice attempt but I notice the camera style you play with doesn’t translate very well to a viewer. Maybe try a more calm style of hunting or getting some intel hex’s to let you see the bigger picture during a match.

Ah yes, a single experienced survivor totally can't loop baby killers the entire game. 
---
Uneven matches are always bad and now survivors can't force the killer into them anymore, only themselves.
---
Tbf, you can't double pip at red ranks if you use the saw.
---
Bloody useless Chaser emblem...
---
You don't think things would be more fun if Hillbilly's saw was as hard to land and Demo's Shred?
---
IF YOU CLEANSE THEN YOU HAVE NO LOOP CAPABILITIES AS SHE CAN JUST VOMIT AND DOWN YOU. HOWEVER SHITTY STAYING BROKEN AND NOT CLEANSING IS AT LEAST YOU HAVE A CHANCE IF YOU CAN LOOP WHICH YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO AT HIGH RANK.
---
It's a bad system that's abusable vs a bad system that's not. The latter is just less toxic so that's what we get.
---
STOP GIVING ME THE SAME QUENTIN DAILY
---
Hey not bad. I actually never thought about what the perks would look like, if they had color.
---
That's literally what we had before and it was awful for baby killers.
---
I just want to play with my friends. Stop attacking me. Typical killer mains.
---
I-
---
Don't totally hate it. I mean it definitely sounds better than having TWD crossover with Tekken.
---
Too bad, walkers are slow as hell and can get rekt by a kid even lol. Even DBD Meg could punch it's head once to decapitate it lol.  Negan all the wayyyy. "Lucielle is thirsty... she is a VAMPIRE BAT!" -Negan laughing
---
They're not forced to though, they have to choose to do it.
---
It's not always the Survivor's fault, if they get caught in a deadzone. Sometimes, map RNG means therevare huge areas with no pallets or windows.
---
And has a limited range, which cannot be ended early.
---
You haven't played much Billy at rank 1 have you?
---
As a killer main dabbling in survivor recently I have utmost respect for anyone mental enough to play killer especially on PS4. If my “team-mates” are flashlight clicking, teabagging and bullying the killer I will actively sandbag them. I know it’s not the right way to approach things but if they want to ruin everyone else’s fun I’m sure as hell gonna ruin theirs. Be kind to your killers people :) Oh and killer mains, never face camp and tunnel either, it’s a two way street :)
---
BbQ&amp;Chilli: Im going to ruin this man's whole career
---
Should i be proud getting rank1 playing no perk no addon wraith? :3
---
so with 825 hours, you sure seem to have the best knowledge lmfao.  someone just proved you wrong lmfaoooo. i KNEW I WASN'T MENTAL!
---
I mean.. to me happens only after a match and isn't a big deal tbh
---
You seem like the kind of person whose friends say they are sick but they are actually at a party together.
---
Deliverance, ds, breakdown and adrenaline was the build I used when I was getting the trophy
---
Its not that bad, atleast for me
---
Omfg is this a thing? I'm so glad I opened this post
---
*Angry Ash main noises*
---
Mad respect for that. He's got only a slight increase in movement speed when cloaked, and a niche ability to lunge further after coming out of cloak. Might as well be a 155 killer without an ability. Good job

---
DP'd... but I wouldn't recommend company WiFi.
---
You seem like a mouth breather, can't have a decent conversation without resorting to being a dick
---
Nah its a glich if you pick yourself up from downed state as the killer also picks you up
---
Dont mess wit da voodoo mon.
---
You comment like an ass and got treated like an ass. Begone.
---
You're the one butthurt over nothing lmao
---
What those arms do gurl 😩😩
---
It isn't the Internet, he has the update already downloaded. He's running off of a potato
---
Well I have to say, thank you for your sacrifice
---
It's not shitty it's just the smartest play though? Assuming no extra information, you always just go for the easier target.
---
You know what else is shitty? Being looped around the killer shack for 1 minute. Is it wrong? No, it's just the smartest thing to do; you loop the killer. Why on Earth would I aim someone much harder to kill and was willing to risk their safety to save someone anyways?
---
I mean, it proved my point perfectly

I wish Deliverance worked with Second Wind.

&gt;It's already been established that this community is the worst in existence with it being 95% bullying.

That's funny. Nice joke buddy, I guess it's your first community. Welcome
---
Really tho, I find this community fine, they are passionate.. in their own way.. but is far from what I consider toxic. Compared to others I just see saints here
---
The only bad thing is that players don't enjoy both sides as much as the should, which is a shame. Except that, it's a decent one

Enjoy :D
---
This would be the perfect fit for a hulking berserker killer, it be fun to go up a Nemesis or Mr.X style character in dbd.
---
You are a bloody legend thanks dude!
---
Username checks out
---
Exactly this. Had a few games FULL of baby survivors. I just had to let them all go.
---
I just wanna run dumb meme builds :')
---
Pls don't sweat on my clearly idiotic no mither - empathy - head on - tenacity build. My and my potatoes just want to play hide and seek in the basement. Killer join in with the fun as we have a slumber party. We'll give free BP if you're equally as silly.
---
I wait as long as it takes. Sometimes it's 30 seconds, others is 5 minutes.
---
Rank 3 here (no flex, really). I’ve thought about it for about a week or two and it’s way too true. The people you meet between rank 8-1 are very different from the people you meet at rank 20-8. 
---
Don’t know what it is yet that has that effect, it could be the fact that the rank turns purple at rank 8 but something just snaps at reaching rank 8. Guess it’s the “Thanos Effect” lol.
---
The advantage of staying awake is you get to play more dbd
---
i used to play stuff like this, i like to play Spirit where i have this twisted personality .... if someone breaks a active totem i go after them  , down them then run to a corner and look at the corner (as like NO I DIDNT MEANT TO DO IT IM SORRY), Most of the time i have Rancor aswell so i can kill one guy just to say sorry later, most people i faced with this had alot of fun but didnt knew what was going on. Back in the days i also used to fake afk and wait for survs to be next to me and attack them either with NOED or stuff like Bubba, when im talking about bubba i actually did a Basement bubba protect the chest just a few weeks ago :D , People brought all there items into my basement and left them there (some one purpose some  met the good old Hammer to the face with Franklins :P ).
---
You should probably clarify it’s for PC
---
Yes I can't play anymore since this bug
---
This shows how people are in real life.. just ignorant crap
---
Yeah, we disagree about how to play. That's what I was saying.
---
I don't understand why people are still complaining about hate mail. If you are so sick of it, then set your messages to friends only. Instead you wanna come here and cry about it.
---
Using your brain and learning to go on with your life when people don't play the way you want? UNACCEPTABLE!
---
Even easier to juke the nurse just keep running straight to gain more distance. Yay
---
IF YOU DON'T WANT DS DON'T FUCKING TUNNEL. THAT'S WHY I AND MANY SURVIVORS BITCH ABOUT TUNNELING AND USE THE GODDAMN PERK. IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT 4% RNG UNHOOKS THEN YOU ARE NOT SANE. AND BODYBLOCKING CAN SAVE SOMEONE FROM TUNNELING SO THAT MAKES IT OK. SO SURVIVORS CAN COMPLAIN FOR TUNNELING WHILE USING THESE PERKS AND BT AS WELL ALL THEY FREAKING. AND NURSE AND SPIRIT ARE S TIER KILLERS. THAT'S WHY THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM
---
Is MLGA even possible on PS4 or XBOX?
---
... rank? No, seriously.. try to play through ruin. Isn't difficult and you don't have to look for it if you can hit skillchecks, takes practice but is doable
---
I don't care anymore if they use ruin since I hit it most of the time. Plus I won't blame the killers who uses it since games usually last for 5min even with ruin, so..
---
DC for just that perk is childish and show how they never played a videogame before in their life. Besides Tetris and Minecraft
---
When one person decides to screw over the team and cleanse
---
It's difficult at first but try it.
---
To get good at it I made it like a rhythm game and it worked. Now I hit skillchecks often and ruin doesn't affect me as much.
---
Do gens &gt; cleanse ruin
---
THESE ARE MANLY TEARS I SWEAR.
---
Let me tell you a little bit about game development. I myself am not a developer but have worked on mods and have friends that are in game development. Every time a bug gets fixed another bug is gonna pop right up.
---
Why tf is Steve’s head so big lmao
---
I don't talk nonsense, I just had half the information from you cause you just now told me how the game went after he killed you because you were so focused on the big bad killer killing a prey he needs to play to win. And if tunneling isn't smart and he lost just get over it and fcking play the game. If you can't handle a loss competitive video games are simply the wrong hobby for you.
---
That message feels like it was written by a 10 year old
---
Imagine thinking slugging was a bannable offense. FeelsRank20Man
---
Points. Gotta get them points boyo frick everything else
---
If you weren't allowed to slug, you wouldn't be able to choose to.
---
They always need an excuse to justify their bad gameplay, expecting killers to give them free saves and always be nice to them.
---
Certain survivors really think they are amazing at the game because they can hit skillchecks and finish generators quickly or stun you once the entire game. Same thing happens for killer, they maybe pick huntress with iridescent addon and think they are amazing at the game.
---
Like someone said once, this game has competitive REJECTS and people that never played a competitive game before and think Dbd is extremely difficult
---
&gt;15.6k people watching. 
---
You're in trouble bud. The world only has 15.5k people.

A nasty high sugar coffee drink at Starbucks costs just about the same as a dude with a chainsaw wearing someone’s else’s face. The coffee last 30 minutes. BBQ and Chili is forever(until servers shut down).
---
Ah, I see. So you're perfectly fine with people getting snarky and dismissive. You just get pissy when it's \*your\* ideas that get rejected.
---
i would love it if the game had fog like [that.It](https://that.It) would bring some atmosphere which the game desperately neeeds.
---
Ive had a very similar message before. Lol slugging is cheating
---
LOL okay
---
I honestly love getting angry messages from people. It makes my day
---
This sounds like a great mechanic for console players /s
---
I was so confused just kinda looked in awe for a bit.
---
If someone is really good then when they do really good in game thats a good and fair thing.
---
I'm a rank 1 Billy already. A REALLY good survivor can make it literally impossible to chainsaw unless you're using addons for instasaw or speed/curving. If you chainsaw someone it either means they weren't at a loop or they gave you the opportunity to chainsaw them by being greedy with pallets or simply just messing up. These things happen even with rank 1 survivors just not nearly as often.
---
I'm not saying Billy isn't a good killer, but there is counter play unlike with Spirit or Nurse.
---
you can’t make us!!! /s
---
This is awesome.  It’s also me.
---
Nice b8 m8
---
I love the map as killer. Amazing totem spawns, ridiculously weak pallets everywhere, survivors constantly getting lost, LOS everywhere for stealth, relatively quick to get across, etc.
---
Yeah I main ghost face and always let the last person go
---
And add a toolbox to sabotage corner hooks

An inreresting fact about the red rose.. David is a Mancunian (someone from Manchester, England), which historically was set in the county of Lancashire. Over the recent decades Manchester has become an increasingly large and sprawling metropolitan city, and surround villages and towns are associated with it are referred to as being a part of "Greater Manchester" rather than Lancashire, but purists (myself included) still consider Manchester as a part of Lancashire. Lancashire borders the county Yorkshire (God's own country!), and the two counties have had a famous rivalry dating back to the mid 15 century which originates due to the two royal houses, the House of Lancaster (Lancashire) and the House of York (Yorkshire), who were vying for the throne of England. The House of Lancaster was represented by the red rose, and the House of Yorkshire was represented by the white rose. Ultimately, the house of Lancaster won this "War of the roses", ending with the famous Battle of Bosworth. This is when Richard the 3rd was killed and Henry the 7th was crowned king of England, and marked the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Both counties still use these roses to represent each other, and the "rivalry" still exists to this day, albeit it's largely tongue in cheek and in good humour.
---
That being said, any tattoo on the neck upwards gets a "yikes" from me!
---
Upvote for visibility
---
Seems it has to do with dedicated servers as I just noticed it too and it coincided with the dedicated server testing without any update to the game.
---
Personally I get whacking people like a pinata is a shitty thing to do, but there arguably are people that deserve it. I usually do it to people who suicide on the hook so I can squeeze in all that extra brutality they WOULD have gotten, but would otherwise miss out on because they're a chickenshit who would rather bounce the second things don't go their way. Also, because it makes it look like I'm killing them faster.
---
No offense, but I don't give a shit what you think about the map. The whole point of my post was to ask if anyone's gotten the map recently SMH
---
I completely agree with you and btw, i think green ranks are the worst.. heavy insults at the end of every match, you are kinda forced to take off the chat
---
Put a cooldown on crouching....to stop bm.
---
Put a cooldown on flashlight clicking, to stop bm.
---
Same. Matchmaking has been fucking shit for years. Almost ready to give up on this game.
---
It was like that
---
Then they brought a ton of *Mary* and they came back to work high af
---
Are you me? Just finished a game where 2 asshats dc on getting downed, and a friendly trapper farms with us a bit before letting one of us go. Trappers be good people.
---
The thing with ebony tho is that it would turn even the hardest game into a Story Mode
---
I'm on Xbox and I haven't had it at all since chapter has been released. Ended up going on kill your friends to find out what it's like.
---
&gt;it's the easiest role since you can rely on others
---
Rely on others... Everytime I do that as a solo survivor I get an easier death. Noob teammates are not players you can rely on buddy,unless you play SWF. And OP has valid point. So far you get games where you vault a window pallet, start sprinting for a meter or two and still get smacked even at great internet speeds. You drop a pallet and die after the animation is ended with the killer stunned. Idc about OP killer addons or Perks. That's another topic and I know for a fact some survivor perks are clutch for us as well. But at least the cheap internet connection kills have to go
---
Do you think she is fun to play against and fair?
---
I just simply don't give a fuck and am being honest. What's so bad about that
---
&gt;Everytime I do that as a solo survivor I get an easier death. Noob teammates are not players you can rely on buddy,unless you play SWF. And OP has valid point.
---
I only play solo and I'm fine. Many people play solo and are doing fine. Are you sure isn't a You problem?
---
&gt;So far you get games where you vault a window pallet, start sprinting for a meter or two and still get smacked even at great internet speeds.
---
Dodge 200+ lobbies. That's it
---
&gt;You drop a pallet and die after the animation is ended with the killer stunned.
---
You dropped it too late or you are playing in a laggy lobby. Next time Dodge it
---
&gt;That's another topic and I know for a fact some survivor perks are clutch for us as well. But at least the cheap internet connection kills have to go
---
I'm down for that but still, Dodge laggy lobbies. Isn't hard, I rarely get bs hit and usually is because that specific killer has lag spikes but that's it. Maybe is because I have a decent connection but I rarely find people with more than 130 ping and works just fine
---
Ye. I think it's just kinda sad that you *know* there are players out there that take pride in the fact that they potentially shoo away new blood. Because, "I have so much fun being a fucking goblin to the other players of this game!"
---
Same I haven't gotten it since it got released , and the map is good with scratch mirror myers that's about it
---
Well but there's no way me and my friends haven't played this map once in over a week from just luvk
---
You can blame true swf for this, rank isn't so much of a problem unless they are all together. The hands are better for killers and this needs time to settle to see if it's always going to be this bad. Hopefully you'll start to see more killers at medium ranks and this should sort the issue out.
---
What’s so bad about hitting downvote and ignoring him if you don’t care about the comment?
---
Oh god
---
Yes
---
I don't know, I just respond to most people. It doesn't even matter lmao
---
I do that with 
---
1- good survivors who should have not died to me
---
2- to new survivors
---
If they complain about your killer and your not playing nurse (or prayer beads spirit) then they’re just salty, gg and move on, don’t let it get to you
---
Survivors can play it safe on most maps and avoid falling for mind games due to sheer amount of pallets.
---
I do, I've played survivor against her and won a game or two. Like playing against nurse, except she's stronger than nurse on console. 
---
The biggest issue is that people don't adjust their playstyle and still expect to win against every killer. 
---
I've lost games as spirit as the team don't play to my strengths.
---
There’s 5 McMillan maps, 5 Badhams, 2 Red Forrests, 5 Autohavens, 5 Coldwind Farms, 2 Asylums, 2 Swamps, Haddonfield, Yamaoka Estate, Mount Ormond, Gideon, Lerys and Hawkins. That’s very long odds of getting the map without an offering. It’s all RNG based, 1/32 chance is unlikely at best.
---
that's cool and everything, but can we talk about stbfl on nurse.
---
Wow you're the ultimate pussy I bet you brag about being a red rank Survivor. 
---
This is why you clowns getting matched with highest rank in swf now
---
I personally don't give a fuck what people say to me. I'm moreso using examples I came across tonight to highlight what I feel is the main issue that will hinder the health of this game. Maybe not now, maybe not next update, but I just got kind of a bad feeling when people are allowed to sling slurs at you and reporting does fuck all.
---
No update on a bloodweb update to get rid of that repulsive perk grind either.
---
If you read other replies you can see I'm not the only one. On top of everyone I know, who all also haven't gotten it since the first few days of it's release
---
What’s up with everyone complaining about spirit all of a sudden? Not talking about you in particular, but the whole sub seems to have a target on her all of a sudden, despite her not really being changed for about a year now to my knowledge 
---
Except prayer beads, fuck that add on to hell
---
Exact same thing happened to a streamer I was playing against. I hooked him and then he just got stuck on my camera angle as if he was spectating me.
---
Wholesome
---
And I’ve just explained why that is probably the case. There is a 31/32 chance of getting a map that is not Hawkins. Can I be any clearer?
---
All my lobbies are 120ms and lower. All higher than that I get away from. I never play on more than that. Killer connections can be broken in the game while after being good at pre game lobby but I still don't believe it is only the killer's connection. And yes, I don't always get bs hits. I also dodge hits I shouldn't dodge and I know for a fact I am an excellent looper so I don't believe it is a ME problem. I will give props to a good killer that will kill me fair and square. But rn, many of my losses are caused by bad sync hits, killer's lag and lag switching or bad hit detection(mostly Huntress,Demogorgon and Freddy. People that defend these are either killer mains that rarely play as survivors or extremely lucky. I know killers face many problems as well but not like these since they host the game. Any lag can come mostly to their advantage,although I've seen some stupid misses caused by player's lag
---
It’s canon Diavolo has died by tripping and being impaled by a huge trap nurse cock
---
:) thanks for your honesty at the end :)
---
Latency..
---
Stop calling hitbox something that isn't related to it.. god damn it
---
The first 5 seasons of supernatural are incredibly solid, I’d love to have Sam or Dean as a survivor but then the killers would be the ones running
---
Strong =\= bad
---
Haha, to each their own.
---
WHY AM I ALWAYS SPAWNING NEXT TO THE KILLER EVERY GAME
---
It's totally fucking up my solo queue as a red rank survivor as well. I'm starting to have to lobby dodge 3/4 of my games after 5+ minute queues because my fellow red rank/purple rank teammates bring in their new friends against a skilled killer which obviously makes the game not even worth playing. 
---
Imagine honestly thinking it's fair to match some rank 17 dude against a rank 2 spirit or nurse that's running an optimal load-out lmao. The bias here is fucking unbelievable towards killers even though playing killer is actually easy as fuck and it's considerably easier to reach red ranks as a killer than as a solo queued survivor. I'm both btw so I can speak directly from first-hand experience.
---
I've always got at least 1 of my killers with an ebony mori on hand just incase I go against a 3 or 4 stacked swf and man does it create some entertaining chats after match.
---
Me too
---
If we're going by chance here, I have played hundreds of games since. If there's about a 1/32 chance and probably less because of offerings bringing other places in, let's say it's a 1/36 chance or a 1/40 chance. Out of the hundreds of games I've played in this time it is extremely unlikely and almost impossible that I haven't gotten it once.
---
I got it 3 times in 2 hours yesterday, and once today out of 4 games... Luck is exactly what it is, or offerings. I also hate this level as survivor so please take them from me haha.
---
ash vs negan with the lines lmao
---
I could see this being used when the nurse has 3 gens left in close proximity so you stay at the middle gen, blink to one and if u dont see anyone then you would blink back and try the other gen.
---
Yup, this is the new bug i was referring to haha. Fixed a few minor bugs, now we can't play at all. Solved! I got maybe 3 games tonight out of like 25 attempts.
---
Killers say the same thing.  
---
Truetalent for example will 4k for 5 games in a row, have 1 bad match and claim the game is fundamentally flawed and surviviors need nerfs.
---
Just happened to me when I was playing against Freddy, I was around a corner and he didn’t even get around it and still managed to smack me, really wish I had the gameplay
---
So you're sabotaging your team..
---
Cleansing is worse, you can't loop her if she has her power, if you're just injured you still can loop
---
I know it's a 1+1 logic but you'll get it
---
Nah I'm just high.
---
It’s no difference to the RNG where you have all the perks unlocked but can’t find that one you really want until the last bloodweb. I agree that Hawkins has probably appeared less than any other newly introduced map, but there are now more potential maps than ever before. Unless somethings malfunctioned in the coding somewhere, it’s just that the odds are pretty stacked against us finding it.
---
Sniper Freddy
---
What about his older version of his tattoo? 
---
He use to have a different one before they updated it. Does it still have the same meaning?
---
Btw did you have any trouble with breaking pallets and vaulting windows? Cause the killer i faced couldn't do it for a while.
---
2018 Laurie bought a Murder-House for some reason though.
---
I've seen less billy and more freddy / ghostface
---
I played Billy yesterday but only for the chainsaw ritual. I'm a yellow rank... 😖
---
Im the Nice killer😅. Always the last person i will give freedom
---
Was anyone else kinda expecting a butt dance? Props to this Nancy player for being a dope teammate.
---
Please dm the way to do this! Been wanting to mess around in kyf like in cows videos.
---
I dunno... I think if I can easly run for 5 minutes from the killer all the time it MIGHT be a bit easy for survivors now. (Surv. Main btw)
---
Because people think hag a 2k hour experienced player should be the power role in the game
---
It's the Naruto run mode.
---
The fact you're getting downvoted for this but the "wahhh life is so hard for killers that suck at videogames" comment is not, just goes to show how killer biased this sub is.
---
I bet I could get you within 2 loops. I play both sides to red ranks, slightly better on survivor but decent killer.
---
Would be neat if we had a killer who could take on Survivor forms. "Did we have a Dweet in the load out screen?" "..No" "Then who's this Dweet walking with us..?"
---
Deal.
---
My steam name is my reddit name
---
Yes the only requirement for survivor adepts is you are playing as that survivor and are using only their three teachable perks. You can use any offering, and any item you would like
---
There we go. F*ck the talk. Make some FACTS! btw I can't play now for a while because put my pc together so i'll need some day
---
Same. I’ve only played it about 3 times but most of my games are fucking corn maps. I hate playing them even when I play survivor.
---
The wiggle button.
---
\&gt; when we genrushed
---
I like how this Killer pretends to be speaking from a Survivor point of view.
---
Omfg she's a god
---
Should be all gen time
---
pretty good job so far
---
I don't see where we disagree there then
---
Yeah obviously what hosts sees is more accurate than what guests see but that's a p2p problem but still pretty playable.
---
Sometimes it get shitty when the host have some lag but I rarely have games where I took bs hits. Before vaulting I already know if I will get hit or not and most of the time I'm right
---
Still, I don't see disagreement there. Sometimes is shitty due to the nature of p2p but doesn't occurs often and soon dedicated server should fix some of it. It would take a while to be good but since the game wasn't made for a dedicated server, it's understandable that would take a while to fix everything.
---
Not if they want their game to survive, it shouldn't.
---
tfw I looped a Plague for over 2 minutes in a jungle gym yesterday when she had Corrupt. And it wasn't my first time either.
---
Do you play dead by daylight at mcdonalds?
---
Powerless until you’re  hit or fall asleep again
---
No. I don't enjoy playing against Spirit or Hag.
---
This is called bad survivors. If you let someone camp and 4k lmao
---
sksksksksksksksksk
---
Good job? Rank 20 killers exist
---
From which Halloween movie is this?
---
I'd buy these as stickers and pop em on my laptop.
---
Strong killer. Fun to play as. Fun to play against. Number 4 Jumpscare champion. Love her audio. 
---
Also could use a hug.
---
Yeah, /u/yourself013 and this subreddit are just kinda sad. Bad players disguising their toxicity as something justified. Nah. They just can't actually do anything of value without standing and staring. OP is a coward.
---
Its bad but not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It honestly makes the game feel completely different, and in a way unique, certain perks that are useless on PC are suddenly useful/OP. They mentioned Ironwill, but stuff like Quick and Quiet can lose the killer completely if done right. The Quick and quiet/dance with me/lithe combo is actually sick even in purple ranks if you use it properly.

Claudette: Give me your levitation power
---
No offense, but nobody gives a shit that you’re not getting into Hawkins.
---
Looks like a wendigo from Until Dawn
---
The original
---
Kind of reminds me of a game I played when I was still new to the game. Hard fought close game in which the survivors popped all the gems and had an escape open. Three survivors escaped and the fourth.. the poor fourth. He suffered the glitch where you can’t escape and he sadly returns back to the map and accepts his fate. Two of the escapees were pretty toxic but this guy was fair, just played the objective and since I knew I deserved to lose instead of finding a hook, I carried him around looking for the hatch and let him escape. Guy was very gracious after.
---
Haha it’s just part of the games... you get punished for making a mistake, I’ve had that happen to me a few times while looping a killer and it sucks, but it’s my own damn fault for not timing right
---
The problem with spirit is that she's too buffed,  her counters only last a few loops at the most. Nurse has decent counters if you know how to play her, but spirit destroys swf and red ranks. If you're a killer main and you want to get to red, there isn't another killer as viable as S tier Spirit
---
Stop playing, straight up just stop.
---
S A M E
---
Ok? I haven’t played in a week due to life reasons so how was I supposed to know about that usually lag is caused by a shitty connection and if you knew the answer to the question why did you ask it
---
If you cant do it better , you should not complain as it is difficult to do smth like that with a game.
---
Op: Makes a post about a match he had
---
Coments: SPIRIT IS NOT FAIR OR FUN, HURR DURR
---
Lets be honest, people always say that one thing should be fun for both sides, but its so rare to find someone ingame that actually cares about the others fun instead of their own.
---
Read this in the Samination Trapper voice
---
Stone formation? You mean the cow tree? If that’s the case you need to run it counter clockwise. Unless they’re stupid good you should always be able to get a hit there. Forcing the pallet is also usually a must.
---
That's the one! Thank you!
---
Weird, just started for me when the dedicated servers were enabled. My experience must be different. I might have been too fast to assume it was dedicated servers, but for right now, I feel like it may be the problem for me. (Also I have to reply every 10 minutes, fun.)
---
Wait a minute... Mobile version of dbd? Yes officer, this illegal post right here. But really though, have they said to launch dbd on mobile?
---
Np &amp; gl
---
Power has been debunked over and over again
---
What exactly are you asking here? Why survivors hate Spirit? Why they seem to hate her more now than they did a few months ago? Why they disconnect against her?
---
Crop your images.
---
yea p3 nurse is just straight up red with no white parts
---
They had a key and a BNP, if it was the old matchmaking the would get pared up with a rank 15 or 17 killer.
---
But sure THEY didnt have any fun, screw the killers am i right!!
---
David is fucking pissed Steve keeps missing gen skillchecks
---
I've just learned to expect JoJo in some form at this point.
---
Dedicated servers are lagging killers. I hope this is fixed soon. It's unplayable right now as killer.
---
&gt; But really though, have they said to launch dbd on mobile?
---
Are you living under a rock? Not only its been said but people have been playing it for months now.
---
Yeah the killer requirements are ridiculous. Thank god I only have nurse and demogorgon left
---
Let me DM you.
---
No need to be rude, mate
---
Rather them than me. When Spirit is involved, survivors experience are ruined by default. In this case, multiple survivors because my friends also find it boring. Why should I care about the killer experience?
---
Is there any tutorial to make you BeHaviour CEO?
---
Loooooool she's not that bad😅git gud kid
---
loooooooooooooool I don't give a shit
---
Sent an explanation of how to get it!
---
your skill
---
Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time and the other two perks you can choose freely. Adrenaline is always a good pick.
---
Take my downvote for a shit attitude towards the game and ruining other people's experience of playing a character they enjoy
---
&gt;No need to be rude, mate
---
So making a joke about people living under a rock is being rude now? The world is getting so boring. Everything is offensive now.
---
only on PC for a limited time
---
Any small map, mister satan
---
I am that type of killer who lets a survivor go if they are the last one and had a very hard match :)

Oldest post in the west
---
oh no, my internet points
---
my day is ruined
---
Hahahah sometimes this really does just happen.
---
I play with friends a lot, and I don’t run Bond. And just get to running towards whatever walls or junk I have in front of me, and sometimes they’re just there
---
I guess everyone should just play wraith and leatherface then...
---
Depends on your playstyle for me it’s decisive strike adrenaline quick and quiet and either sprint burst or balanced landing
---
But there is a bloodweb update.
---
Tbf at least they are more enjoyable to play against.
---
No pc you potato, Leatherface is licensed. Cant buy it with shards you nub
---
My pip build is dh, sc, we'll make it and bt.
---
ALERT GANG RISE UP
---
Why not use the pallet and save your item?
---
Adorable
---
I would say 80 percent of the time solo teammates will be crouched behind a rock if that happens
---
Omg they had a BNP!!! It does a whopping 25% of a gen! So strong right??
---
Any small map works good with a three gen build.
---
Yer have gsync on?
---
I shall assume you're a survivor main
---
I was just watching this tonight haha
---
 Wtf, nurse in f13? That shirt just confirmed us the new dlc for f13 the gam... oh right, is not possible.
---
No, I’m just not stupid enough to think that BNPs are actually a strong item.
---
1: I have like 50 of that firecracker. 2: That pallet could be useful to other people for a loop
---
No, actually you are quite stupid, gens get done fast now imagine it 25% faster. But ofcourse you're too stupid to think that.
---
I only ever mori when the person would be dead on hook anyways and I don't remember a single person complain to me because of the mori.
---
Just saying.
---
Edit: Unless I happen to have the chance to mori a toxic player. But all bets are off in that case anyway.
---
I LIKE STEALTH KILLERS BUT INDOOR MAP OFFERINGS ARE RARE. WHY CANT I BUY THEM IN BULK.
---
oh my god
---
They usually go :UsUaL sCuM sWf PlAyErS in the chat after the match ends
---
Try and make them drop the pallet, meaning don't respect it, if you
---
Ah, makes sense! Thanks!
---
WHATS *TWO STAGE* INSTA?
---
In fact, I might be the most humble person I know.
---
I try to be a fun killer, so if I manage to rapidly kill 2-3 survivors, I’ll ease up, or even help the last guy find the hatch/fix the gens. Realizing that “winning” isn’t always the most fun in DBD, sometimes it’s nice to just mess around with survivors.
---
To be fair, alot of people "give a fuck" about optional cosmetics, that's why they keep selling all the "cool" ones woth cells only, have exclusive cosmetics only obtainable by buying the dlc (even if you spend the exact same price in cells) and create day 1 cosmetics for new characters. 
---
If nobody cared, they wouldn't be monitised so heavily. 
---
Id wager there's going to be a cool skin in the battlepass and that you can pay for the privilege to skip levels to get it faster
---
you want the easiest and quickest way? Take Claudette with urban evasion, borrowed, sprinburst and spinechill
---
hide, do generators and save and remember to get in a locked whenever someone get hooked to counter bbq
---
I had fantastic luck on the swamp one match. 2 gens on a dock, and one right off it. 
---
There were no survivors &gt;=D
---
What’ll be surprising is if I actually get poor lil Susie into that bully circle
---
Quentin face rework hopefully soon
---
Wait, the next chapter is just 1 person, right?
---
I hope the addon gives Nurse an ass like Tracer.
---
i mean u can play completely fair in a game as killer and get "-rep uses crutch perks" on your steam comments and btw the crutch perk in question is BBQ &amp; Chili... fuck me for wanting bloodpoints i guess.
---
That looks like my teacher when i have my phone out in class, even though theirs nothing else to do
---
I think one use is if you blink on a direction and don’t see someone/went the wrong way.
---
Gotta run small game and bring a rainbow map for maximum efficiency
---
I dunno if thats how this meme template is supposed to be used lol
---
Funny, cuz when I play against Nurse I feel like Genji: I need healing.
---
For me, when I run into a swf that I know will give me hell I just throw in a The Game offering. Easy mode for doctor lmao
---
You double posted
---
Devs won't see this post because only 2 upvotes though. Oh well.
---
They look nice
---
DBD is not really a game to chill and unwind to. It’s supposed to be tense. It’s a fucking horror game. 
---
That said the one sure fire way to lighten my mood is playing Scratched Mirror Myers on Lery’s. Jump scare Olympics givis a laugh riot.
---
I’d add that she’s one of the easiest killers to just pick up and play. I’m a very average killer but can easily get to red ranks with spirit, she’s that good she carries me to a level where I’m way out of my depth.
---
Just like insta heal and brand new part
---
As a Dwight main and the worst player of my old SWF group I appreciate this.
---
In no way is that comparable, one eliminates you from the game, the other just buys you a bit more time
---
They look great! Would look really cool as pins or patches or something
---
What is that thing on the table?
---
I hate this so much, especially when I've done 3 generators and am on my first hook, then it turns out the last guy that was squatting in a corner the whole time has a key and did nothing but look for the hatch.
---
Moris end the game for a survivor. Instant heals only prolong it.
---
There would have been less distance for him to go back instead of forward. Or I guess that would have made him go through me. Dunno.
---
I find it weird that they necessitated giving killing immunity during pickup at all.  
---
I get why, so someone isn't basically invulnerable when laying dying under a pallet... but killer should be able to get people away from camping near it and force them to drop it. So no, I actually don't get it. Just seems like bad design.
---
Buys your a shit ton more time. Time is the most valuable resource in DbD, which is why these 3 offerings/addons are so strong because they significantly slow down or speed up the game
---
Mori completely takes out a player, give me a peek that eliminates the killer completely then we can talk
---
The Bob
---
What?
---
Your point is? You said she had no cooldown and could just go and go.
---
Hey she had to protect her daughter and granddaughter. 
---
She's a wholesome Murder Grandma.
---
Survivors are often entitled. I may not play survivor much, but I rarely even play against spirits. The times I do it is usually really tense, something other killers just don’t do, and I enjoy that. Part of that’s because she reminds me a lot of the monster that still haunts my dreams on occasion, but still. Spirits almost never camp when I play against them too, which you think more people would be happy about.
---
Decisive strike the killers jugular.
---
i like this meme cause this is what i actually think about every time
---
Don't worry I'm a myers main I will gladly slay some survivors this month.
---
I’ve played on it twice.  I played almost 12 hours on Sunday and saw it once.  Now that you mention it, I might just use offerings.  Didn’t feel great, but looked really cool.
---
Lol I get what you mean but you can earn her most camo cosmetics though. They aren't locked behind cells
---
imagine complaining about BNP in 2019 and comparing it to being eliminated before the second hook
---
wait she looses her power if she gets stunned? i never knew that
---
I’m having this happen too. I’m rank 5
---
yeah but your kinda fucking your team over if the plague gets the corrupt fountain when she is near someone or chasing someone near the fountain
---
There's a rant flair for a reason
---
Hopefully even out the roster
---
All they have to do really is make it so totems don't spawn in the middle of a god damn open field, or next to a gen.... You know, make them somewhat hidden at least.
---
imagine that im not complaining about any of these especially as both have been nerfed pretty hard but just saying that they both share the same goal. Reduce or increase time needed to end the game.
---
and then she will absorb the corruption from the fountain that you cleansed near her and down you even quicker because of corrupt purge rather than just being sick
---
I'm excited too!!
---
seems like you dont know how to loop
---
and i assume that people that cleanse just cant loop when injured.
---
your fucking your team over. stop doing this if you wanted to be liked by your team
---
ok fair enough not complaining. Still not comparable tho. And I would actually prefer instaheals to toolboxes btw (as a killer)
---
Sounds about enough time to find a match if you're a killer main
---
EDIT: nvm read that wrong lmao
---
#BUBBANDA
---
Aight I’m boutta head out
---
She her is absorbing corruption I can find a loop with high wall. This situation is about a survivor being better than the others on running the plague around
---
Perks will not get you to Rank 1. Game sense and the ability to run a killer will. I play no perks often and still grab double pip 28k games often enough. I offer coaching if you are interested!
---
Need an unranked mode. My friends hate playing with me now so SWF doesn't exist for me anymore.
---
Hopefully
---
That is unfortunate. It looked like he lagged back to the window as soon as you hit. I would be mad if that happened.
---
Man, you're slowing down a lotta bit with that set up. Only change is make is sloppy butcher for DL
---
Amandas secret and Tampered Timer and proceeding to put the trap on the most toxic survivor and then sit in front of one of the 2 boxes, giving them a 50:50 chance of life or death. Honestly really really funny to do and gets the occasional salt message but it is really damn satisfying thats for sure lol.
---
I don't think you know what humble means
---
Thank you random stranger!
---
I was being sarcastic if it wasn't obvious.
---
Ah, my bad
---
That's spooktacular!
---
its easier still to loop while injured since she becomes an M1 killer and not a killer that makes pallets and vaults almost unusable. plus what if she just decides not to go for you and find another teammate that isnt near high walls? congrats. you just fucked over your teammate.
---
I dunno about you but the Bye Bye man is my personal dream chapter.
---
Indeed, but what about someone with anixiety or a lot of paranoia? I mean if someone stalks your profile it gets really uncomfortable. Even a bit for me, i can shake my hand and head over this. But next person can have really bad night over it.
---
oh so i guess I was lucky (?) something like THAT haven't happened to me before.
---
I had situations when I couldn't close the hatch because survivor had some kind of 'priority', but not that I close it and survivor still jumps in.
---
whats the point of using dying light and thanatophobia if you have a mori? eh, it's like playing against bots at that point
---
Just buffing the numbers would be fine
---
Doesn't feel like it. It feels like she'll phase, hit you, then almost immediately phase again.
---
No it’s being courteous/fair. Which is what I’m saying. I Want to do it to be courteous...but points.
---
I was bored
---
ye, probably Lucky :D I had ut multiple times, especially on lagging killers
---
The solutions are hardly band aid fixes though. Even if I make a new account, I'm going to end up double pipping more often than they single pip. Leading me to being a much higher rank than them anyways. I already described why the first solution was horrible.
---
I know
---
Foken dead 'art
---
Myc?
---
I just realized Kate didn’t have a finger
---
Very cool
---
How so?
---
GIVE ME THE GAUNTLET OR GIVE ME DEATH
---
I legit said I thought it’s just for console so why bring up PC ?
---
well either have 1 person suffer (killer)
---
or make you're friends hate you
---
pick you're poison and i know you will pick option 1
---
unranked mode has been requested since launch it's now 3 years later.
---
yes thye are band aids but take em or sucks for you, you get nothing
---
Sure thing
---
Ah i felt fine, actuly had a good laugh, but point is, someone who is mentaly worse on their condition, could make some stupid stuff after thing like these. This is what i want, for ppl to not take it to a personal space, because next person can take it waaaay worse then i do. And it can make some harm even. Harasing is not okay in any shape or form. 
---
I am okay with arguing trough Steam chat or post game chat, i am adding all people before i figure out they are just bots and say hi just in case. But if you want to take it this route, you have some serious issues and could ruin a day, week or a life. And its messed up, this is still easy way compared how some survivors can be toxic.
---
home alone
---
No? Its the daily challenges
---
[deleted]
---
All I need is Franklin's
---
Some killers don’t care about points, once you unlock every perk there’s no point in bp till the next dlc drops
---
Yeah, on his channel in the comment section. If they add it, this will be revolutionary and finally something new and community-made
---
he's good
---
Hey, sometimes after a good match or just a fun match you gotta tell someone. I love it and GGs on that match. Especially letting one escape. Good on ya and have a good one!
---
I was like..... wot o.o lol.. but its okay lol
---
Lol im fuckin brutal on new survs. I'm just like may the entity have mercy on your soul \*slashes\*
---
Pro tip: don’t t-bag at the exit gate
---
Between consoles would be cool but i think it would probably best to not include PC.
---
It's allowed to be both. Crutches are meant for people who can't do something normally, and while people *can* play Nurse without Plaid Flannel the addon makes her completely brain-dead to play.
---
An then they say that ur bad pls uninstall
---
dont prestige, just keep leveling at 50
---
Do people not realise Dedicated servers aren't out yet?
---
Do you have a problem with the way I handled the situation?
---
Stop rage quitting games. It’s not okay when survivors do it and it’s not cool when killers do it either.
---
I think, now that people are used to her, her phase sound should be directional. Prayer Beads could then be reworked to make it non-directional.
---
What does teabag mean
---
All Ghostfaces know this feeling of catching more than one survivor and you're far enough away they can't hear your robe, but close enough to end a chase quick.
---
Different settings, increased fps, m&amp;k.
---
Das pretty cool but the miss-aligning on the axe is bothering me
---
Fuck those Dumbshits
---
Good killer.
---
I was playing survivor with my husband and my husband mentioned a teammate kept running the killer to him. Then later on that same guy ran killer to me working on a gen and I died. The survivor was rank 8, I assume he got to 8 by selling out teammates the whole way. He had perk to let him see us too. I asked him why he did it and he said he was on his last hook, SO WAS I! Grr.
---
WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY RIGHT BACK TO THE KILLER WHEN I GOT YOU OFF HOOK WITH WE'LL MAKE IT I WAS GONNA HEAL YOU KATE FFS
---
then wait for the 13th as rank reset is that day
---
ah yes, thanks for adding the spoiler
---
It was my second game trough my 100 hours i quit ... It was rather the controller issue then actual rage quit.
---
A mori shaves off 2/3rds of one of four of the killers objectives. There is no offering even remotely similar to that on the survivors side. And thats for a single green mori, a pink mori shaves off 2/3rds of ALL killer objectives. This is aside from the snowballing impact of killing a survivor reducing the total generator pressure survivors can put out.
---
You know perfectly well that only low ranked Killers would play Unranked, any high ranked players would consider it a waste of addons and likely BP as BP rewards would be lowered in an unranked mode.
---
There are, iirc 4 or 5 pips per rank. Play well and you can earn 1-2 pips from a single match. Earn enough pips in a given rank and your rank will improve.
---
De-pipping is losing a pip, you can only lose a max of 1 pip per match. Losing all the pips in a given rank will re-rank you.
---
Yes they are on PC
---
You get both bloodpoints and emblem points for moris, it doesnt really hurt the killer.
---
I agree with the first two but Mouse and keyboard doesn't do much for survivors on console. And it's not like killers are playing against other killers.
---
Thank you kind person
---
THIS IS SO CUTE
---
Beans
---
Not really
---
well to be fair.  Bond doesn't show which teammate the aura belongs too.  So it's really not a bad play if he's on last hook.
---
So it's like any other game with unranked modes?
---
FIX SURVIVOR HITBOXES TIRED OF HUNTRESS HATCHETS HITTING WHEN THEY CLEARLY DONT AND BILLY CHAINSAWS ROUND FUCKING CORNERS
---
NOED IS NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME. Lol. And I know, it's just that sometimes a feel Infa t3 Myers is well inevitable, to put it least. And of course if I absolutely wanted to I could've waited to get bamboozle and fired up so I could do vault master God myers. But yeah I know perks and stuff aren't toxic, it just feels that way. Also I also think I failed to mention I was rank 12. So I wasnt doing this to rank 20s and everyone was in my tier (for once).
---
Hm, I don't remember that scene.
---
Why is kate so low?
---
She feels like a training wheels survivor to me. Like good for new players, good against noob killers.
---
Can you send me an explanation!? :)
---
I hate so much that bastard, dud suicide or the killer is going to have a 4k
---
Currently testing on PC.
---
Wow he slaughtered those baby survivors. Always be suspicious of killers acting weird like that.
---
Finding totems is only hard on like three maps. Even worse if you're playing a killer who can't defend your possessions. I'm that asshole who finds ruin in the first minute. 😹
---
That is why I didn’t mention PC :)
---
Mindgame? What mindgames? The 50/50 where you'll have to guess if she's phasing or not? That's hardly a mindgame. Other than that just use your ears/eyes and bump into survivors, easy 4k.
---
How?
---
Yeah here perks are pretty shitty but she is *HOT*
---
Ü
---
When you do it for DS you just wait a minute. Not knock and let someone get them up. 
---
At least I don’t when I’m killer.
---
FPS, sensitivity settings mouse and PC nurse ;)
---
Spam the crouch button. Imagine someone under you and you are slamming your nuts into their face
---
daily rituals
---
Yes servers are currently active. Every match you play is on servers.
---
Isn't mikey a child in this scene?
---
smol child myers skin when?
---
Yikes imagine using that build and being upset about anything the survivors do
---
I appreciate those of you who came back with constructive criticism on what to do. I'll change the way I play and see what works. I re-read my post and really didn't get my point across to the extent I wanted, and that's my fault. But for those of you who were assholes in the comments, you're the reason the game is not fun to play. This is literally the most toxic community I'm apart of and that's saying something. Even Overwatch isn't this bad. Lol. I didn't deserve to be called a mouth breather, or stupid. Was just ranting about a night filled with killers who were making the game not fun for others to play on purpose. I guess that means I get railroaded for having an issue with a game that encourages being toxic. Oh well, life moves on. GLHF.
---
*screaming mixed with thwacks*
---
dwight higher than laurie?
---
Better gen completion and teamwork potential
---
No he was previously body blocking his team mates why the heck did you jump to this
---
Oh sorry my bad. That was a joke regarding the first comment. I see how that could be confusing sorry.
---
Okay I'm gonna get so much hate but I don't like ash's voice lines. Don't get me wrong it's awesome that he does have voice lines but they're just so out of place
---
Isn’t the point of dedicated servers that none of the players host them?
---
He was body blocking his team mates prior to this, that’s why I said previously. I’m sure you wouldn’t enjoy being body blocked and would like to see the killer pull something like this off on the blocker
---
Can you send to me as well?
---
Yeah I’d be upset to be fair. Still looks pretty cool
---
You're right I'll correct that ;)
---
The killers objective is to hook survivors, there are 4 survivors that each need to be hooked 3 times = 12 hooks total 
---
Moris require only 4 hooks which literally eliminates *75%* of the hooks needed.
---
That's equivalent to if a key worked the moment one gen in complete
---
there is typically still matchmaking in unranked mode in most games, it's just hidden.
---
I’m mean we could do it that way 🤔
---
I'm buying one of these :P
---
He was bodyblocking team mates earlier. I’m sorry my build offends you
---
Nooo?
---
Yep me too at rank 5
---
Are you utilizing  the categories?
---
No.  Not at all.  Dedicated servers for games have been around since the beginning of time.  People with capable hardware and connection can host them and use them as their own.  There is also a LAN play component thats been in most games' dedicated servers.
---
I've hosted plenty of servers over the years, from every source and unreal engine game, dayz, rust,  and currently host minecraft, and killing floor 2.
---
What do you mean by categories?
---
As in servers I can host myself?
---
She THICC
---
Can someone host their own is the main question.
---
Dedicated servers doesn't mean you can host them yourself. It means the game developer is hosting the servers instead of whoever is playing the killer.
---
Then you havent seen much of reddit, ignorance is bliss
---
They are the same pictures
---
What I do is keep cleansing it so when they get injured it's already started, but last weekend a guy got hit and he instahealed right as I cleansed HG and then got downed.
---
I wasn't that sorry though.
---
Dedicated servers are being tested on PC live.
---
Wait they are on PC? When was this said?
---
edit: nvm I just seen it on the forums, didn't know they sai that in the new patch
---
You're having the wrong mind set, running perks isn't toxic or bullying the killer.(DS is on the killers side, if they go after the hooked person they get hit, simple fix dont go after the person who was just hooked) I play both sides at red ranks and if its a perkless player they're easier to down and ruin the fun in chasing.
---
Buffy the vampire slayer
---
Haha I feel you and yeah noed is a slap right in the dick when you’ve gotten gens done and on your way out and bam you down. Lol but I usually think back and be like well fuck I know I passed atleast two bones. So I deserved it. Noed, if everyone would get on the same page and do every totem they see, would become useless. Then again it does suck when this doesn’t happen, but it’s just part of the game you can’t win them all. No one is that good perks, toxicity, etc or no you will eventually lose.
---
then the survs say ur bad pls uninstall
---
I know what a dedicated server is.
---
But you've not answered the question.  Can I or can I not host them myself?
---
The little nod the nurse does really gets me
---
You were definitely bragging about how nice you are to survivors.  It’s not the worst brag in the world and it’s cool if you legitimately play that way with moris, but it’s still a brag.
---
kinda sounds like you arent ready to be in red ranks? there are 4 ranking catagories, after your next game, hover over your emblems and it'll tell you the requirements for each.
---
How does one get survivor cosmetics on killer? I wanna experiment with shirtless David mix Myers. Hopefully give you bastards the shirtless Myers y'all deserve
---
Best maps for the shape?
---
Anyone would do anything for The Hair
---
Nothing I love more than a nice sweaty red rank swf’s
---
Whip on iridescent heads or trappers basement and be done with em, the response is fucking hilarious
---
If you read the perks I listed sequentially, you will notice why I put them in that order.
---
still takes ages to find a game as a killer.
---
Dont think they plan to do dedicated servers in that method since they control the match making.
---
&gt;Wraith
---
&gt;Survivors not expecting NOED
---
It doesn’t help that even though I’m not red ranks I play console so the game automatically throws me in lobby’s with red ranks so there is no point of me staying a purple rank
---
Sorry guys I should’ve been more specific. Previous to this clip the Bill was bodyblocking his team mates. I let the team mates get away of course, in those instances where he was doing that. There was nothing toxic about him healing. I worded it a bit funny.
---
Looks like a normal game to me LOL
---
No, he is a big boi in this one. He did dress up as a clown when he was a kid tho.
---
Currently prestiging Claudette because she was the first person I started playing with so it’s got to be her
---
Thanks for the answer!  Appreciate it.
---
is that switch UI?
---
doesnt change the fact that you probably wont be able to rank up there until you learn the game better.
---
I wanna fuck that forehead vagina
---
Meh, it works
---
It happens to me every time I trash one :/
---
Not only that but they're usually survivor ones, that run into killer ones- which is super annoying because I don't really play killer :(
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dcr3cj/but_why_do_all_leather_faces_have_a_bad_ping/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
People really don't care about spoiling these leaks it's annoying.
---
Some survivors actually worth prestiging.
---
people were hosting there own, thats how this game worked before the introduction of the new servers.
---
But it would be good if they did, because I know they wont have servers in all locations.  Namely for those players in  South Africa and Australia, It would be an great option to have.
---
I play nea with the bright pink hair and yes I can't hide as well as I did without it. But I will become better at loops because I can't just hide in a bush anymore.
---
Not really related here. This person didnt seem aware that they could keep leveling at 50, and were prestiging to try to find perks.
---
Which perks are you using?
---
Getting camped when the door is open is fair, I'm surprised we don't have a term for it by now, because imo camped is so negative and this isn't a negative play, it's a fair play.
---
Especially when all 4 survivors are alive!
---
No, it's just an observation. Recruiters seem to be old-fashioned about things like these.
---
I like your tattoo by the way, don't get me wrong :)
---
Of course!
---
Have you tried rural Texas internet? It was even worse in the 70s!
---
BBQ, Enduring, Ruin sometimes remember me, and noed
---
Whats the update?
---
Damn Jane hit that slow vault on the garage.
---
Trust me man, you don't wanna get to red ranks. 
---
It's just a huge sweatfest from both sides and isn't fun in the slightest. 
---
But if you reallly wanna get to red ranks, you need to start bringing more powerful add on's/perks. I don't know what you run on Freddy, but a good build for him is Ruin, BBQ, STBFL, and Pop. Swing chains is a good add on, along with Jump Rope to really slow the game down. 
---
If you're still having trouble, then try some stronger killers like Spirit or Billy.
---
Shame I’m from Australia
---
I'm a barista, and my manager is covered in em, so I'm pretty safe :)
---
Indiana jones: Raider of the lost ark
---
I thought they were talking about the rank 20 who only has one perk ngl
---
No you won't be able to host your own server
---
Not the same thing.  I know the difference between client side matchmaking and dedicated servers.
---
&gt;Imagine honestly thinking it's fair to match some rank 17 dude against a rank 2 spirit or nurse that's running an optimal loadout lmao. 
---
Then don't do it. The scenario described? It's self inflicted now. You're literally that stupid meme where the guy shoots a person sitting in a chair and then asks "WHO DID THIS?"
---
I do this almost every time and half the time the survivors can hear my steps and decided to stay by the pallet. :(
---
A new feature that will add cosmetics, lore, challenges and rewards
---
Im not entirely sure that you do, because the games youve listed off that let you make your own servers, are entirely different animals from this.
---
Sending now!
---
Why stbfl? But I get match up with nothing but red ranks anyways so I might as well try.
---
Yes on mobile mode. It's a lot smaller on docked mode
---
I mean if you don't want it to get spoiled don't go on the internet, it's even in thumbnails🤷‍♀️
---
We need more killers like that :D
---
Thank you. Everyone thinks DBD has the worst community ever and whoever says “ez” in chat needs to go to hell. I’ve seen far more “toxicity” in games like COD and Fortnite where there’s actual voice chat.
---
This is the quality content I came here for.
---
Fair enough. And trust me I'm not really bashing on Star Lord, I love Star Lord to death, but you gotta admit that that situation was kinda dumb.
---
It was in fact done before. I believe it was even before the DLC came out?
---
Props, baristas are the best people on Earth. Couldn't start the day without a good cup of coffee.
---
Oops, true. Guess it'd be a little less terrible if they'd take form of survivors (and their skins) who are in the match.
---
Good luck!
---
Me playing GF with Nurses Calling: *heavy breathing*
---
Don’t need to break chase with spirit, need to learn how to down quickly. Can’t get looped that hard if you know how to play her
---
Its honestly my favorite thing to do. Even if the rest escape and the last player is obviously trying to survive against me, i won’t try and ruin his fun by kicking him when he’s down. If he still hasn’t escaped yet and i know where hatch is, why not ya know?
---
Yaaaaaaaaas :) the way people's faces light up when they get their coffee is amazing
---
I let a default Jake go and he was so thankful because he knew that not EVERYONE that played killer was a tryhard
---
It was dont worry
---
Well me too but that's becuase the description makes it sound like the speed it takes to escape from the killers grasp is increased.
---
But in reality it just very slightly increases the chance of the killer getting stuck on a tree for 3/4 of a second while carrying you
---
This is like bonehurtingjuice lmao
---
“Are you near this generator?”
---
“No.”
---
I need Medieval Ash in my life
---
you do have a brain in that thick fucking killer main skull of yours? oooooh, look at me, i can't think of anything to say so i'm gonna copy your message and replace two words, i have more than 3 braincells
---
I've actually gotten to the point of laughing at saltiness from survivors. I have learned that there is always one or two people in every game that expect you to play the game how they want you to play the game. Tough luck for them because I play how I want. 
---
The funny part of it is that no matter how you play the game, you will be called trash. As killer I never intend to tunnel or camp. However, there are times where I would be stupid not to. If a survivor wants to unhook another survivor right next to me and the injured survivor is closer, I'm going to down them again. I will hit the closest survivor no matter who it is. This will often get called tunneling because people get sooo angry. They expect you to ignore them and detour on to someone else. How about no? 
---
Also, they get REALLY mad if you camp hook after gates are opened. Their buddies often think they are incredibly smart by trying to taunt you into chasing them while another survivor goes for the unhook. Not going to work, im not stupid and I know why you are 20 meters away teabagging me and trying to taunt me into a chase that I get nothing out of.
---
I always laugh at the comments post game. That makes them even more angry which makes me laugh more. What they dont realize is their shitty behavior makes me enjoy trolling them much more. They do it to themselves. All they have to do is escape and be respectful.
---
The only times I intentionally tunnel is when a cocky survivor teabags me pretty early on or flashlights the shit out of me whether its clicking or blinding me at multiple pallet breaks. If they want the attention so bad, I oblige  and put them down quickly and they still get salty.
---
I mostly play survivor btw and I dont act like these people. I play the game and understand the killer is trying to kill me so I better not get caught. I know tunneling is controversial but at the end of the day, I understand most killers aren't intending to do it, they are just playing the game.
---
she be looking kinda thicc tho
---
It really depends on how much range and how slowed down the charge is, it could even out to just being a normal nurse blink with faster blink speed and more range or it could be a bit slower or a bit faster than normal. I still think either way they need to change the way range works to not effect blink speed and need to add charge time to all range addons to even it with base nurse
---
No you didn’t
---
4 man SWFs only consist of like 5% of the survivor playerbase and only have a 8% higher survival rate
---
I run Ruin, Make your choice, BBQ, Surveillance. Could swap bbq for nurses and make your choice for discordance. So basically with surveillance I know when they’re on gens, can get a grab if I run prayer beads. Other than that it’s all just getting better at chases,. Learn her mind games and get better at tracking. Perks like strider can help you hear them. But watch out for all signals like crows, grass moving etc
---
It’s not that huge, it’s 15 seconds. Less if you don’t use the full power meter, and any half-decent Spirit player knows that her power is best used in short bursts.
---
They enabled dedicated server for testing I guess
---
Dedicated servers so ya
---
If you're looking at anything related to dbd when you know there's an event coming out, common sense there's going to be spoilers. If you didn't know about it then sorry
---
I caught an exposed 3 people at once and downed all them by slugging them. Definitely the biggest orgasm of my life.
---
It always comes up mid shimmy for me. I have the worse luck
---
Do lemme see if I got this right. 
---
You messaged someone telling them they deserve all the toxic killers in the world and now ur saying toxic killers are Surviviors fault?
---
Gonna struggle than, best of luck. They aren’t as good as people once thought
---
Try playing as hag, easiest killer to rank up on console TBH
---
Ermm, when did this game happen?
---
As a Bubba main, I salute you
---
Nope lol
---
The killer has no way of knowing they arent his rank just fyi
---
I main Myers and Ghost Face... yeah, I totally let the last person go on purpose. It's intentional everytime.
---
They’d have to get Bruce Campbell to do the voicing again, and it’s too much effort to do just for one voiceline that would only be used for less than a month each year.
---
killer isnt the host anymore, so if they leave, the people in the lobby no longer get pooted.
---
*MUNCH, MUFFLED SCREAMING, SNAP, CRACKLE, POP*
---
...
---
#REEEEE
---
Every time my dad tries to interrupt I'm just like "nope. You'll wait or whatever you need me to do I'm not doing."
---
 Not really needed. Hooks never used to come back, so they’ve set 3:00 on everything. Which is reasonable
---
So can legion and/or nurse, yes. But spirit cant see survivors so if she goes the wrong way she suffers from that.
---
It's fine I already got spoiled by someone else. The main issue is that, I didn't expect a patch to come out with brand new content. There had been no news about hallowed blight from bhvr officially. So to go on the subreddit the other day and just see the entire event without even an official reveal just ruins the hype.
---
It's not common sense when there are no official reveals.
---
it objectively is. I'm not a big fan of it myself, but it very much is.
---
I mean I’m good at phasewalking it’s just loops like the basement with the two stairs in Myers map, some structures in the corn maps, the school in Freddy’s map. They can run me around for ages there
---
No I didn't, I love Tru3 and he is the only one who ever wants actual balance in this game.
---
And when the opinion is wrong, hard to sympathise.
---
I don't think it will - it says it increases maximum charge time, so I think it will charge at the same rate as base Nurse but you can charge past the usual maximum for more range.
---
doo doo servurs r beeng impwented pwease be paychant OwO
---
As her, not as survivors.
---
Please cross progression for the Switch/all platforms. It’s the only way I’d buy the switch version.
---
There she be :D
---
Everyone knows that the "A" tier is for "Ace" tier.
---
You know the frame rate is bad when your having difficulty tracking people on console, I remembered my friend in Florida not being able to see any of us move in real time during a custom game.
---
Doesn’t work in R6, casual, unranked, and ranked is all toxic
---
Ugh pigs the worst for me to go against, everytime pig is killer and i get a trap, i got through 3 boxes and nothing,  by 4th box im dead, OR pig gets me again as im at the first box..
---
I cant play against her, or Doctor.
---
And they exaggerated that overcharge thing lol I play on ps4 and hit great skillchecks on more than half of them. It just takes some getting used to. Now overcharge on a doctor with huntress lullaby is still pretty intense, but I feel like it's kinda hard on PC too
---
Crossplay typically involves PC also, before sony finally allowed it on Fortnite (Think of that like step one), a selling point of getting an Xbox One were the "crossplay" features with PC.
---
Make your choice
---
IT MUST BE PURIFIED!
---
If a survivor brings a key to try and shit on me, thaaaaaats a moriiiiiiiiiiiiii!
---
I have to disagree here. I hit great skillchecks on ps4 consistently. Just takes more practice than PC I think. But those streamers also have 1000s of hours most of the time, so like i said it's just practice really.
---
Yeah i have no problem hitting skill checks, and even when i run Max terror radius doctor with Overwhelming presence i still only hear a skill check failure maybe 5-6 times a game.
---
So you're the friendly tall guy with a mask?
---
Really makes me regret running We’ll Make It sometimes...
---
Shameless plug I guess...I stream on twitch as gzmo12 and I've been actively fighting against toxicity as a killer main! If someone plays well I call it out! If they act like an ass we excuse it. Fixing the playerbase starts with one person
---
Lol at red ranks this build is one of the best brute force builds for almost any killer.
---
thank I always get fps drops on that map
---
Since killer ping still dictates a good match, BHVR still wants to avoid splitting the playerbase to help get low ping AND aligning ranks. With dedicated servers low ping killers get punished and they don't have to match ping/location as strongly. I feel like they have a better chance splitting the playerbase once dedicated servers come up.
---
I generally play both sides but I've just stopped caring what either side thinks and just play the game for the enjoyment of it. 
---
Even if that means sometimes I go in as a killer one day and just bring a mori just because I've got some and no reason not to use them  
---
If you run into a killer with a mori just shrug it off and try and at least get as many BP as you can before you get caught. They're not a instant win after all (I admit they do speed up the win condition), plenty of games end up with good players buying enough time for the objective to get done. 
---
Once I stopped listening to the complaints and trying to find a work around to not be "Cheap" or "Toxic" I found myself having better games overall and have been climbing the ranks.   
---
You can take the most worthless addons or perk and you will eventually run into someone on both sides that will complain because that perk wasn't what they expected when they lose. 
---
Hope OP.
---
They only activated it on pc
---
Running two toolboxes and two flashlights is not toxic. Imagine saying that using items that were put in the game for a reason is toxic.
---
Looooove the tattoo &lt;33333
---
Its not about scoring points. Its about sending a message.
---
It only took them the entire fucking lifespan of the console...
---
I don’t really care about t bagging at the gate as long as they let me hit them.  I’m a friendly killer who lets most people go.  It’s the worst when you hook someone twice, have them dead to rights, let them go...and then they’re furiously bagging at the gate and juke your long distance hatchets.  Then they wait for you to approach the gate and run out when you’re 2 steps away.
---
HOW IS STEVE ANYTHING LOWER THAN AN A
---
Yes it counts
---
Well if they do it like fortnite you have to play with a console player to get paired with them so you wouldn’t have that issue. And they could always just exclude pc from crossplay if they felt that was the right way to do it.
---
If I have an ebony mori I just murder them when I can because I haven't had many yet and knowing me if I waited they would all escape somehow.
---
He's got a good perk and two meh perks
---
i like it but i very rarely get any use out of it because usually people realize i have it and not stay by the exit gate
---
Always a hollow threat. He doesn't get what he wants when he does that.
---
Which PC streamers play with controller?  I saw tofu play one match with controller and he went back to MKB mid match.
---
Well majority of killers specifically wait just close enough to the hook to where the survivors will actually save their teammate and then immediately go after the person who got unhooked and mori them at 5 gens left.
---
So it's not hard to understand why survivors get annoyed when killers bring moris and play like that.
---
Understandable. I revoke my first sentence.
---
I love pissing off the toxic swf by camping their buddies. They get so pissy and self righteous in the after chat.
---
Yeah this definitely depends on the situation. Especially if the last two people have a ton of gens left to do, there is no point in saving because then you’re just right back to square 1: the killer chases one of you, and the other has to do gens (and not get spotted themselves). It’s just a cycle and gives the killer more shots at a 4K. I always suicide on hook to give the other guy a shot at the hatch.
---
We don't deserve Batista. He's just a walking memelord
---
Of course, but there are many people who multiple console friends and I'll be damned if I was people like that in my games.
---
Maybe if they show which platform their on it'll alleviate some issues like I think fortnite and the new CoD does.
---
Edit: Either way I want to play against the best of the best at rank 1, not boosted shitters.
---
This reminds me of the batman comic in which Joker removed his own face.
---
Now this is epic
---
You are right about that one chief
---
I’d prefer Daryl and Michonne.  Glenn might be popular.  I think Merle would be bad ass.  Carl streams on twitch.  There’s a ton of survivor options.
---
both are completly fine....
---
What doesn't make sense to me is that I got adept trapper last night when I least expected it. It was only a 3k but the emblems were good enough I guess, but not any of the 3k/4ks I've gotten in the past.
---
In comparison to the other killers I was like: Oh, wait. That's.. it? They didn't even change her face that much? Or her outfit and censer?
---
I've seen it 3 times
---
Can’t imagine the eye would enjoy it
---
Not if you are on the other team.
---
Beautiful
---
It is joke
---
Ahahaha thanks :)
---
[Apparently ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dc5iq2/ps4s_crossplay_efforts_have_officially_moved_out/f26s44t/) PS5 is confirmed to play PS4 games.
---
👻👻
---
Easy, just designate the rank 1 as the main distraction
---
There is a reason everyone has DS in red ranks. Even if you aren't being tunneled, the killer has to slug you or eat the 5 second stun if he downs you during that minute. Because of this, a lot of survivors play aggressive after being unhooked because they know they are safe. (And then there's that stupid interaction with lockers...)
---
Lithe is definitely not the best. It's arguably the worst. Doesn't mean it's trash, just that it's the worst of the exhaustion perks.
---
No. Self-Care is bad. Almost every killer is either running Sloppy, Nurse's, or both. Never run self-care in red ranks.
---
Jeff's perks are memes. They aren't good. Distortion is his best perk but still isn't worth the perk slot, Breakdown is basically a worse DS, and his knock-off bond has a downside for some reason..
---
I think dedicated servers are up-ish right now.  Two games as killer last night I had a ping listed in the pre-game lobby and the survivors had no ping indicator.  One games as survivor, we had a lobby with the ability to talk even though the killer d/c'd.
---
It completely negates perks like decisive strike, flip flop, boil over, sabatour, etc, and doesnt allow for the survivors to react by body blocking the killer. I'd say it's somewhere in-between
---
It’s called counter-play, you can see them in the lobby for a reason. If you see a bunch of items then bring Franklins. If you don’t have Franklins then prioritize the people who have the toolboxes so gens don’t go too fast. Bring overwhelming presence so their toolboxes die faster. Bring a green Mori to take a player out the game. There’s counter-plays. 
---
You *can be* toxic with a flashlight sure, clicking and spamming it or whatever, but bringing one does not automatically you toxic. And a toolbox being toxic? Thomas had never heard such bullshit before. 
---
Some of the things you mentioned are indeed toxic, but this point in particular is just whining. It’s embarrassing, as a killer main, when some of you complain about every little thing being toxic just because it’s harder for you to win. Learn to counter-play and get over it.
---
Whoa, I’d love it! Please tell me how!
---
Only if you want it too, I usually laugh at it. But I see it so often its pretty forgettable.
---
Thats an F
---
spoken like a true skillless ''toxic'' baby survivor main
---
I find it cool aswell, I'm so happy they're giving my queen some love! But in comparison to the Spirit, Hag and Clowns cosmetic The Plague one's just seems.. dull.
---
Thé wounds healer achievement is bugged on ps4. Learned that the hard way
---
Good meme
---
DM coming
---
Hags is really cool too though. In only gonna get spirit and make since I dont have the other characters yet.
---
It's true. Anybody purple rank or higher that was deliberately going in with their low-rank friends was just looking for an easy game where they could bully the killer. Probably be cause they couldn't hack it with a full purple group and an at-rank killer.
---
Indeed!
---
If you knew my parents you'd understand. Trust me, my dad is the reason I'm an asshole to him and he acknowledges it.
---
Do you play on PC?
---
I wonder if he actually DC'd its looked like the Endgame Collapse got him but then it showed the disconnection icon.
---
thanks man
---
I think of it as offensive because i play fps games a lot, and on their communities its almost a war crime
---
Letter reduces by 3 to give you 1, annotated plan increases jigsaw BOXES by 1. The item you want to use is Last Will which increases RBTs by 1
---
get fucked lol baby killers complaining theres lag lmao
---
You think people are going to agree with you on this man but you’re completely fucking wrong lol.  Out of all the things labeled as toxic in the game using items is toxic now okay.  First of all.  Flashlights are very easily avoidable/baitable if you’re having trouble with flashlight saves, and if they’re flashing you at pallets etc just look down before you break the pallet and make them waste some of the charge and then when you break it and they flash you just listen for their footsteps or crying and you can usually be right back on their trail.
---
PS3 played ps2 games, until the consoles started exploding or something to force recalls. So, while this does excite me, I'll wait with healthy skepticism.
---
Except for one teensy bit of information that you seem to have overlooked- Make Your Choice chases are short enough that I have time to down them, carry them to the hook, and hook them, all within a minute. I’m not going to give ANYONE a grace period once they’re unhooked. I’m going right back to applying that pressure. How is it tunneling if I kill the unhooker and then immediately go after the nearest survivor?
---
as long as it is only between consoles or we can opt-out if it is with pc as well
---
Have 1 survivor, 1 killer and one spectator. Lets say that you are the killer and your friend A is a survivor and friend B is a spectator. Now let A be ready and tell B that as soon as you ready up, to switch to killer right away and now you'll have 2 killers and one survivor:D
---
Nah. I feel that bumps hex totems to a higher level. Hex's should be random between middle of the map with an LED cleanse me sign above it or literally in Egypt
---
Since the chapter update SWF groups are now matched up based on the highest ranking member. It's no longer the average.
---
Looks pretty cool but I don’t play her and can’t remember the last time I faced her.
---
This reminds me of a game yesterday where I got flamed hard (as solo survivor) by another survivor becuase with 1 dead and 1 hooked when the gates were powered on I just left. The reason I left is I had a daily to escape with dwight, dont have any good perks on him (he is only level 40) and did not feel like risking the killer having NOED while I go for a save and then I would have to play dwight for God knows how much longer.
---
I tried to explain it to him and apologized profusely but he kept insulting me and calling me selfish and proceeded to explain to me that it's a team game and I shouldnt be such a selfish asshole.
---
I was like dude don't take it so personally I was being selfish yeah so i could complete my daily and play killer.
---
Half her add ons are garbage and one of her powers is RNG, yes she needs a rework
---
Definitely still possible. Literally logged on 10 minutes ago to find that 12 hours I put in yesterday are gone. Not as severe as some of the horror stories I see online, but I'm new to the game and this is incredibly unnerving. Not sure what to do, how to prevent it in the future, and very demotivated to play to say the least. Submitted a ticket and praying I can get all the bloodpoints I lost back
---
Woohoo! Good Game!
---
Without 4 survivors, you don't have a game either. What are you even saying?
---
Really a war crime, that's funny and very sad at the same time.   I don't pay much attention to those players, don't want to feed and reward them.  Sticks n stones
---
Yea that's fair. Just a bit concerned for the Switch players, I have a feeling they're going to have the lowest player base in a few months, so giving them abysmal queue times is just gonna make them quit.
---
My boy Quentin gets no love smh
---
Thanks dude!
---
Wraith flair checks out
---
You judge people way too easily. My GF is always around red purple ranks and I always stick around rank 15 because I dont play enough.
---
 I may play better than her anyway, but theres nothing I can do about my rank and sometimes we just want to play together. Just because theres uneven ranks doesnt mean they want to bully. People have friends
---
Oh shit I never seen a p3 nurse on console looks neat let alone barely seeing nurse in general. That's some real dedication tho Nurse is super hard to play on console.
---
Same happened here. And our experience before the change wasn’t that we were “stomping” low rank killers. The average selection typically gave us a rank 8-11 killer. I’m rank 4, my group is rank 13,16,19. 
---
My games were much more balanced before in my experience. But now with the update, my SWF group won’t play at all anymore because we get demolished - me included, every single game. 
---
So what’re my solutions? De-rank? How does that impact other games? If I just act like a potato to intentionally de rank to play worth my friends, then that ruins the experience of the other 3 survivors that I’m playing with and, as someone who also plays killer, the killers experience as well. And then what if I play solo after I de rank? Then we have the same problem as before where a rank “4” would be against low rank killers. The same concept applies as me “creating a new account” or “waiting until rank reset” 
---
While I think there were some that did abuse it, I also think that finding an average of the skill levels of all survivors make a much more balanced game.
---
Hells yea trapper gang FTW
---
Shows where you'll blink to
---
You're welcome and pls tell me if it works for you cause they brought Dedicated servers now and I don't know if this still works.
---
Idk man. Spirits face looks like hags. I honestly prefer clowns.
---
Me too plz
---
Y’all got any more of them pixels?
---
I’m on PS4 so dedicated servers shouldn’t be a problem
---
I actually don't lol. I mostly watch Umbra so I haven't taken the time to watch others.
---
That would be S I C K. Literally.
---
Can you tell me as well?
---
When is crossplatform happening?!
---
I was talking about a strategy that depends on the items, i dont care if a player uses a flashlight, a medkit, or even the weirder strategies like full toolboxes, now two toolboxes and two flashlights that the players use on a certain manner that just makes the game a no fun of the player are problematic to me.
---
Nice! Hatch cookies would be interesting too
---
Jesus all these survivor mains attacking you lol,
---
But yeah the connection is even now, he jumped first.
---
Its not impossible, but without Franklin its pretty damn close to it.
---
Quentin is a cutie what do you mean?! &gt;:(
---
Why would you bring a mori anyway?
---
Exactly! How come the other cosmetics make the other killers look completely different from there defaults and then you have Plague.. who looks.... the same
---
Yeah...ok
---
Can you send me the info as well when you can?
---
Mori would be only toxic if its the pink one, the other two arent nearly as toxic
---
Aww, baby kiwwa mad? UwU. No you fucking idiot. My friends literally don't want to play with me because they are green ranks while I am red ranks. 
---
BHVR can add an unranked so we can all play and have fun together. Literally every multiplayer game has some kind of casual mode where they throw any and all skill levels together but those modes aren't dead.
---
T h a n k
---
#SAVEBABYDWIGHTS
---
Mhmm. Yeah. Okay.
---
Yeah because you can 4k as a survivor right? Read what i wrote again :P
---
*I don’t know how to do it so it’s near impossible*
---
That...doesn't explain how there is no game without killers. The way you wrote your statement, you made it seem like the killer could essentially play the game with no survivors. That makes 0 sense.
---
I never said I care what perks they have, I'm just making the observation that the survivors that DC tend to be the ones using those perks. And maybe you'd rather have a proper chase, I would rather not get bullied by someone better than me, so I appreciate that they don't go balls to the walls against new players.
---
I also never said I get DSd frequently, in fact I mentioned in the post that I actively avoid re-hooking people immediately, I'd hate to get re-hooked after just being saved, so I try not to do it to them.
---
Awwww
---
That's what he's saying though...
---
Am I the only survivor that doesn’t complain about moris? 
---
In fact, everyone has different things that could possibly be considered annoying or unfun
---
But it’s all apart of the game you play and you know the risk... just move on to the next one.  This includes killers as well
---
More like Meg Dolezal she’s living it these days
---
I havent had fuckin coffee yet
---
Is this perk based? If so, nea and laurie are very much above claudette jeff and feng.
---
"The 50/50 where you have to guess if she's phasing or not" that's survivor side for me.
---
I JUST PLAYED AGAINST A FREDDY AND HE HIT ME THROUGH ALL, ALL 3 BTW, OF THE PALLETS I'VE THROWN DOWN ON HIM EVEN THOUGH I EVEN TRIED TO THROW IT EARLY, WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING. I'M ON THE VERGE OF CRYING AT THIS POINT-
---
Someone was asleep during Meme School
---
like i have said in the past if pennywise comes to the game my whole dbd career is fulfilled
---
Its easy to counter on paper, but not on practice, if you look up they stop, and when you look down again it starts all over again, also, you cant play the entire game looking up.
---
I thought at that point Scott was just trying to cash in. I didn't know it was popular. I barely saw its presence on YouTube unlike the rest of the games.
---
I have no words...
---
Sounds interesting but 140% movement speed is bananas imagine that with PWYF, 155% would be like a fucking jetplane
---
Thanks I hate it
---
THANK YOU, PEOPLE NEED TO GET IF YOU PISS PEOPLE OFF, IT’LL BITE YOU IN THE ASS!!!
---
Wish they would’ve disfigured her face and give her a creepy expression like all the other Halloween skins get, otherwise I like it
---
Thanks for the nightmares
---
I think the problem is you're taking my comment out context in a thread that you weren't a part of. However, I never insinuated that the killer could play the game without survivors. In fact, it was the complete opposite of that.
---
&gt;At the end of the day BHVR must cater to killers because without them, we don't have a game.
---
my local walmart is like crammed full of FNAF merch.
---
id rather play against a mori than huntress or myers
---
WE’RE JUST IGNORING HADDENFIELD NOW?!?!
---
O Kawaii Koto
---
she makes people black pip/depip a lot i think thats why
---
Or, this may be a wild idea, but your friends could just git gud? Become red ranks too?
---
This confused me as well when I was on my Switch, until I read about servers being enabled for Switch from the start
---
My Enemys totems are always in a mansion in Kairo trying to evade the sunlight at all cost
---
I won't get into your family life since I don't know anything about it, but at least you know how it may look like from an outside perspective
---
the best thing that has happened to me in dbd is getting all 4 survivors dying to the endgame collapse basically i was camping a survivor that was on the ground and all the survivors tried to be altrusistic and saved there teammate but the egc had other plans
---
Yep,  forced me to derank, which doesn't fix the problem. We need a casual mode
---
Quentin is easily in the S tier
---
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH EEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH BOOM"
---
Drop Pallet. Spirit stands still? Run to a different pallet. Never slow vault. Don't always sprint. Never stand still. Watch the spirit husk and if it turns at a sharp angle while phasing she is most likely.
---
But your no prep thing is bs. You should prep for every killer. As such, Iron Will can play everyone. Don't blame meta perks for you not being able to use other perks.
---
Gg ez
---
not sure why you got downvoted but this is a perfect description. when a killer lag switches, the survivors see their teammates and the killer stuck in the last action they performed as soon as the lag started, same goes for going in X direction.. (not saying this specific video is a lag switch, just an example)
---
Had a meg i started to heal with We'll Make It, she moved 2 feet and stopped, I started to heal again, she moved again 2 feet.  Started a last time, she moved again.  I left.  She gets hooked a second time and me and another play are there for the unhook.  She runs off again right to the killer and is death hooked.  Both times the killer was NOWHERE near us.  Of course when I check the end game lobby, she's a rank 17 in a rank 6 game.  She was running broken key with extended range and duration.  So yeah...
---
😂
---
"ahhhh...fuck! she's waited for me! I'm 100% sure she has Amanda's Letter"
---
You didn't explain anything. 
---
You literally said, 
---
&gt;The way you wrote your statement, you made it seem like the killer could essentially play the game with no survivors. 
---
Considering I was referring to SWF groups and how they specifically wreck havoc on killers and survivors, there is no way I was insinuating what you suggested. You're having a hard time with this.
---
Probably has been done before but it's still nice.
---
This is soooooo cute! I love it. Adorable. Jesus. Also, that mean little Jake in the background is hilarious.
---
i guess you have to decide what it is that you want. do you wanna have fun with friends and make the most of it or do you wanna win every game.
---
i deranked to get some slightly easier killers and we manage to have fun even though we dont escape much. when i group up with some high rank friends then i play to win. worst case we play kill your friends
---
I PLAY ON PC AND PS4...
---
PS4 WOULD NOT WORK, EITHER IT WOULDN'T LOAD THE GAME, FIND A MATCH OR WOULD FREEZE BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE MATCH, ALL WEEK, THEN SUDDENLY NEW DLC(ASH CLOTHING) LAUNCHES AND THE GAME WORKS AGAIN....RIGHT AFTER THE DAMN DOUBLE BLOOD POINTS ENDS!!! WTF!?!?!?!?!
---
Hello Second Wind?
---
Yeah he can be really damn good. Top 4 are Billy, Ghostface, Spirit, Freddy
---
they didnt start exploding, i have a friend who still has a backwards compatible ps3. There was no real reason for the change.
---
I do, but there are no distinct shitters in rank 1, there are people who aren't rank 1 material, but most are great, I know cause I solo quiet survivor and honestly rank 1s are far better than you'd imagine.
---
Imagine hearing the medic laugh every time you get shocked. I'd go insane IRL
---
I'm waiting on my second rank reset to drop me in the 17ish ranks. Had to hold off on all killer games to get it low enough.
---
Hell no being red rank sucks ass and I hate being where I am, it blows major chunks. I figure killers dodge all the time, so why can't survivors?
---
Quentin
---
That wasnt an answer. Majority of his comment is addressing his own point.
---
DBD is a competitive game, i don't give a shit if more competitive games exist or if someone wants to be all "well technically.." about it
---
that splits the already long queue times into longer queue times for both or one is a dead queue.
---
What I mean by no prep is no prep for Spirit. Go in as you would against any killer.
---
Stopped reading at 140% movement speed
---
Not one finger? No wonder shes salty after the clown took all of her fingers
---
I don't see how playing on console makes a difference in the meta? Do killers not run the best perks at red ranks?
---
You quoted the exact statement I was talking about, but yet take my own comment out of context. Amazing. You are the one having a hard time with this. You can't see why someone would take "BHVR must cater to killers because without them, we don't have a game" as what I just said to you. 
---
You are killing my brain cells and I have a flight to catch, so I'll just block you. Please, take a writing class sweet heart.
---
Really? I was told back then that it was recalled because inserting a ps2 disc fried some people's consoles. Guess it's just a case of "Fact check everything you hear."
---
Which explains why people play DBD casually instead of competitively
---
Well. Run Iron Will. Counters all top tier killers.
---
"Ugh what is that disgusting smell coming from the server room?"
---
"Its the pigmains having fun sir."
---
"God I can't stand that smell, MAKE IT GO AWAY!"
---
I usually just go with LOL
---
I doubt very highly there are any brain cells left to kill. gg
---
God remember a story from a long time ago. I got slugged in the end game trying to save someone but they got downed and then hooked. While I was slugged I managed to crawl my way to the hatch, and the person I tried to save gets sacrificed on hook. The Killer is miles away but they have BBQ. I should be able to at least take the hatch, right?
---
NOPE, CAUSE THIS FUCKING BITCH ASS CUNT-LICKER PUPPY KICKER CUTS-IN-FRONT-OF-YOU-AT-STARBUCKS-EVEN-THOUGH-YOU-ONLY-WANTED-A-SANDWICH MEG IS SITTING AT THE EXIT GATE TEABAGGING. TEABAGS UP UNTIL THE KILLER PICKS ME UP AND HOOKS ME AND KEEPS TEABAGGING UNTIL THE KILLER COMES TO GET HER TO FUCK OFF, JUST SO SHE CAN CLICK HER FLASHLIGHT AS WELL.
---
It's been awhile since I've thought about that match. This was before EGC was a thing so it was quite awhile ago.
---
I wonder if that Meg is doing well. Most trash would've been incinerated by now.
---
Trapper, he ain't even a survivor.
---
Lol nice one. You’re the one who picked a game about running for your life, being hung on meat hooks and murdered and then cries when it happens.
---
You’re asking for a way to kill the killer...99.9999% of games let you fight your opponent directly and you pick the one game where you can’t and then cry about it.
---
Yep. It’s me that’s dumb.
---
Hmmm something tells me you pulled those numbers out of your "Guestimation" case. When i play killer i almost never find a lobby without SWF. Mostly 3 player SWF but that's still stupid. I get that people want to play with their friends but i don't want to put up with that. The game wasn't made to be played with communication and it certainly wasn't designed for SWF. That's the reason some games are over in minutes. I would really appreciate if they brought in casual and ranked game modes... Casual for solo play and ranked for swf play...
---
Pig is a lame killer
---
I’m a 60/40 Surv to Killer player. I use each side to learn the other side.
---
Tell me more
---
oh, i read that wrong.
---
On console it's all about damage since the likes of Nurse and Huntress are complete ass. The most common perks on console are Ruin, BBQ, PGTW, Dying Light since the rework, Thrilling Tremors. Always gen perks and anti-loop perks. People use Insta Down killers a lot to accommodate for the lack of Nurse's potential. Anti-heal is rare and Decisive gets used maybe once per match
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
Demogorgon? Spraith?
---
Just a quick reminder: this is your own standards of what is toxic and what is not.
---
For the simple fact of how he is used in media and games these days. All of which prove he can be brilliantly incorporated in any game and get a great reception by the fans/buyers. Look at Assassin’s Creed Syndicate for example, and now look at the more recent game. Identity V( worked on in collaboration with the DBD devs themselves. No reason not to include him, he is remembered more of as a legend than for his murders. This is why I strongly believe he is the one and only legend to be exempt from that rule.
---
Megs
---
See you later, dumbass! Hope you learn to form coherent sentences one day!
---
I like agreeing with them. Was doing a michael mori ritual last night, and the survivors flew off the handle in the end game chat, told me i was trash, and that i never would have won without the mori. I agreed, told them Im not very good at michael, and asked for pointers. They didnt care for that.
---
You won’t hear me through your sobbing.
---
r/leaksbydaylight

Is that so? Explain
---
Sleepy boi :(
---
Nice list :) I disagree with some things but it’s just your list so who cares! Nice job, I always like seeing these. If you’re on PS4 we should SWF sometime
---
And hopefully you'll learn how to comprehend English.
---
I MOVED HOUSE TO LIVE WITH MY WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND AND IT'S FANTASTIC AND LOVELY AND A DREAM COME TRUE BUT ALSO WE DON'T HAVE INTERNET UNTIL THE 7TH AND I MISSED THE ENTIRE EVENT
---
Finally some *coughs* until dawn *coughs* original killer ideas
---
Conquest is the most toxic game mode, even in casual.  As you've witnessed, the conquest players in casual are usual the ones not good enough to play ranked but watch a lot of twitch so think they have it figured out.  I generally stick to arena and assault.
---
Gotta love those entitled survivors that think killers are op
---
I love it haha
---
Probably Jane, she's really loud and has mediocre perks.
---
She is top tier in other areas though. ;)
---
" Then the structure of the sentence is incorrect. "
---
He said planking AND tbaging. The structure is fine.
---
" Said by a dude in green ranks? "
---
Any time someone resorts to this it shows they have no idea what they are talking about. Theres a reason posts that say this on Summoner School get downvoted into oblivion.
---
And no its bad because you just take free damage on everyone that tries, and as I said TWO PERKS completely counter it. But please let me trade this hook for free damage on your entire team, easy slugfest. Or if I run either of the perks, easy slugfest, and I'm still able to hook.

Killers on Xbox seem to Run similar stuff to what I see rank 1 streamers like Tru3 using
---
I think pennywise is more likely
---
Probably because the switch version runs way worse than any others
---
With pleasure
---
Hmmm, if prolonging that for a couple more seconds will assuredly kill the hooked guy, I can see the appeal. And I'll certainly play time if I need the additional pressure and it basically gives me a hook on top of that (or well, '1 hook less to kill all').
---
Of course, sending now
---
Maybe a secret survivor drop during the event. MAYBE VIGO??
---
&gt;something tells me pulled those numbers out of your guestimation case
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests

Maybe the skins for Claudette and Dwight didn't sell as much as they hoped for after all the work creating them? 
---
I saw / see every killer skin featured on last years event being used (Wraith, Billy, Huntress, Trapper and Doctor not so much but you see them. 
---
I rarely saw people wearing Claudette and Dwight. Maybe one part here and there but the whole outfit?
---
What's his movement speed compared to a survivor? As a percentage
---
Oh I didn’t realize this was a child comment. Whoops
---
Nea has two great perks, Balanced is amazing and Urban Evasion is great for people who prefer a stealthy playstyle
---
SURVIVORS, PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW I AM TUNNELING WHEN I PUT YOUR DUMBASS ON THE HOOK, I WALK LITERALLY 10 FEET AWAY, AND SOMEONE TAKES YOU OFF THE HOOK. WELL NO SHIT I AM JUST GOING TO TURN AROUND, HIT YOU IN THE FACE, AND PUT YOU BACK ON. PLEASE TELL ME WHY I SHOULDNT TUNNEL IF ITS THE STRATEGY TO KILL ALL 4 OF YOU.
---
Looks like Mr Ochido now has to actually versus killers with more than two hours in the game
---
I certainly will!
---
Stop
---
*Exfuckingcuse me?*
---
Because the Killer Shack can be looped for a pretty long time
---
Of course! :)
---
&gt; Running 2 toolboxes and 2 flashlights because holy fuck if i see another team like that im snapping my own neck 
---
Wrong.
---
Sending
---
Its looks great, just loses its appeal when compared to the other 3 characters.  Spirit and clown look the best imo.
---
&gt;The video does say some of the concepts. Hopefully there will be more than just Jake.
---
Its possible but considering the banner only features Jake, I doubt. Granted last year's banner didn't even include survivors.
---
I don't like Dwight so much, but the Claudette outfit is one of my favourites in the game, just love it
---
&gt; He said planking AND tbaging. The structure is fine.
---
He listed 3 things, only one of which he supposedly took issue with. The wording is wrong.
---
&gt;Any time someone resorts to this it shows they have no idea what they are talking about. Theres a reason posts that say this on Summoner School get downvoted into oblivion.
---
I mean, It's true though. You're being completley ignorant and saying bodyblocking for other survs and/or windows to deny vaults is "Useless."
---
Really?
---
Feel free to prove me wrong about my assumption on your rank though.
---
&gt;But please let me trade this hook for free damage on your entire team, easy slugfest. 
---
So your just playing bad survs who don't know how to loop? Everyone knows Surv&gt;killer at high ranks.
---
-----
---
If you think bodyblocking is a bad strat, why you complaining about it?
---
Vigo will be a killer. Mark my words.
---
That’s good to know. My sister had an issue and lost all progress on her drive before so it makes me a little uneasy.
---
I was gonna main pig, now I main spirit 🤔😢
---
Red rank killers also run those. The top perks are Ruin, BBQ, PGTW, Dying Light, Thanatophobia (Killer Specific), Nurses, Sloppy, STBFL (Killer Specific). It's honestly gross how fast gens are being done again, and that all 4 perk slots has to be anti-gen
---
And what does that matter?   
---
It's a video game, they're not meant to be taken super seriously. 
---
You can play games and be bad with the shocker being you can still have fun :O   
---
It's not a career for everyone that has to be taken super seriously.
---
You should level up everyone to get all teachables to start. Then if you choose to prestige, best to do one at a time so your killers/survivors are not all missing perks, offerings, add ons, etc.
---
It doesn't add up though. The demogorgon is part of a hive mind. In order for demogorgon to be alive, he needs a connection with the mind flayer aka he needs a connection to the upside down. The portal has to be a real unless we throw out consistency in lore and throw in "the entity allows him to be". The game also states that demogorgon does traverse the upside down when using his portals, they aren't just tunnels, even though they do function like a tunnel.
---
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it , do it , do it, do it
---
The plague one isn't meant in a toxic way. That one is to break you while you are on the hook. It becomes a habit
---
Maybe not good for depression but actually (surprisingly) really helped me after a severe anxiety attack. It was like, as long as my heart *had a reason* to be beating furiously, then my body was at peace; and the skillchecks and technicalities helped me to focus.

It's EGC What is he supposed to do?

I’ll be honest. I’m a “survivor main” so I’m a bit bummed, but at the same time I understand Halloween being more about the killers. It would, however, be nice to have more earnable survivor cosmetics during another event like the Lunar New Year to balance it out a smidge.
---
I'm not built for the Reddit community. I get more downvotes than survivor tbags when they drag me through the mud. Even though I can grammer real hard.
---
I live in an RV park with a few hundred people and am very familiar with interactions at high Ping or poor connection. Definitely had my share of being accused of this lagswitching and I play on PS4 lol.

DBD is a survival game. You did nothing wrong by escaping. It's better to have one escape than all dead. I made this mistake too many times when I just starting, but I ended up dead as well.

But why? Who wants to wait forever to play a match?
---
it's actually more difficult on billy.  Using his chainsaw to down someone gives significantly less points than m1'ing them twice.  So you often don't meet the requirements even if you hook everyone 3 times.   I've hooked everyone 3 times in two games on him trying to get adept and not had enough points.
---
Mate it's a joke
---
I’ve never seen someone’s mental state absolutely collapse so quickly from having their opinion challenged. You’re one of a kind.
---
I had this one toxic swf that calling me a baby killer because I was playing my second game as the Huntress. I laughed it off because they were rank 16s "360"ing me on console even though I wanted a daily complete. I remember when I tunneled a Steve once I got upset because of how stupid it was getting while chasing him. But hey I realized it was a stupid thing to complain about
---
As a survivor, I greatly appreciate his style. It sucks getting killed in the first 5 minutes of a game because of unlucky start placement and mori. Especially because then I just have to sit and watch my friends play.
---
Not stop relying on loops and try to outsmart the killer. This isn't a racing game and we don't all want to run around in circles.
---
I want a Feng min Halloween cosmetic... I’d pay $20 for one
---
Let them flame you and just laugh about it lol the *How to Survive* handbook or whatever it is says you should either play as a team you play against the other survivors to ensure YOUR escape lol I love being altruistic and sacrificing myself so others can escape, but sometimes I LOVE bringing pebble and chucking it at my teammates cause it’s fucking hilarious hahaha even if I die after that, it just makes me giggle lol
---
" What perks are you refering to? Noed? Survs get notified of that btw incase you didn't know. "
---
Never made any mention or inference of noed, are you actually this dumb? You must be trolling if you aren't.
---
"
---
&gt;DO NOT put words in my mouth. I made no mention of Windows or said "Useless".
---
"Bodyblocking is annoying because IT ISN'T a good strat, and just ends up being annoying asf.""
---
Congrats you just proved your saying bullshit. Windows nor Useless is there. Saying something just ends up being annoying isn't "Useless".
---
" Nobody runs that at high ranks, lmao. "
---
"Your trash if you don't run only THE meta LMAO"
---
" Your saying taking a free hit makes you a free kill aka implying the survs cannot loop for shit. "
---
Because looping Spirit and Nurse is easy. Its not like everyone complains about fighting good Nurses and Spirits.
---
" Idk where you even get your info from, it's awful. "
---
Evidently its better than the person who thinks

if i'm on second hook, i'll sometimes just suicide so that I don't have to watch them leave me behind.
---
The problem is, nobody gets into a game their friends are playing without playing with them first, barring tutorials. He bought the game to play with them and there is no way to not be red rank so it doesn't matter unless you have 5 people and do a custom.
---
what typically happens during it?
---
I play fair, especially with spirit and so whilst I don't really care about the fun others have I ensure that if you don't play like a moron you'll get a good game.
---
Do we have a date for the event yet?
---
&gt;But why? Who wants to wait forever to play a match?
---
I certainly don't but hey, don't ask me. People rather not play for the sake of having a fairer matchmaking.
---
Yeah...who puts input delays on servers....other then fighting games....really this game can deal with the current systems the devs just need to fix certain hitboxes (side note alot of hits are because game is client side hitreg thats why alot of time on survivors side they wont be hit but cause of ping on killers end that weapon went right into your back)
---
Because matchmaking was being abused by SWF maybe not all of em but a lot of them did by having one rank 18 and getting a lower ranked killer even thoe they are rank 3 or so
---
FIX HITBOXES GODDAMIT!
---
It's a bit funny to hear it as an adept whore. I'll play games at rank 10-12 with adept builds (3 unique perks who at LVL 15 is normally 1 LVL 2 and the other 2 rank 1). Can be rough going when you have 0 exhaustion perks, but just the way she goes sometimes.
---
Unfortunately due to the nature of the game both killers and survivors practically can’t use just any perks if they want to consistently succeed. Which is why, in my opinion, I’d rate characters with amazing perks higher. BUT! If you were to play survivors only in an adept style. Then your list becomes more accurate. I’d actually put Nea and Feng higher up because as adept they’re pretty useful.
---
They broke matchmaking with the 3.2 update (Stranger Things release) so that groups were being matched based seemingly on the lowest ranked player as opposed to an average like it seemed to be using prior to the 3.2 update.  On top of that it was skewing even more towards rank 20.  So you could have a group with 2 red ranks, a green rank and then a yellow rank and there was a decent chance you'd go against a truly brand new killer with like 1 perk.  That went on for about a week and BHVR decided to swing from one shitty extreme to the other.  There is no good explanation whatsoever as to why they didn't just revert is back to the way it was before 3.2.
---
You never said/showed us he was body blocking so why are you getting so upset about people making assumptions? Lmao just say what he was doing instead of expecting us to mind read.
---
Edit: so apparently you did say that... an hour after I posted my comment.
---
I'll take longer queue times than the Bully With Friends shit that was happening prior.
---
DM me too pls :)
---
Coming your way!
---
I mean I have every teachable perk in the game so he really doesn't have many good perks at 40 besides bond and prove thyself obviously.
---
Themselves and their teammates*
---
So instead of One person having a bad time it’s 4
---
&gt; the devs just need to fix certain hitboxes (side note alot of hits are because game is client side hitreg thats why alot of time on survivors side they wont be hit but cause of ping on killers end that weapon went right into your back)
---
Why do you say "fix hitboxes" and in the same sentence explains that there isn't a lot of issues with them but ping? This is another level. 
---
You can't fix ping. Well, you can but you'd have to be playing on LAN.

&gt;I want a Feng min Halloween cosmetic... I’d pay $20 for one
---
I bet a Halloween skin for Nurse would sell tons considering the amount of people that play her on red ranks. Well, at least before the add-on rework.
---
huntress lullaby would be super strong if it wasn’t a hex.
---
Can we all agree that you don’t bring Moris during bloodhunts though
---
If they weren’t teabagging at the gate like a loser they would have been fine tho
---
I'm no red rank, but when I stop at a loop or jungle gym for a couple seconds survivors freak out and do stupid things,  I usually do that for them to leave the loop and hit, and use the power for the second hit, as it's easy to locate them from sound in that point (the amount of times people just come running to my arms it's insane, makes my day).
---
Eh, as long as you have good reflexes it shouldn't be a problem
---
Killer takes skill , survivor doesnt , it always has been that way.
---
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. CAN'T WE JUST USR THE COME WITH ME EMOTE SINCE IT ALMOST LOOKS LKLE TJSNK YOU I'M SKGM LANGUAGE?
---
What exactly are they changing about nurse? 
---
She would still be top tier powerful no? Because ignoring loops and such
---
This ^
---
Cheers m8
---
Jesus Christ stop ninja editing. You are actually a troll. Ninja editing post reply, not arguing the points, and just going "YOUR CLUELESS HURR DURR".
---
How about you grow some balls and actually discuss something instead of calling me clueless, bad and green rank.
---
Also I just said its annoying in response to your comment earlier. I woulda stopped talking ages ago if you didn't make these stupid arguments where you try and hand wave away what I said by going "Lol ur bad xd".
---
Edit: Also "not to be rude" Calling people shit and clueless IS rude.
---
You can buy skins with both Auric Cells and event currency.
---
There is a diffrence most people complaining about "hitboxes" are actually complaining about client side hit reg the hit boxes i was refering to is things like huntress hatchets hitting a wall despute the hatched itself didnt hit the wall
---
Haha this was me playing Spirit for the first time yesterday. Guess I should've waited until rank reset :(
---
Yes this....Piece of cake
---
I wish
---
I doubt it, but god that would make that skin legendary 
---
She looks like she’s spitting lava at your ass lol
---
Reaching rank 1 as survivor is just playing. There is little grind and almost no skill involved. 
---
As a survivor all you have to do is 2 solo gens with some totems for lightbringer, maybe even open a door. 2 or 3 safe unhooks and some healing on teammates. Not go down in 10s when engaging the killer. After this, even if you die you probably pip. 
---
The only way to NOT pip as a survivor is if you spend most of the time idling around the map.
---
Hes op.
---
It takes patience, skill and a lot of luck on both accounts.
---
If she pukes in the color of gold/yellow/ LAVA 
---
I would buy it ASAP
---
Nah he seems fairly balanced or at least on par with Demagorgon.
---
It's a lot of grinding but people who say there is no skill are crazy. More skill is required for killer but survivors do need some skill.
---

---
&gt; What exactly are they changing about nurse?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; She would still be top tier powerful no? Because ignoring loops and such
---
As far as we know they are just changing her add-ons. They only showed 2 or 3 so far. 
---
Base Nurse will continue to be just as strong (unless they haven't revealed yet) but we know a lot of people can't play her without extra range or extra blinks.
---
Oblivious for 10/15/100 seconds, moriable for 7 matches? Every negative status effect?
---
Pee pee poo poo man
---
Yes he is perfectly balanced and fair. He would be a great addition to the game!
---
they each a little bit of skill but not much at all. ik cause I was a rank 1 in both and ik I am not a very good killer just takes playtime and you will get to rank 1
---
Dont say his name
---
You ain't kidding. It's still fun, but holy shit I played a match as Huntress and she's sooooo bugged. 
---
That and the offerings screen is so blurry. How do you manage to make something so not taxing look that blurry?
---
Wait why are there four people?!
---
Congrats!  I'm working on thr same thing!  Up until Ghost Face released, I just leveled my Killers up to 40-42 for Teachables and for a try at some specific Perks for em to use.  Since Ghost Face released right before a Double BP Event &amp; I had stocked BP for his release, I decided to go ahead and jus boost him to 50 and work towards all Perks on him!
---
I don't care or intend to Prestige him, so,Im happy as is.  Only Killers Im gonna Prestige will be Michael Myers, Leatherface and maybe Freddy Krueger.
---
if they did add that they would prob make a way to opt-out for pc and I am sure a lot would
---
I think both roles take skill but killer definitely has more pressure and in my opinion, is a little more unforgiving to mistakes. I find making mistakes as survivor are easier to rally back from (usually). 
---
I think the Rank system is generally somewhat indicative of skill. However, I sort of see it more as a representation of playtime than skill. I’ve played against reds that weren’t all that great and I’ve played against some greens that were amazing so it’s not always an accurate representation. As you get into the higher ranks, it is harder to pip and I usually consider double pips actual skill once you hit red/purple.
---
Like when survivors try to steal your locker when the killer is by them? Does that count?
---
As killer I would play the shit out of that. Unless it didn’t get me bloodpoints...
---
Comedy
---
You can see ranks before you start no? No one is forcing you to invite rank 20's into your squad or to stick with them.
---
How else are survivors going to know you mean business? 
---
Sure, maybe they’ll get the hint with your play. And maybe they’ll get suspicious when they get hooked. And fine, maybe after a 4K and they see your red rank on the end game....but wouldn’t it just be easier to give up all those perks and millions of BP for some bloody clothes?
---
right, but as a survivor there has to be some sort of defense against the killer. I don't mind literally any other killer because they have counters. 
---
You can mindgame the shit out of nurses, any of the M1 killers, and buy time with B+ killers like hag or Myers. B+ killers always get 2k+ so I think the standard should be B+ level. 
---
If that means buffing legion, wraith, plague, pig, etc then so be it. But having mostly C level killers, a couple B's and A's and one S means people are going to choose spirit to get to the top, which just sucks going against every match. 
---
Sorry I'm just sick of spirit hahaha
---
Btw I 50/50 survivor and killer (gf and Myers)
---
Not gonna lie, I've never liked Whispers xD I tried it once and hated it.  As far as tracking goes I prefer BBQ, Nurses, Stridor and the rest.  I know peeps use it for a particular situation but EH, I've been fine without it and end up playing better without it than with it xD
---
Its still a competitive game. Not being as competitive as another game doesnt change that
---
whats the joke?
---
Dedicated servers coming soon™
---
To get the bloody mask, it makes Ghost Face harder to see from what I hear.
---
How dare you.. it’s Home Alone 2: Lost in New York
---
It should be opt in.  I’d rather Xbox players not be pulled into pc lobbies leaving our pool smaller.
---
I'm not sure honestly. I lost track after Disney acquired the rights to the franchise itself from Fox.
---
Yeah my friend showed me her
---
“Doctor-assisted homicide” my ass.
---
I like the Boil Over idea. Right now, it’s just sort of a meme perk and I only find it useful when I go SWF with a Sabo friend. 
---
I definitely think Territorial Imperative needs work as well. I don’t really think the range limitation or cool down is needed. Even so, if it worked every time someone went into the basement, I still don’t see it getting much use except in specific builds.
---
Hati as in white genocide not a slave revolt
---
Dash at the killer.
---
*THEY ARE THE SURVIVOR NOW*
---
Did you use headphones?
---
For some reason it looks for killers that are ranked higher than the highest ranked survivor.
---
I'm rank 2 rn and I keep getting groups where the highest ranked guy is like rank 6 while everyone else is double digits. It's pretty frustrating as nothing ever really happens in those matches, it's just stomps.
---
Detectives hunch
---
What is wrong with these?
---
Well then it could be less drastic ig. But hooks are everywhere now so it probably would only be bad if offerings were thrown out with it
---
Perks can certainly help but getting to red ranks definitely requires you to be conscious about your actions. Don’t focus entirely on any one action but rather do some gens, get some saves/heals, and learn to draw out chases with the killer. I honestly think your biggest skill to pipping will be maintaining long chases that the killer gives up on.
---
That being said, my red rank build for survivor is Bond, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, and Unbreakable. These are all fairly self-explanatory probably but I love Unbreakable. Even if I never get a self-pick-up from it, the increased recovery speed is a great boost, especially if you’re in the final 2 survivors. Most killers will slug for 4K. Alternatively, you can run DS with Unbreakable to essentially guarantee use of one of them.
---
I think you’re making too many assumptions for this argument to hold any water. Ie how addons and bp would work in a new mode
---
well, the presumption would be that, despite higher ranks and lower ranks averaging out with the killer's rank (which is still relatively balanced) along with hidden ranks, people won't be inclined to be as sweaty with op items/addons etc. There could even be restrictions of such things, which I think would be best. No pink addons or items, no purple offerings, and maybe tier down certain perks.
---
they don’t with me aaaaa they just go and find another loop
---
I want it to start as off with the option to turn on.   Minor but important difference.
---
I’d rather it just be console crossplay, but it will likely not be a big difference as long as it isn’t forced pc/console.
---
What? I mean the developers are ignorant, I don't need these skins. I would be much happier if they would only work on bug fixes and balance improvements
---
It doesn’t offend me it just means you aren’t very good at chases. You need 2 strong slowdown perks and 2 strong slowdown addons to allow you to win.
---
I'm just here to murder people, after game in post dead people don't bother me so much I just queue up to murder some more :D
---
ah ok I misunderstood lol ya I see that ik first thing I would do is turn it off honestly as I have no interest in playing with pc users
---
[Nico, it's your cousin!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxMLVlspD1Y)
---
You might have a point there but I don't think high rank survivors care so much about that. They're just used to it. The same way they keep Gen rushing with ruin. They got used to it and they overcome it. Of course its intimidating a p3 killer but that's it. Nothing really effective on your actual game. Survivors p3 on the other hand can really benefit from it because they become much harder to see.
---
Or Clown Bottles and Freddy's Snares.
---
Or you can buy the red mask instead for 10 euros lol
---
And this is why I always show mercy to the last survivor if I kill their friends
---
Reminds me of an old adage.
---
'never argue with an idiot, they will bring you to their level and beat you with experience.'
---
Always appreciate your responses. Thank you. Even though I'm on console and try not to use any add-ons when I play Nurse, I look forward to trying out some of the new ones, especially the one that allows you to return to your original position.
---
Extremely overpowered?????
---
Why not both?
---
ya got me there
---
You can totally -1 pip in red ranks if the killer can't get people hooked...even if you escape.
---
And to this day it is true lol
---
and this is... kids, the best way to get ez karma
---
What is the perk with Jigsaw’s puppet Billy? I can’t think of any perks he is an icon for.
---
funi.
---
Best mom looking thick.
---
How can you spend more than enough to get BBQ on leather face? Lol
---
Fixated. Because u move faster. But if u want to be stealthy, pick evasion.
---
I don't wanna play purp and red really, its way too toxic. I wish there was unranked, so I could goof off and just bingbong without worry of going against a team of rank 4 SWFs carrying flashlights DS and Adrenaline tbagging every pallet.
---
I miss the grey and brown rank fun.
---
Isn't that chainsaw 3d
---
yeah, that's the difficulty of having such a divided community and also such a small one.
---
lol what
---
Stupid ha- I mean yeah I let them go through the hatch purposefully as well.
---
It was more of a rhetorical question since I answered it in the text
---
The devs clearly the care about the Plague. Her DLC was the least sold DLC in the entire game.
---
Requires a tiny bit of skill, nothing too crazy. Once you learn all the tricks it becomes a joke, also if you use things like instaheal, map offerings, ebony mori, green mori or pink addons..it's super easy
---
Personally I think both perks are great for new players. Especially Fixated. As an experienced player, I have no use for either of them. Lightweight is much better perk.
---
Urban evasion makes your crouch speed equal to your walking speed, fixated increases your walking speed, they don’t stack so fixated would be faster than urban
---
It kinda make sense. Kill 1 survivor is like block them and give to killer and e.t.c
---
Fixated. You move 15% faster while uninhured and walking.
---
Even then a balance change would either make it broken or useless, like poor MoM
---
If it’s anything like the hallowed blight event from last year, it will release some kickass skins that can be earned through the game (last year you could earn two full three-piece skins). You earn them as killer by hooking survivors on “event hooks” and survivors cleanse event wart things (think of like cleaning a totem). Then with enough grinding you can earn the skins, hope that mess of a comment is some kind of help.
---
&gt;You can totally -1 pip in red ranks if the killer can't get people hooked...even if you escape.
---
Just like the killer can not pip by killing too fast and he needs to cut survivors some slack, the same can be done by survivors. 
---
If you care THAT much about pipping and the game is going too easy, when there is 1 or 2 gens left just engage the killer a little. You'll get some evader points which paired up with iridescent lightbringer and gold / iridescent unbroken should result in a safety pip or pip. Benevolent starts at silver.
---
Depends for me, I only really see killers with decent experience trying it to not get murder stomped by great survivors
---
Not the entire game, survivors can only vault the window 3 times. If the window is blocked then shack is like any other normal loop
---
^ DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THIS. I THOUGHT X2BP WAS GOING TO BE FUN, BUT HARDLY HAD PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO PLAY LONGER GAMES. &gt;: I JUST WANTED TO LEVEL MY CHARAS FASTER.  ALSO, MATCHES WERE STREAMERS OR GATEUS WERE USED - ENDED SO QUICKLY. WHY OFFER SOMETHING THAT GOOD AND END THE MATCH IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES. YOU'RE BARELY GETTING ANYTHING OUT OF THOSE OFFERINGS.
---
It was a rhetorical question, did you guys even read the text?
---
Ah, okay. Sorry for jumping the gun and for misunderstanding your post then. 
---
From how I understand it, they have different teams working on different things. That’s totally okay. Their creative team, their designers, they’re all amazing. The Hawkin’s map, while many people dislike it, is amazing IMO. 
---
But the actual team working on balancing issues and ironing out the game? Providing a smooth experience? Who are those people? Do they even exist? What are they doing? Why does every update break something? Why can other games, such as Remnant: Fallen from Ash, an indie game, be smooth and provide an amazing experience while BHVR struggles so much? It IS possible. You just need the right people, and sometimes you gotta make tough choices and let go of inexperienced people to make room for more experienced people with better knowledge. You’re doing nobody a favor if you just play nice and are too human. This is a business and either you deliver or you don’t and are out. It’s like nobody in BHVR had economic classes at school. Making tough choices is a part of it, even if those choices suck sometimes. We live in a hypercompetitive society after all. 
---
Who are they trying to satisfy and please? Us or their employees? Make a choice, BHVR. No consumers, no players, no game, no money. They’re lucky DbD has no competition or else the game would be dead.
---
Same :(
---
Play KYF games until they learn the ropes?
---
*Grow up*
---
Or when everyone and their mom wants to come visit you.
---
Oh, I bet that was fun lol. I don't usually get them either, that's why I was so confused when every single match was a camper.
---
May it never close.
---
4 out of 5 positive things you mentioned is a form of monetization lol
---
I think the guys point was the game runs like shit, there's still plenty of issues with it (some of which are gamebreaking) and yeah, they are on top of their game when it comes to making money but not so much fixing the actual game.
---
I’m waiting for the man-child to respond with ‘haha *woooosh*’
---
Yes we must keep it open for all
---
URBAN EVASION
---
Why would you need to test this? Fixated improves your walking speed. Urban doubles your crouch speed, which is half your walk speed.
---
I wouldn't say that one is better than the other. Once you are injured fixated stops working, you are also less noisy while crouching. So for sneaking urban is still better.
---
Now if you want to bring sprint burst fixated might be a godsend.
---
TLDR sneak build urban, gtfo build fixated
---
They know "the ropes" so to speak, they just don't have the several hundred hours worth of experience, loop practice, map memorization, etc, which is all crucial to playing at purple and red ranks.
---
Maybe bc you can't see survivors most of the time and they can get rid of mark pretty quick if hit all skillchecks?
---
That's not how jokes work. If you have to tell someone it's a joke, it isn't.
---
I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN YOU TRY TO FIND A GAME AS KILLER FOR 10+ MINUTES, FIND A GAME AND 3 SURVIVORS JOIN BUT NEVER A 4TH SURVIVOR SO I SIT THERE FOR ANOTHER TEN MINUTES JUST TO LEAVE AND TRY AND FIND AGAIN. IT HAS HAPPENED 3X IN A ROW!!!
---
Didn’t even need the rhetorical, when you could’ve just read the description of the perks
---
My bad, didn't watch the vid at first. Keys.. ugh. I've given my thoughts on how I'd change them. They are fucking ridiculous and much worse than moris.
---
Why did you need to test this? Urban evasion makes it so that your crouching speed is equal to your default walking speed, and fixated increases your walking speed, so
---
I respectfully disagree with that on so many levels
---
I'm glad my lower rank friends still support me on my quest to getting rank 1.
---
Drop the pallet in front of their face, when the killer's behind them.
---
*rimshot*
---
I like em big, I like em ~~chunky~~ bloody.
---
I believe what he is saying is,  without killers WE (as in surviviors) wouldn't have a game. Just as if killers didn't have surviviors that wouldn't have a game. Lol. That was kind of my comprehension. But I do as well, see what you're saying. We have to admit killers are more catered to in my opinion, as in most surviviors opinions.
---
Make sure you get BBQ and WGLF if your focus is bloodpoints.
---
I’m going to assume you already have a main.
---
* unlock teachables you want
---
* P3 your main(s)
---
* Level everyone else to 50 and unlock all the perks 
---
You spend like 2 million BP to re-level from 1-50.  Do that three times and you’re looking at 8 million BP per P3 50 character and you still have all the perks to unlock.
---
Prestiging isn’t worth it unless you absolutely have to have a bloody item.  Now that there is a cosmetic store, the bloody items are meh at best.  I’d consider P3ing your mains, but don’t waste time P3ing a character that you use for a daily once a quarter.
---
noted
---
Incase there were newer players that didn't know exactly what the numbers translated to in-game. There are a lot of new players now that the stranger things chapter has drawn in so many fans of the show to play the game
---
Maybe we could, just this once, not act like killers and survivors are political parties. Only then will we realize that maybe, regardless of role, if people did just work on improving then we'd all have to endure a lot less complaining.
---
I'm fapping rn
---
Nice you gave someone a  idea for r/dbdgonewild
---
I did! My biggest issue is that I'm not used to phasing yet (I've only played low tier killers like Legion or Bubba before), so I don't know when to initiate or stop the phase.  
---
I find survivors but I can't hit them fast enough after coming out of my power and they usually get away. Currently running discordance, sloppy butcher, bbq and haunted grounds.
---
Pretty classic reddit killer main take but you only ever post those so I'm not really surprised. 
---
Can't wait until the continuation of changes like this kills new player interest because they can't play with their friends without getting steamrolled. Continue to complain about killer queues taking too long while encouraging changes that will only make less survivor players and therefore longer queues I guess.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dctq5i/hex_ruin_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
hide in a locker
---
Then you mindgame the shack. Fake the window, fake the pallet switch rotation. It can definitely be done, I have done it before after rank reset but the killer wasn't very good.
---
Are you a red rank running BT, Adrenaline, DS and DH?
---
Edit: it’s also literally one fucking you’re seeing
---
My job here is done c:
---
Your perks are good to use with her.
---
Honestly, it’s all about getting used to her ability. 
---
When I started with her, damn I got my ass whooped! Especially because I was a shape main and in a high rank. But after a few games against those red ranks, I found out how to use her abilities. 
---
It’s all about practice! Good luck, I hope you enjoy it.
---
Ranked is still more toxic than casual in my experience
---
Na....... No...... Don't put that idea out there.
---
Now prestige him lmao
---
ngl his scream is pretty hot
---
In higher ranks, it's definitely tougher to pip. I'd say that there's both a decent amount of skill and luck involved for most of us. The people with exceptional skill probably need less luck on their side.
---
At rank 5 - 6, both killers and survivors seem a bit sweaty (just doing whatever they can to win), and I feel I run in to more moris at these ranks. It's probably just people trying to hit red ranks, but it makes it more difficult to survive and to get pips when people are dying much more. The skill level of the killers also increases as you get closer to rank 1, so you need to take that in to account as well.
---
When I'm playing at red ranks, I find it much more difficult to pip because someone else is always rushing to a hook for the altruism points, so unless I camp the area near a downed survivor I don't often get unhooks/heals. It's probably because I'm always working on a gen when the killer isn't chasing me, but it's still a pain when you're trying to rank up.
---
Fixated might make you faster but you won't nearly be as stealthy as using Urban Evasion
---
AH GOT YA
---
Too late, if someone is hiding in a locker a long time I will make a loud noise to draw the killer and repeatedly tty to open their locker til the killer is near
---
Low ranked survivors are matched with others of their rank, so it's easier for someone with less skill because you can lean on your teammates. 
---
I don't play killer, but it definitely seems to take more individual skill than just time played.
---
what? that's not how the point system works, the point of this post was he was not rewarded for killin 4 survivors, that's because if you facecamp, you don't let them get unhooked, and you aren't getting anypoints during facecamp also.  What? If you actually meant to say what you grammatically said which would be punishing killer for NOT NOT face camping (so face camping) yes, it's good they punish killers for face camping. fuck you.
---
Very bland statement, there is no clean distinction on who "reliably dc's". Saying people who run certain perks and you list the most popular perks is just scummy.
---
No
---
yea
---
"Some times I feel like, somebody is watching me! And I have no privacy"
---
It depends. If you are fast at hooking survivors early game it can slow gens speed otherwise is meh.
---
Post rework it is 🤷
---
Lol no. The ping was perfectly fine this whole match, no survivors were stuttering or lagging before this happened.
---
If you're closer to rank 20, it may take a bit to find a match, but as you rank up it becomes easier to find people at your level. I also play on xbox, and queues for killer are longer in my experience because there aren't enough survivors to immediately fill all the waiting killer matches.
---
&gt;I'll take longer queue times than the Bully With Friends shit that was happening prior.
---
You can't be bullied if you never get to play due to queue times so, win-win? Right?
---
Fixated will be good when Devs realize that the uninjured condition is useless. For now pick UE.
---
You don't need skill if you have enough time and grind. It needs only skill to make it to rank 1 in a fast time. But even this can be more luck than skill. I was never rank 1, but multiple times rank 2. I know the most of the tricks, but my map knowledge, looping and flashlight using is not that good and I make a ton of mistakes.
---
I'd add to this:
---
Pay to grind. If you don't want to grind, pay more so you can actually get the stuff you already paid for.
---
- - - -
---
I'm actually curious how much time you'll need to spend playing the game in order to 100% the pass. It'll either be reasonable amount of hours or straight up hell that encourages skipping it.
---
What are the main things that need to be fixed and what is broken?
---
THANKS
---
Same. Forced me to derank from 7 to rank 11 last night and will most likely continue since my friends have a hard time playing because of me lol
---
EDIT: I'm actually a rank 12-14 survivor myself and only got so far because of farm runs during the blood hunt, now that it's over I get destroyed myself so I'm not purposely deranking to stomp on lower killers
---
You can -1 pip easy if you don't do anything all game but sit on a generator
---
Same graphics, rank 7 atm :D
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
Oh look, another worthless comment acting like survivors aren't doing this to themselves.
---
It's fascinating, all we ever seem to hear about are these red rank survivors who have a horde of grey rank buddies who are now just suffering because of this change. Ignoring the fact that before they got to make the newbie killer's games absolutely miserable, but it's okay because people who play killer aren't real people right?
---
Every time something changes that might inconvenience some fragment of the survivor playerbase everyone cries gloom and doom for the game.
---
&gt;True infinites removed
---
"This game is dead, enjoy playing without survivors"
---
&gt;Vacuum pallets removed
---
&gt;Healing nerfed
---
&gt;Exhaustion pauses while running
---
&gt;Decisive Strike is changed to better suit it's role as an anti-tunneling perk
---
&gt;EGC implemented to hasten the end of game cycle and eliminate hatch stand offs
---
&gt; Maps being reworked to have more unsafe pallets rather than fewer longer looping spots
---
&gt;SWF can no longer abuse matchmaking to ruin the games of lower ranked killers who are also just trying to learn the game, same as their supposed 'Rank 20 friends'
---
So yea, heard this song and dance before. 6 months down the line I'm sure there be something else that people are abusing now and will cry about when it gets fixed/balanced.  And that too will be the end of the game as we know it. I'll make sure to add it to the growing pile.
---
no she does not ; - ;
---
|&gt;i feel bad for killers
---
Literally the point of the perk though. You beat the killer by working through ruin and not giving a shit about it.

There are no dedicated servers that are live yet buddy.

That's pretty stupid though. You have players on the team that are way lower than the top survivor and you might go up against a killer that is even higher than their best.
---
Sure it cuts on the queue time, but it's hardly a match worth playing out &amp; waiting for :\
---
Can you do one for Clown?
---
As a killer, even if I’m trying to be friendly, if I find a survivor in a locker I’m putting them on a hook. 
---
I had to message a Nea the other day and let the person know not to run into lockers because it explodes my screen with notification. I’d give up on chase to go patrol gens and see she ran into a locker somewhere thinking I was still chasing her! The person thanked me for the advice though. Just teacher Killer over here.
---
A meme as old as time
---
Nope. Only if you dont attempt it will it come up twice. If you miss the skill check though, its gone for the rest of the match.
---
Edit: Let me add, that if the killer doesnt pick you up before your timer goes out, you still have it for next unhook.
---
I think she is fine except for maybe a few add-ons combinations.
---
Without Iron Will (and even with it, honestly), the spirit is in 100% control when phasing. Any jukes or dodges you try to do she will still be able to follow you if they play Spirit well.
---
Slugging generally is the way to win as killer- it's just efficient in many cases.
---
You don't always slug, but if you know where another survivor is, yeah starting the next chase immediately with zero downtime is amazing.
---
Yo son plug me up in the DM
---
If you miss it you get another chance (after being unhooked) and if you hit it then you don’t get another chance
---
Maybe you should look at yourself because you've also done everything you are moaning about in this post.
---
Prime example
---
&gt;
---
It sounds like you get all your info from a shitty streamer.
---
Pot calling the kettle black.
---
Waste of time talking to you.
---
Keep crying about bodyblocking, despite it being a "bad strat" I really don't care lol.
---
Argument already makes next to no sense since I dismissed your tunneling/camping point and said they don't matter.
---
Just blocking because I'm tired of having you ping me with notifications, have fun.
---
Well then...
---
Adapt. You can still pallet loop her. If you run Iron Will she wont phase mid chase.
---
Is that a fanny pack? I can’t tell the quality is that of a potato.
---
A W A K E N ,  M Y   Q U E N T I N S
---
If it isnt already used it can become active again after the second unhook
---
They’re live on switch and they are/were(?) live on pc for testing
---
What if dull totems passively slowed down gen speeds similar to thanatophobia. This effect would apply to all dull totems.
---
My other idea is the dull totem closest to the gen has this effect and slows the gen speed down considerably. But the other dull totems do not slow down the gen speed.
---
“Thanks, I had a good time too!”  Nothing oisses salty folk off as much as politeness and ignoring their anger.
---
It's a combination of skill and grinding.
---
Personally Survivor games feel much more of a grind once you hit red ranks, because it's easy enough to safety pip. But sometimes you just can't do enough for that pip and I have yet to double pip as a red rank survivor.
---
Killer games require more skill than survivors imo since you have to play towards the emblem system. Pick a good killer that isn't very map dependent with solid perks and you should be able to pip most games.
---
Ugh I thought the oink meme was dead
---
theyve been tested on PC the last 2 days, pay attention please.
---
I'll sort ya!
---
Had a Myers bring me to the exit and let me go yesterday. Amazing stuff.
---
I would like to!
---
If i got time on my hands i will surely try to make more of these :)
---
Why not?
---
“Tested” not “live”please pay attention.
---
In particular builds with particular killers ( Plague, Freddy with both slow down add-ons ) it's decent. But otherwise no.
---
Oh yes he is as well as you should never get a value of 0 as you get some amount for just being alive for a certain amount of time if I’m not mistaken
---
How would you even nerf that though? Also you don't get a speed boost when you're put into the broken status by her vomit and I think that's very over powered
---
Prayer beads are only thing I feel are unfair. Should only be silent in a 32m radius.
---
Can I have it too plz? &lt;3
---
Trapper: Stay.
---
Baby survivors raise the roof
---
they have been live on public servers, yes.
---
This is the reason I do it. Deny the safe unhook without unfairly punishing the survivor who got unhooked against his will.
---
...Tested on the live servers. YOU pay attention.
---
None of them require you to gather crows...
---
Thanks to you I want a dead by daylight sitcom now
---
Imagine thinking Plag is OP.
---
I swear I'm starting to see just as many posts complaining about people complaining about Spirit as I do posts complaining about Spirit at this point.
---
Let me guess, just use Iron Will or Spine Chill or something? Smh.
---
Ah yes, the stealthiest color: *Firetruck red* lol
---
Another DM over here please.
---
She’s a mid tier killer. The only time she is legit strong is if she has the add-on to reveal sick survivor auras.
---
If they're being farmed? It depends. More hits and hooks means better points. The quicker you kill a single player, the game tips in your favor for sure. But sometimes that makes it more difficult to get your 3 total hooks on each survivor.
---
New bubba masks comin up boys !!
---
gg and leave
---
The different settings, increased fps, m&amp;k.
---
Source.
---
But paying for a skin is 100% optional, and does not change your gameplay experience in any way. I admit you can take it too far, like what Apex did with the heirloom set, but I don't see a reason to feel cheated by an optional payment system.
---

---
As a jane main she aint one of us anymore
---
he doent want to lose pip and bp and he is right
---
I've been playing nothing but Killer since I started playing and over this Blood Hunt I've never been ranking up so fast.  I've always been sub-rank 10 (spent a lot of time languishing around 15) but I was seeing purple or red rank survivors almost every other game, and then... it all stopped. I'm actually getting survivors at my own rank now and it feels AMAZING. This update has been an absolute godsend
---
No. Thats not in any way his fault.
---
A) Get headphones.
---
B) Play as Spirit.
---
C) Easy wins
---
But a good Spirit can still catch Iron Will users with her power. Idk what you are trying to say.
---
*LOUD WIND WOOSH IN YOUR EAR*
---
Me with Nurse and Spirit.
---
Its a sign
---
i would ban him for stupidity
---
Oh yea I did that one
---
I hope they remove them soon, I am having a horrible time playing the game right now even with green ping and I have no idea why. My internet is stable and everything, I have no issue there.
---
im a rep 8 killer but a rep 20 survivor and honestly im about to shit myself when i hear even 1 heartbeat just go to edge of the map or ot a locker to feel safe
---
I agree
---
Dude, you can't hear her phase sound inside her terror radius. You at least know how Spirit works ?
---
Its a known bug.
---
No harm done :)
---
I was just a bit confused because obviously I want my extra BP, why wouldn't I mori?
---
Oh look a video of my friends I play with.
---
It's a glitch that's been happening  alot. Personally if you find you like the Pigs teachables and you don't have them just level her up and don't question it
---
Wait, she doesn’t?!
---
Here is the announcement: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/
---
A good survivor will relocate to a new pallets. 
---
Here are some tips, never stand still, try to walk past a pallet and find a new one, then go back to the one you passed when your pallet locked, watch the spirits body if she makes a sharp turn when standing still, shes phasing.
---
Where can I see the spirits skin?
---
Me, when I can't even get to red ranks with normal graphics and 60 fps
---
nah. Let the consoles play with PC players. HOWEVER, give them the choice to, and make it not default.
---
Replace Ruin w/ sloppy.
---
Nurses is amazing on GF. Especially with those addons.
---
Gotta keep them injured for nurses to work though. Sloppy would be better.
---
Ruin is nice, but 90% chance that it spawns within view of a survivor.
---
this is the real god pallet
---
My bad, actually you replied to an earlier comment of mine, mid-debate sorry. But i feel like the prayer beads should then tremendously increase duration
---
why am I getting downvoted for being ironic lmao plague is not op
---
So you were fine with an unfair game for killer, but not for your friends?
---
OINK
---
time to become a pig main until you shut off your game ;)
---
this is probably the best advice I got for now
---
The game is still the best
---
She’s so easily countered. One of my favorites to play against
---
There have been a couple times that I've had a killer who actually camped their ruin totem.  It was hilarious because we just did the gens and left the totem alone.
---
Fixated combos HARD with spinechill. 
---
Fixated spinechill ironwill ( and sprintburst btw) would be op together
---
It’s almost as if that’s just your opinion or something. She’s interesting and interactive and has basic chase mechanics 
---
But okay. Have fun with your one trillion Nurses and Spirits
---
Billy was the one that took the longest for me, for some reason.
---
be happy because i dont have to deal with real life responsibilities anymore
---
True as it can be
---
Your salt is what i live for
---
I've spawned directly beside it several times before...
---
Is a mobile version really needed? How about you fix the pc problems first
---
thanks!
---
That's true I guess I haven't gotten to high tier survivor ranks yet (I'm rank 7) so idk lol maybe I just need to get better at the game
---
and him forgetting a couple of O's and somone else responding "Its woooosh with 4 o's"
---
I never saw her body sharp turning when she's starting phasing and I saw a lot of survivors playing against her.
---
yeah and it’s fucking infuriating I am running it to slow down the game not to waste a perk slot and want to die 20 seconds right after spawning
---
While I do not have a normal ps4, I have a ps4 pro I found taking the top cover off and cleaning the intakes and fan helped greatly. Especially if your ps4 is loud upon starting dead by daylight. I have had less disconnects and it seems to run smoother.
---
Noob indicator.
---
"Doctor has entered the chat"
---
a dream is something that most likely wont happen so i would have to go with jason
---
oh i used items that are in the game. im so toxic smh
---
Very true I can't seem to find a way to directly counter her personally
---
Tldr; because survivor have the option, but killers don't. 
---
Pre-change killers didn't have ANY options to train against survivors who were the same ranks. You must know yourself how popular SWF is. It is nearly impossible to find a lobby without at least 2 survivors playing in a team, often on mics. Guess what that meant? Every single match killers would face survivors that outranked them by 10 ranks or so. With them having any added advantage talking on discord would give them.
---
But survivors DO have an option to pair with killers that are their rank. It's called solo que. Yes, you would trade in the advantage of working together with your friends, and the fun that could provide, but you get to play against weak killers that allowed you to practise. Before the change, you would not only get the less experienced killers but also the huge advantage SWF give you. So boosting is super easy. Meanwhile killers have not a single choice. How is that fair?
---
Plus, KYF has always been unranked. No option to practise properly, I'd say. So your only option as killer was to deal with the red ranks every single game, even if you're only a 'baby' killer. And guess what? The ones that do make it through, they become godlike. There is a reason why red rank killers mostly play top tier killers. Because that usually was the only way they could win and rank up. 
---
Additionally, consider how easy survivor is compared to killer. As survivor you have only 2 match results; escaped or sacrificed/dead. That becomes a pretty easy win condition. But killers, they have 5 possible outcomes; 4 escaped, 3 escaped, etc. Most players only consider a match a 'win' if you can kill all 4 survivors. That's only 1 of 5 match outcomes. Add to that the fact that even if you 'win', you still could be slammed with an Entity Displeased. How disheartening is that? But even with how easy survivor is compared to killer, even with the low ranking killers (pre-change), even with the SWF advantage, survivors still get to complain if they lose and killers have to just suck it up and "git gud"? Sorry but fuck right off. 
---
This change was needed. If your friend now complains that he needs to face a godlike red rank killer if he plays SWF with you, even tho he is rank 19 three weeks after rank reset, then maybe he isn't meant to play at all.
---
Or that other person is way to dumb to realise that its a joke
---
Double Pip.
---
so about 2-3 Iridecent emblems.
---
The basement doesn't needs perks to make it better though, it's already inherently strong for the killer
---
Its bc the activate ability delay.
---
im going to report you to mathiue cote for putting jane in D
---
I have solution git gud
---
ez report
---
I don’t understand :(
---
 combine dance with me and head on together and you literally vanish out of existence when you stun the killer
---
Perhaps, perhaps. I guess dreams are still possible to come true.
---
In other news, the sky is falling
---
Pennywise is next killer btw
---
Zee healing is not as rewarding as zee hurting!
---
What makes an unfair game for the killer?  Not getting a 4K every single game? 
---
In our experience the game was balanced because 2/3 of us would be sacrificed every single game. And it was rare we would get a full escape. This is with average killers. 
---
At the very least, 1 of us didn’t make it out(but most commonly, it’s one who would survive) 
---
So does it make it unfair for a killer to sacrifice 3/4 survivors but it can’t get the last one because they’re higher skill - but it’s fair to 4K all of them every single game? The power of SWF is the ability to work together but if 2/3 lesser skilled players are taken out, then it’s effectively 1 /2 v 1 with killers having the powers/add on’s to go against 4.  That’s the reason a lot of well mannered killers say “sorry for dc” because for every survivor that is sacrificed, they game becomes increasingly easy for killers to 4k.
---
What I mean is, what are the specifics? I know one of them you need to stay away from a hooked survivor.
---
Well, looks like I know how to counter you.
---
Does new chapter mean we get a new killer/survivor?
---
neas the entity tho
---
I mean if you're using a mouse and playing nurse then nurse mains don't need to get prepared for anything, not even to play the game, it just plays itself
---
so you have chosen, death.
---
Yeah it's definitely what they were going for.

Pretty much 4 required. You can maybe do three and one gold, but I’m not sure. It’s very very hard when your trying, but easy when you aren’t.
---
Ahah yes
---
Dollotrons
---
you can already play beta build with other players
---
Honestly, I would rather go against Nurse every game than Plague. I am being serious too
---
Battle pass
---
&gt; I admit you can take it too far
---
&gt; but I don't see a reason to feel cheated by an optional payment system.
---
It's because people have different tolerances for what they consider to be too far in terms of monetization. I consider day 1 DLC for DLC in a paid game to be too far already, so personally I don't like that they're also adding a battlepass system which is generally a system designed to target a small subset of people with a concern that they'll miss out on content if they don't buy and complete the pass (Who would be the ones who either play LOADS or pay to skip the grind) while also having a broader appeal to people who don't have that concern but want the cool stuff that Behavior will undoubtedly put in the paid track that they've technically already unlocked except they haven't coughed up the dough to actually unlock it.
---
And I can completely understand players not being happy about this because generally the industry as a whole is moving away from rewarding players with cool stuff and charging the players for the privilege of getting cool stuff. Though I definitely don't agree with how LipSmacker expresses their dislike for the system.
---
Theres already two perks devoted to it. This would make the perk useable without hurting game balance. 
---
When perks are meme teir bad, theyre generally changed. 
---
So why not fix the perk if its there anyways?
---
Plague is not a fun killer to play against and I would even say she's not very fun to play as. 
---
Playing Against Plague: The choice between staying broken or cleansing is just not a great one since staying broken is more preferable to her broken range attack. Which just doesn't lead to that many great chases. 
---
Playing as Plague: You basically lose your power once everyone is broken since the main strategy survivors employ is no cleansing. While you can instant down others you don't gain anything else for it. Myers has increase lunge range and faster vault, Billy has his mobility, and Ghostface has stealth. Now you can run thana or her add-on to get something out of survivors being broken, but that doesn't solve the issue of just being a M1 killer with no power.
---
*Steve is injured*
---
David: If it moans like a woman...
---
She's a 115 killer with a 32m terror radius and absolutely no chase power if nobody cleanses. She's also the tallest killer. To say she's loopable would be an understatement. She either takes chase perks and has little slowdown or takes slowdown perks and has hilariously bad chase potential. Thanat adds 13 seconds to a gen at full power if 1 person is working on it. Her games are usually the fastest because the only other thing for survivors to do (healing) is taken away.
---
The nurse is the only killer who can completely ignore the most prominent part of a survivors game plan.
---
Pallets and looping, you’ll almost never use pallets even against bad nurses and good luck ever running around the good ones at all.
---
She needed some small nerfs imo.
---
But with that said nothing is official yet, so relax.
---
Idc either way, but I think it's detrimental to new players who join a random lobby with a swf group of 2 or 3 that has a rank 1. 
---
But then again, ranks don't really matter for older players. I really only see this affecting newcomers negatively
---
I am. My friends love the advise I give them and respect the fact I put them in their place when they bitch about stupid stuff.
---
It’s that time of the month
---
They'll get around you and get the hook. It's obvious if someone's body blocking they will likely have body blocking perks
---
Don’t let the door hit you where the Demogorgon Split you.
---
Edit: as long as you have access to a charaters bloodwebs you can get their teachable by leveling them.
---
The killer had no choice other than to play against people higher rank. If you want to SWF you can opt in to harder games.
---
Well, time to save up some blood points
---
What? Clown's is AMAZING. He's got a face like a Pumpkin could love, and he's got one of those flowers.
---
It's so very...Clown.
---
Percentages are 2 high even the regular add one don't give that much
---
I agree with his points. It is misleading but I couldnt change the title. I just was saying that as part of my own opinion.
---
Well obviously, but if people want to play with friends of different skill levels, what do you suggest?
---
Hey, it's me your neighbor; trying to get a cup of sugar.
---
Too*
---
So you’d Mori yourself?
---
I mean to play as would probably be my main man Jeff. Perk wise that fucking gremlin or ash
---
The only time I ever care about having a mori kill me is during double blood point weekends. Lol, they're in the game for a reason. I understand everyone has dailies. 
---
But during double blood points? Don't use them unless you HAVE to. Killer gets more blood points for sacrifices and survivors get more blood points for playing longer.
---
Accept the fact that you're gonna go against higher level players. There is no other solution that doesn't force killers into unbalanced matches that they can't avoid.
---
Right...
---
Yeah killer queues are always going to be longer than survivor queue. One killer per game vs 4 survivors per game. You could have 4 killers searching for a game and 4 survivors searching for a game. 1 game fills up and 3 killers keep waiting.
---
Because it probably is one of the best perks. Self-care has no limitations, no need to run anywhere specific and has you be able to heal right there on the spot.
---
If a killer runs SB, self-care takes 8 seconds longer and healing takes 4 seconds longer. So if you and your teammate are injured, its actually the same speed compared to you healing them and them healing you. In practice it will actually be faster since you wont be wasting time by running up to them
---
Just curious, how and why did the lawsuit come about?
---
I think hillbilly is the "best" Killer because of he's a  very powerful killer with a relatively short learning curve
---
You just played? aren’t dedicated servers still enabled on pc
---
50% increase plus insta saw addons? HEEEELL NAW
---
Exactly that reasoning is what I'm talking about
---
Or
---
*A player disconnected while loading.*
---
*Network Error: You must be connected to the internet to use this application.*
---
*An Unkown Error has occurred.*
---
*Lmao fuck you*
---
It’s the “Jigsaw Box” icon, not a perk I believe.
---
She’s just not a “”fun”” Killer to go against. Having her stand still at Loops/Areas while you’re in the middle of a chase and having to guess that 50/50 coin flip every time of whether she’s actually phasing or not just gets old very fast. Even if you are good against her, if she has Stridor or good headphones, you are literally dead next time she has her Phase Ability ready and you are injured,
---
I personally don’t mind facing her, but when you fight her over and over in the high ranks it’s just stale. Spirits almost always use Ruin and Haunted Grounds, and past a certain Rank, will exclusively use Prayer Beads.
---
"For some reason"
---
I was heavily joking, lol. Really nothing to it other than cosmetics/“honor”, if you want to call it that.
---
Single mom's are in your area!
---
Yeah I think the Nurse is fun to go against. It's a much different style using walls and LOS breakers to juke and run her around instead of pallets, there is constant interaction between us, and I feel rewarded whenever she misses a blink.
---
But with the spirit, if you're not near a pallet, you die. If you are near a pallet, you have to make a guess that's so heavily in her favor that you pretty much die regardless. I don't feel rewarded at all more like "I got lucky that time" if I guess right. There is just genuinely nothing fun about this killer at all :/
---
That's very true for survivors it really turns it into a lose lose situation I never thought about it from the killers side in that situation though being an m1 killer isn't that bad with the one shots though
---
Currently I guess worse case you leave take a picture of what you got in blood points maybe they would help out? Or just pull plug maybe that still works sorry this happened sucks when it does
---
The madlad
---
The only bad thing I see here is a Billy ragequitting...
---
My guess this might have to do how dedicated servers handle hit detection. Before the game detected both hits(pallet, survivor) and does both, while here it seems like it only the pallet triggers, when it's within the htibox.
---
Ah nope servers were activated on live servers yesterday for more tests we have a survey at the end of the week I think
---
You're kinda fear mongering, lets just wait for the changes.
---
Ah, thank you. There ya go OP.
---
Sarcasm
---
This is fucking awesome my dude
---
That person probably didn't deserve an apology. If you were playing as a good teammate from the beginning, doing objectives and you have an opportunity to escape, you have every right to. If you have a good chance of a hook rescue near an open or primed exit gate, and have borrowed time, yea you should go for them. If it's a good chance you die though, no. As a killer, a good percentage of my kills are endgame, survivors being hell bent on rescues and getting themselves downed.
---
It’s most likely a small icon you see when you receive a tip when facing the Pig, otherwise I found it on the wiki
---
How long are we talking..my pc is shit so it’s not really an option. Also, what is SWF?
---
Thank you!
---
How is it not tho? His pc can’t handle the game in combination with streaming which is giving him terrible fps and in turn also gives him an advantage over others since he makes others lag and he actually caught a guy because of that lag. 
---
He also knows about the problem and just says tough luck
---
Game had devolved into memes by this point. Survivor I was chasing was just messing around with me, but yeah alright mate &lt;3
---
Obviously this is a great addition to the game, balanced and all, totally not a shit post
---
As a killer main I feel this when I play survivor
---
Guess it’s time to pop back up
---
Yes, I took your comment in a different direction than you’d intended (sorry!). There are a bunch of people in this community that believe DBD to be ESL-ready, and I thought that’s what you’d meant. Nope, what you’d meant (I think) was simply in the literal sense - that the game is a competition between two sides. Two teams are competing against each other
---
That’s cool. I don’t understand your point about relaxing in a competitive game, though - I can’t speak for everyone, but I like to play the game to have fun. Sure, it sucks sometimes when you’re playing as killer and don’t get a single sacrifice, and sure, I still try my best no matter what I’m playing, but I still relax while playing the game because winning and losing doesn’t matter to me - if I rank up, that’s neat, and if I derank, it just makes it more likely that I’ll be matched with players (hopefully) closer to my skill level. 
---
I guess it all comes down to one’s definition of “relax” - for me, relaxing means I don’t get into a super competitive mindset where I really worry about winning, but I can still try my best. I take it you might think of the term “relaxing” differently, or you have a different mindset of DBD. That’s all cool too
---
As killer about 10 minutes. As survivor (SWF=Survive with Friends) it could either be really quick like 2 minutes but I also constantly wait about 20 minutes to join a lobby only to be disconnected because someone else has a high ping (bad internet)
---
Oh, believe me when I say I’ve never even *considered* playing a porn game, let alone in my room and with my computer. They likely wouldn’t think that exactly, but they would think that it’s a little strange to see me playing as an almost-naked ghost lady.
---
So you’re saying that my brother who got the game to play with me - because the idea of getting killed or perhaps escaping together is kind cool in a game - should just not play with me because of the high ranks he will face due to my skill level and this is fair and balanced because the killer needs to have the chance to 4K everyone, every game? 
---
I guess I just don’t see that as balance.
---

Hey, I'm rank 10 and use the lockers occasionally. Only when I'm not confident in my ability to hide at that time though.

Thank you very much really appreciated :P
---
Why do you want to randomly buff bubba? He’s perfectly fine rn
---
it seems strange to me in a game about monsters that players don't try to yeet the survivors as soon as possible, and that that wouldn't be the most fun even if the survivors aren't happy about it. but maybe after playing awhile that becomes less fun?
---
ty for explanation, watching streams of the game had confused me
---
Just work on getting more clips.
---
An open present? Ooooooo
---
Wouldn't be bringing up ranks if you're legit complaining about Plague. 🤡
---
Explain to them why the game went as it did, call out every mistake they made that caused you to kill them.

Wtf have these people got more than 50 hours on the game????

First, InstaSaw isn't an add-on, he does that at base.
---
But okay, so 50% is too high.
---
So having looked at the numbers, 1.25% for base walking, 1.50% for chainsaw revving, 12.5% for the dash.
---
this makes his overall walking a whopping 5% when you get all 4, and his Chainsaw Rev Speed at 6%. His Dash speed, even at 50%, is still slower than Hillbilly's, which is 230%, and Bubba would be 176.5%
---
I don’t mind plague LUL 🤡
---
I don't see how Demogorgon could be ranked higher than Billy. His mobility is more limited compared to Billy and his special attack can't instant down. 
---
I still think he's in top 3 after Nurse and Spirit, because his unlimited mobility with no restrictions combined with an instant down.
---
Since when I would assume that would be posted in the news for the game
---
Something like that would
---
Be for the PTB branch I am on the standard version
---
Dude, no he isn't. Bubba is in the bottom half of the Killer Tier list, he's somewhere around either bottom 3, or just above that.
---
People who play this game know you don't choose Bubba, you choose Hillbilly.
---
But decisive strike..
---
No, I'm saying that it's unfair for the killer to have to face way stronger players when they didn't elect to do so.  If there was an icon identifying SWF maybe I'd see your point, but it sounds like you just want to body killers at your brother's rank. Which you can still do by family sharing a second account to make a lower rank account.
---
Bubba + insidious + basement = stonks
---
If it wasn't Spirit, it'd be something else. Probably the same types of shitters who bitched about pre-rework Freddy.
---
I don't know why people think using self-care is a selfish thing since medkits/toolboxes are scarce not to mention people are mostly mutes that I bump into so unless it's my close friend or people that emote for a heal I'm gonna assume their doing Gens.
---
Nah, high ranks aren't a guaranteed victory, but "ranks mean nothing" is straight-up bullshit.
---
Yep.
---
Before the rework, it got me to rank 1 on the Crapper.
---
This, but instead of people asking you to do something, one of the players loses connection/disconnects while loading in and you're send back to the main menu for the 3rd time in a row
---
Humans are irrational creatures.
---
So you honestly think this is a fair matchmaking system? I literally was just getting some of my irl friends into the game and now they wont play because they dont want to to against rank 5 killers every game. This new system just promotes people deranking so they can play with friends which will make the problem worse.
---
Ahhh. 
---
I guess I got fucking told then, didn’t I?
---
K thx.
---
He wants you to stand still and take it even when he has NOED, Ruin, 150 speed, BBQ&amp;Chilli, Nurse's Calling, a bunch of traps, Haunted Grounds, etc
---
Yeah it works it's just an incredibly inefficient way to play the game if you actually want the team to do well.  You're following chases keeping you from repairing.  You're then taking an intentional body block hit and going to waste all the time healing back to full.  Rinse and repeat two more times.  Sure you got your MoM to proc but at the cost of essentially making the team play a 3 man game for a couple minutes.
---
I use the shroud offerings pretty often which are secret and rarely get dc's right away. Might be bad luck but surely some people dc in fear of moris. You can try to use devour hope but good luck with it not getting cleansed by the time it is useful.
---
We encountered (friend and I) a friendly trapper who we didn’t know was friendly, ended up feeling bad when we didn’t give him any points after the gates had been powered
---
You can claim you don't think I have that many hours; that is a moot point, anyway. "Oh, you only have x amount of hours, you don't know ANYTHING!"
---
Your argument is kind of pathetic...no offense. But I listened to what some other folks said, and adjusted some values.
---
Fact is, even at 50% Dash boost, Leatherface is STILL slower than the Hillbilly. I tweaked his chainsaw rev up time to be MUCH weaker, to be a smidgen above Billy's at max power, and his base speed being boosted a bit provides a small boost, but nothing that much.
---
Bubba is weak right now, and his biggest strength is the ability to down more than 1 Survivor, which makes him ideal for camping but not good for gen pressure. Giving him speed boosts GIVES him an ability to move more freely about the map; he's not going to move anywhere near what Hillbilly does, or Nurse...or Hag...or Demogorgon...or Freddy.
---
Just do it.
---
To be honest I don't like that Nurse change at all. Looks like another band-aid fix for her bad Add-Ons.
---
Jenner's is just like Kavanagah's and Bad Man's Last Breath a super bad Very Rare Add-On. They might give one pretty impactful buff, but also give you a debuff which tends to make the buff itself less powerful while also removing a blink. Which means, even when you use it, you'll most likely have to use an additional Blink as second Add-On because none would play Nurse with just one Blink.
---
And then there's the Plaid Flannel...I think this one and the common Doctor Add-On that displays the zap hitbox are pretty damn unnecessary. Doctor doesn't need any aim in the first place while the Nurse aim-indicator causes more harm than good. Learning how to handle her blinks works muuuch better when relying on your muscle memory instead of attempting to relying on the indicator, regardless of how inexperienced you are with her.
---
And when it comes up to the Jenner's Last Breath addition itself...Meh. The overall concept of the "Tracer Recall" ,as the memes already state, is pretty cool, but overall it seems a bit too situational to be consistently useful on a VR Add-On.
---
In my opinion they should just make the "recall" part of her default abillity, simply due to it's already mentioned inconsistency. The situation in which a Nurse will be able to utilize the recall properly will be extremely rare, sadly I can already tell that.
---
And then you also have to consider, if they don't change anything about Jenner's but just add the recall, it still yields the reduced blink movement speed and have a total of just one blink without any other Add-On that grants you some more.
---
Overall, remove the whole concept of Plaid Flannel, making it a common won't make it more useful or attractive but simply easier accessible, which isn't relevant in its specific case anyway. While all the other VR's except for "Campbell's Last Breath" (the +2 blinks one), are very underpowered thanks to their reliance on a 2nd Add-On that add's atleast one blink, lacking room to play and test around other add-ons.
---
They're not impactful enough, deny instead of promoting synergies with other Add-Ons, whilst also delivering more disadvantages than advantages as a whole.

FuNnY nEa KiLlEr MeMe
---
Yeah, I'm assuming it has something to do with the dedicated servers. But if the game is going to prioritise a pallet over a survivor (the first saw) then I'm a little worried.
---
Bad Santa Killer confirmed.
---
"sorry for getting my rank reset by you, lemme stand afk for 5 minutes to make the match fair 15 games in a row instead of you giving me my well deversed 2pip to let me get to my skill level quicker"
---
I love this mentality. "Oh, this person is too good for this rank, let's keep him here"
---
The matchmaking should make the games fun and balanced, not us making dumb mistakes on purpose just to be able to rank up and get to the level where we no longer have to do that
---
So besides emojis and "you're an idiot", do you have anything besides *fuck all* to add to the conversation?
---
The aim assist is unreal
---
\**Laughs in Nancy*\*
---
Baby killer
---
Every time I get the heal daily ritual I swear.
---
I find someone else to heal me up, and Im always the guy that goes for rescues so its just an additional thing on my way to do my job
---
watch FarmerJohn, he will show you the true potato graphics
---
A good red rank Spirit with a set of headphones?  Yeah you're not mindgaming that without Iron Will man.  They can phase you down with incredible precision based solely off of your standard breathing, footsteps, grass moving, etc....I can mindgame a run of the mill or bad Spirit all day but there is exceedingly little counterplay unless you dedicate a slot to Iron Will to mindgame a good Spirit with a Headset.
---
So you move around.
---
Spirit has 100% control while she is phasing, survivors cant fight back. She can hear you, see where you are running, see your vaults, ect.  While survivors get no notifications of where she is or if she is even phasing
---
Even when this is a shitpost, I'd like to copy/paste what I previously said in regards to the announced additions :
---
Edit : @OP, sorry for potentially causing confusion as I acciedentally posted this one earlier from my 2nd account.
---
The killer can still hear footsteps, and even if it's successful, that's a very niche combo and you could have on much better perks to aid your survival
---
I'm an altruistic player, and will even help those that haven't helped me, but I also don't put the game or myself at risk to help them. I can't help if I'm dead or hooked, and if I'm spending too much time trying to help someone in a tight spot (like a patrol-camping killer, where a save is POSSIBLE but super risky and needs to be well timed) then I'm not doing gens and helping everyone else. I get salty ass messages when I decide it'll be in the team's best interest to let that person go. Like, dude, I promise I tried, but you can't always save everybody.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time.
---
So here’s a tip (not a console player, just happen to know this) the FPS is capped at 30, and nurse on console is almost impossible to play
---
If I were ranking it based on thickness, it'd be a much different scenario
---
I literally just told you how to play against killers your friend's rank. And I think it's far more fair than the old system. Survivor has always had a choice to play SWF and killer didn't have a choice to play against them.
---
Omg he’s there :O !!! Also I’m going tomorrow if anyone wants to meet
---
At your rank, I suggest you use play with your food, dark devotion, ruin, agitation if you want to be successful as bubba Cos as a rank 1 killer, I can consistently get 4ks as bubba on pc. But I still do agree that he needs changing. And plz don’t use hag and nurse in the same sentence when talking about moving around the map. Hag is 110% speed and her traps are rng dependant on how many potatoes they have. But maybe at your rank the survivors just run around against a hag. 🤡
---
Thanks for water, I'm drowning.
---
The killer is fast af and you can't run from him. Buuut he can't see you, and when he can you get alerted.
---
Keep distance so you won't get fucked.
---
People *really* believe this shit, huh?
---
Following the test in the last PTB, we decided to postpone the launch of dedicated servers on the live game while we iron out a few issues. Our new launch target for PC and consoles is Fall 2019. We will be running tests on the live build of the game, on PC only, starting in early October. For more details, click here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/ 
---
Dedicated servers have, however, been active on the Nintendo Switch™ since launch. This is essential as the Switch version does not support hosting a game. Any improvements made to dedicated servers on other platforms will make their way to the Nintendo Switch™ as well. 
---
Don't really know what to think of that message. That would suggest it's live testing but i've also seen lobbies with high ping and the usual stuff that comes from p2p connection
---
I always find a new reason to go back online and let myself get fucked raw by another 4 man instaheal SWF
---
I don’t know about you, but when I’m in a match where Michael hits Tier 3, I get pretty spooked for the next minute. I’d say that’s an example of a killer becoming scarier as a direct result of becoming more powerful
---
I don’t mean that the rest of the game should stay exactly the same, but I *do* mean that there should be more of a shift towards survivors hiding, rather than being able to easily run away and knowing they can stretch a single chase out for a couple of minutes. The best way to force a shift like that (along with some gameplay changes) is to make the killer more powerful, and harder to escape
---
Case in point - the game Outlast is pretty scary looking, but once you realize that you can run from any enemy and easily lose them by ducking into a locker/under a bed, the game stops being scary. Contrast that with Alien: Isolation, where your only real option against the alien is to hide, but even then he might find you - this game is scary throughout its entire runtime, because the alien is actually *harder* to escape from. I’m pretty confident that the same could apply to Dead By Daylight, which is why I think the game should be more killer-sided in order to be more thematically appropriate
---
Death by Snu Snu!
---
&gt;You were definitely bragging about how nice you are to survivors.  
---
Lol
---
Here’s an upvote buddy . People are mentally ill .i agree , happens a lot in swf or in red ranks mostly with good red ranks :) . Ofc people will disagree just to argue but 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s the internet!
---
SPREAD POSITIVITY !! have a great day
---
She has a pussy with an eyeball on her forehead
---
You can down all 4 if they're over altruistic. Which happens alot with swf because they know you can't hook them all without depip
---
He was just mad, I understand why honestly. I didn't take it personally. I just hope the guy realized later on that It wasnt such a big deal and he can still enjoy playing with randoms.
---
I usually don't even get mad when that happens becuase 9 times out of 10 if I made it to the endgame it was a fairly long and fun game for me. Death or escape doesn't mean much besides 5k BP at that point tbh the game is over either way and I had a good time. No reason to let the very end of a 10-15 min match get you upset.
---
Ummmmm.......watch any leading killer streamer ever play her and you'll see that routinely.  Good nurses don't even need to use addons period man.  I've seen no perk no addon 4k games with her on youtube.
---
If u want to rape baby killers, make a smurf
---
2 rank 3's and 2 rank 20's should get a rank 11 killer
---
3 rank 3's and 1 rank 20 should get a rank 7 killer
---
I don't think either of those are fair to force on the killer.
---
Or maybe just maybe they have wanted her weaker for a while now and have been looking for a way to do it? And high skilled survivors rarely make a stink about the Nurse, it's only the ones that can't outplay her which constantly bitch about her.
---
There is no serious Nurse that would exchange a few extra addons for a worse base. The base is what's most important here.
---
I agree totally!!! Thank you very much &lt;3
---
Yeah sometimes I’ll just say screw it and do that
---
Level your smurf :p grats tho
---
Save the Best for Last neither gains *nor loses* stacks for Ambush, which could work to a killer's advantage.
---
As to the original question, Ambush won't trigger Franklin's Demise.
---
Worse doesn't mean bad. You don't know how drastically they are changing it.
---
This is just fear mongering, you don't actually know anything but your trying to panic everyone.
---
Hehehe
---
If you are a FNAF fan this takes a different meaning.
---
If you're good and play aggressively and routinely bang out your hooks than it's absolutely good.  The players that would struggle with the perk are noed gamers and such.  People that aren't known for multi hooking all their survivors.  I've been doing work with Dying Light since it came out.  Really nice perk on Freddy.
---
Again that's the choice of the survivors. Killer has no say in whether they face SWF. If there was a button to not have them join my lobby I'd be down for whatever system they wanted to use for it.
---
no but that steve thats flickering a flashlight at me and trying to waste my time has
---
You literally got downvoted just for giving your opinion...
---
Something they should have put in the news, I know back in mid September they said the test was gonna be in October, but something like this should have been announced the moment it went live, not dropped in and and discovered by people, cause now they are gonna get a FLOOD of complaints from people with issues on both sides of the trials, had it been announced in the news that the testing is now live at least everyone knew what they were getting into and can provide proper feedback. My only complaint was their lack of taking 5-10 minutes to post an update to be displayed when the game launched stating dedicated server testing is now live
---
There needs to be an incentive for ranking down. As of right now for playing this game a bunch if you have a pip ratio higher then 50% then eventually you will get to the red ranks. Unfortunately there is zero benefit to being in red ranks aside from playing against more try hard players. Let's bring in certain skins only obtainable via the red ranks / or red rank quests only. #MakeTheRankingSystemLikeHearthstone
---
I am all for this, dope concept
---
Time to prestige!
---
Great now I'm going to get new survivors on SWF who waste my time. It ain't very fun to be on red ranks and play vs some rank 12+, I'd rather just not play that match because there's no fun in beating noobs.
---
Is this some sort of high rank joke I'm too low to understand.
---
Sent!
---
Can I get that info too
---
It's very good on strong killer players that regularly muti hook all their survivors.  It's terrible on killers that play to 1 hook people or those that rely on NOED for games.  Basically this perk can be top tier or shit tier based on your specific skill level and playstyle.
---

---
Ima say punkin now on
---
insta saw is based on his Rev Speed addons....and if you stack those with your idea, it would be insanely fast
---
lol
---
Dude you are changing what i am saying, you should aim to be always getting poinnts hooming someone, and then just face camping so they are for sure sacraficed is going to get you the fewest points for good reason, many think the obj is to lwt no one escape. When the onjective is to entertain the entoty, if you hook pne and thwn face camp tou can assure they are sacraficed, but then survivor had no fun and that was boring.
---
no problem
---
all good man :D
---
I can´t because my pc isnt that good to record
---

hey. i sended you :P
---
I’m a rank 6 survivor and I play shirtless David. I let the killer find me!
---
I see. that's good to hear. :)
---
The extra movement speed from our will seems quite strong. 115% + 24% max movement speed = 139%. For comparison, a sprint bursting survivor (or someone using lithe or balanced landing) has 150% movement speed. I guess the "lose all tokens on survivor death" part balances it out so you usually wont get to 8 tokens but the potential of this is insane. Still a good perk I suppose just dunno if it's balanced
---
I love your comment lol.
---
oh oh, you mean his almost instant rev up. Sorry dude, that's my bad for misunderstanding.
---
Well, it would've been, yeah. But right now, if we give him a 6% increase, he goes from 86.25% to 92.25%, which is JUST above Hillbilly at base...and Hillbilly already has that InstanSaw Add-on thing.
---
So is that a problem with Bubba?
---
Cool, sorry for not givin credits btw
---
Yea that's my point, maybe THEY have wanted to tweak her for awhile now. People complain about literally everything in this game, that doesn't mean every tweak is directly linked to those complaints.
---
You're just being over dramatic.
---
Nobody is denying she is getting nerfed but you're acting like it's the end of the world.
---
"Prepare yourself nurse mains, all your hard work, all the hours you've put into learning nurse, it's going to be taken away from you."
---
"If they can nerf nurse who knows whos next!!!"
---
Chill out and stop fear mongering.
---
Pretty much agree. Nurse and Spirit are usually fun to go against in my experience because of the mind game potential. Plague and Billy/Cannibal are much less so; their abilities to insta-down don't have counters other than being good at looping which in itself is not a fun mechanic. Either you're the better player and looping is easy which leads to a salty killer or they're better and its a short match. At least ghostface can be countered and Myers has a long cooldown comparatively.
---
Don’t you think you’d run into the situations where a killer can only find a SWF but not a solo game because the game is more fun to play with friends and there would be egregiously longer queue times for those who refused to play against a SWF group? 
---
The way I see it, SWF is the equivalent to a killers “power”. No survivor has a special ability or power to level the playing field - the best they have is to work together.
---
Did this happen?
---
Our will is way too strong, the condition for play with your food wastes the killer's time and tokens are easily lost, this one can be almost passive, and slugging means no downside. Aside from that it seems a really nice concept killer.
---
Someone must not have had the ranking system explained to them when the devs said "match the killer with the highest ranked survivor."
---
Baby Claude's? I've seen red ranks like this lol
---
I wish we had this on console 😢😪
---
Billy IS considered one of the best in the game. Obviously not above Nurse or Spirit, but he's right behind them.
---
That's not how it works now. The way it works currently is that its based off the highest ranked survivor. Your suggestion would actually be okay with me, but thats not how it goes. Right now both of your scenarios would theoretically get a rank 3 killer, assuming one is in matchmaking at the same time
---
:D
---
I don't know how anyone in their right mind puts Billy above Nurse or Spirit.  Good survivors can pallet loop the man into oblivion and turn him into an M1 killer that can just get to gens quickly.  Nurse will always be above him no addons required and Spirit is not far below her.
---
We are having dbd for mobile? Wow thats nice
---
I'm getting mixed answers for killer queues tho. I've asked on steam, dead by daylight forums and this and i've gotten so many mixed answers like these. People say that it depends on the time, region etc. but I'm thinking it's something on my end possibly but no one seems to know.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
That's my point, that's what people are suggesting and it's bad, it's what we had before, and it lead to premades abusing lower ranked killers.
---
&gt; I just think it's absurd to get this bent out of shape on rumors that are all here say until the devs release an official announcement and PTB
---
A freakin dev said her base is getting nerfed on their own forums. How much more official do you need it to be? Do you think the dev is playing games with players' of the Nurse?
---
&gt; Even whatever they announce doesn't mean anything because it still gets put through a ptb to make sure the changes make sense.
---
The changes are coming at the PTB per their own words. Whether it goes through to the live version is all that remains. But for the PTB next week/two weeks from now a NERFED base for the Nurse will be there. You may not think that those nerfed changes are going to the live version, but there is more than enough reason to be skeptical that they will go through with just minor number changes as that has been the case more often than not for anything that they've been a long period of time "reworking".
---
"when they jump the pallet back"
---
It's the best feeling of 'GOTCHA' ever
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dcvus7/what_is_the_best_perk_biuld_for_stealth_claudette/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
He's good but I don't really mind playing against him. He's nowhere near as annoying to play against as nurse and spirit.
---
Nobody cares. I killed 4 before a single gen = I'm too good for this rank = get me out of this rank. No one wants to let everyone have fun in low ranks just to be able to get out of them. getting punished with less bloodpoints is fine, but getting punished with less pips is straight up the opposite of what should be happening
---
You cant heal someone with a medkit
---
Just take IT ;)
---
No, you can't use a medkit.
---
Also, healing a Survivor with another won't give you the full progression towards SW, only around half.
---
I just did it  [https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz](https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz)
---
All I want in the game is for killers powers to have alternate VFX.
---
Hatchets to match whatever axe huntress is using.
---
Any number of the head traps in the saw series for pig.
---
Different colored vommies for vommy mommy.
---
Different gas colors for clown, maybe trap shapes or confetti for hag traps.
---
Minor things that don't change the game, but I don't think it could work for every kilelr.
---
Can we just take note that he has a bottle of Drugs as a drink?
---
There arent any true infinites unless the vault is bugged
---
Keep in mind you essentially have to go on a scavenger hunt for your obsession every time you want to get a stack. That makes it so the perk doesn't actually hit 8 stacks as quickly as you might think.
---
I did it  [https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz](https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz)
---
that's the contrary you should have meant to say.
---
It does not work anymore in high rank :D
---
Im proud
---
I think we may have seen that infrequently when queue times were awful and the search restrictions would loosen up a bit but I don't think it was common.  Then again, I'm not a yellow rank killer so I can't say for sure.  I'll admit I don't typically pay attention to ranks when I'm playing killer because I know if I play enough I'm going to be red rank so there generally isn't anyone I'd be upset about having played.  However, it is extremely noticeable now when I'm getting pretty regular matches against groups with 1-2 red ranks then 2-3 green or lower.  The yellow or gray/brown rank players I've been going up against with their red rank friends are genuinely new to the game.  I try to be nice to them as to not completely ruin their experience as the current matchmaking system seems to be aiming to do but at the same time I want my points so there's a limit.
---
Now it makes sense. Either way, I ended up "prestiged" him.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz](https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz)
---
I know, spirit will always be the mind game queen
---
I want Kate so bad
---
Or you can just get on gens. Unless it's Nurse or Spirit you don't need to heal.
---
Wow so the medkit does not give any progression at all toward the perk? I feel it should say that in the description like it does for solidarity and autodidact
---
If people could stop upvoting them maybe it would stop
---
A few days ago, some people on both r/deadbydaylight and r/leaksbydaylight claimed they got a Youtube notification about a video from the DBD channel about Pennywise that got taken down seconds later. 
---
There were also posts about it on the forum, which were *mysteriously* deleted.
---
But who knows. We don't. Maybe in a few months, though?

Stop asking for the prestige. I just did it.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz](https://imgur.com/gallery/1SBY1Mz)
---
With like 50 safe pallets on The Game? Yeah, I rarely heal anyway, he'll get looped for days.
---
Moris are bullshit
---
This is reddit all memes are garbage
---
Wow thanks for the info, it should definitely say that in the description.
---
Unfortunately that's  never going to happen :(
---
head on is aight when paired with that one that lets u heal inside a locker
---
idk how she fits into one cuz them cheeks
---
People are saying they got a notification for the next chapter and it just so happen to say Pennywise also they deleted posts on the forums talking about it so yea
---
Nope, if you have to tell someone it's a joke, it isn't. Ask any comedian.
---
If she stops to phase. Ignore that pallet and run to the next.
---
Dude I started playing two weeks ago I don't know what fucken perks people use.
---
Dammit, they made a Stranger Things chapter.
---
When I think I'm out... they puuuuuull me back in.
---
I want this killer
---
Scratch mark jukes?
---
Someone remake this with the text saying 'red robin' for the killer. And the line that follows for the victim. PLEASE. I PROMISE YOU WILL GET UPVOTES!
---
He's no higher than third.  Nurse and Spirit are the power roles in their games and can do very well even against strong swf groups.  They're the only 2 killers in game that can't be looped.  Nurse definitely can't and only average to weak Spirits can be.  
---
Billy on the other hand can be turned into a trapper with all broken traps by strong survivors.  He can be made into a basic M1 killer very easily.  The ones that go for saws at pallet loops just give X amount of additional free safe loops everytime they attempt it.  I rarely allow saws in the games I play against Billy's.  They're typically making me eat that mace over the course of our chases together.  
---
He's still got the insane mobility to get from gen to gen and an instadown though so I don't think he's worse than third but I think people putting them higher are crazy or on console and discounting Nurse on there since she isn't seen nearly as often (though I disagree that this should affect her place in the rankings).  If a killer is the best killer out in the woods but nobody's around to hear her make a sound she's still the best killer imo even on console.  And you do play red rank nurses on PS4 that know what they're doing and can run shit like their PC counterparts.  Played 2 of them yesterday.
---
Agree with them and tell them to have a nice day, they never reply
---
&gt; Honestly i'm going to get shanked for this but i'm all for tanking her walking speed (meaning the counter-play of not getting seen initially is easier for smarter players that will anticipate where a nurse is going to blink to, but escaping her is stil extremely difficult once she sees you), or reducing her blink to one
---
You will deserve the metaphorical shanking. She's the slowest walking killer in the game and it sounds like you would be ok with her coming to a complete stand-still after she blinks, or making it so that she can only blink once and rely on her slow ass movement speed to make up for it. You basically want the killer to get Legion-ed.

Uh, I've been running Self Care since 2016.  What am I supposed to do instead?
---
All this says is they're postponed unless I'm missing something. Not trying to argue, I'm genuinely confused
---
Cant you jusy buy the cursed kimono or schoolgirl cosmetics?
---
I think last seal needs a rework of survivors break they , they are under the blindness effect for 120 secs at tier 3 making it like a trapped hex totem
---
I feel ya
---
19 so far! 😁
---
I read the half and there was nothing, so I scrolled and saw nothing.. what's wrong with you? You should be politician
---
However I’m more in it for the bp not the pip
---
Empathy and Self Care contradict each other. I suggest replacing Self Care with Iron Will.
---
That sub is hilarious.
---
Nor did I say what the nerfs were going to be did I? I just said she's getting nerfed, which is a fact said by the devs themselves. You're the one that acts like I went into specifics. I said she's getting nerfed - and it's a fact.
---
It was not just the queue that loosened up the restrictions, if the host of the SWF was the lowest ranked the game tended to put the group against killers near the host's rank. The point is the system didn't worked the way it was supposed to work half of the time, and then it was the killers who had their experience ruined by the matchmaking. You had enough posts in this sub bitching about the matchmaking for the mods to make a rule about them.
---
I didn’t even know that wth
---
You're just assuming that they're caving into demands from survivors, theres nothing to back that up. They don't need to be top level players to balance the game, they have internal numbers that i would assume play the biggest factor into how they balance the game.
---
Sure
---
I feel like this sub is usually just memes if you sort by Hot. There may have been more topics with gameplay related content around the DLC drop because a lot of people were interested in it, but most of the gameplay related stuff doesn't make it to the top. I usually browse by New a few times a day, and that makes things a bit easier.
---
No Mither. Needs to have you start healthy, not show the broken effect, make the iron will effect 100%, and give bonus bloodpoints.
---
Are you on console?
---
U are right ill do next time... fuck me...
---
MCotes helping the killer I knew it.
---
Spirit is overpowereddddd when exit gates are powered
---
Maybe not on all of pc? Because earlier in the day i also didn't get that pop up message ingame for testing and pings still went up and down.
---
Iron Will, Calm Spirit, Sprint Burst/BL, Distortion
---
I'm rank 1 on pc currently, not many people play her..i'm seeing Spirits, Freddy and Billy
---
I'm dumb.
---
I've got to admit, I'm confused about why trapper can't just walk through his traps all the time. It's not like hag sets off her own traps by running over them.
---
She knew one day Micheal would escape, so she bought the house and upgraded it so that when the day did come she can finally face the monster of her past.
---
Oh god please no please Chucky scared me shirtless as a kid. I will uninstall
---
Good eye!
---
Personally I'd run urban immersion, fixated, quick and quick and maybe lithe/sprint burst in case you get spotted. BL isnt bad either though.
---
Last seal? You mean third seal?
---
Yeah third seal , my bad
---
I run Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Iron Will for my stealth build. Usually do We'll Make It as the 4th because I like making saves, but you can replace that with something like Calm Spirit/Lightweight/etc for just a stealth build
---
&gt;Our new launch target for PC and consoles is Fall 2019. We will be running tests on the live build of the game, on PC only, starting in early October.
---
bottom half of the paragrah.
---
they started live testing on oct first
---
The pings going up and down is cause they dont work.
---
Wake Up, Vigil, No One Left Behind, Hope, Camaraderie, Mettle of Man, Slippery Meat, Sole Survivor, No Mither.
---
I cant believe b8 this bad actually worked
---
Oh I'm dumb thanks
---
Urban evasion (classic), iron will, spine chill, and as last you could have an emergency button like sprint burst or something like lightweight
---
Please do. Just work through it, it’s worth it.

1 out of 5 queues as Killer are 100+ ping games and the rest are 450+. Played a 100 ping match, because I really wanted to finish a daily, huge delay on kicking pallets and generators, as well as hooking survivors.

All survivors have to pet the doggo and gib treats and nuggers. If giben no treats or nuggers the survivor instantly dies.

Giant Spider that can crawl above you with 0 terror radius
---
Don't forget about how they cry that borrowed time is somehow over powered. Both perks would never activate if you weren't a stones throw away from the hook to begin with. Then they want to cry that they never pip up or get any points. Quit campin. Simple. Cause me and my friends are just gonna do gens while you sit there losing points being near the hook.

I've got 2 dailies for myers right now:  level up evil within 4 times and kill someone by my hand.  I've been putting it off, even though i could easily get over 100k in one game..
---
I guess it's about time to get drunk and pull out a mori.
---
You don't outplay a Nurse, you take advantage of their mistakes and try to make them mess up.
---
If a Nurse just blinks after you (doesn't try to cut you off or predict you) and doesn't mess up, you're just dead. Even if they do mess up they get to retry in 2-4 seconds. 
---
Also, there's no indication her base kit is getting nerfed; slight changes doesn't 100% mean nerf. Wait until the changes are revealed to complain.
---
You aren't supposed to be powerful as survivor. It's an asymmetrical game the entire idea is that it isn't a level playing field.
---
Why would they even do that? It's litereally just something they want you to find, bring it back to their booth and you will get some merch. Don't think it's anything else.
---
R/wholesomememes
---
Oh my god you run self care, what a loserrrrr
---
It really depends on how close both players are to a server, and if the killer pulls some shit. I don't run across many games where the connection turns to crap mid match, so most of the time I don't mind a killer host. We'll have to see what connections are like when the servers launch - I suspect that some people will notice an improvement, while others will wish they were on the old system. It's difficult to come up with a solution that works for everyone.
---
100 upvotes but no comments. Amazing
---
Because if you drop the pallet, you essentially get god mode against almost every killer. Unless they break the pallet, there is no way they can bloodlust or mindgame you forcing the killer to break it and lose bloodlust in order to catch you
---
On pc - weird, I see Nurses often. The three you mentioned, Nurse, and Myers are the ones I see more often than not when I play survivor. Can't say you're lying though. I guess you're lucky?
---
I mean I got that it was a joke
---
Like The Spirit?
---
Welcome to how survivors have played since the beginning when the host has anything less than 1 gig down
---
Bubbas sister?
---
Too real
---
not really, was thinking of something like the movie curse of la llarona, like invisible forces yeeting people and jumpscares because well its a jumpscare

Edit: but not like jumpscare myers tho that is pretty spooky

That’s too real, bro. :/
---
Lmao

PC
---
I see russians with spirits and billy all the damn time, maybe im just unlucky i have no idea. i'd rathe fight nurse so the match finishes quicker
---
I *could* if I had the money. I don’t have any money.
---
Things that can’t be stopped like that wig me out. ... Like the Nurse. You can’t escape her. D:
---
I can think of plenty of reasons.
---
lol yeah, godly nurses are the spookiest, tho baby nurses are fun to bully but i feel bad after
---
I'd be down with a Zombie killer that eats brains but can move at normal speed even. He could have some plaque abilities among other Zombie related perks.
---
Still gonna angrily mumble and call you a dick while i'm running after you though
---
im getting the spirit and jake skin as fast as possible when the event starts
---
You have a slightly higher chance of getting better stuff in the bloodweb with each prestige as well as the cosmetic helping make you look darker with certain killers and survivors.
---
Was a clown nerf announced ?
---
Yeah most players I've seen that have problems as hag place traps reactively &lt;ie in common loop spots&gt; to start chases instead of reading the game and putting them in places where it will benefit her after a chase has started.
---
No but knowing bhvr they're gonna nerf everyone expect Nurse and Spirit
---
Or you can assume i was telling the truth and dedicated servers weren't live yet for my region but they are now? Now i'm getting 46-48 ping. Feels great. No more home turf advantage.
---
This is true, but at least you don't have to continuously dodge 300 ms lobbies until you settle for a 140 ms 5 lobbies later, especially with how long rank 1 survivor queues are at the moment... And the other way around as well, you don't have to wait long in queue again if the killer dodges you.
---
Yea, I experienced a bug similar, it not the same thing. The healing option didnt pop up at all so we couldn't heal, we also couldn't struggle, nor, as your friend could've experienced couldnt we contest the hook bar
---
&gt; The Nurse you've spent hundreds and thousands of hours finally getting a good grasp of
---
This is how I felt when freddy got a change
---
I can't help but feel you are overeacting a bit though.
---
Same thing was happening to me some time around/after midnight. Happened 4/5 times in a row, and another time after I checked my internet connection. Idk.
---
She has a handprint on her booty
---
I don’t think making his power more powerful in the Endgame is better for him. I think the problem is he can’t hit survivors in time after the slow movement speed and chainsaw rev time and he doesn’t have a good game slow down. I think after what we have seen with Freddy and demogorgon, bubba should have a reworked power and have 2 components to it. BHVR has figured out what works, let’s embrace that.
---
I've escaped against plenty of spirits too.  There run of the mill.  The good ones hear standard breathing, blades of moving grass etc....you can tell which one you're facing after the first loop or two.  There is exceedingly little counterplay against a strong Spirit with a headset.  Even the leading killer streamers when playing survivor will usually say shit like "fun and interactive killer" in their games lol.  Without Iron Will you're basically shit out of luck if they're strong.  And I don't like the idea of having to run a perk just to counter a single killer that kind of requires it for counterplay.
---
He asked for both. I gave half the answer that no one else was giving him.
---
I get that those dailies are very nice for BP, but they don't make moris any less bullshit. I just mori someone on death hook.

Newest Killer - The Dollmaker
---
Power - Infantile Cry: The Dollmaker can attach 6 baby dolls to any wall or low ceiling on the map. If a survivor comes within 36 meters of the doll the doll loudly shrieks, giving the killer a sound notification causing the survivor to be deafened and oblivious for the next 7 seconds. Once the doll is triggered, the killer has to pick up the doll and reset it. A doll going off also cancels actions such as repairing generators, healing, searching chests, etc.
---
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE "MADE WITH MEMATIC" PARODY AND IT ANNOYS ME. THAT IS HILARIOUS
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
Oh?
---
oh lol sorry, i only read the archive part sorry
---
Ah Russians. I'm in the U.S. so I can't say I have a lot of experience with em. I sometimes play late at night on off days, but my work keeps my sleep schedule pretty set. I do hope with the dedicated servers that we are able to branch out and select different servers to play on so that I can experience survivors/killers from other regions more often. Would love to play against more EU and Asia players.
---
Have you tried unplugging and plugging them back in? Worked for me.
---
ONE OF THESE DAYS WE WILL NEVER SURRENDERRRRRRRR!!
---
We need one that says
---
 ‘Disappoint your entire team of survivor(s) as Claudette’ 
---
-30,000 BPs
---
Or you could play a savior build and make sure you go down before anybody else. Also Kill your friends is kinda an already solution for unranked playing. You just need 5 people. But it would be nice if there were servers with lobbies, with information, so that we had at least some options. Lately I'm just thankful when I'm not crashing and actually getting a match. Kinda sad for a game this mature.
---
What's an Archive and Rift and what does it mean by tentative below it?
---
Something like the grudge or that contorts and crawls (more than spirit) with her throat noise.
---
Imagine the grudge and she has an ability that she can lunge but her lunge is crawling super fast towards you like how Demo’s lunge works. Would cry.
---
"hard capped at only finding 6 above or below a rank"
---
Ace lower than Quentin? Excuse me, he is a walking meme.

Might as well say “dying alone and being forgotten easily” is the new killer.

I like your style
---
* Each level of devotion should allow you to hold an additional 100k BP (Credit to Tru).
---
* Trappers should start the round with more, if not all of his traps.
---
* Bubba needs some love.  Leatherface shouldn’t be a terrible meme.  At the very least he should be able to cancel his chainsaw.
---
* Bloodpoint earn rate needs a slight buff or we need to see more consistent 2x events.  There are too many survivors/killers and perks to keep up at this point.

The biggest problems with this game rn is the hatch design and the totem spawn.
---
Actually, yes, I literally just explained why billy's chainsaw allows you to get to a survivor in a dead spot. By the time you hear the terror radius billy is already there. Here's the math: billy's terror radius is 32 meters. With base chainsaw, he travels 9.2 meters per second, faster with add ons. In less than 4 seconds billy is already there when you hear his heartbeat. You also have to consider that depending on LOS survivors wont know where to run to get some distance, meanwhile survivors can do so since they know where freddy's gonna teleport. Meanwhile as soon as blood appears on your gen can hide, you cant do that with billy as there's little warning. Freddy's teleport in some situations may be FASTER than billy's, but it's not nearly as versatile. Freddy can teleport to generators, but that's his range of motion. Billy can capitalize on healing hiding survivors, survivors urban evasioning on different areas on the map as well.  Even if he fakes it it only saves about 2 seconds which is about useless. Also, freddy's dream pallets against good survivors are much worse than dream snares. If they're going to a pallet location with a dream pallet then they're essentially going to a dead spot which would guarantee a hit anyways. I propose that if you're breaking that many pallets wirh freddy those areas would guarantee a chainsaw for billy if he broke the same amount of pallets. Also, insta downing survivors is more common than you seem to think. Any situation in which you get a hit while right on top of them by is a situation in which you'll get a chainsaw hit. Will this happen all the time? No. But in the scenarios I mentioned above, it's likely to happen. Also, billy maintains map pressure even during endgame. Freddy's map pressure is basically nonexistent after all the gens are done.

Nurse and Spirit you'll basically have no chance to see them coming and devise a strategy for escape. Other killers, at least you'll hear or see them.
---
Also, people need to stop thinking about self-heal in terms of how much time it takes compared to being healed and think of it in terms of efficiency.  Is sitting in a corner of the map self-healing the most **OPTIMAL** thing you could be doing to increase the odds of you and your team escaping? 99% of the time the answer is NO.
---
What does SWF mean?? I don’t really know the terms
---
and what are The Canine perks? or lore? im interested.
---
To be fair you are playing as a group vs a killer. You have the advantage to use comms so having a little "harder" time isn't much. Hell rank means nothing anyway.
---
I came to mention the grudge! She is probably the most terrifying to me since Michael when I was little. The throat sound, the crawl, the face, it was a perfect combination.
---
At least you saved one lol
---
Who pissed in your cornflakes?
---
Ruin for early game (Corrupt intervention would be fine) 
---
Discordance for finding people 
---
Pop for late game
---
Save the Best for Last, though I think its worth mentioning that if you are trying to save tokens by shredding your obsession be careful you don't waste more time than you save. (or use anything you like really, I was using infectious fright for a bit. The synergy btw pop and thrilling tremors could also be good.) 
---
If someone is full on in the open at the tail end of your lunge reach, best option is to wait for them to stop looking or bait out the direction change with a lil mouth flair. Half the time I find the bait is enough to just go in for a safe normal swing. Most survivors will dodge you in the same direction, so if you can learn the person you can predict them.I'm not 100% confident with my lunges yet so those are the best tips I can give. RN I'm just trying to get the timing down and mostly find myself eating pallets with it. LOL come to think of it, the most success I had with lunging was on the stairs of the game, or point blank to finish my daily.
---
I scrolled though the comments just to see if anyone commented on this. Thank you.

A guy ran up and down the street stabbing people just the other day, spree killings and serial killings aren’t new they are just more serious subjects right now because of how common they’ve become, not advocating for a spree shooter in the game tho that would suck

---
Not as disappointed as legion mains
---
Well when they don’t have the experience and only play it when I play it so we have something to do together it’s not fun for him to go against these killers that have extensive knowledge of the game and know every loop and how to counter it when he has just a few base perks and doesn’t know how to loop and can hardly do gems well. So it’s a balancing issue
---
Oh nice, I can finally find good games without the same people each time. And more then 3 people on Fallout 76.
---
Pretty much sums it up for vigil.
---
Oh I'd love that. I am an extremely competitive killer. I even get upset when someone finds the hatch. They'd love me, I'd give them lots of salt to complain about.
---
No one left behind has to be the most pointless perk right now
---
She can see where you are running. she can catch up quickly.
---
There really isn't a way for everyone to win in this situation. You pretty much covered it. I'm rank 11 and my brother is rank 3. We play all the time, and I get destroyed a lot because I'm just not that good. We're not trying to game the system and roflstomp some kid on his first match, we're just genuinely trying to have fun by playing together. I can't think of a better solution though. It's only us two, so KYF isn't an option either.
---
I guess my connection is just shittier than I thought
---
Ima few words now on

You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back

Pinhead or a jump scare demon.  I’d love to see some truly grotesque, scary designs with haunting audio.
---
I didn't btw. I appreciate the translation though!
---
I mean yeah, take the hit and get a 2nd loop out of her.
---
Didn't even notice. Thanks for the info.
---
Oh boy I sure love playing the Game map on Nurse I hope nothing bad happens when I'm chasing the last survivor
---
I absolutely agree with that, but what I think Bubba lacks in is mobility and gen pressure. He's good at winning a game by camping, and unfortunately his power plays into that.
---
It's something that's been an issue, because how do you fix it without making him too much like Billy?
---
But I can appreciate what you're saying here; I've just have had trouble seeing where they could fix him, or how they can change him. So took a stab at it, this is the best I've come up with so far.
---
But yeah, being stronger towards the end of a game isn't necessarily the best design, either...as Freddy's original perk design was like that. So any thoughts on how he could be improved?
---
I had a killer call me “pay to win” because I was wearing a P3 Claudette outfit... only thing I spent to get that was bloodpoints lol
---
From the news section when you start the game “We’ve recently enabled a dedicated servers test on the live PC environment. We’d appreciate any feedback on your experience with them in our pc dedicated server survey”

What's wrong with running sc?
---
Prayer beads are an add on. Multiple killers have OP add ons. And just run to a pallet. Just cause a killer cant be ran for 3 gens doesnt make them OP.

Actual footage of me attempting any kind of looping strategy

Gens, Iron will, have adrenaline, not waste an entire minute that could otherwise be used for the good of the team.
---
&gt;  The fart has to exist first before we can talk about how much it smells.
---
Not gonna lie, that gave me a chuckle. I'll take a couple of breaths and go have a sandwich or something. All sorts of ways they could nerf her went through my head when I read when Peanits said. A bigger fatigue, some sort of meter with an extended cooldown, etc. It's like I said regarding the Hag that just by making her traps take 3 seconds shorter in time bumped her up from a poor killer to a damn near great one. Seconds are so important to killers and the thought of her having seconds less of something just pisses me off since I'm sure it'll make her so much worse.
---
Do you remember back when they had that pallet/instant flashlight fiasco a few years ago and the Nurse could have a pallet dropped on her mid-blink just because? Yeahhhhh shit like that went through my head. They reverted that change in a hotfix but made sure to say that it was something they were going to implement in the future once other pallet changes were ironed out. I dread nonsense like that when they speak of changes to the Nurse's base. If it was just nerfs for addons I wouldn't be so pessimistic since the base is what's most important to a killer and she'd at least be tied with Spirit for best killer still. Now I'm over here thinking that they'll make her worse than Billy/Freddy.
---
I do hope you all are right though and that they prove me wrong. I want to be wrong badly on this.
---
It’s a solid perk when you first start out since survivors are usually clueless potatoes.  After say 50-100 hours you should be using something else as it’s a big time waster, especially with perks like SB being used on killers.
---
Lmao pooted
---
I got that notification this morning
---
Unhooked a feng earlier today, killer nowhere near. She used self care for her entire state as I waved at her to let me heal her......
---
We don't know that, the only evidence we have is a very spurious claim that people got a sub box notification for him and the fact that they're following Steven King.

Mostly you won't even notice SWF's because people generally aren't that good. But when you see the tell-tale signs of one of those coordinated groups of skilled players (4 flashlight Bills, blendette squad, etc.), sometimes you gotta break out the mori to keep your sanity in check and have a chance to win.
---
Yep, please do. The reason it was stopped was because they were planning on rolling out a lower-cost option, and the PS3 BC was achieved by basically sticking a whole PS2 into it. Way cheaper to cut that and just tell people they can still buy the older consoles.

Also not a accurate representation of how most games go as you shouldn't be chasing survivors if it takes more than 30 seconds to down them.
---
Jffhdkfidj yes people not getting sarcasm is me trying to be badass
---
I just can’t level character past 50 if I haven’t prestiged them yet. It feels wrong for some reason.
---
Or a Millennial killer who can drink soy to put himself into Oestrogen Overload Overlord Mode and throw his joycons at survivors immediately downing boomers

Really now...

But there was this 99-ed Ace with "elite" in his name that kept staring at me at the gate, thinking he was safe. I one-shotted him. He DCd.  
---
Cue silent Ghostface laughter.
---
Survive with friends
---
This hurt to watch.
---
Yes...
---
That's why this is a text post with 483 words of context and explanations.
---
Refusing to continue any chase that lasts longer than 30 seconds is a terrible approach. "Oh darn, you ran me to two jungle gym pallets, both of which you dropped immediately. Whelp, that's 30 seconds, I should really get going now and *not* convert this time I've already spent into a down".
---
Outplayed.
---
Damn this is a good template.
---
Yh and dbd is the most toxic community, because we get all the other rejects from other communities. So welcome my friend.
---
Kinda had something like this just happen. A rank 13, two 17s, and a 20 versus me, a rank 14 hillbilly (not normally one) with two perks. Rank 13 DC'd one rank 17 and the 20 died (rest in peace Dwight I'm sorry) and the other 17 found the hatch
---
I... what?
---
because of matchmaking now they prob want to derank so they can play with friends. the change just encourage people to derank
---
As someone brand new to the game I find it's just as toxic as Lol Smite overwatch and those sorts.
---
I remember my second game as a killer I was called all sorts of names, told I was bad, etc.
---
This childish behaviour ruins the game.
---
Nurse's Calling + Dummies who heal on the hook is the easiest way to nab people if you haven't already found someone when they're unhooked.
---
Its fucking shite!!! im so pissed off with people just giving up because they are the first survivor to get caught
---
Edit: I’ve dropped two ranks today because of quitters and people who give up
---
I had to quit playing Overwatch as it was just getting too toxic so I see what you mean. This game is getting nearly as bad!
---
I would like a general buff to killers that helps them deal with gen speeds.
---
That's going to be a monster against people who counter by doubling back
---
I wouldn't entirely agree, have you tried playing billy? He isn't super complicated, granted, but he still has a pretty steep learning curve for his sprint
---
(Mind you, it's still useful even if you can't land it, it's a good tool for maneuvering either way, which is mainly why he's actually viable at red ranks)
---
Healing is all kinds of bugged (and has been for awhile), I just got a game last night where the person in the SWF (we were a two-man) simply could not get a heal prompt on me, but other survivors could heal me.
---
Sometimes you *do* still have to sprint to cancel a heal, sometimes it cancels even when you're not moving or trying to move. Sometimes you cannot cancel the heal even by sprinting, and have to do one of the emotes (pointing usually) in order to break out of it.
---
And other times you cannot cancel the heal no matter what, period, ever.
---
If pointing doesn't work, you're trapped, and sometimes it won't.
---
No but its two opposite sides, cant please both. So if it goes back to the average system or whatever you're gonna be getting baby killers that aren't terrible but not good enough to win. So high rank players just bully tf out of them. But this is the most important bit. The killer has no control on the games they get, they have to put up with bullshit constantly, whereas your friends can play by themselves where its easier, or with you where its harder. Your argument just lacks points like the killer shouldnt suffer because you wanna swf with a new player.
---
I mean there are words, but I don't know how they translate on the graph. Lol
---
bruh some1 was doing that gen behind you.
---
&gt; I get that this may be a usual event for some people but that alone doesn’t make it right.
---
I'm not too sure what moral dilemma you're dealing with, but it sounds like the survivors emotionally manipulated you and it worked perfectly. Simply pressing CTRL or 1 on your keyboard was enough for you to not play your best, get angry, and then come on here to rant.
---
At the end of the day, it's a multiplayer game. Every multiplayer game experiences toxicity, it's just a fact of life. Dota, LoL, CSGO, Apex, Rocket League, etc... all have the same issues. 
---
Psychology is a factor in every single game you will ever play. If I teabag you, and it throws you off your game, that's a win situation for me because you're going to be playing worse as a result. Do I condone what people say in post game chat? Hell no. I've had my fair share of 'go kill yourself' and 'insert racial slur here' as I was playing killer. That is what needs to be fixed, but teabagging? That stays. 
---
If you can't handle psychological warfare, then that's not the games problem.
---
It depends on the person playing rather than the rank.
---
I usually fly between 9 and 4 rank level (survivor) and I'm pretty chill, I don't BM, it ruins the experience for both parties, I always put a gg with a smiley face in the chat and so on.
---
Higher ranks means that people tend to play more seriously, which can result in more toxic behaviour.
---
I don't think that "High rank = toxic" is correct, but sweaty players are mostly in high ranks.
---
Nah man, you worded it fine. People are actually dumb for assuming that you meant Bill was being toxic by healing above you. You literally made the distinction that he **was** *previously* being toxic, before he decided to heal himself. That's both a verb tense and a signalling word indicating a sequential relationship, not a causal one.
---
Survivors bitching that they can't bully low ranked killers anymore should be greatful they can play with their low ranked friends at all despite a large gap in their ranks. 
---
You're the ones choosing to play with friends whose rank is so different from your own. You and your friends should have to bare the burden for choosing to play together, not the killer who has no choice and is already at a disadvantage going against SWF.
---
Because before they would dc with no penalty.  If people do it often, now they get banned for a week or whatever so instead, if they knocked down first, they’ll unhook and die.  At least with dc’ing, they wouldnt get blood points and not give a killer a bbq stack
---
Iirc there’s a 100fps limit.
---
This is the kind of attitude that perpetuates these problems.
---
This is a videogame meant for fun. Psychological warfare??? Like wtf is wrong with you

Ok, but why do I want it?
---
Spine Chill lets me know with every killer except T1 Myers. Combined with Auto-Didact, I'm triggered when I don't get my heals through.
---
that is why no one likes playing solo really the event that is coming up will make that even worse. but off-topic word of advice when the event does happen finish killer first or you will regret it honestly
---
That merely makes the problem invisible
---
I disagree, I think the only buff No Mither needs is reduce the grunts of pain you make by 100% instead of 50%. Also Iron Will does not need bonus bp.
---
My killer matches go like "You load into a match and lose, then go play as survivor because at least then you stand a chance"
---
I just went against a 4man swf, I knew what I was getting into as their names were all the same like Mr and mrs blah blah. Anyway I went into this game at rank 3 as a lvl 24 wraith, as I just felt like playing him, pffft we all know wraith isnt great but especially one without a build. But the abuse in end game was insane as I killed 2 of them. Literally every excuse in the book. Most solo queues are better, like when they die they can respect it and just say GG move on but in a swf they gotta try impress their friends.
---
LOL omg
---
Time for another pig nerf
---
Yeah no worries man! Hopefully you can experience it for yourself soon.
---
I'd really love to see it! Although the quality would probably a little less than normal if they worked on all three at the same time :/
---
If you play doctor you’re gayy
---
I'm a P3 hillbilly main he is extremely easy to pick up and even if you can't land chainsaws being able to go from one side of the map to the other in a couple seconds is incredibly power which the nurse can also do but unlike her, he is still has  115%  movement speed hes easy to pick up and play and compared to the nurse he's easy to master
---
jakes is better than both of last year's survivors.
---
That's what I do the survivors was body blocking too
---
Used to be just get a 4k, but now you have to go through hell
---
I don't see why most of those need changes as they all have specific functions that they serve. Not every perk needs to be "top-tier". Lol
---
It made me more angry
---
Honestly, I cant be fucked to read all that, but I love desmos, helps me with my Maths A level so I can respect the grind of the visual representation of how fucked gens are.
---
Your not my father!
---
Plague gets an exhaustion cool-down after each throw up (like she pauses to wipe her mouth or something) like Nurse.
---
Who wants to bet it was a fake pallet too
---
"Remaining generator time on Y" and "Time elapsed" on X. Thought that was somewhat obvious, but I'll throw some Axis labels on there just to be sure.
---
Why Flip Flop l, territorial, and Boil Over? They are good for what they are supposed to do.
---
Nancy's new perk, think it's called Inner Strength or something. Pop a totem anytime for a quick heal later on. Rinse and repeat. At least then you're helping cleanse Hexes or potential NOED.
---
now im just someone ripping their shirt off out of fear instead of, yknow, normal reactions to fear lol
---
I think it would be interesting if they gave you a choice between the two. That being said I wouldn't know which to choose since on one hand, in how it was I would always get eviscerated by faux rank 15-19 and a rank 1 but now I swear that all of my competition is a bunch of comatose potatoes who just started playing and I feel bad about being a killer
---
I am sad that you think insulting anyone over a game is a sound idea.
---
I'm rank 2, before the dedicated servers I was getting decent matchmaking, now I'm getting at least 1 red rank then either greens or yellows. Like the struggle is real, just not fun. I'd just go on killer If i were you.
---
You are not just a clown.
---
Interesting concept. Would you have a longer cooldown for longer charged vomits?
---
To be fair, in a match like that you still probably got more points then half of them anyway
---
The dev looks like Dwight.
---
Well, when you have 2 people hooked and the other 2 survivors choose to do gens while allowing their teammates to reach struggle, you could call it gen rush. 
---
When you have 2 injured survivors working on a generator that didn't have any progress instead of taking the time to heal even when the game is in the early stage (5 gens remaining), you could also call it gen rush.
---
Is it wrong? No. They are just doing their objective but at the same time, they are ignoring other available objectives.
---
When the killer doesn't know how to pressure or catch survivors and all the gens are done after their first chase, that killer is just bad.
---
Death is not an escape - even for the killer.
---
Monstrous shrine, also No One Left Behind is useful for games where you weren't able to enough altruism to pip, also nice against killers that  camp in the endgame.
---
I'm not too sure why you're getting so defensive and immediately downvoting, but I'll assume you can't handle a simple discussion. I'll reply once, and leave it as that because I don't think you'll be saying anything worthwhile.
---
This is not an attitude, it's a way of life. Everything you do has psychology in it; asking someone out, becoming friends with someone, understanding our emotions, how to control our emotions, etc... all of this is psychology based, it's just a fact of life.
---
Notice in my comment how I said I DON'T CONDONE post-game chat, because I truly believe you missed that part. Like I said, post-game chat is horrific at times. As a killer, I simply mute the chat and go to the next game. I don't want to read what people write because some of that shit is seriously so messed up, and BHVR does nothing about it. I reported someone who kept saying the n-word to me and telling me to kill myself over and over in the post game chat. Took screenshots, video, their steam profile, you name it! What did BHVR do? Nothing. They literally did not do a single thing about it, they didn't even get back to me either.
---
&gt; This is a videogame meant for fun
---
You don't get to decide what video games are. IF I decide to play Dota and play it competitively, then that's how I define the game. If you play it for fun, then that's how you define the game. We each play the game the way we want to, and that's that. Video games mean a lot of things to a lot of people, just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean you have to get pissy about it.
---
&gt;  Psychological warfare??? Like wtf is wrong with you
---
Sweetheart, there's nothing wrong with psychological warfare. It's the nature of competition, you do anything you can to get an advantage. If I throw you off your game by simply pressing CTRL, then that's a win for me because you're going to end up playing worse. If you can't handle multiplayer gaming, then that's your own fault. You don't get to decide what this game is, and you don't get to decide how people should / should not act.
---
You've mostl lost the game if the exit gates are open, so it doesn't matter.
---
When survivors miss the skillcheck, they immediately die.
---
The devs would agree with me.
---
Yes. Survivors aren't like that unless a spirit is phasing.
---
Oh look! If you actually read the [Demogorgon Lore](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/The_Demogorgon)  you’ll see it has no gender. 
---
How does it feel not only to be wrong, but be an asshole?You can’t even recognize a meme someone’s using. Now to mention posting a meme yourself that’s been overused on this sub anyway to the point of boredom. 
---
How about you gtfo now.
---
Damn that's a stupid comment with a lot of assumptions. Survive with friends is a power system you opt into. The killer can't opt out of playing with them. A good survivor should easily be able to 1v1 a killer half their rank. There should be a downside to using a powerful tool.
---
~~lot of good it did her~~
---
So you were playing a normal game of dbd?
---
Because since the MoM change, every single one of Ash's perks are meh. 
---
I don't think it's a crazy idea to have each survivor have one good perk. It only encourages people to play other stuff, try new builds and makes the company money.
---
Fix generator speed and Ruin so killers have a bigger variety of perks they can use instead of Ruin blocking 1 slot  
---
Nerf SWF   
---
Add certain add-ons from weaker killers to their basekits. (example bigger range for doc shock)  
---
Nerf Decisive strike or rework it, again
---
Nerf Keys and instaheal Addons (or remove them)  
---
All these changes should boost killers in a position where a match against survivors is equal.
---
I actually quite enjoy my games against him.
---
I'll upload it soon but my very first game against a ghosty boi had him camp all hooks until I was last alive, at which point he got me down and T-bagged me literally until I bled out.
---
And I loved every second of it.
---
We just got Ghostface before they gave us Stranger Things... So why wouldn't they? Also, their original killers for the last year have all been universally hated flops, sooo 😂.
---
Just played against a SWF. Right as I was picking up the first person, I caught sight of someone right in front of me spamming the T-bag, I knew what had to be done. Tunnel and camp baby. And the last person, I got them to a hook but dropped them to the floor, opting to follow them as they bled out.
---
It felt so bad. But it also felt *so* good.
---
Nice!
---
I played him for 12 hours Sunday because I had a stack of offerings.  I don’t know what made him feel so good but I was dropping 4Ks left and right.  The last few hours I was barely stalking.  
---
I was running distressing and the faster walk while crouched addons.  I think it kept people on edge at all times.  They’d hear my increased terror radius, then if it disappeared I could be on the other side of the map or I could be sneaking up.
---
Thought Mathieu was giving the bird for a minute
---
stop doing my man quentin dirty
---
I mean, while its not impossible, it should never be expected, especially in this case where the the midchapter patch is already pretty enormous.
---
Lmao that sounds kinda hilarious tbh
---
Keys are fine though.
---
The amusing thing is that even with no addons, nurse is still the strongest killer in the game. They're going to change the things that make her completely unstoppable, and people shouldn't be upset with this.
---
An annoying doc build.  Increased terror radius (distressing and monitor), harder skill checks, the add ones that extend your terror radius and iridescent head.
---
When I do it its because my teammates are potatoes and arnt even trying for a rescue
---
Can I get a link to a post that shows all the changes or something cause I can’t find them?
---
*is that the window with a camera*
---
Annnd I just came in my pants. This skin is jizz-tastic.
---
Imagine being so triggered over an interdemensional creature that you do research to prove a point no one cares about. Lol
---
This makes me think that they found a Claudette that was white and everyone started calling the original Claudette ”black Claudette”.  Can’t remember what show that idea was from.
---
No point to continuously argue.
---
I dunno. I may have just taken it differently. Bc you really do have to be good at nurse and spirit to be top tier. But you can be just decent at billy and 4K. So with that in mind nurse and spirit are most definetly better than billy. But only in the hands of a skilled player. But if you’re just bum average billy would be better. 
---
That’s my interpretation anyways.
---
This happens to me virtually every game with random survivors and someone plays Nea. 
---
Granted. I am newbie ranks.
---
Meh...I mean I guess? It’s the same speed as though they were only hitting good skill checks so it’s pretty fast nonetheless.
---
how did it take you hours? did you not try looking it up first
---
Yikes. Then you make the assumption that I don't report these people. Hence why I said your solution makes it invisible. I assure you my sk8n is just fine, I seek solutions but here you are making thinly veiled insults and not contributing nice job.
---
Against a spirit? Why wouldnt they. Thats whats wrong. Playing her like every other killer.
---
No joke
---
How’d you get the Jane Thiccero flair?
---
*Laughs in Claudette*
---
Imagine claiming the ability to know which killer is which by looking at only the hands then acts like they don’t look up facts when t suits them? Lol. 
---
You were wrong, you got called out for being wrong, and now you’re deflecting because you can’t handle it. Who’s triggered again? Lmao.
---
Basement Bubba. No points for originality but you’ll be able to grab your pickaxe and mine the basement for salt. 
---
3 Gen Doc. Distressing/Unnerving Presence/Overcharge, preferably on Gideon Meat Plant. Go to the 3 closest gens at the start of the match and never leave them. 
---
Slow down Freddy. Thanatophobia/PGTW/Ruin/Dying Light. Swing Chains and Jump Rope for add ons. Gen speed gets slowed to a crawl for sleeping survivors once you get some thana/DL stacks.
---
As a PC nurse, don’t worry too much. We suck all the way until red rank
---
It’s not about what the game prioritizes. It’s about latency.
---
This. I had it a couple times someone dced 30 sec into the match and it still cancelled the whole match due to 'loading screen disconnect'
---
Damn this makes me want a dead by daylight dinosaur gameeee
---
SAME. I'm so excited. I didn't want to pay for the Gorgon Veins skin so I just stare longingly for a while at the shop sometimes.
---
No it doesn't:
---
Hide behind the box in shack and run out after killer runs in.
---
Switch directions then walk back the other way on a killer trying to moonwalk.
---
Start walking down the stairs if a killer doubles back.
---
Diversion.
---
Quick and quiet into a locker.
---
Any way you can lose LOS. 
---
There are countless ways, I am not saying they are all gunna work against a rank 1 but you have to fake things, leave trains of scratch marks then fake it back. But don't successively vault the window until it is blocked because that is a waste or shack because normally after the window is blocked then you end up using the pallet. I only use god pallet if I am dead on hook. Otherwise I will never use it because it makes shack powerful.
---
I know there are players that just fuck off for a lot of the game but are there actually players who just hide the whole game in purple + red ranks? I wouldn’t know. When I die if I spectate then I just get mad that my teammates are dogshit and leave, or watch them fuck around and die (solo q worst experience in the game btw). But I’ve never seen/ know if someone is actually ONLY just hiding the whole game
---
That game is dead.
---
'Raptors'
---
Edit: dunno why I'm getting downvoted when I'm not the only one to point this out?
---
What in the actual......? Kudos this is great!
---
Then please buff Pig's crouch speed, make Pig's ambush attack count as a basic attack, and rework the traps altogether because they are fucking laughable.
---
The fact that you have to actually down someone before you can even use your power as a killer that doesn't have high mobility is just mind boggling in this game.
---
Eat the survs lmao
---
I hate Ruin no matter what side I'm playing on. I'd rather they reworked the perk into something else and slowed the game down by adding more objectives.
---
Leatherface v2
---
Why? If you get into a chase while exhausted you move slower and can be taken out with one hit.

24,28,32* that's the average of most distance based perks, sounds like a good perk to use with deliverence/no mither
---
I will confess that if a survivor spawns within LOS of my Ruin (which they have to in order to pop it instantly like that, considering the cleanse timer) I tend to play rather underhanded, I won't camp someone (because the intent is to play-to-win) but like.
---
Well, the totem spawning that close to a survivor is a bug, an abuse of mechanics.
---
It may not be the survivor's fault, but if the game is literally going to break just to give a killer a hard time, they have to give the survivors an even worse time.
---
??
---
F
---
My editing wasnt great but i wanted to meme on the people showing the splinter offering bug.
---
I agree.
---
Siege casual is the absolute worst matchmaking I've ever had to deal with. Nothing but Plats and Diamonds vs Gold's every fuckin match.
---
Actually they aren't raptors.
---
How long did the game take?
---
There's still no need for it. A good survivor can abuse this hardcore
---
tbh I am all three of those faces simultaneously the second I hear a nurse blink at the start of the match.
---
*Psst* .. You click the link
---
Somewhere around 10 mins I would say
---
I know I didnt wanna list it T-rex lmao, I wanted to do one of those long neck ones but ripperoni.
---
:)
---
A good survivor can abuse balance landing hardcore.
---
My pallets are too strong for you survivor.
---
As a data whore this post makes me absolutely warm and tingly inside.
---
That would actually be fun ans fair to play lol
---
A good survivor can abuse a lot of perks. Let's not give them more
---
It fucks me off big time too, had countless games tonights as surivor and the first survivor hooked has usually given up, attempts to escape 3x and doesnt even struggle, doesnt even allow a teamate time to come over and unhook and usually dies within 30 seconds ruining the game for others. somtines i have games where i find that i have done 2 or 3 gens by myself and the other 3 have done sweet fuck all and get chased and caught.
---
A good killer can also abuse this perk.
---
I like him overall. Thrilling Tremors is pretty good, perk-wise, and Furtive Chase can be fun in certain situations. The zero Terror Radius thing is nice, but I prefer the stalk mechanic for Michael more. Crouching can be useful, but it can also be a hindrance speed-wise. Honestly, he’s just fun to play. He’s very expressive for a dude in a mask.

You both need help. Please leave the Internet.

I'd rather not make survivors more unbalanced than they already are
---
I’m new, is there any way to know that this specific hex is what’s active or can no one really be blamed for just cleansing any lit totem they see?
---
Been happening to me on Xbox ever since the last update or two.
---
Green rank killers shouldn't be getting auto depips because they keep getting matched against 2-3 red ranks
---
If you want to warm him up to the game then put put a line for some premade games where the killer agrees to go a little easier on you.
---
I understand that it's fun to walk all over newer/weaker players but the matchmaking system was being heavily abused by sweaty SWFs with 1 new person and 3 "Fuck your fun" survivors.
---
Now they cant abuse it, and "kill your friends" still exists if you don't want them playing against low rank killers that you as a red rank have no business playing against
---
How is it about latency? Literally every Billy could do that no matter their ping.

Obligatory Fnaf character goes here

WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY AREN'T UNBALANCED
---
He's debatably just as good as Freddy, it's hard to compare them though because the way you play each killer is so vastly different while the win percentage is roughly the same.
---
That being said, as long as flashlights and OoO exist, Hag will never be better than Billy or Freddy. Lastly, there is no way Demogorgon is better than Billy, I instantly ignore people that say that Demogorgon  is up there with Billy and Freddy because I just assume their trolling.
---
Just look at a good nurse player. You should be able to get a 4k every game.
---
Nah the real strat is to have noed and insidious, blink into the exit gates and then wait there until they get opened. Nasty surprise.
---
Seems a bit overpowered, maybe have a button where you have to crouch but good Idea
---
Isn't that in Deathgarten?
---
He's pretty good, as a survivor I wish the reveal mechanic worked more consistently.
---
Yeah but not everyone wants to play as or against nurse
---
&gt; v-sync that you can't turn off in game. I saw a video on YT that showed me how to turn it off.

I guess its true, Nea is the entity within a survivor

I'm gonna have to say no. This takes all skill needed away from a skillful action, and one that prevents unhooks none the less. If all it did was blind maybe, but making them drop the survivor seems like too much as survivors already have a handful of second chances.
---
To be fair, there’s a distinct sound made when someone quits on purpose vs gets DC’d due to a connection issue.. That being said I’ll side with you on this and hope they have bad game sense.
---
Don't know that game.
---
Playing Dwight with Prove Thyself or David with We're Gonna Live Forever are both a good start.
---
Doppio
---
You need tokens to use the perk though, which means the killer needs to get hooks AND you need to be the person to unhook the survivor.

3v1s  / 2v1s / 1v1s are really fun.

It means both survivors and killers should get them.

New content will get more discussion. Patches get some. From 2 weeks after to 2 weeks before new chapter it's basically just shitposts and idiots arguing who's more toxic.

&gt; No. Two unbalances make a balance of they are opposite.
---
By that logic lets give all killers infinite noed,  and survivors infinite exhaustion! Problem solved!
---
But the killer would totally lose them in a chase. You shouldn't be able to lose the killer that easily. It takes no skill

You have to have been hooked once before you can be moried.

Idk bro but if you switch you might lose them, better off just maining t-Rex tbh

Gotta get those altruism points in man

I like your idea better.

Honestly they should move chests away from windows
---
Maybe let the killer see their aura for 3 seconds after.
---
Ah I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Maybe they thought the keyboard part was referring the quotations? Idk i thought it was pretty clear.  
---
Also thx for the upvote
---
Then it's pointless if the killer can still see you. It'll hinder the survivor more than help.
---
Obvious troll?
---
it wasent posted around 1-2 pm EST USA when it was already live, i fired up the game just now and saw the news update
---
Ad hominem.
---
Don't worry brother, my dad is the CEO of behaviour interactive. He just told me it's not happening. They couldn't get the color of his nose right. You can rest now sweet prince.
---
The killer from Sleepaway Camp, specifically from THAT scene. Thankfully it'll never happen.
---
Survivors must now do 10 gens instead of 5 but ruin is gone.
---
Decrease healing time back to what it was, but compensate by adding more time to gens or an extra gen.
---
The main reason spirit, and other high mobility characters like nurse and Billy often feel "op" is that they will hook rush you, and get to you before letting you heal up after you get unhooked. Slow killers don't get to you quick enough to take advantage of it.
---
This will be a buff for the slow killers, as gen time is increased, and an adjustment for the "op" killers without touching it nerfing their abilities or powers.
---
It encourages better game play, as survivors won't feel tunneled off the hook if they can get the heal off, and killers won't hook rush and tunnel people right off the hook as much. 
---
Survivors who are good enough to lose the killer will also have time to heal up quickly, which is good for the skill ratings in the game (higher skill people will lose killers, heal up more, and survive more than bad survivors).
---

Only for 3 seconds AND you are very far away now. If you felt it's two weak despite that, perhaps take the hindered effect off.

The only specifics listed were from the dev update yesterday here https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/
---
And this is Peanits' response about the dev post where he mentions that there will be changes to the Nurse's base as well, conveniently left out of the dev update. https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/728784#Comment_728784
---
Thank you
---
Not if you hit the skill checks. Nothing more badass feeling than hitting an Overcharge skill check while running vs a Doctor with Unnerving Presence.
---
What’s the point of flashlights if you bring that perk? Bringing a flashlight is like saying “I don’t expect this to work so I used an item slot to make up for this lost perk”
---
Like, it totally could happen, but those midchapter releases really arent the norm, and in this case especially, I'd be pretty shocked if a new killer was dropping.
---
It still isn't fun to end a chase out of nowhere. It takes no skill and it'll become a new meta, making killer even more unfun
---
Those are exhaustion perks for you.
---
thank you i can finally diE
---
100% not. There's not even screenshots about it
---
Like I said, if you wanted to save tokens or as a backup.
---
Holy hell that's spooky. Great work.
---
Good. Killer is too fun atm.
---
OoO already has a HUUGE downside, why does it need more? I didnt know people actually had a problem with OoO
---
What a troll
---
No but 12% speed is nice, and additional bps is never bad.
---
It feels like people disconnect far, FAR more often below rank 12 than anywhere else
---
I say that because all I play is killer these days. I find it way more fun than survivor.
---
Now do it with 5 stacks of lullaby, consistently.
---
YOU KILLED HER, SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A BAD KILLER
---
&gt; If you wanted to post that base nurse was seeing changes, that would have been great and people could have speculated in the comments but what you did was go "BASE NURSE IS BEING CHANGED, EVERYONE PREPARE, EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WORKED ON WILL MEAN NOTHING!! OTHER KILLERS ARE NEXT!!"
---
First - I like to think that I have more of a calm rage than a loud one. Seething is more like it. This thread more than anything is me saying that that I was wrong about thinking that tru3 was overeating. That it's clear that he has inside info with being a fog whisperer and all since he's been saying for WEEKS not to believe the devs' claim that just the Nurse's addons are being tweaked. He's insisted that her base is being nerfed *significantly*. The only reason why I've kept calm about it was due to waiting to hear what the devs would say about it. I let my guard down yesterday when I read their dev update and thought that tru3 overreacted but nope, Peanits' post made me go from 15 to 100 in the "they ARE fucking nerfing her base and are trying to be coy about it" category.
---
They have talked about nerfing her for a long time, always making comments about it and laughing as if they are merely joking. They and their SWF counterparts would love for every killer to be as shit as Wraith. It's only through the mere voices of killer mains fighting tooth and nail for strong killers that we have viable killers now.
---
It's a speculation thread, I am speculating based upon the history of the devs, the words of Peanits, and the inside info of Tru3 that the devs are going to nerf the Nurse's base in a way that will not just be "slightly" as Peanits' is claiming. "Slight" to them may be a 3-5 fucking second stun for a missed attack and that could be the difference between the second best killer in the game and Ghostface.
---
We will see if I am wrong in my speculation next week or two weeks from now when the PTB is released. But if I am right, I will be quoting you to remind you why no one - no one should be giving these devs any benefit of the doubt when it comes to the lengths they'll go to to placate low skilled survivor mains.
---
And if I am wrong, I'll also say I am wrong. But either way I won't run from it.
---
If you let Lullaby stack to 5 you’re bad
---
Someone commented vigil is a trashy perk which you defended “ Vigil still does what it is suppose to do, just most people don't find it "strong enough".” If that is what you believe in why would you argue for change?
---
This sub should honestly have a Shit post Saturday
---
This sounds like a job for me! Nea mains unite!
---
Yeah I get that you want to play a game with your friends but there needs to be something in place to prevent unsportsmanlike behavior.
---
Michael Myers personally comes to your house and calls you gay.
---
The higher my rank has gotten the more I see this. At rank 15 I almost never saw it. At rank 7 its almost every game. If its not the first survivor to get found DCing, its the killer the moment his ruin is cleansed. Is there no penalty for DCing? How are they able to maintain higher ranks while DCing constantly?
---
I gotta say, that "made on the hook" really ties the whole meme together. 10/10, would meme again.
---
You sneaky rat 😉😉
---
16 I believe. That could be wrong tho
---
Spirit main here: ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. You have a point, but like... not that OP. Unless you get *really* lucky and the gates are next to each other, you can't shift between them fast enough without really good add-ons.
---
Thank you so much
---
People have been telling them to put in R1 cosmetics for years, I have no idea why they still havent implemented it. Like shit they could literally just make bloody variations of other outfits and people would still care more just from that alone.
---
No, you're right.
---
It was never the casual that was the problem it has always been the super try hards. There are teams that the rank 20 is not really a rank 20 but they kept from pipping to boost the teammates. Its a shame that everyone else has to suffer for that.
---
You shouldn't be able to until the end iirc
---
Lmao that’s me and my roommates 😂
---
I doubt it, because the Dress add ons specify that it's only when the survivor is asleep that the extra regression applies.
---
Logically, Freddy is causing the explosion, not the survivor. As well as it not being a failed skill check, just an explosion similar to one.  
---
However, this is BHVR-coding we are talking about here so it'd be interesting to try it in a KYF lobby. You might just find a new bug. But I imagine it's not intended to work that way even if it does currently.
---
If their status is online they show up in your currently playing with
---
I already have but thanks for the advice
---
Ya I’m wondering if the rift will have something like be rank 1 to unlock or some shit like that
---
Like the base understanding of the game is so easy so solo play as survivor is just sometimes going through the motions. Run the walls where you know. Track your pallets and avoid going down in high priority areas to make the killer waste as much time as you can. You don’t need to carry 100% of the weight as long as your teammates can do 20%, someone is gonna escape unless you throw hard early. This is why I also don’t take survivor accomplishments very seriously, it’s hit the skill check and run the tiles. Like...congrats you’re on autopilot. When I played with my SWF group I always had to run meme builds or builds around one specific average perk to make it kinda okay. Fun Fact, Poised is actually pretty good when you have other perks to back it up. 
---
But I could never feel like I was doing anything decent when my friends are green/yellow and we get a rank 15 killer with deerstalker and a lv 2 teachable. And even for SWF where someone is legit new, what’s more scary in a horror game than the big bad killer making you feel helpless and afraid? 
---
That’s what I never got about people slanted to survivor; once you understand the mechanics of this game, the survivors are mainly the power role. Mild coordination tilts the scales in their favor super hard and adding in how much efficiency you get just by saying it in voice chat is pretty much GG. I’d rather have all my friends get bodied and learn how to be good rather than them go on a power trip vs someone who is still learning because I carried their dead weight.
---
Tab into the homescreen when in the killer lobby... then you can check his username in the game's info window
---
You triggered my night paranoia you pallet waster now im in serious fear
---
It does, there's one button for unhooking, chest interactions, bla bla and another for vaulting and dropping pallets
---
Doesnt sound like tunneling more like shitty teammates
---
Big brain
---
I imagine that the power is like Huntress lullaby , in that the quote says they cant get that song out of their heads and are constantly hearing it.
---
So, in game, whenever these dolls activate, the piercing shriek is so powerful that survivors instinctively cover their ears.
---
I imagine the outer radius of the dolls shriek range would just grant a minor Huntress lullaby effect, due to lack of concentration, with closer to the center increasing the effect until the dead center is unbearable and no action can take place until the survivor leaves.
---
With some tweaks and numbers, it could be an interesting power.
---
The game map is notorious for being difficult to find totems on. Unless you have all the spots memorized and/or you're in a swf you probably aren't finding the totem quickly, especially when a lot of survivors don't care about lullaby until it is a problem.
---
So they followed Stephen King AND TWD on Twitter? 
---
So what’s the truth? Are we getting a Pennywise Zombie Hybrid or are people reading into it too much?
---
I fucking love getting mori-ed over waiting to die on the hook
---
Then I won’t ever bring the perk. Clearly I’m not goin for anything involving blinding the killer, so why bother?
---
That’s no problem you can still do it. In fact this piece was done digitally on my iPad!
---
Awesome. My Hag’s getting a glow up.
---
The modeled Dwight after Mathieu
---
THANK YOU
---
You can check online and offline killers 
---
Offline killers is a little tricky and you need to be in a party to see but it’s very possible. Kind of hard to explain
---
Asuka would like a word with you heathen
---
At end game would that matter? Teleport away, tell your team where you are, they block, free escape.
---
It makes the text bold.
---
This is actually a graphical error in ue4 games, I've gotten this in f13 and Outlast 2 before.
---
It's still pretty cool looking, though
---
Yeah, sorry i forgot. I took a programming class so i knew it was programming related but i had no memory of what it did. Thanks dude.
---
And people would still complain about it
---
He is Dwights dad
---
Yo can't control where you teleport.
---
Recently started to use small game just do deal with ruin users . Especially when it's the new map.    Its especially nice on maps like The Game as it can trigger on both floors so I  search the map twice as fast.  I also cleanse dull if I come across them  . They worth 1000 points so even if I dont get in a chase I can usually get about 4k-6k pretty fast .
---
Went to hop in a locker to use inner strength,  dropped a pallet instead.   Big brain plays
---
The rumor for the past few days was a pennywise stand-alone in December and a TWD survivor standalone for mid chapter, like how they did Ash followed by Ghostface. 
---
And if we do get that it’ll probably be Daryl Dixon.
---
Very nicely done
---
Sadly Daryl is way more likely than Rick due to copyright issue reasons
---
From my knowledge yes, it explodes like they missed a skill check
---
LMAO that reminds me that I fake phased a Survivor at the exit door and when I reappeared I yoinked them off the lever it was so freaking great.
---
Dont know if I would actually want this, but I would definitely use it.
---
r/dataisbeautiful
---
Ugh plz not Daryl
---
Calm your tits, guys. TWD is a huge part of comic con this year.
---
Used to play on PC, but now main on PS4 so I can play survivor with my wife. It's pretty awesome!
---
I was playing with a controller on PC anyway and don't notice any differences besides not being able to chat to the players post-game.
---
Do it!!
---
(Nurse is hard on console, but I can cope.)
---
This made me laugh too hard. Nancy is life.
---
And all of them have the same perks
---
The best is seeing them run from the channeling gen after the BBQ proc
---
&gt;Does Surge Work On Generators That Survivors Are Working On At That Time?
---
&gt;I really hope it does cause i had a build idea but that may ruin it for the build.
---
Yes, it explodes on their faces and causes the flat regression but, if they don't let go off the generator, they will be able to repair it with sparks coming out of the generator. Once they finally let go (because the killer pushed them out), the sparks won't passively regress the generator and the killer won't be able to kick it.
---
Beware when using Surge + Surveillance, it will show certain generators with white auras but it could still have survivors working it and it won't turn the aura yellow.
---
I second this unless its like 3-5 blink nurse
---
I! AM! A TURTLE!
---
The totem doesn’t just become dull tho...
---
You sure? People say it’s “use at your own risk”. I would love to use this myself but I’m afraid of a false ban so I’m not taking my chances. Apparently EAC is not gonna help you if you do get flagged by them.
---
Malganis is a scrub.
---
Camping Nurse, my favourite
---
Wow that would fuck with me so much. So push people off nearby gens before activating Surge, got it. Was gonna use a gen regression build with Ruin, Surge, Surveillance, and PWYF(for extra speed to pressure more) and see how it worked. Just gotta get all the perks together and it might be good.
---
Good luck getting him to jump ship away from Kojima. Those two are like best friend goals.
---
Upside, Norman has a good history with working with videogames!
---
Pip and bp isnt worth staying in game for hours although it depends how long this bug lasted
---
Starts game without ruin, 2 gens pop after 30 seconds of playing
---
Actually the devs have said Dwight was based on another old dev of the studio who doesn’t work there anymore iirc
---
&gt;Wow that would fuck with me so much. So push people off nearby gens before activating Surge, got it. Was gonna use a gen regression build with Ruin, Surge, Surveillance, and PWYF(for extra speed to pressure more) and see how it worked. Just gotta get all the perks together and it might be good.

I just edited my comment and added a line about Surveillance.

Finally, pig will be a balanced killer
---
Thank you. That will help out a ton when running this since i’ll know about that. I had remembered Otzdarva’s build with Surv and Surge and it worked wonders so i was gonna use something similar to see if it was luck, skill, or just a good build.
---
Then by that logic is using prayer beads and mother daughter ring on spirit toxic?
---
It makes the game unfun for me so it should be right?
---
Thank you.
---
Does a better job protecting you than Jaraxxus.
---
Unless your opponent has big creatures.
---
Or removal.
---
Or a board wipe.
---
They should be skins lol
---
Haha!
---
I’m a Ghosty main p3 I love him so much. I wish I had all the perks but I have the ones I want thankfully.
---
..based off the test they're currently running we're already deciding how bad it is? Is this not the purpose of the test?
---
Ha guess so?
---
This thread is so stupid I got cancer..
---
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if BHVR was just trolling now.
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Haunted Grounds has 2 trapped totems, if one is cleansed the other totem becomes dull
---
Wow thanks so much. I had no idea that existed
---
I wish I have nail guns on my survivors. I'll pop those boils and set her free.
---
Beautiful render btw. Are you going to do Jake as well?
---
Jaraxxus just kills your bitch hero and decides he'll win the game himself. Malganis just sits on board and tries to cheer on some imps or lame shit like that.
---
No problem!
---
Probably lol
---
Adept Plague is so hard! I've tried countless times and just cannot do it.
---
I only feel the need to 4k for the achievements. Once I have the win sinched I pick everyone up for the struggle escapes. I'll still play but refuse to hook after that point. If a team is lucky I can get it before anyone dies.
---
Nice buff
---
This is a very small thing, but I hate the fact that she is the only scientist in the game. I like playing as the scientist nerdy characters but too many people play Claudette.
---
If it ruins the only motive of the own game existence, that is having fun, yes, its toxic.
---
And yet you keep doing the exact same thing 🙃 toxic troll being toxic on my comment
---
Yeah idk how they couldn't tell, I think they stop trying after a couple downvotes and just hivemind it
---
Malganis is the supportive demonic figure I always wanted. He believes in me, even if you don't.
---
Ohh forgot
---
omg
---
Green lantern a super hero popped up under that too, soo I guess he’s a trex
---
Honestly I think it's much harder to find totems on Yamaoka Estate and Springwood
---
How would chucky hook characters?
---
Seem like something they’d do
---
I mean... It was a joke that flew over your head. You can have more than 1 dimension of humor in that head of yours if that is possible.

---
I hope one of the cosmetics is Myers riding on the back of one.
---
The chapter after has a map. I don’t think pennywise is next up, he’s prob the chapter after our upcoming one
---
But it's cool af lol
---
Well ofc you would think it was better before, they changed it because it sucked for the KILLER.
---
YES!
---
Just saying, they did say they’re gonna throw us of from their ideas and cover them up as much as possible. They tried it with Ash but they accidentally leaked perks in KYF. Other than that we had no info. So I think this IT and Walking dead is too good to be true.
---
Negan will be the next killer
---
Lmao damn you're getting really defensive over this aren't you? You also didn't answer my question, I'm still curious as to what you think those gals are.
---
The left 4 dead shirt
---
He can try to shock my gay away 😉
---
Well , 2 things . 
---
1)Lether face , hilibilly .... Legion , ghostface
---
2) IT is not a clown , its an entity . Its a shapeshifter . It would perfectly be called The deadlights.
---
I just had a rank 16 killer game against 4 rank 7’s, who all claimed to be solo. I’m not sure what’s going on with the matchmaking right now. They could’ve been lying I guess.
---
Did you see what Mathieu cote said to tony hawk. “How can a respected game dev get you on their game” that’s a rough quote but it’s along those lines😂😂😂. People are getting trolled. Plus he could be mocking the game devs for “The last year” as they made pennywise without licensing for “fun” and posted the concept. No response and never happened tho lmao
---
Ayanami Rei?
---
I guess we have different definitions of toxic. I would call out unfun but not really toxic because the intent isn't really purely malicious. I would definitely say talking shit post game and teabagging at the exit gate is toxic tho
---
Not if you only mori on death hook which is the only appropriate way to use it unless survs are being ultra toxic.
---
Defensive over a meme, 😂😂just funny how critical people are these days. I already said in this a thread on this post that I thought it was an ostrich. Dinosaurs were furry so are ostriches. Change my mind
---
For some reason, when I’m playing as killer it starts teleporting me all over the map and then the game disconnects. And it looks like I’m the one who DCed but.. I didn’t. Not to mention, the survivors get their BPS and I get nada. So I’m the one punished for the game kicking me out. Please tell me I’m not the only one with this problem.
---
Oh yes. The "freddy is bad" mentality that has plagued the community since his release until he was changed. 
---
I've went against it time and time again, and im sticking by him. He wasn't bad at all. Stronger than legion, and imo stronger than leatherface, *possibly wraith* (id say that depends on the addons).
---
You wait 7 seconds to hit someone. Seems terrible, right? Well, that's because you're looking at it like that. You wait 7 seconds to get their aura revealed to you from across the map, always knowing their whereabouts till they wake up. It was a longer term investment. His ability had it's drawbacks, but it also came with many positives. He had built in game slowing time (since it was based on rng, it could either be as weak as thanatophobia or stronger than ruin even), ambush capabilities, an ability that let you locate survivors easily, an ability that gave you information so you could plan your next step, a dark world that made it hard for survivors to see while giving you their bright blue outline on the hunt, an ability that let him get close to survivors so he could start the chase in a relatively close distance consistently while they were awake. Also as a small side bonus: people underestimated you, so they're even more astonished that you beat them as "the worst killer". 
---
The examples that you see where survivors would bm the hell out of him because he couldn't protect hooks properly and he couldn't stop people from healing a downed survivor till 7 seconds were mostly problems of a noob freddy. A good freddy knew how to prepare for those situations, the only part of his kit that was outright terrible and annoying was the fact that adrenaline would wake survivors up, but that happens in a small percentage of a trial. 
---
I kinda miss him, but if nurse changes a lot (which I doubt she will, probably some number tweeks to base kit) then nurse mains will know how it feels to get their mains thrown away, the freddys who played him because they liked his ability the way it was had to change who they played or play the new freddy which is nothing like the one they spent time into learning. People will probably make more of a fuss because nurse is popular and freddy wasn't, but it'll essentially be the same thing.
---
As for nurse, nurse's base is fundamentally broken and there's no doubt about it. She teleports through all of the survivor's defenses. I know killers are supposed to have powers that make survivors play differently, but none of their powers should completely void core mechanics like pallets and vaults, that's kinda what makes the chase (along side some mind games). Even spirit, the one who is weaker than her by quite a bit but is still strong enough to take care of swf according to most people obeys basic things like map layout, nurse doesn't. The only thing that makes people go "she's good where she is" is the fact that she requires a bit more skill than other killers and her skill gap is surprisingly big among the community (she really isnt THAT hard imo). I guarantee if every nurse player was good, she would be one of the most hated killers among survivors. 
---
Also doctors ability kinda has the issue of destroying a game mechanic like hers, but it's definitely less severe and its the opposite of what she does (he has to deal with pallets and vaults but breaks most stealth mechnics as a whole).
---
They have announced Hallowed Blight event. Skins and posters were already added in latest patch
---
I think you were on my team like every other one of my games for the past some years now
---
Meanwhile though there's a rank 20 killer who is super excited he no longer has to deal with a r1 with 5k hours intentionally queueing with their depipped friend to bully the shit outta them, so, :)
---
Yea I see your point you're right
---
Holy shit i didnt know that thank you
---
I hate that window. Same thing happened to me many times
---
Even if, they wouldn't just call the video something like "DBD - Pennywise reveal trailer" or something.
---
At first I wasn't sure her blight outfit was different enough to like, but damn this thing is nasty and I love it. What isn't covered in glowing boils is black and necrotic, it's so grody.
---
Throw monitor and abuse and youll have 0 tr. Monitor and the dead rabit addon is around 6ish tr in tier 2
---
Thanks :3 I'll think about Jake
---
At least it's lore accurate
---
I’ll just leave em sometimes. They must learn the hard way that our time is precious.
---
My complaint about ds is how bold people play they have ds, I have survivors work on gens right in front of my face to body blocking while injured.
---
