Disagree with Plagues and Spirits placement, and HARD disagree with Freddys, Hags, Clowns and Bubbas placement.

Wow i really do t want to read that much
---
He‚Äôs definitely not as bad, I made these based on the killer, not the potential addons and perks that can be put in them.
---
He‚Äôs much more powerful but there are some things that he lost after the rework.
---
He lost map pressure, gen pressure to an extent. He does *almost* guarantee the first hit, but after that, the next hit can take a while depending on how good the survivor is.
---
I would be surprised if people that already paid get a free battle pass or w/e they end up calling it.. It's more then likely that paid players will get a unique cosmetic item or something to show we paid for the game. Something along those lines.
---
Please explain.
---
Yes. Why the heck is Trapper that low? He should be right in the middle.
---
thats fair. Was meant to be as low quality as possible
---
Agreed. A good match should give you 50,000 bp or so.
---
Payday 2 is done. DBD is Stabreezes new cash cow. I saw this coming a mile away.
---
*ivory* chalk pouch gang
---
Starbreeze hasn‚Äôt owned DBD for like over half a year brother...
---
Who, who done fucked it up
---
Because they helped create Identity V.
---
I meant to put him in c lel sorry.
---
His power is unreliable and usually has to end in a survivors mistake in order for it to work.
---
It doesn‚Äôt really give him map pressure or gen pressure.
---
He is a really predictable killer at high rank.
---
You can lose up to a gen and a half a the beginning from setting up your traps.
---
One again, there is no guarantee a survivor will step in your trap.
---
Without addons, he is garbage, that‚Äôs what I based them off btw. No addons or perks, just their power.
---
HEY REMEMBER A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN THERE WAS THAT USER POLL, AND THEY ASKED IF WE WANTED A BATTLE PASS SYSTEM, AND LIKE 95% OF US SAID ‚ÄúNO‚Äù?
---

---
WELL FUUUUUUCK YOUUUUUUUU, PLAYERS!
---
Welcome to the spirit family! Happy hunting! :)
---
Hm....TIL. Thanks for the info. In that case hopefully this isn't what most people think it is.
---
It's a new perk.
---
Pharmacy is better change my mind
---
Don't actually mind this. Sunk a lot of time into the game and it'd be nice to get some cosmetics for it with a battle pass. Just from the one showed here looks like its going to have a lot of stuff in it. 
---
Don't really understand why people are so anti about this when this is all optional and they'll include a free tier, other than the "because its fortnite" sentiment. Bug fixes will come when they're ready.  As annoying as that is, bugs do get patched out every patch with little hotfixes here and there.
---
This just helps the game with so many things. Retain players, cheap cosmetics and with the challenges it'll add some variety to the killers and survivors we'd see in matches. No more games made off nothing but Nurses and Hillbillies in purple and red ranks. heeheh.

DBD is going to go F2P, they'll give paid buyers 2 free battlepasses probably to compensate. Calling it now.
---
This is giving me Tokyo Ghoul vibes. ...Probably because that happens a lot in TG.
---
Well im playing noed but I'm not back at the game it's my strategy.... Bloodwarden :3
---
I gotta say I wish I'd worded mine this way. I posted one like this a little while ago and **boy,** did I get shit for it.
---
Wait I‚Äôve never seen a community get mad about battle passes wtf lol
---
I could definitely name a few people...
---
lEgIoN iS tOp TiEr ReEeEeEeEeE
---
Yeah, you said that in your first comment lol. I was just saying they might be thinking about adding a game mode like this... No perks or items to rely on, maybe spin things toward the horror side a bit more.
---
Lmao
---
People are gonna kill me but I really like the idea about a dbd battle pass. There is nothing wrong with it, you re only getting skins while you play and it's completely optional. Don't be that dramatic guys.
---
so how about u stop talking out your ass then?
---
Y'all wrong its just nea trying to hide the fact that she is the entity
---
Why do you say that? They're starting to add cosmetics for licensed characters, and even though there's no news of anything for the Elm Street chapter yet, I'd say there's more hope for it now than ever before!
---
You're not paying $10 for a ton of items, you're paying $10 to have a chance to obtain a ton of items in a time limit if you keep playing
---
They could also make it grindy as hell which means if you dare take a break, need to stop playing for something important, an emergency comes up, or you buy it too late, you could miss out on progress which eventually makes you unable to get the most valuable cosmetics and wasting the money you put up even after you put in all that time and effort.
---
Let's not forget it means potentially less cosmetics and events for free and instead replaced with more battle passes because they can simply shove all of that in one.
---
In a game that is $20 base price with over $60 in DLC. I don't want to spend $10+ and then be forced to play a single game that still needs fixes and polishing. I'm fine with battle passes in free games because it costs nothing to play it, but i'm spending $80+ I expect to have almost everything unlockable for free without needing to spend extra for a limited time item.
---
Dang is Darn in Canadian.

---
&gt; Grind is fun as long as you have a goal.
---
I'd say that depends on how heavy the grind is. When I first started out I thought unlocking perks was a slog. Doubt I would've played as much as I do without friends to play with.
---
&gt; DBD resembles an MMO in that department. 
---
MMO's have way more content than the vast majority of games, including DBD. Not the best comparison.
---
Good on you dude. When people teabag me, for the next ten minutes it is my sole purpose in life to bring the full wrath of hell down upon them and eradicate them with such extreme prejudice that they regret ever learning what teabagging was, rendering them a hallow shell of the person they once were. To each their own, I guess.
---
You understand that the developer will spend time working on the battle pass that could instead go towards new killers, survivors, maps or any content at all?
---
You understand that battle passes are heavily advertised in their games. Fork knife's focus is the battle pass first, store second, game third, and constantly nags you to complete objectives that are irrelevant to the game whether you have the battle pass or not, which incidentally is designed to make you go "Oh I did 3/7 challenges, the other 4 are locked behind the battle pass and I get so much more skinnerbox reward from doing that, maybe I should buy it..." Warframe on the other hand speaks over unique story quest dialogue to say here's generic you're a good boy message #5 from Nora for killing 1,000 enemies this week.
---
People *want* more game to play. People don't *want* quests and activities. DBD's *quests and activities* are "Hey we noticed your bloodpoint grind, howsabout go sabo two hooks instead of contributing to your team? Time spent on coop activities which means you don't want medkits/toolboxes because they reduce the time spent, so your team suffers? Mori on the nurse? You hate the nurse and don't have a mori on her? You just want to play the game? Mmkay, weirdo." and there is no battlepass out there which offers *quests and activities* that aren't randumb and demand you to work for them instead of *play the game.*
---
Do you *want* another bloodweb?
---
I really like your optimism man, I really want it aswell but another huge doubt from me mainly comes from that we got the remake Freddy and Syringe Freddy comes from the Original movies.
---
"Hey do you guys want a battlepass?"
---
"No that seems like a greedy and exploitative practi-"
---
*slams battlepass on table*
---
I am the Spirit, so screw you all. üòà
---
Maybe some people don't have any games that interest them at the moment, including DBD. Though, having a progression system allows them to still enjoy playing a game.
---
Personally, I don't mind having a cosmetic system like that because it doesn't change anything about the game. I can still play it exactly the same way as before. It's not necessary, but it doesn't affect me. Worse case scenario, I unlock a few cosmetic items by playing the same way as before.
---
In my swf, the most important call out we have is if the killer has frosty eyes. Frosty eyes killers = worst killers.
---
Sorry thought you were someone else asking üòìüòìüòì
---
That makes more sense than what I was thinking. Maybe this will be the new ranked mode (since they did ask what your highest rank was in the survey)
---
It would make it tons easier to make it balanced if they didn‚Äôt have to worry about perks. And people who get upset about certain perks (DS, NOED,whatever else) wouldn‚Äôt have to play with them.
---
My first thought was some sort of battle royale mode lol. Like you start with nothing but can find perks through the game. But that didn‚Äôt make much sense lol.
---
Someone call r/punpatrol.
---
NO, ONE BY ONE THEY ALL DISCONNECTED AFTER THEY ENTERED MADNESS TIER 1.
---
Imo hag is way better
---
this is like the "teenagers lose their phone for 5 seconds and freakout, back in my day we didn't have that" argument. its so stupid
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
look at games now. theres always something new. a new update. new level, gun, item, hell even just a cosmetic. things change. games back then weren't like that but they are now. its called change. 
---
same thing applies to this game no? people play hour after hour. yes we get updates and new refreshing things but why shouldn't we? because people back then didnt?
---
when did i say that people are losing interest? its something extra to having what you need. this is a battlepass. no way is it gonna be super expensive and hell it will probably be cheaper than buying 2-3 outfits (and it will give more)
---
even if its super awful and not what people want/are expecting theres a 99% chance it doesn't affect core gameplay at all. but i assume u are just referring to my one line compared to the battlepass discussion.
---
People said the exact same thing when they introduced the Store last summer lmao
---
I mean who really hangs out at that menu, I just mash on the survivor button myself lol. But that‚Äôs another nice touch if they wear your cosmetics too
---
They might have been working on it before the survey, and wanted to know people's opinions, it might not even make it in
---
I literally stopped playing warframe over its free pseudo battlepass.
---
They are just too stressful to me.
---
It doesn't leak because it doesn't exist.
---
I actually agree with some things you said, however.
---
Plague having the ability to instantly down survivors is pretty much equivalent to a killer with permanent exposed. Her ability also makes it much easier to track survivors from the normal moaning sounds but also the puking sounds.
---
Spirit isn't all that addon reliant (spirit main.) Her add-ons can really help but she is also really with without them.
---
I ranked these killers from their power, not their potential (add-ons and perks.)
---
So hag without range addons is a bitch, I've had some cases where I couldn't take a trap because it was too far away. She'd be a lot better if she said something like dead fly mud base kit.
---
Clowns ability can be used to close distance or zone survivors into a certain location. But I do agree, his power doesn't help with mad pressure or gen pressure.
---
I reconsidered and I feel like he'd be a b.
---
Freddy is not as bad as people say yes, but he is still pretty darn bad nonetheless. He is able to slow the game down a bit and he is also able to track survivors. That's it.
---
His power doesn't help in a chase so a chase can take well over a minute, and by then, there's probably only one person in dream state and the others are just working away at gens.  
---
I do consider slugging to be a strategy that works well on Freddy, but without knockout or third seal, it won't work.
---
Remember, I made this tier list based on the power, not potential.
---
This ^
---
Blue susie is better
---
The game should be balanced before perks/items/addons, so this is just a way for the devs to check where any issues with balance are.
---
Yes. BMing by fucking with you on hook and unsportsmanship doing nothing but waiting for you to do gens for them.
---
&gt; You understand that the developer will spend time working on the battle pass that could instead go towards new killers, survivors, maps or any content at all?
---
I **want** them to work on battle passes.
---
&gt; 
---
You understand that battle passes are heavily advertised in their games.
---
oh no, who would've thought?
---
&gt;  Fork knife's focus is the battle pass first, store second, game third, and constantly nags you to complete objectives that are irrelevant to the game whether you have the battle pass or not, which incidentally is designed to make you go "Oh I did 3/7 challenges, the other 4 are locked behind the battle pass and I get so much more skinnerbox reward from doing that, maybe I should buy it..."

---
Warframe and fortnite, well known as two extremely popular and succesful games, has something you don't like. I enjoyed playing those games plenty and never had a problem.
---
Given how much Fortnite and warframe have added (in game, mechanics, maps) your point doesn't hold up well. 
---
&gt; People want more game to play. People don't want quests and activities.
---
People want both, or else people wouldn't keep buying battle passes.
---
&gt; DBD's quests and activities are "Hey we noticed your bloodpoint grind, howsabout go sabo two hooks instead of contributing to your team? Time spent on coop activities which means you don't want medkits/toolboxes because they reduce the time spent, so your team suffers? Mori on the nurse? You hate the nurse and don't have a mori on her? You just want to play the game? Mmkay, weirdo." and there is no battlepass out there which offers quests and activities that aren't randumb and demand you to work for them instead of play the game.
---
I agree on this. They need to rework objectives.
---
&gt; Do you want another bloodweb?
---
Do you think quests for cosmetics are the same thing?
---
I ran bond since the game came out mostly because I leveled Dwight first and because I don't like teammates running the killer into me
---
well hey hopefully it does go free to play and you'd be able to enjoy it !
---
and yeah i understand the concern. back in 2016 this game was a huge grind and wasn't free. it has gotten way easier now but if a paid to play game has a huge grind behind it (that isn't only cosmetics, its things that change the outcome of the game) then i don't see what could be so bad about this.
---
Damn, every time I see you comment, you're saying something stupid.
---
Why would it be bad? Its just cosmetics right?
---
Remember kids, when dedicated servers come, you don't get to do this any more. Unless you enjoy not playing..... wait a minute.
---
Most of pigs add ons are weak, and most of nurses are too strong
---
I like it for the most part, I just wish it wasn't impossible to win solo against some killers
---
Really not trying to be a contrarian when asking this, but why is everyone so upset about this? I get that it's stemming from fortnite (to each their own), but it's free content. As long as you don't pay for it you'll be getting some free dope shit.

DONT GIVE THEM IDEAS I FIND THE EXIT GATE DAILIES TO BE HARD ENOUGH
---
David used Confusion! It was super effective!
---
&gt;I'd say that depends on how heavy the grind is. 
---
Of course, everyone has different thresholds. I think they could add weekly rituals to pump more points into the game, buff survivor point gain, revert WGLF to give 200% points. They are already working on lowering the grind, as they are trying to make the tier 1 and 2 perks closer in usefulnes to tier 3s.
---
&gt;Doubt I would've played as much as I do without friends to play with.
---
I can def. identify with that, for me solo survivor is awful. I play almost 90% killer but when I do play survivor I almost always play with a friend.
---
&gt;MMO's have way more content than the vast majority of games, including DBD. Not the best comparison.
---
It is a good comparison when trying to show why people might enjoy the grind. You don't mind doing the dungeon x amount of times if you know you are grinding for the y item that you value. Sure, DBD has less content than MMOs, but the mechanic I am talking about is the same. You are working towards a goal.
---
Are we gonna ignore he's a Steven universe.
---
Pretty sure that was a mobile build running on PC still.
---
lol, not wrong. I work from home a lot, and was on a conference call spacing out and staring at the menu...
---
I mean no? It gives grinding a purpose beyond getting all the perks, seeing the price of the game I doubt it‚Äôll cost much more than any of the dlcs, and if you don‚Äôt want to pay for it, there‚Äôs a free route option on it too. There‚Äôs literally no harm done here. They just have to make the name something more fitting for dbd. Y‚Äôall are crying over something that isn‚Äôt remotely an issue.
---
when the safest place in the map is the house of a serial killer that has the basement in it.
---
What's so bad about free cosmetics?
---
If I DC, I will DC.
---
I think it's about levels of toxicity and duration
---
i like the idea of battle pass
---
is not pay 2 win so... i think is ok idk
---
maybe is a bad ideia ;c
---
I‚Äôm all for the battle pass. I was hesitant at first but it‚Äôs literally free stuff if you don‚Äôt buy it, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll buy it if it‚Äôs reasonably priced. It doesn‚Äôt change any of the games mechanics so what‚Äôs it hurting?
---
Well I guess you are entitled to your wrong opinion
---
Sometimes it does feel good carrying a survivor to the hatch, shutting it right in front of them, then letting them open the exit. Displays power but mercy at the same time. Fantastic.
---
Ok haters you got me on this one this render genuinely just sucks on so many levels
---
No you're paying like $5-10 for a chance to get cosmetics as long as you can play enough within a time limit. And it might be more than just cosmetics, it could be exclusive cosmetics, bloodpoints (multiplier or points), iridescent shards, Auric Cells, etc. which could end up replacing Bloodhunts and Events with cosmetic rewards just because they want you to throw them a $10 for them.
---
Also a reoccurring $5-10 dollars in a game that costs over $80 in total kind of just says "give us more money"
---
Clown is too high, leatherface is too high, hag is too low.
---
Leatherface should be below freddy. Freddy is kind of bad, but compared to leatherface, he atleast has a power.
---
A bad shitpost... like mines
---
I assure you no one gives a shit about the fact you made this image. The fact that you even hid your name in there for some reason is hilarious. I'm not being a dick, people genuinely do not care.

I play for both xD
---
There is a button next to the chat. Once it is closed, it stays closed in every lobby and endgame chat until you open it again with the same button.
---
Honestly I don't think a battle pass on top of the bloodweb on top of the shards and all that is that great. It's too much.
---
And "give us something to grind for" as if grinding isn't what the game is all about
---
I HAD A MORI DAILY DURING DOUBLE BP. BROUGHT DEVOUR HOPE, RANCOR, AND A CYPRESS MORI TO ENSURE I GOT IT (CYPRESS WAS THE ONLY ONE I HAD). I GOT CALLED A TOXIC BILLY FOR THAT.

PIGGY DASH SHOULD COUNT IMO, LEGION FRENZY SHOULD MAYBE ONLY COUNT IF YOU WERE FULLY HEALED IMO

The problem with Mother's is that it kind of fucks over low mobility killers like Freddy, Clown, Leatherface, Trapper, and a bunch of other killers who already struggle with getting around.

Jesus the circlejerk is real
---
Buy stuff like the game, the 11 Chapters of DLC, and a handful of skins they put out?
---
They've *got* my money. With a battle pass they probably won't get much more.
---
They might still be sending out invites if you haven‚Äôt gotten one yet :(
---
Honestly part of me wants a cool reward because I‚Äôll get to feel special, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want everyone else screwed over so part of me hopes it‚Äôs just some stupid blood points or if they do a battle pass maybe that 500 will get it for free or something.
---
Given the state of how game companies have been behaving? Maybe you haven't been paying attention but being hesitant is wise.
---
[removed]
---
where is self care? is just the best perk, i cant live whitout him :(
---
*Laughs in Adept Hag*
---
That's the catch: it most likely won't totally be.
---
There will be the free stuff wich kind of sucks and there will be the paid stuff wich is the cool stuff. And this could be okay if the game itself was free.
---
Remember: If it's free, it isn't the best.
---
"You're not getting hooks you don't earn"
---
If you get downed, and put on the hook, the killer earned that hook. They chased you down, hit you twice, yeeted you on the hook without getting stunned or blinded.
---
This person needs to calm the hell down and enjoy the video game. Losing is a part of the video game, and a part of life. We can only hope they are a child.
---
Y'know, I'm actually all for giving the devs money. Also I think battle passes are fun if they have tons of cool stuff. I'm happy with the idea.
---
No when they all escape and you play to not tunnel and camp. That‚Äôs what Freddy life is if you tunnel and camp you won‚Äôt notice how bad Freddy is.
---
does this post look "hesitant"
---
Wait. That‚Äôs illegal.
---
2019? People defending micro-transactions? How bold.
---
Play killer
---
&gt;Like why waste time being angry about it. If you dont want it, dont buy it, and keep playing your literally unchanged game
---
Because a battle pass can affect people who don't purchase it (in a game that costs $20 + $80+ DLC btw) by making more skins only obtainable in the battle pass than buying with Auric Cells or Iridescent Shards and they can decide to do less Bloodhunts and Events because they can just put all of those things behind a reoccurring $10 paywall which means people who don't buy it are going to get less stuff.
---
But then what separates the cool stuff from the stuff you'd have to buy in the store with auric cells?
---
You don't have to buy it :3 I wouldn't mind it because it would give me a reason to play. Please put this in. It doesn't do any harm. Try it once and take a poll to see if there should be a second one.
---
&gt; And I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your opinion, nor anyone else‚Äôs
---
[bruh you literally striked an entire post you made out due to the opinions of other people](https://gyazo.com/aaa3f8f57a3f021957ec06a4e23b4f43)
---
Anyway this has gone on way more than it has to. Have a good night.
---
It is? Other than licensed killers, the only stuff that requires money is cosmetics. At no point should anyone feel pressured to buy anything. I think this game is a great example of how to do a living game right
---
i don't want this game to become the new fortnite
---
‚ÄúGen rushed‚Äù lol anyone that uses this term sounds like an idiot
---
Wtf was she thinking
---
Because they changed my mind. That was about something I was open to debate on.
---
This is petty and pathetic
---
Part of me doesn‚Äôt like it just because yeah fortnite and it seems tacky lol.
---
But a bigger part is it probably means locking people out of content if they don‚Äôt play enough.
---
So I really like how for the Halloween/Newyear event you could play and get the skins for free, but once it was over you could/and still can buy everything. 
---
If you have to pay for the battle pass I don‚Äôt see them just letting people buy the stuff they missed after the pass had ended.
---
I very much don‚Äôt like ‚Äúwelp you missed it so now it‚Äôs gone forever‚Äù type of stuff. It‚Äôs just a sucky feeling.
---
Like I play this game way too much so if they do a battle pass I‚Äôll probably get everything in no time, but I know some people won‚Äôt get to and it‚Äôs just going to kinda suck every time they see the item they really wanted in the game but they don‚Äôt get to have it.
---
Also one more thing putting a time limit on it could very easily turn playing the game into a chore. ‚ÄúUgh I don‚Äôt really want to play right now but I need to finish the pass‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve actually seen a few people who want it so speak for yourself
---
Oh, cool, we're getting a Spore chapter.
---
I was literally about to say I love Haddonfield Hag!!
---
Yeah and he called me salty when I explained he shouldn't bother playing the game if he'll dc over them reasons lol
---
Its more viable in EGC but I grabbed it as soon as I saw it in the shrine a couple months back, amazing troll capability
---
Okay well as soon as they say "We're going to stop doing BP events because we have a Battle Pass now", then you can be outraged.
---
Don't buy it if you don't like it. It's a win in both ends. We get an initiate to play, and hbvr gets more money to do cool stuff like license's killers.
---
Bruh nothing makes me shit my pants more than thinking I'm gonna escape but then the killer has blood warden.
---
Not to encourage people who disconnect, but haddonfield is so ass for killer.
---
Atleast one of the 3-4 houses on the map, which all have like 3-4 windows in them and a pallet in or outside, will be an infinite, or just really good loop. It's so bad it hurts, the long fences with windows also don't help much either.
---
DC'ing isn't really the solution, gotta suck it up and try your best. I really hope that map gets changed.
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
It's pretty good just a little dark.

AFTER 1.5 YEARS OF PLAYING THIS GAME I ALMOST GOT THE MYERS ACHIEVEMENT OF TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVING ALL FOUR SURVIVORS AND THE LAST SURVIVOR SAW ME COMING AND DC‚ÄôD

I don't mind the idea. I've gotten some good shit from other games' battle passes.
---
That‚Äôs the typical Ash Main behavior.
---
I agree. I really like his ability and I hope it doesn't end up changed too much, it makes him unique and interesting.
---
I don't main him so I don't understand too many of the problems with him to begin with. Always like playing against him as is.
---
ELI5: ‚ÄúBattle Pass‚Äù?
---
Hag &gt; clown bubba plague
---
It's true, the fact that game prices have stayed at 60$ or less has made it incredibly difficult to stay afloat. Prices are supposed to inflate over time as products get better. I can't remember why, but for games it's just a static 60$.
---
Do you read the roadmap? 
---
They probably took a month to nurse mom because they wanted to see if the community would get used to it or keep complaining about it, and they probably waited for the mid chapter patch
---
Fuckin get em Mikey. err.. Freddy!
---
I put someone to sleep with freddy, they tried to commit to the gen, pulled them off and they killed themselves on first hook. no stacks for me :(
---
Our of curiosity, where did you get the information and confirmation that it is entirely skin based? Is your source the leaked video of the incomplete battlepass missing a bunch of tiers and only showing skins/cosmetics? It would be really hard to believe skins are going to be the only thing in the battlepass, at the very least there will be other things, or rather should, like currency, eg Auric Cells, so you can buy the next battlepass with the cells you earned completing the previous one, just like every other battlepass does.
---
And even if it is skin based, you think they are all going to be greatlooking skins? You honestly think they are gonna charge 10$ for a battlepass filled with amazing cosmetics while a single skin in the store costs 10$? Just like every battlepass the bulk of the skins are gonna be under average and maybe even unwanted. For example I play Kate, do I care for cosmetics for a bunch of other charactres im not playing? Not really.
---
People either play the positive tune or the negative one, but its both. And people have a hard time understanding sale concepts and whatnot. This was not a free game, the DLC prolly cost more than the actual game did at launch, people invested in the cosmetic store.
---
They already made alot of money of this game, nothing that is gonna cost money and gets added is gonna help this game or keep it alive. They have made enough to do all of that.
---
And for the people who like to argument they will keep supporting this game etc etc, ofcourse they are, its one of the best horror games out there. Its like they said, they are aiming for atleast 5 years support. Guess what, its been 3 years and in 2 years nextgen consoles are gonna be released. They will make a sequel on nextgen and people will move on to that game. The playerbase will move. At this point its just making as much as money possible of this game for as long as it lasts and then go for the sequel.
---
And btw, free version of battlepasses always suck, you get barely anything, the quality is even lower than the average premium content and it is only meant to lure you/manipulate you into going premium. It has nothing to do with dbd or bhvr, its a concept that has been around for ages. The people who stay with the free battlepass for some reason cant grasp how much other people did go premium because of said battlepass. Meanwhile the companies behind the battlepass have a double win, they draw players into premium and make money, they have free battlepass players keep the playerbase bigger putting in a lot of time for very little reward..
---
A coin has 2 sides, regardless of which side you are on, the coin still belongs to someone and owns both sides.
---
Sometimes I get a bit too carried away lol
---
I want a Jar Jar skin for Dwight now.
---
They did develop a new game, but they forgot to market it and it died in a couple weeks.
---
Okay so, one, you don't have to buy the battle pass
---
2, it's a win-win on both sides because the consumer gets an initiative to play, and the developers get more money to do cool stuff like license killers and license cosmetics.
---
3, it's literally only going to be $10 for at least $50 worth of stuff
---
4, let them at least do one.And let them take a survey afterwards if they get a lot of negative feedback they won't do it again. Just let this be a test.
---
So they overpriced it. They may add a badass killer skin but may also add something like the purple Adam's head wich only has 3 more inches of hair.
---
And also add the grind factor, wich you could say kinda of "alienates" (i feel like that's a strong word to use in this case but you get it) the players into investing more and more into the game. 
---
And yes, this sounds absurd because it is and because it works.
---
honestly why not just make the game free to play lmao
---
so would you rather carry on the trend of there being no goddamn point to continue playing? There is no incentive to play. The moment I get 4 perks I like, I've essentially hit cap, I've hit the endgame, that's all I have to do, rank just makes you have shittier games the higher it goes.  
---
"oh play for the fun". I could go play another game, that makes me feel like I'm doing something, and have fun there, that is not an excuse in this day and age, whatsoever.
---
Judging that the Wraith was camping and it being PS4,it was probably in low ranks so a lot of players wouldn‚Äôt understand what it means.
---
I think its less about what people perceive to be toxic and more about people just needing to grow a spine over pixels in a video game. Like if you seriously go on a rant over get outraged when a killer hits you on the hook or a survivor crouches, you've gotta get some shit in perspective, dude.
---
Insta saw is amazing, BK Myers, Body-blocker hag and flower babushka/oak haft for huntress
---
personally i like saving up bloodpoints, i also use up all the good add ons and bonus bp offerings
---
mm, that man trash talks like a mf. not to say he isn't a "nice" killer but sometimes the stuff he says about the way survivors are playing takes me aback, lol.
---
Nothing. I‚Äôm cry. Big massive sad
---
Pay to play. Paid DLC. Paid cosmetics. now a PAID battlepass?  Greed of that nature can straight fuck off.
---
Way too many people here are fine with predatory monetization practices in their already paid for games these days. It's crazy to watch them figuratively hold their wallets over an open bonfire and scream to the world "U DON'T KNOW, THIS COULD END UP JUST FINE!"
---
Exp gain is based on time in matches. There really isn't a quick way to level up. The only tip i can give is to just play alot.
---
Ok, thanks
---
But I could just go play another fun game, that also makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something, it's just common game practice to offer some reward, no matter how small, to trigger that dopamine rush, to say "hey, I'm doing something here".  
---
As it stands, I level 20, and I'm essentially capped out. rank doesn't matter, arguably worse, games at higher ranks are often "sweatier", and a lot more serious, so it's less fun, so you get punished for playing (well).
---
 I feel like it‚Äôs gonna be dbd mobile. Because thats what Fortnite did. Fortnite sent invitations before it came out
---
I actually don't know what BM stands for.  Be Mean (to)?
---
Nooooo maybe they are still sending the emails :(
---
Where the fuck did people get the idea that battle passes were created by Fortnite?
---
Downvoted for having weak stances
---
Good one
---
The game should have a way to farm for the pass in it or something.
---
Especislly they push so many licensed stuff that you can't buy with ingame money is weird.
---
Is looking bad tbh..they want to push too many monetization.
---
I can see that too. I‚Äôd honesty be down for it. I‚Äôd love to get to play while I‚Äôm at work.
---
When you are as good as he is at the game, it seems fair that he considers nearly everyone besides himself trash
---
The fuck is up with Huntress‚Äôs hatchet arm? Is it usually like that?
---
Hey heres an idea, dont fucking buy it if you dont want it. Its not pay to win, its cosmetics. You arent forced to buy it either. Idk whats up all you guys asses but shit it out, not a single one of you has a valid argument as to why it shouldnt happen besides "oH nO ItS LiKE foRKnifE" 
---
ITS LITERALLY JUST BUYING COSMETICS YOU DINGLEBERRIES
---
We all remember what Jerry did to them though...
---
Shut the fuck up
---
For once, we agree, I_h8_memes. We already bought their game, purchased DLC, and spend money on cosmetics, adding another purchaseable pass is starting to alarm me. 
---
It could embolden them to be greedier and greedier and some people seem more than happy to try their luck.
---
Does that change what you should be?
---
Try again.
---
Charging actual money to unlock the ability to GRIND for cosmetics within a set time frame and lock people out of the cosmetics they paid for if they didn't literaly LIVE on the game 24/7 during that timeframe = a REALLY fucked up business model for the consumer.
---
Just because Fortnite had success with it doesn't mean it's a good practice more games should include.
---
When i hear the *word* **battlepass** I instinctively think, ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre going to make this kinda cool game... lame, like fortnite‚Äù. But if i think about it, more bloodpoints, shards, auric cells, and cosmetics for free or possibly cheaper than they currently are ($10 per outfit, outrageous!) is a brilliant concept, assuming they implement it that way. The only thing they should do, from a marketing standpoint is change the name to ‚Äúblood contract‚Äù or ‚Äúdeath pass‚Äù or ‚Äúblood oath‚Äù
---
No it‚Äôs not. We have no idea what‚Äôs in the pass.
---
You either don't understand, or pretend you don't understand. People are different and have different weaknesses and flaws. Yes, **I** am free to ignore it, but many, many people aren't. They're brains aren't wired the same way. They're vulnerable to this type of thing and they can't help themselves. It's like smoking. No one really truly wants to smoke and shave off 30 years of their lives while spending a small fortune on cigarettes. Yet they still do it despite "no one forcing them". Game developers know this stuff, and take advantage of such people, that's why this stuff is viewed as shady and unethical. Same with loot boxes and other such tactics.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not time based, I‚Äôm completely open to it.
---
Here is your tier list but good:
---
S- Nurse, Hag, Spirit
---
A- Billy, Huntress, Myers
---
B- Pig, Legion, Plague, Bubba
---
C- Clown, Wraith, Trapper, Freddy, Doctor
---
That‚Äôs a mood
---
If you don't like it, don't buy it.
---
That‚Äôs absolutely true, that‚Äôs a really bad feeling
---
What killer do you play
---
S: Balanced landing, Self care, Adrenaline;
---
A: WGLF, Plunderer, Ace in the hole;
---
B: Botany, Empathy, We will make it;
---
C: prove thyself;
---
Meme: no mither, small game, slippery meat;
---
SWF only, 250h
---
If they put a pass it should at least have 1 new killer in it. Like pay 10$ get the pass and a killer..
---
All the leaks have been cosmetic. So as of now, yes. Thats all it is. Dont like, dont buy it.
---
It really all depends on the killer
---
Everyone right now apparently
---
$20 to play, $80+ in DLC, Cosmetic store that costs $10 for a good cosmetic set fot whatever you want, and now a reoccurring $10 to force people to play hours on end if they want a bunch of garbage cosmetics with an occasional green/purple.
---
truly what we needed in a wonderland of glitches and unpolished gameplay amiright.
---
I could be wrong, but can‚Äôt you get the same things with the free one and you get bonus bp with the paid one?
---
Not on this sub. &lt;3
---
Nice
---
Paid DLC is 100% fine in my opinion, especially when it‚Äôs possible to get it through grinding
---
I'm mostly using the Doctor and Michael rn.
---
It pains me...
---
well that depends, what are you on running, on who, and are you recognizing the strengths/weaknesses of said killer? Send me some deets and I can set up a few decent tips.
---
Except licensed characters
---
And what perks do you use
---
1 -
---
They already added a ‚ÄúPlayer level‚Äù I‚Äôm sure it would work along side that. Fortnite just resets it every season. DBD could do it too. You just get EXP by playing normally just as you do with the Player Level already in the game.
---
2- hopefully they could put in enough where everyone gets stuff. But I do think this is where the ‚Äúcharms‚Äù fit in that were discovered in the data. Little things that are generic and could be used by everyone no matter who you like.
---
3- yeah the DLC doesn‚Äôt cost much but the cosmetics cost a crap ton, and assuming the battle pass would only be cosmetics most people would probably see it as a good deal to pay $10 but get serval skins when normally $10 would pay for just one.
---
I've played a handful of free to play games with a battle pass that was a "good value" as an option to support the devs. Gave a good amount of rewards, incentive to play daily and because of that, I became more social with my in-game guild. Overall increased my enjoyment 10x. Now with that being said, I dont know how I feel about it with this game(especially being a paid game),  but I'm going to reserve judgement until I know the details.
---
Not sure why there‚Äôs so many people against this idea, if you don‚Äôt want it just continue to play the game normally.
---
Which is why I said survivors would still be 3rd person view, so they don‚Äôt have to use their heads to look around. But I understand the nausea part.
---
I think it is important to have that dead zone between nurse‚Äôs and the perk, but I can agree that 6 seconds might be too long. 
---
As for the third perk, you‚Äôre right that it is not very original, but that is part of the problem with perks to punish optional objectives. I thought that would be a good compromise. Maybe lower the time the haste is in effect but leave the exposed the same. Balancing isn‚Äôt easy but I appreciate the feedback
---
My fav ‚Äútoxic‚Äù build is Mint Rag + Shackles Hag (with Surveillance/MYC). My favorite casual build is currently Bone Clapper + The Ghost - Soot. So fun to ring bell randomly then actually come out of cloak and jump scare survivor.
---
Get them to 50, use up all their party streamers/ crazy addons for a few games of fun then prestige when you‚Äôre ready. Just don‚Äôt spend any more on their bloodweb to save points for the next prestige, repeat.
---
Why not Licensed characters?
---
Part of me feels like its a no brainer to save up until you at least go through all your bp offerings but the other part REALLY wants that bloody knife &gt;\_&gt;;
---
That‚Äôs not very cash money of you.
---
The fact that you had to write all that to explain the complexities of waking up shows that it‚Äôs too complex. How are you expected, as a new player playing Freddy, to learn all this? It‚Äôs insane. They need to simplify him a bit in the upcoming rework because presently it‚Äôs just a mess. I don‚Äôt mind if they wanna give survivors other ways to wake up but it needs to be consistent and counter-able. If everyone is in the dream state and they all purposely miss a skill check to leave it than how am I supposed to deal with that? I already chased them all over putting them in the dream state now I have to do it again. A perk that grants tokens every time someone wakes themselves up could be cool, that way purposely missing skillcheck at least has a downside to it. I know I know it reveals your location but if you see a teammate get injured and hear nothing then you have time to miss a skillcheck and escape easy
---
usually save up, dump a few points into another character I can use to earn BP quickly and still enjoy playing as until I can bring the prestige character up to snuff.
---
This guy is the winner though. He has been around the game forever, he has seen it all and he doesnt give a fuck anymore, words cant even describe how little he cares. But other people care so much they are making a post about him on reddit, calling him a wuss or w/e, gonna break as much rules as they can when they meet him ingame.... If he is reading this he is laughing his ass of..
---
Sometimes I feel like this is the first game ever alot of people play... did noone ever play warcraft 3? People dc if you didnt give them gold/wood? Build the wrong minions? Killed a wisp? Killed a neutral creep? Did noone ever play counterstrike 1.x? DC if losing kniferound, dc if flashbanged, dc if wallbanged, dc if starting wrong side..
---
This is such old news, please stop giving them attention. They are trying to bait you and for some reason it gloriously works..
---
Commence downvoting
---
Oh I agree about the blind duration. They at least do something though haha.
---
does other game companies behavior mean i should be hesitant about something that rewards me for playing? u make no sense. even if it gets added. u either buy it or don't. what does it change? i get to wear a shirt u dont?
---
For michael or the doctor?
---
Same. It's (I assume) $10 and you generally get WAY more cosmetics than you would get if you just bought $10 worth of skins.
---
Also, I personally love the idea of working towards rewards in this game instead of just the regular BP grind to get all perks on all characters or something.
---
Both
---
Fortnite's BP only gives you like 1/15th of the pass to unlock as a free user. 95% of it is locked behind a paywall.
---
And even if you pay for it, you still need to actually grind for the items.
---
So if you bought the Season 5 pass and played a bit but then couldn't get back on for a few days and then Season 6 launched, you lost your chance to get all those items and your money is wasted.
---
Happens all the time when you hear the heartbeat and don't know where it's coming from
---
Bad Manners - it's just an all encompassing term for teabagging, taunting, toxic behaviour.
---
Exactly.
---
His mori is hitting people in the back. Not too hard to top.
---
Definitely should have kept the machine gun frenzy, if they‚Äôre gonna make his power almost useless and the cooldown so long.
---
"Just because you are the bad gu- Killer, doesn't mean you are a bad g- killer."
---
I've had the most luck with the doctor bc he allows me to shock survivors away from a gen at a distance and track them pretty easily.
---
There's a chance you could get a refund. Microsoft is pretty good about that kind of stuff
---
I'd say (as a survivor main) that you shouldn't chase someone for too long bc the others will do gens 100% and also try to mind game it works really great at low ranks
---
honestly, don't be afraid to just shoot for regular hits, they weakened the power but made them more solid as a normal killer. Plus their power has kinda always been situational, if you think there's more than one surv in the immediate area, tag 'em by getting close enough for a normal attack, then swapping in Frenzy. If there's another surv in range, tag them too. If not, *green light* to smack 'em down
---
agreed! the best thing you can do is not use their power. it even gets rid of the scratch marks. its bad enuff as it is, without that too. just BBQ everyone and let them live.
---
Bone clapper and Ghost is so fun on The Game and Lery's
---
Well, I recommend you to play a bit with easier killers... Michael and Doctor have difficult to use powers since the kinda waste your time in a chase and time is precious, try learning the tactics with billy who has great mobility with his chainsaw and then change to your mains so you can learn the power........ Doctor: during the match you can use your power to track survivors since the scream when inside your terror radius, only put them into tier three if you have some good addons (start by using the common knight addon so you get used to your shock range)......... Michael: his power is a bit more difficult, only use advanced addons when you KNOW what you‚Äôre doing. You must get to tier 2 asap and only tier up  when you found someone who‚Äôs healthy (try 99% your evil within), but before tier 2, try sneaking up on survivors and stalking from a good distance, they will be focusing on the gens........ Also, which perks are you using?
---
An when was this cause I‚Äôm general that was a issue on there end . They fixed the finding matches situation awhile ago .
---
thats why you need to just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. and not that u asked but i recommend BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is the company still hasnt given us an update that shows the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not yet. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are.
---
I LOVE IT WHEN I STRUGGLE DURING THE SECOND PHASE BUT IT KILLS BE ANYWAYS BECAUSE I PRESS THE BUTTON SO FAST IT DOESN'T COUNT IT AS ANOTHER KEY PRESS! FEELS BAD MAN.
---
To be honest. Any type of incentive to get me to play that isn't just bloodpoints is a yes from me. Love the game, but I hit the stage of playing to play ages ago. I need somethin to earn. So I say go for it. If it's not a good fit; Hit us with the one and done and try a different tactic. 
---
~Kallows
---
Only shirtless Myers belongs in the main sub...gotta respect that
---
the trick is to use their green streamers and yellow puddings before you reach level 50. that way you can prestige right away. dont worry about using any other items though.
---
Because cosmetics do matter in a multiplayer game, people like to look unique/cool/beautiful/etc. and forcing cosmetics behind a reoccurring paywall (again in a game that costs $20 + $80+ DLC) that doesn't even guarantee you even get it unless you force yourself to play hours on end to get it. The cosmetic shop may be somewhat overpriced but at least I know what i'm getting for $10 then be forced to pay and then play if I want something that could be exclusive and require numerous hours to even get.
---
Save up 1 million bp and than prestige him it will give u lvl 35-40
---
Don't forget the soon to follow Bloodpoint packs for real money!!! Make sure you get the best value by buying the $99.99 package as it comes with a 20% boost!
---
at what rank u play?
---
its cheesy as heck but u can play as an afk killers a lot. i do this a lot but only because i work at my computer while doing it, so i dont really need to play
---
That is true, but I was mostly talking about the leaked details to the DbD one. I honestly (even if they‚Äôre bad at balancing) don‚Äôt think that the Devs would con us like that
---
I love playing Hag. I hate playing against Hag.
---
If I got BBQ on that killer and some decent perks I'll save up and prestige then. If not tjem I just immediately prestige and get points on a different killer.
---
Somebody disconnected
---
DCing is DCing.
---
Control yourself.
---
I play Freddy often and I don't mind the waking up too much but I agree it's frustrating. 
---
Usually I hook, and watch the BBQ Auras to figure out what's going on and who's awake. 
---
If I get a loud noise notification chances are someone woke up on a gen or by self-care. Go over there and try to resleep them.
---
If you see a survivor aura kinda crouched, an awake survivor is waking up an asleep one. AFAIK You can still wake people up DURING the transition which is pretty stupid. (I.E. You're waking up a survivor, I can sleep you, and even though you're still falling asleep, you can still wake up the other survivor, making it a cycle of back and forth wakeups although I have not extensively tested if 2 survivors waking eachother up is actually uncounterable, it's weird. I know if you're in the middle of waking someone up and get slept you can commit to the action, but I don't know if you can initiate it if you're already transitioning.) 
---
Crouched survivor means I gotta rush over and try to re-sleep both of them. 
---
In the end it's just trying to sleep everyone as much as possible at all times. Guy gets unhooked? Re-sleep him. You see a survivor crouched being woken up? Rush over and sleep him and his waker. Loud noise notification? Gen blew up/someone hurt themselves so re-sleep them.
---
There's also dress addons which effect how often skillchecks appear but it feels like Murphy's law. We had a Freddy farm with us earlier tonight and even though he was using a block addon that had the downside of skill checks being more often, we hardly got any. Likewise I can use a dress that considerably decreases skill check chances, and survivors wake up all the time.
---
Mirrors see around corn- *through walls*
---
You gotta rely on BBQ or WGLF for that
---
Does anyone know the actual percentage of luck increase you even get from the chalk pouch or just about anything that increases luck?
---
I USED A BLACK WARD TO TRY AND SAVE MY FUCKING SINGLE COPY OF A VERY RARE ADDON AND IT DIDN'T WORK SO I LOST A WARD AND BOTH ADDONS I USED FIX YOUR SHIT BHVR
---
The best piece of advice I can give to you is to learn basic Killer mechanics before you worry about mastering a specific Killer's power. Work on tracking and try to be aware of scratch marks. Make sure you're always looking around everywhere and being attentive of what's in front of you, because you don't want to be walking past any Claudettes crouching in the corners. Learn some basic mind games. Moonwalking, that kinda stuff. Figure out the difference between a safe and an unsafe pallet, learn when to give up a chase. You want to be going for the weaker links, not the toxic one who's teabagging and clicking a flashlight at you. Learn the Survivor mindset (playing some Survivor can help!) so you can try to better predict where they'll be going.
---
And it seems like simple advice, but I'd also recommend watching some DBD content creators who play Killer a lot. I'm a bit biased, maybe, but I'd highly recommend Ardetha. He's probably one of the best Killer mains in the game, and he has a series on YouTube called the Dark Academy where he watches sent-in footage from players and gives them tips on what they're doing wrong. That kinda stuff will help you develop a better sense for the game, and you can see some nice mind games in action.
---
More than anything, though, practice! Playing against Survivors who are better than you sucks, that much I think we all know from experience. But keep playing. See what they're doing, and eventually you'll see what works for countering their strategies. There are gonna be toxic players in every game, so don't let them ruin the experience for you. Keep going, and eventually you'll make them regret all the BM. ;)
---
Why are u not Nea? Now we have 2 new killers released. Great cosplay from both of u.

Glad the OP is trying to change his mind haha

HOW IS IT A BAD IDEA? It takes way too fucking long to get BP's unless you are a killer running BBQ where you will every game get 60k to 80k guaranteed, if you play survivor get maybe 20k a game if you are lucky and had a good game, but usually still averaging 14k, which is legit nothing. So for $10 every couple months getting cosmetics and increased BP's is a good fucking idea. Like, I dont see how they could give a bonus percentage like fortnite does like every 20 levels of the pass gives a bonus 10% to BP earnings or something which again, is a good idea. I need this explained, why does everybody hate this idea what is 1 bad thing about it? Guarantee i can counter your argument.
---
Use the Offerings and save up some Bloodpoints. It'll be worth it in the long run. And know for next time to use more BP Offerings when you're leveling back up to 50, because you'll definitely have leftovers if you try to save them!
---
I love haddonfield as any killer AMA
---
Looking at all the leaks (and my guesses), it seems like they'll announce:
---
* Anniversary Event
---
* Freddy rework gameplay reveal
---
* Battle Pass
---
* More customisation items like cosmetics for licensed killers and charms
---
* Switch version release date
---
* Mobile version reveal
---
* DbD going free to play later this year
---
I know that, just saying that not all DLCs can be obtained by grinding
---
&gt;You're still not getting hooks you don't earn.
---
That means you are getting hooks that you've earned. This guy isn't toxic, he's just misunderstood!
---
Then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, maybe it‚Äôs random.
---
Behaviour has done stupid ass shit in the past and I'm calling it: they WILL do it again.
---
It is really bad.
---
Slightly = 1%
---
Moderately = 2%
---
Considerably = 3%
---
So chalk pouch specifically would increase your luck by a whopping 1%
---
so in other words be a remotely useful teammate, get paid currency that you can use to get the 20% of items in the shop for FREE that cannot be earned with Shards.
---
A Minecraft crossover would be great.
---
No
---
Fair enough, have a nice day

I play for bps... I'm not sure who doesnt like to have blood points... like literally if I didnt care about points or pipping I'd just dick off each match and not do anything.

What have they done that was stupid like this? People were yelping about auric cells and cosmetics, thinking it'd make the game too cartoony and drive players away, but we're all still here and loving it.
---
Resident Evil 1 mansion with Mr. X.
---
I‚Äôm going to buy it just bc I enjoy the game and wanna help the devs people seem to really hate that reason but oh well
---
When was the last time Behavior implemented something brilliantly though? ü§î
---
Maybe he's not for you then, he plays differently then most killers
---
That‚Äôs some real shit I don‚Äôt play Xbox so it was like uhh Ima high ball it 2 months ago before that major update so you right.
---
Kind of unrelated but I love your style
---
I'd like to hear the reasoning how a battle pass isn't healthy to the game
---
Tbf anyone should be biased against a scheme that milks players for cash.
---
EVERY TIME I SPAWN NEAR ANOTHER SURVIVOR AND A CHEST, THE OTHER SURVIVOR ALWAYS OPENS THE CHEST RIGHT AWAY! FFS CAN YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHERE THE KILLER IS BEFORE ADDING NOISE AND NOTIFICATIONS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE OBJECTIVES?!? IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN TWO PERKS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BRING IN YOUR OWN ITEMS AND NOT TELL THE KILLER WHERE THERE ARE SURVIVORS WHILE I'M AROUND AT THE START OF A MATCH!
---
This made me smile as much as I hate infinity gauntlet memes
---
#NotMyPowerGlove
---
Yup shit is annoying af.
---
I always use all Green bp offerings/Survivor Pudding/Escape Cake on my characters before prestige.
---
Scratched mirror Myers on the hospital it's so much fun
---
Yes.
---
I wouldn't be so worried if they hadn't changed Legion the way they did; but they turned them into a Wraith without a Bell who can press M2 to M1 and then stun themself for 3 seconds. Legion needed fixed, but their fix also killed most of their uniqueness too.
---
It makes me worried the same thing will happen to Freddy; they'll just turn him into a Wraith without a Bell who makes the map all foggy and blue. 
---
I really hope they do a good job with his rework.
---
GOD IM SO SICK OF THE THE FUCKING FACE CAMPING ON PS4!!! FUCK YOU BHVR INTERACTIVE, DO YOU HEAR ME, FUCK YOU!!! All YOU FUCKING DEVS CAN GO FUCK YOURSELVES!!! YOUR THE ASSHOLES WHO GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT ON CAMPING AND EVERY LITTLE BASTARD ASSHOLE ON PS4 IS ABUSING IT BECAUSE OF YOUR INCOMPETENT DECISIONS! 3 GAMES IN A ROW FACE CAMPED AND ALL 3 DEPIPPED! ONLY TIME IVE BEEN ON TODAY, CAMPEDDDDD 
---
BET I WONT GET ANY RESPONSE FROM ANY OF YOU FUCKING DEVS!!! I WISH I COULD SAY THIS TO YOUR FUCKING FACES BECAUSE I WOULD!!!!
---
Probably their revenge for being palet looped, flashlight spammed and tea bagged. Just a guess
---
Clown and Billy aren‚Äôt on the same level at all, IMO
---
Tbh a lot of cosmetics used to be earned through playtime. I don't mind cosmetics needing to be unlocked or anything if there is an objective to it. But if it's just "Just keep playing" then it gets boring fast when instead of having fun and looking forward to BP and Pips I'm more so just annoyed that I didn't get a lot of point a match. 
---
I only bring this up because the only time I played Fortnite was in season 3 for that Reaper skin. It got boring after a while and I started searching up how the game awarded battle pass points during the time and just grinded the best way I could after waiting for challenges. If the battle pass is out I would hope that the $10 also comes with a large amount of challenges or at least the few challenge they have awarded a HUGE amount of battle pass progress
---
Play Pig so you can tbag them after hooking. Not really though.
---
You miss timed the stun if you were wondering. That's why he didn't drop the guy.
---
trapper's taking the kids
---
I don't get the tears, I'm hype for a mobile version as long as it's good!
---
Lmao look at you. No one had a flashlight, palet lopping is legit and I never even saw it, and no one tea bagged... soooo fuck off with your bullshit. As if any of that is even remotely comparable.
---
Yea, you pretty much get to do one then it‚Äôs ggs, lol.
---
His power is completely useless. I would suggest either not using the power or just swapping to a different killer because he is complete garbo... still
---
I meant in general you little salt boi XD
---
I just played a game as nurse to get adept nurse and the same thing happened to me.
---
Tbh I think most people just don't care.
---
It‚Äôs messed up because of the two-killer bug. It seriously janks up the entire game, you should have seen what it was like when she threw her hatchets. They had no momentum so they wouldn‚Äôt go forward, they would just swing in place and fall slowly to the ground, spinning.
---
&gt;Their sole purpose is to make you feel like you have to play the game because of sunk cost.
---
I tried the game during Season 6. Played it like 3/5 of the way through S6, entirely through S7, and then beginning of S8. I lost interest because the friend I had been playing with wasn't playing anymore. And I had the S8 Battle Pass to boot, after rushing as much as possible to get the S7 Battle Pass. If I can get over it, anyone else can. 
---
I hate that stupid "think of the poor addicted people"! mindset. I can understand being concerned for kids but for adults, they should be expected to moderate themselves with anything. DBD is a grindy game as it is and people could end up addicted to it. Are you going to cry for BHVR to add in "anti-addiction" mechanics? 
---
"oh but Battle Passes are intentionally manipulative!" In what way? In that they offer cosmetics you might not be able to get again, that only takes realizing you'll never EVER have everything to stop caring? That's why I stopped taking any of that stuff anything close to seriously. While it's fine to want to not miss out on something, there's any number of reasons you may not be able to obtain something. So anyone who still frets about it is, in my opinion, not worth being concerned about. I don't see why anyone spares a second thought for the morons of the world in cases like this.
---
Consider that edgy or... Whatever. But I will gladly tell anyone off, who says they keep playing a game beyond the point of it being *fun* just because they need their COSMETICS. Seriously. If it's manipulative, and you're TOLD it's manipulative, but you don't make any effort to try and stop? You're pathetic.

Map: Spencer Mansion

What is battlepass?
---
"Laughs in NOED" 
---
Lol that cracked me up. Gotta love the salt people bring into this game
---
His video of yesterday if I'm correct, was where a Dwight got sandbagged by a Meg(?) in a killer shack. His instant reaction was to drop the Dwight chase and go for Meg. Pretty good sign that he's like this when he's not recording as well, yeah.
---
I HATE IT THAT WITH THIS UPDATE HILLBILLY CAN NOW BREAKS PALLETS AND DOWN YOU AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE CHAINSAW
---
I bet you get upset after someone flashlight saves
---
No it maked you pay real world money in exchange not for items but the ability to GRIND for items. Items that even though you PAID for them, can be lost to you if you aren't able to meet the time committment of the grind that season.
---
It's a bullshit business model that forces players to play in grindy ways and foresake actually caring about each match in favor of the grind and forces you to feel obligated to play the game constantly to not lose your investment.
---
It's not fun for anyone. It only benefits the devs with an essential monthly subscription model.
---
FUCK THE DEVS AND PRESTIGEING ANY OF MY SURVIVORS, TO MUCH OF A GRIND FEST THEY DONT OFFER ANYTHING WONDERFUL AT PRESTIGE 1-2-3 SO WHY BOTHER, OH SOME BLOOD ON MY SURVIVOR? BIG WHOOP IM JUST GONNA MAX MY PEEPS OUT ANS NOT WASTE MY TIME AT PRESTIGE
---
Thanks for quoting the entire comment you were replying to, just in case someone missed it the first time.
---
Because sometimes people want human interaction to make sure information is still up to date or just would like something answered in a different way.  He is being downvoted because he being kind of a jerk in the way he is phrasing it. Its fine to be frustrated by lots of similar questions but I'd argue it helps build that sense of commubity and belonging. It encourages participation on reddit and hopefully should help get people to stick. Bring on the questions and the new people i say.
---
In fact I don‚Äôt really get too upset since it‚Äôs just a game, if you lose learn from it lol
---
[**she's a thot**](/intensifies)
---
It's mocking you for running Urban
---
Practice basically, also see if you can get the perks BBQ, and Ruin because they help you get the blood points to upgrade your killers and help you slow the game down. Other than that basically just learn how survivors act and when to mind game at certain places.
---
I can't imagine you have many hours in the game, but just for reference I currently have over 700 and it took me till about 100 to get a hold of all of the tricks you can do as a base killer to become better.
---
Like all things in life, practice practice practice.
---
Also what confused me more, was that Claudette was Rank 8.
---
It wastes everyone‚Äôs offerings tho, especially things like cakes and bps
---
to be honest they made frenzy useless to the point I don't even use it
---
I wish it would go F2P and just give all that purchased the game auric cells. And you only start with the basic survivors and killers and cosmetics. Then the game would be a lot more populated, the paywall just to play is detrimental in my opinion.
---
Learn from someone endgame trolling? Please enlighten
---
I‚Äôm only for it if it will give BhVR a new cash infusion so they can hire some better programmers and more of them to improve the game quality. So when they drop a new DLC or patch and it‚Äôs not loaded with bugs and if so can quickly be patched, not waiting weeks to months later plus throwing in more licensed killers/survivors.
---
Yeah haha like I said I just went by my experience and in my games every wraith I‚Äôve gone up against has absolutely dominated, some of his add ons are insane too
---
It's like the Herobrine of DBD except it actually exists.
---
But it is one person who has exposed. I think you are right about the movement speed. But it also only applies to full totems, not lit ones.
---
Move wraith to C, legion to D, and Clown to B
---
Pharmacy is amazing. The only time I use self care is if all of my perk options are bad and I don‚Äôt have pharmacy (usually only survivor dailies)
---
If they did, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. They keep their items at least I guess
---
Who knew that luck timing and a single key press makes you grow an ego on par with that of the current US president, if not bigger.
---
&gt;"hes hitting a button to attempt to make me mad" vs
---
"hes NOT hitting a button to attempt to make me mad"
---
Wraith is criminally underrated IMO, legions bad but not on the level as Freddy and leatherface and clown is already in B
---
he probably DC around step 2 lol
---
Why don't they give exclusive cosmetics for ranking up instead of a fucking battle pass
---
I feel like Freddie is a P3 Claudette counter as well. He finds them relatively easily as they don't know which direction he's coming from and once slept they can't hide. Your stereotypical Claudette is also shit in a chase, perfect for Freddie.
---
Bruh accept your death like a man lol.
---
You know he‚Äôs never gonna earn enough bloodpoints with those rules.
---
Would you like to:
---
* Look almost identical to the base skin?
---
or
---
* Seriously disadvantage yourself with neon colors?
---
So I was reading through /u/sinsmi's reply and I noticed one point in particular that I wanted to focus on:
---
&gt;People want more game to play. People don't want quests and activities
---
As sinsmi mentions, people clearly DO want quests and activities if the Battle Pass is so successful. If the cosmetics weren't worthwhile, people wouldn't do the quests. I'm reminded of a Christmas event they had in Fortnite which was REALLY grindy for the stuff you could get. People complained because while the stuff was free, the grind for the stuff wasn't worth it for those who got upset.
---
But when people are complaining about just that one event being grindy and NOT the Battle Pass, it tips you off to what people enjoy and don't enjoy.
---
Now maybe you want to say "Well those are just the mindless idiots! Who cares? Those people aren't the ones who CARE!" If not, fair enough. But if you do, it's worth saying that the complaints about the event being grindy were on the Fortnite SUBREDDIT. If you feel the subreddit is supposed to be the place for the players who "care", you're going to be sorely disappointed.
---
So why is that relevant here? Well! If we DO get a Battle Pass, and you DON'T like the way it's going, make sure you call out more than just BHVR. If you're going to keep complaining and not just leave, that is. Because if people on here are defending something that's "grindy" or a "Skinner box", and you're only attacking the company and not the people who SAY they want more of a grind or Skinner box?
---
You're wasting your time. If you believe that a company only uses Battle Passes or whatever to make money and that they mainly listen to money, then you should be attacking those who MAKE them money. And again, if those people are on this subreddit, then you and everyone else who's opposed can call them out.
---
I've proposed this solution in other subreddits and no-one ever takes me up on it, and I don't know why. You can't say a company is "greedy" or "money-hungry" (by company standards that is) and then just ignore those who FEED them money. No company would ever BE "greedy" if there weren't people rewarding them for those kinds of behaviors.
---
I mean theres a shit ton of useless items in this game broken key to name one
---
It‚Äôs always better to know if the killer is coming for you. You may be able to loop, but if you don‚Äôt have a safe pallet and get surprised by the killer you will take a hit. Spine chill will warn you earlier and let you escape a hit
---
Why wouldnt I be chill üòÇ This is entertaining. You even go all serious mode to defend the 1000th survivor rules post. You are even blowing up arguments so seriously to defend your topic while its supposed to a joke or funny. Meanwhile I couldnt care less than the dcing survivor :/ relax dude, you got your karma haha
---
Are you fucking kidding me. NO I WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS.
---
Haddonfield is honestly not that bad of a map.
---
The Swamp is the worst in my opinion.
---
If you don't like it, don't get it. No one is making you. It's all going to be cosmetics and the like anyways, so just...you know, don't get it?
---
Ralph's rules you sheep now pay attention!
---
Wow.
---
Self care? That‚Äôs a survivor perk. Or am I missing something?
---
Legions power is pure hinderance. Everything that was good is now gone
---
The reason for the outrage ia that people don't want to pay for extra rewards. Look what happened with Battlefront 2!
---
&gt; I'm right.
---
But they're fine with paying for a 20 dollar skin?
---
Oooo
---
It is. But an essential aswell as Ruin and BBQ.
---
Hey man I get some good jukes using urban FeelsBadMan
---
Yeah I agree he‚Äôs got nothing special but compared to the likes of Freddy he ain‚Äôt as trash because freddys ability actually gives him a disadvantage
---
It costs $10 and that's just cosmetic. Not for rewards, that's just bullshit.
---
Well to be fair in the "good old days" people continuously reference there was no such thing as post-release content. 
---
I grew up during the times when games were a box-purchase, never to be thought of again by the developers. Any bug or glitch you could find was never fixed. No such thing as "new characters" or gamemodes. It's kind of just a fact of business that supporting a game 3 years after release like DBD needs a revenue source other than game purchases, which tend to stagnate/slow after the release period.
---
The ignorance in your post is astounding.
---
Missing out on a max level limited time cosmetic is one thing on a free pass.
---
But if your cosmetic is locked behind level 100 on your pass and you need to play 2 weeks worth of gametime straight to get to level 100, plenty of people are gonna pay BECAUSE they want that cosmetic.
---
But now what happens when real life happens and they can't get on as much as they wanted to?
---
Now they PAID for something they can't get.
---
Selling cosmetics is one thing.
---
Selling the ability to WORK towards a CHANCE at a cosmetic is nonsense. And people who think it's 'not a big deal' are the reason loot boxes, battle passes and $15 for a single fucking skin is the norm on every game now.
---
You used to pay $5 for an ENTIRE costume pack for every char in the game.
---
Now we pay $10-15 A costume or pay $5-$15 for a loot box with a CHANCE at the costume you want all because you people keep supporting it and saying 'It's not a big deal. Stop being entitled.'
---
It's not entitled to not want to be ripped off and not support gambling in my video games.
---
I'll happily pay for cosmetics. Just don't piss on your customers.
---
Just do it, I'm sure it'll work out well.
---
It was
---
If other licensed cosmetics go well I think BHVR could work something out. People want it, and money talks.
---
Placeholder
---
Our voices may be heard, but it will not affect the devs. BHVR will continue the Battlepass idea and the only way we can stop it is by stop playing the game until they give in
---
Thanks for your help. I've since become better at dealing with Wraight and Pig. Myers however, I'm working on.
---
Then DONT buy it they are gonna have rewards for the people that don't spend a dime on the battlepass. Also if they do the battlepass the way they should it should only be a one time purchase as you should be able to get the needed amount of "in-game" currency as a reward  from the battlepass to buy the next pass with some extra to get what you want from the store but that is IF they do it that way which they should as it is the way battlepasses were intended. But don't get mad at me for saying "its just cosmetics" because it is they add very little to no change of actual gameplay. I have a lot of hours as killer and survivor and never once was mad over someone using a more camouflage cosmetic. I see absolutely no problem with a battlepass and i actually am excited for it. So if you don't like it uninstall the game and stop fucking complaining over every little thing that doesn't go your way
---
I‚Äôm at devotion 6 on console, the 30k+ iridescent shards are nice i guess
---
From what the video showed, the battle pass will have only cosmetics, shards, and blood points. Maybe auric cells if we're lucky as premium currency is usually given within battlepasses but at small amounts.
---
So far no unfair advantage was shown.
---
2013 remake Freddy. Looks similar, but he's meant to look more like a real burn victim.
---
Nerfing DS.
---
Freddy gets aura reading I‚Äôm asleep survs and with the right addons can either get his terror radius down to 4 meters with a 3 second sleep or incredibly rare skill checks. I take base Freddy over legion with the best addons. 
---
His power lets him vault pallets and windows slightly faster, give survivors deep wounds, and gives him a bit of a speed boost. Freddy gives free aura reading, survivors will have to miss skill checks to escape buying as much time as deep wounds would, best stealth in the game besides scratched mirror Myers. Freddy is just so hard to play as.
---
Dude. Those are two of my favorite categories on Twitch. This is kind of wonderful. XD
---
Oh god, hitting people doing 360s will be impossible without a ridiculously amount of auto aim
---
Did your parents love you as a child?
---
Absolutely. I love this game and want it to succeed to be huge. I just really hope they focus on using extra profit too fix parts of the game that are broken.
---
Thank you.
---
Spine Chill works better against her, it‚Äôs a really good perk against any killer that isn‚Äôt scratched mirror Myers (I don‚Äôt play immersed, it just gives you a nice heads up)
---
Only reason to disconnect is if real happens. It‚Äôs just a game either way but if something comes up irl then disconnect but don‚Äôt rage quit
---
lol Yeah I got used to them. Thanks. I'm working on Myer's now, he's too very hard to go up against.
---
Yeah freddys biggest con is simply the fact he can‚Äôt hit survivors straight away, as soon as the gates are open he‚Äôs fucked. Luckily he‚Äôs getting a rework soon anyway so he should be higher up soon
---
New leaks from a test build featuring a "Premium Pass" screen with tiered rewards.
---
Thanks. I've gotten used to Wraight and Pig. Myer's on the other hand. Idk what to do.
---
He escaped from DS3, He's a renown scholar.
---
A true main of culture I see. Well played
---
I've been fortunate enough to not have met one yet lol
---
Simple. If the killer stands still for too long, the entity stuns them for 10 seconds.
---
Killer can hook the survivor and if he stands in a radius around the hook the timer stops maybe?
---
Its a meme thing. Just like when she tried to crouch under you.
---
Nemesis would be too powerful considering his potential for ranged attacks (Tentacle, rocket launcher, etc.) combined with his speed. I mean you could make him hag speed but even in RE3 Nemesis could run faster than the player's sprint. 
---
Tyrant would fit better considering RE2's remake is more recent while RE3 is from the late 90's IIRC.. Only issue is Mr. X instead of being super fast like Nemesis, would be too goddamn slow to catch up to survivors. 
---
Still would be cool if he had effectively no terror radius, and his footsteps would be EXTREMELY loud (Not really volume wise, but in hearing distance) like in RE2 similar to the Huntress's Lullaby. Have Black Impact (His music in RE2) replace the chase music. 
---
There was a concept for a killer called [The Smasher](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Smasher) and maybe the idea of smashing through obstacles could fit Mr. X considering how he was pretty much unstoppable in OG RE2 and the remake, often crashing through walls to cut you off.
---
So in the end you get a killer who is slow, can crash through certain walls, (Maybe how you're supposed to catch survivors?) and has loud footsteps instead of a terror radius meaning you can possibly mindgame. Would be a pain to balance.
---
Myer's with M&amp;A?
---
The speculation is it is not a port but it's own version. Even though high end phones dont have a huge issue running a 60fps game.
---
I was so close to adept pig, but someone dced when I downed them on their death hook, so I got 8 hook events instead of 9. Everything else was iridescent and it was a pain because I‚Äôm ass with pig, so it‚Äôs gonna be a while before I even try that again.
---
I have like 20 more emergency Medkits than anything else
---
 Ginger snaps!
---
You forgot seeing 3 yellow people running at you as a group when you're on the hook and not being camped with the killer right behind them.
---
Obvious cheating. Nothing else.
---
Come out with Dead By Daylight 2 like they use to back in the day lol!
---
Fun times
---
Context is a bitch, I know.
---
Wow, that's what you think? It all makes sense now.
---
Yeah that's my only problem is the hatch. It's mostly just who gets lucky and finds the hatch first. 
---
Also the survivor who gets the hatch is usually the one who sacrificed someone else so they wouldn't get chased.
---
Maybe depending on how well the survivor played the hatch spawns closer or farther away from them. So the hatch would be something you get if you did well.
---
Fuck. Dead by battlepass
---
Facecamp is a strategy, a bad one, but a strategy nonetheless.
---
Ok but Lapidot tho?
---
I have 83 emergency kits so far and I'm aiming for 1000.
---
That‚Äôs the only way to balance the game!1!1
---
Rank has meaning in that those who make it actually earn it its not just given. I use to rank 1 surv every season in like a week. Since the new update Ive made it to rank 4. I understand my skill set is not rank 1 despite my hours played. If you want a pip you need to do everything involed with your role. Gen rushing is not all you need anymore. If you tunnel or camp its gonna cost you emblems. If rank or pipping matters to you maybe play a better game. Let people get hook saves instead of proxy camping til someone is in struggle. Its irritating at times but the new system is designed to ensure a better experience overall. Sure you can snowball a match if mistakes are made but it means you dont pip.
---
TL;DR: Honestly if your not getting a pip repeatly enough to gripe Id bet your smurfing.(but that would imply that rank matters)
---
I use all of my good add ons/offerings and make sure I have somebody else I can play while I level the newly prestiged character.
---
Do you need to be reminded what real face camping was? The killer use to be able stand in front of the hook and there was nothing anyone could do to save. They‚Äôve explored nerfs to it a long time ago including one where if someone was being camped the bar would go down slower which resulted in longer camping. Right now killers lose points towards emblems for staying too close to the hook. I also can‚Äôt count the amount of times I‚Äôve seen what should be a 1k turn into a 2-3 even 4K because survivors become over altruistic. Easiest way to counter camping is doing gens
---
I fought a legion who was trying to complete a achievement with a Memento Mori and they were being toxic as hell, but after he killed me and the game ended he messaged me and apologized for using the mori. I have also been messaged by swf players while I was playing as huntress.(I'm a survivor main so this was my first time playing huntress and it's on a PS4 so the hatchet throwing is terrible.) 3 survivors bad already escaped so I led the last one towards the hatch knowing that there was no way for me to get him and let him escape. He messaged me after and thanked me. 
---
The matching on PS4 is ass. Keep in mind I was a rank 19 killer fighting rank 8's
---
I usually tap if they try to 360 and lunge around corners or at window just like i do with spirit and with her it always works
---
Hell yeah!! Thanks man!
---
WTF? That‚Äôs the stupidest shit I‚Äôve ever seen!
---
we'll see. the cosmetic store was made out to be a death sentence and people love it.
---
The devs said on the last stream that body blocking so that a player is sacrificed via EGC is not the intended design, so they very well could give a soft ban if reported and provided video evidence.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your forte i see.
---
If mommy doesn‚Äôt cut the crust off my PB&amp;J I Dc, just my rules lol. This guy is a hardcore toxic Survivor. I wonder how he is with the wife and kids!
---
Only if you got in
---
You're speaking to scott. DamnNoHtml is his youtube name (and probably his reddit account too).
---
You should be able to expect a game to work if it has a price to entry and isn't early access.
---
Is that air your breathing right now? From the Matrix
---
It is because once people peak at playing Spirit, she basically becomes slightly less brutal than Nurse and very unfun to play against, no malice towards the Spirit player though
---
If someone is holding the game hostage, by the killer blocking you in a corner or a survivor hiding in lockers after everyone else is gone or something like that, I'd say that's justified to disconnect from. It's up to you whether you want to lose the BP for the match, but it's still justified either way.
---
I agree but they'd complain that survivors, as a whole, are nerfed. That's a good idea though.
---
At the end of the day, I'm neither for or against a battle pass in DBD. The thing I do want to talk about however is the mobile version. While yes, DBD isn't Fortnite nor PUBG, but both of those games went mobile and PLENTY of people play them. How bad could DBDs port to mobile be?
---
What‚Äôs he gonna do when dedicated servers come out? That‚Äôs the real question. Dude will be insta van the first day and probably the first one banned.
---
A Battle Pass could be fun i think.
---
DBD Episode 5: The Killer‚Äôs Strike Back
---
This. So much this. Have a red arrow.
---
This is good taste
---
It's a lot better now half the picket fences have been gutted with walkways. It's still annoying though.
---
Aren't those two the loudest breathers in the fucking game though? Nurse is literally wheezing so loud, my ears pop when working on a gen, and Waluigi Spirit constantly moans and groans even when she is standing still.
---
Try to master the basics before trying to master killer specific tactics
---
Pretty sure he dc'd when you said "I am gonna-".
---
Then stop whining and don‚Äôt buy it.
---
i would shit my pants of i saw that ingame
---
Maybe they want to see the new animation...
---
That example isnt accurate at all.
---
Kinda like how survivors used to hold games hostage? Huh
---
I think a day or two ago, I played with a Dwight and I jokingly called him my brother. I found a flashlight and gave it to him and we both made it out. Today, I played against him today as survivors. (he was Billy) He steamrolled us and we had two disconnects, but he found me in a closet and let me get hatch. Noticed it was him and I was surprised he actually remembered me. Wholesome game.
---
How the hell is Billy not one of your favs. Sniping people on Coldwind? Come on mannn ü§£
---
That's a cursed ground totem anyway, so gl.
---
I guess you can say that they have
---
Discordance
---
What is this from?
---
Why do I have to pay for the game, the dlcs, and anything else,I want, to NOW have to pay for this or be left out?
---
If this isn't free, I'm uninstalling till its gone. This isn't a free game, you cant put a battlepass in there to deny content becuase we already payed.
---
Thanks!
---
Extreme tunneling, when I had a good connection and it mysteriously gets laggy, survivors working with the killer. 
---
But sometimes even in those cases I don‚Äôt dc.
---

*"If you don't like the food you get in our Food Pass and don't want to work on register for hours to UNLOCK food you paid for then just don't buy the food pass."*
---
Can you honestly not grasp the point being made?
---
Paying for a cosmetic you want is one thing. You're exchanging your money for something you want no different than going to a store and buying the food you want.
---
Having the food you want however locked behind you needing to not JUST pay for it, but also then grind endlessly for it and STILL run the risk of never earning that food you wanted because the 'season' ended is just bullocks practices.
---
It's like loot boxes that you pay for a CHANCE at an item you want.
---
It's garbage that has no business in a video game.
---
Sell the shit you want to sell. Don't sell me a CHANCE at it.
---
Say you're wanting just one outfit, wouldnt you rather just buy that outfit instead of buying the entire pass full of cosmetics you probably don't care about, and then having to grind it out before the time limit runs out? If you completed the entire pass, then yeah it's a great deal, but unless it's like the only game you play, most people don't end up doing that.
---
As for dances, I could see them adding in emotes, but not dances. Dances are too silly for a game like this.  With certain emotes designed for different killers, it could be cool to see and could fit in the game. But as soon as the Hag starts flossing, that ruins any kind of immersion the game had.
---
This looks oddly familiar... oh wait, it‚Äôs just every survivor main‚Äôs rules of the 100s of survivors who‚Äôve DC from my game in my career when I just try to play a fair killer game.
---
Yesterday I had 6 games in a row where 2 or 3 people quit after one hook or down. It happens more often than it should.
---
I'll take Haddonfield over Ormond any day.
---
..............In no way shape or form is your example comparable.
---
On Xbox I‚Äôve messaged quite a few camping killers after the match and most of the time, they‚Äôve said they did it because of the previous match they were griefed to hell and back by a SWF group. 
---
I‚Äôve said this before, the game would improve ten fold if they had their own servers.
---
DBD is way to grindy, imagine with a battlepass. Youll need to sell your sould to the devil to get shit done on this game.
---
Your example is awful. Refrain from using it. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about a loot box either. Loot boxes are different than play time rewards. I don‚Äôt care about getting cosmetics if I can control them. 
---
If you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to get them, don‚Äôt buy the battle pass. Pretty simple. 
---
Stop getting bent out of shape because you don‚Äôt want this in the game.
---
I get it. Depends on whether you mind the grind or not. Hopefully they'll make them available for purchase since this is a paid game.
---
They make PLENTY of money on the current cosmetic shop. All the players constantly in-game with the newest cosmetics proves this.
---
There's literaly no need for garbage like this in the game.
---
Yeah and the fanbase shut that shit down quick. Battlefront 2 is an amazing game and has been for over a year now. If bhvr gets ahold of this community with this type of shit, the community will just fall apart like sand.
---
Or fixing the party system so I don't have to disconnect and invite my friends after each match.
---
Or is there a solution for that?
---
All these people are so happy to take this for some reason. This is the slippery slope, do they not see that?
---
The very first DLC, people were excited for extra content. Then that "extra" content became content simply removed from the base game. And so on and so forth, until we get to lootboxes and battlepasses.
---
I don't fucking WANT all of my games to have a battle pass. It's a stupid mechanic that is ripped straight out of the mobile game market handbook.
---
When we learned we could have games on our phone, we hoped we would get games akin to what we knew. But instead we see less content that costs more, and now our console/PC games are slowly becoming the same.
---
Battle pass? Sorry I don't know anything about this can someone please explain? That might be just because I didn't watch the stream but I am kinda afraid about that.
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until he has rancor
---
Ok. Were the emails already sent?
---
I'm using iron grasp 3, unnerving presence 3, unrelenting 3 and hex: No one escapes death 1 on Myers and overcharge3, distressing 3, overwhelming presence 3, and unrelenting 3 on the doctor
---
If anything I hope they do what they do with event gear. After the pass ends, you should be able to purchase individual pieces of outfits. Even if it's at an elevated price, it's the only thing that would make me feel okay about the battle pass.
---
Save up. Use all (or the ones that will give you most) BP offerings before presteiging. If you can get any perks or addons that will stack also
---
WHY CANT I EVER FIND MATCHES AS KILLER I SEE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE 5 YEARS AGO. WHY IS THIS GAME A BUGGY FUCKFEST STILL? SERIOUSLY I CANT FIND A SINGLE SURVIVOR IF I TRY TO FIND A MATCH AS KILLER WTF DO I DO
---
Yes, they make plenty of money already. Therefore the battle pass is pointless. They couldn't give two fucks what skins we have. They just want us to buy autistic cells and battle passes. 
---
Next year will be "battle pass season 2". This community is boned lol. Hope your wallets are fat.
---
I god damn love spine chill
---
"Just don't buy it" is the excuse everyone has used for every microtransaction ever. That does NOT hold water anymore. The creation and perpetuation of these kinds of tactics *does* influence our games, and not for the better.
---
Slippery slope.
---
I hear this HAL looking steering wheel quite clearly in my head.
---
This is really nice! Did you make the mask or did you buy it? Also the blue hair does look really nice on Susie, future cosmetic?
---
FUCKING BATTLE PASS TALK,,,, FOH
---
Someone found and unlocked it partially in the code. I think you can find a video on this sub.
---
Your name is Lergion. The face is funny.
---
umphhhh mommy huntress üòç
---
It appears it's been added to the games files, maybe in PTB.
---
This is the only way I would be ok with this mechanic.
---
Done!
---
Self care + Botany Knowledge is the shit
---
Exactly! I have no problems with Haddonfield, My Shirtless Myers gets his 4k and smokes a cigar afterwords while laughing from the Strode balcony!
---
Aww, come on, trapper is a lot of fun
---
[Looks that way](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=ymHRFuxSUag&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGmj5ShlGOhA%26feature%3Dshare)
---
Yup it‚Äôs the new Haddonfield! I guess they let deaf Jeff pass this thru quality control m!
---
I guess your right
---
But she ain't be needing none

[Looks like they are incorporating a grindy BattlePass, a la Fortnite](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=ymHRFuxSUag&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGmj5ShlGOhA%26feature%3Dshare)
---
Don't need to play to know it's a scam lol.
---
Adding a battle pass will literally only be a positive you twats you don‚Äôt have to pay for it because you will get skins and rewards even if you don‚Äôt pay for it so basically all this is is just a way to get rewards for playing the game and making the grind more fun YOU KNOW THING THING ALL YOU TARDS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR seriously some people just want to be unhappy
---
[It exists](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=ymHRFuxSUag&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGmj5ShlGOhA%26feature%3Dshare)
---
I think its fine the way it is. The rng makes it more fair.
---
One of my favorites is body blocker hag. Scarred hand and waterlogged shoe is fun as fuck and gives you a shit load of deviousness bloodpoints
---
The last game I played I used legion, level 3. 1 perk of the lowest quality, no add-ons. Got teabagged and ran around forever they weren't even trying to repair. Game ends and they all have good ass perks and items. I'm killer level 18 and they were all 14 or lower. Most toxic shit of my life. They talked shit in endgame chat too.
---
If I didn't like the game so much I'd probably quit off the community alone and I've been playing about 2 weeks lol.
---
Again you miss the entire point.
---
Let's say you see Tier 100 has this awesome Meg cosmetic that's exclusive to it. Meg's your main and you never would buy shit like this but you really want that Meg Cosmetic badly so you drop the money on the Pass and start your grind. You have an entire month to do this, no prob.
---
Now the next day you get swamped at work and get stuck there working late. This happens all week. You weren't expecting it.
---
You finally get a little more playtime in on the weekend. Grind more.
---
Next three weeks you get more work swamp, a wedding, you got sick, and a dozen other reasons you didn't plan for that prevented you getting on the game much that month.
---
Well guess what? You paid that money just to get that Meg skin. It was the ONLY reason you bought the pass. And now you don't even get the skin because life got in the way.
---
Let's not even get into the fact that grinding FOR those max tier skins causes players to focus on the grind, not the game and thus increases behavior that hurts teammates in matches.
---
If unhooks are the best way to grind BP/Pips to level up? Enjoy literaly everyone hook farming each other endlessly and getting everyone killed constantly.
---
Look at Black Ops 4 to see how terrible a battle pass system can be.
---
i rely on devour hope a lot to win my games
---
She makes crinkle noises c^:
---
This doesnt fit my narrative of dbd being toxic so I refuse to acknowledge this encounter
---
And this is why there needs to be punishment for tards like these they ruin the game but I‚Äôve actually had degenerate wastes of space actually defend DCing
---
Had some farmers last night. Leatherface had Franklin's and he hit me and his buddies stole my red key. It was totally fun. So after the gens popped I started the egc timer on them.
---
The problem, as I see it, is that this a potentially slippery slope. The first DLC ever (and DLC in general) was a good idea. Then games eventually got greedier, and what was originally extra content for extra money became content that should have been included in the base game but is now locked away behind a paywall. 
---
I'm not going to lie, as a player here since the first month of DBD, I don't have real trust in BHVR's care for their community. They've made some real progress since month 1, but not without a MILLION missteps that players had to attempt to reel back.
---
Might want to look in the mirror
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The game is overpriced imho and I love it. On top of it you‚Äôre buying multiple DLC‚Äôs that are 8 bucks each and now battle passes on top of it? I think tf not
---
That outfit made it clear to me that a lot of folks in this community are into necrophilia
---
When the killer finds me. I CANNOT stand being outplayed in this game. Sometimes I disconnect if I hear the heartbeat.
---
For the idiots whining about the battle pass guess what you don‚Äôt have to buy it you still get FREE SKINS for grinding they literally added a way to get more skins without having to buy them and even if you do buy the battle pass you‚Äôll get more skins for cheaper so basically all this is is just a cheaper and even FREE way to get skins but I guess people just love to complain
---
I think the game should be free to play but it is still optional, you don‚Äôt NEED all of the perks. You‚Äôre just over dramatic tbh
---
Yup I‚Äôve had nothing but straight face camped games since I got on at 9pm played 7 games and 2 were somewhat okay, the rest was hooked and face camped with chainsaw ready to go from billy! PS4 has turned into a straight camp fest because the devs gave the green light on it being a non ban able offense!
---
Team Fortress 2 gave premium membership for members who bought the game before the f2p.
---
When Woolie is nervous he crouches, thereby making other people nervous.
---
Aye, that she does, mate. That she does.
---
Buy headphones and crank the volume way up. It‚Äôs your new best friend. You need to rely on audio now! Enjoy, she‚Äôs a blast. Sounds are really faint/light now and should be getting better.
---
I actually feel bad for him, must suck to be scared of falling asleep.
---
how does it feel getting looped by balanced landing users? must be fun.
---
It‚Äôs all fun in games until The Nurse teleports out of her grasp and proceeds to end her pitiful existence
---
There was a small patch on ps4 for it. It said they were aware of it, removed the ability for it to happen, and would be banning anyone caught doing it.
---
then look at fortnite and see how good it can be. feel how you want about the game, but they give you ample time and the missions are easy to do.
---
Umm why isn‚Äôt pig above everyone else? üê∑
---
Aim around the neck
---
Isn't the answer as simple as not buying the Battle-Pass then?   I am not getting why so many people are getting worked up over this.
---
Maybe people are mad that they could earn bloodpoints faster and unlock better perks? It‚Äôs the only thing I could see someone being mad about. Doesn‚Äôt bother me any, not a huge fan of cosmetics.
---
My build right now is tinker so I get a head start when I know a gen will pop. I run monitor ambuse to decrease my terror radius so it's easier to double back on a gen I know someone is working with. I use nurses calling because everyone always starts heals as soon as they think they escaped you. The last slot is whatever you think is good for the match. If I see a ton of flashlights I bring lightborn. If I see tool boxes I bring Franklin's. Sometimes I just bring ruin or spirit fury. Rancor is fun too.
---
Honestly nothing, I play the game with the cards I am delt.
---
"You husband now..."
---
At first me neither but people are right, they might actually have a good idea up their sleeve. Willing to give them a chance at least.
---
Right??? So toxic to even be near me. Insta DC
---
Being mad about getting more bp to unlock better perks? Why would that anger people?
---
*I let him go* hmm..judging by your tone, he got away.

Appears so, I talked to a few that got in

Yep, neck area is the sweet spot.
---
Person with 500 hours has BBQ on a few killers. Person with battlepass does it in a week. People might be mad? I‚Äôm not saying I am, just trying to guess at why folks are mad. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter to me.
---
ty
---
I would love a Wes Cravens New Nightmare skin for Freddy and Pretty Lady skin for LeatherFace
---
There‚Äôs a free tier for the battlepass though.
---
It's not just about zero skill. As a killer it's obvious when you are going to lose. A good killer will recognize that. You can do everything right and lose. People need to stop being toxic to killers who are playing right because then it will just turn them toxic. I have a lot of respect for a legit killer that doesnt camp. When a average killer starts losing they will become pretty sometimes and take what they can get. If the killer does this on the first hook then this person probably needs to stop sniffing glue.
---
Yup pink is way better but to each their own
---
I love these! Gorgeous job! üíï
---
A suprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Guys. Best killer would be Jack from 7. Nemesis next.
---
Thank you!!
---
Aim at their chin.
---
Course! Would love to see more :)
---
Yup this is exactly how it‚Äôs been for the past few weeks on PS4 and has only been getting worse! BhVR has a serious camping issue going on and they need to take care of this with PS4. They are the ones who came out and said camping was a non ban able offense. So everyone is doing it and not giving two fucks on points, pips and just wanna ruin the other players experience. I‚Äôve played 7 games tonight and 5 have been straight face camped from the start. I‚Äôve tried getting my friends and cousins to play and they did for a week and then quit playing because of how bad the camping was and then to sit and wait 5-10mins for match just to be camped then tunneled then camped again. So there goes any new players. I wanna hear from a Dev about this and for them to start a discussion on how bad the camping is on PS4.
---
Camping and tunneling, yes. Teleporting, though? Nah.
---
so don't buy it quit your pants pissing Jesus christ
---
Oink.
---
Don't play leatherface.
---
.
---
No but seriously, play another killer. Leatherface is among one of the worst killers in the game. I would recommend Billy, Myers, Clown, or Spirit (although sounds are bugged, so she is tough to play ATM). They are all so much better than leatherface.
---
In before they down you and turns out they have Save The Best For Last so they pick you up before you can jump in
---
Maybe, but I wouldn't really understand that reasoning.
---
Definitely I can't  wait to start more of these
---
It is a VERY good perk, one the best.
---
Yeah!! Remember to post them here so I can appreciate them. :&gt;
---
I don't own clown or spirit and hillbilly is just difficult with a controller
---
Might wanna check what you wrote, buddy.
---
Will do!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
---
Fully agreed, OP!
---
For all the times I have heard complaints about not earning anything for achieving certain ranks, I am also confused why now that it may be possible, it's being hated on with such vigor.
---
They are trying to expand the player base. If you want smaller queues, this is the way to do it.
---
Honest, I love it but should be Ghostface doing the prank call.
---
No. It would have been nice to have the entire outfit ... but the mask is better then nothing.
---
It always happens when there's a large influx of new players m
---
Ok
---
Don't you dare call him a golem.  He's my main and I love him!

---
Didn‚Äôt stop them from releasing nurse and huntress on console.
---
Do you think it's a licensing issue? Because I have also heard there won't be a map or survivor :/
---
*than
---
Lol if you really play league then you already know that community is worse than this one. I wish half those ppl would dc XD better that then kill 40min of my time trying to 3v7 as a support
---
The only thing I could think of is that people are upset about it being a "battle pass". Given the hatred for other games that have also used the idea. Like its a trigger word. If it was just called tiered reward system people would probably be less trigger happy about shooting it down.
---
I agree, Billy can be difficult with a controller (xbox btw), but just with practice I've gotten pretty good with him. Also Myers. Trust me, myers is a great "starter" killer.
---
Who are you replying to with so much hate like that? No one said anything for you to get so defensive....
---
*Plays ICP "We Danced"*
---
Have they announced they‚Äôre releasing this or something? What have I missed!?
---
Devs: 
---
&gt;We removed vacuum pallets because it was unfair.
---
Also Devs and Reddit:
---
&gt;Vacuum Bear Traps aren‚Äôt a thing.
---
OH REALLY?!
---
***table flip***
---
yeah my walking joystick is half broken so hillbilly is impossible to play for me also I do own myers actually I just don't have any good perks on him
---
Yes I agree! üòÇüòÇ
---
I think the best way to get money from your game is by having it be a good game. I know it's not simple to just make a good game, but like microtransactions wouldn't be necessary if everyone saw how good a product was and started buying.
---
Your right, i just realized this after reading your post! I go and check the players profiles after the facecamped  match ends and most of the campers are little kids or a bunch of twats from South America. 
---
I play both survivor and killer, the only time I will camp a survivor is if they wanna teabag, at every pallet with there flashlight and think they are hot shit. But I leave once thieve reached phase 2 because god it‚Äôs so boring and you lose all map pressure.
---
BF2 cost $69.99 USD though, and I paid $79.99 for the deluxe edition. At that cost I shouldn't have to unlock core players with more money.   Most people paid $19.99 at most for DBD, some paid $9.99.
---
Good stuff. I think you could have gotten away with an eyeless mask for Huntress while still keeping the Diniverse style. Something like [Calendar Girl](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/neoencyclopedia/images/9/91/Calendar_girl.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130114035416), who admittedly looks a bit like Rule 63 Myers in that one, but still.
---
WHY THE **FUCK** CANT I TRANSFER MY PS4 ACCOUNT TO PC????
---
I HAVE WORKED SO HARD AND LONG(THATS WHAT SHE SAID) TO GET ALL THE SHIT I HAVE NOW AND ONCE I GET A COMPUTER ALL THAT WILL BE GONE. I DONT EVEN CARE ABOUT BUYING DLC AGAIN I JUST DONT WANT TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR ALL MY CRUTCH PERKS IN THE SHRINE AGAIN.
---
You should get some help.
---
God these are always so satisfying to watch.
---
why is huntress so THICC
---
Dam you‚Äôre one of the people who is toxic on both lol. One of the people you gives up the second you lose lane and has a hissy fit. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to play the 40 minutes out, don‚Äôt! We won‚Äôt miss you
---
I would guess it was the question on the battle pass on the survey the devs posted which obviously nobody really wants, followed by a picture of the dev build battle pass
---
That's not your fault, it's how the company stylized their name. Even their website is bhvr dot com. 
---
I feel ya though. If you're even out of the loop for a few months you might miss out on some new lingo.
---
They can't use the robes from the movies as they don't have the license for it.

JUST LET ME GET THE PLATINUM, MAN.
---
I better get a fucking golden scar with the battlepass

Can someone please eli5? What‚Äôs this about a battle pass wasn‚Äôt this just a meme
---
Thank you! I was going more with Hawlgirls mask style but I could have givin her more eyelashes. I'll keep that in mind when I ink! Thank you for the feed back!! Also yeah its crazy how much she looks like 63 Myers! If she was in in blue not green it would be dead on.
---
If you can actually get it in your BW it‚Äôs arguably one of the best
---
Dude, no lie; I used a chalk pouch offering and Kobe'd that match. Chalk pouch for life.
---
100% agreed.
---
Blue hair is already a thing for Susie.
---
No my guy I‚Äôm actually the one that gets mvp most games bc I carry teams as a support through skill and moral. I‚Äôm not audacious enough to call out your play style on either game, cause I don‚Äôt know you, but judging off your hostile reply it can‚Äôt be too team oriented or strategic
---
I'm still gonna upvote it.  You just need practice.
---
lookin cool joker
---
Oh, my bad i confused another color, silly me
---
Yea. It good.
---
What If the battle pass is free though?
---
The issue is........?
---
I agree, I also think that if released today, most of the complainers would still sign up for it.  It's that knee jerk reaction to hate every change in dbd and blame the devs for everything.
---
Cause shes mommy!!
---
Haddonfield or cheating.
---
I really feel like I'm the only one who doesn't care to be a sacrifice as a survivor... If I die, I die. Still get bloodpoints and help others win. I'll keep the killer distracted and run gens when I need to. If he's going to come after me, I utilize that to every second in the game just to give my teammates time.
---
Only reason I DC is lag and glitch issues. If the game is completely unplayable to me, I leave. By this I mean animations are frozen, I walk forward, and shoot back to my original place, no progress is made when running gens, the killer can strike me from a mile away, I'm hooked but still shown on the killers shoulder, etc. I feel bad, but I can't play, so fuck it.
---
Learn when to switch targets, and know how to handle the loops
---
Wait wait wait, they're actually doing this? What the actual fuck? They should fix the rediculous grind before even considering this kinda shit, whats next? Lootboxes?
---
Is that what being high does? That‚Äôs crazy.
---
I know I‚Äôm pretty late but... could I get your gamer tag too?
---
Guess I'm never touching this game again

So the question now is, how is this going to effect people who bought the game before hand? Do they get the pass for free? Or just some shitty token to commemorate the fact they forked over 40 dollars or less before the game went F2P (assuming it is going that direction, of course). 
---
Also, they are going to be able to differentiate who paid for it and who got it through a service like PS Plus, I would imagine. That'd be a real kick in the balls if people who got it through Plus got whatever paying players end up getting for free as well.
---
i still have no problem farming my team mates

Why so much hate for bubba. He just wants to carve you up for chili :c
---
don't rev your chainsaw at every pallet like a idiot. don't respect pallets. learn how to run tiles, learn when to brake pallets, learn from which side to break pallets. that's everything you need to know
---
I would absolutely love the original Billy Loomis design of Ghostface but some version of him is better than none. I hope it grows on me.
---
One tip I‚Äôve always been given by Doctor players was to not chase in treatment mode. Use it to shock and stun someone from using their environment and then switch back to punishment mode for the hit. It gains you distance. But know that experienced survivors know how to counter doctor very very easily by now. Michael is a little harder because of T3.
---
That's what I'm saying but most would rather complain and uninstall
---
Because it's an overpowered perk like I told you 1 month ago now sit down and stfu like I told you to.
---
Yeah I'm not reading a wall of baseless, angry speculation lmao. 
---
Hope typing it helped sort your issues out.
---
It absolutely was lol.
---
You start off commenting your gatekeepy opinion  as if it is fact. It‚Äôs an opinion bud. Whether a game is more toxic is an opinion. 
---
Then you back it up with an insecure boast, followed by sloppy thesaurus use, and then hypocrisy. Gj
---
If only people reacted this easily after getting camped/tunneled

---
Man the sudden realization I have spent 107$ in just all of the dlcs plus cosmetics makes me feel ashamed. I really like this game too.
---
Yep. And then if i stomp the next survivors I'll feel bad and let those who didn't dc leave most of the time
---
No you don't
---
Is the mobile thing real? Straight up thought it was a meme...
---
I mean, i had a survivor pick haddonfield, ran balanced landing. MoM, DS, OoO, had a damn insta heal and boi ima tell you, watching him get to be 1 of the 2 people who escaped was real sad
---
Actually, ignoring the chest search and the likely going into the basement, it saves about 32 seconds, I just took it off because I knew that was the case. You probably lost if you have to get hit for a third time after being unhooked and you aren't banking on an adrenaline proc, js
---
I really don't understand why people don't want it. Even if you don't want to buy it, you get free bloodpoints from the free pass...

I am. But I understand the reasons why. I‚Äôm partially just happy to finally have him and also hoping that in the end he doesn‚Äôt end up just being a let down or annoying like Legion. I was beyond excited for Legion, because I finally felt like I had Generic Ghostface. Really wish I hadn‚Äôt have instantly bought the DLC and the Blue Hair Susie outfit. At least I got Jeff and his perks out of it though.
---
Give survivors an alternative objective necessary objective like finding gas to repair gens instead of forcing survivors to cleanse totems.
---
They didn't get the rights to the robes, just the mask. 
---
That's likely why this is a solo killer and Prescott isn't gonna be with him
---
I do want them to show the survey though when it does come out.
---
Hag yoo low, Clown too high, Huntress too low.
---
You get specific exclusive cosmetics.  
---
Only for the survivors, I believe.
---
Like a few others have said your example isn‚Äôt the right example. With a battle pass you get to see what you are getting and can decide whether or not to buy it. Food is a necessity and would never work like that anyway. A battle pass isn‚Äôt a necessity and they aren‚Äôt forcing you to buy it.
---
Overall since you‚Äôre this worked up over it just don‚Äôt buy it. As to one of the points you made in the comments, if you see a skin you really like but it‚Äôs at a high tier and you know your job can make you stay after hours then just play every second that you can. Sick? Play anyway, I‚Äôve only been to sick to play games when I‚Äôve been throwing up my guts or shitting out my guts. You made a few good points but those points were counterable by your choices
---
Bum bum bum BUM ba da bum. Hey...got any grapes?
---
Yeah I mean if it gives just cosmetics, no shards, no BP, no celld I don't care, but having bought every dlc I expect to have all the content available to me. And not have extra paywalls.
---
In dota the compendium is fair because the game is free, DBD is anywhere between 20 and 60 bucks.
---
yesterday everyone i knew who was with optus couldnt access dbd or if they could get into games, they kept dcing. you can go read the league of legends or fortnite news too. they both announced that optus had connectivity issues with their games.
---
Thank you so much. This was very informative and helpful! I'll try implementing this into my games.
---
Scream is my favorite horror movie so obviously I‚Äôm disappointed in the game‚Äôs design. Ghostface is supposed to just be a Halloween costume that‚Äôs sold on every corner. Anyone could get their hands on one to carry out whatever violent tendencies they have. That‚Äôs what makes it scary. Giving him this super polished, Assassin‚Äôs Creed-like outfit is so unfaithful to the source material.
---
Carburator, Primper Bulb, Iri Heads, Wooden Horse, Catatonic Boyd Treasure and ataxic respiration.
---
All of those are getting nerfed im the near future though thank god.
---
[Yes.](https://i.imgur.com/wkwTFPm.png)
---
Great help! Thank you!!
---
/s?
---
The devs also consider facecamping not cheating.
---
Best tier list available
---
Which..... at the end of the day.....
---
They'd have to try and fix it. Also it seems there's a difference between you crashing/losing connection and pressing escape, leave game, and confirming it. (A Crash/Connection Loss/Plug Pull results in no sound, while an actual ragequit plays that infamous "Player has died" sound which is pretty much known mostly as the DC sound) 
---
Punish ragequits more severely then. As mentioned the game CAN tell if you actually ragequit vs crashed.
---
Fuck the plague i guess
---
I‚Äôm talking about lobbies with like 300 ping
---
And on console
---
Not much, only tip I can give you that is leatherface related and not general killer related is know when to mallet and when to chainsaw. If a survivor is close enough to a window or pallet then you should just m1. If they aren't then chainsaw. Keep in mind that good survivors are also almost impossible to chainsaw so if you face good survivors then you should mostly m1
---
Intro cinematic, DC
---
If the game goes free to play, what would that mean for PS+ owners (those who got it as a free game last September)? I assume they'd count as "paid players", plus this would mean we wouldn't need the subscription to play it anymore...
---
Free to play means nothing. I guess call of duty doesnt have a game pass. Is the really the only thing people can say? What else pay to win? Except we are paying for cosmetics right? And like 5000 blood points or something lol. That's one add on. People just dont exactly get what they are complaining about. What was the rumor I heard about a paid pass and a free one that gives mostly the same stuff minus cosmetics I'm sure. This is ridiculous.
---
Doesn't matter if it's cosmetic Jim Sterling pointed this out.
---
Oh you want that cool outfit pay money.
---
This is a dangerous slippery slope
---
me too thanks
---
&gt;Mori close app in the loading match.

---
&gt;This is my rules.
---

---
Thank you for your context. I like this. I like all of this.
---
His bottles don't shorten chases. Throwing them slows the Clown by an equal amount as they slow the Survivor.
---
&gt;The second is that he can use the clouds for zoning and force survivors to go where he wants them to go
---
This is placebo, for reason above. The proper play is to ignore the cloud. The effect is too trivial to screw up your loop by avoiding it. Just running through it 95% of the time is the correct play.
---
There's no way Clown can be mid-tier when his power doesn't do anything. You, like most people, just aren't aware of how his Power actually works.
---
Huh, incentive to play? How about because the games fun? Lol. You newer players holy fuck.
---
Even if you have proof you didn‚Äôt camp that match any bubba clips will be met with ‚ÄúI bet you facecamped‚Äù or similar responses.
---
Killer instinct is the state after stabbing someone not affected by deep wounds while in feral frenzy (where you can hear the heartbeat if nearby survivors and see them with the entity symbol)
---
I get that though, day one players knew the way the game used to be, survivors ran rampant and were unstoppable. Some people just can't get over the fact that they used to be really powerful. The changes they've made to the survivor side completely gimp them at this point in the game... they aren't fair trade offs.
---
I don't blame him for D/Cing if he gets camped or gets cheap shotted because the game decided the killer hit him when he was clearly on the other side of a pallet or through a window... it can get frustrating especially if you're tunneled. I usually let 1 of those slide but if keep getting tunneled and down because of window / pallet hits, I'd do the same.
---
I don't agree that he DC's if the hatch gets closed though, that's just being a bitch, I usually camp a gate and hope the killer doesn't come to that one first, if they're far enough apart, you can still make it out. 
---
The mori thing I can agree with because killers like to troll the best survivor with those. They should be reworked or BNP's need to be buffed again, either or. Killers use mori's to kill the best survivors, outright and it just feels like a cheap victory for the killer. The survivor never got to show their true potential because the killer cut them down short for a cheap and shallow victory... that's basically what using a mori boils down to... I know because I'm not the greatest killer and when someone is pissing me off, I'll tunnel them and mori them immediately and 98% of the time it turns tides in my favor.
---
Considering how nerfed the BNP's are it's justified to DC in a loading screen. Those items were supposed to be polar opposites of one another, 1 free gen = kill on down. If a killer had a one shot ability you could decimate an entire team with the hillbilly / myers and an ebony mori.
---
Now the rules are: Survivors get to do 25% of a gen instantly and the killer gets to kill everyone after a single hook... definitely not a fair trade anymore.
---
I almost have similar rules myself and this is coming from a day 1 player. The rank really doesn't mean shit at all... you have killers smurfing their rank so they can kill noobs easily and laugh about it and you have high rank survivors doing the same. 
---
Being a Rank 1 doesn't mean shit, it just means you were a selfish survivor, and if you got to rank 1 as a killer you managed to filter out all the 4 man SWF groups and boosted your way there on solo queue players. Rank is a joke.
---
The way I see it is, you shouldn't have to sacrifice your enjoyment of the game at the expense of some random troll. If the game isn't fun, then you have every right to get the fuck out and find another one with more fair terms, why frustrate yourself at someone else's expense? Fuck these kinds of people, you aren't entitled to ruining other peoples state of mind, if you're pissing me off then bye bye.
---
Bring me to my next point why this game is a train wreck, certain killers with specific add-ons are near impossible to beat unless you're all on coms and going full blow-hard mode... not worth it, DC, move on, maybe they'll get the hint next time.
---
America‚Äôs best sleepy boy
---
Can someone explain?
---
Wouldn't a battle pass basically put a time limit on when cosmetics will be available incentivize people to buy it that's predatory
---
restart your ps4 or something?
---
sounds like a network error ive experienced in other ps4 games too
---
That huntress is sexy.
---
Now we need hillbilly eating a hotdog and Doc drinking a glass of milk.
---
Personally, I'd just remove the hum and give her a 24m tr with humming and call it a day. If someone runs as soon as they hear that hum, you're wasting a ton of time trying to catch up.
---
Bubba got a black and blue cosmetic (believe that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called) but then again he was a killer only dlc
---
What do you mean by "real rewards" though? A bloodpoints boost? Shards? A new game mode?? Then everyone would complain that they turned an already 20$ game 30$ base (an example if the pass costs 10$) because you "need" to have it. Skins are probably the best compromise to this, since they don't do anything negative to someone else. Wanna play blendette for maximum immersion gameplay? Go ahead, it's free. But let the people that want to wear neon wear neon, what's it to you?
---
Gotta avoid them book ghosts.
---
it's funny how im called a basement camper yet I can hear the fucking breathing outside of the killer shack so baiting them into saving and getting another basement hook is totally camping lol
---
There might be something up with matchmaking right now. I‚Äôve had multiple instances where I left a lobby because of bad ping, waited 5 seconds to search for a new lobby, and ended up back in the original lobby. Did this 3 times in a row and finally gave up and just played the round.
---
I hate people who facecamp because you pressed control at pallets.
---
Why would they make a sequel instead of keep adding to the original?
---
What would you even expect of it? To use Cryengine?
---
Still under the assumption I don‚Äôt manage to get hit and escape the killer though, which happens commonly. I‚Äôd estimate i‚Äôm put into injured on average 4 times per match, some more some less though.
---
Haha thank you!!
---
Just buy it for one, or none! Their fan base is bigger than people who *don‚Äôt* wanna see the battle pass.
---
Oh my gosh I've played against that guy!!!
---
Thats your own fault for playing on two platforms. Settle with one.
---
They barely have resources for one version, cheers for having 4 :)...
---
This. And also with time and experience, you'll learn when to fake a chainsaw at a loop to get that extra, greedy attempt by a survivor to go around one more time allowing you to whack them with the hammer.
---
In addition, try to unlock Enduring if you haven't already. Enduring on Bubba is a must-have.
---
same thing with chasing survivors, like I want to win the game just like you stop calling me a tunneler for PLAYING THE GAME.
---
lmao
---
nah cream chalk pouch gang

1) get to 40

2) get bbq teachable

3)?????

How is people disagreeing with you proving your point?
---
I just say GG and leave im not going to argue with idiots in loat game chat.
---
That is beautiful ü§£
---
It was in the leaked builds files
---
It reminds them of Fortnite
---
Same can be said about all kinds of microtransactions. That still doesn't make them right.
---
As you can see, he was first to.. expire
---
I feel you, people literally don‚Äôt need to even look at it (if it‚Äôs on a separate page) if they don‚Äôt want to. Also can we like talk about how the mobile thing is actually a step in a bad direction? The game is already broken we don‚Äôt need a more broken game to take on the road!
---
I like how cocky he was and then how broken the hit box was in the final swing
---
6
---
The same could be said of ruin, in that it the killer doesn't have to do anything for it to activate but still benefits from it. Hell at least noed can be prevented whereas ruin can only be cleansed. And your logic behind the rework is faulty as that logic could be used against multiple perks on both sides. Noed (along with remember me and bloodwarden) help out when you're behind as the killer, it's meant to help you when you need it most, same could be said for MoM ds and unbreakable where they reward you for being in a bad position
---
No. It's just running the mobile UI and settings over the standard PC version. It still looks different, because the settings are visually downgraded, but it's not a good example on how good it'll run once it's on phones.
---
You get used to previously nauseating over long periods of time in VR. Over 1000 hours in VR kinda desensitizes you from teleporting (because most games use it as default movement) or quick straight line movements if you play VRChat.
---
I think BBQ wouldn‚Äòt be meta without the point boost.
---
Hey devs, you forgot the infinity glove!
---
Come to think about it, how awesome it would be if in a new appearance of Freddy, he would drag someone into DBD and at the character section he passes over Freddy just to state: "Nah, this guy sucks"  and proceeds to select the nurse.
---
For sure, can't imagine playing killer without headphones regardless. And yeah, I figure if I get decent with her now, I'll be even better when the sounds get fixed. Thanks!
---
No. I play on one to spend time with my deployed hubby, not giving that up, and I play on another with my daughter. I wont choose between the two. Sorry.
---
which region are you in?
---
Second person to recommend Stridor, very interesting, I'll try it out!
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I literally said the said same thing to my girlfriend to get her to understand why I don't like these robes. He looks like he belongs in Assassin's Creed.
---
Those make sense, thanks a lot!
---
He‚Äôs the meme god of the devs but with all due respect he has no idea what he‚Äôs taking about a lot of the time. He‚Äôs often made people frustrated with his lack of knowledge on the game, and of course with some of his other choice quotes like ‚ÄúJust go play civilization‚Äù
---
With Saw you'll want to watch in order otherwise Amanda's character won't make a whole lot of sense (Which is saying something cause its already pretty convoluted).
---
New Moon Bouquet Gang representüáπüá∑üò§üò§üíØüáπüá∑
---
It‚Äôs underrated tbh. I usually run it with injury builds like thanaphobia and sloppy. You can hear injured people at a surprising way away
---
Black and Blue is a survivor cosmetic.  
---
Bubba's only cosmetics are the normal outfit, prestige and the special faces you get from sacrificing survivors.
---
Once they fix ger hitboxes, I think making her 115% would be fair.
---
I cant think of any killer perk other than noed that can turn a game around as hard as unbreakable potentially can. You can have everyone immobilized (dead, hooked or downed)  and unbreakable can make it so that your 4k becomes a 2k.
---
Speaking of reworks Noed has been reworked countless times and is in a better spot than its ever been. Wayback it used to last forever with no way to cleanse or prevent it, then it lasted 2 minutes but still no way to prevent it.  Then it had its attack cooldowns removed when it was "buffed" to have 1 shot downs at all tiers. (unrelenting was also nerfed after Myers release)
---
The Halloween timeline is a pain in the ass because it has like 4 or 5 different ones, so just watch the first film and then do whatever you want
---
Skip 3 tho, it isn't even about Michael anyway
---
That's like... You know... Not BHVR's problem
---
Theres legit nothing wrong with a battle pass, you can only gain from it
---
My one hope is that it would incentivize BHVR to roll put dedicated servers for the game instead of relying on the killer to host.
---
There's no way in hell that happens though.
---
Dude you can buy event cosmetics with auric cells, are you implyong they wont make the same thing again?
---
"Get it for cheaper now or give us 10$ later"
---
Prayer beads and discordance. Ez.
---
Congrats man! Keep up the good work.
---
They need to fix Survivor hurtboxes first. We had good Huntress hitboxes but they were reverted cause you can‚Äòt hit limbs etc. (there is no hurtbox for survivor limbs and like half their shoulder, they simply are a long cylinder)
---
&gt; people who don't buy it are going to get less stuff.
---
... you already pay for that stuff though. You're acting like DbD is a "pay once" game. It isn't. It's always had micro-trasactions. If you look at other games that have rolled out a battle pass since fortnite, you'll find that it's cheaper for almost everybody.
---
Always go for the originals.
---
I became Pig main long before I watched any Saw movie. And now, after watching first 3 of them I can honestly say that they didn't make my in-game experience any different.
---
But I agree with those who suggested to watch them in order.
---
How many hours so you have in dbd?
---
As tough as it may sound, this is the truth.
---
I don't DC no matter what happens unless something IRL comes up. Facecamped to death? At least my team gets gens done. Hard tunnel? I must be special if the killer likes me that much lol. Farmed by teammates? I'll pretend they don't know any better. Spamming flashlight clicks and teabagging? Don't even care enough to even face camp you yet alone DC. 
---
The only time I ever DC in this game was the first time I played nurse because I was bad at killer at she seemed weak and too slow.
---
You're underestimating how much a battle pass will fix the game.
---
Gameplay looks stellar but the whole release is going to be empty for me without Sidney or the original robes.
---
Everyone has to make the decision of buying it themselves lol
---
This ain‚Äòt Fortnite, theoretically, everyone playing this should be like what 16? 18?
---
That‚Äòs not the game‚Äòs issue. That‚Äòs bad parenting.
---
You‚Äôre kidding right?  Behind the Mask is one of the best subversions of the slasher genre ever made.
---
The game will be free on Game Pass from next month
---
2$ skin for 9 hours of your life, seems great
---
Yes no yes. I didnt think about them actually having a apk or iOS file to run on a emulator at this point. I'm sure the resolution wont be the greatest for phones. Honestly if I could go from my console to my phone with the same account they would seriously be getting my attention. I tried playing identity v but the game can be as hard as dbd and even harder to control.
---
Fuck off, no one wants a battle pass in a 20$ game.
---
I guess any valid concerns just go right out the door when it comes to this game. After spending hundreds on multiple platforms, and watching the playerbase die out, I'll end up leaving as well. And considering the way everyone treats each other here, it proves I'm justified in leaving this game altogether, and with me goes three or more players across multiple platforms. And with them goes more, and so on. 
---
  See how that works?
---
Hmm, what rank are you? I lurk the 15-10 range and experience this like, 1/20 times. Maybe you just had a shit night search.
---
Works fine for me.
---
I personally learned from watching killer gameplay on Youtube. Everyone has their favorites but I generally watch Monto, No0b3, Ardetha, and Tru3ta1ent. Other good ones are Puppers, TydeTyme, HybridPanda, and Angrypug. Just off the top of my head.
---
What do you like about it?
---
Nice! Now add some color!
---
Yes the next step!!
---
Well I just started playing again after a long hiatus so currently working back up the ladder. Currently at 18. I just thought it was really strange to get that many AFK killers in a row.
---
Wait since when do people complain about bbq lol it‚Äôs anti camp and maybe even anti tunnel and pretty counterableüò≠
---
Curious that you draw the line at a battle pass, but not the paid cosmetics that they've already had in the game
---
Remember when the game was on PS+? The sub became fucking unbearable for more than a week because people would ask the sane questions every single day, often multiple times a day
---
When you referenced my comment you forgot to add the part in when I said loops that you can't throw over, which is many many loops in the game.
---
Why is Pig not S tier?
---
And then Zubat just throws the god pallet, canadians are hillarious :D
---
P.S.: congrats on wedding scott
---
Pig is too low
---
Fortnite's battlepass is renewable at Tier ~70 meaning players don't have to fully grind or dedicate their life to maximising their battle pass, which is smart as it makes the grind seem less and more fun. Fortnite also grants you 1500 VBucks which after buying the 950 battlepass, gives you a with a bonus of 550 VBucks. This actually encourages people to save up and rewards those who are patient. I managed to buy a skin that was 800 due to waiting 2 seasons. It's not much but it's something to be proud of.
---
This might go off topic but Apex Legend's battlepass is worse in all of these areas. To even make back your money, you need to be around tier 95 which seems much more higher than tier 70. You also only get 50 Apex Coins back, meaning there is little to no extra bonus for players who renew their battlepass.
---
&gt; he doesnt give a fuck anymore, words cant even describe how little he cares
---
I'd imagine DCing is quite the opposite.
---
1) they wouldn't be 'making you pay' and they wouldn't be 'forcing players'
---
2) I'd find it fun, don't presume to know that it wouldn't be fun for anyone
---
Mori me please trapper
---
Cause you dont have to work for the cosmetics, just buy them and that's it. Battle pass will mean you pay and don't even get anything if you don't play, and it would be simpler to just make the cosmetics available in the store instead of this crap.
---
Killer main, old player, rich player, polite player here
---
No battle pass pls.
---
Bottom middle clock tower!! That was an interesting addition to the series. A clock tower chapter would be great
---
Wouldn't be surprised, he's rank 11, and so far of all the games I've played rank 10-12 (I've been stuck in this range for a while), once one person gets hooked, that's it, none of the gens will be touched for the rest of the game. It's very possible to keep being the gen jockey and doing all 5 gens on your own in these ranks.
---
Lots of games do it now.  You accumulate points and reach levels on this battle pass, and at certain levels the game gives stuff to you . So like you get level  5 , comes with a skin, you obtain the skin . It's essentially rewards for playing the game. 
---
There in most cases is a free version , which has less stuff on it , particularly things like cosmetic, but in much less quantities and usually nothing too special .
---
Then there is a paid version, where it usually gives alot more rewards , like alot more cosmetics, some cosmetics may only be exclusive to that battle pass that you cant get anywhere . 
---
Usually battlepasses have a time period they last until a new one comes out and starts the leveling all over. 
---
I don't think Its a bad thing at all . People who play lt and love cosmetics will have even more of a reason to play DBD. And people who don't spend money but still play can still earn some free stuff. We should st least give it a chance before people ban wagon against it   
---
Now how this might ik impact the game in other ways , who is it say .
---
Identity V is on PC if you want to try it there. Download it off the website. It's still a mobile DbD clone but it has some neat new ideas and I love the doll aesthetic.
---
As for mobile DbD I'm not a fan, but I'm withholding judgement for now. People are complaining about Battlepasses, but mobile can be really limiting in future content if they want parity between platforms.
---
There are 5 people already in S tier. Would be too crowded.
---
Fair enough you are free to feel that way
---
Did I say "store" or "battle pass".
---
I said battle pass. The store has a place in game because they only release new game play related content every 1.5/3 months.
---
A battle pass, lets say for instance, my example that was ***clearly*** written above which you obviously didn't read can be used to take exclusive cosmetics that we could earn in an event for free, and put that behind a pay wall that we would have to also play through the game to get cosmetics in.
---
Some people don't have the time to play video games as much, so with an event in the way we have now (hallowed blight for example), they can play to get what cosmetics they want. However, if it was a battle pass the most appealing cosmetics will be nearer the end so those people would be more likely to sink **alot** of money to get that. It feeds off of addiction and is ***EXTREMELY PREDATORY***.
---
Please think before you start typing the first thing that comes to your mind, and think about what's best for the community and for the game's health.
---
They need money to fix game and pay employees don't they ? Hmm.. dilemma...
---
Gen rushing is literally what it is. If they try to get gens done as fast as possible, they are rushing the gens. What's next? "Anybody who uses the term camping sounds like an idiot, because the killer is just staying close to the hook and doesn't have a tent."
---
See, if you don't S tier Piggy she will mess with your brain. OINK
---
Be a little farther away than you feel like you need to be
---
You typically buy a $10 ‚ÄúDLC‚Äù and as you level up you unlock cosmetics, weapons, characters, currency, and more. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what DBD will have in their battle pass, probably not characters or auric cells. If you do not buy the pass you‚Äôll be able to claim a free reward every, say, 5 levels or 10 levels. However, with the $10 ‚ÄúDLC‚Äù you buy, you get the free rewards AND a reward at every level in addition to that. 
---
Basically you just spend a little bit of real money if you play the game a lot (enough to think ‚Äúhey that‚Äôs worth it for me to spend $10 here and unlock tons of cosmetics because I‚Äôll play enough to get to a high level) and end up with some extra bloodpoints and some cool cosmetic items. 
---
Sorry for the long winded explanation but I tried to make it comprehensible for someone who legitimately does not know what a battle pass is. Hope it helped! Cheers!
---
For Amanda, you only need to watch Saw 1-3. They're the best ones, anyway.
---
Michael, the best are Halloween (1978) and Halloween (2018).
---
She's excluded for no reason as well.
---
Game not free there is dlc and shop if they add battle pass only think they need is loot boxes and they gonna become Activision LuL
---
I'm going to be that person and say I wouldn't mind Mathieu breaking into my room üëÄ
---
no im making a point, everyone only mentions how its about the BP's  Everyone is super against the whole bloodpass thing and the only argument they can make is "more money for bonus bloodpoints? No thats a scam wah wah wah" i am yet to see 1 real reason not to add the bloodpass.
---
Huntress THICC
---
I'ma be playing anyway so good deal for me
---
for some reason it didnt include my screenshot, i was a rank 17 myers vs a rank 17 2 rank 12s and a rank 7
---
Yeah i'm sure you leaving is going to cause such a ripple effect thousands of players will quit and the game will die. And where is the stats that the game is "Dying" when in reality it isn't. It has been steadily growing in fact. Get your head out of your ass and stop acting like the game revolves around you. You are not meant to own the game on every single platform. You are allowed to and if thats what you want, go for it. But don't complain when you have to grind like crazy and buy the skins you want on all the platforms you play on because that is all on you and no one else.
---
I don‚Äôt mean they have to do full totems and chests, but they could benefit from it. 
---
Like lowering the percentage of the points needed to reach the iridescent Lightbringer (cointaining all I mentioned) so survivors could decide if they want to do Gens only or could up pip if they are going for other stuff like dull totems and chests.
---
They fixed her hitboxes in 2.3.2 but quickly reverted because she was complete utter shit
---
So it would be more useful to stack Up The Ante across multiple survivors than it is to run Salty Lips?
---
Up The Ante = 36% + 4% Base Luck = 40% Luck
---
Salty Lips = 12 % + 4% Base Luck = 16% Luck
---
I feel cheated with my luck offerings now...
---
Also a fellow PC Survivor main. Probably gonna mess around and maybe give being a killer a shot.
---
EZ fix: Every bloodweb after 50 only gives t3 perks.
---
ü§£ AWESOME
---
Man I wish 10min lobby for killer was my life. I main surv these days, but when I want to pop over to do a daily or run my Huntress for a while, it's like an hour. Legit made &amp; ate dinner, and still had time to do the dishes before I got a 4 man lobby :/
---
Ya I do think she defintley needs at least an add on to where you can't search the boxes till it activates its always annoyed me that survivors can get it off before, And maybe one where the first box cant have your key in it.
---
The matchmaking in this game is broke. Always has been. No idea why.
---
A lot of the time I load up the game I just watch his animations since he‚Äôs always at my campfire. I wish they would let the poor boy sleep.
---
I mean, cosmetics.
---
If there is bunny feng I'm happy.
---
i feel like if it ruined the game for survivors it would have been fixed by now
---
It‚Äôs already been proven that yes people are still doing it, most people reporting it however aren‚Äôt doing it intentionally though from the looks of it. I just think it‚Äôs funny that they claimed to fix it, banned the original guy that found and reported it even though he and his friend went out of their way to replicate it so the devs could have an easier time fixing it, and then threaten more bans and yet now it happens even more often.
---
I think it'd probably be fine as long as she still took a major hit to speed while holding.  115% would probably also mean a bigger cool down on post throw m1 swinging.
---
I am not against a battlepass. I dont want to grind hundreds of hours just to try a different killer build. I dont like the progression system that's all, why not adress this and then print more pink hair and yellow vests? Cause it's easier to recolor pants and slap a pricetag.
---
Once again, thats your own fault. You can't play on seperate platforms when cross saving doesn't exist and then complain that you have to buy skins and grind on both platforms.
---
Good thing ps4 doesnt have that feature.
---
The Mummy would be AWESOME.
---
Nope. They have changed matchmaking a few times now, currently it SHOULD prioritizes location for good ping, THEN it groups within like 5 of your rank.  It actually just gets you ping of 200 and under and doesn't give a shit about what ranks are in your lobby. I had 2 rank 20s and 2 rank 10s in my lobby last week. I am a rank 1 huntress. I felt bad very bad when I found out.
---
It was on psplus for one month only, it‚Äôs not free anymore on ps4.
---
Power doesnt need buffs
---
No, that's a small minority of the map. Pallets don't do anything against Huntress and that's something survivors rely on for almost all of the killers [minus Nurse and, to an extent, Legion/Billy/Cannibal], nor do windows [Hatches] or T/L shaped walls because those heavily rely on fast vaulting through windows which, again, is beaten by Hatchets.
---
Imagine monetizing your game with a F2P model when the full game already costs over 100 euros...
---
It'd have to be give and take.  If you put in a minimum spawn distance, then it really should have a limited max as well.  We don't all play hillbilly, after all.
---
Welcome to the Crotus Penn Nursing Institute!
---
Yeah i gonna quit if the do it !
---
Fuck off, clearly there are people who do.
---
Doesn't matter, I just wanna move on to the next game.
---
I don't want to stay on the ground doing nothing waiting for a spider to penetrate me. 
---
It's boring and frankly I have more fun going against a face camping leatherface.

---
This game should be FTP with a focus on paid cosmetics, maybe a battle pass
---
It would massively boost the player base which is desperately needed, at least on console 
---
This game would be perfect for that model by its nature
---
sure, doesn't matter if you need to wait guaranteed 3 or less minutes or literally be stuck in a game for over 10 not knowing when cunt decides to do at least something. you know how many times I've been through this and seen this as a spectator? way too many.
---
It would only be milking customers if they were forced to buy cosmetics to win or to continue playing, they are 100% optional.
---
And everyone was calling this fake. üôÑ
---
If the hatch is closed, the gates are closed and EGC has begun, if the last survivor is knocked they should just be instantly killed. I play survivor more nowadays and the wait bores the shit out of me. If there's no way they can possibly escape, just let them die
---
The  best perks for clown: barbecue &amp; chili, hex: ruin, brutal strength &amp; save the best for last. You can also go: bbq, ruin, enduring &amp; spirit fury.
---
COD4? You mean Black Ops 4? The game that put game changing items in their battlepasses?
---
Apex became a drag when the pass was released, I haven't played the other games so I can't tell.
---
On top of that I really hate when there's exclusive stuff in battlepasses, I find it stressful enough completing them without feeling like I need to do it or I permanently miss out on something
---
I know a good place for him to lie down, in a coffin !
---
Huge fan of sloppy butcher/coularaphobia/nurses calling (pick your 4th, usually Ruin or BBQ) on clown. It‚Äôs insanely strong on the clown and heals take so long you get easy tracking with nurses.  Self care takes like 40+ seconds it‚Äôs absurd and it‚Äôs even longer when in your terror radius.  I‚Äôve had a ton of success with that build and no one seems to run it.
---
i would replace plague with LF if im not running a 4 man swf
---
would put LF and Billy at the bottom and take trapper and clown and put them up
---
the top 2 tiers are pretty accurate, there all killers that i go "Ugh" when i see them at the start, i would say in order though it would go 
---
Nurse, Plague (without a 4 man swf) doc, hag, clown, spirit, then freddy (sometimes pigs bc i run into a lot of high rank pigs that are just flat out dicks.)
---
People don't want to pay for a battlepass even though they may want what it provides. If it doesn't exist they won't have to decide if they shell out the money.
---
I didnt complain about buying the cosmetics, the complaint is about the lack of ability to link the accounts so I'm not wasting my time. I gather your time isn't precious, but mine is. I've got a job, 2 teenagers, a deployed husband, a house, couple cats, and a game that was supposed to be fun wants to turn into a job if I play on multiple platforms. Btw, I'm going crazy, but it most definitely is not because of this game. 
---
P.p.s. I can complain about anything I want to.
---
repost?
---
I dont agree with most of these. As a huntress main with 2k hours put into almost only her, I feel that she COULD use a buff, and that while unreasonable to ask for, many loops should have the ability to be thrown over, I feel these would be too much. Her hatchet windup time is fine, and I feel doesn't need adjusting at all. I could see the change for the lullaby, but I wouldn't expect it. The only thing that I want buffed is either her movement speed, or to just rework the one house with the basement with two sets of stairs on springwood and haddonfield. That loop makes me want to DC when I spend almost a minute looping up and down with their balanced landing just to have a piece of wood dropped on me and to do it again. I. Hate. That. Building. In regards to the buffs, while I'd love some, I feel huntress is one of the most balanced killers in the game right now. The only way she would need a buff is if they fixed hitboxes.
---
For me it's the swamp
---
this what happens now is literally tiny bit of bm killers get for all the times survivors would do that to killers. you got no basement bodyblock for that so shush.
---
Just make Rules Set No. 2 part of her kit. I feel like it'd be enough of a buff. Also uncrouching shouldn't make noise so you can actually grab survivors off gens without them running off instantly.
---
Also make it so that inactive traps don't let you out of the Exit Gate. They may have no timer but at least they're not completely worthless
---
What
---
Half of all suvivors will dc !
---
Haha
---
Diffrent cosmetics. With santa clown your winrate will increase by 100%.
---
Doctor once again getting no love :(
---
You are soooo pathetic 
---
"Some filthy survivor huwt  my feelings so now I'm gonna be a bitch"
---
No, a lot of people don't.
---
Mostly it's because a lot of skins cost $5-$10. As nice as some of them are, it's downright insulting to suggest that they're worth more than the cost of a chapter.
---
It‚Äôs better than nothing!.... kinda..
---
I played Overwatch for nearly two years and got about the same amount of nasty messages in all that time that I get in a week of playing dbd. That's my experience as an Xbox player though.
---
I'm sure theres quite a few people who don't know Dbd yer
---
r/dbdgonewild says otherwise.
---
I distinctly remember everyone complaining during those events because of the extra objectives and how scummy killers ruined it by camping them, now imagine that but all the time.
---
This of course is a worst case scenario in regards to the challenges, it could just be "finish a generator" or something but people would probably complain saying the challenges are too easy or something...
---
Cares about karma lmao
---
What about getting more bloodpoints per match as you rank up
---
I agree with you.
---
Clever Myers.
---
My list would be rather similar except ace in the hole &amp; plunderers would probably be in A or B.
---
get 850 k BP, spend all cakes\\BPS\\ iridescnent addons, prestige
---
Damn, and it was already nerfed, too.
---
Might as well only play with BBQ. All 3 of these perks are trash except for Whispers, Whispers level 1 is useless and often misleading. However whispers level 3 is an S tier perk and I use it on all my killers.
---
Noed just makes you a shittier killer and rewards you for being shit, which just leads to being even more shit. (Downward spiral for you)
---
And Hangman‚Äôs trick is a bottom tier perk. Well I can see why you like it because as a camper sometimes silly survivors sacrifice themselves for the save and die so you just slug them near the hooked survivor and wait until he dies so then you can hook the slugged survivor on the same hook. And in that case, stop camping.
---
Get ruin, Enduring and level 3 Whispers. 
---
I know this is going to get downvoted a fuck ton because people on this subreddit like to downvote without giving a proper argument and most of the users on this sub are new killers that watch Tru3talent and that‚Äôs fine! Because I know that one day they will be good at the game and realize I am right. I like teaching people so it‚Äôs worth the downvotes.
---
When you see potential problems the best thing to do is to ignore it
---
You could be right, although there is never too much freak out about a game company greed.
---
I meant to download.
---
I mean I dont remember getting camped once in any recent event, and the events reward killers for lots of hooks, not anything for kills. Therefore they are really shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Well, let's wait and see...
---
One thing for sure - people will complain.
---
I play to win. I‚Äôm not a dick about it though lol but it‚Äôs a competitive game. So imma kill all 4 of you little shits and take my 2 pip.
---
The problem with NOED isn't that it's OP, but that it is simply unfun to go up against. Similar to Decisive Strike pre-change.
---
I think a simple change would be to make NOED light up for survivors the moment gens are powered, not once the first survivor is downed. That would at the very least remove the 'lol u ded' slap and instead evoke some good ol' fashioned panic.
---
I hope they picked expirenced players... and please give us feedback about the vanilla matches.ü§ó
---
I meant camping the extra objectives, sorry. I didn't really play during the year of the pig event but I remember having a lot of issues with the hallowed blight event and this sort of thing.
---
I'm pretty sure they meant don't farm each other on the hook.
---
The three things guaranteed in life: death, taxes and people complaining lol
---
What is everyones problem with a fun way to earn cosmetics which adds a goal to the gameüòÇ
---
Oof. I honestly let survivors finish massaging their pudding plants if I found any doing one then kill them when they were done. Everyone gets something out of it.
---
Imagine not liking battlepasses because people is gonna have cosmetics you dont
---
I don‚Äôt believe they will add items that will affect gameplay. Purely cosmetic. Again as I said. Don‚Äôt want it then don‚Äôt buy it.
---
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch you did it.
---
Sadly not everyone is as generous as you, lol
---
He stabbed our phones through the floor because the time ran out. But only the phones
---
That's only a perception bias. It feels like it slows down the game because it takes *you* out of the game longer.
---
Keep in mind, self-care takes twice as long to complete... but to be healed by someone else, **two** survivors are out of actions, resulting in the same time lost. Add to that the need to run into a survivor first...
---
That said, that's *all* the perk does, so if you're in a SWF or run Bond (or anything that lets you easily find survivors), and can consequently easily and (semi-)coordinated find other survivors to heal you, you can certainly skip the perk. But even then there are moments where you and your teammates will be so far apart that meeting up would waste too much time...
---
Overall, it's a must have if you want to be less dependant on teammates in solo queue, and still a valid choice when in a SWF... not surprising it's run everywhere consistently, if just so survivors don't have to switch mindsets.
---
It isnt. Apex is like DBD you can ignore it and still get free rewards. You dont lose anything from it, you only gain.
---
The only time I disconnect is if the killer is slugging trying to get everyone down. That‚Äôs just actually boring and I would rather just take the hit and find a new game. Other than that, he can face camp me and I‚Äôll make him wait all that time so my team can escape. Nothing really makes me dc as killer. Although it does hurt having ruin gone within 10 seconds of a game starting and versing good survivors.
---
I believe this issue with battlepasses is that instead of playing a multitude of games you enjoy at your own pace, you end up forcing yourself to play a game you might want a break from solely on the fear of missing out. So many games have battlepasses these days that its becoming more difficult to just enjoy the game rather than have to force yourself to marathon something to get the items. Sure you dont have to do that, the items arent needed to play the game but most people still would like to particpate in these types of things without dedicating their lives to it.
---
Damn, can't believe they're making wuch a massive tribute to TF2 dev team
---
Man I want old lady strode cosmetics
---
Well true, but if you truly want a break, you wouldnt care if you missed out.
---
I mean we don‚Äôt have specifics on the Battle Pass yet and the cosmetics included could be those that are already in the store. I doubt that they‚Äôd make brand new cosmetics for each Battle Pass and then once the time is up scrap them forever because they‚Äôd lose money from the players who wanted to buy them directly from the store instead. Not to mention it would be lot of work to make the amount of cosmetics needed each time. 
---
Same as Event cosmetics which are normally put in the store once the Event had ended. 
---
To the point of people not playing the game for fun due to the Battle Pass, where have you been lately? 
---
A large majority of players now either play this game to troll or be toxic. Yes there‚Äôs still people who play the game to win and for fun but once you‚Äôve played so much and have nearly all the perks combos and add-on combos, you then need something to aim towards other than winning. Having a Battle Pass, even the free one, at least gives a target to try and hit. I‚Äôd like different, more diverse and more frequent daily rituals for this reason too.
---
What is a battle pass tho
---
Payday 2 did pretty fine for content without worrying about battle passes or skins. when they did introduce skins everyone had a collective shit fit and they fixed it, the same thing might happen here.
---
Didn't notice Blood Warden barrier until she actually tried to leave.
---
&gt;Battle pass in DBD is different from Bo4 and Apex.
---
That's why I was confused, you said they were different and then said how they were the same.
---
&gt;You dont lose anything from it, you only gain.
---
If you finish the entire thing, otherwise you lose out on anything you didn't grind for forever (assuming it's the same as Apex or Fortnite's passes). My hope is that they either put already existing cosmetics in as an alternative way of getting them OR everything from the pass gets put on the store after for direct purchase forever.
---
  I definitly agree with this my first tought was that this was a Joke and one Guy photoshoped it or something but Now i am worried About this game
---
Yeah my bad, poor wording, however your completely right on that I hope they release old items or new ones to be released later.
---
they're a lovely person, a great teammate indeed, hope they'll see this
---
I dont know if this is the right place to report this? Not even trying to be mean OP.
---
&gt;and the cosmetics included could be those that are already in the store.
---
If that's the case then I'd be content with the pass honestly.
---
&gt;To the point of people not playing the game for fun due to the Battle Pass, (cont.)
---
Those are all fair points and I can see why people who have already got everything would like it.
---
Need to watch the attitude. Didn't see him being a dickhead.
---
As others have said I think it's more to do with the map design rather than huntress herself. Making her 115% would be way to overpowered, there would be no point in playing any of the other 115% killers.
---
Love at first mori ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Clown. Getting survivors with the bottles and watching their run speed drop to almost half, the way he laughs when he hits someone, getting to use Pop Goes the Weasel on a gen, right to his fucked-up Mori. 
---
Plague is also fun when someone drops a pallet in front of me when I have a corrupt purge to deal damage to them.
---
I kinda now feel bad for killing him now
---
I'm pretty sure the battle pass will be for the mobile version which will be free
---
Yea ik, but I know for a fact that there are BHVR mods on this subreddit, so hoping at least 1 reads this.
---
I'm glad we came to an understanding and sorry if I was a bit snappy, this whole battlepass thing already has me stressed out and it isn't even fully confirmed yet &gt;_&lt;
---
Real answer if youre a killer play to kill. If youre survivor try to survive. Play the way that helps you win.
---
Yeah nurse is kinda similar to huntress in some ways, even if it isn't obvious.
---
Hopefully.
---
I tried playing this game a few times and...you're basically just meant to run ? You can't hide, can't loop, can't do anything to escape the killer AFAIK
---
I mean you can just like... not upload it if you don't like it
---
It'd be bad less from the "this is op" perspective and more from the "this is really annoying" perspective.
---
I have Amanda to P3 Level 50 (as she is best girl), and I‚Äôd recommend a build which I‚Äôve found more than reliable: 
---
Nurse‚Äôs Calling
---
Ruin
---
Enduring
---
(Optional Perk)
---
Ruin doesn‚Äôt need an explanation to why you need it. I used to run enduring due to having multiple DS‚Äôs in one game but now it‚Äôs only for pallets so it‚Äôs optional at this point. Nurse‚Äôs to find someone in case you‚Äôre near injured survivors or crouching for that sneaky oink. The optional perk can be BBQ for location/bloodpoints, Spirit‚Äôs Fury for synergy with Enduring (although I wouldn‚Äôt recommend because once survivors see you have it they‚Äôll just drop pallet early), Franklin‚Äôs if you see many toolboxes, flashlights, etc. or just any other perk you‚Äôd find useful in specific situations. 
---
Hope this helps and sorry for the text format as I‚Äôm on mobile.
---
Alright, listen here you wee lass. I'm a damn killer man and I think Nurse was a fuckin mistake, a disgrace to game design in something like this game, and whoever thought "Oh let's give a killer a fucking TELEPORT" needs to be put in a chair, and get a 72 hour lecture bout common sense, because they lack it so bad a politician with unlimited power can make better choices than them.
---
 Billy is a son of a bitch but not AS bad as the other shit you listed.
---
 Whoever thought R A N G E D INSTADOWNS was smart most likely got beat so bad, their eyes popped out Negan-style.
---
 Only good thing about silent phrase spirit is that she ain't Nurse.
---
 Myers map can also go fucking burn in hell, those fences and the balconies are a shitshow and a half.
---
Np but I wish the pig would get a buff to her crouch lunge as it should be one hit but your decks amazing I don‚Äôt play a lot with pallets I mostly mind game so I don‚Äôt really use enduring I use no-Ed which I have mixed opinions about so no-Ed or NO no-Ed
---
I did read the entire thing, but that's pretty much all there is to it
---
You dont like timegated cosmetics, wich basically are "cosmetics others have that I dont because they played the game"
---
Like, I get it, but only one person in each server could get the Black qiraji battle tank back in Vanila WoW
---
The other problem is that you also appear to believe that the challenges are going to be weird as fuck bullshit that will make your games horrible like Fortnite "kill 10 people with the crappiest pistol in the game" when they will probably just be the daily quest we already have
---
I‚Äôd much prefer Leatherface‚Äôs fancy outfit, the outfit at the end of original movie
---
I just hope people wouldn't/won't be too sweaty in it.
---
There are so many potentially fun combinations of killers working together, and I already know the most common thing will just be two Nurses.
---
Spirit with beads
---
the point he's making is that redditors pretend to get hung up on "muh morals" when in reality they don't have a job and want cosmetics despite being broke
---
Whats the Problem? If more than 2 is down, you will get 1 up eventually. And if 1 stays down. Just escape. Its the same as if he was on a hook
---
I think most dislike it because of the BL looping. Some killer can counter it but others have a very hard time if the survivor has any idea what they're doing. Depending on the fences, they could be looped for a while as well. 
---
I don't mind the map myself but it can be easy to get looped, in which case I just switch targets. I've never seen a 4-man swf BL team there but I imagine it's hell if you're not hag, trapper, or nurse.
---
Nice to see another clown player in the fog. I'd run bbq, brutal strengh, ruin and bloodwarden
---
&gt; Is it wrong for a company to pad their pockets?
---
When the base product isn't even working correctly ?
---
Hell yes.
---
Where i live, we call this shady buisness practice.
---
But hey i now that's some liberal extremists/cattle will tell me that "That's how it works, fuck or git fucked :o)) "
---
When it comes to timed cosmetics I like it just like the nurse gas mask or legacy it sets people apart and for me it makes me wanna look into what is going to be out and what I wanna get I always do this in destiny 2 I have armor you can't get any more and that's fine
---
Did you even read the title? I specified in a 1v1 situation.
---
Not when there are still more one survivor alive.
---
Well, if you like ignoring things, how about you ignore unhappy battle pass reactions and move on?
---
This "argument" itself is stupid beyond any comprehension. In a place created for people to speak up freely, you want others to shut up.
---
Wait, how do you loop those fences? fhe windows are always right next to an open hole in them, I just can't remember being looped there.
---
Yea I haven‚Äôt found enduring all that useful since I mind game pallets as well and I don‚Äôt really need it since the DS rework. NOED is a perk that is disliked by a lot of people but it‚Äôs not all that much of a hassle imo. I personally don‚Äôt use it, but it does punish survivors who gen rush without cleansing. 
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people complaining about it yet they don‚Äôt cleanse even though they‚Äôre fully aware of it being common in most killer load-outs. I‚Äôd say use Noed if you don‚Äôt have Ruin because gens will just pop quickly and you‚Äôll need the advantage it provides. Once you get Ruin then you can either abandon noed or keep using it. I won‚Äôt deny that leaving noed does improve your gameplay but don‚Äôt get rid of it simply because everyone tells you to, get rid of it once you get ruin and don‚Äôt feel like you need it anymore.
---
we're in an era of games where people care too much about pure balance even if it makes the game less fun
---
Again. I don't care if people have something I don't. The legacy stuff is fine and a lot of killers I don't own but other people do and that's fine.
---
My problem is specific to battlepasses and how it actually puts a lot of stress on me because it makes me feel like I *have* to be playing the game or I'll miss out on something (especially if there's something I really want at the end of the pass, for example). Chances are I play the game enough to finish a pass anyway, but it will still stress me out. That's just how my brain is.
---
To be fair I'm not a fan of a lot of the current daily quests. I hate it when they specifically ask me to play a survivor I don't play, thankfully you get a free skip every day too but that probably won't be in a battlepass (also if there are challenges in the pass, they're all going to focus around the free characters because otherwise they'd be locking people out of them). All of this is assuming that there's going to be challenges to streamline the process, it could be like CoD and Apex in that it's just a long ass grind.
---
Battle passes only make sense in free to play games. You can see how well the COD one did. Plus it would be just annoying to grind for exklusives in the pass as if it wasnt hard enough already. Wouldnt like the direction this would be going since we got a item shop already, plus have dlcs that you can also buy.
---
Several Survivors have teabagged and jumped in and out of lockers in this situation against me and they always just take a second too long to gloat...
---
Then I close the hatch. Just don't get too cocky ;)
---
Yeah but can't really compete with self care, borrowed time, mettle of man, adrenaline, dead hard, balanced landing etc. There's only 4 slots bro :D
---
This perk can be really powerful or get you instantly killed, and thats the kind of energy I need in my life.
---
That‚Äôs literally what I said. It made no sense when I read it. But the Announcement on PS4 with the patch was worded that way.
---
A revenue source like paid DLC and paid skins?
---
The concept of the battlepass is actually alright in my eyes - I get free cosmetics for playing the game that I wouldn't normally have got. The only issue with it is the premium battle pass that you also have to pay for for extra shit that you THEN also have to pay for is the bad part people don't like, especially in a game that isn't F2P
---
Paid Actors FeelsWeirdMan
---
I advice that you take a moment before swinging. Rather than charging right at the survivor like a bull and a matador, get to them, pause, let them try to dodge, then hit them when you have an idea of how they're moving. This is the best thing to do whenever your attacks are being dodged, even against normal 360s
---
My man, I seriously thank you for taking the time to put this all together for me. I will definitely use your comment for reference thanks again.

NOED allows you to win even if you fucked up most of the game, and barely got any hooks.  
---
I personally don't really mind going up against NOED, but I never use it because I feel it gives me too big a reward for playing like shit.

Halloween 2's pretty much on par with the first one, but it doesn't maintain the same continuity as 2018.

Thankyu :)

And always with the more or less exact same message behind the headline for it.

Yes they are, however I will go with my headcanon that the Nurse just trys to breather, but can't and that the Spirit is just possesed by the ghost of Waluigi and he is the one moaning and groaning because he hates everything besides himself and she herself is completely silent.
---
Because it's already game that you need to buy, then you can buy DLC with killers and survivor and now they want to add another paid feature, they should try to repair this game 1st then try to add new features

i really like how the game came out after all that time but yeah, the griding is something that (at least to me) seems pretty easy to fix or at least change and a battle pass wouldn't make it better by any means
---
Billy would've been so good if he was added today, just because devs are set to not make viable killers anymore. 
---
They probably did that because Spirit can counter looping better than Billy.
---
Spirit doesn't need 115% movement speed btw, instead, she needs to be able to use her power when her cooldown is at 50%, not just when it's at 100%. So she wouldn't wait anymore 15 seconds before being able to use her power again, she could use it after 7-8 seconds of cooldown ( but of course with her power being shorter if she use it early ), so she would have a better map pressure and her power would've be so punishing. Also, it would help if they would increases a little the speed when she phasing and if they would add Katana Tsuba in her base kit ( and also nerfing Wakizashi Saya ), but she would be perfect just with her cooldown being more permissive.
---
I should but, well, I'm stressed and worried that this will inevitably lead to me not enjoying DBD anymore just like it did with so many other games.
---
I'm going to turn off my phone for awhile and get a cup of tea and Legion some survivors, maybe I'll feel better about things then. Thanks for the concern, I just get really upset with this sort of thing
---
Just with how long they are sometimes. If the killer is directly on the other side, they'll have to go a long way to get to you which lets you run around it a bunch before switching into another loop.  It doesn't work if the fences have a lot of gaps though.
---
Kind of like when you just run a circle around a tree or something. You just waste the killers time trying to catch up before moving elsewhere.

---
If u know how to use the nurse, its op af.
---
Freddy is weak af, the time to get someone asleep is so slow that u can take someone off the hook
---
I‚Äôm sure too, but how many would be willing to pay 20 ¬£/$ for it now? If you‚Äôre someone who is going to part with cash to play a game like dbd you‚Äôve probably already bought it in the three years it‚Äôs been out
---
It wasn't the camping that made them a bad killer, it was the lag switching. If you need to literally cheat to get the kill, you're too high ranked
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind a battle pass, it will be one that I would actually finish for once
---
It's crouch on PC, so teabagging would be CTRLCTRLCTRLCTRLCTRL
---
That was filthy. Well played dude.
---
A little bit more context.
---
He actually let me off his shoulder twice before that moment. Once in front of the hatch just to close it and again to "play" with me and kill me to the collapse. When I realized I ran straight to the door.
---
Survivors who DC when being mori'd are tantrum throwing, petulant children. Are you such a poor losers that you can't wait 3 seconds after having being caught twice??
---
Ah thank you
---
lol! behind
---
People, band together! Unite under the banner of "Devs, Don't Be Fucking Morons!"!
---
Wtf?!?! Is this happening???
---
If there‚Äôs a battle pass AT LEAST make it FREE  but seriously we don‚Äôt want a battle pass we want DEDICATED SERVERS BUG UPDATES more shit for the player base Idk about the battle pass but it should be free and you can buy tiers not P2w ffs but if they make one at least give the og players custom skins üòä
---
It's not a bad idea, people who pay for the battle pass don't get a advantage do they? And you get free stuff if they add a free pass which is in the leak
---
I'm confused? the pass is free?
---
One guy told me literally this after I argued with him that there are no "better" opinion on how good/bad Freddy is because he told me that Freddy is "bad by any definition":
---
&gt;I think the biggest problem with people on this sub is that they cannot discern between opinions that matter and ones that don't.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No offense but what is your qualification for judging balance? Just because we are both human beings that bought DBD doesn't make us or our opinions equal.  
---
&gt;Every veteran killer main out there holds the same opinion as me, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who has enough experience and still tries to argue for Freddy.  
---
&gt;So yeah, if you have any arguments why Freddy is not bad, except your opinion, I'd like to hear them. If not, keep your *opinions* to yourself, we have enough people on this subreddit that like to spout uninformed opinions
---
I wasn't even trying to say that Freddy is like, good. I'm just kinda pissed off about people whose opinion is a single main thing in the Galaxy
---
Wait you can trigger blood warden for both gates if there is one gate open?
---
stop using noed
---
Lmao for me when it happens it doasn't, i take te time to check my email and social midia, because its not like i need to be watching at the screen the whole time... its only 3/4 mins after all, not a big deal.
---
no thanks, its the only way to relaibly create pressure after the 5th gen
---
Oh dam you're right. How dare behavior keep us from choosing our food and force us to 'earn' it randomly, we need food to live!
---
oh wait, it's not food it's cosmetics, I don't need cosmetics to live.
---
oh wait, I get some bonus random cosmetics even if I don't pay.
---
oh wait, I can still just pay for the ones I want anyway, I don't have to randomly earn them now that that's an option.
---
nice analogy.
---
Okay so they have this issue that people don't play the game for fun and toxicity became rampant (a issue they somewhat caused due to how survivor sided the game was initially) so instead of looking into why the game is not fun, looking into why progression feels empty (Bloodpoint grind is a pain and yet is required since so many killers need specific perks and addons to function, Rank still has no rewards yet they still act like Depipping is a punishment when people DC) they decided to make a battle pass to give people something to work towards and hey you can get prettier crap if you pay. If that is not the perfect representation of Make a problem sell the solution then i don't know what is.
---
people feel compelled to buy it because its there. its mental torture for some
---
The issue is Dead by Daylight isn‚Äôt a free to play game like others that have a battle pass. Around ¬£20 to buy the base game + ¬£7 for each DLC + however much the battle pass would be is a bit much. I‚Äôm sure it wouldn‚Äôt be forced down your throat, but having limited time exclusive character customisation options only available if you shell out even more money for the battle pass would add pressure to buy it - if you care about that kinda thing.
---
Also, making the game free to play wouldn‚Äôt really help. Unless they gave everyone who already spent money on buying the game a free battle pass, but even then...
---
Just my opinion though.
---
Because you pay for the game, pay for the DLC, and pay for skins. This game is already heavily monetised.
---
If it is as easy as Fortnite, then no problem! :)
---
Most games have a free pass (usually quite bad) and a premium pass.
---
There is nothing bad with it. You get rewards for playing ffs its good.
---
You know the answer to that xD
---
One of the worst things that battlepassholes like to do is put a "You gain 5% more battle pass points!" pseudo-reward onto the "premium" track.
---
To clarify why it is wrong and disgusting and needs a neckrope:
---
When each battlepass level increases the battlepass points required to progress to next battlepass level (LV1 -&gt; 100 exp -&gt; LV2 -&gt; 200 exp -&gt; LV3 etc.), and your idea of a PREMIUM fucking reward is to give people 5% more exp, it's not a reward. You gain absolutely nothing, it just looks like a reward, but it isn't. And all it ultimately says is "hey we've artificially prolonged the battlepass and pretend like we give you a reward, but all we actually do is undo the artificial lengthening".
---
I personally don‚Äôt think you have anything to worry about. And take it from me, battle passes really don‚Äôt mean anything unless you make it mean something. 
---
I‚Äôve played a lot of fortnite in my day and got 3 or 4 battle passes then decided I didn‚Äôt want to anymore, continued to play and didn‚Äôt miss anything about it. None of the cosmetics or anything of a battle pass nature. They mean nothing. 
---
I play Apex almost everyday. It‚Äôs my DBD getaway and I love it. But I have yet to get the battle pass! 
---
I don‚Äôt think a dbd battle pass would be a game changer. If they put cosmetics that are already available and that people bought would be stupid therefore don‚Äôt waste your time. And if they put different things then cool, it‚Äôs your choice. It‚Äôs not pay to win though.   They add bloodpoints? Cool, again.  A killer with bbq and chili will laugh because we all know it‚Äôs the best thing for points even on a bad game. I would love if they gave more shards for people who can‚Äôt spend money on this game.  I‚Äôm devotion 4 almost 5 and have nothing to show for it. 
---
I think people are tripping over something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. I agree that everyone should give their opinions because now the devs see if it would be right. But if someone wants a battle pass on dbd and voices it, they should have the freedom to do so without being bashed. 
---
And tbh, if a battle pass helps them rake up some more money to improve their game TAKE MY FUCKIN MONEY lol.
---
Dies, DC
---
Yeah, fair assessment, with stuff like the play civ comment.
---
Killers also have favorite maps, if it's billy on rotten field or in that garbage forest map, which have one giant tree in a middle and nowhere to lose a killer, or even loop him for a bit, I don't blame people for dcing, it's pretty much a GG anyway.
---
Reawakens in heaven, DC
---
An elaborate scam that everybody is falling for.
---
Didn‚Äôt a few of the challengers leak? Ofc they could be like place holders or something but I‚Äôm pretty sure they are stuff like put ‚Äúhook 3 survivors‚Äù and ‚Äúhit survivors 9 times‚Äù I expect them all to be this simple should be fairly easy flying through the BP.
---
I'm just praying that they either don't add anything I want or if they do have it really early on in the pass, otherwise I'm just going to bite the bullet and spend money to save my sanity.
---
Yeah.. I said it was somewhat of a team based game because you don't need your team to survive for you to win
---
Thats why Nurse is in the highest tier and Freddy is in the lowest. Do you even know how tier lists work?
---
It seems to me that you enjoy this game and enjoy playing a lot of it (same goes for me, same goes for a lot of people) and you‚Äôll be able to grind and have fun with it and earn things.  It‚Äôs not going to change how you play necessarily and how much fun you have.
---
Y'all need to stop saying "Survivors" and instead say "Bad survivors". Not all survivors are like this.
---
I feel like it would suck for the blood lust and chase points.  But I think a couple killers are fast enough to make it up the stairs before the survivors even get off the elevator.  Could make for some crazy jukes though.
---
I did submit on the last day so I doubt I'll get chosen
---
I show leg, set mood. YOU LIKE ?! &gt;:(
---
Great saying! I'm going to use that!
---
You pay like 10$. Then over the course of a couple months you get bonus rewards like cosmetics and currencies for playing and completing challenges [generally speaking].
---
I wish my brain could see it that way. I guess either way I'll still be playing Susie, Pig and my country-turned-goth Kate no matter how much stuff I want is in the pass and hopefully the stuff will just get added to the store after the fact and then I'll have no issues at all (given that the limited time event stuff did, I do have hope).
---
Why are you being downvoted??? The battle pass is a terrible scam. Only reason it‚Äôs accepted by the Fortnite community is because the game is free.
---
I wouldn't mind a tier system to unlock cosmetics and bloodpoint rewards in a style similar to black ops 4
---
Would give something to work towards as well as provide a lot more rewards for playing
---
I lucid dreamt it, was fun
---
exactly my point. and you know for a fact you'll die and that's it, can move on.
---
Are you serious? Make a ranged damage killer normal movement speed? Huntress is already top 5 in killers.
---
Okay thank you
---
"Im gonna pass back out"
---
Finally someone uses that word for its intended use
---
I've had to put a survivor to sleep three times because they get two skillchecks during transition, effectively locking me in place for 20+ seconds because survivors can still perform actions
---
Been unable to effectively track in quite a few situations (it's ridiculous finding someone who breaks LOS in the cornfield who stays in your terror radius), on Ormond (still terrible for Freddy despite the aura patch) and in Freddy's dreamworld fog in general (this is a real strain on the eyes).
---
Seen them waltz out an open door just because they're not asleep yet even when I have NOED.
---
It's pretty ridiculous, Freddy needs a lot of changes to his dreamworld and interactions with survivors, and if anything he should be able to see clearly in the dreamworld, fuck that fog. x:
---
I mean pick a platform then?
---
Man I really wish WGLF has more stuff that counted towards it, cause you're not always gonna get an unhook/take a hit. If they can at least add getting a generator done to get a stack that be great.
---
I see it less about losing being fun and more about it not making winning boring.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. 
---
A battlepass only means something unless you make it mean something. 
---
It‚Äôs entirely up to you if you want to purchase it but if it helps the dbd creators earn extra money to help the game then take my money.
---
Damn right they should ‚ÄúAh shit he saw me!‚Äù
---
I know..but I got the killer stun points and everything, and it made the sound, so I was pretty sad.
---
I've always thought some classic horror Characters would be badass. Me and my friend were joking about the creature from the black lagoon
---
dedicated servers are comming, so they won't change that now
---
Does that mean ‚Äòhavoc‚Äô or are you a knighted air conditioner?
---
Can't blame em. But just wave at them or teabag before you unhook them
---
??? Why complain when you don't even know for sure it's p2w? Save it for when it happens, although I guess you won't be the only one once this whole subreddits is filled with it if it does have p2w actions (Like getting more bloodpoints and shit) then yea, I'm on your side then.
---
If the game was bug free and polished, no it would not be an issue.
---
In its current state, very very very much so an issue.
---
It‚Äôs pretty rare they‚Äôll see no aura‚Äôs and if they don‚Äôt then that‚Äôs kinda justified because it implies the other team mates, probably an swf, are going for the save. More often than not those other survivors will reveal them selves pretty quickly to hook rush. 
---
I suppose Exceptions are If you don‚Äôt see auras on maps like Gideon or lerys, since those maps can be pretty small and survivors might be close by anyway.
---
Battle passes are not free. They‚Äôre paid content.
---
but this time you pay for it and it's always there. events are at least temporary
---
We'll see about that. Right now I'm not convinced.
---
If they ***^(N a p)*** the entity gives them a good ol' taste of **~~bloodweb~~** ‚Ñ¢
---
Some died, some just got taken.
---
Quentin is my boyfriend &lt;3
---
I asked if he did this render in Source Filmmaker, you?
---
&gt; The survivor never got to show their true potential because the killer cut them down short for a cheap and shallow victory...
---
Dude, this game isn't chess, it's not a pure contest of skill. There's a shitload of random chance in DbD, even if it's not in-game RNG. Game starts, killer randomly picks which far-away gen to check first, randomly runs into one of the survivors 15 seconds in? That survivor is way, way less likely to survive the match. Killer instead goes to a gen that happens to be far away from where all four survivors spawned together and knocked out a different gen? A 0-kill just got about three times more likely. Neither the killer nor the survivor always gets a chance to "show their true potential".
---
Moris may be the most bullshit, but they aren't super special. Every add-on and perk in the game exists somewhere on the spectrum of bullshit. If this game wanted to make fairness a priority, they'd have to do away with the idea of add-ons being consumable. They are literally things you use to give you an advantage in your next game, ergo games are intentionally designed to sometimes be unfair.
---
&gt; Considering how nerfed the BNP's are it's justified to DC in a loading screen.
---
How does one specific survivor item being nerfed justify dodging a game (and fucking over the other four players) because the killer might maybe be using an item you don't like?
---
&gt; Fuck these kinds of people, you aren't entitled to ruining other peoples state of mind, if you're pissing me off then bye bye.
---
But you've just explained that what "pisses you off" is not toxic behavior, but normal, intended, in-game options. These aren't trolls. You're calling players trolls for using specific options that the game offers *and encourages* you to use because they make you unhappy. Quitting because a killer has mori is just deciding that the other four players should be frustrated because of you instead of you being frustrated by one of them.
---
It's totally fine to hold the opinions you hold about this game being frustrating enough that you don't want to play it, but then... please don't play it. You can't just D/C whenever any of the parts of the game you don't like get used.
---
I'm confused what battlepass is everyone talking about? Has it been leaked or something
---
It does say A notification and not NotificationS. So maybe it only goes off once.
---
I admire your passion.
---
Sorry but I think he‚Äôs right, it works fine I have never once heard of it not working
---
Or you don't pay... One thing we can be sure about is that buying battle pass won't be a mandatory thing.
---
I doubt he will be on mobile
---
the emblem system was implemented FOR SURVIVORS. Just look at how killers have an emblem for KILLING, emblem for HITTING and emblem for... Injuring and hooking...
---
Fair warning, if you're on PS4; I *will* c'mp and tunnel anyone using this perk.
---
It is anti-fun for Killers, especially when used by SWF groups, so I will take away any fun you can have.
---
Up the ante is a perk slot vs an offering though. People tend to run all 4 perks, not everyone plays an offering every game
---
Also usually you have a time limit to do it
---
Battlepasses are the cancer of game models right now. It is how games have evolved, to make the most money:
---
Full game &gt;&gt; Incomplete game but continuous DLC &gt;&gt; Incomplete game but continuous subscription to get any content, as well as continuous DLC.
---
Keep that shit away from me or I will move onto the next game.
---
Not every game that costs Money has a paid BP.
---
His model is in there and everything.
---
I hope whatever battle pass they add is at least $5, $10 on top of the game being $20 is kinda pushing it.
---
Bruh
---
Could be because it is played on pc in the game files. We have no idea if he will be removed on mobile
---
It wasnt a free weekend, it was a PS+ free game to keep forever.
---
And game pass is the new Netflix of video games. Once a movie goes to Netflix.....its pretty much free.
---
When it was first free on PS4, the servers crashed. Overloaded! Dont even pretend like it wasnt a huge boost.
---
Save the date for the game pass release and pay attention to how lobby's act the first few days, it's a huge boost.
---
You‚Äôre done fucking it up. That‚Äôs not his point.
---
You shouldn't have to buy an incomplete game and then be expected to pay a subscription for any content. Fucking ridiculous..
---
Maybe I have resilience and you should know when to fuck off :,)
---
If it was possible, he'd already be everywhere
---
I dun wannit
---
Honestly, this is disgraceful. It really shows where BHVR‚Äôs priorities are. Not only do you have to pay for the game, if you want to access all content you also have to buy all the DLC which is about an extra ¬£30. Then they want to add a battle pass? Not only that, a PAID one too!? I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was a free battle pass where you can get cosmetics and stuff but now they expect their players to pay a monthly fee to unlock all the content of the game. I think they should try to actually fix the game‚Äôs problems before adding more content (especially paid stuff)
---
Spirit Fury, i find it better than Nurse's tbh and more beneficial
---
that's a paddle
---
I want to know too!
---
This is true. I used to be good at both of them, but played others and forgot all about them.
---
I'm trying to pick Huntress back up, though.
---
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to be showing me?
---
Wrong swing, pal.
---
Its good just add lights or something (idk how to do this either just its dark)
---
Message me your psn and I'l let you know

---
The small game thing should be base for survivors tbh
---
No ones being forced to buy who it, if you don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt buy it
---
In my opinion this realm is aweosme for trapper (and alright for other killers)
---
Dont be so pathetic, have some shred of dignity just admit your defeat. Such a whiny ad hominem is transparent as can be in the first place.
---
I mean damn, its also stupid on top of it.
---
&gt; Yeah I'm not reading a wall of baseless, angry speculation lmao.
---
And yet you magically determined its a wall of baseless angry speculations without ever reading it.
---
Second, this entire thing is a speculation, as there is no official confirmation, and if you dont deal in speculations, why didnt you just follow the ancient proverb applying to the likes of you "si tacuisses", and instead speculated yourself?
---
Obviously you are the one with issues here.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to that tbh. The game is already set up to support FTP, but It'd be nice if they decreased the ftp grind for killers/survivors slightly, but that said. Battle pass is still not a good idea opposed to just adding cosmetics to buy.
---
Wow, in the whole movie he never closes his eyes and this is the only time he can rest a bit
---
And poor Dwight eat his fingers
---
Well we did get Nurse and Huntress for free but I guess that was a long time ago.
---
Yeah I love freddy and all but I think it's could be nice we give more love to Jackie, (the one who played freddy in the remake) he was more scariest and intimidating than robert
---
You downplayed it being free on PS4
---
Yeah possibly im not sure. I havent replicated the bug bc I don't play killer much, and I have been to busy to really play at all
---
If you're planning on playing Spirit more often anyway, I'd get Nurse's Calling with shards and get Spirit Fury by just levelling up Spirit with bloodpoints.
---
that'd be cool but his mori will be kinda lame since we already have Hag
---
Happened to me as well on Lerys...
---
I think it's supposed to be the end game collapse entity but for some reason it loads before it should...
---
"Wakey wakey hands off snakey"
---
"Purely cosmetic" is a shit argument normally but in a game of hide and seek where your outfit can help determine your visibility, "purely cosmetic" is almost akin to buying power.
---
The only thing I need with Wraith is a yellow rarity "Shadow Dance" Addon
---
i'm actually okay with that lol
---
Yeah. I suppose they could do that and use the battle pass to make it much easier to get cosmetics for those who support the game, but that is really only logical if the game goes ftp as they could just reduce the grind and have people buy the cosmetics directly which does exactly the same thing as battle pass. It'd allow people to pay to skip grind/grind less while allowing them to pick and choose what they get.
---
All of them are absent from their homes in one way or another, though. Some died, some merely "got lost".
---
I recommend Spirit Fury if you don't have the spirit unlocked. Nurse is free so you can just level her up. If you have spirit, disregard this comment.
---
dark smithy?
---
Oh ok, lol I am blind, thanks!
---
Naw. This is indeed Scott
---
this is why i don‚Äòt run this perk
---
yeah, but every mori is completely different, i feel like his mori would be way too similar to Hag's
---
Auric cells exist. The "not being milked for cash" ship has fucking sailed.
---
Haddonfield isn't that bad. It's the corn maps that I hate with a passion
---
Legion and bubba at top? Oh boy your gonna make people mad
---
Same as shop basically
---
So u want grindy mobile tactics on a console game? (I mean we kinda already have it but besides the point) You want a pay to win? You really love micro transactions? That is literally what ruins games. But also DBD has many problems and it doesn‚Äôt need a battle pass yet.  They still need to reveal the promised Freddy Rework and fix everything that needs to be fixed in their Developer Update, which is a super long list. A battle pass just wouldn‚Äôt fit in, and it wouldn‚Äôt fit in at this moment knowing something else will get fucked up in game.
---
This sounds about right. It has nothing to do with morals and everything to do with these shitlords always wanting free content.
---
Yet freddy is still in D-tier omegalol
---
Try adding more lights, always have at least two lights that you created in your scene. Make sure to position them in two different angles, too. Mess with the colors a little bit and find a hue that you like.
---
Most important, use more lights. Keep these up
---
No problem!
---
Billy has the best map pressure in the game and an instant down. And he is still 115% movement speed killer. Give me a reason to play any other 115% speed killer.
---
Agreed, I only support a battlepass if the game would be going FTP anyways. A battlepass on a paid game would just be greed on their part, seeing the unanimous rage towards it though I doubt they‚Äôd try to pull that shit on their community lol.
---
It doesn't counter camp at all. If the killer does not see aura he just patrol around his hook.
---
I'm not boycotting the battle pass or saying i won't buy it.
---
my personal opinion is 2 things - 1. DBD is already making money hand over fist, this just seems fairly greedy to me considering how successful the game is.
---
2. I really don't like premium passes in paid games,
---
One can only dream, I wouldn‚Äôt play as anyone else, I still play Left 4 Dead,
---
Awesome, glad its coming to the game, cosmetic only and will add more reasons to play, people need to stop crying about it. Dont buy it if you dont want it.
---
Decisive Strike is probably the most Ash-like perk you could equip.
---
Be careful though; if you run DS and MoM some Killers might call you an Ashhole.
---
Batlle passes promote a realy bad habbit where players play constantly because if they dont they might not get the exclusive cosmetics from the battle pass. It also makes skins more about flexing tiers instead of actually wearing something you like.
---
Ruin, enduring and spirit fury + sloppy is top tier for M1 killers. 
---
Pop goes the weasel is really nice but honestly seeing as how he has no real way to get from place to place in a reasonable time like spirit and nurse, it‚Äôs better to replace it with a perk such as Ruin or Devour Hope.
---
How the fuck is this meme still funny  
---
Seriously this meme is going to shit
---
my brother has a weird glitch where a portion of one of Ash's voiced lines will randomly play at loud volumes during gameplay
---
there's nothing more terrifying than trying to avoid being seen by the killer when suddenly Ashley moans into your ear

---
Ahh another persona 5R fan I see
---
you seem a bit clueless about the game history.
---
BBQ bring a lot on the table for killer. Before that when you played killer you had  no clue where to go after you just hooked someone. Which mean that it was extremely risky to camp your hook since you could not know at all if the 3 others were rushing gens or if 2 were coming for unhook etc...
---
There is a before and an after BBQ.
---
Mmm... seems good
---
That's an incredibly stupid question, it's like asking people if they want to continue to live, they'll always say yes
---
"What happened to the old days, muh rank and skill".
---
Bro, rank is fucking pointless in this game because there are no rewards for it. Besides sweatier opponents and longer queue times. Whoop dee fucking do. For some people, that fictional skirt is more important than that fictional rank. Crazy, right?
---
and it's not an extremely good perk in addition.
---
That's what you thought lmao
---
Well he was
---
We are voicing our opinion. Whether or not it gets heard, is unknown. Leaning towards the no side here
---
Not fake, haha
---
And some people play the game because it's fun, and love having something to progress toward. It's cool that you don't need that, but you have to stop acting like your mindset is the best mindset. My opinion isn't a fact and neither is yours.
---
People logic is so dumb, they'll drop 10$ on a SINGLE skin, but oh no they offer you a pass where its just skins and theres like 20-40 of them? Nah fuck that cuz its got the name "battle pass"
---
Wait. What‚Äôd I miss while I was away. Why are there two killers, and if this is a glitch, why haven‚Äôt they just made a new game mode with double the survivors (or maybe just 6, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be difficult to balance)
---
There are goals in the game Cookie Clicker, does that make the game fun? My point is a game is predatory for padding hours if all someone has is a goal without the gameplay being fun.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to dab every time I hit a killer with a pallet.
---
That's short for Chernobyl, right?
---
Two words... SHIRTLESS MYERS

If she doesn‚Äôt have three crows it won‚Äôt give notifications

If you mean you wanna be "Canon" to the game lore...as a survivor, do what you can for your team, but don't necessarily throw your life away if there's no chance for at least one of you to escape unless you wanna be a hero and trade places with some guy cause you got enough blood points already. Also don't use someone's aura perk to run a killer on them ...I get sandbagged a ton using aftercare and it's pretty scummy when you think about it. I use a perk that activates when helping someone and then they turn on me. It was spicy, sure, but oh so scummy.
---
As killer, many people say just kill the survivors. This leads to a lot of playstyles your survivors will get salty over. However some are just salty in general no matter what you do. No matter how you play someone will find something to complain about bc many are sore losers. If you wanna be Canon like I said, your job isn't to just kill, it's to do all the other emblems and torture the survivors into believing they will escape and then when their hope is full, you "harvest" it for the entity to consume. Is someone you keep running for and throwing on the hook with no chance to do much but get farmed by their team hopeful? This is why I wish there was some hope gauge mechanic where a killer can do certain things to get a survivors gauge full before sacrificing for maximum points. Instead we got emblems which no one even cares for since certain ones are messed up.
---
Hell yea buster
---
Big oof
---
It's not that. You're not paying 10$ on a bunch of skins, you're paying 10$ to have to grind a lot for a bunch of skins or pay even more to get them.
---
I've mentioned here a lot that battle passes cause me a lot of personal stress because I'm very OCD about completing things as well as limited time only stuff making it worse (although I do have hope that BHVR won't remove the items and instead put them in the regular store after the pass is over).
---
Battle passes aren't a bad idea for cosmetic only. However, I voted against the idea regardless.
---
However, the moment you give in game rewards, such as BP/Shards/Auric Cells, it becomes a problem. The game inherently becomes more Pay 2 Win.
---
It has nothing to do with Fortnite, and a purely cosmetic battle pass would in fact help out the game and have absolutely no negative consequences.
---
They could also make it so the FREE battle pass is the only one that gives BP/Shard rewards, locking cosmetics behind the paid one, and it would also be fine.
---
I hate the false narrative pushed by using the statement "This isn't Fortnite". If it's done right it can be done well. However I'm unsure if BHVR would be willing to do it right.
---
Dude it's been 9 days. I don't care that I was wrong.

---
There's  a time limit now, if I want to get a character a specific perk I have all the time in the world, but 30 days would be too short unless they make it 90 or something.
---
Freddy needs to be higher, he is quite good at doing absolutely nothing
---
but with costs they already again make a crap load of money from regular non licensed DLC's which run for about 5-6$ a pop, and the skin shop, which a lot of people purchase from with Auric Cells.
---
We obviously don't have access to profits but it's pretty clear to see they have more than enough money to *not* do this.
---
I would be fine if it was a level system - play and earn rewards, but the fact it has a premium track aswell irks me.
---
bright side it could likely just be a place holder they were testing, it doesn't seem completely fleshed out, so they could very well not push it.
---
but that's my 2 cents on the matter.
---
Well, my bad man. Though it doesn't surprise me BHVR does that.
---
Yeah but what about other payed games that have battlepasses, like black ops 4 (if I‚Äôm thinking of the right game) and hey, it‚Äôll give more cosmetics for less money, like instead of paying 10$ for one cosmetic you could pay 10$ for like 10 cosmetics, and much much more.
---
I think they did a pretty good job so far on the sounds so idk about this
---
Legacy.
---
Just Legacy above legacy 1.
---
At least it‚Äôs not $60 like COD
---
I do dislike the auras of survivors in the dreamworld thing because there is no counterplay to it(besides hiding in a locker?). The rest of him is great though.
---
They should *instead* make rewards for devotion levels and seasonal survivor and killer ranks with longer seasons.
---
Ive been playing this game for years with most of my surv lvl 50 tier 3 and its so pointless.
---
I'd honestly prefer cosmetics. They usually are the real endgame for me.
---
Better yet! Your teammate is running will make it and you crouch to heal and they just completely run away from you.
---
Time to derank hehehehe 
---
Jk I ain‚Äôt no scum bag
---
I really think it would look cool and a bit different compared to most killer using their weapons, with the werewolf killer he would be the weapon
---
I wish more survivors looked up to the good killers, instead of always shitting them. As a killer it feels good when they acknowledge that you outplayed them, but most of the time they just insult :(
---
I like the way they do sabotage. Sabotage time is based on how many hooks are on map. 20 hooks is like 3 second sabotage... 3 hooks left is like 2 minutes. Hooks don't come back but killer can wear a perk to fix them.
---
Yeah, it's just that once you go down your getting camped.
---
What game is this called?
---
If that happens then I‚Äôm sure everybody would be happy with a battle pass. Until then I‚Äôm not going to be happy with them wasting their time on this when there are more important problems with the game I‚Äôve paid (personally) about $200 on and it‚Äôs been two years and there are still many game breaking issues and just shit stuff (ranking system, and they ONLY NOW just made it so you get your offerings back if the game doesn‚Äôt start)
---
We don't know anything about the pass yet, maybe before already passing judgements on it we should wait and see what is it going to be?
---
Sure, if the time window to complete the pass is very tiny, then yeah I think that's dumb too. But as it is right now we don't know anything. 
---
I have nothing against the idea of the pass itself, if it turns out to be some super short &amp; super expensive pass with exclusive cosmetics tied to it then I will change my mind about it. For now we just have to wait and see.
---
Shitting your pants isn't mandatory but people wouldn't like it if you did.
---
Where can I find the leaks to a battlepass?
---
Just look at all the non-unique common killer addons.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm a survivor main but emotes as killer would be way more satisfactory
---
Would you choose to shit your pants?
---
Yea weren‚Äôt we shitting on one another recently about legion? Coz not enough people spoke up about it until AFTER they changed him, and now we are speaking up before they make a change...  but that‚Äôs bad?
---
The only time you should be super reluctant to heal under hook is against Huntress, Nurse, Spirit, Billy, because they can punish you for it across the map. Finding a happy little spot to immerse yourself (and inevitably get caught out by BBQ) is a waste of time that you could be using to do useful things.
---
No, it's why I'm not getting the pass. Also they're not free cosmetics, you bought them with the pass but you just don't get them right away
---
DC, DC
---
Wow that‚Äôs fucked up that even EU IP‚Äôs can match with people from a different continent.
---
But that just means one thing - That it has everything to do with BHVR, because even if you match up with Arabs even though you literally have an European IP then there‚Äôs nothing you can do. 
---
So tell me, how would a VPN help me in my case if even you an European match with Middle easterners?
---
Hallowed Wraiths. They're always toxic
---
try to link me a discussion on the steam hub or on the forum that talks about the leak on the battle pass or the mobile version
---
&gt;Thanks for quoting the entire comment you were replying to, just in case someone missed it the first time.
---
I always quote comments because it is common for people to edit or straight up delete their posts. Then, when I revisit the thread, I have no idea what I was replying to.
---
If you‚Äôve played fortnite, you‚Äôll notice that wearing non-Battle-pass skins make you seem cooler because the battle pass is the norm.
---
wouldn't that force more killer diversity in r1 tho? there would be more freddies, trappers, pigs, etc on higher ranks
---
"Psychos lair" "Dark smithy" LOOOL
---
So DbD is going F2P now?
---
It‚Äôs worse when they have Breakdown and STILL run away
---
Username checks out :)
---
****Fortnite default dance intensifies*****
---
I can do you one better.  I unhooked with we'll make it and they had breakdown and they still ran like hell.  Killer wasn't stealthy and never came near us.
---
Why are you all so upset about this? It's all cosmetic, and if it's priced like any other battlepass on the market it'll be a lot cheaper than just buying the pieces individually. Battle passes are generally a good deal
---
I can confirm this
---
ƒ±m hag and nurse main and what is hadonfield :D
---
I‚Äôm being dense yet you‚Äôre the one responding to an 18 hour old conversation in which I already entirely conceded and said I was mistaken. And chill with the caps lock homie, entirely unnecessary.
---
That's probably going to be the case.
---
But hey i mean, yay more grinding! the 1 thing DBD was missing was a grind! /s

a battle pass is the definition of grindy shit. and u even gotta pay for them too!
---
Shockingly I don't think the art team would be very good at implementing a new game mode. Besides that two killer mode you all clamor for would be nearly impossible to balance (Even worse than the game already is) and only sounds fun if you don't think about it for 3 seconds.
---
All imma say is if he's on mobile he BETTER be on console
---
Yeah there‚Äôs an icon. I still usually duck around a tree or something cause unless the killers actively chasing someone else, they always seem to book it back real fast lol
---
Sure it's a choice but there's nothing "free" about it. All the games I've seen with Battle passes in them do have a "free" version but none of the free versions ever have anything good except exp bonuses (except VERY rareley on like one of those games). Most of the good stuff like cosmetics and gestures and things of that Calibur are usually on the paid battle pass which is usually anywhere above 20 dollars. And even then u gotta work ur ass off on something that is a limited time. Unless they made the battle pass free itself then I disagree with it just for the fact that what if u buy it and don't get the chance to play much? Or what if u buy it and it's half way through the time limit or more ending up on u missing out on half the battle pass? The only way I'd agree with it is if all the rewards get put on the store after the timed battle pass ends that way u don't miss out otherwise I feel like battle passes are usually just meant for bragging rights. Like "Oh I paid 30 dollars and played 15+ hours a day to get all the rewards so my characters look awesome when I play" then the unlucky few who can't afford it or did buy it but only got a small percentage through suffer cause they can't obtain the items or have to buy loot boxes and such with huge RNG to obtain them. Anyway getting carried away here, all I'm saying is if it's not free then they should at least put all rewards on the store to be fair to all players. Maybe make them cost Auric Cells or be the same price of shards as the highest cosmetics (21k if I'm not mistaken)
---
I'll follow for maybe 5-10 seconds, if you run past rocks, buildings and any other good hiding areas I am turning around. Unless its my daily.
---
Oh, I thought you meant here on Reddit. Sorry for the misunderstanding, that is odd though. Hopefully they won't go through with it since they've seen that it's clearly not a popular move?
---
I‚Äôm talking about the ‚ÄúFree Track‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs literally a free part of the pass, with bp, shards and cosmetics
---
Unless the killer is already in a new chase, he will go back to the hook. If you stay under the hook he will find you and just tunnel the guy you unhooked, or occupy someone in a chase. Even if he doesn't directly see you he will see your tracks. If you just leave from under the hook for even 10 seconds as soon as you are unhooked and heal after that you are giving up your 10 seconds for the killers over a minute while he goes back to hook, finds nobody, and has to find someone all over again, instead of him making it back to hook in 10 seconds, finding you healing under it, and tunneling the shit out of the guy you just unhooked.
---
I play killer 90% of the time, and I allways find people under the hook and it helps A LOT, since I can focus down the same person, plus I never have to spend time actually finding survivors since they just present themselfs on a silver platter. Hiding is an extremely underutilised thing in this game.
---
Hillbillies with racoon hats. It feels like they have the biggest ego ever and once a chase starts it won‚Äôt end until you die. Literally they will chase you for 5 gens just because their ego can‚Äôt take it when someone is better than them.
---
They will throw entire matches just to tunnel you and then hook you when the exit gates are already open.
---
Pretty much as relevant as any other fanmade tierlist on this subreddit
---
&gt;There are goals in the game Cookie Clicker, does that make the game fun?
---
&gt;My point is a game is predatory for padding hours if all someone has is a goal without the gameplay being fun.
---
Your point is dumb. Why do you have such a hard time understanding that people like things you don't?
---
Jump scare Myers is always fun! I always seem to vs him on the doctors map even when no one uses an offering.
---
Fortnite has one and fortnite bad game because popular.
---
I think it's simply because the leak on the battle pass and on the mobile version was not intentional, unlike ghostface
---
Lmao yeah that scene was waaaaay over the top and I definitely felt a bit queazy while watching it.
---
Horrorfield
---
Honestly, I really need something to grind in this game rn. Got all achievements, almost all characters P3L50, getting max rank is too easy.. A battle pass would definitely keep me playing for a lot more hours
---
I‚Äôm not saying everything would be positive about it if this were even the case, because it‚Äôs literally the reason I stopped playing fortnite. The challenges were way too hard and timeconsuming for me to even bother. I do have the rocket pass and that one is easy to level up so it highly depends on how hard the grind would be.
---
Facing hex totems in The Game be like..
---
No problem, have fun and be Groovy!
---
Slim thick
---
Pumpkinhead Nurse and Rogimask Trapper. That's almost a guaranteed camp, tunnel, and NOED.
---
Tier lists are always the same no matter the platform. Nurse is always S tier.
---
1. The point someone has made in reply - which messes up games.
---
2. I take the view that customisation and any form of content is vital to a games funness and success, so people can be unique. DBD however is one of the games where cosmetics aren't important, aside from maybe wearing something dark.
---
3. Content is still content. It creates a system where people who don't subscribe don't get any content, or anything new unless they do.
---
4. Releasing incomplete games with planned DLC, and releasing incomplete games with a subscription-based business model - is the cancer of video games. We've hit a wall because of this gambling-based gaming. Games have stopped improving, not because of the technology, but because of the cloud, and this type of business modelling.
---
DBD currently has a better than average business model amidst the mess. Buy the game, small microtransactions for additional cosmetics or characters. (Not ¬£20 for 1 skin, hello fortnite).
---
I hope you didn't take any add-ons or offerings into that game. :(
---
Every clown has NOED
---
not if they are on console.
---
&gt; when they literally have 0 information on it otherwise.
---
You do know that BeHavior did not invent the concept of battlepasses right? The information we have is every other game and company that has done the same.
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt affect anyone who doesn‚Äôt like it in any way it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúWash I don‚Äôt want the game to be like fortnite waaaah‚Äù
---
Badwater.exe
---
Idk isn't the main point of battle passes is to get profit? It would be nice if they do that tho, then I'd absolutely have no problem with it, especially since ppl who don't need their Shards anymore would have another purpose to use em.
---
I mean that's true, they can't afford cosmetics considering one outfit is 10 dollars (which btw is ridiculous lol) but then again MOST cosmetics cost Shards. Maybe not the newer and more flashier ones but at least 75% of them do.
---
... yet everybody find normal the fact that you have free additional content for years after you paid 20$ for the game (all non licenced killers and survivors, new maps...).
---
Theirs been some images of the menu floating around for a few weeks but the other day footage was realised from the same menu showing game play of both survivor and killer (which was ghost face) so only leaks, but does look pretty real based on the graphics looking like an actual mobile games. Reminded me of the type of graphics from gmod mobile
---
Too accurate
---
That‚Äôs also not very cash money of you.
---
I **don't** want them to work on battle passes. Oh dear what an impasse. DLC plan means nothing unless they hire more people to fill in the gaps the battlepass would eat up.
---
Ha ha, what an empty point "Who would've thought", you didn't even address anything I said "Oh I like those games anyway", so you *like* the battlepasses having more focus for the player than the *game?* Shall I just assume you prefer meaningless busywork over fun then?
---
I don't see why my point doesn't hold up. Fork knife + Warframe have large dev teams, if your argument is "B- b- buh they can spend time on both!" and yet the only *new* mechanics are... cannons no-one uses, slipstreams that all the children online scream about being OP, painting building is easier, oh wait the game is still just build over-&gt;shotgun-&gt;SMG if they're not dead. Warframe on the other hand got planks... last year... before the crappy story that is "Oh and Nora sees the Wolf went and beat up someone else, ain't he so bad? But not badass like you, tenno." and you failed to address my point of Nora talking over unique quest dialogue. Gotta love it when dailies ruin your story.
---
As I said before, battlepasses are a skinnerbox drip feeding of content. People want more game, and people want those fancy things the neo lewt bawx bringeths, they don't want "Place top 12 squads with a friend, 5 times", "Shoot people on ziplines that no-one uses" or "Scan 10 things! What do you mean you got Helios and scanned everything already? Then go put stars in 5 Ayatan Sculptures! What do you mean you already do that as soon as and there's only one guaranteed Sculpture to earn per week, did you not hear this is a weekly quest so you'd better hop to it and find them randomly in missions you little farmer you!"
---
Thanks for agreeing on the objectives. I hope someday it'll be more in line with the game. I do think the chase/be chased/escape/repair the equivalent of 3 gens are good objectives.
---
I think a bloodweb is extensive progression towards what you want, the perks and addons, with a bundle of in between stuff you don't want, +bloodpoint earning, bad addons/items and bad perks. I think a battlepass is extensive progression towards what you want, with a lot of what you don't want in between.
---
went back to the video, my bad.
---
It doesn't matter.
---
The bottom line is if a game is pay to win then it is fucking atrocious and should not be played. This is the scum of gaming.
---
You don't need to pat game devs on the back for not making their game pay to win.
---
All battlepasses are cosmetics. But cosmetics are part of the game, whether or not they impact it. Content is content. If you put content that would traditionally be given for the game price, behind a subscription pay wall, then you are milking your players. It is also not usually just basic cosmetics, but any new cosmetic or profiling or customisation features that they decide to add into the game.
---
It ends up that if you don't subscribe you get a 'spotify free' version of the game and get treated like a 2nd rate player.
---
You‚Äôre suggesting the ambush should be insta down????
---
Playing against Legion is pointless. There is no counter and he is super annoying. When you play against Huntress, Nurse or Myers, you can you your skill to beat them. What you can do against Legion?
---
Well that‚Äôs my point tho, say the paid battlepass has a full outfit for like 10 characters, that would be so much money, but if the pass is just $10, you‚Äôd be paying less for a lot more(and yes I know people won‚Äôt want every single cosmetic)
---
It‚Äôs alright
---
Well they obviously don‚Äôt have any of those perks
---
Yeah, it's bizarre that they cost more than DLC, but are they too expensive or are the DLCs cheap? In most games skins do go for $5-$10. why would this game be different?
---
Actually it can. You can completely avoid an encounter entirely, and it gives you a lot of information if you do decide to chase about what the killer is planning when out of line of sight
---
beautiful 10/10 :)
---
He really isn't.
---
Noed for Sloppy
---
You do realize they rebalanced him, right? It‚Äôs actually a fair game now
---
Dead by daylight has seasons though.
---
Dwight watching u from the locker
---
P3 Claudettes.
---
Now you see me, just kidding you never saw me to begin with.
---
Why do you think she is ready with the Hatchet? She ain't letting Trapper take the kids!
---
He can still get them, he has billy, spirit fury is in the shrine. I am just giving advice.
---
Would by the battle pass asap if that was true
---
i hate to play with trapper, isnt fun :(
---
Well that just brings me back to what I said earlier. Ik it would be cheaper but WHAT IF someone was to buy it and not have time to finish? Or all the ppl who can't buy it cause they either don't have money (usually middle/high schoolers) or need their money for better purposes like bills and things they need. (Granted 10 dollars isn't much but if ur a grown person who has some decently high bills or has to pay for something to get fixed chances are u won't have that 10 dollars unless ur lucky to have it left over)
---
It satisfies me knowing how long it probably took to type that out on console.
---
I dont know how to fully answer the question but I can tell you this. As someone who less than likely will be getting the battle pass, it will still be good for me, because basically the more you play you will unlock these 'tiers and I assume some will be locked if you dont have the battle pass, but not all. This means that I can continue to play as i always have, with a chance to unlock free cosmetics and also bloodpoints.
---
Throw the game and farm for me when I'm survivor and I'll type anything you like in postgame chat.
---
Plague is definitely A
---
So its like.... free stuff? No matter what? Huh.
---
Nurse is top, also on console
---
My favorite is the "we let you win because we felt bad for you" yeah sure sweetie, tell me another fairytale.
---
Thats not what I meant. I don't think Behaviour will increase the amount of BP you'll get overall. If the introduction of the pass will increase overall BP gain by say 10%, then the amount of BP you get by usual games will decrease by 10% or the prices will somehow be raised by 10%.
---
The fact that people feel like they don't get enough BP has been a problem for a long time - I don't know why Behaviour would change that now.
---
Maybe that's just the pessimist speaking in me, though.
---
Won‚Äôt stop, the subs filled with killer mains.
---
I didn't say that he is OP. He has no counter. Playing against him is pointless. He can jump over pallets and windows,...
---
I think the survivors MUST NOT be dead lorewise. Even the devs, however wonky and vague their lore information may be, have stated so in past Dev Streams.  
---
Essentially, the survivor characters we control are merely their souls. Their actual bodies are in an unknown place.  
---
The Entity feeds on hope, and dead things have neither hope nor souls to begin with. A dead body is useless.  
---
In DbD Lore, Bill from L4D was also taken mere moments before being ended in his timeline, just to give an example.

I'm the oposite lol. I got all P3, achivments ect and have nothing to work for, which is why I'm enjoying the game more, I can freely play how I like and not feel like I need to play the optimal way to quickly get bloodpoints to see how certain perk comboes ect would work, Now I get to do those combos and diffrent playstyles.
---
I don't see why grinding is even needed in games, I got 1K hours in l4d2 and that has no progresssion system whatsoever, I had around 800 hours in TF2 before it got a leveling system.
---
1000 Hours in gmod where I avoided servers with progression, mostly because a lot of them became donate to win.
---
so I've personally always enjoyed progressionless games.
---
No. I played about 5 games against him. Today it was 6th game, but i DCed. I was not interested.
---
How to play against him? Tell me.
---
But he cant down you and has a larger cooldown than the bloody nurse xD he has so much counterplay now
---
To every Claud mains
---
He does have counters,
---
Situation: chasing you with frenzy
---
Run to a loop, sit at the pallet, if he respects it, just wait, if not, stun him - no more frenzy
---
If he respects and you drop it, when he vaults it, you could fake that you‚Äôre going to vault back and he‚Äôll smack the pallet and end his frenzy.
---
Saying he had no counter play is a bit much, ever since he was rebalanced he does actually have counters
---
As of now or before?
---
Not perfect. It shows that you're bad enough to think Tir Optics are worth using.
---
Nothing too :(
---
That‚Äôs the joke pal
---
Thank you very much. I will try.
---
Adrenalin pops while infront of the killer and you instantly get downed again, love this situation
---
As long as they don't add emotes I think it's ok, it'll make some money that can go towards more characters and maps and if no one likes it then nobody will buy it then they probably won't do it again anyways. There is also the possibility this isn't even gonna come out still
---
If I'm going to buy something I want it immediately, I don't want to purchase the ability to work for something. In my eyes battle passes are the construct of Hitler himself, but to each their own. If people want battle passes, cool. If people don't want battle passes, don't buy them.
---
I'm not for/against putting shards/points in there, it's just something I don't really care about. 
---
For me it'd just be another "daily" ritual.
---
Freddy in C Tier, Legion in D tier, and Doctor in E tier made me chuckle a bit. 
---
Freddy is without a doubt the easiest killer to counter as survivor and probably the hardest to play as/win as. F tier imo.
---
Legion is kind of a mixed bag for me. I love the motherfuckers to death to the point where I‚Äôm rank 1 however that‚Äôs because I refuse to use the power. I‚Äôd say Legion in C tier. Imo. 
---
Doctor. Is. A. Cunt. No matter what platform. Fucking up the skill checks, endless shocking, etc. however he isn‚Äôt the best but a definite A tier.
---
I like the tier list a lot though, but I‚Äôd switch pig and plague entirely. I‚Äôve never lost to a pig before but makes me hurt.
---
Making a battlepass is not bugfixing. The ongoing making skins for the battlepass takes time away from artists who can make new killer models/skins, new survivor models/skins, new effect models/textures, new map models/textures. A battlepass does not mean it's paid and paid does not mean new workers to fill in gaps.
---
Colour me surprised that you ignored my point that there is so much emphasis for the battlepass content, it overruns the normal game and is designed to train you to partake in the metagame, to give them more money. I wouldn't say they *need* money either. Epic has too much money from selling expensive skins alone and Warframe doesn't ask you to pay for their battlepass, you're forced to have it, it's there to make you *play the game more, more, more, make it a part of your life so you might eventually buy plats* to the detriment of the main game itself.
---
Thank you for being people who waste time doing nonsense whilst the game is happening on the other side of the map. Go play Skyrim if you like meaningless busywork instead of player interaction. Shoot people on ziplines no-one uses, use cannons/planes to go through rings, do basic elemental damage because why use the 10 times better combinations like magnetic, spend 10 minutes looking for a banner/star at coords to just give up and google for pictures, plug stars into 5 Ayatan sculptures you don't have because you already did that for the endo and you can only reliably earn 1 per week and this weekly ends in 1 week. Yes, doing things and trying builds you wouldn't normally go for because you don't do that to play the game. Hoops for skins you paid for, just jump!
---
*Saying it was bad before doesn't mean it'll be bad now!* Great point, really, you showed me. Loot boxes have never been done well and each different implementation winds up worse or better, with either meaningless content (meta resources, meta XP, sprays), or meaningless busywork (waiting for it to open), or both, and very rarely had you gambling for just good things you want, that is if you don't mind having any of the skins in dota loot boxes rather than wanting them all. If you can point to a battlepass implementation that isn't bad, has a lack of meaningful content, isn't designed to siphon your money, isn't designed to give you objectives perpendicular to playing the game, doesn't get in the way of just hitting play to ready up... then you can show me why I should potentially support a dev who the leaks seem to show will just put in the pass a few danglies you can put on your hooks and that's all we know of.
---
Great, you have your second bloodweb.
---
We also have Identity V which is basically mobile DBD.
---
Well they could do it like apex did you would get more xp if you play with different characters every week
---
People don't like it because it reminds them of Fortnite, so it must be a bad thing, also, they don't like timegated exclusives because apparently forcing you to play during a set period of time to get something you don't even need is "predatory"
---
Whats this f2p news I've been seeing. Is it just common speculation or is was there something in the dev build that hinted it?
---
&gt; I can't deal with how toxic Killers have become.
---
So you joined them. Nice.
---
We got this same reaction for the cosmetic store, too, but that turned out great. People love it for the most part. As long as they don't add goofy dances. Would mind some simple emotes to help solo survivors communicate.
---
Eh idc if they make a good value battle pass like fortnites or something.
---
The skins in this game aren't worth buying so only a battlepass could get me putting money towards it.
---
Prince? More like druggy overlord.

It does affect gameplay, and we have seen it. There are bloodpoints in it. (If you watch this video: https://youtu.be/9U8_IDbL7e4). The bloodpoints are in small amounts, but if they release it I'm 100% sure they'll increase them greatly. Paul Esther (I think that is the name) also made a video on this I believe. The original posts were removed, but you have multiple peoples word's and logic.
---
Spamming flashlight usually makes them stop for me, the noise gets their attention.
---
DONT OPEN THE FUCKING GATES IF SOMEONE IS HOOKED AND THERES A PIG YOU SELFISH PIECE OF CLOSE MINDED FUCKS. WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?????
---
I'm just saying they would have more opportunity to win more than someone who didn't buy the pass, and both would have the same skill level, that's all.
---
I use the outskirts to travel
---
It's the worst. I could have you healed by the time we make it to your special corner!
---
Not sure why you are downvoted. This is pretty much the only comment of reason I have seen regarding the pass so far :/ All the changes, all the extra staff costs A LOT, considering the studio have grown so much.

nope lmao I hate myself

It really do be like that sometimes
---
I think you are a bit too obsessed with the Fortnite aspect here. Acting like fortnite really innovated or invented anything instead of just taking shit from other games and being popular.
---
The "FORTNITE BAD SO THEREFORE BATTLEPASS BAD" ideology is full on pepega. People said the same when they introduced cosmetics in 2.0 but oh look what a surprise, nearly a year later and everyone fucking loves the cosmetics.
---
Where are all the crybabies saying it would be the end of DBD? Oh suddenly they quietened down. I wonder if all the battle pass whiners will do the same lol
---
Not me, the killer could be camping and I'll still sit still for the unhooker the heal me
---
I mean for one thing the environment, it's my favorite, especially the music. When it comes to actual map design I kinda like the compact nature of it. It kinda counter stealth but makes the actual chase worse
---
I just wish they would let us use shards as well to buy it. Almost all the good shit cost cells so I have like 80K and nothing to spend it on
---
How is this going to affect people? Cosmetics are just skins, not perks. You don't get any advantage in game for that. You don't have to buy it. If you REALLY REALLY want a certain skin, you can just buy a pass for a month, get this skin and that's about it. But game-wise there is no effect whatsoever.
---
Ooh it definitely does. Have you played Nurse on console?
---
ITT: People who hate fortnite and cannot see past it to make judgements of their own
---
That is true the one glitch we had that help speed up the event they patched that shit faster than I have ever seen them fix a glitch lol. And I remember when they only wanted to give us one outfit and I thought that was lame as hell
---
Yes or people 10 and under. I was in a KYF and I found someone (they had to be like 9) and as soon as I started the chase, "STOP TUNNELING ME"
---
It's basically useless unless you're in a SWF
---
I never understood why killers shake there head after you looped them for like 4 gens.
---
No I‚Äôm not talking about ‚Äòpost-release content‚Äô in general, like you are trying to pedantically point to. I‚Äôm talking about game business models that plan to release the game unfinished and then release further episodes of content over a period of time as the game gets ‚Äòfinished‚Äô. It comes in many forms. 
---
I work in business commercialisation and routes to market, in the IP sector. If you can't see that this is a continually developing thing (and I suggest you look back to how games used to be made) then I'm not going to spend my time trying to explain it to you or provide sources of companies saying "Yes it is our intention to milk gamers for as much as we can". It is very clear in this market. And battle pass 'subscription' based business models are the worst of the lot.
---
Honestly now, why do you think the devs are itching to release a battle pass even though the community has said 'please god no', why did apex rush out a shitty battlepass? Because they all want a piece of that delicious new revenue stream.
---
technically you can buy specific characters through playtime, it just makes more sense to buy the dlc for what you want when its on sale since those tend to have two characters.
---
How is the game overpriced? How many hours do you have in the game? Divide the price of the game by the cost of the game and figure out how much each hour has cost you.
---
Buy a AAA title and play it for 40 hours for ¬£50, people are fine with it
---
Buy DBD and play it for 2000 hours for ¬£15
---
People are fucking delusional
---
I had an abysmal game the other day and I was soon sole survivor left alive with 5 gens to go, killer had BBQ so knew where I was anyway, and I didn't feel like I even deserved the hatch. So I ran towards the killer, I nodded at him and turned my back waiting for the kill, but he nodded and made me follow to a generator so I could repair and he breaks it, and he just kept doing that, so I crouched in front of him, I brought him to a hook, he wouldn't down me. I ended up running around the map looking for the hatch. He eventually downed me, then brought me to the hatch and released me there. I said thanks in post-game, a bit confused, and he said "np but you suck at farming".
---
Just. Is farming a regular thing when only one survivor is left alive? Is it even worth anyone's time? What should I have even done to give him more BPs?
---
Yeah that would be good
---
I‚Äôd be 100 percent ok with that since in my opinion cells and You can‚Äôt reallu buy much with shards that are even that good I have like 80k shards just waiting
---
Y‚Äôall do realize that the battle pass leak included extra blood points and shards for those with the pass? Seems a little stupid.
---
Stolen from Reddit - Posted on Facebook - Back to Reddit.

It's come full circle!
---
P3 trappers have usually been decent on chases but absolutely legendary with traps. Never use a pallet, go through grass, or enter a building.
---
Why do people use the SFM things instead of the actual meme format. I think it's insanely cringy
---
I thought people complained because they didn't have the time (job/holiday/injury/life) to partake in the Crismis event, not because of the rewards.
---
I and other people have complained about the battlepass' grind and design to make you buy early in regards to the XP boosts. Not everyone can see past a skinnerbox to complain about it, that's why games use them.
---
I never saw the fork knife subreddit as full of people who care. Subreddits are rarely filled with people who care. They get extremely defensive if you point out the flaws in the game and the continued push towards effortless building gameplay without adequate counter, and the community there is hardly harmonised given that X anonymous group shout and scream about *thing* being so overpowered they die when facing it, and when it's nerfed, Y anonymous group shout and scream about *thing* being so crappy they die now when using it. The subreddit isn't even in tune with the playerbase given the response to players unvaulting the drumgun.
---
You want me to attack players who want more skinnerbox? Well I have already argued against them here, and now you, but attack? That's quite a violent way to put it.
---
Comrade, attacking the proletariat for giving capitalist hard earned money in behavioural trap is counter productive, no? Should not just point out trap and remove, yes?
---
I don't know the people who spend awful amounts of money on behavioural traps, so I can't contact them and I can't tell if you're talking about proactive evangelism or *doing what I did here and telling someone who asked why battlepasses are bad and then responding to everyone else here when they said NUH UH by returning their NUH UH with another NUH UH.* The loot box behavioural trap got so bad it wound up being brought up in I believe it was Belgium for breaking gambling laws and EA had to backpedal in nuBattlefront 2, remember that?
---
Sorry, why should I go budge those people? They're making le epicc maymays for de updoots and aren't here for an argument and aren't arguing against me. If a battlepass comes out, it's not because of them, because they don't work at Behaviour making executive decisions. Try again to funnel me down your logic next time by giving me two false options that don't represent me, we have different minds.
---
Unfortunately, no.
---
No because some dailies require survivors to die from end game.
---
It gets really obvious sometimes and I just start teabagging the killer. I just saved a survivor, killer comes back, no avoiding that. Survivor runs away from killer, I get in between them right in killer's face to try and take a hit, killer just ignores me and goes for the injured survivor lol.

This game looks super trash, even for a mobile game. How can anyone play this and have fun?
---
Okay thanks for the reply. I doubt if it's real or it will be a successful port. 
---
We'll see though, you never know.
---
Yea that's fair, I be even ok if the free pass only gave 1 cosmetic item, while the pass has maybe 10, or even more for incentive to buy the pass.
---
I'm sorry you find SFM templates cringy u/THiccGrimes69
---
So you don‚Äôt want it because you‚Äôre afraid you won‚Äôt be ‚ÄúOG‚Äù and that will stress you out and because it will add challenges to the game which is good because it makes it so there is something to do when you have no daily rituals.

"A tier list is a list of playable characters or other elements of a video game, subjectively ranked by their respective viability in high-level competitive settings."

Doesn't matter if you play on console or PC, Nurse is always the best killer and will always be probably.
---
That's some bottom energy
---
&gt; you‚Äôre acting like most of the events arent pretty Grindy
---
I can only speak for the two events I've personally played, if they've all been grindy than that's even more reason we shouldn't expect the battlepass to be any different should it be released.
---
LOL She doesn't need nerfs.
---
But everyone wants individual 10$ skins apparently
---
Yeah OP clearly wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúOG‚Äù in fortnite and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs making him not want limited cosmetics they most likely are gonna add them back to the store

No need to be rude.... you said was so just assumed you were gonna say they suck
---
‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôd pay for it if the stuff was cool‚Äù I‚Äôm not saying the cosmetics in it are gonna suck
---
You‚Äôll never see me or any other good killers complain about gen-rushing. Playing the objective efficiently is how you win the game consistently, and complaining about the other part doing so is the very definition of whining. Unless the other part is literally cheating/glitching or abusing bugs, then it‚Äôs all a part of the game.

Hahaha I had this happen last night. Friend of mine and I were SWF with a random Ace and random Claudette. Claud taunted the Legion, got downed pretty much instantly for being overconfident, and then DC‚Äôed instantly. The  game had been going on maybe a minute. Ace got found right after but managed to lose him. INSISTED on having me heal him in the basement. (Literally why do people risk this?) I unfortunately got a shitty FPS (yay PS4!) INSTANT and therefore impossible skill check and failed it, resulting in us being found. Ace tried to hide in locker and wasn‚Äôt seen but the Legion didn‚Äôt follow me out and checked lockers and found himself he killed himself on hook before I could get to him and then messaged me and called me a stupid bitch. (I‚Äôm sorry man! But that skill-check was literally impossible. I seriously thought there was Lullaby for a split second.) 
---
The poor Legion. He had BBQ and brought a Party Streamers and now was denied two stacks of his BBQ and two full Sacrifices. It dawned on me that it meant he lost at least 2 chases won, 2-6 hooks, hunting, brutality, and deviousness points. And all that on top of his two stacks for BBQ. At least. When I came back out of the basement he was just coming back and we looked at each other for a moment. I originally was trying to joust/360 him to see if he would still play but he just shook his head and let us know he at least wanted to farm for a bit. My friend and I made sure to give that man max points, even if it meant we both died in the end. But he was super nice and let one of us live. It wasn‚Äôt until after that we realized he had BBQ so he never got a single stack for it. :( 
---
Possibly the nicest Legion player I‚Äôve ever met. And being on PS4 I‚Äôve met quite a few assholes playing Legion. (I‚Äôm talking extra toxic and literal cheaters)
---
Reminds me that yesterday i got cornered by a Leatherface and he blocked me for the entire game... Other survivors repaired gens then tried to help me before EGC but he downed no one even when he could have... It was double BP so i stayed, until i got killed by entity lol...
---
I mean unless she killer was signalling he wanted to farm you were kind of fine...
---
It‚Äôs the complete opposite for me. Ruin last the whole match so I‚Äôve just got to do gens and power through it.
---
Then don‚Äôt buy it....
---
I understand why some people stifle their chances of winning just to let the other part ¬´have fun¬ª, but it should not be expected at all. You‚Äôll never see me complain after being looped, it‚Äôs just a kudos to the survivors ability to run the loop and as long as they are not literally abusing the game‚Äôs glitches/mechanics then it‚Äôs all fair game mate.
---
How to play against him? DONT FUCKING DC AND MAYBE ACTUALLY TRY FOR ONCE INSTEAD OF BEING SELFISH. 
---
Also read the damn patch notes or at least watch gameplay video on YouTube. Ffs.

But if the unhooked survivor is within reach, and he's on last hook, so you can eliminate a survivor right there and then... isn't it just smart to tunnel him? Is tunneling always a bad thing? Survivor main here.
---
For it will happen when they're 2 thirds through the totem or just not at all
---
I have no plans on buying it, if you're trying to imply I shouldn't at least try to convince other people to consider doing the same based on Behavior's track record so far then I disagree with that.
---
Yer muh qwheen
---
It's not cross platform, the queues will be the same. Mobile queues will also likely be horrible, considering it's already bad on console, and kind of 'eh' on computers.
---
Consoles don't interact with the computer version of the game, so why would either be playing with Mobile users?
---
Noone said you were supposed to get every skin in the event tho
---
That's like, you know, fucking normal...
---
Truthfully what‚Äôs more satisfying than watching someone balanced landing right into one of your traps from two stories up?
---
The people who try for unsafe hooks hate bbq. My BBQ goes off and I dont see anyone that means everyone is on my ass why would I leave this spot immediately without looking around first. If you camp with bbq you're just dumb and probably not gonna get 4 stacks.
---
The game is a grind. It hasn‚Äôt changed since launch. Even though they have addressed the grind issues, it‚Äôs sad this community has no faith in them. Especially when the last year has been pretty decent.

I understand the bug problems because code languages are unfun at the best of times before you even touch an IDE or spaghetti code and I think they're doing okay on bugfixes (gen bloodpoints are fixed now, at least for me, though I'm still upset about territorial imperative given that should be an easy one too).
---
I'm more concerned about balance fixes. Delaying perks are still required for both sides at higher skill, matchmaking fails to match similar ranks and doesn't let you know so you can choose to wait longer, rank still doesn't describe skill, nurse still ignores half the game, shape/huntress/plague are still neutered by normal gameplay.

Not even 1 minute into the game, yet you already have three stacks of BBQ..? Seems like a different narrative than what you are leading with
---
Yikes, this could just kill the game if they do release it
---
Honestly spirit fury and grind for nurses both are great killer perks
---
If you don't think for a second BHVR will make the non-BP users life worse in some fashion in order to "encourage" people to buy it you're a damn fool. 
---
I feel like people have gone crazy. On one hand they'll tell us "LUL, it's just a leaked prototype, you don't even know anything about it!" and on the other "Obviously, it's just cosmetics, AND THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE IN THE SLIGHTEST"
---
Given DbD is already as grindy as a Korean MMORPG, and is a $20 game +$80 worth of DLC, we don't need a Battlepass. Especially since its existence will mean that the average user will suffer in some manner.
---
Sounds like a scene straight out of a triple A action movie
---
Opening the door is but door release is in survival.
---
You're just not TRYING HARD ENOUGH
---
No. I don't want it because of the reasons I listed above. I couldn't care less if people had something I didn't have if I didn't want it, but if there's an item I do want that's waaaay near the end of a pass that would stress me out. Being a completionist as well, once I start something I have a compulsive need to finish it. It's about other people having stuff, it's about the *need* to finish within a strict time limit.
---
We also don't even know if there are challenges yet, chances are it could just be a long and boring grind through a load of numbers (like Apex or Black Ops), or maybe there are challenges but they're simple things you would've done anyway. What I stated was the worst case example (the way Fortnite sometimes does it).
---
&gt; That's like, you know, fucking normal...
---
The fact that this is actually normalized in some games now is actually kinda worrying to me to be completely honest
---
^correct
---
you should hae shown his psn
---
Freddy, Wraith and Trapper are put too high.
---
I‚Äôm sure I have a couple thousand hours on PS4 but I just started playing on steam like 2 weeks ago and that‚Äôs the time they asked for. So I‚Äôm about 70 hours.
---
I‚Äôm all for it if they have challenges to help but if it doesn‚Äôt have any challenges we‚Äôll then it is a stupid idea
---
There are people that thinks this devs only eat air and water.
---
The issue is that the battlepass will take away from the rest of the game. I know everytime I say this I get the big brain Behavior white knights telling me "the people who design the battle pass don't also do balance pepega" but put bluntly as more focus is put on the battle pass more resources will be put towards it as more staff are hired to work on it and less staff and management time are put towards game balance.
---
Even from a face-value standpoint I'm fairly certain that a lot of cosmetic stuff the community has been asking for will end up religated to the Battle Pass. I know it's a massive meme to ask for shirtless Myers or swimsuit Kate but I could easily see either of those being placed as the level 100 Battle Pass tier.
---
And why can't i finish that one who is going to die earlier? It is more efficient than switching between targets, unless you have devour hope or need to get bbq stacks.
---
&gt;You'll never see me or any other good killers complain about gen-rushing.  
---
&gt;Any other good killers  
---
Have you literally never heard of Tru3, OP?  
---
There are plenty of good killers out there who get their panties in a bunch over survivors doing the objective, much like there are plenty of good survivors who get all uppity about getting focused down.  
---
Just because you don't cry about it, doesn't mean others don't.
---
"Hey, we see that bloodwebs and BP is already an awful grind as it is, you guys want ANOTHER grind to stack on top of that?"
---
What a stupid answer.
---
Don't tell me you *don't* want to default dance when you pallet stun the Killer.
---
Its plausible if its free and well done.
---
Hello there! Legion main here. That's a nice spirit you have. I love when both surviror and killer  play a fair game without being toxic. I believe in everyone's kindness. Yet i always fall on tea-bagging genrushers at rank 1-2 playing p-3 Claudettes and Ash William. Good luck you all :)
---
&gt; Even though they have addressed the grind issues, it‚Äôs sad this community has no faith in them.
---
Personally, I'd still consider the game to be an immense grind unless you main 1 killer but the reason I have no faith in them is because they consistently release updates where perks either don't work as they should, or a bug that should've been caught during the PTB still makes its way into the live build.
---
That's not even mentioning fixes for some of the bigger bugs like Legion's mend issue not coming out until the scheduled mid-season patch.
---
Open the link. "Release" is in Objectives category. Either wiki is incorrect or your info is wrong
---
They've shown to have a free version and a paid version, and the free version will come with some basic rewards. The beta shows that you unlock free rewards every 5 levels or so while the paid version gets items every level or every other level.
---
Game should be fun. When i don't enjoy game, i just turn off it. Now, i can DC without ban. When DCs was bannable, i killed myself on hook. Few seconds and you are out of game without ban.
---
Ultimately if everything is still available after the pass is over I'd be fine, best case scenario is that the pass is just an alternative way of unlocking the items that are already in the game/getting added to the store.
---
I don't dislike people who are pro battle pass, it's just a case of that model being detrimental to my mental health.
---
Even worse when you have borrowed time with it ;(
---
I‚Äôve never been hit by a bubbas chainsaw it‚Äôs easy to avoid if you stay by walls most bubbas are 4heads pig for life
---
It might have just been a first come first serve kind of thing
---
Sure, I shouldn‚Äôt have generalized the whole community in that way, my bad. My main point still stands however, complaining about the other side simply doing the objective to the best of their ability should not be looked down upon.
---
Not gamebreaking bugs you absolute tool. Because they had no way to fix them. It isn't about nostalgia it is about the business model of a game. There are many many examples out there.
---
You're immaturity and lack of understanding is clear. These are facts not opinions.
---
if it cost shards im all in. shards are pretty useless in my opinion right now I have like 80k
---
1% extra luck maxium KappaRoss. The only time I ever take them is when I'm running a farming build and absolutely don't care about the match.
---
I personally always die to Trappers, no matter what rank. That is why he is so high.
---
Wraith is doing fine on console. He finds chases easily and can have some map control.
---
Freddy is so high mainly cause of his garbage animations + higher ping on console making him hit stuff he shouldn't which can end chases fast. Also lots of ps4 players don't know how to play against him, making him a tat better on ps4.
---
I finished the season 4, 5 and 6 battlepass. By season 7 it felt like a chore and that's when I stopped playing.
---
This... This is what we need.
---
Gas Mask or Pumpkin Head Nurse. Slugged, tunneled and camped 100% of the time.
---
Huntress with the owl mask (I think that shit is an owl) is very likely to have a good aim with the hatchet no matter how tight the corner is.
---
Probably because it's such a big slap in the face from BHVR that it didn't seem possible.
---
Personally, I don't like them. Didn't need a Mobile game, and don't want a battle pass. It just really seems that BHVR's just following whatever makes other games money when we have problems that have existed for a little longer than a year still out there. Company's need money, sure. But it really seems like they jump on this stuff and take their time for other things.
---
Not really. Survivors can still do gens, collect items, heal each other. I'm not always successful with my plan either.
---
I don't see the whole play style as toxic either. It's my attempt at mind f*cking them and giving them the "ooooh shit" moment.
---
That was just a "ghost chainsaw". It is a bug that was supossed to be fixed long ago but here we are..
---
Survivors: *Teabag, click flashlight, point, run in front of the Killer.*
---
Killer: *Does their only job.*
---
Survivors: *DC*
---
Survivors in post game chat after they stick around for the whole match after DCing: *What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare...*
---
Maybe I have resilience and I don‚Äôt want to be healed
---
New killer: the teacher
---
Even then it proves that this bug is masked as a game.
---
...you realize he can't chase you down in Feral Frenzy anymore, right? When did you last play the game? 4 months ago?
---
In fork knife it's coupled alongside a no-confirmation-one-click-purchase impulse-purchase-before-it's-gone shop, which includes clockwork discounts for battlepass levels to remind you there's a way to pay for progress. The battlepass being to artificially inflate the reasons you want to stay in the game, because you're artificially invested due to the sunk cost "If I don't play, I don't get the rewards I paid for", is to increase your exposure to these advertisements of side purchases. In contrast, you have to explore DBD's UI to realise there's in game transactions.
---
Warframe is similar as it exposes you more to the game and the daily system, which both expose you more to *buy some plats!*
---
Each level in a battlepass is designed to trigger a chemical response, with better prizes for larger responses. *Wowzer I just got a trail, a skin, an XP boost, some Norabucks to buy one thing I want, an umbric forma and I unlocked more level than one this time too! That's so awesome!*
---
It might be less predatory, and without the real life legal concerns of gambling, but it's still predatory and has nothing to do with the game itself.
---
what I meant is that, if your truly tired from the game and want to take a 6 month break or something, you wouldnt care about what you missed out,
---
Noed in nurse = bad nurse

Ok so I‚Äôd never heard of horrorfield or identity V but wow both are such obvious knockoffs. At the same time I gotta give them some credit for actually having unique ideas that I‚Äôd love to see dbd steal right back like survivor specific traits and map interactive events. The game could use some spice, especially going forward.
---
If there is one person left some times I'll chase them for extra long or let them finish a gen if I'm not quite to them and I know they're close to finishing, but imo standing there and watching you do a whole gen while kicking it sounds worse than just staring a new game.  Half your xp comes from hooking everyone new once if you're  truely farming so just doing basic shit with 1 person is a waste of time other than chase which is easy and quick to max.

You just repeated the same thing with a couple more words added on, the point remains mute.

But alas, you can have your opinion and I can have mine
---
Happy surviving/hunting!
---
For the most part, I was fine with the store if it helped them pay for things to make the game better. I've been waiting for dedicated Servers since Myers came out.
---
I agree that skins honestly seem fairly priced, they're not required afterall, people who want them will pay for them. But the problem is, a lot of people \*don't\* want a battlepass, but the devs seem to be more or less shoving it onto us. In the recent survey they did, it was an option to say "Not interested", and while I can't personally see the result (Don't know how to) I've been led to assume a lot of people didn't want it. (Almost solely just based on Reddit's reaction.)
---
Just get all the rocket chairs to 99% and break them as the hunter comes to them so you won‚Äôt get the debuff to sabo speed.
---
I don't know man, I play both sides and tunneling feels like cheap shots as a killer and completely sucks the fun out of playing as a survivor. I can win a game without kicking survivors when they're down, and if I can't then gg nice game. I play for fun, so the people playing the game with me should be having fun too.
---
Not recommended. Either you think the survivor is closer than they are and slip up or you become reliant on it and waste a perk slot. Just turn your volume up if you can't hear right off the bat.
---
Yeah they go through hiccups.l, but it‚Äôs a 25 dollar game that clearly has brought people together bc they are passionate about the game. And even being upset is passion. Everyone wants the game to thrive. So how about we all wait and see what they bring to the table before trying to persuade people to not buy something. You gotta think how much money battlepasses take in. More money means more content and updates, and isn‚Äôt that what we all want?
---
Nah they're to expose you more frequently to the paid content. If it was to play more, it'd be new features.

---
here's mine, nurse/spirit/vommymommy/huntress in the top row, rest all the way at the bottom
---
I don‚Äôt think people want $10 skins but they‚Äôre okay with it because skins have very little effect on performance, especially when survivor‚Äôs most blended clothing is free. People don‚Äôt want a battle pass because then something that directly affects how the game is played is behind a pay wall.
---
this is me when i play mr krabs
---
We have literally just seen cosmetics from this, this is such an overreaction
---
Would you agree that a Nurse build with NOED is stronger than a build without it? Regardless of player's skill?
---
Yeah, I think deeper blue would be accused of being "yet another Blendette advantage" on MacMillan maps, but a frosty blue would maintain the same high visibility of existing legacy.
---
My Pig Bloodweb be like "[ruleset no2 noises](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bp5xeg/rmildlyinteresting/)"
---
Have you seen the players who complain about life getting in the way of earning the rewards?
---
Oh it's okay, if you don't have the time to get the level 100 skin you could just... pay epic for more battlepass levels... your choice.
---
iirc the survey BHVR did displayed that there was an overwhelming negative response to the idea of a battle pass. 
---
If the survey had no effect on this decision, why put it on the survey in the first place?
---
Not all of us love it, I still think many cosmetics are overpriced and they seem to have shifted their priorities towards making cosmetics than fixing the game.
---
interesting
---
Tier list based on TydeTyme :^)
---
On topic I can't wait for the comments from people who didn't read the title of the post.
---
Doesn't matter.  Gonna get accused of the shit either way.  Hell I got told I was "hard camping" yesterday for patrolling a hook, not because I was camping the hook, but because I had whispers and I kept hearing someone around it.  So I guess I'm just supposed to walk to the other end of the goddamn map every time I hook, despite the information available to me.
---
well, obviously he wasn't toxic enough to trigger this killer.... so he has to try harder
---
We already have Ashy Slashy. Adding teeth is not really worth charging for a new cosmetic.
---
Try not to run Predator or Stridor. Practice listening for the specific noises survivors make and memorize them. Soon enough you can tell if a surv is walking or running on wood, mud, concrete, etc.
---
Enduring isn't a requirement because usually you can play around the pallet for a hit. Never hurts to have though.
---
[Learn mindgames and phasing tricks.](https://youtu.be/7AG8v-5sszA)
---
That's totally your opinion. I definitely don't think the #2 killer in the game and #1 most unfun killer to verse needs any buffs though.
---
The devs of Identity V asked the dbd devs for approval before releasing the game, so it's fine. I'm not sure about horrorfield tho
---
Heyyyyy Jude
---
Any perk which relies on someone else for it to work is a no no for me
---
On PS4 I find killer matches within 20-40 seconds (rank 14 granted) and survivor usually takes about 5 mins+ (also 14 lol I'm not that great). It has been like this for a while on there, matchmaking was quick af when they had the estimated wait time thing but now it's long af. Idk how much rank affects matchmaking considering I'm pretty frequently paired with purple or red ranks.
---
She‚Äôs from scary movie not scream. As much as I would love to see this I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs even the slightest chance of this happening. Granted if it did happen I‚Äôd only want her if she came with voicelines like ash. She‚Äôd be hysterical in game
---
I understood that reference
---
Only problem it isnt a triple A game. Shits mediocre at best. But my point was the pass being free.
---
Not true.. I hardly run into clowns who use noed.
---
I know where she's from! And that's what I mean with a catchphrases...
---
Any killer with frosty eyes I automatically assume they're gonna be running noed.
---
Hey now I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs from but I‚Äôm assuming he rights belong to the scream franchise rather than the scary movie franchise, but still in speculation if it‚Äôs a paragraph or a chapter
---
And then they'd do worse for the one or more matches they're trying to do their side objectives. Fail to kill anyone at best, and bore survivors at worst. Derank. Then swap back to their main.
---
At best it'd just be the current end of match "I was trying to do a daily guys, gl hf in your next match", at worst it'd be "I paid for a battlepass... to do something that's unfun and loses me a match... and if I don't do it, I don't get rewarded"
---
BEFORE THE MATCH, MEG AND DWIGHT STATED THAT IF ANYONE RAGEQUITS THEY WILL REPORT US. THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO IDLE THE WHOLE GAME AND FIX 1 GENERATOR TOGETHER. 
---
EVEN WORSE, WHEN I STARTED WRITING A LONG-ASS PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE MESSAGE FOR THEM POST-GAME, THE KILLER DISCONNECTED.
---
Hard to say "regardless of player's skill" because a really good nurse will rarely reach the point of needing NOED, making it a wasted perk slot.
---
And a weak nurse is probably going to have their NOED totem taken out or only be able to capitalize on weak or extremely altruistic survivors.  
---
This is why I argue that NOED isn't that great and I don't understand why people bitch about it so much.
---
Well I need something new to watch whole I eat my linguine
---
Awwh thanks. Imma stream once this match is over. Just finsished a test stream
---
Always run MoM!! Such a fun perk!
---
I honestly don't even know what a battle pass is/does lmao. I do know people are fairly conflicted on it though ever since the survey
---
Its more about promoting selfish play to level your battle pass quicker.
---
Quite surprising that this sub doesnt get it when you guys created the most subjective honor code ever in the name of "but what about the survivors/killer fun?" and find the most low effort BMing to be tOxIc
---
But sure, keep thinking that its about cosmetic, behavior sure is happy to have you as a customer.
---
Even in the chase? I mean, killer will hit you (and injure again) anyway, but you can have extra chance if you instaheal yourself before the chase starts
---
It's the rule of dbd.
---
If you are the killer the totem will spown in the middle of an open field 10 feet away from all 4 survivors within line of sight while you spawn on the other side of the known universe
---
If you are a survivor the totem will spawn hidden in the most obscure and hard to find spot in the map and no one will ever see it untill 1 gen is left. It will be so hidden that even the killer will start to doubt its existence
---
*Buy*
---
Tru3 doesn't complain about this.
---
I hate to be the person to talk about slippery slopes but look at what happened to Doat 2 after they started doing their compendiums/battle passes. More and more shit got locked behind an increasingly egregious pay wall and the quality of the items and the game because of them have been in sharp decline. Just ignoring a problem isn't going to make it less of a problem. Going further than that, I'm also of the firm belief that microtransactions have no place in games that are not free to play.
---
Use all your bp offerings then prestige.
---
Honest question: are you able to see through the mask? I feel like Susie‚Äôs mask is scary but easily the least practical mask in the game.
---
No i didn't. Last killer i remember is clown. I had long break. I played few games, but i must study.
---
I feel you man, I play on Xbox and my ability to hit skill checks is completely up to the frames I‚Äôm getting in a given match.  When everything is going well and the needle moves around the circle smoothly I can hit 80-90% of great skill checks but when it starts stuttering around the circle I don‚Äôt even try a lot of the time.
---
Yup. This is a bug. False chainsaws are the worst.
---
That's a good thing tho, right?
---
Idk how it is for others, but for me that's essentially seeing my neighbourhood on fire but the street i need to go is completely fine. Yes I could just not worry because I don't need to go there but fam my neighbourhood is on fire.
---
Wraith is so underrated
---
I‚Äôve seen someone w a name like this and they did in fact get morid that round so good for them
---
Hex tabula is dumb.. why the hell would that be a thing? I cant use my perks? I'm good on that fam
---
Eh not really.
---
so they could bring in MoM so people buy the Ash DLC.. yeah..
---
This is the problem with survivors. They blame the killer for their poor play choices. Unsafe hook results in later getting downed again? They call it tunneling. Keep the killer closer to hook by remaining closer to it, they call it proxy/face/hard camping.
---
Oh, I see. My bad.
---
‚ÄúLow in sodium‚Äù 
---
Hold my beer.
---
Dude nothing better than when survivors give you no reason for leaving an area (BBQ not showing anybody, gen screwing themselves) and then they complain in end game about "camping at the end". Like i'm not gonna just fuck off to a random edge of the map for no reason dudes
---
no, cause thats not fun to go against and i dont do that kind of thing in most circumstances
---
Not even microtransactions that are not pay to win? Also, the battle pass has free items.
---
it should have hit - fast vault next time
---
Laughs in Trapper
---
I RUN IT SO THEY STOP STAYING STANDING LIKE 2 FEET AWAY WHILE THE KILLER IS FACECAMPING ME BECAUSE
---
Tier translator:
---
* DC as soon as they see the Killer / hear their power.
---
* DC as soon as they're hit by the Killer / their power. (The amount of people I've faced who DC as soon as they're slept by Freddy is uncanny.)
---
* DC on first down. (For Leatherface it's if they're taken to the basement. Pig it's kinda 50/50 - some people DC as soon as they get a bear trap others DC in the next tier when they're "tunneled" with a bear trap on.)
---
* DC if the Killer downs them a second time.
---
* DC on last hook ha ha gottem fuck my Bloodpoints amIright?
---
* No DCs but the Killer is needlessly flamed in post game chat for playing the game as intended
---
* No one DCs against them or flames them
---
* People try to get killed by them (to be honest Myers is a massive mixed bag and I've seen all parts of the DCer spectrum against him)
---
You were hit through the window
---
Yeah that fine, you where right next to the window.
---
Fix your pathing, better 180 and slow vault this window?????
---
This tier list is obviously wrong because I disagree with it /s
---
IRL, or serious lag issues despite solid green ping in the lobby.
---
By "serious lag issues," I'm not talking about one instance of lag where I'm repairing a gen and get no progress on it, or snapping backwards once, because I understand shit happens. I'm talking, for example, literal teleporting across the map in defiance of what you could even get with Iron Grasp &amp; Agitation combined before someone would wiggle out.
---
üòÇ what
---
Your reaction is aids
---
/s = sarcasm
---
üòÇüòÇ ok
---
Honestly the problem isn't the battlepass itself, it's just the monetization for sake of monetization while at the same time the devs left the game broken for 5 months and pushed out 1 1/2 DLCs alongside stupid events and overpriced, bad looking cosmetics.
---
In the update changelog from a few days ago they mentioned fixing a bug causing infinite loading being fixed now, but I am not sure if infinites are fixed for good now or if that was a separate cause for those loading screens.
---
DbD's dead and it died the moment Starbreeze sold the rights back to BHVR. Starbreeze is a shitty and incompetent company too, but at least from what I've experienced with the game everything went to shit after they got all rights back.
---
Game hasn't evolved at all in 3 years, basic features (proper graphic options, separate audio volumes, dedicated servers/good netcode) aren't a thing still and the game's just been going downhill  or no not even that, it's just been sitting at the bottom of the pit, doing nothing.
---
The Bloodweb exists.
---
Nothing with a grind that Behavior makes isn't needlessly grindy.
---
Yo you're lame af!! Youre gonna camp and tunnel because someone runs a certain perk... 
---
Git gud scrub.
---
If you‚Äôre the average player you should‚Äôve gotten at least 1 maybe 2 skins from the moonrise event, not that grindy.  The battlepass is gonna be 3 months long I think the average player can get to the final tier without spending their life on the game
---
I play both sides, and I've been actually face camped before and that shit is vastly different.  But I don't get pissed off because I'm thinking "well rest of my team is doing gens while you're standing here like a dumb shit." 
---
People just look for reasons to be salty, I try not to let it get to me.  There are way more toxic game communities than this one out there
---
Holy crap, why haven't they done this? That's a great solution to the shitty RNG of hooks in DBD.
---
Legion, Doctor, and Nightmare need to be top imo
---
2018 Myers is my FAVORITE figure I own.
---
So much love.
---
You should have put on Small Game, ayyy SMALL GAME GANG RISE UP
---
It's possible that we won't get a survivor and a map at all
---
Dude so you dont use any aura reading perks as kille because if you do nobody likes you.
---
Premium does literally nothing you genius. Premium, was it actually called that? Pretty sure it was something else, but anyway was given to you when you registered your phone number with your Steam account and allowed access to better(TM) matchmaking. People always got random skin drops after leveling up and randomly through the week.
---
I have a clip of the same thing happening on ash
---
I prefer Balanced Landing over Dead Hard for this reason. DH works once in a match against a good killer
---
Small aside, you probably went down a tangent with him that avoided the main point of games having planned, ongoing lifecycles nowadays.
---
What games used to be doesn't matter when the concern is what games are today, and their argument is flawed regardless. Updates always existed, especially for client-server games the dev hosted and DLC was called an expansion pack. Gamebreaking bugs are a laff *looks at every Bethesda game, including Fallout 76,* especially when they have nothing to do with planned content.
---
So 2 killers?
---
Prime* had nothing to do with items, it was purely for matchmaking and a little icon in your CS:GO player profile.
---
It depends
---
Doesn't sound like something he would do (normally) tbh. Probably a bad day or an impersonator.
---
As a survivor I have been dealing with so many DC's its really annoying I hope they do something to fix this.
---
I run the same thing with Spirit a lot.  It is a gamble, but when it works it feels pretty nice.
---
Yea! And the next licensed killer can be that tire from a movie called Rubber. Or Blackula or a killer cookie from the movie Gingerdead Man.
---
yeah you're right lol
---
DCing is becoming the norm.
---
"good skins can be acquired with far lower costs than just outright buying all of them"
---
It takes an hour to just earn 245 shards and that is the best case scenario. If you want a full "very rare" outfit, that's roughly 100 hours worth of playtime if not more since the 245 shards/h isn't realistic to pull off in the long run, especially for killers.
---
You earn ten cents an hour.
---
Too real.
---
Also when you play survivor, your teammates are potatoes who are busy just staring at nothing while you are looping the killer and lets you die on the hook, while when you are the killer, the survivors power through each gen, hitting every single great skillcheck and all 4 leaving.
---
This made me laugh way harder than it should have.
---
Well put.
---
hot dog?
---
That's exactly my point
---
Prime were the only method to reduce hackers and noob, it helped
---
But now it's something can easily be obtained just by pull out your wallet
---
Also the badge implied that the game doesn't give a shit about players who bought and supported this game
---
So clearly this killer can be reported for their hateful speech towadrs a claudette with korean username. They tunneled the claudette for the whole match and bm'ed her on hook. I know tunneling off hook is a strategy but shouldn't this kind of tunneling be considered bannable?
---
Did you even watch the leaked footage of the BP lol, I really think you need a break from Fortnite
---
They can now .
---
Personally, I use BBQ, Nurse‚Äôs, enduring, and then leave the last for whatever I‚Äôd like.
---
The first two give you good aura reading, while the last helps negate pallets and DS users.
---
Monitor and Abuse might work well with it, seeing as T1 Myers can sneak up on people pretty well.
---
your putting shame on pigs name
---
It‚Äôs actually pathetic tbh, I always laugh at a killer that shakes his head or hits me on the hook after a long chase, like you have nothing to be proud of.
---
And when I play killer I always shake my head a guy that t-bagged and died seconds later
---
Nope.
---
Blood web all the way BB.
---
HERESY
---
Okay then. Show me a battlepass done right if you don't want me to point at the biggest example of it done to the player's disadvantage. Or is your perspective empty and without precedent?
---
Show me I said fork knife bad, therefore battlepass bad. I said battlepass bad.
---
What's wrong with cosmetics? You think "I hate thing" -&gt; "I love thing" applies to battlepasses? There are people who still hate battlepasses and it's been, what, *over a year later now?*
---
Crybabies? Try to grow up. Whoever said it's the end of DBD? Oh I'm sorry, do you have no points to make besides insults and vague bu bu bu ur wrong, lol.
---
If you based this tier list on PERSONAL experience then shouldn‚Äôt the nurse be F- tier?
---
Dont play her until you can more points into her and get better perks.. that build is awful.. noed is your first perks spot. Smdh...
---
and you're less likely to have any friends omegalul
---
Then share it, matey, or your point is as empty as telling me to take a break from another game.
---
I can see the exact scenario lmao.
---
You're on Ironworks, all gens are done and you've had a piss poor game so no one's been hooked. He drops the pallet next to the Ironloop window, you Spirit Fury it, he jumps through the window, gets NOED'd, you hook him, someone tries to hook bomb but opens the hatch instead, which you close, then camp him to death while the Collapse happens.
---
The killer's profile name literally means "kill all koreans" in simplified chinese. Are they really not bannable for tunneling merely because tunneling is not a reportable offense?
---
"if it means I get good solid content out of it"
---
"But a game like DbD is going quite well with the direction its been taking"
---
"Patches fix stuff, add new skins, new content"
---
1. There's no "good" content, it's copy paste characters for $7.99 and 1 new map every 3 months that's basically just a flat rectangle with 1 big building placed in the middle and some smaller debris randomly placed throughout the level.
---
2. It's not, DbD's been going down the shitter, the toilet, for the past 6 months if not longer than that.
---
3. What fixes? Legion's update broke loading screens (the devs were aware of it too) and they failed to fix it for a total of FIVE months, that's 150+ days of it being broken. The changelog from a few days ago mentions another "fix" for said problem, but I have yet to play enough DbD to find out if it's actually fixed or not. And once again, most of the skins look ugly/are badly made and/or are overpriced and besides new maps there really isn't any content to speak of. If you have less than 12 months of experience do not talk about BHVR or their direction for this game.
---
Why not? I like this addon, but I don't play Piggy really often
---
I keep getting Lery's and Game offerings on my Hillbilly.
---
Yeah, no.
---
DbD isn't popular, but it's still bad.
---
3 killers total.
---
Me as Freddy, a Trapper and a Huntress. And then 2 survivors.
---
"pass's"
---
The plural for pass is passes, please learn English.
---
As long as you get the "Killer Grasp Escape" points, you should be good.
---
Those teachables all work really well on Myers.  Unfortunately Ruin is almost a necessity at higher ranks otherwise you get gen-rushed to all hell
---
Now if you're looking for builds that are good and don't need add-ons but you'll need to buy the teachables, Enduring and Spirit Fury are an amazing combo for pretty much every killer.  Enduring you'd have to get from Billy but Spirit Fury is in the Shrine rn so save up 2k shards and you can buy it for use :)  
---
Hell, Spirit Fury is good even without Enduring, but with it is just a god-send
---
Happy killing!
---
I can play Nurse at red ranks
---
Only in the bloodweb. Thats the grind of this game.
---
Nah. The only battle pass I ever bought was for TF2 around jungle inferno. It was more stressful trying to finish it than it was rewarding.
---
&gt;Wraith who knows how to bodyblock not A Tier.
---
How the fuck? Dude I spend my shard on the shrine
---
I had 3 people dc on their first down playing wraith yesterday
---
If you use Enduring, you might as well equip Spirit Fury.
---
Any Huntress that wears the Halloween axe, kitty mask + robe. It‚Äôs always a tough game.
---
Well not, but the grind is indeed insane in DbD. Playing For Honor felt like a fresh air to me, you can obtain all the characters you want pretty fast just by playing 1.5h per day
---
the few times I tried a build like this ended up with most of my perks not being used, or having such bad coordination with other survivors it didn't matter and we all still died because of potatoes.
---
I would actually play freddy if it was the original freddy.
---
There's a plain kimono available for shards.
---
the shrine is useless to me since I have everything unlocked on my survivor I do not need the extra points honestly lol
---
What about killers?
---
I just assume they have NOED so i don't end up with the ded slap
---
Meanwhile, no Lery's and Game offerings on Myers after like 20 levels
---
That's fair
---
Just FYI, prime didn't really work lol. It might've in the very beginning when it was new and people didn't know about it, but prepaid sim cards are VERY cheap and people who have multiple copies of CS:GO and paid for cheats will not care a lot about spending some extra money for a few sim cards.
---
Also I wasn't talking about the proper badge, just about the original icon on your profile, it was like the achievement icons on your player card ingame and around your name if you were in a party.
---
got the shit I need on the 3 of them as well
---
You are a mean person
---
The way I play Myres is with Enduring + Spirit Fury, BBQ, and Ruin.  
---
If you prefer a stealthier experience, I'd recommend BBQ, Ruin, M&amp;A, Whispers/Brutal Strength.  
---
You can just use Dead Rabbit on the first build, but that's an add-on.
---
How dare you put mommy Huntress at D tier!!!!!111!!1!11!!!!!
---
Why?
---
Oh okay
---
Wraith without add-ons is pretty fucking weak
---
Yup, whenever I get MacMillan Estate I have thoughts like "finally not a shit map"
---
ya I play a lot honestly ha
---
the remake sucks
---
Because of the second floor windows that create infinite loops, especially if the surv has Balanced Landing.
---
The salt and tryhard levels would be insane
---
Peasants teabag the Killer at Exit Gates.
---
Refined men make them watch as they Kasotsky Kick their way through it.
---
Funny how the bad shit always happens to you regardless if you are playing killer or survivor. Maybe speak to your ISP sounds like you are getting some packet loss. 
---
Keep in mind that 99.9% of people playing aren't seeing this shit lol
---
Honestly I got 7 really funny cosmetic pieces on that event without much grind and paying zero cash, while in old events I always had one interesting cosmetic piece and one boring, and that's all. And I agree that Moonrise was designed intentionally in such a way so you got little chance of getting everything, but yet again man, it's 7 vs. 2. I'm pretty sure people like Monto or No0b3 got all 9 without paying anything.
---
Yes games should be fun. By acting the way you do, you remove that fun from everyone else involved. If you don‚Äôt enjoy the game, don‚Äôt play it. You‚Äôre not going to win or perfectly enjoy everything you play. You are a delusional and selfish person. It‚Äôs people like you that are completely ruining this game. So thanks for that.
---
They said it was fixed so it's fixed :)  
---
Seriously though, all they did was increase the hitbox of the chainsaw and call it a day.
---
nah typically people DC the second they get grabbed if there's a tombstone
---
Can't wait for Ebony Mori every match!
---
Nurse and spirit are the best killers in the game and hag is pretty close
---
I love how everyone is telling you how wrong this is when you literally said in the title that it‚Äôs based on YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
---
Mods for this sub suck.
---
One down. To many left to go.
---
Yeah but the idea is doing this daily and I kinda already did that yesterday. Oof
---
I mean, only if you try to bait hits with it which will only work one time as you said. Properly used one should use Dead Hard to reach a vault/pallet to continue a loop safely.
---
My build when I don't use super rare addons: BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Infectious Fright
---
I never use Nurse's on Myers since I always try to hit them in EW3.  Enduring + Spirit Fury is great to eat those pallets faster. Infectious Fright is also cool to quickly down an other survivor after downing one. If you don't have these teachables yet, I recommend to get them first for Myers.
---
We need a Nemesis killer whose terror radius is him muttering "Staaaarsss"
---
I wish I could spawn with 3 stacks of bbq too.
---
what about bond, you know where everyone is and you can do gens together. Anything else is also a no for me
---
Thank you!
---
Have you considered playing a different game for some time? Play civilizations it's a good game.
---
The chances that all 3 survivors sat in a locker are much lower than the chances of one of them just being near me. Obviously I dont mean hard camp until they die, but if you see no auras it's a safer bet to sweep around the hook than assume all 3 people hopped into a locker.
---
I rather run 5 meters away behind an obstacle, so i can hide AND heal.
---
The Molten lava huntress. Scares the DOGSHIT out of me
---
Who says he'd have to have those ranged attacks available to him at all times? He could have a stalking requirement to unlock them, or they could have limited ammunition that has to be replenished trapper trap style so that there's only a handful of "shots" spread across the entire map etc.
---
Walk up to door. Smapp the door. Try not to cry. Cry a lot
---
There is nothing free about it lol. It's a way for them to bundle stuff together and make you feel like it's a deal.
---
So Monitor because your terror radius is zero and still will be reduced in tier 2 and tier 3. Enduring and spirit fury just to tank pallets. STBFL its just for fast recover when hitting people and its great for an immediate second hit after a spirit fury.
---
Wait, you can see other people's add-ons?
---
I'm always dead when I play as a survivor. Don't like it:-)
---
Thanks man! Really appreciate it
---
This is why I love bloodwarden, it punishes survivors what don't leave and just want to move the killer in the face. Best part is the realization they fked up and the chat after the game.
---
"that face when when" sorry.
---
But awesome Cosplay
---
I basically consider his existence in DbD to be ‚Äúseason 4‚Äù. But yeah, it‚Äôs SUPER depressing. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it‚Äôs one of my favorite shows of all-time.
---
Exept that ID V is actually a good game
---
the grind is real(/intensifies)
---
Doctor and freedy are fun to play once you know how to ise them.
---
Pudding + 4 BBQ stacks + 32k BPs earned
---
[the grind is real](/intensifies)
---
&gt; I can‚Äôt use my perks
---
Let me introduce you to hex perks being destroyed within the first 10 seconds of the match
---
I always double when when I get mori'ed.
---
Not to be that bitch i was a Prestige 3 doctor on my old account on ps4 but i no longer play him because he is a cunt to play against.
---
Doc and hag are free in console but not pc
---
Honestly I think behavior dropped the ball a bit here, if instead of a "Battle pass" They had called it a "seasonal outfits package" or "Fashion pass" so its clear from the name its mostly a cosmetics package instead of using the term  "Battle pass" which many people automatically assume as a premium fast pass that gives players paying a HUGE advantage in the game over people not paying for it, people wouldn't have jumped at them like this.  
---
Cosmetics shmetics, if people care about looking like a rave party fashion disaster and a big bright  flag for the killer to kill and dont mind throwing cash at it go ahead, I will certainly enjoy the servers you are funding and the distraction you provide.
---
Well, always run M+A on Myers, ruin and BBQ are pretty much good on all killers. Enduring or Light/Shadowborn can be useful on Myers if you wanna invest some points into Billy or Wraith.
---
local man can't read -- will never have any friends
---
 It I want to have fun why should other people‚Äôs enjoyment matter to me
---
For me it's usually either p3 Claudettes, blue-haired fengs, and pink-haired Neas as usually they bring out flashlights, and become the most toxic players in dbd. I know not all do this, but most people do
---
I feel the doctor gets a bad rap people just dc against the guy, the devs wont delete him so there's no point. But i understand OP.
---
I'm a clown who uses NOED lol
---
Haha true tbh
---
*scrolls to find GlenOck*
---
Yeah, cuz there‚Äôs totally not a ‚ÄúFree Track‚Äù shown in the leak with FREE cosmetics, bp and shards
---
That's fucking hilarious.
---
Your money, do what you want.
---
Ahh yeah that's hot.
---
What? I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs a free part of the battle pass
---
What kinda dumbass survivor
---
So considering all you just did is reiterate your original points in a different manner, it's obvious you're just looking for some kind of circle-jerk and not a meaningful conversation.
---
No point in arguing about something that doesn't matter anyway. Hope you have a good day.
---
Do you have to buy the battle pass to get the free stuff?

---
sprint burst and balanced landing arent even compatible since you will never be able to get both to go off
---
No, there‚Äôs free stuff without buying the pass, did you watch the leak?
---
&gt; you can counter it quite easily
---
no.
---
whatever you do it's going to have an impact : you hide the killer camp and your teamate might get one or two hooked, you don't hide the killer know where to go and don't waste time after hooking someone.
---
What is with the entitlement here?
---
Wait what????? I‚Äôm super exited for the battle pass stfu reddit. It‚Äôs a good idea that would give progression to the game and you could help the devs
---
What?
---
A streamer said it, IT MUST BE TRUE!!!!
---
I don't trust leaks.
---
It's like you're explaining the joke but it didn't even need explaining and why did you even make this post? Also Legion sees the most insta-DCs of any killer, your tier list is wrong.
---
Probably a meme build if not they‚Äôre pretty dumb
---
My favorite build in the game. Everyone seems to have a blast with it. I don‚Äôt even go for kills, I go for the lulz. Always end up making a ton of BPs regardless.
---
Every now and then I‚Äôll get a super fun SWF that will play hide and seek with. It‚Äôs a damn blast.
---
If a killer leaves before your character can move at Haddonfield it's probably an experienced player who knows he's not in for a good time, no matter how good or bad the survivors are, so there's that.
---
For example, ZubatLEL is one of the best killers in DBD and he doesn't play on that map
---
I have no idea why they had Sprint Burst 1 on top of Balanced Landing 3 and Dead Hard 2. Running both Balanced and Dead Hard I kinda get but I am beyond confused about the inclusion of Sprint Burst.
---
At least they had Streetwise?
---
They hated him cause he spoke the truth
---
I love you because you‚Äòre a huntress main.
---
What's wrong with you? You should get a therapist.
---
Then why even discuss the leaks?
---
I hope it does not go F2P anytime soon, that makes it very easy for cheaters and hackers to keep coming back at it without at least taking a hit to their wallet each time the get dunked.
---
THe game is already cheap enough specially when there is a sale.
---
Love you too bbyüòò
---
Hijacking this comment to clear out something, it was indeed very early on the game i got lucky finding the first  surv, which i hooked then the others swarmed to unhook leading to 2 more hooks on the same spot, then i chased the one that was unhooked (That meg at the start). I saw other scratch marks and since i didn't want to tunnel and i had a significant advantage so early i went for claudete which unhooked meg and was taunting me. All this happened before the 2 mins for sure, maybe even before the 1.30 mark hence there is no gen done.  I would edit the title if i could, but i cant. The "not even 1 minute thing" is more a "not even after the first chase" or "not even reaching the mid-game" i think that you get the idea.
---
Now do one based on feet
---
Wouldnt even need the addon, those perks combined wouldve deleted eachother
---
I play a lot of Billy, this is pretty common. I guess from the other comments it's a bug. It's not a game-ruiner though, it happens infrequently enough that it's not going to de-rank you or anything. Careful though, sometimes it's actually a perfectly timed Dead Hard (obviously not in this clip though).
---
Also swap Ruin with Whispers. You're welcome.
---
Not really. You got what you paid for, period. It's still BHVR's game and they can take it in whatever direction they want. This statement is literally pure entitlement lol
---
I had a balanced landing/Sprint burst Nea in my game. And she was completely serious about it. She was around rank 15 , i think?
---
Omg... I WANT  THE OLD MAN MYERS MASK!!!!
---
Lazy boi
---
ruin is overkill on Billy. if you want a 4k at 5 gens every game and no real game use ruin on Billy. it's not needed at all if you're capable of applying pressure.
---
Yes, but that does not matter
---
What would the game be if we didn't support it? You are definitely kidding yourself if you think it would be as successful as it is right now.
---
No, it would be just you and your brother. You can do Survive with Friends and both be survivors, that will fill a match with other players.
---
Not including post game, max 32k, as I said, like how each category is capped to 8k ingame,
---
Fun fact - two seconds after this video, my PS4 fan finally achieved vertical life and flew around the room for 45 minutes.
---
This is why I cant play killer. If you just stand there I'll feel bad and let you farm.
---
Yeah but I'm not very good at Billy yet, so I need the time
---
I like a good spirit match, mindgames are always fun
---
Please don‚Äôt.
---
I agree. Adepts should also be for 4Ks as well, especially b/c of the shitty new pipping system making it nigh-impossible to double pip at the higher rabks
---
So does Dota's. It's just eroded the quality of the game. And no, not even non pay to win microtransactions. If they did costume packs, that'd be fine as it's more skin to buying a level pack or some other sort of small scale dlc which is fine in a non $60 game imo. But a store front with it's own fake money to mask exorbitant prices is too far, and the whole concept of a battle pass is just pushing that envelope further.
---
That's in your opinion, in my opinion the remake was good and Jackie was an awesome freddy
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. If you add a totem counter to small game you're not buffing solo players and getting them closer to SWF, because SWF teams don't need to equip that perk in the first place and can swap it with something actually useful.
---
The totem counter should just be default for all players.
---
I love when you‚Äôre at a jungle gym and they start weaving back and forth, the hat‚Äôs tail makes me laugh everytime
---
I run BT and We'll make it, a Med Kit and play the Rescue bitch,when I want to farm BP with survivor. You should use all your BP offerings. Only doing gens or only juking will let you depip sometimes and you won't get any BP. I also recommend killer. You even get more BP than a survivor,when you get no kill sometimes.
---
I finally maxed out my P3 Meg and I can tell you wait for a Bloodpoint event. I prestiged 3 chars,while the last one was running.
---
How is playing a bad meme build for fun toxic? How about telling people that they are ruining the game/community by playing with certain perks instead of bringing it up to the devs?
---
I have to assume you're just pandering for karma.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about Billy &amp; Spirit
---
What‚Äôs your rank btw? By the sound of it you play like a solid 15
---
‚ÄúFaggot camper‚Äù what ?
---
Don't feed the trolls, man.
---
You realize spirit has the 2nd hardest learning curve in the game?

I want the deadite looking Ash from the Evil Dead 2.
---
Yeah no I agree with you on that. But my point remains that you got what you paid for, and you played that, and your entitlement ends there. You have no, and shouldn't have any, sway on what BHVR intends to do down the line. If it's actually a mistake, then they'll suffer for it. However, they have the data, and I'm sure they know what's best for them.
---
It certainly USED to go off multiple times, but they broke Territorial Imperative in the last patch, so they may well have broken TOTH, too.
---
F
---
Irony is BHVR is behind Identity V
---
I think the Michael got it from Trick Or Treat Studios!
---
For me personally. It's not just a $10 battle pass. It's 10$ to spend untold amounts of time that I do not have to maybe be able to get a skin I want. I work! I have things to do! I dont have the time to grind out a limited time thing that I spent money on. Just give me my stuff!
---
Got me, internet grammar police.
---
R
---
you can say "no u", but it doesnt change anything about you
---
Remember pubg? The mobile game was infinitely more optimized than the original versions kf the game because it was ported by tencent. It's very possible we could see a similar situation.
---
The worst part is that you face a swf group and a red rank survivor, but you still didn't get rewarded. Honestly I feel bad for you
---
Have you ever seen a face camper with 4K?
---
Honestly has to be p3 Myers or any bought cosmetic on legion or trapper. Every time I see it and I know I got a paid skin for survivors associated with toxicity I think Fuck.
---
The buckle up perk and Flip flop are trash perks. You can never use flip flop unless the killer is slugging or you get that toxic Claudette who comes in clicking her flashlight and that‚Äôs a 50-50 if he goes after her and buckle up has no purpose since I‚Äôm going to just start getting teammates up unless they haven‚Äôt healed for long then I‚Äôm gone if killer shows, that‚Äôs easy enough to figure out and like 99% of the games the killer picks them right up after the hit! Also with flip flop if you do get it to full recovery for the 50% wiggle meter filled in there is a hook almost right next to you!
---
Wraith free jump scares/gen grabs with ghost soot get about 3 a match :)
---
ruin won't help you getting good with billy. you shouldn't have to rely on ruin to do good. learn to play without ruin because it forces you to apply pressure.
---
But you don't disagree. That's all I needed to know :)
---
Hell yeah man. I have an alternate account on xbox where I do more or less the same thing. Only difference is sometimes I run into the toxic p3 claudette who is rank 15 constantly bagging and clicking their flashlight. I just make sure to put them in their place lol
---
I never said you can't voice your opinion, only that it was a pretty entitled opinion. The entire game industry is rife with that kind of attitude these days, and 9 times out of 10, if the community made all the decisions, it's turn whatever game they were playing into a giant mess. But, it's the culture weve cultivated.
---
So you have a problem with them adding something new to the game? For me it‚Äôs a new challenge so I am gonna buy it if it‚Äôs less than $10
---
If only there where mods on this subreddit to do something about these reposts.....

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7g18co/how_i_imagine_killers_at_the_end_of_a_trial/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

So you went off on a multi paragraph tirade without looking at the information everyone is talking about?
---
True brilliance, here you go I googled it for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmj5ShlGOhA
---
I actually tried that, not as viable, in that game at least, because there are just so many hooks that are close by and the fact killer runs faster than you.
---
You're welcome fam.
---
Imagine getting downvoted for a fact. For honor gives you 800 steel daily virtually for little more than logging in, and the same again as missions every 2-3 days (requires more playtime), with the latest released hero costing 15k and older ones beim cheaper.
---
Freddy. Just Freddy.
---
Seriously though, i killed myself on hook vs every pre-rework Legion. Reworked/nerfed Legion ain't bad at all, just a bit boring.
---
As a heavy For Honor player, 1.5 hours per day to get *all* the characters would take *months*.
---
How?

D
---
When you blinked at the meg with mom and ds active
---
Anyone can p3 a Survivor but you have to truly like a killer to p3 them, so for me when I see a p3 killer I know it's gonna be a bad time.
---
I like that.
---
100% agreed. His only good perk is Mettle of Man, which is actually amazing, but it‚Äôs probably about to get nerfed. :(
---
But you also have to consider how hard it‚Äôll be to actually 360
---
Does Mettle of Man activate while under the Deep Wounds of Borrowed Time?

Happened to me in a random match, while i was killer. Loaded in with 2 survivors, and 2 other killers.  
---
Screenshot above on my other comment.
---
literally right at you said that i ran into a guy with his youtube handle in his name and he was smurfing at rank 20. I killed him first. You'd be surprised how many there are man its gross.
---
What's BPS?
---
I can‚Äôt imagine they did it themselves, they had to have hired a third party like pubg mobile did
---
Um, i can't read that language...what does it say?
---
Congrats! This is an impressive accomplishment no matter what your time played is
---
You can't tell people to grow up when you type like an 8 year old meme addict! Just sounds silly honestly. 
---
BattlePasses have been around since the concept was created by Valve back in 2013 with Dota 2 and have been done pretty successfully throughout Dota 2, TF2, Rocket League, PUBG and Fortnite. 
---
The fact that you went on this massive comment spree without actually seeing the source footage just proves how ignorant you are. You can't be the guy with all the facts when you are also the guy with none of the facts. 
---
So lets think, what are you basing your opinions on? Oh right yeah you mentioned it 500 times, Fortnite. Cool, I guess.
---
That would be so cool. I also want Asylum Ash from the tv show.

The aura reading is nice but yeah I literally use it for double BP as long as I‚Äôm not complete garbage

Thank you, I‚Äôm excited to ruin it

You're either an Xbox player then or you barely play DbD to begin with, because the longest I ever went without getting one myself was maybe.. 4 or 5 hours? And that happened maybe twice in the past 5 months. Usually infinites will happen every 5-15 matches and ofc 3man games, which aren't a thing anymore now, would happen way more often.
---
Also copy pasted in the sense of all survivors are just skins and nothing more and even the killers in the end are just copy pastes. Sure special powers I guess but they all have an M1 attack and I have no doubt in my mind they have a template for this sorta stuff where they just add new things to it depending on what's the killer's power and such. What I am trying to say is, DLC "content" for 7.99 which included 1 survivor skin and 1, usually not fun to play as/against, killer isn't really content.
---
No actually but we can bend reality for a little for the sake of the meme.
---
Lol fair enough.
---
This right here, this is exactly what I do.
---
Post game chat is annoying. That‚Äôs stuff you share with friends so they can all go ‚Äúlol wow what a dumbass‚Äù with you.
---
Follow your categories. Ensure you hook every survivor 3 times (no camping or you screw yourself) for sacrifice, get in many chases and win them for hunting, land many swings for brutality, use your ability a lot for deviousness. use bbq and chili and a survivor pudding/party streamers. maybe message the survivors and ask them to use party streamers. Boom max points
---
side not: if you're using a killer who doesn't get good deviousness gains bring distressing. deviousness will max out by the time your halfway through the game
---
Salty postgame chats are the most pointless crap ever. Unless its really interesting or raises a discussion. But someone sending a salty message is just pointless
---
goddamn boi the fanart was right david is kate's savior and \*possibly\* lover
---
Should I be trusting Behaviour to make a battlepass that isn't grindy?
---
Always remember BHVR is still a company with a product trying to sell you more things for their product.
---
They've done a lot of awesome things and brought things forward but they still want your money at the end of the day. They'll do what that can to find the balance between giving the community what it wants/needs to keep growing while still getting extra money from you.
---
GOTTA GO FAAAAAAAASSSSST.
---
Fucking sprint burst every time. Lol
---
I will say Identity V is actually a pretty good game. Every character has unique effects and such, even the survivors. One heals much faster and can self heal, one can send out an owl and if they time it right they can negate damage, one is blind but taps a cane on the floor for a radar like effect. Its balanced pretty well, and its played on dedicated servers. They also have 2 killers/ 8 survivors mode, and its actually balanced that mode pretty well as well.
---
Right. Did you have anything to say to my post though? Or did you just make the same mistake again where you imply it's the community's job to balance the game for the devs by just avoiding playing the game any way they want?
---
I posted it to created discussion lol it is pointless it happened and now it‚Äôs over but I‚Äôd still like to have a discussion about it. Not just about the salt but also about people DCing
---
He speaks for the trees!
---
No Urban. I like. A survivor that plays the game :)
---
post game chat posts are redundent and pointless.
---
like for real, everyone has experienced it, nobody cares.
---
You trust who you want, that's not up to me to tell you. But an opinion and a fact are two different things, people need to stop trying to pass off opinions as facts
---
Read the rules. Mods have a life too, they can't sit here and remove all the garbage as fast as it comes in.
---
Pig feet pls.
---
Youd think that but at R15 survivors throw themselves for BPs ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
The guy will be captured cause even this meme is killer sided
---
99% of postgame chats are pointless filler everyone has seen at one point or other, no one cares if some guy bitched about how you played
---
give me the plant
---
I dont bing bong like that:(... Ill stand by a gen tho :))
---
The Problem is the Entity is more fed from torture than from simple kills, therefore a wipeout doesnt satisfy the Entity completely lorewise.
---
He‚Äôs showing you love ‚ù§Ô∏è accept it
---
How the...
---
The fact that anyone considers this game to have any actual tournament potential is so laughable that it's almost depressing
---
PLAYING KILLER IS FUCKING SCARY AND ANXIETY INDUCING BUT I LOVE BEING THE KILLER. ALSO WELL AWARE IT IS THURSDAY üò§
---
I could totally see an old fashioned catholic school nun with a ruler weapon as a killer
---
That last one is pretty accurate
---
 &gt; If the killer is...also running Iron Maiden
---
It is killer sided though isn't? I believe they released a chart where the escape rate at higher ranks was way below 50%
---
You replaced his power glove with the infinity gauntlet? Why would you take away so much power from him?
---
yes we need this
---
Jesus Christ when will people realise that hex perks are a gamble. You wouldn‚Äôt go to a casino and throw ¬£50 on black then complain when red rolls in.
---
I like how Freddy is still lowest tier - based on absolutely nothing.
---
Holey moley thank you I've only been able to find the thicc border perk
---
Not gonna lie. If you drop your item and do this, he goes after other survivors a good 30% of the time. Lol
---
Oh hell please no Rob Zombie Myers, I tried so hard to supress the memorie of these movies.
---
A 2018 version would be nice imo
---
Are you sure that the first opinion of those who would have seen ghostface without a leak but directly in game after teaser/trailer would have been positive? I think the ghostface leak is intentional also for this, that is, everyone was expecting the chapter on Scream, so if you would have publicized the chapter with the usual marketing moves, with teasers on social media and then a trailer on the youtube channel , you would have increased the hype of people even more on a chapter on Scream, which would have inevitably been doubly disappointed after discovering that not only is it not a chapter on scream but only on ghostface, but even ghostface doesn't even have the original dress because the rights have them only on the mask.   
---
While instead with leak, people already know what to expect and therefore the hype is only on the release date.
---
that sly bastard XD
---
&gt;Calls me over dramatic.
---
&gt;Writes paragraph responses to one sentence comments.
---
This is some serious protection.
---
and if they give up, the killer gets full points, killing everyone on first hook shouldn't reward a 2 pip. Same reason why JUST escaping as survivor isn't enough to pip either.
---
There's a reason a 3 hook sacrifice, 1st hook sacrifice, Mori, bleeding out, etc. all reward different amounts of points.
---
Amen sister
---
US West. But that wasn‚Äôt on the survey so I don‚Äôt know that it matters much.
---
She would be a very loud but funny survivor.  They should give her a perk that allows you to punch a killer.
---
Laughs extremely dark in Trapper Main
---
If someone unhooks me with We‚Äôll Make It I try to get some distance from the hook before healing. Don‚Äôt want us both to go down because a try-hard Killer saw the unhook notification and immediately comes back for round 2.
---
It would also be helpful if I could see what perk tier the other survivor has. If it‚Äôs tier 1 it‚Äôs worth moving to a safer location, but at tier 3 I‚Äôll be healed in like 6 seconds so it‚Äôs worth the risk of staying at the hook.
---
Can report and ban him for that. 
---
But idk if it‚Äôs holding hostage now that end game is a thing....
---
Scratched coin gang
---
Based on my experience, Freddy needs to be 10 tiers more up. Never thought I'd say that about Freddy tho.
---
Howard Moon got tired of his job at Zooniverse and became a copycat killer of Michael Myers...
---
They still can...
---
I ain't no streamer and I definitely arent someone who you should take my word as law, after all I'm just some guy on the internet, I just was sayin I'm not some rank 20 survivor main who has no idea what they're talking about. But yes huntress is very countable, but so is nurse. The survivors just need to be amazing. Huntress isn't super powerful but I rarely get less then 2 kills with her. To me that helps point to the fact she's one of the most balanced killers. I also didn't say I dont want to have loops reworked for her, that stuff is annoying, I just said its unreasonable for them to rework half the maps for a single killer.
---
If they actually add a battle pass they should at least add entirely new cosmetics for it too. That would make worth buying it much more
---
I would put bubba and clown down a notch bubba binges on chili and clowns bio literally says he eats a lot of junk food not to mention he thicc.
---
It used to be that Michael had no collision while Stalking, so you could use Stalk to walk through or behind hooked Survivors and then release Stalk to just stand there.
---
They added Stalk-proof collision to the hooks around the time of the Hallowed Blight event though, so either this is an old picture or they've reintroduced it.
---
This is literally ten days old and was posted before the video??? But okay.
---
I like the hinder trap, thats good.  
---
Isolating pray is confusingly worded. When you say belongings, do you mean Auras? If so, thats a cool idea- a kind of anti aura field around the killer.  
---
Blood altar sounds... interesting. The way you phrase it sounds like you can resurrect any Totem by sacrificing a survivor. Which is a neat concept. I would suggest the following tweaks- The perk can activate on any hook that a survivor has been hooked on at least once, not just ones that a survivor died on. In exchange, when you set the totem, the hook is disabled while the totem is active. Finally, Do not reveal the aura permanently- rather, give the players an alert similar to the one a killer sees when a gen skill check is failed, and keep the increased cleansing speed.  
---
laced hooks is also interesting. I'm not sure about how I feel about it though, as I have difficulty imagining it in function. It seems fine, but it would deff need testing to see how well it plays with other perks.
---
They also have to rely on people actually reporting rule violations.
---
Hex: Another Chance should somehow be basekit. SOMEHOW. Not like that, but somehow, at least once per trial.
---
Same thoughts here. People get mad when I mention a totem counter though. You can buff killers accordingly to help push solo up to swf level. People don't seem to get that.
---
As long as the cap stays as 32000, then the extra 2k bp on a farming game won't make or break the economy.
---
TIL
---
Personally I dont find Billy or spirit annoying to verse, but that's my opinion. I do agree though, if I were to rank all the killers, they would be 2 and 3 for power. Poor huntress, keeps falling in her ranking.
---
Hear*
---
Just find the hatch first before the killer does.
---
I ain‚Äôt gonna take this seriously but that is totally a good way to piss killer mains (like me) off.
---
The Miner and it isn‚Äôt Steve from Minecraft?
---
What‚Äôs even worse is when the killer is literally afk in the corner of the map and your teammate still runs away
---
Wait so should you just heal right under the hook? Even if the killer is in a Chase I tend to at least try to run behind some nearby wall or smth to hide in case.
---
Every time I launch this game my ps4 turns into a helicopter.
---
I want Brenda in soo bad!
---
I went to your stream and you were not speaking English idk what language you were speaking but I couldn't understand a word you were saying.
---
Even if ppl run multiple exhaustion perks, NEVER run Sprint Burst with them. It'll slaughter your built.
---
I agree.  Let the people who spend money on the game have purchase-only cosmetics.
---
It helps me decide who to target.
---
Kindly put legion down 7 tiers I still haven't forgiven that edgy group of teens for the infinite mend glitch games.
---
HEY MAN. I GOT IT BY PLAYING KILLER AND LOSING TO A 4 MAN SWF THAT ALL FOUND THE HATCH. TOTAL LUCK. THE NURSE GRAB TROPHY TOOK ME THE LONGEST TO GET THE PLAT
---
I do this sometimes if it's my last hook!
---
Bottoms play survivor, tops play killer
---
&gt;Hear* me out
---
I don‚Äôt really have anything against battlepasses. I won‚Äôt buy one, but I don‚Äôt dislike them. 
---
However, there definitely should be some kind of reward for ranking up. Maybe for Devotion as well.
---
I would put Adrenaline over MoM easily.
---
to be fair if I remember correctly balance landing still reduces stun lock when falling by a lot so it is good even without the speed boost but I see what you mean
---
To be fair I‚Äôm talking the one from OP‚Äôs photo. Even a true original 1930‚Äôs inspired Mummy would be cool. But there are more possibilities with the 1999 and it‚Äôs 2001 sequel version to be fair.
---
Bond is really good for chases too, you never want to be that guy that leads the killer to a generator being worked on by other survivors.
---
lol the chances of the killer going back to the same locker and checking it again is so low i would have done the same.
---
Those are the only add ons that are good.
---
Yeah I don't get why people are taking this so seriously I thought it was hilarious
---
In high rank they just do gens
---
Personally I like it, but I also would‚Äôve liked the original more. But, there are probably reasons why they didn‚Äôt use the costume, and I think a plain black robe wouldn‚Äôt be as cool as the other killer designs.
---
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING, BUT WHAT IS IT, WHAT DOES IT DO
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
I do this on my partners rank 20 account. I play as Myers with crappy perks and my goal is just to give them some good scares and let them escape after a few hooks. It‚Äôs so funny though to see them hiding in plain sight and running in a straight line.
---
The double-pip should be nearly impossible.
---
Well, at least they stayed true to the game and kept in the grinding aspect!
---
*2010 remake Freddy
---
Why would you include Rob Zombie Michael but not 2018 Michael?
---
Someone's getting banned xD
---
I think those are the entities untextured arms from when they cover the gens in endgame, glitching in and the game not knowing what to do.
---
DCing should ban you for an hour.
---
yeah
---
Pink Susie only Susie. Fight me!
---
your guess is as good as mine man who knows lol
---
DC-ing on last hook can just be people not wanting to depip/pulling the plug to save their item.
---
&gt;rindfest at it's finest. There are many people who will grind their lives just because they don't want to miss any cosmetic, so either they make them not exclusive to battle pass and you can buy them later in the shop permanently, or just make it not so tim
---
BUT where did you read that the skins that will be in the battle pass will be the most expensive? And also, just play to unlock skins. besides that as I said, paying is optional! (translated with Google Translate)    [http://prnt.sc/nsggeg](http://prnt.sc/nsggeg)
---
No, I follow him and such. Just got annoying after awhile because he is very "my opinion matters more than yours" type of people. He also whines about things constantly and I just had to back away for awhile. I miss the old Tru3.
---
Yes, but the achievement shouldn't when it's so easy for survivors. At least make it consistent for all players, make it a 4K instead of double pip
---
I play both so I'm not trying to piss anyone, i've only read a meme with this image and that's the thing i immediately thought about xD
---
WHERE IS THE PLAAAAAG DUDEEEEE
---
Just switch ad and mom and it would work
---
I dont begrudge them for making money on the skins. People love skins. Just as League and Smite. They are a company trying to turn a profit. Too expensive for you? Dont buy. They are totally optional
---
That's a lot of survivors using Urban Evasion.
---
I'm not sure what you are referring to, I just went and double checked the person who reported it and they have not been banned. Only those who intentionally used that bug in a public match were banned the last time around, Kill Your Friends was excluded.
---
This happened to me also
---
Man I was playing Michael yesterday and a survivor got mad at me for playing him "in the worst way". I asked him to explain and he said "You only use EW3 in chases!" and I was just flabbergasted. Oh, let me just pop EW3 across the map from the survivors (somehow). That'll be a good play.
---
He eventually said that he never got to use dead hard so I guess what he was *trying* to say was "You only chase while in EW3". Which wasn't even true, but maybe I happened to hit him with it 3 times.
---
Anyway, Michael is not free of survivor complaints.
---
HOW IS IT BAD THOUGH, IF ITS LIKE OTHER BATTLE PASSES ITS FREE STUFF AND FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN DEDICATE MORE TIME MORE COSMETICS, NO MATTER WHAT YOU GET MORE STUFF
---
That‚Äôs it then.
---
On console, there‚Äôs only one version of the game you can buy; the Special Edition. The Special Edition comes with everything the PC version comes with (except for Bill, who‚Äôs PC exclusive)- the three original killers, the four original survivors, and then two additional chapters; Last Breath and Lullaby for the Dark. Console‚Äôs special edition, however, also comes with Of Flesh and Mud (Ace and Hag) and Spark of Madness (Doc and Feng).
---
Jiro's Outstanding member needs a slight nerf, but is a great perk. instead of instant healing the survivor who healed him, make it - if the survivor who healed you is injured, they gain 50/75/99% healing progression.
---
michael has tombstone 
---
legion has dc
---
Thanks :)
---
this is oddly specific, i‚Äôm saying op has an ear fetish
---
But doesn't tombstone just mwan you mori the survivor? So it is still just moring the survivor.
---
SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST REALY DO BE LIKE THAT THOUGH
---
And tons of hackers.
---
Ok balanced landing and dead hard together work but why the fuck sprint burst lol
---
&gt;They also have to rely on people actually reporting rule violations.
---
Even if I report the same post multiple times, they still won't remove it.
---
This is what i do when queue times get fucked up on my main account :)
---
Identity V is the better dbd mobile
---
I want to know what happened that caused all of you to get down when exit gates are open
---
This was the most satisfying thing I came across this morning.
---
League has been always pay to play. I mean free to play.
---
You want to spend hundreds of dollars unlocking heroes? Or spending your whole life grinding them?
---
Maybe you like grinding to grind. I personally don't.
---
Thank you u/410maximus for blessing us with all these ash memes
---
Lol, Thanks. It just makes sense to me that a weird immaterial fog/spider thing has no idea how tech works and just BS's it.
---
no, tombstone has a different animation, and different mechanics, even if 80% of the animation is the same, its still different. so no, its not just mori-ing the survivor.
---
&gt;post game chat posts are redundent and pointless.
---
&gt;like for real, everyone has experienced it, nobody cares.
---
Same can be said about 4x iridescent emblems but mods still only delete half of them, even if you report.
---
This dude really just said fortnight...
---
I would put LF lower down. The rampant toxic leatherfaces make it more reasonable to dc and not require the survivor to be toxic.
---
*has to get adept ghostface soon ah shit*
---
I can understand some arguements that certain aspects are pretty one sided, whether it be for killer or survivor. All we can really do is hope that two completely different gameplay experiences feel equally matched one day.
---
More money doesn't necessarily lead to more content though.
---
if face camper gets more than one kill that means you fucking fucked up
---
He farmed with us and in the end after everyone got enough points he started downing everyone and killed us with his ebony mori. Was a fun game actually
---
A sequel is an example.  Thanks for focusing on it to take my statement out of context to try to enforce some weak narrative that implies a paid game basically going ftp is good. It is terrible.
---
ahh I'm just jokin around - I wouldn't do something like that.
---
yes, but at the same time, survivors should get a pip if they have at least one iridescent emblem
---
If by ¬´being a dick¬ª you mean try to win in the most efficient way possible within the boundaries without being toxic then that‚Äôs a sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make. The same way I do what I can to win I expect the survivors to do as well, looping and gen-rushing all the same.
---
I didnt mind the moonrise event. Got an outfit in 2 days playing my average game time. I dont see the cosmetics as the event reward I see the BP as the reward, the free cosmetic is just a bonus.
---
But I just dont get some people. Locked through microtransactions? *greedy! Let us grind for it for free!*
---
Made free but with a grind? *How dare you make it grindy!? You just want us to pay for it! Greedy!*
---
Well now my meme is incorrect. This is unaccapetable and said.
---
&gt;if a game is pay to win then it is fucking atrocious and should not be played. This is the scum of gaming.
---
But they've said it will not be pay to win.
---
&gt;All battlepasses are cosmetics. But cosmetics are part of the game, whether or not they impact it. Content is content. If you put content that would traditionally be given for the game price, behind a subscription pay wall, then you are milking your players.
---
We already have cosmetics that you have to purchase separately, you don't get them for free for buying the game. So nothing really changes there.
---
&gt;It is also not usually just basic cosmetics, but any new cosmetic or profiling or customisation features that they decide to add into the game.
---
Now you have entered into the realms of wild speculations that you have no basis for.
---
Hi I‚Äôm new to the game, what‚Äôs face camping?
---
BASICALLY YOU COMPLETE CERTAIN CHALLENGES AND GET FREE SHIT LIKE COSMETICS BLOOD POINTS AND IRIDESCENT SHARDS YOU CAN PAY FOR A VERSION THAT GIVES YOU MORE STUFF FASTER
---
Hahhah...groovy
---
Worth it to exchange DH for a team perk. Not much counter to balanced other than NOT chasing certain places. Run We‚Äôll Make It or Borrowed Time, for the team!
---
If the game isnt fun for you,  don't play. What an objectively stupid point of view....
---
Real content like killer dlc and maps are positive too.
---
YEAH I AGREE WITH THIS IF I CANT GET ONE DAMN PERK IM NOT GETTING THEM ALL AGAIN
---
I‚Äôm talking about the YouTuber CowsIAM. One of you developers issued him a temporary ban for ‚Äúexploiting‚Äù the bug/glitch despite it being him figuring it out to report to you. He only ever did it in Kill Your Friends and made YouTube videos about the glitch but never revealed how to do it so as to avoid everyone exploiting it. He was banned for at least 24 hours for it.
---
Then you get looped and now look poor *AND* boosted
---
I never run exhaustion perks because with my luck I never get to use them in the first place, with use sprint burst effectively.
---
agreed. Not gonna tell you how to play. Nothing wrong with trying to win. But tunneling and camping makes you a dick. Don't try to claim that you're not a dick because you try to win. That part is fine. Not giving people a chance to play against you makes you a dick
---
1. Read my reply. Not being p2w doesnt justify it..
---
2. You really don't understand.
---
3. No its not wild speculations, look at every other battlepass released in the past year or 2.
---
Why do you assume that? Fortnite didn't invent the battle pass, I don't get why people only think of Fortnite when the mention of it comes up.
---
It's still a baseless assumption, wait for the details instead of already making up your mind.
---
&gt; I thought people complained because they didn't have the time (job/holiday/injury/life) to partake in the Crismis event, not because of the rewards.
---
I don't see what that has to do with the fact there was still a grind involved. If the grind is too high then people won't be able to finish it in the limited time they DO have.
---
&gt;Not everyone can see past a skinnerbox to complain about it, that's why games use them.
---
And that's why I suggested you go after the people on this subreddit who doesn't see past it. Those people post in the same place as you, but you're content to let them keep posting? 
---
&gt;They get extremely defensive if you point out the flaws in the game
---
Except when it comes to economical stuff. And if you want to ignore Fortnite, fine. WoW, Hearthstone, even this subreddit all have contingencies that despise "greed" or "money-grubbing".
---
&gt;You want me to attack players who want more skinnerbox? Well I have already argued against them here, and now you, but attack?
---
That's quite a violent way to put it.
---
&gt;I don't know the people who spend awful amounts of money on behavioural traps, so I can't contact them
---
You've sort of contradicted yourself here. If you know the people who want more skinnerboxes are on here, then making actual DISCUSSION posts targeting them is what you should do. That's how you "contact" them. You can't target specific people but you CAN go after the group. Make a post with your mindset when you're the one who's clearly in the right, at least by your own conception. "How can you spend money on a skinnerbox system? Do you know how bad it is for gaming?"
---
Lead a revolution about it, I don't care. Do SOMETHING that isn't just effectively passive-aggressively commenting on the matter and completely AVOIDING those you take issue with. Challenge them directly. "Oh but it'll get me nowhere, it's the Internet, etc." you might reply as people are wont to do. But that's why I'm saying turn it into a bigger issue! If it needs to be "Us vs. them" then so be it!
---
I just want you to either accept that the people who spend money will out-number you and shut the fuck up about it if you're not going to go after them directly when BHVR has no reason to listen to you over them, OR contribute to a movement that pushes out if not directly SHAMES those who engage in such stupid purchases. Like, those are the two options that actually ACCOMPLISH something. Shouting about how bad BHVR is and doing nothing else will just lead to you making comment after comment while putting no effort in. How can you be content with that??? How can ANYONE who does that same thing be content with it? I've seen people on the WoW and Hearthstone subreddits complain for YEARS and only when those who are upset reach critical mass do the companies bother to take significant measures.
---
&gt;If a battlepass comes out, it's not because of them, because they don't work at Behaviour making executive decisions.
---
Where do I even start with this? That is the POINT of my whole way of thinking. Yes, it IS BHVR's decision to release a Battlepass. But you DO realize that no business-related decision would ever stay "decided" in that way, if it lost money or made a whopping $500 profit total? In other words, ***a company (particularly one who's "greedy") isn't going to keep pushing something that's continuously unsuccessful and not making them money***. Why do you think lootboxes and shit ARE so prolific? Because they lose every company that implements them money?
---
Fuck no! ***It's because that shit MAKES money, and LOTS of it! But where do you think that money comes from? The fuckin' atmosphere?*** Again, no! It comes from consumers! And that's the crux of my argument. Sure, whatever, ***blame BHVR*** for implementing the Battlepass. But blame consumers if the Battlepass ends up SUCCESSFUL, if one Battlepass becomes a second and third.
---
Why would BHVR try a second or third Battlepass if no-one bought or bothered with the first one? That makes no sense! When a company makes a business decision, it needs to be subsequently backed-up by consumer revenue. If it's not, then the company has every reason to revert it or rethink it. In other words, it's down to the consumers whether a business decision is considered a success or a failure. And that's why you need to hold consumers accountable. That's why you need to go after those people who say "Haha I bought the battlepass because i like dbd and want to support bhvr :)))". If they get upvoted and receive support, they'll keep buying them. And if that's the case, then your meager attempts to persuade anyone may as well just not be made at all.
---
By attacking the company, you're only attacking half the overall problem.
---
People DC against Billy? He's super fun to play against. And yes, I'm being serious.
---
you didnt realize what that meant, AND you decided to farm w/ a toxic claudette...
---
Lunar was way better than Hallowed Blight tbh. That event was a nightmare.
---
Derp.
---
If a game isn't opened then the killer should always get iridescent gate keeper. That emblem is for ya know... keeping the gate closed, if its closed then they did their job.
---
Greatly enjoyed this
---
Wraith who face camps and tunnels the entire time not in A tier
---
Nobody knows if you have "we'll make it", and knowing the killer is coming?  
---
Nobody cares.
---
What I mean is, *more stuff to pay for?* you can get rewards for playing, but *only* if you pay *more* than you already did for the game and dlcs.
---
Also Fortnite made the battle pass a popular idea. Stop assuming they *aren‚Äôt* taking ideas from an extremely successful game
---
almost definitely. i had messages on the regular off entire swf groups just saying 'reported'. usually spanish players who were the most salty
---
I need that small game buff. Please.
---
Works with me if youre not a Claudette or a meg
---
Not being p2w doesn't justify it not being pay to win as the devs have stated. Alright.
---
&gt;No its not wild speculations, look at every other battlepass released in the past year or 2.
---
&gt;You really don't understand.
---
Yeah you have addressed my argument there perfectly, thanks.
---
It is a baseless assumption because for all we know this pass could be different. Wait for the details before you make up your mind.
---
blah blah same shit we always here. yes good points. Doesn't change the fact that camping and tunneling makes you a dick. Sometimes tunneling is necessary in the late game to get that really good feng out the game. But if you got 4 gens left and you tunnel a guy off hook, he gets saved, and you tunnel again you're a dick. The dude got to be chased 1 time and in no way was your game at risk.
---
We can do the same "it's efficient" arguement all day and i'm sure no matter how many times i tell you i agree you're probably gonna say something about it. Just be empathetic and try to have fun. Pretty simple
---
In my experience, the rich looking ones are the ones who DC the moment they hit the ground.
---
You need to rethink that. They've made huge killer changes earlier this year, reformatted a ton of perks that were formally useless, added content to balance the end of games, theyre reworking mettle of man, and they're giving us a new killer and a Freddy work in a bit, too.
---
Legit thought that was Freddy
---
I normally do one gen and then spend the rest of the game chasing the killer trying to distract him, haha. I do like we'll make it. Balanced landing is ridiculously good but with my strategy I sometimes get caught out where I just need an extra little bit to hit the pallet or vault, and dead hard saves me so much when that's the case. Maybe when I'm a bit better at looping than I currently am I can swap them out.
---
hear\*
---
&gt;Don't try to claim that you're not a dick because you try to win. 
---
Why am I a dick for trying to win to the best of my ability? You really expect every killer you face to not play optimally just to let you have more fun? Why should they care at all? 
---
&gt;Not giving people a chance to play against you makes you a dick
---
First of all, I do give people a chance. There is a reason why I never facecamp/hard tunnel, because THOSE things are actually toxic, but saying that prioritizing targets effectively when the opportunity lends itself is being "a dick" is just laughable.
---
In my experience pre DS nerf it was DS users.
---
Now its Meg Mains
---
Mmm no
---
Its balanced and its the best its ever been since launch
---
&gt;more stuff to pay for
---
You are choosing to pay for the pass instead for paying for x number of skins if you were to purchase them from the store. So it's not more things to pay for, it's an alternative way to get the stuff that is already up for sale. As far as we know, they aren't getting rid of the store or introducing any exclusive cosmetics, so I don't get why you think there is more stuff to pay for.
---
&gt;but only if you pay more
---
It is an alternative to buying the cosmetics straight from the store.
---
But we'll make it heals the same speed at any tier. The only thing that changes with leveling it is how long the healing buff lasts for the unhooker with level one giving it for thirty seconds and level three giving it for a minute and a half
---
Run a killer with decent devious point generation, use bbq, beast of prey, and distressing, and then hook all 4 survivors at least once.
---
Im being brief because im on my phone. When im in work tomorrow i'll reply properly. Seriously on the first point, reread my reply and finish the sentence....
---
That isn't what a baseless assumption means. You assume based on evidence. Therefore it is a baseless assumption to assume that it will be different. At the end of the day it is a business model and the primary goal is to make more money through a subscription.
---
You may not like that but it is fact.
---
And whilst he‚Äôs tunnelling and camping, all the gems get done.
---
O shit
---
Huntress, Myers and Billy are tied for me.
---
Are the prices really bad though? They cost just as much as any other game's skins. The base game and DLC just happen to be pretty cheap.
---
I never said theyre removing the store. Almost certainly there will be exclusive cosmetics. I‚Äôm just personally annoyed that their adding more features that are just *pay us more money.*
---
Hahajahahahahaha.
---
The VAST majority of new cosmetics are Auric Cell only.
---
yo lowkey kinda hype for this
---
It was those too.  I loved how you could pinpoint the moment they miss their DS
---
I would complain if going to casino was the only way to gain money in the world. Yep, that‚Äôs Hex: Ruin for you. The only way to stand a chance in a high rank match is a gamble, pretty cool.
---
Sometimes if I meme as Dwight and slowly go in a locker before i get downed the Killer let me go xD
---
I am on PS4. Can‚Äôt wait to be tunneled over a perk that tilts someone more than it pisses me off being tunneled! Hahaha. 
---
Imagine an aura reading perk that also gives YOU an advantage as well and lose your mind over it.   
---
If you guys can have bbq and chili, nurses, scratched mirror, Amanda‚Äôs letter,  play as Freddy, etc then we can have a perk too. Silly.
---
Right this guy is so sad lmfaoooo.
---
The killer can only open one door or close the hatch to initiate endgame. If you close the hatch you cannot open a door.
---
depip to rank 20, play killer with only bp boosting perks, make sure you hook people as many times as possible
---
Also, in case anyone is interest, I've an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aldrnari_cosplay/)
---
I don‚Äôt DC based on killer- I think that‚Äôs dumb. But I AM sick and tired of going against Myers every other match. It‚Äôs used to be glad to get him, because jump scares, but... I want some variety :(
---
tbh kinda not, mainly since we know what a ton of the announcements are.
---
&gt;almost everything on the battle pass is on there only
---
Even looking at the leaks we can see that they contain skins that we can currently purchase purchase in the store, so even while only having pre-alpha of the pass avaliable we already see that it's not like Fortnite. 
---
&gt;since they just want to be like Fortnite apparently
---
Because they want to introduce a battle pass they want to be like fortnite. Alright, I guess Apex legends and Warframe want to be like Fortnite too. 
---
&gt;I personally don‚Äôt get why people are supporting this because BHVR has shown in the past they are inept at making things that doesn‚Äôt have enormous problems.
---
That's an amazing mindset to have, lets just assume everything they try to introduce is going to have problem and shouldn't be ever introduced. That's how you keep a 3 year old game alive, just don't make any changes.
---
Haha yes let's add a perk that buffs noed and add a perk that's just insanely anti fun! The additions to existing perks are ok, but God those original perks are really not a good idea
---
But I don‚Äôt have self heal bro.  Follow me over here to the corner.
---
This is really cool!
---
Hex: Another Chance combo'd with NOED would probably be DC-inducing for some survivors.
---
Noob3 foot reveal?
---
Oh boy... looking like it will be a major disappointment. Good luck for those that fall for this hype build up attempt.
---
Anyone else think this is a giant waste of money and time?
---
We all play the game, love or hate it we want to see new things coming, we see they have a dedicated team to fix things.
---
Thats great thats amazing, few dev teams have this kind of commitment to a popular game.
---
But building a set? Doing live musical performances?
---
Can they just show us or tell us the new stuff, what the old stuff is being worked on, and whats being changed?
---
Then we can go back to the game?
---
The dev Q&amp;A's are more than enough but they hardly answer real questions.
---
"What does ghostface do"
---
"What does Meg do"
---
"What does leader do"
---
These questions are already answered
---
I think we deserve questions answered like
---
"Will the community be given cinematic camera angles in kill your friends?"
---
"Will the game recieve more stressful events like the endgame where the whole map is changed?"
---
"Will the survivors recieve supernatural perks in the future? Or will they stay more physical?"
---
"When is the trapper getting a new Mori?"
---
"When is no mither getting a rework or buff?"
---
"When is the nurse getting a balance pass?"
---
"WHERE ARE THE EMOTES? FINGER GUNS?"
---
I could do without the music or fancy gettups, I want direct dev interaction and a massive Q&amp;A.
---
You can say that all you want. I don‚Äôt exactly have faith OR trust in your clearly incompetent Dev team. The YouTuber in question may not have been the very first to report the bug, but he was one of them. He posted screenshots of his ban to his accounts and is an active member here on this Subreddit as well. 
---
But yeah ok if you say so.
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs difficult to stop early gen popping. Especially on late game killers/killers with little map pressure
---
Also emblems are a thing, and many people never read them.
---
True, but your game is over quickly and can immediately jump into a new one. While killers have to sit through the entire match dealing with toxic survivors. Then sit in a 10 minute queue for a new game.
---
I love tombstone Myers I wish I encountered more of them
---
Hes being downvoted for complaining about a non issue.
---
Yea never thought of that. I guess its hostage, but not quite to that severity anymore.
---
Grinding is the reason people play this game so much, admit it or not but the reason this game is addictive and people put SO many hours into it is the progression system. 
---
Added objective based grinding sounds amazing, why are people complaining about this I can't get my head around it. 
---
The fact there seems to be a free path to take on the battlepass to get free skins means its a default buff to the playability of the game for everyone. 
---
The only arguments I see against it are "BUT FORTNITE I HATE FORTNITE", Fortnite didn't invent the battlepass and they haven't really implemented it in a very satisfying way.
---
This feels like a situation where the developers know the playerbase better than the playerbase know themselves. 
---
"I DIDN'T ENJOY MOONRISE FESTIVAL, THEREFORE I CAN NEVER ENJOY ANYTHING THESE DEVS DO IN FUTURE" is a pretty childish reaction to a few leaked screenshots from an obviously very incomplete leaked developer build.
---
I never said they shouldn‚Äôt change the game, just that when they add new content it‚Äôs always broken and buggy. My biggest gripe with it though is that *nearly everyone* voted they didn‚Äôt want it and what do they do? They ignore that and go ahead and make it, bc 3 people voted for it. Probably not even that, probably just: *money....*
---
Also Fortnite‚Äôs battle pass is most famous so that‚Äôs certainly where they got their inspiration
---
You are already assuming that the whole game will turn into a subscription service, ignoring the fact it's a paid game with DLCs and the pass is clearly for cosmetics only. 
---
&gt;You assume based on evidence.
---
Please show me any evidence from the leaks for this game that it's going to be a pay to win pass. You are making your assumption based on other games, while we have no information regarding this pass. For all we know it can be completely different, so passing judgements on pre-alpha version of it is stupid.
---
The only tier list that matters.
---
Overwhelming presence is terrible imo. You could replace it with franklin‚Äôs if you want a perk for survivors‚Äôs item.
---
That would be a moment where Ave Maria would be playing while it slowy fell to the ground, just to make it way more dramatic.
---
What discussion are you looking for? 
---
People are dicks. /thread
---
Heeeu girl, I would love Brenda
---
Let's be honest there not gonna add ghost face to the game
---
Currently rank 7 on Xbox as a killer. Survivors are unbearably toxic when I‚Äôve literally done nothing to tilt them.
---
i‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me. the toxicity in my opinion was slowly decreasing, but it‚Äôs like it spiked in the past week.
---
When comes this update?
---
Yeah I'm sure the people being vocal on the threads speak for most of the community, the same way how everyone on this sub hated Legion prior to the rework but for the full week post the rework we had rage threads and Legion appreciation threads.
---
Ghostface was leaked and is, in fact, the next killer.
---
what killer are you playing?
---
Pig=upvote
---
Yeah, definitely not. They probably cancelled the release they announced, along with confirmed announcements and leaks. Definitely no Ghostface any time soon.
---
Like the spot on coal tower
---
Spirit, Bubba, Billy, Myers, &amp; Huntress.
---
Well if you got all the perks you need on every character you need (which you also got for free) really quick and easy, please share the secret, I really need to know it. But I already know about BBQ and WGLF, just in case.
---
I KNOW THAT YOU MORON! THIS IS A RAGE THREAD WHERE I CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS I PERSONALLY DON‚ÄôT LIKE THAT DON‚ÄôT MERIT ACTUAL COMPLAINTS IN REAL LIFE! 
---
BUT YOU JUST HAD TO COMMENT LIKE I‚ÄôM SERIOUSLY SENDING SALTY MESSAGES AFTER GAMES. FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PROVIDE YOUR UNSOLICITED OPINION AND YOU CAN PRETEND THAT YOU‚ÄôRE SMART THERE. NO ONE CARES ABOUT REASONABLE DEBATE IN A THRED DESIGNED TO VENT FOR FUN. MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE SOCIAL AWARENESS OF A PORCUPINE WITH A CHLAMIDYA PEOPLE WOULD:
---
-
---
1) LIKE YOU
---
 2) CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY 
---
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO AROUND THREADS FOR AMUSED FAUX RAGE AND TALK LIKE YOUR OPINION MATTERS
---
A teammate did that to me once and I decided I‚Äôd try to message them after the game explaining what the perk did. The thinking behind this was maybe they were new and didn‚Äôt know. They came screaming into my inbox saying they don‚Äôt need my help and they know what my stupid perk does. They ended up telling me to get cancer and die. I was like god damn man!
---
It is honestly hard to tell it's him but by the colors on head it has the same pattern as one from the leaks
---
Happy cake day, OP
---
tunneling as pig, shameful.
---
If you say that this game is killer or survivor sided you're pretty much going to get the same reaction
---
at rank7? i feel like that‚Äôs the sweet spot. maybe we‚Äôve had different experiences. but i know for sure that insidious bubba will get bm no matter what.
---
Kinda forget that this was already a thing?
---
You can see that Freddy‚Äòs reworked power has a red power bar kinda like Myers‚Äò Evil Within bar! So he is definitely recharging his power or building up ‚Äûsleep‚Äú or something like that. I‚Äòm excited!
---
Nice trailer but did anybody notice Freddy has a gauge on his new power? tbh this is the coolest info we got from this video
---
Never run Insidious on Bubba. My Bubba build is BBQ, Distressing, Sloppy, and Enduring.
---
It should work like NOED does.
---
The next clip of freddy picking up meg, they're not in the dream world. He probably won't be putting people to sleep anymore. At least not in way where he can't interact with you if you're awake
---
So fortnite has a free progression system where you can unlock shit without paying for it in the battlepass to unlock stuff? Damn thats news to me!
---
Did you even watch the footage?! Honestly I am going to stop arguing with you now because im worried its causing me brain damage trying to get through to you. 
---
Your entire argument was based upon the Fortnite battlepass, you had not even viewed the DBD one and you smashed out 5 paragraphed replies to people ranting about the Fortnite battlepass talking like you knew what you were talking about.
---
Its evident you don't. See you later in the year enjoying your free battlepass and quests and progression!
---
Edited my original post to clarify that I wasn't talking about tunnelling. I just like killing obsession users, I don't prioritize killing them though, because it's more fun to distribute punishment. I'm a good pig I swear.
---
0:58 ghostface lol
---
Damn I can‚Äôt wait
---
I‚Äôm excited.  Even if we already know most likely the majority of what‚Äôs in store it would be nice to celebrate the game for what t is.
---
Mind writing us a modmail (write a private message to r/deadbydaylight) with the post in question so we can review the issue and explain why we did / didn't take actions? Also, it's possible that our rules may be misleading or confusing, which we would want to fix in this case.
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
3 years ago, there were a lot of nurses. Looping was issue..
---
Players hate nurses so much. After survivirs connected to match a nurse blinked first time, everybody DCed :D
---
I jus read the wiki and yea my bad. NOED activates when gates are powered and Rancor on all gens completion.
---
Should i still put this here so others can know about it or delete this?
---
So don‚Äôt touch any generator, don‚Äôt heal anyone and don‚Äôt get in any chases, get Iridicent unbroken and camp the hatch and pip.
---
Omegalol
---
Loving the Naughty Bear shirt.
---
Distraction, keeping you in chase, tilting you. The only time it is for sure BMing is when they are doing it in the exit gate after the game is decided. That's not to say you can't BM before that, but there are other reasons to do it, just like how some killers actually camp because they actually think its a good gameplay move, not to try to hurt anyone's feelings or make them mad irl.
---
Yeah sure keep thinking that. No phone is more powerful than a Switch. Tell me when a phone will be able to run Breath Of The Wild or Skyrim.
---
It‚Äôs ghostface, you can see his ribbons and the slits in his hood.
---
come on, they had to make up for the egc changes *somehow*
---
Wow. Nice catch
---
I am feeling literally nothing.. just expecting disappointment.
---
That‚Äôs because the Switch is better.
---
He's right their and he's been leaked they even said guess you guys no it's him
---
In all honesty what‚Äôs BM stand for?
---
Why are all the shots of the survivors showing that they are downed or messed up a gen lol
---
What perk icons are those?
---
Good perk build. Just replace hangmans trick with surveillance. Hangmans trick is super situational and surveillance is really helpful for gen regression
---
Not all. That‚Äôs a bit of an over generalization don‚Äôt ya think.
---
You can see Freddy‚Äôs new power in this video
---
Hard on the devs? Dropping leaks in patches on the regular is one of the worst things you can do. Let's not forget about the current HEALING glitch or not even being able to stand in a locker without your hand sticking out lmaooo
---
bad manner
---
Ok there seems to be a charge bar on Freddy's power, and correct me if I'm wrong but the survivor could see Freddy outside of the dream world?
---
Was this sarcastic? For a new player getting the through the bloodweb is one of the grindiest processes. In order to even use a character you have to get them to level 15, and to unlock all of their perks to level 40. And to get the perks you want, the teachables you've already grinded to unlock you have to level up further to have the chance to even see them in your bloodweb. 
---
For an experienced player, which has several hundreds of hours, the bloodwebs aren't a problem since you've already unlocked so many, and you probably get a lot of points every game but for a new player it's an insane grind.
---
However, with that being said, I still like the bloodweb grind. Getting prestige III with billy has been fun for me and because of BBQ + hex: hunter perk I got it quite a lot faster.
---
If anything, the killer could report the survivors for not activating EGC. Lol
---
It's Ghostface no other killer has shoulders that go like that and take that space up. Really hard to tell but it's easy by just comparing how much scream(pun intended) that they take up.
---
[deleted]
---
I understand how tunneling is a thing in dbd but when someone is obviously tunneling a player because of their nationality just isn't acceptable to me. I did report them on steam and hopefully they will get punished :/
---
Bye
---
Also, when Freddy was picking up the survivor, the survivor was awake and could see Freddy. Therefore Freddy might be able to enter the real world!
---
Might be counterprodutive once they get abolished by real killers thinking they are good at survivors (/) (¬∞,,¬∞) (/)
---
Yea, it‚Äôs us begging for mercy haha
---
His power will be reworked and act completely differently if you ask me. Maybe he gets an ability that helps him in a chase after making people fall asleep a few times.
---
So makes sense as a vers I play both?
---
Oh trust me it still happens, just had a 4 man DC lol
---
To everyone who is disappointed: This meme is not saying "this game is killer sided", this meme was just supposed to say "that's the way you trigger a killer player". I personally play both killer and surv, so I'm not lined up with any side
---
I got all 9 pieces + more with shards, but I was also free during that period so, rip.
---
Anyway, this isn't a groundbreaking realization. I think it's obvious it's going to be grindy, that's how these things work. Ever try prestiging all survivors or killers? Ever try fully prestiging just one survivor? Ever try getting all the perks on even just one survivor?
---
These are the same people who don't want to increase the occurrence of bloodpoint events or increase the base bloodpoint gain now that we have so many survivors and killers.
---
I personally don't see what the issue with the battlepass is. It's going to be nearly completely cosmetics and don't have an won't have an impact on gameplay unless you play Blendette or something. The only problem I can see with it is if you get perks and bloodpoints with it. The Shrine of Secrets already fills that niche. I'd be ok with shards being a prize though, I've gotten a lot of cosmetic pieces with shards.
---
This problem has multiple layers. One layer is the core of the game, escaping and killing. Another layer is implementing a point system to spend on items and perks. And the final layer is MMR/ranking (which is flawed anyway, but I won't get into).
---
I believe that the core of the game should be weighted much heavier than anything else, but it should also encourage team play as a survivor.
---
For example, as a survivor, you get 5000 points for escaping through a gate. There is rarely a situation point-wise that you would go try to save another survivor once exit gates are open. If the killer is face camping, then it becomes a high risk, low reward situation for that specific survivor (point-wise). Now throw in the fact that there are point caps in all 4 arbitrary categories. If my altruism category is capped due to unhooking and healing survivors all game, what incentive (point-wise) do I have to save the survivor instead of escaping? If I solo'd 3 gens this match and cap out on objective, it would be more beneficial to that survivor to go seek out the killer to be chased or unhooking/heal instead of doing the core objective of being a survivor. Go into a match with a really good item? Open that chest anyway to get some objective points instead of working on the generator right next to it. You get the point.
---
I think a good start would be to shift the focus back to the core of the game. Change the mindset of survivors by shifting the focus from "how can I escape" to "how I can contribute to my team so more survivors can escape" and changing the scoring system. One idea I had is to weigh escaping and killing much more heavily.
---
Survivor Score = (1 + survivors_escaped) * constant_number_x +/- survivor_contribution
---
Killer Score = (1 + survivors_killed) * constant_number_y +/- killer_efficiency
---
survivor_contribution can be stuff like cleansing totems, doing generators, safe unhooking, staying in a long chase, and healing for positive points, or  unsafe hooks, hiding too long (crows), and failed skill checks for negative points.
---
killer_efficiency can be stuff like ending chases quickly, number of generators still broken, and using the killer's power for positive points, or camping and tunneling for negative points.
---
This would encourage survivors to work together to achieve a common goal instead of hide in a corner/locker all game since the escape of their teammates affect their own points. This also gives an incentive for other survivors to rescue their teammate instead of just escaping. This would prevent 2 survivors for fighting for the hatch by deciding who will die so that the other may escape and get more points, and help prevent rewarding that one survivor that just hides in a locker to wait for everyone else to die so they can get the hatch and escape. This would mean that points will need to be rewarded at the end of the game instead of immediately after you leave. These scores would be weighted much less than the constants.
---
For example, constant_number_x could be 6000 and constant_number_y could be 6000 (the two constants can be different or the same). survivor_contribution and killer_efficiency could range anywhere between -2000 to +2000.
---
If all survivors escape, then 
---
Survivor Score = 30,000 +/- survivor_contribution
---
Killer Score = 6,000 +/- killer_efficiency
---
If no survivors escape, then
---
Survivor Score = 6,000 +/- survivor_contribution
---
Killer Score = 30,000 +/- killer_efficiency
---
If only 2 survivors escape, then
---
Survivor Score = 18,000 +/- survivor_contribution
---
Killer Score = 18,000 +/- killer_efficiency
---
That's just an idea anyway. I'm certain there are plenty of flaws to this approach as well, but at least it enforces the core mechanic of the game. Don't get me started on ranking/pipping system; it'll require an entire system re-haul since the current system forces survivors to fight each other for available ranking resources in any given match instead of working together (much like the point system).
---
It's just hard to kill someone who has given up. Feels bad man.
---
Lmfaooo did this last night, dropped my key for a Freddy lol
---
Yeah ok dude... its dumb and completely unfair. Considering killers get to use theirs.
---
He's always been able to pick up survivors that aren't asleep.
---
Why did he suddenly grow a fur coat?
---
Even though they said they are working on reworking how sound stuff is implemented into the game so they can fix it, lmao
---
When you play trapper or hag and someone is running OoO
---
FeelsBadMan(or women)
---
No.  It makes zero sense.
---
Fine. Then what would you suggest as an idea that they earn money for? You got any ideas? Any suggestions that can allow them to earn enough money to keep the lights on? To pay their workers? To provide the content they can offer? Any at all? Please! I would love to hear it!  
---
Look, I'm not trying to argue with you. But right now, you're coming off as a bit of an idiot. Just because the term "Battlepass" has been tainted by Fortnite does not always mean its a bad thing to include. If they do it right and offer content people are willing to play for, I say let them go for it. They'll most likely still have the store where you can buy skins with Iri shards and such. Its just now there are more ways to earn these skins through game play. When you think about it, its pretty smart.
---
As you can see from the screenshot from the trailer the guy he just hit isn‚Äôt asleep while two others are.
---
This games the worst shit I‚Äôve ever played lol, zero thought behind it, no way to escape killers without those sorry excuses of a door which stop them for about 2 seconds which does nothing, camera angle is pathetic and the heartbeat is just pointless
---
Just in case you‚Äôre not being deliberately obtuse, they‚Äôre being sarcastic.
---
Dont run hex totems forhead...
---
I mean punishing the killer for the survivors being trash is a very bad idea gameplay wise.
---
Anyone else disappointed that Mathieu didn't say "I think we've done a pretty good job so far".
---
So you're just going to ignore all of the other great stuff they have done? The amount of consistency and transparency with the community is better than some of the huge game  titles out there *cough* apex *cough*....
---
Some people just can't be pleased...
---
It takes practice.
---
That's it we need a mr Krabs killer and this grab song plays when he's chasing you, and one of his personal perks is he steals 10 percent of bloodpoints you earned that match if he hits you XD
---
the fuck is on his shoulder
---
He‚Äôs being sarcastic dude
---
Pretty good perk build. I suggest getting ruin, bbq, enduring and spirit fury but with your current perks this is probably the best build
---
THEY SAY IT WILL BE MOSTLY COSMETIC WHICH IS FINE ENOUGH BUT ALSO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A CASH GRAB. IT IS BIG IN FREE TO PLAY GAMES WHICH MAKES SENSE AS THEY NEED ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF REVENUE BUT BHVR ALREADY MAKES MONEY OFF OF THE DLC AND GAME.
---
It's like little wraps of fabric that floats around with low physics to simulate like a ghost
---
I would suffer through 500 matches against prechange legion just to be in the terror radius of that dancing Pig when it puts its ham hocks in the air
---
Lol that's right! They could all just stay and prevent egc.
---
That's just part of the meme, but yeah it seems a bit bitter. I can't blame them.
---
But you dc against legion? In 2016 did you dc against a good nurse? Nurse has even less counterplay legion was just the easiest to play nurse has the largest skill gap
---
not ranking up is not a punishment. It's a different discussion if you derank from matches like that, but it definitely sholudn't be a 2pip.
---
2pips should reward excelling in the match, not having inferior opponents that gave you the win practically. People were upset at red ranks being crowded with bad players that didn't deserve to be there, and while true we have the opposite problem now, the emblem system is going in the right direction.
---
How you got that 4k matters more than getting a 4k, just like how you escaped matters more than just escaping.
---
Damn this is probably the most interesting list I've seen
---
Persona 5 and DBD? Very good, carry on.
---
Because you suck... thank you next
---
Its a scam bot
---
Soon another bot will come and ask "wHEre diD yOu GeT tHe APPparel?" and op bot will post scam link
---
Im amazed mods wont do anything about this bots
---
Oh shit that would actually be dope!!
---
I've been playing for a little bit now and what you say is 100% true. It took me tons of hours to get one teachable. Not that I have all but 4 teachables I have forgotten the grind
---
If you dc against nurse you probably dc against me I‚Äôm a nurse main played her since January of 2017 been rank 1-5 ever since
---
Aphfug
---
Really? i mean how do you go down without being asleep tho?
---
How tf do you know??
---
Maybe it'll work something like Michael's stalk, where he has to charge the dream state. Once it's charged, ALL survivors are put to sleep, which slows all actions (gens, healing, sabotaging, etc.) and maybe gives Freddy some aura reading abilities until the time expires?
---
He just got the scoring event for hitting someone so he just hit that person and you can clearly see they‚Äôre not asleep.
---
Yeah, I think it would have been positive, because I think people are excited for it with or without leaks. Now we've seen his mori and him moving around the map, otherwise we would've seen the same thing a few weeks later, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. My reasoning was that showing everything like this at once makes the "I have to see this for myself" effect when it actually releases less strong. But your idea is reasonable too, that showing things earlier lessens the impact of possible disappointment. However, they could've done this in many ways other than leaking it in such a weird way. They own the game, so they could have just uploaded footage or show him in action on a stream without teasers if they wanted to. For me personally, this goes a bit too far into a conspiracy theory, because there is too much speaking against this being intentional (the announced reveal on the 28th for example and the additional leak of charms, which has no relation to Ghostface). To me, it's more likely to simply be a mistake, as unusual as it may be, and that they were trying to make the best out of it afterwards.
---
The objective is to get emblems not kill the survivors.
---
If there was more time they could totally host a contest for best Dwight cosplay. Winner gets to spend the whole stream in the locker.
---
Well it happened so
---
Interesting, well that will already make him better than Legion
---
Poor Legion
---
Going through the process myself. It's super anti-noob and honestly makes me wonder how many people tune out from the game because of it.
---
Dark smithy
---
Lorewise, that is true. Gameplay wise, Killer players just want to murder the Survivors. And gameplay and story segregation is a thing.
---
Can't expect to communicate with animals. Never know till you try tho.
---
Yeah maybe there's a count down like with legions now where they have a certain amount of time in sleep before they wake or something too
---
Freddy is my fav killer because his concept is great, there's just too much counterplay now for him
---
Making people hittable when not asleep would be too big a buff on it's own. Maybe when he's within a certain radius they're able to see him or something? 
---
I hope BHVR makes my boy better
---
There is literally nothing to grind for besides BP, this game already has micro transactions where the cosmetic costs more than this battle pass would and I highly doubt they're adding anything pay to win
---
Yea we know op isnt mature
---
Anything against his post and he gets all defensive
---
Lol can‚Äôt stop won‚Äôt stop baby!
---
Which is why it's better to not always go in to a locker
---
Of course! that is why they are in the same tier they are both amazing dinner guests!
---
Let me know what you guys think. My reasoning for this list briefly is:  
---
S Tier: Huntress- Very capable of taking care of you and herself. Is always the top in bed. Perfect for those who want dom mommys.   
---
Wraith- Sensitive Bing Bong Boy. Will always protect you is good for company. Can need time to himself but he's never bothersome.   
---
A Tier: Nurse- A little crazy but not too crazy. Can do all sorts of kinky stuff using her telekinesis. A little too into choking tho.   
---
Myers- Pros: Daddy Myers. Cons: Never talks   
---
B Tier: Freddy: Very funny, has witty one liners. Kinda lame and annoying sometimes but a decent lover.   
---
Trapper- Wealthy, owns his own estate. Hard working, a man's man. Also can be abusive however.   
---
Pig- More on the crazy side, but can keep up a good face on the outside. Can also be very adorable at times \*squeak\*  
---
C Tier: Bubba- Can be soft and sensitive but also have tantrums. A little dirty and into weird hobbies.  
---
Clown- VERY kinky. Good if you're kinky, terrible if you're not  
---
Doctor- Will definitely ask for feet pics. Also only good if you're into the same crazy stuff he is.  
---
D Tier: Spirit- Extremely jealous type. Emotions are all over the place. Will kill any female you look at.   
---
Legion- Annoying immature polyamory group. Only fun if you're really into partying.   
---
F Tier: Plague- Will throw up all over you and then try to murder you for the sake of salvation  
---
Hag- Will try to eat you. Is very into necrophilia and vore  
---
Billy- Has no manners. Smelly and gross. Not good for company or conversation.
---
You have to pay for the battlepass. If you don't you have to grind through multiple battlepass seasons to unlock one for "free"
---
You unlock shit for grinding after you pay for the privilege of grinding.
---
I did watch the footage. Which part isn't a copy/paste? The bit with the battle pass tiers and cosmetic rewards on half of the tiers? The free tiers for you to grind for less rewards? The premium tiers where you grind for more rewards after paying? I suppose the bloodweb style grind tasks aren't like fortnite, oh wait fortnite has those too, just in a list.
---
If you're worried you're gaining brain damage from talking on the internet, I'm no doctor but I don't think it does that, unless you're putting head to desk, in which case please don't injure yourself, that hurts you and your family.
---
"What's bad about a battlepass?" "Well current examples like Fortnite and Warframe show us..." "HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT FORTNITE, OUR BATTLEPASS WON'T BE LIKE THAT" "Oh, I see, it's just Fortnite's battlepass"
---
If you don't think I know what I'm talking about, then I'm sorry but could you tell me where my wording is poor because I thought I made my thoughts clear. I'm not going to enjoy my free battlepass and quests, I want to play the game, not the skinnerbox.
---
well if you can tell the survivors are trash, why not toy around with them a bit
---
I just posted my reasoning a second ago. Basically because he's Daddy Myers
---
I just tried again, it took a little to load but its up again for me
---
They could simply make him visible even when awake. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt really work with his lore but it would solve that. 
---
Honestly I feel like we‚Äôre gonna see dreamworld as what we want to put survivors in but not required to. Just have to see what they‚Äôre doing to dreamworld to make it something we want.
---
Why is there a charge bar around the dream demon icon?
---
Can I just bring up that his power now has a meter around it?
---
WTF
---
I downloaded the photoshop app on my phone. You‚Äôre all in trouble now. Shitty memes incoming. Stay groovy!
---
Because it‚Äôll be like legion and Myers where it depletes and can‚Äôt be used till it regenerates.
---
I'm really hoping they keep his invis for the most part bc without it the dream state seems a little unnecessary uk?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs definitely a big change.
---
Yeah, in case you haven‚Äôt been around the Internet, it can be hard to tell who‚Äôs an actual idiot and who‚Äôs being ‚Äúfunny.‚Äù  In this case, I was the idiot.  Why downvote me?
---
It's on PC now too. I've been having fun with it. DbD is better, but Identity V has some neat ideas I wish DbD did.
---
To the Legion I keep facing against in green ranks that wears the frosty eyes, afterglow (he used to wear fairview varsity jacket), and the modern karambit, no words can express how much I hate you and your Iridescent Button + Filthy/Nasty blade + terror radius effects perks build. It isn't even good, you never get a 4k in all the games I've been in with you but it still pisses me off to no end. I can't escape the heartbeat ever.
---
You've just got to ease up on some players and fool around a bit, it's a lot like professional fighting, no one wants to watch a match where the champ who has a win/loss ratio of 30-1 and his opponent has a 10-27 win/loss ratio, you know who's going to win and it's not even going to be a match unless the champ plays around with him, it's just kinda boring
---
Exactly! But if Freddy‚Äôs invisible and doesn‚Äôt need dream state to hit anyone...then why would he ever put someone to sleep?
---
I tried it again and it worked
---
Legion is S Tier for those that like 3 Somes. 
---
Plague is F---- tier
---
:c
---
Battle passes are a predatory marketing device, devised to make impulsive shoppers buy it, exploiting some peoples weaknesses.
---
I can get it on a free2play, those games need to make money somewhere afterall, but on a paid game with 4 paid DLCs per year, that's just so fucking greedy it's a spit to the face of the customers.
---
Fair point. Freddy would have good manners. Plus, he comes equipped with cutlery! I'd imagine he'd like a very burnt steak.
---
But only when you play killer
---
I just cant help but wonder were the series could've progressed i really enjoyed the first three seasons
---
The dreaded white power symbol. Shame on your bhvr
---
It could honestly mean his power is strong enough to require having a meter of sorts or that it could be on a timer when he activates the power. My interest is piqued in what they did with him
---
Fine by me; if they dont heal from deep wound they drop
---
Whatever it is, that sounds dumb.
---
Killer who has thrill of the hunt: oh sweet a free hook
---
Thank youuuu! Finally someone who agrees
---
Tracking purposes
---
It's the same dance I do on the rare occasion where I get my first skill-check and realize Ruin isn't in the game at all.
---
WTF!? Why is my goddess not S tier? Pig is liek the best date ever!
---
My biggest tip for this game is to just not care. Play it with the express purpose of having fun
---
~~Buy Spirit and level her up.~~ I'd probably have to agree with the person who said Hag. Hex: Ruin and Hex: Devour Hope are both very good perks, and her power is pretty fun and strong. Other than that, it kinda depends on what you're looking for.
---
Are you looking for a Killer to level up and play as, or a Killer to get Perks from? If the latter is the case, who do you usually play as?
---
I'm even more afraid. I really hope they didn't take away his aura-reading and built-in stall, either.
---
The Switch CPU is pretty far behind smartphones, ...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/8b3s73/how_powerful_is_the_switch_compared_to_todays/dx3vfe4?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
It *sounds* very successful..then the clock strikes 9pm and you cant find a survivor match on ps4..even when you live in the biggest city in the fucking world.
---
I'll take kinky clown boy, plz.
---
What killer is your main, because I would pick a pick around them??
---
/r/cringe as hell whining about "mains" my friend
---
It's hard to say, we'll just kinda have to wait for the 31st to see much more! All we know at the moment (as far as I know at least lol) is that there's a power bar and that the Dream World still exists, though it doesn't appear to work entirely the same as it did before.
---
I'm pretty sure the Doctor's halloween skin gives him bonus movement speed
---
As predicted. A bullshit rework that doesn‚Äôt help but fucks him up. He was literally fine before. It was a matter of not playing him stupidly ffs. Looks like I need a new killer to Main....AGAIN.
---
Rage quits via the ‚ÄúLeave Match‚Äù option have the disconnect sound.
---
If there‚Äôs no sound and the icon changes to the disconnected symbol it can mean that either there was a technical issue OR they still rage quit. 
---
If you unplug your internet, close the game through task manager (I believe) or on PS4 you force close the App from the main menu it treats it like it was a technical issue. Many quit this way because you don‚Äôt lose pips and you used to not lose items leaving the game this way.
---
This 1000%.
---
I don‚Äôt play anymore bc the gameplay is super repetitive
---
You literally say:"if it's based on PERSONAL experience, then why isn't nurse f tier." You are basically saying here that I'm shit at nurse.
---
I too require the sauce
---
Well, Plague ain't really "healthy" .
---
Good to hear, do you play ps4?
---
i mean at rank 15 you can literally do anything and get a 4k. all the survivors run in a straight line away from you
---
the freddy remake had him actually be a rapist... youd rather date a rapist than literally anyone below him?
---
and the huntress has the mind of a five year old...
---
DARN
---
Tunneling/kill rushing is just doing the objective efficiently, nothing toxic about it despite how salty people can get over it.
---
Identity V is a lot better considering the devs of DBD actually support the game.
---
Oh huntress that's interesting what perks you run with her? I'm curious bc I suck with her ahah
---
yeah true! i already got ruin though from shrine, but the trap mechanic seems very good.
---
Sadly yes
---
The devs, causing me more and more anxiety about the Freddy buff each and every day.
---
look man, I didn't consider Freddy a rapist pedophile before I made this list and now everyone commenting is making me doubt my tier list
---
Worth it!
---
seeing i got many perks from shrine, such as bamboozle, hex ruin.. it is mostly killer rather than perks
---
Do you get why I put Freddy so high?
---
Well you can. But if you don't sell cosmetics, you won't make those and you won't have money for some other crap like a new chapter every 3 months. Just saying.
---
i tend to use billy or huntress the most. maybe doctor at the moment
---
Looks to me like the jeepers creepers monster alien thing.
---
Why not just play a different game at this point if you're sandbagging your teammates against six killers?
---
They said they‚Äôd never make him because his creator was a pedophile.
---
Still holding the game hostage, since he was stuck in a corner for (likely) 10-15 minutes.
---
This just made me more terrified, to be quite honest. I'm extremely wary of that power bar. I don't want to lose his aura-reading and built-in stall, either.
---
Dang. My question is, if the Switch is behind smartphones how can the switch have better graphics and run games better?
---
It's your opinion, I respect it but if you want my insight, I'm not so surprised by freddy being that high. I'm more surprised that you put freddy and hag in the same tier
---
Ghostface comes out all "Wazzzuup"
---
How is that?
---
*Laughs in TOTH* ‚ÄúNot so fast‚Äù
---
You won't be rewarded for bringing a Ebony mori. Give up
---
The entity loves to torment people
---
Ahh, gotcha. Yep, definitely just buy Spirit then. With what you've got, though, I'd go for Myers next! His power is a whole lot of fun, and the stealth potential is a nice change from the other Killers you currently have leveled up. Hag is still a good choice, too, if you're not as into the whole stealth thing.
---
Lol the amount of imbeciles applauding this on the forums is truly staggering.....I just can't even, I hope this game crashes and burns now if they actually go thru with a battle pass.  Enjoy thr extra inflated grind and a piss poof "free pass" while all the good stuff gets put behind a bigger paywall with a fucking time limit to earn...so many gullible and idiotic people truly think this will be healthy for the game
---
Imagine comparing a battle pass to genocide
---
Exactly! I feel that current Freddy is very unique in his abilities and that's part of the reason why I enjoy playing as him so much.
---
Wow that sucks. Found her totem and did 2 gens while she was chasing a good survivor, she just straight up yeeted out of the game after the 2nd gen then.
---
If they give other benefits like auric cells, or bloodpoint boosters, that'd be nice, honestly. A bit of variety over the 90% of skins you probably won't use. In regards to saying that you'll get skins for survivors or killers you don't play, they can't please everyone with a battlepass. Even if they make it for the most popular killers, you have people who main lower tier characters
---
As for the free version, honestly, I don't get why anyone would ever complain about FREE stuff. Play the game like you always do, get rewarded with some mediocre skins, or play the game and get rewarded with no additional benefits.
---
Switch Legion and Billy and this is accurate.
---
That's kinda hot
---
And that's the tea.
---
Imagine missing the point that you can replace genocide with anything negative and the point still sticks.
---
If a restaurant fucks up your order, just ignore it.
---
If a store overcharges you, just ignore it.
---
If someone invalidates your entire argument, just ignore it.
---
Plus, on a slightly different note, some people were like "Legion's power changed?? I want a refund!" while meanwhile Freddy's power is changing and most people are telling Freddy mains just to suck it up.
---
BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, and whatever you want.
---
I mean i have to disagree with the Huntress, she does know how to take care of herself.  
---
But others? I don't think so, remember what happenend to the little girls she took to her home..? They all starved to death.  
---
Also she has the mental ability of a 7 year old..  
---
Yeah...
---
No one‚Äôs defending Epic here, but you know that. You‚Äôre just trying to deflect so you don‚Äôt have to explain how the actual fuck BHVR is becoming ‚ÄúEpic 2.0‚Äù by implementing an optional Battle Pass LOL
---
b-buh.. my mommy Huntress :(
---
I mean, it sucks to get booped out of the game early, or have it end super fast because the killer chased someone for five minutes and you really have no option but to gen hump 'til the end if you want to get literally any bloodpoints, and a battlepass isn't going to make something inherently bad worse enough to warrant additional complaints. 
---
Also, most skins in the store that aren't just recolors, are auric cells exclusive. A considerable amount. There was never an overwhelming amount of unique skins able to be earned through ingame playtime(Mostly because the MTX store is fairly new)
---
You forgot the POWER GLOVE!
---
Cosmetics and grinding can be valuable additions to a game.   But when the game is just about grinding to grind more it doesn't sound so much like fun as it is q predatory mechanic that plays on your human need to evolve.  
---
Point being. If you need more grinding and more progressive systems you're not really enjoying the game you're trying to hit goals and that's how you get all the salty miserable players.
---
I admire your ability to pretend to be willfully more ignorant and stupid than you are in attempt to fatigue me from explaining the very fucking obvious...
---
Especially when your teammates are crouching there doing no gens waiting for something that‚Äôs not going to happen.
---
They have animal ears uwu
---
It‚Äôs a pain, especially because they leave that way on purpose to de-pip everyone else and deny them of any points. It happens on PS4 quite a lot too at high ranks. If the killer leaves that way they don‚Äôt de-pip so if the match is going bad for them it prevents then losing rank and punishes the rest.
---
Did you miss the part where I said it was a joke, or did you just decide to ignore it because you're in too deep with your stupidity?
---
If you can‚Äôt ignore an optional battle pass for cosmetics like the rest of the universe can, that‚Äôs on you, chief. There‚Äôs plenty of problems in the world you can‚Äôt ignore, but a Battle Pass is definitely one of them LOL
---
I play killer once every blue moon... accurate
---
If they devs can tell the difference, then there is 100% no reason to not put in an escalating timeout on those DC.
---
I meant buying your way through a battlepass is going to be insanely expensive compared to just buying that one skin you want. At least that's how the battlepass usually goes. Smite had one, and a skin would normally cost 600 gems at most, but to buy one high up on the battlepass would cost 10'000 gems
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring + Bamboozle + BBQ
---
I‚Äôll say what I want, thanks. Every update just makes it more and more discouraging to continue to play. I play literally one killer because it‚Äôs the only one I enjoy. Freddy was one of the reasons I bought the game. And I‚Äôm so sick and fucking tired of people complaining that he needs a rework when he was literally fine. It‚Äôs just idiot people who think they have to tunnel and camp to do well with him and think Ruin is the best perk to use for him. (It‚Äôs literally one of the WORST perks to run with him actually, especially now with hatch capabilities being changed.) 
---
To have to relearn a character that from the looks of it I will no longer like when it‚Äôs literally the entire reason I wanted the game in the first place? Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna be a little bit miffed. Just imagine how all the ‚ÄúDADDY MEYERS‚Äù fanboys would react if the announced a Michael rework. The only Killers that seriously need/needed reworks were Legion (thank god for that rework at least) and fucking Leatherface. Leatherface is a Killer that really can only do well with instant chainsaw, camping, tunneling, NoEd, and Ruin. (Sounds familiar...oh yeah that‚Äôs what everyone claims about Freddy when it‚Äôs not even true.)
---
There is a reason why a larger percentage of the DBD community hates LF.
---
You‚Äôre still just dodging and backpedaling because you realized you‚Äôre sounding like a goddamn moron.
---
if i was with my mates i would of just told them to forget about me and play it out
---
thats a good nurse cosplay.
---
So I have a question I was playing a game with the pig and they were face camping everyone but at the end of the match I crouched and let her get me and she let me get the hatch am I abusing her?
---
Me neither. Resigning yourself to a sexless marriage sounds like a really bad time.
---
i want my s tier dommy mommy thank you
---
Honestly I never face really good hags(I rarely see hags in the first place) but I saw really good hags and I personally played hag and surprisingly beat a lot of good swf groups. She's really strong if you know where to place your traps (you mostly want to place traps in pathways where survivors will go,playing survivor yourself can help with this) You also want to trap strong loops as previously mentioned before like the Ironworks of misery window. If you come across a pallet loop, you can simply place a trap in front of the pallet (not inside the pallet) and run in the same direction. The survivor in this situation will either run away to a different loop, or stay in the loop and try to continue it. In that case, they'll trigger the trap and have 2 options: A) drop the pallet in your face which you can then teleport and hit them,or B) they'll try to outsmart you by throwing the pallet down in your face, expecting you to teleport to your trap. If you play enough hag you can easily outsmart them in this situation. The survivor in this case is under your control and has to act according to you, not the other way around.
---
TLDR; know the maps to place traps in pathways survivors will go, and if you get to a pallet loop, just trap it and continue chasing the survivor
---
They can only sleep for short periods, perhaps? LIke microsleep, which occurs in the remake this Freddy is based off of.
---
No it doesnt???
---
It could work likeput someone to sleep and lose a charge or something
---
Doesnt mean it has to recharge
---
I dont think shadowborn is worth it. Maybe u wanna try discordance so u can stop genrushing and amd maybe get some snipe shoots.
---
100%
---
dont forget the syringe, and the DC once they're hit with NOED/Rancor.
---
His powerlevel broke the scanner!
---
Facts: we know nothing about what's actually in store and as far as we know this could have been something they were trying out in private and realized wasn't a good idea and won't be implementing it but accidentally leaked it.
---
Jesus Christ. All you guys do is spoil chapter releases and complain about things that haven't even been confirmed. Stfu already
---
https://i.redd.it/0xq9j3321ce11.jpg
---
Well im just one guy. Might as well do the best I can personally do.
---
Cool you want a cookie
---
Yep. I only read vanity in this post.
---
2v8 please
---
"English"
---
i thought this was going 2 be a meme, but this is genuinely a dbd ref. Just goes to show how big the game is outside of the US
---
I just realised lol
---
How do I change it lmao
---
I don‚Äôt
---
its terrible. there's a reason you don't see people use it. by the time he hits tier 3 with that theres 4-5 gens already done and barely any pallets used. 
---
if you know you're going against people that are going to stand out in the open afk for a minute or two it could work though.
---
Spirit with skirt.
---
Prestige 2 Leatherface blackface head cosmetic.
---
Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, and Spirit Fury works for most killers.
---
Shh, its alright. There is always more fish to fry.
---
See this guy GETS it
---
I quite like rocket league‚Äôs system.
---
How do you expect such a company to continually grow and provide fixes, content, and original ideas without a logical business model that allows for them to gain some form of capital. If nobody buys cosmetics or dlc, then there is absolutely no money flowing through when you can get the game for free or as low as $5. If this community is really invested in the devs working hard to add fixes, balancing, and worthwhile content, which many people seem to constantly ask for, they need accept the fact that the game cannot be sustained for growth without a reliable model that has been historically successful for other companies. The only practice that is actually a scam is loot crates. If the devs ever implement this system, then there cause for outcry.
---
We should have screamed this
---
Really hope they have an ace up their sleeve and the whole live stream isn't about all the stuff that got leaked.
---
&gt;Being forced to invest time rather than a one time easy purchase for a set price of the default 5-10$
---
You aren't forced into anything, if you don't like the stuff that is in the pass then you can purchase the skins from the shop, never having to interact with the pass.
---
&gt;I still stand by the fact that people turn into dicks when there's anything other than regular gameplay(Sucking flowers dry in front of teammates, camping hooks, sabotaging hooks, etc.)
---
That's fair, but it's more of the community's fault than the game's. In the same vein we shouldn't ever have any events because people will be meaner during them, either we bear with these unpleasantries or we never get any events.
---
The skin he has. Devil.
---
It works for me and it gets you a lot of points
---
Maybe raise the bloodpoint cap per game?
---
Ds sucks now tho
---
*‚ÄôAccidentally‚Äô triggers Hag trap*
---
genius move to make one yourself.
---
But I share your opinion
---
Sure, getting rushed out of a match is never fun, whether it's through generators or kills. It's kind of the only objective for each side though, so it doesn't make sense to take it personally or get tilted over it.
---
Hey I have seen this one before
---
He deleted his own build lol Sprint Burst trumps all other exhaustion perks
---
Yea ik I put a lot of effort into it
---
Sure.  
---
But there's also the side of it that it takes them months to get fixes out.  It was surprising they got the hotfix out for the generator issue, but that is the exception, not the rule.  
---
With them having such a demanding DLC schedule, they are pushing out content that is obviously not well QC'd.  And this compounds the bugs that were already present.  So instead of some bugs that get squashed for the most part with a DLC release, they now have a mountain of bugs with fixes coming few and far between.  
---
And before you say "It takes a lot of time to fix bugs, it's not usually a database change blah blah blah" I realize this.  But they are taking the route of Friday the 13th -- Push out cosmetic content to ca$h in fast with $DLC$ coming as a second priority, with bug fixes a distant third or fourth.
---
Accurate.  Mike, wraith, and clown are all super fun to play against even when losing. I rarely see DCs against them.
---
I mean yeah
---
I dont DC against killers, but Legion, despite being "fixed" is still anti-fun.
---
 Where on the tier list would you place her?
---
Glad ash memes are popular since he is in dbd
---
I'm not saying it's the game's fault, I'm saying that events turn people into the worst DBD has to offer, and that's really the only reason I'm personally opposed to a battlepass. Personally, I like battlepasses. I was merely saying why I suspect people to not all be onboard. I don't even mind if it limits exclusives behind playtime. Sure it'll suck to not get certain skins, but honestly, I like certain skins to be exclusive, just as a badge that you've been around for at least that long. Of course, I prefer those to be shorter events, but that's just how it is sometimes
---
"I'm indicating, why won't anyone come rescue me?!"
---
- Some idiot that thinks he can actually tell from the hook when it's safe to rescue, and not just if he's being camped.
---
It's just the community in general to be frank.
---
Much like how people don't enjoy fortnite, everyone is miserable, and they only play it to unlock the level 100 benefit right? that's why nobody ever plays the game after they hit 100? 
---
People who were going to focus on **only** the grinding were never going to play the game for a long time anyway, so your point of it only being for fun, is invalid anyway, there not being any point to continue playing asides from them enjoying it means they weren't/aren't playing anyway.
---
Also, it's just cosmetics, there is no *need* to grind, it's just a "hey, you've been playing for a while, good on you! here's a hat" or something like that, I'm not saying we remove every perk, and force you to buy some battle pass to grind out and unlock them. The battle pass is a completely, off to the side thing that you can opt into, and simply get rewards for playing the game **like you would be anyway, since you enjoy it so much**. 
---
Like I said in every other comment, I **already enjoy the game, I have fun playing it, I don't know how much you expect me to repeat that**. I am simply not against the idea, of having another system, that I can offer more money to the devs, in exchange for getting rewarded for playing the game, like I do anyways. This isn't going to suddenly make me despise DBD anymore than the toxic fucking community does, which is the real goddamn problem, It would only add to my enjoyment, and if I didn't want to support the battle pass by buying/opting into it, **it wouldn't affect me at all**.
---
But I can tell that's just not going to matter, and we are never going to agree, so have a nice day.
---
Glad I am single
---
Quality content here.
---
One question; how would you rate the individual members of Legion assuming they're all single?
---
Frank: D tier. Jealous type with anger issues.
---
Julie: C tier. Basic chick, average.
---
Joey: A tier. He's the VIP member in game for a reason.
---
Susie: A tier. Just so damn adorable.
---
I wouldnt say it sucks. It is really useful against tunnlers and campers. And in combination with deliverance its extremely strong. I stopped counting how many facecampers ive defeated with these perks
---
T-ear list
---
Of course I'm gonna laugh at you when you throw a childish tantrum over something that hasn't even been showed in detail and then when somebody calls you out on it you go and write an essay about how the game sucks and everything's horrible now, but in reality it's because YOU don't like how things are. Get over yourself.
---
Alright here you go üç™
---
Why isn't it? I absolutely destroyed the game. The survivors stood no chance to escape. I didn't choose to play against inferior players. The game decided it was a good idea for me to do so.
---
I can't see any indication of their skill in the lobby. I have no way of knowing if these survivors are going to waste my time playing a game that's not worth the minuscule points I get for killing them all because they zerged the first hook and they all died on their first hook.
---
A 4k, no matter how you get it, should be rewarded properly
---
As survivor, an escape that you contributed to should also be rewarded properly. If I get 2 gens done on my own, and 3 survivors escape, I should get points for contributing to their escapes. If I'm looping the killer for 3 gens and then get face camped and die, but the other 3 survivors get out, I should be rewarded for keeping the Killer's attention for most of the game.
---
You don't need bloodpoints if your claudette is already p3
---
You can juke the killer around for the entirety of the 3 minutes and die regardless, because once you're spotted, you're 100% dead. You don't even have to be caught. The killer just has to keep you in a line of sight and boom, dead. Whispers? Well fuck, you can't even get to hatch because they'll follow your general location, and if you get close to it, so will they
---
Are you really gonna do this in every single comment I make?
---
Nice straw man, not once did I ever say anything in favor of pay 2 win. Didn‚Äôt know cosmetics grant competitive advantage I guess! Funny how some idiots still upvoted you so I guess your argument twisting worked
---
What game is that?
---
Honestly takes no skill to face camp in the basement as a bubba. Especially with Insidious. It's the cheapest and most unrewarding/toxic gameplay in the game and idc if this gets down voted for me stating a FACT.
---
*Sees another survivor gets injured as I unhook*
---
*Survivor runs off into the distance even though the killer's literally out of bounds for 5 minutes*
---
"Welp, guess you're dying again"
---
It‚Äôs nice to have everyone and have no restrictions on who to play. I grind Duels mostly, but yeah I run Breach to finish Orders mostly. I forgot the OG characters are all 500 steel, but the Y1‚Äôs and the Harbingers are still pretty costly
---
How the fuck you are able to leave the paint mover in the last panel???
---
I respectfully disagree
---
Grazie a entrambi ;D
---
It's just a live stream whats the big deal.
---
You would put doctor on the same rank as nurse?
---
for what it's worth, i enjoyed it. Would love to see some more, but with Spirit :)
---
What are you talking about?
---
I play both killer and survivor I‚Äôm  never too toxic I will message a trapper ‚Äúgood trap placement‚Äù and will let last survivor leave through hatch if there not to toxic
---
No I wasn‚Äôt, but idc enough to even explain myself
---
To be honest, you don't even have to play awful for 90% of the game, but noed pops and the killer now gets a merciless because survivors are altruistic. If you play poorly, a 4K shouldn't immediately grant you a merciless just because a number says so
---
No, just some. And this was only the second comment that I responded to so don't get your panties twisted.
---
Fuck, I didn't see that. I used the snipping tool to take a picture of the meme in paint.
---
Looks like a law suit to me.
---
I can see one Survivor. If they're SWF, the entire team knows exactly what I'm doing pretty much at all times.
---
I need to remove OoO from the match to stamd a decent chance.
---
bro shadowborn is nasty!  I can see what you mean bc logically you have 4 perk slots so you're trying to figure what is best in the limited space but I see more, hit more hatchets, it looks like I move faster, it slightly brightens my screen, and yea lol. I agree that you can totally play without it but I made the mistake of playing with it now I feel I play with blinders on when i don't have it lol.
---
Yes, fortnite is so great. That's why they've been under investigation and sued over predatory systems like loot boxes....  Is this the direction we want from the industry? Make one half baked product designed to live the next ten years on vile micro transactions that take advantage of consumers?  Yeah no thanks 
---
It's not a good thing.
---
&gt; I used the snipping tool to take a picture of the meme in paint.
---
why not just use paint to save ?
---
Just played a game where I beelined to ruin at the start, and sure enough, it was dead before I could get to it. It spawned in the corner, meaning the survivor likely spawned right on top of it, because the cleanse time alone was basically my travel time to it
---
Actually the 3rd time
---
And oh boi you still salty over my comment in youe horrible speculation
---
1k hours, the majority of them at red ranks, makes anyone a bit "done" with SWF bullshit.
---
I absolutely adore Bruce Campbell, having a reason to meme him makes me feel warm inside.
---
Only people that will down vote are the people who do it I haven‚Äôt encountered a insidious bubba player since playstation this broke my heart
---
Thank you for teaching me these ways, I've been getting face camped constantly lately. On ps4, it take 15 minutes to get a survivor game and 1 minute to get a killer game, so waiting that 15 minutes just to get face camped makes me more than a little salty lol.
---
Ok, but this game has 4 final girls/boys and the odds are in your favor
---
Powering through means that whether you can or can't hit ruin skillchecks, you just hump the shit out of it until it inevitably pops. You'll rarely ever get a generator that regresses more than it progresses(It's really bad luck if you get like 10 of them on a single generator)
---
They did. If you didn't receive an email yet then you didn't get accepted this time :(.
---
Maybe think about how something you type can be ambiguous before calling someone personality shit
---
Blurry Image is the killer
---
If I downed everyone and just watched them bleed out on the ground I should get max rewards.
---
If I hid in a locker until gens were done then camped the hatch while the others died and got out I should get max rewards.
---
the merciless killer conditions of just being a 4k was already done in this game and it wasn't healthy and led to uninteractive matches a lot of the time, there was a reason it was changed.
---
Let me start by saying a counter should significantly always help a match-up when it's brought. Some actual counters include calm spirit for doctor, urban evasion/a flashlight for hag's traps, spine chill for stealth killers.
---
&gt; break line of sight/ dead hard
---
https://youtu.be/cvF4vgiWvyo
---
In this video, the nurse finds a player before they can react to hearing the blink sound. Good luck hiding here! Several players here run dead hard, it helps but it's hardly a counter. Once you know they have dead hard you can just wait for them to use it or attack when you're close enough.
---
https://youtu.be/zC95erbNX1g
---
Spawns near nurse, there is no input that survivor could have done to avoid getting hit in the first 20 seconds of the game. No other killer besides maybe huntress can do this.
---
Lockers could work with Quick and Quiet I guess. Need to fool the killer for that, which is less of a counter and more out playing them. Doesn't work if you're already injured due to the blood trail.
---
Good nurses are too powerful compared to the rest of the cast.
---
Pigs only tunnel when I play vs them :(
---
I assumed the best intentions, so I reciprocated with kindness.
---
I'm against the idea of "needing approval" from bhvr, they shouldn't have a monopoly on this type of game, new ideas come from taking old ones and changing them
---
Everybody, act surprised!
---
(Also, it's GhostFace)
---
Is it likely there will be an Event for the Anniversary? It‚Äôs been nearly 5 months since the last one.
---
Yeah one game i saw a guy play as ash and I thought for no reason must make ash survive
---
I agree. With deliverance it is very good
---
This is honestly terrible. Just feels so cheap and the lack of anyway to escape the killer really sucks. If they find you, you basically die as only ‚Äòdoors‚Äô can stop them but there‚Äôs not that many on a map and most ‚ÄòPsychos‚Äô just break them all at the start.
---
Also it has constant time gates, no thank you
---
A power that has a limit on how much you can use it? That doesn't sound right to me, I'm probably misinterpreting you.
---
Nurse
---
Billy/spirit
---
Huntress
---
Hag
---
This is my opinion ofc, it ain't wrong or right, you feel?
---
Oink. I see nothing wrong here.
---
Let‚Äôs just not speak at all, in fact censor everything because some asshole might take it the wrong way and try to get offended
---
Jesus I hope you find some fun in life
---
It would be cool but it would seriously handicap his current power, if this is the case it would need some serious buffs. Either way, theres no real way to keep track of 4 survivors with one bar so...
---
Yep. If I see the hook break and them run, you know damn well I'm running with them
---
How about:
---
If a survivor attempts to rescue while in the terror radius of the killer, they are prompted with a difficult skill check. If they fail the skill check, they fail to unhook and lose one health state, however, if performed successfully, the survivor is rescued and the hook is broken upon rescue. Does not work in basements.
---
60 second cool down.
---
This is kinda offtopic but there will almost certainly be some sort of event because there was one the last 2 years, theres also datamined files to back it up.
---
Play Russian Roulette Spirit!
---
so if yall remember the movies, the general comeback theme in those movies was the kids realizing that they needed to pull him from the dream world and fight him in the real world. 
---
what if he has a gauge where he comes out of the dream world?  he cant sleep people at that point but he can do everything all other killers can i.e. interrupt gens, gates, etc.  
---
obv balance it appropriately but i wouldnt be against it. 
---
 start the game as a 0 terr radius  being able to sleep people.   once you fulfill certain reqs  he can come out of the dream world.  maybe he can switch between the 2 but that may be too good?
---
&gt;If someone dies on 3 hooks in the span of 1 minute, you're an asshole. That's all i can say about that i guess
---
How am I being an asshole if a survivor dies on 3 hooks in the span of 1 minute? Should I just let him go and then proceed to lose the game? If the guy makes himself easily a target I will down him, eliminate him from the game, and proceed with one less survivor to worry about. And yes I do play both sides, even so I have no incentive in letting every survivor get a pip or let them max out their Boldness points or something before I down them lmao. This game is designed around winning in order to rank up, not ensuring that everyone in the lobby has the most amount of fun possible... Get real.
---
I‚Äôm just saying you‚Äôre setting yourself up for disappointment if you wait all that time to play on PC and find it‚Äôs just as toxic as Xbox, if not more so.
---
I feel like quick and quiet is pretty underrated. It's so good specially when you already have a good lead on a killer
---
Yeah nemesis would be amazing.
---
The area looks eerile similar to a kindergarten I worked in. Kind of want that as a map now, where children will occasionally giggle, as opposed to the drumming happening in the background that makes you question if it's a heartbeat
---
oh okay i gotchu. i feel like it‚Äôll be easier without a 30 fps cap though?
---
why does huntress have hooves..
---
Clearly, its showing the average dbd match
---
It really saddens me when I see a survivor alone, because his teammates dced or something do the "come here" motion and just points at a hook. Can't bring myself to do it
---
Play With Your Food is good for the Infinite T3+Tombstone Myers build so you can be fast AF, but outside of that I don't see it having much use since you're constantly having to stab people to down them and lose tokens, you'd be better off taking BBQ AND Ruin rather than PwyF
---
Bow chica wow wow
---
Most wraiths I play against will just camp because of 100% invisibility, and the salt farming commences
---
Do you enjoy necroing
---
Look, anything that isn't announce is a spoiler, some people like to be subscribed and don't want to know anything about any speculation correct or not. It's no extra effort or hassle for you, so why do you care if someone may benefit from this.
---
Thank you. Sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to hijack I just found the first post relating to the video to ask.
---
Slugging is not an easy thing to pull off, again, unless you're playing potatoes. So, yeah, let em die on the ground.
---
Also I said contributing. Read.
---
I don't think I've seen any DC's as soon as they hear the chainsaw revving, or even after seeing me play billy. Sure, when they go down, there's a-plenty, but surprisingly, I don't encounter many DC's when playing him.
---
What do you mean it would make things easier? I guess I don't really see why it matters after you're already P3 50.
---
Its not a scam. You get tona of cosmetics and shit. 10 for like 20 cosmetics even ones you have to grind for (going to be playing the game anyway so may as well be rewarded.) You know exactly what you are getting. Dont want it don't get it. He is being downvoted because its not a scam. I am not entirely convinced either of you know what the word actually means. I dont mean that in a rude way. I just dont think you are using the word properly.
---
Mkay
---
Major reveals and a glimpse of the fredddy rework.
---
The last 3 pigs I went up against tunneled one player at a time and didn‚Äôt even use their traps.
---
I hope that‚Äôs not the change they are doing and just a mistake ... the dream world is perfect for him. 
---
Outside of the reboot, which I only watched once, I don‚Äôt recall anytime where Freddy was visible in the real world except for when the brought him out. And in that wouldn‚Äôt work with the mechanics in this game.
---
What a prick.
---
It's fine. I don't mind but expect to be down voted.
---
I actually like the tier lists lol
---
This will sound weird but what offering are you using
---
Doing gods work my guy, many thanks ^^
---
That doesn't mean you don't have to kill them tho. Also you can just play with them a bit before actually killing them (still lorewise).
---
Why are you booing him? He‚Äôs right.
---
That‚Äôs the problem you can‚Äôt rank up if the survivors are trash
---
Bloodpoints used to be the pipping condition, until the victory cube was released in like early 2018?
---
Hooking gave you points, one point per stage. It would encourage camping at the end of the game, but I wouldnt say it really encouraged camping anytime else, since youd be better off just hooking more survivors
---
I find borrowed time to be more annoying than dead hard. Sometimes you're just bound to be near the hook when they unhook, and then they'll bodyblock save their teammate with borrowed time
---
Did you take any screenshot?
---
You don't see it as a good deal. Fine, don't buy it. But I don't see why you're upset about it.
---
What would be a good fourth? I was thinking sloppy butcher.
---
Thanks so much! More DBD characters are certainly on the agenda- Ash is likely next in line, but I‚Äôll likely branch off into other characters.
---
Would‚Äôve likely kept going if Bruce Campbell was down for it would it have not?
---
Who tf down votes this?
---
Cant wait for Dead by Daylight 3.
---
Or a barrel... Or a tire stack... Or a rock... Or anything else that can possibly block ur way
---
Idk, I just have always used snipping tool and I thought saving just saves it as a paint file, not an image.
---
I find it's mixed. Freddy against SWF will just get shitstomped, but a nurse against 4 solos will be the polar opposite. Maps, ruin spawn(If you use that) and who you go against will always be the deciding factor on which side is favoured. Das just how the game goes
---
Puppers!
---
If there's only 1 or 2 gens left and I've got adrenaline, I won't really heal, but if someone is following me around to heal me, I'll see how long they'll run around behind me trying to get their heal. üòÇ
---
I'll give them the heal of course, because I know how satisfying it can be.
---
Nope, the show was cancelled first, then Bruce said he wasn‚Äôt interested in reprising the role again in response to the fans asking if there was any chance for the show to come back.
---
did you even look at the post
---
Sounds fun
---
Sounds like a fun time
---
Ahh makes sense. I mean he‚Äôs done it quite a bit so it‚Äôs understandable
---
I will nod if a survivor does something blatantly stupid(I.E vaults a window into me, loop towards me, or just run into me in one way or another), and I will hit things if I know they screwed the survivor up, or because the hitbox was blatant BS, even from my perspective. Not to BM, more to just say 'Yeah, that happened'
---
This has been a "thing" for some time now. Raising and lowering your arms quickly means the Killer is very close. Still a good post since I still many people not understand this.
---
WEAK FREE COSMETICS TO GRIND FOR - WAY BETTER STUFF TO PAY FOR AND GRIND FOR. ITS ANOTHER VOTE FOR GAMING DEVELOPERS TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH OF MICROTRANSACTION NONSENSE. FROM AN OLD GUY WHO REMEMBERED GAMING BEFORE THIS TYPE OF STUFF. THERE'S BETTER WAYS TO MONETIZE YOUR GAME. THERE'S BETTER WAYS TO SUPPORT DEVELOPERS.
---
That's not what a spoiler is you ingrate lol
---
So you just want everything for free with no effort? 2019 gamers people the next generation
---
Because you have big dumb
---
The hit animation has to finish. If you get adrenaline AS you're going down, the killer will get a notifaction that you're back up again and can guarantee the follow up wack. It's more situationally lucky/unlucky than actual awareness
---
Still happens. Had it happen on the exact same pallet in back to back games yesterday. ( one of the pallets near Basement on The Game map)
---
I dig it. Good job!
---
Yup and all I see is a butthurt leftest who thinks he sees something that‚Äôs not really there. Lmao if you dislike it so much stop playing the game
---
It gives you so much extra time in jungle gyms
---
You can watch the Kings video on leaked stuff. It‚Äôs basically just individual character stories. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs real though.
---
I phrased it as close to the survey as I could! I used a few screenshots from the survey to try and recreate it as accurately as possible. I'm hoping this will yield interesting results
---
Lets hope for the best! 
---
I apologise for the semi-aggresive tone of my first message, I got the wrong idea from your comment.
---
What will the rewards be? If there's exclusive stuff then I'll be pissed off I didn't get in.
---
i wish i kept getting myers! i only ever see nurse, hillbilly, and huntress. occasionally spirit
---
WHILE I AGREE ITS A SHITTY MODEL WE GET FREE STUFF REGARDLESS AND I MEAN YOU CANT GET MUCH WORSE THAN SOME COSMETICS ALREADY ARE
---
weeb
---
I can‚Äôt be too upset with him. I doubt they were going to bring it back regardless of his comment. And 3 seasons is more than I ever expected to spend with Ash anyway.
---
Damn, I didn't have that bug for at least a year and even tried to trigger it. I really thought they've removed it
---
It's also damn easy to get a 4k with certain builds. Knockout and Nurse's Calling on Nurse being an example. And unless you run otherwise bad perks as a survivor you aren't winning that.
---
‚Äúwhen the match doesn‚Äôt go my way i disconnect!‚Äù
---
Why in the world would you think this?
---
It's like having a fire alarm go off when there is no smoke detected and go silent when there is a fire.
---
As of now, you can calculate how many bloodweb youve been through by adding up all the perks you have depending on their tier. I don't wanna go through this every time I wanna see. It would just make it easier to see. Why it matters for me as of right now: I have a killer who I'm positive I've been through at least 115 bloodwebs so far and haven't gotten a single tier of bbq. Itd just make it easier to see, and it would only be a nice little feature to have that wouldn't be negative for anyone
---
So your saying adding Claudette turns a boring game into a superpowered one?
---
so true..;(''''''
---
Yeah, we know it.
---
This is probably the 5th post about it since the video got released.
---
Same. Tier list are fun and spark discussion more than a lot of other posts. Like people just posting a random rant about NOED or teabaggers.
---
It warrants a nerf, because the killers it affects the most are the ones that get absolutely gutted by extra chase time. Billy, nurse and even huntress can easily avoid it and are great killers. Wraith, Freddy and most other M1 killers who are already fairly weak are never going to win a 4 man mettle of man game against even remotely competent survivors. 
---
If anything, I'd rather it gives stacks on insta-downs and only requires two stacks total, and regardless of health state, the third insta-down will be avoided
---
/s ?
---
I was thinking of doing some screenshots in GMOD. Idk how to use SFM.
---
You dont have sex every day when youre married maybe not even because you dont want to. There are many variables. 
---
Its hard to understand until it happens to you I guess.
---
Dumb question but, why wasnt the mobile game actually called Dead By Daylight?  Did another studio release a knock off or?  What is this Horrorfield I'm looking at.
---
Well this really has me thinking now. Thanks for sharing this really interesting piece of information.
---
Hmm
---
It's the internet. Messages are misunderstood at literally every turn. Based on how you made it fairly apparent you thought I was against just playing the game, I figured you misunderstood, so I elaborated to clarify. No hard feelings, battlepasses are a sensitive topic and people are likely to defend the side they prefer, which I understand completely
---
you can if you use that to your advantage instead of just rushing kills
---
The more I see of this thing the more I actually start to hate it.
---
it is also funny how players compare Adrenaline to NOED (still, i don't have any problem with NOED as both survivor and killer main) while Adrenaline awards survivors fpr doing the objective and NOED awards the killer for playing terrible and not putting enough pressure on survivors
---
They used to live on a diet of pure, concentrated salt. I agree completely
---
I'm afraid. I he needing was some quality of life, survivors can't do things while in dream transition, self care doesn't wake you up, etc. But now it's confirmed with the clip from the anniversary video that he is likely being changed substantially.
---
The best alternative would be if they had a new and old freddy like you said, I don't even care if they didn't give the old one some qoa, I just don't want to run the risk of losing that unique gameplay.
---
Yeah lol, had a dude rage the killer in chat for that last game
---
The problem isn't the battle pass
---
Is my thin ass wallet
---
You have a good day too! I agree that people should quit arguing about the balancing. Alrhought a SWF with all 4 having Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Mettle of Man, and some other thing is unbalanced.
---
I don't know, but Thats what I was told and that's what I have followed, and so far that's what everyone else I've encountered seems to think it means. 
---
Definitely should straighten this out though..
---
The only thing I can say about that is that legions power didn't change that much, he is effectively the same killer, you just can't play him like a piece of shit like you could before.
---
But freddy looks like hes gonna be almost entirely new, which is super scary.
---
Did you dig this game play out of the files? Impressive find. (sarcasm lvl 100)
---
Adrenaline is so situational it honestly just gives me a MS bonus to get to the gate most of the time. When I do escape from the killer because of it, it's usually useless because they have NOED. I'm honestly tired of people whining about adrenaline when survivors keep getting nerfs (although some ARE justified) and yet it's never enough apparently.
---
"But it gives you a one free health state!!!" Well, that's the fucking point of the perk.
---
Maybe the entire game is in the dream world, they have to sleep to i guess
---
he got got so hard that he doesn‚Äôt even realize he‚Äôs been had
---
looking forward to it my man!
---
Okay
---
bruh are you rarted. OP clearly means the "lmao gottem" not the "4chan trolling normies with WP symbol".
---
damn bhvr are some s a v a g e s
---
Pig ears OP, plz nerf
---
Dammit...I had a seizure!!! ARGH!!!!
---
I live in Europe, and I have never encountered a genuinely nice killer(Even finding killers who don't straight up tunnel you is rare). Statistics would suggest that most if not all nice killers are probably canadian
---
Well, another clip suggests hitting someone wakes them up, which is accurate but...oh. Idea. What if being in his terror radius makes you fall asleep? Would be a good throwback to the movies, and would remove one of his weaknesses: not being able to find survivors. Sorta like the Doctor, and also like the Doctor, he can just manually put them to sleep. Although, working out certain kinks so they're unique from each other.
---
Well why can't we be the intro to a slasher, where everyone gets slaughtered in minutes before the actual gang shows up? Damn modern slashers nowadays
---
Instead of Tyrant use Jack Baker, Wesker or Nemesis.
---
Hey it‚Äôs  just trying to help you out no need to insult its appearance.
---
I wasn't the one making the speculation, I just called you out on your behavior. So not only are you an asshole and a pedantic, but you're also stupid as well. Congratulations.
---
Definitely, slow healing with nurses‚Äô would be amazing.
---
I've been there üòÇ though EGC fixed the problem since a minimum number of gens aren't needed for hatch escapes anymore.
---
apparently you're not going to get that in that particular match up. so again, why not take advantage of it?
---
Honestly, I would say the contrary
---
Great

TIME FOR A NEW MODEL THEN. DEV NEED TO UP THE QUALITY OF THE COSMETICS AND DROP THE PRICE. $6 FOR NEW HAIR? $12 FOR AN OUTFIT? NOPE. BATTLE PASS WILL JUST BE MORE GARBAGE COSMETICS WITH SOME AMAZING ONES MIXED IN. THERE'S MANY WAYS TO FIX THIS GAME / ADD REVENUE SO IT KEEPS GOING. BATTLE PASS IS NOT IT. WANT TO SEE THIS GAME SUCCEED AND RUN FOR AWHILE AS I JUST GOT INTO IT. AS IT STANDS NOW I'M ALWAYS PEEKING INTO THE STORE TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN ANY CHANGES AND LEAVING EMPTY HANDED SINCE THE WHOLE SYSTEM HAS ME BOTHERED. I'M TRYING TO SUPPORT YOU GUYS BUT YOU MAKE IT SO HARD. (I BOUGHT AND OWN ALL PD2 DLC) WE WILL SEE! PEACE!
---
Maybe his TR is now the dreamworld
---
Ah, okay. I keep thinking tiers affect more than they actually do.
---
slugging is easier than hooking, it takes substantially more time to pick someone off the ground than it is to unhook them, they still have a timer to death of bleeding out, and a killer can easily capitalize on it with just a few perks, deerstalker or nurse's calling for example. There's a reason it gives fuck all points if someone dies for bleed out.
---
I did read, you want max bloodpoints for doing the bare minimum of work on either side. there are 4 different categories for both killer and survivor for a reason, to promote not putting effort into the game and still hoping for 2pip 32k bp matches.
---
Later in the video they show Freddy picking up an awake survivor from the survivor's POV, and Freddy is visible.
---
GMOD, whilst being easier to use, is slightly sloppier when it comes to presentation- hence why essentially every single GMOD movie you see on YouTube is more humorous, comedic and most importantly wacky, as GMOD lends itself more to that style. SFM, whilst being a little harder to use (honestly, it‚Äôs not as hard as it may initially seem), is better at delivering more serious and cleaner artwork and movies. 
---
For a quick tutorial on posing  from Valve themselves, watch 1:49 onwards of [this video.](https://youtu.be/iEz7TslI-fs)
---
One thing that comes to my head is that the charge up starts at 0 and when it reaches full you can leave the dream world for a period of time. It would be really cool because you can have the tracking and stall of the sleeping power but then also the ability to instantly hit someone if you need to, maybe with some bonus powers when you leave to make people scared, kinda like when plague gets corrupt or myers hits t3
---
Wew lad either we've been wooshed by you or you've gone off your rocker lol
---
You know what, I forgot about the FPS thing. I haven‚Äôt played on pc in a few months and I‚Äôve gotten used to Xbox lol. So yeah, I guess that would be easier. I think the scratch marks last longer on PC because of the FPS though. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer or if it really makes much difference
---
&gt;I did read
---
Apparently not if you think I want max points for minimal effort.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Yup, don't support games getting worse.
---
I shall change my tactics then. Perhaps we need to have a huge PSA post directed at those PS4 players or rather, I think I'm just getting paired up with people off of Reddit and who are assuming signals, ultimately making them switched and wrong.
---
Genuinely what I was told is that by "dancing", or flapping in your case, you're showing you need to escape, and by doing so the coast is clear, whereas if there was an enemy you would stay still.
---
My apologies for having it backwards, but even with that I couldn't explain to you where the confinement came from or why majority of players I've met have treated this way like law over the other way.
---
The bloodweb is a relic of the past when you had far less killers and survivors to grind through. Now there's over 120 killer perks. If you want to grind up P3 all perks, we're talking 320+ bloodwebs PER killer. I think survivors are in the same region. It doesn't help that sometimes you have to go up into 90+ bloodwebs to get the perks you want if you're really unlucky. Even when I was starting out, it took me until the very last perk I could get, to get BBQ T3 on Bubba
---
People will still DC/stand still as soon as they see a legion lmao
---
It already is
---
The reason is 'bloodpoints economy' - Giving more bloodpoints means more chances of i-head huntresses, tuft of hair myers, omegablink nurses and insta-saw billies. Honestly, I'd just like it if they gave the chance to get more than ONE perk per bloodweb, with an average of at least two if you just path out correctly. That would make the grind considerably less tedious
---
Lol I'd rather not waste my time with a shitty game when I can actually have fun playing competent competition
---
Uh yes. One of the several flaws with NOED's design is that it fucks over solo survivors, and the groups on voice comms can handle it much easier. 
---
Totem counter should exist.
---
Of course I have but chemical X was never meant to be added. Thus a mistake.
---
then you have no reason to complain you aren't ranking up
---
We don't have ANY details regarding the pass.
---
If the pass comes out and it has no point/shard rewards (so no pay 2 win advantage), doesn't make the skins more expensive in the shop/doesn't have exclusives that can't be purchased from the shop and is cosmetics only, then I don't think there is anything wrong with it.
---
&gt;This game is already grindy enough anyway, adding to it would be horrible.
---
Difference being that you aren't grinding for perks/add ons, you are earning cosmetics and this grind tied with the first one, so you are doing both of those things at once. It's just more rewards for the grind that you are already doing when you are leveling/getting add ons. 
---
Plus you can completely avoid it if you don't care about it.
---
Or maybe that's your escape plan...
---
But one that makes the result better
---
The Hag's claw at [1:20](https://youtu.be/5JNlTD0I7UM&amp;#t=80s) looked weird too. 
---
That's not how she holds it or lunges.
---
Yeah you right.
---
Because everyone unhooks me in the terror radius when I'm the obsession.
---
FIFY
---
Ah ok, honestly I've never played a game with a battlepass in it so I have no real opinion on it, but I can say for sure, people are seriously exaggerating this.
---
Run bond instead. Get healed faster, know where to not go when being chased, and always get to co op gens.
---
That's a tactic though. You gotta rush the final gen. Are they not supposed to get gens done? lol. On average, you should have people killed before the final gen even pops and applying pressure to others. wanna counter them rushing the final gen? Use discordance/surveillance. Use combos such as Bitter Murmur and NOED. There are easily counters to it but people wanna run meta when they're not good enough to run meta.
---
I was fefering to the comment in your thread
---
But why bother arguing with a child
---
You think you are right soo yea
---
Congrats you are correct, tomorrow well take you to six flags to celebrate
---
If I had to guess, maybe Freddy needs to fill the gauge first before being able to manifest himself in the "real world" so he can hit survivors and until then he might be still in the "dream world" and invisible. 
---
Just a wild guess
---
literally no one knows besides the devs, wait until they reveal it and then youll know.
---
Play with your food then. If I know they‚Äôre bad. I basically walk away from people so they can unhook their friends. It gives them hope and it gives me a 2 pip
---
I'm pretty sure that's a clip from when she came out
---
Happens so often it hurts
---
The point of a double pip is that the killer was much better than the survivors and as a result should be ranked up faster. Whether or not the current ranking system fulfills this I can't say for sure but there is a huge difference between instantly killing everyone and just barely getting the last survivor.
---
Yea I love how us killers bitch about the extra health state yet we have numerous killers, add ons, and moris that down/kill you instantly.
---
I'd want a video of that. never happend to me
---
My mood depending on killer, ascending
---
Holy shit these posts are annoying.
---
Wait until the reveal FFS, is not that far away.
---
I‚Äôm not :(
---
And it got buffed
---
(Something which shouldn't be, but is a) Controversial opinion: **This is how you are supposed to play killer.** 
---
It is perfectly possible to pip up all the way to red ranks by playing to the skill level of the survivors in your games and trying to create a fun experience for everyone. Usually that means letting some people escape while others die heroically. Being able to exert extreme pressure from being able to play in red ranks  means you can make any situation overwhelmingly intense. Being able to realize that you're essentially the DM of a horror game means that you can tone it down enough for people to feel heroic and skillful. (If they are the bold type) Or to let them feel stealthy and evasive (if they are the fearful/sneaking type). That's why most people started playing this game in the first place: to experience that sensation. 
---
I try to do this every single game I play as killer. If I get some 1k+ hour players, I go hard to keep them engaged. If I get 400- hour players, it's kiddie gloves. Why not? The game is meant to be fun for everyone. The fun part of playing killer is trying to invent new ways to involve your players on the fly before they all escape. 
---
Methodically grinding through map resources and optimally running every tile, giving up any chase that will go to bloodlust... That's just boring. It feels robotic and sociopathic. After you've learned how to chase every tile, it's an act of going through the motions. I've never understood why people find that fun. 
---
Good on you, OP. You've figured out how to play DbD the right way.
---
This made me uwu so hard
---
U sure u didn't watch the wrong movie
---
What if one day a glitch leaks through that causes exit gates to not spawn? Drake and Josh would have a field day.
---
&gt;Are they not supposed to get gens done? lol
---
You're completely missing the point. My comment brought up the fact that people will purposefully ignore *healing*, an objective that they're supposed to do or else face the danger of getting one-shot by the killer, to get a free insta-heal and speed boost (and free wake up vs Freddy...) when they finish the last gen. 
---
Also, I noticed you didn't respond to the Freddy issue at all.
---
&gt;people wanna run meta when they're not good enough to run meta
---
The irony of saying people aren't good enough to run meta when the whole conversation is about people are running Adrenaline (a meta perk), lmao.
---
I was actually talking about this yesterday that would be kinda cool like 2 killers and 8 survivors, would be a really cool different dynamic haha 
---
Like imagine Michael Myers and ghost face both stalking the absolute shit out of you ;)
---
Ghostface is all about stalking and toying with his prey. It's how he's always killed throughout all the scream movies, it's especially apparent in scream 2. It definitely makes sense for him to be a stalker type of killer.
---
No for a game that‚Äôs been out this long, where they get as much money as they do, and the way they have treated their customers, the amount of game breaking problems we have that don‚Äôt get fixed AND you get banned if you happen to come across it or if you lose your shit to a bug. I play rainbow six siege and pubg, and this game always has more game breaking bugs each update compared to those two combined. They have other things to address and from what I remember a shit load of us said in the survey we dun wannit. They don‚Äôt need more income, they need better prioritisation.
---
&gt;Plus you can completely avoid it if you don't care about it.
---
Why would a company trying to make money make something you can avoid completely?
---
&gt;Difference being that you aren't grinding for perks/add ons, you are earning cosmetics and this grind is not tied with the first one, so you are doing both of those things at once. It's just more rewards for the grind that you are already doing when you are leveling/getting add ons. 
---
This entire statement is contradicting your first statement "We don't have ANY details regarding the pass."
---
I‚Äôd say Hag is probably third or fourth after Spirit, Nurse and maybe Billy. 
---
The game is just an awful map in general.
---
I‚Äôd say Doctor is better than Leatherface.
---
Spine Chill = Bad
---
And I will always be funny. ;)
---
Still I can farm even 15000 quickly enouht. At least compared to 9000 shards in dbd
---
Oh I didn't know that about the keys thanks!
---
Now if the question was "do you want the whole cast in color" that's better, still dumb, but not as
---
But who‚Äôs to say OoO is being used with a SWF?  I made this post while in solo lobbies.  SWF is an advantage regardless of it. Only thing is I know where you‚Äôre trapping with Hag or if you go to your ruin right away. 
---
Are killers mad that people use alert? Damn near the same thing.
---
Dude just read your own fucking words. Who tbe fuck would not takes that as an insult?
---
They never said it. Reddit users speculated about it. BHVR like any big company would never say something like this for many reasons.
---
I agree with three of these things. 
---
Everything else is downright blasphemous.
---
Survivors can do nothing and just open the gate or Escape after being carried by a good team and get the Adept achievement. Try getting Adept Freddy. It should be four kills for Adept achievement.
---
Because DBD would become even worse if survivors started answering the phone during the trial. ;)
---
It's a bit better for survivors because it's just a skin. You can teach your survivor the perks you have and can just play the one with all of them. With killer is not the same because they have unique powers, height, speed, mechanics and so on, if we are able to unlock multiple perks per level would make a huge difference.
---
I think Michael just wants that entity spike to go through his head. No big deal
---
Oh yeah, I love wasting time going to a corner of the map where there are no pallets and no loops just to heal your musky ass my dear teammate.
---
But think about it this way, how about....NOT!
---
In my experience going against good hags she will 4k a SWF nearly every single time. She can shut down loops in seconds, and she can counter shack. Doctor is one of the worst killers rn, he needs a buff. I would watch pain relievers video on spine chill. Nice name lmao
---
Also I mean dbd not the map xd
---
Ngl I think an all exhaustion build with Lithe/Dead Hard/Balanced Landing/Head On is kinda fun lmao, every new exhaustion perk you use is another bamboozle to the killer.
---
No they said that. Never thought I‚Äôd see the day someone compare them to any other company. They flat out confirmed it never going to be a thing.
---
I'd say it's up to them to decide if then need more income or not. They are the one doing business, after all. We are the one playing the game tho, and I'm absolutely agreed on that bugs have to be fixed. But I'm sure they'll fix those... Eventually
---
The whole game is an obscene grind, but go off.
---
Which ones? ü§î
---
After the trap goes off, the player will likely run back in the direction they came from because they expect you to take the trap. They will literally run towards you. Unless you have Rusty Shackles then that doesn‚Äôt work. ;)
---
i thought it was more about trying to get more money out of a game that isn't free, and already has additional paid content.
---
I hate this community
---
\[stalks internally\]
---
Probably meant sequels...
---
Yeah even tho I know it will never happen but maybe a team based thing too, where you gotta try to make your survivors escape and take down the other survivors? I don't know just an idea. Don't really know how it'd work just sounded cool in my head lmao
---
It should have been "Not Very Effective".
---
GODDAMIT.  came here to agree with OP but this is such a good and valid point
---
His ability is probably for slowing down objectives then.
---
6 is so correct and thank you for saying it.
---
Laughs in Plague.
---
As a Freddy Main I assure you...this will likely end badly and does not bode well. 
---
PS: To the people bitching about people bitching. You all cried about the Pig changes before it even came out, and successfully scared the devs into changing some things back. Let us cry about Freddy for fucks sake. I‚Äôm gonna laugh my ass off if they ever rework Meyers because literally half this subreddit will riot/lose its shit just like everyone did with Amanda.
---
Wait my guy. The trap is triggered for 4~ Seconds. If you are running behind a survivor and they step into your trap on the other side of a pallet you will hit them every single time if you are good. If they throw it down and don't jump back then teleport. If they throw down the pallet expecting you to teleport... just don't teleport.
---
1. Ehhh depends how expensive it is and how hard it is to get the rewards
---
2. Close, I'd put her third best
---
3. Nah lmao
---
4. Holy shit no, the game is still survivor sided. Always has been, likely always will be
---
5. Straight no. All those killers has a power, LF has nothing against good survivors. He relying on survivors mistakes to be able to hit his chainsaw.
---
6. Yeah I'd actually agree with that
---
7. Freddy for me.
---
8. Ehhhh I'd put it high B.
---
9. Yes
---
10. Probably, doesn't mean that it doesn't need to 
---
11. Yeah
---
You're saying people should be scared of the killer and heal themselves, which doesn't even matter against one-shot killers BTW.
---
This was me when I played survivor and got facecamped, then played iridescent hatchet huntress next game.
---
Maybe not a double pip for escaping, that seems a bit much.
---
If everybody escapes, though, that seems more than reasonable.
---
Oh so we meet again my lady friend
---
Sorry for digging, but you know you can crossreference original file names both in Vorbis Banks and outside of them using the .xml in the same directory, right?
---
This. So much this.
---
OOF
---
There was an exploit that let survivors equip a splinter which could force the killer to play a different killer but it was patched IIRC.
---
This is been a thing since before full release. Careful not to get it backwards and only flag if killer is near.
---
This explains why I like playing survivor so much.
---
Watch Zubat or Scott play LF if you are not near a pallet/window you're on the ground. Hag can literally face camp 3 survivors from 40 meters away all at the same time. I would call that flawed.
---
uwu
---
&gt; The issue is that behavior already makes enough off of this game and they're trying to milk us more with a pass. I might want something from the pass, but i don't want to support it.
---
I don't see the issue. Now you get no cosmetics for free and with the battle pass you get cosmetics for free. Now if you want a cosmetic you have to buy it as well in most cases. If you don't want to support it then just don't.
---
&gt;I didn't say there weren't any exclusives you can't get already, i said you would lose your chance to get NEW exclusives if you didn't get the pass.
---
So you are against exclusives and not against Battlepasses.
---
They didn't "ask" for approval. Watch this video, it explains their relationship. Straight from the DbD devs. [https://youtu.be/\_hqZE87KpW8](https://youtu.be/_hqZE87KpW8)
---
Meme should be funny,
---
But this attempt missed the mark,
---
This is a haiku
---
I got a message back from the first dc, who said they didn't want to bleed out and they just wanted it finished with. I though that her partner had somehow found the hatch and her wanting me to kill her made me not want to kill her...
---
Dig it oh oh oh
---
Dig it
---
Don't forget hallowed blight.
---
So many games ruined for the sake of skins...
---
Really is that gamechanger??
---
it shouldn't punish them. The devs already talked about possibly fixing scenarios like that literally last week. Hell I brought up ideas myself personally, the point still stands that you didn't meet the emblem requirement nor perform actions in that category, you shouldn't get as much as those who do or get pips/bp as easily as those who do.
---
Even if that's true, survivors need to deal with killers slugging.
---
As a singleplayer I always have to deal with killers like this.
---
I might aswell open a psychiatry reception.
---
That‚Äôs why I always follow the person that unhooks me instead of expecting them to follow me
---
Relax. It's a meme, just thought it would be funny.
---
Every Halloween had a different take on the mask, same with Freddy's sweater &amp; glove id love for all the movie killers to have each movie variant
---
smh kill rusher
---
It's sad, nobody plays freddy so they don't care about him. But they are vocal about how little they care and down vote every post about him :/
---
If you put the full gif of this it would have been amazing
---
Still funny tho
---
Agreed.
---
Yea it is up to them to decide, and they should be listening to all of our input. Hence why we are giving input... no one ever said they can‚Äôt do it we are just saying we REALLY don‚Äôt want it. Others do, that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs their job to listen to us and make appropriate changes if any to the product they are selling to US, their consumers.
---
This is 100% true. Even the lore of the game implies that the entity wants you to play with your prey.
---
Automatically pipping on 4ks will just incentivize face camping which is fun for literally nobody.
---
I'll check that out when I can use my laptop. I actually haven't seen any artwork from SFM. But the animations are awesome! I really like the animation in the FNaF TryHardNinja song "Replay Your Nightmare."
---
You have to keep in mind that by putting up this poll by itself the people who will be answering will be those strongly opposed to it, along with the fact that the reddit community is a specific type of person, not a good pool for polling the average player.
---
Any links
---
Not every killer is a one-shot killer BTW.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
You were always able to pick up survivors, even if they weren't asleep. I was moried by Freddy not being asleep and I couldn;t see him killing me :P
---
That's not true. There's a ton of times I've escaped as survivor and didn't get a pip. In fact, playing as stealthily as possible, never getting caught, doing gens, and escaping will get you just barely past the negative pip and award you with a whole 8k BP. Killers get a shit ton more BP than survivors. I have to bring an escape cake just to get close to a killers base BP gain.
---
Could get 2+ survivors depending on how bad they fuck up, what your perks are and if your killer has a snowball ability.
---
Otherwise deerstalker shouldn't exist  (not that I had it equiped)
---
But playing to the lore is fun! 
---
To get a perfect score of 4/8000, you need to hurt and injure the Survivors, letting them go sometimes, (Hunter / Brutality) using all tools at your disposal (Deviousness), while giving them them as many chances to survive as you can (Sacrifice). Then, when they think they can escape, tear that hope away and Sacrifice them regardless (Last few Sacrifice).
---
Out of the artwork you link, the biggest difference I see is the lighting. Actually, that's the only difference I see. Looks like SFM just has better shading.
---
I look ugly lmao
---
#whos shittin in the tall grass
---
I didn't played game for long time. Last killer i remember is clown. That's all.
---
"runs for 30 sec, to the other side of the map", here, now you can heal me.
---
[I need that background image...](https://youtu.be/5JNlTD0I7UM?t=41)
---
Thanks so much!
---
Trust me, there‚Äôs plenty difference when it comes to how posing is done and how it looks- though an expert in GMOD can probably do something on the calibur of a typical SFM poster. And even so, lighting is an incredibly important part of making artwork look serious, toned, and above all else... good. SFM excels in this.
---
Drake? Where's the exit gate?
---
No, a 4k should guarantee a safety pip. Some games a killer will completely destroy a team becasue the survivor team wasn't very good. That means the killer didn't show off their skill during the match and doesn't necessarily deserve to pip.
---
Same with escaping as a survivor, it should guarantee a safety pip but nothing more as they could of been playing against a garbage killer.
---
Remember that this subreddit consisting of 100.000 people doesn't represent the entire community. I think it's safe to say most people here dislike the idea of a battle pass but perhaps a majority of people who aren't on reddit like the idea?
---
1. Depends on how it's handled.  
---
2. 4th best. Billy and Spirit are better.  
---
3. Please elaborate.  
---
4. Depends whether or not the survivors have BL. It also depends on whether or not they know how to loop. Aaand, of course, which killer is on the hunt.  
---
5. No. Leatherface is the 2nd worst killer. He's a standard M1 killer with his only power being able to one-shot a survivor that doesn't know how to circle trees. He can protect hooks like none other, but his pressure is dog-shit.  
---
6. Cosmetic-wise? I'unno, I'm a fan of Bill's prestige outfit.  
---
7. Cosmetic-wise? I suppose he's up there.  
---
8. S-tier.  
---
9. No. Other exhaustion perks need small buffs to be made more attractive. Except Adrenaline, of course.  
---
10. Most likely, but even so, SWF needs to be made more convenient by not kicking everyone out of the party after every match or after dodging a lobby.  
---
11. No shit.
---
If one person goes down to noed and the survivors still play altruistic I'd say its on them for all dying
---
genius lmao
---
Atleast I got a gg from them üòÇ
---
Aside from the wall hatchet, it looks like you are getting packet loss.
---
That's not a game issue, contact your ISP about it.
---
This man actually using the japanese class scale? I like it
---
üòâüëç
---
People need to stop whining about the "potential" battlepass. DBD could be entering the F2P domain... making this move not the greediest at all. Yes! The BP would need to be fair and take the F2P players into some consideration (fair/balanced bonuses in terms of shards/BP modifiers) but overall - why buy 1 set for 1000+ cells when you could potentially get say, 2-3 full sets alongside charms and other goodies for 950 cells?
---
if you lose cause you didnt tunnel, you're ass. sorry to tell you
---
Skillchecks feel completely random to me. Game by game their smoothness will change. Sometimes it will look like a 30fps or less animation, and sometimes it'll feel like they're a clean 144fps. 
---
Pretty frustrating because in the case where they aren't very smooth it does make it more difficult to hit greats. Feels like uncontrollable artificial difficulty
---
[Can see the difference here](https://thebigmantyrone.s-ul.eu/D3ju3cS6)
---
Bum BOM-bom **BOM BOM BADOM**
---
Play bingo bong boy and cloack between each hit you'll get rank 5 in no time.
---
Subreddit isn't majority of the playerbase, if nobody wanted it they wouldn't be making it.
---
We don't know the actual results of the survey, for all that we know the results might be pro-pass.
---
I dont think you have to pip to get the adept achievement though
---
I'm talking about the adept trophies, not pips or BP. to get those, survivors only have to escape out the door, no matter how poorly they do throughout the game. but killers have to get a merciless rating, which it very difficult, roughly requiring a double pip, which tends to require doing a perfect game against good survivors. an it's even harder than originally designed, because merciless rank used to be given for killing all 4, but now it's tied to emblems, the end result being the game has to last a long time, but few gens done, yet somehow all the chases are won quickly with lots of pallets destroyed, all 4 dead, roughly 9 hooks, and keep in mind this can only be done with the killer's 3 unique perks, when most killers have only one decent perk at best, with 2 shitty or mediocre ones. 
---
 a survivor, by contrast, could deliberately throw their team under the bus to escape, do no objectives at all while hiding behind 2 rocks in the corner the whole game, and still gets a trophy for it.
---
nurses calling+sloppy buther is a really good combo on him for lower tiers. Also discordance/surveillance/overcharge because with the right add ons he can zoom between objectives when not in chase.
---
[Still image](https://i.imgur.com/WmdZeL3.jpg)
---
I got stuck in a pallet a week ago.
---
Points
---
Thats kind of dumb in terms of gameplay though
---
Even so, the results will give something to go off of. As it stands the current results show that "not at all interested" has the most votes, with 45% of votes not liking the idea, 30% liking the idea, and 25% "somewhat interested"
---
What if the survivor who didn't do gens spent most of the time distracting the killer? Is that not deserved?  
---
Deserving the Adren is not only based on how much you worked on the primary objective.
---
I always let survivors who beg for their life escape. Unless its a claudette, i have had too many sandbagging claudettes as a survivor,i think thats the only thing claudettes do.
---
I mean if you were here a year ago you‚Äôd have remembered everyone being super pissed at quick 4ks and everyone begged for something like this.
---
Escaping should always grant a safety pip.
---
And what you did to that Billy Zubatlel? Think about his children! He was just farming as any working man (backbreaking labor and some elbow grease) then you come up and run him around odd wood structures you call "Jungle gyms". Yeah just like the jungle gyms you bullied little Nancy O. peters in during 4th grade! Think about when the Billy comes home from work having to tell his kids the day of farming has yielded no crops but tears on our gentle Megs 4Heads. Yes and when he betrays his fellow Megs and plays killer he feasts on their souls for what he calls the "Entity" but we all know to be his IMMENSE EGO.   Just between the cold-blooded murdering and oh Lord the wedgies he gave little Nancy, this Zubatlel fellow, I mean this guy's a real jerk!
---
Obviously there a circumstances where it is deserved. But adrenaline can also reward players who do nothing all game.
---
There is a free battle pass tho, you don't have to pay for it.
---
Plus we don't even know if it's going to give points/shards, might just be skins.
---
My opinion:
---
1. It depends, we don't know if it'll be good or not, we'll have to wait for more details
---
2. Not really, hag is really good but she's not better than spirit or Billy. 
---
3. No, old legion had the most flawed design
---
4. No, not a popular opinion either. The game has survivor and killer sided things alike. People constantly say that the game is killer or survivor sided, not a new thing. Game is pretty balanced now (minus some hiccups) 
---
5. Better than freddy yes, the rest no
---
6. He has the best prestige cosmetic but that's if we aren't counting his face
---
7. Agree
---
8. Not sure how to feel about this one, but spine chill is indeed a good perk
---
9. Not really, just some maps layouts need to be changed so that balanced landing can't give you infinites
---
10. No, it definitely would have not been as popular as it is now but it would not be dead. A lot of people play solo survivor and a lot of people play killer
---
11. "Funny" is subjective
---
I respect your opinions, just thought I'd also share mine :)
---
because the killer should be rewarded for doing well not for being shit. or as you say "toy with them". some people gain enjoyment from winning not fucking about so because those people don't have fun the same way you do they won't get shit. and yes it's bullshit that survivor adepts are brain dead easy while killer adapts are so ball-bustingly hard (with some killers). giving an automatic merciless for a 4k seems like a good solution.
---
Daddy myers can stay behind my hook as long as he wants
---
Also devour hope, I always find that first or see streamers lose it instantly when they use it in a build
---
If you get put in the basement against hag, it's pretty much gg.
---
Voice lines
---
r/2meirl4meirl
---
And getting gen rushed isn't very fun for the Killer but Survivors do it anyways. If Killers aren't supposed to tunnel then Survivors should do 100 vaults, 100 crouches, 100 locker entries, and a 10km run after doing a gen.
---
&gt; a pillow
---
I mean i guess you can compare some survivors to a pillow? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
WHITE SUPREMACY!!?!!?1 /s
---
I feel like clown is good though. He can be annoying but his bottles have a weird trajectory.
---
I can agree that it helps make money, but it can also turn off potential new users, because they have to pay for the game, then the DLC, then cosmetics, then a battle pass. people hate on Payday 2 for the same reason.
---
The difference is that a 45 minute hatch standoff required both the killer and survivor to agree to it.
---
It wasn't just the survivor or killer choosing to hold the game hostage, it was both parties' fault.
---
I only disagree with 4. I like the Game and dobt think it is killer sided. The rest is true.
---
And so does the Clown, unfortunately.
---
They need to seriously punish DC, I'm sure some innocent internet went out, people will be affected but I doubt there are that many of those people. Maybe something like...if you DC &gt; 3 times a week then you have a DC symbol next to you in the lobby before the game so killers can choose not to play with you.
---
I assumed that was just a behind the scenes look at testing
---
Survivors on hook are literally held hostage and can‚Äôt do anything until saved, then getting smacked immediately and put back onto hook isn‚Äôt fun at all. It‚Äôs up to the killer to decide how their match will go. Sure going against survivors who know what they‚Äôre doing is challenging, but a survivor being tunneled or camped can‚Äôt do anything
---
That's some interesting word syntax
---
With that build, I would agree. But overall, I would say the Hag is probably third or fourth best. ;)
---
Just phasing as spirit gives you many bloodpoints, i do recommend BBQ and survivor pudding for even more tho
---
I'm a doctor main and I've had 30+ minute 3-gens. Silver gatekeeper. Yes they blew through gens early on but I completely stopped them for the rest of the match on the last gen. 
---
They changed it BECAUSE of "Outlier cases" where matches go on for a very long time but so fucking what, that's still defending the generators. 
---
All it does is make Ruin even more of a "mandatory" perk + encourage the killers to kill everyone as fast as possible as IIRC you get a bonus if gens are left before 9 minutes and everyone's dead.
---
I mean I saw from your other comment that you appear to have missed my point and started burning down a strawman, good meme though, really put me in my place.
---
I agree that the pool is smaller, but that's fine. It still give us something to look at and speculate on! right now the votes are honestly pretty well spread out even though a lot of people have voted for "not at all interested"
---
Swing and a miss, Plague is free with iridescent shards. 
---
Myers/Freddy/Pig/LF/now ghostface are licensed killers, so those updates are paid to make up for license fees.
---
The point of all of those events is getting cosmetics, they aren't affecting gameplay. You still win the game the same way you would outside of the event, and once people got the cosmetics (which aren't gameplay features) they stopped caring for flowers/lanterns.
---
Idk about merciless I'd be good with a pip but I share the sentiment. I think everyone on this sub agreed that 2k is an average game, 3k is a win, and 4k is a wipe. It doesnt make sense that I can get a 3k and black or depip pretty regularly, or 4k and black pip.
---
If you lose because you did not tunnel then yes, you need to refine your gameplay. Sorry to tell you though that this game, just like the real world, is not black and white. 
---
I get 4ks almost every game without tunneling, and sometimes I get 4ks when I prioritize my targets. Fact of the matter is that optimally choosing who you chase can be game changing, thus meaning it is not being a "dick", it is simply playing the game how it was designed. You lost this one mate, take the L and move on.
---
Yikes, I hope you feel better soon, if you aren‚Äôt feeling happy.
---
it's not a free heal though. It's a heal due to getting gens done and surviving to the end, rushing them while hurt, and only having 3 perks 90% of the game. Even on top of all that, the perk only benefits you if you're getting chased when it pops or you're hurt. Yea it sucks to see the last gen pop and a couple people on the team heal but come one, you say you could have got 2+ killers otherwise but you aint getting shit. lol. They ran you and beat your ruin with 3 perks. The killer needs to take the L or run NOED, BW, Discordance, or whatever.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say this necessarily happened with me to a T but it‚Äôs the spirit map, I‚Äôm playing Spirit, I find the last survivor for a second, Kate as well, hit her, she is just about to get hatch but luckily I was phasing. Phased and closed it right in her face.   I wanted to feel bad but damn was it a good play.
---
I sure wish people would stop using reddit as personal social media lol x
---
We should stop censoring toxic players' names..
---
They deserve more ridicule
---
Is the attack recovery shorter when you‚Äôre carrying someone? If so she could‚Äôve taken advantage to hit the other rescuer and then quickly down the hooked person again after being freed?
---
55% so far is positive or not negative. I voted very excited.
---
I initially had it "even in front of him" but i think it works both ways  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Probably have him the ability to enter the real world to get some hits in
---
I swear this is every game for me. I'm like rank 12 killer (not really trying to rank up, just farming bloodpoints so I can unlock all teachables as I just started playing again). It really feels like 90% of my games, ruin is gone within 60s.
---
For awhile I swapped ruin out for something else but never really found anything my killer has access too that was better. At least ruin is wasting 60s of 1 or more survivors time.
---
Kek
---
It would be fun for killers to be against eachother, trying to get more hooks. The killers could somehow mess with eachother to slow them down.
---
I don't think it's balanced. When I play survivor I love popping the last gen and seeing 3 injured go to full health, as killer I die inside. It can just be too much of a momentum swing. 
---
I think noed would be fine if you just knew it was coming. If the hex notification activated at one gen, then you could at least stall and hunt down totems.
---
Guys, I cleansed the ru... ‚Äùexposed status effect‚Äù *crouches away in silence ‚Äù
---
I doubt this is a serious post, boss. 
---
Why would OP play Killer if they‚Äôre sad, Killer makes you sad AND frustrated. /s
---
Pig should be higher.
---
How is selling the base game+DLC+Cosmetic MTs not already a viable business model, if Behaviour need a Battlepass on top of that just to survive they are incredibly bad with money.
---
Imagine all that cholesterol though. You know that amount of protein is pound to mess up some arteries.
---
If your a killer their all trash.
---
Just to fully establish how bad Tombstone Myers is:
---
* You have to use two Ultra Rare offerings (meaning that it's 14000 Bloodpoints down the drain every time you play it)
---
* You have to stalk 3 out of 4 Survivors 100%, and one of the Survivors 50% to get it. Meaning that if you can't find one Survivor or they DC or whatever your build is literally useless.
---
* You move at **105%** movement speed with Judith's Tombstone equipped. That's Evil Within 1 speed! But unlike Hag / Huntress / Spirit you literally just have to chase Survivors down without any tools to close the distance. You don't even have a smaller Terror Radius like with EW1 Myers.
---
* You don't even get that many Bloodpoints or good Emblems from it. You lose out on a massive amount of Brutality and Sacrifice Bloodpoints by instamoring someone, and you actually lose the Chaser emblem because Chaser only counts a chase as "completed" if you *hit* someone, not if you Mori them.
---
Every time I play Tombstone Myers there's a brief "ohhh boy get ready to be fucking spooked lil' survivos" at the start before I remember how fucking godawful the build is. I'd much rather play perma Tier 3 with an Ebony Mori or bring Tombstone piece along with a J. Myer's Memorial so I could actually move at regular fucking movement speed. It's seriously so godawful and there's a reason that "Evil Encarnate" is one of the least owned achievements in the game despite the Halloween chapter being the second oldest DLC in the game.
---
If I, as the Killer, can't see Ruin, it's either tucked away behind a locker under the floorboards in the Basement, or in a position so obvious I mistook it for a Generator during my first sweep.
---
I'm guilty of this too.
---
I see you're a person of culture, well done
---
Pig=upvote.
---
I find it enjoyable, hence üê∑
---
Didn‚Äôt even think of it. Thanks though!
---
Have fun in your games!
---
BBQ and chili üòõ
---
Well, 70% of my games I get merciless killer and 20% of those merciless killer matches  It was a 3k
---
Thanks always saying his in lobby now
---
Ok?
---
Thanks dear x
---
This is a legitimate game?  I thought this was a joke.
---
Lol true I'd use it probably only for the blood points though
---
I mean the emblem very clearly states what it‚Äôs for, and it‚Äôs not solely for keeping the gate closed. It‚Äôs for gen progression, and how fast they get done.  Yes yes gens are how you open the gate, I‚Äôm simply pointing out that you claiming the gatekeeper emblem is solely tied to keeping the gate closed, isn‚Äôt the most honest sentiment.
---
Nurse is harder to control, frames are lower so harder to react, etc etc.
---
I played on a friend‚Äôs PC ONCE and got a 4K 4gens with only nurses calling. 
---
Sometimes I‚Äôll play nurse and get no sacrifices on PS4
---
I got the cosmetics that I wanted for the moon event pretty easily. I played a couple of matches each day. I mean if you want every cosmetic then you wont get it but tbh the survivor cosmetics were a little lack luster
---
\&gt;putting myers in the same tier as LF
---
got this game yesterday huh?
---
Exquisite
---
Watch at 15:45, when the match start.
---
So much this. I was crucified yesterday but I‚Äôm still on the fence about it.
---
And if you don‚Äôt like the idea, you‚Äôre flooded with ‚Äúhaha what a circlejerk‚Äù ‚Äúgamers rise up‚Äù, etc.
---
Someone got downed on the other side of the map and THEY STILL ran away
---
*leave*
---
As a killer main I don't think it's OP. Personally I would change it so if you're exhausted you still get the heal state but no the sprint boost. Other than that whatever, it's just something to deal with.
---
sick of this zubat guy using exploits to use his hacked legacy skins off the steam servers, honestly reported to reddit and also my dad works for nintendo and knows the DBD devs from the switch port so prepare to be penalized
---
zubSAD
---
I've never given a fuck about their stupid metrics for victory. 
---
If I'm playing a killer, my objective is to kill everyone. Period. I do whatever gets me that goal.
---
If I'm playing a survivor, my objective is to escape. Period. I don't do any altruistic action that doesn't increase my chance to escape and I certainly don't stick around after gens are complete.
---
It's the same in reference to the 2 possible issues I brought up.
---
weird is good
---
Unlucky :c
---
Afraid. He had one of the most unique playstyles, being probably the killer that takes the least chases when he does not have to simply because he has the strongest information game.
---
Powerbar, for me, suggests he gets a more chased focused ability, which, tbf, most people complained about, so good for BHVR to listen to the majority I guess /salty :(
---
Freddy has been in rework for a long time, and considering it is a official license, I do hope he will come out good. But even if he does, he will lose a lot of charm he had to current Freddy mains, and I fear how his gameplay changes. But also, I am a bit excited to see what he could be capable of doing, as long as it is not chase focused.
---
I like your logic
---
It's a meme ya donut.
---
This pleases me. Great Job :)
---
You're acting like it's a mistep when **it's not even out yet**. Wait.
---
This post is just... üëå
---
drop adrenaline, grab d strike
---
It‚Äôs so weird to me that this is considered Dead by Daylight cosplay and not Halloween cosplay
---
People who don't know how to play with others as though the opposing side's fun matters too is the reason why a 4K 'no matter what' isn't the objective of the game.
---
Are you telling me you don't like *thicc* spirt
---
Who said it was a crime? People gave already purchased the game just let the game be lol
---
I keep the spirit as my killer on the loading screen just to see those cheeks each time I return to lobby ;)
---
I never said I was vanilla.
---
I‚Äôd say something but reddit would probably ban me.
---
U right
---
Same. I tried doing this with Doctor only to lose steam half way through. It's not revenge-the new batch of survivors had nothing to do with my loss. It was just empty and meaningless, so I don't do this anymore.
---
yeah I wouldn't mind if it was free... BUT IT'S NOT.
---
Nurse's addons should not affect blinks. Two is strong, 3 is enough.
---
Also, it appears that they have kept the having to put them into the dream state.
---
They call it tunneling, i call it playing the game. If they wanna waste their time chasing me the entire game oh well but the other 3 are gonna be cranking out generators the whole time.
---
Hi there, Merciful Killer here. It‚Äôs partially for points. It‚Äôs also a matter of when I see someone getting continuously screwed over. It can be by the game being buggy, lag (my host isn‚Äôt the best and I‚Äôm fully aware of it), asshole and/or useless teammates, etc. I‚Äôm actually a survivor main, and I only play Killer for Daily Rituals and extra BP because face it, it‚Äôs just easier on Killer. So I literally don‚Äôt care about getting a 4K or my Killer Rank. I find myself getting screwed over with bad luck quite a lot on Survivor and so I refuse to be the thing I hate. I won‚Äôt camp, tunnel, etc. 
---
I also absolutely refuse to punish all survivors for their asshole teammates rage quitting and basically totally screwing then over. I get accused of teaming and ‚ÄúIM REPORTING YOU!‚Äù Quite a lot. My response is always the same. ‚ÄúMaybe don‚Äôt screw your team by DCing then.‚Äù When they get extra rude or pissy I go out of my way to make sure the remaining survivors get enough points to Pip, and then let them ALL live and promptly remind them to report the jerk who quit on them. I‚Äôve actually made a decent amount of survivor friends recently because of it. 
---
Sometimes I also do a gimmick where at the start of the match I roll a 6 sided dice. Highest roll for a survivor (I go down the line) is the one who gets to live, and I then save them for last. If two people roll the same high number I tie breaker them, and if it‚Äôs double 6‚Äôs I re roll.
---
come on wouldn't you just want to be pounded by a tier 3 myers üëÄüí¶
---
so is your mom
---
No info on the rewards.
---
You can do things but you have to grind way too much. Also it's worth mentioning I purchased one of their transactions for coins and a character. I got coins and no character and the support ticket never got a answer. My save data was supposed to be attached to my google play account but when I switched devices I had no data restored. So the few weeks I spent on their ridiculous grind was just a waste.
---
They definitely need to switch it up a bit. How do you even get 32,000 point match as survivor.
---
I don't get this tier list thing. Where did it come from?
---
oooooohhh I wonder if it fills up when you put people in dream state and once it's full you get an insta down w/out having to pull them in.
---
Dwight in his PJs at rank 1 is the impossible to catch loopmaster.
---
So what your saying is to close the hatch, chase the survivor and make him die by the end game mechanic. ü§î
---
Ok. I just don't want there to be exclusive items.
---
If that was the case Khabib would earn more than McGregor.
---
no you're right it's not hard to do gens but I would argue that is based on the killer and the skill level. If you have a good player who applies pressure, gens get harder. And yes, you don't have to do gens but that doesn't mean they don't deserve it. Think about it. what else would you be doing? Nothing? okay, so then people really deserve it if I am playing with a scared Claudette who crouches on the outside of the map. that is 3 people with 3 perks doing 5 gens. You should still be rewarded doing other things and not just gens. what about the person who runs the killer for 2 gens? Don't they deserve it?
---
Yes, 3 perks are less detrimental on survivors but killers don't have to run 3 perks ever unless they run hex totems. I am just saying that if you're going against a team that doesn't heal and works on gens instead and you can't get kills, you just suck as a killer. Plain and simple. To answer your kills after gens pop comment: Bro: if you're using snowball nurse like you said WITH ANY PERKS, with people running around injured doing gens instead of healing, and 5 gens pop still, you ain't getting any kills after lol. Don't kid yourself. 
---
as for the last thing you said: wanna counter adrenaline: don't let them get 5 gens. Easier said than done but I truly believe that a lot of the things come back around to people just being bad killers.
---
More like you shouldn't be so naive to believe it'd be any different. For your sake I hope they take into account some of the concerns.
---
Most people who say NOED is a crutch will use adrenaline which is WAY more OP than NOED
---
A while ago there was a new announcement, the game will have a gameplay test on the 26th of may I believe.
---
Vanilla DBD, no perks, offerings, add ons or survive with friends. Anyone who wanted to participate had to fill up a survey. The test would only include 500 people chosen via the survey.
---
That would be a really cool idea!
---
Ruin,enduring,brutal strength/bamboozle and spirit fury full pallet destroyer build is good too disrespect pallets always making it harder for later chases brutal or bamboozle is good but I perfer bamboozle cause tier 3 Myers has the one of the best vaulting speed behind legion with no addons or perks and it‚Äôs helpful to end chases quicker
---
Oh i agree. Never touched the character. I am hoping his rework does him justice.
---
Oh I see now. No I don't want features to be in a battlepass.
---
I'm saying that battlepasses only feature side objectives that aren't there to make you want to play the game more.
---
Except for when you play killer
---
He claims you're a "toxic asshole" after what he just said. üò§ 
---
God some people in this community really make me sick.
---
That isn't bad. or that it is only activated when feet are on ground in the moment it's popped.
---
The point of my comment is that the whole ‚Äúkilling/surviving is the objective of the game‚Äù argument, is a stupid argument because it‚Äôs clearly not the objective of the game as the ranking system will sorely let you know. So I guess thanks for proving my point by agreeing that what I said is stupid (yay sarcasm!) which also proves what OP is posing as pretty stupid.  Also your statement about a killer getting 4 kills as always being indicative of skill couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.  If you get matched with 4 potatoes, you shouldn‚Äôt get a merciless rank for killing all 4 survivors on their first hook.
---
Hes a rank 11 killer he knows the game. Hes an idiot and put the dumbest perks on fred...  it is what it is
---
You know, i dont think, that tunneling is a horrible thing. But if you are near by the hook all the time, thats pretty annoying. As usual, i have more important things to do, like setting traps, breaking gen or chasing another survivor(most of the time). Even, when somebody unhooks in front of me, i like to hit shitty savior, but thats my own, "sport" interest. 
---
Thats not bad, when you tunnel, its bad, when you are doing circles over the hook most of your time. But thats rather lack of a good strategy, not being an asshole(as usual).
---
If you are not costantly near by the hook, thats not your problem indeed.
---
At last, id like to tell, that hunting for a savior, is a good counter to borrowed. If you are good, going for another survivor sometimes better, because unhooked survivor also need a plenty of time to get healed.
---
Yep exactly!!!!
---
I thought they had a policy that everything they come out with will be available in the shop? I know that is not true for legacy and old event stuff but I think they meant going forward from that point when they made the shop so possibly will be available in the shop.
---
Pro Tip: Being an asshole and farming your team mates doesn‚Äôt grant you stacks anymore so feel feee to stop doing it üëåüèª
---
Strong disagree. This streamer is saying derogatory things. As a community we should not stand for this.
---
I agree totally. I want my free hit when the auto aim turns me towards a wall or rock and miss lol.  Nea better come back and let me hit her!
---
THAT'S RACIST!
---
-ESPN
---
People can have gripes with the battle pass and behaviour as a company but the fact is a battle pass will keep people playing once they buy it. Just look at fortnite, the dailies and weekly challenges weren't enough so now they added another thing called fortbytes that is supposed to encourage people to play everyday.
---
Did not know that.
---
I totally agree with this, and I would love to be able to say it more often; but last time I tried it, my karma took a huge blow because of the salty survivors, so now I gotta stop saying my opinion and just be a 'nice guy' in order to post without a bloody time limit
---
I was upset they removed this from johnny cage in mk11 over that claim.
---
and it worked :( and they changed johnny cage in mk11 from making that symbol to a middle finger instead before punching the screen.
---
see that's the part that's controversial, 
---
"The fact that some players go to lengths about how tunneling is a detriment to the game is preposterous."
---
I would argue it is detrimental to the game bc the game is going to lose players if it's not fun. if the survivors build this complex believing the killers are tunneling them, they're not going to play the game and over time lose a player base. But at the same time, as the killer, it's not fun to me to just let everyone go and be told how to play.
---
*Just because you breathe, survivors with DC.
---
But who are those "we" - that's the question. I believe there's no harm in battle pass, as I don't think you could switch design resources to develop dedicated servers more quick or to fix code faster. So I wouldn't mind them doing battle pass if they do it correctly.
---
Tell me about it.
---
Hitting survivors body blocking a hook means I don't get the hook but hooking means one survivor body blocks whilst another unhooks and the gate's right there. And everyone *just did gens* whilst I was a Ruin Doctor who zapped everyone. And it's rank 15.
---
Nah it‚Äôs because I was camping by being on the map
---
Huntress on ps4?
---
Absolutely. The Merciless achievements are fucking atrocious now because, in order to get them, you have to basically let the survivors live for much longer than they should. It's absolutely bullshit. 
---
Think about this, the killer's job is to kill the survivors. Yet, in order to achieve the Merciless, you have to let chases go on, even let the game extend because you can't get iridescents if it ends too quickly. *You have to go against your main objective*. It's fucking terrible. The killer can be punished if the survivors are trash, because if he ends the game too early (because they're not good) then he won't get the medals. That's beyond stupid. Survivor DC'd? You now can't get the merciless either. 
---
The Merciless achievements for killer are entirely in the hands of the survivors. That is god awful decision making on the part of the devs. 
---
*BuT tHe EnTiTy FeEdS oN HoPe*
---
Doesn't matter. You can get more bloodpoints for giving the survivors "more hope". That's your reward. But you yourself, the killer, is showing no mercy by just massacring them all. You are Merciless when you show no mercy. Letting the game extend if you're doing too good against the survivors is the exact opposite of being Merciless because that is literally showing mercy so the game will extend.
---
Yeah made more sense to me if he couldve called people. Like have a mechanic where he calls 1 survivor at random, (focuses obsession first) they have a limited time to answer phone before being revealed to killer for X seconds. If they answer it is like snap out of it mechanic where they gotta hold still and talk to him with skill checks if they mess up reveals and if they succeed it stops him from calling him again. Until he hooks another survivor. And have addons effect the call duration, reveal, skill checks.
---
I actually do wonder if they will be adding movie character skins to the battle pass since my understanding is it is hard to get more cosmetics for them.
---
Its fine we all make mistakes (or happy accidents as bob ross calls them)
---
Tbh middle finger was better
---
Very fast and can grab? That‚Äôs a no for me, even if it‚Äôs a timer
---
I am on your side fam. Oink.
---
Ew mob mentality
---
And it gets thrown down by Meg anyways, when the killer is half way across the map. üëΩ
---
The one where he calls the blonde for trivia first 10 min of the movie? Then call the Prescott like 3 times and steal the dads phone? Wtf movie were you watching?
---
How dare you even hit one of them I'd DC too what a toxic killer.
---
I also use it for when none of my teammates are coming to get me after 20 seconds. I understand that can be confusing, but when your team is ignoring you on the hook you don't have many options.
---
One slug too many
---
From who?
---
A battle pass is a good idea imo. We need a purpose to play the game, yea there‚Äôs rank but who gives a fuck about it? Its literally worse to get rank 1. And besides, you get no reward for getting to rank 1.
---
Same for survivors. If the killer is nowhere to be found then you aren't pipping, in fact you may even depip if you don't focus on generators.
---
I hate being tunneled because it‚Äôs already a slog to get bp. When I end up getting 3-4k bp in a game because I got tunneled into the ground, it‚Äôs annoying as fuck. Killers would bitch if they only got 3-4k bp in a game because they got ‚Äúgen rushed.‚Äù
---
But, but, but, but its not a battle royal why have a battle passssssss!?!? /s
---
For real?
---
Damn, even Legion was confused.
---
I also have some thoughts about a possible Sidney perk that would counter perks that cause the Exposed status effect (and maybe a few other perk ideas). Let me know if you'd like to see a post about that as well!
---
I'm sure that's rated on existing art by community
---
This is pretty much as true as it gets. At the highest level of gameplay though it is survivor sided and not even nurse can stop that but not many people are at that point.
---
&gt; Grinding is the reason people play this game so much, admit it or not but the reason this game is addictive and people put SO many hours into it is the progression system. 
---
If that were true I wouldn't continue playing even though I've had all perks unlocked for quite a long time. If the game is fun, you don't need to create an artificial addiction through grind. I've put almost 3k hrs into DbD because it's fun, I nearly quite during Legacy Bloodwebs days because the grind wasn't fun.
---
In the same footage that's second ealier he still is in the dream world so I bet he can somewhat change between them

Ice Kold! Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright......

Rob Zombie‚Äôs Myers can go straight to the trash
---
Hi I've never played the game (planning to do so soon) and I've seen a lot of people say that the game is a bad map, could you tell me why?
---
So, someone didn't load in.. and we got put back to lobby. IT WORKED!!! I was happy!
---
However, this killer wasn't so happy that they didn't get their 1v3.
---
# Some people will always find something to complain about..
---
Someone here said the max you can get in a match is 32k. Is that true?
---
Speaking from experience, eh?
---
Yea, but that‚Äôs not every game. You can consistently push 30k though.
---
Agreed. Jackie‚Äôs Freddy was a more sinister Freddy, like the way Heath Ledger made the Joker a more sinister character
---
I've never heard that and if its true, I'd actually like the idea of it. I don't think it's gonna happen though, why would they make a cheaper and quicker way to get skins when theyre a large portion of their income?
---
Thanks! It was indeed gratifying haha

Unless you are against Nurse/Hag/Spirit, being injured isn't too big of a problem as you can just loop in a less greedy way if you know how to loop.

Vs more competent killers it is somewhat of a waste of time to heal.

Hell, what's the point in being part of a community if I always have to second guess whether I should comment on something or not?

Happy cake day
---
His crouch speed is fine and when crouched and leaning its a 2 second stalk so he is good there. Only thing I am worried about is if his speed is less than 4.6m/s.
---
Because bHVr has small pene
---
Ever since they changed the pipped system, an auto escape right at the start of the game isn't enough to safety pip at the higher ranks. You get one iri and one silver; which is only 6 points.
---
Already got the best of both worlds in the comments lol
---
Competition? You realize this is DBD? This game is a joke competitive wise. Skill floor and ceiling is laughably bad for killer. Game was changed to make it stupid easy for killers and less solo carry-able as a survivor as they brought down the skill ceiling. Proof is in the pudding, less than 200 hour killers killing a survivor with over 2k hours. You practically never see that on any actual competitive game. Why? Skill floor and ceiling is pretty damn narrow for DBD.
---
If you really want a competitive game then look to Fortnite, Overwatch, CSGO, League of Legends, Dota, Apex, etc. You know...a game that actually has a wide open skill floor and ceiling.
---
to be honest the only thing needed to balance the game is gen completion. it's way too fast.
---
I'd say at least 2 players a game have no idea what they're doing.
---
&gt;The point of my comment is that the whole ‚Äúkilling/surviving is the objective of the game‚Äù argument, is a stupid argument because it‚Äôs clearly not the objective of the game as the ranking system will sorely let you know
---
It is though. The ranking system is bad because it doesn't reward you for doing things that indicate skill. The killer getting a 4k indicates he is vastly better than the survivor side, and displayed skill. The survivor escaping *may* have displayed skill, but may not have, so it probably shouldn't be weighed as heavily.
---
My point was not the OP was wrong, I am actually disagreeing with you. You cannot treat things as equivalent in an asymetric game, that is the point of it being asymmetric. You surviving as a survivor is not a 1:1 inverse of the killer getting a 4 kill, and the rank system should not treat it as such.
---
&gt;If you get matched with 4 potatoes, you shouldn‚Äôt get a merciless rank for killing all 4 survivors on their first hook.
---
You do in literally every other game that uses a ranking system.
---
Ranking systems are not a method of rewarding players for doing wacky things to style on their opponents. They are a method of calibrating matchmaking. In any game with a ranking system, you will gain ranks for showing superiority over your opponents, regardless of their skill, because the point of the system is to move people closer to their ideal rank, not to reward people.
---
If you get matched with 4 potatos, it indicates those potatos are overinflated in rank, OR that you are underinflated in rank, and a good system does not assume either way. DBD's does, because it depends so heavily on interaction that everyone could play a perfect game (Killer gets a 4k, efficiently wins chases after a normal chase length, but doesn't stop the gates opening due to time. Survivors can't get hook rescues, but everyone does their gen share and has a decently long chase) and *no one pips.*
---
That is insane. The current system is better than cube or the original system, but is still not really good at identifying how well you did because its full of perverse incentives that reward you rank for doing very unhelpful, unproductive things purely for the sake of earning rank. A good ranking system does not include elements of 'shooting the moon' and should be unobtrusive, this is basic game design. If players are sabotaging their own play to game your rank system, your rank system is bad.

So you're leaving because of the battle pass drama? gurl...
---
When you use "save as" you can select the type of file you want to save it as.
---
You mean don't let the billy chainsaw me on my way out?
---
you also have to pray they dont rage and DC... which legit occurs every 2nd game for me. At higher ranks with SWF its MORE common and a total kick in the face.
---
DBD came out 1 year after Rainbow Six. Both games are going strong. What's your point?
---
Hate the grind (bloodweb) but want more grind? (battlepass)
---
No, its the entire community being toxic, like my post states, giving one exanple isnt the only reasoning, i just dont feel like writing a 4 page report on why this community is so toxic
---
Well where to begin. Firstly, it‚Äôs the smallest map so you can hear the terror radius pretty much all the time unless it‚Äôs Myers or Pig. Killers might say it‚Äôs bad because there are lots of pallets and windows meaning that it is quite easy to loop killers on The Game. Survivors might say it‚Äôs bad because of the number of drop downs as survivors get stunned at those. There are very few hall blocking pallets meaning that the killer can easily go around. And the basement is usually accessible from anywhere in the map if the killer has Iron Grasp and Agitation. It‚Äôs also just a bit of a meme. Haddonfield could be the worst map if you don‚Äôt have Balanced Landing. Good luck. Have fun. ;)
---
&gt;But I'm just saying the entity enjoys the match more than the outcome and therefore rewards killers for a good match rather than if they win or lose.
---
Just like people enjoy a good fight, that's why more exciting fighters are more marketable. And even though watching a first round ko is impressive nothing sells (and makes you feel like you got your money's worth) than an all out war (like Hunt vs Silva or Frye vs Takayama). That's why promoters say "this is going to be a war" or "this is going to be a blood bath", but you don't see them punishing the winner if their opponent couldn't keep up.
---
That's how it feels if you get a brutal killer even when you kill everyone, like a punishment. A punishment for the mistakes of the survivors and for playing it safe (toying around with the survivors can bite you in the ass).
---
And it feels just as bad when you escape as a survivor and depip.
---
Facecamping only works if the survivors are trash. Try that shit in red ranks and you got 3 survivors teabagging at the open gate while you depip.
---
Show feet
---
Pretty good job from the devs. ;)
---
How about you ignore them lol softie
---
Not according to the new ranking system lol
---
This is some next level shitposting, well played!
---
Lol you sound very angry. You mad the devs made it so you can't hide in lockers all game or something?
---
FTR I play OW, Apex, and DotA. Well. This game does have competition in it. It's literally head to head competition
---
Y'all rude. üòÇ They deleted their post.
---
Lol softie? I‚Äôm not a softie, but when people shit on me this hard on stream and have tons of random people messaging me it gets excessive.
---
Some people, man. What's the context? Do you have a vod link?
---
1 Idk.
---
2 She is good, but not that good.
---
3 Cannibal is worse.
---
4 Survivors can still finish all gens in 4 minutes, so this game is far from being killler sided.
---
5 Leatherface is better than Trapper and non reworked Freddy, but not better than others.
---
6 Claudette prestige is better.
---
7 Nurse and Huntress prestige are better.
---
8 Spine Chill is good, but I don't know if it's that good.
---
9 Balance Landing doesn't need nerfs, but some maps like Haddonfield or Badham Preschool needs rework, because they are too strong for BL users.
---
10 Probably yes.
---
11 Nea is now The Entity.
---
Or if you're anything like me, you get downed because you didn't even know there was a pallet there.
---
**Beacuse**
---
Who messaged you lol and you know you could like always go outside people wont message you there
---
Thanks im using those,but what i meant is there a site where everyone shares and downloads other versions?
---
Girl bye lol, I‚Äôm outside frequently.
---
Sorry, I don't get this argument here, how does noed reward the killer for playing poorly? NOED activates regardless of how you played, you could hook nobody in a game, or you could have one survivor left standing, and you'll still get your free instadowns.
---
It should decrease number of blinks instead. Zero blinks nurse, perfectly balanced - as all things should be.
---
You trying to witch hunt people on a dbd reddit isnt gonna take you very far lol
---
&gt;Purges totem
---
&gt;Killer DCs
---
Reminds me of The Presence from Nine Inch Nails' album Year Zero.
---
Dbd is a casual game lol
---
Asymetric games generally aren't competetive
---
I‚Äôm not trying to witch hunt anyone.. please stop talking to me. You‚Äôre rude.
---
Speaking as someone who hasn't played the game (But has watched it being played) and don't know how I ended up here, It's reading like survivors are just upset they're dying because some Killers are camping the hooks?
---
I have hopes that it would make grind more tolerable at least. But we'll see, I don't really trust BHVR in terms of grind ideas.
---
I feel like DCs are getting so much more common now and its pathetic
---
Nope there still arnt any bans (that I've ever seen) on PS4..who do you normally play as?
---
Ah ok I see, thanks for clearing it up for me! :)
---
Oh? so a totem counter is unfair to the killer? Ya know SWF is a thing :D
---
Alright alright alright
---
Adrenaline is balanced for solo, but almost broken when used by  good SWF teams.
---
It's literally a head to head competition. Having competition doesn't make the game competitive
---
I feel like the poll would have benefited from reducing the number of options.
---
"I'm against the battle pass", "I am for the battle pass", "I am fine either way/don't really care about them" would have been better options.
---
I checked his stream after the first game and it was definitely him. I checked the account in some (not all) of the games where he dced after that, and it was always the same account. So no impersonator at-least.
---
Yeah it really can go either way
---
I know your joking, but several of her addons actually remove blinks...
---
Pretty easy to bully, she can't hit long range hatchets on ps4 reliably, which makes her pretty bad
---
And it shouldn‚Äôt do that either? Where did he claim otherwise
---
I thought that it was only on Haddonfield.
---
Ohh I see, never saw one before.. Are these the only maps with this easteregg or every map has it?? Thx for the explanation :)
---
They're not ideal but work together okay.  Sometimes you get a map where balanced landing just doesn't shine because not enough high grounds. But you got Sprint Burst so you're okay. And even when you are exhausted, you still get fall damage reduction.
---
I think a morgue map for lery's would be cool.
---
Well, a battle pass surely works, you can't deny that. It's a good system with right implementation.
---
No worries, I appreciate the effort of going through with the survey in the first place.
---
How do you think he should play then?
---
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER ADDONS SHOULD REMOVE BLINKS
---
MWHAHAH
---
I used to get upset at getting camped or tunneled, but I don't anymore either. I realised that some games are gonna be bad and I'll get found first and dove on the hook by scummy teammates. Other games will be great for me, never get found, actually loop the killer (which I'm very awful at) and escape. 
---
I try and take the mistakes or tunnels as learning experiences now. If a killer is dead set on chasing me, time to practice looping and mind games. If a killer is gonna camp me, I communicate that with my friends so they know to do gens and help them learn better game sense. 
---
And for what you said about using perks that make people mad, hell yes do that. The perks were put in the game to be used, you can't chastise a player for using them. Sure, it gets boring to play ten games against killers with the same four perks, but survivors do it too. If killers play by survivor rules, they don't stand a chance...
---
Sorry for the long response.
---
Maybe if Nurse only had 1 blink base her addons would be less forgiving and "balanced". Like, omegablink wouldn't be that good if you just had 1 blink, probably everyone would use the +1 blink addon with less room for OP shit.
---
Anyway if it were like that, Nurse would still be good, and Hillbilly will probably be spammed in red ranks...oh wait.
---
It‚Äôs more about having the capability to invest in added infrastructure and the ability to hire people that could improve the quality of the game at a more rapid and effective rate with all the extra funds. To be able to dedicate multiple teams on separate projects so that the game runs and looks its best while also aiming to become even better. A premium pass would fulfill this while also giving players an incentive or feeling of progression/ goal whereas not everyone is interested in every DLC character or getting cosmetics. My friends are an example of this. They never buy any DLC and hardly any cosmetics. Yet, during the hallowed blight/ moonlight event they would go for the lanterns and canker plants even though they had no intention of getting their respective cosmetics. People want something to do and having a free/premium way to do it only benefits both sides.
---
I took about a 6 month break and just recently got back to playing. I‚Äôve been playing with friends though so it‚Äôs a lot more fun. 
---
I think the endgame patch fixed a lot of problems, and from what I‚Äôve seen the future looks promising. Also newer killers like the plague and especially the spirit are a lot of fun to play. I think it‚Äôs worth it to play the game solidly for a week and see how you like it after. Split your time for surv and killer evenly. Have fun!
---
Ok so you say everyone has different opinions then say matter of factly that a certain change made the game better when I know for a fact there‚Äôs still quite a lot of people who disagree with that one. And I know they can‚Äôt please everyone, but the whole point of this is that we all need to voice our opinions. It‚Äôs like you think I‚Äôm saying they HAVE to listen to my opinion and mine only and not take every single one of our opinions into consideration. Are you saying we should stop voicing our opinions that disagree with the battle pass? Once again they have to listen to us all. That‚Äôs the only point that I‚Äôve been reinforcing here. And you agree with that! So why are we going back and forth here still?
---
I saved each of my teammates twice, fixed 4 gens, looped the killer for a while, then got caught. Not only did they not save me, but they called me trash in the post game chat because I was the only one who died.
---
Ever since the Golden tool box meme in the dev stream it‚Äôs hidden in every map of the game *somewhere*
---
Wait you mean like they do in the movies?
---
You forget how many sweaty trihard on are reddit.
---
What is new though, is that Meg can see him while she's awake, so apparently he can enter the real world.
---
I use iron maiden, slightly faster reload and survivors tend to hide in lockers a lot to avoid BBQ so I get a ping on their location
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
Nope, I never said you shouldn't voice your opinion, of course you should. And I'm voicing mine, because I should too. What we're doing is just talking about a topic that concerns us both, that it.
---
But man I won't ever tell to STFO to somebody who says nothing offensive.
---
Frosty or halloween eyes means youre gonna have a bad time. Susie skins tunnel, joey skins dont fuck around.
---
really??? they sure as fuck don't look it. The animated trailers made them seem 20-26
---
Yim yum
---
Exactly! I actually tend to change my 'skill level' depending on how well the team I'm against is, because I want it to be close. I actually feel like a 4k is not a good result for me, because it means I broke their will to live and they gave up, usually. (I mean unless I pull it off last second, of course) So for me a 3k with the last person barely getting away is usually my ideal result, because it means I was terrifying, but there's still a chance of escape.
---
but he's rank 11
---
Yes you do, or else I would‚Äôve gotten Plague‚Äôs achievement 3 times over
---
The little piston thingies tell you percentage too. Each is 25% progress
---
Just m1 and is fixed
---
Alright here‚Äôs Ghostface‚Äôs power in detail.  
---
He‚Äôs a normal movement speed killer, his stealth lasts until a survivor has spotted him, in which it very rapidly drains the meter and he is no longer stealthed (after being spotted it takes 30 seconds to recharge). This is the reason his crouch doesn‚Äôt hide his terror radius (the double stab when crouched is a bug and not part of his power). When stalking he can lean around corners and it stalks faster when doing so. It doesn‚Äôt take very long to stalk someone and expose them, but the timer is also very short, you can also stalk an already exposed survivor to keep them exposed. And that‚Äôs the gist of his power.
---
I just don't think it's optimal from a killers standpoint. Although I get that people are going to gravitate towards the easiest and most simple route to victory, a lot of those players would benefit from not tunnelling as they would learn to be a more efficient killer. 
---
Tunnelling doesn't buy you much time either. It's buying the remaining survivors time as it's going to keep them doing what they were already doing while you are hyper focused on the same dude for an easy hook or kill. When I see the killer tunnelling or chasing the same guy all match, I know I can basically run around doing whatever the fuck I want with little to no caution because his focus is on that guy and not much else.
---
As a killer, I used to always rush back to the hook the second I heard the notification until I started running Devour, Whispers/Nurses and Bitter Murmur (I dont have BBQ or Ruin on most my killers RIP) However it made me a much better killer because it forced me away from the easiest option. I had to pay more attention to what gens had activity and head there for my Devour stack then slowly track back and look for whispers to proc or hope I could catch them healing somewhere.  It took me away from the mindset of always worrying about what is happening at the hook because I learned to capitalize on the benefits from moving away from it: stopped gen progression, catch people out of position and hope to catch them healing.
---
The game feels far more in my control this way. Now those people have to reset to get back to what I pushed them off of. If I chose to re-hook the same guy 30-45 seconds after he was unhooked, I basically just gave the other two-three survivors 45 seconds of worry-free generator time. 
---
&gt;I shouldn't get punished for his teammate farming him.
---
Idunno about that. I always go after the person who farmer in that case  It's out of the farmed guys control and after being on the receiving end of that far too many times, you gotta teach the farmers a lesson just out of principle xD
---
Tried that, didnt fix till i tried tossing a hatchet
---
it IS code for "im being face camped". Thats universally accepted in the dbd community
---
I stopped playing any game that implemented a battle pass. Not for me. We'll see how they implement it. My hopes aren't high. :)
---
No, there‚Äôs one on every map.
---
I saw someone using two instaheals on a medkit yesterday...
---
It took you a few minutes to try that lol?
---
Read my edit
---
Amanda cut herself, so it would prob be gore
---
Maybe, but they weren't coming to save me anyway so it is a calculated risk to try and get help.
---
People probably don‚Äôt like being one shotted, happens with billy as wel.
---
Agree. Sort of like if survivors escape they get gold survival regardless of what happened in the game.
---
I was away for like two years and I got back into it just a few weeks ago and I'm having as much fun as I did back then.  Most lower ranks players are still terrible, so don't get discouraged if you get a random smurf.  
---
If you played during the days of infinite loops and windows, then you should have no issues getting back into it now.  Yeah, there are still some annoying perks on both sides, but nothing that is absolutely game breaking.
---
For all my loyal fans waiting with baited breath, the guy i grabbed DCed while i was stuck. Couldnt get out for a solid 3 minutes, no inputs where working. Tossing a hatchet unlocked me. Last gave the last guy the escape due to 3 DCs and me not really playing to win. Game promptly crashed
---
Honestly I've almost completely stopped playing DbD myself because it's too boring to play the same game mode over and over and over and over again. So if they fuck it up I will be like... okwellseeya
---
It‚Äôs well more than worth it. I hopped back in during the endgame collapse and it‚Äôs fixed a ton of issues I had with the game. I even like playing killer now!
---
It really is just a good feeling sweeping a game after being swept yourself.
---
So long as you don‚Äôt rub it in back at people,  like the random baby Dwight..
---
ballsy not closing hatch first. If she had decisive you would've just fucked yourself
---
That was the sprinkles on my doughnut. ;)
---
"Hmmm, WASD, space and m1 arent working and im locked in an animation due to a feature i haven't happened upon before. I bet m2 would fix the problem for litterally no reason"
---
gonna do me dirty with the downvote for that? XD
---
Personally, I‚Äôve really enjoyed ‚ÄúSave The Best for Last‚Äù on Wraith. I used it once for kicks and have kept it in my main rotation since. Assuming you avoid the obsession, you start steam rolling through teams when at 7-8 stacks.
---
People who have seen this post at least 10 times in the last 8 hours. Stop and wait for the rework
---
Yea but we are going back and forth and going nowhere with our replies XD
---
So we both agree they gotta listen to their consumers opinions. But we disagree on the battlepass just like a lot of people do atm. We agree they are a company and they are gonna do whatever they are gonna do.
---
And I‚Äôll just clarify coz idk if it was clear or if I even said it, can‚Äôt be bothered to scroll... I really don‚Äôt care if they do the battle pass, I simply won‚Äôt buy it just like I won‚Äôt buy the skins, but the game is broke. I love this games premise, but the execution has been poor in a lot of ways. And the constant game breaking bugs need to be addressed like they knew there were bugs in the PTB and still pushed it coz money! They need to better prioritise or a lot of the fan base will continue to dislike BHVR. Really I think this stand against the battle pass is just to make a point to them that we are sick of it and we want a change. Legion was bad and the changes were just as bad and that‚Äôs coz we didn‚Äôt take a stand. So now I guess people are. It‚Äôs not free to play, they don‚Äôt need to push this. They‚Äôve got enough money and this should 100% wait or just not even happen.
---
It‚Äôd right here, I saw the aura-
---
Oh. I see the problem.
---
the same kind of person who tries farming, but grabs the guy off first, wasting HER OWN time
---
It's not so much people hate the idea of the battle pass. it's that they hate it costing money. their should be a reward for playing the game but such things should be FREE.
---
Never condoned what he said was alright was simply stating best thing you can do is move on. Refuse to take on the toxicity of it and live your life to the fullest.
---
Dude a bourd, I this is so pure
---
I've certainly seen all that and I'm happy that has happened, but it's more of a comparison to me. Critical bugs take over a week to get fixed, but in the case of the Lunar event we see bugs that effect their profitability get fixed almost instantly in about a day. Freddy has been waiting on this rework for what, a year now? Many perks are still useless (Left Behind, No One Left Behind, Technician, Vigil, etc.).
---
It's not that I think the game is in a worse place than ever or anything, it's more so that the bug fixes/balance changes seem to only be what they **need** to do, instead of making the game as good as it could be. Instead of hearing the devs saying "we're going to work on fixing things faster and better" all I feel like I'm hearing is "we're working on monetizing the game as best as possible, while making sure that it's still playable."
---
Well... With one blink she would be kinda trashy tbh. What you can do to fix her is tweaking stuff. Like fatigue duration, lunge distance. She isn't completely broken like Legion was, she's a bit too easy to play when you've already learned how blinks work.
---
The only things I'd really change are the camera's FOV(which you can change using the scrollwheel or manually by having the camera in your list of items.) and lighting, lighting can change a shitty rushed thing to something that looks almost profession. It really just takes a lot of practice and time to get stuff to look right but if you're determined you'll definitely get there eventually.
---
Why can‚Äôt people fucking check their spelling before submitting their shit. It‚Äôs not that fucking hard. Takes 2 seconds.
---
If agree with that but honestly that includes killer and survivors. Sometimes I can get lucky and have a killer I can really take for a run and that‚Äôs so fun
---
would be interesting for billy for sure. i think nurse needs a nerf far more then billy does though
---
Also killers getting punished if survivors DC/kill themselves on first hook. I wasted a survivor pudding the other day because three survivors killed themselves on first hook (I felt bad for the last guy so I let him farm for a bit then let him have the hatch).
---
He wont because hes one of those people that will ride that cock of "bhvr is the worst company ever" then the one time they make them happy they go "bhvr is so awesome fuck anyone who ever disagreed with them." Rinse and repeat
---
I'm a switch (typically more bottom) and solely play killer
---
Make em' all PAY!! Hope you are feeling better soon. I promise you, things will be better in time. Pinkie Swear.
---
if a killer is at least decent, they'll get everyone before all gens are done. i understand what are you trying to say but a good killer won't waste a perk slot like NOED while meta perks like Spirit Fury, Enduring, Ruin, BBQ etc exist. usually killers that run NOED have a hard time catching survivors and manage to get 2-3 hooks while hoping that NOED will save them at the end (i know how it is 'cause i was there too)
---
They‚Äôre talking about the survivor adept trophies. You do for the killer ones but not the survivor ones.
---
There is r/PerkByDaylight I suppose but I don't know of any other website.
---
objective is just suppose to be anything you can do passively, while survival is suppose to do with not being killed. If everything a survivor does is in the name of escaping, you could argue anything is survival. I agree that the system needs a change, but diff builds gain more bp in certain areas, as a runner build and a saboteur build have very different purposes, and will get a lot of bp in diff ways. So you can't just buff a section. Its a tricky balance
---
I‚Äôm an idiot lol
---
Unless you play with randoms then they're dumbasses and just open the door
---
And you shouldn't buy it if you think that the game is bad, definitely. That's how market works, you are buying what you like and aren't buying what you don't like. I just can't say anything other than that I have hopes shit will be fixed eventually, so you and me both could have much more joy from playing DbD :)
---
Aw this was really sweet of you, thank you x
---
I find it much more fun to play killers the way I'd like to see killers play. Sure i don't always win but it's fun. I can count the DCs I've gotten on one hand and have rarely seen salty endgame chats, even when I did get 4ks.
---
Dana Delorenzo.  Yummy!
---
This game really needs a concede button that'll just end the match for the survivor and give the killer all the sac points they would've gotten, at least for a two-hook. And, of course, a matchmaking cooldown for the survivor to make sure they're not just spamming matches, joining for a few seconds, and then instantly conceding.
---
Shit hold on let me snap out of it first.
---
I just enjoy a gameplay loop that clicks with me, be it 1,000 hours in dota 2 or 250 in dawn of war 2 retribution. I just see objectives outside of contributing to the session's goal, be it beat the other doods or defeat the boss and get to extraction, as taking me away from why I'm playing.
---
And I quit if I'm playing for the side goal rather than the game.
---
You keep enjoying the challenges if you want to, I'm not you and hold no sway over you!
---
Yeah but they need to artificially elongen the game somehow.
---
Omg yes!!! You had one job and more than plenty of time, you get hooked and see that the Claudette hiding the entire time has finally decided to open the door. Your struggling and before you die you see her aura walking out the exit.  You‚Äôre fucking welcome. -.- üòÇ
---
It almost looks like the little sleep indicator is more intense on one player than the other. Almost like doc madness
---
Honestly me IRL. Every now and then I get really bitter and go ultra tryhard Bamboozle + Enduring + Spirit Fury + Ebony Mori. Sometimes I then run into some default Jakes and default Dwights and feel a tinge of guilt.
---
But most of the time I run into P3 Claudettes and Megs who teabag me and DC so I can't Mori them and then realize I made the right choice.
---
If only Michael Jackson would close his mouth while he ate his popcorn.

Someone made one, got easy upvotes, then everyone jumped on board in a desperate attempt to get there orange nerd arrows

MEGAN &gt;:-[
---
[**Concern.**](/intensifies)
---
Why dh? That perk isn't game breaking. And it's really easy to counter
---
Same but i would just cry that i dont know how to use dead hard untill i realized what that little heart icon on the right does
---
Yeah see this is why I think the pass is fine if it's only cosmetics related, if you want to do it then you can buy the premium pass and enjoy the grind, if you don't then you can ignore it any play as if it never existed.
---
a good killer respects the 4%
---
But they can't just make gens take more time, since that's just boring for everyone involved. Once again, a map-based objective to find parts of something would be nice, but I believe the devs have said they won't do that.
---
What if with every new chapter when you buy the DLC you automatically gain access to the premium tier?
---
You haven't seen me then. The way to play is distraction. They think you'll be easy to down, then you loop and they chase you for a long time because your already injured while your team does gens.
---
Shockingly people dont like just laying on the ground for ages
---
And? I had Trapper at level 1 with no perks when I reached rank 1.
---
A board tho
---
Love this! Baby Dwights are so cute
---
No problem. It only took a sec. I've been there before and understand how tough it looks, but at least you see an "outlet". Maybe it was for the best? (sorry for the cliche)...hope you feel better soon..;)
---
Mommy kink huntress
---
ALL HAIL
---
"BBQ a key perk" BAH.
---
Lol, who needs heals when your already broken?
---
*No mither for the win*
---
probably for PR reasons tbh
---
Every update or new dlc there‚Äôs a game breaking bug but hopefully one day it actually works! I want them to prioritise other things but I understand others just want the option. Hopefully for everyone it gets implemented smoothly.
---
This was downvoted?
---
Yeah, they are all in highschool. Frank is the only one that's legal (in the U.S) because he got kept back.
---
it aint easy karma farming
---
It was for the best as he was a horrible person, it just hurts regardless because we were together for a long time and had future plans. Comments like these really help me x
---
To be fair, she was still opening the gate when the other survivor was hooked. But then, she also should've noticed the blocker and tried to hide.
---
Could this be Freddy rework
---
I think from this he would be in both worlds (Awake and asleep) and would then be more powerful in the dream world eg he is 105% movement speed chasing an awake survivor and if Freddy then sleeps them(which I‚Äôd imagine that it works like the doctors madness ) he would then chase said survivor at 115z movement speed. Idk really maybe freddys‚Äùshock‚Äù would work on a charge
---
This crap happened to me yesterday. I was Nea ran the killer around till the end I had a crispy Dead Hard as I was coming close to the gate. All 3 lights were lit and the Nea that was opening the gate decided to let go of the gate turn around and point at me. I had to use the Dead Hard to run into a wall dodging the hit Billy yetted at me buttttt as you can imagine by the time the gate opened he struck me and fucked me. While my other 3 mates just tea bagged and I was dead on hook. I also popped a BPS which made me sadder :(
---
&gt; not many people are at that point.
---
The factual information. I call myself ok at best, but trapper and hag still get me a lot of the time
---
then BEhavior need to learn what a fucking teenager looks like. Take fucking dwight as an example, he looks like a 27 year old crack head. HES SUPPOSE TO BE FUCKING 14
---
Your argument in favor of Adrenaline assume I run Ruin. 
---
I don't think Adrenaline is OP, but it's deserved either. Ruin too. They're both just poorly designed perks.
---
If I‚Äôm playing with Randos and nobody is down, Killer doesn‚Äôt have Noed and nobody is on hook you better believe im gonna open the door.
---
You don't just get to level 11 quickly especially with the new emblem system. I find it implausible that someone would spend the time to get to rank 11 and not learn about the infamous Freddy especially with his rework being planned
---
That means it's legit...
---
you got a gg from them, but you didn't get a good game
---
So she should be in the lowest tier
---
Yup I agree! - they need to focus on adding more to the game. This game is severely lacking in gameplay features. That moonlight event was only interesting to me because of the small added objective. Gens and looping alone do not make a full game.
---
Still makes me sick that people actually do this
---
Mine was like the first, everyone else is a copycat or didn't check. Speculation is always fun, unfortunately all I've had is people being dismissive.
---
**BOARD**  
---
*e*xc*u*s*e* m*e* w*h*a*t* t*h*e *f*u*c*k
---
It got downvoted because people love to hate. People love to bitch about shit.
---
okay it's been a while, i forgot they're called pallets
---
Lol true. Like I said, it'd probably need to be limited with a cooldown or it could even be required to gain charges somehow.
---
ok
---
Had a game like this a few months ago that *still* irks me to this day. Was just me and a Kate left and I popped the last gen. I then got chased by a Michael for the entire duration of his T3, chased some *more,* and then finally got downed in front of a closed door. Saw the Kate's aura just standing in the other exit maybe 50m away. The chase lasted long enough for her to open at least 5 doors.
---
Where were you on smile Sunday üëÄ
---
Woah wheres Nea?!?!?
---
Yeah I know they're pallets, not boards, it's been a while. Can everyone shut up about it?
---
I understand what you‚Äôre getting at.
---
A phone power would have been more iconic Ghostface.
---
However, I do think this DBD version does portray Ghostface well. Ghostface in movies is incredibly stealthy. Peeking corners to give exposed effect is how he jumpscares in the movies, especially since he does not have a heartbeat while peeking.
---
Nah it was just like a meg - never did the gen
---
I explicitly said when it‚Äôs used in combination with those other perks, hence the plus signs.  On its own I have 0 problems with it, but when you‚Äôre combining it with 3 injured get out of jail free cards it becomes pretty damn irritating to deal with, even if it‚Äôs not overpowered
---
Hey, that would be a good way to introduce Robert Englund's Freddy, just have two variations you can switch between.
---
Fair enough.
---
Happens to all of us man haha
---
‚ÄúDing ‚ÄúDing ‚ÄúDing‚Äù
---
*killer dcs*
---
üÖ±Ô∏è
---
Hey man, board or no board, I still think its a funny ass meme.
---
This, I got 5/5 tryhard palletlooper at rank 15 as a killer.
---
Well, as a survivor I still got the typical rank 15 survivors ala "What is a gen?"
---
‚ÄúEveryone has Hag dipshit, it came free with your fucking xbox.‚Äù
---
hey lil momma lemme whisper in ya ear
---
It's not really "bugged out". It's just unbalanced. DBD isn't half as bad as F13 was in terms of bugs.
---
The only time Legion and Nurse would get the same rank on a killer tier list.
---
I‚Äôd reckon that he only needs a slight speed decrease. That‚Äôs just me and I don‚Äôt care if I get downvoted to oblivion, but a solid nurse makes the game unfun at best
---
Of course, you can also just kill your network connection for a minute and DC intentionally without sound, and keep all the items you were carrying and get the escape BP bonus.
---
prob not, but we'll see
---
I have to disagree again. If the streamer said the n-word we wouldn't be having this discussion.
---
yeah, when this happened the person started buttdancing and i just immediately chainsawed them
---
I got merciless killer in a match that my only contribution to the game was selecting bloody party streamers. Some idiot got killed by end game collapse. I think the formula might be skewed a bit.
---
Lol. I have no idea why
---
ill never hear the end of it
---
The match has no obsession so theres no DS, however they should have still closed it for the points
---
I dont think so. He already gets looped like any other killer. I just think gas would be neat because the killer would have to decide on opportune times to pull out the chainsaw. And solid nurse's make the game un winnable. Literally.
---
the game actually has 0 saw reference since a reference is something talking about something that it isn't and has little relation to, however the saw map is saw, and is therefore not a reference
---
DCing was not fixed. 3 survivor games were fixed.
---
I just open the door. Is this bad? It seems like there‚Äôs more than enough time to get out
---
That‚Äôd be neat. But shit hitboxes + PS4 gives the Billy a free down off of me, even if they were being greedy whereas other killers is just a hit. And a lot of solid nurses mess up on predictions unless they have 3 or more blinks. I feel bad for even solid 2 blink nurses.
---
A healthy buff for trapper is If they put the brown bag and gloves addons into his base kit allowing a slight edge in the early game.
---
PepeLaugh
---
Is this recent then? I don't remember ever DCing mid match. It happened quite frequently on loading screens but not mid match.
---
Someone was telling me it got fixed and I was gonna get perma banned for Dcing.
---
What distinguishes A from B tier?
---
Introducing pigs new ability:
---
Explosive RBT
---
The explosive bear trap instantly kills any downed survivors, and survivors in radius of them. 
---
New add ins include: nuclear bomb, giving the explosion an effective range across the entire map.
---
Nah bro she got a nice lil butt butt
---
Lil Butt Butt
---
And then it turns out to be Haunted Ground and you realize you‚Äôve made a grave mistake. :(
---
I bend the knee to the queen of...pigs ?
---
Says a killer main xoxo
---
Pumpkin head nurse garunteed 3 gen chase then get camped
---
Only things upvoted on this sub is memes lol becuase this community is so loverly to eachother
---
I was in a game last night against a hag and felt really bad. I run small game and when the match loaded my perk went off. I spawned right next to a lit totem with the 3 other survivors. I got to work on it and hex: thrill popped up. The other 3 crouched behind me forming a wall. When it cleansed, thrill went away. Hag got to us a second after it finished. While being chased two more hex totems were cleansed. All within the first 1-2 min of the match. I am honestly surprised she did not DC. She was running BBQ with 3 hex perks; Thrill, Ruin and Devour hope.
---
version without watermark + more efficient resolution

---
I was in a match where I did three gens, opened a gate, and saved my teammate (that was getting camped, killer only hooked two people and camped both first was in basement) and made it out of the exit so they could get the hatch and the person who got basement camped said that I didn‚Äôt do anything all game and the person who got the hatch got all upset over it, guess I should‚Äôve just left them to die.
---
It was trying it‚Äôs best :(
---
not true, you get obsession after you stab him, he had no way of knowing
---
Oh my god that is fucking dumb.
---
&gt;1 person gets a double pip at rank 11
---
&gt;"he's not bottom tier guys"
---
cringe
---
I dont get what the issue is when people complain about tunenling or camping. 
---
The Killers goal is to get kills and make sure people dont get away. So...why would i avoid the person who is already weaker then the others so i can kill them faster? Why would i purposefully NOT try to win?
---
Get within M1 range, either use short charge add ons to quickly charge the chainsaw and hold down m2 until you hit them. Or if you don't have add ons do a thing called back revving which his charging it so it almost goes and holding it by letting go and holding down m2. This lets you see how the survivor will dodge so you can predict their movements to get the hit. And don't rev the saw if they are near a window/ r e a l l y close to a pallet. Also bind your turn keys to Q and E in the options to have better control over your turning. Then just practice
---
The first Rob Zombie Halloween wasn‚Äôt that bad. He tried a new spin on the old classic and it turned out ok. The second one is one of the worst movies ever made. A true, what the fuck was he thinking type movie. 
---
The 2018 Halloween is right behind the original for best in the series and I think they need to do what they can to get Laurie and Michaels cosmetics from that film. Adding her daughter and/or granddaughter would be awesome too.
---
The reason everyone runs around is because a few streamers made it popular by annoying killers and playing toxic. It's still entirely valid to play stealthily. You're in trouble if you get caught, but once you know how killers can reveal auras, it's not too hard to avoid that. However, because everyone else refuses stealth, you'll often see your team dying way before you do. Good news is that you don't need them to escape anymore, since the single-survivor escape hatch opens whenever there's just one person left.
---
I'd say it's worth coming back and giving it a shot. Playing survivor is a pretty chill experience once you get used to it, and playing killer is wicked fun if the survivors aren't being rude.
---
Yeah but doesnt it make an obsession at the start of the match as long as someone is running it?
---
I‚Äôm a merciful killer, because I‚Äôm a survivor main. I‚Äôll never try for a 4K unless the survivors are dumb. I had one two left: one on hook, one down by the hook on top of the hatch. I was going to let the one down escape through the hatch once their friend died on hook, but NOOOOOOO she had to use unbreakable and get up and sprint away for some reason.. I tried to be nice, but that don‚Äôt fly. IM IN CONTROL HERE!
---
There was a glitch (~~might still exist IDK~~) where if you opened the exit gate the sound would play like it opened, and the bar would disappear, but it never actually did open. You'd be down a whole door, but I never heard of that happening to both doors
---
The differnce with the pig changes is we KNEW what they ac uallty were. 
---
We have no idea what his power acuallty does yet
---
This, I love it
---
Love the way you blinded her third eye. Forcibly deactivate her almonds.
---
i didn't know that was a thing you could do, that's pretty cool. although i personally don't need the no watermark thing (since i made it), that could be pretty useful
---
Think its just sarcasm. But it will be interesting to see what changes are done to him.
---
That ass.
---
What if they made the dream world from his view not be hard to see? Did anyone else think of that but me?
---
Yup, completely agreed.  I try to play games as though I'm playing with friends who hold controllers in their hands right next to me.  It's when they're not playing the same way that I start to amp things up.
---
its for everyone else
---
Honestly that‚Äôs a good thing,  now there‚Äôs less reason for him to tunnel and camp.
---
&gt; Laurie looks around for her brother 
---
That's not canon anymore (and was a pretty silly plotline in the first place IMO), but yes, she does look all around in paranoia at the campfire. 
---
And yes, all of the animations are just awesome, definitely agree. Didn't hurt anything, just added flavor where there was none. I'm still glad they did. :)
---
So frustrating to be the hooked one, especially when your team chooses to crouch around you instead of punishing the killer by genrushing. Like if I‚Äôm going to die with almost no bloodpoints and having to stay in a boring af game to buy my teammates time, they better at least make my sacrifice worth it by getting shit done so everyone else can get out.
