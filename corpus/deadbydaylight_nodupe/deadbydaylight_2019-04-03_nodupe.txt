I‚Äôll just tunnel a key. 
---
---
---
I thought he had OOO
---
You know that werewolves are different from furries..right? And nice to see more furry haters XD 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs fun, I play solo so I‚Äôm stuck with trash team mates, so fun, 
---
I played a guy (who was a streamer!) who lost his mind in the post-game chat saying that the survivors sexually assaulted him by t-bagging on pallets.
---

---
I went to his stream and he was 100% serious. 
---
Some people are just morons.
---
Ironic.
---
If we ever played together, I work with everyone. &lt;3 
---
I went to his stream and he was 100% serious. He was absolutely raging about it.
---
If we're talking best perks and add ons, spirit is indeed better(prayer beads+yakuyoke amulet is insane and is better than insta saw imo) but I'm talking in a normal game(best perks and good, not best add ons or no add ons) I think Billy is better because with Billy you can 1 shot even at pallets because he doesn't get slowed down like lf. He can also chainsaw bait at pallets, break pallets with his chainsaw and his map pressure is better than the spirits(can get to the end of the map even faster than a spirit with mother daughter ring) and doesn't get punished for it like spirit does, costing her the chase potential at the expense of map pressure. Spirit is better at 1v1s and Billy is better at map pressure but Billy also has 1 shot potential and does not lose his map pressure at the cost of 1 shot or vice versa like spirit does. Spirit is also harder to use than Billy but overall they're both really strong and I'm glad spirit is strong because I remember back when she first came out, she wasn't the best 
---
Nice, you nearly got a pip from that!
---
I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt be considered an m1. I mean, you literally have to press m1. The only killers that ‚Äúcounter ‚Äú it is huntress billy legion (technically) and leatherface. Pig doesn‚Äôt get that many dash attacks, but I suppose those hits wouldn‚Äôt count either. A blink is just a movement power.
---
I noticed this too. Must be a bug.
---
a map that doesn't suck and doesn't have awful loops like the Plague map 
---
I know this is a joke and all (and I love the pun), but I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm pretty pleased with the stuff the devs are putting out atm. Demise of the Faithful was great, I loved all three parts to it. Ash is an amazing addition, and him having actual voice lines by Bruce Campbell is tremendous. Dedicated Servers are almost upon us. All they need to do now is add Halloween 2018 cosmetics and I‚Äôll honestly excuse Legion and Freddy‚Äôs poor treatment. 
---
Survivors wanna do gens easily and nothing else. Vile Purge makes it so that they have to make decisions and that's no good
---
If you don't mind me asking which perspective is this from? (Part of research is knowing the subjects)
---
100 percent a bug.
---
Alright, it sounds pretty cool
---
Oh dear. Broken perk is broken. Now i cant use an op perk against all killers. Waaah!!!
---
Lmao. I just imagine Trapper with his hands on his knees wheezing "hey \*huff huff\* can you guys \*huff huff\* slow down a bit?"
---
Alright Im done talking to someone if theyre going to be dishonest in a debate. ‚ÄúI never said nerf‚Äù ‚ÄúI dont want it changed, I want it nerfed!‚Äù Adios
---
Look them up
---
Dwight looks like a turkey tho
---
Nice. If you read any of my comments you'd know that this comment isn't so much about the post as it is it's invalidity. He was just mad cause I killed him first. I prioritized sacrificing him over other survivors cause he was injured and hooked. I didn't, however, prioritize him over survivors on gens, so I think I played fair. He was just salty. Survivors always seem to have an attitude that implies you should go easy on them, and they yell at you if you don't. That's not how I play, so I get yelled at a lot.
---
If I say please? ;-;
---
1st perk look it up. 2nd it‚Äôs faster then making this post. 3rd legit don‚Äôt be lazy
---
Ash's hand is really buggy. All of them except for his default clip with basically everything, and even his default clips a bit with toolboxes.
---
David is now the new Claudette 
---
Call me twisted or a sadist but I love Mori'ing streamers and clipping their reaction.
---
Honestly not worth it.
---
Mettle is the only decent one but it's very dependent on the killer.
---
Good. This perk is basically old DS reborn. The aura reading doesn‚Äôt mean that much when Survivors gain some progress on or complete a gen because of a wasted chase. 
---
I‚Äôve definitely had cases where survivors look similar and the unhooked one is healed super quick and I happen to catch them with a billy saw as they leave. I felt punished even though I wouldn‚Äôt say I was tunneling, I just sawed the only survivor in the area I found who was fully healed. Probably 40-50 seconds after the unhook so I technically could‚Äôve avoided it, but when they were healed I completely blanked on it
---
Cuts off the poor puppet's tongue. Press F to pay respects.
---
Until then üîå‚ùå
---
I believe this is because hitting a survivor immediately after a blink (before she is exhausted) counts as using her power not as a normal attack. This will need to be corrected in the next patch
---
All of the games mechanics are balanced around looping. It is absolutely the way the game was intended to be played. Given that it is *the* fundamental interaction mechanic between the killer and survivors, it will not change. If you don't like looping, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong game.
---
Yeah spirit really suffered from "how do you play her properly" syndrome. I remember when alot of people where saying she was worse than freddy. I do wish the game had more "nurse like killers" because well in an asymmetrical multiplayer game the few are supposed to be much stronger initially than the many. The game doesn't feel that way when you're hell not even new if you're at my level (rank 9 killer). I dont expect to get a 4k every game but it should be easy to get 2 kills imo. It seems you either get a 3/4k or they all leave lol. (Sorry for balance rant üòÖ)
---
I don't think being addon reliant is a big negative though because every killer except nurse is addon reliant. Spirit is a strange case cause her good addons make her a whole lot stronger. Still my main point is while yes Billy has the pallet mind games with the pump fake it's pretty obvious when he's faking and when he isn't. (I'm only a rank 11 survivor so I probably never faced a good billy). Spirit on the other hand her mind games for the most part get her a hit and are always 50/50s. With Billy they are still more or less reactionary. 
---
That being said I agree with you're points for the most part and again this is probably the closest gap between the top 5 killers on my list. So either way these both are definitely deserving of 2/3.  Dont take my points as ragging on your killer if you like Billy btw. He is 100% really strong. I enjoy learning the different perspectives and why people think the things they do in the game. So I just bring up counter points to help me figure it all out lol.
---
Is Bruce Campbell voicing the character‚Äôs grunting/pain sounds or only the lines in the lobby?
---
Actually, I had a question about that. Does it permanently show your aura to the killer? Or is it for a set amount of time, I can't seem to find it/am confused on the wording.
---
Was it glitched? I thought it performed as intended and they just changed what the intention was because they realized it was pretty bad
---
Queer? Nice homophobic slur. Why? Because you dont like him?
---
I dont like playing against legion either but lets be real, somehow its ok for survivors to abuse broken loops or bring DS for over 2 years.
---
Self Care too, so you can 99% heal yourself, proc Mettle then fully heal
---
i think ash is into ***big strong mama***
---
OP getting killed in the comment. Oof
---
now i can stop spending points on claudette ;')
---
If a dick is 0 inches, does it exist?
---
that's not very big!
---
Shhhhhhhhhh
---
You on PC? I'd totes SWF up with you to see this.
---
Happened to me two. I had two DC‚Äôs like I need shards but can‚Äôt really drag the game out when it‚Äôs a 2 v 1
---
If I‚Äôm understanding it right, it gives survivors a 4 second head start. 4 seconds is *a lot* of time. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be OP, but eating one without enduring is gonna feel very bad
---
Can I be honest with you?  I don't think they're rage quitting against you the killer so much as they may be rage quitting against their survivor teamates.  I don't think there is a thing wrong with Plague.  But I despise playing against her because of my boosted teamates that have no idea how to play her.  They constantly feed you guys corrupted purges which you use to snowball hooks instead of keeping you weak by denying you this massive buff and simply repair the gens instead of cleansing.  I'm certainly not advocating ragequitting against Plagues because of this but I can not tell you how many times I've been murdered by my teamates corrupted purges.  My favorite move is when they feed her this.  It's used on me.  They then farm me in front of her where I'm corrupted to the ground before I can take one step from the hook.  It is extremely frustrating.  It's like playing with teamates that sprint to every hook against Hag.  Teamates make her a miserable experience to play against imo.  
---
Sorry. I don‚Äôt add strangers. But thanks for the offer :)
---
BBQ WHEN?
---
If you let Exodia Myers get to tier 3, you all deserve to die. It takes 5 millennia get to there.
---
I normally don‚Äôt have a problem playing against him, my problem is my teammates dc‚Äôing against him. Usually it‚Äôs just me and one other survivor crouching around the map.
---
Ash teachables.
---
Level 30 - Flip Flop
---
- 50% of your recovery progression is converted into your wiggle progression. This means that if you recover to the max then when the killer picks you up you will already have 50% wiggle progression. Great against slugging killers.
---
Lvl 35 - Buckle up
---
- You see the aura of slugged survivors from 48 m away. The intensity of their aura highlights how much they have recovered. When you heal them from the dying state to the injured state both you &amp; the survivor can see the killers aura for 6 seconds
---
lvl 40 - Mettle of Man
---
After getting hit 3 times by a Killer's basic attack, Mettle Of Man activates.
---
Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the Dying State from the Injured State is ignored.
---
The next time you heal back to full health, your Aura will be revealed to the Killer when you are farther than 16 metres from the Killer.
---
Mettle Of Man will deactivate the next time you are put into the Dying State.
---
I have waited for this day to come for a very long time 
---
Platform? I was playing a 3 player queue for the last hour+ and never had to wait more than a few minutes.
---
It's almost as if a tank with no treads still has a cannon on it... because it's hindered. Since the tracks were destroyed. 
---
That's why it's an anti-tank mine. It hinders. In the same way DS can hinder a killer.  As an anti-tunnel perk.
---
No one is gonna mention the two on the left with no feet?
---
Yes with an awesome Mori 
---
That's the only version that exists to me XD 
---
It was actually 4 seconds. It was just bugged (and never fixed...) so that it was 5 seconds.
---
Me too @.@
---
When you buy leatherface!
---
I myself use M&amp;A (16m terror), Whispers (I don't have BBQ), Ruin and Make Your Choice.
---
I'm thinking it's A.
---
Xbox. 
---
You‚Äôll be waiting for quite a while mate.
---
People's biggest problem is his absurd map pressure in the right hands. However that's key to his design. But just play devil's advocate.
---
But if u use M&amp;A ur phase sound is heard everywere. And Whispers is realy good pick? Does it helps?
---
An old killer walking through his field with his grandson.
---
"Billy, you see that fence there? Your father and I built that fence with our own two hands.
---
''Yeah... That's great grandpa.'
---
"But do they call me 'Bubba the fence builder'? NO!
---
"And that barn Billy, do you see that barn? My father and I built that barn long ago together. But do they call me 'Bubba the barn builder'? No, Billy...they do not.
---
"But you camp *one* survivor...."
---
I love Bloodhound for tracking blood with fathers glasses! Stridor for when your phasing looking for a injured survivor you're chasing, it helps! Other than BBQ you've got a good setup. If you do Bloodhound, Predator, and Sloppy Butcher you'll be able to track scratch marks and blood easier. My setup is Ruin, ToTH, MYC and BBQ, Although I could swap out MYC for Monitor and Abuse for giggles haha. Nurses Calling is always good too if you're not phasing and you lost an injured survivor.
---
Torso
---
He died in the game and so did Detective Tapp in the movie 
---
Obviously living isn‚Äôt a qualifier for ending up in the entity 
---
Because it removes a large amount of counterplay away from the other side.  Obviously most ppl are going to pair it with infantry belt, it‚Äôs just not fun to be found and have no say in the outcome of the chase.  Yea a good survivor may juke a couple of hatchets at first, but a good huntress won‚Äôt miss much for long.  When there is no counterplay or very limited counterplay allowed from the other side, you‚Äôre basically playing a single player game against bots.
---
Same reason Legion is a horrible design
---
You better have been playing as Pig for source material accuracy.
---
Ok
---
Love the brick.

---
Been waiting on bloodhound for legion
---
Imagine this, Dead Hard, and Adrenaline. It would take seven, yes, \*seven\*, hits/swipes to down someone. Even more if they have an insta-heal.
---
Nice perks except for Bloodhound 
---
K: killer
---
I: interesting
---
L: Long
---
L: help
---
E: oh god please help they're looping me
---
R: please this is a legitimate call for help 
---
And yet. . . not mettle of man so
---
If there is stuff in the store for him...does that mean he's gonna get cosmetics like the other in-house survivors...?
---
And spent more money on the game dev team to be able to fix bugs and issues in a more timely manner.
---
I noticed this earlier. So far Legion Frenzy hits and Hag Phantasm attacks don't count either. I'm assuming any M1 attack that gives deviousness doesn't count, such as Pig's ambush. I wonder if surprise hits from Wraith count?
---
All in all I was very disappointed. Near unusable against many killers, while putting you at a disadvantage. 
---
Well if you don't tunnel why are you upset about it?
---
Not related but happy cake day
---
I bought it the moment I saw that here. The puppet hold the toolbox handle with his mouth. GG game of the year.
---
I think MYC is good choise, but how M&amp;A helps her if phase sound is heareble when u isn't in a chase?
---
Sounds like this killer needs help... mental help... The players in this game lol.. I play killer on PS4, Spirit and Hag mainly. I get my ass handed to me from time to time, and by getting my ass handed to me I mean no one dies lol. Some survivors are just REALLY coordinated.. Damn 4 man SWF groups really get me to concentrate though. 
---
Thanks 
---
Ok, got it. So I have to keep hitting him essentially to get it to deactivate. Just adds an extra hit in there pretty much.
---
Probably would be the case anyway
---
100 percent rank 20
---
Poor baby killer
---
Most people had been saying DS was broken and for years, and broken loops? Assuming your talking about infinite‚Äôs and pseudos, everyone thinks they were bullshit, come on man. 
---
Make em toxic plays
---
I've only used it once on her, it was when I was using prayer beads and Nurses Calling.
---
This is why I play Plag. Correct purge hits both the savior and dude who was on hook. Not tunnle if I get them both right?
---

Ah yes, because everything in this game works as intended 100% of the time. /s
---
Since I bought the game this is the only shrine I cared about. I already had Self-Care but I would‚Äôve gotten that perk ASAP. Rancor I wanted sense I read the description and Ace in the Hole seems like a kinda useful meme perk and I like that. I don‚Äôt care too much for the other perk but it does seem okay.   
---
Can‚Äôt wait to put Rancor on my rank 20 Freddy end game build, hooray! &gt;:)

From the killer's perspective: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/405218076?t=09m44s
---
The torso is connected to the head so the Torso cosmetic (P1) will make both bloody.
---
Honestly? I just like Ash :D
---
took me a minute
---
Well that sorta depends on whether you‚Äôre doing that every single time someone tries to make a save or not now wouldn‚Äôt it. If you‚Äôre always getting those opportunities and always near the hook, it‚Äôs almost the same as chilling with Bubba. 
---
Why do you play DbD on university's laptop
---
Wether the case, The Entity has strict rules on communication and forms of vocal.
---
&gt;  The balance is in our favor as killers at this point.
---
Considering pow prevalent SWF is, nah
---
Thats why I play nurse with BBQ and whispers 
---
Calm down lol, maybe they just forgot to do it or didn't have time to create the animation as they were busy working on releasing Ash.
---
I hear people saying that Mettle of Man isn't affected by hatchet hits but mine proced anyways when I was hit by one.
---
Fair enough. As Ash's perks go, though, I like Flip Flop the most, honestly. I get slugged a lot, and it pairs really well with Unbreakable. 
---
Its to flex on others. Also I P3ed one character for the trophy and since I went that far I then chose that character to be my ‚Äúmain‚Äù and tried to get all perks unlocked on them (Meg....and recently Jane).

[removed]
---
It's a DLC of Ashley Angel from O-Town as a playable Survivor exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version.
---
Tunneled as in, the guy hooked me, went invisible to camp me, and then proceeded to, for the rest of the game, do nothing but chase me. Those 4 gens weren't rushed, either; it was maybe 1 every 80-100 seconds, usual times, because the survivors were smart. I chased him some and was hooked when the first gen popped. The second popped shortly after I got off, and the next 3 gens, he was chasing me. So I call the first gen part of the 4 gen total. And then for one of the exit gates and like 25% of another. The only reason he didn't get me down again is Mettle of Man.
---
....Ok buddy. 
---
Jake x Quentin gives me life.
---
Did you stalk my history &gt;.&gt; lol 
---
&gt; Killers choose to allow themselves to be gen-rushed by over committing to chases and not pressuring the gens.
---
Not always true. I played a Trapper match the other day on Yamaoka's where I set two traps, grabbed a third and went across the map. By the time I got to the first gen, two survivors were on it just finishing it up. I landed a last second hit on one of them, 5 seconds later downed her (bad runner) and then two more popped. So 3 gens in the first two minutes. What was I supposed to do? Just not set any traps?
---
Gen speed is an issue and it's not just killers playing poorly
---
groovy
---
Haha &lt;3
---
If i had money i would buy leatherface but only for bbq and because i am fan of movie, and would probably very rarely play him because we all know how much leatherface sucks, its like those cereals where you get toys when you buy them. You really want that toy but cereals suck.
---
Same here. Michiganders for life.
---
Hit, Dead Hard, Hit, Hook. (3 swings.)
---
After unhook, left alone then chased:
---
- Hit.
---
- Dead Hard but you don't swing because you know it's there.
---
- Mettle of Man used.
---
- Self-Care to pop the last 1% on a heal they saved and hit.
---
- Adrenaline but you're still chasing that demon for some reason and hit.
---
- Instaheal because why the fuck not and hit.
---
- Final hit and hook. 
---
(6-7 Swings depending)
---
I don't know, that's honestly pretty much the most that can happen, and it's really unlikely. Dead Hard also is really likely to whiff or only buy an extra single loop once you know it's there, and if it does, those two hits are quick, and that erases Mettle of Man.
---
Again, coordinated teams could make this hellish, but only with the room to breathe and some heavy practice, and only against basic M1 killers.
---
Idiot
---
I wish we didn't have to pay $10 for a character's cosmetic that you had to pay $5 in first place
---
Nope I'm easily making the argument that even against swf the games are in our control as killer at this point.  They're more challenging sure, but ultimately you can still beat sweat squad swf's as well.  I think we as killers lost the right to blame every loss on a swf like 5 updates ago.  They keep going hard in our direction with the buffs as of late to make up for the fact that they completely neglected us for like 2 years lol.  Honestly I don't have an issue with most of the games maps at this point.  The only ones that are still pretty rough imo are some of the Coldwind setups.  A lot of the most recent maps aren't even strong looping maps they're built for immersive plebs to hide around haha.  
---
Make it so when you bleed out in locker, you fall out.
---
If you are hit mid slide into dying, something to reflect your character losing power during that slide, like maybe letting go of the palette and sort of falling onto their back, rolling around and then crawling.
---
When you escape through hatch your character sort of slides into it if you crawled to it.
---
How about when you're hit? Why do you react the same when you're hit from the front/back/left/right? Or how you're holding what was hit.
---
Also I never liked how we are feeling up totems, since totems require a full dedicated removal there surely can be something that makes more sense as an animation. 
---
I personally never understood where the whole shirtless Myers thing originated from, nor do I understand it seeing how he wears a jumpsuit so can't even be shirtless 
---
I don't play billy :/
---
I knew it was gonna be DS as soon as I read it. Let see if they take two years to nerf it too XD 
---
Oh my God I just leveled up claudette 
---
Also, plagues corrupt purge wouldn‚Äôt count for it
---
Excuse me that perk is essential for the Michael Jackson Legion build.
---
Same üò≠
---
I'm all about managing time, so I would suggest a detection perk such as BBQ, or Whispers. You'll definitely find people camping near a lit totem with you around thinking you're not running whispers.
---
This but unironically OWO
---
That's completely absurd if you think that and I highly doubt you play killer now. Like, this is pure "survivor main who has never once played killer before" shit you're saying. The downplaying SWF, the feverish insistence on totally overstating how severe the buffs/nerfs were, etc. The whole bad faith survivor enchilada.
---
&gt; A lot of the most recent maps aren't even strong looping maps they're built for immersive plebs to hide around haha.
---
Now I'm not sure if you even play the game. Two of the last 3 maps are extremely strong for looping
---
&gt;and only against basic M1 killers
---
Therein lies a huge part of the problem. 
---
Surveillance is amazing on Spirit for sure, especially if you're using prayer beads.... hehe.
---
Its just takes forever and it blows
---
I got BBQ before it disappeared from the store.
---
Oh, you mean that thing you can just get rid of before it ever even pops? That thing? Yeah.
---
Those offerings award bp after game. It's only a bonus of what you got. 4k bp in sacrifice with a 100% offering means you'll get a bonus 4000 at the end but it won't affect anything in the category

It's telling you how to avoid getting gen rushed in 90% of your games and it works consistently for me at rank 1 with no NOED maining trapper, Wraith and Freddy so yes it is relevant.

---
After the nerf, does Botany affect Self Care? If so how much?
---
My friend tells me it doesn't, or that if it does its very little, but I cant find a recent answer online. Shouldn't your self heal speed by 83% normal with Self Care and Botany?
---
Ash doing God's work lmao.
---
Going against four survivors wielding S-tier perks is hard for and isn't fun for the killer either, but I noticed you didn't mention that. By your own logic, survivors shouldn't be able to do that anymore, either. Plus, the "tier list" is completely arbitrary and community-made. 
---
My favorite build by far, I don't have Discordance on my Spirit yet so I usually use Whispers in the meantime. 
---
You're right man I was just tilted from the game I just played I think.
---
Same here. Bruce is pretty cool. Sadly hes just second my on list. My heart belongs to Jason Statham.
---
He was fantastic in Burn Notice.
---
What the fuck does he cut off?
---
I don't care about Ruin anymore since I can 90% of the time get the skillchecks! Until another survivor comes along... lol.
---
Point proven.

Damn, he must have had a rough day at school or something

That aint survivor blood...

That stuff is hella old, just never got used.

I'm pretty sure that was a /s.
---
i am fully aware it is a complex situation, but that doesn't mean i'll ever stop praying for a shirtless myers lol. a prayer a day keeps the noed away. 
---
I like Flip Flop better, honestly. Pairs well with Unbreakable and I get slugged a lot. 
---
It has begun. They will soon put in a new mode where Ash is the killer, and the Killers are the survivors. As for gameplay Ash‚Äôs ability will be determined by Pickups.
---
Boomstick: a somewhat short ranged attack.
---
Necronomicon ex Mortis: summons deadlines as a trap. Or creates portals for some fun shenanigans.
---
Chainsaw. Turns him into a mini Leatherface.
---
Can‚Äôt imagine why...
---
People like things that look cool and some people think bloody clothes look cool.
---
I don‚Äôt P3 to flex on others I just do it because I like the way it looks on the chars I pick for them. I also only choose chars to P3 who already have limited cosmetic options like Quentin.
---
I've been running the hardest thing to come across with Legion. You might not have played me. I'm on PS4. But I've been torturing people to the point of DC's. Both Freddy and Legion 
---
Ash got these cosmetics likely cause they asked to do them when getting the license for ash, the older licensed characters will still need to be approved by the license holders.
---
Yeah probably but for now it makes it a dead perk against nurse.
---
My bad, I thought the single category bp offerings and the 25% in all category ones were like Distressing, or Thrill of the Hunt in that it increased the BP gain in the match making it easier to achieve max points in the category. I also thought that escape cake, pudding, and Bloody Party Streamers were the different because they specified that they rewarded the points post trial. I hadn't realized that they were all working this way.

These have been in the files for a long ass time already
---
it is a paid dlc like leatherface's: it only includes ash, no killer. it costs 500 auric cells, or $5 dollars, though if you buy the actual dlc pack you get a (lame) exclusive item. his base perks should be fun to play with, and i'd recommend you read them yourself to avoid confusion lol
---

---
Thanks ^^
---
Think about dropping Rancor and throwing in Bitter Murmer. Excellency tracking perk
---
Or you could just not tunnel? Then you can remove the BT and DS part.
---
Fucking facts yo
---
i watch her because i find her entertaining but sometimes all the shit talk gets annoying and i go watch someone else
---
Rumour has it BHVR are close to doing Halloween 2018 cosmetics, so Myers with his old, withered mask and Laurie as an old woman could be on the way. They have mentioned in the past that they were having talks with ‚Äòa certain license holder‚Äô and that they were ‚Äògoing well‚Äô (Source: one of the developer live streams). 
---
i came to the same conclusion! i hope whoever was in charge of managing the license terms for ash tries to get a similar treatment for the other characters. it sounds hard and kinda impossible, but i still have hopes :,) 
---
Where are you located and which console are you using? I'm on Ps4 in the southeast US and the queue times are the fastest I've seen in a long time. Most of the time I wait less than a minute. I only play solo though.
---
Or the moron who just got unhooked could just not run at me.
---
Thats insane. Usually after 15 to 20 mins if i don‚Äôt catch a game i just try killer or just restart the search. 
---
Someone had to spark conversation at the campfire.
---
He can't go through a wall.
---
I thought it was doctor ;-; all 3 good at ending loops tho
---
Yes Legion, this one right here.
---
I mean, its an unpopular opinion to have, but i also care about the survivors experience.
---
Something I learned was the more blinks you do, the longer the stun after and that you can rotate as you blink; During chases you can cut them off and spin around to hit them.
---
Nothing you said made sense lmao
---
I don't know what this conversation is about but I'm here to give you props and an upvote for apologizing. It's quite rare to see that amidst people on the internet 
---
I assure you, that's not why people would use the puppet.
---
Pretty sure this broken excuse of a ranking is something that matters and needs to fixed considering it's literally impossible for survivors to get to rank 1 üòê
---
Thanks for the laugh 
---
That‚Äôs his name, he‚Äôs from the show 
---
I'm not encouraging you to do anything but I'm just saying r34 is a wide open world that you can explore its endless possibilities 
---
I tested pretty extensively, and no luck getting it to happen twice. Still, there's always the possibility of bugs.
---
I'm bringing holy water right now 
---
Maybe you just aren't as good without your crutches. I rank just fine.
---
To be fair, other than semi-shirtless like towards the end of Evil Dead 2 and the beginning of Army of Darkness, there really isn't anything they can give him.
---
I mean, we can't get Ye Olde Ash because Army of Darkness isn't cannon for the show, which is what this Ash was based off of.
---
I've been having problems finding games ever since they reverted matchmaking
---
It's definitely more colorful, but I think it's overdone in the portraits, and overall less stylish. I don't really like it that much.
---
Lol
---
All I can say is idc about legion at all. He‚Äôs annoying to play against, but it‚Äôs more annoying to have two teammates DC the second someone gets hit with frenzy :/
---
Hiding in the same spot for half an hour...yep sounds like a Claudette
---
Base is 60 seconds
---
*Judith Myers makes a beeline for you and the tier 3 music comes on*
---
I haven't had one survivor game tonight. 
---
Guess lots of people are wanting to try out Ash.
---
I believe you have to be injured for mettle of man to activate. 
---
This is what I mean when people say Claudette and Adam aren‚Äôt hard to see. In some spots they are literally impossible to see unless you know exactly where they are like in this picture
---
Seriously I don‚Äôt want to sound like a racist douchebag but make their clothes brighter. Other survivors are hard to see too but that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs when you get...well this, that it becomes a genuine problem. I‚Äôm all for stealthy survivors, but when you can literally be invisible it‚Äôs far to powerful IMO
---
Which is why I play wraith. I can hide with  Claudette in the bushes against the actual killer...
---
  
---
"how pathetic to play swf"
---
How dare people want to enjoy playing the game with their friends 
---
i wasn't aware of that! and if they mentioned it alll the way back into august last year, then i'm sure that they've done something ever since. you have no idea how hard i'm hoping the connections you just made actually match up for new cosmetics. 
---
WHAT SERVERS?
---
Seems the entity has had enough feeding today, killer was just keeping you preserved on the hook for when when senpai is peckish again
---
that‚Äôs not a typo. 
---
It‚Äôs not hard- it‚Äôs just expensive, since they failed to account for cosmetics in the original deals, because BHVR.
---
No I mean in general.
---
uh it doesnt. angrypug had it happen on his stream earlier
---
Damn you got me all excited...
---
Try to rank up, low rank killers usually face camp more 
---
I don't know why you'd think all of that, as nothing I've seen confirms it, and a couple of descriptions of characters outright debunk that.
---
At any rate, the problem being discussed right now is that Ash's lobby lines come in incredibly quiet compared to basic ambient noise, and it's super clear the audio mixing isn't working right on release.
---
You gave him a bps and this is how he responds.... What a dick 
---
Hag is free I thought.
---
First thing he said for me was:
---
#GROOVY
---
Swf queues have been beyond broken for well over a year for me.  The new matchmaking system was a godsend.  The days when we had the timer I could play swf and get games in a minute it was amazing!  But then they reverted it back to the 20 minute shitfest that is survivor queues on PS4. 
---
it doesnt get removed. Look at the perk, it still looks like it does when activated
---
BHVR HQ:
---
Should we try this time to get real money, maybe just make it all black or all red, it‚Äôll take 2 seconds I can just...? 
---
Nah... We‚Äôre doing a pretty pretty pretty good job.... so faaaaaaaar...
---
How do I get Kate‚Äôs midday slip dress (Not the free song bird one)
---
What thread is this in so I can go give my upvotes? 
---
All of these including fixing the broken maps 
---
Fml, I just got Claudette at 37 lmao. Now it's down to Rancor/Bloodhound and I'm leaning more towards Bloodhound.
---
The perk is lit, but the borrowed time icon disappears, and if you get hit by NOED, chainsawed, or take two hits normally you do not ignore the dying state. 
---
Can you post a link please with a time stamp
---
My noob nurse experience has actually been surprisingly positive. I‚Äôve had lots of support from survivors who have let me loop them as practise, even throwing in some jukes to teach me mindgames and the occasional teabag so I don‚Äôt lose sight of them
---
They‚Äôve been waiting by the exit gates too to wish me goodluck, clicking their flashlights and blinding me as a sign they‚Äôll miss seeing me
---
Oh and notification spam on pallets across the map. My morse code translation isn‚Äôt the best but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs ‚ÄúKeep it up-we believe in you‚Äù over and over again so I don‚Äôt forget
---
Okay but in all seriousness when I couldn‚Äôt even blink accurately with nurse most survivors gave encouragement and helped me get use to her, as well as being nice. Post game chat to my profile has been (For the exception of a couple) just tips and words of advise for me. 
---
Part of this is obviously them being happy at the free win, but I also feel the survivor community gets too much of a reputation for being toxic. The toxic ones are easier to notice than the ones who just want to have fun without sucking it from other people
---
It‚Äôs from an Ash quote 
---
chainsaw, noed, etc. ALWAYS ignore mettle of men.
---
And even if the Borrowed time Icon disappeares, the perk is still active, just try it.
---
Or watch Montos new video.
---
Exactly 
---
I decided to just buy LF when he was on sale a few weeks ago for $2.50, best decision ever :)
---
He‚Äôs really fun to play as and his perks are very useful, I would recommend just buying him because you‚Äôre not just getting BBQ, you‚Äôre getting his perks and a fun killer. 
---
If you play legion bloodhound might be useful 
---
Not an accident either, that's the quote 
---
Here's hoping to see ashy join the killer meeting in the next Samination dbd video. 
---
Hag is only free on console :/ 
---
I have proof, the icon is lit but it doesn‚Äôt work. Also, i have been chainsawed with mettle of man, tier 3‚Äôd, etc. and escaped before Adrenaline pops. After adrenaline it goes away. 
---
Well damn excuse my ignorance you fiends  üòí
---
chainsaws ignore the perk!
---
and believe what you want, we all know adrenaline doesnt deactive the perk...
---
Have you even tried it...?
---
I highly recommend you use effectiveness add ons as much as you can. They are undoubtedly the best add ons for plague and I suggest you at least use the yellow or green ones.
---
Get close to survivors, puke on them as much as you can until they're broken and down them. Don't go out of your way to pick up corrupt purge, as it costs you a lot of map pressure. If they're close and you have an idea where survivors are, pick them up. If they're across the map, it's not worth it.
---
Damage generators and puke on them. A nice mini surveillance as it will tell you who got infected and touched the gen
---
These are pretty much all the tips I can give you for plague. Anything beyond would be general killer tips 
---
yes....
---
‚ÄúMake your choice‚Äù
---
Do survivors even have 4 S-tier perks ar this point lol?  Decisive crutch was nerfed into uselessness.  With the nerf to healing speed a while back Self Care became just an okay perk.  It wastes so much time I took it off every character.  Borrowed time was nerfed off most players loadouts when they changed it to only affect the unhooked survivor.  I'll give you Adrenaline as S-tier for sure but aside from that what else do we really have to bitch about?  Exhaustion perks?  The nerf to exhaustion regenerating makes it so those don't sting as much either?  To be clear I'm not saying I agree with OP most the perks he named are easy to counterplay like BBQ and Nurses.  NOED is the only cheap perk I agree with him on.  I'm just questioning how much we really have to complain about on terms of survivor perks being that rough to deal with at this point.
---
This just in, existing is BMing
---
The perk only works if you are in the injured state... like it says in the description. If adrenaline pops and you get hit with NoEd it won‚Äôt do anything.. because it‚Äôs not supposed to.
---
#GIVE US OLD MAN MYERS 
---
I would stab someone repeatedly for some Myers cosmetics.
---
Not really buy yeah, they are frustrating to go against 
---
I was thinking more in the lines of like christmas sweater kinda stuff where everyone got one. If they do something like that again where it's a themed cosmetic for all survivors, i doubt he'll get one unless it was negotiated in the contract.
---
Damnit beat me to it lol
---
Expect for the fact that survivors can just 99 heal and finish it when the killer is close 
---
This makes sense, i understand. So in order to counter chainsaws, Noed, tier 3, etc. you would need to stay injured. So adrenaline counters this perk in cases of such cases. Thanks you
---
You didn't need it proven Einstein.
---
GIVE ME MYERS COSMETICS OR DEATH.
---
I noticed it too it‚Äôs awsome
---
Wonder if they could do that chainsaw but with a broken blade 
---
who the fuck cares about cosmetics when the fucking game is broken fix that then add them
---
It's in the most important place, in-game. He does have his own unique perks, you can very conveniently see them listed on his character page ingame 
---
i'm ready to go tier III on anyone who gets in the way of myers &amp; laurie cosmetics. bhvr, don't test me.
---
Yup, and not a problem.
---
Expect no one is gonna heal immediately they are gonna 99 heal and then when the killer is on them they‚Äôll finish the heal to avoid it 
---
Wait, would you really pay shards over BP? To me it seems like shards are so hard to get it would be worth it just to unlock it through the blood web.
---
People Downvoted because even the simplest search of 'Ash' would have given him his answer, nevermind the 30 topics about Ash on the main page anyway.
---
It's like walking into a room full of people having a party that says "CONGRATS ON SURVIVING CANCER ANGELA!" on a huge banner and standing in front of everyone and saying "Can anyone tell me what all of this is about?".
---
Most of the people there are gonna facepalm and say "Is this guy for real?" Aka real life equivalant of downvoting.
---
Taunting is definitely considered BMing, and your intention were to taunt when you pointed at him. 
---
yes :D
---
It's part of the Killer's interpretation, but it particularly depends on when you do it. If you're deliberately doing it on the other side of a pallet or at the exit when you're by yourself, then that's considered rude, particularly if you haven't been seen all game and do the latter. That's uncalled for and is considered mocking. It's up there with Teabags and Flashlight clicking. 
---
However, if you're near other survivors and pointing as though to warn them "Hey, the Killer's in that direction and coming this way," then I personally don't think it should be considered rude. I do it a lot if I'm running Alert particularly if I'm safe heal bait. 
---
Agreed. Like I get it, everyone has different opinions but she's outright toxic and impossible to watch.
---
My intention was not to taunt the killer.
---
I pointed like once or twice while he was standing on a hill, doing nothing. 
---
One can dream.
---
imo on the ps4 pro it looks and runs great...when I can find a game...
---
Poor thing's oddly round tongue.
---
screw the cosmetics they need to fix the damn game
---
With Ash out i wanna main him. the Evil dead movies were my childhood
---
Im still getting at least 1-2 dc every game. Like....I kinda understand if you dc when you see its a killer you dont like....but they have all been on their 3rd down. Why the fuck would you dc right before you die, it makes no sense.
---
What was your intention then?  Why was he standing on the hill?  Were the doors open?
---
I didn't even know he was on sale :(
---
Its 5 bucks and 2.50 when its on sale.....
---
It took a second for me to realize what you meant and oh my god
---
When losing is too painful, just redefine success. Brilliant!
---
He also says "Kiss my grits" seems like the most rare one of the things he says. 
---
:(
---
sir are you okay.
---
Yep
---
That's not recent though. Of Flesh and Mud (which was the first non-free and non-licensed DLC and third DLC overall) had a tuxedo outfit for Ace which you can't get with auric cells, Spark of Madness had Feng's Cardigan and Doc's black coat and they were both released before the cosmetic store was a thing.
---
lmao these have been in the files for ages.
---
Man I love that perk so much!
---
How so?
---
Cutest shit I‚Äôve seen all day 
---
Every time I play I start trials together with at least one if not more survivors with no one burning one of the offerings for it. This has been happening forever and I don't mind, but I have no idea why. Anyone know?
---
I don't watch streams, but I love all of Scott's videos on YouTube ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
He looks so cool.
---
Isn't it in the cosmetic store?
---
I don't agree actually. Yes, you'll have more survivors teabagging but I wouldn't say you're more likely to see one teabagging than a killer. Playing killer I see teabagging every game. Same with survivor. Some killers don't shake their head because they're too busy too, but every time I see someone hooked at the end game or I'm hooked at the end game, the killer face camps them and stabs them over and over. Sometimes nodding there head too. It's just as common for both sides.
---
  Also, that may be in PC but consoles don't have the chat so it's a different dynamic. Nobody is there the whole round, you have to message the killer yourself if you want to make fun of them or vice versa. Also, you don't have to spam the button, just ignore the chat. That's what I do if I get killed last and the killer says it was ez (usually I was the ONLY kill they got). The killer always has the power, thiugh. They can type ez then quickly leave, most times leaving survivors defeated as they got the "last word". 
---
   And you don't have to explain the group thing, I get it, but that's not exactly the same as every survivor playing toxic and seeking out to make the killer angry on their own. 
---
Hopefully we get a H2018 Laurie cosmetic so I can comfortably ship her and Ash
---
It's written, it'd be a Pulitzer
---
Still looks kinda cool.
---
My survivor wait time was long today, but I assume it's because everyone's playing Ash. I hadn't had problems before. Ps4
---
Yup! (^_^‚ô™)
---
No Mither Resilience Dead Hard This Is Not Happening. If you‚Äôre feeling spicy, try WGLF but TINH makes you be able to power through gens like crazy. Even a brown toolbox can feel like it‚Äôs yellow. 
---
Would be cool to be able to identify your obsession before you hit them
---
basically, when you take 3 hits, you get the "endurance" effect. if you heal, you are seen by the killer if they are 16 meters or more away (at tier 3). If you get hit by NOED when healthy, you should just absorb the hit.
---
Thank you! That's so nice. &lt;3
---
I'm a bit late, but Steam had an hour long outage followed by their usual weekly outage 6-7 hours later.
---
They can't talk in a trial, they can blab all they want at the campfire. Ash doesn't speak while in an actual match
---
while im not a big neon fan and prefer happy clown's perk icons, these are actually pretty great.
---
Once again, that's beside the point. 5 seconds is far too long for any stun, no matter where it comes from.
---
You have to buy the Curtain Call DLC. You can‚Äôt get it via auric cells or iridescent shards. Only buying the DLC will give you the exclusive.
---
Lmfao the hero we need
---
META of man best perk 
---
&gt; Let survivors prevent noed without having to check every totem on the map personally
---
So NOED is now eternally a dead perk? Cause it'll never proc again if all survivors know how many totems are still left on the map at all times.
---
It worked out for me...maybe ur conection is just trash
---
Is bloodhound worth it? Or should I go for rancor?
---
I usually play Myers, LF, Billy and doctor.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Its just people being oversensitive lmao. I dont take survivors pointing at me as ~toxic bm~ whatsoever
---
Now you're just letting your opinion of her cloud your judgement.  I don't like the girl myself, but that doesn't mean she isn't good at the game.  She basically runs tiles perfectly.
---
This killer was an oversensitive little bitch who shouldn't be playing a PvP /thread
---
It depends on your intention. For example, if you see Mikey stalking you and another survivor working on a generator and you point at him to alert your fellow survivor, then it isn't. But if you point at a killer after stunning them, then you're probably just BMing(again, intention dependant) 
---
"Let me slug everyone or I'm gonna camp!"
---
For future people -&gt; p1 = hand, p2 = torso, p3 = pants
---
if youre 200 iq and play a different game for the whole match then down and murder as many survivors as you can when they all inevitably gather around you bc "omg afk killer"
---
Should I pick up self care from the shrine?
---
I have seen many its, chief. This isn't one of them.
---
BTW what exactly is face camping?
---
Curves in the sense that he's not a flat board in the back. He has a round butt that provides actual shape to his form.
---
I like her, (most of) the community, the people she plays with and just generally have a good time watching/chatting there.
---
I do have to agree that I did have alot of success with MOM with m1 killers.
---
I mean you could probably try making David cosplay as him, they're both brits too
---
It's been this way since Curtain Call dropped with the Store last June. 
---
All four (and a half) chapters since have worked this way.
---
My dissappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
I always assume if the killer sucks they have NOED 9/10 I‚Äôm correct 
---
Not entirely true. You can double pip without a 4K. You just need a merciless victory with a double pip.
---
I don‚Äôt even fully understand what the challenge stuff is for 
---
Oh that would be amazing
---
when I let them do all the gens cuz i am bad
---
*angry wraith noises*
---
Probably the most sure fire way to predict it.
---
I dont see why you waste 30-60 minutes of your life doing that but more power to you
---
So you usally only camp no mithers?
---
There's also the trophies. I did it for those, decided on Jake Because I figured I might as well do it for someone whose stealth improved from it.
---
that
---
yep
---
The timer was broken beyond belief for me and my friends. It always said &lt;1 minute, and it was always a good few minutes.
---
It's worse now, But not by much
---
So you cheated and should be banned, but it's okay, because you claim that the survivor was annoying?
---
*Frank's Mixtape intensifies*
---
Yeah, it fucking sucks. The last matchmaking lasted like 1-2 minutes TOPS to find a match.
---
Girl + Toxic Survivor gameplay sums it up really. Toxic players who like women watch her.
---
I only play survivor when my friends want to SWF otherwise I play killer. I get so tired of sitting in a queue for fifteen minutes just for the person to dodge the lobby. The timer matchmaking was the most fun we've gotten to have in a long time. 
---
Well yes but actually no
---
This game hasn't been scary for a long time. But I'd love for you to tell me how stab wounds aren't frightening. 
---
Corrupt purge is super situational. Most of the times, the fountains are super far from where you are to the point where you have to go out of your way and give up a lot of map pressure to get it. A lot of the times you also pick it up, only to not get any use of it because you can't find any survivors while you have it on. 
---
Omega Blink nurse yes. Prayer beads spirit? Eh...
---
someone drop a charred wedding photograph, because we need to send this nutcase to the asylum
---
Can I make some for funsies? 
---
The purpose of NOED is to get survivors to do something other than gens. How is the purpose defeated with a counter that helps push them to do it?
---
A good team of survivors can beat just about anything besides mixtape or iridescent hatchet + good aim.
---
the entity tasked him with it?
---
In the video, Head On looks like a buggy mess. The hitbox is completely absurd and seemingly inconsistent, and figuring out how to spin gold from shit does not mean the Perk is working. If a player figures out how to work around a flawed system, that doesn't make it *not* flawed. I'm not sure what you're trying to prove. 
---
What lines does he have?
---
Yeah gotta be honest there's not a whole lot of reasons to point at the killer unless you're farming. Mostly BM. 
---
It gets better when you realize Freddy reacted to it

Jen is pretty much known for DCing and deranking continuously and is given the whole Fog Whisperer endorsement by BHVR regardless of this.  In addition, a community manager or whatever from BHVR actually warned her before she was getting close to triggering the automated ban from the anti-DC system in place.  
---
I don't understand it since Jen isn't even among the most popular of streamers on this game.  Noob3 eclipses her on Twitch, Monto eclipses her on YouTube.  It's weird.  
---
To me, it seems like a really situational perk. It only works if they don't die on the first hook (which lately has been happening way too often) and I mean, another hit against your average survivor won't really add much. That person is still going down if the killer wants them down.
---
Remember killers: 80% of the survivor population are basically toys for you to play with.
---
Don't make them suffer just because the other 20% fucks you over once in awhile
---
The DLC is $7.50 AUD on Steam. The character in-game is $5.90.

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm dealing with a incompetent person, when you don‚Äôt get to do anything but play a hook simulator game over and over and over all Night and are not able to do anything else, yes it is not fun. Then add in the fact of having to wait forever to find another game just so You can repeat the same thing, over and over and over again. 
---
I‚Äôm here to do gens, save team mates, run the killer around, get hooked and saved to get more time of running around and doing shit and then die or escape, make BP &amp; pip if I‚Äôm lucky with the new system. But to come into a game and do none of that but sit on a hook while some freak stairs at you till death or you get rescued just to get knocked right back down even with borrowed time, and rehooked and the face camping continues and while that is going on your teammates are either A sitting around with their dicks in their hand hiding or waiting for the moment to Sandbag you or B working on gens and know it‚Äôs another sweaty killer with no skill watching me on a hook. Yah it‚Äôs no fun. No strategy and you wonder why your only getting 1-2k
---
A game maybe 3-4k if you have idiot teammates.
---
If it was once in awhile I wouldn‚Äôt care but it‚Äôs gotten to the point now to where almost every game the killer camps on a daily basis. I had one guy tell me he camped because he was getting tired of being gen rushed! Really? Then run ruin and start really patrolling gens and kicking them and stop getting looped by that asshole with the flashlight, break off the pursuit and go back to gens you will find someone else to knock down! 
---
How does a rank 5 killer not know when they're being outplayed?
---
If I chase someone that loops me perfectly, I leave and fucking destroy the other survivor that can't. Every second they loop you is a second more on generator progression. If you're in a hopeless chase, just fucking leave.
---
To be fair, regular ass teenager with a knife still has a fucking knife  
---
He could be a carebear for all the fucks I give, stabbing hurts 
---
Alright from reading all the comments i guess it is tunneling. 
---
So recently ive become a Legion main. My strategy is often to frenzy as many people as possible in the area. After that if i don't find an easy chase i'll immediately go for the gens. While yes i do tunnel sometimes i usually end my chases early if its a good survivor. I almost always prioritize discordance to counter gen rushing. 
---
Now if i hook someone i will go out to search close enough generators or ones that are often being worked on. Again i always prioritize discordance so ill go after them if it pops up. And if someone unhooks i usually rush back and see if i can find them. Since i also run stridor i usually find them quickly and if i see another one trying to distract me i'll frenzy both and then chase the already hooked one. 
---
The only time i do "camp" is if the gates are open and i need to hold a hostage so that they dont escape.
---
This isn't a bad idea.
---
I think it helped balance things out some in my opinion 
---
When I went for the adept Ash achievement earlier tonight it even stunned me to be honest, I thought I would go down then remembered to take off lol
---
The only time I can see camping is when you finally get the asshole who just ran you for 3 gens, pallet slamming you, flashlighting you and teabaging every 2 seconds thinking they hot shit! Yes camp them they deserve it, hell I will even come and camp him with you pointing and laughing! 
---
I didn't care for her Buffy at all. Sarah Michelle Gellar will always be the definitive Buffy in my eyes.
---
EXACTLY!
---
Imagine all of Legion, in unison, surrounding a Dwight and saying  
---
"Seduce me"  
---
Too bad for you, the Legion aren't vampires.
---
There's a community-approved list here of situations you can disconnect from, as far as I can tell it looks something like: 3-gen Doctor build, NOED Nurse, IR Head Huntress, Freddy + Black Box, Myers + Tuft, Instasaw Hillbilly, killers using an Ebony Mori, and any Legion build whatsoever. From what I understand, if any player in these matches is not having fun, they're entitled to sandbag their teammate's and opponent. 
---
I'm not sure why BHVR can do until they switch over to dedicated servers and its easier to tell who is quitting on matches in progress and who is having connectivity issues. 
---
Clementine needs her happy ending, but Lee or Kenny could work.
---
You could probably convince peppa pig. I mean she was in the same po as the survivors are if you watched the saw movies 
---
*laughs in ignoring game mechanics*
---
Unfortunately I have yet to hit any of that criteria tonight. I'll keep a vigilant eye out for any blatant offenders ;)
---
I'm not down for the little girl we spent 5 years with getting face camped by killers, so I don't think I would want Clementine. Maybe Lee or Kenny.
---
NO GOD NO. Blocking the basement stairs is a genuine strategy to deny borrowed time. First idea was fine, just increase the timer by a little bit.
---
If your group gets gens done very quickly, the killer almost always has NOED
---
This made me laugh lmfao
---
Nah, it eliminates any sense of progression
---
That sounds overly helpless tbh, I know the idea that survivors are handicapped without voice-comm is picking up steam here but balance is in a pretty good place right now. You're gonna be alright dude. 
---
As long as hatch stand off is a thing, it isn't balanced. Not that hard to see.
---
It‚Äôs the next 50 matches you play
---
Mettle of man is really good. I didn't try it as survivor but it fucked me over a lot as killer, even lost me a possible 4k 
---
Pretty sure it wasn't.
---
Aside from the hair, I don't see it. Personally I think they did an amazing job making him look as much as Bruce Campbell. Way better than they did for the other licensed characters.
---
The focus has always been to add more stuff for people to buy. 
---
That sucks, especially since you don‚Äôt decide what emblems you get at all
---
Tunneled. How did you figure out he tunneled from a screenshot? You must have magical powers or some shit, because more likely than not, the Survivors just got their asses reamed by a slightly competent spirit with MLG addons. 
---
And what's this tripe about an achievement? *What* achievement? Adept Spirit? Um, they're using more than Spirit's perks. Look, I'm a bit confused. Are you referring to the Spirit killing people- or is it like "Blood on my face" but it's a reference to the Blood in your Mouth achievement? What are we complaining about this time?
---
Point is, I don't know what next level dope you're on, but I want some. 
---
Clem is just cel shaded.
---
Just take it off and bam: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/TheWalkingDeadGame/comments/9y3mh4/clem_without_celshading_or_dirt_on_her_face_sort/
---
no yeah the ash would run into other survivors who were doing gens just to save his ass, he sandbagged his last teammate and left her to die. so yeah as you can see my forms of justice aren't really well received but. ill stand by it 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What do you play on? I‚Äôm on PS4 and yes it has gotten real bad lately, I started playing this game back in July of last year, a few friends got me into it, the camping wasn‚Äôt that bad, it was here and there, just like
---
Tunneling. That was before that announcement
---
From the devs at BHVR when they fucked up and built a glitch into their own game with the prestige glitch and listed out what was a ban-able offense and what was not and that they were doing console bans as well. They specifically listed camping &amp; tunneling as non reportable or ban-able offenses. So once that boat set sail the people on PS4 went full on and have resorted to this all the time and it‚Äôs just been getting worse with the camping. So with the new ranking system they made it where if you sit within a hooked survivor upto 16-20meters proximity of them you won‚Äôt pip or even safety pip, like when before you could pip or double pip with the old ranking system and could just basement camp with bubba. Those days are over. I‚Äôm not sure how the camping is on PC or Xbox but PS4 yah it‚Äôs been super bad.  
---
Same
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll turn up the audio on his lines, sometimes all I can hear is mumbling.
---
Assuming you're on wireless AC you likely won't have that much of an issue.  Perhaps a slightly higher ping but nothing awful. 
---
Looked for him briefly but couldn‚Äôt find him and it‚Äôs been one of many killer afk derank games so I just wanted to get out. Pretty telling of how bad the ranking system and tanks are that I could -1 pip from that and killers just afk constantly to derank
---
I play solo, and in my experience it‚Äôs pretty rare for all the totems to get cleansed. People seriously just don‚Äôt care or take any interest in doing dulls because it doesn‚Äôt actually feel like an objective. It‚Äôs not worth it because most of the time, unless you are committed to finding all of them you are more than likely wasting your time. I just think it helps killers overall if survivors have more of an interest in doing them consistently.
---
While I‚Äôd prefer it added to the base game and don‚Äôt see the downside you do,  added to small game would be a compromise I‚Äôd be ok with. 
---
Well you have proxy camp where they are doing a soft patrol walking nearby within 16 meters but always have a eye on you, or you have the straight face campers who just sits there and stairs at you maybe turning every now and then you have the up close and personal face campers who is licking your face until your dead. 
---
Usually I have about a 5 to 10% survival rate but today has been about 25 to 30%. So the killers still have the advantage but has shrunk some which I think is healthy for the game!
---
I'm on a router :( hopefully there's not much difference..
---
He said that he just started animating, so it might be early enough to sneak in a little clip. :D
---
Will you post renders of the others survivors P3?
---
Really? Why not? You can still hear them, run into them and probably have a good advantage if they walk away from the tile youre at
---
I just got it like an hour ago. Watch it be in next weeks shrine!
---
Try to focus on extending chases as best you can and focus on generators instead of healing 
---
What if the Killer has noed , or hes hillbilly or any kind of os , its safer to stay injured 
---
Safety pip
---
Claudette is free and her other perks are good as well. No reason to leave them behind. 
---
Try keeping your distance and stay out of line of sight. Feral Frenzy doesn't let them see scratch marks so if you keep hidden, it's practically worthless. If they do see you and you're in a chase, then you're best bet would be jukes. Vaulting over pallets and windows may seem broken but keep in mind they have limited vision, so if you vault back over after they do, you may be able to lose them. If you can, try vaulting over winows where there's a drop (like the houses in Haddonfield). It's much easier to sneak away from them that way. Lastly, stay away from other survivors as much as you can. Legion's main strength is being able to hit multiple survivors in a row, so everyone being split apart works well against them. 
---
Yeah there should be a meter that lowers when you're not actively healing or something. It wouldn't down you or anything, just slowly reverse progress. 
---
A sweater with chainsaws and boomsticks all over. Now that'd be *groovy.*
---
I play on PS4 Haven played in a whole plan to when I get a new PS4 controller
---
Having never watched one of her streams, I was just kinda assuming the fog whisperers were mostly chosen for lack of toxicity, damn that's awful. A behavior employee giving her notice about a pending automatic ban is a fairly big red flag though.
---
nope its only op if u tunnel the person its taken a huge hit and god forbid if the killer is running enduring
---
Yes to part one. You can stab your obsession for Remember Me stacks very fast. On their first down you can get 4 stacks right there. You can also quickly get STBFL tokens by rapid stabbing everyone else too. 
---
Second part: STBFL is only for time between successful attacks. Unrelenting is only for time between whiffs. No intersection. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember Ash hiding in a locker in Evil Dead
---
Not asking to be suckled asking more of less to be considerate and not go ham at being insulting.  You first insulted the game and then the killer by assuming he was a lower level? It‚Äôs not for followers either my dude. I e posted more than once and the first things is to insult the game then me. If you don‚Äôt like it can play something else. If you don‚Äôt like me posting can read something else. If your going to criticize maybe add some more insight then a quick whip comment with nothing to offer.
---
Now don't post Jane as Jenifer Lopez
---
They don't see the aura if you don't fully heal. 
---
1: Based on their points they got tunnelled then killed. Anyone even remotely competent would've easily gotten more points.
---
2: The title is "I successfully got Blood On My Face." The achievement name for mori'ing 4 survivors in a match.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
yeah but they are licenses for the character - not the actor that played the character. This is both. 
---
But you need to M1 3 times the survivor before. 
---
It may have to do with the games new ‚Äúcan‚Äôt spawn within visual of a lit totem‚Äù conflicting with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt spawn too close to killer‚Äù. I have had this happen pretty often myself. 
---
^
---
I'll gladly spend 2K shards on perks I already have just so I get 150K BP to spend on the new survivors, shortens the grind
---
Because there's no locker?  But he was the biggest screamer and wasn't exactly the 'gung-ho' hero you seem to have imagine in your mind.  Even in AoD, where he was most bombastic, he was still cowardly and the whole film tried to get away from the big confrontation.  Same thing with the TV series.
---
Basically he's not David King.  He occasionally rise up to the occasions but more often that not was cowardly and often actually screwed things up for those around him due to his arrogance/cowardice.
---
Those toys look better than the game model!
---
Devs fucked up.  It's not Ash. It's random old man cosplaying Ash. 
---
With Self-Care, your base self-healing speed is half that of the global base healing speed, so your 100% self-healing speed is 50% of the global 100% healing speed. Botany's 33% applies to that 50%, which means your self-healing speed is sped up by 16.5%, putting you at 66.5% of the global base healing speed.
---
For which the equation is: 16s / 0.665 = ~24s; 32s / 1.33 = ~24s
---
In my realities... :(
---
Well technically you were running in a loop....
---
.... but since LOOPING IS A PERFECTLY VALID OPTION FOR SURVIVORS it's a bit of a moot point.
---
Also, any Myers who doesn't take advantage of you running across open ground in full line of sight by stalking the living shit out of you probably doesn't know what they're doing.
---
Not a killer main then I‚Äôm not tryna watch fr fr
---
He's not designed to be an end-game killer, he's designed to be a stall killer. To slow and keep the game going as long as possible. The problem is, he's so weak right now, *he sucks at his own job*. 
---
I'm curious about how it works with borrowed time.
---
I wish people would stop being toxic for no reason\*
---
Feign is a synonym for faking.
---
A few of the dlc chapters are free on console
---
Same, got in a match without self care and all my teammates refused to heal me. This stuff truly pisses you off ngl.
---
I've never heard him say a damn thing :(
---
Feral Frenzy stabs do count for Remember Me and Save The Best For Last, since those do not specify hitting the survivor with a basic attack. STBFL is wasted on Legion, however.
---
The difference between STBFL and Unrelenting is that the former applies to successful hits, whereas the latter to unsuccessful ones. One is clearly more valuable than the other (successful hits).
---
That is what I STRIVE for. but with out the farm tho
---
Yeah the 2.4ghz connection is much slower and you may see more issues.  I had similar issues with my PS4 slim not liking my wireless so I found a wired solution that worked for me.
---
No but I love using it at the end of the match with Deliverance when hooked right next to the gate. 
---
i would fucking LOVE Buffy or willow!!
---
I hate how PS4 can't do 5G connections, I might have to go back to wired. 
---
Yup.
---
... It's ¬£3.99
---
Definitely. Personally I don‚Äôt care for Claudette‚Äôs teachables but a solid rule of thumb is to not buy free character teachables unless you‚Äôre buying the perk for the BP
---
Four survivors running this equates to two extra full downs of a healthy survivor.  Including full chase.  Killers are so pressed for time as is,  there‚Äôs no excuse not to finish the gens, cleanse them totems, and get the fuck out of the gates now. 
---
Queued with my gf the other day and only got like 5 min queues constantly.. I'm rank 8 and she's 18. Met killers around rank 13-15
---
They might have been pre sabotaged to 99% to annoy the killer. Then you can destroy them in like 0.5 secs.
---
I'm not op but when I first started playing online games I would do the same because not being a native English speaker, I was afraid of disappointing potential friends by telling them I wouldn't speak because I was too insecure. Might be this as well.
---
This is a reddit from the future when dedicated servers are released and people will still bitch 
---
I feel like this perk just became super meta. I know it has for me.
---
So does a baseball bat covered with barbed wire.
---
I see you too are a man of culture 
---
Hmm, I usually tread shards like gold, but I guess that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt buy auric cells and have unlocked two survivors with them cause I didn‚Äôt want to buy them 
---
This post needs more meme. 
---
ok?
---
Wraith, Myers. Trapper has traps to down them without m1 imo.
---
No
---
U know what's funny, idk why they get mad and say it's BMing. And even if it is or isn't, then the same applies to a killer if they smack u after hooking u or nod yes/no when downing or hooking a survivor. Like what's the difference lmao
---
Read the perk again. His aura is still being shown to the killer. The perk deactivates the next time he goes *down*.
---
Like I said in a normal game it's not an issue. It's when it's a coordinated group who can use a specific ser of perks to punish the killer for doing nothing wrong. Let's say you start downing people quickly, 
---
Ive had a few SWF groups who have put me in a spot where they will unhook before I can leave the hook since they've still got the DS timer. The natural instinct is to go after the unhooked but if you pick him up he just runs off with DS, if you slug him then he uses unbreakable to get back up. Even if you do decide to tunnel, his friend is going to have the same perks on. This is not even mentioning when deliverance is used right in front of you (call me crazy , but if you use your deliverance right in front if me before I can leave then I'm going to punish you, that's not tunneling, your just an idiot).
---
Is all of this pretty specific? Absolutely, hence why I said it's only a big deal with really coordinated groups. The dev's can't always account for groups when they try to make things better for solos. 
---
In solo games DS is fine and the buff makes it a little more handy for solo survivors. Would be really nice to actually get a counter-point as to why I'm wrong.
---
I played a game as killer and won really fast like 5 min game, they got really unlucky. I ended up barely safety piping since I was rank 5.  They need to fix this.
---
Life can be cruel sometimes 
---
Nope. Not even close. It's still useful. Not op tho
---
This wasn't a farm. This was all legit. I almost didn't get it. I had 1 surv hooked and the other was at the exit gate. Had that person not come back for the save, I wouldn't have gotten the perfect. I also got lucky when one of the survs at the end vaulted a window and it got blocked by entity right away. It sucks for them but nothing they could do about it
---
Uhh Ash is now available 
---
*don‚Äôt use his perks*
---
Double kill
---
I play on PS4, currently rank 8, although I was rank 10 earlier last week. I haven‚Äôt faced very many camping killers. Tunneling killers yes, but camping not quite as much. 
---
No Legion!? Sounds pretty lucky to me.
---
Its always been like that. The pip system is under the assumption that everyone is playing to pip. Which is why its flawed. But you cant expect the pipping system to account for a facecamper or an AFKer, of course you arent going to pip because you are just doing gens and leaving. A majority of pipping comes from being altrusitic and winning chases.
---
I dont know what you expect from them
---
I understand and to me the game is always in constant balancing and for me as a person who plays killer and survivor.  These things do not bug me because I can still progress by playing by the Rules. Like I was not sure to post this because I don‚Äôt want others think I‚Äôm a bully because mos the time I let them get me and most players playing with me. But the way it clipped I can see others being upset. I was going back before the d/c to let him get me. But also the comment came off as malice a little when you said plug myself. I‚Äôm on here and in the community all the time. Been playing since beta. Had to take a break but since BHVR has been super supportive of me I returned and the clip felt fun to share. But I get you and sorry if so came off rude. Just the comment the first guy made came off as typical in upset screw this game as in its growing pains and things are always changing like any game. Then to say the killers 20. It‚Äôs like I have friends who are good killer who stopped playing came back and where at 20 so saying oh he‚Äôs a 20 to denote it feels like people not picking and trying to put a fun clip down. But I see your side in the state of the game and other frustrations. Also, glad we can talk not about pudding people off I try to promote fun. Even though the viewer who clipped this gave it a weird title.
---
I disagree but meh, doesn't really matter.
---
Yeah, I was lucky I got that. No way I'm buying LF, I'm simply not good enough for chainsaws.
---
Yea, she‚Äôs a total bitch. 
---
Mettle of man now makes you permanently exhausted and adds a Deep Wound effect with a 5 second timer. Increased NOED movement speed buff to 10%.
---
*except if you are huntress, Myers or a chainsaw killer
---
It‚Äôd be very situational. Borrowed time would have to go off as you‚Äôre 2/3, you‚Äôd have to get M1ed, then MOM could proc but you‚Äôd still have the deep wound timer
---
By itself, it's fine.
---
But if all four Survivors are running it, and in combination with other second-chance perks (Dead Hard, DS, Deliverance) it's gonna be ridiculous.
---
Biggest issue is that the Survivor will usually go down shortly after getting their extra hit, meaning they *never* have to put up with the downside of the perk.
---
My suggestions to balance the perk (which has to happen ASAP, *before* the perk goes full-meta) are:
---
1. Make it an exhaustion perk. Getting the extra health state makes you exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds, and you can't get the extra health state if you are already exhausted. This will prevent wombo-combos with perks like Dead Hard and Sprint Burst.
---
2. After taking the extra hit, you are broken. For the rest of the trial. BUT, this replaces the whole "revealed aura" part. This means that you are essentially trading a later health state for an extra one right now.
---
Small Game sucks and this change wouldnt make anyone want to run it.

---
Oh dear. It's as though every time you talk, you're trying your hardest to sound dumb as a stump. 
---
1. If you get tunneled, you'd be hard-pressed to get *2k* points in game. Yet we're talking Rank 14s after reset, and with over double that amount with the lowest score. Use your noggin. Perhaps you've been zapped a little too much with Carters Spark. 
---
If I wanted to go for the low fruit, I would say that there's no such achievement in game. I *would* say that, but I would be wrong- as it turns out- it's a *secret* Achievement. How very twee. Implying that someone could somehow tunnel Survivors when they didn't bring a Mori, and the only way to kill all four survivors is with Devour Hope. Which eliminated the possibility of tunneling for reasons that I don't even need to explain. A killer gets like 9k points if they tunnel- yet Mister Trigger here has nearly tipple that amount. Someone needs to give you a hand because I think you may be slightly confused as to where you are. 
---
Good attempt, though. Go back and try again. 
---
Goddamn it Matieu
---
Bih u stole my screenshot
---
Umm... to start how about doing all gens and escaping without a scratch not be a -1 fucking pip? 
---
Curious why people still complain about an ultra rare perk on a killer when plague can down you from across the map with a ranged ability she barely has to aim and can contaminate you without being near you. 
---
Are we in the ‚Äúplague is bad‚Äù phase like we were for legion and in a month suddenly every meme will be about how she‚Äôs overpowered and devs remove pls?
---
But nurse herself has no counter
---
If dull totems gave 1000 BP and Hex gave 2000 then you‚Äôd see all immersed Claudettes start permanently totem hunting so they can finally get boldness points. 
---
Is it bugged? My buddy stopped using it bc it just didn‚Äôt seem to count by hits properly.
---
You can lag switch on console?
---
I faced a rank 2 Nurse with NOED, im rank 8, the rest of my team was rank 12-18 :D
---
I like the exhaustion bit, but I definitely disagree with the broken for the entire trial. That would definitely make no one want to use since it would be nerfing yourself permanently just so you can *probably* survive one chance.
---
Ranks are about to reset and you are only rank 15. The only people you‚Äôd be finding are new killers or people who havent gotten the chance to play and were put back at rank 15. If you guys were all around green-purple ranks you probably wouldnt have problems. 
---
It sucks but you gotta push through. Nurse takes a ton of time to learn. Just keep pushing.
---
Borrowed Time stops instant downs. Not sure if MoM does the same.
---
Hopefully you stay around a while this time. This game needs more people having fun with it and spreading positivity. It‚Äôs been a real cess pool lately, especially coming after a relatively happy and peaceful time in the game. 
---
&gt; muh le streamers say iz good
---
kind of sad that your account isn't a troll account and you're actually serious 
---
But its weaker than Dead Hard.
---
It doesnt take that long to get good at nurse. The problem is that you have to consistently play her after that because its all muscle memory. Which is why I stopped personally. But who cares what they do to you, just forget about it and keep practicing.
---
Not sure how long you've been playing, but I'd recommend you spend like an entire season (1 month?) just getting on the face of the killer so that'll force you learn to escape.
---
I started playing about 6 weeks ago and at first I was playing the "inmersed" survivor type mainly because I'd last all 10 seconds during a chase, then I realized that even if I'm doing gens, I could do so much for the team if I knew how to juke/loop/etc. 
---
So I've been doing that these last 2 weeks, and I've improved quite a lot. I'm still plain bad, and I've lost a lost more games than I used to before, but I've got so much better that I don't even care. I see it as an investment. The games are a LOT more fun too.
---
I'm on the original, and I'm a girl btw. :P
---
You have to be injured for MoM to stop an insta down.
---
I'm sorry, but no.
---
The new-now-old matchmaking just threw people together at random, meaning r17s were being put with r2s.
---
I'd rather wait for good matches, then quickly get shite ones.
---
Also, Ash just came out. There aren't enough Killers about.
---
Free trial for Civilization 5‚Ñ¢Ô∏è has been given to all survivors.
---
Of course it was a Sprit, the one Killer tht can break loops with 2 IQ and her power. 
---
A well spent ‚Ç¨3.99
---
cLaUd SqUaD!!!
---
I hope you sandbagged the Spirit/P3 Claud :)
---
But the implication is that they 99 until they're close to the killer then finish healing. Their comment makes no sense otherwise. And if you just never heal up then you're dealing with a downside
---
Trolling attempt could use some work man.
---
Though I do notice now that they had DH and not a mori, so the chances of a tunnel happy killer is pretty much non existent.
---
I am man enough to admit when I am wrong.
---
Are you man enough to admit when you're an asshole?
---
I agree with the definition of having to down survivors with M1, but your examples do not match that definition. Both Trapper and Wraith also have M2 abilities that indirectly help them down survivors (and Trapper even directly), insofar they are no different from Spirit or Hag.
---
M1 killer to me strictly means killers that have to down survivors with the basic attack. It can also jokingly/mockingly refer to players that refuse to use or underuse a killer's ability, particularly if that ability is regularly used to down survivors.
---
It doesn't work if the Killer hits you with an ability or while you have an exposed status effect or the Killer is in 'one hit mode'. It's too situational like the rest of his perks. It does eventually help with extending a chase, but sometimes getting that 3 hit to activate can be problematic and just leads to tunneling. It's good against Freddy since it removes the dream effect, but there is a high chance that this is a bug and not intended. Overall, I don't think it's that good of a perk.
---
The pip system is about doing everything well. You have to do gens, be altrusitic and get chased. Its super easy to pip in an actual game. I had to stop running Borrowed Time because essentially it made me pip/double pip every game since every unhook I made no matter how unsafe it was, it was never considered unsafe.
---
His title is definitely more clever and humorous then your own, so I prefer this one.
---
Dead Hard is less consistent
---
I‚Äôm glad he says groovy
---
Just play her long enough and youll get good. Here are a couple of pro tips:
---
-use the pocket watch and the plaid flannel for pretty much the best noob loadout.
---
-blinking once gives you less fatigue than twice.
---
-hitting a survivor increases fatigue time!!(do not swing like a mad man unless you know for sure you will hit)
---
-know your survivors, if you notice them not being good at looping, aka going in a straight line or just going around an object without looking behind, blink ahead of them to hit, if theyre more experienced and can do 360s or good at mindgames, once they turn the corner, blink at the corner, not further ahead, this will allow you to see if they waited there for you in order to mind game or if they went ahead, in both situations you can win easily.
---
-if you charged blink too much and a survivor is right next to you just point at the ground to blink at pretty much 1m distance.(careful in maps with elevation as you will go through the floor!)
---
-"monitor and abuse" allows you to get close enough to a generator in order for you to blink to reach the survivors without them having time to react and most likely initiating a chase.
---
-shadowborn is also a really good perk for a bigger FOV, easier for you to not lose track of them.
---
-if you want to make sure you get the maximum distance of blink, aim about 10¬∞ above the horizon.
---
Thats what i can think of right now but honestly, the biggest part is getting used to the blink distance/opportunity window. Good luck!
---
1. When buying/unlocking a teachable perk, how long does it take until it appears on a bloodweb or is it completely random? I finally unlocked bbq &amp; chili about 2 weeks ago and I've leveled up doctor till 35 and legion till 20 and I still don't have it :(
---
2. I read somewhere that you can kill a survivor if you started unhooking them and stopped before they were unhooked. I accidentally did that a couple of times and they didn't die. So, how does that work?
---
Did they loop the killer?
---
Was this a rule before? Also the PLAG speaks during he mori 
---
That's just kinda way too much, a good hud is a simplistic one but still gives you all the information you need and the one dbd has does that. Not that this hud looks bad cus it is more stylish just doesn't fit dbd?
---
Only if the user can't time it right. It's also reusable. Dead Hard is a bicycle and MoM is a tricycle.
---
Understandable, but after you've played the game for a long while and you have all the survivors and the cosmetics you want, there's not that much else to spend them on and they build up quick. 
---
Not so groovy
---
Did you troll them in game? 
---
Personally I‚Äôd rather have the opposite. If there simply arent any killers/survivors at your rank, it should look for the next rank bracket (either higher or lower). So if you‚Äôre queueing as a rank 10, it will start looking for people at yellow or purple ranks aswell.
---
I‚Äôd rather get to at least play the game than sit in a lobby waiting for the ‚Äúbest experience‚Äù.
---
It doesn‚Äôt always work but when it does it‚Äôs very strong 
---
got 4 saves and did 2 gens looped the killer for 3 got face camped D PIP feelbadman
---
Yay more blood points for my ~~Plag~~ Ash.
---
FTFY
---
Its also an RNG perk to make matters worse. There were times where I did an entire generator and a half without a skill check, so I didnt even know ruin was a thing. If most people knew to just work through ruin it wouldnt be that strong
---
Basically the problem is that Ruin is too strong against noobs since they barely hit greats and they dont know totem spots for all the maps, its a mild inconvenience against great players YET still necessary because it at least slows them down while also being an RNG perk. It could simply not be active since no skill checks are happening or a survivor could get seven 3 o clock skill checks in a row.
---
I wish Corrup Intervention was changed. Instead of blocking 3 generators at the start of the match, it gave you 3/4/5 tokens and would block a random generator being worked on or had progress on it for x seconds. It would actually be an alternative to ruin and would reward you for downing people quickly.
---
I always thought it was just shit internet and that lag switching was purely a PC problem
---
I agree
---
haha yEs
---
Animators are not programmers 
---
The problem is that only basic attacks count towards Mettle of Man. I went up against a pig who for some reason did ambush attacks in the middle of a chase, so Mettle of Man never activated.
---
Other than that, I'm loving it. 
---
Ironing pants is expensive
---
Yea but if you take the hit then heal to 99% and only heal when you get seen by the killer there‚Äôs no aura for him to read before he‚Äôs already in a chase.
---
I'm left. 
---
&gt;connection test and I still gave 27.6Mbps download and 3.9 Mbps upload 
---
The network tests page only purpose is to check if the PS4 can access the internet, it's super unreliable when it comes to  showing actual bandwith, it's  usually overloaded as hell, not an accurate representation. It's just checks your connection to a server Sony set up, it isn't even the download servers, just a dedicated network test. My connection is 250 Mb/s down, and that page somtimes shows 14 Mbit/s down, and after initiating a game download, the download server manages to max out the bandwith and download with 250 Mb/s. I only use it when the PS store gets stuck, network test fixes it, since it resets the active connections. 
---
TL;DR: the numbers there mean nothing.
---
Nothing will come of reporting lag switching without proof. And I don't mean proof that you were lagging, I mean proof that the killer was using a lag switch. I can't even imagine how you can prove that.
---
It's Ashy Slashy. 
---
That's good to know! Tyvm!
---
Listening to kitty talk about balance gives me cancer, she gets giga triggered over everything too
---
lol
---
Lolololol
---
Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy and Nurses
---
Sloppy is almost essential for Spirit. They are at their weakest when they arent healed so they are going to want to heal ASAP. You want to make the heal take as long as possible. 
---
Nurses is the one you could change. Probably something like Whispers or MYC would be a good swap. People swear by Surveilance but I dont think that perk is worth it still.
---
Yeah it should, it makes sense that it doesn't work with Legion don't get me wrong, but it doesn't make sense with Nurse because her blinks is the only way you actually get hit by her
---
Well, this would explain why I‚Äôve been having so many shitty Spirit games. I thought maybe I had just gotten rusty, because it seemed like every Survivor was able to ‚Äúguess‚Äù me every time.
---
The game costs more money on console because its a ‚Äúspecial edition‚Äù. It comes with doctor, hag, ace and feng though.
---
who cares about MoM when it's Ash we're talking about? i retire as killer main and dedicate myself to make puns in chat and cocky stuff in game. 
---
Definitely a personality. Sometimes you gotta put a bit more energy into a game than you usually would. I make youtube vid with a friend and it's honestly a bit more difficult than it sounds as sometimes you would have to act how you usually wouldn't just to be entertaining.
---
I will track u down and drop pallets on u
---
I'm pretty sure in this scenario BT will take a hit for you and then the next hit will be absorbed my MoM. BT is a limited time effect so it will eat that first. In my opinion its bullshit but they just nerfed D-strike so they had to put something else broken in. 
---
&gt; who for some reason did ambush attacks in the middle of a chase
---
because good pigs use it to counter loops
---
i honestly would rather fight Legion than half of what OP mentions
---
oh no please dont put me in your dbd cringe compilation
---
What killers is MoM not goo against?
---
nobody:

I find running 4 meta perks unfun to play with but I don't really mind going against them as you just get used to it.  
---
Only perk I hate is Franklin's demise. Ever since the flashlight nerf I refuse to run it on killer because its so frustrating as a survivor.
---
I didn't even know you got 100k more! Thank you for that! 
---
I put mettle on my Meg and now I can tap here to give a survivor protection from any color, please send help

She also speaks in the menu screen and when she swings her weapon around.

Does it cost less than $20 on PC? I got it all for free as one of PS4s monthly games back in August.

i still get them for myers, freddy and bubba, but i bought them with cells

I spent 98kr wich is like 9 dollars for adh and that arm... hes my new main

Baby Legs, here we go! Blrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlr! That's the sound I make when I'm trying to run fast!

BT and MoM are both Endurance status effects so I don't think they stack with one another.
---
Yes or [Yes But In Blue]
---
Just throw them all the money they made off of legion.  Geez I still hate myself for buying the Joe skin for $10.

I think that most killers are too broken to talk. Most are brainwashed with their only goal being to appease the entity. Even if they were to chose to talk, I think most killers would speak gibberish.

And I, you. Gotta love a guy who can hold his own in an argument fraught with subtle jabs at one another. Truth be told, you even had me- yes, *me,* Doctor Toxic, on the ropes. In the end, Devour Hope was what saved my ass. It seems, it always is. 
---
This makes him the best character 
---
Please mods add a Ashy Slashy flair I beg of you.
---
It's better to fake a vault over a pallet or to window juke. Just trying to vault again is a thing every other Survivor does so most Legions will just spin and 180 hit.
---
Run from one edge of the pallet to the other around them as they finish the vault. Most of the time they'll 180 swing and miss and get really confused.

You bastard, you made me downvote an image of lord CLOWN

---
Am I back in 2011?
---
Wait, reward?
---
The perk is cancer, I agree, but it doesn't need to be useless against nurse! The perk would already be bad against her, because it's not hard to hit people additional time with the second most broken power in the game and showing your aura to a nurse is a death sentence. 
---
It's also removed by pallet stuns.
---
I didn't assume shit you fucking illiterate abortion. If you can read what I said I clearly wrote "isn't always". That's just a fact by my experience alone and many other rape victims I'm sure. It is very dependent on how violent the rape was and the victims personality.
---
Really? That's not what I see with all those nodding-in-your-face killers after I loop them. 
---
Lol I meant I hope there is a reward because otherwise it's all pointless anyway
---
‚ÄúIlliterate abortion‚Äù must be my new favorite insult. But for real you can‚Äôt get yourself out of the situation that you put yourself in.
---
DS works when you unhook yourself though. You could use that instead.
---
If you bought the DLC pack, and only that, there are two robot hand cosmetics. The default is brown I think and the second is bluer. 
---
If you bought the DLC pack and only have one available robot hand, you might've been gimped.
---
As a survivor main, this perk is broken. I am not a fan of insta heals like this. Now you have DS, MoM, and BT. Imagine running into that in a match?
---
I have 2 robot hands yeah, the other one isn‚Äôt broke though it‚Äôs like brown/dull also it‚Äôs a common cosmetic, pretty shite if you ask me :(

Life imitates art, then. Oddly enough, I've been achievement farming and getting destroyed left and right. One of them is impossible to get without No Mither, so I've been forced to get it. So it seems both our Kryptonite came into play.

That David Achievement is easily doable, IF you get lucky and never see a killer

LMAO it looks like the puppet dispenses a finger.  I love it

Its probably because he is REALLY quiet.

If you don‚Äôt run ruin, you most definitely have noed

Blink attacks are basic attacks, plain and simple.

---
I don't know, though it arguably shouldn't. Maybe surprise hits from Wraith also should not count (they do), but then again, those are pretty liberally awarded these days, so I think they should count (as well as Spirit's post-Phase hits and Hag's post-teleportation hits, which to my knowledge also already do count).
---
There are movies right? Do I need to watch those first?
---
survivor wait time is like a hour right now
---
OP isn't the one who cheated though, it's the survivor who responded.
---
Survs can't really hear gens when the chase music is blaring. They are just trying to get to another loop. It's unfortunate but I highly doubt it was sandbagging, I do it and see it all the time.
---
Yeah that is the greater issue, sure its great for anti tunnel, then the get to the end of the game and suddenly the T bagging meg with Adrenaline gets the injured Dwight off the hook, you managed to down him again and Bam DS gives him the free escape. You cant target the Meg she was already on fullhealth, it just kinda turn it into Old BT if you are not a insta down killer.
---
yeah it‚Äôs most likely a bug, but the game doesn‚Äôt consider them basic attacks is what i meant.
---
I know I'm old but is this actually a dab?
---
It is situational and only works against some killers. It is decent but not as strong overall. Often strong when it works but it only works in some games against some killers.
---
What rank are you ? I didn't play since 2 weeks so I don't really know what happened this time

---
It's alright, I hope you have a nice week.
---
 it means not playing a character but getting its levels from other characters you play, so you technically boost the character with bloodpoints from the other characters you play, usually meaning killer 
---
Ahh i see you're a man of culture as well
---
I tell the truth but anyway happy cake day.
---
Bill needs a beard nerf. Even with his P3 Outfit his beard is always unrealistically white, like fake cardboard or something. It sticks out in shadows and dark maps.
---
Interesting. Pugs opinoin was the perk is not good. Requires a lot of things to happen correctly to use it. My problem with it personally is that it targets the weaker killers instead of the strongest ones /like Billy, Bunny MOM - no pun intended , Legion, any other insta downs / I guess it would work atleast against the Nurse when it is fixed which is good
---
y'all taking jen way too seriously
---
~~nobbqonshrinegottaflex~~
---
oh boy, it's chest build time
---
Thank you for understanding fair counterplay.  Enduring SHOULD affect DS, but the insta recovery was unfair.
---
I mean he has fought off evil before....
---
I agre for Flip Flop completely. It is just like the other anti slug perks.  You get to used once in 20 games if lucky or ...never. It is just pure luck. And even if you used it 50% still not guarantee you gonna escape which is really bad. It should be as you said up to 100% so if the killers slugs and gives you enough time to recover you should be able to escape as punishment
---
Yeah but it means it's not something the commenter made up. It's something also other people use.
---
Also what is a credible source for neologisms? Like what if you want to know what the word "yeet" means.

Mclean confirmed this was a bug in zubat's stream
---
Hail to the king baby
---
its okay the child was probably evil. And dead.
---
yes
---
But last one alive without even being hooked once? You sure there wasn't a hit you could have taken for another survivor at some point that would have saved them from death hook and put your team in a better position? A time where you hid in a corner instead of doing a gen or helping unhook someone or even getting the killer to chase you that would have made it so the entire team was alive?
---
Thank you very much!
---
It's retarded. This perk is so fucking stupid. I felt disgusted when I used it. Just heal yourself to 99%, tank the hit and heal back to full. Why can I do that? Who thought that was a good idea? At least make it so that the healing done after MoM activates is gone.
---
The only killers able to bypass this perk are killers using their M2 ability. So this perk is single handidly deciding the meta for killers now. All M1 killers are useless because of this.
---
Oh and if that wasn't enough, "let's NERF Freddie even more". Apperently survivors wake up when MoM activates. So once you get that third hit, you're awake. Beautiful, just beautiful.
---
It's anti tunnel because it punishes killers that tunnel an unhooked survivor. The devs can't implement anything that will prevent tunnelling or camping, but they can add mechanics and perks that punish these behaviours and reward more fun playstyles. 
---
what time? they do not require time if you already know how to play killer. if you don't, it's not their power that requires time, it's just killer side in general.
---
Seeing as we got Ash this week, not likely.
---
Man loving this new nurse mori. Real talk tho it looks so amazing. 
---
He does have counter play but no one knows how to do it.

I've heard the Nurse is bugged with other perks like Remember Me and STBFL. I can't confirm if what i've heard is true as I don't play the Nurse but I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Fuck no
---
First of all, it's Ash fucking Williams! Also, MoM is good, but it's very situational and it really depends on which killer you are up against to have it work.

Try playing bubba with insidious and you'll be in for a hell of a ride

They were probably trying to put out the trash fire that was this game's matchmaking and bugs

Lovely cosplay and lovely countryside where did you take a shot of this?

When's the next episode?
---
I was confused at first because I thought he didn't have any voice lines, even though I knew they were confirmed, then I just barely heard "groovy" Since then I noticed the other lines but can barely understand most of them. I too can't understand how they made it into the game when they are absurdly quiet.
---

Literally had an hour long game against a Huntress while me and a Jane sneaked around trying to do the last gen bc I didn‚Äôt want her to die. We formed a close bond but both died in the end bc Huntress facecamped all game :(

This is ridiculous that BHVR can screw up entity blocking without even touching it. What makes this worse is this has been around since 2.6 was released &amp; BHVR still hasn't done anything about it.

Survivor wet dream: Hit, MoM, dead hard, insta heal, hit, down, adrenaline, down, deliverance, hatch

The thing is, the pig never got into a chase with me when I literally abused this window, this window is a fuckin glitch and should be nerfed

It doesn't make sense then. It's shit in this way

Oh my God I saw the first part to this yesterday, fucking gold üòÇ

Cuz you orbit the survivors

I had to buy the dlc to finally have my pebble, thanks rng
---
So I just got the game on PC after being a longtime PS4 player. Spent a lot of time working for self care. I finally get it then it comes out in the shrine the next fucking day. I knew I should‚Äôve gone for Adrenaline and Spring Burst.
---
Ended up using 5k shards on Rancor, got 3k left and praying for Devour Hope next week.

Do you know how to join on mobile?

This

Not OP but I also have a strict rule of not adding strangers (particularly in DBD) now because of bad experiences of people being overly clingy or creepy. Some people already have friends they play with and that's enough. 
---
Thanks! We took the photos in some grassland near my hometown
---
Technically you don‚Äôt need to heal so then the aura wouldn‚Äôt be shown, but then staying injured is a trade off in itself like with No Mither. Nothing is going to be on the level of old DS
---
By " time " i meant the time legion requires  to down a survivor with the moonwalking thing ( without the tape of course ) . 
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt experienced that either. I‚Äôm a survivor main and I couldn‚Äôt care less if I‚Äôm against a legion, i just play the game and I usually have a damn good/fun time doing so UNLESS people disconnect. 
---
Also, that‚Äôs a shitty reason to disconnect and screw over the other players. I‚Äôm not going to fight you on it, I made it clear in my other replies that I think disconnecting is what is ruining the game and the killer being ‚Äúboring‚Äù is not a good reason in my eyes. 
---
As a Daddy David main, the title scared me shitless for a second. Good meme.
---
Jesus Christ, how hard it is to let go and break the chase if shit like this happens? Of course thist shouldn't be in the game in the first place but the way this muppet handled it is ridiculous.  I bet this cunt's tunneling game is strong that's why he/she couldn't let go of you, and of course there is the DC so that further proves that Killer is nothing but a tool.
---
&gt;Help survivors judge if there might be a secret hex totem remaining.
---
NO.
---
Devour Hope already almost never actually benefits a killer. It's the most fun perk in the game and works how NOED should (killer gets stronger with time for playing well), it should at least be slightly viable. If a hex totem is supposed to be secret, like devour hope is, let's keep it that way. I'd be ok with small game adding a totem counter, but it can't be made standard for survivors to know how many totems remain. Please remember that there are more hex perks than just NOED, Ruin and Haunted Grounds.
---
I would definitely watch Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness before the show.
---
The first Evil Dead is not that funny, and more of a straight horror. The sequel actually somewhat remakes the first movie in the first part, and found its signature combination of humor/horror/campiness, so the first truly isn't that necessary (but good nonetheless).
---
The remake from 2013 isn't very connected to the Ash storyline.
---
I've seen a large number of gen and totem placement changes. Spawns in locations I've never seen before.
---
No :)
---
Never heard of them before.

Glory as killer &lt;3 might be a bit OP though

---
At least just make it grey or with better textures/light maps, it‚Äôs so bright 
---
Let's just add a perk that makes every survivor start on a hook.
---
then give us something that stops noed from insta downing us.
---
moonwalking takes much less time than your typical m1 killer would spend against a good looper. no good looper stands a chance against a piece of shit cheesy chase strat. 
---
you can play with 3 randoms, but not only yourself with no others.

---
So, I have to ask, has anyone managed to come across this issue in-game? I did and I luckily still survived due to having to get my teammates do the work for me. Moving around the map was such a pain.
---
take noed out the game I dont use it, original question still stands
---
Best way to get a little viewers in the beginning is to play survivor. Preferably with viewers. Use your twitch link as a name even of you get hate and mori's for it - it works. Interact with chat and dont forget to have fun. Good luck. 
---
if you technically weren‚Äôt in a chase then it‚Äôs not supposed to block it off. the problem is that the game sometimes has a hard time realising it‚Äôs a chase, which isn‚Äôt a problem with any specific windows.
---
How would that be comparable? Op question still stands
---
How tho. Also props to BHVR for attentiin to detail.
---
they won‚Äôt though.
---
Really bold of you too asume i eat at retaurant i barely have for food, hell i barely survive every day is a new strugle so Don t asume you know everything dipshit
---
Chainsaws, Tier 3 Myers, Iridescent heads, Rancor, NOED, red head pinky finger, Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope 3 w/ 3 tokens, honing stone. Lemme know if I missed something
---
Probably cuz there are hardly any high rank survivors
---
no matter how much we want this. i doubt they'll put it in. it's too costly on their side (coding, specific animation tied to a cosmetics,etc) to cave in to the demand for something that's ultimately just immersion and not gameplay. Just like how Mori never actually result in true mutilated survivor bodies.
---
You could use Make Your Choice as long as you don't camp. Can be used on a first hit of a savior even
---
I actually like their decision to make the HUD simple and use just a few colors with simple pictures, so this is a nay for me.
---
You really shouldn't buy a perk that is available by default like self care.
---
I had to pay 4,99‚Ç¨ on Steam :o 
---
You realise that even if the Ash gets away, as soon as they heal up you can see them for free? And if they don‚Äôt heal you can instadown and find them easily due to noise and blood
---
For real. That was the first experience that truly scared me in this horror game.
---
Well thats your opinion, and even if you're the best killer in the world you will never get at least 3k every game, play 1000's of games at rank 1 and tell me you've got 3k at least every game
---
Would prefer no one in the game actually talking because it kinda kills the mood
---
Cheers!
---
Eat less
---
It is not a gitgud thing, is that you have to be matched with people who is in the same rank as you (at least as much as possible, ya know, this matchmaking xD) to make the game challenging.
---
If you only have fun killing people who is lower in rank than you, then you are having a really bad vision of how this game works.
---
IMO, ofc
---
Though I feel like in this circumstance, the phrase should have been in quotation marks.
---
u do realize MOM stops any instadowns including NOED, tier 3 myers and chainsaws when its active test in kyf if dont believe me I tried it
---
More than likely, Eligos would have been able to send out an illusion of himself, so you as the Survivor would have to try to figure out which one was the real one and run away from that one.
---
So, you're at a T-Wall, he sends out an illusion of himself and the Survivor either has to run away from the wall, run into the one on the left, or run into the one on the right, and hope they didn't just run into the killer.
---
Your right about the mori, but the things you brought up are not comparable to a perk thats active 100 percent in match
---
True, I don't even think she is that serious when she trash talk the killer. 
---
I feel like people only look at the "resist hits" part, and not the "become permanently visible to the killer until he downs you" part. I've been on the killer side of this perk-Ash gets an OoO effect, but only for you to see. So it's not really anti-tunnel, more like delay the tunnel.
---
It only blocks anything if you're injured.
---
If you go straight from healthy to down, it won't help.
---
MoM is pretty situational too, so what the problem exactly? Your aura gets shown to the killer if you manage to heal up after using it until you go down again, so it's not like MoM is without downsides. Also, doesn't work with M2 attacks. For real, I play killer too, but why don't survivors deserve a perk that's somewhat good? 
---
The Plague ;D
---
Its not for free, it's a extra hit for them or you forget?
---
I think, the best counter for the perk is making it activate as soon as possible in the match, so it becomes a wasted slot.
---
Once the perk is activated and fully used it does not activate anymore.
---
No way!
---
Lucky, I hardly ever  play against Legion.
---
Make Your Choice, haha
---
It's active after 3 M1 hits and currently doesn't work with Nurse's blink hits. So it being active 100% of the time is a lie.
---
I wish that was my case
---
Ty for all your downvotes sweaty survivors btw I like the salt, makes me want the perk more now, could call the perk salty tantrum tears
---
I always get Camping Leatherfaces, Wanna trade? Lol
---
Slugging is a game mechanic, hence why there are perks designed to promote and counter it. I'll play however I want.
---
I think you are right though because the best killers I have went up against have been nurse and spirit but way more better spirits than nurse. But then again it could just be the learning difficulty.
---
Absolutely right. Literally was typing that while waking up for work, üòÜ 
---
Two years ago if you had 1 mil bp for a new character you could get to level 42. Devs decided something something bloodpoint economy and settles for a grind that‚Äôs not quite as bad as when it first released but not great either.
---
He deserved it!!!
---
But I would've let live the other two survs you killed because of this one annoying them 
---
smooth af
---
that cute poke
---
Its because no one is playing. The last two or three updates consistently added more problems than theyve fixed, and the community is as toxic as ever. If the devs dont put in some effort towards quality control instead of constantly rushing out content this game will die.
---
I hate this. whenever I see a moment in one of noob3's videos where he sees a legion, then either becomes the face of toxic gameplay, or just cucking over his teammates by dcing, that's a hard dislike for me. When he doesnt DC immediately, he just tries to make their lives hell. Honestly, that's taking hate for a bad killer gone too far. He deserves those deaths when he doesnt dc
---
The perk needs 3 hits to activates,it will be Impossible to activate it at the start of the match. With 3 hits, you already hooked that survivor at least once, so this perk will take effect in mid or late game almost all time.
---
oh god oh fuck he cant hear us he has AIRPODS IN
---
Rancor 
---
B-but thats forbidden love!.png
---
What you want isn't necessarily what you're going to get. In that case, survivors can get a perk that gives them an insta-escape when all gens are done unless the killer destroys all 5 survivor totems or buff the Brand New Part again to insta-fix a gen, just like Huntress' iridescent head insta-downs. Or maybe survivors can get an offering to get an extra hook state, similar to how a mori can remove 2 hook states. 
---
Your wishes just make you sound very entitled. "They have that, so I want that too!" Buckle up buttercup amd try to play around it. There are plenty of counters and you know who runs it, since people running MoM now usually start off as the obsession.
---
So the perk doesn't work on legion?
---
Wait.... you can stun them with a locker?
---
To be honest No0b3 was never really rational, he just does whatever he wants and he's good at the game, and well, he's a funny guy. But it wouldn't be any surprise to anyone that No0b3 can be pretty toxic sometimes.
---
Uncultured swines.
---
I ADORE this &lt;3 without the context from the game, it's so wholesome üòÇ
---
sounds boring af no thanks.
---
Fyi there's currently a bug in this game that started about 3 weeks ago that just randomly DCs people, it happens in chases, whilst being picked up and probably when being shocked by doc. The way to tell is it won't make the DC ping. There is also that a lot more people are DCing because pips mean EVEN LESS after this new rank update as survivor and even if you do get to red ranks queues are even worse. As for the toxicity brining frankly overpowered Ebony's is gonna bring a lot of that but the community is toxic just not any more toxic now than since you've left except I know a lot of older and committed players have just give up not because of how broken the matchmaking (they've changed is sooooooooooo many times these last 3 weeks), the bugged loading screens and the bugged/real DCs. 
---
It's so misleading üòÇ do you or your friend have Instagram? I'm always looking for new people to follow :p
---
I understand. I don‚Äôt like getting past rank 10 as survivor because it feels like every killer is a sweaty Billy with bbq and tinkerer. I get why they use it but it gets old really fast.
---
With one of Jane's perks, yes.
---
It requires Head On, a perk taught from Jane Romero. It doesn't actually work very well as of yet, though. 
---
This man said say hi to r/deadbydaylight like he supposed to care lol
---
Why the hel is it still a skillcheck for no reason than to add an unnecessary layer of "skill" to a perk?
---
Imagine if a killer got stunnes and for enduring to work they had to hit a skillcheck. Or NOED wouldnt activate without a skillcheck?
---
Made more sense for the old one, now it makes zero sense.
---
no counter bud
---
My Insta name is "valkyriye" (just the same, lol). But we haven't uploaded any of this shoot yet cause the photographer is not done with effects. Will upload them soon, got a good amount of really nice pictures ~
---
when jane came out i got her to level 33 with 677k so seems like it hasn‚Äôt changed?
---
Idk if he's seen Evil Dead or not. Poor choice of words though.
---
I have quite a few things to say for all the perks.    
---
Buckle Up is easily the worst. It‚Äôs only good if the killer slugs but even then the other perk that Ash comes with would do so much better against sluggers.      
---
Flip-Flop is that perk. I would honestly use this perk if it wasn‚Äôt so situational, but sometimes you need that little extra bump when your wiggling and that‚Äôll save you depending on how far away a hook is or what your team is doing. Pair this up with Tenacity and you‚Äôll go into the corner of the map while you try and get up.    
---
Mettle of a Man is the best mainly because it isn‚Äôt situational. This perk gives Ash a extra life if you hit him with a normal attacks. However even if this perk sounds really good, it‚Äôs useless when facing characters like Legion and Plague but it is amazing when you face characters like Myers, Freddy and Wraith. The perks good if you can run people around, okay if you can‚Äôt (like myself).
---
The only reason they don‚Äôt have understandable voice lines for the other characters is because the game is in so many languages, they‚Äôd needs to pay the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù actors to either translate or hire people in every other language to voice them. Plague gets by because she has an indecipherable language. ‚ÄúAsaita Vinir! Vatai Comai!‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt mean anything in real languages so no one has to translate it. Ash passes cause unless I‚Äôm wrong his lines are the same on all regions. 
---
please let this happen
---
More like collared shirts are fly as fuck an licensed characters know how to dress to impress son
---
For all you non-americans: it's only on Netflix U.S.
---
I honestly like the perks except mettle of man. They bring some fun gameplay and offer some decent build variety. 
---
Mettle of Man is just a poor decision. Do survivors really need another second chance perk? The game is getting to the point where 5 gens is seriously just not enough. 
---
The only people who back the perk are swf and people who cant understand balance. It is what it is though.
---
You keep going items, certain killers, or hexed based totems, your trying to hold up other things that aint the same, and you saying im entitled because I want a super strong perk that survivors are running on the killer side.  You've not even brought up 1 valid counter.  Give your head a shake get some of them cobwebs out your brain.  Shall I bring up insta heals for an extra life, no because it's an item that gets used.  Bringing bnp into the argument what a saddo.  Ok lets buff the bnp back to original, and while were at it lets put moris back to original og use.  You get knocked down you can use mori, no hook required that sound fair? 
---
your traps will match your outfit
---
The thing about Legion is he
---
1.) Is super super easy to pip up with without needing any skill so you have an influx of super bad killers at higher ranks or the ranks where the average player plays (there already were quite a bit but it's just gotten even worse)
---
2.) He's very very effective at tunneling, all he needs to do is chase someone until their timer runs out via moonwalking or hit them 4 times (3 with Frank's) and he can do this right after hook with little to no punishment in terms of emblems or BPs
---
3.) He's just boring to play against because you're either stuck in a chase knowing that you're probably gonna go down, holding m1 on a gen or mending because if he happens to be playing legion the "right" way it's a bad killer who exerts no pressure
---
Take into account that NOED can activate in a chase by the end, making the killer faster so he gets a single hit in a loop he didnt play well, then he instadowns the survivor who played better, and camps him for a kill he didnt remotely deserve.
---
This perk has a totem, so the devs says it has plenty of counterplay and didnt nerf it. Just wait a minute before picking someone up, counterplay!
---
And yes, this was to make fun of the devs, I wouldnt want that DA buff either.
---
i know you eat your feelings you whale, i know your a goth and pierce everything you can because you like the pain. i know you spend all your time trying to make friends online because your life outside the internet is as vapid as your personality, i know your a snowflake with the sensibilities of a 12 year old because you think a mean comment is capable or ruining someones happiness, if that is the case you have more issues than the person making the mean comment. I know you lack confidence, by saying "we" it's your way of not feeling alone and having to stand up to someone. I know you were probably bullied, and this vendetta you have against me if your way of fighting those demons high school gave you. I picked up that psychology book you told me about
---
start dcing too, people will stop playing legion.
---
I put 750k into Ash this morning and only got him to lvl 29, so it's VERY random and VERY annoying
---
It appears in your web 100 percent keep grinding whats it cost 6k omg so expensive and it lasts forever gee weez sign me up.  Or just play ash and get it now, your arguments are terrible
---
It‚Äôs okay at best. It can be worked around by other killer powers and it only works once so it‚Äôs not like it will cause 12-14 time being wasted like old DS. I think people are vastly overestimating MoM‚Äôs power. 
---
It's to good to imagine
---
Yeah I saved up 1mil bp and 3 daily challenges and poured all of it into plague on day 1. I got a ton of light born and shadow born sloppy butchers (normally ok but not on plague), some blood warden and some other bad stuff.
---
? What
---
oop yea, you are right
---
damn I don't want a legion meta &gt;.&lt;
---
Toxicity, bugs, waiting and devs who wouldn't know balance if it hit them in the face. I uninstalled last night :) just sticking around now to enjoy the MoM shitstorm that seems to be brewing.
---
Best part of it is that Nurse and Billy are pretty much unaffected, while shittier killers get shit on hard by it.
---
Which one is the strongest power in the game?
---
Jane's perks aren't bad, but are quite situational. Poised does work well in chase, but it requires timing that you have no control over. 
---
As for Ash's perks, Buckle up isn't very useful, Flip Flop is situational, but could definitely work if you aren't too close to a hook and Mettle of Man is stromg but very, very situational. I haven't gotten any good use out of it besides baiting a hit near the exit. When it activated in chase halfway during the match, the killer seemed to be right up my ass again. The burst of speed you get from it seems shorter than a regular hit, but that could just be me.
---
But its ok for survivors to exploit broken loops and use perks with no counters right?
---
How childish are you, calling me entitled and baby girl because I'm swatting your arguments down, it's empowering me ty üòòüòò
---
I always thought survivors should have something unique about them. Like some perk that is available to them and only them or something
---
Of course not. Noed isnt the same but it is still a shitty crutch perk.
---
The devs clearly couldnt give a flying fuck about balance or skill.
---
Yep! I like this idea! 
---
I remember seeing Evil Dead as a kid and it took me FOREVER to find it later in my adult life because I never knew what it was. I always remembered the people in the cellar freaking me out though
---
Good! I'm not kinkshaming, you do you and don't change for anybody! Kiss kiss, ty and lylt ‚ù§
---
You probably had a very fast and uneventful game. In order to depip now you basically had everyone die on first hook or stayed too close to hooked people after the grace period. Even if your gatekeeper was gold/iri, more than likely you just dunked on some potatoes and didn‚Äôt toy with them. 
---
WHAT. she sounds 12 holy fuck
---
Wow... did not know
---
Why do you keep bringing in different perks, items or killers which have zero bearing on this post, you literally doing it multiple times.  Bringing ds into the post why not list every perk, killer and item or mechanic in game, just for the shits and giggles
---
Bubsy is on the way folks as new survivor!
---
Yep... There are sometimes where I prefer the porn riddled 4Chan.
---
Feral frenzy. Basically it ignores everything in the game and has even less counterplay than nurse. However because time is against legion and deep wound is as threatening as a teddy bear, legion is pretty bad without frank's mixtape. 
---
You might be joking
---
But you said, ‚ÄúUntil it becomes Meta of Man.‚Äù
---
Guess I'm playing Legion all day.
---
Follow your heart
---
This guy made a post where apparently you were ‚ÄúT R I G G E R E D.‚Äù  He said YOU were salty apparently.
---
christ on the cross. I hate her even more now. I'm 27 and would N E V E R. especially as a female. shes already giving girl gamers are terrible image.
---
Why would it be auras for all survivors wouldnt it be for the guy you insta downed and only stay active until they use perk on another survivor? and why would it deactive the rest of the match isnt mom unlimited? 
---
Right? 1 single person in the entire game, doesnt fit.
---
Dude. Stop it. People aren‚Äôt realizing that your name proves that this is a shitpost. Put /s on your comments to save your downvotes.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Bring.  Brutal.  Strength.
---
Nope, MoM is one-time use. You get hit a 4th time, you either go down and it deactivates or you heal up and have your aura revealed to the killer until you go down.
---
Killers don't already do that?
---
Billy? I mean in my experience they don‚Äôt get many hits with the saw. It‚Äôs a total utility weapon. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a bad thing. It still extends the chase by a lot.
---
as long as your Susie im ok :P 
---
The last sentence made me cringe 
---
....fuckin who?
---
Well no, even your concept is flawed. A hit to a survivor is a negative, so three negatives and they receive a positive which would be the ability to take another hit.
---
For a similar killer perk we would need to give the killer three negatives to allow for the inclusion of a positive and getting three hits wouldn't be that, that would be like giving a survivor a free hit every gen. So it would need to be something like three misses gets you an insta-down but again that can't be done cus you could just spam hit a wall then go look for a survivor. How about every 3 times a survivor wiggles out of your grasp you get a free insta-down? I think that would be an appropriate comparison
---
This is enabling witchunting.   At least they covered your names, but not covering a name you featured in bad light is against subreddit rules as it allows people to harass them.
---
I grew up on the evil dead movies and loved them (still do) so, when the series was announced at Comic-Con (I think) I was fucking livid! Sad that the show ended tho.
---
Braveheart new killer confirmed
---
Sorry if you got me wrong!!!!!
---
I did not mean you are a bad player. What I meant is that this ranking system is shitty and  the matchmaking system too, but deranking to have fun is not either a solution.
---
I agree they should implement a matchmaking system that works with a full mmr and not only with the rank because it is really worthless, since you can play against someone who has 1000hrs but stays in rank 15. 
---
BUT: If you were allowed to derank to, lets say...hmm... 17, you would be in a similar scenario because you would get matched against bad people making you rank again up to 15, or you would get matched against people who deranked aswell forcing you to play with people who sould be in higher ranks.
---
The issue with this is that killing survivors is the Killer‚Äôs objective, and hitting them directly advances this objective. On the other hand, the objective of the Survivors is to repair generators and escape. Mettle of Man does not directly advance that objective, it only hinders the Killer‚Äôs objective by allowing Survivors to stay alive longer. A Killer equivalent to Mettle of Man would be either Spirit Fury (as it allows the Killer to continue advancing their objective even when a Survivor tries to hinder them) or Pop Goes the Weasel (as it hinders the Survivors‚Äô objective more effectively than the Killer can by default). A Survivor equivalent to what you‚Äôre asking for would be to buff Brand New Part back to its former OPness, as that directly advanced the Survivors‚Äô objective.
---
Tbf, I was up against a P3 rank 1 Billy with low rank team mates. I ran him around for a bit but he insta-sawed everyone and we all died on our first hooks.
---
Pretty much what most people said. I didnt get to use it every game but when i activated it to save a teammate against a face camping myers with the exit gates open it was soooooo satisfying 
---
Bubsy the bobcat. Old video game character, similar to sonic, but with an irritating amount of quippish personality. Made a Terrible transition to 3D, and had a lackluster revival game recently.
---
Well that was just a bad game lol. Don‚Äôt judge a perk off of the skill of you or your teammates or OP addons.
---
You are surprised that players are mad when you keep using Ebony Moris?  Hmmmm, this is shocking news.  Not sure why you would finding that some people might get ticked if they wait 10 mins to find a game, only to only be able to play 1/3 of a normal game because they get Killed after 1 hook
---
üòÇ
---
you‚Äôre playing fine. Speaking as a survivor main, survivors get too salty over dying or simply being hooked, survivors cry about just about anything as being tunneled or camped regardless how the killer is playing. killers rarely get GGs in end game lobby for getting 4Ks or outplaying survivors in my experience. 
---
You are right of course, I haven't been able to play much unfortunately since matchmaking on PS4 takes forever 
---
I didn't get BBQ 1 on Plague until lvl 50 bloodweb 3 :c
---
So you‚Äôre doing it for attention?  I don‚Äôt have time for this, take all my karma, I can care less.  I don‚Äôt wanna be around your awful morals any longer.  You cheated and you deserve a ban.
---
Yep. Massive amount of survivors. No way Behavior can fix that. Wait for Ash to die down or just read a book or watch YouTube while in a queue.
---
Didn‚Äôt do it for attention??? Maybe you need to chill??? Taking this way to serious. 
---
He deserves it, he cheated
---
I think Mettle of Man is a more balanced version of Decisive Strike. You actually have to evade the Killer twice (once if you have an instaheal) and if you evade them afterwards they'll be able to track you. Compare it to Decisive Strike where you literally just hit a skill check after being downed.
---
MoM is only good for Survivors who like to loop the Killer, and you actually have to be good and evade the Killer instead of just running around in circles.
---
MoM is only good for a specific playstyle. DS was good for any playstyle. MoM has limits and requires real gameplay skill while DS rewards you for doing poorly.
---
One thing I do like is that MoM might actually make Object of Obession and even *Sole Survivor* viable. MoM tied to Sole Survivor does actually seem like a really powerful combo. I think MoM, OoO, and SS (and also Self Care because of course) might actually be a very good build to track the Killer while also keeping alive. Obvious issue with this is that you won't have an Exhaustion perk to keep you alive but...
---
Ugh!!
---
F
---
Either that or its one hell of a cover-up.
---
If they changed it so you could attempt escape, killers would no longer go off and do other things. Every game would end with the killer standing there until you hit struggle. It would just be boring
---
Everything that needs to be said, right here 
---
**Console** wait times is not the problem. Its ps4. Xbox wait times are completely fine
---
totally agree. man, some license holders can be difficult to deal with. fingers crossed for shirtless myers :,)
---
Yeaah, for example, Quentin's actor, Kyle Gallner, had no idea Quentin was a character until he heard about it a while later
---
This depression... it never ends 
---
Legion Frank makes me feel the same
---
I completely understand! People are weird. I hope you do get a chance to see it yourself.
---
lmao, poor guy. that's also kinda the difficult part about licensed characters, isn't it? i figured they made quentin and laurie so different from the people who played them to avoid paying the actors.

So if they were being consistent it also wouldn't apply to freddy's "dream chaser" event or wraiths "surprise attack". Is that the case or is the perk basically just there to double down on already weak killers?

It works

No it isn‚Äôt.
---
The second movie was supposed to start with a recap montage of footage from the first film. They couldn‚Äôt get the rights so they had to re-shoot the recap and they simplified it, they didn‚Äôt include elements that didn‚Äôt continue in the sequel. Because Scott, Shelly and Cheryl don‚Äôt come back in II they aren‚Äôt in the recap. Linda continues to torment Ash in the sequel so she‚Äôs in the recap.
---
After the first 7 minutes or so EDII are the only part that could be considered a remake. Aside from that they‚Äôre two very different movies depicting Ash‚Äôs two consecutive nights at the cabin.
---
AvED recognizes this. There‚Äôs a major callback to the first film in AvED that would make no sense if you skipped the first one.

Basically ignore this guy. DO NOT SKIP THE FIRST MOVIE.

It's Bruce Campbell, so he's best boi.

---
Mettle of Man, btw...
---
I was looking around after I made that comment and I didn't know getting hit by the chainsaw doesn't add a stack towards the 3 hits needed to activate the perk so I could see that now but I still think it would be good against nurse, combine that with dead hard and shes going to have to deal with a lot of self stuns.
---
I always scour this subreddit to see if someone complains about a survivor that turns out to be me. I don‚Äôt do anything toxic, at least not intentionally, but I‚Äôve done things that have pissed people off for some reason (not risking a save because the killer is a camping Billy), but yeah. 
---
if I am running the killer around for at least 2-3 minutes and not a single gen gets done, or there is someone that is still injured and didn't get healed up I am going to suicide on hook.
---
"Survivors/Killers disconnecting at certain times when they feel like they've been pushed too far either side giving them unpleasant go as it was not a fun experience" 
---
I understand the statement, but it doesn't give the right to do so.
---
DCing is the MOST toxic action someone can do while in game.
---
If the killer dcs, that's just GG and if it's at the start of the game, happy de-pip to 4 PEOPLE together.
---
If a survivor dcs, that's not only an asshole move for the other survivors but again, prevents possible points for everyone else...
---
They NEED to address the disconnects. I don't know how to do so but after having FIVE disconnects in a row I'm starting to actually say "literally unplayable".
---
Just put a goddamn timer like every other game has (and not only 5 seconds) so that after you dc you can't access ranked games for half an hour.
---
Well the current version of Save the best for last was a fan suggestion on how to rework the perks so I wouldnt put it past them to take a look at it but who knows if/when they would do that. But with this games growth It need something to reduce the grind a bit.
---
I know what you mean
---
Don‚Äôt get mad now when the killer runs NOED, survivor scum.
---
I like the idea but as a separate game mode.
---
Then why are you playing computer games? Sell the computer and buy food dipshit.
---
what?? it's not supposed to??
---
I pretty much wont play a killer unless I have BBQ on them. If I don't I'm just getting half the blood points for the same amount of time put in...
---
And definitely watch Army of Darkness! It‚Äôs the best one
---
Every time someone doesnt like a girl streamer, they call their audience whiteknights. Come up with something else
---
I saw the flashlight one and went "It needs to wrap."
---
Ash is most likely the only one who actually got a shot at escaping the entity's realm.
---
Yeah but it's kind of weird, I play survivor, get way less bloodpoints but don't care but God forbid I play killer with bbq even though get more bloodpoints than I would ever get as survivor per game it just feels wrong not to use bbq for 40-60k per game
---
Just wanna clear up some misconceptions from my crappy photo:
---
1) everyone was hooked and I got my full BBQ stacks (no one was tunneled and one player was not punished for someone else‚Äôs poor play and the girl who was hooked twice died last)
---
2) The offering is a black ward, not an ebony mori 
---
3) there is a secret achievement called Blood on Your Face for Mori-ing all four survivors in a trial 
---
Maybe a ranked mode? I feel like this idea has a lot more balance potential by adding a small secondary objective to the game and keeping items and mechanics in the game that people are already familiar with. Not saying that my rework idea hits the nail on the head but I believe its a step in the right direction.
---
Ye well it doesn't feel like they did. before the lock update, it would always find survs from Europe and now it's finding people from Asia.
---
It's pretty annoying, but it doesn't seem as broken as ds. Time will tell.
---
Well, if you look at the name he left uncovered, and the name of the person taking the screenshot both in-game and his Reddit name, you'd find they kind of match.
---
Yeah, I've heard that Sony has a history of that, but I thought they've been more open to the idea in the last year or two. It really is too bad cause having the community split limits developers in their options for online and causes headaches when it comes to programing and managing 3 matchmaking projects instead of focusing on one umbrella one
---
Strong survivor perks: adrenaline, dead hard, balanced landing, balanced landing, etc.
---
Strong does not have to equal broken, and MoM is broken, it punishes killers for doing what they are supposed to do which is hitting the survivor.
---
He srems. ^Groovy
---
I can‚Äôt turn left!
---
nobody dc‚Äôd to avoid your shroud of binding, one of them probably crashed in the loading screen and their friend didn‚Äôt wanna play a 3 man game without their friend. your offering isnt the cause lmao.
---
Can we get a nurse mori on the Meg please, that would be greatly appreciated
---
Thanks! 
---
Can't tell if Laurie or Kate.
---
^Hope it's Kate. Laurie is canonically 17.^
---
That‚Äôs Pablo bitch (I‚Äôm not actually mad please don‚Äôt downvote me)
---
For me the survivor had the choice he didn‚Äôt have to respond at all to the killer he could had just ignored the action. I see nothing wrong w/ this. Lesson here kids is don‚Äôt be an asshole survivor 
---
I auto DC every time I get Myers' map on a killer that isn't Trapper. I'm not sorry.
---
I don't think you can 4 man it cause it's an obsession perk. Only one person can have it.
---
I know it's about the same, but that sounds a lot better then the $7.50 Upside Down units we have down south.
---
Don't nerf it please xD
---
What is a 3k or a 4k?
---
Unpopular opinion, the show really took a lot of the charm of Ash out of the character and made him dumb compared to Evil Dead 2.
---
Ugh, I stated above that this could've been much easier if they added game modes in regards of doing something for this or something else. And I simply wouldn't care less at this point. It's becoming a hazardous habit but I am no game developer on this.
---
I really don't take this game seriously anymore. &gt;!I would care how bad the bugs and glitches affect your game play though.!&lt;
---
Frames definitely got better with the chapter update. It‚Äôs still not 60 FPS but it wasn‚Äôt the slideshow that it‚Äôs been since the unreal update. 
---
To me it seems like a situational Dead Hard. Doesn't work against 1/2 of the cast (Legion,Nurse,Hillbilly.Plague,Huntress,Leatherface,Myers if he downs you with EW3)  I think you're just overreacting. It nerfs low tier killers more than top tiers,but if you're a Wraith or a Freddy you should be running something like Make your Choice anyway to reduce chase time.
---
You said balanced landing twice xD
---
&gt;I don't think you can 4 man it cause it's an obsession perk. Only one person can have it.
---
Thats not how obsession works anymore. 
---
Seems like a good perk to run with WGLF.
---
I'm pretty sure tru3 got hit by red vomit and it triggered. 
---
I'm convinced the pip system is busted as shit. Played a game today. I did 3 gens, searched a chest, opened an exit. Two people got hooked during all this. I escaped, with +1 pip. Iridescent in all categories except evader I got gold. Never saved or healed, never got chased.
---
What changes did they make?

Well it's been recently confirm by McLean that the nurse thing is a bug so, hopefully it'll be fixed soon
---
actually he didn't call you a rapist, just that you and everyone who loops don't think rape is wrong
---
Your right, I guess on Xbox you‚Äôll counter legions who will go into that rage mode and smack you once and they will lose track of you right after that it‚Äôs strange happens all the time 
---
I get where your coming from, but I gotta disagree. As a survivor, it's way too hard to pip. I'm not saying the old system was perfect, but there's no reason for survivors to be punished for doing gens all game (When someone was running around a killer for most of it) and barely safety pipping, all because he wasn't in chase. Meanwhile, the guy who did do the looping, while I do think he should get more credit, will still be lucky to pip because he didn't do gens. It takes the teamplay out of it imo. I won't say this game was all that team-oriented with the old system, but I don't see why the survivors should be forced to be chased by a killer for so long while also having to do more gens then others. You can't have the best of both worlds unless you're hard carrying as a survivor, and at that point, you're probably going to get tunneled and camped to Hell anyway. This also causes Survivors to be more altruistic, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but it quickly turns into one when you have a whole group of randos running to unhook you because they want the points, even if it means not doing objectives or farming you. Survivors shouldn't pip if they weren't doing jack all game and still survived through hatch, but Survivors pulling their weight shouldn't be punished for not being able to do everything at once. (Which is what it feels like you have to do with the new system, because of everything that you need.)
---
-&gt;As for ranks settling 'In a few weeks' I have to disagree. I know there's always going to be the occasional high rank killer/survivor or low rank killer/survivor, and I don't mind that. But the amount it's at now is God awful. You either get a row of really great games, or a row of bad games where matchmaking doesn't know what numbers are. I would be okay with this if this was closer to when Plague first released (And with it, the new system) but she's been out for what's nearing to be a month now. I get that matchmaking takes time to settle, but I'd like to think that even more casual players will have had their stuff settled through matchmaking by now. (I say this as a casual player myself.)
---
Imo, survivors are punished too harshly. You're not supposed to gen rush because it makes the game go by too fast, even though that's the survivor's objective (do gens, power exit gates, escape). Survivors struggle to reach red ranks unless they farmed for it w/ a SWF group, while killers in high ranks get punished in the same vain by having unfair lobbies that to them are probably just a bunch of potatoes. (That also isn't mentioning that Killers themselves kinda got screwed with the system... at least from what I've heard. Few times I played killer I didn't have an issue, but I'm mid rank, so it's obviously a bit different.)
---
Hhhrrggghh Entity, I'm trying to stalk the survivors
---
What would Jason‚Äôs power be?
---
^^^^Yeah, I'm convinced high rank survivors just don't exist anymore. My bud who's a rank 1 killer claims to have a similar issue.
---
&gt;I already searched and couldn't find it.
---
Either you are lying or incredibly dumb who can't even use a search tool.
---
If you search for "shrine" and sort by "new" is the first two results. 
---
And one of the ace perks - with the hand icon 
---
I could get myself a frozen coke from maccas and dare my friends to do dumb shit with that $1.20
---
Can't hide with Jane.. 
---
Making low tier Killers worse indirectly buffs high tier Killers by making them better. Basically more Survivors running Mettle of Man means more dead perks that Billy / Mikey doesn't have to worry about when they instadown.
---
It's not a direct buff but technically speaking it does make strong Killers better and weak Killers worse.
---
Lol idk man, you're on the internet. All the info is out there. Like the other guy said,  it's already on the sub you're posting on
---
You are missing the part where survivors can't do anything against him other than getting hit. He denies pallets, windows and even stealth if you are in his terror radius when he hits someone else and decides to switch targets. 
---
The fact that he needs multiple hits by default makes him the weakest game in the game but, if you add Franks Mixstape to that mix, he is one of the most broken killers. 
---
You can wait over the corner wait till he mends abit rush him - his metter will be down to 0 and loser the chase again - you have a survivor on the ground 
---
Buddy what's your problem? I already searched and didn't find anything, so I figured just asking would be best.
---
Apparently just simply asking a question is a problem.
---
or maybe they are dumb and thought it was a mori
---
Mettle is not one hit per match. If the Killer is fucking stupid you can potentially use it for all 3 hooks.
---
I was talking to a friend about this today. I think its totally possible to get jason. Look at mortal kombat, they were able to license him in. I think it would top the legacy of licensed killers, especially if they put jason from fvj in the game
---
Can use trees as hooks
---
We‚Äôre talking about issues that happen for literally every player every game- the Adept trophies were NEVER popping. That means they didn‚Äôt even test it in their internal environment OR their test environment is so different from Prod as to be useless. This wasn‚Äôt a rare bug that happened if the wrong textures interact, it was a mistake in the coding that a single test would have found.
---
But go on, tell me again that testing is pointless. I‚Äôve only been doing this for twenty years.
---
Thanks for that POV never thought about that 
---
Certainly a lot of fun mori potential
---
I was running around with Pharmacy for my first few matches with Ash and the first time I opened a chest I said "I swear to god if you don't say Groovy when I pick up this medkit I will be so disappointed."
---
Very disappoint, but it's still awesome that he talks in the pregame lobby.
---
The visual fx are waaaay better. It was the only thing that sort of bothered me with season 1.
---
What make you me now? Are you not good wise, you half sole?
---
What does Franks Mixtape do?
---
Fucking yes. I‚Äôd have been shitcanned for releasing any of the bugs they‚Äôve let through into the wild.
---
How old are you? Go make it. If $2.50 is a problem for you then youre either really young in which case you can go make it yourself,  or if youre older you need to work more and not be playing games lol. Dont just accept something like being poor go change it. 
---
Easy solution - play as killer. 
---
In this case it is used to show the other player that people might be laughing at him, to show him dominance. I try not act stupid when interact with strangers, so if i would write something stupid, it gets posted and people laugh at me, it wouldn't feel nice.
---
She is clearly readin the perk to see how it differs from the clearly better spine chill perk due to icon
---
It deactivates and you can't build stacks after you use it, so it's hard limited to one per game.
---
I tried to go away from the traditional tier list. Average tier is not A tier and gimmick tier is not B/C/D tier
---
I didn't feel like rating them on their sgrength, it's hard to explain, but it's not because something is in the gimmick tier that they are worse than the average tier.
---
I won't deny that flip flop belongs in the "average tier" nor will I admit it does, I was quite uncertain as to where I should place Ash's perks. I just so happened to feel like making a tierlist the day Ash came out. I haven't even played since his release, so you will probably know better where the perks belong than I do
---
I just froze like an hour ago so .... I can't say that sadly even after the patch notes ...
---
In all honesty if they ever did add Part 6 Tommy it'd take a whole lot to make me ever play another Survivor. 
---
Wholesome and factual - it would be pretty cool to have Scooby-Doo-esque cosmetics too. 
---
maybe I'm just not seeing it, but what do you GET for participating? or ranking high or whatever? I don't mean to sound like a greedyguts, but what's the point of participating if you don't even get rewarded for it? 
---
Really? Well that's really fucking stupid. Actually Decisive Strike 2.0 lmfao.
---
*Hgggnn Colonel...*
---
It is cool that he can speak, but I‚Äôd call it a waste to have these perfectly good voice lines and only have them for the Lobby. I know he‚Äôd be at a disadvantage, but I‚Äôm pretty sure people care more about Ash saying ‚Äúgroovy‚Äù while picking up an item than if the killer heard you because you insulted them. 
---
Sounds about right, mid-late game DS basically.
---
You get nothing just the satisfaction of where you are in the leader board 
---
They didnt have licensing problems back in time as they do now. So i dont know.
---
Has anyone else noticed that other characters also make noises when dropping/doing shit? I noticed my dwight givin a little ‚Äúoh‚Äù when i went through a window that required me to drown a little bit of height.
---
How did you menage to get so many things wrong
---
Ash follows his own rules.
---
It's just pillow talk, baby.
---
Please enlighten me
---
Not lil Clem I‚Äôll only play grown up Clem!
---
Have you ever played this game? lol
---
Lullaby in the same Tier as Insidious? And whispers meta? explain yourself
---
He feels like a action figure on the lobby menu too me and idk why
---
Oh shit lil ash's dick fell off
---
Whispers is meta 
---
I mean there are many perks you can't really counter like adrenaline or just a simple hope that makes you easly outrun the killer. Also I though that was an obsession perk so you can see it I guess on one person but you can easly assume everyone have it atm if you ask me ^^. Anyway I don't really care you can't do anything but the fact that the weaker killers suffer the most from it which is not good. I need something that counters chainsaws and hatches and blinks and pukes even in the same manner
---
Zero counter? The person using it has to stay injured until the end of the match if they don‚Äôt want their aura seen by the killer until they‚Äôre downed the next time. Usually by the point Mettle is activated you‚Äôve already been hooked once. 
---
Looping compared to rape... well um... thats a 1st.
---
on what Killer, except maybe Huntress?
---
Just don‚Äôt answer him if you got a problem, stop trying to be a smartass
---
The entity didn't consider t-bagging and pointing.
---
I'd imagine borrowed time would trigger first. Mettle of Man specifically states that it activates on the next hit that would normally down you.
---
If you hook block 3 times for stacks and heal up again each time afterwards you are helping the killer more than the other survivors.
---
nope, thats a blink attack, which is a special ability attack.
---
They should make it cut off the puppets nose
---
&gt;And whispers meta?
---
If it was from my own experience, I'd have placed it in "average" but in almost every dead by daylight guide where the best killer perks got mentioned, whisperers was one of the mentioned perks
---
&gt;Lullaby in the same Tier as Insidious?
---
I think you misunderstand the way my tiers work. It's not because something is in the gimmick tier that it is worse than the average tier. The gimmick and average tier are both for perks that are not meta and not useless, the gimmick one is for gimmick builds and the average one is for perks that aren't gimmick, but fall out of the meta or are strong enough to stay out of the "useless" tier
---
Ash doesn't fear, Ash will end up asking the killers questions. Ash Vs Teenagers lol.
---
I‚Äôm new to the game can someone explain to me what NOED is
---
Ace might get lucky.
---
My question is why would they make a perk you pretty much cant counter. Even if I know MoM is coming I cant do shit about it. It's even worse when you realise that chainsaws and shit still proc it as long as the survivor goes from injured to dying
---
Nope they‚Äôve been there for awhile
---
No, just rare.
---
yikes, no thanks then. Even a lil bit of bp would have been nice. 
---
Whispers is good on everyone 
---

Be yourself. You don't have to turn into a "hey guys, what's up?!" kind of guy, but talk a bit more as if you're talking to your friends, even if there are zero viewers. Comment or explain on what you're doing. Long stretches of silence often aren't that interesting for viewers. Most people join not only for the game, but also your personality.  
---
So engage with your viewers if they're there, welcome them and talk with them. Keep your chat open on a different monitor or your phone.  
---
Make a schedule and stick with it. Play every night at 8 pm, or every few days in a week. Write it down on your profile page. Also be prepared that you might have zero viewers for weeks, don't be discouraged. Just play and have fun. If you play consistently, you will eventually end up with regulars. 
---
I disagree with so many of these i dont know where to start
---
The fact that people wear neon cosmetics on Feng and Nea instead of sticking to P3 Claudette proves that people don't give a shit about putting themselves at a disadvantage.

Horton?

Try them out, convinced me to get Leatherface.
---
Disagree with so many. The way these are split up is just weird. Just labelling them A-D tier would be way easier
---
Please do start, I literally posted this to talk about it. One thing I'd liek to mention before you start: average doesn't mean it is better than gimmick. It just means that it isn't a gimmick perk, is strong enough to stay out of the useless tier, but too weak to get in the meta tier
---
Not new, just rare! My bad guys

Cool story dipshit go eat shit
---
Yeah, but if the killer leaves you on the ground, you wont get hooked, and your teammates can just pick you up, and if they juggle, it just wastes their time. Although that's a good idea to heal up to 99 with self care.
---
Whispers is meta on a number of killers, and has been for a long time now. Have you never seen highly skilled huntresses? They all run whispers for a reason lol
---
Is this an agreement or disagreement?
---
fucking savages!
---
Thats dumb imo
---
But it works with Franklins, so it has to be a bug. 
---
Damn autocorrect
---
Nah, it‚Äôs pretty bland on stealth killers, pretty well everyone else can make good use out of it though, except for billy as it completely changes his playstyle. 
---
What kind of Nurse will hit you without blinking, you know what i mean?

Euro and Pound is different...

II‚Äôm also from Israel and it was a problem like 4 days ago, took 20 minutes to find a lobby and it was always a Japanese killer. But now it‚Äôs cool, I join European lobbies and get good ping, idk why you‚Äôre complaining now lmao 
---
It's still tripping me out, tbh.
---
Youve ranked them in such a weird way.
---
Anyway DS, unbreakable should be higher. Streetwise is crap but not worse than half the perks in yellow. 
---
A ton of the yellow level perks are useless. 
---
There are at least 3 months of challenges on DBD official twitch and anyone can enter. 
---
I very much dislike this leaderboard because some people are playing nothing but nurse and sweating their butts off, making the life of survivors miserable. 
---
At least they were smart enough and make it emblem based which means killers can't go Iri Huntress with Ebony Mori, they need to get 10 hooks and 18 hits to get Iridescent in Devout and Chaser. 
---
Some people in here acting like you killed their whole family in front of them lmao
---
I was really hoping he would just lift up the puppet, stare at it for a moment, then sit it back down
---
Thats not what I was trying to achieve with this tier list. If you want me to explain: Meta is equivalent to S tier and useless is equivalent to F tier. Average and Gimmick are both inbetween, one is not supposed to be better at the other. I should have done this more as a "category list" instead of a tier list, I am sorry for the confusion. Please do tell me the ones you disagree with
---
And jumpscared lol

Tbf he did say he looked but did he just scroll down two posts and say fuck it?

Hag

---
I'd kind of prefer Baal, tbh. He could make himself look like one of the other survivors and suppress his terror radius until it was too late.
---
Why does everyone say this when I post a comment on reddit? 
---
Bashes against tree for 10 minutes to make sure it dead
---
If the legions above rank 13 give or take they will likely tunnel survivors pretty hard, if that‚Äôs the case and they aren‚Äôt running franklins they will likely get two kills and the two people they get will not be able to stop it. Maybe you‚Äôve just been lucky?
---
I thought Eligos would‚Äôve been cool. 
---
Or maybe as a skin
---
I think you're misunderstanding. The perk "activates" and is ready to use the third time you take an M1 hit. When it activates, the next hit that you take that would put you into dying is ignored, and the next time you heal to full, the killer gets the permanent aura reading effect.
---
So the third time you get hit, you are now in danger of the aura reading thing kicking in, which will happen the next time you heal up, *even if* you haven't used the "ignore the next dying hit" part of it yet.
---
What perks with no counters? What broken loops, infinite‚Äôs have been gone for ages bucko and no one said they were ok. Simmer down champ.
---
Wraith doesn't give stacks if its a surprise attack I've learned
---
I usually play Claudette (not immersive btw) and whenever there's 3 other men in the lobby I'm like, "hey guys, who wants to be the first to come to my pool party? But remember, only one is allowed" then I watch em fight among themselves.
---
Tapping that last 1% done when they're near the killer is not dealing with a downside. 
---
&gt;I dunno what this new obsession with surveliance is. Its good for a 3 gen situation but this strat never works well. 
---
&gt;Bamboozle is 90% of the time a waste if you can play tiles properly
---
I wasn't sure whether I should have put these perks in the meta tier. Nurse's calling, surveillance and bamboozle were all in the "average" tier untill I decided to change them last second
---
&gt;NOED and Rancor are crutches and risky not good. They are big gambles.
---
They definitely are crutches. But risky and a big gamble is one of the last things I'd say they are.
---
NOED gets some use about 50-60% of the matches, 20-30% of the matches, it doesn't activate because it didn't even get to end game and 10-20% of the matches, it doesn't get any use because the totems are gone or because it gets cleansed before you can hit someone. I wouldn't call that risky to be honest. Also, you don't even have to do anything to earn NOED
---
Ranchor's only real risk is that the obsession is able to avoid you because they can see your aura, it also gets a little less use since it only works on 1 person, but it does guarentee a kill if you get them down, it can't be destroyed and it gives an extra effect of revealing survivor locations
---
I hate Ranchor and NOED, but I couldn't place them in other tiers than meta
---
We have a jokester over her boys!
---
The counter is play a killer with a special attack. Which is more than half of them. 
---
Hitting people when they‚Äôre in lockers and injured shouldn‚Äôt work, but it does too.
---
Monitor and abuse is NOT good on doctor, it is good on any other killer but not the doctor
---
Sorry it is so confusing
---
She's really not. She just has good stall (which isn't even that good, unless you're running hex ruin/corrupt intervention). She lands her ambush, chases, knocks down eventually, traps, hooks. This is going on while the other 3 survivors (if they're good) pop 2 gens. It takes a while to catch people and trap them, and if you're hovering boxes survivors can pop more gens. Her ambush is her best quality imo. IMO she shines the best when its down to the survivors popping the last gen. If you can pressure the survs to clump the last threee gens together, you can really pressure them into taking hits, getting trapped and hook. I think that saving at least 2 traps until the last 2 gens is where she really shines. 
---
Lmao, what? 99%-ing a heal and slugging are two different things, dude.
---
I hope you are not providing an example from like two days ago bc I got facecamped to death after the gates were open and my team didn‚Äôt even try to save me, and just so you know i‚Äôm still mad about it. 
---
My condolences.
---
The poor sportsmanship in this game is the worst I've ever seen.
---
Medkit?
---
Yeah, that's my point. Freddy sucks at his own job unless you get lucky on RNG or the survivors are potatoes (both things that are completely out of his control).
---
I hate people who dc. Just play the game and die, who cares. Sure your rank will differ but you‚Äôll still be getting the points 
---
Oh so this game depicts murder of minors
---
Nice
---
I sure tought about this when placing it there, but "good on the majority of killers" or "good on all killers except 1" just felt unnecessary to write down. And even so, doctor can still get use out of this perk if he also uses the addons that decrease his terror radius in punishment mode, he can easily sneak up to people, but this would obviously be concidered a gimmick
---
I am 21 yo i am tryng to change it but its hard i have my mental reasons but this is not a place to talk i just wish People wouldn t talk from asses but ty for advice
---
How so? Those are both strategies to counter different perks or situations, why would you remove only one of them?
---
Nurse blink hits don‚Äôt count, billy and bubbas chainsaw, plague can just puke on him and then hit him preventing him from getting to use the perk ever, hatchets, legion, ant instadown addon or perk, need I go on? Your complaining about a perk without even knowing how it works lol
---
They're just jelly you're capable of such level of immersion in the Dead by Daylight game 
---
Dream Chaser And Surprise Attack are just scoring Hit events. Those are not augmented attacks. Feral Frenzy is a different kind of attack all together. 
---
MoMis just to help versus regular hits that would put you from injured to dying. Getting one shot by exposed effects will not be resisted. 
---
Thanks fam that means a lot 
---
Oh, ho, ho, the worst example by far is Adam's Graduation Suit.
---
Whether it's OP or broken I can't say (haven't had it in a killer match yet) but I do think it's a pretty strong perk. But this:
---
&gt; Requires a lot of things to happen correctly to use it.
---
Is just untrue. Literally all it requires is being hit 3 times. That's it.
---
They did do that, then rolled back again.
---
We currently have the same matchmaking as before Chapter 11
---
They need to do some work on the punishment system for this game
---
eh in that Panda game you're talking about he wasn't playing very well. Like, he got tricked by the same window fake twice within 30 seconds for instance 
---
What time are you playing? I live in England and playing in the morning has me matching up with mostly Japanese players.
---
Aura isn‚Äôt shown until you‚Äôve fully healed.
---
"Pick yourselves up and Sally Faccketheth! Sally Faaackth! .....sally forth...."
---
Self-care and no mither
---
With basic atacks. Which best killers don't use. Also you have to stay injured otherwise it wont work again /which is not a problem I guess/
---
You're just jealous that Dwight doesn't say PIZZA TIME in the lobby 
---
Nahhh
---
I don‚Äôt really see that as a problem. The downside of MoM is still weak not because of the ability to 99% the heal. I mean, yeah, you‚Äôll see his aura on the other side from the map, what can you really do if you are not Nurse or Billy? Watch him teabag from the distance? 
---
I disagree. While I now know that she‚Äôs got limited traps and that makes more sense, having to go to three defuse things is kinda bullshit. It takes up way too much time and by the time you‚Äôre done, (if you survive) every one will be dead or unhelpful. I haven‚Äôt really run into any issues with other characters so imo she needs a nerf. 
---
I heard somewhere that the Nurse is Meg's mom. Can anyone explain to me this theory please.
---
Yup, he was on me after 3 gens and when he couldn't get me, he stood still for about 30 secs and then I was downed. 
---
Enduring spirit fury
---
I'm sure Jason statham would've made a fantastic ~~killer~~survivor
---
Okay that's strange
---
"You'd be surprised what tools can save a life"
---
1. Is the perk very strong on it's own regardless of (most) killer(s), killer perks, teammate perks or own perks?
---
Yes -&gt; meta
---
No -&gt; go to 2
---
2. Does the perk require other perks/items or a specific killer to be useful?
---
Yes -&gt; Gimmick
---
No -&gt; go to 3
---
3. Is the perk very situational?
---
Yes -&gt; go to 4
---
No -&gt; go to 5
---
4. Does it's upside give you a big enough adventage to be worth the downside?
---
No -&gt; Useless
---
5. Does the perk give you a noticable positive effect?
---
Yes -&gt; Average
---
YESSSS LOL! This meme comes back&lt;3
---
...But you're eventually going to be more than 16 meters away again and they'll still see you
---
Eligos would be pretty sweet. But I still love the idea of having bad Ash in the game, and whenever he hits someone he says "I'm bad Ash" like how he says in the movie (Ash vs evil dead) and when he hits surv Ash he says "you're goodie little two shoes".
---
Oh dude I‚Äôm sticking! I love DBD to much and start my strums off with it. But I love to always spread positivity and try to have people have fun. Should come by sometime check it out my dude!! Name same as channel. 
---
Nurses and Sloppy butcher work well together. People taking longer to heal gives you more a chance to see their aura. 
---
Any killer with a large TR, it‚Äôs especially meta on nurse due to her struggles with finding survivors. 
---
Dude,i'm complaining cause U can't find European survivors as a killer. All the survivors I find are from asia with a ping of 300+. The only way to find European survivors for me is to turn on a VPN(which also doesn't always work for some reason).

---
That is a problem, because what should be a massive downside turns out to be completely negated if a survivor can be essentially healed while not actually being all the way healed. And if you don't see how having eternal aura-reading on someone until they get downed is bad, you're crazy.
---
Dont buy it right now. Especially if its not in a sale. It's unstable af and its in a pretty bad spot community wise
---
Not if the killer downs you since they're close. After that, nothing happens from MoM.
---
lol.
---
Never have I ever Seen a good nurse in YouTube/Twitch use whispers
---
You are aware that the survivor doesn‚Äôt just start out with 3 stacks right? You are ignoring the entire buildup of the perk to try and construct an argument in which you aren‚Äôt wrong. Clearly I‚Äôm wasting time on you.
---
Different times. It can be in the morning,afternoon,evening or even night and the result is the same.
---
Surveillance doesn't get used often
---
&gt; Ormond has a weak building and some of the most unsafe pallets on any of the maps.
---
This is the shit I'm talking about. Like, this is a fundamentally absurd thing to say with absolutely no basis in reality. Ormond is a mess of jungle gyms with safe pallets and the resort usually spawns two safe pallets and is a BL paradise. You're just saying shit that's blatantly untrue on its face
---
And my killer play is fine. You're just a troll saying absurd untrue things.
---
What wrong with NOED?
---
So what the guy above said isn't true. The console version doesn't cost more. Its just a better value. 
---
That always sucks. Sometimes it‚Äôs better just not to go for it. 
---
Now that I debunked your entire point you move to another thing. Knowing you're wrong about everything you just decided to pull out. Clearly I'm wasting time on you
---
There is something to pay for this week. So it kinda makes sense to hold it oFF for another week.

Don't be an hypocrite, you're complaining because he slugs people and doesn't play the way you want him to play.

Ha yeah
---
As a kid, my dad showed us Army of Darkness several times. It wasn‚Äôt until the ED remake came out that I realized they were from the same series because I had never seen the originals. I the AoD was a stand alone film.

 I wouldn‚Äôt say balanced landing is that high as it is situational and it depends on the map if it‚Äôs useful or not.

If only.
---
It's interesting to be sure, though why are given the info that Kate is in a locker is beyond me seeing as you're the killer.
---
Sounds like an alternate version of the Wraith Cloak.
---
Bet you play Ruin
---
Better yet: lie. "He's hanging around the shack."
---
Killer doesn't necessarily know you lied.
---
Anything involving the words Twitch and DBD is a hard pass for me. Are there even any Fog Whisperers on Console or is this just pure PC stroking? 
---
The Spirit Fury + Enduring combo is one of the best combos in the game rn. I left Hag for Spirit because Hag just doesn‚Äôt bring enough to the table. If the killers power helps kill a survivor, it‚Äôs a good killer. Hag just doesn‚Äôt fill that hole well enough. If you don‚Äôt feel like giving up 2 perk spots you can try Brutal Strength (Not the best perk IMO)
---
I put it in average simply because (as far as I know) it requires endurance to be useful. And since my description of meta was "strong regardless of perk or killer" I couldn't put it there
---
I disagree. I‚Äôve had no issues with other killers except her. If I‚Äôm noticing something‚Äôs unfair there‚Äôs an issue.
---
Yeah it's been a really problematic perk so far. 
---
she's really not that strong. you're just a noobie so it seems that way. get  a game with instasaw billy, 9001 blink nurse or myers with either of his ultra rares and you'll see what op looks like in this game
---
Lol thats the fun of the game imo. Small shit like knowing that the timer doesnt start until you're saved is a small detail that changes the whole aspect of the game. You could have one dude WANTING to be trapped by the pig. Well, now he can turn it into a mind game vs the pig. She can chase him, not allowing the trap timer to tick, or she can camp boxes trying to find him. All these choices make the game fun
---
Shitpost aside, that final perk is actually interesting an idea.
---
WHY IS THE MATCHMAKING CONSTANTLY MESSED UP ON CONSOLE. I WAIT LIKE TEN MINUTES ONLY FOR THE KILLER TO DODGE. ALSO WHY DOES EVERY KILLER HAVE 500 PING ITS PISSING ME OFF.
---
Yes, if you are going to claim that fucking Ormond is bad for looping and has a weak building you are a lying troll. Do you think people are stupid?
---
REVERT THE FUCKING RANKING SYSTEM, BHVR!
---
90% OF SURVIVORS ARE STUCK IN PURPLE RANKS, UNABLE TO CLIMB EITHER BECAUSE THEIR TEAMMATES ARE TOO GOOD OR TOO SHIT.
---
I WANT TO SHAKE(/intensifies) YOU, DEVS!
---
Tilting someone to DC is more fulfilling than using a Mori. 
---
hahahahahahah amazing
---
I'll never forget that movie. We watched it when I was a kid. My brother is 7 years older than I am. I remember him eating spaghetti, just took a big mouthful when the eyeball flew into Ash's mouth. Ut was hilarious when we were kids. My brother almost puked.
---
you can (and always could) run multiple of the same obsession perks (DS, ooo, etc)
---
Ty
---
MoM should be an obsession perk too.
---
This is such an obvious "you" problem. Literally no one else has trouble like you're describing. And you aren't even acknowledging anyone's points. You're just saying "nope it's hard for me therefore OP"
---
Then that may be more the fault of a kind of odd way of doing a tier list, seeing as it's labelled meta but one of the meta perks technically doesn't fall under the definition due to it being a combo perk, despite it actually being meta.
---
lol only tunnelling killers worry about DS, and sounds to me if you're defending NOED and complaining about DS then you must be a bad killer.
---
I'm a killer main and NOT ONCE has Decisive Strike been used on me, and I'm a casual survivor but I'm on the survivor side on this one.
---
You just stated the problem. All the DLC killers seem to be OP or you can make them OP. If you don‚Äôt see that as an issue then I don‚Äôt know what to say. Plus I‚Äôm a veteran when it come to playing video games I‚Äôm pretty good at most games so I‚Äôm not really a noob.
---
You don't need surveillance *and* discordance. You really only need one tracking perk like that. I'd suggest replacing it with Enduring, if you have it. (Enduring + Spirit Fury is a majorly strong combo if you can fit them both.)
---
The most effective use of her power is actually *not* using it in some cases. I'm sure you've heard of Spirit's mindgames. Just stand still on one side of a thrown down pallet and wait a few seconds to see what the survivor does. Either they wait, in which case you use your power and try and go around the pallet to hit them. They run, in which case you continue chasing as normal. Or, if you're lucky, they vault the pallet and fall into your arms. Doesn't always work, but it's nice when it does. 
---
Also, obligatory mention that the prayer beads add on is amazing. Let's you snatch people off gens because they can't hear you coming. 
---
Which reminds me, not a bad idea to try and fit Distressing into your build. Having a larger terror radius means you can phase walk without people hearing you more often. 
---
Yea I can do decent with hag but never really good unless the team is terrible, but ima just try spirit fury with enduring to see how that works out, I know that combo but I never thought about putting it on spirit
---
Agitation for the 100000000th time
---
I've never lied on here once.  Not once.  I don't have issues on that map as killer ever.  It has since fake ass pallets that are not safe both inside and outside of the building.  Why am I feeding you further I just said I wouldn't lol?  You're the most insulting dismissive person I know on this thread.  You had reasonable solo responses so I thought maybe you changed in your absence.  But nope.  Same old insulting troll.  We're done dude.
---
It's not so bad once you've played for a while, and playing the killers yourself is the easiest way to learn. This is definitely more mechanic heavy than F13.
---
GLHF! (Oink, oink.)
---
How many times do you run into Instaheals as killer? Also just invest in exposed effects. If they are healthy you can still one hit them. Also is you play Plague, Huntress, Legion, Myers, Billy or LF, MoM will just be mildly annoying at best. 
---
Why thank you for the clarification

---
I mean yeah, but in game there is only one obsession for that game and whoever is the chosen obsession will wind up having negative or positive obsession perks applied only to that character. 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a subreddit for this. To point out problems that people have with the game. I could care less if you don‚Äôt like it. If I have an issue with something I‚Äôm gonna speak up about it. 
---
It is most certainly intended. Everything from the wall lengths to the pallet spawn distances are balanced for looping. When you vault a window 3 times during chase it gets blocked. Chasing builds up bloodlust and makes a killer faster to help terminate window loops and eliminate infinites, while breaking a pallet breaks bloodlust. The distances around loops is carefully tuned with the fast vault speed to gives survivors just enough time on the window vaults to make it back around the loops until the killer gets bloodlust built up. The games entire mechanics have been built around looping. Yeah, it seems silly that you can run around in front of the killer in a horror game, but that's just the way it is with DBD. They seemed to want more interaction between the killer and survivor, so we get a game that's more about chasing than searching.  
---
You can't run away and hide against a good killer for long. If you watch people play at the higher ranks in DBD everyone uses looping. The killer has too many ways to track for hiding to be effective. The survivor is always going to be within a few meters of a gen that was being worked on. If they run you can just follow the scratch marks. If they don't, you know because there are no scratch marks, and you pinpoint their position using process of elimination. Hiding is not an effective strategy at high rank, and that is pretty much a unanimous consensus if you watch any of the streamers or youtubers.
---
&gt;Wake up tier 3? Really? That perk has saved me so many times. Not from actually waking from Freddy but that 15% faster door opening and showing other survivors when I‚Äôm at 
---
15% is a pretty small boost to be honest, leader gives a bigger boost and to more things. Most people also don't need any extra help to locate the exits
---
&gt;Also hope needs to be A tier. It‚Äôs only bible counter to noed and often helps you sprints away from the killer mid chase to mind game to a door
---
It's effects are too little too late to actually be concidered meta, it's a good perk, but definitely not meta
---
Dude even if you have seen the show and loved it, it's an easy reference to miss from fucking 4 years ago lol.  Y'all need to chill.
---
\*Ass cheeks clapping in the distance
---
Ok I‚Äôll take that advice.
---
The only time you will have a problem if if you are on a team that cannot loop at all.  If she gets 3-4 traps on at once it‚Äôs game over. Most of time 90% you will not have your head pop unless she is chasing you off and in and you fail skill checks with a tremendously failed skill check punishment is active.  Keep in mind the traps don‚Äôt start until 1 gen is completed and if she is chasing you the timer stops.  A good pig will not leave you.  They will funnel you to the entity.  I‚Äôm a pig main when I play killer and I will say the times I don‚Äôt go after the rbt I end up only getting like a 2k if I‚Äôm lucky. 
---
every survivor is getting the benefits from the obsession perk even if they‚Äôre not obsessed, don‚Äôt know what you mean
---
Ima try it tho nd ima avoid noed cus I feel like it‚Äôs really unskillful and there‚Äôs no point like you‚Äôre not ganna get better with noed
---
And I find those really useful too, those are the ones I aim for
---
This guy fully described how she works.
---
lmfao
---
you're so full of shit. The audacity to say this nonsense
---
like holy goddamn shit you're actually trying to claim that Ormond spawns unsafe pallets. That's like Trump saying his dad is from Germany. Why even fucking lie about that?
---
YOU'RE READY TO PLAY? HERE'S 10 LOBBIES WITH 1000+MS PING JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT!
---
It doesn't. 
---
Hag Teleport Hits don't work.
---
Spirit post-phase Grudge hits don't work.
---
Nurse's Lethal Blink doesn't work.
---
Huntress Hatchets don't work.
---
Plague's Corrupted Purge doesn't work.
---
Billy's Chainsaw won't work.
---
Leatherface's Chainsaw won't work.
---
Legion's Frenzy doesn't work.
---
I find it useless to be honest.
---
Definitely the best on Billy, but from my experience it works pretty good on Spirit too. The best Spirit‚Äôs have a lot of faith in their ability to Phase-Walk, trusting yourself with it might help cut down that nerve
---
Im defending a decent perk and it sound to me like u dribble a DS survivor and im am too a killer main with a lil survivor on the side albeit a disgustingly bad one have never DC'ed on either side when getting my ass spanked or because the killer/survivor brought in a certain thing....just take the L and the bloodpoints and move on
---
I just don't think spirit furry is meta tho, I tried to rank every perk looking at them as objectively as possible. If a perk automatically requires a second perk to be meta, it is no meta
---
FOR SOME GOD DAMN REASON THE GAME STARTED TO RUN REALLY BADLY, WELL NOT REALLY THAT BADLY BUT NOW I KNOW HOW CONSOLE PLAYERS FEEL WHEN PLAYING KILLER. THING IS, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING IT, IS IT JUST DBD BEING DBD? OR IS IT MY COMPUTER THAT IS CAUSING THIS? EVERYTHING WAS FINE BEFORE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HAVE CAUSED THIS. 
---
In mexico we have the 3 seasons as well.
---
god you are the most annoying kind of fucking person
---
Ok I‚Äôll give you hope not being meta but it is extremely helpful. As for the 15%, it has saved me soooo many times to get the quick gate exit.  It‚Äôs not so much about showing you where the exit is but more showing other survivors which dood you are going to slam open.  I do agree though that adrenaline and balanced are must use. Imo wake up and hope are very close to them in terms of usability.  When you have hope you get two minutes to come back into the match and save others or juke the killer because of the haste effect.
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound fun to me. That sounds unnecessarily complicated and hidden bullshit that you wouldn‚Äôt know about unless you‚Äôre a hardcore player. That‚Äôs not a good way to make a product.
---
Wait, what? An m1 hit shouldn't be waking anyone up.
---
Fuck off. Go back to 4chan.
---
Myers is 100x worse
---
Don‚Äôt think either is OP but Michael Myers has a lot of busted add ons
---
Based on some of the combos suggested here, maybe try spirit fury, enduring, StBFL, and a random fourth--a tracking perk for gens or BBQ. Once you get more confident in a chase, try some different things out. Spirit has one of the highest skill caps in the game, so don't be discouraged!
---
But she's not OP. For some reason you, personally, have trouble. The devs' job is not to cater to all your individual issues
---
STOP TUNNELING OFF HOOKS YOU ASSHATS
---
Lol I'm just memeing around I wouldn't really want him as a killer but its fun to think about. One thing most killers in this game lack are personality and Negan is fucking FULL of personality. Just him breaking a pallet and saying "Little pig little pig...let, me, IN!" or getting stunned and yelling "You little fucking shit! Get the hell over here!"....wait maybe I do want a Negan killer lol
---
You didn't answer my question
---
0/10, STBFL might as well be meta for m1 killers.
---
Yeah. Plus the meta really doesn't support slower/stalling killers right now, since gaining early momentum is so pivotal to controlling the match. It can be done, but it's a lot harder.
---
TL;DR: The percentages amount to exactly 100% but I only got Gold instead of Iridiscent. Most likely decimal values rounding up but it looks kinda funny.
---
I mean to each his own. I really enjoy compicated games that are designed this way. Much like tekken, where you really have to learn how to play. The same can be said about this game. I think it makes smaller communities, which imo are better. 
---
Tired: Strangling survivors
---
Wired: Loving and caring for survivors
---
I thought that something had to be funny to be considered comedy.
---
Why do you say that?
---
Maybe you're being a dick to the killers
---
I've seen other people say it, but playing as killer (im assuming youre a survivor main) can really teach you how to abuse them. Having trouble with the pig? Play a few games as her to see what difficulties you have vs survivors. Then take those difficulties that you know the pig has to your next survivor game and abuse the shit out of it. 
---
myers.
---
I know it sounds dumb , but i just learned it's a show , not a movie 
---
Each team in a tournament is 4-5 accounts, and each tournament would have a minimum amount of teams.
---
Like, you would have to work extra hard to scam a tournament and depending on the rewards it might not even be worth it.
---
But this way, we just dont get much at all so who the fuck cares hahaha
---
NOED is a Killer perk that activates when all 5 generators have been completed. It gives the Killer a speed boost and applies the "exposed" status to Survivors, which basically means the Killer only needs to hit you once to down you, instead of twice like normal. You also don't know it activates until you or someone else gets downed by it, so it has an element of surprise (although, as this post is joking, there tend to be ways to anticipate it coming.)
---
It's a Hex perk, which means it's tied to a totem. It activates randomly on one of the dull totems around the map once the gens are done. If you cleanse all the dull totems beforehand, it won't activate, so that is the counter to NOED, however it's common for the totems not to get cleansed if you play solo Survivor since you can realistically expect to cleanse around 3 totems maximum during a match, which means you're relying on other players to also cleanse them and they typically don't. 
---
Because the perk activates after the generators are done and it makes downing Survivors so much easier, there's a stigma against it as being a crutch perk that turns the game into easy mode. Survivors feel it's unfair because they get punished for doing their objectives well while the killer gets rewarded for not protecting their objectives well enough. There tends to be an (often accurate) assumption that if a Killer isn't very good, they probably run NOED.
---
My post is mostly pointing to behaviors from Killers that indicate they're kind of anxious about being able to secure kills, or in the case of Freddy, not very strong in the meta right now so they might need to rely on NOED. When I see these behaviors or just notice a Killer is generally unskilled, I start focusing on cleansing dull totems because it's a safe bet they have NOED. If a Killer is really good I don't cleanse totems. I probably don't have time to cleanse totems against a good Killer because they can apply enough pressure that I'm forced to react to them.
---
Definitely MoM, I spent a game running from a Wraith on Storehouse, ran them all over the map several times never got knocked down, kept finding grey medkits, healing, and then leaving them in the middle of the map.
---
Throughout the late stages I ended up finding an Alex's Toolbox, which I left by the exit gate for later (couldnt risk losing it).
---
By the end of the game, I took them on one more run along the perimeter, a few jokes and I ate a hit to get some distance. Once I got closer to the gate, I wanted to make sure I got to use MoM so I dead hard through a hit to get next to my toolbox, pick it up, tank one more hit and then just walk out of the trial like a boss.
---
Was supposed to get hooked but at that point I was having too much fun and ultimately my friend was pissed. XD
---
When people are simply telling you how Pig works and why she's not OP and you're just like "NO I HAVE TROUBLE SHES OP" over and over and over that is de facto making a demand 
---
I'd rather see Buffy come to DBD 
---
Spinsters, shut-ins, toll-vooth attendants, these are "alone people. Batmanuel is "lone," like a lone wolf or the Lone Ranger. *Lone* is an aesthetic choice, *"alone"* is a predicament. 
---
She‚Äôs dlc though right?
---
Definitely my favorite build!
---
CLOWN IS MORE UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINST THAN LEGION
---
I‚Äôm gonna be pissed if he is nerfed to death 
---
Yeah...dude, swinging at a kid is really bad publicity. DLC's have to know that their survivor will get hooked and die, I guess Bruce Campbell was ok with that.
---
SORRY BUT
---
SURVEILLANCE IS TOP TIER?
---
Yikes, it always sucks when this mistake mercy for lack of skill. I‚Äôm sorry you had that experience playing Legion. 
---
I personally try to go out of my way to not be toxic but people DC if more than 1 person has deep wound at a time. I literally only play Legion for dailies and still get DCs now feelsbadman 
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
Oh my god i missed that. Wow, that's really cool damn
---
do away with one of the aura perks and use Thrill of the hunt. Always run prayer beads. GG you win.
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
No it‚Äôs not. If you read MY POST, I said that I‚Äôm new to this game. I‚Äôm still learning things. People don‚Äôt just change opinions right away especially if they believe something to be true. I‚Äôm going to apply what everyone‚Äôs said and try to be a better player. Now please fuck off.
---
Only if they get shirtless cosmetics. 
---
does he really play a sound when you click on him? like freddy or myers
---
A file didn't install correctly. Verify your files through steam
---
It would be nice if the devs could stick to a decision whether perks apply to Feral Frenzy. I might just be salty from yesterday but I hate that Franklin's also applies to Frenzy hits.
---
I can't belive they actually added this to the game, oh my god
---
Slowly science starts to take shape. Lol Thanks. I'm sure that eventually we will see the extent of the off hook plays we can get, I was hoping for a, BT into DS, into MoM just for the lulz, but life eh?
---
FUCK METTLE OF MAN
---
Can hide in lockers to gain 20 seconds of no heartbeat lol
---
2 files failed to validate and will be required... seriously.
---
When youre in the chase and they loop you, phase while you stand between the pallet. They can't walk through your shell. Or phase in front of the window they keep vaulting. Mixing this with bamboozle. Jesus.
---
Survivor;
---
No Mither + Resilience + This is not happening + Dead Hard - Being constantly injured grants you the constant +9% action speed bonus &amp; makes great skill checks bigger which can soft counter ruin. Using dead hard is kind of a must to allow you live longer in this state
---
Plunderers + Ace in the hole + Pharmacy - Having Ace will allow you to pull out add-ons with the rarer items from plunders. Pharmacy allows you to loot chests quicker &amp; with ace it can allow you to gain add-ons for your medkit. This can include instant heals if you are lucky.
---
Adrenaline + Hope - The healing boost from adrenaline can get you out of a chase &amp; Hope is amazing for extending the chase against killers by making you almost run as fast as they can. Very effective against 110% movement speed killers as they will have only a 3% higher movement speed than you do effectively allow you to infinitely loop them.
---
Self-care + Botnay Knowledge - Bot stacks with self-care allowing you to heal at 83% speed. You dont have to waste as much time with self-care &amp; it can be used to counter sloppy butchers effect on self-care.
---
Quick &amp; Quiet + Dance with Me + Lithe - Can allow you to instantly escape a killer by breaking LOS &amp; running away with no scratch marks. Killers dont usually expect such a combination so usually you will lose the killer fast.
---
Deliverance + Borrowed time - Can allow you to save a survivor off the hook in a dangerous situation &amp; allow yourself to instead escape at your own leisure. Works well against camping killers if combined with dead hard or Mettle of man.
---
Spine Chill + Premonition - The ultimate stealth build. Using these allows you to know when a killer is coming after you from a distance &amp; to see what direction they are coming from. Really good against stealth based killers like Myers or Pig. 
---
Tenacity + Flip-Flop - If the killer is slugging survivors then using this combination will allow you to move away from the hooks while also converting recovery into wiggle. Can really save you from being hooked in bad places like the basement.
---
Spine Chill + Urban Evasion - Allows you to know when the killer is heading your way &amp; to begin to hide from the killers LOS. It can also be useful for telling you if the killer has seen you.
---
Killer;
---
Pop Goes The Weasel + Overcharge - This combination works amazingly well for destroying gen progression after a hook. If you kick a gen to regress it by 25% &amp; a nearby survivor comes over &amp; taps it, they have to deal with a risky skill check. Failing the skill check results in a further 15% regression penalty. Effectively making then gen lose 40% progress in one kick.
---
Overcharge + Huntress lullaby - Overcharges difficulty combined with Lullaby makes the skill check very difficult to complete. If the survivor fails the skill check then 21% gen regression occurs given if the totem remains up.
---
Haunted grounds + Any hex perk (excluding NOED) - Having 2 totems set as traps means survivors have a 2/3 chance of breaking the totem that is not your hex perk. The hex perk also may encourage survivors to take the chance &amp; break the hex as its hurting them. Only issue is that if all hexes break then your down 2 perks.
---
Overcharge + Unnerving - This is a perfect combination for a large terror radius or 3 gen strat. Overcharge is near impossible to counter with the 60% reduction in skill check size meaning survivors will commonly fail the skill check. This works best on killers like the Doctor.
---
Sloppy + Bloodhound - The extra bleeding helps tracking significantly with bloodhoud allowing you to use blood instead of scratch marks to follow survivors. Issue is that if you are decent at tracking then the perk combination wont really assist you. This can work well with the Legion. 
---
BBQ &amp; Make your choice or/+ Devour Hope - Both perks benefit you when you move away from the hook. BBQ gives you a reason to do that to place pressure on survivors working on gens far from the hook. Works best on killers with fast movement speeds like Hillbilly or Nurse.
---
NOED + Remember Me - Great combination if your having an end game build. Allows you to effectively win the game as chases can be finished much quicker. This works best on Freddy due to his constant map awareness &amp; it can allow him to defend his totem.
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury - Great combination for all M1 killers. Allows you to get free hits from pallets if they stun you. The issue is that survivors tend to adapt if they notice you have this combination. Have to play aggressively to make use of this combination. Works best on all M1 killers that deal with pallets like Clown or Myers.
---
Deerstalker + Knock-out or Third Seal - This is the ultimate slugging combination. Using knock-out allows you to hide the aura of dying survivors while deerstalker allows you to see wherever they are. Third seal is riskier but more secure to use then knock-out as many survivor perks can counter its effect such as Buckle up.
---
Pop goes the weasel + Discordance - Gives you a good idea on what generators have the most progression on them allowing you to destroy some of its progression. Works best on most killers though best are faster killers such as hillbilly or Nurse.
---
Nurses calling + Sloppy - Slowing down healing allows you to make better use of nurses to see survivors healing. Works best on small terror radius killers such as Myers or 110% movement speed killers. 
---
Infectious Freight + Knock-out or Third seal - Allows you to make use of Infectious Freight &amp; allow you to see if anyone is close enough to see dying survivors aura. This can be great but totally ruined if a survivor breaks third seal or has a perk that counters knock-out. Works best on Myers tier 3 or Nurse.
---
Rancor + Remember me or/+ Save the Best For Last or/+ Play with your food - Rancor allows you to mori your obsession at the end of the game. This works really well for removing your obsession from the game with minimal impact on perks that are affected by obsession. Killing your obsession allows you to have the full effect of remember me on survivors, Not waste stacks of STBFL on obsession &amp; Stop you using 2 hits to down a survivor wasting 2 stacks of PWYF.
---
On top of that, you don't have to have every line from the show memorized to be a fan
---
The game is pretty balanced the way it is as of right now I don‚Äôt think any major changes need to be made.. 
---
Usually happens once every few updates for me
---
You realize that the perk has a pretty big penalty for using it right?
---
Thanks. Have a good day ü§ô.
---
The build I‚Äôll recommend is Ruin, BBQ, Nurses and Sloppy. Spirit has a small terror radius of 24m and Nurses range is 28m. I usually see them within Nurses, then get a bit closer so they‚Äôre on the edge of my TR and then phase to them so they don‚Äôt hear the vacuum sound.
---
When it comes to tracking, sound is everything. Do you play with headphones? If not I really recommend you do. You need to be able to hear the footsteps, moaning and grass/environment rustling. At high ranks I have found survivors double backing during phasing (more common with iron will) which in this case you need to be listening for footsteps and zig zagging (harder to track scratchmarks as they are all over the place).
---
Her best addons for chase purposes are quicker activation charge time and speed. The longer it takes for you to activate and move, the more distance the survivor gains. The quicker you activate and the faster you move, the quicker you can catch up and end the chase.
---
Other tips is to look and see where you can see disturbances in the environment like grass moving as if someone is walking through it or crows taking off. Pro survivors stop running to avoid scratchmarks but without calm spirit, they will still alert the crows.
---
Shrouds are useful for picking up whether the killer has a mori or a shroud. (In most cases)
---
Just like how similar BP offerings vibrate with eachother the same thing will happen when a killer brings a shroud and you do too. Not saying the knowledge is super powerful, but nonetheless it does have some abstract use.
---
dont give them time to mend
---
I PLAYED A MATCH AGAINST A HARD TUNNEL CLOWN LAST WEEK AND THE FIRST PERSON HE DOWNED JUST HAD NO CHANCE TO PLAY THE GAME. I CAN'T SPEAK TO HOW WELL DONE THE SAVES WERE, BUT THE SURVIVOR DIDN'T REACHED JUST PAST 1,000 BP AND WAS OUT OF THE GAME RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THE FIRST GEN WAS DONE
---
These stats might be out of date but I bookmarked some of the stats for the add-ons of the pig if anyone ever gets interested in reading some of them.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7uzfqp/the_saw_chapter_guide_to_slightly_moderately/
---
Only thing I believe is outdated is the combat straps add-on being nerfed while crouching was buffed. That &amp; the terror radius being increased from 28 to 32m.
---
You have borrowed time on the best tier. Decisive strike does basically the same thing and you don‚Äôt have to be in the killers terror radious and the timer is 60 seconds. 
---
Quick and quiet is underrated
---
Tombstone is OP af. I used it once and I loved it. I gotta start being the killer more lol.
---
It's a babydick safety net brand new or weak killers bring in to crutch out a mindless kill at the end of the game.  If you bring NOED you are literally gameplanning for failure.  Learn to protect your objectives, apply intense gen pressure and you'll never need the training wheels on again.
---
Sounds interesting, but I don‚Äôt know how the perks explanation would work? 
---
In-game, you'll find the button in the top left corner on the main menu. On Twitch, you can find the panel below a stream where you would normally find other info and plugins. Currently it is limited to the official Dead by Daylight Twitch channel and approved Fog Whisperers.
---
But if you keep chasing the same survivor, the deep wound timer will stop and you‚Äôre losing your feral frenzy gauge.
---
That, and 2 (maybe 3) of us were going to use perks that helped each other out. It would've been an easy win against a Billy
---
Is the show that bad? I haven't given it a try yet, I only recently watched the original movies.
---
She's a seventeen year old girl from an American small town in the late 70's, whaddya expect.
---
With the legion to waste the survivors time, you can use feral frenzy and hit all the survivors so they have to mend, instead of doing gens and stuff. Usually the last survivor I strike I continue to chase them.
---
Rewards are decided by the people running the challenges. For instance, I could offer DLC codes to the top three people who participate in my challenge.
---
Hate that too. It's so annoying when you have to back out and then go into survive with friends and then invite. üòí
---
It's very frequently a crutch. It rewards the killer for not cleaning up the game before all the objectives are completed and can turn a complete landslide in the survivors favor into an undeserved 4k. 
---
Just play op killers
---
Yes, whoever buys it one way that ends up being quicker and more convinient to those without cells, while gaining something extra, is a shmuck.
---
Gee I sure hate doing things the optimal way, even if its the way thats gains me the most things...
---
idk what this person is.
---
yes, what I do is, stab them with frenzy, run up to them and block their way and down them with a normal hit
---
They are popular streamers and YouTubers in the DBD community, people like; hybridpanda, puggers, noob3 and tru3. There is a lot more but those are the only ones I know ahah 
---
Weird, what rank are u?
---
Borrowed time doesn't have a use limit. Decisive strike's stun is way too short to be viable. With borrowed time, you get a speed boost. If the killer runs enduring (wich is a meta perk), then decisive strike doesn't do anything useful. Yes it is active for a longer time, but if you don't need to use it in the first 20 seconds, you probably don't have to use it in the first 60 seconds either. And again, it's a gimmick perk, Gimmick doesn't necessarily mean worse than average it's bot really a list of strength and more of place within the game
---
Quick and quiet might be underrated, but it is still a Gimmick perk
---
Thanks!
---
WHERE THE HELL IS THE NEW OUTFIT FOR HAG?? 1ST IT DOESN'T RELEASE WITH THE DLC, THEN IT DIDN'T DROP LAST WEEK FOR WHATEVER REASON AND STILL NOTHING TODAY!! BHVR THIS IS A HATE CRIME 
---
Even Grown Up Clem sounds bad, she's still a young girl who we love and wouldn't want to see suffer like that.
---
I CAN NEVER FUCKING PLAY FREDDY WITHOUT THE SURVIVORS DCING. WHAT THE HELL?? YESTERDAY I GOT TWO 4K DC GAMES. I DONT UNDERSTAND. I THOUGHT ONLY LEGION GOT DCS LIKE THIS. PLEASE STOP FUCKING DCING WHILE IM PLAYING FREDDY, THANK YOU.
---
Nea about to give him head, lucky hoe
---
Thanatophobia should not be that high, even with the buff it still doesn't do nearly enough to make it useful on basically any killer other than Legion with a stall build. 
---
I use that build but I haven‚Äôt on sprit
---
I do use headphones and when they double back I find that difficult because I rely on their moaning sounds when they‚Äôre injured and the scratch marks when they‚Äôre appearing so I know where they are, but I think with practice I‚Äôll understand more when they stop running or double back
---
And those are the add ons I use because like you said I wanna give them as little time as possible for them to run away
---
THE COMMUNITY HAS TAKEN SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION OF TUNNELING. YOU AND YOUR TEAMMATES HAVE A PARTIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE YOU GET UNHOOKED SAFELY. UNHOOKING IN A TERROR RADIUS WITHOUT BORROWED TIME IS A BAD PLAY AND THERE SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SURVIVORS (YOU KNOW, THE ONES PLAYING THE CO-OP MODE), NOT PENALTIES FOR THE KILLER. THIS IS NEVER A TWO WAY STREET. THE SURVIVOR META IS TO NOT HEAL AND CRANK OUT GENS. DO YOU THINK THE SURVIVORS HAVE EVER ONCE SAID "OH HE DIDN'T GO AFTER THE UNHOOKED SURVIVOR, WE BETTER SLOW DOWN ON GENS"? 
---
This is good stuff. Great find.
---
I might have, since I never heard of the "phrase" metagame. But my point still stands, it's not a meta perk just because it gets used in meta builds just like other perks aren't gimmick perks just because they get used in a gimmick build
---
To be fair, this also is entirely something Behaviour would likely do. Leatherface's hammer still talks about hammering cattles. Such a monster he had to pluralize the plural.
---
Yeah, maybe it should be lower
---
Don't you mean Ded Ard
---
Yup this was 1 mil bp, 2 dailies saved, the daily for that day, got 150k from a perk in shrine, 250k from rancor in shrine plus all the games i played last night. Gonna P3 him as soon as i can
---
A good freddy is not even that annoying to play against.
---
Pretty sure it is in the current meta
---
You as well.
---
Here are a couple tips
---
1) better Pig players will try and use their crouch to get generator grabs so look around you while working on them
---
2) if you see a Pig crouch at a loop they're going to use their rush attack to counter the loop/pallet
---
Noob isn‚Äôt a fog whisperer. 
---
WHO HAS VOICE LINES?
---
Would sam or dean be the survivor added?
---
Platform?
---
Thanks for the input. 
---
Some might be rage quits but I have also found that when playing with my friends, half my team got DC, on their screen it looked like the killer DC but I was still in the game. There seems to be a lot of DC which are not really tied to people rage quitting or DC purposely
---
X box
---
Sometimes you have that one shitty ritual so you just gotta go for it or risk missing your chance to do that ritual at all for a long time. I usually just trash them but I can understand why a killer might just use it right away.
---
Sorry on PS4 but good luck!
---
I'm mentioning the chainsaw as part of a hypothetical situation where you get the most out of the two perks, especially since it revolved around a killer coming back to the hook, but not instantaneously, a survivor either using an insta heal, or Well make it, and THEN taking those hits in that specific order.
---
However unlikely it is, THAT would likely be the strongest use of those two perks, vs both going off because they're deflecting the same instance of damage because it works the same way at that point if you're pulled off the hook.
---
BT negates all dying damage for that hit and MoM denies you from going from injured to dying. Coming off the hook youre injured so both perks would negate the dying status together( to my knowledge of course).
---
I'm not here discussing the stacks, that's been covered on at least 5 different threads. I'm curious as to how we can use those stacks efficiently.
---
Thx
---
I thought that if you lunge while I‚Äôm feral frenzy, the power meter depletes slightly faster.?
---
Yuppers. It's so damn satisfying watching that bar fill so quickly. 
---
You and your attitude are what's ruining this game man, suck it up
---
Unless you don't actually deploy this tactic, and are just explaining it, in which case I'm sorry
---
I've always wanted this for a while, but I get why it'll (probably) never happen, it'd be too much to dedicate and coming up with animation ideas to cater to the personality would be excessively long. 
---
I'd love unique waking animations like David straight up punching someone awake or Dwight shaking someone really nervously. 
---
I HATE HIS LAUGH MORE THAN ANYTHING. ITS THE WORST!
---
The people saying "half the cast counters it" haven't played against it. I went against two 4 man SWF last night that all had some combination of DS/BT/MoM/Adrenaline. It's absolutely broken. No heals. Gen rush. If you're standing next to someone unhooking as Spirit, you take the f'ing M1 hit. You don't say "they might have MoM", phase, and try for a higher risk Grudge hit. So, someone unhooked, BT proc'd, MoM proc'd on the unhooker, then MoM proc'd after the BT survivor mended, then everyone escaped. Making the killer choose between M1 or special hits based on a perk a survivor might have is not at all reasonable. This is the exact same thing the devs said was the problem with the original DS: punishment for killers doing their only objective.
---
This is a fair explanation despite the issue with your tier list. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand how Decisive is a gimmick however, what perks need to be run with Decisive?
---
Yeah, the guy did some amazing work. Wish he was still around to look at the new killer add-ons like the Clown or Legion. Could finally figure out where this Legion blade exploit is coming from.
---
I've been running Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Deliverance, and Mettle of Man.
---
It's a bit mean.
---
Legion is certainly unhealthy for dead by daylight in my opinion. If you notice most of the popular content creators for this game have boycotted playing Legion except on rare occasions. Legion mains do get a lot of hate for defending their favorite killer because of his power.
---
I'm thinking of doing a killer/survivor rotation similar to Tru3Talent once I have every one to lv40. But I will include Legion since he is still a killer. When I level him up I am avoiding Franks mixtape unless i have to take it just because i dont like the addon. I believe there is counter play to him but I would love to figure out what it is. Maybe playing him will give me a better understanding of his weaknesses.

For Ash: Flip-Flop. If I was good at running around it‚Äôd be Mettle of Man but I like flip flops better
---
It's not even just for console, the past week I've been playing on PC with friends and there's been a lot of times where we sit in queues for over 10 minutes just to have the killer quit and then having to sit in another 10+ minute queue.
---
&gt; I GOT SAVED FROM THE HOOK AND ESCORTED TO THE GATE BY AN ASH WHO USED METTLE TO SAVE US BOTH.
---
I WAS TELLING MY BUDDY LAST NIGHT THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO USE THE PERK
---
ASH, THE NEW SURVIVOR SAYS A FEW THINGS IN THE LOBBY
---
Also YTF did we get 2 slugging related perks? It's a siuational game mechanic to begin with. And Unbreakable is a thing sooooo. ü§îü§∑ü§îü§∑ü§îü§∑ü§îü§∑
---
I actually don't think noob3 is one
---
From the looks it still looks like he is active here occasionally. Just not digging up the code. 
---
Honestly that's fine. He's done a lot of work for the community, so I am happy about that.
---
Of course she was a virgin. It's a horror film. 
---
Did you have to include that last part?
---
I SAVED SOMEONE FROM THE HOOK YESTERDAY WITH METTLE. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL HATE ON THE PERK, BUT WHATEVER.
---
Of course you don't, you empathize more with survivor gameplay to the extent where you have double standard for each. No judgement here or anything, most people do, but I think some self-awareness is in order for many of us. 
---
In all seriousness, can you just imagine how horrible it would be to deal with Mettle of Man and the old Decisive Strike combined together? 
---
The game got even more bugged later. I was playing against an Ebony Mori Prestige 3 Doctor, and he tried to tunnel the first survivor, failed, and then hooked me. After someone unhook me, I think the Doctor got stuck and cannot move for some reason, and then dced.
---
Thanks Bhvr.
---
They really hate it here when killer players get too 'uppity'.
---
FACECAMPING KILLERS AT END OF GAME BECAUSE SURVIORS GEN RUSHED! GEN RUSH IS DOING OBJECTIVE, IF SURVIVORS GEN RUSH IT'S CAUSE YOU DID A SHIT JOB PATROLLING GENS!!! Seriously, if you have to face camp to rank up, you need to lose. If you rank up, you'll get matched against harder survivors, if you rank down, you'll have better, and more fun matches. I'm killer main btw.
---
Not just to depip, it's seemingly getting more common for players to disconnect whenever they just don't like the killer or their loadout. 
---
I mean it is. The remade recap is all you need. ED1 isn‚Äôt a good movie honestly and you‚Äôre better off just doing ED2 cause it‚Äôs much better, tonally consistent with the series (horror comedy vs horror) and the recap opening explains everything you need to know.

&gt; an in game counter
---
Such as a perk?
---
Yeah, seriously. People DC for everything. I play Survivor and Killer pretty equally and I have literally never DCd as survivor even if I am salty as all hell. Just play the game, man.
---
3 DC'S AS MYERS TODAY. WHO THE FUCK TEABAGS MYERS THEN RAGE QUITS WHEN HE 1 HITS YOU!
---
Theres a few killers out there who camp and Twitch themselves doing it. Thats currently a personal fave now. All while slugging then telling you to get good by watching youtube after in the lobby. -_-
---
‚ÄúWatching the show he came from.‚Äù
---
He came from movies.
---
its comments like this that makes me wish they would implement a non competitive game mode. Where killers and survivors are matched based solely on ping and put into a game. Blood points are still earned for good play but you dont have the rank looming over you to make you feel bad for screwing up your teams win because you wanted to try out (insert name of off perk you have never played before) kinda like quick play in Overwatch. 
---
I'm on PC and something similar happens with every update. It'll download the update itself but for some reason reinstall the entire game completely.
---
i assumed everyone does, but i bet some haven't noticed
---
not in solo survivor games
---
&gt; Currently you don't lose any pips for DCing
---
yes you do, unless you do it by closing the application 
---
I just don't understand what problem they viewed Mettle as a solution to. It's not an anti-tunneling perk, it's not situational unless you consider "getting hit" a rare situation. It's useful for everyone, there's no reason survivors should not be running this perk right now
---
I'm assuming these people disconnect as they go down. The second killer dced because he likely wanted a 4k and was upset when he realized that wasn't happening. Unless someone was disconnected due to an issue with their internet i would at least report them.
---
Spirit herself is kinda zombie-like
---
THATS TRUE BUT I JUST DONT FIND THAT VERY FUN THATS A GOOD BUILD IDEA THOUGH
---
This is the perfect setup for at least 1 of the fog whisperers somewhere down the line to eventually get called out for rigging a tournament for their friends to get prizes. It will stir up a whole controversy
---
I think one of the unintended consequences of nerfing survivors a lot is that they made a lot of people better at the game. I haven't brought self care into matches for a while now and I think I'm better at the game for having done it. Nerfing self care has just made me better at looping, and made me do gens faster. No more 30~ seconds wasted sitting in a corner healing myself.
---
My opinion is if you're a survivor and you're not running Mettle of Man, you're handicapping yourself and your teammates. It's that good. You can mitigate it's downside by just 99%'ing your heal. There's no reason not to run this perk right now. Take from that what you will. 
---
Watch Evil Dead 2. It fills you in on everything you need for the show.
---
Nah it was all on purpose 
---
In my piggie endeavours i have only popped one person ever. 
---
WHY DO PEOPLE TAKE YOU OFF THE HOOK WITH THE KILLER STANDING BESIDE YOU? IVE ONLY BEEN PLAYING FOR A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AND THIS SHIT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I WISH THERE WAS A BUTTON TO DENY THE UNHOOK. IT DOESN‚ÄôT SEEM LIKE A GOOD STRATEGY FOR THREE SURVIVERS TO STOP GENS AND BUM RUSH YOU THE SECOND YOU GET HOOKED. IM NEW SO WHAT DO I KNOW. 
---
&gt;yes you do, unless you do it by closing the application
---
No you don't. I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't checked before.
---
It says that you lost your pips right after the match ended but if you restart your game, your pips are back. 
---
Also, closing the app after the match started never prevented you from losing pips, only your items. 
---
Both, it‚Äôs a group of 4 teenagers. Frank, Joey, Julie and Susie.
---
of course not, I AM A MAN
---
That's the same part to me. A lot of people ate quibbling about him not having a boomstick when I highly doubt they are even as old as the first Evil Dead film.
---
It‚Äôs really not all you need. It‚Äôs 7 minutes that summarize a 90-minute movie. It‚Äôs all you need to understand the events of EDII because in 1987 a lot of people didn‚Äôt have the means to see the first movie but in 2019 you can watch it.
---
And again, without getting into spoilers, you need to see it if you want to understand something that happens in AvED. 
---
My issue is everyone complaining about it. It‚Äôs a perk that delays the game slightly and at worst loses you a kill unless you‚Äôre running NOED. Survivors usually get decent perks at best, and we finally got a good one after three chapters of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. 
---
Maybe i‚Äôm just dumb, but explain üòÇ
---
How are guessing games not mindgames?
---
It's less about chill and more about people not knowing what the fuck they're talking about.
---
Ash looks like someone from Toy Story.  Couldn't help staring at other player's Ash characters in game lobbies. &gt;&lt;
---
SURVIVOR MAIN HERE. SURVIVORS ARE NEVER FUCKING HAPPY EVEN WHEN ALL 4 ESCAPE.  ONE DWIGHT THOUGHT I DIDN'T PLAY EXACTLY HOW HE WOULD THEREFORE BAD. FUCK YOU DWIGHT. 
---
I'M ALSO TIRED OF THESE SWEATY HILLBILLIES WITH BBQ AND TINKERER.  DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE AS GOOD WITHOUT THOSE PERKS??!! WELL...DO YOU?!!!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not playing dead by daylight. I‚Äôll play D2 or COD
---
True, but said people can't get butt hurt when that obscure reference is explained to them either.
---
Of all the killers... I feel like Tapp should be able to beat up a teenage girl.. Just saying. Lol.. Cool Pic though. 
---
Diversion creates scratch marks wherever it lands.
---
Don‚Äôt you think that it slowing down the game is a problem?
---
Out of ~20 attempts where the killer was standing in front of the locker, I managed to stun them ONCE!! Even if they are standing directly in front of the locker, they can simply walk backwards the moment it is opened and be safe, because the stun occurs at the end of animation (I think it was the end ... can't quite remember)
---
I use deliverance to work towards the achievement. If I have deliverance I absolutely do not want a teammate to unhook me.
---
respect! HAHA
---
go look at the whisperers and find me the one with a mixer account, there are no console fog whisperers.
---
&gt; Everyone said that about DS and yet I did just fine without it. 
---
And they were right back then, too. As good of a player as you were without DS, and I'm sure you're very good, you would have been more effective with it. That's not the same thing as saying that you need need DS or MoM to win a match. 
---
&gt;But I wouldn't worry too much. Killers are in full swing crying about the one good perk survivors have gotten for the last 3 chapter releases, so it'll be nerfed out of relevancy soon enough.
---
Yeah I wonder if they'll be disconnected en masse to send a message, like survivors are doing with Legion. 
---
Good perks will definitely help.
---
Don't rely on NOED. I literally stopped running this perk because it was affecting my mentality.  I didn't care how the match went most of the time because my mentality was "-I have NOED it's okay"
---
Unfortunately if it's a coordinate swf you'll probably feel overwhelmed and discouraged no matter what. The simple fact they have comms give them a HUGE advantage so try not to mentally phyce yourself if this happens.
---
Move from one game to the next and set goals "I want at least one sacrifice" per game is a good way to start
---
Know when to hook camp. Remeber the more times each individual is on a hook is them closer to death
---
4 gens left and one on a hook? You don't need to linger.  Your main objective is to give yourself as much time as possible and by hanging around the hook you're only giving them more time to complete gens
---
If they're saving a guy and healing them that's like a minute they aren't doing gens.  A minute for you to get another on a hook
---
Slap those gens  regression is always progression
---
Goodluck. 
---
You are right, there are a lot of perks I had second guesses about, but I am surprised you mention whispers before bamboozle or surveillance. Many people concider Whispers one of the best perks available 
---
Well the thing is that I am a VERY competitive person. So in a game like this where losing means you can't catch people and every chase is win or lose, there is no in between, I don't really have fun unless I am playing well and wining. So I feel I need to use these perks so have fun, weather I am playing for rank or not. Obviously if I'm not playing for rank I can brush things off a bit easier and deal with it but it can still ruin my time. I just want the ability to play a verity of builds and still have a chance at winning against good players. Metas have to shift for people to keep having fun. That's why games like League of legends do so well, they constantly change who is strong, what items are strong and what tactics are strong so there is always something new to play. Even if the game found perfect balance and then stopped updating it then people would stop playing because it would get stale...
---
It's 5 euro , not 4.
---
Not Claudette because you wouldn't be able to look at her
---
Last time I checked, perks we're in the game. Those two perks aren't even fucking teachable perks you gormless crybaby.
---
You‚Äôre confusing should with would. the plot of evil dead one is not very complicated and summarized easily in evil dead two. while watching the first film is obviously encouraged it is not at all required ‚Äì versus evil dead functions by itself, watching the movies helps but everything in the show itself is explained fully you do not at all need to watch the movies especially not the first one
---
In regards to the first one, did you mori them? I'm having trouble figuring out how you got silver devout, zero chaser, and a 4K
---
But yeah I don't use Ruin so ranking up is hard for me because gatekeeper is almost always a lost cause without it
---
How did Jendenise become a fog whisperer? She's toxic af, she deranks, dc's and shit talks every killer she plays against. I thought she was on watch for dc-ing too much, I hadn't known bhvr was rewarding her for her actions
---
Either or , possibly both
---
You have some good points, and thank you for putting them so eloquently. In my opinion, it is good for 1.) making survivors gamble on whether or not to waste time clearing totems, 2.) making the end game exciting / scary for me as a survivor, and 3.) encouraging survivors to leave rather than prolonging a tortuous end game where they just. won‚Äôt. leave. 
---
I really hate seeing this idea posted. Because I love it but am fully aware of the fact that it will never work against SWF teams.
---
I'd rather Faith than Buffy. I feel Faith would fit better lore wise
---
imagine the saltiness when they are the first to be hook. 
---
The DC thumb sticks are amazing 
---
The only reason Ace is still there is this because who knows his presence inspires others to not lose hope.
---
Once the fourth Horseman of survival arrives they shall bring down the entity and save us all
---
I‚Äôm guessing those mute his music
---
&gt;For me: Boil Over, Slippery Maeat, Sole Survivor, Open Handed, Deja Vu and Technician should be in Useless.
---
I tried putting thw least amount of perks in useless, if there is a use, it deserves a place in one of the other tiers. Maybr technician should be dropped to useless, I personally don't see boil over as a useful perk either and it could arguably be placed in useless as wel. Slippery Meat is definitely gimmick tier. Combining it with up the ante gives you a ~57% chance of escaping on your own, it definitely isn't good, but that alone deserves a spot in the gimmick tier. Sole Survivor is again a gimmick perk, mainly used with object of obsession. Open Handed can be used in a SWF squad and bond to give everyone a 68 meter radius in wich survivors can see each other. It also works well on an object of obsession squad or a squat that uses keys to locate the killer. Deja Vu definitely isn't useless, it's not even gimmick. It's just handy to know wich 3 generators are closest to each other. Repair the generator in the middle of the 3 and you just increased your chances of winning by quite a bit
---
Weak != useless.
---
At least I am glad you didn't say that No Mither deserves tl be in useless cuz I would have gotten angry
---
&gt; Killers are in full swing crying about the one good perk survivors have gotten for the last 3 chapter releases, so it'll be nerfed out of relevancy soon enough.
---
because survivors think only potentially OP perks are good perks. survivors have recently gotten some solid perks, like I run Poised and Deliverance and get a lot of success with them. Breakdown is great in certain builds. Aftercare is fantastic aura reading perk and I like to run it when I get it at tier 3
---
The reason that killers are worried about this perk (and I'm not sure yet if it will be an issue, too new, but it's clearly very strong) is that the capability of 4 of one perk appearing in a match can increase the strength of that one perk by orders of magnitude past it's baseline strength. 4 free hits and re-started chases in a match could very well be a big balance problem.
---
That's just the reality. Survivor perks have to generally be on the weaker side because there are 4 survivor load-outs in each match. That has to be considered for perk balance
---
&gt;I haven't encountered more than 1 in a match so far and people seem to not be interested in running it for some reason, so I can't really speak to it much yet. 
---
Paid DLC is my guess, there's at least one in my matches and it's only been out a day or two. Hopefully they'll keep it out of the shrine for a while. 
---
How would the game know if you hit the leave game button or wifi goes out or someone pulled the plug?

I mean... BHVR did great work with the look of the puppet, but they could've put some work into adjusting the physics when holding an item, repairing a gen or the Clown's mori...
---
Monitor and Abuse is a perk. It reduces terror radius when not in a chase by 8m. Tier 1 Myers has a default terror radius of 6m so when he's running Monitor and Abuse, you end up with 0 terror radius and no clue where he is until he tiers up...as in the instance of my clip.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Monitor_%26_Abuse
---
I believe you are right which is why I'm confused. It looks like each person was one hooked, but not until really late in the game, then moried. And yeah no duh you down pip if you do that lol
---
Darn I hate when that happens
---
I mean if someone actively chooses to pause the game and presses ‚Äúleave‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be possible for the devs to implement something to track that if there isn‚Äôt something already
---
There‚Äôs so many fucking perks and variables to this game, I really wasn‚Äôt expecting this. Not necessarily a good or bad thing, it just surprises me that there‚Äôs a lot under the surface.
---
I did not mori them and also I can see why you think the 2nd story is unlikely because I don't have a screenshot of it but that is ok. I am pretty sure you can try it yourself in a kyf if you wanna take the time to do that.
---
It took 8 hours to edit the video. Did I manage to emulate No0b3's style? Or did I just failed miserably?  
---
In any case, thanks for spending your time to check out the video :)
---
It doesn't, but none of them bled out.
---
"But not every survivor will run it so its not overpowered" - survivors that liked old decisive
---
Knowing exactly which gen to go to after a hook is pretty useful
---
Did you turn off the router and turn it back on again?
---
Borrowed time, mettle of man, Dead hard, then decisive
---
Pft that wouldn't happen if it was [Joey](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/957486443993517475/4AE0E27846FD765492C91AA9E5AE4D56DD78758F/).
---
Many things counter it, like staying in lockers or hiding in gen auras, distortion isnt even necessary
---
But but why not???
---
&gt; I haven't unlocked it yet but I'm definitely going to use it.
---
I've been using it just because I enjoy running the unique perks upon release, but I don't like passive perks so I'll probably just use it on occasions I feel like switching things up
---
And? For years they've used perks that killers dont want to go againsf, and lets not forget the thousands of coldwind offerings.
---
Never mind you‚Äôre talking about Baal lol. Thought you were talking about the post 
---
I heard decisive got a little buff, so I would put it in average now. The reason for it being in gimmick was more for it being pretty situational with a small payoff. It is still equally situational but at least the payoff is worth it. The gimmick was a self-unhook build or an end game build with borrowed time, where you could save the person on hook and yourself without risking death. The only time I got any real use out of decisive strike after it's nerf was the end game
---
&gt;As it stands now, leaving a game will cost you 2 pips, which is a system people abuse to purposely derank themselves for whatever reason.
---
Currently you don't even lose pips for hitting "leave game". It says in the scoreboard but if you restart the game, your pips are back.
---
Not sure if this is a bug or something they did to prevent derankers. 
---
But now if no auras appear they might just be hiding like i said in the other comment, and you will camp with no one near
---
If you mean me in particular, I empathize with both sides. While I do admit I have a survivor bias first and foremost, I have played a lot of Killer, especially in this "era" where survivor is ungodly boring.
---
That being said, it's easy for me to empathize with Survivors, as I have faced things like Iri Heads and Legions that kill any fun you could have had. The fact is, a solo Survivor is powerless against these kinds of things. SwF is different and I won't argue with you. I had a survivor run the Ironworks window on me, and you know what I did? Once I caught him, I camped him. I humored their shittalk in the post game, and went on with my day. If you piss a Killer off, barring them being terrible, they will punish you eventually. You can't do that as a solo Survivor, so your two options are to take it in the ass or DC. Why not DC in a non-competitive match that is more likely to ruin your will to play than not?
---
I'd like to add that I don't support people dc'ing because a Killer or Survivor is "too good" for them. That's some pussy shit.
---
Is your cat's name Ash?
---
I recommend the 'Murica shirt.
---
Wait  17?? I actually never looked it up...
---
How old were Annie and Lynda then? Same age?
---
I don't exactly think I play him THAT much but he's second most played killer for me behind Michael. I think his flaw is just that he can't down people fast enough unless you do the look down toxic strat. I mainly use him to farm bloodpoints (those multi-hit bloodpoints are yummy) because fighting against a Legion is easily a 15+ minutes game. Any good survivor can loop the living shit out of Legions that want to down you (cause let's be real, 4 hits to down a survivor is a damn long time wasted)
---
I don't want to call you a liar (as this can easily be the games fault), but a 4k is an automatic gold. I'm not sure if you did this as a test or because you think you should get more pips but the emblem system is designed for intense long, close games. Obliterating a team, slugging 3 guys who are stupid and then chasing the last shouldn't give pips. It kills your bp and your emblems. The emblems want you to get multiple hooks and multiple chases. It's not smart to kill every one on their first hook
---
**It's the circle** **of** *a asymmetrical multiplayer game's development* **life**...
---
Why play dbd when you have minecraft :') 
---
He said "That's me" for me. Scared the shit out of me
---
I'm still mad that we didn't get a "teleporting" killer with Legion. The killer player goes into a locker, whistles or something for a map-wide callout, and a different Legion model comes out of another locker somewhere else on the map. Would have been so fuckin cool
---
Survivors get weaker perks because they're meant to be the weaker side Mr (semi-immersed claudette). That's how balance works.
---
Look at make your choice. Strong but only affects 1 survivor at a time.
---
Now look at MoM or old DS, can be used across 4 survivors. That's when it becomes an issue and that's why survivors perks aren't meant to be OP tier.
---
Now Im not going to deny that killers have a lot of bullshit things that need a nerf. Moros, iri heads, noed etc. However its bevause of salty survivor mains like you that think each survivor should be able to 1 vs 1 the killer that broken shit keeps getting added.
---
Its a 4 vs 1. If all 4 survivors eere able to go toe to toe with the killer then how the fuck would the killer be able to win?
---
When you get some more hours of playtime you'll start to see the "meta" builds for most killers. (Go-To setups) Most have wiggle room for 1 random perk that they want to play, but for the most part there's a pretty set standard 3ish perks if they are looking to 4K. (Kill all 4 players)
---
DBD is a simple game on the surface, but does get complex and requires a lot of playtime to really dig deep. Youtube videos also help if you're wanting to learn more about a specific aspect, like how to loop effectively and which killers you can/cannot loop and why.
---
Damn, I had this in mind when I bought Ash. Too bad, I chose to spend blood points on Jane. Gotta get that thicc action
---
I play quite a bit of legion (ikr crucify me) at rank 1 and I don‚Äôt tunnel. It is possible to get a 4K without tunneling, I do it all the time. Either way I try to be the least toxic I can be by not running OP addons or perks or use BS strategies, and yet people still hate me for playing the character. Oh well, can‚Äôt please everyone, especially with legion. 
---
Ok cool I‚Äôm already following a streamer and I‚Äôll definitely need to watch more helpful videos because yeah, this game seems simple but it‚Äôs a lot more than what you‚Äôd imagine. Thanks.
---
Come on, gang! Let's split up and look for Ruin.
---
its strong against weak killers and useless against good killers, good job
---
What I thought. I know him from the original trilogy, and more recently, Sam Axe in Burn Notice (he's great in that). And I always smile at his cameo at the end of Darkman. Not see  the series yet :/
---
It is indeed. I'm a console player, planning to move to pc where I'm going to have to get the killers and some survivors again and my god, I have a long grind ahead of me 
---
I‚Äôve played him a ton, and the only way I lose Survivors is by chain hitting, so that previously hit survivors just have to mend and keep going on their merry way, or the survivor that I‚Äôm chasing manages to lose me. Sometimes maps are dark and some survivors are good at hiding so without scratch marks, it becomes harder to track them. Survivors are pretty much dead out in the open, but sometimes survivors manage to shake me off. Doesn‚Äôt happen often, but good survivors can make it happen. God forbid if Legion were able to see scratch marks while in Frenzy, it‚Äôd be impossible to lose them. There‚Äôs bloodhound, but still. 
---
A well timed pallet stun can work but baiting pallet drops is easy and I can just yeet over them and slap them as punishment. Lots of survivors try to juke vaults but that‚Äôs the first thing I look for, then they get smacked for being bad. There‚Äôs very little survivors can do, but hiding is the most viable thing to do really, other than just hoping that the Legion player is trash or tries to chain hit too frequently for their own good. 
---
Don't listen to this guy. Definitely don't skip the original 
---
I do that, or play on my phone LOL 
---
IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN I GET MESSAGES FROM ANYONE IN THIS GAME AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE HELPFUL OR WHOLESOME. IDK I FEEL LIKE THIS SUB HAS TRAINED ME TO EXPECT SALT FROM DBD PLAYERS
---
What is your survivor / killer build?
---
Ooooh shit, borrowed time hits count toward Mettle of Man! Hadn‚Äôt even considered that. That‚Äôs cool. 
---
[WHERE IS MY PLAGUE DOCTOR??????](/intensifies)
---
ALSO, FUCK METTLE OF MAN, THAT PERK HAS EASILY KILLED MY INTEREST IN PLAYING MY MAIN KILLERS DOC AND FREDDY.  WHY IN THE ABSOLUTE NAME OF THE ENTITY DID THEY DECIDE TO MAKE A PERK THAT SHITS ON THE ALREADY NOT CHASE-STRONG KILLERS?  FOR MORE BS IT WAKES YOU UP AGAINST FREDDY.  [WHY DOES METTLE OF MAN WAKE YOU UP VS FREDDY!?](/intensifies)
---
It's because she is a grill with lots of kids watching.
---
IF I ONLY FUCKING SEE YOU IT ISNT TUNNELING YOU SPUNK BUCKET! DON'T GET SHITTY WITH ME BECAUSE YOUR TEAMMATES HIDE WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING IN THE OPEN !!
---
LUL
---
I wouldn't recommend that, I dont think it's going well for the survivors lol No one cares about their message.
---
And idk, for me single use perks aren't worth it. DS didnt have a downside besides missing the skill check so I understood the hate. This new one seems to have a much greater risk, which is certainly not for me.
---
ONLY TWO ASHES I'VE GONE AGAINST AS KILLER WERE TOXIC + USED NONE OF HIS PERKS ONLY THE USUAL SB ADRENALINE SELF CARE ETC 
---
BUT I MORIED ONE WHICH WAS NICE
---
ALSO COULD ANYONE TRY PLAYING THE WRAITH IN A NON-BASIC BITCH WAY I.E. STANDING CLOAKED BY THE HOOK, IT'S NICE WHEN THAT DOES HAPPEN 1 OUT OF EVERY 100 WRAITH GAMES
---
Do you have a surviver one?  
---
Okay that makes way more sense now.
---
Same reason they flew angry pug to their HQ I guess :/
---
I feel your pain :(
---
Your can‚Äôt dribble a DS anymore so not sure what you are talking about 
---
I think we've got at least one or two sets of cosmetics available for him considering the pax screenshots. 
---
So long, farewell!
---
I think it's really only truly useful on large maps with harder to control generators. My couple main killers I play don't even have it on them. Bitter Murmur is a much better aura perk
---
Any strat that requires an insta-heal AND being tunneled is not valid to bitch over. 
---
Although there is heavy truth in this that many people rate BBQ highly causes its a handy perk for BP gains, it does provide an interesting effect.
---
When it procs it can tell a killer what gens are being worked on the most &amp; highlight which gen is likely to be repaired next. That allows the killer to walk to the gen to either disrupt the survivors from fixing then gen or allow the killer to walk near the gen to run into the survivors after they finish the gen. 
---
It's a very effective map awareness perk that grants you the ability to see survivor hot spots &amp; allows you to gauge which area to patrol next. It is also a good gauge on how many survivors are close to the hook. 
---
Overall a great perk for peeling you off the hook &amp; giving you an incentive to place pressure on survivors away from the hook.
---
It's mainly effective for fast killers though like hillbilly or nurse. Other killers don't get as much of a benefit. I like it with Freddy though as it highlights the auras of survivors who are not asleep.
---
Using a locker to counter its ability is relatively unused &amp; forces the survivor to not do anything while you are carrying a survivor to the hook. 
---
Hiding behind gen auras can be unreliable but effective. If there is more than one person working on gen then you get to see at least a single survivor.
---
Needs more "A Nightmare on My Street" by DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince for frustrating Freddy matches. :)
---
So basically you'll get punished even more for leaving during a mori/mori spam or if you run into a toxic killer who slugs you till you bleed out rather than losing a bit of your rank &amp; saving time.
---
 I think Bloodpoint reductions for constant leaving would be a better solution. 
---
And that wastes way more time. I doubt the devs would go as far as to track how someone leaves. If you dc or purposely leave it‚Äôs one in the same. If you have awful connection and disconnect often then in reality it‚Äôs no different than someone who leaves on purpose from your teammates perspective. People who leave or dc often should have to play with people who leave or dc often.
---
Also it should have a reputation type of system. Not like 1 disconnection suddenly puts you into leaver lobbies. Dc‚Äôing just decreases your rep. 
---
Yes, you got no points in 2 categories. If you really wanted to, you could run in front of the killer back and forth to get boldness/evader points and depending on your rank that should be enough for safety or 1 pip.
---
At least since the emblem introduction it's always been this way. You have to usually do 3/4 of the following to consistently pip: gens/gate, helping others, surviving, getting chased. (All 4 things if you want a double pip)
---
this is why I at least detest tunneling and camping killers because they actively destroy the pipping system for ALL 5 players most of the time. You deny 1 player out of 3 categories of points, make the other 3 only get 2 categories of points at best, and you yourself destroy at least 2 categories but will most likely fall short in all 4 categories. And thats the BEST survivor outcome of the match of them playing optimally.
---
OH GOD IT'S FINALLY UP, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER CHANCE TO SHIT ON THE NEW EMBLEM AND PIP SYSTEM.
---
WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE CHANGED INSTEAD OF INTRODUCED MR ASH I DON'T CARE BECAUSE I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AND NOT GET STUCK IN THE SAME RANK FOR 12 YEARS. SERIOUSLY, THIS EMBLEM BUSINESS IS STILL BULLSHIT AS HELL.
---
THE GATEKEEPER EMBLEM IS NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WAS, BUT IF YOU STILL DON'T HAVE RUIN YOU AREN'T GETTING BEYOND A SILVER. AT LEAST WHEN YOU HAVE IT YOU MIGHT GET A GOLD. IRIDESCENTS NEVER UNLESS SURVIVORS ARE POTATO AS HELL.
---
THE DEVOUT EMBLEM AHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA I HATE THIS STUPID EMBLEM SO MUCH. SO MUCH OF THIS EMBLEM IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON SURVIVOR BEHAVIOR. YOU NEED LIKE WHAT, 8 OR 9 HOOKS TO GET AN IRIDESCENT AS WELL AS KILL ALL THE SURVIVORS? WHAT'S THAT? SURVIVORS FUCK UP BADLY EARLY IN THE GAME AND YOU HOOK THREE OF THEM EARLY ON AND MANAGE TO CHASE DOWN THE LAST GUY SO HE CAN'T UNHOOK? NO IRIDESCENT FOR YOU. MAYBE NOT EVEN A GOLD, AND IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT THE SURVIVORS WERE POTATOES. WHAT'S THAT? A SURVIVOR SUICIDED ON THE HOOK? NO IRIDESCENT. WHAT'S THAT? A SURVIVOR TRIED TO 35% AND FAILED AND IS IN SECOND STATE? GOOD LUCK GETTING THAT IRIDESCENT OFF OTHER SURVIVORS. WHAT'S THAT? THEY WERE NEVER UNHOOKED, EVER? GOOD LUCK. IT'S SUCH A STUPID REQUIREMENT MAKING MINIMUM HOOKS A THING, WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT OF THIS? DID THEY EVEN PLAY THE GAME AGAINST NORMAL SURVIVORS???
---
BRUTALITY IS STILL THE SAME, SO I CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. I STILL HATE IT THOUGH, I CAN NEVER GET AN IRI ON IT REEEE.
---
BUT THE LAST EMBLEM, CHASER, OHOHOHO GOD THIS THING IS ANNOYING. THE ONLY THING THEY REALLY CHANGED WAS HOOK PROXIMITY TAKING AWAY 1%, BUT MY BEEF IS BEYOND THAT. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SHIT ON THIS GODDAMN EMBLEM FOR A WHILE NOW. NOW ON PAPER IT MAKES SENSE- WIN CHASES, WIN POINTS. LOSE CHASES, LOSE POINTS. BE TOO CLOSE TO A GUY ON A HOOK? LOSE POINTS FOR CAMPING. BUT IN EXECUTION MY GOD IS IT HEAVILY SKEWED IN FAVOR OF FEW KILLERS AND AGAINST THE OTHER FEW. YOUR KILLER IS GOOD AT CHASING, LIKE SAY THE SPIRIT? YOU'LL GET AN IRI EVERY GAME GUARANTEED. YOUR KILLER IS BAD AT CHASING, OR OFTEN HAS TO QUIT CHASES BECAUSE IT'S BAD FOR THEM LIKE THE TRAPPER? SILVER. EVERY. FUCKING. GAME. GOD THIS EMBLEM IS SO STUPID. SOMETIMES YOU LOSE A CHASE, AND IMMEDIATELY FIND SOMEONE HIDING AND HIT THEM. NO CHASE POINTS. IT'S STUPID FOR PEOPLE WHO NEVER INITIATE CHASES BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE SURVIVORS DON'T ALL RUN AWAY WITH SPRINT BURST.
---
ALSO I HATE SPRINT BURST.
---
THESE EMBLEMS ARE AWFUL, BUT FUCK WOULD THEY AT LEAST BE MANAGEABLE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE PIPPING CHANGES. IT'S SO IMPOSSIBLE TO PIP THESE DAYS, AND I'M IN THE GREEN RANKS WHERE IT'S ONLY SLIGHTLY CHANGED. I KEEP SAFETY PIPPING EVERY MATCH EVEN WHEN I GET THREE KILLS AND HAVE GENS LEFTOVER. WHO DESIGNED THIS? I GET YOU HAVE TO PLAY "EXCEPTIONALLY WELL" FOR THE OTHER CATEGORIES AS WELL, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THEY ALREADY PUNISHED CAMPERS... SO WHY ARE THE REST OF US BEING PUNISHED FOR THE BAD BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS? WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO LET PEOPLE LEAD ME OUT OF MY TRAPPED AREA AS TRAPPER SO I DON'T GET SILVER CHASER? WHY DO I HAVE TO PLAY SPIRIT EVERY GAME IF I WANT TO FUCKING PIP?
---
WHOEVER DESIGNED THESE EMBLEMS AND PIPPING SYSTEM ONLY THINKS ON PAPER AND THINKS PEOPLE PLAY PERFECTLY AND INTELLIGENTLY EVERY GAME. PLEASE, THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT BOTH KILLER AND SURVIVORS ARE HUMAN PLAYERS AND THEY OFTEN PLAY LIKE IDIOTS. PERFECT PLAY SHOULD ONLY HAPPEN IN RED RANKS, NOT GREEN RANKS.
---
END RANT.

---
Ehh, not really. The current strat is to 99% the health bar and tap it when a chase is imminent. When that information is worthless to the killer
---
I bought the plague and regret it. Unfun all around, needlessly gross üò∑
---
Just gen rush. He's slow and shit without his add-ons.
---
I agree with the balance of the game the one thing that needs to be changed is the dc problem
---
Only Fog Whisperers becaus eit's beta. So if they want, they can establish passowords. You can join Panda's tournament, he let us now the password. Don't be so salty, please...
---
OMG back when the game was new and spine chill was meta I remember moonwalking to gens while cloaked as Wraith. It never did work out very well though... probably because I walked directly out in the open or smacked into trees the whole way back
---
In my opinion, there are better things to make endgame more scary, though it's partially due to it being kind of bad (as in quality). Things like blood warden and remember me can make endgame equally as dreadful without having to rely on a one-hit. 
---
Also, wouldn't you want the other survivors to not leave so you can exploit their altruism?
---
I just don't like noed being used by people who will go on to act like they're so great at the game when they're standing atop a one-hit kill that you didn't work for. The thing is, you can usually tell if a killer has noed based on how well they play, but that's just my experience.
---
METTLE IS GOING TO BE REALLY CLUTCH AND I'M GOING TO REALLY HATE THAT PERK SO MUCH. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SPREADS ONTO OTHER SURVIVORS AS A META PERK.
---
I pretty much play every killer and depending on the addons and killer and also the perks available to me, I pick different perks. My favorite killer build usually concists of Devour Hope, Ruin, Thrill Of The Hunt and 3th perk depends on killer, but I guess barbecue and chili is the perk I'd pick most often.
---
Specific builds I like include:
---
Spirit: The totem build mentioned above with prayer beads and father's glasses
---
Hag: The totem build, but make your choice instead of Barbecue. Addons: Mint Rag and Cracked Turtle Egg
---
Trapper: build mentioned above with Iridescent Stone and Bloody Coil
---
Myers: play with your food, monitor and abuse, ruin and Bamboozle. Addons: tombstone and turf of hair
---
As for survivor, these are some of my favorite builds:
---
No Mither, Tenacity, Dead Hard and Decisive Strike
---
Slippery Meat, Up The Ante, Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time (I would pick breakdown if I had the perk instead of borrowed time)
---
Plunderer's Instinct, Ace In The Hole, Selfcare/Iron Will and Small Game/Exhaustion perk
---
I love it honestly it looks amazing him holding a map or flashlight lol
---
This is actually grand and I've been waiting for something like this this whole time. Can you make more?
---
I didn‚Äôt get angry or annoyed when reading this. I actually quite enjoyed this and felt you may have had a cathartic moment.  
---
While I pretty much despise campers and the like, I always am intrigued and wonder what kind of person acts like that.  You seem like a good person and your toxicity is a way to keep the angst this game brings at bay. 
---
He can get looped by good survivors unlike what this sub says. Right now most players 12 and above can easily loop a Legion, while 13 and below are trash against him because they heal against him and do gens together
---
There is counterplay to Legion. What you have to do is spread out (if it's clear he has discordance) and mend but don't heal unless that Legion only uses m1. You also have to time the pallet drops when the killer is using m2 correctly to stun him out of FF. Don't try to juke vault against good Legions as they will  usually  look behind them after vaulting. If it's a bad one, do it. They'll think you went forward instead of back over the window. Don't have the last 3 gens be where he'll see your aura when he uses FF on one survivor. Have 2 gens close together and the 3rd all the way across the map.
---
Never regret just leaving a lost cause behind. Better one corpse than two. I can only shake my head at people who get upset because I'm not gonna wrestle with the camping NOED piggy to save your ass
---
&gt;the finger falls through 
---
Ash doesn't *have* fingers under that puppet
---
Yeah that's what I'm planning. I'll get bbq and ruin, probably nurse's and enduring and not get any teachable until I got ruin and bbq on all of my killers. The thing that sucks though is I'm going to have to buy all the killers again, which includes hag and doc who are free on console. On the bright side, pc will have no frame drops like console and 60 fps :) 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm super confused by this
---
Neither, It‚Äôs not your fault that they are AFK.
---
Same goes for survivors who crank out gens when a killer is AFK.
---
So no it‚Äôs not bming or abusive to take advantage of something like that.
---
It‚Äôs not abusive or bming but you can report people for being afk
---
&gt; It's too problematic when stacked, any more than two in a match and they can turn into a funhouse of fuck for the killer.
---
I've noticed that no survivors care to address this point.
---
üëèüëèüëè
---
LOOK AT MEEE, I'M LEAVING!!!!! PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEE!
---
You sound a little unstable, if you're playing a game just to doll out "punishment" then yeah, you need to take a break. 
---
It's nothing alike anything that comes later. It's not a necessary watch.
---
Ok? Just report them ingame then through Xbox live.
---
But there's a vowel at the beginning of "alone" right? 
---
It‚Äôs a situational perk and only works once so I think it‚Äôs fair. They nerfed the survivor so many times. Petrified oak no longer gets rid of hooks just makes hooks farther from each other just a bit. 
---
Proof?
---
So Thanatophobia was nerfed because killers could stack Thana with Sloppy Butcher and apparently, that combo was "so OP", but developers have no problems when survivors can stack MoM with Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and Instant Heals. Wow.  
---
When you care too much about dbd.
---
Seems like its photoshop - not a 3d model. Need better artists. 
---
Not one bit surprised 
---
I love the Bruce chin - it's why I'm so disappointed in their model. 
---
I actually run BBQ and bitter murmur. If they are far enough doing gens like they need to be I can see which ones with BBQ (when I hook of course). And, if they happen to do a gen close enough to me where they are out of BBQ, bitter murmur is awesomeeee. I once caught a Jake that had just done a gen relatively close to me, sneak around for a second, then jump in a locker. Saw the whole thing with Murmur. You can guess the rest lol
---
wtf
---
NOED only works once too. 
---
I heard they come out every Wednesday but last wed we didn't get the new collection. 
---
This is also against this subreddits rules. You should censor all the names and not create a witch-hunt.
---
I managed to down someone I figured had Head On by swinging at the locker I thought they were in instead of trying to open it. They jumped out into my swing, getting downed, right as I got stunned.
---
I'm not sure if that's intended or not, but the perk is definitely very much a risk v. reward scenario.
---
This 
---
A lot of the time, when facing a good squad (more than likely SWF, given the co-ordination involved), when they don‚Äôt leave, it‚Äôs to bully and harass, not for altruism. 
---
Agreed, hopefully the dedicated servers will fix that problem. 
---
The situation that activates it is "getting hit". That really stretches the meaning of the term. 
---
&gt;They nerfed the survivor so many times.
---
Is that an acknowledgement that it's OP, as in, survivors 'deserve' a busted perk because you feel they're disadvantaged right now? 
---
I managed to down someone I figured had Head On by swinging at the locker I thought they were in instead of trying to open it. They jumped out into my swing, getting downed before I got stunned.
---
I'm not sure if that's intended or not, but the perk is definitely very buggy AND a risk v. reward scenario.
---
I always thought it was kind of bogus that you should leave if a killer is farming. I just finish the gens and go, ingnore the killer as much as possible and if they hook you, so be it. At least you don't loose 2 pips
---
&gt; Petrified oak no longer gets rid of hooks just makes hooks farther from each other just a bit. 
---
This is an odd thing to complain about, especially since devs spaced out the hooks several patches ago
---
&gt; It‚Äôs a situational perk
---
Hardly. You just have to get hit 3 times. Something that almost always happens is no situational 
---
&gt; and only works once so I think it‚Äôs fair
---
If you play killer it can work up to 4 times
---
&gt; They nerfed the survivor so many times
---
Yeah, they balanced the game from how broken it was. You can't just complain about nerfs/buffs happening. That's meaningless without the proper context.
---
The entity: Here‚Äôs one on me. 
---
I agree. I'm running deliverance strictly for the achievement of jumping off the hook 50 times, and if I'm first to get hooked that match was wasted for me because I'm a killer main and I'm trying to get all killers p3 level 50 and survivor gives way less bp. I wont dc, but I will be salty.
---
&gt; But it has a ton of drawbacks. You pretty much have to have a med or self care in order to 99% the heal.
---
That isn't a draw back at all, it takes literally 1/10th of a second to to finish the heal. People keep focusing on the "one time use" aspect of the perk, ignoring that it isn't a 1 vs 1 game. Every survivor benefits from even a single MoM active in the match because it buys everyone more time for productivity....and there's no downside to bringing four of them into a match. The only reason it wouldn't be useful is because you didn't get downed, in which case you didn't need it because you presumably escaped. 
---
True but they have ruin and they body block and get knocked down to tell the killer where u are
---
Whats worse is the killer taking you next to the hatch to mori you 
---
They're disputing your "only works once thing"
---
It has multiple downsides. Beyond the aura reveal it is quite situational. Against many Killers its effect can be bypassed, it is useless against NOED, it is basically useless in the early game, etc
---
Must be something wrong with people if they are downvoting this idea. 
---
That doesn't excuse her actions
---
#Eatourasses
---
I‚Äôll give you that. I didn‚Äôt even realize there was an achievement for Deliverance until I made this post, so now I have a better understanding why people would get salty while running the perk
---
Jesus that's disgusting
---
I'VE GOTTEN HATE MAIL FROM PEOPLE FOR NOT SAVING THEM WHILE THE KILLER WAS HARD CAMPING THE HOOK. YOU'LL GET ALL KINDS OF BULLSHIT FROM BOTH SIDES.
---
actually pug really isn't that bad, anyone who has the balls to consistently play solo survivor earns some respect from me.
---
That and his take on the deranking podcast that hexy hosted was the only one I respected "I care about my fun and that's it, fuck anyone else's fun that comes second"
---
WELL ITS SUPPOSE TO STOP PEOPLE FROM CAMPING AND PENALIZE THEM AND EVENTUALLY MOVE THEM BACK TO THE LOWER RANKS INSTEAD OF BEING A RANK 4 WHO CAMPED HIS WAY TO THE TOP! BUT I GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND MOST SCUMBAG CAMPING KILLERS WILL KEEP DOING WHAT THEY DOING AND EVENTUALLY WE PEOPLE IN THE HIGHER RANKS WONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM ANYMORE, FEEL BAD FOR THE NEW PEOPLE THOUGH. 
---
actually it does, specifically for their tournaments and not for the "challenges" the platform actually matters
---
Just remember that the challenges and tournaments are seperate things.
---
If they ever do, they should add season 3 Clem or Kenny as a survivor and a turned Lee as a killer.
---
1) The aura reveal can be completely mitigated by 99%ing the heal. In fact that makes it incredibly useful in combination with Dead Hard.  
---
2) 'Getting downed' isn't situational, it's routine. The only reason you wouldn't get any benefit from it is if you escaped. 
---
&gt; quite situational
---
man, it's crazy how many of you are pushing this. No, it is not "quite situational." In what world is being hit 3 times situational at all?
---
&gt; Against many Killers its effect can be bypassed
---
Like 3 of them. 
---
&gt; it is useless against NOED
---
You're unlikely to have the perk activated at that point in the game anyway, so irrelevant for starters. And the perk saves you from going into the dying state from injured state so I don't know why you expect it to be a NOED counter anyway
---
Legend has it if you talk shit about JD on reddit, some guy named DamnNoHtml shows up to give you a hard time about it.
---
That gatekeeping tho
---
Rank Ds higher and I would say head on isn't really a gimmick perk as much because it's useful in the basement and stuff,  also breakdown isn't very strong. I think balanced landing is good but very overrated compared to lithe which is much better. I don't even find it opinion but I know many will disagree, also I use balanced myself so I know what I'm talking about
---
You just opened up a can of Instant Ban, boah.
---
I wasn‚Äôt complaining I just made a statement about recent survivor nerfs including DS. Petrified oak was a good offering if you‚Äôre running a sabo build. Now with hooks spaced out it‚Äôs useless since there will always be the same amount of hooks in each map. A killer doesn‚Äôt even have to run agitation or iron grasp to make it to a hook. Just saying it‚Äôs nice to see a nice little buff for survivor. 
---
You have to find your own style of editing if you want to be successful someday
---
Why are you ranking perks if you don't know what they all do? 
---
No, DS had a downside with Rancor. 
---
Yeah the frames are so bad. On farm maps you can enter corn and get -11 fps it's insane, and thanks for the tip! 
---
&gt;  ignoring that it isn't a 1 vs 1 game.
---
I've kind of accepted that a lot of people don't give a shit about this and will never acknowledge that game balance has to be done around this fact
---
This fuqin community lol
---
But rank means you are OBVIOUSLY so ~~optimal~~ good in the game! /s
---
I am NOT letting the killer see my aura all game.
---
I am apart of the 80% of people who can't outrun killers, so that perk is worthless to me
---
I mean, some people have been making good points with the amount of context I gave, but yeah haha.
---
They're all on shudder I believe. It's a streaming service dedicated to horror movies. It's 5 bucks per month and definitely worth it if you love horror. 
---
You doubters and your tin foil hat conspiracy theories
---
The game is a 4v1 for the objective but segmented into various 1v1‚Äôs during chases. I play Killer and anyone who plays killer knows we focus and target. Saying the game is 4v1 is true on paper but ignores the way the game is actually played. The game is decided on the ability of players (both killer and survivor) to 1v1.
---
You forgot to add that he got borrowed time aswell 
---
But wait, what? What are you playing DBD on? Why are you here on reddit and not out improving? Questions. So many questions. Anyway, take care of yourself
---
Then we'll derank even further after rank reset and it's gonna be awful. Revert it!!!
---
So. Are you ever?
---
&gt; Being hit is not within your control.
---
^ this conflicts with this:
---
&gt; The entire purpose of the game is avoiding hits.
---
being hit is within your control because there are ways to avoid taking hits
---
&gt; This perk is trackable meaning as a killer you can prepare for it to proc.
---
You can prepare for anything to proc. That has nothing to do with whether or not the perk is too strong. Also survivors don't allow this logic for killer perks like NOED so I cannot take this argument seriously from you.
---
&gt; how about dead hard
---
You can bait dead hard and still get a quick down. MoM causes the successful attack cooldown and grants the survivor a speed boost. 
---
Same goes for SB and BL. 
---
None of those perks deny a down you should have gotten and none of them set back the killer like MoM does with the weapon wipe and speed boost.
---
Fundamentally different.
---
&gt; Are you saying that a perk with one time use is worse than having each survivor potentially dead hard you 4 times each?
---
Yes, because they do totally different things
---
I think he's hyped that he won
---
Not really a reward tbh. 
---
DISCONNECT IS AN ESCAPE
---
No :(
---
Bruh thats weak. No one cares.
---
That's all fine and dandy, but that's not how it works when you actually sit down to balance the game
---
not really sure how this implies/proves baby killer... some people just have bad games
---
because of the depip i haven't face any problems before but with the new update i couldn't pass R5 cuz of the ppl DCs running away from lesion . my point is survivors should get bp bonus as the killer get's it because the game already hard for the survivors to pip up with more gens to do when some one DCs less ppl it's hard specially with the killers perks puffs .
---
I get accused of lag switching all the time because of my shit internet
---
titanfall did this back in the day where they would silently make cheaters play with other cheaters
---
now two games i play have the tryhard character named ash. nice
---
I didn't record it sadly. I wish I did though lol. It was just a normal game until the end so I didn't really think about recording it.
---
I'll see if I can pull it off again and I'll make sure to record it.
---
I wasn't under the impression bill was licensed.
---
Don't you just buy him with points? 
---
ITS THE PLAG D00D
---
Yeah they're all trying to downplay how strong it is while totally planning to run it in all their builds. They did the same thing when the DS change was accnounced.
---
They all got really angry that a perk they used in all their builds was going to be changed despite that perk totally not being very good.
---
Like, give me a break
---
It was probably posted too soon before everyone could see how strong the perk is. 
---
Is Unrelenting worth a perk slot on console?
---
He really doesn't get it does he?
---
yea when the killers DCs but not when another survivor DCs nope in the other hand they get to do a more gen with less ppl ( and that will make it easier for the killer )
---
If youre failing so much, maybe youre just not pressing it at the right moment. You have to hit space at the moment the killer is in range. If you try to use it too early it wont stun them
---
When DS was released, Rancor didn't exist. It never had a downside.
---
Rancor helps you get daily rituals without using moris, so definitely take that
---
Ran into 2 in one game and it was enough to deny me some momentum. 4 will be mental. Its just an all around overpowered perk. People who disagree probably only play survivor. 
---
I would buy that controller in a heartbeat.
---
Nah, I think they just don't care so they're being disingenuous 
---
Civ VI is so chill. There are a bunch of mods for it that make it even more relaxing and fun. I'm a slut for adjacency bonuses.
---
Someone‚Äôs acting rather angry, we both know full well I‚Äôm not talking about perks. There are only a small handful of perks who‚Äôs effects do not have some kind of counter provided to us in the base kit. 
---
Now go take your pills granny.
---
Losing one match makes someone a ‚Äúbaby killer‚Äù now? They might not have played for a while and got rusty, really bad map RNG, or it could have been someone else using their account. Or they could have been playing drunk, I do that from time to time and usually get stomped but it‚Äôs pretty fun. 
---
People always say F13 is dead but I can find games in F13 faster than I can on DBD...
---
PC btw
---
It depends on what you consider to be a mindgame, I don‚Äôt find standing still to be a mind game. If you do then cool. 
---
Check other reply.
---
If you think taking hits is within the control of survivors then I don‚Äôt think you understand the way to game work. Do you understand how dumb that sounds. Trying to avoid taking hits doesn‚Äôt mean you can control it. It‚Äôs is *IMPOSSIBLE* to control taking hits. Think. I won‚Äôt even humor the remainder of the post until you get it through your thick skull that if survivors can control getting hit than they could never lose.
---
Me or the other commenter? 
---
How many hours do you have?
---
Haha i was prepared. I wanted Ash in this game since i bought so he's instantly my new main
---
Him. I accidentally responded to you. 
---
Dead Hard and Blood Warden might be the only perks in the game that can be mitigated by doing nothing but just assuming your opponent has it, I don't see the issue. 100% of survivors running it will proc it the moment you're in lunge range, it's incredibly difficult to time it properly when they're right on your back. Just....don't lunge at them. 
---
&gt;Rank Ds higher
---
I would have ranked it higher if I realised it just got buffed
---
&gt;head on isn't really a gimmick perk as much because it's useful in the basement and stuff,
---
So... basically a gimmick perk...
---
&gt; also breakdown isn't very strong.
---
Yeah, I don't know why I put it so high. I'd put it in the gimmick tier
---
&gt;I think balanced landing is good but very overrated compared to lithe which is much better. I don't even find it opinion but I know many will disagree, also I use balanced myself so I know what I'm talking about
---
I see lithe and balanced landing as equals. Lithe has more opportunities to activate, but when in a chase, it's hard to control when it activates sometimes you'd be better off being able to hold on to it. Balanced landing on the other hand has less opportunities to activate, but when it does, it's because you chose to activate it, not because you were forced to activate it (usually). That alone wouldn't put balanced landing on the same level as lithe, but there is 1 stat that closes the gap in my opinion: no stun for falling.
---
&gt;Edit WHY IS SPRINT BURST NOT TOP TIER. It's powerful when genrushing and u can walk mid Chase and use it
---
Sprint burst does not deserve top tier. The perk hurts the user too much, actually, it hurts their teammates too much. Even with proper exhaustion management, you'll often find yourself in a situation where you either have to pop it even tough it is not necessary or you traverse the map slowly, wasting time. You need to keep in mind that if you have the exhaustion set up, you can't do things like doing gens, healing people or cleansing totems unless you want to remove your setup.
---
It just falls short of meta in my opinion. You're better off using lithe or balanced landing
---
So it was just a troll, makes sense, the sub is infested with barely pubescent teens after all.
---
Imagine what the dumbass sleevedbiker would say about this game if the DID add Tommy and Jason...

Thats a pretty negative outlook to have on a game, how could you respect that?
---
true but the other bugs ? should i start to count ? for example how long did it take them to fix the HillyBilly bug when he couldn't pass the bus door in all the maps where it has a bus ? to much time and they mostly ignore tbh :( 
---
i love this game and i have about 1500h on it but sometimes the bugs get's on the way :\\
---
No. Especially with the performance enhancement patch. 
---
Fuck that troll pig community manager. Stupid troll shit like this pisses off players while they wait in 15-20 minute lobbies only to get dodged or dced during the load in screen.
---
Ok, I was confused as zubat does run it on nurse lmao
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúI looped the killer all game‚Äù
---
WHEN THE THREAD RULES ARE GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
---
 LOWERCASE LETTERS. LOWERCASE LETTERS WILL BE MEET WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.   
---
(MET!\~)
---
What? I don't see what's wrong 
---
I've been trying to preach this when i can because it's pretty simple and people seem to have a hard time grasping this concept lol I've been on those stupid teams where a guy gets hooked and 2 get slugged. Like i'm not gonna ask the killer to ease up so he can get more points but when the game ends with 5 gens and a 1 hook death, it's pretty lame and a detriment to the killer
---
I want to play with her without using addons, I just want to use the pocket watch to practice her. Reducing the fatigue makes the practice a lot better.
---
As long as you have an addon to counter it then using other addons is fine.
---
I know I‚Äôm going to get downvoted for this, also I know you mentioned how many killers can bypass this. But the perk can easily be countered by so many killers and add ons. I don‚Äôt get why people complains so much. Remember, if one guy is looping you for 3 gens or more, maybe it‚Äôs time to move on to someone else . I know not the best tactic, but putting your ego aside and trying to win all the time might be the problem. You don‚Äôt get 4K all the time. This perk has a drawback and can be countered ‚Äî survivors have been nerfed so much. Remember the survival rates from one of their stream? 
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs in your control lol. Are you fucking dumb? The killer is faster than you. The killer missing his hits doesn‚Äôt mean you control it. I can‚Äôt believe this is an argument.
---
Yeah! I noticed that too, but wasn't sure if it was just me.
---
If it didn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre not the obsession it would say so in the description
---
You need to relax. Don‚Äôt take every comment as a complaint. You seem to be offended by anything looking at your posts. Only person complaining is you lol. Maybe get off reddit since you‚Äôve been posting rants for the past 4 hours. 
---
He‚Äôs technically not wrong. We can only control our own fun and experiences since people will trash talk us even when we are playing as nice as possible. 
---
But then if neither survivor answers, the killer gets nowhere anyway. 
---
I do that with my switch. I get hooked or I'm waiting for a long time, I just pull out Smash and get my ass kicked there. I suck at fighting games.
---
Your games only last 2 minutes?
---
Jojo as a survivor and dio as a villain would be awesome and weird as fuuck
---
T3 Mikey will fuck your day up though lol
---
Tier 2 BBQ maxes at 3 stacks, read the patch notes. Each stack is 25% though.
---
What is this again
---
They changed the perk recently. If you have tier 1 or 2 of it you won‚Äôt get four stacks now, you‚Äôll get two or three. 
---
This version of Ash comes from the show. They licensed TV Ash from Lionsgate which is the studio that owns the TV series. They didn‚Äôt get the rights from Renaissance Pictures to use Ash from the original movie, they didn‚Äôt get the rights from StudioCanal to use Ash from ED II and they didn‚Äôt get the fights from MGM and Universal to use Ash from AoD. He wearing the costumes from the TV show. The power glove is from the TV show. Value Stop is from the TV show. Ashy Slashy is from the TV show. They use the ‚ÄúAsh vs Evil Dead‚Äù title and title logo. 
---
Noed only activates once* 
---
I don‚Äôt know that works is the right word to use for the perk as it‚Äôs effect can be used repeatedly after activation. 
---
I really dont think adding one additional hit makes THAT much of a difference. Especially being as you have to GET HIT 3 times before it even activates.
---
Eh, teleportation only really showed up for the first time in the one movie we don't talk about, before that his movement was somewhat plausible.
---
I'd personally want some sort of rage mode like with Michael.
---
I have not yet actually, but i cannot wait to see.
---
All i have seen is a puppet trying to fight off a clown
---
Lmfaoooo. A goth who likes pain. You‚Äôre really telling a 25 year old that?  I‚Äôm convinced you‚Äôre still in high school or just got out by your insults. I haven‚Äôt been picked on by my weight in years because no one my age is that immature. I don‚Äôt have a vendetta against you. I told you to stop being a fucking asshole to strangers online and you continue to do it. You don‚Äôt know when to quit, do you? 
---
That's interesting, I hadn't heard that before. It makes some sense. I do feel better sometimes after camping, but not always, and that doesn't mean it isn't having other negative effects that I'm not fully processing. I'll keep that in mind.
---
What we've got here is a professional troll. Complete with a burner account and self explanatory handle

You‚Äôre straightn‚Äôt

I was about to cry out lazy, but then I saw the .5. You really leave no stone unturned. Honestly, your dedication and quality provides so much to the sub. 
---
Oh yes. In another posts comments I have 46 killer mains hunting for my address because I defended MoM.
---
Well aware of his appearance, doesn‚Äôt mean Ash didn‚Äôt come from the movies.
---
Also, its only for basic attacks.
---
So hatchets, corrupt purge, chainsaws and traps make this perk useless...
---
Because detective's hunch is pretty useless, it only shows the aura's of objects for 5 seconds within a limited radius
---
D√©j√† Vu is a decent perk since it shows the 3 generators that are closest together for 60 seconds every time a generator gets done. If you repair the middle one of the 3 generators highlighted, you spread out the generators giving you a bih advantage in the late game
---
I didn‚Äôt say you shouldn‚Äôt watch the movies. I said you didn‚Äôt need to. Not everyone has access to all the films.

I seriously stopped playing this patch. 
---
This game isn't fun for killers, and any time they're given anything, Survivors whine and piss and moan until their stuff is nerfed while being handed second chance and advantage perks repeatedly. I've played this game since it came out, and I'm done with it if this is the way it's gonna be. Call be salty, call me a whiner, whatever, survivors are entitled jackasses and I'm done with it.
---
If I wanted to watch a No0b3 style video, I'd watch No0b3. Why not try and be original and find your own style?
---
It's fun when you go against streamers. You can check out their vod after the game and see yourself play :D
---
I like seeing my cosmetics outside of the lobby, haha.
---
No idea why bhvr hadn't addressed this yet. I had two survivors in a match yesterday have this issue.  I felt bad killing them
---
save the best for last is quite good on her. stridor is NOT that great of a perk on her no matter what anyone tells you. it doesnt really help, it throws you off tbh
---
Played at least 10 games if not more while running Flip-flop, Tenacity, boil-over and unbreakable at tier 3 today. Out of those I was able to use flip flop once and was instantly downed again. Tenacity and Unbreakable easily came in handy more than Flip-Flop.  
---
 MoM isn't nearly as broken as people are shouting but decent. it can come in handy but it's hard to get it to proc some times. Certain things that should be counted, aren't and that needs to be fixed. 
---
Buckle-up isn't worth talking about. It's worthless. 
---
Overall his perks are pretty meh to me. Buy MoM in the shrine. If you like Bruce/Ash get it to play as him. Other than that, you're not missing out. 
---
You underestimate the power of an ***edgy*** teenager.
---
I would flip off every pig i go against, This is a good idea.
---
No you don‚Äôt. Watching the films is definitely suggested but it‚Äôs not required at all. If you can‚Äôt get the movies but the shows available feel free to do the show.

---
In more than one way, it is. But the point I was bringing up is that just because a perk has a one time use, doesn't mean it can't be overpowered. DS is a shining example of that.
---
I think that the Plague's ability should be slightly nerfed. It should either be less potent in a chase, or less potent outside of a chase. Her addons should not stack either, it's actual cancer to go against a plague that stacks both of the addons that increase the rate of gaining sickness. You get vomited on for 1 second, and you're instantly broken, get no speed boost, easy down for her.
---
Couldn't really put it in gimmick since it doesn't really have a build, it's just a perk that has a consistent effect that is noticable enough to not go in the "useless" tier. It's the only perk that allows you to get used hooks back.
---
&lt;3

I try to heed suggestions most of the time. So, when someone asks for a survivor variant of a meme I like, how could I say no?

Hatchet and saw, takes your head and skins you raw.

Why didn‚Äôt u hit her lol
---
Oh boy I can't wait to be stuck in a lobby on both PS4 and Switch. Sweet
---
Alternatively for the less lucky folks, a regular map with the black cord addon tracks totems, as well.
---
As well as Detective's Hunch
---
I know this video is for killers but just take the idea of what they want in a chase and play the opposite. Btw the guy who made this video is super good and one of the better killers in this game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
people always tell me to hide my traps in less obvious spaces.
---
If I run into SFW, it's way more effective to just put them in spots they have to waste the time with them rather than could potentially avoid them. Shit, it even tells me they fucked with it.
---
YOU FORGOT THE PART WHERE YOU WAIT 15 MINUTES FOR EACH LOBBY
---
For real though, the flash light is fucking useless. They just look at the sky and keep walking. 
---
that's why you are not supposed to fully sabo hooks. You 99% them and then when they approach with with a survivor in hand you just tap it and break it
---
Does it reset after hook? If not I'm having trouble seeing how.
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt take every comment as a complaint.
---
I guess we have different ideas of what a complaint is or what it means to complain. I don't see it as a strictly negative thing, which you do, it seems. All I'm saying is that you were registering a complaint.
---
&gt; You need to relax.
---
Classic last refuge of someone who can't argue their point. Nothing I said was exasperated or desperate or anything.
---
&gt; You seem to be offended by anything looking at your posts
---
oh wait, apologies. *This* is the classic last refuge of someone who can't argue their points. Crying that people are just offended.
---
&gt; Maybe get off reddit since you‚Äôve been posting rants for the past 4 hours. 
---
I guess to you small paragraphs are rants, which is telling. And I have a desk job where I don't have to be engaged all the time. Reddit is something to do in-between tasks. Sorry that offends you
---
No actually i play qnd enjoy both and i WOULD like to be able to laugh and taunt survivors thank you very much. I didn't realize killer friendlies hated opinions so much. Or is it just you that hates opinions?
---
And they will be fucked when all the killer mains stop playing too.
---
Did only 3 load in? The first guy doesn't have the disconnect symbol.
---
They would need to add both imo, I am personally a big fan of the show... not sure if I see this one happening though.
---
Because 4 survivors can use it. Along with alot of other strong perks. And no it does not reset.
---
No one?
---
Heh, alright
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
&gt; But no matter what you do a killer will hit you
---
I guess all the times I wasn't hit was like a fever dream or something
---
why does he look like ted cruz
---
*perfection*
---
It says "stay hidden" OR "win chases" in the description but seems to only count the chases.  I run a stealthy build and just escaped from a round where not only the did killer never find me (did multiple gens, unhooks, and totems, before anyone asks - didn't hide in a locker) but I never even got hit.  I know the pip system is broken but...
---
Untill you have someone saving the person on the hook who has MoM than you get punished for camping lol
---
In dbd you never really win chases. Instead what you should be doing is having the killer chase you long enough for your team mates to do generators. The killer will eventually catch you unless they lose sight of you which can be done if breaking line of sight &amp; you use urban evasion or you simply cover your tracks but its very difficult. 
---
What you want to do is to practice pallet looping. Pallet looping is the process of running around a pallet with a killer following you then dropping the pallet on them when they are at a close enough distance to lunge at you. To loop around objects always look for a pallet &amp; look at the obstacles around it. Find the obstacle that has the longest distance around it &amp; always try to keep as far from the killer as possible when running around it. 
---
You can watch high skilled players like Puppers3 or Tru3 play survivor to learn how to properly loop &amp; run around the map to keep a killer occupied but the general advice is to use windows to create more distance between you &amp; the killer &amp; to run around areas with a pallet on it. 
---
Here are some videos to help you out;
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFJeojqiTGk
---
The guy that made this video has many other videos to help you play Survivor.
---
No actually i play and enjoy both and i WOULD like to be able to laugh and taunt survivors thank you very much. I didn't realize killer friendlies hated opinions so much. Or is it just you that hates opinions?
---
Given a large pretense for when people got killed when they did, (aka when they were just finished fucking or were in the process). It was supposed to be one of those, 'deterant' social commentary pieces for the time. 
---
So I imagine the more illegal it was, the better. "Don't have premarital, under age sex OR YOU'LL BE MURDERED."
---
Basically, I bet they were all 16-17. MAYBE one or two were 18 given how school ages work but i'm pretty sure they were all in the same grade across every franchise. 
---
I think you only earn stealth points if you‚Äôre inside their terror radius and not in a chase. So sneaking around behind rocks while they‚Äôre looking for you counts. But personally, never being inside of their terror radius in the first place should count as stealth as well lol. 
---
Thanks a lot!
---
UH THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SPEED HACKS AT ALL
---
Ah. Well still its gonna destroy me at these lower levels until I get reeeeeeeally good at predicting survivor movements (killer main), but I do hope it changes things for the high rank survivors who were having a hard time. Not sure if this is better or old school DS. üôÉ
---
I had a "perfect" game the other day and that game I only did 2 gens and got hooked twice. I somehow escaped but how the fuck did the game count that as a perfect game. I legit don't understand how this new system works because it feels more broken than ever before
---
True
---
It‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs just not meta. With enough experience, people get to know almost exactly where things are located. Or at least predict where they will be. 
---
A perk like this actually helps you get to that point.

It happened exactly the opposite for me. I got meg to 40 and was gonna start on Claudette, then I looked at the shrine. 
---
Where‚Äòs Ashy? :(
---
It's not dead. I actually switched from Dbd to F13 last night since the match maker is terrible on ps4. Got into several games quickly unlike DbD. Also didn't have to send invites to my friend after every match. It was wonderful.

You have to go deeper, Object of Obsession.
---
Let them *know* you know, **assert dominance**, **show no fear** and then *disappear.*
---
I was just reciprocating the idea.
---
I found Make your Choice to be extremely useful against MoM. You might still get affected by it, but by the time you do, the surv will be on death hook most likely
---
I posted about that exact build and got downvoted like crazy saying I was dumb and it was too niche.
---
I WAS SNEAKING UP TO UNHOOK A SURVIVOR, THEN I GLITCH AND GET STUCK AGAINST A TREE. KILLER SEES ME, CLEARLY SEES I'M STUCK IN A GLITCH AND DOWNS ME. THANKS. 
---
Standing still isn't your only nor best option.
---
It‚Äôs bad in the same way that Windows of Opportunity is bad. Most players will know where the window/pallet/totem spawns are anyways.
---
Really? I genuinely couldn't have told, they look incredibly natural. Props to the editor then, I wouldn't even have noticed anything being off if it wasn't for the hands.
---
Fuck with my Pablo, fuck with me. And I am done being fucked with.
---
You should go in a match with a killer chasing you around the same gen all game that‚Äôs not fun 
---
It boggles me why they chose those specific dlcs to be on sale, and not include Nightmare or Curtain Call
---
HUAH HUAH HUAHHHHH *^^WHEEZING ^^SOUNDS*

I guess it looks KINDA natural, still you have to be legally blind to not tell this is a fake pic

Is dead hard toxic or something?

Left Behined is anything but concistent. I put it in useless because it is super situational and the payback is not worth it. What I mean with concistent is that you can releably use it almost every game.
---
&gt;Hangman‚Äôs trick may have it as well, you may as well run 3 perks and you know why.
---
I cannot make any sense put of what you are trying to say
---
Edit: I just realised that my survivor tier list is on a different post. Still Hangman'a trick allows you to use whatever hook you like. I try to put the least amount of perks in useless as possible since perks are rarely practically useless, but some perks, like left behined, ar
---
Man you really like to follow me around. What argument was I supposed to agree with again? That survivors are in control of whether or not they get hit? Yeah I‚Äôll pass on agreeing with that nonsense.
---
no, but the window of invincibility and a small speed boost might give you some time to get to that pallet or something
---
Killer disconnecting isn't any better or more fun. Your still dragging all four who waited for a game with you.
---
TIER LIST UPDATE GUYS :
---
S TIER : NURSE
---
A TIER : BILLY, HUNTRESS
---
B TIER : PLAGUE, LEGION
---
NOTE : OTHERS KILLERS WERE REMOVED FROM THE TIER LIST WHEN METTLE OF MAN WAS ADDED. 
---
BTW, MCLEAN CONFIRMED THAT LETHAL BLINKS SHOULD COUNT AS HITS FOR METTLE OF MAN, BUT IN THIS MOMENT IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE OF A BUG. WHEN WILL DOES COUNT, I WILL NEED TO REMOVE NURSE FROM TIER LIST TOO.
---
DeLEte lEgIOn oR uNinsTALl
---
Pretty much.  Individually, mettle of man, the buffed d strike or borrowed time or whatever, all individually are fine to deal with.  But it becomes absolute HELL when it's stacked together against decent survivors.
---
He's right, thanataphobia buff didn't go through because stacking it with sloppy butcher was too strong but this gets to remain as ok?
---
Do we need another cool down timer like exhaustion so you can't just stack second chance perks or something, change all of these perks entirely so it's impossible to stack em, I dunno.  Really MoM doesn't effect Billy  too much and that's about it considering he can just instant down on command, and also leatherface but Billy is just a far better leatherface.
---
It's certainly extremely annoying and I'll just drop killer for now and stick with survivor stacks when I play this game and that's it.  They made killer more unfun then it was previously.
---
I agree, I've seen her stream. It's rough to watch because of how she acts. 
---
sounds like its not the game for you, i have fun playing
---
The perk icon lights up when the Killer is within 36 meters and looking in your direction. Most killers have a 32 meter Terror Radius, so Spine Chill can give you an extra second or two to get away, which is much better than it sounds
---
You might as well leave the mans alone
---
Stake out doesn't really require a stealth build. You will often be within the killer terror radius working on a generator while he is chasing another person.
---
I also am not sure how maps work, I guess it could be useful for that, I just didn't know the map tracks objects revealed by aura reading, I tought it only tracked objects as you walk past them
---
Also important tip: Be greedy with pallets, don‚Äôt just throw them down because they are your lifelines, make sure when you loop that you stick as close as possible to the object your looping around so that you can turn as fast as possible. 
---
When I say greedy I mean it, it‚Äôs worth risking a hit just to keep a pallet up (depends on the scenario) eventually you‚Äôll get better and know exactly when to drop em.
---
Btw, remove urban evasion and I suppose you use sprint burst? Yea substitute it with dead hard to allow you to make a mistake.
---
Don't flatter yourself. You commented in a recent post lmao
---
I mean, if you're bad enough that you have zero control over being hit that's on you. 
---
But others as well! Like you consistently ignore people explaining how MoM is different than DH, BL, and SB
---
Fair and balanced, BHVR has always given far more leeway to survivors then killers because of low ranks, and good survivors can take advantage of all the broken things left in for them that normally are just supposed to help a bad player live a bit longer.
---
Just another day of DBD
---
They can't cuz it's a repost
---
Not gonna lie, got hit with nearly the same combo as this mentioned yesterday. Was looping an Ash for a good 20 seconds around the killer shack and finally got a hit on him when mettle of man kicked in. Angry, but i let it go cause i understand its a good perk. Then when he continues to loop me and i catch him once more, he gets adredaline, runs the distance of a fucking football field, and then insta heals. Damn near threw everything around my general area threw a wall lmao
---
Sorry, but I have really no idea what happened here. Care to explain?

Killers are fine with the perk individually it's just when stacked with the other second chance perks it becomes absurd and incredibly easy to proc.

Just found it amusing that nurse was not very late to the unhook, we all jumped in lockers, and I was waiting for ONE of us to get grabbed... And she just left?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, that actually looks cute as hell. 
---
Borrowed Time only works if you're unhooked by a survivor, so it doesn't pair well with Deliverance (in the sense that you can give yourself the BT effect).
---
I just started season two but I'm surprised AoD hasn't really come up in the show, do they talk about it at all?
---
Therefore, you said that the perk‚Äôs acronym would change from MoM to Meta of Man which is still MoM. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.
---
omg! 
---
How do you adapt to 4 people ignoring the dying state in one game? Especially when those stacks are stacked with something like Adrenaline and instaheals? That's not something you adapt to like learning a new map. It's potentially a big balance issue
---
know*
---
I like to run it with an iridescent map and the crystal bead so everyone knows where everything is, but that‚Äôs pretty much the only reason to run it :P
---
What even is the last one? Like where is this from cause I It would be perfect for a contact.
---
I'd rather not even bother staring to play Dead By Daylight, if you ask me. \^\^
---
Some combos I'd like to see more of:
---
Autodidact + Spine Chill - Autodidact is still pretty bad, but Spine Chill is the only way to increase the skill check chances on a vanilla heal, "so there"
---
Play With Your Food + Save The Best For Last - faster successful hit recovery plus faster movement speed equals shorter chases; Rancor pairs reasonably well with this, being able to get rid of your Obsession with 1 hit, losing only 2 STBFL and 1 PWYF stack in the process; Barbecue &amp; Chili is good with this as the only way to potentially locate your Obsession, using the silhouette to discern which survivor is which; only really nice on Wraith, due to being able to farm PWYF stacks without too serious a time investment
---
Brutal Strength + Bamboozle + Fire Up - pretty self-explanatory; particularly neat on Myers due to his inherently increased vault speed and ability to benefit from respecting pallets
---
Sprint Burst + Vigil - try to have Exhaustion somewhat recovered before entering chase, then using Shift management to regain SB mid-chase
---
Dead Hard/Lithe/Sprint Burst + Balanced Landing - BL can reasonably be paired up with any Exhaustion perk, since its stagger reduction is just that great; it's the most "in-sync" with DH, since you have more freedom to pick and choose which to use when
---
Botany Knowledge + Pharmacy - gives you a two-heal Emergency Med-Kit that you get to keep; add Ace In The Hole for even more/even faster heals, and the occasional Styptic
---
Borrowed Time + Decisive Strike + Deliverance - BT to make sure you get the Safe Unhook to activate Deliverance, DS to make sure you survive your Deliverance, if needed; pairs well with Dead Hard to save you after Deliverance or DS; Unbreakable is also nice with this, to counter being DS-slugged; Mettle Of Man has synergy with DS and Deliverance as well, making them more reliable... pick your poison
---
Dance With Me + Lithe + Quick &amp; Quiet - reliably lose the killer, temporarily or for good (temporarily losing the killer is still powerful, wasting time, depleting Bloodlust, recovering Exhaustion, getting to safer areas of the map); Iron Will is a staple in any stealth-juke builds, allowing you to do those some things while injured
---
Adrenaline + Poised + Sprint Burst - stealthy get-away after every gen you finish with a scratchmark-less 3-second sprint, as well as potentially during chases, and another scratchmark-less 5-second sprint when the last gen pops; Dark Sense would be neat with this if it didn't come with the ridiculous restriction of you having to be the one to finish the respective generator
---
Kindred + Open-Handed + Bond - lots of valuable information, now 8 meters more valuable; Windows Of Opportunity also benefits from Open-Handed
---
Head On + Quick &amp; Quiet - never do this
---
Boil Over + Unbreakable + Flip-Flop + Tenacity - again, never do this
---
Up The Ante + Slippery Meat - I advice against doing this
---
A Nurse's Calling + Monitor &amp; Abuse - terror radius smaller than NC range equals Lethal Blinks; also nice on some other killers, like Hag
---
Hex: Devour Hope + Hex: Haunted Ground + Hex: No One Escapes Death - without Ruin in play, survivors sometimes won't cleanse Hex totems, especially if there is more than one on the map; if they do cleanse them, HG protects DH as a decoy, and if they don't cleanse them, well, then you have DH - which, once you are at 3 stacks, they will try to cleanse Hex totems, where HG again protects DH; in the rare scenario that they cleanse DH without cleansing HG, you will have NOED in the end game and HG can potentially again protect it (albeit with the caveat that smart survivors will probably remember the totem positions and won't cleanse those that were already Hexes); this is a particularly good combination on Spirit, the killer survivors are most likely to not cleanse Hex totems against, but it also murders on Nurse and Hag
---
tbh; u right
---
What is the exclusive item?
---
I'm always right! B)
---
It's nothing new to adapt to though. Your ability to counter is determined by your killer/add ons which you choose before you know the survivor has MoM. When you use an m1 killer like Wraith or Freddy there is no counterplay, it's just an additional health state. There is no new gameplay mechanic to learn, it's just a free health state for survivors. 
---
I had this twice the other day! Whenever you run, your guy stops every couple seconds. Buggy ass game.
---
Dude go back and look what I wrote. I didn‚Äôt complain I kindly responded to this post and stated my opinion. I respect everyone‚Äôs opinion and that makes me a rational. 
---
What I wrote
---
I love yhe perk but it is a nbit overpowered, but killers have had nothing but buffs and survivors have had so many nerfs so i think its fair
---
I WAS PLAYING SWF AND ALL 4 OF US BROUGHT BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS AND THE FUCKING KILLER DCS
---
Very cool, thanks!
---
Ha-ha-ha-ha! No.
---
You fucking kidding me right ? D-Strike was fine as it was, it didnt needed a freakin buff ! 
---
Same tbh. Is ash vs evil dead the original show that the character is from?
---
Then stop playing and pick up another game. 
---
Look, you're totally misunderstanding what I meant when I said complaining. You're treating it like I said you were whining. I was not. You can issue a complaint without it being whining or negative. You are way, way too hung up on that
---
I'll work on an album in the next 5 mins and edit the post :)
---
AND WHEN THE KILLER DCS BECAUSE YOU ESCAPED
---
Survivors simply shouldn't be the ones in the power role, and yet they absolutely are. It is the killer's job to instill terror and make life very difficult. BHVR was honestly lost on the whole definition of "Asymmetrical" gameplay even at the start. 
---
If you double it up with a map it updates the map with information so you can find the totems etc again. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry the same thing happens at rank 6 except people send me PSN messages with racial slurs. 
---
Lol tru3 üòÇ
---
U/Voater14 summed it up perfectly in another thread:
---
Most of the best streamers who spend 8 hours a day on the game and have 3000 hours playtime say it's extremely broken and needs a nerf.
---
Average reddit user who plays survivor only and disconnects whenever the going gets tough say it's worse than dead hard.
---
Make your choice.
---
WAIT WHAT!? MoM‚Äôs HIT PROTECTION WAKES UP THE SURVIVOR!? THAT HAS TO BE A BUG/UNINTENTIONAL! I DON‚ÄôT SEE ANY CLAUSE THAT MoM WAKES UP THE SURVIVOR, EVEN ADRENALINE SPECIFICALLY SAYS IT WAKES UP THE SURVIVOR.
---
This happened to me the other day, I had to reinstall the game, it worked just fine after that. 
---
Why you gotta make me think of a turned Lee chasing Clem around like that bruh, I‚Äôm a huge fan of that series. Nah but I think the only issue would be remodelling Kenny for the game, Lee and Clem should be pretty easy
---
Good point. I forgot that Killer and Survivor Rank are separate. But perhaps they can figure a way to balance that. *shrug*
---
What I meant is that used hook are never a problem. The only possible use I would see on this perk is if Saboteur has a comeback into the meta. In my opinion a tier list should be about its chance of that perk to change the outcome of a game
---
I resolve this problem by being terrible at the game, and not being an interesting enough person to make up for it.
---
&gt; but killers have had nothing but buffs and survivors have had so many nerfs so i think its fair
---
This is such a pet peeve of mine. People love to rattle off this "killer buffs survivor nerfs" thing with absolutely no context that the reason killers were buffed and survivors were nerfed is because there were pretty bad issues that made survivors OP and some killers were just straight up not viable.
---
And *even if* it were true that survivors were victims of unfair changes it does not justify bringing in a perk with balance issues 
---
If you don't know how to loop then that is probably why you think MoM is necessary. Getting hit kind of is our fault. What do you do in a chase? If you think you're supposed to wait at a pallet to try and get the stun, you're doing it all wrong.
---
DS really isnt an issue with enduring. if youre playing with headphones so can hear which direction theyre running, by the time youve recovered theyre usually less than 10 feet away
---
Alright people keep saying this, but how exactly did DS get buffed?
---
It's controversial in the sense that many players who use the perk do not consider it OP because they don't really get to see the impact it has on the killers perspective. For players who play killer, it can be a serious detriment due to the need to maintain pressure on survivors.
---
The perk by itself is strong but not OP. Sure they can tank a hit &amp; extend the chase but that's ok if its only one survivor similar to DS. What makes it OP is when a survivor uses dead hard, instant heals, adrenaline &amp; the perk that they can effectively avoid 2 or 3 killing blows from the killer. The perk can also be reused if the survivor escapes &amp; heals themselves meaning it becomes an issue again for the killer later in the match. 
---
Worse is when 4 survivors use this perk. That means that the killer will be cucked off 4 hits that could have downed survivors. That's 4 solid hooks they have lost the opportunity off using &amp; removing the pressure of downing a survivor 4 times in a match. This was the issue that DS brought where a killer would instantly lose pressure because the survivor could stun them &amp; run off, forcing the killer to chase them again. 
---
Its the same issue that DS brought where the more talented a survivor is, the more of a set back it becomes for a killer. Imagine chasing a survivor for around a minute only to have them tank a hit &amp; extend the chase for another minute or so. If you leave them they can heal up &amp; tank another hit with the perk.
---
The biggest slap in the face though is that it can be countered by high tier killers whereas all the lower tier killers that struggle at high ranking matches such as Freddy are affected by this perk. It creates a bigger gap between the lower tier killers &amp; the higher tier killers, harming killer diversity at the higher ranks.
---
On one hand, I get it because it's a bug that literally breaks any round it's in. But ranking up is such an arduous task as survivor that i imagine people just suck it up. DCing is a huge penalty if you care about rank. 
---
Yep, aura reading is not useful at all!
---
No but it's sort of annoying and also adds to prolonging the chase because it generally happens right before you'd down them, instead of at the start.
---
what about him?
---
Sounds a little strong. Keep in mind a killer should have 4 strong perks as survivors have 16 perks combined 
---
I think it's too early to make that call for certain. But there are bad signs. It doesn't seem like it was considered how strong this perk would be when stacked in-game.
---
Killer has very little room for error compared to survivor and losing time is never a good thing. MoM is a perk that essentially forces a killer who did not make an error to lose time and momentum as if they did and the survivor has to do nothing to reap the benefits.
---
I don't think there should be survivor perks that force killer success to turn into killer failure in general and the ability for that to happen 4 times in one game is not good
---
Is it so much alike that ED2 counts as a remake or is it so different that you shouldn‚Äôt watch it? Make up your mind.
---
Thruth.
---
Hopefully this will give them a bit of incentive to put it back on, idk maybe I'm just being too optimistic 
---
Tomatoes?
---
Good to see I'm not the only one that does this. :)

Here's a guide to running a lot of the map tiles as a survivor. That's a huge part of chasing well, and lithe is by no means a bad perk for it. Pounding through gens and totems is great, as well. Here's a link to practice skillchecks for more consistent greats, if you want: http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/
---
Most of everything else is game sense, which you'll gain over time. You can watch YouTubers and streamers to get a feel for it, but you'll end up there no matter what as long as you try things out, and learn from your mistakes.
---
Other than that, you'll eventually want to level other survivors for more perks. I recommend you never Prestige Feng, or do it right away until you can't.
---
From there, level until you have every perk, always getting 1 perk per bloodweb. You can then level other survivors with the bloodpoints you make as her, without playing anyone else.
---
But the other can just move on, they get a handful of points and lose nothing.
---
A survivor leaving just makes it harder for everyone but the killer and can have negative effects because of that.
---
There's no situation in which you're in the right here.
---
Yeah I planned on leaving up Feng to be able to swap over down the road to Meg, Nea, or Claudette.
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt obliterating a team give pips tho? If a rank 15 Killer is going around 4k‚Äôing Survivors in uner 5 minutes, it‚Äôs probably a sign he needs to be a higher rank. 
---
BECAUSE I MANAGED TO STUN, BLIND AND HIDE. OTHERWISE THE STORY WOULDNT HAVE BEEN THE SAME.
---
THE THING THAT WORRIES ME IS THAT WE WENT AT THE SAME SPEED WITH ME ACTIVATING LITHE, THAT'S SUPOSED TO GIVE ME SOME DISTANCE, BUT WE WENT TOGETHER :/
---
Well then he's not even licensed and this is all moot point.
---
Don't forget distortion. Its not meta but I enjoy it as a solo survivor. I can either use it early to get a good start and complete 1-2 gens with less chance of the killer finding me or I can aim to save them for the late game, especially if the game is going bad. On top of that it is great for getting information like is the killer running BBQ, nurses or bitter. Personally think it is very under-rated. 
---
Not necessarily. I've been hit twice since the change. Both times with the same scenario.
---
Unsafe unhook under the killers nose
---
Chase the unhooking survivor
---
Lose the unhooking survivor
---
Find the original hooked survivor
---
I'm not bitching and actually like the new DS over the original but getting hit with it does not mean you're tunnling.
---
You‚Äòre listening to one of the most neutral streamers out there. 
---
/s 
---
AND HE WASN'T CLOAKED WHEN THAT HAPPENED?
---
Just random things ash would say but the most notable is groovy but it is hard to tell some of them because they‚Äôre super quiet.
---
I wanna say that was mean of you, but that Pig was making horrible career-ending choices. It's all her fault, really.
---
Yeah, you don't need another 100 hours of experimentation to see how giving survivors an extra health state with no downsides(99% healing) could be problematic, especially when there's multiple survivors running it in a match. 
---
I know there‚Äôs a lot of people who don‚Äôt speak or understand English so it‚Äôd kinda be a useless thing to only have it in English. 
---
I never wanted to say disconnecting is right. In my opinion disconnecting on other side is shit and just as bad regardless. 
---
Actually the perk won't work when you're in healthy state so off the survivor is running both Adrenaline and MoM, then it is actually useless against NOED. But yeah unlikely that the survivor will have MoM in that late game
---
YES! I literally thought that I was the only one that actually ships this!
---
It's actually a tier list exactly like that that left me unsatisfied and let to me creating this list since many perks did not get the credit they deserved. I understand where you are comming from with placing it in useless and I can see it being there, but I used it myself a fair bit and if it's anything, at least it's fun to use (in my opinion)
---
Actually lots of survivors dont care
---
Thank you!
---
Not a Legion main. His biggest weakness is his lethality in a chase. Add ons help with this, but the most effective method is literally the cheese. How big this weakness is depends on your willingness to commit to the cheese.
---
As survivor if Legion is approaching you as a group in FF, getting hit first guarantees safety.
---
There are four survivors to every killer, so obviously you have to take everything with a grain of salt. Also, DS recently getting nerfed caused a huge strain on this sub and revived the us vs. them mentality.  
---
If I‚Äôm a killer main, anything extremely powerful that was given, I wouldn‚Äôt want to get it nerfed and I would argue that it‚Äôs fine/fair/underwhelming.  It‚Äôs natural to not want to lose power. 
---
As for the perk itself, it‚Äôs extremely powerful and is OP under the right conditions. Imagine four survivors running it?  As a killer, that‚Äôs 2 extra downs total including two extra entire chases of what equates to healthy survivors. The games aren‚Äôt that long for it to not weigh extraordinarily is the survivors favor.
---
Individual survivors don‚Äôt see the insane strength of the perk, though. They just see it as ‚Äúmy chase just extended more‚Äù or it gave them a small chance of getting away. However it‚Äôs not 1 v 1, there are four survivors going against one. This perk will allow a second chance at chase, letting the others to do gens, get rescues, etc..  Most matches have that moment where if a killer plays it perfectly, they can gain momentum and stop a gen snowball. This throws that completely out the window.  Also, if that survivor happens to be decent, they‚Äôre gone and have wasted much more time than any other perk in the game. 
---
I can see why killers would be worried as I do think 4 of them could be a struggle, especially if the survivors are good and able to get it to trigger more than once. As a solo survivor I like it because it will give me more survivability but I do think if I was in SWF running it then it could become a bit OP. 
---
OP how did you get a picture of Survivor‚Äôs Controllers on a console? 
---
People aren‚Äôt asking about weird scenarios where you wouldn‚Äôt be able to watch them all. They just want to know what to watch and you‚Äôre being an idiot about it.
---
There are things that happen in all 3 movies that impact the events of the TV series. If you‚Äôre in jail or live in the North Pole are in a nuclear submarine then you probably don‚Äôt have to watch any of it. If a doctor told you that you only have 30 minutes to live and you only have time to watch one episode then it‚Äôs a non-issue. If you are, on the other hand, able to buy or rent the movies like everyone with an electronic device is in 2019 then watch all the movies and don‚Äôt listen to what some online nobody says about how you should skip something. 
---
Makes sense. Anything can be fun as long as its new :p
---
I prefer anonymity. I'm a woman and have been gaming a very long time (since Pong). Harassment for women gamers is a real and aggravating part of playing online games. This includes doxxing. So I appreciate that I'm anonymous to other players until the end of a match. Even then I have my PS4 set to refuse messages from non-friends. I value my privacy and my sanity and getting toxic messages and harassment by thirsty dudes with no home training ruins my fun.
---
lmao imagine thinking this
---
Ah you know it's not right.
---
You just don't care. 
---
I see.
---
No problem!
---
Always glad to see new players, and definitely don't be afraid to make mistakes. If you decide to stick with the game, you'll get there, and anything on the way is just people's opinions.
---
Please keep in mind that some of the "gimmick" tier perks are actually better than the "average" tier. You should kind of see "gimmick" as a tier of it's own.
---
Killers with good map traversal can easily get use out of the perk, but I think that it is lacking for a majority of the cast, thats why it's in gimmick
---
Bans are essentially a myth for this game.  It requires Ochido levels of griefing to earn a ban, and even that takes years to occur.
---
More neutral than someone like Jen

What‚Äôs wrong with this photo?
---
Bruce is an Ace main, confirmed. Man of culture.
---
Baby killer mad he can't get the 4k matches he feels entitled to.... 
---
Imagine still complaining about DS when it was made super situational and NOED was untouched. 
---
I dont want to see people bitch about NOED anymore then lol.
---
I love how some of you treat NOED as a partisan issue, like only killer-sympathizers could feel that there's appropriate counters and downsides to running it, and a *true* survivor player would always feel it's bullshit and OP. 
---
*misses swing" nice ded 'ard
---
how is true toxic? hes the least toxic streamer ive seen, if you think true is toxic then you havent seen other streamers who derank to bully baby killers
---
No, when both effects are up, after being hit u enter the mending state, and then you have to mend to enter the injured state to be able to use MoM
---
GOODBYYYYE, CLAUCLAU !
---
It literally doesn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve never seen the show, have you?
---
I also want to know if it works with Deliverance's "Broken" status effect!
---
I've noticed that in the match, his grunts are typically pretty loud-- I think louder than any other survivor... But his little quips he makes when loading into a lobby are pretty quiet.
---
I agree with you in that case. I too hate it whenever other players harass women just because of their gender. However, do you think they would harass you, message you, dox you, etc. if their identity is known as well? I‚Äôm just proposing an idea that maybe they wouldn‚Äôt do these things if the one they were doing it to knew who they were and could be easily identified to report to authorities. Again, just an idea to continue discussion.
---
Ah. That sounds a bit more reasonable I guess. 
---
Mental gymnastics is a hell of a drug 
---
First up, Technician is an awful perk. You ought to replace it with pretty much whatever you want and I can almost guarantee that it'll be a better choice.  
---
Second, thanks to Lithe she is an excellent looper, and you're going to want to use that to your advantage. Don't be afraid to be the distraction, as it's really the only way you'll learn how to loop the killer effectively.  
---
Every time you go down, think to yourself, "What did I do wrong?" and learn from your mistakes. Remember, there is *always* room for improvement.  
---
If you want to gen jockey, Lithe can also come in handy here, although I advise you pair it with Q&amp;Q, as you won't want to alert the killer every time you want to cover more ground at a faster pace.  
---
The gist of this strategy is to complete a generator, and then rush off to the next as fast as you can. Lithe will usually recover before the next gen is completed, while Q&amp;Q will definitely recover. Rince and repeat.
---
I already stopped using it personally because I don't like perks that are only good against certain killers. It has helped me get away in some games for the two days I was using it but so do other perks. 
---
I didn't play as much killer as I did survivor but I can see it being annoying for some killers when everyone runs it but DS was way worse.
---
I personally prefer Detective's Hunch over Small Game when it comes to cleansing totems. It's still kinda shit tho. It definitely deserves some sort of buff.
---
It's a holdover from before cosmetics were as big as they are now.
---
If you run noed you're trash
---
are you gay or something wtf 
---
Yeah this pretty much sums it up to me
---
NOED is fine, do totems it‚Äôs a easy counter and they even give you a perk to find the totems. I see and laugh at these fools who think it‚Äôs funny to gen rush and have them all done within 2-3mims then that NOED goes active because they got greedy and didn‚Äôt bother to touch a single totem lol! 
---
Surveillance is kind of useless if you're running Discordance honestly, I would swap it out for Nurse's or Sloppy.
---
Learn to track by sound and grass/corn if you're on a map with one of those.
---
Mental gymnastics from me?
---
But it's a Myers
---
Injure the first one and chase the second.
---
And he has noed, that completely ignores MoM, if you are fully healed.
---
An excellent point. This is what I've said for weeks too. When the tryhard P3 claudettes get it unlocked to go with the rest of their tier 3 meta perks, then the real fun begins.
---
I believe it will be worse than DS for 2 reasons...
---
1) DS was common, but not that common you would always get 3-4 per game purely because of the 35% rule. Average was about 2 per game. There is no downside to this so all 4 can feel free to run it at once.
---
2) You could at least slug or dribble the obsession to buy you time. Also the 35%....sometimes it would happen, sometimes it wouldn't. You can't do shit against MoM with a number of killers, no slugging, nothing. It just extends the chase outright. If they 99% heal too then oh boy are you in for fun. Hybridpanda showed a clip earlier, takes a hit and MoM protects him, taps heal, takes 2 more to down. That's insane. All 4 can have it pop at anytime too.
---
My personal belief is that they got cold feet about putting out a paid survivor only dlc. Even though it had a strong license, a lot don't know who Ash is and at the end of the day he is just a skin afterall. I think they put in the busted perk to sell it. They knew it was broken, anyone could see that, but they just wanted the money. It's disgusting.
---
Can't see them nerfing it for a long time due to a backlash from people that just bought it. If they do though, sell a dlc on a broken perk and just nerf it then I imagine a lot of people would be pissed and review bomb the game. The devs are in a pickle either way and they completely deserve any shit thrown at them.
---
Well the timer is 60 seconds, but I know what you mean, have done this before by accident because everyone decided to dress the same, I just left them on the ground and went after there teammates then a few seconds later they are back up... 
---
The community do be like that.
---
By itself?  It's a decent perk, you can probably get a use out of it if you try for it specifically.  The issue comes when it's stacked with DS, insta-heal, dead hard and such.  It goes from being a decent perk to suddenly becoming the one piece needed for a new survivor meta that's super unfun to play against.
---
Not really. If the case is settled there'd be no issue licensing him to a different game.
---
I can't say anything about Jen, but there are plenty other that don't deserve this status at all, in my opinion. There are a lot streamer, that camp like crazy and have a high view count.
---
And that's all what you needed to get this status: A high view count.
---
Being a fog whisperer is worth nothing.
---
FF?
---
Oh ok then sorry. I had seen some people calling the rework a buff and had forgot the stun time got extended
---
It's dead in the sense that all new content was cancelled.
---
Not every game is going to be appealing to every person. Like you said it is a videogame and it is supposed to be fun, if your not having it then the game probably isn't for you so just get another game. 
---
Lot's of people, including myself, have fun with this game despite its flaws.
---
when you say WAS, how long ago? like pre nerf pre nerf ds where even when you were not the obsession it would activate on pickup and have a 4sec stun time (as bad as that). i need to really see how good it can be when used correctly
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fair. The big reason I like boil over is because of how situational it was. I‚Äôve directly won matches only because I had it. I was playing legion and the whole team got killed except me, and of course he was standing by the hatch. Well the hook next to the hatch was destroyed so I just jumped for it anyway, and when he pulled me out I struggled and got away right before he could get to another hook, sprint burst kicked in and I made it to the hatch. 
---
&gt; BBQ are two very obvious ones I can think of
---
Urgh. BBQ is not a useful aura reading perk in most circumstances because of how easy it is to avoid or fake the killer out.
---
&gt; There are plenty of killer perks that force a survivor "who did not make an error to lose time and momentum as if they did make an error" and the killer "has to do nothing to reap the benefits".
---
The issue is, as I explained, that killer has much less room for error so it's much more of an aggravating problem for that role. It's an issue of degrees. Survivors losing momentum and time is not much of an issue like it is for killer because they have greater room to still succeed and have multiple lives and multiple sources of man power. And now to segue into your Make Your Choice issue, it is not at all comparable to MoM. A survivor who has Make Your Choice applied can avoid the consequences of that perk. A killer cannot avoid the consequences of MoM.
---
That's a big difference.
---
&gt; Its been a very long time since survivor side has had any new perks added to mix up the meta. I always feel that as a killer each DLC has added at least one new perk which could be used. I find it refreshing to not be able to guess survivor perks with 90% accuracy at the moment.
---
Because, to be frank, survivors are uninterested in anything that isn't super fucking powerful. Out of the last 3 survivors before Ash, some great perks came out like Poised, Deliverance, and Aftercare.
---
NOED can be countered. How do you expect killers like wraith, clown, doctor etc. to counter MoM? MoM is crazy good even with the aura reveal downside and with a competent 4 man SWF it's busted.
---
Oh my sweet summer child...
---
Ahhh you meant killer rarity, these do look nice, I might need to add them :)
---
Why bother telling him then? You just waste your time. And you had to be a jerk for it. Who is the dumb  now?
---
All three are excellent to level up, even if you don't intend to main them, so that's definitely a good idea.  
---
Some of their perks are among the best in the game and will be useful for almost all situations.
---
God that's true, I wasn't even thinking about the double depip. I guess if you abuse the bug you're just an asshole
---
Yeah, you have it about right. 
---
I dunno lol, just worse than DS was last year.
---
I say this because the 35% held DS back, in terms of sometimes survivors didn't get to use it, and sometimes survivors didn't bring it because they wouldn't get to use it.
---
In addition you could dribble or slug the DS user. When you hit an injured DS carrier they went down. You can walk away and the slug buys you time.
---
MoM has none of that. It just extends the chase no questions asked and all 4 can use it at any time.
---
Lot's of people, including myself, enjoy this game despite its flaws.   
---
Like you say it is a video game and it is supposed to be fun. If you aren't enjoying it then just put it down and play something else. A break might help, change your style of play, don't worry about rank and take it serious as the flaws will bother you more or just stop playing.   
---
Hiding in lockers slows survivors down and hiding in gen auras doesn't work that well anymore since a couple of patches. I usually can see a survivor behind a gen.
---
Guess I'm buying the DLC. Sounds fun to try.
---
People are just downvoting you for being disingenuous, actually. 
---
It's only one hit if there's one of these perks in the match. It's like you guys are purposely avoiding this point. 
---
I hope you enjoy them as much as I do :)
---
Nah bitching killers,  i agree with you 
---
Don't threaten me with a good time!
---
perks? MoM and old DS. Adrenaline.
---
Loops? wretched shop, abbatoir window, ironworks window, crotus asylum, haddonfield with balanced etc etc
---
No. The question was do you need to watch the movies. My answer was no. You‚Äôre being an idiot acting like it‚Äôs absolutely required and thinking differently is wrong.
---
And all the movies aren‚Äôt free. They aren‚Äôt on Netflix either. So yeah, watching the movies ain‚Äôt required. Get over it.
---
I‚Äôm not even a big Tru3 fan and I know he doesn‚Äôt like/doesn‚Äôt use NOED and wants it out of the game.  I think he leans that way so many won‚Äôt have a go to strawman, though. 
---
&gt;Busted perk gets added
---
"Ugh people are really going to complain about a busted perk huh? So typical!"
---
Imagine running insidious with the hag and having a hooked survivor trapped up. Most satisfying feeling is when another survivor either doesn't know I'm the hag, or doesn't care, and triggers a trap- just to get yoinked off the survivor they tried unhooking. I've gotten full basement numerous times due to that 
---
Yes but he originated from the movies. You can be a fan of him without having seen the show. So to act like it‚Äôs stupid to like him ‚Äúbut not know the show he came from‚Äù is kinda stupid.
---
Urgh. Just ran into one of those players today. It was literally faster to let myself be dropped onto the ground and recover with unbreakable.
---
I HATE WAITING 15+ MINUTES FOR A GAME AS SURVIVOR 
---
Who says the case is settled
---
AS A PERSON WHO USES CLOWN I CAN SAY THIS IS FAIRLY ACCURATE. EXCEPT I DONT SHIT TALK LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.
---
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR HERMAN CARTER?
---
Lithe and Lightweight it's a pretty solid combo, get rid of Technician 'cause the perk is useless, Alert it's good but you better switch it for Resilience (since you don't have self care, this is a good perk to do everything faster while injured)
---
Isn't this a repost?
---
STOP D/CING ONCE YOU GET DOWNED. YOU WORTHLESS TEAMMATES!
---
lol I love Scott but this is still a funny comment
---
Oh that is a big off, but meg is free
---
I completely agree, DCs fuck the killer over and they get compensated, but it also fucks the remaining survivors over and they get nothing.
---
NOPE, FULLY VISIBLE. I KNOW HE GETS A LITTLE BURST OF SPEED WHEN HE UNCLOAKS TOO, BUT YOU CANT GO FROM ONE DOOR OF LERY'S TO THE OTHER WITH THAT LITTLE BURST
---
Oh ok. Doesn‚Äôt David have dead hard?
---
Plot twist both are evil clones.
---
The angst is strong, with this one..‚úä
---
Honestly they do need to add in punishments  (I would recieve some myself if I'm being honest) but I think the reas9n the devs haven't really done much is because from the beginning, their stance was that people shouldn't be in matches they don't want to be in. Theres instances, imo, where it's not bad to dc. They're rare, but they happen. I think the devs really need to take a break from chapter releases and new content and get to the sole problem of the dc in the first place- they need their servers up and running. They need to do something to leigon and fix some other issues with different killers. They need to pretty much rework balance and implement some new mechanics. The game largely isn't very enjoyable a lot of the time, the toxicity stems from somewhere. A lot of people are frustrated with how the devs have managed to nuke the game at times so being shitty people is how they get "payback" so to speak. 
---
POSSIBLY THEN. I FIGURED HE MIGHT'VE HAD HIS SPEED ADD-ONS EQUIPPED
---
do you choose when to activate DS and get the skill check? 
---
ive only just started playing survivor and dont have laurie so have no idea how it works. usually though when im carrying a hooked survivor they seem to use it at the worst possible times like in the middle of an open area
---
Why though? Aren‚Äôt the prizes provided by the fog whisperers themselves? If you‚Äôre looking deduct a few gifts on your taxes you can just lie about it and hope you don‚Äôt get audited. You‚Äôre risking fraud charges either way. 
---
Level 35 actually I think.
---
Yea, I‚Äôd recommend new players to always level up David first and main him for a bit because not only does he have the 2nd best exhaustion perk, he also has a perk that allows you to double your bloodpoint gains every match! It‚Äôs called we‚Äôre gonna live forever and it‚Äôs a great perk to start the grind with, it also teaches survivors to be more altruistic.
---
Respecting blatant selfishness isn't a good thing.
---
I have a spirit build designed to just snowball the absolute hell out of the survivors, they let me grab a finger and I pull off the whole arm kind of thing, and BBQ is pretty pivotal to keeping my pressure feisty after hooking someone. Even if I don't see any auras I'm still gaining information so it's still useful.
---
I dont play him alot but yeah he cant turn on a dime while frenzy so well timed 360 is easy since hell go wide. Think like billy with shitty addons. Also depends on the build I run stuff to make my cooldown from frenzy faster so that I hit them with frenzy catch up to them and m1 them. So it takes advantage of the meta where people dont heal. 
---
They are also tiny killers so mind games when your walking is fairly easy. 
---
Overall unless you got franks, dont depend on frenzy to down them. 
---
I have every season on Bluray.
---
Good try though.
---
Who are you quoting?
---
I suggest getting quick and quiet from Meg so you can break line of sight and GTFO.
---
my wife and I play this game a lot, and the amount of times we have crashes is crazy, but it reports as a disconnect.
---
I agree but that killer should also strive to hook each survivor 3 times. even if he kind of has to force it. That will mean more chases, more ability usage, and more hits per person. If a rank 15 is ending games in less than 5 minutes, he probably doesn't know that he can get a maximum of 32k bp rather than &lt;20k for killing everybody on their first hook/slug
---
Have you watched them?
---
I wonder if there will ever be a day when the Devs will finally show some love for the weaker killers or if they are going to continue neutering killer diversity.
---
I HAVE THE WORST LUCK AS BOTH SURVIVOR AND KILLER IN THIS GAME...
---
I'VE PLAYED 8 SURVIVOR GAMES TODAY AND HALF OF THEM HAVE HAD MORI'S (I CAN'T EVEN USE DS BECAUSE OF THE MORI)
---
CONSTANTLY VERSING RANK 2 KILLERS (I'M RANK 9) AND THEY'RE ALL USING THEIR BEST ADD ONS EVEN THOUGH MATCHMAKING IS FUCKED AND THEY'RE PLAYING AGAINST RANK 10+
---
WHY ARE SURVIVORS STILL SPAWNING NEXT TO MY RUIN? AND WHY THE FUCK IS IT ALWAYS OUT IN THE OPEN? 
---
I WANT TO PRACTICE HUNTRESS...I GET SENT TO YAMAOKA ESTATE. I WANT TO PRACTICE BILLY...I GET SENT TO TREATMENT THEATRE.
---
I heard him say anyone who uses NOED is a bad killer. So you hear what you want to hear 
---
I'm not even gonna bother, ur clearly rank 15.
---
It gives you a free third health state and the aura reading can be dodged by healing to 99%. It‚Äôs definitely a perk on the level of pre-2.6.0 DS. 
---
It is a skill check. Good survs don't get downed in open areas, in general. It isn't difficult to make sure you're near *something* before getting downed. And the stun time even with Enduring 3 is enough to get to *something* from anywhere as long as you're paying attention and have map knowledge. Especially with the recent buff to pallet #'s. There's so many on every map
---
*Quietly sits in the back*
---
Can only be used once
---
Goes into a pseudo-stalk mode where his heartbeat/terror radius vanish and folks will start hearing his "ki ki ki ki ma ma ma ma" sound.  Maybe his speed would be lowered while in that state.
---
Otherwise another idea is that when he's on the map multiple/different weapons can be found and picked up by him, allowing him to attack with different weapons that have different effects or styles.  
---
IF THE KILLER IS TUNNELING AT 5 GENS WITH RUIN STILL UP, THEN FUCK THOSE PEOPLE. BUT WHEN THERE'S 1 GEN LEFT WITH 4 SURVIVORS STILL ALIVE, THEN I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY KILLERS TUNNEL.

This is just a giant guess but it seems like BHVR wants games to last longer based off the pip changes. I know the main complaint is  that it could take 4 extra hits but maybe that's BHVRs goal - to extend games instead of a quick 4k match. If things are going poorly for survivors, this gives a respectable chance to change the tides and that keeps both sides contending to pip.
---
I don't have Ash so I don't entirely know how great the perk is but that's just my guess at what they want the direction the game to take based off their recent changes and releases. If this is the case (and I guess we will never know for sure) we need to keep that in mind when talking about perks like this. 
---
/useless opinion
---
&gt;Hybridpanda showed a clip earlier, takes a hit and MoM protects him, taps heal, takes 2 more to down. That's insane.¬†
---
Healing to 99% is unnecessary. You can heal to full with MoM up and then you will still take 3 hits. Healing to 99% makes only sense if you want to avoid a oneshot ability.
---
YES I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT FUCK TUNNELING AND FACE CAMPING 
---
Jesus what
---
I bet he also plays a lot of Deceased by Noon.

I know what you meant but I feel noed was a poor example to compare with.

I LOVE ASH. LOVED HIM SINCE EVIL DEAD. IM SUPER SIKED HES IN THE GAME AS A SURVIVOR..YOU KNOW WHAT PISSES ME OFF? BEING TARGETED BY EVERY BILLY, BUNNY, AND BUBBA IN THIS DAMN GAME JUST BECAUSE OF METTLE AND I DON'T EVEN USE METTLE!! 
---
I'd take out alert and exchange it for quick and quiet (for it to work with lithe) or urban evasion until you get to know the maps better (and play stealthy). Good luck! 
---
David King belongs to DBD, and he doesn't cost money. That doesn't make him a licensed character. Bill comes from Left for Dead, a different IP, he doesn't cost money but he is licensed because he's from a different IP. The difference is that BHVR didn't create Bill, which makes him a licensed character
---
When I read this I was like welll....perfection (insert magneto meme)
---
The person who I originally responded to who said it was ‚Äúhilarious‚Äù that people are excited for the character yet don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a quote from the show he ‚Äúcame from‚Äù. Like I get it‚Äôs based on show Ash but a lot of people are fans of Ash in general.
---
&gt;If I‚Äôm noticing something‚Äôs unfair there‚Äôs an issue.
---
&gt;I‚Äôd like to point out flaws to make the game better.
---
That's ultimately the two things you've said that make it clear that you believe there's a factual balancing issue, and that your opinion is more valid than theirs.
---
That's why you're hemorrhaging karma right now, not because you're speaking your mind or because nobody else has had issues learning to play against the Pig.
---
YES I KNOW THE KILLER HAS THIRD SEAL BUT YOU RAN OVER MY CRAWLING BODY 5 TIMES. I'M FUCKING 95% RECOVERED JUST PICK ME THE FUCK UP YOU WHORE. NO YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FROM THE KILLER THEY'RE 30 MILES BEHIND YOU YOU'VE GOT TIME TO PICK ME UP.

---
It's the D-Strike situation:
---
By itself, the perk isn't too bad. But when combined with other strong perks (Dead Hard, Adrenaline, DS, Sprint Burst, Borrowed Time, etc.), especially as part of an SWF group, it's a nightmare.
---
It wastes Killers time, something which Killers already struggle with, and has virtually no downsides for the Survivor.
---
Simply put, it needs nerfing NOW. 
---
I suggest making it an exhaustion perk. Taking the extra hit makes you exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds, or until you are downed. Possibly, it could not activate if you are exhausted, but that might be too far.
---
I want someone from Outlast man, I love those games.
---
Oh damn even I didn't notice that. 
---
Who needs pallets when you have crutches?
---
You have 3000+ hours, right? Roughly how many do you need experimenting with MoM before you feel like you have a good grasp on how it fits in with DBD gameplay? The mechanics behind it don't seem all that complex tbh. What are you unsure about specifically?
---
Mine is definitely Clementine from TWDG.
---
Dead hard works against all hits, works after the first hit, can be used multiple times a match, 40 second cooldown, and can be used to extend loops.
---
MoM requires too much set up and is killer reliant. You arent charging it up against huntress or billy. Charging it up against spirit/hag doesnt make them any less powerful, they will still down you pretty soon after. If anything all it does is make weak killers even weaker.
---
*"Not gonna bother"* meaning *"i have nothing to counter so I'll throw out some quick jibe about you being low rank, that'll show you!"*
---
An excellent retort my good man.
---
Makes sense to me.
---
Everyone can participate. It doesn't lock platforms.
---
True.
---
&gt; Been seeing allot of killers complaining of the new DS buff lol quit tunneling loser‚Äôs! 
---
...Where? Find me anyone complaining about making the stun 5 seconds
---
THATS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANNA RUN EVERY DAMN WHERE. YOU LEAVE SCRATCH MARKS, IDIOTS! THAT SECRET SPOT YOU RAN TO THAT YOU'RE SURPRISED THE KILLER FOUND YOU AT IS BECAUSE YOU RAN THERE LIKE A DUMMY THROWING YOUR BLOOD AND RUN MARKS AROUND. 
---
For a few weeks now I always use Aftercare + Distortion.
---
Aftercare helps me (solo survivor) and teammates organize and distortion gives lots of info about killer perks (BBQ, NC etc.)
---
For killer (mostly) Trapper I ran Terretorial Imperative for fun for a while and it super fun to see a survivor going into the basement, following him,  trapping the stairs and going down to him. It actually works more than I thought. 
---
Besides that Ruin is mvp on Trapper. Especially if you get a nice trappable totem spot
---
what's the difference?  the difference is this post isn't true because Bill is a licensed survivor and he doesn't have a blue collared shirt.  that's the post you clicked on... remember?
---
The 99% is just so you don't give away your aura. No point in showing the killer where you are. If they do find you then you just tap heal since aura is irrelevant at that point.
---
I just DC Haddonfield, the dev who designed it can go fuck himself.
---
OUT. IN. THE OPEN!
---
Actually, I think I will make one to go along with my Fucking Corn! shirt.
---
Well, I'm fucking blind so of course I've stepped in a trap and almost stepped in another one placed in a very visible way. But at least I rescued you :v
---
And so it‚Äôs known, i really wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a main of either side, I‚Äôm not a fan of identity politics in video games. I play around the same of both side but feel I perform better on the killer side and have less to perfect so I‚Äôd sooner say I‚Äôm a killer main. I only say it on the sub as it‚Äôs quicker to type, ‚Äúkiller main,‚Äù than explaining the whole thing, ya feel?
---
What if I don't like the killer tho? Why should I play in a match if I'm not going to have fun?
---
Wiggle DS was the strongest DS. You could pull it off normally on lots of maps like swamp and it just required one bodyblock for any other map. 
---
Yikes at yikesposting big guy
---
Pretty sure your aura is only shown after MoM actually triggered. 
---
Lol I could care less about karma. My question was answered. You can fuck off now. 
---
&lt;3
---
Same woulda been so damn sweet. I had said before that he could have lines in game as well. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm badddd Ash‚Äù
---
tru3 does not like NOED and thinks only bad killers use it. 
---
Ok, but what about all of the other writing in the game? You can def pick out sequences of broken english.
---
You sound mad.
---
Imma have to take you in sir/madam.
---
wT* ARE you talking about?????? IDIOT Get f*cking tissues if you get hooked, or even better GET GUD.
---
I dont mainly because i dont play the game enough to be able to use characters with each other‚Äôs perks but FUCK do i love feng min‚Äôs perks. 
---
I would agree if he only came into the game after the console versions of DBD were released. But since he was there before them: Yes he does count. Otherwise you would just leave him behind and thats not nice to do. 
---
It would be awesome. The deadites could be trying to feed (gens) and Ash could try and bury (hook). It could be a whole new game mode! 
---
That‚Äôs the problem, I‚Äôve hardly got to experiment with the perk due to hardly ever seeing it. The few times I have seen it (for the most part) have had little effect on the game but the survivors weren‚Äôt particularly great so I don‚Äôt find it fair to make my judgement based off of that. 
---
If I had to make a decision based off what I‚Äôve seen and done using the perk I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a A tier perk but not as game determining as some people have said it is. Again, haven‚Äôt played against a full team of it nor had a ton of use of it myself so this could change. 
---
You really think so? I've seen it proc in several games but it doesn't even buy them as much time as a DS stun. It's also severely weakened against any killer that doesn't always use regular hits. It's straight trash against plague for example
---
Survivor - quick and quiet, dance with me, lithe, self care/iron will.
---
Killer - devour hope, brutal strength, agitation, stridor.
---
I'm sure you could care less. No need to be hostile, I was directly answering your question.
---
 If you have a lot of problems with her, I'd highly recommend running Sprint Burst. It's also fantastic against the Wraith, Nightmare, and Cannibal.
---
PEOPLE DC WITH EVERYBODY. AFTER RANK CHANGES, PPL ARE SALTY.

That's completely fair, sorry about that.
---
WELCOME TO DEAD BY DAYLIGHT. ENJOY BECOMING A KILLER MAIN.
---
YEAH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A BUTTON TO DENY UNHOOKS FOR AWHILE NOW. THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO GET THE PERK DECISIVE STRIKE FROM LAURIE STRODE.
---
I didn't know I needed this in my life until now!
---
WHERE ARE THOSE 10 LOBBIES? I HAVE YET TO FIND ONE.
---
I am glad that they opted for a hook spawn and not for a hole in the fence to jump down. 
---
I like that there are areas with no easy ways out like this house or the garage in Gas Haven etc.
---
 I can't really get behind that, but I hear you.
---
You've definitely heard this on here, but you're giving them that ammo they wanted and limiting your map pressure. Ultimately, the game's not that serious, so if that's how you handle that, it's your call.
---
Thank you
---
Yeah, but most killers fail to reliably take advantage from it
---
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GET A FOURTH FUCKING SURVIVOR WHY DO WE HAVE TO SIT AS THREE FOR 10 MINUTES
---
Of the 3 perks you listed, Poised is the only good one. While killers have gotten one of the best perks in the game (spirit fury).
---
Anyone that would choose killer genuinely hates themselves. Early dbd was a living hell for killers lol
---
It was added months ago, sometime late last year I believe but as has already been said, it doesn't spawn all the time. Just like the abbatoir window, you only get a broken map 50% of the time.
---
I still remember when flashlights instantly blinded you, there were double pallets everywhere, and the pallet vortex (or whatever it was called) that teleported them to the other side of the pallet and avoided having them get hit. 
---
Every team game, for sure. I'm really hoping that someone sees this and it clicks for them, but I'll take just being glad I got my opinion on it out there for commentary.
---
I favour Killer and I'd have to disagree.
---
DS took more time away from you:
---
DS - chase, hit, chase, down, pick up, DS, 5-second stun, chase, down, pick up, hook.
---
MoM - chase, hit, chase, hit, chase, down, pick up, hook.
---
On top of this, MoM gives you less distance:
---
With MoM, you get the 2-second sprint after being hit amd Killer stops dead to wipe their weapon. This means you get 12m of distance.
---
With DS; you didn't sprint, but stunned the Killer for 5 seconds, though you couldn't move for the forst second. This gave you 16m of distance.
---
Finally, DS could be used on first down. This was extremely disruptive during the early game, when gens tend to go quickest. MoM requires you to first be hit 3 times before it activates. Thus, it is unlikely to come into play until the mid-late game.
---
You're most likely right. It's probably a float value instead of 4 bytes, and so can be something like 99.56% or something. They probably do that because the proximity to hooked survivors creates a need for a clock so the points can tick upwards, and so they were lazy with that part. Ideally, you'd use a 4-byte number that was moved up incrementally depending on a separate float value acting as a clock. 
---
Or maybe they just didn't want anyone getting gimped by the system by getting a 3.99% and not having the emblem incrementally tick up like it would at 4% 
---
Which, ironically, is exactly what happened to you. 
---
Sidney from Scream but i feel like Laurie and her are pretty similar (somehow)
---
lmao it's busted as fuck and everyone but the reddit troll survivor mains can admit to it.
---
I know what you mean but you can simply heal to full once your MoM is charged as well. You wont be seen. Then you will take 3 hits to go down. Only if you heal to full after that your aura will be seen.
---
It's value as a perk is low right now, post-blink Nurse gives no charges, someone said that Pig's dash gives no charges too. Makes you wonder how many "special" killer attacks that are m1 don't charge the perk. But if they do patch it to include those attacks then it's value will skyrocket in my eyes.
---
Just because ‚Äúmost‚Äù killers can‚Äôt do something doesn‚Äôt make something bad or a gimmick. Nurse isn‚Äôt a gimmick just because ‚Äúmost‚Äù people suck at her, she is still op.
---
&gt; Panda is normally an upbeat guy though but hes been ripping into this perk. It was quite surprising.
---
Yeah it seemed to tick him off and even DS didn't really do that. I'm just saying that his feelings in a game where he really wasn't playing well in general shouldn't be used as an argument against the perk.
---
Anyway, I mulled it over today and even though I haven't experienced it much yet in my games I've decided that it needs to be changed. As a rule the devs need to stop making perks that directly convert killer success to killer failure with no counter. It especially seems like it might be worse than DS when there's 3 or 4 of them in one match
---
Lmao it wasn‚Äôt anymore OP than NOED but that‚Äôs still in the game. I‚Äôm not trying to get into a debate (even though your post history says you love to stir drama) I‚Äôm just saying that the survivors are rightfully sick of losing all the good stuff they get.
---
Same here, killer just "speaks" to me more, and it's harder sometimes to see things in a way that isn't self-serving, but yeah I do try my best to check that at the door like I know you do. 
---
I legit only ever had my friend run distortion. took it out for BT since they are good at looping and wanted a perk that actually helps the team out.
---
What did you mean to say? 
---
I don't care if I give them ammo. I don't care if I'm "feeding into a cycle of hate" or whatever. These kinds of people would act exactly the same regardless of the situation. At least not until someone beats their ass IRL and even then I'd make a bet that they'd jump online from their hospital room to troll and feel like they're powerful and in control. 
---
People like this are just shitheads and they will always like act shitheads until their pathetic existence no longer walks this earth. I'll be that guy who reminds them that they are a shithead. 
---
Let the puppet mori killers by drowning them in a piss pan &gt;=]
---
The good ol' days, haha. No wonder I shifted more towards 70/30 survivor
---
nah, the other two are quite good as well. earlier today i remarked that survivors don't give a shit unless a perk is really, really strong and this is just more evidence of that
---
*BOOP*
---
Noed lmao
---
ah right. what i was asking though is when you get picked up by the killer do you choose to activate decisive strike and attempt the skill check or does it just immediately pop up and you have to use it then or never?
---
The locker icon its only for survivors.
---
THE PLAGUE HAS A VOICE LINE IN HER MORI (AND MAYBE EVEN IN THE LOBBY, I HEARD? I DON'T KNOW SINCE I DON'T PLAY HER), AND ASH HAS VOICE LINES IN THE LOBBY.
---
Glad this is happening to you, you sound very toxic and entitled hahaha. Came to Reddit to cry 
---
Tickles me how bothered this community is
---
You get unhooked with borrowed time
---
sometimes i do meme builds, and insidious basement leather face is my all time favorite. whenever i get overboard and stressed i play legion and just pick on survivors.(the guy's a farmer). this post is good to me. going in my saved folder
---
I really need to figure out which key clips my games. But knowing my luck i'll forget to upload my toxic plays anyway
---
I guess you're playing Legion
---
And the devs said noed wasn't broken
---
NEA
---
GIVE ME YOUR SCALP
---
It automatically pops up.
---
They could be trying to space out "content" since they just released Ash yesterday so they will probably one of the new cosmetics next Wednesday.
---
I've been running Boil Over, Flip Flop, Unbreakable and Tenacity for the past 2 days. Honestly, most Killers just pick you up instantly anyways, so you don't get much play from it, but when you do get slugged it feels good man. Even if they just leave you on the ground for like 10 seconds to chase off someone trying to Flashlight save or something, you can still escape occasionally. 
---
Couldn't play enough to see if MoM is that terrible but now that DS is gone killers really shouldn't complain about perks anymore.
---
Hey what is the perk that lets you find totems easier?
---
Many things have changed. Survivor &amp; Killer perks got buffed &amp; we recieved a new killer with 2 new survivors. 
---
Leader &amp; Prove thyself are better now but not game changing. Havent really noticed its effect in games. New survivor perks have generally been mediocre with the exception of Mettle Of Man.
---
DS was changed to be an anti-tunnel perk as opposed to a escape for free perk. It now activates 60 seconds after being unhooked &amp; cannot be dribbled meaning that tunneling a survivor actually has a risk. The stun lasts 5 seconds now &amp; it can only be used once.
---
The new killer is fun but been ranked mid tier. Her perks are pretty mediocre too. New generator perk is interesting but doesn't seem to be as effective as Ruin sadly.
---
Overall the game achieved decent balance with some QOL changes to perks like ruin &amp; BBQ but recently there has been a surge of controversy with the perk Mettle Of Man.
---
Mettle Of Man allows survivors to not be downed from a hit when in the injured state after being hit by 3 attacks from a killer. The only downside is that if you heal fully after using the perk, the killer will be able to permanently see your aura until they are within 16 m from you.
---
Some people argue that this perk is not OP as it doesn't work on half the killers due to their powers or attacks not adding charges to the perk. This is mainly for killers that have instant downs or the huntress hatchets. 
---
Others argue this perk is worse than DS. It really hurts M1 killers by providing survivors the ability to tank a free hit from them &amp; extending the chase. Personally, I'm not really a big fan of this perk as it seems to have little downside for a significant effect.
---
Well I fucking despise that the killers get whatever they want by complaining long and hard enough, if you really, genuinely, were a good killer, you wouldn‚Äôt need to complain about DS because it was easy to catch up with a hurt exhausted survivor. 
---
You saying ‚Äúthey can be sick of it all they want‚Äù is fucking stupid first of all. Second of all, the popularity of this game is gonna drop (even farther than it already has) if the survivors keep getting nerfed. You need 4 survivors for a game, you don‚Äôt need anymore than 1 killer. Due to that, you guys are a dime a dozen and not needed as much tbh. 
---
A lot of the perks were not changed for good reasons (unless you consider bitching and moaning from baby killers good reason) Many of the features nerfed were not ‚Äúobjectively broken. The killers complained, so they got what they wanted, simple as that. And to be honest it does seem rough to a survivor, you see all these great killers getting rolled out. Awesome backstories, great perks, buffs, and subpar survivors over and over and over. Hopefully this new guy will be an exception. It‚Äôs funny that you say we have entitlement when the survivors rarely get what they want, and the killers get anything boy complaining enough. I‚Äôm sure if you got a good enough group of people and an average argument against it, you could get Deja Vu removed. 
---
Great choice!
---
It's fine. Leader and Prove Thyself were never "game over" for killers anyway
---
I think it‚Äôs a situational perk and going to encourage more Billy players to come out of the woodworks to counter it if it becomes meta like DS was. Idk how I feel about it yet because i don‚Äôt have that much experience with it.
---
I‚Äôd say in the right hands it will become a ridiculous perk. But for like 90% of all survivors on this game, it will just be a wasted use of a slot.
---
60 seconds is a long ass time in this game. From time to time I manage to down the unhooker, hook him, find the ex-hookee, try to pick him up, get DSed, shrug it of and then rehook him. 
---
I am not abandoning that chase, just because BBQ does not tell me who is who. But I am quite often surprised. "Whoa... he got unhooked less than 60 seconds ago ? Fellt like 2 minutes already."
---
Thats the same with killers? Thats just how the game works. Pop goes the Weasel is strong, but not strong enough worth the perk slot because Ruin is just better. Knock Out is strong but not strong enough to be worth the perk slot. Agitation is strong but not strong enough to be worth the perk slot. Its basically just 6-7 perks that are strong enough to use (BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Ruin, Monitor, Whispers, Nurses)
---
Aftercare is mediocre because the trade off of seeing auras map wide is that it goes away when either of you get hooked. Against any killer thats worth their salt its not anymore useful than Empathy or Bond.
---
Deliverance requires set up and doesnt activate if you dont get a safe unhook. There are games where you get chased first or downed before you can go for a safe unhook. Even after all of that it still has a downside of Broken for 60 seconds. Its very niche and situational. The situations where its powerful dont happen enough to use it over something simple like Unbreakable.
---
BHVR should focus on buffing complete garbage perks (Left Behind, Overwhelming/Unnerving, Technician, Play with Your Food) than just releasing new content. Theres only so much new content can do. Actually changing up the meta by making trash perks worth using would do more than any chapter patch has done.
---
It's funny how much the game has changed in just under a year. We're a hair's breath from a year since they separated from Starbreeze. 
---
They still have a ways to go. I like that they're not listening to the shitheads who are crying about Legion. At least for now. We just need dedicated servers, secondary objectives to slow them down, and fix some of the absolute worst maps like Haddonfield and Disturbed Ward. Specifically those two maps. 
---
Justin Bieber, then I won‚Äôt care when I die, I‚Äôll just enjoy watching him suffer
---
Disagree as a mostly solo player. There's a noticeable difference when someone has Leader on. In particular, I had a game where it allowed us to get the gate open just quickly enough to escape
---
Lee would probably fit better in the game.
---
He's pretty badass, he literally pushed through an entire herd of walkers to get to Clem.
---
~~Plus he's also dead unlike Clementine~~
---
Love the guide !! Thanks for putting it together. Of course we all have different opinions, and that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm mastered Hag and Trapper. Everyone says Hillbilly is pretty easy yet I struggle every time. I‚Äôm always running into trees, every time I try to chainsaw a survivor up close they spin circles around me and I go zooming into a wall, I turn around and I‚Äôm being T bagged. Not a great feeling. The problem is I always rank up 3 and 5 as killer usually. 
---
So when I try to dabble with a new killer like say Hillbilly, I get completely rekt and learned nothing and just get frustrated. I sometimes wish I could go back to rank 20 and learn the killers I struggle with. 
---
I'd play the shit out of this mode. Streamers do this anyway.
---
You run Whispers on basically every high tier Killer: Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Huntress etc. It's the best tracking perk in the game.
---
Good thing I use franklins demise regularly.
---
Yes... bring them into the Entity's realm !
---
&gt;Seems like a dude like ash wouldn't beable to keep a lid on something like that
---
Not being able to keep a lid on anything is what started the whole series if I remember correctly.
---
Small game
---
People say heal to 99% to avoid the freddy esque aura reading downside. It seems like too much work to try and do, especially since the killer can just leave you. If anything it will just make insta heals more obnoxious. 
---
People are overrating MoM, all it does is make weak killers weaker, and slightly hinders Spirit/Hag/Nurse (if it wasnt bugged). Myers, Legion, Billy, Huntress, Plague wont have to worry about this perk almost at all.
---
Yeah, it's like... why would I chase you if you actually want to get chased, lmao. I was in a game once as Freddy, two dead, a Dwight and a Meg left, and both were asleep. This Meg was a legacy Meg, with bright cosmetics on for the slots that weren't legacy. I knew beyond a doubt she had DS. She kept teabagging at pallets and stuff whenever I would get close to her. There were two gens left to do, and they were trying to 99% them and pop them at once so I wouldn't have time to react (that's how I found them, doing a gen). Anyway, I knew that if I chased her, the Dwight would get both gens done and I would probably lose (she probably had Adrenaline too, I forgot). I kept just staring at her... and then ignoring her, ping-ponging between them both so those two gens weren't getting done.
---
The Meg got so annoyed she literally DC'd just so the Dwight would get the hatch.

Xmen first class. It's from when Magneto meets Mystique. She changes to a bunch of different girls then she turns to her natural blue and then he says perfection. This was supposed to show how Magneto wasnt ashamed or tried to hide her.

Feral Frenzy
---
So use sloppy and franklins demise and fuck their world up.
---
Or cheating out cheeto cosmetics, thats a serious offense boyo.
---
Fuck.
---
I heard it mentioned on quite a few podcasts and thought it was called "shutter".
---
ah ok thx
---
there is a bug on PC where all survivors DC at the same time.
---
Everyone does that lel
---
im kinda scared ill get banned
---
&gt;ebony moris still exist
---
&gt;completely busted very rare/ultra rare add ons still exist
---
&gt;omega blink nurse/insta saw billy still exists
---
Survivors get one perk that is just a weaker dead hard that you have to work for, everyone complains. Wow it only took 4 DLC releases for survivors to finally get ONE perk that is worth running. What will we ever do?
---
Imagine getting this upset that someone spun in a circle in a video game

Weird flex but okay

Omg so funny dood xddddddddd
---
I think we've done a pretty good job so far.
---
At the very least, this is a conclusion to Ash‚Äôs story that Bruce is alright with.
---
You can heal to 99% and then heal when you enter chase to counteract this
---
IMPLEMENT A BUTTON THAT LETS US DENY BEING SAVED OFF A HOOK!
---
Not even remotely the same as killers dodging lobbies. You dont even think of the remaining survivors? Or do you 4man swf and you all leave? You could, idunno learn how to play the game and maybe thete wouldnt be a matchup you dont like. 
---
This right here is when the killer messages you in lobby saying, ‚Äúfarm?‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs. A. Joke. 
---
Watch the first two-three episodes and you‚Äôll get it. 
---
lol you represent the worst of killer entitlement when you contribute to the mob of killers deadest on ruining all good survivor perks. 
---
Believe it or not I‚Äôm pretty good at killer, when I‚Äôd play killer I‚Äôd either A go for other people for the start. B deal with it and kill them again in the 7 seconds it takes to recover from the stun and kill them again, or C juggle because it‚Äôs a good choice in a lot of situations. You know what else is a lot of loss of momentum? NOED, it allows the killers to go around the map quicker, and drop people in 1 shot, which completely kills any momentum the unlucky door openers are, and anyone around the doors in general. Oh and it was commonly the case a chase would last for 5-20 seconds more because of decisive. It wasn‚Äôt long, 20 seconds is generous. The issue right now is a lack of players, they are getting killers back and losing survivors. And a lot of survivors are becoming killer mains because they want to play a class that gets all the good shit and usually wins. 
---
Baby if you want to talk about teleporting lemme tell you that the bullshit of letting killers host since the game‚Äôs BIRTH. You know what‚Äôs broken? Killing all four people before second hook. Having unlimited T3 on Michael, Killing people immediately as Michael. Single shotting people with hatchets. Like my guy if we‚Äôre talking about addons there‚Äôs quite a few that killers have that need a debuff. And finally, not being able to drop the pallet half the time and getting hit through vaults is much shittier than teleporting once in a while. 
---
Yeah it basically counters getting slugged as long as you aren't downed right next to a hook.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs too perfect to be a cover up. Calling Feng an alone wolf is a fuck up, calling Ash an alone wolf is a cheeky reference.
---
BHVR has always given far more leeway to survivors which is why survivors have been getting buffed for the last 5 chapter releases and killers keep getting nerfed. 
---
Wait a second...
---
I mean I don't really see the issue, that "bug" which btw hasn't been confirmed enables the playstyle they always imagined legion would use. Go around find a bunch of people go around stabbing people like a maniac then use the time the other survivors have to spend mending to go chase after 1 with their massively reduced downing power.
---
As is now if they're not using the addon "bug" they just put on franks and moonwalk you to death which offers 0 counterplay, isn't super effective for the legion, isn't fun for either party and is all but forced if you want to actually win/have any semblance of fun as legion.
---
Worst case scenario the legion abuses the "bug" and plays him as the devs intended to be played and you all stay injured and loop his 110% movement speed ass like normal.
---
Ah wait man I misspoke, it was ohtofu's podcast I was talking about.
---
Hexy did a caller session with viewers after it, and I was on it.
---
i do homework when im hooked lol
---
From my knowledge, it's impossible to depip below rank 15. Ranks 20 to 15 are the safe ranks where most new players reside but after that, you should be able to derank.
---
 
---
So, all the other M2 attacks makes sense. giving a built in counter to nurse yet again is......... questionable though.
---
So getting hit is a challenge now? You are defending a perk that rewards bad play, but oh well i guess survivors will always need their crutches.
---
FIX THE DAMN SERVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You forgot about bill
---
It's not wrong to want things out of life.
---
Imagine that counterplay... oh well not much of an issue for me anyways I just slug them when I know they have ds up.
---
This is EXACTLY how i felt! 
---
My very first match was super intense because I had no idea what I was doing. I was the last one out and had several close calls with the killer. They never saw me because I managed to stay just out of their sight, but my God they got close.
---
All my matches last night.
---
Nope the game counts it as a power only get it if she floats up to you and smacks you normally.
---
Nice set up, man!
---
I have a video of it on my YT channel, but I don't think I can make a link on mobile. I've never tried.
---
So what happens to the other half of the cast? Just fuck‚Äôem right, holy shiet these survivors mains are wild.
---
Yes, i agree as a fellow survivor that all survivors should be louder. Much louder-adjusts cheap survivor mask- oh and um delete legion and noed and all things survivors, which I am fully support, as the survivor that I am..-clears throat to hide terror radius sounds- 
---
Happened to me twice since Plague dropped. I had to re verify my files both times.
---
If he catches you he puts you in a sleeping bag and drags you to a hook. He cant be flashlight stunned and you cant wiggle free. His hooks have campfires under them to roast the survivor. 
---
He ignores pallet stuns and survivors are always exposed. 
---
/s obviously.
---
What they *really* oughta do is make a dropdown walk-off on that top balcony and then put a hook below it so you can nuclear dunk survivors onto the hook, kinda like on that one Macmillan map.
---

AWAKEN MY MASHTERS 
---
MATCH PEOPLE UP RANDOMLY! WHO CARES ABOUT CRYBABIES THAT GET UPSET ABOUT PLAYING HIGHER LEVEL PLAYERS! IT'S MUCH BETTER THEN WASTING AWAY IN LOBBIES!!!!!
---
I've been using it and watching people use it and also going against it and my early impressions is that it is quite powerful and likely to become meta. I'm going to wait to see how it turns out though.
---
THE GREEN RANKS ARE A FUCKING NIGHTMARE FOR SOLO SURVIVORS ANS KILLERS ALIKE. THERE IS ZERO CONSISTENCY ACROSS SURVIVOR SKILL LEVELS.
---
RANKING WAS NEVER THE BEST INDICATOR OF SKILL BUT AT LEAST IT WAS BETTER THAN THE HUGE BUCKET OF MISMATCHED PLAYERS WE HAVE NOW.
---
Because Id facecamp just to look at them pretty bois
---
It wastes both the killers and other survivors items and offerings. Sure, crashing, lagging out, or wifi randomly turning off is a problem but they shouldn't just dc soon as they load in if it's a 3v1. 3v1 it just depends if everyone would rather just die or if they want to play the game. If others are doing gens, you shouldn't dc. 2v1 and 1v1? Just DC. You waste your time staying in game wether or not killer wants to farm.
---
That's painfully specific
---
I swear someone made a similar meme around the ptb.
---
How many survivors are there? 4, meaning all 4 can use an op perk and multiply it‚Äôs effective use. You survivors already have it easy can you idiots at least take some challenge for once.
---
good luck getting randoms to do totems if your playing solo. good luck getting them to even do gens. If I broke all the totems instead of doing gens I'd never escape again unless my team was godlike.
---
I think it's more a personality thing, like he doesn't really view the actions in the game as totally separate to the person. Like, he's not super mad, but he's like "alright, I see you, and I'm in there. Enjoy."
---
I've seen people bleed salt over this kind of thing, and I don't think he's that far in.
---
Link it  when you are on pc! would be cool to see!
---
I had worst I had a pig with the fastest reaction time and almost always pulled out from it until I got ded ard and jumped in while they were suffering a cool down I was jumping into the hatch
---
*laughs in Nurse*
---
i wouldn‚Äôt quite say it‚Äôs dead, i can find a server in 30 seconds on xbox
---
find out which ones done with this shit
---
I mean monto already used insta heals to great effect with it so it's not that insane
---
Unless the addons specifically say DOESN'T STACK then it stacks, has always been that way, still is. More to the point though the addons aren't the point, the playstyle legion players use while using that addon combination is how the developers intended legioned to be played. The problem with doing that normally is without the addons 16 seconds of meding isn't even enough time to get to the next person to stab them in frenzy. Thats why it doesn't work properly normally, ironiclly this bug actually brings the killer closer to how the devs intended him to be played.
---
Lol youre sensitive af my guy
---
Oh well, perk is a crutch anyways.
---
I'm actually not against perks that give a survivor ***team*** a second chance. For example when a 5 blink nurse slugs the entire team, it's game over for survivors. Unbreakable stops that. Likewise a basement camping Billy or LF can end the game, but New DS or Borrowed Time stop that.
---
In those situations I've seen it time and time again where it's game over for the team. I think perks that give survivors a way out of those situations to keep the game going can be a good thing.
---
Old DS and this....they're just awful perks. They do nothing but artificially extend chases and make the game really unfun for the killer. They can pop on any number of survivors at any time and completely unbalance the game.
---
If a "free hit" perk was to be introduced I'd rather have it come into play when 2 survivors are hooked, or 1 out of 3 remaining. I don't know exactly, but something that helps keep the team alive when a rampaging billy or nurse is on a slug/hook spree, but not something that will be used every all the time every game by 4 survivors at any point.
---
Monto apparently has infinite he uses them like candy
---
to an extent I agree, but in this context it was about deranking and he sees no problem with it because he has more fun at lower ranks and doesn't exactly care about whoever else's fun he may ruin along the way either through deranking or noobstomping lesser experienced players than him.
---
Lol this is a joke right?  Not confirmed?  Check youtube for proof dawg.
---
I mean in fairness the same thing applies to killer builds using iri heads and stuff.
---
Which is not to say I disagree with you.
---
It doesn't work against the killers you would need it the most.
---
we dont get it either. 
---
That actually makes a ton of sense. Kind of goes along with the "they're only optimizing so they can get it ported to the switch" theory.
---
Mastering him involves not spamming Frenzy and stunning yourself trying to catch survivors. It means, not relying on Franks Mix Tape to do the dirty work. It means not falling for easy to avoid jukes and punishing survivors for trying to loop you. 
---
He‚Äôs close to being easy to master but he‚Äôs just only reaching the tip of intermediate due to the fact that I have come across many dumb Legions who are making easy to avoid mistakes. 
---
Crutch perks would be fine if there wasn't 5 of them. Iron will and urban evasion are better than crutch perks anyways
---
My man, I see what you're doing, I don't approve, but let's play this out:
---
You need to be SOAKED in that good D-Strike blood. Get anything post 2.6.0 out of my fucking face, we're looking for that old money P3. You can also dress like a glowstick, or wear a bright wig, but that shit needs to be about $10 or more.
---
You find that killer, you actively teabag and click whenever they can't get to you, and you lead a 2 minute chase through the most heinous areas you can find. (Rancid Abattoir, Ironworks of Misery, and Myers' House come to mind.)
---
You do all of that, and I promise, you're either getting a free 'he's not worth it' pass as long as you aren't within 12 meters of the killer, or a meaty facecamp seasoned with hook hitting BM and post-game salt.
---
Ahh okay
---
Here‚Äôs the difference maker- iridescent heads directly counter mettle of man. 
---
I run small game all the time and count the totems as I make my rounds around the map, I‚Äôve saved my ass and teammates so many times from NOED and that‚Äôs playing solo. But there have been times we get fucked over. 
---
DS was a 4 second stun before and it took 1 second to get off the shoulder so 3 seconds to run MOM gets u further than DS use to
---
such a face roll killer
---
2 things. First, I WILL tell you that I don't rage quit for any reason because my valuing my own time over others does not hinder my capacity to be considerate of others. And second, if you tilt at a game in which the built in mechanics allow a killer to hunt you down and remove you from the game by whatever means they choose, this game may not be for you.
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt even know about that. Thanks !

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a bit closer to 1.5 than that. 1 million gets you to around 40 if you get good bloodweb spawns and past that is between 35-50k bp per web. 
---
As someone who has never played another killer besides Legion, I have to say, his biggest weakness is map pressure. The way BHVR wants you to play him "Stabby stab many people to make them mend" is unrealistic and does more harm, then good. Good Legions know to just tunnel, cause thats what he excels at. That being said, he cannot control the map as well as pretty much any other killer, imo. His ability while being able to confirm a downed survivor on the first hit (if the legion isnt a potato) makes chases guaranteed to be in legions favor, while unfortunately lasting longer then they should (w/o mixtape). This leaves the other survs plenty of time to get through with gens, leaving legion without much of a way to stop em (besides a good 'ol annoying ruin)
---
In terms of counterplay, sadly, if youre seen by a legion, and he knows how to play him, youre being hooked. You cant escape a legion, or even loop a legion for too long once he hits you with Frenzy. If he has bloodhound, and ground stares/moonwalks your ass, you might as well just run in a straight line as long as you can to prolong the inevitable. (while it may seem like a good idea, dont try to use pallets, or windows when youre being ground stared/moonwalked. Youll make the chase even shorter).
---
WHY THE FUCK IS IT THAT PLAYING A ROUND OF KILLER NETS THE PLAYER MORE BP THEN PLAYING SURVIVOR GETTING ALL FUCKIN IRIDESCENTS!!!! HATE IT WHEN I ESCAPE AND GET A MEASLY 8000 BP FOR ALL OF MY FUKIN EFFORTS!!! BUT LO AND BEHOLD, PLAY KILLER FOR MY DAILYS, HERES 30,000 BP FOR DICKING AROUND THE WHOLE MATCH!!!! REEEEEEEE
---
It‚Äôs the only reason I use it. The tracking feature is nice but like you said it‚Äôs just not reliable. So the tracking feature is just cherry on top for me. If I ever get done with grinding bloodpoints, I‚Äôll likely use Whispers or Discordance instead.
---
Your puppet will make a groovy addition to my collection.

HE'S FROM ANTARCTICA
---
Everyone keeps asking for Jason but NEVER knows what his power would be. I really enjoy making up hypothetical killer powers so how about:
---
The Drowned.
---
Power: Mother's Wrath.
---
The Drowned has a supernatural link to his long passed Mother, and when he thinks of her, enters a deadly rage.
---
The Drowned is 115% movement speed by default, using his power however slows him down to 110% movement speed.
---
While the power is active, The Drowned ignores stuns and his pallet break speed is 50% faster. The Drowned also recovers from successful attacks 25% faster while the power is active.
---
Last 30 seconds and can not be cancelled upon activation, has a 45 second cool down.
---
UPVOTED BECAUSE CAKE DAY
---
I would say 1.6 million, 1 million gets you to level 38

hmm. *purses lips* nearleh.

What if the killer doesn't slug you and you wasted 3 perk slots for nothing? Or if they do, but 50% wiggle time isn't enough to stop you going on the hook? Or they do drop you, one time, but you only have one perk left to help you stay alive when you're up and running around?
---
I love haddonfield, im a Balanced landing gamer! i love how thicc it is. way better then preschool/the game
---
Just 99% your heal with self care or a buddy. Then you just heal in chase when you might get caught and bam. Extra health state.
---
Or use the multitude of perks with an extra chance after getting hit like borrowed time or decisive
---
Only if we get John Astin to voice Dr. Gangreen

I love how this guys got downvoted for saying the game has become less enjoyable recently, like the constant crashing and bugs are not making the game worse lmao
