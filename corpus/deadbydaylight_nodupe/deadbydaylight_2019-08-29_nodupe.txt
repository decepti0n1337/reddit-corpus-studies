&gt;Why that heck would you waste your time writing a flipping essay if it's not helpful to anyone? If you want to write a long comment do it on a post that is asking for advice, not one that's just a joke.
---

---
I don't see it as an essay, I just like to write. Half the time I don't even notice how big the text got until I send it. I am sorry if writing can be hard or painful for you.
---
Lmao, names a joke Im a feng main on survivor. And still these perks are severely over powered
---
Fast games are just bot games tbh. Either you down and one hook some AI running around in the middle of nowhere or you hold M1 and occasionally get a skillcheck. No real skill on either side.

...wow... If u can't stand all that kind of talk then if ur on PS4/Xbox disable messages from anyone but friends, if ur on PC leave the end game chat before u see a message.
---
This made me chuckle
---
No, noed doesn’t activate in that case. It only activates if there’s a dull totem when the last gen pops. If hay ted grounds gets cleansed after the last gen pops the other totem becomes a dull totem and not noed

As a Legion main, I can confirm this.
---
Even if there were confirmation on the blood point event the orb still lasts two weeks. Atleast it has in the past. And to make sure they get everything right i doubt they would shorten the time of a ptb. They would extend it to make netflix happy. To make sure everything is running smoothly. Granted ptb still might come out this week. But no guarantee.

You don't have an item

I see a 3k and a disconnected player
---
Your just a bad killer lol. I can usually 3k as killer without Ruin in red ranks. On a far buggier plat form. Tunneling really isn’t effect it’s just being a whiny bitch honestly. Imagine if in the killer movies the main survivor, Take Laurie Strode, were chased by Michael the entire movie. Some shoots him or stands in his way? Doesn’t matter, ItS mOrE eFfEcTiVe To GeT pErSoN tHaT i HiT fIrSt. I believe you probably think tunneling is good because from day one you played as killer you’ve probably never been good at it. You’ve also probably never played as survivor as you wouldn’t know the feeling of being tunneled. But then again, you are a person that says T-bagging is more toxic then tunneling or camping, cause it’s “effective”.
---
IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUST RANK PROGRESSION. THEY ARE THESE RECTANGULAR THINGIES THAT YOU SEE IF YOU HOVER OVER YOUR RANK (FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU JUST HIT LETS SAY RANK 9, YOU'LL SEE 5 EMPTY SMALL CIRCLES BELOW YOUR RANK. A PIP IS MEANT TO GO IN ONE OF THESE CIRCLES) 
---
AT THE END OF EVERY MATCH, DEPENDING ON YOUR PERFORMANCE AND WHAT KIND OF EMBLEMS/MEDALS/WHATEVER THESE THINGS ARE, YOU WILL EITHER LOSE 2 PIPS (PRETTY MUCH ONLY IF YOU DC), 1 (IF YOU PLAY BADLY OR DIE EARLY AS SURVIVOR), 0 (WE CALL THIS SAFETY PIP, YOU DIDNT PROGRESS YOUR RANK BUT YOU DIDN'T REGRESS IT EITHER), OR YOU WILL GAIN 1 OR 2 IF YOU PERFORMED WELL AND GOT A BUNCH OF IRIDESCENT MEDALS.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cwt5r0/are_protection_hits_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It’s a crutch. It essentially rewards the killer for failing and punishes the survivor for succeeding.  
---
The counter to it is cleansing all dull totems. Easier said than done, specially on solo queue where you have to rely on teammates to cleanse as well. Besides, the perk has absolutely no drawback for the killer: either survivors waste time doing dull totems (beacuse of the possibility of the killer having NOED)  or they get exposed during the endgame, either way, the killer profits, and both profits are very strong.
---
Yaaa, you don't wanna go down that road ya
---
I should have wait a little more instead of buying Legion...
---
Thank you!
---
look above son
---
Not true. Once one Haunted Grounds totem is cleansed the perk activates, which erases the HG from the other trapped totem, making it dull again. They could cleanse 3 dulls and a HG and NOED would activate when the last gen is complete.
---
Why she look old and young at the same time tho?

I was looking for one more perk but alright lol, I think I’ve tried something similar to what you suggested, I’ll still try it though

The only thing about Billy is his add-ons are kinda broken tbh

It would be amazing! Maybe a Pablo like cosmetic. Even a Kelly one perhaps as well.

r/woooosh

THE FUCKING JAPANESE KILLERS THAT ARE INSANELY POPULAR NOW FOR SOME REASON AND RUIN MY LOBBIES BECAUSE I GET BAD PING SINCE THEY LIVE 50 YEARS AWAY
---
Nah bro best perk in the game is Unrelenting obviously
---
[deleted]
---
No drawbacks? they have to uses up 1 perk slot for the whole game until the end.
---
I was thinking this was a MHA meme so he was going to say all might
---
Every single end game perk...
---
Escape wasnt an escape this time
---
I know what you mean. I'll chase someone to a window, having not used my power or an attack at all in like 10 seconds, hit M1 to smack them at the window and NOTHING happen. Click a few times... NOTHING. 
---
Mid chase, click when I'd hit them, NO ATTACK, then the get distance for a pallet when I would have downed them. It gets infuriating.
---
JUST COZ I HAVE IW DOESNT MEAN I DONT NEED HEALING FUCKING HEAL ME AFTER I HEALED U SRSLY U EVEN SAW ME BEING INJURED

Is the demogorgon an actual killer?

GhostFace got extra cosmetics, so we can hope!

I made a comment about this on a different post.

I feel like I had some part in this but I know better than that.
---
Drag Race and DBD are my two obsessions; and it seems to be the case with a lot of the gays. After all the crossover memes I’ve seen, I can’t wait for the inevitable DBD runway theme.
---
&gt;I was looking for one more perk but alright lol, I think I’ve tried something similar to what you suggested, I’ll still try it though
---
If thats the case, I would go with Borrowed Time to make guaranteed safe rescues.
---
Sadly I haven't... But I have run into an individual, usually plays Claudette called either "Mercy Main" or "Mercy Main btw". Can't remember exactly.
---
They're great. Saved me so many times and I've saved them too to return the favour. If you run into them, just know you're in good hands.
---
You may have given me the idea ;)
---
I just want the demogorgon himself in his own icons. I hope the power icon is like that.
---
I still don't understand how it takes "too long" it takes the exact same amount of time from the team as being healed, instead of two survivors sitting there for a heal for 16 seconds, it's one survivor sitting there to heal for 32 seconds, same with sloppy butcher.
---
Dude man this is just as good as getting Rick rolled
---
Batteries
---
The DC button is free!
---
It would actually be faster to farm bloodpoints and spend them on Hag
---
I can't think of a legit reason why they don't just say yeah make whatever cosmetics you want within reason.
---
The proximity where the auras stop being shown to the killer really make it a bit harder to avoid, or pick up traps sometimes... I play a lot of Trapper, and still get fucked by the auras.
---
Top ten anime betrayals
---
Probably not because it will reduce even more the pool of players queuing in each region. The problem with matchmaking is available survivors vs available killers. 
---
P2P allows players to play with people from neighbor countries while maintaining a decent ping depending on how fair they live. With servers if you want to play with against a player from other country, one of the two will probably be laggy and dodge that lobby.
---
Hell nawww, to the naw naw
---
Oof
---
You know he was salty
---
Actually they were more like *white screen*
---
Survivors can counter it by dropping pallets earlier. It's certainly powerful but not too powerful.
---
Remember me, a staple in any end game build, was nerfed into the ground to make way for the egc
---
Haha git gud noob
---
While we're at it let's get rid of those damn cornfields
---
Okay but most survivors I play against don't seem to know that
---
It's showing the discount you get if you buy the full outfit.
---
When you start the match make sure to do the point emote so you dont waste your time in the match
---
Where's the lie though?
---
Bwhahah but I don’t use sprint burst

for an old lady, she's damn fine.

It happens when you're playing with high ping.

&gt;Lol, right. It really is broken based on the vast number of people experiencing this issue. Thanks for providing more evidence. You’re great!
---
Its not necessarily broken. Perhaps the search is being widened to reduce queue time, working as any matchmaking would. If they remove this, people complain nonstop about queue times.

The Stranger Things chapter is getting released in September.

*let her face*
---
Come on, Dean and Sam have killed so many monsters, it is highly unlikely they wouldn't be able to beat the living shit out of the creatures that DbD has.
---
Though a perk in where one of the brothers gets to Mori the killer would be pretty awesome.
---
Cigarettes are a hell of a drug...
---
A bit of context: Was BMing the pig with my FL at the edge of the gate. FL expires (my fault) and at soon as it does I leave the gate.. But not really I just run outside then back in the out. the killer can see me so can my teammates. and I end up dying. 
---
p.s. Ignore the scuffed mic
---
p.s.s I don't know what that figure was under the map but it looked player sized
---
Thank you, I didn't know there is a sale right now!
---
no, its not xbox its just dbd itself, everytime i play with a friend it does this
---
No you're not but it's sad that people do. Never gonna get gud if you don't even try.
---
You know that soon they're setting it up where you can't tell if it is SWF or not. Besides, if SWF makes you miserable, you're playing like garbage. SWF groups are the easiest to deal with especially since they tend to be overly altruistic and easily predictable.
---
I just couldn’t capture that Steve buscemi put through the garbage disposal look quite right :(
---
I dont understand why people get so upset about it, yes it happens but I cant be countered by doing totems and if people really are still mad they could just make turn it back to what it was when there was no time or way to get rid of it.
---
God I’ve never heard them referred to like that, that’s pretty good haha
---
If they added a totem counter to small game or maps it’d make it tolerable as a solo
---
Good rant
---
A little better on pc but no need to take it easy that's not the point of the game.

Anytime I play LF and don't facecamp the survivors I play against go out of their way to be toxic and bully me, sucks that this happened to you though it isn't impossible to do well on wraith just a bit difficult so I don't see the point in facecamping you like that
---
I swear that's me. I'm trying not to be Toxic, but honestly, to some survivors it's even toxic when you KILL people as a KILLER.
---
You realise an art or cosmetics team will work on cosmetics and a different team works on the general game health. The art or cosmetic team isn’t just going to do nothing simply because there are bugs in the game. They still have to do their job regardless.
---
Hey one of those is mine credit when you steal! /s
---
Don’t forget, DC’ing cuz you don’t like a killer makes you a scumbag 🤠
---
I agree.
---
You do know that the people that make skins aren't the same ones who fix bugs right? They're not taking resources from one department and putting them elsewhere.

Sorry dad.

Not going to lie, I was getting my ass kicked. They popped all the gens and I had NOED on Legion. So I down one, hook them, and just wait to see who tries to rescue. Got them all.
---
I tried to show this to my nephew. Now I hate you.
---
There were 3 flash lights this match and it felt like I was being Rick-rolled for a second.
---
I play bubba without doing that meme build and can 100% confirm you get those toxic messages even if you leave hook as soon as you put someone on it, people just hate killers and hate baby boy bubba

As a Rank 20 killer with maybe 10~ hours played, I don't think this is true at all based on the fact I've seen Rank 10+ Survivor's lul. Maybe the first hour you play or something but matchmaking is definitely broken.
---
I've been to red ranks. Ranks don't mean shit. 70% of survivors are dumb as shit
---
delete, reinstall
---
"you're in my farm now..."
---
I always see complaints about frame rate drops, but I’ve never experienced it in all the time I’ve played this game, am I just lucky af or what?
---
Nope nope nope nope nope nope
---
Frame rate is more dependant on the hardware in your system than your internet, that's why you can have shit FPS on PC but when you upgrade the parts it'll be better. Can't do much about consoles though since they aren't nearly as easy to mess with the hardware as PC

Its New Line and stuff. The licenses with the Nightmare franchise are constantly being pulled or not renewed, so no one can do anything with them, basically. Plus, Wes craven passed away in 2015, and according to some sources, he wanted the nightmare series to end for a long time (like, before new nightmare). That’s why there aren’t going to be any more Robert England as Freddy content, and most likely, not much new content for it in the near future.

---
Don’t forget that your aura is revealed to the killer if you’re inside the exit gate, so make sure to stay outside of it until the exit opens!
---
For what killer? Just a general build? Your gens are gonna get hit hard and devour hope will be a total RNG crap shoot.
---
Personally I’d replace bitter for Ruin or PGTW and id say it be a decent build.
---
If they make it so you can't tell who is SWF even more killer mains will stop playing the game. DbD treats Killers like crap.

Killer goes Level 1 - Weapon, Level 2 - Body, Level 3 - Head.
---
Survivor goes Level 1 - Torso, Level 2 - Legs, Level 3 - Head.
---
In my opinion, it is resoundingly meh. Outside of prestige 3 Claudette who is virtually invisible in dark areas and the very mild "intimidation" factor that you might get against new players, it's just up to you if you like the bloody cosmetics or not. I got the weapons for all the killers but I only got the full outfits for Pig, Myers, Freddy and Leatherface since I figured licensed killers would never get cosmetics, even though Pig now has her awesome leather jacket..
---
So.. people DC to prove a point. By wasting their own time and not get any points. While the killer gets to move on and get quiter points. And, your team mates most likely have a harder time and less points... Really shows that killer..?

Yup, it is heavily based on Brightman and Dark Dizzy (megaman) and somewhat on Jinzo:
---
“Mankind it’s rotten at it’s core , do you think those first world countries would be as peaceful as they are if they had to live what we do?” was regularly said by Dr. Santiago, a brilliant robotics researcher and a misanthrope, always a loner he was never able to really get to know people, most of his interactions with other humans were through the web or by reading the news: Crime, impunity, corruption, stupidity, every day it was the same. the hatred corroded his mind day by day, he hated living beings, he hated being one, but he continued to live, focusing on his studies, it was the easiest thing to do after all, until one day when what people had feared for so long happened: World War 3. After long years of battle the world had fallen into chaos, peaceful places were now infested with crime, he tought as if his theories were right, mankind was evil, it just take their comfort to be taken away from themfor them to show their true colors. By this point he had already gone insane, he was going to get rid of all living beings.
---
He found hope in robotics, if he managed to gather all the knowledge other scientist were researching he might be able to create his own army to purge the world. For years he gathered all the information he could, but it was not enough, all his attempts ended up in failure, there was not enough information to create a working AI... Maybe he could take something already done, human brains, he started to kidnap people for his experiments. It was at this moment when the entity noticed him, in this violent times the entity was stronger than ever before, so it could show him what it’s plan was, and Santiago was delighted with it, he would help the entity to take over the world, but he asked something in return, he wanted to no longer be a living being, the entity agreed. Dr. Santiago was no more, only the machanism remained.
---
Power: Lag Switch: a flash of light comes from The Mechanism’s eyes and all survivors looking into that direction in a radius of 16m. will be paralized for 3 seconds. Survivors affected by this will see everything in negative colors and the image will be still, not allowing them to see what happens during those 3 seconds.
---
Passive power: Mechanical Body: The mechanism is very different from all other killers, with it’s own strenght and weaknesses.
---
Not alive: The Mechanism has no living organs, therefore there is no heartbeat to hear when it is close, Also it’s lack of life makes it to not have a strong conection with the entity like the other killers, The mechanism has no red stain, fortunately for survivors, it makes a lot of sound while walking, allowing them to know where it is with more exactitude than other killers.
---
Heavy weight: Being so heavy can also be used as a weapon, if the mechanism falls on top of a survivor, it will put them into dying state.
---
Perks: Mind Scan: You can see all the survivors data (perks, Items, Add ons, status, who are SWF and rank on tab screen) whenever a survivor picks up an item his/her aura will be revealed for 2/3/4 seconds, you also will be able to see which survivor you are chasing by looking at their icons.
---
Emotionless: Breaking a pallet will not decrease bloodlust, instead it will increase it slightly/moderately/considerably.
---
Science: This ancient technology is nothing to you. Whenever a generator is damaged it requires survivors to work on it for 34/5 seconds to stop regression, if survivors leave the generator before that time or fail a skill check they will have to start from beggining again (the 3/4/5 seconds not all the generator)
---
Mori: letters will appear it the FOV of the killer: 
---
Subject status: Failed...Terminate. Survivor will stand up then the killer will shoot down the survivor like this: https://youtu.be/ZFvqDaFpXeM?t=128
---
o maybe he will burn him with an arm flamethrower.
---
Walking sound: https://youtu.be/aX1n7B-Amqc?t=25 (until 0.51)
---
I think your judgment of time is way off in these chases. You'd have to be a high rank killer against low rank survivors to consistatnly have sub 15 second for a single hit. (or be nurse bc good game design).
---
This can be a good rule for mid rank killers. Since you'll have a mix of competent and incompetent survivors. Like at ranks 8-16 there's usually one or two competent survivors that can loop you, and another one or two that'll just eat shit in a panic because they suck. But good killers against good survivors arnt getting sub 15 second hits.
---
I come back about the same amount as you and for some reason the spirit scares the ever loving f*** out of me every game. Idk what it is about her, but damn, she freaks me out.
---
Such forward thinking. You should apply for a job there, with those types of ideas I’m sure you’ll fix all their issues and balance the game easy within the first week of starting huh?

Hardly. The last bulk of updates have been killer friendly. End game was literally completely killer friendly. Nerfing MoM. Buffing totems to be better hidden. Slowing gen repair speed when multiple survivors were on it.

You ever do Legion's basement as Susie? She's just a shy innocent teen who wants to make friends but her introverted nature restricts her from being social so she just sits in the basement all day thinking to herself The Chest being her only companion. When greedy Survivors rush inside the basement and disturb her only friend she snaps and goes on a Feral Frenzy slashing at any foe in her way.

wow so you stand up for gay? Bro when i find the CEO of racism

To be fair a 13,8,6 isn’t that bad to an 11. The 2 on the other hand shouldn’t be there

I think you answered your own question
---
This...is actually messing me up.
---
I guess lol I'm just fairly new to the game. About 2 weeks now
---
I’ll make that set amount now jk I’ll try to loop lots
---
I only ever wait at the gate to make sure nobody gets left behind. Never leaving until I'm sure I don't need to go back and unhook someone.
---
That's a lot of learning if you aren't already used to doing it.
---
The shittiest part about prestiging is trying to get your preferred build back on that character. Take my Feng for example, when I first started leveling her I got Urban and Self Care very early on, when I prestiged her I didn't see either at all and even in P2 level 40 I'm still waiting for self-care to come back into her web. So it's a gamble on teachables

A commercial product is a commercial product, the consumer shouldn't have to understand or suffer the outcome of a companies misdirected internal structuring. If this was a pair of shoes, buying nice new laces will not change the fact the shoes don't work.

Congrats! Enjoy long wait times and be sure to equip Franklin's for the same 5-6 SWF teams you'll constantly be facing!
---
/s?
---
also... why use demogorgon when you could just use nurse with add ons?
---
Yeah that's where the tricky part comes from.
---
Of course you could just get a bunch of Prayer Beeds and get an easy 4K that way
---
that's a hard /s chief
---
If its end game no, if its right when they get hooked during game, yes. Its kinda situational tbh
---
Just bad rng I’m afraid
---
Damn how much of a hellhole was early DBD
---
I was under the mindset that it's like you got to spend money to make money. I actually started playing Killer sometimes due to BBQ and Chili last week, and it took 200,000 to get the perk on the bloodweb, but I've gotten way more since then.
---
I was curious if WGLF would be worth it, since it's not on the Shrine, meaning I'd have to spend bloodpoints to simply get it, rather than hoping it just shows up on the web.
---
Ah, some perfectly normal unedited footage of DBD

THe game is in dire straits atm

Yeah i guess so huh. If the mods wanna take it down they will. I missed it so oh well 😂

Two different teams do different things. Skins help fund the game, so they'll actually help make things better.
---
You have to sprint directly at the window for 2.5 meters to get a fast vault.  If you go in the window at an angle then you'll medium vault, which is slower and has a bigger hit box.  So if you're running along a wall that has a window in it and you vault through the window, you're probably going to get a medium vault.  You have to move away from the wall a bit and sprint towards the window to get the fast vault.

Lobbies arent dead I get a match in like 2 mins everytime

Because just like how Survivors are usually bad, Killers are also usually bad

Surge and Thrilling Tremors seems like a good combo. If it works with Overcharge we could have a really good "Screw Gens" build.
---
I guess I should have used an in-game screenshot of Billy rather than something out of a 3D modelling app, since the lighting in-game gives him an actual skin tone, similar to the one in the poster, but I think the uncanny likeness is still apparent enough.
---
I will personally give p3 Steves the same reputation.
---
fuck you
---
hmm, seems that the lil hearts in the corner are hiding somethin, maybe you were a bit toxic too that match. someone was either hooked or downed
---
At first I thought "damn did this dude just wake up from 10 -year oblivion?"
---
...you got us in the first half not gonna lie
---
I WATCHED MY FRIEND PLAY SURVIVOR CAUSE I COULDNT PLAY AND IN POST GAME CHAT ALL THE SURVS SAID HE DID NOTHING WHEN HE HAD THE MOST POINTS, DID TWO GENS HOOK SAVES HEALING AND TWO TOTEMS AND THE KILLER SAID HE WAS TRYNA GET HER TO CHASE HIM THROUGH THE INFINITE BUT HES NOT THAT GOOD AND HE DIDNT EVEN KNOW IT WAS INFINITE WHY DOES EVERYONE ASSUME THESE THINGS AND WHY YALL STICK AROUND TO YELL AT PEOPLE AFTER YOU DIE START A NEW ONE LOL
---
I meant fun match, the game is good
---
David is one of the best survivors a new player can level up. And yes, WGLF is an extremely amazing perk if you want to earn BPs. It’s the best one. If I were a survivor main, I wouldn’t play without it.
---
I’m glad you made this disclaimer. I wanted to ask if you got teabagged a lot because that was a lot of taunting.

Your just unlucky to not have seen it again, the change with 4 perks at high level bloodwebs should make finding it again much easier.

I love this idea
---
Yea lol. The only real problem is the red rank I just started playing and am still climbing but it was frustrating getting looped like a noob

Something abt OP karma farming by commenting on their own post so they get ‘downvotes from guys like me ;)’
---
Freddy, Spirit, Myers. Freddy is the main one, I just love his map pressure.
---
How did you not throw heat you either want them to have no job and do no work because the game has bugs which is out of their control or just not have their work put into the game.
---
You can't "git gud" against SWF players. It's like getting good against a killer with speedhacks.
---
Turn messages on to friends only. 
---
I’m probably due about 15-20 messages from survivors/killers but unfortunately for them they can’t send me shit.
---
anyone can be OP of a useless comment too
---
&gt;How can you combat people standing in front of hooks to prevent you from hanging people?
---
Hit them. If the person on your shoulder didn't wiggle too much, drop them and chase the bodyblocker.
---
Does the design team also decide when to release content? No I didn't think so either, that's a different team.
---
Why are they screaming their age?
---
Come to think of it my German girlfriend always screams her age while we're in the middle of unbridled passion.
---
Maybe it's a German thing
---
I did Nazi that coming, did Jew? Anne Frankly I'm very disappointed in this comment
---
Honestly depends but with borrowed time I’d have to say 95% of the time no
---
Just whack them, if it’s a extremely regular occurrence you can also run one of the perks that make it easier to carry someone
---
No. You can get good against a good swf team, it's just extremely difficult. You can push them into unfavorable circumstances depending on which killer you're playing
---
k
---
Hit them to make them go away. Sidestep to avoid them if possible. Scare them away from the hook BEFORE you pick up the downed survivor.
---
Just replace the David and what he says with you and its perfect.
---
I run Iron Grasp. And I hit the body blocker but they kept moving around and not in one spot and the person I was carrying wiggled free
---
Huntress has the intelligence of an animal if an animal was given a human body.
---
The adhd levels would make people hate themselves. their main at 583 everyone else at 74 lol
---
there’s so many hooks now honestly that whenever I see someone try to body block I turn and go to the nearest other hook. Usually I make it. If I know I won’t I’ll just get my free hits in. Wanna give multiple people injured status while I’m running Sloppy Butcher and Stridor on my spirit? That’s their funeral.
---
Alternative title: "All other survivors when you stab one person as legion"
---
I just want to be able to use my power, but Legion is so slow T-T
---
My suggestion is have more than one survivor with lots of stuff/your favourite perk build so when you want to prestige your main, you can continue playing with the same stuff you normally have. Takes longer this way to level up 2 survivors but it's worth it imo.
---
For killer, I just suffer and use nothing. Maybe just play survivor until I get enough BP to get *some* stuff back on my main killer.
---
OMG THAT WAS A BURN
---
If they are moving around enough to make you miss swings there should be enough space for you to start the hooking animation
---
Yeah it would probably act as when you’re working on the last gen but another one pops up - you just insta cancel your action
---
Heroes never die!
---
But we're dumbass survivors. I'll try, but I make no promises
---
Nah according to roadmap, it will be out after the Stranger Things DLC. Precisely one and a half month after that just like Freddy Rework.
---
Were you holding shift out of running habit? I sometimes forget that I'm holding shift when I get downed and it prevents others from healing you.
---
But if the content they are making isn’t being released then why would the company pay them there is no reason for them to be there.
---
wait... its noed on huntress
---
oof that’s was i thought😭 thank you for the tips!
---
It's hard now because of the EGC
---
Because it’s not as simple as fix the bug, some times the fixes can be made super quick the problem is finding what causes the bug.
---
Godspeed for this. I’d give gold if I could.
---
If you are moving or holding shift, you can not be healed.
---
Lucky!
---
Even if accidentally hit? :(
---
1. Shit matchmaking. 
---
2. SWF with largely different ranks causing the average to be right but the rank disparity to still be too large. 
---
3. It took you too long to find a match and it put whoever the fuck it felt like in there after so long. 
---
4. You’re in a region with a low playerbase or in “down time” and it just gave you whoever it could 
---
5. ???????? 
---
Generally it’s unknown how exactly they determine matchmaking in most cases. It used to be “Hosts rank of that SWF determined the killers rank” then it changed to “The average rank determined the killers rank” but inbeteeen it’s still been fucky.
---
Yeh I've seen this beaut. On this sub reddit about 4 times now lol.
---
Wiggle timer is less if he carries you and drops you
---
Bi-minutely “matchmaking bad” post
---
I understand it's not just "fix the bug", a rant is a rant - it was not supposed to be a technical breakdown of how to fix their game. I have experience in game development from unity and unreal, I know the difficulties involved and I know how to prioritise bugs based on impact. I'm talking GAME BREAKING, can we both agree that these bugs such as running into the exit gates have existed way too long, and happen far too often?
---
That's good! That little flick at the end was impressive. I always get nervous about throwing around trucks because I know how bad the hitbox is on that thing.
---
Perfect.
---
welcome to DBD my guy
---
I main Nurse and missing a blink on that map is a pain
---
Love it. Is there anyway we could turn this into a perk??
---
If you are saving instantly, I'd say yeah thats a farm. If you are saving them right before 2nd state with BT, I'd send a thank you.
---
The art is great, but Quentin looks like he has actually slept at least once in the last month.
---
Hahaha first day on reddit that's my bad. Lol I saw the thread after and saw my mistake
---
If not Friday, then sometime next week
---
late reply but I'm actually straight down the middle 50:50! I alternate killer and survivor after every game; currently rank 4 survivor but rank 8 killer, I think I can loop better than I kill
---
Now THIS is pod-racing!
---
I'd guess the DC was out of rage and because of the mori.
---
Just wait. After 2 years it takes me 80 seconds to scroll at the highest speed in my inbox to reach the end of my messages. Why? Dead by daylight.
---
Turn back while you can! You've been warned...
---
Stop posting the same thing please. This is reddit, not the support forums.
---
Escape through the hatch seems more impossible
---
depends on the weather honestly
---
10/10 good job
---
when we all escape and the killer says BG 
---
:'(
---
there is
---
Just another guy scrolling past the 200th post of the same fucking thing in the last hour.
---
See you in the basement bitch!
---
It's like if hillbilly imitated PogChamp
---
I’m on console but yeah these messages are annoying.
---
I'm thinking along the same lines. Sometimes I have to invest in breaking two pallets and it wastes time, but when I get that spirit fury it's so dope when you give em that gud smack
---
Thanks, i tried to make it as painless as possible to watch 😅
---
I think it's just what they use to save your progress through their system instead of relying on other things. Don't quote me on that though.
---
Plus the fact the guy vacuumed towards the hook which is cool too.
---
I can’t fathom being that heartless.
---
No they arent
---
this is incredible
---
I’m also on console. Not all are hate messages. Most. But some are nice messages. And some people I’ve become friends with. I’ll take the bad with the good. You should send more positive messages out yourself. That’s what I do. It works wonders.
---
I guess this is BHVR’s evil plan to get you to play the game until you got everyone 1000. Muahahaha.
---
I definitely try to keep my salt contained for sake of saving myself from even more flak  about toxic I am. It’s not even like most of these people were rank 5s or something. A huge chunk of them were below 15.
---
ITS LIKE A GOLDEN WIND
---
No I know about fast vault
---
I just got out of a game as a rank 13 killer and was ranked against 3 rank 5’a and 1 rank 2 SWF....
---
If no one was hooked that game it might have been me doing dailies and trying to help survivors out of low rank hell. I was gonna pick you up and take you to the door but I couldn’t find you :(
---
It feels like absolute shit to play against. 
---
That's my problem with it.
---
That's worse that a heartbreak.
---
Well done dude. I can't get passed Rank 11. Get duked to easily
---
Should've read the comments before I watched.  
---
You got me.
---
To anyone giving the argument that they couldn't remake his face exactly like the actor's because they didn't have permission to use his likeness: they could have at least modelled an actual human being instead of freehanding this demonic abomination we have in-game.
---
Which map?
---
Thanks, I might have mistaken his base Tier 1 speed with one of his addons (Tombstone maybe)
---
Is it really? My goodness, I never knew it was that delicious
---
Yep even a simple “Well played” “I like your cosmetic!” “You were a great INSERT KILLER NAME HERE” goes so far. Some people are you can tell right away aren’t worth your time. If you send “GG” and they send back “Fuck off tunneling baby killer ez stream snipe btw” just leave it at that lmfao. They’ll feel zero satisfaction from no reply.
---
&gt;it took you over half an hour
---
Lmao sorry I have other things to do, bud
---
Anyways, show me proof they are planning on throwing down the hammer on DC's
---
Haddonfield
---
If you like this style, you should try Ghost Face. 0 Terror Radius that lasts until you get revealed (usually quite a while), and almost constant marks
---
I just got him and I love him. He feels like the best parts of The Pig and The Shape together
---
Oh bud u have no idea, I’ve had survs that wait after match to say stuff bout me tunneling, in a long match.
---
Yeah, everyone that says ANYTHING but "gg," compliments or offers ACTUAL advice, delivered in a sensitive way, is being a toxic POS. In fact, that's the ONLY thing that qualifies as toxic, in my book. You can do ANYTHING you want that's a deliberate game mechanic (anything except exploits, including face-camping or tunneling, as long as it's not just based on the person's username or other out-of-game reasons). But if you start being a terrible sport and insulting the actual player themselves outside of the game, that's actually toxic and you're literally killing the game.
---
So yes, you are absolutely right, except the part at the end where you said to harass face-campers, UNLESS you're sure they did it for an out-of-game reason, like recognizing you as the person that looped them last game or something, or because of your age or race. If any of the latter is the case, you still shouldn't talk to them, but should report them immediately for harassment. Plus, honestly, a lot of them are doing it *in order to receive angry messages*.
---
Disclaimer: Game mechanics like face-camping are definitely not fun, but the impetus lies with the Devs to fix issues with the game mechanics not being fun, not the players. Do complain to the Devs, do not harass the players.
---
Boom headshot!
---
That used to happen a lot, and it was pretty fucked up
---
Fr though I don’t really get its powers. It’s basically nurse but it’s power is slower?? From what I understand at least.
---
The higher I go up in rank, or when I queue up with my higher ranked friends, the more DCs I see. It's not frustration, its a shitty attitude. Play the game or don't bother and screw everyone else over.
---
I play both sides and I’ve had my share of positive messages sent and received and a decent amount of friends made as killer and survivor who I still play with today. Toxicity leads essentially nowhere in this game, some people are just gonna be an asshole to ruin other people’s fun regardless of what you do or say and it’s okay to let them be miserable but don’t give them that satisfaction of being upset over it or showing them any form of attention. They’ll die off without the attention just gotta stop feeding them.
---
I probably will but there are definitely Killers I know better than others. Tbh if anything I might fiddle with Tiermaker to make tier lists.
---
He looks like that because he doesnt go to sleep
---
Look at this flick tho!!!! Good shit babe!
---
Don’t blame hitboxes, blame the host’s McDonald’s WiFi
---
I love this lmao
---
Fun fact: idk lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're correct, btw, it's just funny how you worded it
---
I bet
---
Gg aimbot.. jk nice shot man glad to see another huntress player my girl gets no love anymore 😭
---
Ah yes because being a dick calls for a racist remark
---
If they fix his face ill buy him
---
&gt;You fully deserve every profanity thrown at you, including the hard R's
---
I mean... people offending others in game chat are probably getting suspended once reported and the players being offended will continue playing normally. 
---
No good comes from offending others, no matter what they did.
---
Add that to the survivors rulebook I guess, guess what, you can do what you want
---
You gotta play enough that when a killer shows up, instead of panicking and being afraid of the killer, your immediate thoughts are "where is a pallet" or "where can I loop this killer". You think the killer has all the power? Think again. Survivors can bully the shit outta of a killer if they're good enough. You gotta accumulate experience by playing a lot and have faith in your skills to not be instant prey to the killer. Just play more
---
you’ll get there friend, with time and practice!
---
I remember when Legion first came out and it was "LEGION MIGHT BE WORSE THAN FREDDY"
---
I immediately turned into a Legion Main. Immediately noticed that Legions REAL power is not putting up with normal survivor bs. No Pallet Loops, They can't hide very well. Being far on the map really didn't stop anything else. Grouping up doesn't help. 
---
Now it's oh man Legion is OP. Which I guess there can be an argument for it but I dunno man. I'm a survivor main and I don't think he's OP but he doesn't put up with normal SWF antics.
---
Thank you! And yeah my bad will do next time lol
---
Damnn nah I play on Xbox one
---
you know that only after recieving a high amount, actual humans get notified, right?
---
I mean a lot of killers do have supernatural powers but are still weaker than the entity and the killers that the entity cant take fully over it makes a deal with them like Myers and freddy. the entity would have nothing to offer IT because well IT is a entity and as I said possibly even stronger just would not make sense at all as cool it would be to have him
---
But mine is ‘butter’ :((
---
Queue times are terrible on all systems.
---
I almost stopped playing more than once because of the queue times.
---
I feel you lol. He’s just too damn strong :/
---
Yes. She was a m1 huntress. I was the lucky fellow to test if she had noed.
---
have you tried survivor
---
oooh that makes sense, haven't used facebook in a while, never really seen that meme before.  Thanks for explaining!
---
Oh no. Help me. I'm so scared.
---
what are the hard R's?
---
No way in hell, have you seen how those survivors main cry? They will never change them because they are "annoying and not fun to face" so they kinda need to left it in shit tier sadly, i loved the fast vaults but they were "uncounterable" and by some reason they removed the speed increase addon instead of nerfing it a bit...
---
Don't you know there's no fun allowed in DbD? This game is super serious. Rank is serious. It's life or death. It's totally okay to bully or just use the worst things against people at all times. From building loops, to instaheals and instadowns.
---
A lot of it isn't just the playerbase. It's the devs. They encourage this by continually adding obnoxious things for people to abuse and then go ''Gee, golly wilkers, we don't understand why the game's playerbase is so obnoxious and toxic guys!"
---
The game is absolutely in the worst state it has ever been IMO. In terms of balance for both sides. In terms of just general fun. And I wish it could turn around, because it's the last of it's kind that has legs to stand on and it's a golden concept.
---
But the playerbase and the devs not knowing what the hell they are doing is slowly (albeit very slowly) sucking the soul out of the game.
---
Please stop my pp can only get so hard.
---
Getting a Merciless in general is pretty tough, farming is probably the best way to do it.
---
Beyond that, I think one of the things that hurst Huntress the most is Deviousness score categories. Basically, you need to try to get hatchet hits as many times as possible.
---
You might have to resort to toxic strategies (slugging, camping, tunneling) and hope for an overly altruistic survivor team.
---
You might also have luck on maps with lots of open space, like Rotten Fields
---
I’m on PS4 and my q times are only like 3 mins max
---
FUCKING NEA PLAYERS! WHY ARE THEY ALWAYS THE MOST TOXIC?! WHY Y'ALL ALWAYS GOT THE SAME GOT DAMN BUILD?!
---
That makes me sad.
---
I just bought Ghost Face yesterday, and I feel like I'm getting called out haha.
---
TBH I've never notices the sounds you're talking about
---
lol awesome pic
---
Idk what has changed but match making is bananas right now. Probably why there are so many posts about it. I’ve seen red ranks against 17 rank killers, and purple killers getting lobbies with all 20s
---
The uncounterable part of legion was that no matter what happened you'd eventually go down. My buff still keeps that from happening. The went the right direction with legion, but went like 4 or 5 nerfs too far and then nerfed them again on ptb when they discovered an add on that still did something.
---
O shit
---
I’d love Samantha! She’d be a ps4 exclusive though considering the game is... I’d only change the slippery to something like “stay quiet” where when standing completely still her aura can’t be read... it’d be a counter to BBQ
---
Yeah I'm a better survivor than killer. I just love the killers in the game and can't not play them.
---
it still doesn't FULLY negate medkits
---
People dont get how hard it is being a killer main and keeping your cool midgame
---
In my opinion, Dead 'Ard. She takes a swing, you dodge, she has to go through the entire missed swing/fatigue animation before she can do anything again.
---
Couple that with a stealth perk (Dance With Me, Lightweight, Quick N' Quiet), and you'll be able to make some easy getaways
---
I respectfully disagree
---
On killer?
---
who do you know
---
well if survivor worked fine there are prob to many killers on right now
---
He's so fun, but so squeaky, if you play with headphones you'll notice, just crouch a few times.
---
My nephew had a rough first day of preschool so my sister-in-law sent me this

oh okay it was your pic. i was hoping to get the original like from the internet. alrighty :)

yeah that's a really good idea and ps4 exclusive makes sense also :)

Why are you trolling me?

I don’t even main a single killer at this point it’s gotten so dumb no one is ever happy with who you play so if I can’t main a killer without being judged. I’ll play everyone instead XD

Yeah. I’m mainly posting this as a response to a post from earlier about fixing Quentin’s face.

It was literally the opposite from me I am a rank 16 killer and got in a game with two rank 2’s and a rank 6 and 8

When I was more active I was a hag main. People kept calling her op and bitched that I was playing her.
---
GODDAMMIT I  NEED TO LEARN TO TIME MY LUNGES AS A KILLER. I GET BAMBOOZLED SO EASILY AND THEN THE SURVIVORS TBAG ME WHILE IM TRYING TO KILL THEM AND THEN IM HELLA EMBARRASSED.
---
I was adding on to the bringing a mori part as a joke, because doing what I was suggesting is the cruelest thing you can do in this game
---
During one of the streams, I think 2nd anniversary? they showed concept art of the existing characters, which was kind of thematic/flavour pieces for the character. Such as Feng in a bunny hoodie. One of David's was him shirtless. This started the shirtless meme/thirst. With the cosmetic store in 2.0.0, they made that art a real cosmetic, everyone loves it, and someone photoshopped it onto Myers, leading to the meme growing bigger.
---
WHY IS IT EVERYTIME I WANT TO PLAY MYERS I GET A COLDWIND, STOP GIVING ME THAT POS MAP WHEN I WANNA PLAY MY MAIN
---
Well I used to play Myers quite a lot but damn the hate with Hillbilly and Spirit is strong. You are correct though. The salt has increased.
---
yes, and?
---
That’s when I go to a diff server
---
Best killer. I love stealth killers because they can create suspense even in hardened SWF if you play them right (normally they rely on knowing where the killer is to tell what gens to do). I find it almost as easy to create pressure with him as Billy, not because he *is* *everywhere*, but because he *can* *be anywhere*. With an instadown ready to pop, no less. Can't wait for the OoO nerf lol
---
FuCk YoU RaCiSt ShItHeAd
---
I'm so upset
---
My few favourites:
---
Sexy and I NOED
---
Hex:Gongivittoya
---
Dwight and Nerdy
---
Yeah, it’s with every killer too. People will bitch and moan cause the killer had slightly more brain cells than, and personally I can’t blame them, but if they suggest playing other killers when they just send nothing but negativity anyone’s way why should they judge who you shouldn’t and shouldn’t play? 
---
I have no problem with complaining survivors but theirs a thin line from slightly aggravated but reasonable, to I’m only mad to protect my ego and the killer was smarter than me, but that’s personally how I see it at least...
---
and you died first, botted your way to 4 obviously.
---
More like game of the century
---
Distressing, unnerving presence, overcharge/ NOED, And BBQ. Run a calm add on and a obidence add on to increase snap out time. At the start of the game find three gens that you can easily defend and guard them all game. Eventually every one will be 3rd tier and unable to hit any skill checks repair or heal and then if they do get that last gen you can NOED them. This method is called 3 genning. You can look it up on YouTube for tips on how to choose what gens to pick and how to not overextend in a chase and to fall back to protecting your gens.

Not capitalizing the start of a sentence, and then capitalizing letters mid sentence makes you look illiterate, which may or may not add up to the fact that you’re perhaps a loser too.

Every singe building in the game is still trash tier godly unfun to go against. The building in Iron Works is gross. The buildings in Haddonfield are balanced landing heaven.
---
The building on one of the Azarov's maps is pretty disgusting too. The giant building on Grim Pantry is gross. 
---
It's not about survivors running in a straight line. It's legitimately about how even with these band aids fixes. You're still not beating those buildings. 
---
The suggestion is legitimately right there. Stop adding fucking band aids and actually fix things at a core value. Make the buildings harder to loop.
---
Rework killer add ons across every killer. 
---
It's a massive undertaking, but this game is at it's worst for both killer and survivor somehow at the same damn time.  It's gross.
---
good game
---
I can’t deny people’s angers towards spirit as it is true that she can be extremely unfun to play against but my main retort to that is, 
---
So if spirit is unfun to play against, you are technically saying 2 higher tier killers are more fun to play against even tho they can end a chase 10x’s faster than spirit? 
---
But that’s just me...
---
Sorry, didn't realize you're a mod.
---
Intent is everything. Saying the N-word to degrade someone of african descent is entirely different from raging at some 12-year-old who thinks he's cool for being able to run around a rank 20 killer for the whole match

Nah, I want demogorgon in hot pink lingerie.

I was already a fan before the announcement Scoops Steve main is master race

I honestly don't think Lore matters when it comes to liscensed characters. Their soul purpose is to bring in new people, money and make fans happier.
---
For Doctor, I use Brutal Strength, Ruin or Pop Goes the Weasel, Haunted Ground, and Make Your Choice. The way I play Doctor is I don't go into my treatment mode right away but rather when it's necessary, when either Haunted Ground or Make Your Choice is active then go into treatment mode to find survivors and down them easier. Brutal Strength is there to break pallets faster so that you can both have a better chance at catching survivors with your insta-down perks and to save time in chases. And either Ruin or Pop Goes the Weasel to help slow down the game.
---
For Freddy I use Discordance, Ruin or Huntress Lullaby, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Make Your Choice. Discordance on Freddy works very nicely because once you know when survivors are teaming up on a generator, you can use your dream teleport to instantly go to the gen they're working on and interrupt their progress. Make Your Choice is also pretty good on Freddy because once a survivor is unhooked and your 32 meters away, you can use your dream teleport to teleport to the closest generator by where the survivor was unhooked and find the rescuer and insta-down him/her. Pop Goes the Weasel of course for slowing down the game but again can be especially good on Freddy because of his ability to teleport to generators instantly. And Ruin just for a little extra game slowage, but if you don't like using this then Huntress Lullaby combined with an addon for slower actions in the dream world or an addon that reveals survivors auras to Freddy for few seconds when they fail a skillcheck to wake themselves up can be pretty good and help to slow down the game.
---
You have no clue what race the person you're speaking to is, and I won't argue about this. Saying the n-word at all, ever, is racist. Speaking of 12 year olds, have fun at your 13th birthday coming up.

I dream of having the original Nancy in this game.

AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 713 BABY PO’ UP

Im the guy looping the killer so hard he turns around and gets someone else and camps them and I pull up with the borrowed time and instaheal for buddy. David Kate and Jane will live at all costs in my matches though but if all three are in my match Jane is chosen if they're all defaults, if they're not defaults it's shirtless David unless Jane has the exact same cosmetics I use. I'm sorry Kate
---
I 2nd this as a Hag and Huntress player I definitely  hate even the 1st survivor  I down insta DC's. True mind game messes up my whole match.4 is easy but 3 survivors!!!! Whoooo
---
Nope. Tbh from rank 14-20 I’m playing for myself. Fk all of the cowardly nooby survivors. Also if I see any of them make stupid plays I give up on them. I get that some of them are new to the game but grow some balls if you’re gonna keep playing you’re going to be altruistic. I’ll save them during the game but when all generators are powered... SEE YA BITCHES. If I’m not playing with those ranks then I’ll be as altruistic as I can be.
---
It happened to me once, i got to the hatch in time however
---
I agree, but this subreddit has way too many idiots who think this game is balanced lmfao
---
People getting mad at game mechanics they don't understand instead of reading my perks in the end game screen:
---
"Reported. You always knew where I was healing" -Nurse's Calling
---
"You always knew where we were, reported for hacking" -BBQ
---
"You stopped chasing someone and came straight to us on a gen" -Discordance
---
"Wow camping your totem all game baby killer" -4 man SWF found Devour Hope no less than 20 seconds into the game and all got slugged because they wouldn't stop riding my totem
---
Hmm... I see a pattern. Please read the perks someone is using and consider the situation in the match before making ridiculous accusations of cheating or otherwise "unsportsmanlike" gameplay. Also take shove ego and shove it. Thanks.
---
I knew it's gonna be these meme, such potential
---
It honestly isn't worth it IMO. Minor cosmetics, and ridiculously small chance for "better" items in bloodweb.
---
Lmao hell yeah boiii
---
I do that to people who just fail the skill check and continue but I make sure to stop and go to them and just stare them down or just point to go away

&gt; Every singe building in the game is still trash tier godly unfun to go against. The building in Iron Works is gross. The buildings in Haddonfield are balanced landing heaven.
---

---
You are right on this one but when you say "strong loops" I immediately think of pallets and not exclusively broken structures. A simple misunderstanding on my behalf. 
---
Grim Pantry is a giant garbage to be honest. Loop wise your options are limited outside of that build, specially if RNGs don't spawn the pallets between the main structure and shack. As a survivor I find myself humping that structure mostly because the rest of the map isn't that good. Also agree with you on Wretched Shop and Iron Works.
---
**My** theory is, from what I can gather by playing survivor, some times RNG can be so bad for survivors pallet wise, these structures end up being their only reliable looping tool and devs aren't very comfortable with removing it altogether. 
---
As for Haddonfield, odds are its the next map being reworked in the upcoming mid chapter.
---
Okay but tell me how this isn’t a worse hag

He had grasp, clearly. Probably a basement build (grasp, grit, etc). Not sure what the issue was other than it being really close.
---
My crutch!  *pulls plug.

Hex: Treadmill: 2/3/4 survivors are affected by the hex. During a chase, survivors are actually ahead in time from their point of view, resulting in them being 2 seconds back in time from the killer's perspective. After landing a basic attack, time is synchronized once more. During synchronization, the survivor will be forced backwards toward the killer and unable to properly move forward until using an Exhaust perk which will cause them to break out of the treadmill effect but still be guaranteed to be downed.
---
T-posing post, tier list, etc. The rule isn't even enforced.
---
I love hearing the Huntress humming. Unless she has Iri Heads, otherwise it's Loop City and extended pallet runs!
---
Bbq, ruin, enduring, and spirit fury is the best build for any standard speed killer.
---
Well if you are going to make a meme that is essentially calling other people stupid at least learn to fucking spell.

Ah yes give this man 12k upvotes and reddit gold for reuploading a video clip literally anyone can watch thanks reddit

Did someone else get the YouTube recommended "Sinbad, but only with Eris" too?

Call the Entity to put this in the game

i love your cringey advice

I'm overall disappointed with the moderation of this sub tbh... Mods are either slow to take action or don't act at all.

This is sad, but true. Even after a year of playing this, I still dread reaching rank 8.
---
Also does console have way more people playing as a squad of friends because I keep going against a full on team with friends
---
Idk what y'all are talking about, Quinten is a snack
---
So technically previously she was DLC, it slipped my mind that you can now purchase her via in game currency
---
u/nwordcountbot u/DukeOfTheDodos
---
Agreed lmao
---
I don't know what build you are using, but if you're using Ruin alone, then your success will depend mostly on where it spawns and where the Survivors spawn.  In red ranks, you'll probably encounter a lot of Ruins getting broken within the first 60 seconds of the game. Or worse, Survivors with Toolboxes that can get gens done without ever needing to break it.
---
Same. I'm 2 weeks new and I've been playing killer for about 1 week and I'm rank 10.
---
Yes, unless she is using an add on that prevents her from seeing them.
---
Ok thanks. That will make it easier to juke her
---
A lack of sleep doesn’t turn you into Smeagol.
---
You'll never balance this game by it's very nature, but my god the balance is trash right now.  They've done a lot to make survivor unfun in particular solo survivor.
---
But even with all of those changes to give killer a fighting chance. Killer is still in a trash place as well.
---
All they did is put survivor in the trash heap at the same time as killer. So yay balance I guess?!
---
These are two very different builds haha
---
For Freddy, you practically need BBQ&amp;Chili. The ability to see \*exactly\* where to go next after hooking someone blends too well with his gen teleport power. You could get similar results with Thrilling Tremors or maybe Discordance, but nothing's quite as reliable as ol' Bubba's best. Other than that, you'll want one or two chasing powers (Spirit Fury, Endurance, Save The Best For Last, Brutal Strength, stuff like that. Brutal Strength and Spirit Fury blend wonderfully with Dream Pallets), and then whatever you want really (I love Devour Hope, but you could run Ruin, Whispers, Rancor, Make Your Choice, or whatever else works for you). I highly recommend Dream Pallets over Dream Snares, but some people are really good with Dream Snares so I guess that's more of an individual preference thing.
---
For Doctor, you've already kinda got tracking covered, but BBQ&amp;Chili is always nice (Whispers would work too, to let you know if someone's getting passively zapped). You'll want perks that increase gen pressure (Ruin, Huntress's Lullaby, Overcharge, and so on), and perks that help in a chase (Spirit Fury, Enduring, and everything else I listed above). Throwing in Sloppy Butcher and/or Nurse's Calling also work well, to help slow the game down. Iron Maiden also works fairly well with Doctor, since some survivors rely on lockers to stop their madness from passively growing
---
Haha! Domestic abuse!
---
I honestly don’t get the hate for this guys model. It already clearly resembles the guy from the movie. Not like the character models in this game are S or even A tier. I don’t understand this gripe.
---
They did not get Mick Jagger's permission to use his likeness

Still having a ton of fun on both sides, infact, lately Ive been having more fun than Ive ever had, particularly playing as killer, and I usually do not actually use ruin. I strongly reccomend, if you arent having fun, take a break, focus on some other stuff in your life for a while, and come back when you get the urge. This is not meant to be insulting, ive done it multiple times over my time in this game, and believe me, it helps a ton. Every time I've come back, I've found myself learning new things, and this most recent journey back into the game, I actually feel quite confident in my killer gameplay for the most part. I'm by no means a super mega pro killer, but I've learned to mind game loops, I've learned when I should give up on a chase, and focus on my gens, and I've also learned when to pretend I'm giving up on a chase, a skill some killers in particular, are extremely good at. This game has a massive learning curve, and way more depth than it seems. I've noticed more than a few times, players with considerably more hours than me, who have put absolutely no effort into learning the game, and instead blame the game. Its not perfect, but its nowhere near as horrendously balanced as people like you would make us believe.
---
No idea what you are trying to get at here?
---
Juking spirits lulz
---
L survivor and Ryuk Killer? Anyone?
---
Ash main here, can confirm. Very rarely do I see a fellow P3 Ash, with or without Ashy Slashy.
---
Playing both sides is vitally important, and the new archive system should be forcing a bit more of that in the near future, because it certainly seems like you are forced to play a fair bit of both sides if you want to fill it out. People are going to bitch about it, but we really need more players playing both sides, so that people actually have an idea what they are talking about with these balance suggestions. Currently, the majority of balance suggestions here and on the forums are overwhelmingly biased one way or the other.
---
Please let squeekyface alone
---
Nah big dog. Xbox has the most DBD players of any system because of game pass. 
---
Of course if you live in a different country you'll have worse results. But in the US survivor ques take 1 min and killer ques take 3 min or less
---
I’m down to squad up! You want my psn?
---
Noed is your deterrent to rushing gens without considering the killers build. Sorry, you are narrow minded, and I doubt I can change that.
---
Dude he got fired, he lives on the street now

Siiiick! You down to play right now? Lol
---
shitpost tag exists.

so basically
---
i'm pallet

I just want Trapper to Gen his old auras back.

I waited 10 minutes today but I'm going to try and queue tommorow and not give up till I get my killer game.

I think Ash makes similar sounds? Yeah not a fan.

Yep, I'll dm yoy

If Quentin looked this cute i’d main the shit out of him

It’s pretty hard in the beginning but welcome! The best thing is to rack up on blood points and purchase the perks with a character that best fits you
---
Yeah its been more whack lately
---
Me and this guy i met on dbd are red ranks and everytime i played killer or he did there was always me or him as rank 1 survivor and the rest are 10 or below
---
Sick!! &amp; You down to play right now? Lol

DON'T BE TOXIC SURVIVORS! IF IM CHASING YOU DON'T WAIT FOR ME TO PALLET SLAP ME AND BLIND ME! AND DON'T DO THE CIRCLE CHASE! I HATE THE CIRCLE CHASING LIKE ONCE OR TWICE IS FINE BUT DON'T BE A BITCH. IM PROBABLY GONNA LET ONE OF YOU GO ANYWAY, I'LL HELP YOU FIND HATCH AND GIVE YOU THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR CRAWLING OUT OF HATCH IF YOU'RE NEW OR NICE.
---
She's using her head.
---
As a killer main I dislike it and the idea of it being a safety net/training wheels. Like, 100%, having NOED isn't going to teach me to play better as killer, it's going to be there to say "Well, they got all 5 gens. Here's your free speed boost and OHKO".
---
If there was something to it - like Devour Hope - I think I'd appreciate it more? Like, at least with Devour it has built in clauses that you need to activate rather than "Oop, my map pressure sucked".
---
Especially when I run as survivor and see NOED on like, Spirit or Nurse... At that point you're just being gross.
---
At first the dance moves were ok then.......SHE WENT FULL SPIRIT !!!
---
When you get red rank you actually run twice as fast and have a smaller hitbox. You also have the ability to increase your sensitivity to 200%lol. At least that's what is seems like. One thing I have learned is if you spend more than 30 seconds without hitting the survivor once or coming close to it,move on to someone else. Some people are just better and there is nothing you can do🤷‍♂️
---
When it gets to the point of having a penalty for hooking the same survivor twice in a row, then you know tunneling is discouraged. Kinda like when they made the penalty for face-camping.
---

---
People look different after 9 years and without a few hours in the makeup trailer.
---
Wait what purpose does this have?
---
Yup. Sometimes its inevitable tho because I'll phase back to a hook after a notification and the same survivor is nearby healing.🤷‍♂️ I genuinely try to not tunnel because I usually only get 1-2(rare) kills. It isnt fun to play like that and believe it or not I play the game because I enjoy it. I like the fact that they have those penalties 👍👍
---
That means frank is like 30 lol

It tells you if you have this bug inflicted on you in the match if it doesn't let you point then you have this bug that is all

If this is true it needs changing, does it work the same for scratchmarks?
---
Yeah she does! HOT! 🤣
---
Isn't this just a much better version of trapper?
---
It might not be that OP "just like\[s\] to tunnel." If you're a strong player and/or are obviously helping your team out a lot, damn right I'm going to try to knock you out as fast as possible to make it harder on your team. There can be reasons to "tunnel" other than just doing it for the sake of doing it.
---
Just recognize you tunnel people and own it lol. Don’t try making excuses for it, you owe it to nobody.
---
Gotta keep her alive!
---
The real question is who do u know
---
If they weren’t useless in the match I’ll try whatever I can to get them out. But if it’s someone who spent more time on the ground and hook than looping/doing gens then I’m not gonna be bothered if they die
---
Sometime before September 21.

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Adam face rework please
---
I play the games as killers pretty good sometimes, but horribly if all survivors have 4 perks each. So in a situation at Lery I had everyone except these two and GOD I was so lucky (I play as wraith because nobody is and he can be good sometimes) so none were injured because heals, and they were just dashing for the exit. It was left on one last second so it was a surprise when the gate just popped open, anyways so I injured both of them and at the very end, I ended up lunging to get Adam and I actually h i t. The close hook was like 25 meters away so I wasn’t sure if I’d make it or not. I did but it felt so nice that I ended up getting someone right at the exit, but a feng min escaped tho so 4/5
---
Tl;dr
---
At the very end of the game where they were directly at the exit, I downed them and goteem
---
And Plague is thousands of years old
---
No scratch marks are the same, and why does it need changing?
---
And people have explained above in this thread and others why that’s not a good enough counter. In 400hours I can think of 2 games where all totems have been done and the killer had noed.
---
GET **DOWN** MR. PRESIDENT!!!
---
Well this is GAY !  You know what, thats ok! BUT GET A ROOM !
---
&gt; let them use his face in Farcry
---
That was live action though. They didn't just 'use his face' they paid him to act in a movie. His character didn't appear in the game.
---
Look at Dwight, Jake, Ace and Kate. Even Jane.
---
They all look like actual human beings. Same with Detective Tapp. At least their faces do. They have the body of a wendigo for the most part.
---
Meanwhile some other characters are very poorly modeled. Nea doesn't look that bad in game( I would argue Meg is much uglier in game) but her portrait has a neck seam that makes her look like she's from Fallout 3, and the face of a Terminator with the wrong skin stretched over the skeleton.
---
He was willing to work with BHVR
---
Haha exactly. I think tunneling is boring and playing it like that ruins the game even for me. I dont like doing it because I know its probably not fun for the survivors. I chased him and upon realizing he was better I moved on to someone else. He would come back and purposely try to get my attention so I gave it to him🤷‍♂️.I thought it was funny because if he wants me to tunnel him then I do... why get mad?
---
Why should it be easier to see the stain if you lower the graphics? Thats like lowering graphics in an fps so you can see through smokegrenades. I hope you dont think thats fair play
---
Not a good enough counter? the survivors only have to spend a couple of seconds doing totems, not good enough? wtf 🤣
---
So many killers just camp and then come to forums to defend how terrible they are. I never camp hooks. It only takes 3 hooks to insta kill someone. If like you say you see 3 people trying to unhook dude, don't camp him, pick one and go kill him.  Its not hard not be trash, ive never camped a hook and get 4k 9 out of 10 games... if you sit on hooks it ruins the game and everyone who says otherwise is just a garbage ass killer wishing they didn't suck. Killers have all the power, if you need to become toxicity incarnate to feel good about yourself then just quit seriously. Make all us other killers get messages because youre fuckin trash ass camps the group 4 out of their 5 games so they're sick of it.
---
This is gold, just sheer gold.

I run lower graphics as I get max frames without tearing, essential for FPS games. It’s very fair, it’s been in the game since release, your obviously new, do you main killer?
---
(As in Black Powder or Coal Dust, a double-meaning kinda thing on the name.)
---
A former colonial-era miner who was trapped in a collapsed mine and forced to turn to cannibalism to survive, but managed to escape before the full transformation into a Wendigo occurred. Now a half-human freak, he craves more flesh, and uses what remains of his fractured mind to put his mining pick and dynamite to deadly use hunting down new prey - until the Entity pulled him into it's realm to feed on the Survivors.
---
Power would obviously be dynamite sticks. He throws them like the clown's bottles. While in-flight and when they land, there's a loud enough audio cue and clear enough visual sparking to give any survivors who aren't hella distracted or trying to push the gen in spite of their own wellbeing a fair chance to get the fuck outta bang range before they actually go off. A smart Powder player could also use this to try and flush survivors out of one area and catch them going the other way.
---
Default flight distance would be shorter than the Huntress' hatchets but further than the Clown's bottles. Trade-off being the loud audio cue of the incoming sticks giving any survivors at distance more than enough time to get the hell out of dodge if they hear that hissing coming their way, and the fuse time making it a poor choice for anything other than trying to funnel survivors in a different direction to the one they're already running by throwing it ahead of them - trying to catch someone by throwing it -at- them would be a wasted stick unless they chose to just run circles on the spot for some reason.
---
The fuse time would be the same no matter how far the Powder throws it, so they have to decide between a short-range throw with a lot of time for the survivor/survivors to back out of range, or a longer throw that's more heavily telegraphed but goes off more or less the moment it lands.
---
If you're caught in the bang it's an insta-down. It's fuckin' dynamite after all. The blast also sets back any gens it hits as if the Powder had interacted with them, and destroys any knocked-over palettes in the radius. The bang itself isn't SUPER huge - no bigger than Clown's cloud, anyway, if not a bit smaller even.
---
He needs to interact with Lockers to recharge his sticks - being able to recharge them on the fly like the Clown would be too OP, I think, whereas forcing him to go for lockers to get more dynamite would keep him closer to being balanced.
---
While 'idle' he has a tell-tale cough from years of inhaling dust and dirt.
---
Possible cosmetics include a more modern-era Miner's garb (hard hat instead of wide brim, headlamp instead of candle).
---
Honestly idk but I do know they have one for camping. I wouldnt be surprised or disagree if they had one for tunneling as well
---
Everytime I lose as killer the survivors just insult me. I usually just say GG report them and move on.
---
Already been banned once before because a survive with friends group spam reported my profile since I dared to throw the toxic label at them
---
bwhaha love your flair
---
A David DC because I like to check around gens and come back to hook and it was his 3rd down, I didn’t even realize he DC until like 40 seconds later when there was no hook prompt. I even went back and checked and that’s how I learned what the signal means

I'm buying you a digital fifth of your favorite booze. You've had a rough life. You couldn't even open lockers or kick gens without decloaking.

I love it when sruvs get mad at me for doing my job as a killer. Even if some escape, they still get super salty about things.
---
The plushie is made with actual skin, Leatherface helped her make it.
---
rip tapp
---
Thanks for the answers, everyone!
---
Purchasing now. See you in game! :D
---
I might’ve been the killer there ??? If it was a wraith, it was me because I did hit someone right as they jumped through and I didn’t know you could shut it :o I’m generally new to the game (like I’ve only played for a month in very split times)
---
I think it is buged on steam. I got it at a random escape on lery‘s.
---
N-nani?!
---
I thought she was an old lady the first time I saw her character icon
---
I tend not to worry too much about that as Id prefer to no de-pip and get some points than quit altogether
---
Replace Bitter Murmur with something to slow the game down, like Pop Goes The Weasle, Ruin etc.
---
You really don't need three awareness perks.
---
Lol no it was the hillbilly but don’t feel bad I’ve had someone jump in the hatch right after I hit them too  and yeah you can shut it!  You play on Xbox?
---
it’s technically an exploit so uh yeah it should either be taken out or added to console
---
Ye
---
How do some of you guys have tags next your names?
---
were you watching a video or a live stream? it could be that it was when the tiles on coldwind were see through and you could see through them although this was changed a few months back
---
Pallets 2 toxic 4 me
---
Cool we should play sometime. I’m still new to the game too only been playing for a few weeks lol
---
That’s like almost a direct hit on me so here’s an idea (for the hook one) what if you can sabotage a hook but it isn’t sabotaged until someone is put on it and it also stubs the killer (doesn’t affect hook count thing)
---
shouldn’t have a cooldown
---
Not really toxic. Just annoying. If they're smart they'll do that to Urban Evasion right past you.

god damn it i’m not old enough for him &gt;:(

Can't wait for season 4 :)

I was hahaha and was for a bit while watching cause Steve was a dick in the beginning haha
---
Nice
---
yeah she can see and hear everything except blood trails and the actual players go invisible but you can’t walk through them so if you get stuck on something, it’s a survivor.  spirit is hella op
---
i’m watching the boondocks rn and i appreciate this
---
I'd say she's #3 at best &amp; #5 at worst. Nurse &amp; Billy are always gonna be above her unless she gets massive buffs or they get massive nerfs to their map control. Hag &amp; Spirit are the killers that are also generally considered better than her as their powers also helps in a chase, but also can be counterplayed, just like hatchets. They all have 110% movement speed as well. Huntress has worse map control than them, which is why she's considered worse.
---
I was excited for PWYF. Myers is the only DLC I don't have :)
---
Ruin, Blood warden, BBQ, and PGTW. It makes the game go as slow as I need it to, bbq pops, teleport to a gen, regress the shit out of it, hook survivor that was on it, rinse and repeat.
---
yeah it’s easier cause it’s on game pass on xbox and console has parties
---
Crab rave
---
Jeez that thing is scary
---
BUT KILLER LOBBY TIME SUCKS. THEN WHEN YOU GET A MATCH AT RANK 13, YOU GO AGAINST FUCKING CLAUDETTE TEAM OMEGA. WITH THE NON STOP LOOPING AND INSTANT HEALING.
---
The killer was Luigi, he won by doing absolutely nothing
---
come again?
---
Hmmm I don't remember this happening in stranger things
---
if anything the low ranks need the most help or they’ll never get past rank 17
---
Might as well say “slightly improves the dark framerate” on PS4 if I’m being honest though 👀
---
i would protect bing bong with my life
---
Blood Warden seems like an interesting choice. How often are you able to get it to proc?
---
Thanks
---
I mean if I die on your first hook because no one came and the killer is camping I'll die obviously
---
I’m very lackluster when it comes to using twitter haha but here’s where I post my art! Ty for asking

Makes a lot of sense why I always go against a full on friend team thanks to dying light that I have experience of playing against annoying team of friends while being a under power zombie luckily this game is balanced for the most part it still has some parts that needs fixing like the grabbing people off gen and bugs
---
Try hard time inbound.
---
I’ll have to bring my worm add-on to rot the apple. 
---
Otherwise gg ez bad killer.
---
When you are within 32 meters (if you have t3 that is) the icon will light up and some demonic whispers will start being able to be heard, its a tracking perk that works well at finding survivors
---
It's so cool it should br cooled down with a cooldown
---
I feel so bad for you. All I can give is an upvote.
---
guessing you're a survivor main?
---
GeT GoOd
---
Spirit is 110? I thought she was 115. Idk man a god tier Nurse I can juke sometimes but a god tier Huntress just fucks me up. Personal experience maybe. Billy I can counter too a lot. Not Huntress. But maybe I’m focusing too much on personal experience with chases instead of overall ability.
---
In fact, yes I have, i have seen wraith on ps4 xbox and pc, and I’m not saying that there isn’t camping wraiths out there, bit that group is the minority and most wraiths don’t do that. So don’t be an asshole and assume wraiths are trashy players that only camp
---
Personally I think that surge will replace pop because I always go for the nearest gen and surge will save me the seconds of going over and doing it manually in return of a lesser regression percent
---
Could be a friend on a friends account?
---
where can i see more of your artwork?
---
btw this is amazing
---
Ye so don't be
---
Lightweight is a must-have. Urban Evasion is also kinda considered the crux of this playstyle, but might be replaced by Fixated.
---
If you're gonna be on your own, Self Care is going to be a big one. An alternative that might help you hide better is Iron Will.
---
Discordance, Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, Poised, and Head On are other worthy perks to throw in.
---
AND THESE FUCKBOIS ARE THE REASON WHY MY FRIENDS AND I CAN'T PLAY ONE GAME WITHOUT THE KILLER 1 HOOKING THEN FACE CAMPING... YEAH WE CAN GET GENS BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PLAY SELFISH AS FUCK BECAUSE THE GARBAGE PALE KILLER IS SALTY AT A TEABAGGER HE FACED LAST WEEK...
---
Sensitive much lmao
---
THIS...YES..
---
I think this is great, only with the issue of its very op. My thoughts are you’re putting it into a one hit ko situation with the falling. With the flash of light, you’d need some buildup and some indication where not to look, because you can easily paralyze then attack, or instead of paralyze, blinding would be better. Bloodlust with a pallet? It trips up the good survivors because there has to be a flaw with extra speed. Just like the hillbilly with him running into walls. I get where you’re coming from but you’re taking on attacking too much, when generally the perks are more passive (instantly dying isn’t passive) I.e. scratch marks are replaced with 5/10/15% brighter colors and terror radius is only stifled for wraith in cloak and gf in his ability, if you were to give it the ability of walking loudly, perhaps a possible trait where every time a survivor is attacked/downed/hooked, terror radius is replaced with walking for 10-20 seconds. Also none of the killers have contact with the entity. Perhaps he makes himself, with a robot? But it messes up along the way? 
---
Like I said, it’s a great idea. You’d just have to put up another post more revised to set up the general format of the game. Before you add a new thing, ask yourself: is this similar to other killers? And How could the survivor combat that. (Also make a survivor more equipped to him) 
---
Srry if I’m coming off as rude, just trying to help
---
~~past their already promised date, but hey BHVR is perfect right~~
---
I'm gonna be honest I kind of like the rework legion got. The only thing that I think needs changing is a slight bit of extra speed during frenzy. If that happens legion would be hecking awesome
---
lightweight instead of premonition
---
For survivors most definitely. *blendette mains smirking* there is a cosmetic for claudette where she is wearing a bright silver dress. It makes her stick out so much and it makes being a killer easier lol. For killers I dont think so since the terror radius and red stain give it away
---
...they never promised a date at all? But okay.
---
Miner forty-niner
---
I think they are good, they are very difficult to use so they must have a good point about using them
---
You don't grow up normal, true, but you still grow up.
---
The Spirit is not hard to use.
---
What's your devotion? Level
---
I dont understand people who think you can only care about one thing. Discounting my concerns because "there are other more important things to worry about" is a shitty thing to do.
---
And I am as well. PTB is apparently dead after the first 4-5 days so I hope they actually keep their promise and at least attempt to make their deadline. Sadly they dont have a good track record, but I can still hope.
---
Then wow... I can definitely see this outperforming pop. Thanks👍
---
You have an ebony mori, playing billy, really good perks as well. You have 0 excuses. I actually dont have a clue how you didnt 4k.
---
When the p3 Squaddette finally meets it's match at the hands of the glorious Mookel Myers.
---
Pop has more regression and you have a lot more precision on which gen you want to regress, alot of the time with pop you don't kick the nearest gen, you hook them, see their teammates piling on a gen across the map, and haul your ass over there with pop to stop them
---
Matchmaking is rough at the moment because they're working out the kinks to get ready for dedicated servers
---

---
I didn’t discount your concerns. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I meant for myself, I don’t have that kind of energy. My day job is stressful enough that I try not to worry about the things that I enjoy.
---
Ranking system i getting even worst im at rank 5 with survivor and rank 3 with killer atm. Yesterday i went into 3 matches in a row as a survivor with rank 14 - 16 killers. All survivors ranks where at least rank 8
---
The huntress will be mad
---
You're literally rank 13 you're a baby too
---
I run Spine Chill, Lightweight, Urban Evasion, and Spring Burst.
---
Spine Chill is a must. They prevent 9/10 chases. 
---
Lightweight, Urban Evasion, and Sprint Burst go well with spine chill because they can help you get out of the area the killer is coming to with minimal chance of a chase occurring.
---
True true. I guess I hadn't thought of what it would be like if a nearby gen didnt have any progress. I guess it's just how I play b/c with spirit i can usually snatch someone from a gen and take them to nearest hook. But you make a good point
---
My devotion level is 2 and I’m level 94 so I’m about to be devotion level 3.
---
It's easier than that 2,but she is more difficult than most of the others
---
My apologies too, I sounded way more hostile than I actually meant. I'm more dejected/pessimistic about the whole thing than angry. My life seems to always be stressful and I cant really turn it off so it seeps in to the things I enjoy and can make me feel jaded at times. Again, apologies, and fingers crossed it all works out.
---
Don't even need calm spirit, iron maiden sucks big doodoo anyways
---
I think the Spirt is pretty good and is easier to play and go against. I also suck at nurse so... ya
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTVkvx9J0jk
---
*Sees proof* says nothing. Nice.
---
samination?
---
They escaped through the hatch with their keys fml
---
Without a cooldown the sound would be spammed constantly like when Spies was buffed. It should be decreased but not removed.
---
Put on Franklin's? Like. They didnt pull those out of boxes. They brought those in.
---
Self-care and take a med kit. That way you can heal at normal speed and self-care is there to fall back on if it runs out.
---
Bond is good, but better paired with Iron will. That way the killer wont catch you off guard before you’re healed. Also if your friends are newbies, you may not be able to rely on them for heals if you come across a good player who puts out a lot of pressure.
---
There just should be an easier way to get the stacks, healing a teammate from start to end should give you an stack. I mean it would literally no one
---
Fuck off
---
if survivors need a key to escape thats a win for the killer
---
She cant be THAT easy as in low ranks much like Nurse, baby spirits are easy as hell to escape from.
---
Hillbilly on the other hand, thats the one thats easy to play and dominates the low ranks.
---
Nah, WGLF doesn't need a bonus.
---
I never used this build but
---
-Nurse with double range add ons, mori, Ruin, Noed, BBQ and Franklins Demise if you wanna be extra toxic
---
Now I will never not see *old man* Quentin
---
I think about Bond cause i images when i get hurt and i can see where are my friends and let them heal me. Can i ask ? How long selfcare and friendheal take ?
---
Play the survivor you hate the most. For me it’s Claudette. Deep down theres a part of me thats hoping the killer catches me and moris me.
---
yeah fair and balanced.
---
Probably bond. Your teammates can heal you and its better to prioritize a gen over a heal with self care considering it takes forever.
---
Tl;dr: Bunny Momma will fuck you up big time, but is a loud slowpoke.
---
Spirit is 110. Huntress is *very* good at getting downs quickly, but you can also prolong a chase for good amount of time depending on the obstacles around you when the chase starts. Her map control is garbage with 110% speed &amp; no movement ability (long range hits only kinda count &amp; are easily avoidable if you see the hatchet coming). The lullaby also serves as a warning, though the heartbeat is when people often start to move, but it makes it harder for her to find  survivors.
---
Billy &amp; Nurse get downs almost/just as fast if they're actually good &amp; have abilities that tremendously increase their mobility as well, which means they have much better map control than Huntress.
---
Spirit &amp; Hag play very differently than Huntress, but have similar strengths &amp; weaknesses, but have abilities that help them move so they have better map control.
---
Anyone else see a pumpkin or just me?
---
😩💦💦
---
Thanks man.
---
Also I have never heard of "Spring Burst" lol
---
Best swf perks are borrowed time, no one left behind, leader, and well make it. But only do like 2-3 of these and take a perk for your self like decisive,deliverance, or mettle. And a med kit if your purpose is to carry
---
#QuentinRights
---
The unhook requirement makes altruism a competition (which I think is unhealthy for the game.) Stacks should definitely be easier to earn (especially considering survivor point generation) compared to killer’s
---
God the guy describing Dbd has no idea what he's talking about. Could he even be bothered to read the wiki?
---
when I first started playing this game I thought she was supposed to be an old lady in her 50s.
---
There's a lot of salt in seven seas
---
Because other games are extremely greedy that means it's ok for others to be too? Just saying that's a shitty metric of measuring a fair price
---
Ash main here, Evil Dead fan of almost 20 years now.
---
I scare to run distraction without Ẽhaustion perk :(
---
the first picture is an accurate representation of the hitbox though.
---
I don’t have Franklin’s. This is the first game I’ve played where I felt like I needed it.
---
Probably not as bugged as Dead By Daylight 🤣
---
You should've gotten it anyways. You have chili, and it's been in the shrine multiple times.
---
Im stupid so what’s so crazy about this?
---
Spirit takes little skill. For fuck’s sake standing still can literally get you downs. They need to add some sort of indication of where she’s going while phasing
---
Playing the game and chasing the people directly in front of you is scummy alright
---
It’s a crutch. I’ve got over 1000 hours in the game, and you can always tel if the killer has NOED because they’ll always he a bad player. Its not just me saying this either, its common knowledge. It shows what perk is carrying them.
---
As others have said, cleansing totems can be awkward for solo players. I’ve had situations where I’ve done 4 and gone down to NOED because the other 3 survivors couldnt do a single totem between them. I’ve had games where I’ve spent the last few minutes being useless to my team running around looking for the 5th totem unaware someone had already cleansed it. Its hard on solos and not a problem for 3-4 man swf when really its swf you need it most against.
---
There are also those games where the killer will take an OP build like omegablink Nurse or take an ebony and NOED, and they expect you to do 5 gens AND the totems on top while the killer is using an ebony?
---
Its garbage pretty much. A lot of people will pair it with bloodwarden or remember me too. Bitter murmer seems to be very common as well these days. They play shit so just expect NOED to carry them at the end.
---
I dont use it because it doesn’t feel rewarding.
---
Someone once called me a toxic killer because I didn't want to farm with them
---
The only cosmetic that helps any killer are the spirits head cosmetic, since without her tall hair she can mindgame around loops easier.
---
Don’t worry we’re getting a bunch of new stuff to do when they release the archives
---
DID SOMEBODY SAY HEATHEN?!
---
If your with swf you’ll probably say where you guys are and won’t need bond.
---
Its the same date besides the year
---
Thanks, man! (Even tho it was because of the Mori..)
---
You did well pilot Ace &lt;3
---
This man is a god.
---
Does anyone feel like season 2 totally expanded the universe of stranger things in the wrong direction? The demagorgan was this mysterious big bad monster that you didn't quite understand, and season 2 just decided to make him really lame. Season 3 the show got better but there's still no justice done for the OG demagorgan.
---
BHVR need to do a full scale survivor 3d model and texture update along with adding dynamic lighting and shadow back to the game for that tense atmosphere and genuine hiding spots.
---
Well they can carry that perk maybe as well (if you play swf). I still prefer selfcare. I got the purple one from selfcare (highest one). And I heal so fast. And also others that are hurt (also got a perk for that) I can see when my teammates are hurt so I can see them and heal them super fast.
---
I was really hoping he would have a Freddy feel and you got sucked into the upside down.
---
People can beg all they want but yknow it aint up to the actor or BHVR its up to the rights owners to the movie/actors likeness
---
Wait bro how did I steal ur meme lmao check google there r so many memes abt chase music but not seeing any survivors
---
There was once a claudette cosmetic that literally made you immune to hag traps, you literally did not trigger them, I wish I was joking but I'm not.
---
Because why waste a perk slot for a slow heal when you can bring in an item and heal quickly or instantly?
---
N this is butter not a cat lol
---
Interesting, so how would his dynamite work close range. And how many stick would he get.
---
*doesn't get the unhook*
---
GHOST FACE IS SCUMLORD... THEY ALL PLAY LIKE SHIT TO TOP IT OFF
---
you think those 3 survivors enjoy playing against spirit? 
---
good joke (':
---
Question: Does Whispers ignore the person on the hook or is it active the whole time if you’re camping?
---
Nah, I think they’re tinkering with matchmaking again at the moment, it’s been a bit temperamental. I had [this match](https://imgur.com/a/v1V5top) yesterday, I was the red rank and playing solo.
---
How the frick did you make Quentin look decent

---
The game might have thought they matched your rank because they've got high ranks and still use Sprint Burst and Self-care (issajoke)
---
oh, I'm not the only one here. Is the match making system bugged or there's literally no one playing the game anymore?
---
So tell me what’s overpowered about these perks

I'm halfway through 8. I have no life

If it does it again, it'll end up in blackreach
---
I have had since first week. When you are the last survivor work a gen even if none are done. When the killer closes the hatch it will kick you off the gen. If you escape thru the gates you will get this trophy. It does not have to be the 5th gen.
---
I got my first angry message from some survivors saying I was a baby killer and couldn’t catch them.. when I killed all of the. They then reply to that with yeah but you were looped and palleted so many times. So I said “ok and? You still died dude.” It’s honestly hilarious seeing shit like that it’s honestly pathetic babying a killer that you lost to who didn’t camp or tunnel mind you because they lost.
---
The 4th Blendette be cleansing yo Hex Totem.
---
Um, remember that it’s just a game, if a game makes you feel that bad, you shouldn’t play it... cause that doesn’t sound healthy.
---
Yes. It can be frustrating if you’re playing survivor, but it’s just more of a challenge! Playing killer is fun too!
---
They are not the clown, they are the entire circus!
---
You literally put it in the title of this post that you tunneled the dude.  How are you backtracking on that lol?
---
Urban Evasion, Iron Will, Spine Chill, Lightweight. This build allows you to lose the killer in a chase extremely quickly even if they found you in your original hiding spot and gave you a love tap with their weapon. Just bring a good medkit with you to support yourself
---
Like the previous comment said... as a survivor so long as you can hear a terror radius and a general sense of direction you should be fine👌. BUT if you play killer I highly recommend getting yourself a good set of headphones. In some situations you must pinpoint the survivors based on sound alone. I play spirit and the biggest thing for me is being able to attack immediately after I phase. I use scratch marks to tell me which general direction they are and pinpoint them by their breathing and their grunts.
---
Well following that logic, you're telling all killers that facecamping is acceptable if it's their preferred playstyle
---
Honestly I feel like if your still really interested despite having no one to play it with, it will be worth it; Especially if you enjoy playing as killer.
---
By your orders, Captain. I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in Haddonfield.
---
Does anyone understand why they can't yet? Or do you guys gotta keep bringing this up every 2 months?
---
Former Pig main turned Ghostface. I feel like Ghostface is the perfect blend of Pig and Myers, without head traps that is, lol. Ghostface mori is my favorite mori in the game at the moment also.
---
What was it called?
---
And I respect your opinion and hope you have a wonderful day
---
Match starts, autohaven wreckers. 
---
Ryuk: *scribbles, Meg, Dwight, David, Claudette”
---
Game ends 60 seconds later. 
---
Sounds pretty balanced ngl.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I try to run and take up the killers time as much as I can but I am not the best at it.
---
Guy above me said it
---
I think it should give something. I've always thought it would be good merged with BT. It would give some protection from farming to the person getting unhooked.
---
I hate you but take this fucking upvote
---
I was thinking 3, boostable by perks like the Huntress' hatchets. Fuse time and throw distance would also be perk-adjustable.
---
As for short range, you'd either have to cook it before throwing it (which would slow down your movement making it easier for them to just run out of line of sight) and run the risk of hitting yourself, or throw it ahead of them to try and funnel them back towards you or in a different direction. A particularly clever Powder could intentionally throw one in one direction then another ahead of the Survivor, so they run from the one infront of them and straight into the one you threw first.
---
I made a thread on this, I check all streamers I face cause I like to play spooky killers.
---
Hearing them all salty and poor sports makes me wish I didn't visit, but I do cause I also like to hear them jump.
---
Awesome. I started playing August 20th last year.
---
Dying game. What did you expect?
---
20/30/40 second cooldown imo
---
I mean we do not know what the true form of it is as well and he can transform as well so we really do not know how it would work out at all. even if pennywise does what he does for primal reasons he would still defend himself if the entity tried to take him. but I guess this is all just opinions anyway
---
acceptable or not every one is dealing with it
---
Some people are used to really little ping games. I used to have that same internet and most people have green ping yet people constantly called me a lag switcher the problem probaly is that sometimes those speeds can drop down to less, a small spike can ruin chases. I get 40 mbps and I haven't heard it people complaining in over a year.
---
Regardless it wont matter once dedicated servers are out :))
---
Maybe I can clear a few things up here. When I said rank 2 was over-inflated I was referring to the unusually high skill requirement necessary to reach red ranks during that period of time. The survivors that did make it to red ranks were more skilled on average than the usual players killers would be going up against, and therefore had an unusually high survival rate during that period. They were overinflated for all of red ranks though, not just rank 2. This effect is then further compounded by the fact that there is a massive skew in the data taken specifically at rank 1. None of this was conjecture, all of this information about the statistics being skewed was acknowledged by the devs later on in the stats post.  
---
  
---
The reason that there is not a balance between rank 1 and 2 is due to asymmetry around the boundary. On the left there is a region (rank 2) with 5 pips, and on the right there is a region (rank 1) with only one pip. People who are in rank two can enter rank 1 from rank 2 pip 4, and rank 2 pip 3 via the double pip. Players who have done well and likely survived from rank 2 are counted in the statistics as rank 1, whereas players who have done poorly at rank 1 are demoted to rank 2 before being counted. Because rank 2 has 5 pips, and because it's easier to achieve, it has a higher population. The flux of players being demoted to rank 2 for the statistics doesn't affect the rank 2 data much, whereas the flux up into rank 1 does, because it's population is so small. If anything we should expect that the flux down from rank one would suppress the win-rate slightly at rank 2 only, but again this effect is small.  
---
With the difference between a rank 1-2 player being only whether they won or lost their last game, it's not too much of a stretch to say there there should not be a significant difference in survival rate between the two, and certainly not 20%. If we take the rank 2 data to be accurate we would be looking at a survival rate of ~60%. If you believe me and the devs that the pip system requirements caused an unbalanced distribution of high skilled players, then we can assume that the general survival rate of survivors at the top ranks is somewhere below 60%.
---
not true. I'm a soloQ and i love the fuck out of this game
---
Depends. I've only been camped once. To be fair though, I play killer most of the time. And no, I don't facecamp there because I know what garbage experience that is as survivor and even as killer, since it is boring as hell
---
Sexy?
---
Both
---
As i just faced another ghost face that does chodefaces only tactic of hook once then proc hide ability and camp until your dead...ghost faces are all trash
---
Och aye
---
I'd tell you it's worth it for sure. The game can be very upsetting but that thrill of the kill or escape is legit.
---
you don't really need predictions since they fixed the survivors round. You just need a headset and high rank killer aren't the kind of guys playing in hard mode as we know.
---
Excellent
---
Mostly the mori people run noed anyway
---
Idk why but the hex ones are always funny to me
---
Great series, awesome books.
---
I once found a Dwight as the last survivor, he was obviously scared because I moried all of his friends. He started to run away but I noticed that he wasn't running to any loops he just ran towards some corner of the map. After a bit of chasing he decided to hide behind a tree, I played a bit of peekaboo with him before I downed him and dropped him on the hatch. And then there's the moment of truth, in the end screen you see that the only one that escaped is indeed a rank 20 with only bond level 1 :')
---
God I love baby Dwights they warm my heart
---
Season 2 was trash for a lot of reasons.
---
Toxic trash killer mindset in a nutshell... when I see nearby people trying to unhook I pick one of em and chase em to death... you can rehook the previous person later, it only takes 3 hooks to kill em outright. There's no reason to stop points from being gotten all together and intentionally try to derank the poor guy you hit 1 fucking time. Its weak as fuck and shows how trash you are.. I even go after the one who unhooked them instead of the person who was hooked. Everyone can get points if you choose not to be an ignorant unskilled asshole. Its not hard...
---
Maybe you should learn to read comments properly before replying.
---
Big brain plays
---
You are allowed to be delusional
---
Maybe merging WGLF and We'll make it could actually be interesting, like you heal 100% faster and if you manage to heal the person completely you get a stack ?
---
it would still be worse than spine chill
---
I'd envision some sort of power that infects for The Master, slowly corrupting over time, periodically revealing survivor locations, causing harder skill checks perhaps. Some sort of cleanse mechanic to rid yourself of the infection? Not sure, but sounds interesting!
---
That’s understandable on there part as it’s difficult to open the exit gates when endgame collapse starts.
---
I once got yelled at for running franklins and lightborn when i saw 4 flashlights in the lobby before the match.

Your mori balanced it out.

did someone say a darkness is about to be.. awakened?
---
STOP MEDIUM VAULTING
---
No lol surge sucks
---
They were really salty in the endgme chat
---
Haha this got outta hand. Sure I'll tunnel on rare occasions but I dont do it as my playstyle or even consider tunneling as a viable way to play the game. This post was funny to me because the red rank had a flashlight and was teabagging and clicking his flashlight. I chased him and realized he was much better at running loops than me so when I figured out i had wasted time, I shifted my focus to stopping gens. I am the killer after all and I should play to kill the survivors not to make it easy for them. While I was getting his teammates and breaking gens he would come up to me and click his light so I in turn did tunnel him. I ONLY tunneled him this game. After I had tunneled him (which I only did because they kept wanting me to chase them) he got mad and sent me the message saying I'm good at tunneling which I think we can all agree was toxic on his part. If I am not allowed to tunnel people like this then survivor should not be able to tbag at pallets and force killers to chase them. You seem to forget that I also have the ability to play as a survivor and I also dont like it when there is say a cannibal camping us or a huntress tunneling each of us 1 by 1. If I dont like that happening to me I would not try to play like that myself. Look at it from my POV. You hop on what you think will be a regular game. Right off the bat you see a survivor purposely walk towards me as the killer and start clicking his light. I obviously chase him and see that I am not catching up to him. He waits at pallets, teabags, and emotes. You think hes not worth it you cant catch him.You get a gen skill check fail notification so you instead go to that. The first survivor follows you and and constantly tries to get your attention. After you hook one of his teammates you go to break a gen. The survivor gets unhooked so you head back towards the area and lo and behold the first survivor is standing under the hook teabagging.At this point you can go for others or try to get rid of person who you see as a huge threat now.  I sweat so hard trying to catch him that I finally get him down. The others finished 1 gen. You hook him and leave. He gets unhooked you go back he is getting healed near the hook. I have two choices here. Go for full health healer or injured healee( which happens to be the red rank unbeknownst to me at the time.) So I go for what is causing me the problems and go for flashlight survivor. I do this again and go for 2nd hook and I think hes had enough. I'm not going to do final hook. I snatch one of his mates from gen and omw to hook here is flashlight survivor crouching under hook trying to body block. What do I do? Let him stay there and body block me and potentially prevent the hook?no.again I am the killer I dont play to let survivors win I play to stop them from doing so while trying to make the game fun.So I swing. He is in dying state. I hook the one I have. Take 1st survivor to hook and he dies. Shortly after I get his message and kill the rest of his team. After the game I see his rank I was thinking that maybe he is like rank 8 or something. But what do I see. A rainbow matchmaking system with the toxic survivor being rank two. I screenshot and post. I figured he would be better rank than me by the way he played but rank 2?!? So yes i did tunnel this one guy this one game. But what was I to do. The survivors should also know what to do if I am tunneling which would make them complete gens and escape but as you can see no one escaped. It's my 2nd week on the game and I run into this team with a level 2,6,8, and 13. With the most annoying player I've ever played. And I won. With 4 kills. I dont tunnel the whole team. Just the one guy. I hardly ever play like this and i apologize for any confusion that it caused. There were good discussions and arguments tho. This is also my first day on reddit and I actually enjoy it👍

Not 100% that would make botany knowledge useless
---
Today is the day, im sure of it.
---
It is definitely worth it! I must say, I regret not getting the Halloween DLC for just +2€ back when I bought the game but I'd really think about if it's worth it spending 30€ on ALL DLCs . There's certain killers I'll never play so I've bought the ones I really want with iridescent shards (in-game currency).
---
Nancy is 300% the dom in this 3 way relationship
---
You could write an encyclopedia on the potential uses of DH. Most people who are new to using is will just try to use it to dodge a swing and stay up for an extra 2 seconds. It's good to see some creativity.   
---
If you're interesting in those kinds of maneuvers, I've been practicing a tech with DH and BT recently to save survivors from camping. You bait a hit, then pull them off. Right when the killer is ready to swing again you DH through the survivor you just pulled off so they take the hit and proc the BT. It's the only way I've found to get the save without trading one for one.

Best way to get good is to player killer until a survivor owns you, and figure out how he did it. Then you play survivor with your new knowledge until a killer owns you, and figure out how he did it. Rinse a repeat until you are rank 1 on both. To master anything you must approach it from all angles, and learn every aspect.
---
The rank difference happened
---
Every fucking time. 11/10 waffles.

I have no idea but that would be cool I think, it would also get me more of that god old immersion....mmmmm...’mersion

Since most randoms don’t want to do gens, altruism and boldness is where I get my points.
---
I can imagine clown trying it on and going" if this fools anyone, they deserve it,"
---
Yes, He's the friendly hybrid vamp hunting the Master.
---
He kinda doesn't have a choice. The entity went out of its way to go to party city

I was complimented you I guess it just didn’t appear

Kinda feel bad for that Feng, did she spawn in the killer terror radius lol
---
Man, I should start using my silly names more often if people are gonna make compilations.

You really don't know what the prediction is do you.

At the most you could say they suggested it but a prediction will require them to make a guess on what it's going to be.

Which this clearly I said above it's a suggestion hell even one linked with a petition
---
What is the history behind the evolution of this meme?
---
Man, I did that in the hope that the russkie betrayer didn't get the hatch, since I obviously saw him camping on it. Killer found him the moment I was lift into the sky. Satisfying af
---
According to the women in my area it does
---
i read your comment? You seem to think that this game is only for SWF. Which isn't true at all.
---
Or a x % healing speed bonus per token ?
---
I personally have not used surround sound speakers myself so I do not not. If you have them available and are able to try it then by all means do so and tell us the results. I cannot vouch for them though.
---
Turn back! For the love of the entity turn back!

Word. I love Legion and his aesthetic and that idea of being quick and agile but it really doesn't feel that great to vault over pallets and windows since when in first person you can't look around during the action and it's also slower than what survivors can.  
---
 Really wish they had full speed vault and could look at least like a 30 degree cone in front of you whilst vaulting to keep an eye on survivors that run to the side when you vault after them.
---
I see no issue with this photo, if it is about the red ranks? Suck it up brother, welcome to Torment Town where the devs cant be bothered reconfiguring the matchmaking system to avoid this.
---
People still complain about legion...
---
40 second later*
---
Holy SHIT YOU'RE RIGHT!  
---
THIS MAN IS A GENIUS!
---
You are using a meta Billy build with double turning add-ons and ebony mori. Quit crying
---
Have fun hitting that.
---
Is TBing really that bad though? For me, it's one of the only ways to comunicate in the game. Want to heal someone working on gens? Teabag. Want to get the killer to chase you? Teabag. Want to thanks someone for saving/healing you? Teabag. Want someone to follow you? Teabag. Want to split up? Teabag. Want to show respect for the killer after a good game? Teabag GG at the exit gates in morse code
---
**SEND THY HEATHEN TO THE MINDFLAYER GOLEM FLESHPIT**
---
Agreed. Spirit is the epitome of cancer in this game. Give me Nurse anyday.
---
Prob not with billy only works with basic attacks
---
Its more like “Now that the opposing side has had this nerfed, lets move onto their second strongest”.
---
And Nurse needs a nerf more so than Spirit. Anyone can tell you that. At least Spirit is blocked by walls and has a cooldown on her power.
---
Nice. Ah, such a good feeling isn't it when you see your work paying off.
---
Same!
---
Yeah go on
---
Lol yessss

We don't care why.

Watching people repairing a gen for 1 hour while a claudette hides in a bush, and a meg clicliclicliclic some killer ?
---
I was spectating a friend that hasn’t played in a long time.
---
I bought him because of his face...
---
&gt; how does it get any better?
---
Steve Harrington
---
Yup. That or a longer frenzy.
---
I don't think there is any f2p stealth build, or at least a good one
---
I've begun the adopt a player process with a r20 Ghostface that didn't play any killer and had to convince the dude to keep going since I was r10 and he had another SWF besides me in the thing that he only killed one, encourage any baby killer/survs you find, if they have all rank 3 perks at r20, for the love of God please flame them for making the game worse for the influx of new people  that's happening. 
---
Just a PSA from a dick that wants more people to understand it takes time to git gud
---
But wait you mean killer builds or sr builds?
---
With the way Deep Wound works now I think they can easily get away with putting the movement speed back up.
---
I love the drawing, But should I feel bad for seeing huntress's hand on Ricardo's shoulder?
---
Pretty much. Which is ironic because he used to like Spirit. He put out a video saying all you need for Spirit is good headphones and suddenly thats all everyone is repeating.
---
Basically online influencer/streamer says X, now everyone repeats and feels justified disconnecting against said killer.
---
Glad you notice its come along so suddenly. It all happened as soon as the devs confirmed they were nerfing Nurses add-ons and basekit. With Nurse out of the way they’ve now moved on to a new target. Thats why it has all come about so suddenly.
---
After Spirit gets nerfed it will be back to Billy. Moris too.
---
Now dont get me wrong there is some broken shit in this game. I hate Billy more than anyone and I hate moris. However if people get their way we’ll end up where the strongest killers in the game are Hag and Huntress. Even the best players of those killers will tel you they get destroyed by a co-ordinated swf.
---
Very optimistic, aren't you? I said the lore of the game, not the gameplay.
---
Plus you repair / heal faster when spine chill is active
---
thx for the spoiler tag, big stuff hidden there

---
Ive never seen a post on this subreddit with that many upvotes before...
---
Holy shit man, congrats I'll never attempt the platinum because of the nurse trophies
---
Some of my favs.
---
1. Bet you think you're good cause you play spirit
---
Get gud. (I wrecked their whole team)
---
2. Tunnel much? (I didn't even tunnel, this bitch just sucks at hiding with her bright blue hair and i had just hooked another person. Nea btw)
---
Headphones are the best, I remember I used to ALWAYS use headphones. Then I started playing without them and my game suffered. You hear all the little stuff, all the detail.
---
The artworks are always better than the ingame models. 
---
The green hair Nea on the artwork is a solid 10/10 but looks like a dirty hooker ingame.
---
Definitely where devs recorded the sound from
---
I have gotten so many comments saying that i suck at killer when i kill their whole team.....
---
Ikr??
---
Welp, I don't feel bad for not playing the game for so long now, the place's a shitshow as always.
---
100% agreed, love this guy. Makes my days better when he posts, and he's such a great mix of real person and memes.
---
"baby" just means new or inexperienced.
---
Hey I made this
---
Alright, that change a lot of things, spin chill + urban evasion is a good combo for the base, then just support perks like pebble or the one from tap that all the skill checks are great for examples
---
That is exactly the same reason I like him.lol he is one of the few youtubers I have notifications on. Aside from being funny I actually learned quite a bit playing killer
---
You don't need dlc at all. You only need dlc to be able to pick the characters you can play with our against any.
---
Legion is my second main and it's sad that he's not where he should be.
---
That said, I played 5 matches as survivor yesterday and they were all Legion. Really weird, usually I don't face them too often.
---
I feel like Piggy is the smartest of the killers. Being the first to have two abilities and using stealth without a power for it. She also seems to be one of the killers that doesn't like the entity but works for it to avoid death or something worse.
---
Definitely feel like she would be the most reasonable killer. Or maybe Huntress if you are a little girl. Feng is squeaky enough to fool her perhaps
---
Also very cute. Good job
---
Game is perfectly playable without a single DLC. Strongest killers are in base game or can be unlocked through playtime. Survivors are mostly just skins, and you can get a pretty strong build without DLC perks.
---
Important DLC: for killers it's Leatherface DLC, because BBQ is a must have perk, in my opinion.
---
The actor posted a tweet in support of this. He would love to be in a game. Unfortunately the licensing won't allow it. They could at least make him look human though. Along with a few other survivors that need a touch-up. Most notably Nea having a Fallout 3 Neck seam on her portrait but not in game.
---
L
---
Better be an exhaustion perk
---
Yeah, right now i am using a healer/stealth f2p build with claudette. Self care, Spine chill, Botany knowledge, Empathy
---
Yo, this is important. Pokeland has catholicism.
---
So the learherface dlc gives you access to a perk kalled bbq and chili which most killers would say is mandatory, the ghostface dlc is really fun in a lot of peoples opinions, but no you don’t really need any dlc to play the game properly, also most dlc is available for free through playtime but it requires quite a lot of playtime.
---
Maybe even a separate movie for the background of the non-licensed killer.
---
Spine chill, urban evasion, iron will, light weight. Get a notification when the killer is looking in your direction and then urban away. If your injured iron will helps out a lot especially against the doctor and spirit who rely heavily on sound notifications. And light weight will help your stealth if your hit. Use your sprint burst from being injured and then run around corners or break line of sight. Then urban away and iron will will keep you hidden. Light weight helps with running around between gens and after your hit. All the perks are on free survivors.
---
You're forgetting the get out of jail free card on everything:
---
"ENTITY MAGIC."
---
i saw a guy named hex: devour coke once
---
by f2p, i meant no teachables to other survivors. nonetheless, sounds like a great stealth build!
---
Better then me I guess.
---
Might wanna open it up then my one friend did and hasn’t had an issue since but definitely dont if ur scared u might break it, take it to a pro
---
Nothing wrong here
---
With these changes maybe 110% ?
---
Tbh killer mains think everything is toxic.
---
You just have to listen closely for the skill check sound and with practice, you’ll get the timing down. Since you’re a beginner, I recommend getting good skill checks down before you go for great skill checks. It just comes with time and one day you’ll notice that you’re hitting great skill checks out of nowhere.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Well yes If everyone is surrounding you but actually no if everyone is gone.
---
When huntress charges her hatchet she has a bubble around her where the hatchets can't hit a survivor, I don't know the reason behind this feature.
---
I'm quite sure everyone has lost track already
---
This is very true and kind of sad. It just proves that a lot of survivor mains are entitled.

The killer only gets four perks, four survivors get sixteen, hence why killer perks tend to have more uses. I'd be fine with WGLF stacks being easier to get but it doesn't need an extra effect.
---
U are a clown
---
On some real shit tho. You right lmao
---
Its icon should just light up when you are facing the direction of the killer when hes in a certain distance, like spine chill.
---
Add toxic killers too
---
I heard it's canon that the reason there's only one pig is because the other two made their houses out of straw and sticks like idiots.
---
Oh, I have a new build now.
---
I STILL HATE
---
Sounds were fine for her up until the December 2018 Legion update. Then broken, then fixed briefly, then broken. I’d argue sounds right now still aren’t as good as they were last November.
---
Dont kid yourself, complaints have skyrocketed because now Nurse is out of the way we just move down the tier list nerfing the next killers. I wonder where it will stop. Not being sarcastic, I’m genuinely curious where on the tier list people will consider balanced.
---
And most people as I said feel justified in their posts after a few streamers made the same points. Newsflash: Jund is a douche who thinks the sun shines out of his girlfriends ass and shills for her at every opportunity even though shes one of the most toxic and privileged shits in the community.
---
well no because when myers was added to the game it was after legacy was input to the game which if i remember correctly and i do there was no such things as ultra rare perks. so do your research before you come at a guy who knows pretty much everything about this game
---
Similarly, if something goes wrong for you as a killer, don’t dc because you can still turn it around. I was playing against a 4 man SWF the other day, they got my Ruin before the first down and never triggered my Haunted Grounds, so I was basically running 2 perks for that entire game. (Side note, my Ruin has been destroyed first in 10 of my last 12 matches. Seriously. I counted). Still managed to kill 3 of the 4 and the sole survivor was on death hook.
---
In contrast, I was facing a Trapper who stepped in his own trap on accident while carrying a survivor and DC’d immediately. There were still 5 gens remaining and the person he dropped was stuck in a corner, but Trapper DC’d before he could see that.
---
They must have. Otherwise it’s kinda fucked up.
---
i honestly like the ingame more
---
Love it!
---
Oh god, I just realized, with Nancy and Steve being put into DBD that means SFM are going to have high quality, accurate 3D models of them for their....purposes.

please tell me you're kidding, please just tell me that this was not something you found randomly in a match and that this was actually something orchestrated for the picture in a kill your friends.

I'll litterally lose faith in all randoms if this was found in a rank 10+ match

Ok thanks!

Now that's a sexy clown.

Well I don't know if someone would be interested to produce it. However, I would definitely post the screenplay in the sub when I will finish it.

Hex: Jake
---
2/3/4 survivors are affected by Jake. While the Hex totem is active, the survivor must complete a sabotage action before proceeding with any other action, Like healing, repairing, cleansing.
---
PLAYED A GAME AGAINST A PLAGUE LAST NIGHT AND SHE INFECTED ALL FOUR SURVIVORS THEN RAGE QUIT ON THE LAST GEN BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO CLEANSE THE WHOLE MATCH! RAGE FEEDBACK LOOP.
---
Ruin with Pop and slugging but the problem is DS. Reddit killers in a nutshell. gotcha
---
If you truly like the game for what it is than yes. I bought it to play with friends but ended up being the only one playing it. I love DBD. And you can always join youtuber's servers (like n00b3) and play with randoms. It is fun to meet people. Especially when they are nice and helpful. Just prepare for toxic players that point out every mistake you do as you start the game.
---
Real quick...
---
She literally can't see you in her ability??!!
---
Fuck yeah, good job :D
---
Well you have something to work towards then. Because all those perks are available on the base game without dlc. All it takes is a little time.

Fair enough. Although jigsaw may have been too smart for serving The Entity. He could have been a threat like Myers who is pure evil. Hence Michael Myers almost always displeasing The Entity whenever you use his powerful add-ons. He just kills people for himself. He doesn't hook them and drain their hope. He stabs them casts their bodies aside. Hence the entity hating him.
---
So you're right. The opposite could easily be true for Amanda. She was fooled into thinking she does the right thing and it feeds off of her denial or guilt.
---
I mean, the four original characters had all perks that work in a single area: Dwight is the leader which helps the rest faster, Meg is the runner that helps in chases, Meg is the support that can heal faster and Jake is the survivalist that can survive alone and get objectives without the help of others. Dwight is the "noob" because it's the first character that you star with when you open the game, just like Trapper.
---
I fourth this statement
---
Just be warned, if you play this build, you *will* be told to go kill yourself in the post game chat. This is the most obnoxious build for the most obnoxious killer. That shouldn't stop you from playing with it, just know that survivors probably won't be lining up to get your autograph afterwards.
---
I'm going to be comboing it with thrilling tremors so I get another 16 seconds of regression
---
I see Deathnote, I upvote.
---
Holy crap you have the build and everything...
---
I got called trash yesterday just for choosing to play ghostface.
---
I run deer stalker and nurses calling so ds is never a problem cause I just look at them while I chase they're friends around
---
The leather one is not very common right? The majority likes to use shirt Pig with Leather weapon
---
When I started the game for the first time back in Sept'17, Nurse was selected first. But not sure which survivor was first selected though.
---
That's me right there. I'd miss a pink hair nea with the cyan jacket in corn

Give up now, before its too late.

he probably meant "we do NOT encourage"

Spirit doesn't need nerfs, only a small change to prayer beads

Doesn't that defeat the purpose of her mind game capabilities?

Billy is an uninteresting and boring killer compared to mister legion.

Why not just use the Come Here or Go There actions?

Why did Freddy turn into Quentin with RTX?
---
So sounds were broken from December to June. She also had various bugs and stealth nerfs during that time (they added things like a tell when she phased, and a power cooldown on stun). So for the first half of this year she was weaker than she is currently. 
---
You don’t think that that contributed at all to the complaints? Or that these factors might have been the reason certain streamers started talking about her being too strong? Rather than just assuming that there’s some concerted effort to nerf Spirit because now Nurse is “out of the way” (without any confirmed details or timeline), it seems more plausible to me that people are more likely to cry for nerfs of things that are a) recently made stronger, and b) more common. Anecdotally, I used to see tons and tons of Billies at red ranks on PS4, but they’ve pretty much all been replaced by Spirits. 
---
Also I’m not sure why you think I’d care about your opinion of Scott Jund or his girlfriend, I don’t watch them and it’s totally irrelevant to my comments.
---
I love the idea of a miner themed killer and always hoped they’d add a character like this.
---
I’m honestly starting to get sick of how op the killers can be in this game, Been solo que and our whole team get wiped 3/5 games it’s so ridiculously stupid

This post may be sadder.

I had that glitch yesterday and did what everyone does jump off the edge over and over till it spawns me back on the map and it work right next to hatch

John is one of the best

It's happened with ballerina Feng too.

That’s clownery, luv
---
Are you saying ghostface is overpowered? He doesn't even compare to most top tier killers like billy, nurse, spirit or hell even hag.
---
Not to the extend they existed from Dec 2018 to June 2019. I've started playing DbD in early 2018, around Lunar's event and back then I'd maybe encounter one.. every 5-10 hours. Sometime I'd get lucky and not get one for 10+ hours, sometimes I'd get them twice in 1 hour. But realistically speaking, they were uncommon. Fast forward to the June patch that introduced the shop and Kate to us, the infinite loading screens were GONE. I haven't played a ton from mid August to around early October 2018, but during June, July, October and November I've seen ZERO infinite loading screens. The only thing that would ever happen was an uncommon softlock when you tried to join a lobby or switch menus, but again no trace of infinite loading screens. Then the fucking Legion PTB rolls around and people are telling BHVR that there's CONSTANT issues. What does BHVR do? Release the update anyway and then leave it literally unfixed for 5 months before the first little bandaid fix that SOMEWHAT helps the situation and another month+ before it's completely fixed. I still don't know if it's completely fixed since I've only played maybe 15 hours in the past 1 1/2 months, for all I know I got SUPER lucky and it's still happening every now and then.
---
They will both apply. I dont remember which ones those are, but for example if you use the circle shaped one and the beam shaped one, you'd get a circle with a line through it.
---
Quentin should look like this cause he’s ugly in the game
---
Nothing better than someone waiting at the exit gates to tbag without knowing Blood Warden popped. Beautiful.
---
BUT ITS THE BOLDEST!
---
Ds normally isnt a problem but it's not fun when the survivors play like idiots and allow me to get a hook plus two downs all right next to each other then I get robbed of all three because two people ran a single perk.
---
It shouldn’t be that hard it’s fucking freddy the corn field and is white as fuck
---
Can you see my comment? If not you a bitch. If so you ain't a bitch and I love you.

Survivors working with the killer to farm you to death.
---
Him and Monto are great
---
True but I usually slug and let them bleed out a bit before I pick them up
---
If you’re going to teabag and flashlight me at every pallet of course I’m going to go after you first not to mention insta heal. Just don’t do that and I won’t tunnel you.
---
Errect and proud
---
The thing about ds is that it's not completely anti tunnel like people say though. In this clip I downed the feng, managed to down two separate people, get a hook and she still had it. I think the concept is fine but I think the requirements should be different. Maybe if you're picked up twice in a row?
---
You mean distortion?

You absolute madlad. What rank is this ?

If you like being told how worthless you are, yeah get it.

Wtf is this from

Then maybe it could be pretty good on Myers and Ghostie

&gt;I haven't got a single infinite loading screen in like 1.5 years.
---
Clear lie and/or you haven't played at all for the past half year.
---
&gt;And I can't believe you just said "not to the extent they existed from dec 2018 to june 2019".
---
I haven't played in 2016
---
&gt;Back in the day in 2016 people were getting infinite loading screens every 3 games.
---
And from December to May their frequency was similar to that. At times I couldn't go an hour without seeing 3 of those things, sometimes in a row. Ask ANYONE on PC how often these issues happened from December to May. It wasn't until early May when they reduced the frequency of this issue. I've heard that some people, XBox players, were more lucky and haven't got them as often, but both PC and PS4 players have been screwed over by them.

Here's a question, what if I bring a flashlight because it's an item put in the game for a reason, but I don't bring it to, as you put it 'annoy you' but use it to save survivors when you pick them up and blind at pallets to get away. But not intentionally annoy you.
---
How do you know a survivor is being toxic for using a flashlight as opposed to them just bring a useful item when used correctly?
---
Steam?
---
I’m aiming to get all my remaining Survivors to P3 before the change, just because it gives me something to do and the perk grind will be halved when the update comes out.
---

---
Idk
---
He didnt mori him, the survivor Just bled out.
---
I didn't know there was music that played on the maps until I used headphones so i would highly recommend them
---
I think it's more of a legal issue than anything sadly, not sure if they can do anything else
---
Hatchet's inconsistency is so consistent making them perfectly balanced^(as all things should be...)
---
I don't think you quite understand what that means...
---
It's obvious to me. I dont think its toxic if I get blinded in hopes to save someone I just grabbed. It is toxic when they are standing next to a pallet teabagging or when I'm going for someone else and they are clicking it to get my attention. I understand distraction but there are some cases where it is annoying. I'm not saying "oh you have a flashlight...you must be toxic" by any means.
---
If you want to know why I made this it's a bit long but it's all here. I give a example of a game i had where i would say a guy was toxic after i showed no interest in him because i knew he was better than me and he was probably going to loop me forever.

As a killer main with around 100 hours ig I only facecamp if survivor tbags, is toxic and overall tries to piss me off
---
Anyways, great video!
---
Damn, how many hours you have in game???
---
Depends what it looks for. If your macro presses the keys in the exact same time interval, that's something that can be clearly detected as not done by a human.
---
🦀🦀 VAXEI IS POWERLESS AGAINST THE CRAPPER 🦀🦀
---
Same with that glitch where you can't escape
---
Yeah being picked up twice in a row is better, and it shouldn't work if you get grabbed from a locker
---
She looks like someone threw a bucket of straw and tar on her.
---
I’d say that looks axeceptionally good.
---
Spine Chill, Urban, Balanced landing, streetwise
---
They could just go back and buy the likeness for Quentin. And get some cosmetics while they're there. 
---
They evidently went back to the owners of the SAW franchise to renegotiate for more cosmetics, so there is no reason why they can't do the same.
---
Direct point. Thanks bro !
---
It only makes a difference when you're trying to collect all perks or a specific build at level 40+, so if you're just working on progressing characters normally, no real change.
---
Also you're only guaranteed to get 1 perk that you want + 1 other, you can't guarantee the 2 perks you want from a web which is going to make it really frustrating.
---
My point! We shouldn't complain because Dwight helps everyone else at the same time
---
Bond. It can give you so much information. If your team gives extremely good callouts, I would bring we'll make it instead of bond.
---
Lol
---
GETTING 1.9 FUCKING PIPS INSTEAD OF 2 SO I CANT GET MY DAMN ADEPT KILLER!!!
---
He's big, very bulky.
---
Wtf are you talking about.
---
Side parted curls
---
Take that stuff to r/dbdgonewild and keep it there.
---
Only a true clown knows where the circus is. That being Father Cambell's Chapell
---
Why not both?
---
What if you combine them and pop  2 gens at once
---
Again you didn't really explain yourself, you just said that you disagree. Saying that most survivor perks are bad isn't a reason to buff WGLF by giving it an extra effect, it's a reason to buff weaker perks of which there are plenty.
---
Ahem
---
Use DS and Spine chill
---
You really want Spine Chill (available all), basically the icon will light up when the killer is looking in your direction and inside a certain distance.
---
The other one I would be either Bond (Dwight) or Empathy (Claudette), both will give you battlefield awareness as they track players running around the map.
---
Finally Light steps? Which will make your scratch marks fade faster and allow you to run away safely.
---
Why?!
---
*use torch to blind killer*
---
the downvotes are kink shamers, you do you!
---
Nah I mean my teammates did all the gens, I was still a baby survivor but I was able to loop this Wraith, couldn't escape from the camp tho
---
I'm not clicking this.
---
Survivor with flashlight is like survivor with OoO in SWF, (especially if it's survivor with flashlight in SWF). If you save someone with a flashlight, you'll try to do it again. In order to prevent that you must be dead.
---
I agree. Bullying baby Dwight's and baby killers turns new players off of the game. We all have to be nice for the surge of stranger things fans that is coming and show them that this is a nice game. With a non toxic community and maybe with more players wait times wont be long and matchmaking will be more even
---
You shouldn’t.
---
Yep for sure. The teammates probably won because of you👍👍
---
You forgot the "because they suck ass at this game".
---
I only tunnel people who teabag
---
There isn't one. It's completely subjective. There is a meta though which typically consists of self care, adrenaline, balanced landing and decisive strike. I personally think DS isnt very good if you are decent at the game and self care is good imo, but I totally see why people don't like it. Definitely imo a best survivor build would include and exhaustion perk and adrenaline. I personally switch it up a lot, but I think my 'meta' build is self care, balanced landing(though I switch exhaustion perks alot) adrenaline and spine chill.
---
Not funny didn’t laff
---
The amount of hairspray required to upkeep that 70's feathered look seems about right for defying hair physics.
---
yes
---
"Hes speaking the language of GODS" but on some real I guess I never thought of it. For the way I run pop right now I just use hook the survivor and break nearest gen. So I assumed pop would be the same. But I guess for others that are anti gen builds it could work
---
thanks for the help but ton of spirits run the silent phasing add-on which is pretty much game over
---
Bond = best survivor perk imo
---
It's not really supposed 2 be funny just more relatable
---
I don't think I've ever actually seen the pig in the leather jacket skin
---
Nobody abuses baby Dwights! We love them
---
I facecamp teabaggers and be friendly with everyone else
---
Im using DS adrenaline dead hard and borrowed time should i switch smth for spine chill?
---
Another reason for them to get fixed XDSeriously, I've experienced matches where I miss Survivors (even though the axe went through their head) or hit Survivors (even though they're ducked behind a crate or hidden around a corner).
---
Are hit-boxes seriously this hard to code?
---
What rank are you? I'm assuming purple rank. Then you are right alot of spirits run prayer beads. I guess running a perk like spine chill would be ideal as it still works even while phasing
---
Mooscle Myers
---
I mean, technically it falls under the category of oversaturated content. A lot of stuff on this reddit does since it’s just the same stuff over and over again.
---
Well it is if the killer isn't a complete potato.
---
Perhaps
---
You picked the wrong **house** basement fool
---
u/chattywindow works wonders!
---
Cause you're weak /s
---
&gt; Clear lie and/or you haven't played at all for the past half year
---
lmaoooo. Just because something hasn't happened to me doesn't mean it's a lie. I have not experienced a single infinite loading screen in 1.5 years and that is fact, because I know what I have experienced in the game.
---
&gt; I haven't played in 2016
---
Exactly. So you shouldn't be saying 'not to the extent they existed from dec 2018 to june 2019' because you haven't experienced 2016.
---
I never said your pc or connected was trash. But to that point, people have different pcs and different specs, and the game might react differently to those specs.
---
I'm done arguing with you because I can't be bothered writing phat paragraphs every response.
---
Lmao
---
There's been times when a hatchet that 100% should have hit me has missed, and times where it shouldn't have hit when it has.
---
I have no idea what the hotboxes look like, but it's a bit ludicrous.
---
yeah killermains are the biggest dumbfucks on the planet
---
You were literally saying it doesn’t need anything extra and to just buff weak perks instead? Lmao the problem with WGLF in concept is that it encourages excessively (and needlessly) risky play (at least, that’s how a majority of people using it play). It hinders MOST survivor matches when people use it because it “encourages Altruism,” when it’s really just encouraging getting an unhook as fast as possible so you can get your stack (oftentimes this means the person using WGLF isn’t actually doing gens or anything, but just following someone being chased). BBQ gives an extremely powerful additional power (on top of giving a lot of bloodpoints, and it rightfully should give a strong power) and the perk is useful even after you get your 4 stacks. WGLF is (if you’re not playing like an asshole) difficult to get your 4 stacks in a way that doesn’t devastate survivor gameplay, and it doesn’t even give any bonus power (which, since it’s the only other perk like BBQ, there’s no reason it shouldn’t). No ones saying it has to be an incredibly overpowered extra power, but it should be something, at least.
---
I get hate for playing hillbilly when I just want my dailies lmao
---
Haha, well if you was close enough the first time and got tunneled, you didn't have a chance to show that you aren't actually a threat. Of course it's not true every time, flashlight saves are rare, and because they're rare, killer feel threatened knowing you can pull this off. Paranoia is getting even worse if you follow the killer and resist shooing away. Still, never a good idea to chase after a guy with flashlight right off the bat, maybe he isn't actually a good saver :)
---
Men only want one thing and it’s fucking disgusting
---
On the contrary
---
Do you need to talk about it? We are here for you, just say how they hurt you.

---
I wanted Freddy, couldn't give less of a shit about Quentin or his shit tier perks.
---
Oh really?  I'm sorry 😅 i didnt know that well... sad....  :/

Scary moment
---
You talking about this?

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8uyTWFUNdxc

Demeaning others for calling you out is close enough for me, imma stop wasting my time with this though. gl doing whatever the hell it is people like you do.
---
I would assume that it takes longer to close a portal than to move between them. 
---
Then you simply don't allow the demogorgon to move to a portal that would close before he gets there.
---
Around 25 seconds he waits to vault and can see the wraith double back giving him a huge head start to running back around. This is something console survivors have to just guess.
---
BUT SHE DOES HAVE A LIMIT
---
"I'd be fine with WGLF stacks being easier to get" - Direct quote from my very first comment, if you're interested. 
---
And if WGLF had more ways to gain stacks such as full heals and other altruistic acts, it would encourage reckless unhooking a lot less. The perk getting a buff elsewhere however,  giving it some other passive bonus, most likely would not unless it's intended to be a pseudo-Borrowed Time.
---
Survivors get 16 perks. Killers get 4. There's a reason it's more acceptable for a single survivor perk to be devoted to bloodpoints alone than having the same deal for 25% of the killer's perk slots.
---
I really wish it worked with chainsaws...  as a billy main I cri
---
People expect to get tunneled with using a flashlight. The meme should be Shock when not tunneled.
---
Tbh it’s hell. Framerate Drops, 360s and lack of aim/mouse make it infuriating to learn and play her.

But once I got my boi shadowborne and some practice, she’s a blast.

I got 2000 in 3 days for bbq and another 2000 for ruin currently I'm at 600. Just play the game. I grinded so much and I was able to do it.
---
He can't keep getting away with this
---
Can't really say he's 'underrated', more 'unknown' as he's fairly new with DBD content compared to all the regular DBD Youtubers we've been watching for years.
---
That said, he's awesome, now only if he could get his schedule together and upload regularly. 👍🏼
---
This one time I was downed and dying. Someone powered the gates and I got healed. I ran straight to the exit and escaped.
---
Yea you would think. But I kinda made this meme because I played a game with a toxic survivor and  he got mad at me for tunneling.
---
I once got cussed out by a killer in the end game chat because he thought I brought a flashlight in. I brought a toolbox and found a toolbox that I took with me out the exit. My friend did bring a flashlight though and I am guessing he thought I was him even though I was meg and my friend was Dwight.
---
\-Wah's seductively-
---
Hahahaha lmao I can genuinely say he is my favorite youtuber and I can see that. I guess people dont know much about him cause if you search dbd you get twitch highlights and some noob3 videos
---
You know it's bad when even the actor of Quentin tweeted for this change to happen. 
---
BHVR pls
---
I’m on ps4. I main doc with iri king. One time, when I was in the basement, I saw a survivor red light through the ceiling, and I *think* I was able to find him after that.
---
I mean Quentin is pretty ugly but let's not turn him into a f\*\*\*ot
---
Ahhh yes a great way to kill survivors going for exit gates
---
Yikes. Yea some killers are toxic and it runs the game. That's kinda funny tho. I hope he realized his mistake and ended up feeling dumb
---
do you have the original template?
---
PLAY HOWEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PLAY - HODGETWINS (quote modified for dbd subreddit)
---
No cool down premonition would be too OP. Spine chill is fine because the survivor has no input to its use, and if killers suspect spine chill they can walk sideways to avoid it. No cool down premonition can be used to always know where the killer is, which is even worse when dealing with SWF
---
I’ll try uninstalling and then reinstall the game?
---
Xbox One also
---
Yea. I'll admit I get mad too but as a rule of thumb for me is if I haven't hit this guy in about 30 seconds move on. I probably wont hit them. I'm not that high rank myself. I went from 11 to 8 tonight and that's where I stopped so I'm good here.
---
I think that in order to get the most out of the game and not be too salty about it, you have to play both the killer and survivor regardless of your skill level at them. Then you can understand how survivors juke, and how the killers hit.
---
Ya need Jesus
---
Ah man you missed it in shrine, was just took of Wednesday but yeah you get it auto with leatherface aka The cannibal. Becomes a teachable perk at level 40.
---
I’ve changed it to 110% when you have no blinks charged, 105% when you have 1 blink charged and 100% when you have 2+ blinks charged.
---
*angry 𝘞𝘢𝘢𝘢 sounds*

It's not today.

Sad that BL3 will be out before the DLC is. Oh well. Maybe i'll get back on DBD eventually
---
I’ve tried my network connection, Nat type, etc. I’m running around 220mb/s, nat type open
---
Add me if you want, same GT as Reddit name, I'll fill a slot if you're looking to play
---
Well it’s also a variation, as object is 72 meters and allows them to chase you cause they know where you are but premonition is a warning cause it’s basically the killers terror radius, having spine chill, buffed premonition, and object of obsession, that would be a real fucking nuisance.
---
Kramer isn't necessarily pure evil like Micheal is though. While what he does is certainly evil, you can understand *why* he does it and to some people, you might even think they deserve it.
---
If you don’t understand why the “survivors have 16 perks, killers have 4” argument is dumb, no one here can help you 🤡
---
Yep. I play as rank 8 killer and still go on my rank 13 survivor. I learned how to run loops better as both a killer and a survivor
---
If this community now would know what rtx actually does. It's not THAT. Plebs
---
He’d kill them in the lobby screen
---
Hahahaha Idk why they made sound like that lmao
---
Doesn't make sense. Survivors already lose collision when they get hit
---
As a spirit main I like to think of it as waluigi lol
---
also how do I juke her when she can collide with you while phasing?
---
Oh I'm willing to listen, unfortunately you do very little to even try to bring me to your side and unfortunately a petty clown emoji will only do the opposite.
---
Who is Scotts? And no this is my opinion
---
Facts
---
It seemed to go weird after I bought Leatherface yesterday, it seems like in my install list, Myers and Ghostface wasn’t there anymore. I’ve uninstalled it all and now reinstalling it hopefully this will fix it
---
I just started playing DbD after watching streams and videos for a while, and in my first game I faced a hillbilly with 4 purple perks and the mori addon and he was rank 20... kind of off putting
---
Same hahahaha. When I first heard her that was my first thought
---
Premonition is an Auraless Object of Obsession with a Timer. The problem with buffing niche perks is they’re usually a short step from being an OP variant of something else or just flat out busted.
---
Yes I also run BT and try to take a hit to make sure they do get away also.
---
O fore sure. Me and my friends went up against a bubba who mid chase stopped and went and just stood with his face in a corner. It was one of the strangest things. We kinda felt bad because it seemed like he was crying in the corner. He turned around and was just looking at us. I even went and put my tool box at his feet. In the game chat we noticed he was a twitch streamer. I even went to his twitch to say good game until I watched him reporting us for unsportsman behaviour because we were better than him. He legit said to someone in his chat These guys are better than me and just ran circles around me as he was reporting us.
---
It should light up when you are looking in the killer’s direction.
---
Genuinely curious, are you blocking all 15+ people posting the Quentin rework picture? Because reposts are far more annoying to me than a person saying “X hasn’t been fixed yet” (though I agree with you that it’s also annoying and redundant)
---
girl: we had chemistry!
---
mom: you’re out of the house...
---
NO BUT BECAUSE OF THE ICON YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN THEY'RE IN A CHASE, THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE MEANT
---
It says whenever survivor is put into dying state, so grabs should work, because their icon changes to dying state when they're getting grabbed. But I don't really put my hop on it.
---
I do get mad only if the killer face camps for legit no reason. or if my teammate DC's instantly or as im unhooking them.
---
When I collide with someone I dont immediately slash like some machine. I have to take time to process it they will usually end up right behind me. I was playing against a guy that as soon as he hit me he 360 in the opposite direction while I swung where I predicted they were and missed. Too play it safe tho maybe use deadhard.
---
I got called a tunneling camper for playing hag... With a cross-map MYC build... TIL actively avoiding the unhooked is tunneling. At least the Bill said "Whoa, a good hag player that doesn't tunnel gg". I love how Bills usually aren't toxic.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
(&gt;°-°)&gt;
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
And just in case to make the wording clear, it's when the killer is facing towards your location even if he can't see you. So just to clear it up if Spine Chill lights up you're still safe unless it's an open field.
---
Maybe combination...
---
LMFAO hahaha that's too good. Salty twitch streamers are the best
---
me, in a full lobby readied up with doctor: hmm i think i wanna play hag now
---
Pop+Surge+Surveillance+Ruin or Bbq. oh yes oh baby oh yes oh yes oh oh baby oh yes
---
Ah permanently activate. Didnt see that in the above comment. Yes I agree. Or at least the timer stops when on the ground. Permanent activation for a 1 time use perk would make me want to use it and I agree that if they did this the stun would need to be shorter and I love the added effect. Go apply and make it an great perk again
---
A guess she took an L. I'll see myself out
---
Oh for sure, it might be the rights holders blocking it in some way. Maybe there's a clause between the right-holders and the actor stipulating that his likeness would ONLY be used for certain promotional material, and anything more they would themselves have to pay for, which they don't want to do. But even then they could just pass that cost on to BHVR: "We sell you the licence to use the actor, but you have to pay us to pay the actor".
---
Sounds like the actor is up for it, and would probably accept a waiving of any extortionate fees, and just ask for some sort of remuneration for it which could easily be paid by BHVR.
---
You would have thought they would have reopened the dialogue around the time of rebooting Freddy, to be able to present a more enticing DLC package. Maybe they were waiting to see if the Freddy rework actually enticed people to buy Freddy, and now that it has, they'll go back to the film owners and renegotiate it. I suppose it's not worth the hassle if nobody buys the DLC anyway.
---
WATERMARK =/= OP'S NAME
---
Really any combination of the top meta perks:
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable. 
---
With special mention to Iron Will, Spine Chill, Hope, and We'll Make It.
---
I ise leather jacket and the normal shirt mask  and default blade cuz the other one give me a headache
---
Brave man
---
I’ve noticed it taking a lot longer to find a game the last few days
---
Lol nerd.
---
I will twitch my arms slightly if no one is going for me
---
Sounds OP. That’s essentially just “reveal the Killer’s aura every X seconds.” 
---
The range limit is pretty trivial.
---
Had this same shot happen on pc. Legit  stood facing ghostface as he stalked And I watched him completely the whole time facing him and he got the stalk on three of us. We legit  couldn’t get him out of stalk mode even when he he just stayed crouched in the open and did not move. He even said that this shit was broke.
---
Not really a prediction. It was pretty much known that it was going to be stranger things as soon as netflix made that post about working with behaviour, and mathieu cote made a rather cheeky response to it.
---
Definitely more games than not
---
Micheal 1 shot addon
---
Try stacking it on game boxes so air and flow under it
---
It makes you run faster than the killer for 5 seconds and instantly heals you a health state. I have escaped many games solely because of Adrenaline. 
---
I was kinda skeptical at first until I started using it. There’s definitely a reason everyone says it’s the best survivor perk in the game
---
actually not at all a killer main? but try again. And you still very much can evade freddy, you just need to not loop the same object 2-6 times, as some survivors are too reliant on.
---
then its a one sided object of obsession?
---
That's a brofist
---
Wow this is actually the best fan made survivor I’ve ever read, although I’m not a fan of the clone perk but other than that great job 👍
---
nah, just pointing out a genuinely awful person, whos had his post taken down, and recieved a warning to change his flair.
---
I completely agree
---
Happened to me once, but I was stuck with the game telling me where I was
---
Want to try that again? Because it was a grammatical trainwreck
---
I’m a survivor main and those flashlight clicks are rude af.  I swear some people forget that there are gamers that have epilepsy and dead by daylight is one of the very few remaining games that doesn’t have bright flashing lights in it and is generally dark until you get some asshole spamming a light in their face when it’s not what it’s intended for.
---
There are teachable perks that arent DLC, but you still have to unlock them by leveling up their bloodwebs.
---
ok nerd
---
The Pig x Legion? The... Pigeon?
---
Except it only works for 3 seconds with a long cooldown. Sooo no not at all.
---
I hate toxic nas who always use the torch
---
i mean if you are saying console doesnt have hacks then you are wrong, about a week ago i had a guy with seemingly unlimited sprint burst, just straight up left
---
Nurse isn’t broken but ok
---
Or just camp them because you want to.
---
Not really lol you have to be fairly close. It's not like OoO with 70m range. Idk doesn't feel OP to me
---
This. Sometimes I swap out DS for We’ll Make It
---
Ok so I have a question.
---
It's it okay for me as a killer to say gg after getting a 4 man? It feels like I'm just rubbinh it in their faces.
---
the Noed complaints always confuse me, and a dev recently mirrored my reasoning for that. Adrenaline, and Noed are practically the same perk. Adrenaline rewards survivors for doing gens, and noed punishes them for not doing totems. Adrenaline, by itself, is stronger than noed, but it also happens to be directly countered by noed, which I'm pretty sure is where many of these complaints are actually coming from.
---
Happened to me multiple times on PS4, super sucks.
---
I have the same problem while starting the game. I have a PS4 Pro and dbd is the only game causing this. It sound like a jet engine starting in my room. Well, when I start a game it stops.. weird
---
Pointing isn't even a dickish gesture, I'm not even sure what it means. t-baggers are douche noodles but I only camp people who t-bag excessively or t-bag AND flashlight click for no good reason.
---
thank you so much means a lot  :)
---
Pictures you can hear
---
But dead hard was fixed
---
Headphones have a pretty huge impact on the game.
---
Hearing the direction of grunts of pain, breathing, footsteps, killer specific noises, etc. can make a huge difference.
---
I really don't understand how some people can play this game without headphones, even as survivor I think they are a must have.
---
Wow I was gone for 8 hours why could someone be gone for that long hmmm....
---
What?
---
I dont run ds for that same reason. Plus I usually get tunneled to all hell for looping them for 2 or 3 gens.
---
Yo he's fuckin' great and we both know that.
---
Thanks, added you on steam
---
What movie
---
Decisive Brofist*
---
we actually dont know that. Peanits has stated that theres some form of internal issue, and that the PTB will come when thats solved. so it literally could be today for all we know.
---
 Shut up Meg
---
Omg an intellegent poster. 
---
I got downvoted to shit yesterday for trashing all the baby killers defending Franklins in meme post.
---
Yep. His animations are too good😂😂
---
I have deer stalker and nurses on my build so it's super easy to slug and when I do pick them up I have agitation and mad grit and when you have people try to body block and flashlight save getting super close slugging us easy
---
I don't have a lot of to complain about killer outfits, it's mostly the survivor ones I loathe. A lot of the killer outfits do not make sense, but at least there's actual effort put into most of them. Survivor wise you're looking at the cheapest shit imaginable. Just slap some shitty clothes on them, ten dollas plis.
---
Wholeheartedly agree but I sometimes miss rank resets and am more of a survivor main than killer so I'll be like rank 16 or 17 when I'm playing killer and quickly have to climb it just feels bad
---
I don't mind it when daddy hooks me
---
You do realise that it was actually you that started "demeaning" first right? But sure man, you're totally the innocent victim here who chose to come into a thread and start rudely policing.

I'll believe it when it actually happens
---
BACK DEMON
---
by the time you charge your power and you hook 1 guy, 3/4 gens will be done and I'm not exaggerating
---
Immersion is great, just make sure not to over do it. If your team mates are all on death hook and you've been hiding/doing gens all game you need to recognize when its your turn to gets saves and kite the killer.
---
&gt;lmaoooo. Just because something hasn't happened to me doesn't mean it's a lie. I have not experienced a single infinite loading screen in 1.5 years and that is fact, because I know what I have experienced in the game.

As I said you're lying then. EVERYONE complained about infinite loading screens earlier this year and EVERYONE as in EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT PLAYED THIS VIDEO GAME had to deal with them. Even if your own game, for God's sake, never EVER shit itself you must've been in dozens of games that A. never started because the host himself crashed too or B teammates were missing after long ass loading screens. Get the fuck outta here with your autism.
---
&gt;I'm done arguing with you because I can't be bothered writing phat paragraphs every response.
---
Oh boohoo, isn't BHVR paying you anymore for making positive posts?
---
well, well, well, if it isn’t the same meme posted for the 100th time on this subreddit.
---
Gg stands for Good Game, it doesn't matter if you killed or not, a game will be good when both sides had: a challenge and fun, you are here to have fun, not to kill/escape, so if the match was a 4 man fair, than it's a gg, if was a match with 4 brand new part + prove thyself, than it wasn't a gg,same way around, if it was a fair killer, than it was a gg, if it was a tunneler + mori + noed + BM, than it wasn't a gg

A SWF team of a low purple and red loading in with their yellow friend deserve whatever they get. They have no intention to enjoy the game and are only out to bully a weaker player.

Is this from Happy! ?

I’m just a plunderer and I get tunneled. It’s rough out here for us plunders :(
---
Looks like CJ.
---
Haha how the turntables
---
Because they are supposed to get insta downs... It's part of their base kit.
---
Huntress using iridescent heads and trapping people defeats the purpose of playing huntress. Hence why this (no hit bubble) for the Huntress exists.
---
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity 😍
---
Where was that mentioned
---
*pat pat*
---
Just use calm spirit,dead hard, self care and spine chill :))))
---
Haha it be like that. *sad flashlight noises*
---
I pretty much get into arguments about how I think DS isnt a good perk bc there are so any hurdles and if I put it on I get to use it maybe 2 times in 10 games. For starts you HAVE to get tunneled. Also be bad at chases and go down before the timer runs out( In my experience the timer nearly always runs out before I am downed) then you have to hope the killer actually picks you up in which case I usually have less than 10 seconds left on the timer so they need to do it fast. I think it really needs work. At this point for me it is a B or C tier perk and everyone gets mad when I express that I don't think it's that good. It's great in the end game I will admit but yeah.
---
In the stream they specifically said no chainsaws.
---
I got a bunch of people really pissed last night for using corrupt purge to down three of them around a gen
---
Ive been having a problem of not wanting to level any of my 40+ characters due to coming changes,as a result, im basically out of addons on my main killers. But that did make me give the hag another try, and thanks to some videos, I have a handle on her and I've been loving her. She is so hecking strong when played right, even with yellow/brown addons.
---
My idea is pretty much a middle ground, I think
---
Can high rank (I mean like low number rank, do you say high or low??) killers be matched with new players? The other day I was playing as a rank 15 killer and was match made with a rank 6 survivor (he was playing with a friend around rank 15).
---
I just want the radius to be a bit farther, that's all. I use it a lot more, but it really needs like, 5 or 10 more meters added, because sometimes the fucking killer closed in hella fast and sometimes get found faster than the notification triggers.
---
I tried to give one to a guy, but he preferred to escape through the hatch after first (out of two) gens. Shame. I guess it's oppressive to think that killer can change his mind in any moment.
---
It’s not a bug buddy. How are you this brain dead? Try playing rank 1 survivor with ultra settings. The red light is impossible to see.
---
Sometimes! BT guarantees that my teammate will get away, and after the killer realizes that they have it they usually turn around and down me instead. Then I just have wait until I get unhooked, then I have DS and DH to extend the chase.
---
Ded meme 😬
---
Its not a hack. Its a known bug. I believe it has something to do with urban invasion and sprinting while crouched or some shit
---
Wow the subreddit is just as toxic as the gamen
---
Dead Hard is espcially good on Nurse because she has the extra cool down after a blink swing.
---
Iron Will helps create distance if you can break line of sight.
---
Spine Chill gives you an early warning to start running when shes headed your way. 
---
Spread out and do gens. When in a chase break line of sight and create distance whenever possible. Weak nurses can be mindgamed and baited into blinking incorrectly.
---
I do too
---
Nope even after reinstall still taking ages, ended up turning it off without even playing a game 😔
---
Waving arms on hook as a signal to come unhook makes NO sense as the killer would see it and know exactly when to go back to hook to collect more victims.
---
Maybe you had this addon where the survivor needs to be closer to reveal you.

I don't know if it would had been funnier with Hag or not. Can someone do quick edit?
---
This is a true gem
---
So did I. A few days ago I decided to play some Killer after two weeks of Survivor. Played as Ghostface on Ormond, had a fairly poor game with one kill, and the person I killed went off in my messages because I broke chase to down and kill her instead. People will complain about anything
---
Me waiting for the inevitable hate comments. “FIlthY lEgIOn maIIIiIIn!1!1!1”
---
When it does come to licensed Killers, they're nice to have but a lot of them are just kinda ok to bad. I think they now need to calm down on it and start coming up with new ideas. It doesn't hurt to ask the community for ideas and I honestly think Bhvr should.
---
Michael is just alright. He's got Evil Within and a couple meme builds but his most deadly combination gets him Entity Displeased.
---
Freddy accelerated to high mid tier with a single update and I do love that. I've never personally played him though and I don't come up against many either as Survivor.
---
Leatherface is just fucking garbage. He's a failed clone of the Hillbilly. I think he kinda needs a rework as well to make him actually different and as good as or better than the Hillbilly.
---
The Pig could also be better. I left text on my profile stating a rework that'll honor the movies more. You can check it out if you want.
---
Ghostface is nice. His ability is a pocket Myers. The rate he can stalk people is astonishing and because he can crouch, he can have a lower profile than Myers when he stalks. Of course if they didn't change him from the PTB, he would've replace Freddy for worst killer.
---
Pretty sure that was a hyperbole
---
Playing as killer (dailies) made me a better survivor. I see what’s the most difficult to combat when playing and then practice that as Survivor.
---
Looks like Money Heist(?) Series on Netflix.
---
I'm pretty sure the killer can't see the survivor's aura on the hook
---
FPS = what's that lol?
---
If you don’t get that even 16 survivor perks are not nearly as strong as 4 killer perks (they shouldn’t be, but that doesn’t excuse 90% of survivor perks being useless).... and if you’re genuinely offended by an emoji.... I’m so sorry for you : (
---
but why? They wouldn't exactly make any money since anyone who would buy the ANOES Chapter has already done so. It'd be paying for likeness for the sake of doing it.
---
Say goodbye to any casual games!
---
The different tiers of Self-Care do not change the healing speed, they all allow you to heal yourself at 50% of the regular speed (32 seconds).  The difference between the tiers is the increased medkit efficiency from 10/15/20%.
---
I mean he could pick it up and place it down again, but walking into it looks much more effiecient
---
*angry ~~waaa sounds~~ Hank Hill ASMR*
---
😂😂
---
I just had addons for NS recovery speed, I was hid behind a rock just crouching up for a second then back down, i tried explaining that it isn’t like a meter you fill up to reveal, as soon as you break sight it refreshes people still getting used to it at higher ranks
---
Spine chill doesn't tell you where the killer is coming from though
---
he tries too hard to be funny its unbearable for me to watch him sorry

Gotcha

Well its really good, gives you instaheals sprint burst and ignores exhaustion, with the no heal meta It also makes survivors Focus more on gens to get the heal and causes a bit more gen rushing, but imo its not op unless everyone is injured and get healed after last gen pops (which doesnt happens often, be It cause some dont use It or theyre healty )

I was going to do the exact same thing! :-D

The moment I uploaded it I was confused why I didn’t put f

My cat acts just like that. “Aaannnnd THATS too many pets” *attacks*

I'm confused. Has/is that perk getting buffed. I  believe it offered and regression
---
This would be awesome!
---
He wants to know if you can miss the skill check for overcharge and deadhard through it.
---
Actually I play killer unless my friends inv me to play survivor, and I never catch hate messages post game even when I kill all 4. The killers that pretend survivors are op and toxic and message every game regardless of how you played killer are just full of shit. Ive never gotten trashed for playing like an asshole,  and on those games where they all work together and some get away Ive never got messages about how bad I am. I don't believe any survivor does that. Everybody can rank up if all 5 people play correctly then its all a good time and nobody is getting screwed over.  Unfortunately 90 percent of the killers now lately are just ignorant trolls and dont care what they have to do to kill. Intentionally camping their ass off, trying to focus 1 person and intentionally derank them its just shitty and makes those survivors get shitty. 
---
I want to point out that no survivor has ever disconnected from my match regardless of how long it goes or how many gens are left or people are dead. When you play with skill and the intent to make everyone enjoy the game win or lose its good for all involved they don't want to leave. Especially knowing the next killer they're gonna face is probably a face camping asshole. (Not to mention another of literally thousands of ghost faces lately...but that's beside the point even if he a cheese lord)

Because the killer needs stronger perks it’s 4v1 if it was just bp it wouldn’t be used nearly as much
---
Guess who can tell where the killer actually is more often?  I've spectated people who use Spine Chill, and I wouldn't give up Premo for it.  Spine Chill is being able to tell when someone is looking at you, without knowing where they are.  Premo is like being in the dark and seeing the killer anyway.  So one is a possible-danger notification, the other is a directional GPS.
---
Recently instead of actually playing (is getting bored) I decided to play ghost face but not conventional.. at first I had to only teabag chase them. About were very confused until I become ghost face survivor xD id bring in like a cake or some shit just so I can help em farm bloodpoints ya know? Relax and get a decent non toxic game in lol
---
Using dead hard while in the animation after you've exploded a gen, does dead hard animation go normally through or does the gen explosion animation interfere with it. Not sure if this is anywhere near understandable but I tried doing words.

I'm quite sure you'll slide during the missed skillcheck animation

The most funny animation combo I saw was when you touched an overcharged gen and quickly started healing someone. after failing a skillcheck, you used to get into the repain animation while healing your mate
---
This, sadly, got patched out
---
No it wouldn’t. We’ll make it would still do gameplay wise the same thing.
---
*Trapper laughing in a distance*

Ok hiding the name still makes the post witch-hunting/player shaming we get it a streamer pissed you off, and you stating his name in comments is gaming the system

Oh god no ! i prefer the tired Quen ;(

the other one did so much PS. LOVE YOURSELF QUEN YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK LIKE A PLASTIC BAG T\_\_\_T
---
That doesn’t mean much. All because you assumed right this time doesn’t mean that it could’ve easily been wrong.
---
That’s the difference between an inference and assumption. One is an educated guess, the other is shooting wild. You should know already that 1. Bad matchmaking, and 2. Bad rank system, mean that visible skill means nothing.
---
You said you tunnel these people? It’s not that tunneling is always bad, but that it’s stupid to change your play style, which in context you frame as a punishment, for something they may not of done. You said you do this as a principle, and it’s with that, that I can INFER you’ve done it to innocent people if you’ve played a decent amount.

watch him every time a new video comes out

Yeah trues a fucktard
---
So a huntress couldn't instakill with an instakill add-on.... Like yea myers shouldn't instakill if he bodyblocks you with tier three....
---
Ah yes, I forgot thrill of the hunt slows down all totem cleansing. I really only think of that perk for the notifs
---
The first perk is already kind of a thing. The chase music doesn't start if you are standing still
---
Defend her all you want but I'll face a nurse every time over spirit. Don't think anyone will ever change their opinion on spirit. I will say I can easily find out if a nurse is talented or not but have yet to see a difference between green,purple or red rank spirits minus face camping or tunneling. Please don't write back trying to discuss camp or tunnel.

Yeah because that's the only time it can activate

Infectious fright

Myers was released on the PC version on October 25, 2016 and the perk system wasn't reduced to just 3 rarities until Patch 1.5.0 on May 31, 2017.

Are you getting confused because Myers wasn't released until later on consoles?
---
Probably can’t edit because of licensing issues

Flash light saves are cool, but repetitive coordinated SWF saves is annoying and probably toxic. That's when I start my slug farm.

Can't flash light save a slug.

For me balanced would be hillbilly. He is great as is. I never voted for a nurse nerf. And as far as i can tell nurse isnt getting nerfed just her addons reworked. And BALANCE MEANS AT BASE not with addons.
---
Next: Spirit is unfun to Play against because she is invisible and a decent spirit will pinpoint you about 80% of the time. Also some of her random phasing + vaulting is really weird and looks like shes teleporting through the Window.
---
Also i never said op. I said unfun to Play against. And fun is subjective. I Think that i enjoy my time in dbd versing every Killer more than vs. Spirit
---
Laurie doesn't look bad just different although her hair should be updated. Quentin is still a crackhead tho.

Nah dude fuck tru3 but witch-hunting isn’t civil in the slightest.

that's what i'm fucking talking about, i didn't think they'd do it

thank you team !!!!

Cause it's not as good, and it's expensive as hell. The weapon is dope though
---
I disagree. RTX off has the incredibly manly chad-jaw. RTX on has the nu-male soyboy jaw.
---
Oh true that would be a good idea 😄
---
? Am i not allowed to say i have no fun vs. Spirit?
---
Meh i just want bond from him the rest of the perks can go step on a rusty lego
---
It probably also depends on how on board they are and current funds. Especially considering I'd assume they still pay for likeness/license rights for other things too like the killers. I wish I had more of an answer for ya :/
---
Killer's instinct works that way right now sweetie

God this is goooooooorgeous

Biggest? Not sure if serious. 
---
Hint: look for non-English streams and outside of EU prime time.
---
Skillchecks are easier to hit with unnerving presence
---
Agitation lets you outspeed them, sand avoid blocks. This comes at the cost of that if no one tries to block, you make it 2 or so meters less than iron grasp without blocks.
---
But even if they don’t block you waste way less time carrying
---
Does pig sneak around without radius?
---
No, but it blocks them so survivors can't stop the added regression from Surge.
---
I think of it as red light / green light haha
---
I flashlight saved 6 times once and the killer said i hope you die from cancer :(
---
oh god no
---
i know there is a human under there but it still looks like some fury shit, nope

Waving = red light

Being still = green light

Clipping is one of the biggest issues with some of the skins.

Whenever you put a Survivor into the dying state *with your basic attack.*

I have not been able to successfully save a teammate with a palette yet. nice play there.

I vastly prefer Premonition. Tried using Spine Chill but it felt horrible to use. Each to their own but Premonition feels far more useful to me

I couldn’t mentally handle this. I’d feel compelled to get their visual level to max and never stop grinding

Yiks!!! no please he have a weird bun plate face

I EVEN RUN KINDRED AND STILL DIE ON FIRST HOOK.
---
I have 2 level 50+ P3 Survivors without Urban Evasion or Sprint Burst and I get blood webs with NO perks in them every other blood webs on them. Makes no sense. Another, different P3 Survivor only has a level one perk and I can’t get the higher ones to show up, ever.
---
No.Nonono.no. In this instance i only tunneled the one guy. Which was a rank 2(how he got there is beyond me but he put the hours in so if hes rank 2 than he should be good at the game right?) (You have 1 thousand hours and is rank 17. By that logic imagine this kid at rank 2). if you read the rest of the discussion I post a play by play of what was happening. In the game. It went a little something like this. Guy runs up to me and flashlight clicks. I chase but quickly find out he is better so I go do something else. He saves friend from hook and i go back to hook to find him there teabagging and light clicking. I chase him hook him. His friend saves. They heal next to hook. I hear grunts. I attack flashlight guy(which happens to be rank 2) and hook again. J dont want to fully tunnel and kill knowing its last hook. He body block me later while carrying friend. I'm not going to let him sit there so I slash. He goes down. I hook him and friend. He messages. I proceed to win.
---
It's a global heal that can be timed.
---
Say one is hooked, two injured, you wait to pop the last gen for right when the person gets unhooked and bam now everyone is fully healed.
---
Tyler1 is a piece of shit, though
---
I did, then I hit 1 million so I spent it all, now I'm saving again lol
---
Oh god oh fuck!
---
I clicked on it and I highly regret it.
---
SUMMON THE PTB
---
i guess i'm the only meg who when she fucks up the gen still stays on it lol
---
come at me killers, let's loop
---
Is it weird, that I prefer premonition over spinechill?
---
Even if the system tries to detect that one could easily change the values a tiny bit between key presses. I know my razer synapse let's me edit values for the seconds.
---
I suggest the DBD official forums, they don't allow me to make accounts there.
---
Ah the killer rulebook for survivors
---
Is it that good? How often it usually proc in one game? I'm a baby nurse
---
ur right

makes getting mindgamed impossible as you know where the killer is constantly

The mansion would be pretty good as a map if BHVR could swing the rights to it, too

That's why addons increase the length of frenzy

HOW DARE YOU ITS GOOD ON NURSE AND BIG TERROR RADUIS DOCTOR OR MYERS PLUS ITS GOOD FOR STEALTH DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDER HOW DARE YOU IM SO GODDAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRN OFFENDED OH NO BIG SAD
---
Nothing will happen to him, but nobody cares about your rant against a streamer because you weren’t civil and what your doing makes you no better then him.
---
Lets hope. Im still sceptical considering Morf, a Fog Whisperer, said there would be no PTB this week on his stream yesterday.
---
Is that really the case though? If so, what's the incentive to rework Freddy at all? A lot of people IIRC were put off by seeing that Freddy didn't work properly, but bought him when he was reworked to be strong. A lot of people might want to buy the DLC, but don't bother because the survivor is ugly (and they only play survivor so Freddy himself isn't much of a draw).
---
Survivors are essentially just skins anyway and people spend lots of real currency on skins. I could easily see a lot of people at least buying auric shards for Quentin if he gets improved and they think he's cute.
---
Bri I'm a killer main and I really don't care about flashlight tbh, if you have a little bit of experience you know how to bait and avoid them
---
Combine this with freddys power and you have got yourself a gameplan
---
really subpar perk, needs light reworking
---
This is just embarrassing.

MR TORGUE IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL I GOT ONE QUESTION AND ONE QUESTION ONLY EXPLOSIONS?

Devs said she has few counters and having to run a specific perk because of her isn't justified. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets nerfed in the Stranger Things update
---
I've got tons of photos of post chat that prove survivors are like this too. It's the community not the killers
---
WHY DONT PLAY KILLER WHERE YOU YOU GET THE TASTE OF WOOD
---
still with the best addons shows u survivors in the other side of the map, and if the survivors start to run, its impossible to you to catch them.  NOW, maps like coal tower or the game or lerys works really good.
---
Wait can you combine them? Like, hooking somebody, the down somebody else?
---
Not sure how long you've used the name, but mine began waaaaay back during the days of Perfect Dark on the 64.
---
Imagine getting this butthurt over somebody’s else’s opinion on a FUCKING VIDEO GAME
---
Not mad at all? Just harassment like you are currently doing, is never needed. And of course they dont allow you there, they are actually pretty strict on harassment and personal attacks, which is a really good thing.
---
I can stand it words dont hurt me. It's the fact that people say these things and think they're correct and bully new survivors and killers with them.
---
Think of it from killer perspective survivors have distortion which is pretty good I uses it on my survivor killers don’t have any such aura hiding ability y’all could hide in lockers as well even stealth killers aren’t hidden from auras(yet?)
---
I am
---
Ditch bbq and run sloppy  and you are good to go, you dont need noed
---
Tbf, they all go to the same gym
---
Hes talking of the ace main?
---
Distortion is terrible. That’s just bbq’s power restriction that adds additional lack of info. And think of it THIS way. Distortions hides a SINGLE player, killler aura perks reveal FOUR.
---
Oh okay. Also they made it so if you miss a knife the power deactivates whereas before you could spam that shit
---
And Jakes who hunt hooks for sport.
---
I think some of the cosmetics will benefit you over other ones a non-zero percentage of the time.  Though, even the darkest blendette can still be seen/hit just like normal so it's really on the killer.  I think going for more ensured strategies is more reliable.  Why risk giving away a free hit by crouching in a bush right beside the killer, when you could have been in a better position to begin with and have the ability to loop/deny the killer free value.  That being said, it costs you basically nothing to use the smallest/darkest survivor you possibly can since if necessary you can always fall back on that plan.  I don't think it's a very big advantage the vast majority of the time, or enough of one that it should stop people from playing whoever they like the most over feeling like they're at a disadvantage by not playing a blendette.  But even if it's not going to be relevant often, it would still be strictly better to try to use whatever makes you hardest to spot.  I'm aware I might be at a disadvantage for playing the big loud oaf handsome Jesus himself, Jeff, but that's percentage points I'll happily sacrifice.
---
For killers, I think Ghostface cosmetics that don't have those long streamers floating off to his sides are a little better for his stealth.  For the most part, I think it matters even less for killers since their appearance usually isn't the main giveaway of their presence.
---
**P**OP THE TRAPS WHEN SHE IS CARRYINGN A SURVIVOR TO A HOOK OR CROUCH AROUND EM WITH URBAN EVASION DUMBBUTT

Also... I though we were talking about WGLF?

I'll keep using macro until they rework the idiotic hook struggle system.
---
Alright bet!
---
Honestly despite how stupid those ppl are and how childish it is for them to say those things, that kind of talk is on all games, even games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat where the competitiveness is far greater. It's just natural sadly, and I'm kinda embarrassed to be part of a world where it's normal to see things like that tbh
---
Because people realized she's OP and now everyone and her mother plays her
---
YEAH I JUST CAME HERE BECAUSE THE MAGNETS FELL OF MY FRIDGE
---
I mean that sucks, but I don't understand why survivors can't leave when ready, and just say gg without all the bm.  Believe it or not it's so hard for many of them, especially at purple ranks I've noticed.
---
&gt;Spine Chill still requires you getting lucky and bringing a perk before you know the killer, which goes double because Spine Chill does not fall into the regular meta.
---
Peanits, Community Manager, BHVR
---
Fair enough maybe I’m biased but I just don’t think it needs a buff personally
---
Distortion of WGLF?
---
It doesn't have to, because it activates before the terro radius hits and gives you plenty of time to leave an area. That would make SC OP if it did, though it would be super rad. that being said, if my spine chill lights up and stays solid for 2 seconds, I'm gone. it's a general rule of thumb and has saved my ass more times than it hasn't.
---
Look behind you
---
Pallets are a resource
---
Know where to run at all times
---
WGLF
---
That would be a bit OP probably
---
Sensitivity 100. Don't use add-ons. Practice until your eyes bleed. Just this week I've gone from barely getting a few hits to reliably sacrificing 2-3. What console are you on? I know an amazing nurse on Xbox who regularly 4ks in red ranks. Dudes amazing
---
Well, i made a thread about it a long time ago, let me copy and paste it here quick.
---
Actually good one PogU
---
They just want to be toxic as fuck
---
Yeah I’m on xbox too.  I know a few amazing nurses on xbox at red ranks, there’s one that used to go perkless all the time and destroy within minutes lol
---
I dont mind going against hags that trap everywhere except the hook. I've faced a couple that do that and they sometimes win because they are good killers. I wish there were more being bongs boys and trappers.
---
Irrelevant with a good pair of headphones
---
This was my thread:

As of right now, protection is bugged, so only saves give tokens. There’s only 8 hook rescues in a match tops. That’s IF everyone actually gets hooked twice and isn’t camped. 16 tokens total... 8 unhooks IF YOU ARE VERY LUCKY. You compete for 6 unhooks while guaranteeing a loss. What if someone unhooks extra too? This perk is hot garbage.
---
BBQ is nearly better in every way when it comes to points (I’m not going to discuss it’s bonus effect, this post is about points I’m not about to start that argument, it’ll make us lose the point) Getting no BBQ due to a DC sucks, make DC’s give tokens to that. However if there is no DC’s you still otherwise almost always get 3 if not 4. Even if you don’t, or make a miss play with BBQ, it doesn’t literally cause you to throw the game away for penny pinching.
---
After it’s nerf, which kinda was needed, the 200% caused issues after all, WGLF has been very hard to get tokens for. Protection has always sucked, with the only guaranteed token being from a direct hook block. So usually that leaves unhooking but... that’s only 8/16 tokens.
---
However there’s been a change, it is now LITERALLY impossible this update to get all stacks unless you pallet or flashlight save, which is rare, and sure as hell not happening for 4 people, TWICE EACH! Protection no longer works even with hook blocks, which I’ll also mention destroyed MoM. MoM needed a nerf, however it’s no longer useable due to tokens simply being almost impossible to get due to protecting events not functioning.
---
Protection may have been only COMPLETELY broken for just this update, but it’s still been PARTIALLY broken for an ENTIRE YEAR! What gives!? Why is it so hard to make it work?
---
I suggest these following things as changes
---
Fix protection events. This is a given and it’s absurd it’s been left alone for a year, only to be made EVEN WORSE.
---
Make WGLF only require 2 tokens. 8 tokens for a whole team. 8 unhooks max, plus that other stuff on the side. Won’t cause the apocalypse with 200% points, as it’ll stay 100%, just easier to reach the 100%. If anyone says this is unbalanced, you make no sense, it’s only “buff” would be solo players running around like headless chickens slightly less. It has no real gameplay change. If you say it’d hurt the economy, then you admit getting 4 stacks was much harder to begin with.
---
Make BBQ get stacks from DC’s. You have the servers now. This should be possible. Please do it.
---
tbh i was kinda worried for a second. (i peaked rank 11, im not trying to be offensive here :D)
---
Bugs happen - DC is a unnintentional gameplay feature which caused that so until they present husks to US, we wont see an imporvement
---
Devious... I like it!
---
This could be as well be an ad for Head &amp; Shoulders
---
Oh well, if survivors and killers alike decided they didn’t need to spam people with their toxic nonsense outside of the game we wouldn’t have to do it.  
---
I’ll take an L any day to not have to sift through and report people’s nonsense over a game.
---
ANND HISSSSS NAAAAAME IS.............................JOHN CENA BUM BA DUM BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM
---
She got killed by a bug lmao
---
The licensers have to approve. If they were adding a Kyle character independent of the movie than the nightmare on elm street license wouldn’t matter. But since it’s specifically from his performance as Quentin in the movie, it falls under the license.
---
Breathtaking.
---
Before I knew who he actually was, I legitimately thought that Quintin was like a 50-60 year old stoner hippy dude.
---
Entity education can be pretty informative if you wanna look that up on youtube. Nurse in particular can be really tough to learn, so I do reccomend starting somewhere a bit more simple, especially as nurse is recieving changes in the near future.
---
Thanks :D
---
Lots of pictures like this where the killer still 3-4ks, you're even using a super meta build. Don't blame matchmaking for your loss

RecluseEnigma is a beast. He's the one who gave me pointers and encouragement to work on her. At rank 3 on survivor he has everyone slugged in 1, maybe 2 gens time. It's ridiculous. 
---
I've been having a rough time as nurse lately just do to crap matchmaking. Rank 12 killer and I'm getting red rank swf with their rank 15 buddy pretty often
---
I literally get my shit at the beginning of the game, discordance ruin. Let's me find them in the beginning quickly and they struggle to do genos. Bu the time ruin gone it's already to late perma 1 shot is active and ready to go.
---
Definitely don't start as nurse. Try trapper and trap at pallet locations would be good for a new player.
---
where did you even get this clip at
---
I believe it depends on the team. I've had decent games with no cleanses, then I've had disasters. If they're smart, they split the team and have the best looper on the Plag. Everyone else gets things done then GG. Not every game is like that, but I've been running into it a lot more. She just doesn't have the greatest pressure when she can't corrupt.
---
Lmao same. Those 1500 points are mine bitch
---
No this movie was awful please no
---
I don't even know Jake's meme identity. Hes just quiet all the time and disappears and somehow stuff happens.
---
Jake is responsible for everything that goes bump in the realm.
---
Sounds like him right now?
---
But do they stack?
---
No, Wraith is the best for brand new newbies. He’ll start bad habits as Trapper
---
wow that sucks. hopefully it gets fixed then, don’t want it happening again
---
Yep. Lithe or balances landing is so much better for most situations
---
Anyone else gonna run We'll Make It, Borrowed Time, and Babysitter?
---
Probably the same survivor lol. The same scenario happened for me
---
But where are the TappInclusiveTickleSockets® (tits for short)
---
*Loops me and flashlights me every pallet break*
---
**oh so you’ve chosen death?**
---
LMAO
---
Amazing detail! If you added color, it would essentially be an in game character portrait!
---
I’d suggest not playing nurse as your first killer. 
---
She’s a difficult one to learn. 
---
I’d start out playing Michael or Hillbilly. 
---
My best advice overall is too play survivor and killer. I used to only main survivor and then I started playing killer.
---
Seeing how I react to certain things as a killer helped me improve as a survivor and knowing how survivors reacted definitely benefited me when playing as a killer. 
---
If you wish to continue playing the nurse you’re going to have a hard time especially if you’re on console or using a controller, but the nurse is the best killer in the game once you’ve mastered her. 
---
Good luck and I hope you enjoy it. Just don’t take survivors and killers toxic bullshit to heart. 
---
I’ve stopped playing the game for about 4-5 months I think but I’m debating on playing it again as I really do miss the experience.
---
Maybe they tbagged because they new their game was glitched and they couldn't escape
---
Need more aussie players to fix it
---
Same bruh
---
*nervous wind noises*
---
Man, watching jojo's has really put reddit into a new context., yare yare daze.
---
Why wouldn't they?
---
Actually Myers loses collision during stalking, I guess it's for the same reason.
---
U're so kind bro. Now i will get Bond and stayaway from selfcare. But one last question, do u think Balance Landing is better than DH in distraction ?
---
Also the devs said they'd likely give us notice before the PTB.
---
This doesnt really show how good of a survivor you are but instead how bad a clown is as a killer rn
---
Thanks, I would but we were required to do it in black ink. (Warm up assignment for college)
---
Thats the joke
---
Hmmmm. They must've vanished like claudette.
---
I think it should increase your unhooking speed or altruistic actions
---
If the survivors are even moderately altruistic, then you can snowball real quick with IF procs. It's not as good at lower ranks because survivors are usually at opposite corners of the map, but at higher ranks it completely shuts down flashlight save plays or pallet stun saves.
---
The DC made this bug last a lot longer, but this happens very frequently. 
---
It happens when I try to grab from lockers, gens, and windows. I just freeze in the grabbing animation while the survivor can run away
---
I play on ps4 if it's not that then you get matched with players not your rank or around your rank i was playing freddy at rank 13 and i was getting rank 4s
---
He looks like fucking Bob Ross without the hair and beard.
---
That's a good point about the timer running out before you get downed; that happens to me a lot as well. I sometimes get around that by jumping into a locker in front of the killer. If they pull you out it forces DS to activate, but smart killers will just wait you out to avoid it.
---
It's far easier to get cornered by a killer with no tr and it would be really bs having to sit 20secs in a corner while myers just stands in front of you
---
No he should keep BBQ cuz he prob wants it for BP. But def drop NOED for Sloppy. Don’t count on losing your main objective, count on it not happening. He’s limiting himself with that
---
I can’t unsee it now
---
You are gonna get some hate for that noed, but anyway well done
---
"No, don't you see. You're supposed to accept that physical pain is an important game mechanic and be grateful to the developers that are too incompetent to average numbers together for 3 years. You should be grateful they're even willing to sell you gameplay affecting content instead of just banning you on the spot!" ~A surprising amount of the communitiy.
---
It’s great regardless! Keep up the good work!
---
Maybe premonition should show the killers aura for 2/3/4 seconds?
---
Kinda like how butthurt you are about my opinion about a FUCKING STREAMER? Lemme guess this is different somehow because herpderpherp. Next.
---
If you want even a chance to keep DHope up you need TotH. Bitter murmur is a terrible perk, go with Hex: Ruin
---
Knowing whether the killer is going towards you or not is more useful
---
They're gonna be camping a lot I guess lmao
---
Oh sorry... Instadown... You know very well what i meant by that. And how the fuck does the ranged part contribute to getting caught in a corner. If anything you should never get cornertrapped by huntress anyway
---
Yeah I think he plays some ace and uses dea 'ard alot.
---
This is karma roulette at its finest
---
TIL that not experiencing permanent nerve damage due to repetitive stress is bannable. Not surprising given how overwhelmingly scummy of a company they are and how people still support them despite that.
---
Ace Has the best cosmetic in the game - the Ace pilot

Its so 80-90s

Beautiful

And f2p

Same. I died multiple times on hook due to the stupid mechanic. Ever since I added the macro the game is much more enjoyable.

He’s from Germany what do you expect? Most of the toxic players I encounter on the game was from Germany

Hey my man, sorry for the late reply, I kinda had a rough week hope you are alright! But not trying be OMG SMARTASS, but I guess it's called, uh, "counterplay"? Which is hard because in this game most of the stuff is rng and you never know who you are facing the next time, but ... other killer aura reading perks and some powers also literally defeat the survivor purpose of playing any stealth as well, and if you do, won't last too long. 
---
I also play killer and I know OoO is annoying AF and you wanna tunnel down the survivor asap but I really enjoyed OoO when I played surv. I enjoy this perk now because now I have a better understanding of the game and I think this perk is very skill based. It sucks if you are a noob, but it's cool if you are advanced and you totally deserve the punishment if you get caught, after all, it's an *obsession* perk xD
---
Cool, though I hate seeing more survivor perks getting nerfs. Thank goodness I'm now 80% killer main now.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Wind up, back up and throw
---
I know and feel the pain since i am a killer too
---
But its bound too happen since its not an intended game mechanic

I used it to level wraith and huntress, who were the last two i needed to level, and now I'm leveling up jane. I dont actually care about prestiging myself, I dont really care about the bloody skins very much, and the "increased chance" of higher rarity stuff on the bloodweb has already been proven to be pretty much false at this point.
---
Me too.
---
Fingers crossed something like this happens. Not sure if its related but the licences have been so much better since Starbreeze was taken out of the equation. Since then we've had Ash with his likeness and original VA, Ghostface, and now Stranger Thing's with the character's likeness'. Not to mention Saw cosmetics. Here's hoping the other licences get revisited at some point
---
Point me to the person who abuses Baby Dwights and I will Clown mori them
---
When I first started playing killer, I mained doc because he was cool imo. After realizing his power was one of the most complicated, I went to trapper for a while to get the basics. Then I came back, now knowing how to play somewhat right. After a while, I could use his power effectively, and I’m still getting better with him each day. The best advice I can give you is learn the basics, master the basics, then find a main.
---
Agreed; Everyone should just spam posts about how generous BHVR are for selling $12 gameplay affecting content and for refusing to unban falsely banned people. The fact that they literally can't average 4 numbers is something that should be ignored so that we can all focus on praising the all the intelligent and not scummy people working at BHVR, all 2 or 3 of them atleast.
---
Not at all saying that? I'm legitimately suggesting that you get help, because you have anger problems. It happens, I've needed therapy in the past aswell, and theres nothing to be ashamed of there. Just there are better outlets than screaming about how much you hate specific people on the internet.
---
Y my pp hard?
---
"Pretty good job so far"
---
I like it. The pallet was pretty BS though, he didn’t even touch it
---
Have you ever actually tried playing sprit? Headphones are great, but you still need a shitload of skill to play her.
---
Careful what you wish for...
---
With exploits or with Frank's mixtape he could down someone with only one hit or 2 without counterplay. Choose.
---
It’s still broken so nah
---
From what I've learned on Xbox, when anyone flails their arms it means "The killer isnt nearby, nobody is coming for me, please unhook me." And staying still means "Someone is on their way to save me, or im being camped. Do gens." But I have heard it's the other way on PC. Confusing stuff.
---
You bet your ass I will :D
---
The only reason I prestige now is because that’s all I have left to do really. It would take maybe 15 Million BP to get the remaining perks on my Killers and then that’s all there is to do with them. I have my main Survivor to P3 with all perks so I only level the others up because it’s somewhere to throw my BP.
---
Do you have your console standing vertically by chance? 
---
See if booting into safe mode and rebuilding the database will help, oddly enough it fixes a lot of random issues. 
---
If that doesn’t work make sure there’s nothing within 5 inches of the right side, recheck the console for dust and then find a DIY video on how to make a console cooling pad, that’s been a usual fix for overheating.
---
True
---
lmAO SEX NUVMER 😂😂😂🤣🤣
---
Sorry, there's already a movie called 'Salt'.
---
😂
---
Yes, but you don't NEED spinechill to outplay the spirit. It just helps.
---
Plus it helps against almost any killer, so it's not necessary to be lucky using it; it's always gonna be useful.
---
Also that's one dev's opinion. It's not the end all be all.
---
Always when i do flashlight save the killer will mori me🤷‍♂️
---
We already had a chainsaw hillbilly, and guess what, they added another one. Plus I don’t think his ability would be anything like the clowns.
---
Survivors  who drop pallets and extend chases are toxic, didn’t you know?
---
That's Carson he is an adult
---
It ain't all bad, I have met so many kind as heck red ranks as survivor, they get salty but that comes with the territory of red ranks, don't feel too bad, it is just the community feels prideful when they first reach it, others just don't learn, they can't do anything but annoy you those guys.
---
Nothing wrong with that mate we’re basically apart of SEA

---
The thing is, when I run lightborn I don't need it but when I don't I do need it

What? You don't like it? That's a shame.

I really hate these types of players. Its quite literally my job as my job as a killer to KILL you. I understand very well that (tunneling) and (camping) are not cool in most other types of games and it makes it "not fun for the survivors". But in games like DBD, it's damn near impossible to Kill certain players without it. If you managed to get caught, it's your own fault. And as the killer, once i catch you, you're now my play thing. In that instance, I get to do with you as i please. The only way you escape is by the tools you have available to you and the other 3 players who can help. It's one overwhelming threat against 4 regular people. At least in theory that's what it's supposed to be. But, some people still seem to entitled to win they blame the killer who's doing what killers do. That's the entire point of the game. There are ways around tunneling and camping. You just have to have survivors willing to help and tools in your kit to avoid getting found in the first place. I've played games where I've only ever downed one survivor the entire game and still didn't even manage to hook them. all the while 5 gens get done in like 2 minutes, gate is open and I get t-bagged as they stand in the door way. That doesn't seem fair now does it. But, that's because I let my self get looped, didn't know when to respect pallets, and had no perks to speak of the help me. IT WAS MY OWN FAULT. And if i only manage to get one survivor that's my own fault because I wasn't prepared with the right tool set in that situation. I know this is probably gonna get disliked or lost in the void of Reddit. But, I've said my piece and I'm not gonna argue with anybody about it. The killer makes the rules, there's no made up honor code, play how you want to play.
---
An apple a day keeps the Doc away

**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Spam
---
No that would mean he would be in his 20s...
---
Trying to scare the killer eh? Solid choice
---
dying after two minutes cuz you don't wanna gave her corrupt anal pwnage doesnt sound very fun either
---
Yeah, I've recently started phasing out Nurse's out of my builds. Did they nerf the distance in Ghostface patch? I'm pretty sure it used to be wider.
---
Free points for us, though, some killers might do it to be nice tbh
---
Interesting. Commenting so I can try it later! I'll report back lol
---
Idk why but in this game it suprises me more than any other game because they are such bullshit claims that it's sad that people actually think them. In COD I could understand where they were coming from sort of. For mortal kombat I haven't played but I heard its bs claims like this game too. Idk it sucks.
---
I had that when i chainsawed someone when they not only were well over window they also moved to the side. I look at them they looked at me and i left them slugged it was that bullshit xd
---
Haha I am going off memory, is there a Jake? I have only played a couple games my bad, don't know everyone's name. 
---
Thank you - I will assume it was more of the luck and distracted part. Dead Hard was the other perk I was thinking of starting with.
---
Super funny. This. Is. Good.
---
Idk how it works I just know it’s good I’m. New
---
Yeah basically you're fucked against any Nurse/Spirit who knows what they're doing. They're totally busted. As a Billy if you're up against survivors who play perfectly there's only so much you can do
---
They dont. I get tunneled to the point where even having DS is useless if Im still gonna get downed after I use it.
---
That actually sounds decent and fun why isnt it stated it stacks?!
---
Freddy was reworked for balance purposes. Rank 20s are people just buying the game and potential spenders on cosmetics. And Freddy was a noob stomper since he excelled at tunneling and tracking. His rework made Rank 20 less toxic. So in a sense it does kind of help with maintaining the newer players.
---
As cute as Quentin is he would be competing with Steve "The Hair" Harrington and Dwight. Quentin never stood a chance fam :/
---
And it's obviously this guy, they're toxic as shit and proud about it. We need trash like them out
---
It's called being a passive agressive little bitch, I bet you wouldn't even use it if we could see who downvoted would you? Anyways something for you to ask your therapist, I'm sure they'll say it's completely normal behaviour /s.
---
Who asked you tho?
---
&gt; At least Spirit is blocked by walls and has a cooldown on her power.
---
No, no, Spirit's just a total *auto-win* since the only thing I do when I go against her is grab my ankles like Reddit tells me to do.
---
And huntress and myers
---
I don't know who the second higher-tier killer than Spirit is because she's definitely #2
---
Personally I just ignore them, usually in swf trying to protect their low skilled friends. It annoys then if you dont give them attention
---
Part of me wants to keep it because it's hilarious, the other part of me wants them to change it so she's as creepy as she could be
---
No you just aren’t very good at this “funny” thing. Might wanna learn how to take criticism in the future.
---
Every Bill is a treasure. My survivor main is Bill because I used to be a huge Left 4 Dead player
---
When I first started playing premonition was my jam. It helped alot with sneaky killers, and with hearing the rest of killers just before the heartbeat, I would sneak off to hide. I would waste the killers time because they would end up looking for me for so long before a chase lol 🤣. But it also was lower ranks so 🤷
---
I switched to spine chill for awhile, it was more useful for knowing if the killer was pretending to not know if you were hiding somewhere. Figuring out if the killer actually knew where I went midchase and wasn't pretending.
---
In all honesty these perks taught me some good game sense. Just taught me killer awareness, along with I feel like instincts of 'oh the killer going to come over here, going to sneak off to start at a loop'
---
I feel like this is referring to his birth but that's just me. If his confirmed age is 19 it doesn't make sense for him to 42 now. People don't age in the entity's realm.
---
Don't tell these dipshits that. It makes them feel better vaulting into the husk for the fiftieth time when they tell themselves that it's those damn facerolling Spirit's fault.
---
Well no shit, but in real life he’d be 42
---
I fully understand where you are coming from. The survivor mains dont understand that, and especially when you get a swf and you have to tunnel because they are being so toxic to a certain extent but they get mad that you finally killed one. I dont do much tunneling unless I see fit, I prox camp but that's only when I know there is another survivor around. If I'm getting looped for so long I will usually just say screw that person and move on because if you dont you will lose unless you have NOED which is a illegal perk appertnly. If it's in the game I will use it. There is no rule books saying I can't. Survivors need to get over it, it's a game, camping isnt illegal, tunneling isnt either, but sure enough you have the survivor police put you in cuffs for it. Hell yeah its sometime a dick move but some people really deserve it. I had a trapper match and it was the end. I just hooked to survivors and killed them. One just escaped and I had a meg at exit gate tea bagging, she didn't know I had noed, she kept taunting and I got sick of it, I ended up luring her out of the gate and downed her and killed her. I had a match the other day against some somewhat trash people, I was nurse, 2 survs are already dead and I put Adam on the hook. I knew he had deliverance and he looped me for about 2 minutes and Bill didn't get 1 gen done. I threw him on a hook, and back pedaled with my blink ready. He gets off, at this point I'm somewhat far away, and I blink to him and threw him back on hook. He cussed me out and called me garbage tunneling trash can, etc. But is it my fault I knew he had deliverance, you didn't have to get off hook. He could have waited for me to get tired of waiting. But I'm the bad guy. He should have blamed his teammate for not trying to rescue him.
---
Just had a game where a Jake said I'm "so mad" because I "tunneled him" by apparently hooking him twice in a row, even though his second hook came from farming a dwight in front of me. The ego on some survs in mental.
---
Yes, yes, nothing in this game takes skill and everything's *^ezpz*^.
---
I always just assume the killer is running NOED. 9/10 I'm right. LOL! You're right....the bloodpoints for doing bones are nice!
---
LOL!
---
Then after the game she's gonna accuse you of lag switching. I hate survivors like that. If there's bad ping they need to leave. It's no fun for anyone.
---
It was in the mettle of Man meta where everyone was running it
---
I remember getting 6 hits with bodyblocking survivors until i got to the Hook that was like really close
---
I won that game.
---
YouTube has guides. Learn loops from these guides, just google them. Also, watch good killer streamers. Best things to do for yourself
---
an advance nurse would use shadowborn instead of ruin
---
The Ass Wiggle of Desperation! I love it.
---
Freddy being balanced having an indirect boosting effect on the game is a good point.
---
Still, whether Quentin would be worth it depends on the arrangement, I guess. A huge up front sum? Possibly not. A portion of the revenue from purchases - probably worth it. 
---
I already own Quentin because I wanted to play Freddy and the DLC is more worth it, but honestly I would consider rotating him into my main roster with Steve and Laurie if he looked good. Obviously I'm not contributing anything since I'm a done-and-done customer, but others might've only bought Freddy with shards and might feel similarly about Quentin.

Kyle Gallner himself supports the redesign.

It's so that if you go the pay2win route that BHVR desperately wants you to go, you'll get more ebony mori's.

I could be wrong but I think the auto aim is only for regular hits and not lunge attacks. I have had pretty good success with it when people try to 360 me. Try getting closer and using the base attack instead of lunge.

what in the fuck are you talking about? autoaim keeps swinging left and right cus someone moved a micro meter to the left while i was swinging

I swear opening the exit gate is the most stressful part of this game

And there is no need to be mad

The perk should have never existed in the first place. Any amount of forethought would have made them realize how much it killed the bottom 80% of the cast. If it comes back at all it needs to be a completely different perk.
---
Nurses don't need Ruin but for some reason, every Rank 1 Nurse is sadistic and feels the need to run meta perks.
---
If survivor queues seem long, play Killer - and vice versa. A lot of the time, those delays are caused by too many people queueing for one role and not enough for the other.
---
I honestly think that they purposely took a "safe" overkill approach when buffing him after the disastrous ptb with Ghostface. They'd rather a licensed killer be broken in beneficial ways as apposed to making him suffer from it. They switched it from being able to accidentally reveal him to oftentimes inexplicably being unable to reveal him.
---
so i should get used to autoaim cucking me over again and again amd again??
---
plague is low mid tier. and survivors deny her power, ur telling me that my idea suck when u say a killer is okay but she cant use her power at all.
---
An advanced Nurse would use whatever build they wanted. But streamer say so you do right?
---
The only time after rework I was able to hit all survivors with the power at once was when all four of them were at the basement.
---
With any other killer, that would have been bliss, 3 hooks minimum. With Legion it was 4 boo-boos they quickly healed while I was grunting staring at my hands, filled with teenage angst.
---
corrup purge takes 50 seconds, not 60 like how she is in game rn
---
Exactly, All i want are games where nobody is gonna blame everybody else for their mistakes. But, I guess that's too much to ask.
---
**Premonition**
---
* Activates when you look at the Killer (every 30 seconds. I guess it's not as easy to counter by moonwalking?)
---
* Sucks big donkey balls at early levels.
---
**Spine Chill**
---
* Activates when the Killer looks at you (without a cool down)
---
* Gives you increased action speed
---
* Gives you increased *vaulting* speed ~~(and before anyone comments anything yes it still does check the goddamn Wiki)~~
---
* Basically the same at all levels
---
I have 1300 hours in this game and over all those hours I have met **one** Killer who actually moonwalked to "counter" Spine Chill. The "reliability" of Premonition isn't worth the stupidly long cooldown (even at level 3) which makes its "reliability" near worthless.
---
Just remove the cooldown. Spine Chill would still have use over Premonition due to its increased action speed and vaulting speed.
---
Standing there ready to whoop his ass
---
Good thing survivors get a perk this new DLC to counter monstrous shrine.
---
Why all people hate Deja Vu so much? Okey, is a super niche perk but I found when I'm going gen jockey it lets me plan better what gens let for the end so the killer doesn't have a 3 gen near. As I say, not best perk but Left Behind is waaaaaaaaaaay worse
---
Definitely hop on twitch or YouTube to see how other really good players play. You can pick up on which perks are best to use and see different play style strategies. Massive learning curve to this game so good luck and don’t get discouraged.
---
Why do you think I’m trying to prove anything? I’m just saying I’ve never experienced it being broken since they “fixed” it......
---
I can't find to many games I enjoy anymore. Dbd is a game I enjoy till I find that one match. I have stopped playing games like cod and siege because of that reason.
---
Him getting stunned stopped the timer. If you would have stayed when he got unstunned the entity would have continued. Either a terrible glitch, or a feature to prevent scumminess.
---
I was playing Meg the other day for dailies and goddamn I didn't realize how thin her arms are.
---
Most of these rank reset games just end up being the survivor not knowing where to run to and then a P3 Spirit just downing the survivor in 10 seconds. I don't know how is that fun at all. Killer side ends up being killer not knowing where the survivor runs to and you can just so easily lose the killer in a cornfield.
---
Rank reset is an outdated mechanic that should be phased out, or at least implemented with a longer duration. Once a month is really crap with all the red ranks just bullying new survivors or killers who only have one perk to work with.
---
I don't see how rank reset creates challenging games when all it does is create one-sided games that disfavor newbies greatly.
---
You should get used to playing with autoaim do you get the most out of it
---
Practice makes Perfect
---
Take a deep breath, go make some tea/coffee and try again
---
Thanks for the replies guys. Sounds like I will hold off till I use some of the better add ons.
---
Yeah but it only works with M1 downs. I would HATE to play a M1 killer without Spirit Fury/Enduring
---
thanks man &lt;3
---
Fuck I heard that with Samnation's Trapper voice.
---
Daily reminder that Kyle had no fucking idea he was even going to be in DBD.
---
I’m not sure about the gameplay aspects of how that would work so I went with something simple
---
I agree but saying dbd wont gain new players just because rank reset is pretty bollocks
---
I am gonna post this image every time my friend say "no I will play killer" to guilt trip them
---
*\*Evil Dwight noises\**
---
Plague is fine as is. Legion is lame in every sense and needs a rework.
---
I like to kill most Kates I come across because shes the stereotypical dumb blonde role. I usually like to let Jane survive because she has that whole final girl vibe
---
The netcode will probably be Godawful Nexon tier and overall games will suffer anyways, would like to think BHVR would be able to put something good together but seeing as their 3 year old game still has blatantly game breaking bugs like being unable to heal team mates for no reason I don't see how they will be able to sort out servers
---
wow, losing that ten seconds really balances out how she's guranteed to have a steady stream of purge coming in
---
well yes, legion needs a rework and plague is boring af
---
CAMPING IS A PRETTY VIABLE STRAT AT THE END OF THE GAME. CAMPING THE HOOKED SURVIVOR WHEN GATES ARE OPEN CAN NET YOU A 2/3 K
---
Yeah MoM was waaaay overpowered when released. It does need a rework now. 
---
I remember for a few weeks after that DLC was released, if I saw Ash in my lobby I would automatically assume MoM and be forced to switch to an instadown killer.
---
tbh I recently got Jake to P1 and I kinda feel obliged to P3 him.
---
In part because most of his cosmetics are trash and the bloody cosmetics are his only good ones.
---
[Jake's meme identity is that he doesn't exist.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cx2gua/where_my_jake_mains_at/)
---
The only one of them I dont have is Freddy
---
every second in DBD counts.
---
No problem, wish you all the best
---
I tunnel because survivors send me messages when they perform well. They can't just go find another game. I destroy people all the time and won't say word.
---
Yh sure dude just look at this and tell me it's fine https://youtu.be/3yrPi_kLzD4
---
Ok. So making survivors just die for not cleansing will enhance the gameplay 10x? If she is unfun to you, then don't play her.
---
An auto ds with multiple uses per match 
---
Yeah i guess i am just super biased
---
I'm waiting for Jeff and Kate.  
---
She is my favorite survivor over the rest, I would love to see her designed by you.

I was playing as Meg on The Game map against Spirit. I kept saving the 2 guys from the hooks until they eventually died. I was wounded and escaped the killer. We had 3 gens left and it was just me and Claudette left. Suddenly Claudette comes out of nowhere, heals me, motions for me to follow her. She proceeds to lead me to the hatch where she twerks on it a second, then runs away, starts repeatedly fast vaulting a pallet, and basically kills herself so I can get the hatch escape

 there was a time when the strongest nurse build was bbq, ruin, whispers, and NC.
---
no, but makes u not have any arguments:)
---
I DON'T FUCKING CARE IF THEY CAMP AT THE END, BUT IN THE BEGINNING? AND IN EVERY SINGLE HOOK? AND THEN NO ONE DOES GENS BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST STANDING BEHIND A STUPID ROCK WAITING FOR EVERYONE TO DIE SO THEY CAN GET THE HATCH.

Can you do real conversations or do you just hear buzzwords like "pay2win" and ignore all context? Yes the top-tier killers are f2p, I'm talking about getting more ebony mori's which are an instawin most of the time and you get 4 times as many if you buy all DLC.
---
I agree with you 100%
---
i play her to make post about it, and plague is fun to you?
---
This is what we call a “killer main”
---
Yeah but often times I see skilled and confident survivors teabag and flashlight spam me because they WANT to be tunneled to buy their team some time
---
Because if the whole team takes it then the killer is fucked endgame without NOED.
---
Not just a dev, the community manager, he speaks on behalf of the team. If they are willing to say stuff like that then expect nerfs tbh as his words represent BHVR
---
nice
---
Every time I see a teammate getting chased they always seem to head right for me
---
I love pig
---
I enjoy spreading pestilence, yes.
---
i actually think noed is not fair so not necesary a killer main, i play both
---
im sorry but maybe if you put fourth a reasonable suggestion id bother coming up with a legitimate argument. but your idea is  "no cleanse die instantly" that's not even worth bothering to argue with, it's just fucking stupid.
---
An auto ds? Ds gives a stun and MoM doesnt. Also multiple uses? Are we talking about the same perk?
---
The aura reading MoM gives the killer has given me multiple guaranteed 4ks because they couldn't hide. It really wasn't that bad
---
This honestly goes for every starter character except meg.
---
You got the 4K regardless so why post this?
---
&gt;Spins around
---
&gt;Ghost face revealed
---
It was a touch broken. Hopefully they find a happy medium somewhere
---
u have 2 minutes to clsense omg so OP.
---
There's really not. Ive had some fun games with Plague by just blasting corrupt purge in a circle, but she can't quickly traverse like Billy, Spirit, Hag, and Nurse. She can't be stealthy either like Myers and Pig. The one thing I do like is when you hear a gen, you can puke at it and infect everyone working at it
---
I am in red ranks and have definitely had matches where I’ve done less that your Match 1, and still got my pip or safety.
---
Absolutely love doing this, overly altruistic survivors will sometimes even let you get a 4k without ever leaving the basement. They usually pop all the gens then run around the map trying to find ya. Once theyre down the stairs, its over for them lol
---
Its best for you to watch some YouTube for survivor looping tricks
---
Even after playing 800 hours as a killer i still resort to YouTube at times
---
so u like playing injured all game with the screen green af, and with the survivor vomiting all day?
---
Id take a weapon wipe animation over getting stunned by ds any day, ds and MoM arent really comparable in that aspect.
---
MoM activated once per match, no one survivor got multiple uses from MoM. 
---
Object of obsession and MoM aura reveals is very different. 1) object of obsession is controlled by the survivor, they can choose to have their aura revealed by controlling their camera. 2) MoM does not let you see the killer. The only point in running object is to see the killer, MoM doesnt have this benefit. 
---
And no, I don't think you could avoid the aura reading effects of MoM unless you stayed injured, once you healed, your aura was revealed to the killer unless you were really close to the killer, or got downed.
---
The only survivors who really benefited from MoM were the really good survivors who didn't need MoM in the first place.
---
There are Survivor derankers, too, and often SWF, but at least Killers can D/C and ruin the game for them, while the WORST Killer bullies will continually pick up and drop downed players to farm.
---
Bruh do yourself a huge favor.

---
*gets hit*
---
"Get'cher damn hands off of me! I did NOT run through Hell just to die to your bullshit!"
---
I play the plague more than I vs her. Also, I cleanse when I need to.
---
Here's the problem, for the billionth time on this sub, with ranking people based on team success (number of survivors escaped/killed):
---
New rank 1 (survivor): immersed blendette squad
---
New rank 1 (killer): NOED Nurse, iri belt huntress, literally anyone with a stash of ebonys, camping and tunneling galore
---
There are unfun ways to succeed on this game, the current emblem system aims to keep those playstyles out of high rank.
---
Guess I just have superior face structure spotting skills.
---
It’s probably because A. Experienced players find it useless since you can either remember gen spawn locations or look for the light post or B. Being the former worst perk in the game when it only showed 3 gens at the beginning of the game and doing nothing else.
---
and people saying that corrup purge is OP, while there is a lot of counters to it: loosing line of sight, being inmerse and being at jungle gyms.
---
IT TWITCHES!!
---
I'll kill a Laurie if I get the chance just because Myers never could.
---
Except video games have models with hitboxes.for a reason. And swing animations for a reason.
---
If billy COULD swing his chainsaw in a circle at the end of his sprint, why is it possible to dodge him?
---
If the sprite of that knife is nowhere near my body, i shouldn't be getting hit. That goes for 360ing and windows
---
CORRECT!!
---
I used MoM but I also accept that playing as killer against everyone running it was cancer.
---
If you must ask for mercy you deserve none
---
Or literally just crouch walk around boulders lol.
---
Why does Quentin look so old lol
---
Well i post it because of the ranks and i’m only rank 16
---
Yeah seems trash
---
I don’t use it. But when I tried to put it on for 3 matches all 3 times I didn’t have a chance to use it.
---
Edgy
---
Bruh, same.
---
I like the idea of the perk, to be honest. It could use a slight buff in the numbers/percentages. And then it would be fine for basement builds.
---
plague is a plenty good killer dude. she has tons of tools in her basekit to help her. even if they dont cleanse you can bring an apple or the one that gives your purge when a gen is done. you just need to git gud because your suggested "buff" doesnt even help with her one weakness(a lack of map pressure)
---
Bruh pineapple on pizza is good
---
A slugged Survivor isn't doing anything, except maybe distracting allies. An injured one is exactly as functional as a healthy one, maybe more. DS or BT aren't guaranteed perks, and it's different if the unhooker is injured.
---
Even if they're both equal targets, though, assuming equal distance and difficulty of chasing, it makes more sense from a gameplay standpoint to rehook someone closer to dying because eliminating 1/4 of the enemy force is better than not doing that. Fear of certain perks and just being nice to people often out to bully you are the only reasons not to tunnel most of the time.
---
They're playing Nurse, the game is already beyond 2x as easy for them. Whenever I play Nurse I run Brutal Strength / Fire Up / Agitation / Shadowborn at Rank 1 and 4k ≥90% of my games. If I'm up against a SWF I just switch Brutal Strength for Ruin.
---
Running meta perks on Nurse is sadistic. It speeds up your already guaranteed win.
---
Its not just weapon wipe animation - its a weapon wipe animation with an extra speed boost for survivors while ds with enduring stuned you for a little longer then weapon wipe but didnt give you a speed boost meaning the same if not less distance is to be had
---
Mom activated more then once per match, seeing how the survivors could heal and gain more stacks, survivors that didnt get tunneled to shit generaly had 6 health states per match
---
1 self heal was enough to get another MoM proc in the Perfect condition, even more if you really tried and went to good structures
---
You could avoid the aura by healing to 99 percent - its not rocket science
---
Apparently this happens enough for the devs to know about it and are working on a fix on PS4, had it happen to me last night and when I submitted a bug report they told me they were working on a fix. So in the next chapter maybe this won't happen as much anymore

or you die instantly? yeah id say that's kinda fucking broken. where is my perk that lets me escape if the killer doesnt see me for two minutes?
---
I do hope they adjust some of the garbage perks to a state where they are worth using. I understand some are beginner perks but with the huge amount of perks it sucks basically only seeing less than half of them
---
[You virtual rapist! /s](https://youtu.be/q3mQwyVNycI)
---
Hi, I'm Chris from the popular tv show Family Guy. Can someone explain the joke to me?
---
I've never really found a problem not running those. I rarely am able to hit through a pallet anyway. Even then if you have a 3-gen pallets should get clapped anyway.
---
Almost a perfect game score. Nice!
---
But if you’re posting to brag about the 4K, those don’t matter. Sure there are 2 higher ranks, but there are also a rank 16 and 18 in the game, so that was probably more of a hindrance to the team.
---
Well, you got it around (great job)
---
bruh......
---
People complain if the rank system gets more harsh, but what they don't understand is that a "soft" ranking system like we have now creates a tons of problems. For example, since ranking up is so easy, the devs are forced to reset ranks every months. In addition to this, ranks reflect how much you play more than actual skills.
---
Monto is funny, and though not super teach it can be fun to just sit and watch, Bricky has some fun casseroles if you wanna learn some lore but the info is a little out of date. Sorry I don't watch a lot for got gud stuff but these 2 are great.
---
for myself i watch Noob3, hybrid panda, tru talent, iamcows, and theking.
---
It wasn't bad if you are a great killer who happened to play against not optimal survivors. But there are also very optimal swf teams who will loop m1 killers all day, and they all have mettle of man good luck m1 killers! It needs a rework of some kind to be balanced and useful
---
I like the base trenchcoat body, with the drill weapon, and the head from the one with the shirt, just because the hair looks a lot better on that pig mask.
---
L told light he was “L” and just gave him the most intense look like “yeah I just did that so what are you going to do about it!”
---
I didn't know Mettle of Man could activate once per match, I don't think I ever encountered MoM happening twice on the same person, and I've seen some people say it only activates once. Either way, the basic attack prerequisite made it very difficult to have it activate more than once a match. 6 health states per match is kinda a stretch, most people got one extra health state, not even a guaranteed health state since you had no idea who the killer was gonna be, if it was someone who could bypass MoM, you may not be able to get to use it.
---
I still don't know if MoM did activate multiple times per match, but having borrowed time count as stacks didn't really do much because more often then not you can avoid hitting a bt survivor.
---
And yeah you could avoid it by 99%ing till getting in a chase, but it's easy to simply hit them again then leave them be, you get info from them just cause they wanted to use that perk
---
UM, buT i WoN i aM BeTtEr ThaN ThEm AnD tHeY mUsT KnOw!
---
-Actual SWF players, somehow
---
how is she a btetter tier 3 myers? also, pig's one is limited but u need the right box, plagues one is with every fountain
---
Personally, I like to watch Bricky. The videos themselves are pretty entertaining even if you're not a Dbd fan. 
---
However, he only does videos on killers and some may say the videos may be a bit outdated, but I still think they're pretty good and worth a watch if you want to learn the basics.
---
I started july-August 2017 and Ive never cared until now. But all these low rank killers are so sweaty and run unfun loadouts
---
Whispers is great on any killer including Nurse. It’s a really great tracking tool especially if you know survivor hiding spots. Like genuinely give Whispers an honest shot, I mean play 20-30 hours with it on. You’ll see how lost you can feel without it.
---
&gt; I completely agree that they need to return it to how it used to be. If you get a 4K, you deserve to Pip. Period.
---
100% agree, but i learned to stop caring. I'm having 4Ks most of my games and deppiping, getting into EASIER games and getting more 4Ks even more easily.
---
It kinda ruins the games for survivors to face a skilled killer at low ranks but that's not my problem.
---
i never said u should
---
The problem with increasing the gen repair time , as much as I want it to happen, is that most people hate sitting holding m1 for long periods of time. I’d rather see a different mechanic added, like bringing parts to generators or something. Something that would make survivors move around the map and increase the game time overall
---
Sometimes I use it to just do a basement build. But I don't really notice the difference.
---
I think instead of buffing it (because basement hooks would just turn into 1 hooks/easy faster camp hooks) they should just rework it abit. Idk how, but I feel it would be better than a buff.
---
Key is the only item I will tunnel
---
huh guess its not the temple of purgation its the temple of purgatory
---
MontoGang
---
That would be ideal, but BHVR cant balance the game for shit. Ebonys need a rework tho, for sure. I shouldnt have an offering that Im literally afraid to use out of empathy. It's completely stupid how powerful it is. If it doesnt get reworked, they need to recall everyone's stash and make them a new rarity that shows up every 10-15 bloodwebs
---
made with mematic
---
Good. Because I don't.
---
Yes, it is.
---
I just fucking told you how she is a better tier 3 myers. Literally everyone in the game is a one shot kill. And with myers you can one shot people from healthy to dying state. But with plague you can hear people crying and puking because they are broken.
---
Just don't BM and you will be fine! :D
---
Also... Nice crop, sh!tlord!!  (gotta keep traditions, sorry)
---
There’s a difference between a challenge and getting absolutely shit on
---
citamem htiw edam
---
It's all about the timing. You throw it to soon and it'll just move the killer, you throw it to late and they're out of the stun zone. I see people mess these up all the time lol
---
Projection much?
---
Thats all I want. As a killer, I have just spun in a circle and delayed my swing EVERY time a survivor shows they use 360 too much. And it 100% works every time. They count the entire swing animation as a "hit" and thats dumb. If I'm facing the opposite direction, but my model is "swinging" and my model touches his, that counts as a hit? 
---
My body is between his and my weapon, how does that work? 
---
As for windows, if there is no realistic way my weapon could make contact with him, that shouldn't count as a hit either.
---
FUCK THIS GAME'S BUG, I USED DEAD HARD AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED, I GOT TELEPORTED BACK AND THE KILLER KILLED ME FUCK.
---
Vergil?
---
Either Baby Dwight abuse is rampant or the Ellis hat is enough to condemn them because I don't think I've ever seen a shred of mercy for my level 17 Dwight.
---
Poor starters.
---
Another question: will the dlc cost more than regular dlcs? Just like how ghost face is cheaper?
---
True, but the same can be said for lots of “meh” perks, which are really just situational ones. Iron Maden comes to mind instantly. Technically had a purpose but it’s very “meh” in its current state. 
---
Not every perk can be meta.
---
They’ve already announced the price is $11.99
---
I stopped playing at 666 hours to take a break.
---
I kind of like and want it to stay like that in my profile but then I wont be able to continue playing
---
killer main say that noed is fine, survior main say that noed is unfair . i vote saying that is unfair because it rewards for killers not killing survivors, has a lot of counters but yea, kinda unfair.now, im not saying it is broken.
---
and btw, everyone can agree saying that plague is boring to play as and against, playing injured all game is boring and kinda stressful, and playing with a killer that u CANT use her second power is stressful and boring.
---
Usd?
---
Bro the autoaim is totally unnecessary and bullshit in this game. It's pretty unacceptable it sucks you into hitting structures when you need to lunge before a pallet
---
You played SWF?
---
Imagine if that is what you saw when playing him? that'd be torture af
---
If you want my vote, run we’re gonna live forever instead of no mither. Gets you bloodpoints faster so you can unlock more perk slots.
---
i love this
---
For killer (hag specifically) watch some older Space Coconut. Monto, HybridPanda and Noob3 are worth watching because they know what they are doing and pretty amusing.
---
Yeah, sometime after the demise of F13 they dropped the game free on PS+ so hopped in for a while and took a break and am now back for stranger things content.
---
I had never had it happen until the other day when the killer helped me find the hatch, only to down me and close it right in front of me.
---
Nope I’m solo
---
The thrown hatchet isn't created in the world from your POV, but a little further away from you. 
---
The hatchet is essentially spawning in/on the other side of a survivor you're in contact with. 
---
It's not a feature, more a design flaw.
---
Its a myth. U cant see a P3 Claudette
---
Imagine the devs of a serious game, like Dota 2 for example (just a random example), decided to implement a new feature where players can get lucky like 10% of their games, and be like 10x stronger during these games. Nobody would think it makes any sense.
---
I don't know people think it does for DBD.
---
I'm ok with rare offerings that offers an interesting twist on the gameplay. For example, Myers's scratched mirror. But when its an offering that just gives a massively unfair advantage to one side, that's bad design imo.
---
Just like you, i literally feel guilty even using a Mori because it feels like i'm using a cheat code.
---
Oh, yeah, I've seen Otz recommend and use it a lot. It seems much better for characters like Trapper or Billy than Nurse or Wraith, though.
---
I never used it in my early days because the sound it supposedly makes is inaudible. They made it light up, though, so it's great now, if only at level 3.
---
At least he was cool with it.
---
It was... It killed all killer variety in high ranks. I personally don't want to see it playead unless it gets a proper rework
---
I'm getting my favorite killers to prestige 3.

That would basically be Object but without Auras. That would be far too overpowered, since it tells you where the killer is, as opposed to Spine Chill which only tells you that they're coming. 
---
The cooldown should be drastically reduced, or if there is no cooldown, it shouldn't work when in a chase or something like that.
---
Yea this is a great idea for sure. +1
---
All he did is ask a question and you just want to be a dick about it. A LOT of new players learn the basics of this game by watching other people.
---
&gt;tfw I ~~used to~~ main Tapp 😞
---
I will GF tbag you. I know you've got it. So imma do a little dance maybe stab your friends.
---
Then there's killers like Bubba, Hag or Clown who don't even HAVE eyes.

Jesus Christ these are really freaking good.
---
Its Dead by Matchmaking though, what did you expected?
---
Wholesome players :)
---
I can't believe 90+ people upvoted that comment. That would be the most OP perk in the game if that happened, since it's literally "it tells you where the killer is". At least Object shows your aura to the killer as well to make it a risk.
---
"No"-Ghostface
---
nah with lightborn you can actually sometimes get a hit on someone
---
The reason I don’t use spine chill is because my ADD brain can’t remember it exists without a sound to remind me
---
Ebony moris make you win the match but punish you in terms of rank and BP, the BP being the bigger point in your situation since it costs 7k to get an ebony Mori in the bloodweb
---
I think they removed the Hag and Doc ones so now it’s just the licensed killers minus Ghostface
---
That’s the reason why the entity gave him feral frenzy! He can hear the heartbeats, cause he can’t see s#%t
---
I am downvoting you, not hiding that at all. System is there to note what you like and dislike, that is all.
---
Ah, you play her regularly! Then you know it takes skill to actually play her well.
---
So you can either:
---
1) Admit that she requires skill to play, and admit you are skilled at playing her, making the "just use headphones" argument moot.
---
Or
---
2) Double down on how you only need headphones to play her and admit you are not skilled at all for using her.
---
Make Your Choice.
---
This is what BHVR does. Release something amazing, then fuck it up. It’s annoying trend. I definitely think it was BS for them to release a perk then nerf it within like a month. They should have never released it in the first place.
---
Just so you know, I’m not defending MoM. It was beyond OP perk that was poorly thought out and then released. What MoM needs is a complete rework. If you keep trying to adjust it around a “free” hit to make it useable by the survivor majority, it’s always gonna be broken. Just redesign the damn perk.
---
Oink oink bitch! I heard you wanna play a game!!!
---
tier 3 myers has a faster vault.
---
and with tier 3 people would not know if he has infinite of the hair addons, also, not injured people cant use dead hard. so i dont see how plague is better than tier 3 myers.
---
Christine would be fantastic.
---
well, props.
---
At the time the hit registers, you're facing away. When you rotated, your weapon struck him. All a lag fix would change is when the hit occurs.
---
Okay, but that's a pretty small reduction to how far out you can go. A 6'5" slasher with a weapon should still reach pretty far over a windowsill. Freddy should be re-animated to stretch a bit when he lunges, though.
---
I've always wanted either the Shining or Carrie in the game, as someone else said, Stephen King despised this movie adaptation of the Shining so out of my two choices, I'd say Carrie would be a more likely candidate.
---
Look at your downvotes and you'll see what I mean

Today I played against a guy named "Tunnel me senpai". I did tunnel him. He cried like a baby once the game was over.
---
Pharmacy is amazing though.
---
Well thats their prerogative. Nothing I said was in a dick way. I feel learning this game is better 'hands on'.
---
Nice!
---
Lack of player base.
---
Damn I wish I had that attitude😭 but for the most part I’m pipping, I mean I’m a rank 12 and I can’t seem to get past that because of this fucking ranking system🤦🏻‍♂️ it’s only really when it’s late games clutches that I depip, that’s what gets me pissed. But yea I should rlly just stop giving a fuck at this point and let game decide who I’ll be going against🤷🏻‍♂️
---
"You have entered the comedy area"
---
What’s that thing on her nails? Cool art btw
---
Yes
---
Wiki says its been the same range since like 2016, though I think the main problem is everyone running We'll Make It and instahealing off unhooks, so you don't have any time to find them unless you're camping
---
If it did that, the cooldown would have to be increased since revealing the aura when they're close is an amazing ability. Or make it so the cooldown doesn't tick down when in a chase, so it can't be used in mindgames.
---
Good. We should kill more things.
---
^(Like Fire Up. That shit's OP as-ay-eff.)
---
Tinkerer could be real good on Freddy now actually
---
What's the bloodweb update?
---
Me too! LOL!
---
Playing with friends will definetly be more fun and a bit easier (since your friends will be able to tell you when they spot the killer or organize for rescues) but solo survivor is fun enough even if you sometimes find teamates that are worthless or even sandbag you. Been playing since release solo and have rarely played with friends on voicecomms, still having fun with it.
---
What the hell is a "nice" P3 Claudette?
---
Trapper is one of my favorite killers. You can slaughter new players with him or completely throw good survivors off.
---
Seriously, that’s what make Trapper scary. You’ll never find him a decent killer if you always trap pallets. I’ve had a survivor tell me post game chat, “Why the hell would you trap a rock”.  Got him though, didn’t I? You just never know what odd ass places you’ll step in a trap. That’s what makes him unpredictable and scary IMo.
---
Level 40 has 3 perks per web, level 50 has 4 perks per web.
---
Probably the best Huntress portrait I have ever seen, well done!!
---
Also username checks out haha
---
That would be far too OP, as it's one sided Object. If it did that, it should have a longer cooldown, or a medium cooldown but without ticking down while in a chase.
---
They all have eyes, just very dark patches around them.
---
Hag’s are seriously sunk in
---
Oooh, yes please.
---
^(I like my lore better.)
---
I see your point sir 
---
Calling a survivor toxic or a killer toxic is the same thing enjoy the game fuck how others play and be the example in the community you want to see!
---
That’s your opinion, it’s not his. Your answer was completely irrelevant according to the question
---
Honestly itd be a meme perk even if it all the numbers were quadrupled.
---
The fact that you didnt know, or didnt see or heard in your particular instances doesnt make the perk not work that way it had the potential to activate more then once and it did for lots of players
---
You didnt know if the survivor had borrowed time or not until you did hit them so that argument is pretty luckluster - ideally as a killer you want to hit a person while he is unhooking, and the hit the injured one going of the hook to slug
---
Even if you knew he had borrowed time you would be forced to go for the unhooking one which is pretty bs
---
MoM was broken not because its effect was too strong - its because it countered the wrong type of killers , the ones without an instahit that valued every hit as a resource
---
MoM used to its fullest by all team grants you a total of 8 extra hits per match, combined with ds, borrowed time and dead hard? Just plainly broken
---
Lastly MoM and borrowed time interraction was broken to this extent that when you had MoM and bt active, bt would activate first
---
That's a fair point: if the team does feel that way then they are obligated to balance the spirit to be more fun.
---
I'm not opposed to balances and changes to the Spirit, I'm just reminding you that she isn't broken just because she exists.
---
Removing the cooldown on Premonition would make it far too OP. It would essentially be Object but without revealing your aura to the killer.
---
ITT: People think a zero-cooldown Premonition would be balanced...
---
Even thought all survivors are oneshot if they dont cleanse. no these killers dont need a buff. just get fucking good.
---
I had no idea everyone would get so bent out of shape over this.
---
But what if it's a human that turned into a spider? 😏 Kinda like that movie where the guy turn into a fly
---
Just answer the question next time
---
As a killer main i have never struggled with it
---
I love it when a tbagging bitch steps in my traps.
---
I only have enough points for one perk rn, what would you guys recommend for a survivor? Prove thyself or diversion?
---
Which if they dont DO. they are still fucking oneshot. and that oneshot comes from HER POWER. so she is able to use her power (vile purge)
---
I'm just under 6 foot with a 1 1/2 foot reach. So lets be generous and say an extra 6 in height gives the same in reach. If I vault and step away from the window, thats easily 3 feet. The lag fix should make that stop.
---
A rotten pig masked never looked so nice.
---
Oooooooh A caveat. This makes it doable and not near impossible.
---
You should definetly add this tip somewhere, maybe request it be added in an existing achievement guide?
---
This is really valuable info for people that hunt for them.
---
IIRC they do not.
---
The first one
---
Good killers tend to slug consistently
---
Give it bloodpoint bonuses on every hook/the Sacrifice category and call it a day. A perk that encourages use of the basement (which is already an unhealthy mechanic with how easy it is to keep people down there/snowball out of control) is not a perk that should be strong.
---
Hell, I'd even be down for moving the bloodpoint bonus from BBQ to Monstrous Shrine.
---
Laurie hair rework when?
---
Shit looks like straw
---
I'll courious about this as well
---
It was literally a 100% guaranteed extra health state against all M1 killers unless they facecamp or tunnel with a Mori. All four survivors could run it, and combo it with dead hard and an instaheal.
---
Good. Hope it burns.
---
&gt;is No Mither somewhat decent? 
---
No Mither is actually considered a "Hard Mode" perk. As in, you use it to literally debuff yourself with some resemblance of balancing. It's gonna be reworked soon.
---
so if your first escape was with No Mither, really, good job lol
---
try "We're Gonna Live Forever", it's a newb-friendly perk that generates more points that will help you to unlock perks, both No Mither and Dead Hard are very hard perks to use properly
---
try to get Nea's and Claudette's perks asap
---
Lol. DS is not the worst perk: it’s an anti-tunnel now and works quite well! 🤷‍♀️ Don’t be salty.
---
no, its u that u get apes like surivor  or u play on low ranks, but when u get survivors who knows how to loop, plague is useless, same with legion.
---
there is no second objetive with plague, they dont heal or clense totems because its badly designed. so pls, play more plague or rank up
---
i think he’s saying you’re full of shit
---
I'll be an imaginary Johnathan main as well
---
Definitely fun solo, but it's a different experience with friends. That being said, I've made some DBD specific friends since playing where random people have asked the lobby to join their discord, etc so you might find people to play with.
---
I mean, aside from one perk, it’s the same build. And both Adrenaline and BT are strong perks. So you can’t really go wrong either way.
---
I would suggest trying out your build a few times with each perk and see which one you like more, and which one helps you and your team more often.
---
He clearly likes it!
---
frank probably listens to death grips, and Susie has a 5th grade EDM dubstep Playlist from Spotify
---
I don't think Surge will work with PGTW.
---
The ruin from monto's outro though haha
---
Ready to shit in the tall grass.
---
So ive been out of the loop. What changes are coming?
---
I don't know about you, but I'm avoiding Ebony Moris like low rank Blendettes avoid gens. You've seen how expensive these things are? And why would I want to play autowins without getting anywhere near as much BP out of the match as I spend on it?
---
The only Moris I brought in were those 3o kills you need for the achievements...
---
I use sloppy with grit on rank reset days
---
Well they don't have to use the Stanley Kubrick version either. The miniseries version would be ok. Mostly I just want the Overlook as a map.
---
I am very rarely able to find the hatch when it spawns. A key is a wasted item on me.
---
i actually would wait longer to get somewhere between ranks 8 and 14, rather than instantly going to a game and getting fucked over
---
I doubt that either of them will be getting edits. Quentin seems *possible*, but "Dooooo ittttt" doesn't exactly constitute a legally binding contract, and Jamie Lee Curtis has never been involved in the Halloween DLC in any way.
---
I remember first starting and not understanding why everyone was calling me "Baby Michael". It made me weirdly paranoid/curious and I was like, "Oh...I'm new and I suck. Makes sense..." lol Good times
---
Sloppy on low level survivors is pretty op, since they run self care
---
I think the idea of his power being used up by being looked at is the core problem. Maybe they should have made it a timed power instead, so Ghostface only has so long to sneak up on someone, stalk and mark them, and then go in for the kill.
---
lmfao
---
Levels 1-30 are unchanged. 40-49, 3 perks per web, you can take 2. 50+ 4 perks per web, you can take 2
---
Might be lag, if that was true then leatherface would literally be useless and survivors would not "take hits" because then the death circle your talking about would make the bodyblock pointless. I do want to say it's just really shitty lagg
---
I do play boring and she isn't boring. Just because your no brain ass finds her boring it doesn't mean she isn't fun for other players. Even if survivors don't cleanse plague still has a big advantage because of one shot downs. Even if she isn't stealthy the survivors still have a huge disadvantage.
---
Obviously...
---
That actually sounds nice. Unless im missing something?
---
Indeed, the PTB Is supposed to be a test so that they can fix stuff like that, otherwise they could simply release the dlc instantly
---
Also 360s wouldn't work
---
Yesterday i had a strange Killer game. I was rank 10 and faced a lobby full of red ranks. during the match it felt like "wtf did i forget how to play this game?" lol
---
Sorry about green ranks but as far as "mindgames" it's hard for me to distinguish because of how powerful she is.
---
I suggest hybridpanda, Monto is a close second, don't personally care for noob or true
---
bro keep insulting for no reason, ur gonna get banned.
---
and yet we are on a rice and repeat.
---
I’m sure they could balance it by not showing any indication for the first 2-3 seconds so pallets could still be mind gamed. Idk, I’m not a developer, but spirit is not fun to play against. 
---
Even though nurse is much better than spirit, I still like going against them more than spirit bc you tell where they’re going and attempt to mind game them back
---
It doesn’t feel rewarding to “mind game” a spirit phase bc you couldn’t tell what they were doing in the first place and just got lucky
---
Fuck BHVR for still not making "HERE COMES THE TRAPPER" his chase music.
---
It mixes alot of strong things in the game into 1 perk.
---
Every damn time &gt;:(
---
Balanced landing is better but you can't activate it on sheltered woods (unless you make the basement play). Just be sure to position yourself in places where you can easily activate it if you were to be spotted
---
Has start up and end lag, more visible, not as quick, not as funny
---
I’m talking about when after they swing, they just have this death circle around them during them wiping off their weapon animation for like a few seconds
---
4 horseman’s of apocalypse
---
Here we go again
---
Hahaha, Had to look it up, and yeah, pretty much. given the popularity of Jojo it's really likely the guys of Capcom took that as an inspiration.
---
wtf XD
---
Why not Marcus?
---
9 years of pill abuse please understand
---
Shcum
---
I've pretty much halted my normal grind to a trickle. If I get to around 950K BP, I'll spend them on something just so I can keep playing, but I'm done trying to max out characters until the change goes through.
---
Decisive strike is a must
---
It’s my favorite part to! And when you spawn in and you’re two feet away from the killer and he starts chasing you off the bat, my favorite
---
Every damn time, SC SWFs 😂
---
That. Probably the best anti-tunneling perk, stick with it. 
---
Even if you end up getting tunneled still, it punishes the killer for doing so by wasting much more time.
---
Dead Hard, DS, Borrowed Time, and Adrenaline is probably your best bet with those perks.
---
here are some perks u can consider instead of BT or Adrenaline if you dislike them (Dead Hard and DS are perks i really wouldn't replace):
---
* Iron Will: Pretty good vs Nurse and Spirit, especially with Bill since he is very loud.
---
* Balanced Landing: Surprisingly good combo with Dead Hard. On some maps its amazing. And on the maps where its not, you have Dead Hard.
---
* Self Care: Can be a good alternative to Adrenaline if you aren't running a med kit. A lot of people rage against it but it saves my ass a lot.
---
* Spine Chill: Really helpful vs some Killers such as spirit or GF.
---
Wait. Hex Lullaby combo? Surge makes the gen explode, but would this hex perk add the additional 6% as well to make it 23%? If it did imagine that, TT, and pop.
---
He's mediocre at best.  You have to have strong game sense and map knowledge to make use of your traps and you have to set them intelligently.  His traps are also a bit map dependent, like if you get the Game there aren't that many great spots for your traps besides the drop downs because they stand out due to the lack of grass tufts at pallets.
---
His add ons are garbage, aside from the purple one that makes your traps put survivors in the dying state, the pink that rearms your traps, the pink that makes disarming traps injure survivors (still mediocre though) and the bags that let you carry more traps.
---
Not a great killer but not a bad killer either.
---
Apt username , but maybe change amazing to standard. 
---
I'm highlighting a stupid mechanic that gives trash killers who can't hunt without tracks, a free chase.
---
Either understand the context of my words or eat a dick you moron.
---
Pharmacy is a definite top perk in my book, guaranteed green med kit then if you run ace in the hole you get add ons and didn’t spend any blood points! I’ve smuggled out 60 of them using Bill and have them saved for a Rainey day and if it’s been a shitty day playing survivor, I don’t waste any of my items with bringing them in, when I just run this and if I die in the trial, oh well I’m not losing anything...
---
It’s a nurse with 3 blinks. Also spine chill was going off as I was being unhooked. I didn’t really have a chance but I don’t think she was technically camping.
---
huntress
---
Whispers is a really good perk
---
But somebody tought it was a nice idea to give him a freaking white shirt for every killer playing at that moment around the world to be able to see them.
---
Then you get the people who only play one side and when their opposition is just flat out better than them, they view it as either cheating or toxic behavior
---
Hello?! DBD?! Servers?! ARE YOU THERE?!
---
Thanks for your words, I was afraid of investing time on him but if you really think that hes better than Myers then I will give him more chances.
---
And yea I was thinking aboht this exact build with PGTW
---
It's all a matter of chaining your hits. 
---
If you hit person A, and person B is far away, look for person C or D to see if you can make it over there. Even just hitting two survivors if enough to slow the game down
---
Heh facing a good nurse with 3 blinks really isn't fun i agree with you.  Its a broken Killer.
---
The entity vanquishes basic human needs such as eating, drinking, and sleeping, and perhaps even shitting......
---
It would be busted strong if it did, it probably won't work with overcharge either.
---
Some of my favorites are...
---
- Truetalent
---
- noob3
---
- Monto
---
- HybridPanda
---
- not Otzdarva
---
- Puppers
---
All of these players stream as well as having YouTube channels. They all know what they're doing but I think True, Otz, and Monto are the best of the lot.
---
Perhaps not, but they are more direct in their meaning, which can save time as others don't have to guess what the teabagging means.
---
the problem is this: its very hard to see how far or how close survivors are with killer instinct.
---
The Totem King does not approve of uncleanse totems.... *Breathes heavily* Let this be a lesson to you Nea BREAK ALL TOTEMS
---
Ehm... aight
---
Oh, now I get why people tell 420 all the time
---
You know survivors will cry if it does. I’ll enjoy it for the week before it gets reworked. 😂
---
Well, first of all, yes the matchmaking system is pretty fucked. A rank 8 survival that isn't even SWF can get a rank 16 killer, it just happens. Camping and tunneling is REALLY common, especially in lower ranks, those people you met during playing as a killer is probably SWF, which ends up queuing to a lower rank killer.   
---
My recommendations to how to deal with the endgame chat is just to say GG and leave, no need to waste your energy on them. Some people can get salty, or just toxic. It's just a game, you can always play another match and hope you get yourself a better time. You don't really need to change your playstyle, changing your mindset might help you though. If you wan to get good at the game, you can always look up tutorials on Youtube, or watch streamers play, you can actually learn alot from those. I recommend No0b3 and Not Otzdarva, Otz is more educational, and no0b3 content are more fun and always manage to let me feel like playing the game.   
---
And one more thing, if you just overlook their toxicity, maybe they saw that you won't tunnel or camp, they will lessen their toxicness. Talking from experience, that is. I hope you have a better time in your next game.
---
Obviously they added the fucking huntress no hit bubble for a reason. Don't get pissy at me cause I'm suggesting why they did it. I don't code the fucking game. Get pissy at the devs.
---
Server machine broke
---
He is a high skillcap killer - that's what makes him special in my opinion, he wont be as strong as a Billy, hag, nurse or spirit
---
But its fun to Play different killers
---
Or you know, steamroll with your favourite one
---
Noone forces you to Play sth you dont like, i dispise clown for example (gameplay wise)
---
I'm a DBD PC player since release, but I'm so gonna get it on the Switch. I wanna play at work, on the go, everywhere. I've been having a blast on the Android Mobile beta, although the shitty controls.
---
Well the generators don't get kicked, they explode, so I doubt you'll see any synergy there at all.
---
There's no way to change your mind. He is literally a garbage Myers
---
Practice makes perfect, you can make any killer work at Rank 1 if your good enough
---
... Adam! :[
---
Thanks! I'll check out those videos
---
Body blocking isn't toxic. Its very easy to counter and survivors don't really do it at high rank because it doesn't work.
---
A single body block is not enough to have the survivor wiggle off. 2 or more body blocks isn't worth it at all for them. Just hit the 2 survivors and then down them once the person wiggled off.
---
As for post game chat, i'd say i've had MANY games where i did absolutely nothing toxic and still had a lot of toxic comments. Just ignore them.
---
It's coming to switch?
---
I'd switch out Tremors for Overcharge or even Lullaby honestly. But I'll try a bunch of variations
---
But who shit in the tall grass?
---
2, definitely
---
Haha.  One red light.  Its just, not enough.
---
I hope at the minimum they remove range addons and additional blinks addons.
---
Yeah they are changing something, we dont know what
---
But i am somewhat happy
---
Even if they make her more skillbased, she will be left alone for a while at least
---
We have no details when it comes to the Nurse changes other than they will "mostly be looking at addons", which seems to imply they might touch on her base kit, just not much.
---
We also have no idea what addons they're changing specifically yet.
---
i actually want to build my own but i don’t have time cause of school rip
---
Work on the structure of the mask and it’d be a really good drawing. I like the hood.
---
As a killer I don’t avoid Lauries or dribble, even when they hit decisive strike I won’t go after them they deserve it lol
---
This is exactly why the community gets a bad rep, entitled players like you
---
May I take the place of Frank if those unmentionable things are what I think they are?
---
Huh? Are you just playing stupid or what? I saw your profile? You made comments before responding to that one lmao
---
Ah ok.
---
Mostly because there are people who leave if they see it also it might make killers wanna tunnel them or even camo to limit their teamwork or something like that. But if they all load in at once there's a good chance they're playing together, I heard someone say randoms can still load in at the same time too though so it's only a chance
---
Learn how to run tiles efficiently as a killer and you won’t have to worry about getting looped
---
Actually, even thought the idea is a bit of joke, the last paragraph is the much more serious part. If you don't think omega blink or prayer beads are op you are bad.
---
A little louder in the back for the folks who can’t hear you.
---
Yeah GF is really solid, I agree too that he's better than meyers. Meyers has more versatility in his addons but to be quite honest most of them are gimmicks that really don't work if the survivors catch on to your plan. GF on the other hand has much greater control over his stalk, can dissapear whenever he wants, can use his power as a poor man's survivor finder and can mindgame a couple previously unmindgameable pallets because of his crouch (the biggest one that comes to mind is the pallet right by the door on The Game).
---
Definitely run Ruin and Nurses on him. He synergizes so unbelievably well with Nurses and excels at ambushing healing survivors better than any other character. Beyond that, Ive had success running Enduring+Spirit Fury (guarantees you catch people before the exposed status runs out, plus these 2 perks make any killer viable lmao), BBQ+Sloppy Butcher, and Thanataphobia+whatever. When you're first starting out it can be awkward finding the right angles to approach from and you get broken out of your stalk quite a lot, so I'd reccomend double cooldown regeneration addons. They let you use your power much more aggressively and imo are his strongest addons.
---
Unless you play nurse you gonna get looped the entire match with these perks.
---
You can grab him off the toilet during the 10 seconds animation.
---
Not me, because I know there's a higher chance of them not DCing as soon as I knock them down
---
Fair enough maybe it's because I'm a killer main lol
---
I agree. But I personally don't want to save during Endgame if they got NOED or are across the map and have me die as well.
---
I will save people if no one else will
---
Michael's booty
---
I never get when YouTubers get taken by surprise by a flashlight save. I always make sure to face a wall when picking up or baiting the person out if I can't, and pretty much never get flashlighted.
---
Instead it puts a smile on my face because someone is wasting time with a flashlight.
---
yeah that’s true, never thought of that. would still be fun to play with friends tho
---
That's true kill you friend games cross platform would be alot of fun
---
They're from the 90s so I assume mostly songs from that era. Susie probably has like Spice Girls on there or something
---
It says we'll be able to see our scratch marks and Diversion sure does make them, so hopefully!
---
You should try Myers. One of the OG stabbers.
---
Billy drops to f tier
---
Bubba drops to ubershitf tier
---
*laughs in flip-flop, unbreakable combo*
---
*everyone laughs*
---
As a killer main you should be able to know that an omega nurse is way better than a trapper. Omega blink isn't balance and you don't need to play survivor to know that.
---
But as a Killer main, you should also know that if you play mid tier Killers at high ranks, the gens gets done way too fast which is why we need some additionnal ways to slow down survivors. Bathroom idea is a bit funky but we do need something like that.
---
Who dis Myres?
---
I didn't expect paei100 here
---
I can't look at them and not think they listen to Hollywood undead
---
True, a team of Dwights can rush generators like hell.
---
So you've never played against red rank SWF. I play as a survivor too. I even was on red ranks. But I have some respect to others, I play to have fun, not to destroy fun of others. Tunneling isn't "effect". It's effective. Is not tbagging in your safe comfort zonebeing a whiny bitch? Myers killed many others. He always left Laurie and then chased her in the end of the movie. Why didn't he just kill her on that street instead of stalking her? 99 EW3? xD ItS mOrE eFfEcTiVe To GeT pErSoN tHaT i HiT fIrSt - you're right. 2 hits is more than 1 hit. Simple math. 
---
You know what? Everything you wrote can be used against you. Here:   
---
*I believe you probably think looping is good because from day one you played as survivor you’ve probably never been good at it.* 
---
I don't think looping is bad and when survivor loops, then they are bad or toxic. Nope. Unless you abuse infinites, looping is not toxic. Looping is effective. Tunneling is effective. I don't complain about looping. Then why do you complain about looping? We can go even further - Gen Rushing is effective. But I don't blame survivors, but devs for letting such a thing be in their game. Tunneling is effective too. But you blame players, not game devs that can't reward killers for doing non-tunneling actions.
---
I don't tunnel unless I have to. And when I want to win or double pip, I have to tunnel. Why? Because of gens popping too fast and the worst rank system ever made. Emblem system, where you always get that gold Gatekeeper unless you tunnel and kill someone fast.
---
 *You’ve also probably never played as survivor as you wouldn’t know the feeling of being tunneled.* 
---
As I mentioned before - I played survivor. I got to rank 1. Solo survivor. Without help of any friends. No SWF. At all. I can understand when people get mad at killers for camping/tunneling, I did so too. But then I tried to understand WHY this killer camps/tunnels. When there's no reason, they're camping/tunneling with 5 gens left to repair, at the begging of the game - they're just dicks or they are trying to relieve their pain after the previous game where they had to face toxic SWF group that runs OoOs, DSs, Adrenalines, toolboxes and insta heals, and then, when you hook every one of them many times, you kill 2 of them, you don't use ruin, they still are gonna say "ez" in post game chat. SWF should be removed from this game to balance it correctly. But when killer camps/tunnels you, you can at least try to understand why they are doing this. Is it because of your toxic behaviour? If you abused one infinite window, used Insta-heal or tbagged at every pallet (I don't mind tbagging unless it's used just to piss off your opponent) - don't be surprised when you're facecamped. Others want to have fun too. You're not the only one that's supposed to have fun. If you do everything just to make sure that the killer has shitty experience - killer will do the same to you by facecamping you or tunneling you to kill you asap. Simple as that. Killer might also tunnel or camp when gen rush intensifies too quickly, their ruin goes off in first minutes of the match, gens popped before they was even able to start a chase. Nothing personal kid.

I'm still keeping hope they show it in the post-game lobby. Would help keep people honest but not affect pre-game dodging.

I still have pics of a baby dwight i met in my ghostface match, he opened both gates.
---
Agreed. This is very sanitized.
---
For a normal exhaustion perk, I switch between Dead Hard and Balanced Landing the most. Sadly both can have a tendency to just straight up not work, Dead Hard being the worst of the two for that. However there are maps where Balanced Landing literally cannot be used anywhere because there no high points. So the only place it can be triggered is the basement steps. Dead Hard is as some else said, ballsier and good for correct your mistakes. 
---
Also! 
---
Combining basically any exhaustion perk with Adrenaline is also fine. Adrenaline gives you the 150% speed boost for 5 seconds, heals you one health state, and trumps any exhaustion you may already be in. (It will just reset the exhaustion is all which can sometimes screw you out of Dead Hard, but Balanced Landing at least always has it’s passive.) It will also wake you up from Micro Sleep against a Freddy unless he’s using an add on to keep you asleep. 
---
If you run DS a lot and like to force killers into grabbing you out of lockers, you can try ahead On as an addition stun and/or back up for the killers who know not to grab you and try to wait you out. If they do grab you, you can DS, jump back in the locker, wait and the Head On them for another stun and run. It won’t work if they Enduring though. But I’ve seen a lot of people do this now and when it works is just fantastic.
---
Did you just start playing the game? Legion got hit super hard with the nerfski
---
They just need to fix protection hits and it'll be a decent perk.
---
If you could kick regressing gens Killers would just kick a gen 10 times to bring it back to zero, that's not how this works
---
Because a lot of killers hate playing against them since they have a huge advantage and they'd quit when they see the SFW
---
Wait... WAIT... You guys are saying me that Quentin's face are suposed to look like that actor face?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cx415t/im_not_sure_the_matchmaking_is_working_as_intended/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Instead of not being able to work on a gen, once bladder is full it should start a timer and once it reaches zero then you relieve yourself on the spot which makes you hindered for a little bit and you start to smell giving the killer a killer instinct effect to easily find you.
---
Using a bathroom should be interruptible but only empties the bladder bar for the time you did it for like healing or doing gens.
---
Regressing and damaging are 2 different things though.
---
This is billy, bud
---
Well said.
---
Your not wrong they do need to add some sort of second objective. Hex: ruin because a necessity at higher ranks
---
Yeah I have killers locked in my spider sex dungeon hbu
---
Yeah playing someone like plague at high ranks is just almost impossible and prayer beads, omega blink do need nerfs as a killer main give other killers a chance at high levels
---
You make a good point but spine chill makes dealing with spirit's power so much easier especially if she has prayer beads on.

Jake Gang rise up!
---
It seems 3/4 survivors in my games get to use it (I don't tunnel, j just get back to the hook and follow whatever scratch marks I see). It's a really good perk, not as amazing as it used to be but it's still top 7 for best I think
---
Does this intentionally have awful grammar?
---
I dont have that problem, i just say why would someone do that
---
I hate when killers use their brain and make smart plays. Completely unfair.
---
Huh, wasn't aware of this. I can definitely see the similarities but also see tons of similarities between him and Cameron, almost to a point where I don't entirely think it could be coincidental.
---
How are his addons garbage and how in the fuck do you think Bloody Coil is mediocre?  Iri heads, Honing Stone and Bloody Coil are all fantastic addons as are his bags for him.  Purple setting tools are strong for both speed and very unlikely trap escapes unless you're crazy far away or they got a teamate right there.  Wax Brick as a green addon is solid.  Trappers problem is 1 trap base kit not his addons.
---
Fucking mad lad right there
---
Obsessed from replies....?
---
The pallet teleport is gone so you need to be on the right side to drop them
---
Well I know if you play solo it's hard to tell your teammates if they should unhook, but if you get unhooked in front of the killer what should killer do? Ignore it?
---
Oh! come on!
---
Anybody else get this? never heard anyone talk about it but happens far too often for me

Why use noed when you can win the game before gens are being done

Serious question: Why do so many people hate on Tru3?

God I hope this is fixed with Dedicated Servers. Since the reveal mechanic works off a hitbox on Ghostface, hopefully it'll be more reliable on both sides with the Servers. (They also need to fix the damn vaults- I'm tired of being all the way through a window, and still getting smacked through them...)
---
I did this the other day on PS4. I love to give survivors a little bit of hope just to shit on their dreams lmao
---
I don’t understand why I have to be tunneled since I can use a flashlight effectively. I get saves and I blind the killer after he got DS’d by a team mate so they could escape. And that flashlight was yellow with no add ons found in the basement chest. At the end of the day I found it funny cause I don’t care to win, but it is a little bit petty. I play Killer first most days and I understand it can be annoying to have to deal with that, but in all honesty it’ll make them more aware of their surroundings. I got left bleeding out on the floor while the killer stood over me waiting for me to die so that was pretty boring.
---
I'm not hating on him, since hes a pro in the game, and since the game itself spiked in popularity, he will destroy every possible survivor. Seeing that most of them now for a while will be baby Dwight's and megs
---
Check steam charts, do it
---
Legion? You sure?
---
No but they can have the decency to go after the farmer. Or at least in chat “yeah sorry, it was just smarter to go for the injured survivor” Instead of “don’t be so obvious”. I literally couldn’t have hid.
---
I never said that all of them were good players dumbass, I said there is a smaller group of them that pull this kind of bs off. The majority of wraith players aren’t dick heads like you say so

Okay thanks

I know you didn't ask for it, but I want to explain this meme to you:

CallmeCarson is a 20 year old popular Youtuber who plays video games and does videos of the internet. A couple months ago, he participated in Minecraft Mondays. On the very first week, Carson fell for a trapped chest, and had a  [dramatic reaction](https://clips.twitch.tv/SparklingRockyMeatloafHumbleLife) of the event. Later, someone edited in Joe Swanson with a bat and posted it on Reddit, reaping over 2,000 karma.
---
Dude this community is so wholesome and I love you all. Definitely watching it
---
That’s what we call a FeelsBadMan
---
I have that too, buddy. 
---
Just one more bug in this game.
---
Oyoyoyoink
---
I only see facts in this post
---
Myers got me locked in his dungeon
---
Thank you.
---
That actually looks like him In the movie and he’s fucking hot In the movie so I’m ok with this.
---
I like the idea of survivors being “the ___”.  Being people who’ve been changed, assumes an identity.
---
that’s pretty groovy ngl
---
Ruin is overrated once you get to red ranks anyway. 
---
Survivors are either good enough to not care and hit their ruin skill checks, or they know all the totem spawns and will destroy your totem right away
---
Because gen rushing is a thing. Ruined gets blown in the first minute. Survivors running metas with 2nd chances have to much leniency to getting 8 hooks without camping or tunneling.
---
It's not rocket science
---
Yeah i only see 3 perks, survivors now spawn ontop of totems and you literally will spawn at the opposite end, i wish devs made it that if you use one hex perk that is lit from start you spawn next to it always, atleast give survivors time to look for it
---
Don't bring sides (killer or survivor) into this, the player is toxic, not the killer or the survivor. If they're a toxic player then they'll probably teabag as much as they camp.
---
No problem, stranger.
---
On the subject of bloody coil, it's not the hard to remain injured, heal yourself to 99, or find a teammate to heal you  and after disarming the traps.  
---
The other add ons you mentioned are the ones I listed as the ones that aren't garbage.  Do you really want to waste one of your two slots to make your traps slightly darker instead of an instant down or having them reset automatically?  
---
The setting tools don't make your trap setting fast enough to justify losing one of the good add ons.  
---
Escaping from traps is RNG based, I would rather have another trap or an ability I can count on.
---
I pretty much always take a purple or yellow trap bag with me, so that leaves one other add on to use.  
---
The traps themselves are unreliable, as good survivors will know where to look for them, and if you're spending time setting  more than one or two traps instead of chasing or patrolling you're playing trapper wrong.
---
Ruins is 100% necessary and if unlucky and its found early you are fucked lol. Even a nurse that end every chases fast might lose to a gen rush if she doesn't camp/tunnel whitout ruins.
---
No mither is by far David's worst perk so good job. If you want to keep using it trying getting resilience and other perks that week when injured to gen rush or use we're gonna live forever for more bloodpoints. Also get megs perks and be the greatest David. If you play if you're David you're more likely to have people like me to either spare you of they're killer or save you if they're survivor. I always protect David. He's the best even though I Play Jane
---
FACE CAMPING IS NEVER OK
---
I enjoy playing Pig, crouching in front of the last downed survivor and shaking my head to tell them not to wiggle. Even better if they spin back and forth to say they understand.
---
Issa meme control your emotions this must be true to you why so mean.
---
Whispers just helps you locate that first survivor and snowball. It's good on almost every killer. Only one I'd say couldn't use it as well is in fact nurse. Just because she already has so much mobility.
---
Exactly. Nerf the OP Killers, and then add some sort of secondary objective to slow down survivors so that Killers like Plague stand a chance.
---
LOL
---
Billy is probably c tier because he at least has high mobility. F for bubba tho
---
If killers spawn next to it that makes it even easier because survivors will know you're near the totem. Also a lot of killers camp their totems
---
Lol i like how serious your reply is. good ideas :P
---
That’s what I thought when I was watching Stranger Things
---
Some skins are just camo really. Ik some people use neon colours like neas but then there are also claudette that buy the darkest colours to help blend in
---
The 68% refers to your progress on the emblem bar, not the amount of gems completed in the match
---
Make your choice and range extending add ons are really strong together.
---
Brah I'm gonna spend so much money on this DLC.
---
I've got 3-50 All Perks on Michael, Ghostface and Spirit. In the process of 3-50'ing Bubba at the moment, and then start working my way through the others. :)
---
Get better. Dont get so upset about it. Their rank isn't even that great.
---
We are not sabotagers, we deserve the same treatment as every other person out there. Jakes rise up
---
Thank you
---
I never claimed it was toxic. Gens do tend to get rushed= gen rushed.
---
One of my problems with that is that totems are only a secondary objective when NOED comes to play. People say, totems are your secondary objective, cleanse them, but there is no incentive to cleanse them outside of NOED. Inner strength fixes that a bit, but you can still ignore totems if you don't run IS and the killer doesn't have NOED. Take away NOED, and breaking every pallet in the game is more important to the killer than totems are to survivors. And in that analogy doesn't make sense, it's because there is no "secondary objective" for killers that's as useless and situation as cleansing totems. 
---
IMO, no perk should hold that much power when it's not even in the game. Not even DS has that power, you slug the person that was just unhooked and you go after the unhooker, the slugged person is on the ground doing nothing until another teammates picks them up, meaning at least 3 survivors are not doing gens, or you wait the minute and come to the survivor and hook them again, meaning a survivor did nothing for 1 minute while you were off kicking gens or chasing. OR you pick them up, they either DS or are hooked, depending on whether they had the perk, DS is now gone and you can go chase them again, potentially even downing them not 10 seconds later if you're good. 
---
 I just don't get why does a killer get to benefit *that much* from a perk they're not even running??? I think that if the devs want totems to be true secondary objectives, there needs to be incentive outside of BP and the possibility of NOED, and inner strength is a good start to that.
---
Nah fam, red ranks all day.  Trappers like you waste more than half the match with little to no pressure while survivors disarm and disable traps whenever you're in a chase.  I bet you're the kinda guy that b-lines it for ruin, sets a trap in front and gives away the location.  See I can do an add  ad hominem straw man scenario too bro.  
---
There are anti loop perks you can run if you're having that much trouble downing someone early game.  You could do the enduring and spirit fury wombo combo with ruin and bbq.
---
I like this idea a lot. If it was same as the "action" button it would mean you can't reveal him without stopping your repairing/healing.
---
He needs to be both more consistent to reveal and also not as easy to reveal, this might actually work better than reducing the reveal range for him
---
W
---
Hell yeeeah
---
Devour and Make Your Choice are likely going to be the meta for Demo.
---
I HAD A GAME WHERE 4 BPS WERE BOUGHT BUT SOMEONE FUCKING DC MID LOADING
---
Well, in Spirits default skin her hair goes up very, very high into the air, to be point of making her the tallest killer if her hair is counted. This makes it hard to fool survivors at loops with lower walls into falling for your moon-walks and mind games as they can just see where your hair is to determine your location. Her short hair cosmetic fixes that.
---
Get better and stop caring about ranks or playtime. You are just going to need to get better. The game isn't so popular it has new influx of players  every day and week returning. If anything it's a dedicated fan base mostly.
---
Like the others have commented, I too feel like just combining We'll Make it and WGLF would be awesome. They could just add We'll Make it to WGLF and they could just remove We'll Make it.
---
Because every time killers have to deal with flashlights, it's no fun. We get blinded and the worst of all, we drop the survivors. It's not fun at all. SO of course we're not gonna be happy to see flashlights.
---
Yeah GF is inconsistent on both sides. Theres a lot  of tweeks that could help make him more viable and more fun to face
---
It’s annoying to deal with but you are right it’s a totally valid tactic if your in range but as long as your not tunneling them after every time their unhooked and your proxy camping it is very annoying just try not totally tunneling also Decisive strike is something you have to watch out for 
---
(but slight warning no matter how nice and not toxic you play there will aways be survivors calling you shit like this)
---
Running a lot of hex perks could potentially work well. Devour and MYC are always a good combo for Hag. Jumping onto people immediately after unhooks is usually the way to go for Hag. Basement trap spamming, while frowned upon, always seems to work well.
---
Hag is a high tier killer wich does pretty well in rank 1. Dont let anyone tell you that shes not, because they dont know anything about her.
---
Theres a main hag channerl, space coconut, with a lot of guides. Hes very bad at the game, but he knows the theory.
---
With the hag you are playing chest. First, you have to trap the main buildings of the map, trying to stay hidden. Never chase survivors, hit them and let them go (unless they are running to nowhere OR to a loop you already trapped).
---
Change you teleport key to the space bar, so you are faster with it. Im always spamming the teleport except if im about to hook someone.
---
Remember to use your traps in order to stop loops.
---
You have to learn maps deeply, so you are able to identify where survivors are gonna run.
---
A lor of people says that hag is not high tier because flashlights. And when they say that I laugh my ass off. They can not destroy your traps if you are chasing, amd the traps are almost invisible in 99% of the maps. Also, you have Franklin's. Urban evasion is like iron wild for the spirit. Can help, but definitely can't destroy you.
---
The best add-ons are the distance teleport and the aura reading by far.
---
The way you win with the hag is snowballing. Once you hook someone, the game is over. Use your traps with intelligence. Dont stack them on the hook, but trap all the places they have to hide (and yes always one trap im front of the hook).
---
You have my exact same build. Keep using it, is the best one.
---
Practice with her a lot. Learn maps, and learn to mindgame at pallets with the traps. And, most importantly, learn when to chase, when to teleport and where to trap.
---
Keep practicing her, shes one of the best killers in the game. A fucking beast at all ranks. Also, she takes advantage of altruistic survivors, so you can smash that 4 SWF. Nobody knows how to fucking play her, so if nobody will spect most of your plays.
---
I will answer any questions, so pleas dont be afraid to ask.
---
That's like saying killers kill-rush
---
My final 2 gens stay up generally.  I could care less for the first 3 if it means I end my games with gens up.  My experience is red ranks as well Trappers my main.  
---
And no your comment is laughably inaccurate I don't check Ruin period early game because it gives away the position.  
---
I've played trappers like you and they lose those same gens early that I do from attempting to chase me without a proper defense laid.  I will cost you multiple gens as a trapper if you choose to chase me on an open largely trap free map.  At least my way sets me up for mid-late game.
---
Those poor souls have no idea what they're walking into
---
How can you tell if someone has DS?
---
Well, If the match ends in 2 minutes, what else do u call it...
---
Who's channel?
---
I've been seeing this a lot and Im pretty sure the same guy made Laurie and Tapp look better so people should really post about those as well lol
---
Now this is quality.
---
Yeah, it nerfs swf a little bit because everyone would have to run it if they want it instead of just 1 guy having it and unhooking everyone and it would buff solo survivors a little bit
---
Okay.
---
It's mostly unfun and sweaty, because if you find one weak team member and exploit their weakness right at the beginning, you basically auto-win in many situations. The person who died doesn't get to play hardly, and the other people have to play most of the match without a full team. That's what happens if you down and hook one person as fast as possible, which is tunnelling. 
---
Now if you're going back to a random hookedperson in a game and hit them to down them when they're unhooked, that's just advantage: tunneling is doing it in a specific way to get one person out of the game asap. 
---
Once you get to higher ranks, doing this is literally impossible because of Decisive strike and borrowed time, which basically keeps you from touching unhooked people for 15 seconds and keeps you from hooking them for a minute. So just keep playing and either those comments will go away or you'll start losing.
---
Whenever I'm playing as Ghost Face and I have someone on hook struggling about to die or someone on the ground that will immediately die if I hook them I like to just pop Night Shroud right in front of them so they can reveal me to get more bloodpoints. Bloodpoints are a tad tiresome to get so I shall do whatever I can to help ease the bp grind.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
He was also making a joke if you actually took “you filthy casual” serious that’s a total bruh moment
---
Speaking of campfires. Is the dildo still there in the campfire?
---
It's just looked at as "taking the easy way" to get a kill. I personally feel the same way as you. If I have the option of chasing someone I've already downed who's slower now because I've hit them, I'll typically choose them over the healthy and faster person who will need 2 hits to down. Ultimately anything to impede gen progress is what matters, and taking 1 of the 4 out of commission does just that. People just get bummed out when wait times for a match are so long and they unluckily get to meet the killer first who "just picks them". I will tunnel the everliving fuck out of you if you tea bag me at all though.
---
Don’t forget aftercare
---
this guy gets it, git gud at memes
---
Sure. Play however you want I don't care. Do you enjoy constant meta Nurses who consistently 4k?
---
Yes and any survivor that tries to body block is affected by "foul smell"
---
Im just realising now how cool the nurse is and how suppressed her abilities are for "balance reasons" 😯
---
Say there are perks that can make a  noise notification when ever a survivor even steps onto a teleport spot, and the hex perk is in a one way, open spot. Then it would be pretty good to keep Devour in play
---
Got stabbed by a T3 Myers, and it created this weird texture bug that only went away after I was hooked (it appeared again after I was stabbed a second time). Didn't know where I should report minor bugs like this, so I'll just leave it here for now
---
Thank you for taking the time to type out that response!
---
When you say trap the main building first... when you spawn into a match, do prioritize heading over the the main building first to start your web? I always seem to spawn in a corner of a map, so I will start trapping from the nearest gen and then expand my web to include half the map from there. I do not prioritize adding the main building into my web unless it is in a close location. Would you recommend heading to the main building first, then start building the web from there?
---
How do you deal with the OOO user with a flashlight? These demons will follow me around and trip my trap with flashlights, turning me into a M1 killer. I feel like such a potatoe aganist these users and have no idea how to go about minimizing their threat. Do you just ignore them or tunnel the everloving heck out of them?
---
Thanks again for the tips and encouragement &lt;3
---
why post this
---
And foul smell makes it so you can’t work on actions with other survivors and the only way to get rid of this effect is to find the soap item and return to the bathroom and use the shower action
---
Definitely love MYC, but I find upper level players are a lot better at crouching during unhooks xD
---
Yep, that's why they did a complete rework when they realized he was a total joke. Now he's one of the strongest. Probably a big part of why they wanted to avoid another case of the same thing at all costs.
---
Man I already explained it to you and I don't want to just keep repeating myself over and over because you have your opinion of how he should be played and I have mine.
---
You assume I'm not going to down anyone because I don't rely on my traps as heavily as you do to secure a down and kill.  I assume you waste your match setting traps that get disabled or go unused.
---
I still stand by what I said, and I will reiterate what started this conversation.  The majority of his add ons are bad with a few exceptions, I think he is on the lower end of the middle tier.  Not terrible, not great.
---
It is a lil bit big but to be fair it does match her in the movies really well lol
---
Jake is hot and we need a shirtless cosmetic for him
---
*onk onk onk!*
---
🐖🔪❤
---
Wait, people actually think taking ghostface out of NS  is a good thing?
---
lol
---
It definitely is. Because I'm still not bored of these. Still makes me chuckle.
---
Lol I would have so much more respect for you if you ditched the mental gymnastics and just embraced the fact that you choose to run the biggest crutch perk left in the game.  Just tell me to eat a dick and that it's your game and you'll play it with whatever perks you want.  But your steadfast determination to frame NOED as something it's not is just sad.  It's a safety blanket for players that are brand new or really bad and still don't know how to apply map pressure or intelligent decision making midchase.  Try and play games without it and see how well you perform my dude.  NOED gamers are typically dependent completely on the perk for their kills.  It's a substitute for learning the game.
---
I prefer in game laurie tbh
---
to show how broken matchmaking is.
---
my gf in a nutshell when it comes to shirtless Myers
---
cant tell if that should scare me or not
---
To each there own Laurie in game just looks stranger to me lol
---
bhvr add this
---
not fun to play against as you have no say in when you are taken off hook
---
Honestly i predict that the high risk aspect fits with how Demo will play. I think if you get things rolling early with Demo it could snowball pretty fast
---
Yes. I'll just send a link to it.

Idk. There’s 2 direct counters to this: DS and BT
---
If you and the rescuer aren’t using either.. it’s your fault
---
True but why do they get mad at killers? Ive seen people.do this many times even in swf
---
https://i.imgur.com/gA6tdPK.png

if they knew how to run to a pallet and throw it down then they wouldnt be having the problem of being tunneled.

ups...

lol nevermind
---
Also Good game, Ghost Face!
---
I still dislike how he is named "The Ghost Face", sounds so strange.
---
thanks for the info lmao
---
na it doesnt.
---
I'm playing at rank around 10 - 13 so I don't even see Nurse that often. Sure it's not fun for survivors but I don't hate them for running those perks.
---
Sorry for the delay.
---
It’s easy and won’t harm it at all.  Make sure you choose rebuild database, NOT format.

---
any teleporting killer is good for make your choice, so yeah. mabye run a lil bit of haunted grounds too so you can zip from one portal to a portal near a gen so you can insta down some kids
---
Leave me alone
---
I mean if you’re willing to run that perk is a risk/reward of its own, if the killer doesn’t use a mori then it’s useless but if you take the risk and run it then you’ll be rewarded with a second chance
---
trapping the hook is good, but also trap the nearest two pallets/windows on either side of the hook.  You want to lock down their escape routes.
---
Yes that is what he'd see if his face was two feet from the holes
---
I actually say to my computer screen "Stop it. You're making me look like I'm facecamping. Stop it and run away so I can pretend that there's no survivor here and chase you."
---
Just get better. Seriously. It's a game. Dont take it so serious. Besides you will get better playing against the "best"
---
i prefier POP instead of ruin.
---
[This video by Tofu is good and only 3 minutes, gives you all you need to know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbSJm5U9i0)
---
That's a good point. Usually I only put one trap right in front of the hook, but tossing another 1-2 by less obvious escape routes might help the MYC proc. Thanks! I will try it out tonight.
---
definitely noticed timing is everything in this game lmao. I'll give this a try the next time I play. would really love to be able to save a teammate this way and maybe even by jumping out of a locker the killer is walking by.
---
Oh man I'm gonna let you Circle Jerkers have this make sure you slap each other's ass after high fiving
---
As silly as it is, its still fun to think about seriously. :)

'Cause you got that

Of course, then he'd be paid for it

Sometimes they’re easy to learn, you just need a bunch of perks/addons to not suck
---
That's literally what D strike is.
---
This happened to me as a killer. We had a staring standoff which lasted 1 hour until the connection somehow crashed. The important thing is that we had a great laugh after and we now are good friends
---
That’s my instagram but instagram = bad
---
Leatherface (for BBQ and Chili) and Halloween (for Decisive Strike, plus Michael Meyers is super fun)
---
Stack Surge with Pop, Ruin, Lullaby, or Overcharge, and this game is gonna slow down more than just a little bit
---
Feels bad when your on red ranks and no one bothers looking for the noed.
---
Dude if u just started to play ur a rank 20 killer meaning ur going against rank 20 survivors they probably don't even know what there talking about
---
Post buff she was my first red rank killer, so I have a bit of a soft spot for Lisa.  What add ons do you normally use?  
---
I normally go with Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Monitor, and Make your Choice.  usually I can find people hearing by the sound effect but before I had make your choice unlocked I would use Nurse's Calling.  NC, M+ A and sloppy butcher sets you up very well to punish immersed self caring people and helps slow down the match a little more.  
---
My main gripe with hag is the lack of synergy with BBQ and Chili.  The BP bonus would be nice but the aura reading isn't that helpful with her kit.
---
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD FIX THE GODDAMN GLITCH THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM ESCAPING
---
Ah ok thank you I didn't know it was I knew someone would
---
The fact that I didn't know you could use MoM as much as you want provided you get enough stacks doesn't mean the perk doesn't work that way (it's more so I'm asking for proof that it can activate as much as you want, but hypothetically I'll say it is how it works) and even if it did work that way, while my experience doesn't mean it's the same experience everyone has had, the fact that I didn't even know it could activate more than once is important to note- because it means it wasn't as common as you're making it seem.
---
How do you not know if someone has borrowed time? A lot of times, you can tell what theyre running by the way they play, and unless they body block you which would make it obvious that they have bt applied to them, you can most likely avoid them. At high ranks, you just assume that they have bt if they're unhooking next to you, so either way 10 seconds before hitting them, or ignore the unhooked. Ideally yeah it would be good to hit the unhooker twice then go for the already injured to slug, but even if it doesn't go that way, you still managed to get someone on the hook (provided you hit the unhooker twice) if the one already injured who just got unhooked does have bt applied, which is still a win for the killer in that sense. 
---
MoM was a good perk, and that's it. It hurt non-instahit killers a bit more, but you always assume the survs are running the strongest perks till proven otherwise, as a killer, you should be prepared for that threat, and you should know what to do when that threat occurs. 
---
And bt should activate first, logically speaking. Again, it's pretty easy to just not target the unhooked survivor
---
Ah the infamous "low rank players commenting about red rank issues". Love it.
---
True, I will, however, use it whenever I have an offering for the new map, have to take advantage of the fact that people won't know the totem spawns yet
---
play spirit, so because you are the killer you wont disconnect . then watch as the survivors realise you are the spirit then they'll start disconnecting.
---
Bad killer as in skill wise or bad killer as in not a good power killer? Because I handled MoM pretty well, as a non meta killer.
---
Anyone else here a myers main...... 0.0
---
I once was on discord playing with a SWF of low rank people. The Killer dominated us and kept hooking literally all of us.
---
The girl of our group was killed third. At the end she complained to the killer she got "tunneled". It was hilarious lol
---
I usually watch AngryPug on twitch
---
I've seen waaaaaaaay worse but yeah 12 shouldn't have been there playing solo survivor I was rank 5 the killer and my teamates were rank like 16-20 and I got chased FOR AN ETERNITY and not a single gen touched worst teamates ever that was a hatch game
---
I’ve only went against him like 3 times. I always go against Freddy, Huntress, and Myers
---
Anyone know if Babysitter will show the location of Freddy and Wraith while cloaked?
---
that combination is great. but annoying af
---
People actually see this perk as a problem? I’m just half and half expecting most killers to run it and do the bones I come across anyways.
---
His game design appears to have borrowed heavily from the later sequels in the Hellraiser series.  There is a Cenobite that looks exactly like him facially I want to say around the 6th entry mark or so.
---
Ahhh shit another Pig nerf mother fuckers WOOH WHOOOO YAY we totally wanted this and not a buff but seriously BHVR are you stupid everyone was mad about the Pig nerfs and said we wanted more buffs for her
---
Exactly, a lot of survivors just seem really salty as if theyre owed not being killed
---
MoM did not kill killer variety in high ranks. Killer variety in high ranks has been pretty consistent for a lot of the games life (consistent meaning that at high rank, you see meta killers like nurse and Billy and etc way more). You could say it may have discouraged some variety, but MoM alone did not kill variety. That's more of a problem with game mechanics as a whole.
---
Yeah its hilarious seeing them get mad
---
A: I never said, or implied, that you needed to get good
---
B: I don’t care nearly enough to watch watch your Youtube clips
---
C:  Plag is a solid mid-tier killer, she doesn’t need a buff
---
iron maiden is substantially better. it makes some sense on huntress at least.
---
get leatherface for barbecue and chilli, the spark of madness for the monitor and abuse perk, of flesh and mud for ruin, and then get shattered bloodline for the killer called: the spirit. btw you dont have to buy the shattered bloodline chapter, you can just buy the killer and survivor with earnable in game currency.
---
Dwight: Hey meg, i'm injured, please help
---
Meg: OMG dwight what happened. You walked in a trap?
---
Dwight: No
---
Meg: The Killer slashed you?
---
Meg: well you fell down...?
---
Meg: Wtf happened???
---
Dwight: I peed myself
---
End game collapse is not a vailed reason the trap goes off faster then the end game timer SO IT LITERALLY DOESN’T EFFECT ANYTHING
---
I mean, is that not the same thing? Players play sides. Hence, sides are also applied.
---
I don't think anyone has ever looked at a killer and based their effectiveness on if they countered old MoM.
---
Too real
---
Proceeds to eat face of survivor.
---
Adorable aren't they? Please say you weren't stalking
---
there’s no way to rework monsterous shrine to keep the original flavor without it being either despicable or garbage. just delete the perk, it’s not even a teachable.
---
tbh Jake needs way better cosmetics. All of them feel practically the same. People meme about Meg being into sports but bro... did you know that Jake... *likes the outdoors?* Seriously excluding his Ultra Rares basically all of his outfits are a variation of "outdoors clothes."
---
Simple.  Iron will plus No-Mithered completely cancels out Strider.
---
As someone explained it here once (paraphrased):
---
If you run Iron Will, you don't just make yourself quiet.  It's as though you turn the internal volume of your survivor down to zero.  So from 100 to 0.  
---
Strider increases noise by fifty.  So from 0 to 50.  
---
No-Mither decreases the noise by fifty.  So from 50 to 0.
---
As a bonus, No-Mither counters Spirit's glasses add-on as well.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Underated perk for swf imo
---
It appears to depend on how they disconnect. If they leave the match through the menu it seems like you keep your earned points. If they pull the plug, I've seen zeros across the board.
---
They show him no mercy it's sad
---
ok. i thought u were the other guy because was the same threath.
---
and the clips shows how i run throw loops and jungle gyms. 
---
plague is a solid low mid tier killer withouth a doubt, u get gen rushed so hard with her.

I find it hilarious when I solo queue, join in at the same time as others, and the killer dodges thinking we're a SWF

I'd prioritize sloppy butcher over nurse's.  I usually track them more with my ears than my eyes assuming they had enough distance and time to being healing.

---
Rank doesn't really matter tbh, there's no rewards whatsoever and it just becomes more stressful, so I think people tend to stay at rank 7-12 because that's usually the rank where they're less sweaty less campy and more casual. (That's what I heard and experienced, don't quote me on that if I get it wrong :d)  
---
Well yeah, I think it's the matchmaking system's fault here because usually if it's just you and your friend you should get at least a purple rank or a green rank killer. I don't know if the 2 randoms are SWF or not but usually SWF will end up having a lower rank killer, if there's a green, red and yellow, it would be somewhere in between green and yellow. Kinda feels bad for the killer though, the killer would have really less BP if they kill everyone too fast cause apparently that's how the scoring system works right now for the killers. Also it's not like they wanted to get a low rank lobby.  
---
but oh boi I hope the community gets less toxic and help the new players when the Stranger Things chapter comes out. I really need more people to join this community, I always get queued with the same few people.
---
Yea, I dont tunnel either so DS doesnt normally affect me, but endgame if theres 2 people, trading when both have ds and getting escaped on for free can feel rage inducing. Still, I wouldn't really consider it a crutch perk unlike before.
---
They whould make it where you can press a key and if hes in your field of view it starts the reveal, but if you press it and he's not you get a penalty
---
Well tunneling is also doing objective from killer's part. I mean he's killer and he's going for that kill, makes sense.
---
Not through the wall
---
Nea and Claudette: The Chum Bucket
---
Wet noodle gang.
---
What
---
Considering i mained an m1 killer the whole time MoM was a good perk, yeah, no I don't think it would be that much of a deal breaker for anyone.
---
If you were an m1 killer, youd hit someone, realize they have MoM after tanking a hit, and adjust accordingly. Either you know you can down them so you might as well continue pursuing, or you leave them be, they heal or 99% their health, you get aura reading and continue from there. While MoM definitely was a game changer the moments the exit gates were powered/open, you usually were able to take away their MoM by the time that happens. The survivors who were able to use mettle of man effectively were also the survivors who really didn't need MoM in my experience.
---
Mettle of Man hurt killer diversity at high ranks a bit, but no, it didn't single handedly destroy killer diversity at high ranks. People by default played high rank meta killers at the time of MoM anyway, I don't think there's a plausible way to claim MoM severely effected who plays what at that rank.
---
We do not need perks that get completely shit on bad killers with no counterplay and are useless againsts best killers. MoM might not have been the most op perk ever but it certainly was the worst designed. It will not be missed
---
Yeah but you might leave in the direction the killer’s coming. That’s the whole point of the difference
---
yeah, i thought The King had a ptb date because of how he worded the title, but he lied and said he didnt actually know when the ptb was coming out.
---
This makes me feel better about me being devot 5 :3
---
I'll let the last one have hatch if they don't struggle.
---
While I like the idea to deal with the issue of ruin being a necessity, the fact that it's a bathroom is too comedic lmao
---
Is your username Hex: Devour Hope by any chance?
---
I’m kicking myself for not picking up BBQ last week... dumb dumb dumb
---
If you were good enough with the killer you were playing, MoM was usually fine apart from the few times where the exit gates were open and they were able to tank a hit. I know this because I mained an m1 killer, one of the weakest ones (according to the community) at the time
---
I don't think I'm hot shit. It's just annoying when low rank players disagree with something that isn't even their topic of discussion.
---
It's the same when Rank 20 players say Nurse is the worst killer. Of course it is.. every Nurse you play against sucks..
---
I like how Laurie looks actually
---
There's a lot of channels doing that right now and it's really annoying
---
At this point im just reloading leaksbydaylight over and over until i see something
---
Hag is a rough one to play in general against survivors who know what they're doing. She's a touch slower than your average killer, her height can make it harder to spot survivors, and if survivors are good enough at not triggering her traps, she becomes a nearly useless M1 killer.
---
You have to play her similar to the Trapper, by placing traps where survivors won't expect them. In purple/red ranks, survivors are going to expect traps by hooks and generators, and will crouch past to avoid them. Try to get good at setting up at choke points (doorways, in the middle of jungle gyms, between fences on Haddonfield/Badham, and so on), and points that are kind of out in the open which give you great opportunties to start chasing survivors right away. Also try not to place traps in the same places throughout the entire match.
---
For perks, you're going to want gen pressure, chasing perks, and a detection perk - gen pressure is usually covered by Ruin, but I personally prefer Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, Pop Goes The Weasel, or Overcharge. You could also use Sloppy Butcher if you're expecting to have to constantly switch targets in a chase. For chasing perks, one of my favourites is Save The Best For Last, but you could also use Spirit Fury, Enduring, Brutal Strength, Unrelenting, and so on. A personal favourite is Devour Hope, since it (hopefully) doesn't disappear until you get at least one Exposed hit, and it serves as a nice time-wasting secondary objective for survivors in the midgame. For a detection perk, BBQ&amp;Chili is usually the best go-to, but you could also try Bitter Murmur, Rancor (which doubles as a nice poor man's NOED), Thrill Tremors (again), or Discordance.
---
For addons, you might just want to grind a bunch of bloodpoints with survivor, and poor them all into Hag so you can constantly use the nice ones. Addons that increase her teleport range are probably my favourite, coupled either with addons that increase her placement speed (so you can sometimes set traps in a chase to close loops) or addons that highlight the aura of survivors that trigger traps (I often get disoriented when I teleport, and seeing the aura helps me zero in on a target immediately, before I'm able to get my bearings). The addon that makes her traps invisible is probably the best one, and should be paired with a Black Ward when you can.
---
You'll usually want to run a green or red Mori offering when you can. If you only have a green one, you can probably replace one of your gen pressure perks with Dying Light, and Mori your obsession when you get the chance
---
Edit: Don't forget that there's a weekly No Stupid Questions thread on this sub, to limit the amount of question posts in the New feed. It can be hard to find sometimes, since mods only seem to pin it for like a day, but a simple search should bring it up &lt;3

I often have a lot of problems with Myers players. 1/3 times they’re toxic in terms of their playstyle. I don’t really have issues with anyone else except I have 0 idea on how to counter Freddy’s dream pallets. The most I could do is throw them down early chase to see if they’re real, but at the same time that’s a waste.
---
Mama Murphy from fo4
---
It’s a trace of wolverine so...
---
Ruin is great but I’ve found it’s not good to stack with some other hex totem abilities. People will search out your hex’s as soon as they find you are running Ruin. I used to run Huntress with Ruin, Lullaby, Thrill, and something else. Decent survivors will kill my lullaby looking for Ruin.
---
Lol true xD
---
I'm sure BHVR can find a similar idea that makes a bit more sense.
---
That being said i think someone getting attacked during a bathroom break is an horror movie classic ;)
---
Ye. If I get a 4 man. My goal is basement and play from there. You can guarantee too chain it with very little effort.
---
Oh lol not angry. Actually loop please, if I see some survivor just run drop a pallet that really pisses me off as a killer because, A the survivor just wasted a pallet. And screws his/her team over making them easier to push to a certain area and just kill em
---
or baldi
---
How do you suppose they fix lack of players in Aussie? Connect them to America so everyone lags out?
---
Hell yes!
---
never thought id see toontown on dbd. yes
---
I mean I still did fine, but it was needlessly difficult considering survivors did LITERALLY nothing other than get to hit get it.
---
Yeah, they will get sued and lose a shit ton of money you moron.
---
Also, this isn't your content anyways. All you did was add a shitty meme on top of someone else's work.
---
Quit being a fucking idiot and realize why they cant do what you request every other month.
---
Absolutely beatiful!
---
Idk man I run 0 exhaustion perk Claudette and it's fairly fun with SWF
---
Yeah
---
Killers are supposed to be stronger than a single survivor
---
It should be 
---
18% faster hook progression
---
-15% unhook chance (additive)
---
50/75/100% more bloodpoints for action done in the basement
---
Luckily, they're working on fixing that. In the next major patch, bloodwebs will be spawning more perks past level 40, allowing you to get two per web, almost halving the grind to unlocking every perk on every character.
---
As a feng main I can proudly say I don’t own Dstrike.
---
What happened to this sub
---
I'm sure a killer is downvoting.
---
It’s closer to the most unfair way to lose, because if survivors aren’t retarted you won’t have time to catch anyone else
---
Once I saw Hex: drill of the cunt

You're looking way too into it.

No

The difference between a perk that only works well on one killer and a perk that sees no play ever is substantial. Iron maiden is a perk that isn't commonly seen, but is actually seen in game on occasion, and has an impact on the game experience when its ran. You're right that on other killers the scream reveal and expose effect on exiting a locker isn't very significant, but in the situation its ran on huntress it can have a fairly large impact in the huntress getting more hatchets to get a down faster (particularly with iridescent) plus the usual effect of the scream potentially revealing the location of a survivor if someone say, tries to hide from bbq. Monstrous isn't even noticeable in any of the games its ran, and has never been ran on any killer seriously ever, often not even seeing play in the exact basement meme builds its supposed to support because its just that irrelevant. The difference is substantial because a perk seeing rare play (like iron maiden) is situational and not always impactful, but still grants a unique effect and bonus that would be lost if the perk were to be removed. Contrarily, if monstrous shrine were removed the only effect on the game would be that killers could finish grinding their bloodwebs faster.
---
Oh yeah I was totally implying BHVR should just change his face without going through the proper channels 🙄 it’s not like it was a meme or something with a light tone to let people know I wasn’t 100% serious.
---
He kinda looks like Gilbert Godfrey now that I'm actually looking at him.
---
Happened to me too. It's dangerous to carry someone at timer's end.
---
Every killer gets a plushie of their survivor counter part and vise versa
---
ah, so its not so clear that they can be earned in game... tricky
---
If you don't mind grinding Iridescent Shards then you can buy Original Killers at 9000 each.
---
The Halloween Chapter, Nightmare On Elm Street, Saw Chapter, Ghost Face, and Leatherface Killers can only be obtained by buying the DLC (you get both the Survivor and Killer) or 500 Auric Cells for each Killer.
---
Don’t forget their ultra rare add on the entities mixtape

Take Spine Chill off then, at least for the conversations

I play mostly Jake and Jeff. I like Jake cosmetics because most of his clothes is what I would wear irl. I also love his long hair cosmetic.
---
Not gonna lie you had us in the first half
---
yeah I'd wanna see how it was after fixing protection hits. I've tried for many many many hours to use MoM, with some success here and there but what makes it so frustrating to use is that you never know if your protection hit is even going to count
---
It used to work on both
---
Doc has better overall perks, so him

I can’t wait to get this kind of help 😂 please everyone post your guides

Also devour hope is my favorite when it works. Which is about once a week.

But I can't live without it
---
Killers be like *face camping is a legitimate strategy against the overpowered survivors*
---
Survivors while exposed and susceptible to 1 hits and insta deaths *click*
---
Killers "what a scum oh Imma salt trash champion now what a douche he helped his teammate god get gud, killer so weak can't even just press a button and kill all 4 at once why nooooot"
---
Amongst all the famous lines from Loomis in the original Halloween, none compare to “oh shit, he found a gun”.
---
RISE UP FELLOW JAKE MAINS!!!!
---
i suggest you look at the percentages for the perk and how did the winratio for the survivors went up after mom before saying it wasnt op
---
Your arguments lack merit and are clearly survivor sided
---
"Oh ho! You're coming straight at me! Instead of running away, you're coming straight towards me!"
---
"I can't stop the timer unless I initiate a chase."
---
That's awesome
---
Honestly I prefer the plaid shirt over the pine cone but it’s stupid rare so I don’t usually use it.
---
Camping isn't viable because once you get out of potato ranks you will depip even if you somehow stumble onto a 4K camping.  Even if you get kills you still lose lol.  The devs designed it like that for a reason.  They're telling you how you get your kills is supposed to matter.
---
King'd.
---
That’s my dream lol. Also what I’m trying to currently do. I only have Nea, Claudette, Feng and Ace to lvl 50.
---
Every time dude
---
pfff yeah, she glows in the dark like a lamp
---
ace pilot tho - stealth, practical,f2p perfect in every way
---
Then there's leatherface who isn't bad, not nearly as bad as Freddy was, but is so much less impressive than Billy who is bhvr's version of leatherface in all things except face camping
---
Why do you think she comes with Nurse's calling?
---
Then there would be literally no counter other than to eat it. Each time the killer leaves you on the ground you get to waste the killers time the next time he downs you and puts you on second hook. Your decisive strike is still able to be used
---
...ensue?
---
Hey, that is really sexist of you, men are not all almost worthless.
---
&gt;!:P!&lt;
---
This another no skill no care asshole was born...
---
Ready to ruin the game and force up to 5 people to derank every game.
---
I point and say "go away" out loud (though y'all can't hear me) so I'm really not sure how it's dickish. I'm just telling you to go away
---
Ability: fucking invisibility
---
Especially in that situation it makes perfect sense to go for the one who got saved.  Getting 3 kills is better than getting 2.
---
Some people on both sides think their the best thing since sliced bread when in reality they are the worse things about this community it’s okay to to be proud plus some of the things you listed are kind of important to do as a plague I might not of spit on the guy cause he was easier to smack do me doing the puke on em is so if somebody gets em off I knows who and same with clown if I goes off to the direction of a generator I throw the bottle at em so when someone does go into the area I’ll know or traps or etc
---
Plague needs something minor to encourage people to cleanse, but killing them would be outrageously broken. Infinite Pig RBTs, and you could get into a situation where all but one fountain was used. Prevent cleansing there and you ensure deaths, this is unbalanced as hell, coming from a Plague main.
---
An action or movement speed decrease, or maybe deafness if sick over a certain period of time would be much better, and much more fair.
---
It's not "toxic," to flashlight save, even if it's repetitive, but as a survivor if the killer begins to slug after being blinded so much they shouldn't get upset over it.
---
Honestly the only TRUE counter is to not be asleep. But obviously they are pretty strong since you simply cannot be awake all game. 
---
Other than that I would say try to loop around windows or structures in some way where pallets aren't as necessary
---
They’re being toxic as return fire to the survivors being toxic in the first place, and vice versa.
---
That’s why both sides think the other’s more toxic than them.
---
Lithe.
---
 Sometimes Balanced Landing doesn't work on maps, they either have no hills or no where high up. Lithe works on every map because there are pallets and windows on EVERY map
---
Camping is a bitch move. Let people have fun. If you can’t catch people without camping then you shouldn’t play killer. It’s why I don’t play killer. Only time I do that is with my friends where we don’t get bloodpoints and they know for a fact I’m gonna do it and are okay with it because it means it’s a round for us to goof off and try different perks and stuff. But for people actually trying to enjoy a game and have a killer sit there and camp because they have no skills to do anything else is lame and a sure fire way to piss everyone off.
---
But what about the ones who think their behavior isn't toxic and the other isn't?
---
Given [the upcoming changes undetectable](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/82749/designer-notes-new-status-effects-and-bloodweb-changes) Wraith shouldn't be, not sure about Freddy as I'm not familiar with how his stuff works.

How dare YOU!

Yeah like maybe your character does a call out of some kind of you mess it up, like they gasp at nothing and it gives an audio que like messing up a skill check or fast vaulting. One issue this might have is it could ruin the element of surprise so people know they should be looking for a ghost face if they see the prompt
---
Again?
---
this perk has freedom written all over it
---
You’re meant to use the pallets... It’s more of a waste if you just never use them.
---
Stalk me daddy
---
Have a feeling they’re putting great perks in the shrine so people will spend money instead of shards on the new killers/survivors.
---
I mean, who isn’t gonna pick up the pebble?
---
I did and I absolutely do not regret it
---
Ive never sent a message after a match where we won. Hook camping is the only trash play I can't stand. Stops everyone from getting points to rank up. Killer hooks 2 or 3 times and face sits his kills, gets less points than hooking 12 times and making an enjoyable match where everyone gets to play the game. Meanwhile hook man 1 gets insta deranked because of sheer bad luck and a bad killer.
---
No yeah no duh use the pallets but get some use out of them.
---
To be fair though, a "free chase" really is not all that good. Freddy can get a free chase basically every single time he uses his (teleport) power. But it's still not OP or even incredibly powerful or annoying. A free chase where the survivor has a 3-5 second headstart is often a chase not even worth the killers time.
---
That is of course defendant on their map position, where the dead zones are, and how strong of a looper the survivor is, but all of that is outside the killers control anyway.
---
Although it is viable if you as the killer see a survivor running straight to the hook. I'll take the guaranteed down if someone tries to get close to the hook before I leave. Call that camping if you will, that's what most survivors do
---
There is a difference between game being challenging and being fucked in the ass by getting matched up against better players.
---
I know this is sort of redundant but spine chill + premonition together worked really well for me as a stealthy new player and neither are teachables so you dont have to unlock anything to use them
---
Apologies, I have a tendency to ninjedit my comments as I come up with editions to them, you responded very quickly, you probably missed my explanation to that one.
---
For me it’s always the useless one
---
Interestingly enough, I asked myself of DD would even work on the old Freddy right before his rework came out. If he put his TR on the person he hit then would his lullaby also go with them?
---
Salt and bp go great together
---
I made a frank mask and vision isn’t actually that bad what’s hard is breathing after running for a bit in it.
---
Only a few more weeks till servers then they will have a system in place for that kind of Tom foolery
---
yeah i get that, and it looks great in comparison, i think its just more of a preference thing for me.
---
I mean... it is. unless you are just incredibly selfish and think "if I take him out of NS he will come after me and I dont wanna die, sorry other survivors" but it stops him from stalking to get 1 hit kills and stops him from sneaking up on people by having no TR
---
If you go and look in the Mirror with a lit candle and say GhostFace, GhostFace, GhostFace 3 times in a row you will be able to see Myers Standing begins you...
---
I might be wrong but Im pretty sure the devs changed DS to stop killers from tunnelling so pausing the timer while on the ground just makes sense to me
---
)))) Lol. You deserve an upvote)
---
how come everyone calls swf op? like killers love to point out how it's 4v1 and all that shit, but as soon as survivors buddy up(allowing them to actually take advantage of their numbers rather than just being picked off which is exactly what happens in solo que) it's SUPER OP AND NOT FAIR BHVR PLZ NERFFFFF
---
The group rank should be automatically the highest rank in the swf.
---
Yeah it is not to pick them up or leave them be. Depends on the situation which is the better move as the killer. Slowing the game down is everything for the killer. So no such thing as wasting time by slugging as a killer. It just adds a ton of pressure on the survivors
---
Damn, that's rough... I hope you've paid it off in good times at least
---
Instructions unclear, burned my foot in a toaster while bathing
---
Wait. Jane may be the first to die since she's a lesser celebrity. They have to kill her for the shock value. I place Feng as my final girl now
---
To me its valuable beyond just the hex itself, it alters how the survivors behave in the first part of the game. They scatter away from their starting areas more predictably, in my experience. It gets the survivors moving.  Plagues Corrupt Intervention does basically the same thing, but with a consistent result rather than the variance of totem placement.
---
Sad how true this is.. Killers got exposed and 1 hit kills and every advantage ever including hook camping but god forbid us survivors know each other and are in a party often talking about not the game. Get camped because were bullshittin after work smh...
---
when you use noed OMEGALUL
---
I will admit that slugging sucks when I play survivor but I can actually understand why it is necessary
---
Might actually turn it into a horror game
---
they did. it's now a totally fair and balanced(for the killer btw) "anti tunneling" perk (notice: will not work if the killer has any brain at all. like even 1 tiny brain will gurantee you never get ds'd)
---
The game is designed with idea of no communication or co ordination  hence why you cant really talk or lead a group of survivors using only in game mechanics
---
Fair enough. I guess it's used in a completely different way than PGTW when you put it like that.
---
I just like pop to slow down the game becuase it's so consistent.
---
Oh well did Freddy pull you under then? Heard that’s how you get him. 
---
But make sure you have the lit candle and a clean mirror, if there is a toaster involved it’s not gonna work!
---
lulw

Also when I said it wastes the killers time is that that person will not be on the hook. Which is always what the killer should be trying to do

Fucking hell he's moonwalking, that's terrifying

The stranger things characters are going to be licensed aren't they? So you wouldn't be able to get them with shards anyway.

---
This. Ruin really messes with your ability to run any other hex effectively (besides Haunted Grounds). If you want to run Devour Hope, Lullaby, or similar, you basically cant also run Ruin. Not only will the totems break quicker, but by running multiple you increase the value of time spent looking for totems in the first place.
---
Voice chat?no in game chat? no able to see other survivors without use of perks? no
---
All killers can technically moonwalk. Though Myers does it best
---
69x better
---
All of them can, it’s just walking backwards to hide the red glow.
---
I agree
---
For one reason or another, they can't do it, and you've already said you refuse to acknowledge that fact. Just letting you know posting this shit every month isn't gonna make it happen.

Doctor with Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving, and a fourth perk (Maybe Dying Light with a mori) and watch survivors all DC.

well, now you're stereotyped as not existing, gottem
---
I literally had a game yesterday where a default Meg missed a skill check on a gen we were both working on, then sprint bursted away. I can’t believe there’s still people like that at rank 9.
---
It is more of an example of perk being nerfed to the ground because the community made it look OP, and it kinda was for a very, very long time.
---
Killers see a party streamers, instantly face camp to make everyone involved get as few points as possible...
---
I know this is a pretty big stretch, especially the franklin's, but I wanted to try
---
We definitely need a more CSGO style matchmaking, you only lose rank through in activity or losing a lot, that way newer survivors would actually learn rather than being destroyed within 2 minutes of a match and not wanting to play again. Fuck rank reset
---
REEEEEE
---
Do you mean where you load into a game and the game ends instantly? If so you don't lose addons or offerings
---
I see where you are coming from, I really do. But really, not twisting what you said so, assuming the killer have aura reading abilities, so you have to change the survivor whole playstyle from stealthy to aggressive looper, which, maybe this guy isn't? Isn't the same thing you are telling about a stealthy killer against an agressive guy with OoO having to change playstyle and stuff?
---
I'm sorry but I still think it's a skill based perk and totally fair UNLESS someone is SWF, which doesn't make the perk broken, but makes the whole SWF thing broken because comms. Because you can actually ignore this person and it's not mandatory to go and chase them, which tbh if the person is really good I'll never waste my killer time going after her. Because you know how those gens go quick these days.
---
 And actually I'm a bit salty myself so sorry the bias, because i put so much time learning to play around with this one xD  I am no programmer and stuff but why not give an add-on or perk to negate aura reading, like Distortion to killers, just like Lightborn instead of making yet another survivor perk useless? In my mind it should just go fair for both sides. Either that or completely rework the perk and don't do it like the shitty MoM rework, which was REALLY needed specially against my Trapper, but no, that was more like a hotfix than an actual rework. 
---
I really avoid commenting my thoughts in forums because i'm always afraid of ugly replies so just wanna say here I'm really enjoying that discussion with you.
---
Have a good day!
---
that or you get the rare 4 man DC and hilariously ridiculous toxicity in the post game chat
---
Missing fire up, not strong enough
---
Oh no survivors have a decent perk? Now its harder to hook once and camp like an ass. Meanwhile killers with constant expose and 1 hit kills and teleports... 
---
*damn those op survivors*
---
Killers act like survivors are the toxic ones...
---
Wait... is this...
---
I just wish there could be a way that matchmaking was determined by perk loadout instead of the virtually worthless rank. This idea came to me because I'm a level 10 (or somewhere in there) and I was messing around with a perkless David King for a daily.
---
You're assuming they're bm'ing in return and that survivors did it first.  That sounds pretty biased.  There are plenty of toxic asshats who BM unprovoked on both sides.  Can't we just say that instead of having to always flip it to the other side?
---
But seriously, can it just not match people of the same rank, or at least around it. How can the game expect me to play decently against a rank 2 nurse, more than 10 ranks higher than me
---
But I'm pretty sur those are just landings. I don't really know because they only talked about 2 floors iirc.
---
Glad to hear you're enjoying yourself, having these discussions with others is nice. Especially when balance typically isn't mentioned a lot with my friends.
---
Again, back to my earlier point, with Killer aura reading perks you can change your play-style mid-match. You have other options at your disposal as Survivor, again if you go down it's purely your own fault unless it's Nurse or Spirit. Not being versed in looping AND stealth is your fault, not the mechanic's. But on the Killer side with OoO against Ghostface and Wraith, they don't have an alternate play-style they can do. Stealth IS their play-style and they can't do anything else besides Ghostface hiding his red stain in chase with his power, but even then if he doesn't immediately catch them he gets fucked by using his only tool as his disposal. OoO is strong enough being able to see when the Killer is on his way to you ahead of time and being able to see when to work on gens, it doesn't need to also be able to kill any mid chase Pig/Ghostface mind games too. They're making stealth Killers undetectable instead of a OoO rework or a perk for it so this isn't an issue in the future and so it's not a band-aid fix for a giant ass issue. They don't want to create more perks like BBQ, Ruin, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, and DS where you pretty much HAVE to have them or you're fucked. It also makes the Killers more appealing and easier to understand to newer players and makes license holders happy to not see their character being downplayed all over the place.
---
what that is crazy !
---
Are we entering an infinetly stacking shitpost ? Its been a while since i saw one of those
---
I get wat ur saying cause u have 2 play who u vs, but maybe instead of thinking about it as u killing survivors it's more stalling 4 time n keeping them off gens. No matter how long the game is if no gens r getting done ur winning.  Cause when ur camping that 1 hooked survivor 3 survivors could be doing gens.  Even if u leave n they get unhooked right away if u find somebody else that was on a gen that's 3 ppl not doing gens now. 2 healing 1 ur chasing. I play both n i think it's unfair 2 camp n tunnel them cause at the end of the day it's just a game that we all got 2 play n have fun with. U doing that is ruining the game 4 every1 n thats wat makes more toxic survivors.  Also its more effective 2 go 4 the person who unhooked the survivor so u will have more injured survivors n either more ppl healing n off gens or their 1 hit win win
---
To be honest, if people didn't derank then new players could have the low ranks to learn how to play and work on making a build before getting tossed to the dogs.
---
But so many people got the idea of "rank is meaningless" that they went and made a self fulfilling prophecy. Taking a ranking system that should have been a gate to keep players around their skill level or at least make a safe space for new players, and turning it into a shitshow more or less. One where low ranks are filled with tons of p3 fully teachable perk loadout players (both sides) going against people that maybe have a couple of tier 3 perks at best. Not fun nor fair. At all.
---
The only reason I know this is Im in low ranks again myself becuase I stopped playing for several months and rank reset forced me down. I don't belong in low ranks, not a great Killer but good enough to know my place isn't in low ranks. Plus Id like to think Im good enough to spot others who don't belong as well. There's a lot.
---
Yes but you still brought Ebony Feral Frenzy
---
Noob3 and not Otzvarda boutta get on this
---
Yes but it'd be $5 per character not worth it at all when buying the 3 pack will be 10-12.
---
Lmaoo
---
hardcore mode
---
I agree. I'd like to see more drastically different killers. Plague is very original, but Legion and Ghostface are both M1 knife-guys with a bit of extra flair. I like a varied gameplay experience when I play survivor, and you dont get that with a lot of redundant killers.
---
Everyone mains Quentin in an other dimension
---
try posting on the forms and not here, the devs look there way more often
---
I'd use I'm All Ears instead of Whispers, but maybe I'm just weird.
---
The reason people say Spirit is because she has some of the best perks (I just unlocked Spirit specifically so I could go for Spirit Fury), and she's a high mobility killer, something that Doc and Legion kinda suffer in
---
Between the two, Doc is the better killer. He's great for 3-genning survivors, his power has a lot of different effects, each of which can really trip up survivors that are low-mid tier, and he gets a lot of bloodpoints usually. Legion is kinda neat, but their power has a lot of drawbacks, and is very much a 1-trick pony
---
As far as perks go, they're both pretty good. Doctor has Overcharge (which is great gen pressure/map knowledge against low-mid tier survivors) and Monitor &amp; Abuse (which is perfect for stealth-based killers like The Shape and The Ghost Face), while Legion has Iron Maiden (beyond the aura/exposed effect, it's also great for searching lockers, which makes it great for Doctor and Huntress) and Discordance (perfect to counter gen rush)
---
And here I am getting revealed by survivors from the opposite end of the map somehow
---
Killer variety...90 percent of killers right now are ghost face and Michael...oh god the variety. If they dont have a 1 hit kill or zero terror radius nobody uses them
---
So which one do you think?
---
It would make it so much more immersive
---
As a Dead by Daylight main, i can confirm this
---
Camping isn't so vague if you're looking at the hook with no intentions of pressuring gens or initiating a chase with another survivor you're basically camping.  You're just playing to defend a kill instead of doing the things optimal killers do to win games.  Too many new or weak players fall into the trap of obsessing about the survivor they already have on the hook instead of playing to put their next survivor on the hook.  Good killers slow games down by playing aggressively, pressuring gens, and constantly keeping them having to perform altruism while you're already midchase on your next down.  Playing this way is how you'll defeat good teams while earning more bloodpoints and actually ranking up lol.
---
The guy on hanging lost a hook state, so not so great.
---
U don't play enough survivor to know it sucks to be the target.
---
it'd be better if it said "welcome the salt fields motherfucker"
---
Sounds way too complex for an asymmetric horror party game.
---
Survivor calling me toxic for tunneling 
---
Me just wanting to hit the injured guy
---
That's only when u know the person irl. Coming from a stranger that's toxic asf
---
Flashlight saves are extremely risky against good killers and are in no way toxic, even with crazy flashlights.
---
I win a lot of games from failed flashlight saves
---
I've switched over to Spine Chill about a week ago, I think I'm doing better with it.
---
When the fuck did I say swf op or against it ?? I play solo I and always use fucking bond idk why u r assuming I'm a killer main
---
They need to learn to watch their surroundings. Fool me once blah blah blah
---
That killer was an asshole, you were just doing your job
---
This community killed Legion
---
I'd love to play all of your spirit games if you played all my nurse games. Swapsies?
---
Or worse, the pallets he used are now dream pallets and you keep having to much confidence they are real. I also love playing Freddy now
---
i understand there's people who abuse the ranking system to bully low rank killers but I have a lot of friends that have started playing in preparation for the ST chapter. I'm rank 1 so I think they would be absolutely miserable if it worked this way and we went against rank 1s
---
It is not
---
Or, better idea, only allow parties in private matches and make regular matches solo only
---
Alright? Then you'll never understand why it won't happen and you'll just continue posting shit memes, I guess.
---
Nah it's not toxic. If I get the 4man flashlight team I know I'm going to have a good game. There's a lot you can do to avoid/bait flashlights, and the most it should happen to you is once a game, twice of they're real sneaky.
---
As you said it's easier to slug them this way
---
Still not very efficient if you're off killing people lol
---
Ah yes my favourite fantasy porn source, Dungeons and Dragons gone wild
---
Nurse main here, used to run it. Don't need it anymore, i know spawns on most maps and can predict survivor movement well enough to know where they are most of the time :) Also survivors can be heard really *really* easily, even crouch walking makes a sound + breathing (with headphones obviously).
---
"Being earned in game" isn't as great as it sounds it takes a lot of play time to unlock original characters with the currency it takes to do so. You can also spend said currency on cosmetics or perks so buying the characters with money is the best option.
---
You just posted this

---
I'd rather play vs. marth88s nurse or tru3 or zubat or whatevers nurse than vs. one single spirit.
---
The reason is that i just don't enjoy my time vs. spirits. Also godly nurses just fuck you real quick instead of having a long stretch of bs.
---
Same with me, except I’m the Nurse. Haven’t even gotten her teachable yet, and I love her so much.
---
no, nor does huntress, i don't get this bubble thing they are talking about, the video is just a bug
---
If you dont have a headset get ruin. If you do have a headset get spirit and just get ruin through hag. It'll be easy because you just cant lose a chase with spirit.
---
I love noob3 but lets be honest he wouldnt make a very good guide. It’d consist of him saying “uh uh uh” “yiiiiiiiiiiKES!!!” and calling things cunts.
---
I said DS was the worst perk? I said after rework is absolute shit because enduring made it 0.75 second stun, new DS and the nerf to enduring makes it balanced.
---
I always juggle fuck yo decisive strike
---
i know its a joke but...
---
That is honestly the price you just have to pay.  
---
But let's take CSGO for example. You cannot queue together with your friends if your rank difference is too big. Which I think was a reasonable decision made by the devs.
---
I think this game needs a casual mode where anyone could play with or against anyone without caring about ranks (or have the mmr hidden)
---
You *are* ranting tho. Just own it, man.
---
1 hour queues?  Really?  You'd be play with that as a video game experience?
---
"The new killer could be good or bad, but it will all depend on whether its power is good or bad."
---
Not unless you recorded it yourself
---
This. This. This.
---
No I meant sew. I guess I could have said unfold or something.
---
There is suppose to be a reworked ranking system with the next chapter from what the devs have stated, but now we are on cruise control until the next chapter since they haven’t even posted anything about a PTB, they must be having problems, since this next chapter is rolling out with allot of shit like dedicated servers, strangers things, staying in the same lobby as your friends, ect ect so we will see! 
---
I’m also calling it now that they won’t have dedicated servers up and running by end of summer like they keep stating they will be! Also PC having dedicated servers up and running by end of summer doesn’t count! It needs to be across all platforms up and running!
---
I consider it a really good alternative. Pop can be used for collateral damage on one gen, while Surge spreads that destruction out evenly.
---
Or if the killer/survivor is a streamer. Feelsbadman
---
Welp thats Canada for ya lmao
---
They might as well say "there will be a new killer and yes, it certainly is a killer"
---
Ruin wtf more wins
---
lol i actually really like that idea, its even better than mine.
---
As Killer its interesting how you gotta ignore the "mad" people ;)
---
Whispers will still benefit you. You can know spawns and survivor playstyle and still have survivors hide from you. Whispers is like sonar. Sure it helps you pin point survivors, but more importantly it immediately lets you know where survivors aren’t.
---
Not saying it’s mandatory, but IMO it’s the best tracking perk
---
I was 2 manning with a friend at rank 4 yesterday and we kept pulling rank 12-14 killers and survivors for some reason.  It felt really mean because several of them had no idea how to counter loops.
---
Impossible. NOED is the most unbalanced crutch in the history of gaming. It definitely doesn't fail to even go off 50% of the time beyond rank 9.
---
That is amusing timing lol, I'm sure the killer wasnt too thrilled about that.
---
Am I not allowed to be excited for both?
---
He was bad before because of exploits and no counter attack. Now he is weak because he is too slow to being able to hit more than one survivor without add-ons and after that he becomes a M1 killer without power. Also, his deep wound is not really a treat because it stops in the TR. In my case, after being hit, I always keep repairing until the dp bar is 5% so I don't lose time
---
That's why I bring blood warden and noed so many DC its funny
---
Doesnt need rebalancing, its fine as is, and sees constant use at mid-high ranks.
---
Stop DS is good now
---
Just get better at map pressure and you won't need to run 4 gen stalling perks.
---
You're essentially bringing it back to what it used to be. I prefer newer version. One change i'd like to see is make DS usable twice if tunneled twice, but also make it go off if Killer hooks someone else.
---
Tiny eye holes offer a lot more visibility than you might think. I made a mask with small eye holes and I can still see a considerable amount
---
Legion’s « legion is bad » thing comes from the dumb streamers who weren’t hapy with the deep wound status effect and all his abilities that said stuff like « iF yOu ThInK lEgIoN iS gOoD fOr ThE gAmE, yOu YoUrSeLf ArE bAd At ThE gAmE ». Legion is fun to play and play against for good and talented people but some are worse than others and blame legion for their bad luck and lack of skill. He was and still is good.
---
Oh, I relish in the salt. It's hilarious to see them come up with excuses for their bad plays.  
---
Most of the time I have the in-game chat disabled, because this game's community is, uh, full of real epic people, but sometimes I like to dip my feet in there just because I need some seasoning for my dinner.
---
In the original game he had no minigun and there were only two encounters with him holding a rocket launcher, most of the time he was punching and using tentacle.
---
Oh clearly this meant more to you than I originally thought. 
---
Apologies, I simply thought you were on the band wagon of rank 1 swf, who lost one round and began crying wolf.
---
I took a break from playing killer and started playing only survivor the past few day. Had 3 games so far against Pigs that only hook camp. I think I’m being poisoned into being a toxic survivor that claims tunnel/camping, but it really is crazy how that seems to be the only strat for green/yellow rank Pigs.
---
Lots of Miles and Coltrane.  Surprisingly Legion is a bunch of jazz heads who knew.
---
We all know “running slightly faster” is such an understatement. “Slightly faster” means the chase is extended for 20 seconds minimum.
---
Oh boi. You clipped yourself using a perk how it was intended to be used
---
Scratched mirror + Judith's tombstone
---
Agreed, and his perks are solid too

---
But I'm not I'm asking why they do this lol. I went into detail because ik how ppl on Reddit can be, if I didn't say I wasn't ranting ppl would say I was and just say I'm bitching and tell me to grow up, etc. Or just troll.
---
Yeah you missed his point on that one.  For a brief time reworked Decisive was utter garbage because they reduced the stun time and Enduring made it literally do nothing.  They'd recover before you took 5 steps.  The devs realized this and buffed rework decisives stun time while also adjusting Enduring to not affect Decisive.
---
I think twice it's too much
---
Looks like we failed...still like it though
---
Eeewww. Don't touch your eyes.
---
*and kill yourself
---
It was tested and proven far too easy. Believe me, it's a good thing that it doesn't work like WGLF.  
---
If the devs are ever going to change it, the best we're gonna get is a complete rework.
---
Been my loadout ever since MoM was nerfed.
---
All killers *i only face camp when blah blah blah blah.*
---
Gets in game *camps their fuckin dick off like seemingly all of them lately do.* 
---
Non-stop zero terror radius hook camp killers ftw
---
I mean the hit boxes on the hatchets are normally about the size of a small fridge, (please make a red neck skin where huntress yeets mini fridges as people) and it’s a bit wonky hitting hatchets point blank, I think the hatchet is spawning in past the survivor that close but I’m not sure.
---
Imagine quoting peanits unironically..
---
That's HIS opinion, the opinion of a fake mod and community manager who does nothing but throw some shit like this sometimes. That's it
---
My god ur so good at this game
---
I personally like to have Territorial Imperative much better than Huntress' Lullaby because of five reasons:
---
Currently I have only one slot on Huntress and if I lose it I won't have anything to back it up.
---
I like to hook people in the basement and then go kick gens, Territorial Imperative gives me a signal that there's a chance for more victims.
---
It can go off early when survivors loot the basement chest.
---
I struggle to find survivors early on and this helps me find at least one of them.
---
It gives what is most important in the game - information.
---
I like Lullaby too, but I feel this is better for me right now because it helps me with my weaknesses.
---
haha i also thought they could do an omni killer that does a bit of what they all do. after a blink, throw a bear trap that makes the killer invisible and downs you in one hit, etc
---
WTF i love this community now
---
Consider yourself lucky
---
Stephen King, from what I last heard, despises video games and thinks they're a waste of time. I know that back in the day, he said he'd have to be dead before any of his stuff was in a video game.
---
No word yet, so probably not.
---
Spirit is better than Billy btw
---
We still haven't seen the full map yet, so I'm interested in the ptb and when it comes out. That's what I'm most interested in right now so I'm still waiting and passing the time listening to speculations

There’s no limit to what ranks to which people can SWF 
---
If a SWF ranked 1,4,19, and 2 grouped up together the matchmaking system would probably rank them with a killer ranked 8-13
---
A good point. Actually, I do not intend to ruin anybody’s fun. I do not even play the game (my PC does not want to load it). But I do watch a lot of YouTube gameplays for over 3 years, know every update etc.
---
I have yet to face him yet
---
Though i'd wish i wouldn't
---
Destiny's Child was great.
---
Him and LF are both the bottom of the barrel right now. If you think he’s good, then by all means play him. But he’s certainly not good.
---
I meant that, sadly, I is the community getting what they wanted( 
---
They whined about it for years... It was nerfed... People whine again. Something among those lines
---
Lol!  Dude what rank are you making this comment from because GF and Myers are nowhere near the most commonly played killers as you rank up?
---
It's a no from me dawg
---
Well I guess you don't play enough if you don't know DS exists. And when I play survivor and I can keep killer busy meanwhile other survivors are doing gens,  what the hell is wrong with that? If he wants to waste time on tunneling me, go on. It's only punishing for us both but you don't know that because you don't play enough of killer.
---
 And they very much are
---
Even if his carreer dies he made enough money to survive for the rest of his life.
---
Maybe that's exactly what pisses him off so much.
---
Get ruin. It’s used at top tiers.
---
Personally, I like pebble because it’s funny, but it’s useless in comparison to ruin
---
Lmao, not even a week after the first one. OP hungers for fake Internet points.
---
Best cosplay ever
---
If the Killer doesn't tunnel its just useless as current version
---
If the Killer tunnels.. fuck him
---
Have you completed the tutorials from the main screen? You'll get a pretty heft load of bloodpoints from this you can use to gain a couple of levels if you haven't.
---
Nooow I understand a bit more your points. 
---
Still... didn't want one of my current favorite surv perks destroyed, specially 'cause since survs got nerfs after nerfs, this just add more salt to the wound. But I truly get your whole point here, very well observed. Take all my upvotes and thanks for the patience man
---
SURGE,POP,RUIN,VIGILANCE+Freddy I sense great power in gen protect.
---
He stuns himself for 4 seconds every single time he uses his already very weak power. Thanat is a garbage perk even on Legion. His power doesn't actually slow the game down since he waste so much time when he uses it. In short the "Legion is bad" thing comes from people who have played the game and know how it works.
---
Paging u/int3r4ct You’ve got some of if not the best guides on killers breaking down all the fine details and if anyone deserves praise in this community for helpfulness it’s you. 
---
I still am going to submit a Legion gameplay guide because they’re my main and I love them but I’d love to see you in this.
---
If you are asking which killer to play next, I suggest Freddy. There are plenty of videos that explains all of the killers on youtube. Tell me who you decide on!
---
Maybe they want you to get a hit in so you can get more points
---
I bought Legion first and don't regret it. He is tough to play as but fun. Discordance is a perk a lot of people like from him, but I haven't been using it at higher ranks since it seems less useful.  My next will either be Spirit for Haunted Ground or Plague for Corrupt Intervention/Infectious Fright. Clown for Pop Goes the Weasel and to a lesser extent Bamboozle wouldn't be a bad choice. It would depend on which perks you like, how you play and if you plan on using the killer you buy or just want the teachables. If you run Ruin or any Hexes a lot, I would say Haunted is a really good pair to it.
---
That's exactly what I felt when I cosplayed them
---
Since distressing increases deviousness, Hex Thrill / beast of prey increases hunter points, why not make this perk increase sacrifice points (in the basement) and maybe then brutal strength increases brutality points?
---
Since I've started they very much have been since 20 down to the 8 i currently am. Every time I have a few good games and pip, the punish matches start where I spawn next to bud and get cut, hooked, camped and deranked. Been a steady back and forth between 7 and 9.
---
So tired of Ruin.
---
Absolutely not
---
I didn’t
---
Nurses doesn’t show mending, and a lot of people don’t heal against legion. I would suggest taking off sloppy and putting on another gen perk
---
What does that even mean? “New archive, new rift”
---
"I like playing dbd" 
---
*loading gun* "Shame"
---
That’s gonna be a yikes from me dawg
---
I’m sure OP knows this. Lol they originally posted it...
---
That a weird way to spell Bing-Bong Boy
---
I am here my brother
---
diversion
---
I don't really care where a killer is as long as I can get information on what they're doing. Spine Chill gives much more reliable information. The killer's location is easy to tell by where they down/hook surviviors and also where generators are at. Lastly, being in a corner of the map eliminates two locations the killer will come from (unless the killer is trying to do some next level sneak which is impractical) and only works with stealth killers.
---
Premonition can go off but its information is not very discernable and it has a cool-down. You hear the terror radius and you position yourself to either prepare a chase or hide. But that premonition warning was just the killer going elsewhere or chasing someone else.
---
Spine Chill more uses, no cool-down, and the information is much more discernable. If Spine Chill lights up for like 2 seconds, you can tell a Killer is heading to your gen, which perks they have (Discordance, Nurse's Calling, etc) or tell you when they don't have those perks.
---
If it lights on and off for a while, it means the killer is chasing a survivor. Spine Chill tells you to avoid Nurse blinks if it stays lit up shortly after she finished a blink which you get audio cues telling she just fatigued. Spirit's mind games can be destroyed by Spine Chill allowing you to discern the husk as real or fake at some loop locations and also the Spirit's location. It also counters Prayer Beads and also allows you to fix generators in her terror radius without being grabbed by off.
---
Rip decent idea.  I wouldn't mind puzzles like the ones in Resident Evil, where you have top connect Point A with Point B.  It's easy, but still gotta look at it a bit
---
Honestly flashlights are so nerfed if you’re letting survivors get multiple flashlight saves in a game the only one you should be mad at is yourself n
---
But in the slim chances that they cant find it, and that you to five stacks....

You feel like a God

Something like that

Big brain meme

Stopped reading right there. Quit this childish “I know you are but what am I” shit. 
---
There’s toxic killers, and there’s toxic survivors. End of story. Welcome to the internet
---
That actually isn't a connection issue. You *can* be hit through a window, it's part of the design of the game that killers can attack through them. Windows (logically) are different from walls or other solid objects in that regard.
---
Not only can you be hit after successfully jumping through a window (be it a slow, medium, or fast vault – the difference between them is just how long you're vulnerable for), you can even be hit if you're standing too close to a window and the killer, on the other side of said window, uses his M1 attack.
---
It's basically just a matter of understanding how killers' M1 attacks actually work and learning when you're safe and when you aren't.
---
I just ready up and go watch YT or browse reddit while waiting for the lobby to fill, i don't care anymore :D I just want to play the game. Be it some unlucky toxic SWF or baby dweets (since MM is a shitshow, that unfortunately happens).
---
I never really thought about it but damn, this Quentin looks horrible!
---
Moonrise feng is honestly one of my least favorite cosmetics for her, ugly af
---
That's called tunneling and survivors wine about that all the damn time.
---
Clownery, luv
---
No that's all survivors
---
Yes, it does.
---
Go play killer for a little bit. Seriously man.
---
... Ace. 
---
Still one silent fella :)
---
Will it also come to the Soulja Boy Console Port?
---
If they give undetectable to Wraith's cloaking, then no, he will stay hidden. (If ghostface gets it then he will stay hidden, too.)
---
Freddy will always be revealed by babysitter, he may dissappear occasionally though, because of micro sleeps (unless you are asleep, in which case he will always be visible.)
---
Legion used to be bad for the game not because of the power, but because of how easily exploitable he was. Now hes just a low tier killer which makes him bad just as a killer and not for the game
---
This used to happen to me on console, for some reason it just stopped and I don't know why it ever happened, I have a LAN connection as well because wifi in my room is bad
---
Just have Pennywise, but he can shift his form into new killers mid game like Jack Torrance and Carrie.
---
What about using distortion with babysitter?
---
Why did this make me laugh so goddamn hard
---
Lithe, Dance With Me, Pebble. EZ Jebaits
---
So yea mostly meme, but can be okay. Mostly just fun.
---
How about we just make it where it will activate both times your rescued
---
Probably sarcasm, but I'm asnwering anyway. It's too much
---
Well, since ranking is absolutely useless in this game aside from playing against better people, its more of, "if that's the route you choose to play as then sure". I'll just join another match, hopefully the killer had fun. I'm not going to nerd rage because they camped, that just means I got caught and need work on my juking skills the next match. Point is, its wrong to hate on someones game play when you don't know if they are new to playing in any aspect. You are basically hurting your self by releasing blind anger that will get you literally no where. Stress on yourself will kill you over time. Das no good.
---
I would say up the times to 5 sec, there isn't much you can go to in 3 sec, especially if your in the basement
---
Ash has to be the loudest bleeder, next to the likes of Bill. no thx. 
---
Punished Ace, all day.
---
If you run streamers with bbq you get about 100k. 2 games takes roughly 20-30 minutes. But grinding 2000 shards can take about 2 days of pure grinding. Shit makes no sense. Payout should at least be 500K
---
I’m not good at waiting for it to fill up
---
I’m saying the dude says he makes 150,000 BP a game without BBQ.....
---
Surprised this can't just be modded in, I'm guessing it's due to the connection infrastructure between survivors and killers? I wonder if this will be possible when dedicated servers roll out. I know that it's possible with P2P connections where only you are able to see the mods, that even that would be enough for me.
---
It's a new feature that were getting.
---
We are entering an infinetly long Watch for the PTB
---
Yeah meg is one of the 4 main free survivors original survivors
---
People knew what I meant. English is a back-ally chimera language anyway. Words don’t need to word correctly as long as they sound like they word correctly.
---
Why not? It's pretty nice, it gives you more of an objective.
---
Stealth buff?
---
Fake news
---
Agreed, but I still buy it cause Im always hungry for more blood points 8)
---
he smells the sweat off thei- oh im sorry i was getting carried away
---
They're most likely not to be working
---
But nobody knows what it exactly is? Or what it does?
---
I always assume it's a desperate measure to point out a teammate in order for me to spare you.
---
It never ends well.

Yay. Somebody sensible)

They don’t work unfortunately

You are trash you insignificant maggot that dares to disagree with me, the dbd lord.

You ass, shut up and go play fortnite.

For everyone reading: he's my friend in real life. Just trolling.
---
r/moriedbywords
---
Big brain, I never thought of that
---
I honestly don’t know why people use Shards for BP. I play 2 Killer games in 30 minutes using BBQ and a Survivor Pudding and I get over 150K.
---
For someone named GeneralKnowledge you seem to be lacking a lot of it.
---
I paid for game, dlcs, skins and now i need to pay for Battlepass? Yes, why not.
---
They described it as adding new lore to the game with a battle pass-like mechanic.
---
Definitely, I feel handicapped without whispers
---
I don't really remember but I know we are getting more info about the in game characters and a new currency (Dust) but we don't know what it is gonna do. And I think that the Rift a battlepass is but I am not sure.
---
No I didn't. That's a perk reskin.
---
Don’t get things in SOS if you have the killer or survivor.
---
I first thought this was Jeff with coat skin ._.
---
That's a shame, would be cool if they did. Thanks tho!
---
You can go to another I believe
---
But you don't have to pay for a battlepass, the only thing it is gonna give you is skins (And you already have those) and probably a little bit of Auric cells to reward you. It's not because they add it into the game that you have to pay for it.
---
You won't like my face then
---
Bitches trying to make us broke lmao. But good to know! Thanks
---
Pretty good job so far!
---
Oh, cmon man, every free battlepass in every game is literally bullshit
---
You can just go to the killer or survivor you want to equip the perk on, and start running through bloodwebs. Warning....you could go through multiple bloodwebs before it appears. Just keep that in mind. When I first bought D-Strike, it took about 30 bloodwebs before it showed up. It's random as hell. Good luck!
---
Your my favorite  survivor  until you find ruin..... then you gotta go
---
Pebble time?
---
I hope you do use his power otherwise you're just an M1 killer. But I see that you are new so I assume you don't have a lot of good perks. Noed is good for beginners to get some extra bloodpoints.
---
1 Crow 60 seconds.    
---
2 crows 75 seconds.

3 crows 90 seconds.     
---
    
---
(It’s on the DBD wiki under Crows-Stillness Crows.)
---
Alright so if I don’t have them I can still get the perk through the shrine, right?
---
You are a dog shit eaten by bugs and repooped by them. You have a wonderful PC and you spend most of your time playing dbd, you disgusting son of a cop. And you still think you are a proud gamer, you deluded bag of manure. For everyone reading: fuck yourself.
---
I think pig is great and very underrated. Yeah her head traps aren't guaranteed kills but they are a natural way of slowing the game down because if survivors are getting traps off their heads then they aren't on gens. Her crouch is fun for sneaking up and for mind games too
---
Having a choice is better than not. So you can bitch all you want, I'm hyped to get new shit in a system of progression rather than direct purchase. It's gonna be fun for those of us who do
---
Addons, character voices, perk synergies, leaked cosmetics in the files, map layout, balancing... there's a reason why ptb's are so sought after
---
Im kinda new to the game what does SWF means?
---
When you are going against a face camper throw a pebble at the closest locker, they will check it, and use borrowed time to make an escape
---
A rank 1 surv loops a rank 1 billy way longer than a rank 1 spirit.
---
Survive With Friends. Welcome to the game dude :)
---
You can't kick gens if they are already regressing.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Ur good!
---
I'm being 100% serious. She fucking FLIPS.
---
Lmao I was so happy getting my first flashlight save. Too bad I got face camped by a Spirit bc of it.
---
It can ban you and if it does, the devs won’t help you getting your account back.
---
So better safe than sorry huh
---
I like that one
---
YES
---
What stealth buff?
---
Yeah, I thought the other one got removed but I guess I got confused in all the messages. My mistake.
---
Don't see the problem nor does the comparison make sense but k
---
Killer was AFK, so i spent most of the countdown timer running around them to gain more bold points. I literally need a map to find the hatch at the best of times...
---
AFAIK someone has yet to get banned for it, but there’s still a small chance that it could happen.
---
This is a shame.
---
You must be new around here
---
We’ve been awake for a while now...
---
me talking to myself every time i hit someone with a thrown hatchet
---
Your account is bugged. If you have all the killers you never get them. If you still get them your account is just bugged.
---
What’s your point? Yes, some things you have to pay for in life. If people wanna spend their money to buy cool cosmetics, that’s their right. It really doesn’t affect the core game at all, and you can keep playing the way you do. If the only thing you have to cry about is skins costing money, then that’s a pretty good thing tbh.
---
I’m just throwing around numbers. Now that I think about is idea 1 needs a way for the killer to know that the person might have the perk. Maybe some sort of trigger they can pick up on
---
Oohh i like this, and with prices since some perks run more expensive
---
Am I dumb or do I just have Hag unlocked from the get-go? I never saw Hag as DLC, but maybe its a ps4 thing
---
I Play survivor and bring nothing with me. 150k is like 10 games
---
Touche. I hate headphones, never think to use them, but that is an easy solution.
---
hope you feel good about yourself
---
I can somehow see Huntress mains using this
---
And if I am?
---
One time i was playing Nurse and i was in rank 11 and playing with Omega Blink (altough i didn't knew it was a thing)
---
Anyway, i faced against a Tapp that kept teabagging in every palette and when i finally downed him, he EDC and in the end chat, he told me to lay a good killer
---
Good times
---
Favorite Mori. You can tell the doctor enjoys his job.
---
I wonder what that would have done
---
*vanity mirror, not scratched mirror
---
Ah sounds like a good time.
---
It would explain why you don't understand the comparison.
---
Stroke?
---
Stealth what?
---
Idk, I can't. Spirits are easy to mindgame.
---
It's not all SWF players, but it seems like PC toxicity is higher, yeah. Something about using a keyboard and mouse feels more like it's your responsibility if you win or lose.
---
It can go both ways, but Survivors -especially SWFs- have an advantage, and bullying is always punching down.
---
Got to love the dead by daylight glitches I had a Survivor dead hard when I threw a hatchet at him which is actually pretty impressive, if he wasn't impervious for like 5 minutes after that.
---
What's your build? I experimented with a few but my current is Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ, and Pop.
---
That's why I hardly use streamers unless I'm in an SWF, because at least that way I'm playing with others that share team chemistry with me. 
---
Can't trust the randoms.
---
Unfortunately, all that is true. Toxic af. What annoys me most is how he looks down on everyone else in a quite disrespectful manner, thinking he's somebody before whom everybody has to kneel. It's outrageous to hear him speak while being drunk on BBB Fridays, saying he could ban whoever he wants if they don't purchase a tier 3/2 subscription; that's when the true AngryPug comes out. 
---
I guess when he says he doesn't like r/deadbydaylight it's mostly because we're not here to say what he wants to hear, unlike those brain-dead kids in his chat that put up with his constant rants and also flatter him. He's just a adult child who craves money and attention, even if that means making a fool of himself in front of 2000 people. 
---
Anyway, I watch his content from time to time cause he plays well (avoid BBB Fridays tho), but I'm definitely not spending a single penny on him and have moved on to other non-toxic streamers.
---
One problem people have is not knowing how much they don't know. When they lack the knowledge to counter a specific strategy, they view it as toxic, cheating or unfair.  
---
I remember playing against a Billy that ran me the wrong way around the TL loop. I looped two of them to entity blocker, and he was not too happy. I explained to him after the game that you have to run it the other way and force them onto only the T part, and he was more than happy to receive an explanation. When a player see's something they don't know how to counter, they often jump to the conclusion that there is no counter. If they are open minded you might be able to get through to them by explaining the counter play.
---
The cruelest thing I did was seeing 4 party streamers popped and quit the application....almost went to church to confess after that
---
Seeing these addons is sparking my ptsd from the last two years
---
So make Killers lunge faster and tighten the hitbox over windows and it'll be even. They'll still be able the land the hits they would have, but with proper collision.
---
The third perk needs to be more clear, and from what I understood it promotes infinites. The other 2 perks are good, i like the second one because with killers running enduring and spirit fury getting a stun punishes the survivor heavily and it will result as an free hit most of the time.
---
How many hours you got in game?
---
886! :)
---
Otz is great, he showed me that the legion pin isn't actually garbage.
---
I'll use Discordance (when it finally comes on the shrine...), BBQ+C, PGTW, and Surveillance. This build capitalizes on Freddy's gen teleporting ability.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO D:
---
We know very little about the killer's power. I'd like to know if that lunge is as garbage as it looks.
---
There are some addons that reduce the detection range by a lot. If you were super close to him, then I get it. But I doubt it considering he could have been running the 2 best detection addons where you pretty much have to be point blank.
---
What's stealth lmao
---
You can guess the non pink addons because they are usually just do (action) slightly faster. We know they didn’t get the original voice actors. You don’t need to use the perk to guess what it can synergies with. The balancing will most likely happen after the ptb and before the live release.
---
It's not very rampant, but those 9 games never makes anyone go on reddit and complain.
---
DS, Adrenaline, Iron Will, (Exhaustion Perk, I use a Lithe.)
---
Dead Hard has been super inconsident for me lately, I've had much better games with Lithe.
---
Right now I'm using BBQ, Hex: Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, and No:Ed. No:Ed is pretty toxic I know but I'd like to switch it out in a new build anyway because 9/10 times it doesn't get used or it doesn't matter because it's already popped. Hex: Ruin is the same, it's really good if it stays but usually it's popped in the first few seconds. Corrupt I just threw on because I heard it was good lol. As you can see 3 of the 4 perks can pretty much die so it's not very great, it's just been working so far. I'm a survivor main only now dabbling into killer and I know what the good perks are, I just don't know what blends well with who and I really like Freddy in the game.
---
I've had that happen on console, thought it was weird too.
---
It’s just not really fair for the survivors bc they are playing off killer connection and it’s just constantly them lagging. Just wait for dedicated servers which should be coming out soon I believe
---
Oh shit I was expecting like 1200 or something. Good job. I got 60% and have 512 hours. But there are some really hard ones.
---
Or maybe they were ready for the game to end but the killer wouldn't hook.
---
dbd community in a nutshell
---
I actually died to monstrous shrine with someone right in front me once. Literally the only time I've seen it do something.
---
happened to me on mobile, ngl.
---
Nah she poopoo
---
That was the joke, yeah. Her addons + no doctor
---
where is Mathieu Cote so i can kill him
---
Oh god it’s that *thing*
---
Survivors when a killer dodges them because he's scared: * laughs in teabag *
---
Yea, they re just saying don't waste shards when you can grind BP For the teachable.
---
Using your basic attack is an effective way to hurt survivors.
---
yep im wrong forgot im thinking about something else
---
It really does suck to spawn under the killer's ballsack and be found in the first 3 seconds though.
---
In my case in the other way around: are you afk and ruined the game for you teammates? You deserve to die and the rest escape.
---
it doesnt give you an advantage. playing solo gives you a disadvantage. but this sub is just determined to make it seem like survivors are always the stronger side, so idk why i even bother arguing it.
---
I was not even lagging, I have a good connection. I play dota2, csgo and pubg i dont get problem with my internet.
---
I thought the joke was "keeping the doctor away will have you dying of some horrible disease"  
---
no idea why i thought that, guess i'm just a moron
---
I'm in the US and keep getting Russian and Chinese lobbies, which is just awful because every single ping is above 300.
---
I just had this happen! I was so proud of them
---
You are the enemy of the people.
---
Id say the other way around more often than not.
---
Here's another one : he still escaped.
---
you must've missed the part about oversaturated content
---
But you gotta admit, he's a damn good teacher.
---
I know we're deep in meme turf, but I want a Sniper Killer a little more every time I see this.
---
https://i.imgur.com/kLnLcXr.jpg Like this, but less Sentai I guess.
---
Well there are still little details we still don't know about. Wraith and ghostface could be getting the undetectable buff, and purple addons usually give interesting effects as well. And with the voices, I just wanna hear them. I know they aren't the original actors :p
---
Or on a hex totem.
---
I decided on Spirit tho
---
Lol at make your choice face camping leatherface
---
In the rare situation where the Leather face doesn't camp I'll always make sure I thank them cause that shit's nasty.
---
Needit

Controversial opinion but it looks like Surge will be strong and Inner Strength will replace Self-Care as meta.

“HE SHOT THEM IN THE HEART! HE SHOT THEM SIX TIMES!”

I know everyone else does too but I’ve never had this problem
---
Ima wiggle all I want. Bring it.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ guess a mod can take this post down then
---
You asked for opinions on camping, I gave you one. What you edited your post to is not about actual camping, it’s about checking the hooks which is the point of the game. That is not considered camping by any means.
---
Pebble time
---
This is what I was planning on doing
---
She can see blood but it’s mot highlighted. Also, don’t run Bloodhound.
---
Wait, how can they chat if they D/C? Console?
---
It doesn't give you an advantage....seriously you are either highly delusional or one of the most biased people to ever comment on this sub.  No reasonable person would ever deny the advantage playing in a swf with comms provides survivors in game.  I don't even understand how anybody could ever argue against that simple declaration.
---
You’re absolutely right but I don’t consider those part of the “chapter”, just general game changes. I thought the chapter is what you buy, correct me if I’m wrong though.
---
Man, remember sabo_jake?
---
one can only hope
---
Sweet summer child you are too innocent for this world!
---
Killer Klowns From Outer Space!!!
---
Deal.
---
Yeah that makes sense.  I like the idea of resilience but in real time play I could see where bond would be the more viable option
---
DCing puts you in the end game lobby
---
ok bud.
---
Holding W or pressing forward on the stick of your controller makes your character walk forward in the game!
---
Not sure how you figure; this sub seems to be almost entirely killers. Even statements like "It sucks to be tunneled from minute one, so that you spend more time queuing and loading than playing" are controversial here!
---
If you're on console, if the killer dashboards then you lose the bp you earned I believe
---
One game I had a david that was AFK the whole time and I dropped him out the door int he end while he was still afk, it was pretty fun.
---
Fair enough 
---
#A flamethrower for Freddy
---
Léry's is located in Illinois.
---
DS is fine now, but if I could change anything about it I would bring the time down to 20-30 (somewhere between that) seconds at all ranks, make it so that it can activate on both unhooks, stays active for an extra minute after being downed and not crawling, and will NOT activate once the exit gates are powered, then scale the stun 5/6/7. That makes it the anti-tunneling perk it was meant to be, instead of one where you could very possibly not be tunneling and still get hit by it because of the long duration, or one where the unhooked survivor gets a late-game get out of jail free. It also means that those who do tunnel and get hit by it are punished more.
---
Rip. That’s why I switched to playing Killer.
---
The nerf they did on him shows the power of tweaking instead of reworks. Went from op to underpowered compared to the best killers. I think they spent too many resources on reworking Freddy when they could have just changed some of his numbers and saved those new mechanics for a new killer. A little bit of a buff to current add ons and a decrease on the mend pause to half the terror radius or a little smaller even would make him much more viable.
---
Yeah but your post said he was banned on twitch for inting. Twitch never banned him for that. He eventually started streaming other games and played league on the downlow until he was unbanned.

Brutal strength. People will drop pallets early cuz of your shock therapy and so you can easily deal with them.

2 perks just to let your teamates go without scratchmarks ?

That's a good idea. Thank you.
---
That seems kinda nasty but I like it. Will try.
---
Infinite tier 3 Myers with: Enduring, Brutal Strength Bamboozle, Ruin (but for the meme PWYF).
---
Works wonders with him especially since his power makes the skill checks appear at random spots on the screen.
---
Which instantly becomes the killers "reason for hook camping" if he catches up to someone. There's no winning against a killer mains logic. Most are just out to troll and force depips on the unlucky first knockdown. Genuinely hate the community lately. More often than not, wether I escape or die, the killer is a chode.
---
I'd really love to play Ghost Face, I think he's interesting. The only issue is his detection mechanic is pure bullshit.
---
On both ends.
---
There are times when I'm starring a Ghost Face directly in the eyes, middle of my screen, and just NOTHING happens. There are times when I'm playing Ghost Face and despite a Survivor literally being around a corner I still get spotted or somehow still expose them. It's insanity.
---
Let's hope this is cause by desync between client and server and will HOPEFULLY be ironed out with dedicated servers.
---
That explains a lot
---
He's by far the most annoying killer. Not the hardest to go against, no, but he will grind your gears bad.
---
Same as when you aren't at a wall. Don't stare at where you want it to be.
---
Let’s hope that we never meet
---
Yes, and so should console players. It should just be a universal feature, not one exclusive to low settings.
---
Wake Up is my favorite survivor perk even though it's not actually that strong, just because getting caught at the gate is somehow worse than getting caught anywhere else.
---
That's a real Meg move.
---
&gt;Guys I looped the killer for like 3 gens haha really got him!
---
Except they used roughly every pallet on the map, slammed down the god pallets immediately and now the remaining gens are a killing field.
---
Brenda Meeks from Scary Movie, obviously. She’s iconic

Windows are most of the time a safe bet for survivors, but not all of the time. You are acting like once the survivor vaults a window, there is a giant wall covering the open part of the window where the survivor can't be hit. It's called a WINDOW. If you get too close to the other side that you just came from, you'll get hit. It's called hitboxes dumby.
---
I've been wondering about that too 
---
It looks really bad but it looks like it goes really wide though. It'll probably still get juked though.
---
I'm not really too concerned about the demogorgon though, i just wanna play as pink shirt nancy. :)
---
I’m a big fan of this series, but I can’t recall Hoffman in a motorcycle jacket like that. A rain slicker once, but jacket?
---
Shaquille o'neal as killer
---
Babysitter will remove the blood and scratch marks from the hooked person... 
---
Distortion will keep you hidden from the killer, and remove your scratch marks at the same time.
---
I love watching people actually use diversion for good, and not chucking it at the killers face.
---
It is a strat. Very detrimental strat. But its there.
---
Lol I never use addons on nurse, got like 30-40 iridescent moris and enough addons for 50 games of omega blinks
---
Damn. Watch some Otz or Pain Reliever to get up to speed.
---
There’s been far too many instances where I’m home free, the exit gate’s open and I’m full health. I try to go help someone and the killer ends up having NOED. Then I end up dying feeling like the most foolish
---
Basically, Dead by Daylight as survivors aren't supposed to be able to communicate, where SWF basically breaks the original intent and makes it for people able to party together and communicate as survivors. SWF can end up being the most painful of experiences for a killer because of the devs deciding to implement this feature back in 1.0.3 and not really thinking about the balance but trying to cater to the fanbase. Ultimately, in my opinion, SWF should be an unranked mode, and not allowed to participate in ranked play, just like the Kill your Friends mode.
---
What are you talking about? Not only is he a survivor main, but only killers can lagswitch and camp. Can you send me the link of what you're talking about?
---
I guess the Hag is the ps4's compensation for bad frame rates lmao

Well, the addons and voices parts are tied to the character that you need to buy. The buff/changes stuff are just updates that come with the chapter.

Be cool (if like Ash Williams) she had some of her best quotes in the game.

He facecamps me for “lagswitching” it’s not on video because uploading that would show how much of an asshole he is
---
SWF is op due to communication. It negates many of the perks that a survivor runs due to mic coms.

 If you are in a position to get hit right off the hook in the basement, your teammate should be running borrowed time.

Most people tell me racquetball is one of the best hobbies when you retire.
---
The killer can only grab you from a vault if you're already injured (he can, however, grab you even if you're full health from actual interactions, like repairing a gen, cleansing totems, opening gates). However, there's also a very specific way for a killer to trigger a grab (no lunge on the M1 attack, correct angle and proximity, etc). That's why it's way more common to just be hit normally through the window instead of grabbed, even when you're in fact injured (and especially if you're fast vaulting).
---
That being said, there are obvious cases of ping/lag/desync. If you (1) are already on the other side of the window, (2) out of the vault "stagger", (3) have recovered your full movement, and (4) are already sufficiently away enough from the window *you shouldn't be hit*. If you are hit even under these circumstances, it's a connection issue (from the killer's perspective you weren't as far away from the window as you were in your screen, and since he's the host, his perspective is the one that matters). Dedicated Servers, whenever they come, will luckily improve heavily on those situations. 
---
But do note that there's still a fair amount of time that the killer can successfully hit you on the other side of the window after you've vaulted it. Learning those times can help quite a lot in order to judge, during a chase, if a vault is safe or not considering how close the killer is to you (and that's what I was saying in my original comment about how, in the video posted, most of the times it was fairly predictable that that survivor was gonna get hit, because he didn't have enough distance to vault like that).
---
lmao
---
I always give hatch if they don’t wiggle or if I shake my head no and they stop I’ll still give the hatch. I hate pipping . Rank 5 is not fun as killer.
---
And then they don't.
---
Thank god
---
Did you just bunny hop over blood warden?
---
Survivors all play the same. No such thing as Jake mains, Meg mains, David mains, etc. All just skins with perks
---
If you use ur brain you can get a rough idea
---
ill have to see what the subreddit for that is like before i decide
---
Holy shit if you need this much to explain yourself than you didn’t make anything worth reading besides the first half, kid. Make a better point as to why being a toxic killer is good
---
there were more similarities before, like Lery's used to be chinese (a preview video showed the exit sign said exit in chinese) but they sorta pulled back, probably to avoid controversy
---
Omg imagine if she’s running away from a ring-inspired killer and she just blurts out, “this bitch is messin’ up my floor!”
---
That's the point, actually. Usually people don't care about ranks with such builds. They just do this for personal fun. Or deranking on purpose. Or both.
---
Are you "could of"s daddy?

Jake and Tapp formed the Gen rushes alliance, and they stay the Fuck out of most of the action, much like Dwight and Claude, but they will be doing gens.

I always find Jake on a Fucking Gen, and he usually finishes the last Gen.

I need the address.
---
Sorry for such a long text, but since you appeared genuinely confused about that I thought I'd take the time to write down what I know. But yeah, in short, the killer *can* literally reach over the window.

Dude 200% deal. I got downed by a Billy a week or three ago and I had barely finished my load rotation. Maybe 3 seconds out. Hadn't taken my first step and was literally checking horizon.
---
is ptb out?
---
farmer john and pain reliever. both are extremely fun to watch
---
Urban evasion is good for sneaking around avoiding chases and something like dark sense or alert is useful for knowing where the killer is and steering clear of them, therefore increasing your survival chances.
---
Oh well lol
---
Same as on here lol.
---
as a lot of people have said, it's because killers would just constantly dodge.
---
but also I just don't think it's possible at the moment for the same reason that it doesn't keep SWF groups together after a game. When you connect to a killer as a SWF, as far as the game is concerned, those are all solo players. That's just how it's coded to work atm.
---
Oh no. Legion has a Stand now. We're all *fucked*.
---
idk man it doesnt seem that great, pretty dead and a lot of old people.any other suggestions?
---
Okay this is actually true your right. Base cosmetics suck (flannels and stuff coulda worked but they look gross). 
---
But her face is fine.
---
We should have a option that disables having someone spectate us.
---
The biggest problem with the community is the us vs them mentality, if people would just stop hating the other side and think of everyone as a player like themselves playing the game then it'd be much better.
---
I play both killer and survivor but I mainly play survivor so when I do play killer I don’t tunnel/camp survivors because I know I don’t like when killers do it to me.
---
Even better if it's an swf of dweets
---
Look territorial imperative needs to have a constant kindred view of the basement at all times, along with the Small Game sound whenever someone new enters with the same timer mechanism as small game.
---
About a year or two ago I had a Claudette do this head wedged into a totem at a jungle gym. I couldn't grab her. I honestly thought she DC'd and the game just had a brain fart how to handle it and had to let her bleed out.

Nah this is all Claudette’s. Baby Dwight’s just fail the skillcheck.

I like Stridor for tracking with legion and I also run nurses and Sloppy. I don't think Thanatophobia would be bad to use, that way if they don't heal, they are debuffed still. And 16 % is +8 seconds on a gen which isn't negligible. Legion Pin is a nice add on for double hitting your last target in a frenzy to break them.
---
Then do you not understand what tunneling is? You think you should have 60 seconds of immunity no matter what?
---
Very true and I’ve only gotten it to work in the lower ranks
---
Most of the time 4 survivors join at once its solo queues and the occasional 2 or 3 man swf. You can check a survivors profile and on their friends list in steam or console you search for the other players names to check if they actually are a swf. Today when playing killer i would be waiting in a lobby for minutes waiting for 1 person to join then 4 solo queues would join within a 5 second frame.

More of what could have been, but I think gettin Eric Matthews as the survivor for the Saw chapter what have been a much better idea. Amanda had pretty much no screen time with Tapp and actually fought Eric, so it would make sense for those two to be picked. I mean Amanda hated Eric. His brutal interrogation tactics, survivability, and actually fighting back could have played a role in his perks. Such a missed opportunity in my opinion.
---
Why is the name in the chat screencap not in the scoreboard one?
---
Even if they weren't encouraged to, often it's best to actually go back to hook anyway.
---
If I haven't found anyone else, why *wouldn't* I go to the place where I know two Survivors are going to be?
---
The camera's?  Yeah, I checked those.  Never seemed to work for me, alas.

It's annoying when survivors do that. I play both killer and survivor.
---
It sucks as a killer cause you can't get as much BP and becomes too easy. 
---
It sucks as a survivor cause now you're at a big disadvantage starting with 3 at the beginning.
---
Because you arent pressuring gens at all, going back to hooks is objectively a less efficient strategy than running chili and pressuring the proper gens and snowballing effectively. Just moving 40m away jerking off till someone grabs a surv off a hook is terrible on a cost-return basis.
---
That is a jerboa

there’s two sides to this and both sides will disagree every time. All I’m saying is I don’t understand why people ruin others gaming experience just to get a cheap win. It’s easy enough to get a 4 man while playing a clean game if you’re a half decent killer.

Can usually see that someone being chased even outside swf and terror radius exists.  And there's a hud that shows when someone is hit or carried or hooked but yes. "Hes chasing me" is the reason people get on gens early (as if thats not the goal straight away. Its best to just shove your thumb up your ass until someone says "im being chased") You know why people don't like swf.

It's not my fault when I get camped after spawning 4 feet from the killer, then proceeding to be tunneled. (and sometimes moried)

Definitely true. I've had times where I got broken out and the Survivor wasn't even close, and other times where I tried breaking him out and it just didn't want to work (also didn't have Detailed Routine or Driver's License). He's really inconsistent but very fun when he works. 
---
No better feeling than mind gaming Survivors by 99'ing them, acting like you're going back to the hook, but then you wait around the corner for them to come back to the gen/totem they were working on and getting the insta-down

Literally the only YouTuber I trust to come up with solid perk builds, Otz is a DbD god
---
Hello Chris. This image is referencing the video game Dead by Daylight. What you are seeing is a visual representation of the perk build called “Burger King Meyers.” He is called that because he moves *SUPER SLOW* as if he has an obesity health issue and cannot catch up to the survivors, only moving at 80% of the speed the survivors run at. Meyers is holding 4 perks that when used in game, make the survivors run SUPER FAST (150% faster) and makes it super hard for Meyers to catch up to the survivors. Which means that Meyers (the player) will not be having fun this game. In the meantime, I will be counting off the days until the Stranger Things PTB comes out.
---
I do this simply because I always buy the DLC or will purchase auric cells for any cosmetic I really want. For those that are saying they get BP really quickly, that's true. But the player level ranking also makes it much easier to get shards too.
---
But that's how u become a target. Killers assume.
---
If I'm being completely honest I wear the p3 head and default clothes or other clothes just to look like a tryhard (because I am).  I'd say for mostly everyone they don't consider it tryhard but some people do and there's nothing wrong being a tryhard anyways

Banner flying over every single page of DBD official site : "We do not have a date for the PTB at this time. We will share more info as soon as it is available." I would guess they are working over approvals with Netflix.

Are you kidding? Half this reddit is survivors complaining about killers “complaining” about stuff and then you try and find said killers AND THERES NON OF THEM I’ve heard more survivors bitching about the Mettle of Man changes and every single survivor balance change then I’ve heard survivors complain about anything “and usually when killers complain about anything no matter what it is survivors are quick to say that problems such as gen speed and lack of strong killers aren’t a problem

The doctors difficulty literally says **Hard**

&amp; yet they called him an easy killer... makes sense. This happened to my boyfriend the other day, he demolished an SWF &amp; they sent him a party invite so they could all talk shit, he just accepted it and we had a good laugh while they tried to get a word in. Apparently laughing loudly and sporadically into the mic makes you a *Clown*, “mentally &amp; literally.”  I think sending party invites to the killer so you can be a cry baby makes you a clown but hey, that’s just me.

I should.. ;~;

REEEEEEEEEEE

Are they going to be other emotes aside from that like dirty finger or something HAHAHAHA
---
Hi Chris, Thank you for writing into the talk show! There a joke in the dead by daylight community that people who use the African American survivor character, Claudette Morel with dark cosmetics, especially when new to the game, like to hide in bushes or the corner of the map when there is slight evidence that the killer is near. When the survivors do this it means they stop working on objectives, which hinders the team in the long run. 
---
This meme I made is knee slapping hilarious because it depicts that, even though the killer is far away, not approaching the gen, or even noticing the Claudette's existence as a whole, the Claudette still has the strong urge to run to the opposite side of the map to hide in the corner while her team suffers. What is even more haha funny is the fact that the Claudette uses the perk URBAN EVASION in front of the killer in some bushes. UE is another inside joke to the community because it is hardly helpful to those who know how to handle chases properly and is only used by people who feel the need to hide from the killer constantly, which all experienced players know is an ineffective method of playing. UE bottled with Claudette's skin color shows that she is extra hidden, invisible as you will, to the killer.

Thank you again for your question today Chris but unfortunately we are all out of time for this segment! Up next: will this scared little boy hiding in a red locker EVER come out to help out his loved ones? find out after these messages!
---
I didn't move I told my friends I was going to just stand still until I reveled him. I only got the reveal once I was on his shoulder which I also thought was strange. He did not have any add ons for that He was fairly new to the character and said he just started using him.
---
The best part is that even the actor wants this.
---
At rank 19 I got put in a match with all rank 2
---
Just one borrow time and/or ds and its fine. Its a GF, not a bubba or a doc

PTB being the new chapter?
---
I never did play before that update. Anytime I SWF it’s always a win so I can see how unbalanced that can be because we always communicate “getting chased. Near you on that gen. You two doing other gens?” And just carry out a long chase while gen rushing. 
---
I think proximity chat would be better, like they have in the Friday 13th game. That way you can only really communicate when working on a gen together or healing or intervening in chases.
---
Because hix reg is fucking garbage.
---
Wtf why did I think this was porn at first that doesn’t even make sense
---
As long as you're not talking about mind gaming around a corner, any killer can moonwalk, but you will usually see it happen on a straight shot from one of these:
---
Myers, Trapper, Wraith, Billy, LF  
---
These killers use it with the PWYF perk and try to lose the chase by facing the other way to gain an extra speed token.
---
Uninstall and the reinstall. If that doesn’t work contact customer support
---
It's still unfun to play against lol
---
You're good, thanks for taking the time to explain some of the mechanics.
---
You can legit run both. BT is for desperate times. Not really a license for unsafe hooks. BT is to trade person on the hook if someone is about to die or a last resort against campers. WMI is usefull all the time for just getting people back in the game for the normal safe hook which should be the majority of the times
---
Talking a lot of shit for someone who thinks the doctor is the easiest killer in the game, that’s a yikes from me dawg
---
With all the bloodpoint events they've done and with cakes and streamers I'd be surprised if there's anyone with over 50 hours that doesn't have at least a couple prestige cosmetics.
---
Anyone who genuinely believes prestige = skill is dumb.
---
There's a survivor offering that spawns you as far as possible from the killer.
---
Tru3 for advice, Monto for laughs, Otzdarva for both.
---
It is still possible that i might get ban, whether they telling truth or not. cause they were 4 reports
---
Lungs are vital for hamon users.
---
I instantly read Play with your cock............
---
Imo bubba has the best mori just wish it was more graphic
---
100% agreed. That and the matchmaking pairing new killers with red/purple survivors, and vice versa.
---
Ive honestlu only really have played jake, ive leveled others for their perks but am solely a jake main, i just like his cosmetics the most (I run the pink pants and the asian shirt/ headgear, most for the memes)

---
Ptb means Player test build im pretty sure, its for the pc players to test out upcoming updates and give feedback
---
Same
---
ptb is the public test build, where pc players can play the new chapter before it comes out
---
Oh alright. I play this game a decent amount casually and have never heard this nor play on PC. Thanks
---
Every time is have someone try to pallet me from fifty yards away I just shake my head and down them and then I take them back to the pallet and stand on top of it and nod, go to where they tried to pallet me and shake my head and then take them to a pallet that's not down and let them jump off and see if they learned, if not they get the hook.

We need og quentin
