I could be wrong, but if anyone is curious they said that on the stranger things chapter reveal
---
Everyone says NoED inhibits your abilities since you rely on it late game
---
Doesn't luck effect pulling something out of a chest?
---
Tier list according to who? I understand tier lists are mostly subjective but a lot of these are straight up wrong. Objectively.
---
wtf
---
That’s why I run small game and do laps around the map lol
---
He’s on PS4
---
If you buff his ability to end chases quickly, his map pressure goes up.
---
He doesn't need to be able to zoom around the map or stealth around (though based on his trailer, with him stalking Kate and all, you'd think he could hide his presence a little).
---
If he downs a survivor, that means two people are off the gens for a while (one on the hook, one going for a save).
---
Borrowed time is fine. I despise Adrenaline because of the free health state. I do like 60%/40% survivor/killer, and I don't like Adrenaline or NOED on both sides. I feel like you should have to work for the health state or one-hit down, whether its through a medkit or using a killer ability to issue the dying state. The only time a killer should insta down with a melee attack is if it's Myers. You have to work for that Tier 3 and stalk survivors who are actively trying to hide.
---
Seeing people demanding Pig buffs everywhere is just tiring after the 1000 time you see it per day but yeah i expected the downvotes it just that pig was nerfed once in her lifetime lol
---
Fair point, but the new design is overly-designed to the point where I just don't buy anyone going near that thing. I mean believable in regards to do they look like an actual person, which Tim Curry's does, even if it's a pedo LOL
---
Not sure how "buy" could mean incest, but if you want to think that I'm sure there are videos online to please your fantasies.
---
I can’t see BHVR making the effort to support banned players. If they shut you down outright, I don’t think it’ll be because of the work involved.
---
In the first place, why would the devs bother doing anything at all to improve the lives of banned players who couldn’t be bothered to follow their rules?
---
There are higher priorities to work on, e.g. focusing on the needs of the players who ARE being cooperative.
---
Also, I don’t think BHVR and Steam are able to or OBLIGED to reply to every feedback they receive. You might be waiting in vain for a response.
---
so...? just switch back to doctor?
---
I got a shitton of BP but I kinda half regret how I spent them. I spent a lot on Hag to try and get Ruin, but then said fuck it when she got to level 25. Prestiged Ash, and it took me 40 levels on him to get decent perks set up again. I still don't have my *precious* Iron Will.
---
Serbia Strunk.
---
good riddance, I hate playing with salty people
---
But you could use so many other perks that would help you consistently, instead of just for 1 occasion. What do you do if survivors break all the totems or break your NOED totem as soon as it procs. 
---
Edit: edited original comment. Pls read thanks
---
Spine chill is cool but I personally like my eyes and ears
---
I never find use for it. Think it’s an absolute waste. I run Dead hard, DS, Borrowed, Inner S. don’t think spine chill could replace any of these perks.
---
Oh, I thought he was comparing the two
---
IDK, 5 Survivors AND Ghostface working together? She might have a rough time.
---
the only one you named i agree has an awkward condition to it is mindbreaker, and maybe buckle up. the rest are fine for balance reasons
---
Doing gen, you?
---
although that is partially true with how fast gens can be completed u can down people within 25 second chases and still lose a match
---
Isn't the current working theory that the Entity saw the sheer number of Kills he had under his belt (since every car had a person in it) and didn't let a little thing like not knowing about any of them stop The Entity from taking him.
---
The fact that he murdered his boss in cold blood and ripped out his spine/skull probably didn't help much.
---
[Console huntress] Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running to other monsters, you decide to learn the secert of the strongest killer?
---
I am trying to play this game with two other friends on Switch and we can't get into the same lobby together. We keep getting an error that player can't be added due to block list. We just bought the game and have not added anyone to a block list nor even know where to find the block list. What is going on? Is it not possible to play with more than one friend in Survivor mode?
---
I mean, I'm fine with MoM coming back if we can bring back Machine Gun.
---
I totally agree with you and love barb...that said you’re not your.
---
As you can see, it has the locked symbol. Meaning i dont have him, yet i can play him
---
I don't get it
---
If you run perks like Distressing and Padded-Jaw Traps for example, you can easily lose out on lots of BP if they don't want to farm. No big deal, you still get BP but you will not get any hooks if they are a serious team.
---
Yeah, I just had a 4k with Plague myself, which lead to "Entity Displeased" and a lost connection. Not even sure if I'll get those points. That was my first Plague game too, so it's extra cool.  
---
Update: the match didn't count at all, apparently, even though I was at the end screen when I lost connection, so I received no points from it and it's as if the match never happened. Couldn't have asked for a better first Plague match, really!
---
Amateurs
---
Mate WTF
---
There aren’t dedicated servers mate, host unreachable is pretty self explanatory, didn’t think it would have to be explained. It means you can’t connect to the host, shock horror I know right I thought it was hidden in the small print so I didn’t read the gigantic notification.
---
No, im too worried that once i do I can’t play Micheal anymore
---
I think most people sleep on it, it's a major power spike against every killer and especially stealth reliant ones (also jukeing spirit).
---
You can fit so many playstyles for it so yeah i almost never see it and always wonders why.
---
The only downside is that it's hard to play without it once you are used to it, feels like a totally different build when changing this sole perk.
---
That makes no sense, you must be glitched
---
Stay aware when you know it’s Michael, avoid line of sight when he’s stalking. And run for your fucking life when he’s tier 3. Then you’ll be fine :)
---
I kind of enjoyed the lanterns. The survivor-survivor dynamic had some weird twists sometimes. Like taking a long time to unhook (or even letting someone die) to leach their lantern or even exposing immersed lantern babies (bet your ass I betrayed you with Bond).
---
From killer side, sometimes I used Wraith or Insidious, or trapped lanterns to bait survivors.
---
The grind was bad though.
---
How did she get back there?
---
How come ? I used it for a day and found a lot of use to it. That’s a solid build ngl but playing on new characters you don’t have everything
---
Yesss
---
Nah, when I was hooked the second time, he stood to the side and waited for the last guy ( 2 of us left) to unhook me. He got hit and hooked and the guy was waiting again. I unhooked the guy, tanked the hit and he followed the guy I unhooked. Then he refused to hook him, so I did gens... eventually he had no choice and I saw the gate before and was able to get there before he could.
---
I hate ruin from both sides, It makes surv generators even more of a slog and its mandatory for killers.
---
Bamboozle always gets me as surv and sloppy is annoying but I wouldn't say I hate them.
---
&gt;As a survivor I hate these.
---
&gt;Self Care
---
&gt;Urban Evasion
---
&gt;Seriously these should not be perks they are way too essential not to use and are too good Not To Pass Up.
---
I hate them too, not because they're good (because they aren't) but because team mates fill their slots with these timewasting perks thinking they are good.
---
Then they spend half their playtime self caring and the other half urban evading around to avoid the killer - Making everyone else deplete their hooks first.
---
True, but not the most attentive since I play swf when I play survivor otherwise I play killer if I’m alone
---
Who hurt you
---
Is plunderers low key broken op? I just started running it as a solo survivor, and pretty much every match I have pulled a key out of a chest and made an escape after a spirit or nurse slaughtered my team. Some matches I have pulled two damn keys out of a chest. Why isn't every salty survivor in solo queue hell running this get out of jail free card perk?
---
as someone who sucks at spotting small, low contrast details, i thank you
---
it's why i'll never be good at nurse. only having a second or so to swing after blinking means i have to spot any possible target really quickly, and i just cant with how dark the game usually is
---
I've been getting a lobby within 30 seconds and 4 survivors within 1-2 minutes on Xbone, easily the quickest it's ever been. Which is super surprising considering it was during a bloodhunt which normally makes the killer queues insanely long.
---
Try playing as survivor 99% of the pallets are completely useless
---
Be sure to max out your controller sensitivity.
---
I'm trying a slow heals build on spirit using dying light, nurses, thanataphobia and sloppy butcher. Anything I should change?
---
We have the timer jump as well. It’s BS when you have that time left and it just jumps down
---
So many recreations of those tho. Like if you say Mummy, Dracula or Frankenstein you just think of your own version most of the time, instead of original movie adaptations.
---
Which killer is *Voldemort* again?
---
Wait,, you posted a Scoops Ahoy meme one time and someone got mad about Scoops Ahoy memes and I agreed with them but said yours was newish so it was okay and you thanked me, right?
---
i never said it NEEDED one, but the cooldown just feels like an organic limitation to the perk, not a "catch" like you say.  a lot of perks have cooldowns and that's totally fine.
---
This game. Extra awful today for my friends and I playing survivor. Killers spawning literal feet from us every game — Then they camp and tunnel. Time to uninstall?
---
I like that you used the Ninja Sex Party version of this song lol
---
Yeah, so nurses can basically block gens for 2 mins straight. Good call.
---
Oh haha nw :)
---
Yeah, it was pretty nice.
---
Bamboozle is anti skill, Noed is noed, Self care is a waste of time, Urban is urban, Sloppy and thana meta ect
---
What map
---
Does the entity give demo a garden to make friends with the other flowers in?
---
He’s really not 😂 Love my man ash
---
As survivor I can never find ruin but as killer it almost always gets popped within the first minute of the math and thus my perk slot was wasted.
---
u bought the console version 
---
u bought the pc version
---
and 3 months after u quit the game?
---
Catches are on almost all perks, they are needed. Some of the weaker perks don’t need it like some you listed but some do.
---
When Second Wind says that it doesn’t activate if you’re already Broken, does that mean if I try to use it with Deliverance, will it just not work at all? Or will it kick in after Deliverance’s Broken timer ends?
---
It wasn't bad for me. First game of the bloodhunt I played as Legion and found an awesome group of survivor Steves who wanted to farm. Coolest survivors i've seen to date. I'm newer to DBD and it was a nice breath of fresh air to get out of the toxicity for a little bit.
---
I even got Nea and Meg levelled up from 1-40 for their teachables. =)
---
No but thats why i said they could be reimagined for dead by daylight. They'd have the same lore or slightly tweaked lore but you could reimagine them however you want.
---
And now i want vlad the impaler as a killer
---
And then it turns out the hag was using insidious so the traps meant nothing. The 300 IQ plays.
---
Obviously
---
Oh so you mean lag. Well that makes more sense. The universal bullshit simulator especially in poorly optimized games.
---
What perks did you use?
---
Just dont go down.
---
It’s exceedingly inconsistent and won’t always yield keys, and even if you do get a key, you have to survive long enough to use it. Plunderer’s is fun, but anything but a get out of jail free card.
---
We celebrate... with another hunt.

Dark sense trash

I stopped using ruin about a week ago and noticed a huge improvement. I use a combination of thana/pop and find it way better.
---
Vroom vroom
---
Yeah, funny thing is I mainly got a PC just to play DbD
---
Sebastian from the Evil Within would be cool.
---
I wonder if the Wraith stun noise is him making an elephant sound or an effect on his voice.
---
I've used it for quite a while. So good against pretty much all killers but especially ones like the pig and spirit
---
Which event was the latnern thing? I thought it was the Moonrise event but wiki doesn't mention it. 
---
Also you are a bad bad man for sandbagging fellow survivors. :|
---
This comment made my day. Elephant noise is too accurate.
---
Art the clown and your next
---
Press "S" to shit your pants
---
Save The Best for Last would be horrible with Furtive because it requires you to hook your obsession, which in most cases would be losing 4 tokens of Save for 1 token of Furtive
---
As a ghost face main, I can confirm this is true.
---
It appears to be related to his ethnic background? That's the only justification I can think of. He's not really given a specific nationality, we just know he's a vaguely African immigrant whose add-ons imply Pagan imagery.
---
It’s never your fault, if you’re as god like as you say that’s an ez black pip or +1 at red ranks. So what’s the problem
---
In a swf lobby we have to restart the app after every game cos our lobby bugs out. PS4 is a mess right now.
---
Clear reagents are perfect for huntress and billy
---
I played a game as Clown where I defended three gens from four survivors for 30 minutes. Every time I hit one, they would flee into the corn field and two more would emerge. It was awful.
---
[removed]
---
They’re talking about struggling on the hook. Consistent Button mashing is key
---
Just know that 100 percent of the time, campers and tunnelers are awful at the game and have to use lame strategies to get 1 or 2 kills to feel good about themselves. S.a.l.t.y. that's all I heard from you.
---
Final boss of dbd storymode
---
As long as the killer lets us farm/get the points we need (during the bloodpoint event of course) then I’m perfectly ok with being mori’ed, it’s a fair trade. It’s when they want to mori you not even 5 minutes into the game...that pisses me off especially if I’m bringing BPS or the Gateu. Same with fellow survivors gen rushing while the event is happening...how are killers suppose to get any points if either side wants to just hurry? When the event is happening, both sides should want to work together so that we can both get as many points as possible.
---
Baby Dweet scared
---
I honestly don't see how cooldown on surge being a problem since it can't effect the same generators twice (unless someone stops the regression) but honestly the M1 only thing cripples it waaaay more so I'd be fine with just that
---
Also I don't really understand how tremors could be too strong without a cooldown. It doesn't block generators already being worked on, and if the killer is picking someone up every ~18 seconds, you're already fucked.
---
edit: also in response to "some catches are needed for certain perks" yeah I agree with that, I could have worded my title better since the word "weird" is vague. I more meant the perks that feel like they don't need a catch at all, but do for some reason.
---
Even if this was a good meme, I'd still downvote you for watermarking it.
---
Self care and noed
---
Springtrap from fanaf
---
Lmao
---
Wait, I not supposed to watermark memes?
---
I love it, his power seems underwhelming though, maybe more than an aura revealer. Plus the perk where birds attack people sounds awesome!
---
It seems like an inefficient use of a perk slot, it's two perks that work against each other, which would ruin a normal 4 perk combination that works hand in hand
---
Haha keep dreaming
---
They don't flare their posts so there's no way to filter them.
---
That explains it. The guy must’ve been new, since the “I’ll get you banned” thing generally only comes from new players. This isn’t exclusive to DBD, either. It’s something I’ve noticed in many games.
---
It's tagged appropriately as meta, idiot.
---
Yeah it seems 90% of the perks are just filler they made with random garbage code so they'd have something to go with their model.
---
You're right.
---
I never said you should. The mods should just ban people who make meme posts without flairing it.
---
Hell if I know, she just said she glitched
---
Ad hominem.
---
LMFAO
---
Being immersed doesn’t mean that you play stealthy. I’m immersed and I run around rubbing my balls all over the killers possessions as I would do if I was there. I’m so immersed that I don’t save people off hooks as I know it will cause them to bleed out as there is a fucking hole in their upper chest. Better leaving them on until you get the correct medical attention.
---
Than isn't a good perk.
---
To be fair someone got healed, not really an excuse but still.
---
Me playing against snot nosed entitled survivors that think they're funny, trying to gen-rush me, a rank 10 while they are all rank 1's and 2's.... "I'm suppose to feel sorry for that bitch? I don't.."
---
I’m full blood Native and I approve of this idea. But if the Native gets their own killer so should every other race. The Viking killer... the Shaman... the Aztec killer so on and so on
---
Soo what you're assuming I camp becuase I said hook diving survivors are stupid? 
---
I'm a rank 1 spirit buddy I dont camp. I also play a lot of survivor and hate campers as much as you. I was just pointing out it's very easy to counter because it's a dumb strategy.
---
Or you could just be a crybaby and call people "salty" when you're the one whining lol
---
That's the beauty of the huge selection of perks though-- you'll rarely need all 4 perks to succeed every single game. 
---
Personally, I sometimes pick setups that I think could be fun, unexpected, but also effective to a degree. 
---
Everybody expects Dying Light &amp; Remember Me, but who expects STBFL &amp; Remember Me? You get speed stacks, but if you have that obnoxiously good obsession always in your view, then you still get something from hitting them. :)
---
Not the coolest example, I know, but my point is it could become less fun much faster if you're going for the obvious every time.
---
Yes! I'm going as the hag.
---
I know I know it's messed up and a complicated situation
---
3head
---
I main killer and this ^
---
I don’t agree with surviving every game but if I facecamp someone for *whatever* reason I’m always blown away when nobody finishes a gen.
---
Here's a killer that has relied on blood lust for way too long. Blood lust was a band-aid to fix infinites, which no longer exists now. #RemoveBloodLust
---
Hillbilly also is a very sympathetic killer. Even more so than Wraith.
---
honestly like seriosly honestly the killers set cannot be completed without jason godamn we need him so the circle will be complete but for now i would roll with human chucky(aka before transformation) and have his power i dunno something invole putting puppets as some kind of cam which can be changed with add on as i dunno something harmful or something more passive
---
That’s an escape and you get the achievement, I think you’re a bit confused
---
Same
---
The idea is that since a top tier killer can down people pretty quickly they could keep gen progress at a halt. If they don't touch the gens then they regress, if they do touch them then they will get hit by surge. IDK maybe that wouldn't be that bad, but I think it should have a cooldown.
---
With tremors if your downing people reall quickly with no cooldown on tremors than you either going to be trapping them on one gen for a time, or continuously blocking them off of gens. Thrilling tremors is pretty good as it is now IMO.
---
anyone wanna bet the cam cut out because at the end they fucking nailed the wall with their head?
---
So playing demogorgon.
---
I find this Claudette and hook in the basement. Put a portal on the steps and  by the door and leave to try and bait more people. Maybe I get a double hook.
---
As soon as I leave I see a guy and hurt him and claud is unhooked, but  I’m there and so is claud, so I hit and rehook and leave.
---
As soon as I leave someone else comes so I’m like aww shit here we go again. Go back down hit the rescuer and she saves claud. Both still nearby, I hit claud and she’s got borrowed time so I’m like w/e savior is still below and I had downed them. So I hook them.
---
I check my portal up top with my power to see if someone else is behind but wouldn’t you know it claud was hiding in the locker. I come up grab and rehook and then bam dc.
---
To me it just sounds like you’re desperate for attention
---
Best P3 IMO is either Quentin's or Adam's, both just look so good

Nope, it doesnt increase rarity of items from chests
---
Well I pmed the teammate and was talking to them for awhile and felt bad, so I asked why they dcd
---
micheal myer have an add on(which is the best add on in the game in my opinon) which make him when he reach tier 3 he can just legit yeet while you are full health not injured FULL HEALTH and kill you like you be standing still and he just grab your neck the catch is its pretty hard to get tier 3 with that add on
---
And you message him about it? Are you really that desperate?
---
Those are the recovery add ons right? I use them too, they’re so strong. Plus most perks work well with him, I’ve been prestiging him due to blood hunt so I’ve been using weird as builds and they all work at red ranks, even with shit perks. He’s in a good position atm
---
Fuck adrenaline
---
There *is* a perk that lets them see when someone enters the basement (Territorial Imperative - one of Huntress's) but it's so rarely used that you usually don't have to worry about it.
---
Yea, when she’s passive phasing, or even idling her face goes from hatred to feeling pure agony. Even if she’s busted AF and super unintuitive to play vs, I love her in the game.
---
AYAYAYA
---
You sound dumb dude.
---
Talked to their teammate because the rest of the match was fun and I felt bad and wanted to know what was up.
---
If this is hated, then I’ll take my lumps.
---
What you did counts as “tunneling”, but everyone can play by their own rules.  I always like to think that it fucking sucks being the person who just got unhooked and doesn’t even have a chance to run away cause they got downed, so I go for the person who unhooked.  But you are the killer the game goes by your rules ^_^

Don't appeal to me about logic. Logic is just, 'if this, than that.' "If you guess wrong it results in a hit." I broke it down to the simplest level even the common redditor such as yourself could understand, your inability to follow along is no one but you, and that pink ball of puss and un-connected neurons in your head's fault.

Steam still has internet. I'll keep trying

You already told him he ragequit, that's not asking.

He was on his deathhook according to your story, I don't understand why you care so much - He was dead anyway.

So great to just stop and watch their gears start turning. Lol

It blows my mind how many killers double back at cars.

It's not even tuesday! Dammit Steam!

---
Very possibly it’s cause they are going to prestige the character and want to use the good stuff before they lose it. I’m ok with that as long as I get the opportunity to get some blood points before the mori happens
---
Well I'm not an oinker, I find them annoying too. But that thing about only being nerfed once is inaccurate. I just like this format and wanted to share with the community.

I think most male characters have a lot more blood and look a lot better
---
Yes they are. He's definitely the most work oriented killer next to trapper. Maintaining that constant pressure and just being so unpredictable to waste their time is so fun
---
How long does it take to do a gen with the latest iterations of Dying Light and Thanataphobia (combined and separate) and what about Freddy's addons Swing Chains and Jump Rope?
---
The way I see it haunted grounds is strongest totem perk because of shite totem spawns.
---
Nancy is the more main character *even if she’s worse and a bitch in the show* and Robin was only in S3.  Nancy makes more sense
---
Oh lol, that's awesome! Glad to have cleared any animosity between us, if you ever wanna play some DbD just let me know, I'd love to.
---
Chuky I would buy that on all plataforms
---
Those 2 minutes felt like 2 hours lmao
---
Due to you being a brick wall, I did mention the restart and it’s a console problem.  It is your shitty PS4. Consoles are struggling to reach 60fps on dbd. Many problems with DBD. Just get a pc
---
She's meme gold now.
---
Welp I checked and there's a server outage in only one place in the entire tri state and it happens to be in my city.
---
Also worth noting that it's only if you quickly leave the chest. If you let go of the button but let the animation play of closing it again first, it won't give a loud notification.
---
Racism
---
I figured he would have tried to stick around and support his group or something if they were in chat. I’m not sure how survivor works as I only play killer.
---
I would pay for a separate Myers with these animations
---
This happened with my friend and I last Saturday, too! What the hell, steam?!
---
Oof ouchie my lumpies.
---
Can we just mention that Bruce Campbell was the only one to return to voicing his character for DbD
---
Good lad, maybe because DBD is more demanding in terms of spec. DBD came out 2016 and has regular updates and you expect a 6 year old console to run it?? You’re on very out dated cheap specs.  Epic games and Treyarch/infinity are stacked on cash mate. Unless you want your game to look like a potato and take up 100+ gb like cod.
---
Nah, you're good, just didn't want anybody else to get spoiled since I've seen a few people say they're just starting the show after the Chapter.
---
A Part 2 Stranger Things chapter with Season 4 could be cool though.
---
Spirit, billy, nurse, basically any killer with high mobility. Those two plus haunted grounds create a build called "I could end the game in a minute".
---
What's worse in my Situation is that I finished the Game, had to restard, lost the Bloodpoints, Played another round and It happend again!! For 2/3 Times.. Now i'm just thinking if it's even worth playing in the moment
---
shit
---
Definitely. More frequent hunts would not hurt my feelings.
---
There was a bloodhunt?
---
Well i dont like the man criticizing him for bullying the killer but this guy gloating that he can bully a baby killer is just pathetic, like i said just because you can loop a killer thats obviously a noob doesnt mean youre a god at loops
---
Yeah I only started watching because of DbD as well and I kinda knew he'd die because the devs once explained why they choose Steve and Nancy and e.g. Jim because of his Death.
---
It'd be so awesome I would love to see it hopefully this post gets enough attention. I NEED JIM!
---
Oh man. It probably ate both offerings you burned too.
---
But yeah, that's probably a good idea. I was going to try another round, but if it happens again I'll be extra pissed, so I better stay away till Wednesday.
---
70 percent of the time I see someone uses Bond, they lead the killer to other survivors. 
---
It’s probably not hateful, probably just one of the things that make Baby Dwight a stereotype.
---
The broken bits of them after you cleanse them.
---
I suppose I can see the frustration with a zero cooldown surge. The M1 thing 100% has to go though...
---
I think I still disagree with Tremors though, mostly because it procs on pick up not downing and only lasts 16 seconds. If the killer is picking someone up, they still have to go hook them and honestly that whole process eats up like half the time, then they have to down and once again, pick someone up again. So it's a lot less snowbally than say, infectious fright. If anything, maybe have the cooldown just be as long as it's duration so you can't indefinitely keep gens blocked.
---
I would just love for there to be more game slowing perks that aren't ruin. But of course you can't make them too strong or everyone would just run...both...
---
I like this idea. You know a guy?
---
Meaning they didn’t design them right in the first place, because there’s no balance
---
Signed. He my favorite human character in the show (I like that he punches everybody)
---
Wraiths can be tricky
---
God, I'm so sorry to both of you!! Luckily I've been doing some reorganizing and KonMari-ing with my clothes all afternoon so I'm REALLY glad I didn't stop to play dbd! I hope y'all's days/nights get better, at least!
---
Small Game, Inner Strength, Adrenaline and Borrowed Time (optional).
---
BT can be replaced with Jeff's perk to break down hooks if you aren't feeling very friendly
---
what the fuck is even going on in that video
---
hm. I actually never have had that issue
---
lol, good one
---
I did before he got lock up. However they legalized weed in Illinois a few days later, lucky break!!
---
I know, rite?
---
i completely forgot that existed
---
Playing as survivor and i get a claudette crouching in a corner, jake breaking hooks and a meg just walking while doing nothing. I switch to killer and 2 or 3 gens get completed as i hook the first person. What i have  to do to get those survivors in my team? :(
---
Same, I got Lasik and had to stay away from screens. Hope we get another event soon!
---
Dude why are you being like this Tsonnyd. You know the only solution to your complaints is dedicated servers? Til then try and invest in a PC i think what this Aceinthehole guy is saying is 100% accurate
---
I've had 5-10 minute killers queues all month on Xbox
---
Springwood if that helps.
---
No perks have shown up in my last three bloodwebs on my level 50 Kate. Is that normal? PS4 if that matters
---
You can obviously tell that this killers a noob and i laugh how this guy pretty much said in the title that he was doing god loops when all it was, was him bullying a baby killer
---
A little bit
---
Man I always get in immediately. Does having all the dlc have anything to do with it?
---
Jason for sure, and I'd like more original characters then I want more licensed. 
---
I know the licensed is what brings in the bacon but I'm still hopping for an OG Jack the Ripper variant, I want a pirate ghost or some shit,  a manaquin killer, hell I want a killer with a chain hook attack like what's his name from that Nightmare high school game.
---
As someone who appreciates and shares your sentiment for wanting to be non-toxic, let me first say good for you. You’re awesome. ♥️
---
Tunneling has been confirmed time and time again by the Devs not to be illegal in terms of game design. 
---
That being said, people often forget that the person getting tunneled isn’t just Entity fodder or BP, but another person trying to enjoy the game. How you play is 100% up to you. As the killer, you have the ability but not the obligation to ensure everyone has a good game. 
---
Here’s what I do in my attempt to not piss anyone off:
---
If I see someone making a save right in front of me, and I can’t get the grab, I will hit the hooked survivor assuming there is BT. That way, I can still slow down the game a bit while they mend. If they go down because the rescuer did NOT have BT, I will leave them. Survivors usually hate being slugged but it’s better than the alternative, the way I see it, but I will allow them to at least get picked up. Both possibilities give me game slowdown without feeling like a meanie. Besides, D-strike, in my opinion, exists to help against campy killers, NOT toxic teammates. I will always pursue the rescuer to punish them for Insta-saves. Many insta-savers do it because they expect the killer to take the easy target and that behavior should be punished. It’s unfortunate but so much of survivor salt is directed at the killer but actually caused by teammates. 
---
TLDR;
---
Killers, don’t forget survivors are people too. 
---
Survivors, don’t screw over your teammates.
---
Was it a Steve
---
Yea but what if a Killer plays as Spirit and a Surv as Rin? Whouldn't make sense, tho maybe as a Killer giving her somehow a outfit on how she was before she was as a Killer
---
Specially good if you are playing with either Pig or Ghostface and the survivor was teabagging during the whole match. Payback is a bitch!
---
That’s salty lips lucky!
---
Agree I absolutely love the port and have spent everyday just playing on switch XD. It's too convient to play on the go lol.
---
They should have just extended this one tbh, but hopefully a halloween event happens to make up for it.
---
How is it fair for 3 survivors to spawn on a gen? Killer has a 50/50 go left or right from spawn. Pick wrong and a gen is done less than a minute
---
That's why you're upset right now over making awful assumptions.
---
Your rank means nothing, just remember you're the one getting angry over being called out. 
---
You can tunnel and camp all day. I could care less.
---
Steve and Nancy weren't a couple in 3, which is what is hinted at here. Jon woulda been better with that logic. They also didn't fight a demo in the 3rd season.
---
Thank you! 
---
Looks like my evening is planned out for me.
---
Myers and Jason are practically the same
---
Well, sure.  But OP made mistakes too.  That's why I took it as OP was kinda joking in the title
---
U can’t even make vigil sound useful
---
LOL I picture the demo swearing and hitting those crushed cars in frustration. "*motherFUCK!"* **\*crash\***
---
One more thing: r/weed, a good blunt make this game fucking insane to play.
---
Wow just makes me want it even more
---
It kinda isn't tbh
---
I could have understood Jim and Billy, or maybe even Alexi
---
It’s kind of an info perk - if the gens don’t go white you know where to hunt for the survivors next (bbq can also do this ofc). Maybe if it worked but lit them yellow instead of white, would make it stronger
---
Yea true it wouldn't make sense but it'd still be a pretty cool thing to have in the game I think
---
Hey as a new player I see “noed” a lot what’s it mean?
---
Here we go again, games like this never have balance. I don’t get what you don’t understand about that. All games of similar ideas like characters, perks, weapons. They all get regular fixes.
---
I don’t think so, nurture made him worse but I think there’s got to be some serious nature in there as well.
---
Dude running away and hiding is hard enough with the sound notifications, blood trails, scratch marks, and all the tracking perks, if youre saying survivors are too op now you must really suck at any game because right now with these hitboxes, pretty much all survivors can do is this, without it its pretty much you get found minus well dc since youll just get tunneled and/or farmed off hook
---
my takaway from this is that killers i didn't know made noises make noises.
---
Yeah all it says is helps your teammates and u lol
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dblyfe/found_an_interesting_nurse_glitch_when_doing_a/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I am deceased 💀
---
Am i having a stroke?
---
Mhm I know, I made it
---
It’s only normal if you’ve unlocked all perks on kate
---
yeah but jason honestly way more brutal
---
And vigil is kind of okay but not really.
---
I think Jason and Pinhead will complete it for sure
---
There nothing to say the picture says it all.
---
He was born disfigured and as a result, was literally held captive behind a brick wall and fed through a hole, once freed he was feral and murdered everyone in his family.
---
Compared to Wraith who unknowingly killed hundreds and ultimately brutally murdered the man who put that guilt on him.
---
Edit: Also to have sympathy for Huntress and not Hillbilly is ridiculous.
---
People are saying that pennywise wont be next killer since theres already a clown but we got these 2 boyos?
---
Have you seen the hag’s mori?
---
PS4 IS STRAIGHT POOPY STINKY MAN GET AN XBOX
---
Don't care about the joke. I need that rave Halloween music!
---
Now this, is quality.
---
MoM was badly designed as it was but it's absolutely worthless as it is
---
It should proc off safe unhooks and protection hits like WGLF because not everyone will be able to get them, unlike old MoM where literally everyone running it WOULD get it each match
---
Is double bp event over? If not how much longer does it go for?
---
This is a build I've been tinkering with, and it is a ton of fun, and super effective.  It works because it blows survivors minds, lol.
---
Bizzaro Myers:  
---
Perks:  Monitor and Abuse, Distressing, Coulrophobia, and Infectious Fright
---
Add Ons:  Dead Rabbit and either Tuft or Hairbow
---
T1 is pretty standard.  Monitor keeps you low, and Distressing only adds 1M to his terror radius (until you're in a chase, obviously.)
---
T2:  Still kept in check with Monitor and Rabbit.
---
T3:  Monitor and Rabbit kick into full effect with boost from Distressing, and then Infectious Fright immediately turns the field into a full on slaughterhouse!  Coulrophobia keeps them in line, and Myers goes Super Saiyan!
---
For maximum effect, dont down anyone until T3, and make sure you let them fix a few gens, and run you around, and get full confident. 
---
Then watch that confidence turn into full blown panic, lol!
---
I like it but imagine the outrage tho
---
Also, grinding a character is just more time efficient than grinding for shards.
---
\*also you\* : runs noed
---
true actually
---
Yep, a good blunt make "getting into character" better as killer main.
---
Combine with NOED and insidious, you can make survivors shit their pants
---
Fast vault out of the locker once the perk is lit up
---
Meanwhile I'm wondering why they couldn't get Sally Hardesty or booty shorts Pam for Texas Chainsaw.
---
Also this is amazing.
---
ive never heard anyone frown upon using the shrine for bloodpoints, everyone buys perks  they already own from the shrine to get bloodpoints
---
How do you fast fault?
---
I play on console btw
---
Just buy them in bloodweb
---
I would understand if like everybody was there or if he didnt get any readings from bbc n chili but if hes just gonna plain out face camp you thats just pathetic gameplay and he/she should really consider playing games more their type like mario or playwith a rubix cube(sorry if mispelled)
---
Yeah but I’m talking about getting perks you need.
---
You like playing against myers?
---
Oh ok. Thank you!!
---
You gotta remember some of the perks you want are locked behind a paywall, and BHVR does need money. I understand it's hard to grind, but they are trying to make it as fair as possible without losing out too much themselves.
---
It looks great
---
Just don't get hooked.
---
The survivor sized killers are hilarious to me. He’s just a guy. Grab his arm and table the knife. There’s four of you and one of him.
---
havent heard his yet though people tell me it sounds like a female scream... my issue is with meg and claudette but im sure theres more that are messed up too
---
Give him a shot with play with your food, basically a backrev billy that doesn’t miss
---
Carrie would be really awesome maybe have that boy from the shining be the survivor so we can have a Steven King chapter. Plus having a psychic killer and a survivor with "The Shine" would be cool.
---
Candyman would be very unique
---
Hellraiser because kinky sex chains
---
Pennywise would be nice but the only power I could see him using would be shapeshifting
---
Diana from lights out would be pretty cool but very random
---
Samara but her ability would probably be too similar to the Dr's
---
Kyoko/The grudge Yes I would love a creepy contortionist lady to slowly crawl towards me.
---
T-bag at every pallet, and face camp every survivor that loops you for more than 30 seconds.
---
My bad, I thought I saw somewhere that the voice for bubba also did trapper and Myers, guess I was wrong.
---
"Servant of the Serum"
---
Right? It's odd but I'm glad we got S C O O P S and Inner Strength. (Also, Thank you)
---
My thoughts would be 
---
Legion in a group 
---
Spirit, nurse, pig, etc.
---
Ghostface with Myers / oinkers because s t e a l t h
---
And then trapper, wraith, all the sensible ones
---
Clown because nobody wants to be sick with all those germs in the air (not plague) plus he brought his caravan to just sleep and what not
---
Overall I think it’s a line between sensible to who is and isn’t killing what they know are survivors
---
Regarding looping and pallets, try not to instadrop or wait by a pallet. Everything else is like chess, you know the rules and how to play, but the strategy is different every game. GL!
---
The trouble with your question is that DL and Thanat all have levels. I.e. every token of DL adds a percentage, every person wounded has a percentage.
---
Thanat adds 4% per injured person, to a max of 16%.
---
Dying light adds 3% for every token.
---
Do you ghost the stream?
---
Inner Stregth is a god send but I think it's triggering the Claudette mains because it weakens botany knowledge and invalidates self care.
---
Don’t come with disrespect.  A similar game design, believe it or not, is Rainbow 6 Siege.  Different characters with unique weapons and abilities, yet they were designed in a balanced and fair way, such that no operator is too favorable over another.  They introduced multiple different ways and approaches to achieve the same objective with different characters (abilities).  So yes, it is possible to establish balance in “games like this.”
---
I feel like Joe Kerry would have been more than happy to voice Steve. I mean they got Bruce Campbell
---
Not yet, hoping I never do :c
---
I do whatever I can to make the game unfun for streamers I get against. They wanted content when they put TTV in their name so they get content. If they complain  then they should take TTV out of their name because it means that they have good enough content.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit: Just so you know if any of you downvote. Downvoting doesn't change my mind and  I will continue to do this. Hell, not even any of you saying what you think about this will make me stop being unfun for streamers.
---
Because in an old John Carpenter film(the director for the Halloween movies) when the killer was carrying the main character over their shoulders, the main character grabbed a shard of glass that was taken from the broken window, and stabbed the killer with it to escape their grasp.
---
&gt;You can’t make the argument “well actually a good survivor wouldn’t fall for a killers mind game” because I could just say “a better killer can our mind game a good survivor.”
---
There are only so many mind games that can be played. Example Killer shack
---
Your looping doorside, the survivor just ran in, you could A. Just follow him, he vaults and your wasting time. B pause and back track, the survivor isnt braindead and looks behind him and noticed the stain disappear(and even if you pause for a second, most survivors will notice if you didn't arrive at the doorway at the time you were supposed to) C. Double back and follow him palletside, he may or may not take a hit and will just run to another loop, he can drop pallet, or he can eat a hit and keep looping shack. 
---
Sure, any of the above mindgames have potential, but speaking from my experience as both a killer and survivor, most of the time they dont.
---
&gt;Come back to me when you can think for yourself and come up with your own argument, not “oh streamer A says this”
---
I include what streamers say because most of the time, the moron I'm arguing with just says "lol git gud scrub, xyz is ez mode" the other half is just like you and ignore what some of the best DbD players have to say because "it worked for me once at rank 15, so it works 100% of the time"
---
Also, have you never written a paper, like for any HS English class or college? You form an argument then use evidence to back up your argument, this includes what other people have to say. For example, Mark the FBI guy says that sometimes flashbangs cause burns to the skin and should only be handled by trained professional.
---
What's that? Ghosting the stream? I mean I tune in and then I leave when they get mori'd.
---
Getting corned by Leatherface is a nightmare.  I just look away and accept my fate.
---
I find games instantly, always have. Survivor queues take forever for me though, and that has also never changed. Weird really.
---
The general consensus right now seems to be that killer queues are broken, so you're not alone.
---
Miss a skill check and the generator turns into a hook
---
Funny you use the old picture for Quintin. But man, the VA for Spirit, Huntress, and so many of the other killers knocked it out of the park
---
NP, bud. See ya in the Fog. :)
---
Added music and extended the dance. I'm not taking credit this wasnt mine I just thought I'd add that's why I said whoever made this comment on here he is a legend
---
You know what, I hate you for making this and making me love Steve and his stupid screams even more. Take my upvote.
---
This happened to me, except Claudette was tbagging two feet away from escape zone. I ran up, e3d, then tombstoned her as she was turning to escape. Should have just ran for it.
---
Also as a ghost face main I agree
---
Do you watch the stream while they're still alive? So you know where they are at all times.
---
Now I want a fan fiction where Frank and his friends just fuck with everyone.
---
*seinfield theme starts playing*
---
Holy fuck that scream is hilarious! Perfect combination
---
Would have loved it more had it been 4 Dwights
---
No I just treat everyone the same like a normal person.
---
So typical for Nancy mains. Gets the healing points for themselves and then leaves you for the wolves so they can come and collect the unhook points.
---
Same here. When a survivor does a 360 turn I’ll just hold onto the hit button and do the same too and it always work.
---
0
---
Anyone else try to focus on killing the selfish survivors? You know, the ones hiding, not doing gens, not unhooking, the ones camping by hatch,,, and Let escape those who put themselves in difficult situations with you (killer) to help their teammates?
---
It feels good. It’s like you are restoring and balancing justice. Playing god.
---
Is there a reason to Prestige your character?
---
Imagine unironically saying that a core feature of the game is experience-ruining. If someone didn't want to be mori'd, they should play a different game.
---
Great job, is this the 47391746th variation of this meme so far?
---
Legion
---
One of the few killers that could possibly exist in the real world and I feel that dodging a hatchet is much easier than evading a bunch of hermornal teens doing parkour everywhere.
---
In the game Hillbilly terrifies me.
---
As someone that has recently started to play survivor frequently, I don't know how y'all have put up with the fast vault hitboxes for so long. 
---
I really hope the dedicated servers lessen the issue, as l imagine it is mainly ping that is causing the bullshit.
---
It disappears if it was cleansed after it pops. Otherwise if all totems were cleansed it wont show up at all. The only thing I can think of is that you had some perk active that would negate that. Like borrowed time if someone saved you and then got moried. But it isnt borrowed time.
---
Quick suggestion for you and it’s entirely optional but I have done something similar before and nurses calling is great. Definitely try it sometime
---
What Killer was it? Certain secondary attacks trigger the notification but won’t apply the effect and insta-down you.
---
Yeah I don't care imma still say what I want because clearly you do. At first I thought out we're being sarcastic but no you are genuinely a shitty person. They put ttv in their name to get their name out there and be known, they clearly enjoy streaming and you're just an asshole if you want to discourage them from wanting to do something as harmless as streaming
---
She’s honestly very passionate about her cause and I respect her for that
---
Right.
---
I’ve always wanted to get a swf team of vigil, balanced, dead hard, and something of their choice. We would all just huddle together and recover exhaustion 60% faster. But nobody buys Quentin.
---
Was the killer a huntress? I’ve been hit by a hatchet and not insta downed even tho the noed popped up as I got hit
---
This might be the most depressing series of comments I’ve seen on Reddit, and that’s coming from someone who follows mostly porn subreddits lol.
---
I’m an idiot because I stopped doing something that I didn’t enjoy? Makes sense.
---
This happened to me minus the toxicity. I was just trying to get my adept for Laurie 🥺
---
Im surprised no one talks about mad grit. It bothers me to hell that killers attack without cooldown and use it to travel 3/4 of the map with it. That plus iron grip and they absolutely can take you to the other side of the map with no problem at all.
---
Not much of a reason but there are higher chances to get rare perks such as leader or DS. It also gives you a bloody cosmetic!
---
Let the joy of love, give you cancer!
---
I’m a ghost face main but recently switched to legion, so here’s advice ~~legion isn’t that bad~~ stalk first. Only on hard to see maps though like cold wind. I’m bright red ghostface but I still get stalks in
---
Last time i got saved was around the begining of the match so couldnt have been borrowed time. Weird
---
Based on the Stranger Things Wiki and judging by the fact that Behaviour said that they based most of the DLC on Chapter 2, Nancy would be the same age as Laurie and Steve would be a year older. This does mean that Steve is the only Survivor who's (officially) 18 though.
---
Would this be an exhaustion perk?
---
I mean i think the point was that you basically just do this because they are streaming and them only. You change your build when you see someone with TTV in their name. 
---
Therefore you want to ruin their experience on purpose just for your own gain to see how they react on stream. Which is toxic.
---
The scariest killer? Easy. The lag and connection errors frighten the shit out of me. 
---
*shudders*
---
It's like a 90% chance they'll do it. I just think it's funny when they do it to me.
---
Tbh I always thought Bill was a pitched voice McCote lol
---
Take Perks over Power. Perks help in the long run, but power is only limited!
---
A few killer abilities notify you of NOED even though they don't trigger the insta down. Legion frenzy's, Demogorg lunges, I believe pig dashes might not, stuff like that.
---
spirit is actually the worst
---
Im dumb, yeah it was the pig so probably used the lunge lol
---
He kinda looks like David Harbour
---
Hatchets don’t work on exposed effect. Only if it’s iridescent head add on
---
Excuse you
---
You took too long to react. Stood there for a solid second. You would have died even if she didn't throw the pallet.
---
No, it would be an asthmatic perk, you can only use it when exhausted and you have to recharge it by huffing on your inhaler in a locker.
---
What's wrong with lightborn?
---
No u are an idiot because u spend money for a game u stoped enjoy only 3 months after u start playing and u had a youtube channel for it
---
Demo is literally the best killer we've had since Spirit, what are you smoking
---
Yeah thats what I’m saying, OP could’ve been hit by a hatchet and thats why it showed up and didn’t insta down them
---
Oh yeah i recently prestiged and cant find spirit fury so im using nurses
---
Could but enduring saves more time
---
Well yes but treating a player worse because they want to live stream their game is a pretty shitty thing to do. Just let them enjoy their game, unless your scared of being publicly shown how shit you are as killer without meta perks
---
Yh pig dash doesn’t one shot even when exposed
---
Eagle eye needs to be, As the crow flies.
---
Love the idea of more interaction with the crows on the map. So many people just run through them without thinking.
---
Am I just completely blind or is Inner Strength not on the list? Can someone tell me where it is please?
---
It hasn't it will probably be a few weeks unfortunately.  They will probably fix the rank issues first.
---
Update: so I just checked my email for the ticket I filed and they said they are now looking into it. Fingers crossed and I'll keep you updated.
---
Bruh. It’s a child.
---
Nancy did you dirty
---
I can loop the killer for 5 minutes, which is enough for all gens to be done, but usually half a gen is done in this time and then the teammate saves me in front of the killer like a fucking idiot, so I die early because the killer obviously make the right decision and go for me
---
I run both, MLGA is useful for watching what the ping is like
---
I go for grabs bc its more fun but if the game is getting near the end ill stalk to 99 and worry about gens
---
Also legion is okay but easily bullied thus putting him lower
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDRAEktIJWA) was what I envisioned your killer theme to be as you delivered your comment. It's loud but not as bad as the survivor screams in DBD.
---
Pig is evil
---
Deja vu should be too, who agrees.
---
I didn't even realize what had happened before it was too late. And I understand I would've died but the reason I was under the pallet was so the killer would pick me up and someone could pallet save. Nancy had no reason to insta heal me and drop a fucking pallet in me.
---
Camaraderie, Boil Over, Vigil, Sabotuer all in ghe mid tier?
---
I don't think so buddy. Those perks are trash. Stick em down there with Monstrous Shrine.
---
What if instead they made it so all of her traps were different. So first trap you put on a survivor would be a random one, and it would keep tossing a coin until all 4 unique traps were set. Too bad the Game Over timer kills someone once in 100 games.
---
no, I just forgot X) but it is in red for information
---
Don’t try to make jokes here, you’ll get downvoted
---
I’ve been playing (solo) survivor and killer about even and I’m really confused about the double standards in the game but especially this sub. Why is the  killer optimally pursuing victory is often considered toxic, but survivors doing anything to win is considered fair?
---
There’s so many posts shaming things like tunneling, picking the few viable killers, not giving hatch, or using certain addons. 
---
For example survivors seem to shame tunneling as toxic despite it being optimal and easily counter-able even for low rank players (DS or borrowed time). Survivors abusing certain mechanics like balanced landing windows, locker decisive strike, 360, or near endless loops are considered valid strategies despite most having no counter especially for most low-mid rank players except giving up.  Mori is toxic but syringes and Brand new parts are valid.
---
Hell the worst offense is 4 man with mics being considered fair play despite the game and many perks being literally being designed around no communication. Verbal communication breaks the game in so many ways yet I never see posts rightfully calling that out as BM or toxic. Why is using mics not called toxic despite it being far more unfair and impossible to counter than things like tunneling?
---
Yeah, it's amazing that Ash Williams voices Bruce Campbell

You could have unhooked when you got hit?

As you respond days later, like a trollin troll 🙃
---
Addons "Calm" carters notes, and either "restraint" class three (16m terror radius), "calm" class 2 (2 calms stack for 12m terror radius)
---
Perks, Monitor and abuse,  Save the best for last,  a choice of Hex: Ruin or Pop goes the weasel based on your preferences.  Last perk I'd suggest Sloppy butcher or Whispers but mostly anything works (whispers only being needed if you ran Both calm addons).
---
Just remember... you don't go patrolling for survivors in treatment mode like 98% of doctors.  You sneak up for gen grabs or an easy first hit.
---
That's the risk of NOED. Killers with zero map pressure and endgame sometimes have to rely on it.
---
What kinda thread??
---
Be prepared to change direction on a loop a lot. Killers like to keep changing direction to try and get you to over commit one side and get the hit in. Keep changing directions after a safe pallet drop and force the killer to break it If they try to bloodlust you. Dont loop unsafe pallets. Don’t camp pallets as most high rank killers will just swing straight through them, resulting in you dropping the pallet and getting hit.. a double killer win. 
---
As killer try and force the pallet down as early as possible, mindgame the unsafe ones and don’t waste significant chunks of time chasing through really safe loops ie. Autohaven main building with the double window and pallet, McMillan main building, Myers house on Haddonfield when survivor has BL if doubling back doesn’t work. Best advice at a loop I could give is chase the survivor in a direction that denies them the fast window vault.
---
It's super buggy and inconsistent atm so just don't expect it to work 100% of the time right now
---

Was Dwight just being a Dwight or is 2 the max number of survivors healing?

I'm new to the game and main Ash, his perks are indeed underwhelming. Which hurts my heart. I also wish he had more cosmetics.
---
So what you’re saying is that you suck at the game?
---
What perks are ideal for focusing on Gen Rushing?
---
*grabs popcorn for the incoming comments*
---
Not Veri funny, but I like the shoutout for chapkin
---
Nah with me I know how people work. I always have to hit first, spin in the direction they’re running so I see them when I’m done frenzy and run after them. It’s a way for me to keep them busy and not work on gens. 
---
Also grabs are good but I am bright red ghostface so hard there
---
I disagree
---
haha, that’s super funny. you must be a comedian. gee i can’t think of another way to say that.
---
You shouldn't be hit for the first time in any match. You should be taking your turn to get chased and hooked so your teammates aren't getting wrecked. There are designed killers with zero map pressure and zero endgame potential. There is no BE BETTER when the power role is survivor, not killer. A killer reacts to what is given to them.
---
&gt;&gt;the community is toxic

---
And it seems like you also can’t take criticism
---
I can’t say about other people, but my team and I sometimes just send friend requests to killers we play against.
---
Happened today, played against a spirit on autohaven, got downed to save a random, killer picked me up, the other random baited some hits while my brother sabo’ed the hook, everyone got out and the killer said "wow, that was amazing". Loaded into another lobby and there they were, playing as survivor. I added them and we played for a few hours. 
---
Basically just ask them, I know I love it when I find new people to play with!
---
Not scientifically possible!
---
We’re gonna live forever could probably be replaced with Kindred.
---
Why Kindred? Because in solo, you have 0 communication so people assume everyone else is going for the save. Also helps with survivors know which way the killer is heading.
---
shut up. “you’re bad at the game” isn’t criticism, this is an irrelevant post for that so just shut up
---
what is a good way to legion? still very new to the game and can't loop to well, but I'm wondering if there is anything besides looping I can do. I also have a bit of trouble with the plague, but she seems like you just need to get good at looping to counter.
---
Tbh this is the same for me and I’m rank 9 on PS4 this really pisses me off as it happened often
---
With practice comes skill. Some tips I would recommend is to not wait near pallets and loop the killer around. Once you drop a pallet don’t run away from it immediately. If it is a safe pallet, loop the pallet for as long as you can not get hit and then force the killer to break it. ( Again, practice makes perfect) I also recommend to not use all the pallets in one area because that would create dead zone for survivors, making the killer far more deadly. I also recommend, when unhooking, try not to do a one for one trade because that is a really bad idea, if you get hit before you make it to the killer, get the hell out of there and let someone else save them, except for when they are about to hit stage 2 or about to die on hook.
---
Yes, we must alert the masses that this exists... Can't believe something so simple has never been discovered before.

Wait there was a Bloodhunt?

Toxic is a way of people saying they don’t like something. And yes, I’ve learned that if you’re bad at the game you think the game is bad. I’ve experienced it. You might also be counting the people who dm you to say you’re trash, and the vast majority who don’t message you. No, the community’s not toxic. Also it’s a very shitty way to write a persuasive argument. You have to have main points, which you do have, but details. Also all the people on this sub are probably here because they play the game and like it
---
That's the way the GAME IS DESIGNED. TOLotems were brought about to slow the game down. NOED gives you an ultimatum. Do the totems or take a risk. The survivor experience is that they are the power role, not the killer. If you're being tunneled or camped that sucks. NOED is a survivor's own fault. Also, it brought back small game. I see that more often now. Killers are already forced to run RUIN and maybe BBQ. You don't like it, cleanse the totems. Its entirely within your control.
---

Shitty killer queue times and the fact in my at least 20 games, 0 survivors brought streamers when i was rocking survivor pudding or streamers every game.
---
This game is lacking thematically. I think a jingle for each map and chase music for was killer would really spice things up, and clean up the missing themes for this game. I made a few ideas for the legion. They were from movies and games but I felt that the chase music fit the legions theme and that the jingle fit the horrors that went on inside the lodge of mount Ormond. I think this jingle really fits the terrors that happened on the meat plant. Hopefully the devs can get the rights to some of the music. I intended for my map jingle to end once fully loaded.

not true. i’m a lot better then average considering i’ve been rank 1 4 resets in a row as of now, and both killers and survivors are extremely toxic. i don’t wanna waste my time on a game i’m good at but don’t enjoy
---
What you’re saying is that survivors are overpowered but in my opinion hey really aren’t. If you can’t take on a survivor this I will give you criticism over this
---
I was so confused at first because i was at the killer shack on the swamps right by the exit gate and I teleport and im the one escaping.
---
2 is the max when healing
---
Ye. Sneaky metal smellin boyo
---
Wow. Lotta babies on this sub, huh?
---
Ok well yes, in the higher ranks people are toxic. Just wait a month or two then jump back in the game. You might be reset to nontoxic rank. Have fun wherever you do
---
You can also see them doing this with killer powers like demogorgon you can teleport around a map with portals you place down *buuuuut* you have to be standing on them even tho you already have a cooldown and can be cleansed by survivors
---
No way the demo was dumb enough to pick you up with that many survivors around. He would have hit everyone then picked you up. The instaheal was a good idea. She was wrong throwing the pallet on you though.
---
Already on it. It’s the only way to cope with the toxicity with a laugh. Better jump scares too.
---
Edit: 
---
Wanted to add a question. 
---
So if M&amp;A works this way with IF, I imagine then that Surge would have a greater range as well?
---
Imagine unironically saying that getting hooked and then mori'd afterwards is experience-ruining and toxic.
---
“Better than average” and Rank 14 👀 interesting
---
Because Dead by Daylight doesn’t have hundreds of characters that need to have generic dialogue
---
Nah, you’re annoying
---
For the most part, I don’t run into a lot of toxic people. There are definitely bad parts of the community but I think there’s a lot of good people here too. Plus, I don’t really let strangers on the internet get to decide how I feel anyways
---
It’s not about the money or the YouTube channel. If I’m not enjoying something I’m not gonna do it regardless of the money or my YouTube channel.
---
thanks, i think i’ll just take a break from it, the game pisses me off because at low ranks killers are extremely overpowered, and at high survivors win every game
---
At times, it feels like that people think survivors should have the advantage. So doing all their toxic stuff is deemed okay. But anything a killer does to level the field? Nope, toxic AF apperantly. :/
---
I rescued someone when NOED was active, then cleaned NOED and made it out alive with no hits
---
Instaheal with killer right behind? Terrible idea. Especially when I had no idea she had the instaheal and wasn't ready for it at all

oh i’m definitely rank 14 better believe it

I was afraid she’d go down right after since I didn’t have borrowed time

I keep getting a 15304 error, either when I try to open the game or when I'm in the game. Is this me or the game?

Does lunging (holding basic attack) count as a basic attack for the purposes of no one escapes death?

Community is pretty wholesome at red ranks. You get the casual players that you keep coming across and win or lose it’s a gg. People stopped caring. We got rid off most the toxic fucks like the OP.

You’re an adorable chap. I hope you stick around

They need to release outfits like L4D, reskins for survivors we already have making them look like other characters.

How is that discouraging

They wanted content for their streams and that's how they get content: By being singled out and toyed with.

does everyone really disagree in proximity chat being part of the game? im a solo player that would benefit in being able to speak to my in game tm8s. i dont think that the possibility of players abusing the voice chat is enough reason to reject the whole proximity chat ordeal. there will have to be a mute option for anyone annoying. problem solved. no big deal. 
---
proximity chat would be amazing right? this is the perfect game for it. maybe for just tm8s. i dont need to listen to the killer.

Goddamn Steve mai s making me look bad. I just like the show because of the game dammit

You'll find posts on both sides of this, its not exclusively "survivor good, killer bad"
---
“Entity displeased?!! Bullshit!”
---
haha, non toxic red ranks. you’re cute, i like it. nice p3 dwight btw
---
Had 2 matches last night where the killer would DC as soon as the gens where done.
---
Then why you rescue like that without BT?
---
All of them. Facing spirit every other match fucking sucks.
---
The trick to plague is keep puking on them till they're broken, then whacking them once. Once you get corrupt vomit, then you just gotta spray and pray. Another tactic is to get everyone sick as quick as possible. Massive slowdown, etc. Plague is also useful with Monitor and Abuse, since she's right up on you before you know it. I'd say similar possibly with legion, esp because his mending doesn't kick in until you're out of his terror radius. 
---
The trouble with legion is that he's not very good in terms of killer, but he's really good for farming points.
---
Yeah, they hate it when you bully killers, none of these kids would’ve survived getting tbagged in the halo days, they’d have an aneurysm if they heard the things you would hear in a MW2 lobby
---
We share the same name so she’ll always have a special place in my heart
---
I run alert self-care dark sense and lithe/balanced - or if I’m feeling confident/cheeky - object, DS, urban evasion, self-care (mainly to let the killer get close and then sneak around so they can’t find me, it’s super fun but the second it’s a stealth killer I’m fucked lol), or replace urban with lithe/balanced if you want to get chased a lot
---
Mix it up with your perks and try not care too much about pipping, if you have fun it’s a win
---
Why are they celebrating, its not as if they won like the lottery or something
---
One where people just have to be assholes because someone likes a particular killer, the noises they make and the innocent terminology['oink']. Probably because someone was too obsessed with it to the point they made a whole subreddit and caused problems here. That person shall not be named though.
---
&gt;  but there are higher chances to get rare perks such as leader or DS.
---
Not really. The increase is fairly trivial to the point you won't notice it.

*AYAYAYAYAYAYA*
---
It’s not treating them worse or better. Is it a crime to want to do better in one match as opposed to another?
---
Bad play
---
I like the perk cancellation idea. Maybe it could be like little hag traps, where when you run over it, a random perk is disabled for a certain amount of time. It could be used to really shut down chases, because if they run over enough of them, their balanced landing might go down, or their DS when you get them down. And imagine taking away someone's Borrowed Time as there going for a risky save. Its a really cool idea!
---
Tbh wake up is already great. I run it with the perk that speeds up stuff while you’re hurt and I open gates fast af

Definitely not an excuse.

---
It really depends. If you put the killer into the right hands it will completely dominate survivors but if the killer gets a bad map or really good survivors it’s going to be a challenge
---
Whats your address?
---
I just want protection hits to work consistently. There's two different protection scoring events. One worth 200 points and one worth 100 points. The 100 points scoring even does NOT count towards MoM, but the 200 does.
---
I have no idea why sometimes you get the 100 point scoring event...
---
Yeah, that could work
---
As long as the Killer can't guarantee a hit (and later a subsequent hit) on all pallets without breaking them, you'll always have Nurses.
---
Survivors can waste too much time and unfortunately Killers lose a lot of chase momentum breaking a pallet.
---
This Ghostface was really bad, but I think Killers need to be able to hug loops like survivors do and for pallets that require breaking to be moved elsewhere.
---
Huh, well what do you know. Yours is also way better cause you cropped in the right faces and it isn’t water marked. If it makes you feel better I didn’t steal it, just had the same idea when I saw the picture. Sorry that yours didn’t do as well, because honestly it should have
---
Who else was just screaming at them to BREAK THE DAMN PALLET LMAO
---

Literally playing the game is content, and it's content they aim for. If they're being treated worse by toxic killers such as yourself they're not going to want to continue streaming because apparently having ttv in their name makes them deserve toxic punishment
---
What are you going to tell me next that I sleep on the wrong side of the bed?

I hate all stealth killers, because if I stop paying attention for half a second, DING DONG, im about to die.

Awesome! I’ll make sure to do that. Thank you!
---
Yeah must have been pig lunge like you mentioned earlier. Did you hear the sound, too?
---
Survivors have been nerfed so much since the game came out
---
Also what about survivor SPECIFICALLY do you find overpowered

You’re not an airplane departing the terminal there’s no need to announce your departure.

---
Ah, I see you found the leaked pig buff
---
As far as I can tell by interactions with you, I doubt that a "best build" wouldn't include meta perks in it. Tbh I just think you don't like being told you're a toxic player
---
Three hits in a two-minute-five-gens meta for the entire team with Adrenaline afterward (lol good luck denying Adrenaline when a common toolbox squad can three-man the gens in two minutes) and Borrowed Time + DS if you happen to hook one was obscene to play against though.
---
You barely needed safe pallets because of how fast generators did (and do) go past, but of course you had to deal with balanced landing and huge building loops and jungle gym spawns that are sometimes so ridiculously convoluted or have so many L-walls (up to 4 sometimes) and windows and pallets that you want to scream.
---
Ruin only helped/helps against bad survivors who don't hit Greats, it doesn't change the two-minute-five-gen if you can.
---
And then there's all the safe pallets and every time you break off a chase, the next one runs to the cowshed or the storehouse or the balcony or the central building (Plague's map, Huntress's map, Ormond, etc) and you start the ridiculousness all over again (and the survivor you were chasing hops on a gen, so your two minutes is still counting down).
---
Mettle should be reworked into something new entirely that doesn't ever give a third hit.
---
Break the pallet for 2 seconds or continue chasing on the loop that you are clearly unable to handle for a couple of minutes? This is a tough choice.
---
How can you say the game is repetitive as survivor on Friday when survivor gameplay on DBD is repair generator simulator to win. Friday seems way more in depth for playing survivor, while DBD is way more in depth for playing killer.
---
you don’t have to win the lottery to celebrate something
---
They won’t spawn together, you get points and goals and meh, sure a dc doesn’t help a lot but it can. And you were complaining about survivors spawning together? Here’s your band-aid fix, not helpful but it’s something
---
I can promise every single build that's not memey has at least one meta perk. Ruin, NOED, Nurse's.
---
I used a Nurse with I'm All Ears and Discordance. I hope that's not "sweaty".
---
Was my favorite trick that worked far, far more than it should've. They finally throw the pallet down, you come to a dead stop and pretend to activate, they slide back your way and you charge-slash to catch 'em before their feet touch the ground.
---
I know everyone has a post history genius
---
Trying to use it to invalidate what he's saying is what I'm criticizing

But that could be a 3k basement for the Spirit
---
Wolfman would be cool, maybe his perks empower bloodlust or something and some sort of mummy throwing pocket sand in people's faces would be cool, though some like horseman seem a little less intimidating and the classic movie version of frankenstein's monster is (mostly) kind yet brutish, and only really hates the doctor and his associates.
---

He's asking me if I still played this game. On it's official subreddit. Where he has an extensive post history on said subreddit.
---
^(But nah me calling him a hypocrite is worthy of criticism you're right)
---
I think most of the killers (who it applies to, like spirit, wraith, etc..) should have a none killer survivor version of themselves 
---
That would be so cool...
---
Taking big ol dumps over there
---
When is coming the next bloodhunt?
---
I do drive bys all the time when the Killer is slugging, especially if they try to hit me and get locked into the stun animation.
---
Survivor on the ground probably has their exhaustion perk back.
---
Once I had a slugging Pig and managed to pick all three people up with her chasing me without an instant-heal, having to stop at each one.
---
Two of them didn't get re-downed.
---
You DC so much you got muscle memory from it. Had to stop yourself from doing it lol
---
That would definitely be better than it is now, but to be honest I think there’s too many things in the game already that reward you for rushing unhooks. It’s annoying to see your teammates crowding around the hooks constantly instead of being productive.
---
Honestly I don’t think MoM by itself was that bad, the main problems with it were that it unfairly punished M1 killers because they had no way to counter it, and combining it with instaheals, adrenaline, exhaustion perks, etc. to get stacks way too fast and make chases last way too long.
---
I think it should be like how it was before, except it should get stacks from all ways of attacking survivors, from regular M1 attacks to chainsaws and vile purge, etc. In exchange for that, there will be a 30 second or so cooldown to get stacks, so you can’t just instaheal and get another free stack. Also, it will be an exhaustion perk, so you can’t use it after your dead hard or  adrenaline or whatever to get super long chases. When you take a hit with MoM, it should give you a special type of exhaustion that you can’t activate adrenaline during.
---
Kind of a long explanation, but I think it would be more balanced that way.
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH
---
Really needs Last Surprise in there.
---
Doing Jen, too?
---
Omg this is perfect
---
Even when he gets hit, Steve just kinda sounds...like...you know, a girl.
---
I actually don't usually but the past couple days I've been having awful lag - like game breaking lag - so I have been disconnecting a bit more than I'm proud of. But I was just so angry I got so close. Almost threw my keyboard lmao. But yeah, I did have to stop myself
---
Did you tell the killer he can hold the attack button down?
---
You're right dude my bad you win

Bad windows update, make sure you're fully updated. It's fixed now.

She'd count. Especially since she deviated from Jigsaw's true mission and made the traps/games inescapable. She was driven by anger over Jigsaw's death, and continued killing in a bastardized version of his games. This made her a killer who lusts for blood.
---
Or a Myers with 1% away from tier 3 and tombstone and they’re teabagging at the gate
---
Watch tru3 talents video on his ghost face build it’s how I think ghost face should be played too
---
Well I'm not gonna pretend it was high ranks. I'm rank 13 right now and honestly not the best survivor. I think I was just so stunned by the insta that I didn't think to pull the pallet down. But honestly this isn't even about my reaction, it's about how she dropped it while I was still behind her. She could've easily ran away without dropping it and she would've been fine. Even if she took one hit she still could've made it to safety if she played it right. Idk I guess I just don't see it the way you guys do.
---
What if they all had flashlights? Would that have been toxic too?
---
it depends on the topic, if you mention tbagging and your opinion of toxic/not toxic watch all the survivor mains crawl out of the woodwork

What do you mean, you're just messing with me aren't yo-OH SHI-
---
Jokes aside, thanks. I'd definitely have been dead there.
---
Nah, I see what you mean. Nancy had a good idea but terrible execution. That pallet drop was truly a what the fuck moment.
---
Well technically he is a mother so it makes sense
---
Or maybe another mode where being toxic is not only allowed, but encouraged. Like Identity V's Blackjack mode.
---
Bruh you can’t just say don’t get the game, I love the game and others do too. Just cause you’re having a bad experience doesn’t mean the game is bad
---
I would like the hello eric one where its near the end of the song
---
Gotta be smarter then the spirit that's all
---
Getting extra bold points for teabagging the killer makes me smile lol
---
if i cant see them its not skill but luck
---
Hmm I always just thought that meant 4man BNP and toolboxes.  If people are really just complaining that people are doing gens normally that’s kinda silly
---
He would be the most brutal Killer ever 
---
My idea
---
Killer: The Teddy 
---
Abilities- 
---
• Rampage: The Teddy gets to see every survivor’s aura while seeing the outline to the closest hook while being immune to pallets and destroy obstacles instantly. 
---
• Naughty: The Teddy puts the survivor in a downed state instantly after one hit while the hooks would kill the survivor immediately. 
---
Perk: 
---
Anger management: it allows the killer to be resistant to pallets. 
---
Mori: 
---
hooked jaw: The Teddy would lift the survivor in the air then repeatedly impale the survivor’s head with the hook then The Teddy would drop the Bloody survivor to the ground. 
---
Lore: fueled with hate, The Teddy makes a deal with The Entity to have an endless kill count.
---
(This is the killer in Naughty Bear)
---
Honestly MoM should just serve as a personal borrowed time. So let’s you’re unhooked but survivor didn’t have borrowed time, well you have MoM so you’re fine. 
---
And if the guy has borrowed time then you get two hits unless killer goes for someone else.
---
they dont know when they passive phase there is no mind game here its just i cant see you i die
---
In all honesty as much as I love the pig and her crouch mindgames at loops having John kramer as a killer would've been more fun. His power could force the survivor to make a sacrifice or something, like you have to hit a hard skillcheck otherwise you suffer a x% repair speed slow when you have a trap or something of that sort.
---
Would have cost a fortune.  At least with Evil Dead it was just Ash.  They have to pay for Joe Keery’s likenesses, Emily Dyers’ likenesses, the rights to Stranger Things, the Demogorgon’s model from the show, a new rig for Demogorgon, and then on top of that BOTH Emily and Joe’s voice acting?
---
They should keep it, at this point is basically extremely important lore
---
Some people in this community hate loosing. If they loose, it's not their fault but a teammate's fault or the killer. They blame everyone but themselves and their own skill. Why? I have no clue. Maybe their parents never taught them how not to be a sore looser when they were little. I never let their hostility bother me though because I know it's not my fault they're that way but a fault of their own deep down.
---
Wait isn’t that Nancy me? What’s your ingame name?
---
Weird thing to joke about but it seems overall harmless.

But our Clown is an obese, coughing fit-having alcoholic. Pennywise is literally a godly being using the form of a clown solely to lure in children. The whole "we already have a clown" argument is silly, imo. I'd only see the point if someone knew nothing about Pennywise.
---
It used to be good, it used to be when your obsession dies all characters gain a debuff to all actions up to like -%35
---
I made the mistake of not annihilating a p3 Claudette the moment I saw her crouch walking around the edge of the map (without UE btw). I instead killed the Adam because he had a key, and one portal travel later, guess who I saw teabagging at the gates?    
---
    
---
The Adam had 27k points even though he died. And the Claudette had 6.2k points but escaped.
---
The whole point of the original perk was just giving you a free hit. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
So Neas.
---
Ok
---
I’d rather it be like Famu’s version of it. The mellophone/baritone part REALLY gets you
---
Well hey, it ended with Claudette slugged and I injured, Clown was waiting by hatch since he saw both of us near it.  I went back for her, healed her to full, and finished up springwood basement gen, got mori’d, and she got out :,(
---
I agree with you , the only thing that people complain is her prayer beads , I think it can be swaped with the blood seeing add on and it’ll be a fair fight , those who say head phones are the only skill you need is headphone , survivors need to use that as their advantage too . 
---
And yes I’m a spirit player too but I play survivor too
---
That moment when they approach you and you suddenly enter a cinematic camera angle.
---
But it’s a rare thing that sometimes spirit , most times spirit just stand still and that’s the most troubling one
---
no dignity
---
I had a moment like this...
---
Except they didn't know EGC was a thing. So they were tbagging me at the hatch, with Old DS in their asenal. So I walked up, stared for five seconds, then closed that hatchy boi
---
Legion mains, Pig mains, Bubba mains, Doctor mains and Wraith mains are all united for a common cause :
---
*We need a fucking buff*
---
Survivors when I play killer
---
Cool! I didn't know that.
---
Weve heard your feedback and have decided to nerf pig
---
I agree 100%. I even made a post not too long ago on why he should be in the game lol.
---
Yeah but its not like Nancy and Steve should be celebrating what theyre getting into
---
Finally. Farming season has ended and I can finally play the game
---
Can they fix the hair while they're at it?
---
&gt;I can loop fine on every other map
---
That's because nearly every other map is incredibly survivor favored and just poorly designed in general.
---
47391747th*, actually.
---
Use Franklins
---
Its sorta countered by mori. But yea I got nothing
---
Spirit could def use a nerf, specifically getting rid of collision with survivors during her phase. Other than that she’s fine unless she’s using her most problematic addons.
---
Kindred it amazing, when I'm on the ground i see ~2 team mates being immersed Claudette doing nothing, when i get on the hook and proc Kindred its like they become real players and will actually be mostly competent.
---
you must be real popular with the ladies, you incel lmao at least learn to spell
---
They are unsafe for a reason. Last ditch effort, you can dh into a downed pallet and vault it when they miss a swing as long as they don't trap you against it. (it works the majority of the time for me)...then run to a safer area.
---
shut the fuck up
---
I bet you’re saying that because you want everyone to think you’re self-aware and, as a result, are smart, while simultaneously hoping that I have the same desire to make myself look smart despite me not having that desire in the first place.
---
I don't know how to help then, what I mentioned always works for me on that map. On every other map I'd wait for them so start breaking the pallet after looping them more after but with this one stun or not I gtfo because it's a bad idea.
---
We got one. Fuck you
---
“I was holding back cause you guys sucked”
---
r/commentsyoucanhear
---
It's just cultural stuff
---
I don't but that's because I'm not an infant killer.  This is a major yikes my dude.  Streamers aren't toxic.  Individuals are toxic.  You getting off on crutching kills against people over their Usernames is absurd.
---
Mhmm, but we're not talking about survivor toxicity, that's a whole different box of frogs. Both sides are toxic as fuck, I just don't understand how our get enjoyment from purposely ruining someone's experience. However I do understand if they tbag and shit, if someone's toxic damn well return the favour
---
This is a nice idea. Maybe spirit lore can be changes a little and it will work like in one dimension she escaped from her father and ran deep in forest where entity got her. She also had some cuts from sword, an injury or scar. And in one dimension she became a killer and her phasing can be said as she is moving between different dimensions and thats how she meet survivor Rin.
---
Probably mastered it
---
Nah I found it just super rare for some reason and I missed it before I could get it
---
Its pretty quick to find matches on switch right now, having a ball
---
What the fuck? How did that happen?! And that's fucking awesome. Is it a bug or intended?
---
The instances in which her animations seem to shift and be random.
---
It's only as rare as the amount of perks left to get. If you had all the others before getting Breakdown, then you'd get it each refreshed Web.
---
That's why I always run Bond. I will go if I can and use bond to look for others. If I notice someone else going for the unhook, even when I'm a bit closer I'll just turn back to waste less time (unless they are going to lose a hook state, ofc)
---
He's better than leatherface because you can spam M1 at the hook in treatment mode for very easy grabs.
---
That's 5 seconds of distraction, 15 for all three of your teammates. 
---
15 seconds of prime time for you to find a chest and hope for a Skeleton Key.
---
Well duh. Nevertheless it’s still RNG and boy howdy I have a lot of teachables hhh
---
Yeah, people rarely appreciate the effort, its easier to blame than to praise. But sometimes after a tough game playing fairly and not sweating for 4k as weaker killer, people give me +rep for playing like that, thank me for bringing extra points (the anniversary cake). It makes it a bit easier. But whenever i feel like i had been bullied one time too many times, i just pick spirit and easily get that 4k, as well as some hate :D feels good when ur mad.
---
Maybe they had Freddy but still had a Splinter so their Freddy loadout was selected?
---
don't you just love when a survivor runs object of obsession and then claims you are tunneling/hacking cause you keep coming after them/finding them
---
Nah he was a wraith
---
u/gifloopingbot ? 
---
Edit: sorry this doesn’t exist
---
I would try to hard reset your Xbox and turn your router off and on again and see if that resolves it. If not, I would contact dead by daylight tec support
---
r/michaelmemers
---
Hm
---
Oh yeah totally... I wasn't considering disconnecting or anything, just checking the name....
---
Tunneling is actively trying to get the same survivor all time, not just unfortunately bumping into them. Unlucky for them, but its not killers fault they werent careful enough
---
You were playing with some sucky people though. Literally took them an minute and forty seconds to do two generators while you had him distracted
---
&gt; that no one in the entity's realm can talk.
---
Source? Ash speaks in the lobby and Plague speaks both in the lobby and in her Mori, and there’s many character quotes in perks.
---
Dedicated servers aren’t a thing yet.  Still some things they need to fix on them.
---
We don't need all of the meta perks to be safety perks. MoM, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, and DS would be stupid strong.  It's bad enough on one person, but a whole team with that crap is unacceptable.
---
Ill double check tomorrow then and make sure its all good. Thanks
---
What day? (New player).
---
There’s nothing saying killers can’t use noed, but if you do use noed, you suck at the game. Its that simple. 
---
Its a crutch, every knows that. As survivor getting hit with noed isn’t fun. As killer, downing someone with noed feels cheap. 
---
You can get into semantics of “well it’s buying me time to catch survivors/ punishing them for not doing bones” but who are you kidding?
---
Bloodhunts should happen every full moon. fite me mcote
---
Idk man i just rank up i got even rank 4
---
Maybe if it was just a 4 token perk that disabled after all the tokens were used.
---
Spirit chase theme: https://youtu.be/AaRLW4ZS4Jk
---
:D Didn't know that tbh
---
I check this too often and I have seen every joke. Don't know why I stay.
---
It's a difficult perk to handle and at lower ranks, they usually fuck over their team so hard they might as well throw the game.
---
It was never like this it's not ping or desync as people proclaim it's just the devs nerfed the living shit out of vaulting because killers are whiny little bitches
---
They should make it actually worth while to prestige your character, like maybe being able to skip perk tiers? Or perhaps 10% more bloodpoints awarded post match per prestige on that character?
---
It could be there annoyin you so youd use it to get rid of it
---
If I had  to guess, probably something along the lines of blaming you for not doing the generators, cleansing all the totems, and also looping the killer at the same time.
---
I feel you man
---
In hope of seeing something original, I guess.
---
I tried to be an extra nice killer this event, mostly letting everyone go and trying to clear out all my BPS. Despite opening the event by trying survivor and being tunneled to death by a pig who proceeded to explain why camping and tunneling are the most optimal strategy for winning and he doesn't care at all how enjoyable another person's experience is. Maybe it's for the best that this event felt so short and the queues were so godawful, because it definitely brings out the worst in people if they aren't in benevolent farm mode.
---
Then you hit em with blood warden.
---
I seriously wanted him over steve and nancy.
---
WGLF too, it doesn't do anything at all
---
For further clarification, a few weeks back Windows forced a cumulative update (KB4515384) on me and broke a number of things. Found a new optional cumulative update (KB4517211) this morning and haven't experienced a disconnect after 20+ games. Could just be luck, but here's to hoping.
---
The hallowed blight, halloween event!
---
Yeah right now demodog jokes are kinda new. Who knew a alien creature with a flower mouth-head could look petable with a bit of Photoshop?
---
He makes infintecimally more sense, considerimg the ending of Season 3
---
Well since I’ve been waiting 30 minutes for a single killer match where someone doesn’t DC or the game doesn’t freeze maybe dedicated servers are all I should hope for...
---
I've always gone with the idea that the Entity credited him with every kill. *"Woah there, this guy who's slaughtered hundreds without a shred of remorse just brutally murdered another guy. Will all of his kills be like that now? I want him!"*
---
Wow, it was real important for you to come back here and say that. I hope it made you feel better. It gave me a good laugh.
---
I got:
---
Nancy to level 50 + all the perks I'll ever need
---
Demo to level 50 + all the perks I'll ever need
---
Pig from 0 to 40 for MYC, AND got MYC on Demo
---
A shitload of GF power recovery add-ons so I can finally play him again without a guaranteed depip each game
---
Pretty nice haul, I'd say
---
Probably not, actually.
---
If NOED wrecks some many people, I wouldn't say it's the least helpful. It's certainly more helpful than people who run in to help a gen and just to blow it and run off, or people crow watching in a corner or locker somewhere. Both which are a lot for common and useless than totem cleaning people.
---
They should make a different model for the broken key, I'm sure many think it's the purple or skeleton key because of the model.
---
I’ve exposed people through cracks in the killer shack and people accuse me of hacking
---

I’ve done “Surprise Nurse” a few times with NoEd and Insidious just to spook people not as a legit strat. I’ve yet to have not gotten a few laughs out of people after the match. I always get a scare except when someone happens to be running Dark Sense.. that god damn Dark Sense will be the absolute death of me.

Make a support ticket on their site. They can compensate you with bloodpoints.
---
I'm in a gang now

Mom, are you proud of me?

They never do. I'd be fine with filtering our memes, but it doesn't fucking work because nobody flairs their posts correctly and the mods don't correct it.

No, thank you!

I know this is dumb, but does anyone have any advice on getting use to the mouse/keeb operations? I used to play on console and I'm struggling without my joysticks. How do I run and look back at the killer if the mouse controls the direction I go in? I'm too slow switching between keys to loop! I still get caught on things. How did y'all learn?
---
That’s true, earlier today I played a killer game with 2 red ranks, a rank 18 and a rank 14 and none of them were swf (I’m rank 10)
---
In a weird way, I also felt kinda bad for bubba. Like he just wants to protect his family from outsiders. If we ignore the cannibalism thing.
---
Ruin was up and team mates are usually potatoes
---
Dude don’t she’s underaged
---
Well if I seen the trapper and clown tbagging I would have several questions
---
If the leaks are to be trusted, we should get something similar to the hallowed blight event again
---
Have fun playing the game again
---
Doing Jen, who?
---
Hey bro servers aren’t out yet still killer hosted
---
guess i live in another world then. world of 140 ping to 260
---
No she's of age. She went to a university, which means she's 18+.
---
Peanits from BHVR came in to a DBD stream I was watching while we were discussing how useless MoM was in it's current state. This man really said MoM is "good if you play with four people all running it." 
---
Let's just pretend that statement isn't the dumbest thing I've ever heard and it actually is good in that scenario.
---
Cool. That will definitely come in to my perk rotation as a solo player when I want to play more altruistic.
---
University? I thought she was a high schooler? Where in her bio does it say she university? Thoe I might be wrong
---
two.
---
I'm more excited for the Hallowed Blight than my birthday, man- It'll be the first time I experience it, this is gonna be rad

Although I don’t use them because I feel like it’s the same.

I proposed awhile ago that MoM should make a Survivor Broken (No Mither) instead of revealing their aura for a period of time akin to Deliverance. This gives the perk more of a tangible downside instead of just being "you will be tunneled this chase." It also lets a Survivor who wants to play stealthy actually play stealthily after activating MoM, and gives some danger to a Survivor who doesn't want to be stealthy since being Broken means that you can't be healed when unhooked. Basically it would mean that there would be less danger if you manage to escape the chase and more danger when you go down, instead of tons of danger if you escape and no danger if you go down. Finally this would make leveling up MoM actually worth it since there's practically no reason to level the perk up, as the extra hit effect will happen regardless of the perk's level.
---
But of course now there's no reason to *use* the perk since it's so godawful lol.
---
You're getting an upvote just for the fact you actually draw the hook. The wound could be bigger tho
---
I would personally make it a thing, but I unfortunately do not have enough of the required Karma to do it. God save the Michael.
---
This isn't merely cursed, this is ultra heresy. I move we call an Exterminatus on this entire Sub, it's the only way to be sure.

"hey bitch, what's up bitch, suck my dick bitch"

*Rin was the only child of the Yamaoka family. She was raised in the dusty halls of a traditional house in Kagawa. She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family's shaky finances. Her mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.
---
Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That's when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin's father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.
---
His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin's father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.
---
That evening, Rin came home from work. She'd stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother's scream come from the house.
---
She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents' room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.
---
A sharp Katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the Katana with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm again.
---
She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the door frame as support, she raised herself up. The Katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met by her father's blade.
---
She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother's tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.
---
Rin charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she recoiled in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.
---
As she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.
---
She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he'd done to her--with what he'd done to her mother.
---
Coughing up blood, her chin grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched heartbeat started to ring in her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could no longer move.
---
The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.
---
A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.*
---
That is her entire backstory from the Dead by Daylight wiki.

---
1200 hours and rank 2 killer says fuck this survivor sided unfun shit
---
I wanna play fun stuff and chill, not have to mind every single 3 second gap because then I lose if I misplay for something so minor like not counting to 60 on a DS or survivors bringing enough toolboxes to get a gen maxed and end the game in 3 minutes no matter if your ruin is up or you break gens or not, because if you wanna use PGTW you have to catch a guy, but if you catch him 3 gens pop.
---
Aww I always wanted to post a theory like this, but you beat me to it.  I wanted to point out how Resilience and TINH are both injury perks and they look like the same girl. Love this!

If all those letters u just posted were food you’d have ended world hunger

&lt;3
---
Thank you 🙂
---
You're probably exaggerating tbh
---
I didn't even think of that one. I was thinking that, obviously, his normal police uniform as a default, then the Soviet disguise and Hawaiian shirt as others. But you're on a new level of big brain.
---
No. It runs at like 20-24fps
---
The Entity wouldn't have let them escape tho
---
It is the strongest being in the game, seeing as it can literally instakill on whim. Survivors themselves, like Alex, Benedict Baker, and Vigo, have all said that the Entity was inescapable, and every time they did they eventually ran into the campfire again. They waited for another trial to start, and every time they tried to leave the fire, a deep paranoia set over them that forced them back. Leaving was impossible 
---
Baker even said that every time he died, a part of his soul and hope disappeared until, eventually, he disappeared with it. He left notes on the Entity and the killer, in hopes to aid his fellow survivors. Vigo disappeared too, only leaving a sap-stained apron that came into Claudettes possession, as well as puddles of sap that stained the other killers and survivors (which became known as the legendary outfits). Alex was a vague character, but left behind toolboxes that had her name inscribed on them. 
---
These "Lost Survivors" might've left behind some sort of trace, just like the other three did. The Entity took their souls, after breaking them down trial after trial. Something like the bloodweb. 
---
As each of these special characters were devoured, their traits were sewn into the blood web, just like the more you play with a character's traits (or, you're supposed to. I level characters up even if I don't play them), the more they die and the more their soul becomes one with the Entity. That's what the teachables are. 
---
With the killers, they grow older as time goes on. There are mortals there too, like the Legion or Huntress. It's not just Freddy or Michael, who are undead and back for revenge. Maybe there were also previous killers that just died from old age?
---
Now I kinda want that as an alternate mori...I’d love it if the killed just got frustrated and grabbed the survivor then jammed them on the hook repeatedly then walked away
---
You know, that's actually a really interesting point. I never really considered the First Gen survivors getting sent to the Void. Sad, but it actually makes the most sense. After all, the only reason the void would be mentioned would be if it was already occupied.
---
Once I got 84 hours and 7 hours in one session
---
You are correct about them closing their eyes, because the first deadhard was into a tree.
---
Only half... only half😥😥😥
---
Didn't know BT was a crutch perk
---
The mods don't look at every post that crops up, mainly the ones get most attention, even if so report it and itll be changed, I see ppl get mad over it in the comments, but no one reports the wrong flair so the mod team can actually see it in the modque FFS.
---
Report the wrong flair my guy and itll be swapped, but most people just do "This is spam" which doesnt help at all
---
Oh, and for the quotes, it was a little difficult. I had to come up with the perk names and quotes after the perks. These just made the most sense in different contexts. In the original contexts, thoigh, they're the most illogical choices. But I think I made them work.
---
They don’t :( I wanna be back in red ranks but god people still suck half the time up there
---
I thought bbq and chili killers could see survivors in a locker. Is Inner Strength and Distortion ran at the same time? Sorry. I'm new. :S
---
Now i can finally be all............. A L O N E
---
You had me feeling similar emotions until I saw your rank.
---
If they banned those users, people would stop doing it. It's a good deterrent.
---
No sir. When you think a killer has bbq&amp;chili you hide in a locker. It's like twoway blindness. 
---
I've only ran distortion with spinechill and object of obsession, I guess the fourth could be inner Strength
---
NOED would never even last till endgame if it was lit from the start.
---
It *shouldn’t* be favored in either direction, but matchmaking is never going to be perfect in any game. Add in a bunch of player complaints about the current system (which again, there will always be a group unhappy no matter what) and a relatively small player base, and you’ll get something like this. 
---
If you wanted to do an average - let’s say a survivor group of two 4s and two 8s averaging out to a rank 6 killer - even in a perfect world, that’d still suck sometimes in SWF scenarios. If I’m a rank 3 survivor and I want to play with my rank 20 friend, there’s just no realistic way to do that without an over/under matched killer. You’ll never make everyone happy. The matchmaking is pretty decent right now IMO.
---
When you are getting chased by the killer, you need to gain as much distance as possible. You can observe where windows are, where pallets are placed, and how your exhaustion perk (If you have one) can be used efficiently. 
---
In a map, identify where dead-zones are. Dead-zones are areas where there are no pallets or windows to loop the killer. You don't want to be around a dead-zone when being chased. 
---
Keep each area with proportionate amount of pallets. If you throw pallets down one after another in the same area, that area isn't useful when you or your teammates are trying to escape from the killer. 
---
If you know you're playing against a very good killer the best thing to do is to play it stealthy. Always assume every killer you face has BBQ.
---
Last but not least, hit those hex skill checks. If everyone's looking for the ruin, nobody is progressing the game.

---
Isnt ebony and a tombstone piece s bit overkill?
---
You are our of your mind if you think toolboxes are more impactful than keys.  Dude it only takes 3 gens to get 2 people out with a key.  With how fast gens go ar red ranks in this game that is incredibly easy to manage.  You could have them throughly outplayed and 3 or 4 genned but it won't matter because they got a key.  Keys and Moris are the same type of no skill cheese for both sides.  One gives an early escape when it shouldn't be possible for multiple people potentially while the other gives an early kill when it shouldn't be possible for multiple people potentially.
---
Little do you know she's phasing to you
---
None i love her default
---
I took it as Philip always being slightly cruel,and maybe being manipulated like that awoke something inside the character.
---
I also think that the moment the entity ripped him out of his world Philip was incredibly pissed.
---
Maybe,the entity is forcing him to use this anger and is hiding all other feelings?
---
Kinda like the spirit and her feelings against her dad
---
Where is tombstone + indoor map Myers? Now that’s SPOOKY
---
And against a rank 10 killer thanks to matchmaking
---
It's so obvious when you are Rancor obsession. Once you're aware you just need to be immersed until the gate opens and then run to safety. I ran Rancor on Demogorgon in a meme build and I never once got to Mori someone because they never showed themselves until they were safely through the gate.
---
Rancor is an A+ in intimidation but unless you very deliberately tunnel--without downing--the obsession until the gate powers on to Mori them (which will likely result in a throw) or the Obsession is careless and runs by you, you're not going to get the kill.
---
If Rancor was a *hidden* perk, where the obsession was given no warning Rancor was in play until they were instant downed (like NOED), and they played the game normally, it would become an A-Tier perk, but right now it's pretty damn useless most of the time.
---
This when the Shape mains come out of hiding
---
are you all around the same rank?
---
Doesn’t make a difference
---
What do you mean it isn't a good perk? The sloppy/thana combo is pretty dang strong. I run it on all the killers I play. I'd look at truetalent's videos and see how he plays it. He's a pretty good rank 1 killer.
---

---
That honestly is the MOST frustrating thing that happens when I go against ghost face. It’s unfair how he can stack his stalk on you, but right when you’re about to pop him out, he can hide and then you have to start all over. I know with the add-on, it’s even harder to pop him out of it. I guess you could say it’s “balanced,” but it’s still very annoying to go against. 
---
And big R.I.P for that lag and him hitting you. I would be 10/10 bitter 😂
---
I am not an expert myself, but I will give my best answer. It is based off opinion and some experiences, so take it as you will.
---
(Btw, probably someone elsehas said this)
---
All the killers have quite a lot of power. It is supposed to be based off the game's premise. But not all killers are equal to one another. The reason spirit is so powerful is because during a chase, you have to mind game her. Nurse is so strong because her ability lets her ignore most game mechanics. Billy is considered strong because if you slip up once, it is likely an insta-down and has lots of general pressure. Freddy has a lot of options, huntress can hit from far, and demo-dogo just brute forces it all. I can go on about this for a while about most of the killers.
---
However, the main issue is that the way the game is done is not balanced well.
---
Wait y’all be getting Dead Hard to work?
---
It's just because of the new players and the 2x
---
I spin my wheel volume down when I get hooked, I can't deal with Blendette's scream.
---

---
hey, i saw you on the naruto sub and you're here too? nicuuu
---
Maximum of 16% penalty is good, you will almost never have that much though, so it's a bad perk.
---
That’s just a rumor. Kate was a cut survivor but there was so much speculation about her the devs created a new character and gave her the name.
---
I didn’t even get to enjoy it my WiFi got busted
---
I've started using this to dodge Spirit mains and occasionally people who haved done some real toxic shit if the queues aren't too bad. It's pretty nice.
---
Don’t give them too much credit - none of them have VA training. They likely add heavy distortion and shaping for such a short sound effects, especially for killers.
---
Not knocking the work but I think the real talent is the sound engineer.
---
Rank reset happens the 13th every month, how often do you play together?
---
You did not just say to bring recovering exhaustion while running back.
---
Same for me, after playing this Game for about an Year, seeing such an Event is just sooo great and is probably gonna feel good Experiencing it for the first time

The ultimate thing to do to a toxic survivor is to play tik tok with them when they dont see the timer properly

Did u derank purposely or is this matchmaking fault

Oh, is it a bug then?

I'm pumping points into him. I can't wait to be a Quentin main once they fix his trainwreck of a face.

Basically any killer who isn't nurse or spirit

Alone

Last game I played I hooked a survivor and right as I started to walk away they unhooked him so I obviously walked right back and got him. Then they raged in the chat at me for camping because they kept doing it.

100+ New Killers

That's probably a difficult, long session but it's possible. I don't have it on switch so I don't know, but I heard there were a lot of issues with it. I'm playing on PC and bugs are unfortunately not that rare. I wish you and your friends good luck though, and have fun!
---
Yeah they just lost 6 players we all uninstalled
---
Revert it? No, period. Change it? Yeah
---
I would like a MoM that activates in a more consistent way, for example for flashlight/pallet saves counting towards it, so can be put on aggressive builds

---
I see you took my advice from your earlier troll post tonight lol.  This one does sound quite a bit more believable you were basically a caricature in your last one.  It's still fairly obvious bait but you're learning and improving your troll attempts which I guess is the important thing.
---
I don’t care if other people said Spine Chill is useless. I’m a rank 1 solo queue survivor and I feel a lot ‘safer’ while I’m using it since most of high rank killers tend to be more stealthy with aura reading perks and BBQ.
---
I can get early alert by that once I am working on gen at blind spot or can’t find where the killer is and what are they doing, which is kinda ez way for being ready to juke though.
---
Dude, I prefer have more unsafe pallets but have plenty with just few safe.
---
Make it all safe or most of them safe it's just a bad design and has been proven several times. I don't know why you even post this
---
Good thing he's about to get more!
---
Jesus
---
yes and yes
---
You gotta press the keys in the direction you wanna go while turning the camera. This takes some getting used to but I don't know another way. I hope someone with more knowledge on this answers you though.
---
Survivors: I’m tired of going against Billy, Nurse and Huntress. I wish we had variety. 
---
Also Survivors: I’m spamming Mettle Of Man, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, DS and Medkit with a purple insta and enough charges to get me another health state so I can tank multiple hits. Boy I sure do hope the Killer is an M1 Killer so I can ruin their game experience. 
---
But in all seriousness, Mettle was designed by someone who had very little balance Sense in mind. When they announced it I told my friends “just run this dumb ass perk cause it’s beyond crutch, it’ll hard carry a game because you don’t have to do anything and you get a free hit, omegalol.”
---
Thank you for not dcing. Making the game a better place. I hate this shit though. My last two games of the night I had a feng that would bait out us and was using bond and empathy just to chase the killer towards us. I was salty but then next game I had a claudette who when the killer was coming stood in front of me, tried to heal me, then sandbagged me to cover her ass and she was uninjured. The killer stopped looked at me, swung in her direction, and shook her head as it was pig. I booed the snoot and she left and ended up moriing the claudette. What a lady. Still died but that was satisfying. She brought a green mori and told me she uses it for toxic dickheads.
---
Noed isn't used in red ranks because get easily denied. I'm not the one who say so, BHVR data provided proves that
---
While adrenaline is used in all ranks, red included, since can't be denied
---
That's what happens every time I don't run it, this time it only happens sometimes.
---
10 photos taken moments before disaster
---
I was thinking about maybe going outside but I like your idea better.
---
Oh my god I would die of happiness if we got buffy!
---
Why?
---
It was like that before. Guess why they changed it.
---
Yeah, cuz people dragged a lost match more than it should. Even if you had that second chance do you think the killer would leave knowing there's a chance you can leave? No they will look at you until you die, wasting both time.
---
Don't be that entitled and think more than 5s why they made that choice
---
*Billy would like a word with you*
---
Wonder if BHVR has the balls to make licensed killers have nectar skins for Halloween though
---
As I agree that getting players that can perform out of your league is not fun, I must also say that killers, in my experience as a 50/50, go out of their way to make a match less fun in most matches. Be it camping, tunnelling or even just not trying. And with the new NAT type for killers it is incredibly hard to escape and enjoy a match with an unfair or rude killer. I do agree with you in the sense the devs need a proper way to balance EVERYTHING, and make it more fun for all players
---
Hey can I get uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh mc fuckin uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Or you can use this magical feature called "scroll down"
---
Yeah but it ruins the game when you target one survivor on purpose or just facecamp or hide around a corner
---
We waited about 15 minutes just for someone to not load in. 4 man SWF and only 3 loaded into the killer’s lobby.
---
Like most dbd youtubers
---
You have to unlock other characters teachable perks by levelling them up to 40 and picking their teachable perks at 30,35 and 40. When you got some unlocked you can level up gorgeous Kate more and get those perks.
---
having a swf group can make teamwork so much better &amp; easier. communication makes the game more fun and sometimes it's fun to laugh at things that would frustrate you in solo queue! hope you find more fun times in the fog soon :)
---
OK this actually took me a lot longer to learn that I'd like to admit, until it finally clicked. 
---
  
---
So, Idk how you're placing your fingers, but you want to use your long finger on "w", and your ring and index on "a" and "d". I didnt have a background on these games so whenever I asked for helped no one - including me- quite actually realized I was using my fingers wrong, because why would they?  
---
Other than that,it's really just practice really. There's a youtube video that explains, Im at work and dont have the link but if you google "dbd camera movement" or sth like that it'll come up.
---
And ghostface, they just yoinked the mask
---
Emily...?
---
Ace/The Hag
---
Same thing here they just don’t care about console players really
---
It’s not supposed to. It only does with a single cosmetic and it’s just an animation resetting, so it’s not even consistent.
---
I couldn’t get into any games, for every time I cued I just got a infinite loading screen. And it’s not my computer because it had been working fine before. Idk why
---
You made a killer concept which is totally overpowered, an the perks are fully overpowered too. Free Mori, making it impossible to escape (EGC is too short, see what happens with bloodwarden) and imagine giving ANY killer the ability to teleport into the corners. Thats broken af.Sorry, but you made that concept as a killer main, didnt u?
---
Headphones don’t help against a spirit, you need to play a few more rounds against spirits
---
As of now Second Wind is not kicking in after the broken status fades from deliverance. This might be changed at some point, I'm not sure.
---
Nea/the nurse, feng min/ the doctor, and david king/ the huntress too i just didnt count the special edition/free characters
---
Really? Everyone P3, with all perks maxed, and they still play normally?
---
And 2 or 3 people change nothing
---
You have to remove any other form of Broken first to get Second Wind. So if you take SW, and yeet off with Deliverance you have to wait 60 seconds for Deliverance’s broken and then you can wait the 30 seconds for SW. 
---
Also it’ll get hard countered by Plague so good luck with that.
---
When I played killer I noticed this happened to one of the survivors, I hit them through the pallet on their end, just like your video. I let him wiggle off to keep the chase going because it wasn’t fair on his part.
---
I meant headphones are the only kill you need to play spirit , you can mess with her when she phases
---
You dont have to, you can just hook patrol and hit the rescuer but that isnt my point. What im saying is that you can win if you really try hard enough. It probaly isnt fun for the suvivors or for you but if you really want to you could. So like you play against really good swf, they know what they are doing. You COULD still win if you play your cards right. They probaly call you a cunt and to go kill yourself but it isnt too survivorsided like stated here.
---
Fo sho I know there’s a huge influx of new players so just tryna spread the wealth a little. But yes one of the best perks in the game for survivor
---
There is no phasing sound if you're inside her heartbeat..
---
"Oh you have a open field? NOT ANYMORE! TENTACLES EVERYWHERE!" also you made a free mori. This idea is alright but op as heck. Alot of fine tuning is required.
---
No there’s just been a bunch lately. 
---
I hope they get back to making original characters soon :)
---
"Shaggy this is DMT in a jar!"
---
What’s the song? 🤔
---
No it does not! Crouch, and Hag traps won’t go off. Pretty sure only works for her traps, not trapper though
---
Agreed that the killer should have it count as a sacrifice, but the survivor points would just be begging for trouble with swf.
---
What was the point of saying you all deleted the game?
---
"allow keyboard and mouse usage"
---
That's an awful idea mate
---
Scratched mirror, il say no more 😏
---
You can definitely still get lobbies, but solo is quite a mixed bag. Overall I still enjoy it when I need a week or two break from DBD.
---
Did she survive? That's the important question here.
---
This is 100% true. Played with a rank 3 survivor and they hid in a closet the majority of the game and the rank 16 was actually more brave to work gens than he was.
---
Hey everyone, sorry if it's a dumb question. I'm a little out of the loop and can't seem to find anything online about the dedicated servers status. The most recent news I found was a post saying that by the end of summer it would be out. Is it? If not, has BHVR said anything else?
---
Ngl I was so excited for the Summer Event because I started playing during the 2018 one. I love the way the gens looked, and I loved how all you had to do was bring an offering for those juicy extra BPs.
---
It got delayed to Fall 2019, so this season probably around the Archives update
---
Michael Myers is a pretty fun, straightforward killer. You basically "stalk" people to absorb their fear, which allows you to level up, get speed bonuses, and the ability to down people in one hit. It also gives Survivors a good scare, spotting Michael Myers out ofthe corner of their eyes.
---
As for being a better killer, just look at it from the perspective of a Survivor. How do YOU escape the killer when he's chasing you? When you get downed, what did the killer do to get that hit?
---
Right. I would just want the tier 3 answers
---
um we don't have dedicated servers yet still peer to peer lol
---
The Halloween Event this year is going to be another hook and gen event, which I'm looking forward to. If you have any of the old pustula petal offerings they changed the description to summon hooks and gens now instead of the cankers.
---
Its a free mori to one survivor. Its still a mori. And ATLEAST dream snares dont whack you like a helicopter blade when you are in killers "lemme just MAKE THIS TENTACLE MAD" mode. Its unbalanced and the two other perks are dumb too.
---
But if your teammates are dead then you can just jump in the hatch right away anyways
---
And then he diddles another minor
---
Ehhhhh, I dunno man. I've been playing spirit for the last month to see her limitations and I've found nothing. every time I phase someone gets hit. I've had survivors try some sneaky stuff, but you can hear them plain as day and it's easy to counter them. That's not even counting the mindgames (to use the term loosely) where the survivor is forced to commit to a position or die, and the odds of them making the right choice are incredibly slim. Maybe I just haven't gotten  good survivors but nothing seems to work yet
---
Mhm sure Jan..
---
Yeah but there is a fine line between "inspiration" and "blatant rip-off". You can see where Trapper and Hillbilly got inspired from. Yet they are very different from their inspirations. Now are you really going to somehow argue that the same can be said the for the Spirit? Really? You cannot deny that the Spirit has closer ties to her inspiration than the other unlicensed killers.
---
if you have a loadout on a killer you use the offering for you will use those perks on that killer so he must have had perks on Freddy
---
Peekaboo with the killer is okay but that lag was some bs.

AWAKEN MAH MASTAHS
---
Protect his family from outsiders? He brutally murdered his family (perhaps rightfully so).
---
I would find Hillbilly more sympathetic if it weren't for this part of his bio:
---
&gt; *After the deed was done, he continued to live his life at the farm,* ***taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were allowed to run free****. As he finally broke free from his shackles he ran through the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find* ***tortured and disembowelled animals all over the farm****.* 
---
I can understand, given what he went through, why he would kill people; a man and woman might remind him of the parents that kept him trapped his entire life. A boy or girl might remind him of how weak and at the mercy of his parents he, himself, was as a child of similar age. But violently and brutally killing and disemboweling animals says to me that he enjoys the act of killing just for killing's sake.

Even if she does, why does that take away from it? Why whine about this? Like I said, this game never claimed to be totally original with it's character design. I don't think she's a blatant rip off but even if she was it doesn't matter. She adds to the game. Stop complaining just to complain.

They were being toxic and 2 insta heals and flashlights and tbagging me. I couldn't control myself and moried them all after first hook.

---
I am sorry to hear that man :(
---
So because you can’t play custom games, you just delete the game? You know there’s public matches right?
---
Emotional prism.
---
Bills are always the ones to leave my behind or sandbag me, I wish I was lying. The Steve’s and David’s are kind though.
---
You know those don’t work either right?
---
Uh... If you can see the Mori offering then it means you offered it.
---
What's your perk pack? I love it
---
Well you might be playing on low ranks , again spirit was made to play against high ranks , usually you get gem rush and looped till gens are done when you play high ranks unless you have op addons or reallly goooood predictions on what survivors do . True you play any game really good if ur skilled with the killer you like but in the end if you go against s solid team , you’ll not be able to end loops quick unless using meta killers such as spirit , take example of leather face , yeah with addons like insta saw he’s good but it become useless if survivors get good distance on you and know how to poop really well , the best optimal killer that seems balanced is Freddy , the rework was well played out , can teleport to gens , end loops quick but still can looped and have fair game , if they balanced all killers like that it’ll be god game to play . In the end the game needs to balanced like truetalent(a YouTuber) but right as if now any killer than spirit and nurse , the survivor has the better advantage when they are really good at loops .thats where spirit andnnurse come to end those exploits

**Laughs in Wake Up + Leader equaling a total of 40% faster exit gate opening**

might as well give the stranger things dlc pack steve some sun glasses
---
Deflating balloon realness
---
Yeah, that's where this comes from. I made a Killer (The Flayed, Flayed Billy) which I posted a day or two ago, because both of them make a lot of sense to be in the game. Hopper disappears, and Billy is never seen again. Neither were designed to be an improvement on the DLC, I just though Hopper and Flayed Billy both work really well.
---
if you are the last survivor that gets hooked and everyone is dead the game won't allow you to struggle on hook other than that SPAM THE STRUGGLE KEY
---
You don't seem to have a very good eye for balance.
---
1. Definitely not, lol. In case you missed it, he moves at 105% speed. This means that he basically *can't* down you without hitting you through his power, which causes a 3 second fatigue.
---
2. Not even. This perk is strictly a negative until the guy is dead on hook, at which point killing them instead of hooking them is pretty much a mute point.
---
3. Impossible to escape? You're kidding, right? Survivors can leave a gate at 99% until they're ready to go. Now, I don't have the exact measurements of the exit gate area, but I'm *pretty sure* it's possible to traverse the distance between the exit switch and the escape line in the 1:15 the survivors have left after this perk ends.
---
4. Yeah, I see it. There is no problem here. The target locations are heavily limited, the locations you can use it from are just as heavily limited, and it has a massive cool down. **OH NO, THE CLOWN HAS SOME HEAVILY LIMITED MAP MOBILITY, EVERYBODY PANIC!**

Anti vax poster incoming with stolen artwork from a video game sub reddit

Thank you very much!

he coulda gone to the upside down

Just every chapter in general
---
I once played Myers on meat plant, 5 gens done zero hooks, i managed to down one survivor and facecamped the fuck out of him (i was inexperienced). Then his friends came to the rescue, i popped T3 and they all ended up on hooks.
---
Works for me
---
If I saw two people poking that horse as killer, I'd just let them go. Too wholesome to harm.
---
Michael Myers/The Shape. The game for whatever reason says he's difficult to learn, but he's probably one of the easiest killers to play as.
---
You never know. Im easily amused. I could let yall go too tbh. Its depending on my mood and if I want to rank up or nah.
---
Even after getting all perks there's always add-on and items to get.
---
Ywah if you play solo it’s just fine
---
Totem spawns need to change. They don't need to be impossible to find, but they do need a lot more variety. After a while it becomes easy to memorize every spot. It is not so much that some are out in the open as it is they are at very obvious landmarks that make them easy to find/pinpoint at the beginning of the match.
---
I guess it's not 100% Dead by Daylight-related, but is Stranger Things a good show? I don't want to watch any trailers of it in case the trailers spoil, but I don't know anything about it. I don't even know if it's a straight horror show, a comedy-horror, or what.
---
I also don't have Netflix (I game more than I watch TV so it feels like a waste when I still haven't finished games like Fire Emblem Three Houses) so if I do watch the show, I'd need to buy the DVDs. I don't mind, since I love physical media, but I still want to know if the show is worth it.
---
😐 Yikes...well, that works too.
---
[IT’S DA SPOOKY MONTH!](https://youtu.be/PmzwhVE5Ly4)
---
Doctor is an easy killer to start out with. His power makes it easy to find people and slows down the game a little bit by forcing the survivors to periodically snap out of it.
---
Well I think it's a 15% decrease to the time you take to vault, so I guess for a fast vault it's 0.425 sec down from 0.5, and for medium vault it's 0.765 sec down from 0.9
---
Hahaha. I was thinkin about that while making it.

---
This happened to us on survivor side and it was so monkaS in my life. It was justa  shroud but holy shit was a spooked.
---
I am a basement slave for the Oink goddess, so I play like a total goober whenever she shows up and bring her presents to her basement. This has garnered a lot of mixed results and hatred from fellow survivors who have started report bombing me for "helping the killer". Which I wasn't really, I was being a dingus sure, but I would still hook save and take hits for anyone in basement, even heal them and give stuff. It is not my fault the killer chose to let me live a couple of those times. Plenty of times the Oink Goddess straight up kills me or puts a hat on my head and bullies me until jaws rip open lmao
---
Definitely a viable explanation. But either way, Dead by Daylight isn't actually canon to the plotlines of any cross-promotions. This would be similar to Ash. At the end of Army of Darkness, he's sent back to the future, allowing Ash vs. Evil Dead to exist. In Dead by Daylight, he was decieved and sent to the Entity's Realm instead. This was more for my own enjoyment and out of a love for the characters than anything, but, again, it definitely makes quite a bit more sense story-wise than having Steve, Nancy, and a Demogorgon.
---
SC essential lmao SC is a bad perk 20 seconds to heal while 20 seconds on a gen is like 25% done. 
---
Coulrophobia just why? it is a terrible perk just use sloppy instead it works where ever on the map ppl are.
---
Ruin isn't necessarily essential for lower-tier killers like trapper yea it is very helpful but if you can apply map pressure you don't really need ruin.
---
that is just my opinions at least
---
I play killer mostly, and I 100% agree with every single of the points you make.   
---
I think there's a slight preference towards survivors wanting to brag because - in game terms - they're the perceived "victims", - even though many killers are the entity's victims, it's hard to emphasize with that.  
---
The killer is literally there to stop them from escaping and should have to the tools to do that; so whenever a survivor actually escapes, or outplays a killer, people are inclined to want to side with the survivor. This is mostly subconcious I think; if you actually look up posts you'll see many of them favour killers and shame survivors, but inherently, most players/humans are inclined to side with whomever is a victim and in disadvatage, and that would be the survivors.
---
Yeah seems about right lol
---
I said door open
---
I hate going against Trapper or Hag not bc they are strong but bc i am a dumbass and can't stop holding shift and getting trapper or a hag poping up scares me
---
That's a real uh... Something with that mister krabs there.
---
I thought you had to have a few generators for the hatch to even spawn?
---
yes yes ik
---
17 seconds instead of 20
---
would main hopper as soon as he came out if they decide to
---
Weird cause I'm not having that problem at all.
---
(*killer opens locker to see him dancing in there with a disco ball*)
---
Josuke stop having a BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
---
I think it was more the game saying you're close enough to smack here's a grab. Think of it how killers can  slide to the front of the hook when they are on the side of it. The game has only one grab actions animation with it being grabbing them off of the vault, gen, totem from the back so that's where the game put your character.
---
It's outshined by BBQ. It doesn't slow down the game, it just tells you which generator is being repaired and BBQ does this more efficiently with also a BP increment.
---
Even the entities over here throwing some shade! Have some respect! It’s ash! At least put “what a groovy sacrifice”
---
It’s pretty :]
---
It seems like everybody already calls it Demi/Demo
---
7% faster than normal. still slower than killers at 110% or 115%
---
I would name it.... Demoboi.
---
You run almost fast as 110% killers so they have harder time to catch you. The only killer that can't catch you is mirror Myers.
---
Gordon
---
it is slow down and info and info perks are great
---
Actually thats better now that I think about it
---
Ahh thanks for clarification.
---
it isn't a significant slowdown but it can give  you time to run over to a gen that is blocked that u know is at like idk 50%
---
I like it on Gordon (demogorgon)
---
Thanks!
---
Burger King Myers lmao
---
Looping is braindead easy, there is no skill involved other than running in circles. You don't even have to memorise loop locations since they are abundant. 
---
Don't come to me with the "looping takes skill" crap, it does not.
---
Huntress and Hag are 110% everyone else but Nurse is 115% while nurse is 95% I think survivors run at 100% do the math
---
Family guy meme suits better

Names were already leaked for more Blight skins and the offering for last years got updated to say event generators instead of the cankers
---
Lucky you! I always get the grab animation and it gets stuck there and I’m stuck chasing the survivor in that animation!
---
Not since end game collapse was added
---
I use it religiously on Freddy, I feel his gen teleport makes him the only killer that can get maximum use out of the info provided by it
---
Adrenaline is a reward for living through trial
---
1. Meaning it doesn't let you kill them any faster than normal, since you still need to bring them to the point where they're dead on hook and then down them one last time. It lets you get around saves via DS/Flashlights/Sabo, but you can already beat DS by slugging and Flashlight/Sabo saves are rare. You're just spending 10 seconds or so in a Mori animation instead of spending 10 seconds or so carrying their body.
---
2. I mean they're certainly more mobile than Bear Traps, but that's because their usage is completely different.
---
3. From a mechanics standpoint, imagine Doctor with Interview Tape.
---
Yes but it’s spooktober tis a black cat it’s perfect my guy
---
It... does though? 16 seconds is a long time and even rank 1 survivors aren't always on gens when they should be. If they are on gens you know exactly which gen they are. BBQ can't see through distortion, if they hide behind the gen, or if they are closer than 40 meters. Even if somehow it doesn't give you the info you want, then you get a lockdown on all gens for 16 seconds. I'm not saying its better than BBQ but its pretty damn close imo
---
The gane is perfectally balanced. 
---
If u bring an ebony mori. 
---
Buy all DLC to make splinters moris. Thats what i did. 
---
U cant be rank 2 tho and do it, which doesnt make sense, cus rank 2 is when ebony mori is fair
---
Iron Will is in the shrine a fair amount if that's an option to you. And just think of it as getting that much closer to Ruin. Hag is great to play for those mindless late night games too IMO, although she's not for everyone because it's really easy to fall into the trap (har) of just playing her as optimally and thus campy as possible.
---
Leatherface
---
The RBT is also a Kramer trap, no? Don't think whoever it's attributed to would determine it's eligibility much.
---
Yeah pretty much lol, except Billy was inspired by bubba
---
Amazing point of reference how a match can go to shit in just a few seconds.
---
Poster child clip for Iron-will and having good headphones
---
Would it not be prudent to upload all of them in all colours, so people can use the tiers as they see the value of different perks?
---
Do you think i havent been and am not currently camping the shit out of everyonw game after game and moriing?
---
Cus i am
---
Yet bubba got fucked in the end. Bubba is harder to juke I give you that but goddamn is the chainsaw bad.
---
I wouldn't :)
---
Yeah it's been happening a lot, just have to wait till BHVR acknowledge everything.
---
Does a Labrador chase a toy, maul it, and then throw the toy into its water bowl and stare at it until the toy sinks?
---
Because if not, that ain't Bubba.
---
I get why he's top tier but I prefer Bubba's. Because fuck I can't get used to Billy's chainsaw
---
Aint that kinda common sense for killers?
---
Is it me or survivor mains always complain about killers all the time?
---
Where did ya get this song from??
---
I prefer hillbilly cause he can get something done with the chainsaw. I wish they added a lunge effect for bubbas chainsaw to make him viable.
---
You dont know. Maybe he does that.
---
I actually made this a month ago. I approve the reposting. Share the love! Lets get this dlc! :3
---
Ah, I did buy Iron Will from the Shrine. It just refuses to show up in my bloodweb now, after prestiging my main man.
---
I did try to play Hag a couple of times but gave up, it was a bad experience. I'm willing to try her again though. As killer, I'm basically a Freddy onetrick at this point, with a sprinkling of Michael every now and then.
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
...touche.
---
You'd think so, but seen some guys at lans playing with shit headphones having a bad old time locating survivors.
---
Plus doesn't hurt to mention it again, especially since we got the Switch community just joining in.
---
Karma is a bitch.
---
Adrenaline is the only one I get annoyed at, mainly because of how much it does at once
---
And what are the chances anyway that you down 2 survivors within that short amount of time? If you're that good or lucky you should reap the benefits too in my opinion.
---
Fair point.

I mean he's pretty hard to carry on your team when he weighs a Quinton.
---
1. The range is 12 meters, a bit more than half the range of interview tape. Not exactly a sniper. 
---
2. Can go over short obstacles,  but will stop if it slams against something too tall. Hiding behind a truck bed won't save you, but the walls of a jungle gym will.
---
3. It's style points. Not super high tier, but certainly better than something like Furtive Chase since it does have the use of bypassing DS situationally.
---
4. Yes, you can guard gens with tendrils in theory,  but in practice it doesn't work out. You can get injuries like that, sure, but you can't exactly follow up with another lash. You'll need to chase them down afterwards,  and with your low speed you'll definitely need to use your power. Doing so will remove the tendrils you previously placed to guard gens.
---
As a baby killer it honestly isn't you it's the fact that it happened like 15 times before you. 
---
Hard to have fun when you don't ever even hit someone.
---
Also, i love how it says he was never to be seen again. Get it...? Because you know... *bing bong*😅😂😂
---
I love this so much.
---
Insidious basement Bubba has entered the chat.
---
I'd compare NOED more to DS and when I think about it I just remember the vid OhTofu made about it
---
What kind of esports, million-dollar prize pool trials are you playing where 2 minutes is the mode time to complete 5 gens? I live in red rank (like that matters with this game's awful matchmaking) and that never happens, for either (solo) survivor or killer.
---
Well it is based on your GUYS internets cause we dont have deticated servers yet. It happened to me with someone that has shit tier connection and tried to host.
---
Yeah you’re definitely a killer w no friends that’s why you don’t get it

Tried to upvote this but accidentally downvoted.

It's a show entirely built on 80's nostalgia, while being a mix of horror and coming of age series.

i say make it work like a sertan radius

like proove thy self but Always

the one will see a blue icon indecating they are in range for a protection hit
---
This. 
---
The amount of Spirits I've gone up against without Iron-will. I might as well throw myself on the hook for them.
---
Thank you! It'll show up eventually, I wish it would hurry though. Ash basically requires it lmao. I had it on my first go-around. Now he's up to level 41 and it still hasn't shown up. Especially sucks because I wanted him to be my first (and probably only) P3 but I don't wanna deal with this perk struggle every time.
---
Seems like we're in the same boat with bloodwebs, so good luck to you with BBQ as well!
---
*insert basement corner breathing*
---
Sorry text wall incoming.
---
I really don't like blaming good players for being good at a game that's been out for 4 years now. When I first got the game It was already 2 years old and I still sucked at it. 
---
I usually play For Honor and that game is even more punishing for new players because you have to deal with combos, timing, and enough bs to make hourses jealous. So when I go up against someone who's really good in this game I can tell you it feels more like a battle of skill.
---
I find myself saying things like, "oh he's just better at running away." "Ah damn it I should have seen the pallet stun coming." Or, "Shit I gotta remember to look away when a survivor has a flashlight." Instead of saying things like, "Ah well this hero is under powered." "Oh c'mon that totally should have killed him!" Or "Fuck I thought I pressed R1!"
---
Basically what I'm trying to say is, "Yeah it sucks when you get your ass kicked all day and feel like a looser. But it's just a game, and it's a game of skill. And it's real skill, not just a bunch of no lives who have nothing better to do than to put 160 hours on one hero and make everyone have a horrible time just so they can have a false sense of accomplishment." 
---
Sorry for the wall of text but I've kinda wanted to get that off my chest for a bit.
---
Or you could just, y'know, prestige without being a cunt?
---
You are dumb af bro it’s not based on internet cuz when I solo I can find a game in 30 seconds they just don’t know how to work swf
---
That’s debatable.
---
Had to change my build during bloodhunt to include Iron Will due to getting fucked by way too many spirits.
---
There are several people telling you this is unbalanced and op, and you still negate everything. Work it over, balance the perks keeping the other killers in mind too and change the power to be NOT op.
---
if you're lucky, all you need to come back from a "all slugged for the 4k" situation is one well-timed unbreakable

Exactly xD And was such a awesome character after all. Helped anybody at any time, protective and caring. Solving problems with his fists and not like anyone else just talking. Definitely the biggest balls xD

Don't know about getting mad, that varies from person to person, but the meta perks are quite frustrating to play against, especially when the entire team runs them.
---
*tier 2 music plays in the distance*
---
I can tell you i stopped playing because i got fed up with grinding. I want to play all killers, and survivor as well. But i only have all teachables from hag, BBQ, and am level 30 with Plague, as well as level 20 with Pig. Thats it. I wanted to play survivor for a while, but i cant earn bp with them and have 0 teachables. So to effectively grind bp for them i have to play killer. Meaning Hag, cause thats the only one with Ruin and BBQ (dont have BBQ on plague). But if i want more killer perks to decently play killer in the first place, since even between ranks 20 and 10 you constantly play against hundreds of hours survivors purposely deranking with multiple meta perks, i have to spend hundreds more hours to grind out killers. All the while only playing hag to get somewhere. If i want to have any variety the amount of bp i need virtually explodes even more. All of that getting me farther away from ever playing suvivor. And even when i finally manage to grind out the teachables there, alone for Dead Hard, Adrenaline, and BT i again have to grind out 3 full characters, and then hope to get the perks on the shit web on the survivor i decide to main.
---
Instead i stopped. Its just demotivating. I thought about playing a bit during bloodhunt, but then i read how it takes ages to get a game as killer, and when i checked in again and saw what i have unlocked, and what i need, i just quit it again without even searching a lobby. Fuck that.
---
If you only stay in the game because "oh i need to unlock" then maybe consider to play something different. Obviously the gameplay isnt fun enough for you to keep you there, and you can "unlock" shit in literally every game.
---
Today has so much good shit coming out. We got shadowkeep, we got this event, we get a new apex update. This day is da best ever.
---
and for extra salt
---
ghostface just for t-bagging
---
Do Fixated and Hope work together?
---
Getting triggered by teabagging = me will never respect you as a person. 
---
Reconsider how butthurt you get over absolutely nothing or maybe you'll find yourself surrounded by equally pussified weaklings.
---
Like shove their face through the hook or.....?
---
JUST BREAK THE PALLET KAREN
---
Maybe he's just observant and loves music?
---
She might have been trying to heal you and threw the pallet instead. It’s the same button on controller by default. (Which is dumb, but what else is new?)
---
I should’ve also mentioned that it combos excellently with PGTW on Freddy
---
circumstantial tunneling
---
F
---
I know it's no fun going up against an ebony mori, but I still tried to play as fair as I possibly could, I'd still hook some survivors twice and let the last one get hatch. More points for everyone from that I guess.
---
Tiger sharks.
---
What does it have to do with anything? If survivors had unique perks or some other unique skills some of them would be played more than some of the others. Game experience is designed after the killer’s gameplay, not the survivor’s.
---
It's terrifying, I love it!
---
I think it's specifically when you tank a hit near a *healthy* survivor. I had talked with a dev about how buggy protection hits are (they know) and they mentioned that you get MoM and WGLF stacks when taking a hit for an injured survivor specifically.
---
Tremors for sure because you can cheese the perk by downing someone by a gen that's near completion, break it to regress it, pick up a survivor, drop them immediately, and pick them up again when the 16 seconds are up to reset the timer and prevent the gen being worked on for at least 64 seconds as long as they don't have flip flop
---
Its not based on the internet meanwhile you dont see other players complaining about it and you blame the game and not your own hardware/connections
---
There is a problem with customs games that's for sure, but swf not working is on you
---
When’s the next one? It’s nice having people not immediately dc when downed.
---
Wow thank you so much ! Such kind words. :)
---
I read the comments so I have every right to say this. Stop being a total fucking pussy and do solos if You can't load into a game with Your friends, how hard IS that, god damn.
---
I still think it's great that Micheal has a voice actor for a silent killer, yes he's silent even tho he has a grunt.
---
You also sound drunk af cuz I had 3 other people tell me and saw other posts saying they have the same problem with swf
---
I have, and I even tweeted about it. They never acknowledge shit is what makes it worse. I love this game, but it’s really hard to play atm
---
Atleast give us updates you know the current issues and are working to fix it.
---
damn Mr. Krabs is T H I C C
---
^(*smol but brutal*)
---
Patch notes will be something like:
---
* Pig is now Undetectable while crouched
---
* Reverse Bear Traps now injure survivors instead of killing them
---
My question to survivors who fucking run toward a gen when being chased. Why?
---
There's still plenty of things to grind for:
---
- Pink addons
---
- Pink items
---
- Cosmetic items
---
- Save up enough shards to get the next survivor/killer for free
---
I’d rather face an omega blink ruin noed nurse than a perkless no addon spirit
---
Playing survivor : Killer chases me for 2 minutes and no gens get done.
---
Playing killer : I down a survivor in 30 seconds, 2 gens get done and ruin is already gone
---
"What's that breathing sound?"

Yay! Thanks!

couldnt he keep looping anyways, if he already did so for all 5 gens?
---
Looking foward to that espically since I played Destiny 1 on day 1 and kept with the franchise since. Preordered every dlc except warmind
---
No because Fixated only increases your walking speed.
---
I would say escaping is your reward for living through the trial tho too.
---
When I see a TTV in a name I just know that I'm going to be humiliated with an audience
---
How many times did you level him up past getting all the perks??? I have P3 Myers with all perks and I never used the map offerings and I sit at an average of 10 of each.
---
One way save money👀
---
Omg this made my day
---
I want that job.
---
But being a “distraction” is not the objective.
---
Spirit is also 110
---
Yah but noed would be a totally different discussion separate from this. I just mentioned it because it’s usually mentioned when survivor second chance perks are brought up.
---
Thats why you run Haunted grouds for people that wanna be cleansing totems in the fiest minute instead of doing gens
---
but it doesn't even require to try hard survivors bc survivors are forced to find all 5 hidden totems and if you do 1 you kinda are forced to do 4 more but that could all be a waste of time unless the killer actually had NOED plus NOED stops being used in higher ranks. that is actually info from statistics.
---
like rank 1-4 noed isn't used at all if any time it is rare and when do you see it the most? lower ranks. New killers get false info when relaying on NOED that is the other problem with the perk.
---
Adren to me yea it can rly break your run if you are a killer but mostly when it comes to end game you are not gonna get a 4k and I'd say you are lucky to even get 1-2 at that point of the match generally you should win before the last gen is popped unless well you are specifically doing an end game build. But you get my point
---
I really don't want another Stranger Things character, but I will say I do love your idea for Antique Chariot.  The only real change I would make to it is reduce the time frame.
---
Idk, you could make it so the perk recovers your exhaustion at 50% speed while running. Idk if it would be op, but I also don’t know if it wouldn’t lol
---
ik
---
I don't think mid chase sprint burst are a good thing
---
yes I was thinking "I am sure there is another killer going at 110" completely forgot about her
---
I mean the overall objective is to escape, right? That's the whole point of doing generators is to escape. If someone distracted the killer so long that everyone else was able to safely get all the generators done, then I'd say they contributed the most to the objective.
---
I say *"Nothing personal kid"*
---
good thing it just isn't me my sensitivity is down at 0 yet it doesn't do shit lmao
---
I don't think I understand your scenario. How is this any different from just kicking a gen and standing in front of it while it regresses for 64 seconds so no one can repair it?
---
Loving that crybaby perk. It just made my day imagining a jake running fast as hell and making roughly the same noise an ambulance does...
---
Yeah it's been pretty grim on ps4, the sheer amount of times I've been kicked and disconnected after at least 20 minutes of waiting is a joke. We'll have to see if the Halloween event makes it better or worse.
---
What I wanted to say adrenaline just rewards survivors for surviving as dying light and tanataphobia rewards killer for hitting and hanging em so I think it’s fair
---
You will get some shit for survivor mains out here but stay vigilant, you did good for a rank 15
---
Slugging is not that easy as people assume
---
Back when the new map was on the PTB, Puppers has a video of him running a killer for three gens on those unsafe pallets.  I don't have a link to the video in question, but it is out there and can be done.  I've used a few of his tricks and actually do better as a potato survivor on that map than on others.
---
I don't know what they're thinking sometimes. "Ah yes Buckle Up needs a range or it would be far too OP....but MoM will be totally balanced on release!"
---
????????
---
To add to the above for #7: Lockers. When a killer is near it can be tempting to just slip into a locker. However that might give you away and it provides you with nowhere to go if the killers realises you are in there or just simply decides to check. 
---
It is also a good skill for new players to learn how to evade the killer by crouching and hiding when they hear the killer or being able to bolt and loop if he spots you. A skill that you won’t learn if you choose to hide in a locker. There is definitely a way to use lockers masterfully (as mentioned above - dodging BBQ and Chilli) but not a skill you should be focusing on.
---
Rancor is also a free mori to one survivor, and it's at endgame too, you know, JUST BEFORE THEY WIN aka when getting mori'd out of nowhere mines the most salt. 
---
Arguably this perk is more tame. Survivor gets longer hook time in exchange for not having to be carried to the hook the third time. What's wrong with a free mori and cool death animation when you're out of the game anyway?
---
We'll Make It actually works now with second wind! It did not on PTB but it does now! Using a medkit or having someone else help does not though still :(
---
Honestly I think I would be fine with the perk if you got it as long as you healed someone's health state (like aftercare, doesn't matter how much you helped, as long as you're there to finish it) because it can only be used twice in a game, max.
---
Has anybody else been having serious issues once the last update? My rituals keep changing (always from survivor to killer), gens are glitchy, I can’t heal people some games, the skill check wheel disappears (sometimes in the middle of a skill check) for good, the end game timer doesn’t tick down (and the ground doesn’t change) so I have no way of knowing how much time is left... I could go on and on. I’ve had more issues since the last update than I’ve had all year.
---
Honestly it’s like why even have ranks if you get no rewards, and go against whoever the game feels like putting you against anyways?
---
I wanted this so badly when I heard there was a Nightmare on Elm Street chapter.  I thought for sure we'd get this on the map similarly to Halloween's theme on Haddonfield.
---
It shouldnt have a cool down to begin with, same with things as surge but devs dont really like slowballing killers
---
It really didnt help they ALL hovered around the only person hooked... And each tried a flashlight save or blind
---
honestly, after Learning how to use bis Portals, I have yet to not 4k a game, absolutely insane how good his gen protection is
---
I saw this on r/memes
---
And then they have shit for you because you camped, not because they swarm the hook like flies - after 300 hours on trapper alone i am not suprised at all
---
Any normal speed killer, mindgames are called that for a reason
---
I think the shrine should just be a daily thing
---
&gt; With the killers, they grow older as time goes on. There are mortals there too
---
I'm not buying this. They are in the Entity's realm. I doubt anyone ages/time has a meaning there considering some of the people are brought in dead and from different points in time *(all of them might be dead, we don't really know if Entity kills the people they abduct but at least Bill, Adam and Spirit are dead, might've missed someone i need some sleep :D).*
---
I’m 30. No shame. I love this game.
---
I think Dark sense should now be a tier up seeing as they've changed it. Before you'd only see the killers aura when you complete a gen and i mean when YOU complete it (so if you 98% a gen with a friend and then you hop off and it geta completed... you dont see the killers aura)
---
Now if any gen gets completed, regardless of you touching it or even being near it, you see the killers aura for 3/4/5 seconds (i think those are the times) and completing the last gen makes you see them for double the time.
---
For me its nice to know how far the killet is and what direction hes going in so i can head the opposite direction etc
---
I'm not going to say anything on Spirit in my example, however, I will speak for my main, Mama Huntress. I love that instead of just a small, minor loop that she hums, she starts humming it, eventually starts to sing, and you can hear her going more and more mad or getting into it with her laughing and hmms thrown into it. 
---
So while the engineers may've done something, a bit of echo or reverb or something, the base performance still was done. So really credit to both
---
And honestly, I would kill to hear the humming just completely unedited
---
Literally the first down. Poor guy played the game for 1 minute was hooked then dead. She got me next and camped. I held out as long as I could for the other 2 to get gens. Don’t know if they survived
---
I am a killer main so that is not going to be mean on anything: are you playing spirit or nurse by some occasion?
---
If it glows, it goes
---
Upon occasion, though lately I've just been dodging and forcing them to requeue.  I've started saving my Moris for Blendettes as of late.
---
Tbh, these are kind of niche and could use a buff. 
---
If you changed cleansing hex totems to cleansing dull totems at 25% faster and hex totems at 35% faster, this perk might be worth running. 
---
For the second perk, it sounds pretty good- but I would change the numbers again. I would make the numbers 2/3/4 or 2/4/5, so it would be a little more like the perk ‘Hope’ but you’ll have more situations to use it in. 
---
For the last perk, I’m not really sure how well it would work in the game. It is very powerful. If you had a 4 man swf with 2 of them running this perk, it would be insanely strong..
---
Wake up has the same numbers, and when that was bugged it was ALL actions 5/10/15% faster. If a SWF can stay co-ordinated and together(which they can) this perk would be very unhealthy for the game, as it would be like 4 people using the wake up bug all over again. 
---
Overall, you have some nice ideas for perks- but there are a few I would tweak to make more valuable for a survivor. I’m not sure how I would change the last perk because I think it is very strong.
---
I was really confused by that WHOLE PART of the the conversation lmao
---
I’m 100% sure that MoM was only broken as long as it was so they could make the max amount of money from the sweaty MetaFags buying ash just for the perk
---
This was inspired by remnent from the ashes for sure. 
---
Imagine getting unhooked and one second later a tentacle downs you.
---
I love the minor variances. Like how the lion on the left has some bubbling sores. Or how the infection had taken some of her face like in the game, just straight up awesome
---
Dont die or kill them all respectively
---
Sure but when people argue against adrenaline being “op” for whatever reason, it’s always about the gens, not escaping. If it popped when the exit gates got opened then I would say 100% the objective is to escape. 
---
I’m not trying to argue for it one way or another. Just a thought experiment.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbql68/where_can_we_go_to_complain_about_bugs_and_issues/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The devs have said in the past that "previous survivors" have basically become drained of all emotion that the Entity feeds off, so they're basically cast into a void to rot.
---
Nobody has escaped yet.
---
True, movement speed is very nifty. I think due to how much you’d be risking(as in the injured noises being louder) it would change the meta by people running this. You’re gaining a lot for risking a lot, which is why I think the perk would be great to run. 
---
Though for killers like Huntress or Hag, I think they’ll have a lot of trouble against survivors who know what they’re doing the more I’m thinking about it.
---
Once chased by a wraith who missed and hit poor Maurice.... I stopped and wagged my finger at him and pet my poor friend... I got killed for it but it was worth it.
---
Fun trivia Maurice was the clowns horse before coming to the entity and is not a creation of the entity unlike the crows.
---
Maurice was also blind and so the entity granted him a 3rd eye.
---
Animals on red ranks do nothing but unhooking. Seriously, we have 2 gens done, but all they do is farming people. I can't fucking wait for another rank reset.
---
I love how we can just communicate without even talking, like the casual crouch spam as HEAL ME, THANK YOU or a Hello
---
Nah, don't feel bad
---
Always remember this "If there was a gun the survivors would use it"
---
Then they'd teabag your bitchass body
---
Mori in peace friend
---
My friends just call him flower boi
---
When you bring a massive boost in bloodpoints, see that the killer can murder you early, and still proceed to be as toxic as possible so you make it out with less points than a regular match.
---
Big brain.
---
dewit
---
the transition made me puke
---
But the MINDGAMES dude
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/qR2Xgmu
---
Or I don't play the game anymore so I simply don't have enough matches to rank up.
---
Not an excuse as I agree its stupid broken and kind of unplayable... but the ingame friend system was a part of dedicated servers update and if I remember correctly wasn't supposed to be easy or possible without dedicated servers...
---
Dedicated servers got pushed back but they left this part of the update and I think that's why it is so broken because parts of it literally got delayed. I was surprised they left it in the update when dedicated servers got delayed.
---
Have you read Dying Light? It's like a sentence of its effects and then a short novel of all the downsides and limitations.
---
Killers should lose bloodlust on whiffed attacks.
---
Break the pallet you fucking clementine.
---
Spam for heals, 2 for hello, 3 for thank you is what I roll with lol.
---
TIL crouching didn't trigger the trap..
---
memes can be educational
---
That Kate cosmetic needs a rework, it's ugly af.
---
The enitity “whispers” to you when people are in a certain radius I can’t exactly remeber the radius thinks it’s like 40 meters something like that
---
You hear whispers when a survivor is within a certain range
---
Matchmaking just now matches off the highest rank player in the party.
---
I was talking about the tier 3 answers.
---
I mean, how many stacks are you talking about? How many wounded? Do you want the breakdown for EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE COMBINATION? 5 Dying LIght stacks and 2 wounded?
---
You can do the math.
---
From the wiki:
---
You have a rudimentary understanding of The Entity voice.
---
Sporadically hear The Entity's Whisper when standing within a 48/40/32 meters of a Survivor.
---
Tbh, that's creepier, like one of those scenes in horror movies where a face gets bulged on a blanket or some shit.
---
Xenomorph and predator
---
Honestly me whenever I get that map
---
He's alive 100% it's obvious
---
They honestly expected me to see all 4 of them and say "well here's one on hook, i gotta leave!" And just totally ignore all 3 just sitting behind the damn tree over there
---
i wish there are more killer like you.. because damn... when this shit happen, it really feel unfair
---
*"Dedicated servers by the end of Summer 2019!"*
---
Link to vid?
---
Omg that dog is so cute
---
Wat achievement
---
Adrenaline is NOT the same as noed IF you solo queue.
---
Spirit is a strong killer, strong enough to challenge Nurse. As such, a good Spirit is almost like a good Nurse - at a certain point the perks won't even matter anymore.
---
The Middle Right Panel with the "Exposed" Icon. The dude's face's is like ".....awww shit..."  🤣🤣🤣
---
Still funny when this sub talks about a Legion buff when the sub's incessant whining about them got them nerfed into oblivion.
---
I love it when you insta heal them, the Killer and Survivor start processing what happened 😂
---
No only her distance and more blinks are getting reworked
---
I have seen this, while playing with my friends if I want one more stack of WGLF I always tell them to wait for the killer at the exit gateand let me get hit. The first time I did it me and my friend were healthy and I got nothing, next time I told him to take one hit and then get in front on me, I tanked the next hit and I got the stack.
---
I had no sound on and assumed it was 😂
---
What rank is this? I am guessing like 12.  Billy made too many mistakes while chasing you. You should have been downed a lot sooner if he didnt loose you multiple times + weak mindgames from him. But good job, anyway
---
I dunno, personally I've never died as killer.
---
I do a thing as Myers where il wait till the last survivor is alive and il flip a coin and if it’s heads i will kill them if tails the escape I started doing it because it’s fun
---
Even though I enjoy killer this is why im a 99% survivor. If the lobby isnt instant then im not wasting my time.
---
I thought spirit was 115 all this time
---
&gt;140 shouldnt feel this bad
---
LOL
---
140m is high AF compared to 0ms (the killer). 
---
My god this community...
---
well, the deal is in the lore
---
no
---
He does have stealthy chainsaw addons I thought ? 
---
I never see anyone use them
---
&gt;What's the goal for the survivor then?
---
Honestly if the Survivor has nothing left (Unbreakable, Key, Etc.) then the only thing left to do is avoid the Killer long enough to bleed out just to spite them really.
---
Or just AFK, go do something like eat something light, and come back when the match is over.
---
Thats the best part of the lyrics!
---
i have been trying to play nurse for a while now (green / purple ranks (got to purple but no higher screw getting to rank 5)
---
and man oh man do you lose motivation fast when you get bullied in this game as killer
---
you are playing the role thats seposed to be powerfull
---
then you get hit with 4 omega flashlights adreneline DC and pallets all while you can't even hit a soul
---
i play survivor to but there each loss motivates me. (also green / purple ranks)
---
just something i wanted to share doesn't add anything and i don't want arguments over wich side is better (both are equally fun)
---
You're asking someone to a SHIT ton of math.
---
I.e.
---
1 dyign light + 1 Thanat = 7 
---
1 DL 2 Than = 11
---
1 DL 3 Than= 14
---
1 DL 4 Than = 17
---
And you want that for EVERY stack of DL up to a possible maximum of 11.
---
Why don't you ask someone here to do your taxes, too.
---
Fire up and noed in the same tier? Your argument is invalid
---
Lol, I'm sorry, I didn't realise I was talking to such a badass. I should've been able to tell how good you were from your martyred whining about OP killer offerings.
---
wow
---
Like the match is over but it's not really over. That's the problem...
---
I’m just saying Joe would be the type of guy to jump on that opportunity
---
*Laughs in Blood Lodge*
---
wtf happened there, i guess doctors been buffed
---
Yeah though I understand licensing is not always easy, iirc all the rights for Halloween including the music all have the same holder so the rights came like a bundle where as other licenses have separate holders for themes etc.
---
You can do it if your not in a chase
---
This change would also be useful for "kill with your own hands" dailies.
---
Yeah usually I go for the save once another survivor is already distracted the killer so I can get a safe rescue and safe heal.
---
What's Halloween blight?
---
Not trying to boast or anything, but my last survivor game my team scolded me (randoms) for not looking for ruin. I was hitting all the skill checks perfectly so I was fine. And makes sense. Thank you!
---
Fair.
---
...depends if you want to play it?
---
So double pip each game. Got it.
---
If you don't want to get better or try hard then stay at rank 12-15. It sounds bad but if you want to have fun without trying hard e.g. ruin and top 3 killers then it's the way to go. 
---
I don't play much of the killer these days (even though all my points are going into them) because the queues are just stupid long and on a margin bearable during evenings in the UK. The point is that I am rank 12 and I do not even need to try hard but I can't just la-la-land my way through to victory so it's still fun. 
---
Fun is dependant on both sides. If you're facing 4 SWF good team then you'll most likely won't enjoy it. If you're playing Nurse with 5 blinks, spirit with prayer beads, a huntress with an iridescent hatchet and use annoying to deal with perks like NOED or Sloppy survivors will most likely have barely any chance of surviving so it's not fun for them.
---
Hmm maybe when the neck and face doesnt work try to aim a bit higher. This might solve it.
---
I may sound like a noob, but what benefits would she get from being undetectable? She has no terror radius. Is it so spine chill, and any aura perks won't affect her whilst crouched?
---
&gt;Unbreakable, DS, survivor could have a key, there are a lot of possibilities. I don't like the idea because it's unfair.
---
As a killer, if I have someone hooked and suspect the slugged survivor have DS, I just sit in front of him waiting for 60s. At that point you have total control over the match, no point in risking getting DS.
---
In what world would a killer just leave the last survivor to get up with unbreakable? DS would be an entirely fringe case because not only would the last survivor had to have been freed within one minute, that would also most likely mean there is still another survivor still alive being chased.
---
Yes. But I hang in there, but if the killer is facecamping and they're waiting to unhook, I'll rush to struggle mode, screw those team mates
---
DBD is a cat-and-mouse chase game. The maps are designed around windows and pallets. They created one\* killer specifically designed to ignore all of the chase mechanics.
---
You can't really blame people for getting frustrated when having to face that.
---
Except like twenty people have already posted this before you. Oh.
---
This kind of a survivor? You mean somebody trying to survive? Lol.
---
Just had a game where a survivor got unhooked, downed at the exit gate but escaped because of DS so..
---
No, a fking God Survivor
---
I can't even give you an e for effort on this one
---
Nope, I was playing demogorgon. And like I said, the DC's happened almost immediately. Before I even found a survivor.
---
Windows of Opportunity
---
Matchmaking is fucking shit so i wasn't able to get in to one fucking game.
---
Damn that pc got the sickest RGB lighting ever
---
“Where’d they all go?”
---
Simple and to the point. I like this comment
---
I did this not too long ago, I was stuck with a lvl 1 survivor daily and had to escape for that daily, no matter what I did, I kept losing. Even two times I got downed at the exit gates, altruism failed, genrushing failed. The plan was to just log out after that daily, but I just kept dying. After three hours I felt numb, emotionless. There was one more thing I could think of, the hatch. So next game was vs a piggy, I had a super altruistic team, and as a killer main I knew this was going to be just another loss, since I was the only one doing gens and they just kept getting put on hooks so I made up my mind and just watched how two got sacrificed and one bled to death, I found the hatch, and jumped in, without looking back.
---
I am the scum of the survivors, but hey I finally defeated that daily, I was finally free :)
---
(They didn't die in vain! LOL)
---
Karma ^
---
Guess ur rank 13 aren't ya?
---
It's not really being a badass, just being skilled at one thing in any aspect of life would give you this attitude, again sorry that you suck at everything you do.
---
Demoman from team fortress 2
---
Just use wake up
---
Mild racism because hes African or something
---
The problem was survivors have two health points. Giving them a free hit means chases and in some cases stopping objective from being completed take significantly longer. And the really big problematic portion was there was no risk in running Mettle. It didn’t do anything bad for you to just get a free hit. The “drawback” was having your aura shown if you fully healed after tanking your free hit. So if you stayed injured afterwards or only healed to 99 with a kit/SC, there was no loss of the perk.
---
I'm in red ranks and 9/10 of my games are like this. Also swf with their best looper with OoO telling them when I am going towards their gen happens far too often. I get that ds used to be even stronger than before but if you can hook a different person in-between the cool down of when D's starts and when they use it stops me from calling it an anti-tunnel perk but people still tell me it is. Gens go way too fast in this game imo but that's just me.
---
What do you mean? New to the game!
---
Spirit Fury Tier 4
---
oh no
---
Borrowed time is pretty annoying if they are being dicks about it and unhooking before you are even 5m away
---
Not a clue. Rest of the match was fine, and that doctor was kind of shitty, but I’ve never seen anything like this before.
---
This was hard to watch, but gratz
---
That’s dumb. I thought there was
---
BHVR I see this as an absolute win!
---
Ngl I would be chill if we got a killer like that
---
Please no
---
Vigo did. He figured out how it all worked and somehow escaped. Or I'm misremembering. Lol
---
Thrilling tremors is really nice, especially on stealth killers
---
That's a jumpscare right there!
---
Well of course with something in place to make it balanced, maybe the decoy doesn’t have a redstain or something and the killer has low move speed like the hag or nurse
---
I've watched it and it doesn't. I don't even remember something like that in the movie tbh.
---
You just hate all totems don't you? LOL
---
It's not a party until someone gets murdered
---
Mmmmmmmm
---
Yeah I'm a baby player
---
I dont even play Nurse I just play Freddy and Myers
---
No i didn't drop the controller
---
Dedicate 25%  of your perks to an otherwise useless perk, just in case a key pops up?
---
What about those who don't own Leatherface?
---
If the person is being affected by Leader while running Wake Up!, Spine Chill and Resilience, it would take about 13 seconds to open the door.
---
Season 1 has more of the “horror” vibe but it’s still not all that scary. Season 2 is decent besides 2 episodes. Season 3 is too absurd for my taste.
---
There is no balance in this game tbh
---
Whats noed
---
I dint get it
---
There was a bit of an up-surge in key usage during the bloodhunt.
---
Sorry for trying to stay on topic while you attempt to berate me 
---
If you come in here for a bully attempt and I don't take the bait I'm supposed to beg you for help or something ? what the hell are you even talking about...
---
You just wanted to say I was whining and talk shit, **Clap Clap**
---
But most people only really listen if the gens being worked on when the killer is on a hard patrol
---
Really? I loved all 3 seasons, but I do wish original Ghostface had been in 1 &amp; 2.
---
No one escapes death
---
At least there you can usually get a hit on the unhooker before, and then another after
---
 Making it easy down
---
And instaheals. And moris. And generally unfun killer addons. People love to ruin the game for others, the bloodhunts let them do it more.
---
Demodog
---
maybe that's what my post is about ?
---
NOED is no one escapes death. It activates when the doors are open (If there are still some totems left) and it buffs the killer.
---
*shit that was my job*
---
Finally some good fucking meme
---
Exactly. Then they could finally balance the game around that. Instead of how it is now where if you are a 4man swf you have a ridiculous advantage, but if they buff killers to match that then solo que would be fucked in the ass
---
Is it a perk
---
Watch some videos of people playing it and see if you'd like it. 
---
I will say the game takes a lot of grinding.
---
Ah memories.Sorry to all the killer mains who are currently experiencing PTSD at the thought. Surprised after  going through those sorts of dark times that included pallet vacuums true infinites etc we actually have any killers left.
---
But 1 Single survivor shouldnt be able to counter an entire killer. The whole point of stealth killers is to stay undetected, and removing that from them makes them M1 and really boring to play. Other perks are fine because you cant tell the exact place where the killer is while OoO lets you see them 24/7. 1 OoO in a swf team and the entire killer is countered, that should not be a thing.
---
Ah. You learn something new everyday. Thanks.
---
What did you do when you wiggled free? Did you run away, or did you get on a generator?
---
It's possible she was saying "hey let's farm". 
---
She could have been doing a daily, yes.
---
Not even mentioning that every stealth killer apart from Ghostface is below C Tier
---
They don't lose Bloodlust for getting pallet slammed, however,, if they rev up their chainsaw or do their ability for example, Plague Purge, they then lose their Bloodlust.
---
The daily ritual thing has happened to me too. I think it's only survivor dailies.
---
It was due to everyone playing killer? Survivor times were like 30 seconds
---
How you could send them? Like through email?
---
I more so meant in those situations where you didnt realize there were crouching behind the hook, and dont notice until they actually unhook becuase you started walking away. 
---
Yeah I can still get the free hit after, but now I either have to commit to this chase knowing the other 2 survivors are knocking out gens, smack the unhooked guy who has BT, or go after the other 2 survivors who are about to pop a gen across the map, and lose all my pressure in the process.
---
How’d you know?
---
Halloween though?
---
Trivia: Star Fox and Ocarina of Time both have 20fps or less. GoldenEye 007 deathmatch would be lucky to break 10fps.
---
"Unplayable"
---
Survivors should get 1.5x base
---
What is the new best survivor loadout after the release of stranger things characters ?
---
I feel like both characters have some cool perks. Which of the old perks these are combined with best ? 
---
Would be glad to have some varying combinations.  Open for some suggestions.
---
WGLF doesn't even get a stack if their downed right away
---
Yeah never cared about pips only BP
---
xqcP IT'S TIME
---
It's a good show. Honestly though were I you I would just get Netflix for a month and binge.
---
The best way for me to phrase it is look at the newest version of IT: Chapter 1. Dial the horror back. Add in other elements llike another dimension and mental poewrs, and you have Stranger Things. There's Coming of Age/Drama elements, bu tit's at its heart a mystery/thriller with horror elements.
---
Same. Threw two rituals away on teo consecutive days, got "heal others for three health states" and after closing the ritual menu and opening it again it had changed to a nurse one both times. Pretty annoying
---
When she's walking around normally, she'll sporadically disappear from view - this is passive phasing. See it in action, with the various add-ons, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-HLfNwIg4Q).
---
It's not bait. If some killer main is proposing a change so he always gets a 4k without fail, I'm going to call it out. You guys seem to be obsessed with getting 4k or else 'survivors are OP'. It's ridiculous.
---
It's because they're so rare and short that people go crazy. However they are afraid extending them will give people that can grind for the full time will run out of things to do and they'll lose a customer.

No No.
---
God No.
---
Please No.
---
No.
---
This will just destroy the balance and tilt the amount of survivors vs the amount of killers way too high in addition it will be wayyyyyy more expensive like 20+ $ For an expansion.
---
2 Survivors should be the max adding more than that is just ridiculous.

This cat makes me laugh way to hard each time
---
Just like DbD, it's not all *that* scary, but tense instead. You constantly wonder "what will they do next?" or "how will they make it out of this one?" It's a really good show, I recommend all three seasons. Oh and they just teased S4 a few days ago!
---
First I just need to point out "plank barriers"...
---
Makes them sound so fancy. 
---
Makes "pallets" feel cheap and dirty...
---
Would be cool but I doubt they could make it work. They break so much now when they do any patch let alone something this cool and complex.
---
I knew this I just couldnt choose wich of the characters, feel free to suggest but I'd say Billy and Beverly would make the most sense
---
Have you ever even *tried* playing Killer? If not, maybe that's why you're burned out.
---
With that said... [Inhales] BOI!
---
From this video, you seem so up yourself. "I'm good", "legends never die", "let my DBD legacy live on forever"?!
---
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS 360S! You're not Jesus H. Christ, reborn unto us unworthy mortals!
---
If that video is any representation of how you normally play, good riddance, don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Had a similar situation and, since i’m not gonna get to high ranks, maybe red at some point but probably gonna hit a huge skill curve at purple, i stopped trying to play nurse and switched to someone i’m better with(Myers, Legion, and Pig) and i’m doing pretty good now. It’s all about finding the right killer for your playstyle.
---
Peanits confirmed the new update broke ranking.
---
I just call him “leapy” because he always seems to dash out from around a corner and beam me in the face with a lunge.
---
No it’s not how brain dead are you, stop talking about things you are clueless about. Why are you going on about unique perks and skills how’s that relevant to this game at all
---
Discordance
---
Thank you so much q.q :&gt;

Halloween 2 Disco Boogaloo!
---
Unfortunately "getting used to it" is by bitter experience. Thankfully you'll find that nearly all first and third person games work the same way, so once it "clicks" you'll be good to go for pretty much any game.
---
Think of it like this:
---
* WASD is like your left thumbstick, - it controls your *movement*.
---
* Mouse is like your right thumbstick - it controls your *camera*.
---
On console, if you want to move forward and look behind you then you'd tilt your left thumbstick while rotating the right thumbstick. On keyboard and mouse that would mean holding W while using your mouse to move the camera.
---
Use the tutorial as an area to practice this until you're comfortable with it.
---
Alternatively, just continue to use a controller as your input - you'll have no problems as survivor, and it won't significantly impact playing as *most* killers.
---
&gt;The max ammount of pages is about 4 so you still have a lot of perks missing so you will have to wait
---
There is no max amount of pages and the total amount of perks goes all the way to the fifth page. [All perks](https://i.imgur.com/es0ewnV.jpg)
---
I think you mistook post game chat with reddit
---
People do care about pips, it doesn’t feel like a victory if you don’t pip. Stop blaming others, you’re bad at the game, like we’ve all had questionable teammates yet we still win and pip. Instead of losing and crying to people who don’t care
---
On a semi-related note, how fast can we get? Could we get to the point of outrunning 110% killers?
---
You really seem to care with such a reaction.
---
It took like 1 min to find a killer game
---
The thing about Steve’s perks is i dont think babysitter and second wing goes hand to hand. 
---
When i save a survivor from the hook and reveal my aura to the killer, best thing to do is to run to the opposite direction of the survivor i have rescued and lure the killer away. But it means i wont be able to heal the survivor at that point, so it is a waste of another perk. And most of the time i get to heal a survivor right after unhooking.
---
I actually like babysitter, so im planning to combine it with perks that are well suited to keep the killer busy. 
---
If i am to use second wing, than i feel like perks like autodidact or we’ll make it goes better with it bc this way the healing part is out of the way fastly.
---
I mean... these people wasting 3 perk slots for healing perks instead of having DS, BT, Dead Hard, Unbreakable or Adrenaline, or any other stealth perks, that can help them lose the killer or progress the gens.
---
Most of them are not that good in chases, which results in the quick downs as soon as they are found. I really don't mind heals, medkits don't last forever, and, well, getting initial hits nowadays is easy enough.
---
What type of mori did you use or did you use Rancor?
---
Get outplayed gamer.
---
Bing bong is a great beginner choice. I legit use him at level one at mid yellows and it’s real fun.
---
Called auto correct, and you did put “incel” you moron. You’re playing the virgin card by saying that arguing with a 17 year old, so id love to embarrass you about your social life too. Come on say some shit about yourself now
---
Aha.... You do realize you get to reveal him even once he's ducked behind cover? You do know that you can see him over half walls and around corners when he can't see you? You do know you are being stupid?
---
What?
---
Demogorgon using The World to stop time and move to the window
---
It's subjective, and depends on both the player and the rank.
---
Most high rank killers are *expecting* the meta perks (the same way survivors *expect* Ruin), so while they may be disappointed they're unlikely to be tilted.
---
Bear in mind that not being tilted doesn't mean they won't prioritise you. The best you can do is just play and have fun - remember, you could bring the worst perks in the game and *still* have someone popping off at you about how OP they are.
---
Bad tier lists
---
You’re the type of guy to cry because they had ruin and you miss skill checks whilst you were in a 4 man swf with insta heals and a key
---
The salt...
---
I’ve got 5 m8.
---
Alright hmu
---
Only time I ever used No Mither was for adept not gonna lie. Aside from that I don't feel like getting tunnled all game.
---
Won't fix anything BP Related.
---
Id love to see david literally just punching the shit out of the demogorgon
---
See that's what I mean.
---
That is so unnecessary. He was saying that he didn't "yoink your post" because that would imply you were the first to post it.
---
Just because you said you don't care doesn't mean he is wrong or can't read. :/
---
Secret pig buff where traps are inescapable
---
I'm reading the comments and it's pretty funny how they tell you to read guides on how to play killer, lol. Then they only play survivor and don't know anything about killer powers, they just hide and win games at low ranks. 
---
Game not only is unbalanced but it's also NOT FUN. The ones that only play survivors will never understand how sweaty you need to be to play fair and win as killer
---
So glad double BP is over. I can now find killer lobbies in like.. 2 minutes!
---
It seems to be a lot of "who was the dickhead first?". If you act toxic, expect toxicity back. If someones being toxic towards you, try to play as best you cant without giving into the primal urge to be a dick back. At the end of the day, its a game. Have fun and dont take shit too seriously. If someone is super mad cuz "youre so toxic" call them cute, hit on them and be nice. It will make them panic and get angrier
---
You get bronze altruism if no one is hooked or healed.
---
No Lightbringer.
---
No Benevolent.
---
No Evader.
---
No Unbroken.
---
i dont think we'd need another use for flashlights. people would just have to go find a chest and change out their item as soon as they realize its a demo. as far as the "op" or "broken" posts if its IN the game and "working as intended" then people would just have to get over it. i think him being passively immune to flashlights would be perfect.
---
Yup, id tunnel that lol
---
I believe so
---
I hope you woke up with tier 3 ready, cause it's huntin time
---
This. Keep in mind, some perks will just get you FOCUSED sometimes, and that's completely normal.
---
Things like Object of Obsession, No Mither, Babysitter, and Decisive strike.
---
Are you playing Spirit? that's the reason, everyone is spamming that fucking killer
---
ZA WARUDO
---
Ah ok that's what it does, yeah ghost face, pig Myers and wraith are pretty much hard countered with OoO I know of the perks and how it effects those killers I just didn't know the undetectable status effect prevented aura reading. Good to know thanks! ☺️
---
As long as ebony mori exists which is still stronger than 4-man SWF all bringing pink instaheals, I really could give a shit about anything any killer cries about.
---
not that big of a Problem, but it automatically makes me focus volt
---
“It ain’t much but its honest work”
---
Wrong flair then
---
Have you ever seen fungoose playing LF?
---
He/she wasnt the only one who reacted at the comment. I support the idea, while I didnt know that others posted it before because I did not see any of that. I might look who is angry, but not bcof random anonymous users from the intetnet
---
when i play surv: i die on my first hook with 2 people on gens across the map and a nea on the basement's locker
---
when i play killer without ruin: 2 min game gen rushed
---
Sorry.  I’ll be more careful with my words next time.
---
Ah, thanks
---
I wanna collect them all and replace my portraits with themmm! 💖💖💖
---
Sleeping survivors cant rescue and proc borrowed time.. just putting that out there :)
---
Are you suggesting they invented the stats? If so, to what purpose?
---
You can compare the SWF survival stats against the Rank survival stats - Rank is a consistently stronger guarantee of survival, even with the caveat that the stats date back to when you could "game" SWFs by taking a token 20.
---
For the SWF survival rate to be as it is, you're proposing that for every full escape there must be *at least one* full wipe. That's how you get an overall survival rate that's *slightly* lower than 50%.
---
&gt; *I bet if you take...*
---
Easy enough to test, so why not put that together and share it with the community? I presume Red rank meta applies, so they'd have to be going against a Nurse, no?
---
&gt; *but that they give an unfair advantage that was never even intended*
---
I can agree with this part to a certain extent, in that it's a historical truth, but again bear in mind that more recent statments have begun to accept that there's no way to prevent survivors working together, and that the goal is to narrow the gap between SWFs and solo play. This means that people can play together and be no better or worse off than someone playing solo, and will eventually lead to better balancing since the devs won't have to constantly ask themselves if a good solo/SWrandoms perk is going to be utterly broken in the hands of an organised SWF.
---
That makes a lot more sense! It's a pretty convincing Myers, though.
---
Well, in PS4 this game kinda dead
---
How dare you to stop before Ricardo Milos
---
I think people just need to have a calm spirit to get past that beautiful pun
---
Don’t touch my challenge mode
---
You can‘t just post every outfit steve wore in the show and be like “tHis neEdS tO Be tHe nExT CoSmetIC“
---
My point is that saying "But looks like it's hard to understand" was completely uncalled for.
---
Awwww :3
---
No Mither is OP
---
It counters:
---
Bubba, Billy, Plague, Legion, Myers, Ghost Face, Trapper's pink add-on, NOED, MYC, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden, Devour, Sloppy, Stridor, Coulrophobia, A Nurse's Calling, and Remember Me.
---
It also makes it so you don't have to be healed after an unhook, makes many perks always active and makes it so the killer can't slug you for the 4k.
---
I was like October dead by daylight I am coming back after a few months
---
It's all about managing aggro, haha.
---
*"There is no aggro reset"*
---
I was rank 1, every other Survivor was red ranked and the Killer maybe was rank 1 but because he depiped the end screen showed rank 2 :)
---
Halloween = best holiday
---
Don’t @ me
---
So a Halloween event. Alrighty then
---
It also slightly increases the chances for you to find rarer items and addons more often. It's not much, but mostly for bragging rights and the cosmetics.
---
Still, he wasnt the only one
---
I see now! I play 75% killler and never saw that happen but now I see. That's crazy hahahaha thanks man
---
I'm a P3 Ash, so I'm focused 99% of the time I use any of these perks. There's some stigma of hatred for Ash mains and I don't get it. :P
---
...
---
Why are you saying that as if it invalidates my point? My entire point here is that asshole behavior is uncalled for. "He wasn't the only one" doesn't change that fact.
---
I was pretty much only surfing before I quit playing that game... so good.

---
O rly?
---
You seem to have a real strong hate for moris there my boy, personally never use them and since im not the best at survivor i haven came up against them that much but my guess is they are probably as annoying a key is on a good survivor team.
---
how exactly does it counter all those killers and some of those perks? I get that Bubba, Billy, Myers and GF can down you with one hit, but they would as well by having No Mither. How is that a counter?
---
I mean hillbilly was locked in a basment half his life because he was deformed, I think that's pretty sympathetic/tragic.
---
I love no mither the way it is because it’s basically DBD hard mode.
---
Yeah i need to get better at noticing items and stuff to maybe focus down the key person but then you probably get the complaints of tunneling and stuff as well.
---
But ash is just missing a tool. Buffy would have to mysteriously not have slayer strength. Otherwise she'd take a piece of broken pallet and stab the trapper in the brain pan.
---
This is fucking great, honestly. Love the theme for this. Love you for making ittt. Saw in general has been my favorite, sucks it didn't have a small jingle to it. Hope it gets added sometime.
---
I mean, all you need is an actual mold of William Shatners face. How hard can that be right?
---
Just as bad as ebony moris and instaheals tbh. All of these should just be flat out removed
---
Good morning, Ahaha
---
Yeah i can see that, each item gives its respective team a really strong push especially if the survivors or killer are good.
---
Killers when you play killer?
---
Yeah the match making and lobby system on console is genuinely embarrassing. Endless wait times, constant crashes, kicked from lobbies for no apparent reason, and after every single game an error message puts me back to the main menu.
---
Please no. Just make something original again. Please. We just had 3 licensed DLCs in a row.
---
Bamboozled!
---
But on a serious note, back before Deep Wound the No Mither rework was a hot topic. People wanted to make No Mither grant a permanent Borrowed Time’s Endurance status effect. Back then Endurance from Borrowed Time let you run for I think 15 seconds after getting hit. Mending wasn’t a thing and it still ticked down even while in chase. 
---
It would’ve made it so you CAN take 2 hits (but one might as well be lethal). It would let you tank an instadown and still escape and in case the killer lost you, you would get a chance to actually use the “pick yourself up” part of No Mither (Borrowed Time didn’t tell the killer where you got downed by the time running out back then)
---
You might wanna rethink that sentence
---
Stealth status effect block everything like T1 Myers, so I hope they patch it before giving it to pig, because them it will make 3 already shitty perks even worse (spine, Premonition OoO)
---
Those gosh darn survivers
---
Uh this doesn't make much sense unless you are just saying you are shit at playing killer
---
I play survivor too, just hit rank 3 again (I've been playing killer a bit much lately)
---
But yea it's way more chill and fun, even if you lose you're just like "Shit, guess I'll queue the next one"
---
There's no real fear or stress in playing survivor and if they want to TRULY balance the game they'll add a fair amount of stress to both sides instead of just giving the killer all the stress
---
*"What Is Dead May Never Die"*
---
That’s exactly what I’m saying
---
You telling me you would turn down a deadite Ash skin?
---
I swear whenever you bring a mori the survivors are always the purest poor little creatures that don't deserve this fate but normally every match is full of gangrenous bastards.
---
Lol the Dwight was literally me
---
I had it, it was weird as hell. I was just fuckin watching some other YouTubers and i get the notification for it just called Pennywise and i was like dope ima check that out and by the time i clicked it, it was gone. It was whack as fuck and this happened with Ghostface as well, so it is essentially confirmed at this point.
---
Ikr? The one on the right is so adorable.
---
Plus when stranger things and ghost face were rumoured they were not allowing anyone to say it on threads, removing every post. They’re doing it with pennywise too now.
---
So you aren't playing the game as killer to actually kill the survivors; furthermore, you make a unilateral decision to remove the survivors objective of surviving against the killer by simply letting them survive. This isnt even close to playing the game the way it is intended to be played.
---
The problem imo is the emblem system, never giving a pip unless you play perfectly meanwhile survivors can still pip easily even if they die with like 10k points
---
Causes me to bring Franklins thats for sure
---
20 seconds that may or may not be elongated due to sloppy butcher or 8 seconds as a reward for completing a side objective.
---
The part where I said it weakens botany knowledge was poorly thought through though.
---
Who long does Hallowed Blight go for? When does it start and end?
---
Not really, a mori is only useful if you’re like rank 10. As if you use a mori at red ranks you probably aren’t going to pip. Whereas survivors key counts as a normal escape. I think keys shouldn’t allow the survivors to pip, I think it should secure a black pip for them but not the same amount as escaping. It’s a stupid design
---
Yea lol they removed a few smaller channels YouTube videos of people who actually saw it happen lol. So i would say it is garunteed
---
Always go for the rescue. Fortune favours the bold.
---
Legion's original design was abysmal and basically reduced chases to a timed exercise with very little room for interaction on either side, particularly with Frank's. The design is still trash but at least there's engagement with chase mechanics now.
---
If they do this I technically have a DBD cosplay so fingers crossed
---
Yh but people are always reliable, I get heals straight after the unhook. Killers don’t run Franklin’s. Haven’t had a killer with Franklin’s in months.  It’s a waste of a slot and time, 32 seconds wasted where you could be half way through a gen by yourself. Then get healed later.
---
Spine Chill is what I live for. Is so useful and can give you a lot of information once you start picking details (like if the killer lost you, if he has discordance or things like that). Pair it with lightweight and you can run away before the chase begins, usually making the killer waste a lot of tima if he decides to follow.
---
Hes just salty. I hate being morid too, but thats just a part of the game. As are the keys. Which i can imagine are tremendously annoying to killers. That being said, I leveled up my hag to play killer 1 time and get adept hag. I know its RNG, but I have way more moris than I do keys and thats not because I dont get them, they just dont appear. So I like having keys as Im sure killers like bringing moris. In the same way that its meant to make it easier to win through other means, they are counterable. Technically the only "counter" to mori is to just not get downed lol, but yeah. Ive lost plenty of keys even with a good team, its easier to lose the ability to use your key than your mori. As long as youre at least an average player.
---
Meh, you could had moved.
---
Update?
---
Meh, I didn't realize what had happened. Read the other comments.
---
Thank you 👍🏻
---
What is the question? Can our eyeballs observe a digital character thinking? No i think its not possible
---
BBQ, because my bloodpoint thirsty ass can't get enough.
---
(I also like to know where to go next after I hook a survivor)
---
It's unsafe from the side with cinderblocks. You eventually want to get rid of it cause it's a free getaway/ checkpoint out of the building from 2 entrances and towards the fence window, but during a chase it's totally fine to not kick it. (Kick = free getaway to fence/ inside the building or basement of pain that can be looped even more effectively)
---
You're welcome
---
&gt; I tend to break every pallet that is dropped even if it's unsafe.
---

Please don't tell me you main Doc

dead hard
---
even though i can really easily fuck it up and die regardless, it still makes me feel omega safe when injured
---
My goal is usually to hope the killer closed the hatch for the extra BP and will let me exit through the gates. Hey, it happens (if you play Dweet).
---
Swastika bloodweb swastika bloodweb
---
Decisive 100%, hate tunnellers
---
Well the timer not going down during a chase makes perfect sense. BHVR should have fixed their definition of a chase to make it not be exploited. There are so many ways to have fixed the situation without blowing up a whole character lol
---
Yeah i've seen him on other posts being a little dick for no reason guess he just enjoys it. 
---
I get where you are coming from because if you focus the key its less of an issue and the mori's are more or less unavoidable. Have no real issue with either item because basically it is what it is they are in the game and it does add to the experience but i like to see other peoples opinions especially this community because you get a nice mix of certain mains and then the people who play both (who tend to have more reasonable and balanced opinion).
---
That is the sad truth, I see tunneling every single game.  That and slugging, shit gets old so fast.
---
Bond. My ultimate ride or die perk. It gives you so much useful information every second of the match, it’s insane. I can’t play without it now.
---
I don’t have any one perk for killer, my perks heavily depend on who I’m playing. I do love BBQ on most just for the bloodpoints though.
---
Probably a bug (one more) between the new map and her phase.
---
:) is autodidact so unpopular ? 
---
i guess with so many perks and survivors, i want each of them to be their own experience. So i create different loadouts for each survivor i have. Some of them ends up having less popular perks naturally. My aim is to have the max out of those ones with the best combinations. I am just trying to have a clear picture of what those combos should be thats all.
---
Yet they all end up the same way 😎
---
You instinctively began rage quitting during the clip. You understand why it's hard for us to believe you right?
---
I need Dead hard on my bill
---
I have to run Unbreakable since i got it. I tried for adept and kept getting slugged. Never again.
---
For like 3 days straight every game I had was awful. Teleporting backwards, lagging over windows I had just vaulted, all of it. So yeah I had gotten used to DCing at that point. I really don't give a fuck if you don't believe me.
---
About 36 seconds IIRC actually.
---
I've tried DS but I succ at hard skillchecks so that's a no for me for now. Gotta practice more!
---
This is true. I hate losing keys, but its so rewarding finding the hatch and just hopping out to safety lol. On the other hand I do like being moried to see the animation, but i hate losing XP. I havent played killer enough to really have a good opinion on hos it is using it and going against keys.
---
At that point, you've lost. Best you can hope for is hiding and bleeding out.
---
There is no need for any change to that situation, the killer found and downed the last remaining survivor AND closed their last chance of escape.
---
GG.
---
How is that your teammates fault? There a killer right behind him.
---
I'm not going over this again lol READ THE COMMENTS
---
Yeah! Alert is one of the perks I really want to unlock. It gives so much info about killer. Also, I don't like the bbq either, I'd rather run discordance for finding genrushing people.
---
When do we get a pig buff???
---
&gt; oh my god please leave this game.
---
She was TRYING to!
---
Being serious though I make sure Blendettes never make it out over any other survivor, they're just terrible people.
---
You'll fit right in with the other morons on this sub my dude, figure it out on your own or have some panzy explain it in a way where you don't get triggered like the whiny dumbfuck killermain you are.
---
Hoffman only follow the rules because he was blackmailed.
---
And even then it's clearly shown that he works against John's wishes and set up Amanda and everybody today die.
---
And it was sold in the series that he is a very sadistic person who likes causing pain to people held the only reason he hasn't killed people was because of the blackmail does the second John dies he practically goes on a killing spree for anyone who becomes a hindrance
---
Survivor: Quick and Quiet, Killer: Sloppy Butcher (unless I'm playing Plague).
---
No, they're sitting around waiting for you to die, they made it you vs them first.
---
I'm sure you tell yourself that when you get downed. Just like I'm sure you still genuinely believe what took place in this clip is your teams fault and not yours lol. But hey, I'm just some dude on this Internet 👌
---
Imagine if that was Myers, that would’ve scared the fuck out of me
---
No worries, I get that. At nearly 1.5k hours I very rarely see someone insta another person. It is very surprising when something like that happens.
---
Why was this frame by frame?
---
Leveling clown right now for pgtw. It sounds like such a nice perk at 3gen situations.
---
Trash lol. A rank 13 who DC’s and probably kills themselves on hook
---
&gt;That is the sad truth, I see tunneling every single game. That and slugging, shit gets old so fast.
---
I don't mind being slugged, still means you are not going back to a hook and your teammates can pick you up just fine if they know how to play. Killers slugging survivors don't actually progress the game for them since only hooking will remove you, it just gives them some room to breath by temporarily "pausing" a survivor who won't be able to progress generators, unhook and heal other survivors.
---
Sorry about the response time, much appreciated thank you
---
Oh really? I should give it a try then, it sounds really cool
---
Because OP’s fucking dumb
---
they were all screenshots, put together to move with the bass on the song
---
Sorry about the response time, much appreciated thank you for the help :)
---
Oh dang I didnt realize there was music.  Nice job
---
Hoffman did not follow the rules. 
---
He rigged the trap so his sister’s killer had no chance and was killed, that was how he was recruited in the first place.
---
He was the one who welded the doors shut for the guy in the chain trap, giving him no chance to escape.
---
He also was the one who put Kerry in the Archangel trap. Possibly he was the one who tampered with it.
---
Then of course there’s all the cops he killed, and eventually he killed Jill Tuck... 
---
IMO there’s hints that Hoffman set Amanda up to be tested by John and fail her test because he wanted to get rid of her, but it’s hard to know for sure how many traps she rigged herself. Amanda didn’t “always” want to kill people with traps. She was the one running the show in part 2. She could have killed detective Matthews at the end too, but she didn’t.
---
It’s underwhelming and kinda confusing and situational, is all. :) No prob with your plan. There are certainly non-meta theme builds. I.e 
---
Dance With Me + Quick and Quiet + Lithe + Inner Strength/Head On
---
Urban Evasion + Distraction + Spine Chill/Premonition. + Dark Sense 
---
Better Together + Kindred
---
I thought it just increases the animation speed of the vault?
---
Why be such a dick? She instahealed me and threw a pallet down while I was still behind her. That's not my fault. 
---
And I do NOT dc everytime I get downed. Or at all for that matter. My internet fucking sucked this weekend and it was getting on my last nerve. I don't understand why that's so hard to comprehend.
---
Because you’re brain dead and so is the namcy?

I don't but think whatever you want

I would never take it unless I had no other choice. It doesn't slow down progress because it won't block anything getting worked on. 16 seconds is incredibly mediocre considering its cooldown, and since it's from a down, they can keep safely working on gens while you hook people and its effect is then basically over.
---
If I want to stall the game, Pop is far stronger, if I want information, BBQ comes with double points. It just doesn't do anything that other perks don't do better.
---
Thank you for not being an asshole like half the other people in these comments
---
I love spine chill, it really helps for many situations but I can't fit it in my builds, unless i'm trying to go for a more immersed playstyle. I usually go with classic: bt - adrenaline - balanced + one choice of perk (which is iron will 99% of the time)

Wouldnt call it a counter if you have all of the effects that you would get anyway...
---
The beast from Over the Garden wall
---
His passive would be a thing that stacks over time and as skill checks are failed. It would cause the survivors to move slower and do things slower. Healing and finishing gens would cause you to lose stacks. Once you hit a certain number of stacks (20 or so), you turn into a tree and die. His active would cause the survivors to get the max number of stacks -1 and their field of view would be greatly reduced and he would move faster (similar to what the beast did to wirt in OTGW). While in this state, they cannot gain stacks and when it was over they go back to the number they started at.
---
that's why i always dc if there's a ghostface, and i will keep doing it until they fix revealing him properly
---
Community manager on discord said they will add it soon on stealth killers
---
This made my day uwu
---
It's not exactly unlisted. It includes "vaulting" in the perk description.
---
Go fuck yourself lmao. Why be such a biased cunt? You're so pitiful it looks like you could need a hug.
---
Not sure how people are missing the joke but funny stuff friend
---
It should just convert you to the obsession if you're the last remaining survivor.
---
That guarantees you the new obsession score events either way, and would make you immune to effects like Remember Me.
---
I mean not getting a pip is a downside at high ranks though.
---
If we don't count ruin, I'd go with discordance as well, it's such a nice perk
---
Not when I’m killer
---
I love it oh my god
---
Damn that would be a very good idea for a new killer... Pennywise for example.... it would make you not trust yourself
---
Sometimes I debate if I like discordance or whispers for tracking.... I dont know...
---
I get what you are saying, but I think it would me much better and give us more options. Right now as a killer, there are only 2 things you can do against high rank SWF groups. You cam lobby dodge which is lame and will take forever to find a match, or you can play one of the 3 killers in the game that has a chance at all against them.
---
And, if killers resort to using the strongest killers perks and addons 100% of the time just to have a chance against SWF, then they will utterly crush any team of 4 solo que survivors. Leaving survivors the option to either find a 4 man crew and only play with them (takes a lot more time and coordination than many of us have) which not everyone can do, simply stay in yellow/green ranks (again not very practical) or just get used to getting crushed by nurses and spirits.
---
If you could use comms with randoms and killers were balanced around that, suddenly a lot would change. Killer mains would be able to use mid tier killers again, and solo survivors would have the choice to use comms and gain the advantages they offer.  The choice would then be if you want to purposely put yourself at a disadvantage my muting people or turning off the mic. Right now you are put at a disadvantage simply by deciding to play solo instead of SWF, so I dont see how this would be any worse TBH.
---
Guys. I'm aware my reaction time is slow. You can stop pointing it out.
---
I really loved it while leveling ghostface, it's  a really good perk for stealth killers.

I'm so glad survivors are doing this now. Wraith is my favorite killer and I love matches where everyone stays on generators instead of healing themselves.
---
May as well photobomb since it's probably a ghost face
---
Literally everything you stated happens to me every god damn time. Yet they pretend like there’s nothing wrong.
---
once you press E button you should be invincible, just like in Dark Souls games and this is how it should work. Is it that hard to make it work properly, devs?
---
Whispers usually make me waste time in that area, I'd rather run discordance. Buut if you wanna change it up, give spies from the shadows a try! It helps a ton with both whispers and discordance in case they try to sneak around

I hate how Myers doesn't proc Spine Chill in tier 1. It's so bullshit and inconsistent.

His power: throws himself on survivors and blows themselves up no hook needed. Another Monokuma respawns after each detonation
---
You sir, you are the teammate I need as I loop the killer.

I agree with this, although it technically wouldn’t be free if they shipped it with the DLC
---
Nothing personal kid
---
Then hitbox department needs the get their shit together.
---
Tunneling just means that the killer likes you a lot :)
---
I am not saying it aint, but paladins is like shitty overwatch
---
No i mean as why should i lose because someone got disconnecte, but yeah hopefully they work on it because someone leaving is the biggest problem right now
---
Learn to count
---
Damn you sounds like a real asshole
---
Yeah dude you're totally right they left and i lost so i'm asshole
---
If I already lost the game should end?
---
haha wtf
---
Kindred is a god tier solo perk.
---
There are punishment for DCing but it is aimed at chronic derankers that will DC multiple times in a short period of time.
---
Hiding behind gens does work sometimes. The red of the gen can block your red aura. But yeah lockers are the 100% safer option.
---
Finally someone said it. Survivors complaining about tunneling are trying to find a petty reason to justify the most broken perk for survivors. Same goes for slugging, at this point I know most people have DS so I leave em on the ground a bit to ride the timer out.
---
Yea Saw is one of my favs too! :D
---
Also I always wished for a theme when your RBT activates. I think someone else posted something similar in here somewhere.
---
Extra idea: I always wanted Billy on top of the boxes to laugh at you whenever you fail a skill check near a generator or simply stay too long in the boxes radius
---
ikr????? D:
---
Survivor bond because I get so much information. Killer well I'm using the same build with all thanatophobia, dying light, ruin, whispers
---
1: I am not a survivor main lol
---
2: no need to be toxic
---
3: it’s a concept. Something that just came to mind. I’d gladly balance it out but I need suggestions. Raging ain’t gonna do anything
---
Damn it, yeah this has been happening to me with a couple of games, its terrifying.
---
Suggestions please :|
---
Your opinion, I don't mind. Personally I *enjoy* Paladins more.
---
Im proud
---
This "ghostface has to be on the center of the screen" is bs
---
I lost count of How many times i was looking straight at him but the reveal wouldn't happen because he moved slightly to the left, and then he mark me
---
Literally just wait you might even get another kill on someone trying to get them up
---
I always stop to pet the horsie.
---
I've often pondered the usefulness of pulling a survivor off the hook and pausing the sacrifice progression, enabling DS and also not granting you additional points if you hook them again. 
---
I mostly thought of this in the context of "Oh, actually, that was the guy I wanted to give the hatch." But also "Ah, now that I activated BBQ and Chilli I know where the last survivor is but I can't afford to let this one kill himself on the hook. Let's slug him and hook him again later when I get the last guy."

I love bloodhunts but as a casual player I must admit I find it hard to get motivated to play outside of them.  I've only got the original 4 survivors + David to 50.  I've not prestieged anyone, I've barely touched killers.  The amount of work to do is daunting but I recognise that other people have put in that work so I suppose I'll need to as well.
---
They could at least fix losing your offering if someone/you crashes during loading.  Losing an escape! cake is gutting.
---
I think lockers are probably the real issue here. If you want to be cheeky you could run iron maiden, but otherwise just pay attention to what gens have activity when you patrol.  Discordance may also be beneficial

was expecting him to be at like 80% completion when the killer pop up in the distance, sees him on the totem, stop moving, just stares at him, waits for the totem to break, bill turning to the killer, both stare at each other for 2 more seconds, then killer dcs

Why are you going out of your way to be a dick to someone on the internet? Sure, they stood still after being healed, but nobody really expects to be insta-healed by randoms, so it came as a surprise. Their team could have made better choices as well.

That rank 3 was probably a boosted scrub that wants to reack high rank just for bragging rights, seen a couple of them shits, only doing the safes gens, running to hide the second they hear a heartbeat, camping the hatch when 2 people are dead.
---
It means prestige 3. It means someone has gotten the same character to level 50 3times and has reset the character 3 times losing all perks and addons to unlock the bloody cosmetic set for the character
---
People at lower ranks usually are too scared and just ran away while people at higher ranks are going to try to juke it
---
One of the best memes this sub as ever done. Sometimes I remember the post at random and will just proceed to laugh

No it really really isn't.  They're about as cheesy as each other.  This is written by somebody that doesn't play both sides equally at a competitive level.  It sounds biased.  Get to red ranks and start playing keys in 30% of your lobbies than come back to this thread lol.  Keys are cheesy as shit and require no skill and probably shouldn't be in the game.  Moris are cheesy as shit and require no skill and probably shouldn't be in the game.  I can respect people that say both are stupid as shit or both are perfectly fine (because as least that opinions consistent even though I disagree with it) but defending one while talking against the other is just impossible for me to treat that person like an objective player.
---
If the start day is the 9th and it ends when the sale ends we'd get more than a week of extra time compared to last year's Blight.
---
As the quality of players increases, so does the players efficient use of utility increase. A player at a high rank will attempt to get maximum value out of their DS by playing much more aggressive while having it up. You have to learn to identify the differentiation in play and slug to counter it.
---
That might not be the example that you're talking about, but a solid 90% of the time people complain about it... from top streamers to random lower rank players, this is the case most of the time.
---
I wasn't telling you how to play. I was telling you my opinion. Also careful before you fall off that high horse, you might get hurt.

It's from a show called Unprofessional Fridays where they played Starbound

Here's the yt video: youtube.com/watch?v=8uyTWFUNdxc

what lol
---
They did during May of this year (link provided), and before that during the October 5th livestream back in 2017. Both sets showed that solo was the majority of players, with the infamous 4 man being an extremely low percentage. However, survival rates naturally increased with the party size. (Not a dramatic difference but one worth noting.)

Nice artwork! Keep up the good work!
---
Not so much a new one.
---
This is what Doctor should have been all along.
---
unless i can start cleansing almost immediately after spawning, i normally hang around for a bit to see if the killer will patrol their totem first and leave before i start cleansing.
---
“It’s Chris the killer! Run!”
---
The sensibility ruins it for me. If we could have a higher sens, then we could do 180’s and hit survivors after blinking. But right now, we just kinda rely on nurse’s broken hit boxes.
---
Thank you:&gt;
---
It means they are no longer P2.
---
T1: Undetectable by all perks, tiny terror radius, slow and has short lunge
---
T2: Normal speed and lunge, small terror radius, basically a normal killer with small terror radius
---
T3: Extreme lunge, all survivors are downable in one hit, with certain addons this lets the player kill survivors from a standing position.
---
Mate it’s embarrassing how bad it is. No idea why bhvr are given a free pass to be constantly awful.
---
I guess the problem you're having is in the deviousness emblem? The one where you use the killers ability? For me that's always the issue, cause when everyone is sick, no one cleanses (Which is what they should do).
---
For me to force more points, I just vomit on like everything I see and if the survivor is really close to me in a chase and there's no pallets or windows near so they can escape, I vomit on them and you get more deviousness for it.
---
I'd assume you'd also have problems with chaser because statistically speaking your points would be halved if they're broken and you're chasing them. Genuinely breaking chase when they reach something like a Jungle Gym which has its pallet up may be the difference in gaining more points. Jungle Gym are hard as it is (That's not me complaining about them) so once that chase ends and you find another survivor to chase, you get another stack of chase points from the new chase than finishing the old one. 
---
Something like that may help, but remember you have to think if you can afford to the infection everything you see and well, you don't want long chases so leaving someone at a Jungle Gym to pressure elsewhere is always ideal. That's the kind of juggling you have to do anyway, but cause the chases are typically half the length of other M1 killers due to them being broken yeah it's more advantageous to do it as the plague for the more points it gets cause it's just hard to pip with her in general. I hope this helps in any way!
---
Hopefully you have a Amazing Spooktober Bud :D
---
Right now the decoy just stands there (menacingly). 
---
They just need to walk forward in a straight line and it would be a huge improvement
---
Literally vomit on everything. I spew on lockers, gens, totems, survivors, pallets EVERYTHING. I even vomit on pallets before breaking them.
---
Or maybe making it so he can't gain stalk while in the process of being exposed. It would take a lot longer to build stalk like this clip, but the survivor who is literally trying their best without putting themselves into a position to get hit can still force him into a chase. I usually prefer just using Ghostface's
---
 stealth to get a free hit before a chase instead of exposing them anyways. with some other circumstances if I think I can manage the exposed before they run.
---
Just bring mirage in from apex
---
I thought survivors couldn't see moris on the loading screen?
---
BBQ just because BP, and bond and borrowed time
---
I already read these, you are not telling me anything of worth. But thanks for the effort and looking that up for me, appreciate it
---
Getting out of tier one can be really easy if you use the memorial add ons and use something to reduce TR like M&amp;A
---
Inreresting will definately check it out and give it a try! Thanks!
---
Franklin's Demise.   Super satisfying for the dc on down crowd.
---
Yea they really don’t do much I could see where it could freak out a new player but anyone that’s played enough I’m sure it doesn’t phase them.
---
Agreed, Ghostface is superior and by far more stealthy, especially if you crouch and like you said, he can lean to stalk as well.
---
If you're hitting your skill checks, you shouldn't be looking for ruin. If they have a problem with ruin then they can find it themselves. Of course if you run into one, you should cleanse it (but keep an eye out for Haunted Grounds or Devoured Hope).
---
Now this is really helpful, i really dont chase in jungle gyms anyways but vomiting on people and start vomiting on everything, thanks guys!

They definitely could tweak his mini game of break him out of night shroud. I main Ghostface and have a ton of hours on him. Sometimes someone can break you out of shroud while behind a wall and you can't see them, but then there are times when I play survivor and I've literally run up to Ghostface while looking dead at him and it doesn't even attempt to break him out of night shroud. It's definitely frustrating and his different add ons that change the detection range just make it more frustrating for the survivor side.
---
Yeah. His outfit from the end of Season 3 with the big coat.
---
Items have adding which can make skill check areas bigger. The perk Technician {Fing} makes a failed gen skill check have  a 50% chance of causing no alerts. Also there are skill check simulators for you to practice on, check the Guides thread. 
---
Lvl 50 isn’t the same as Rank. Rank is the colored circle over their head and is supposed to mean what skill they are. Rank is what matchmaking is Supposed to be based on but it’s fucked lately. Rank also resets every 13th of be month.

Deerstalker. My eyes are really bad, especially in low light, and Deerstalker is the only way I find downed survivors on some maps.

Yup, look at Trapper for example, he refused an Entity impaled him with hooks :)
---
Nice! The show had a lot of good options. 
---
Asylum Ash with straight jacket would be cool too.
---
I had an idea of using pallet stuns to charge the perk. Since Ash pretty much fights his demons very well, and Pallet Stunning or flashlight blinding are really the only things we can do to a killer to "damage" them.
---
I do need to ask, are you sure this was done intentionally?
---
I’ve tried many times to let someone run through a pallet so I could slam it on the killer. Almost always it puts the survivor back on the wrong side. 
---
Only once have u managed to pull it off correctly, and that was last night 😱
---
It literally tells you how to pip though, which was your question..? ~~Honestly Im baffled.~~

you seem REALLY mad for no reason. They wanted to know the time but so far youve only given them percentages. What if they CANT do the math but they came here for answers but you were just an ass for no reason?

I agree that many killers are weak, but there isn’t a single killer that isn’t viable with the right build. Some are viable more often with a wider range of builds, but all killers can be viable. For example, watch NotOtzdarva’s leatherface video. I think that people end up using the weaker killers as an excuse to ignore broken ones. I don’t know how to fix spirit, I can’t think of any changes that will actually impact her without gutting her. That’s really unfortunate, but she’s incredibly unfun to play against. So I think we need to get together as a community and have an honest discussion about what can be done with spirit to make her fun without butchering her
---
It’s a perk with one use per game and it’s after 5 gens are completed, I don’t really see it a problem. Sometimes, you chase a survivor and Adrenaline kicks in, it sucks but it’s not every game it happens. No need to change the perk.
---
I hate that people think overwatch made all that shit up. The only problem I had with paladins is that some of their characters were just reskinned OW characters like Makoa is just road hog with Winston's bubble shield.
---
way too much diversity to see a trend
---
I tried giving you some helpful tips in the first post which I spend some of my time on. Instead of asking some constructive questions you decided to shit on it with your nasty attitude. I checked your previous posts and noticed you're like this all the time. 
---
I'm thinking that this type of behaviour is a result of some child abuse that carried over in your unconscious.
---
Completely agree that the reveal is janky, i literally had a stare down with 1 yet it wasn't even revealing him since he wasn't in that sweet spot of my screen.
---
Yes of course it would be against a meta (omega blink probably) nurse with all the perks and addons that entails. And it would be a meta crew complete with insta heals and crazy fast toolboxes. I would honestly love to see the results and would totally help set it up. But as we have both said I alone do not have the power. Maybe the community will organize something like this, it would be great.
---
And with your comment you seem to be implying that I said every single optimal SWF group will all 4 escape each time, when in fact I said no such thing. Only that I believe am optimal group would have a survival rate over 50%, where currently the overall is below 50. My point was most certainly not that meta SWF groups have a 100% survival rate. That would be absurd. My point was an optimal crew may have a rate closer to 60-65%. Where meme groups (or just really bad groups idk) may have a rating of say 25% and when you combine that all together you get the stats we see.
---
My only point was I do not believe those numbers represent a meta, optimally playing SWF groups chances (even against an equally meta killer) but rather have been skewed by various factors, such as meme groups etc.
---
I dont even think we disagree, you are just telling me to prove my point with numbers that simply do not exist, and thus we are forced to speculate. I am unable to gather the data you say I meed.for my point to be valid, so we are at an impasse. But I do hope you at least get what I was trying to say now.

Lets say best different builds for all styles of gameplay, then :)
---
Well acutally its not flaired as a question btw 😅. But i made 2 nonetheless: anybody having same issues? And does she gains less bloodpoints? I see you are trying to help but i know the emblems and how to pip i just find it more difficult on her, and well i can know the theory of how to perform an oper heart surgery but if i can get tips on actual surgeons i would appreciate it most. But again, thanks for responding
---
He had to stop to open the gates, wasting his speed boost that would've allowed him to escape. How does that not make sense?
---
Naroi naori!
---
Take me into your loving arms
---
The only downside to it is you have to wait for the gen to be unblocked if you want to kick Pop on it and that’s seconds being wasted
---
Basically, you have to fix special generators or hook people on special hooks. When you do that you get extra BP and event currency. Eventually, racking up enough event currency will let you buy an outfit without spending actual money.
---
Wha-
---
A good way to prepare for a skill check is to listen for the tell-tale sound cue that plays before every skill check. When you hear the sound cue, you won't be caught off-guard and you'll be ready to hit it as the sound comes right before the actual check shows up.
---
It’s weird because it seems certain people have different luck. I see the Shape more than anyone followed by GF, Cannibal, Billy and legion. Recently I’ve seen a bunch of legion.
---
You both need a nap.
---
Just checked your post history -  I love all the ones you've done so far! I think the clown might be my favourite, but I'm pretty biased towards the thicc boi
---
What's wrong with that is it doesn't reward you for doing anything.  If someone was afk the whole match, got hooked, their teammates unhooked them and healed them and ran away, they'd have MoM before the killer downed them a second time.  If you can be AFK and make a perk work, there's a fundamental flaw with it.
---
You don't 'skillfully' get hit by the killer 3 times.  If it was "make the killer whiff 3 times" then I'd be 100% for it, but getting hit?  You're being rewarded for the killer doing THEIR job, and that's just fundamentally flawed.
---
Nah it's fine where it is.  Good killer rarely get d striked period these days.  We have to literally choose to play into it for it to even function unlike how disgusting and cheesy it used to be.  The only time it feels too strong is when there is an open exit gate but I mean technically if your game went that rough where everyones still up in that scenario you lost anyways so it doesn't really matter much.
---
Oh, so in Hearthstone there was a bottom rank when new players are put into, and once you get out if it, you will never get that deep again.
---
Like, new players would be put on ranks 25-20 and never losing ranks, only getting up, until rank 20, when they are matched with older players normally.
---
So, there's nothing like it on DbD?
---
What rank are you? Lower ranks (20-15) sometimes have a hard time finding matches depending on the time of day in the area that you live in. You might just have to wait a very long time to find a match that will actually fill up and launch.
---
&gt; but people are always reliable
---
No they aren't.
---
Xbox One version is pretty solid if you have one...
---
Hi dead, I'm dad
---
What else would it be
---
Yes. Its the most fun game on Xbox One, IMO.
---
Wasn't just a green mori lol
---
Big brain
---
There is a noise that plays, but it doesn't show what trap was sabotaged iirc.
---
yea im rank 19 EU and I literally just searched 15 minutes...
---
i think it was demi
---
I hate when I get slapped silly due to the fact that every map is just a barren, flat square area with nothing to block line of sight from a survivor doing generators. I wish they would add buildings and walls and things to the maps.
---
I’m so down
---
1 month ago, when surge was on PTB and when I made this comment, it wouldn't apply Surveillance
---
We're Gonna Live Forever and BBQ and Chili. I think you know why
---
*Inbred Race car noises*
---
Bamboozle!
---
but we got shards tho
---
I actually really loved it. I only saw toxic teabaggers get punished by it and it was the best thing ever.
---
Lol. I hate those guys, just waste our time. What is fun to be survivor if you are just gonna stay hiding.
---
No fix for the “disconnected from host” error on PS4 that robs you of your 5k survival points and exp?
---
hanging round with the wrong people then
---
Had a trapper do this to me last night.  I went around a rock towards a pallet, saw the back of him go around the rock and then all of a sudden he was in my face hitting me.
---
What other obsession perks?
---
No one runs MoM
---
Almost no one runs OoO
---
No one ever runs Sole Survivor which has no benefits for the obsession
---
DS doesn't increase your chances to become the obsession anymore. it makes it so there is one in the game if no other obsession perks are present, but it gives everyone an equal, 25% chance of becoming it.
---
They will BECOME the obsession once they hit you with DS, which you shouldn't be hit by anyway (but it's not always avoidable)
---
r/unexpectedjojo and also ROADA ROLLA DA!
---
Best guess would be it's gonna coincide with hallowed blight(if it returns this year)
---
I completely understand! For me, after I’m done maxing people out it’ll be based on my perks. I like trying new perks and different combos, so if I’m able to do them in game and still die, it’ll be a win for me :) like, make a pebble deceive the killer 3 times, max out auto-didact, use technician on a gen without doing skill checks and complete it, escape a chase with lithe and dance with me, deliverance in front of the killer then use DS, make flip flop-tenacity-unbreakable-boil over meme build and have it be useful, etc. these are my wins :)
---
Malicious is the easiest emblem to get iri on with her since survivors don’t cleanse and remain broken the whole game. Gatekeeper is easy with certain perks (Ruin, PGTW, Overcharge, etc.). Devout and Hunter are the two categories you really have to work for.
---
Killer main here, totally support proposal.
---
5.31 gb for hotfixes 😵
---
Cursing shows you're not angry and upset.
---
Also learn how to use proper grammar, salt lick.
---
I feel like you think you should be getting killer stuns on your loops and that isn't the case.
---
It sometimes throws me off as killer, but I also don't play doc much
---
So then the Holocaust must’ve been fire as fuck, metaphorically and literally.
---
I would disagree with you, but they nerfed mobility like a year ago and I never got into it again.
---
An EDM composer for DBD?  Seriously how random is this idea lol?  Also using the term composer for EDM seems like a bit much.  Isn't that like referring to a McDonalds fry cook as Head Chef?
---
I kind of liked it, I never benefited from it as killer but we had a couple of complete whipes because of it as survivors. IMO it makes it exciting not to know how much time is left.
---
The same thing happened to me once. Good times.
---
Roadhog is a rip off of another character though
---
This would genuinely be a great perk
---
I literally didn't say anything about looping taking skill. I said that they were easy to shut down.
---
This is the comment I need more than just getting bashed In the head. I’ll look into it ;)
---
UURRGGGHHHHH EUGGGGHHHH
---
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
---
You'd be surprised
---
Just use Ruin. Then the survivors have a 2/3 chance of becoming exposed
---
Dead Hard for extending loops and STBFL because it punishes survivors that aren’t aware that you have it. The countless times i’ve gotten a down at a hook during a save bc of this perk is amazing.
---
There's a difference between a genre of shooting games and literally copying character concepts and design.
---
It is random. Why not make the game more convuluded when we got Kate and Jeff as artists. Haha.
---
Honestly I don’t know what I was thinking but i guess ok?
---
I though blendettes already had that title.
---
to be fair, both can be considered S tier &gt;.&gt;
---
If a killer goes away from the hook, but doesn't get into a chase before the unhook (without BBQ its a real possibility) and comes back only to see the unhooked dude and doesn't see the savior, taking a chase so they don't have 4 survivors on gens is a bitch move because...? It isn't tunneling in that specific scenario, which the OP was describing. If they drop chase to chase the unhooked survivor, yeah, you can consider that tunneling reasonably (I'd agree btw) and he deserves to get DS'd. But taking a chase for pressure is NEVER a bitch move. 
---
For the record, I will advocate for going after the savior because you'd waste time with DS and possibly BT if they unhooked soon after hooking, while you can ignore that and go after the savior for more pressure (no DS and the unhooked will probably heal, spending time off gens) so you will have two, if not three off gens for a bit, which is a helluva lot better than 1 off gens. 
---
But if you only see the unhooked, chasing them isn't tunneling. It's bad luck because the savior just hides and you were found before them, which DS counters (along with actual tunneling). It isn't tunneling in that specific scenario.
---
Tell me, is this scenario tunneling or being a bitch?
---
Clown eventually hooks you, and goes off to find someone else. He has shown to not drop chase for an unhook. However, before he starts a chase, you are unhooked by a Meg. He comes back to find you, but not Meg cause she Sprint Burst off to Narnia. Would chasing you so he doesn't have 4 survivors on gens be a bitch move? I'd say no cause you gotta keep up pressure, ESPECIALLY with someone like Clown. They aren't a bitch for trying to win. He has shown to not tunnel, and just chases whoever he finds. 
---
TLDR: coming back to the hook when not in a chase and only finding the unhooked person, and thus chasing them isn't a bitch move.
---
Ah okay, thanks!
---
Killers before NOED activates: Fast
---
NOED active: *Human FTL travel*
---
It is a nice perk the entire game.  You're in for a treat.  It has saved so many games for me against aggressive swf groups.
---
Yeah I think if they could run he would have a little too much abilities like not only can he shock u preventing u from vaulting and in tier 3 from healing and stuff but then also would have fake pallets(with the add on) and walking decoy killers... I don't think that would be such a great idea maybe if they make a new killer it could be an ability but adding it to the doctors abilities wouldn't be so great
---
we'll make it, too many dumbasses wasting time healing ;)
---
I had no idea you could do that.
---
I didn't know that, but even if that's the case paladins was definitely made with OW in mind.
---
\*personnel
---
Overwatch copied Engineer, added a CLOAKED hero who can hack things (sabotage) etc etc your logic is making no sense.
---
*Disconnect now or prepare to Cry!*
---
Yeah I've had that bug before
---
Yeah you can join together in a lobby and play matches.
---
Of at most 10 people
---
It looks like something from the game "Inside"
---
Both
---
You can do kill your friends but unless you have a full 5 party it isn’t as fun. And you don’t get bloodpoints. That’s how my friends and I try out characters and killers and different skills before we jump into games.
---
So, unless I agree with your argument that playing as the killer is unfun, I am off-topic? I don't know what makes you think this is a fight, I know the truth hurts sometimes. I'm just replying to your comments which, taking under consideration of your mental health I might consider to be more delicate with you. 
---
In my second question, you answered it as if you already knew what I was going to say, you continue being dismissive and arrogant because you think you're on the right. How am I suppose to think of a person who's acting up like this? 
---
Unless you're underage (which you shouldn't be considering it is a game from 18+ years old and up) all I can think of is either you're deranged, or how a psychiatrist would conclude, abused in the childhood. It's not a secret that people with such a negative way of thinking were somehow abused in their childhood. Patients spend years in psychotherapy to get to the bottom of their underlying issues. 
---
If you're also in UK there is a great health system and you can get a therapist on the NHS.
---
Paladins did take inspiration from Overwatch later in it's development cycle, such as the lower TTK, and smaller maps with one OBJ, but all the characters original (Or as original as a man with a shield, and a runny-shooty man can be)
---
I mean I'm not sure what to tell you. A lot of high level killers run it. The perks slow the game down by forcing them to heal. Which will take longer than usual with sloppy. If they heal, they're not doing gens. If they don't heal, gens are slow and they risk getting hooked instantly. I'm not sure what your definition of bad is, but it's definitely a great perk.
---
 Restart your Xbox, should fix it
---
The first time I ever played against the doctor I had no clue he made imaginary copies of himself.  I was *fucking terrified* that match.
---
I wish dbd could consistently pump out that level of terror.
---
You can play with others in 2 main ways: 
---
1) You can survive with friends against a random killer (with random survivors filling in the other spots to make 5)
---
2) You can do a custom mode with up to 4 friends. The custom mode would be just you and your friends (up to 5 people but can be less) with one as the killer and the rest as survivors. In this mode, I believe all perks/add-ons/offerings are available on everyone to use but BP is not earned.
---
I only ever be nice to survivors when: someone DC's in the beginning, the chase want long enough and they kinda suck (for my bloodpoints sake), and they are actually babies, I usually let 1 person go. Just my own little go around.
---
Well they aren't really falling for it its just a thing that u you have to guess. Them falling for it would mean there is a working and consistand method for checken if she is phasing but since there is none I think it would be better described as missguessing
---
I mean at least Kate plays an instrument lol.  EDM is just a dude messing around with Casio presets and a drum machine lol.  It's the music equivalent of paint by numbers kits from Joanne Fabrics.
---
Best described as mind games. You’re right. But I’m just adding my two cents. If they have a flashlight and you want to try it, my way helps in some cases.
---
i think i see it
---
TBH it's just a matter of practice. Keep playing and soon they'll be easy.
---
You can try those simulators and if they help you, great. But in my experience hitting skill checks in isolation against a blank screen with nothing else going on is easy. Maintaining focus during tense game situations in a whole different ball game.
---
Then Devour Hope. Hag is generally good.
---
Is the legacy and like the golden stuff the same?
---
https://youtu.be/DkDyYBg5oYw?t=4m16s

Ohhh I get it now
---
ok boomer
---
An explosion and a family emergency aren't related to lag at all, so no.
---
It's not a hill I'm gonna die on, since I really don't care. I don't like any of those games, I just think it's amusing how close you can clone a game without being sued. You're obviously invested in Paladins and like to defend it.
---
Paladins and Overwatch visually look like exactly the same game. Same mechanics. Even a lot of the heroes have almost exactly the same aesthetic. Those similarities just don't exist between TF2 and Overwatch. Seems like a coping mechanism to be honest.
---
This would probably be something to talk to BHVR Customer Support about.
---
Cowardly athletic looks like a perk I would use
---
Afraid so. You always want to buy the DLC through steam because it's pretty much always cheaper than buying with Cells. If you used Shards that's a better deal but you mentioned paying "again".
---
Just wait until a steam sale comes along and pick the dlc up for half off if you really want the extra outfits.
---
It's not for free. You need to learn how to comprehend a paragraph. I literally stated that when we purchase the DLC, I feel that cosmetics should be included. When did I ever say I was entitled to anything? If I purchased the DLC, I have a right to my opinion so stop making something out of nothing and actually understand the point I'm trying to make.
---
aww I love it ♥ He looks so adorable
---
That’s just do dumb and scummy for them to do lol. I play on PS4 btw
---
P3 is still broken, certain bushes near houses hide her and the front and back of the Myers house on that map hide her 100% have to many videos of killers walking past ( no headphones ALERT)
---
Jigsaw map the ice room completely hides her
---
Ormond map bushes hide her p3 and her white ball gown cosmetic hides her in any jungle gym corner on Ormond.
---
Any dark lighting maps with the brick jungle gyms will 100% hide P3 even with headphone killers as I’ve had multiple killers search for me in brick jungle gyms for a solid minute because I knew they could hear my breathing.
---
Emoting while hiding will prevent AFK crows when the killer is searching for you for over 30 seconds and you can’t risk moving. 
---
Tall grass hiding spots are becoming a hard no for hiding spots as it’s become typical for any Claudette main and killers have figured it out, but any killer in Green ranks or above still haven’t figured out the above hiding locations and you will be able to tell if the killer has headphones in these hiding spots when trying to break chase
---
Myers and pig map are the best in my personal experience for losing killers at these locations. 
---
Ps4 here and I’m so happy not every killer is a Reddit user because otherwise I wouldn’t get away with half the crap I posted :,)
---
Omega gg
---
precisely. it was absolutely terrifying........ the first time.
---
&gt;	Fixed an issue that sometimes caused a Survivor in the Survive With Friends group not to make it into the public lobby. 
---
Thanks, BHVR, this was a nightmare.
---
Doing wen, too?
---
I used to have several mandatory perks for survivor but broke myself out of that habit recently by forcing myself to experiment with different loadouts.  Glad I did.  I used to feel naked without Dead Hard.  
---
Currently my go to perk is Small Game as survivor.  I'm the fastest hex cleanse in the west and I am the nightmare NOED gamers cannot wake from.  My dull totems!  Also with the rise of Freddy I can use it to continuously toss all his fake pallets to hell out my teamates.
---
My go to killer perk at present is PGTW.  I don't see that changing.  It is so unbelievably clutch especially against aggressive swf's who rush gens all injured for their Adrenaline procs.
---
I never said you are not allowed to enjoy it - but i also wont call IT a good game when you got masterpieces like sekiro, god of war
---
That would be just hurtful
---
Never played the third one after the horrible animation. I actually enjoyed Ultra Despair Girls.
---
**OH YEAAAAAH**
---
You are just being a cheap ass and wants to pay the original DLC price and at the same time get the cosmetics for the characters in the DLC. That is called being entitled as fuck
---
I hate when people call it mind games because there are so many options for the killer and u can't really go wrong if u know what your doing. It is a different thing with moonwalk ING I guess that could be considered mind gaming caus you are actually making an effort to trick the survivor wich actually needs some skill with spirit in most cases it doesn't really matter especially if the survivor is hit or if she has good add-ons wich make it nearly impossible to not get downed or in some cases as u may call it "mindgamed"
---
A timeline of popular Mobas: 
---
Dota &gt; Lol &gt; Smite &gt; Paragon &gt; Overwatch &gt; Paladins 
---
Note how far down the list Overwatch is. It's also not the first 3d Moba.  Probably the only thing Overwatch brought to the genre is 'proper' shooting mechanics, which while it is an evolution of the genre, at the end of the day Overwatch is a ripoff of Smite. As for character design, pretty much every Overwatch character can be traced back to Dota or Lol characters. Paladins is no worse than Overwatch as far as stealing ideas is concerned.
---
Unfortunately not. It used to be that ranks 20-15 filled that role but at the moment the matchmaking system is bugged. They are trying to fix it but I'm a rank 7 with 1300+ hours in the game and I'm getting matched up with players who are on their second day at rank 18. #prettygoodjobsofar :P
---
RIP desync bug. As annoying at it was, the clips of survivors getting impaled inches from the exit gate were hilarious.
---
How long are gens blocked for with TT ? I don’t remember actually
---
I haven’t heard about this one. How is he unusable?
---
So im checking my PC now, and yeah, so i never had auto update on so I'm 3 updates behind. Heres to hoping it fixes it! Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Relatable
---
Tbh Steve’s on a whole are just weak.Nancy has overall a decent perk set imo
---
Sadly, it rarely happens, maybe like twice a year
---
Tbh BHVR should just do gens and hooks like they did in the past, nine of this mini game bullshit
---
Aww thank you q.q :&gt;
---
I would not class Overwacth as MOBA. At all.
---
I'm guessing you just saw this power hour by the multiple memes?
---
**-SCOOB! Where are you?!:** Pressing "E" activates this ability causing Shaggy to scream "WHERE ARE YOU?!". All survivors can see each other's aura's for 4/4.5/5 seconds. Creates an audio cue for the killer. Causes exhaution.
---
&gt;Whenever the game messes up in a way that hurts a survivor: “Waaaaah, that was unfair, killer has to let me go now to make up for it.”
---
When the game messes up in a way that hurts the killer: “Sucks to suck, get gud scrub.”
---
The difference is most of the time these are latency based and the killer is the host.
---
Me warping back to the same spot 6x in a row and you downing me is not a bug, It's just your shitty host.
---
15 seconds, but generators being repaired while the ability activates aren’t blocked, so you can tell which gens are in need of immediate popping
---
when the killer brings an exhaustion addon
---
An oil tanker for you!
---
How the fuck am I being cheap? I literally bought the DLC and I wanted the cosmetics to be included since it was a more expensive one than the prior ones. People like you literally try to make something out of nothing like damn. The prior DLCs came with cosmetics so I was disappointed that there weren't any this time around so foh.
---
They should walk directly towards the nearest survivor. That would be way more effective against survivors and much more informative to killers. Would be great, even if they were only add ons.
---
Ever since the last Hallowed Blight I’ve maintained a stance that the Pustula Flowers have some kind of negative effect on the Entity. I mean, would it really be content with Evan being experimented on when he’s supposed to be slaughtering people? I don’t think so, so I came to the conclusion that those flowers hinder the Entity in some way. I mean, Vigo thought that they could be the key to escaping the Fog didn’t he?
---
Really? That just doesn’t sound right
---
Carry them away from the open gate as the EGC timer hits its last ticks and watch them attempt to sprint back
---
No I've had those screenshots for a while, I just recently got an excuse to use them because I got the game rather recently.
---
Tunnels person with key.
---
Someone else grabs it.
---
Tunnels them too.
---
Get 3 dead and the exit gates are close together.
---
Last guy finds the key and escapes.

Not for console plebs like myself b

The patch is only 351.5 MB for me.

I’m on Xbox
---
If they just made it so you have to kneel down and succeed a skill check, it would feel a lot more fair. No more opening it mid chase. If they miss the skill check, they could fumble and drop it like a horror movie.
---
I love Badham, knowing where the hatch is going to spawn consistently makes the game a lot more tense and fun.
---
I'd like to clarify that it's not because I see escaping as a win, that I'm sweaty about it. As my flair suggests, I don't really take the meta perks, when I do, it's for a specific reason. And it's not because I lose (die) that I get upset about it.
---
I’d go with clown. Though plague has some mean perks pop goes the weasel and bamboozle are top tier and universally useful to all killers whereas plagues are just good
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
---
You're an idiot
---
Ok good to know!
---
What leaks so far?
---
And it was more expensive because it included two survivors, a killer and a map. Thats the reasoning behind it being more expensive, that doesn't mean you should be given Steves, Nancys and the Demogorgon cosmetics for free.
---
Hi to Chris
---
I won't forget the one time I actually succeded in crawling away, bathed in the stain and seeing the animation start.
---
My "perk" would just be  :👀🔪
---
No worries, glad you liked it! They’re Bear skulls, I wanted a predatory symbol that was also very Russian.
---
If uninhibited it can sometimes buy you time however if you’re injured without iron will it can end up killing you. Killers do have ears
---
I’ve reached out a couple times, a couple different ways - no response :(
---
I dont use M&amp;A, the dead rabbit add on works really well for me and frees that slot up for something better.
---
Happy cake day
---
This is a tier list, the entire point of this format is to discuss viability.
---
What's no fun? Losing is no fun so everytime you lose disconnect. That's trasg
---
The "meta" loadout (save yourself at all costs) is widely considered to be Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard - although if you're going to Haddonfield then you can swap out Dead Hard for Balanced Landing (which will stop *almost* all killers from pressuring you).
---
I would argue that Borrowed Time is on borrowed time, pun intended, because Oblivious completely negates it. Unbreakable may be a stronger choice - killer either picks you up and eats Decisive Strike, or slugs you and you pop Unbreakable at an opportune moment.
---
Object of Obsession builds come in two main flavours - one that uses the meta perks as above, and the other that uses all the perks that allow you to vanish mid-chase. The latter is very strong if you can hold the killer's attention, although you're utterly reliant on your team doing their job and getting the gens done with all that time you've bought them.
---
Speaking of reliance, I generally would not encourage a build devoted to "just" healing, or "just" gens, or "just" safe unhooks - if you're not SWF then you're taking a hell of a risk. It's not that they can't work, or that they don't work - it's more the case that it's difficult to get their full benefit without the entire team taking it into account.
---
The more niche the build, the greater the risk of failure.
---
Agreed. I actually guessed right here because I didn't see the hatch anywhere, so I was fortunate.
---
Your best option is just play the game. Skill checks come up for quite a few interactions in game so just keep plugging at it. If you're willing to spend the money, get the Spark of Madness DLC and level up Feng Min. Technician is a GREAT learning perk to make sure your missed skill checks aren't as punishing.
---
Also, I'd recommend against practicing on websites. Reasons being; they don't have an option for controllers (at least, none that I know of do and your on ps4 so you need that), it doesn't help with keeping your awareness up while doing a generator, the skill checks come up in a consistent pattern which doesn't happen in the game and because they don't simulate the latency you will almost always experience in an actual game. That said, if you find it helps, go for it but I would recommend against it.
---
Where is it I only see Haunted Ground
---
You actually need to have a line of sight to reveal him
---
I’m dead lol
---
Well agreed, the devs need to really go back and correct that main issue and I also want a stalk meter added for survivors so I can see it. We get a meter for anything else!
---
How can the survivor possibly know if you missed bc "auto aim" or didnt hold m1 to make a successful grab?
---
She's objectively the best Killer in the game, since teleporting through objects gives her the ability to ignore any defense a Survivor has. But don't learn Nurse first, since you won't learn the basics of Killers by just playing her.
---
That would literally kill him as a viable killer at all, and he sucks enough already
---
I can’t even appreciate these spirit memes because I hate her so much
---
Lmfao
---
My mandatory perk is Pharmacy because it's simply the best perk in the entire game.
---
I'm not even a killer main LOL. I'm probably like 60/40 survivor to killer.
---
Pretty much like 80% of mechanics (if not more) are dedicated and give advantage to the killer but keep whinin
---
Those were quite strong and cheesy too.  For me though the highlight was Packanack Lodge.  The very first thing I'd do is rush to the house and juke it out.  Open every single window, Lock every single door EXCEPT the front one and search every drawer for knives, sprays etc....the best was when you'd get a Jason that wouldn't break the windows or would only break them sporadically.  You could spend the entire game looping that same house.
---
It activates when the doors are _powered_
---
Think of ghost face as a more precise Myers. His ability to crouch and activate stealth on command makes his power more versatile, but also weaker, as he exposes individual survivors instead of everyone, where as Myers wants to stalk to gain an assortment of buffs, as well as expose everyone. Ghost Face is a surgical scalpel, using his power to carefully pick his targets, whereas Myers is a freight train, trying to plow through your whole team at once
---
&gt; I just think it's amusing how close you can clone a game without being sued.
---
The devs from paladins already uploaded early builds and shit dated from before overwatch launch. A lot of the overlap was purely coincidental. 
---
Some of the overwatch heroes (Bridgette) were also very close to existing Paladins heroes.
---
A lot of the stuff that was supposedly "Copied" from overwatch existed in tribes ascend so yeah....
---
&gt;  paladins was definitely made with OW in mind.
---
Pretty sure paladins was playable before they even announced OW?
---
I'm a killer main. I like it for lore reasons and for functionality, but the downside i see is it would end up exactly like DS where everybody starts running it and they'd have to change it again. Maybe adding some kind of condition to its activation would balance it? Like maybe it would only work after your second hook? That'd REALLY fit the description lol
---
Amanda actually only had 60 seconds to do her test. The only reason it took longer was because it was intercut with her returning to the present, and because Saw has some wild editing.
---
Yeah! Honestly I'm playing much more on Switch than PC!
---
Real talk tho how did he do that
---
I can see that you are a Killer main that watches Netflix while you get a match!
---
Yes, but it’s the only trap associated with her they could use besides the shotgun collar.
---
Scoops and shirtless David are also just easier to find than other survivors because the colors make them stand out.
---
U speek da troo-troo!
---
I don’t agree with that, you can’t see how close Myers is to activating his power, you shouldn’t be able to see how close GF is either, it defeats the point of stalking if the game tells you you’re being stalked
---
I just wanna play SWF with my mates and fuck around the whole time lol. From experience, most SWF dont even take the game hella seriously and just play. Sure they may have been toxic but like it be like that. Its a part of the game and if it pusses you off dont play. Play to have fun man.
---
Idk when paladins came out but overwatch was announced in 2014 at blizzcon and was playable there but only 14 characters were available
---
Literally everyone in this thread is saying your reaction time got you killed. Deal with it you got outplayed.
---
Seriously. I picked him up recently and this change would just make him suck ass. He's literally a M1 killer even when he has it. He's fine as is. Just next time head to a stronger loop or accept your fate.
---
Just brush it off friend. Just have to look at it as you should lose that game. All of the advantages are in their favor at that point. Get as many bloodpoints as possible, accept the L, and on to the next. Don't let their trash talk get to you either. There's a reason they have to play as a group to win.
---
*Laughs in No Mither*
---
Killer: Barbecue &amp; Chilli
---
Survivor: Adrenaline
---
Survivor actually, lol. Netflix is just background noise really.
---
That scenario makes zero sense.
---
Its not toxic to try and win with your friends. It happens man, sometimes as killer you get stomped on just the way things go
---
I can feel the frustration as I was in this position before but I’ve come around to it. It’s part of the game. And once your learn to deal with swf you can use the altruism to your benefit!
---
God, do you people ever shut up?
---
*hearing the heartbeat the p3 claudette fades into the nearby hedge* little does she know bbq revealed her hiding spot 😈 let the games begin!
---
Why not organise it in the relevant weekly thread? Perhaps the Discord? If it gains traction then it'll almost organise itself, you need only plant the seed.
---
We may be experiencing a semantic difference over "optimal". For me, an optimal SWF is getting no less that 3 survivors out of the gate (i.e. &gt;75% escape rate). A 50% escape rate is *standard* - to the best of our knowledge the 50% figure is their balance goal. For &gt;75% to get reduced to &lt;50% suggests a *significant* amount of anti-optimal play.
---
**At any rate**, I feel we both agree that we'd like to see more detailed results for Party Size against Survivor Rank, especially now that there's no longer situations where a 1+1+1+20 SWF can artificially inflate the numbers by being matched with outclassed R20 killers.
---
I personally don't agree with the term "telling you" - I feel I'm *inviting you* to prove your hypothesis by generating the data via your proposed test. To me, "telling you" suggests that I don't believe your hypothesis - and that's not the case here. I am open to your hypothesis, I simply feel it'd carry more weight if you had hard data to counter the published stats.
---
As you say, impasse. Still, it was a good conversation and I look forward to more in the future. If I come across anything that matches the proposed test, I'll be sure to tag you - I invite to return the favour if you find something yourself!
---
The grabs were insanely easy to 360.  I learned how to do mine from this one buddy I met on there and they worked everytime because the way we approached them wasn't to 360 his grab or hit attempt as a reaction but instead to do it preemptively to bait out the missed swing or grab attempt and you could complete the motion with a swing of your wrench and those things pretty much always got stuns especially with the perks I ran.  I also had a juke strat for the shifts which was his only real threat that worked 99% of the time.  Combine these with walking almost everywhere midchase you only need to run sporadically to increase distance and it was gg.  Also I always juke out all cabins with barricaded doors and all open windows so we'd all have safe options to use against him.
---
I did the same thing for spirit and now I'm scared that this outfit could potentially be so much better than the school girl one.
---
I don’t hate any perk as much as I hate playing against someone with Object of Obsession
---
Most of the SWF I run into are like what you describe. Just friends having fun together and those don't bother me. Still typically do pretty well by taking advantage of their altruism. However, when you end up against what I refer to as a "toxic hit squad" it can be really tilting if you let it get to you.
---
very meme.
---
i like it.
---
FYI, for a real concept, new perks wont negate old ones.
---
Hunger would negate Pharmacy. thats a big no no
---
Go to the actual Updates tab in the Games &amp; Apps, it's there.
---
I noticed her/his reaction time was a bit slow when the DC came after the grab and not while on the floor.
---
It's definitely not for everyone. It's probably the grindiest, most aggravating game I've ever played... There's a lot of toxicity and it can be pretty rough for new players. When it's good, it's great, but when it's bad, it's absolutely fucking awful. And most of that comes to random chance of who you get matched with for any given game.
---
Watch streamers and see if it looks like fun for you... But keep in mind you're basically watching professional athletes, and just because you love watching Kobe pull off amazing stunts doesn't necessarily mean you'll enjoy getting trounced on the courts over and over.
---
It’s a meme
---
If you watch this clip and think it's just lag I got a bridge in London available for sale.  1 owner only been walked on to get to church and back on sundays by an elderly woman.
---
[Link to official forums](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests).
---
They're a little dated, and would benefit from being refreshed now that we've had a number of changes that would affect balance (off the top of my head, we have a new killer, new perks, new map, and new status effects).
---
This sounds less like a toxic friend group and more like you just got stomped and couldn't handle it, take a break, move on, we've all had our breaking point with this games community at one point or another
---
This is really cool, but Gripping Tentacles is too strong. It needs a longer cooldown and a shorter duration.
---
All of them look great. Awesome work from BHVR.
---
red forest, mainly mothers dwelling
---
Hey man, I'm not fighting a t3 Michael that unhook. Your ass is on its own.
---
Yeah true, I see no reason not to camp the hooks because survivors go as far as just sitting on gens because they have ds to win the game and as a killer there is absolutely no wrong in just camping the hooks to win the game. But both are not fun at all and it ruins both sides.
---
For sure. Having a tense fear inducing moment in a horror inspired video game would be stupid. Who ever heard of such silliness?
---
It should maybe be like a free escape cake? Give 100% extra bloodpoints for the survivor who escapes with it.
---
I love survivor sided maps as killer and killer sided maps as survivor. Feels like an added challenge and i love that. Plus, Lery’s is great for me personally cause i use a lot of really weird perks that take specific situations to be good, which i always seem to have on Lery’s.
---
He ran rancor and noed?
---
Oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man!
---
What did he say
---
Can I help what my lag is?  I mean, if you guys join my lobby and you have terrible ping to me, why did you decide to stay in the lobby?  Is it my responsibility as a killer to duck survivors with bad ping just to make sure those survivors don’t make the poor decision to stay in my game and get pissed when they lag out?
---
*They got Kakyoin! They got his eyes!*
---
Yeah theres not really any good you can do against her which is why shes so strong. It's really rough
---
Nurse n spirt
---
I'm at rank18 and this achiev is still rough to get. Any build suggestions? Thinking of going full pallet mode
---
I'd want to be able to use it twice, if a killer tunnels you off the first hook they'll likely do it off the second hook as well
---
I think it'd be smarter from a business standpoint to use traps that aren't associated with her since she already has the RBT. It'd good fan service for those that enjoyed the movies after the first 3 and likely convince more Saw fans to buy the DLC. Otherwise they'd just be making updates for people who already have the DLC.
---
Camp if you want but its not gonna win you the game normally if you ask me. Camp the hook and lose 2-3 gens if the team are smart
---
Personally I’m only a fan of using the nurse. I think the loading que should be set as killer specific, then the more obscure killers will get used more due to less wait time in lobby. As a survivor I’ve only seen the nurse twice so it’s odd to think I have to wait 20 minutes to find a match.
---
I wasn’t trying to convince a change. Just thinking out loud... on the internet... 
---
I see my folly now.
---
From the leaks,  its going to be a fix corrupted gens (survivor) or use corrupted hooks (killer) enough to fill up a meter.  Each full meter gives you 1 coin.  10 coins for one outfit piece. An offering increases the numer of corrupt gens/hooks in a match.  (All subject to rumor/speculation)
---
I expect there will be more outfits then you can earn,  and AC can be used to buy any outfit during or after the event.
---
And with regards to not checking lockers. You could take a wider route away from locker or just bait them out i guess.
---
wtf ?
---
IS IT FOR REAL!?  
---
Btw all 2018-19 killers beside Legion xD
---
You can’t know, the same way I can’t know if I only got a hit because of lag.  Which is why I ended my post by saying that neither side should feel pressure to play differently due to game glitches.
---
#**ORA**
---
I get that I dropped it early, but the teleporting through is so silly.
---
Killer mains don't understand what it's like having the need to actually put someone else before themselves and most don't understand why we don't GTFO with another person on the hook. It's a crowning principle of your standard sociopath.
---
it makes it all worth it though when you get 2-4 kills and the survivors say you did good.
---
Banning people for not following sub rules is co.parable to a nazi? I don't think you'd make a good mod.
---
What part do you not understand
---
Clutch af congrats.
---
There you ago, another logically fallacy ad hominem.
---
I encourage you to keep up the sophistry.
---
&gt; now i'm not afraid to do the [lord's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnOt74e9_Q)
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; you say vengeance is his, but imma do it first
---
I’m not trying to tell anyone how to play the game, if you want to be nice to survivors, you do you.  I just don’t like it when people act like all killers should automatically be apologetic and play “fair” when survivors take a lag hit or some other glitch works against survivors when no one ever tells survivors to let kills get hits and downs when the game glitches against the killer.
---
It does depend on your rank, lower ranks normally play killers that are fairly easy to play,n then mid rank start to move towards higher tier killers and away from the way ones, then the higher ranks use to tier killers. So as you rank up it will change more.
---
That said you wont often see a doctor because people just dc against him way too often.
---
From what I've seen (which is little, just the video Panda did), it looks pretty bad. I will say, though that this:
---
&gt; skill checks seem off, like delayed responses
---
Is true of all platforms. Someone here once posted a super slowed down video of a skill check with great ping and frame rate and all that jazz on PC and it was utter garbage.
---
True.. Good luck is needed with this achievement, indeed: my first attempt failed because this Claudette understood what was happening and disconnected; second attempt: match cancelled at the beginning; third attempt, there was this random Meg, an innocent, sweet soul, who messed up some stuff and basically helped me get it. She's been my hero. XD 
---
I will forever remember her with love.
---
Then, in post game chat, a salty Adam basically reported Meg and me, telling we were cooperating! I explained them she was probably too naive and trusted me: she probably thought I was friendly ( I've been *evil incarnate* for real, in that moment.. I felt so mean!). I kept thanking them in chat and saying I was sorry for their match, wishing them a good day! XD also, Poor Meg!
---
I just said ds you idiot. Either you stand over them for 60 seconds sacrificing gens or pick them up and get looped for 3 more gens when they stun you. Think
---
The survivor is Jake.
---
Shotgun trap should be the one if you're using Amanda's letter
---
*speedwagon screaming*
---
Oh damn i almost had that animation (read abomination) erased out of my memory. But yeah just like animation 3rd game have few murders which make no sense at all and the the ending is like the creator spitting back at fanbase for pushing him too much for a 3rd game when he wasn't ready for it.
---
 Just like DBD, toxicity is not the answer to Toxicity. Especially from Devs.
---
Leais say October 9th/10th
---
Borrowed Time applies to the person you save, and only applies if you're in the killer's Terror Radius.
---
It's getting to the stage where the more popular killers are also the ones most capable of negating Borrowed Time, so of the ones you've listed I would personally suggest you go with Decisive Strike and Adrenaline. 
---
Iron Will "helps" you lose the killer, at least in the sense that many of them hunt using their *ears*. Bear in mind that Iron Will won't help against the first hit, but the reduced grunting can help you dodge the second. Urban Evasion et al. can potentially be employed at any opportune moment in the chase, and could therefore be considered "more valuable".
---
The hallowed blight offering(pustula petals) are basically saying like it's any other event, hook survivors on special hooks and do the special generators.
---
Iggy’s death was so fucked up in the OVA
---
Kind of expected to see the old Blight skins go on sale last year once they made it clear they were no longer a limited time thing. Glad I held off on impulsive purchasing the rest of the ones I wanted after I earned my freebies. 
---
Keeping my fingers crossed they've learned from their past mistakes and this year's implementation of Hallowed Blight doesn't lead to a shit show of "Suck cankers dry, then go suicide to get into another game"
---
Same, at least the first 2 seasons had a somewhat interesting story even if [most of] the characters were a little yikes compared to the more bearable ones of the movies. Season 3 was just "why do I have to sit through these people...?" I wanted Ghost boi to kill 'em all in the first episode.
---
Theres a timer? It activates when youre on the floor?
---
Honestly, if you played through that whole match and didn’t learn to stay away from the lockers, that’s on you. The more time they spend sitting in a locker getting no utility out of their perk, the less time they spend repairing gens
---
So? Does it rly matter? The killer ingame has nothing to do with the killers of Scream. (only the mask)
---
I don’t like this, After the game starts the 5/10 second countdown you show be locked in the game.
---
Ohh thats mostly grinding but for huntress one use Iri heads and farm rescuers off hooks.
---
Possible changes to hallucinations: give them a red stain and mini terror radius, like the Hag does with the scarred hand add-on...or at least I think that's the add-on where her mud phantasms have a 16m terror radius.
---
Totels
---
*IGGY WATCH OUT HE’S STILL ALIVE!!!!*
---
I used Whispers to find them easier, especially if in fully immersed mode, Ruin to slow down the game a little bit, Haunted Ground as a bait and also to waste their time, and Play With Your Food to try to get more speed because yes.. I felt my Myers was a true snail! XD
---
You mean 4 killers at once? Tahndk but I think Legion gets enough hate already
---
I don’t see how it’s scummy. They have multiple ways to buy characters and you just happened to choose an inefficient way.
---
Seconded. Game is balanced around survivors and you have to play pitch perfect as a killer or else you get insulted for camping/tunneling just because you're trying to win against 4 people lmao. There's a reason why there's only a few viable killers
---
God that would be sad but nothing really surprises me at this point lol
---
I hate it because baby survivors are gonna dodge when I burn a shroud of separation or ivory mori.
---
The term you are looking for is i-frames. Which would work in theory, but with the desync and hitboxes.. probs not.  
---
"Is it hard" no, but its BHVR, its not likely to be a thing anytime soon.
---
You get an offering called putrid petals or something like that. Basically you do some secondary objectives and it gives you a vial. These vials can earn you a free event cosmetic
---
Just give Myers a Silver Shamrock mask.
---
We dont know if its the actual event or just the skins yet.
---
You gotta know when to break a chase, you can’t just let them repeatedly bait you into locker city because you don’t want to lose a chase. Playing the worst killer in the game probably didn’t help, but knowing when to break chase and get back to pressuring gens is an important skill
---
I'm a little disappointed with the lack of changes towards the matchmaking. Right now playing SWF (even in a duo) in red ranks is miserable because it takes at least 5 minutes to find a lobby. There's too many red ranked survivors and SWF groups needing a red rank killer to have even decent queues as survivor. It makes wanting to get on the game to play difficult, even as someone who regularly plays daily. 
---
I'd love nothing more than a revert for matchmaking for SWF groups finding games based on their party's rank average. It seriously slows down the amount of games you can play in a session because groups with only one red rank also need a red killer when they wouldn't have needed one previously.
---
Doesnt show you if the killer can catch you before you make it you 4head. r/woooosh
---
I keep bouncing between wanting to Prestige Michael Myers or Leatherface for my first Prestige character xD.  Been playing forever but I hate essentially throwing Bloodpoints to the wind till I get my Perks back xD.  I WAS gonna prestige Ghost Face on his release, but ended up getting too many good Perks and jus getting all of em,on him now.
---
The Licensed Killers (except Pig &amp; Ghost Face) dont have cosmetics, so was always gonna pick one of em to do so!  Maybe Freddy....dunno xD is a pretty big time investment
---
I can't see it. Can you post it to imjur or something? I can't see it on mobile for some reason.
---
That was some incredible luck can I borrow some?
---
I don’t understand your responses are you trolling or
---
its bad how much I cringed at you
---
Usually something event themed.
---
It’s usually as basic as “work on these festive generators” or “hook survivors on special hooks” and sometimes “harvest from in-game plants for shop materials”.
---
The usually are just costumes and such.
---
So what if it's the Ultimate tombstone + tuft of hair build. You'll live.
---
Can someone explain? I started playing this week...
---
As they should. Don't bring moris for an easy match if you don't want survivors to quit.
---
I agree
---
Ivory moris are fine though?
---
I’m a new player and just played against the doctor for the first time. Glad to know that the decoys don’t come anything!
---
Sprit: 10/10
---
Hag: 7/10
---
Clown: 9/10 
---
Plague: 5/10

***JUST HOOK IT TO MY VEINS!***
---
I’m not, I’d rather have this one then the Scoops Ahoy outfit. This is my favorite one and clearly a lot of people think the same.
---
Honestly though, I hate playing against the Wraith.
---
Killers main's opinions are super important: They don't want to feel bullied, that shouldn't happen. I'd argue that due to the various drawbacks/conditions (Must be healthy, sprinting, close range, not exhausted, one time use, tbh it's still inferior to flashlight saves, permanently breaks user and exhausts them for normal duration) it's won't feel like the Survivors control the game, as they are majorly setback by such a reckless perk, especially if it's used early in a trial.  
---
Tell me this though, slightly different idea: What if they could use it whether they were injured or healthy, but using it damaged them one health state regardless? Theoretically, this would allow Killers to swat them as they come in for a save, stopping injured saves and getting a down and instantly downing healthy survivors who dive, even if they lose whoever they were carrying. Is that better?
---
have we seen new pustula petals?
---
You think something like the decoy ability from halo reach or like a decoy that attacks you from depth?
---

---
I'm not even mad that there's a watermark.
---
But "Created with Video Editor" is actually the most useless watermark I've ever seen lmfao
---
I know this is a little late but can you still down survivors and destroy pallets with the chainsaw?
---
As a survivor main- Amen.
---
U mean totoms?
---
Is anyone else bothered that the nurse got skipped again?
---
How is being the best killer you can be and using a mori day-ruining? Sounds like DbD may not be their game if killers are patting their asses instead of doing killer things.
---
Borrowed time motha fucka🖕🏼👋🏻
---
It is. However because of the way ranks work you could say the killers goal is to chase and hook, more so than focusing down one survivor.
---
Here, take my upvote to help counter balance the wave of down votes you’re about to eat
---
1!??!?!? Sydney fucking killed every single pyscho who came at her you Goober and I just fucking love how you just pulled up a list LIKE IT FUCKING DIS PROVES MY ARGUMENT I said one fo the NOT THE MOST BADASS for fucks sake you even attempted to say Dewey was more badass the mother fucker got his ass kicked every movie

Great idea. Dont kow how?

It's the same as last time, I got 30 of them and they have that description

Jake looks like a snack

Attacking you instead, mothafucka!

He wants to mori steve but his team knows and won't unhook him.

Y?

“I’m Chris” Wait a minute.... lmao

Its not a decoy, it's a snitch for your positioning

You could do a few slides of the image each with the arms getting longer, make a video with the slides, and then convert the video to a GIF.

Posted in r/LeaksByDaylight
---
Some inspirations from the Feaster in Identity V maybe?
---
You are retarded. I get 4 kills by tunneling easily. Ds is not much an issue. I am rank 6 right now. Take your insults up your arsehole. Plus when unhooked noob survivors like you run towards me and i down them they message me tunneler noob. I enjoy their salt.
---
Survivors should be 99 the gate, I hate when they just open it lol
---
Thanks for lack of anger I was at work so quickly downloaded a free editor. 
---
And I have to agree it is a bad watermark.
---
Thanks 😄 I think I’ll have to rewatch some of these as I havnt seen most of them in over 15-20+ years 😂
---
There should be no “inefficient way” what lol
---
Damn straight
---
Oh, I did those so many times during the BP hunt. Both of them.
---
What happend to the weekly dev stream? We went from weekly to once a quarter
---
Level up your blood web and you will find new perks as well as level up your existing perks remember in the bloodweb you always go for the perk
---
Apples and Oranges
---
I've already prepared for that- I've read that you can only unlock two of them for free with the event, right?
---
Couldn´t care less. As I said, I usually go for the attacker anyway, so Borrowed Time does nothing for me. 
---
And again, if you manage to unhook while I am there, kudos, no problem with that. I invite you to try, and if you manage to outplay me, fine. But don´t expect me to run halfway around the map away from my kill, I will obviously defend it when the gates are open.
---
How long do these events usually run for? This will be my first one!
---
Survivors don't get much points for doing gens ASAP either.
---
Will the leveled up version of said perks appear in the bloodweb?
---
Oh yes, the good ol' stand still move, takes years of practice, and not many people can pull that off, even with years of training. Spirit has such a high skill ceiling its insane Kappa
---
What about Legion 
---
They skipped them and went straight to Plauge
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not saying the Legion rework was good or well thought out. Just that the current state is at least preferable to how they used to be.
---
Deviousness
---
The only correct response.
---
Go ahead, camp the one you caught while the other 3 laugh at what a fuckup you are. 4k or failure.
---
This is a very fair statement.  If killers camp with gens up they the dick.  If killers camp with an open exit gate and you complain postgame about it you the dick and an entitled one at that.
---
So 10min in aftereffects. Trying doing some storyboarding to add more scenes
---
The fact that moris haven't been removed after all this time tells a different story. Coming across a killer with an ebony is like 1 in 20 games at worst. Just suck that one game up and play instead of dc'ing pre-game
---
Usain Bubba
---
I like totels.
---
...or at least make it happen for the corrupt purge (damaging One). Seeing her vomit up a burning hot orange stream of goo makes her a dragon lady.
---
That jake skin got my chair sticky
---
Thats because he himself hides like a pussified BITCH
---
You're a bitch then
---
You’re dense huh? I meant an ability that has something to do with multiple killers, like a decoy or something
---
Should’ve clarified
---
There is something called critical acclaim - there are even fallout 76 fanboys out there, doesnt mean the game is good by all means
---
Ez game, have the other three be at full health, have the other two take a hit and bodyblock while you unhook, the unhooker has bt and is also healthy, ez game
---
Press the open original button and it should open!
---
Entity jizz
---
Z?
---
Doesn't mean anything to me
---
If I don't have a reason to leave I won't simple as.
---
No making it fair for the person on hook is not a reason
---
Which is better so survivors dont let people die on hook for serum or let themselves die cause theirs is full
---
People think they can hide the deep sadness of their lives with an internet tough guy facade.
---
I'd take that too!
---
I played like 7 games yesterday at rank 4-9 and we had one killer use a mori
---
Holy shit, you fucking killed him dude.
---
That's why you are not a proffesional game critic
---
Also one Apple is not a complete ripoff of another Orange, and the Orange Has a good critical acclaim by both critics and players alike
---
I NEEEEED demon horned oni spirit so BADLY!

When I am running borrowed time, is there any indicator on my screen that it triggered if the person I unhook never gets hit?

And that was prolly just for a daily anyway. I feel like the higher rank you go the less moris you run into.
---
This could’ve been my shitty ass trying to play killer. You don’t remember the killer’s username, do you?
---
Can I get the OG image to make memes with it
---
kiss my butt!
---
I usually play videogames for my own fun and entertainment, DBD is no different.
---
Wow, those skins are very cash money. Who’s the survivor?
---
imagine if she could throw it up
---
How about a key? Ends the game quicker Isn’t that bs then too?
---
I'm gonna have to stop you right there
---
Only one survivor skin...?
---
Would also like to know, he looks dope.
---
You had to reach deep inside "I got nothing else to say" vault there rofl
---
#owo
---
Wasn't The Actor a fake that was supposed to be Ghostface? It was "leaked" with a Sidney Prescott daily also, I think.
---
Looks like Jake

The one with the tall house and the single hook inside. Because if you sabo the hook you can do the gen up there with no issues and if you do get downed by the treasure box you can waste most killers time as they try to drag you downstairs at least twice before leaving you slugged by the box :P
---
Rank 4 and you get angry over a meme exhaustion perk? Thats a yikes
---
I NEED THIS!! where did u get it from?
---
Those people suck.
---
You don’t want memes. Everyone else loves them.
---
They would probably mess it up if they tried to implement that. I mean the game has been out 3 years and it still has a bunch of bugs in it.
---
Cool. Enjoy your 1k and the knowledge that you failed to do your job as a killer rofl. That's why I think killers BP should start high and they should lose with every kill they fail to secure.
---
It's sad.
---
It’s jake
---
It’s nice to come back to this and see how hard you predicted not only the survivor, a perk name and a cosmetic nearly two months in advance.
---
 Lack is killer, always on the far right. Otherwise I don’t think there’s a diff.
---
They have no place here.
---
Oh wow, I didn't know that as I don't enjoy playing survivor. So they need rescues, but what else is there for a survivor to do besides unhook and repair? I guess looping and sabotage.
---
It’s not “on me” anymore than a lightning strike knocking out my power and DCing me from the game is “on me.”  I didn’t design and lay the fiber optic cable that connects my computer to yours, it’s not my fault if the connection fluctuates.
---
And I know lag is frustrating, it affects killers as well as survivors.  You think it’s fun to play huntress when the hatchet leaves your hand 2 seconds after you throw it?  You think it’s fun to land chainsaws on survivors that are passively phasing like the Spirit?  
---
But I don’t tell survivors to adjust their play style to accommodate that issue, and no one has the right to expect me to play any different to accommodate them.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
If the amount of hate mail I receive whenever I boot up this game is any indication, there are a lot more entitled assholes out there than there should be
---
This looks amazing! I hope it isn't just the one survivor skin though.
---
I has no idea either! They annoyed me when I was working on a gen or opening a box
---
Cool story, cry me a river I can bathe in. You're one of those sad incel losers that derive their self-worth from how well you can bully someone in a game and you believe every pile of randos that shits on you even though you're stacked against them is an SWF.
---
At first like 30
---
Not with hard to achieve conditions.
---
It's better because you can't kill the killer.
---
Here's hoping my clairvoyance will bring us the second cosmetic soon too
---
no, just no. This isn't FF13, this is DBD.
---
I disagree. Plus say if you got the ability from having the exit gates open, the killer is faster than you, so he can run away.
---
Did you know that the shitpost flair existed?
---
I don't have interest in these skins since I never play any of these killers but my god what an amazing job done by the artwork team.
---
Here is a comparison from last year's hallowed blight: [Hallowed Blight Banners](https://i.imgur.com/rDxgHdp.jpg)
---
I just came to this conclusion last night.
---
I am a killer and I'm not super great.  Some players decide to mock me by teabagging excessively or they get right by me and spin in circles... so you bet your ass when I landed a second hit on one jerk, I camped right at the hook.
---
He absolutely lost it  post game but it felt so good.
---
Of course it is, but if you want to kill the killer play friday.  BHVR won't  implement a new objective like that three years into the game.
---
How about No, no one wants no matter the condition. Just look at Dstrike, before dstrike the game had less toxicity and division between killer and survivor, but i bet you're a 30hrs player who has no idea what i mean
---
Eventually there will be. But it requires them fully implementing Dedicated Servers so they can more accurately track such things.
---
Right now it requires an obscene amount of d/c's for BHVR to even raise an eyebrow at a player. But supposedly in the future you'll get escalating time-outs every time you do it.
---
Thanks for spoilers.
---
Lol right
---
Never
---
Also for the love of god if you are being unhooked hold the crouch button so you don’t set off the traps that she inevitably put all around you. I dread every time O go unhook someone because most of the time they set off the traps anyway. ;_;
---
I lose enough pips from the random disconnects already. Most of the time when the killer disconnects I still downrank.
---
Just because there's a killer in Friday doesn't mean it's the same as dbd.
---
You ever heard of exploits? Maybe cheating? They're both very easy things to do when you know how. Just go play Friday the 13th if you want to kill them. Dbd is for survivors to escape, not fight.

Is this a crossover episode?

When did they put commando pro in this game?
---
Here you go! Not sponsored by them lol
---
Now show us you when you get stabbed by Decisive by that survivor.
---
PS4, I just played a game where my syringe straight up didn't work! I recorded it and reviewed it to see that it didn't do what it was supposed to do.
---
You got bamboozled there buddy
---
I thought you couldn't say anything dumber. But then you said this and completely proved me wrong.
---
Amen
---
4 survivors brought in bloody party streamers (which doubles your bloodpoint gains for everyone in game) and the killer brought an ebony Mori (which let's the killer outright murder anyone who has been hooked at least once).
---
Where’s the apple?
---
Speak London? Wtf racist shit is that?
---
Finally some love for Jake.
---
Harry Warden from my Bloody Valentine. Seeing a masked miner running at you ready to shove a pickaxe in your skull would probably Scare you. He could have a decent amount of power and perk ideas since the whole theme around him is Hearts and other Valentine's day stuff.
---
I gotta take his side. That’s like saying call of duty team death match is a MOBA.
---
I just checked the files again, and yes, it seems Jake is the only survivor skin. Unless they're adding the 2nd to the files with the event's release, which is not likely.
---
It's accurately flaired as a discussion. I appreciate you brigading me, though.
---
PS4, the game sometimes starts the match with "Match End Result" still stuck on the screen in the left top corner. And it stays there the whole match until i die or quit.
---
First good Hag skin in my opinion, and that Spirit!!
---
Well, dude you asked how
---
Lol, 😂
---
It completely breaks the "balance" of the game. Its just as bad as Moris
---
Shut up survivors get more skins over all the only killer that has 40 skins is trapper everybody else is below 40
---
While more than 4 survivors have over 40 and meg has 50
---
Survivors get a lot more cosmetics from the weekly collections than killers stop crying.
---
At least 4 times
---
Title should be “this meme everyday”
---
Yeah but did you know that it existed?
---
Just because the games could share a similarity doesn't mean they shouldn't.
---
Is that jake in the middle
---
Weird, I see toxic SWFs flashlight clicking, running Insta-heals, teabagging, most games. Gets old real fast 😂🤷
---
The Michael myers and ghostface p3 is bs. There is so little blood on their masks, and I know it's because the devs don't want them to be "hard to see". It would give prestiging a purpose though.
---
I want respond to that because it's an ad hominem and I don't appreciate sophistry.

BHVR: Lets reschedule the blood hunt to the same weekend where a large portion of our best players are busy at twitchcon!
---
This isn't a new idea though. This is literally a poor copy-paste job of something that's been done in F13. 
---
BHVR is already constantly experimenting with new ideas. New ways to grief the killer should never be one of them.
---
No, my comment was a joke, level 4 perks don’t exist
---
Bing Bong Boi is Best Boi

One time I took my hands off my keyboard to drink some water and I got a standing ovation for my sick mindgame

Updated Version of the Concepts i did some time ago 
---
at this point i doubt they will ever make DBD pops but well.. at least i give you an idea of how they will look
---
Let me know if you will like to see more( i have like half of them done)
---
Yeah yeah, just next time flare your nonesence as #shitpost please
---
So the game shouldn't add new things that could potentially be exploited? Sounds like poor reasoning to me.
---
I use the decoys to let me know where people are, if they move they wont do that as well...
---
Id dc that bullshit.
---
Imagine if the doctor had a useful power lmao
---
Ya no.
---
I would settle for just Scooby-Doo cosmetics and maybe one of their killers/monsters
---
Would love keepers creepers but since the director is well you know.....it’ll never happen.
---
How about you don't use someone's grief to preach your bullshit
---
🤮
---
Nobody here has made a bold claim against your ignorance of the matter, they simply just corrected your mistake. Most people have goofed up like this.
---
it was all about the killer skins last time anyway. They can't go too wild with the survivor skins and people aren't that interested in glowing yellow as a survivor (outside of having Legacy, that is)
---
Oh god do you watch ochido?
---
Upvoted for menacingly
---
Both are bs
---
Doesnt matter how they play if its toxic or not, they all still go on the hook.
---
Holy shit that Jake looks so cool it's making me question my decision to p3 steve and main him
---
baby wraith yet he still hitted you
---
The Plague is the worst killer to pip as.
---
Gatekeeper -most survivors will skip healing and hammer out gens,  this often results in you getting bronze or silver in this category at best.  Ruin, pop goes the weasel and thanatophobia will help, but all killers are at the survivors mercy for this one, and the plague gets very little mercy.
---
Devout/sacrifice - this is the only emblem plague is on par with other killers in. Just hook and kill like normal.
---
Malicious - You need survivors to heal between hooks or you are limited to bronze.  Do NOT vomit healthy survivors to broken or you lose out on points here.  Only apply broken to injured survivors.  You can 'sort of' farm points for this by forcing decisive strike or juggling survivors so they return to an injured state with out being healed so you can hit them again but you need to do it a ridiculous number of times for gold or iridescent. 
---
Chaser - Plague sucks here but you can control this one.  Vomiting a survivor to broken and hitting them down counts as one chase. And the time you spend vomiting means it likely wont count as a good chase.  If you want gold or iridescent here you need a lot of good chases.  Solution -  slug a lot and let survivors pick themself up so you can chase them some more.
---
As you can see, the only emblem the Plague is not hampered by is Devout.  And you have to risk a poor score there if you want to farm Malicious and chaser.
---
If this becomes real then holy Bananas in pajamas its gonna be lit
---
I mean that's true but they could stop that glowy shit and do smth else lol
---
PS4, the game keeps getting a lag spike every time the killer gets Blood Lust. it will often cause a missed swing.
---
How is it dumb?
---
The game is literally about escaping. On the cover it specifically says, "Death is not an escape." Why would they throw that whole concept out? Seems pretty stupid to me and everyone else that has commented here 🤷‍♂️
---
I know many of them are from journals, but many of them are also cited in such a way that being written in a journal isn't necessarily implied. Also, that wording doesn't necessarily mean the characters *can't* talk, it just means they don't in game.
---
It is an objective that gives pip points. If you check under the 'lightbringer' tab of after game, you can see your contribution scores of dping gens and distracting the killer.
---
T1 Meyers playing around you like fucking Jaws
---
I've never been to red or purple ranks, so I can't speak for those; I'm currently at rank 10 and queue time really depends most on the time of day. In the evening from seven to ten PM is when I usually find a lobby very quickly, whereas playing at less popular times it sometimes takes ten minutes to find a one.
---
Can  you tell me what do you think is racist about it?
---
I was never good at it but I loved how it was such a fun way to exploit the mechanics of the Source engine- it wasn't used to gain an advantage or to grief people, it was used to create an entirely new type of game.
---
Bubba didn’t kill his family. You’re thinking of Billy.
---
It’s speculation
---
This is how I always thought the Doctor’s illusions should work.
---
Trying to make a funny joke be like
---
Herbert West would be cool
---
Level 10 decisive strike kills the entity. Upon spawning into the game you receive a very easy skill check. If successful, the entity dies and the game is over. You must re purchase the game and start anew to play again. 
---
"Death is finally an escape"- unknown
---
Shhhhh, you’ll upset the weebs
---
did you read it?
---
I like Satan
---
Because everything in this game is everyone else’s fault, never their own lol.
---
Thank you^^
---
its pretty rare tho
---
Disturbed ward
---
And camped
---
You must not play on console
---
FUCK YEA REANIMATOR!!! How would his mori work?
---
I mean it could theoretically work in some niche perk like if you are the last one left the hatch will spawn a gun instead of allowing you to escape and you can kill the killer with it.
---
However it would have to be so weak it would be almost useless so I'm not sure there is a point.
---
Sorry ?
---
The meme is 'personnel'. It was a misspelling which made the whole thing even funnier.
---
Agree. It’d add some excitement to the game instead of just holding the same button for 2 minutes to escape.
---
Dude don't bother, you already admitted you're some crybaby bitch who gets offended by teabagging, that's like shitting yourself in public, you can't insult anybody while shit is dripping down your leg, nor can you when you openly admit to having the maturity of a fucking child, it's over, you're now a crybaby battiboy till the end of times to me. Your best bet is to start manning the fuck up or at least pretend you're a man in the furute, make a new reddit account and just try again, or stick around with all the pussies but at least know your place.
---
God of War was trash tho.
---
Survs can already cheat to go invun, the killer has no points to play then either but as you can see not many people cheat.
---
the spirit and hag just made me piss myself, WHAT IS THAT? THE SPAWN OF SATAN?!?
---
A fake killer that moves, gib it to doctor.
---
Holo Pilot?
---
Love this
---
Yours isnt bad at all. I use thanatophobia because either they cleanse and give me corrupt, or they have a debuff all game.
---
That is also really good and satisfying, but Myers unfortunately can't teabag them back like those two can.
---
That's a Cute Wraith !! Good Job
---
Oh great,now they're spitting shit at us.
---
I FORGOTTED sorry im really sorry

His cosmetics has to have both the hockey mask and burlap sack

Death is not an escape - even if your a killer.

People in this sub really don't mark spoiler on anything anymore. I just got spoiled the entire hallowed blight event because the leaksbydaylight idiots cant wait for offical reveals.
---
nice
---
I thought it was rumoured around about the time Clown was made from what I remember.
---
Pretty sure they do yeah. You're always 5/10/15% faster
---
It's too late now.
---
Sure the director is a creepy asshole, but the character of Jeepers Creepers is ICONIC
---
But how do you know it's going to make the game better?
---
I actually have no clue. I doubt it though
---
He pins a survivor to the ground and kills them and injects them with a syringe then the survivor wakes up but after a second vomit blood and die again.
---
Lol, no totems no problems. As for the face camping when exit gates are open, have fun taking that L.
---
This meme should just get deleted by the mods every time it's posted.  
---
Like seriously since the boys came out this gets posted at least once a week.
---
Don’t worry about it, for your ears sake
---
I actually prefer killer. I like spirit and Myer's.
---
They should go fucking nuts and scream.
---
I disagree but respect your opinion nonetheless
---
This is some of the best post-knockdown hassling I've seen. The window trick has got me before, do you counter it by facing away from it?
---
Or that lol
---
Im really sorry, i forgotted to mark as spoiler. I dont usually post things related to leaks
---
It doesn't matter if you try to play fair, never camp or tunnel. The moment a Survivor is sacrificed be ready for salt. For example i usually start to chase the closest person to me and they complain about tunneling even though i never intended to tunnel anyone. If an unhooked Survivor runs right into me after being unhooked it's not tunneling, it's just you being bad and trying to justify your fuckup with insults to the killer. Survivor were crybabies back then and it gets worse and worse.
---
Thanks for the info! I figured as much. The skins are really nice regardless and I look forward to the event.
---
did you forget the shit post flair or are you really crying about leatherface?  
---
Like hill billy is a thousand times stronger than him Lolololol
---
On the right looks like a mutated Meg. I can’t unsee it now.
---
REANIMATOR was a fantastic joy ride. All I need is House of REANIMATOR and I’m good
---
LMAO I'm loving the clown one
---
I didn’t “go” with that internet company.  There’s only one internet provider in my area, so my options are that company or I’m playing DbD with shadow puppets on the wall.
---
Regardless, we’re way off the original point here, which is that neither side should expect the other to play differently due to structural issues outside of their control.  Whether you want to call latency a bug, a glitch, or whatever, it’s not within my ability to control, so survivors have no right to expect me as the killer to play differently just because lag may affect gameplay.
---
I respect the apology. Its mainly the people who post these things and leave it up without being marked as spoiler. You had the decency to correct your mistake and that is very respectful of you.
---
We need an illusionist killer that puts out clones!
---
The ONLY way to play Bubba
---
Have you ever tried Play with your food on Bubba?
---
Arguable.
---
And maybe an alternate weapon being the woodsman axe since he uses that almost as often as the machete in most films. TBH he doesn't normally use the machete too often outside of the reboot he kinda just uses whatever is around. Jason is all about reusing and recycling while reducing the number of counselors. Voorhees is green as fuck
---
Its up to them to not go on places like the reddit for the game or the forums then.
---
Repost
---
Wow. Absolutely pranked
---
Yes, brigades would say that.
---
Hes trying his best mkay
---
That escalated quickly
---
Maybe there should be more than one weapon? He could go to the Lockers and there would be a selection of three weapons that play differently and possibly break.
---
Yeah. At least the 1 survivor skin is lit though.
---
I think it'd be fun to be chased as a killer.
---
Stop spamming
---
I was about to say, yeah. Imagine if Doc didn't suck
---
And if it’s like last year you can get 2 skins for free or mix and match
---
*its also Otzdarva* OH FUCKING GOD RUN
---
What I mean is just misflaring posts is so god damn minor posts are removed until the flair is changed/we just PM them to change it. Most people just look at hot, and like I said, unless people use that report button it wont get changed. Its such a minor thing vs people saying racist shit that DOES get them banned
---
Yes these are awesome but I can never justify spending $15 on a cosmetic skin
---
It ruins the sub.
---
i really dislike the “4k or bust” mentality killers/survivors have. Seeing a killer constantly slug the 3rd person when theres only one other survivor left and they have no tracking perks like Whispers/Infectious Fright to even attempt to find the last survivor is so obnoxious. 
---
I think its totally fine for a killer to defend the hook end game. You cant expect a 4k every match.
---
Actually I was thinking about that kind of perk for the Killer haha!
---
haven't u heard about Kage Bunshin?
---
Its nice to get a scare like that. The more you play the less scary it gets and becomes a game with horror icons in it. Thankfully im still in the in between phase of the two. I very much enjoy the game though even with the issues and whatnot, a horror genre lovers wet dream, but issues.
---
Seriously. And Hag OP? Bahahaha
---
I need a deadite killer in my life. Or the rift demon from season 3 that fused those two guys together and then used another guys spine/skull as a weapon.  (Ash vs Evil Dead).
---
Chucky/Tiffany could work as a team to hook survivors. It would take a little bit more on the animation side of things. But picture Chucky choking a survivor with a yoyo, riding them until they're impaled on the hook, and then tiffany cranks it up to hang them. 
---
You could also have a spectral sailor from The Fog, that could bellow fog from his person and reduce map visibility significantly.
---
So we heard your suggestion, and in response we're putting out another Pig nerf.
---
ugh spitter is so hot
---
Honestly I like this
---
They already spawn facing towards a survivor. They would still point the same way but they'd run along that vector instead of just looking
---
It does, but in the case of Billy you're unlikely to notice it since it's already pretty damn fast. PWYF is a flat speed increase, it doesn't have any special conditions or anything. So it's speed boost stacks with any other speed boost.
---
Yep that's why I stopped maining him, that and the fact I suck with the bottles after taking a break.
---
Jack-o-clown my new favourite skin.
---
Discrimination then :p
---
No clue. I've gotten that like 3 times in total since July last year. Just restart your game to fix. Not sure how to prevent it though.
---
Yeah that'd do it but most people run Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy, and usually neither of those XD
---
Sounds like an idea, since the killer gets blood points for a survivor DCing, why not survivors too? It’s better with the idea of if they are solo queuing to because I feel like SWF groups would purposely DC.
---
What is that ui
---
Are Moris imbalanced? Absolutely, they’re a relic of the game DbD used to be, and not very healthy for the game DbD is today. Does that justify dodging the lobby? No, no it doesn’t. All games have balancing issues, things that are considered unfair, but you stick it out until it’s changed instead of yeeting out like a bitch
---
I leave the hooks cos I failed to win in 5 gens so meh. You can look like a camping ass hole if you like for a single kill.
---
/r/OutOfTheLoop

I have no what's going on in this thread.

Woah what is this. 
---
This looks really different.
---
They did the same thing last year 5 skins and we could get 6 pieces( two full sets) 
---
I 100% gonna gets clowns not sure about the others tho.
---
It’s mobile, i need to know what the offering is since i cant find it.
---
Clown Rework
---
Clown now has 3 additional bottle types each with a Max carry capacity and cool down time 
---
Chase bottle is the one we have now.
---
Chase bottle has a max carry of 15 as 4 bottles id simply too low and they has a larger effect radius abd give survivor a slower movement speed thus making it the perfect tool to end chases.
---
Cool down time is 3 seconds
---
Tracker bottle 
---
Max carry 10
---
Creates a very clear and difficult to see snow cloud that Reveals the auras of survivors when they step into it.
---
Last for 1 minute and 30 seconds normally and can be increased up to 3 minit with add ons.
---
Cool time is 30 seconds.
---
Speed booster bottle.
---
Clown drinks this one giving him a massive speed boost allowing him to move around the map easily similar to billy but with better turning.
---
However he Cannot Attack while using it and thus Cannot Be Used Properly to help chases.
---
Max carry is 3
---
Cool down time is 45 seconds.
---
Exhaust Bottle
---
Creates a purple smoke cloud and Gives survivors exhaust status effect for 2 minutes and gives a slight hindered effect.
---
Max carry is 10
---
Cool down time is 8 seconds.
---
Can someone who played the last blight event explain to me how it worked? I had the game then but I didn't play during that event at all and wanna know how getting the skins worked without the cells.
---
Mobile
---
*Finally, a good ds change*
---
Honestly it looks pretty cool
---
The problem is the time you waste letting him wiggle free, the other 3 are flying through gens. A couple of long chases and the game is over.
---
I can't even afford to chase for too long otherwise I lose the game. You can be nice and lose the game for yourself, or enjoy the freebie and not lose
---
Granted this dynamic might be different at different ranks, but survivors are merciless at my rank.
---
Ghostface and Make Your Choice, motha fucka
---
I’ll never block messages, I honestly love the salt too much sometimes, but if a particular person gets really disrespectful and/or starts harassing me, I’ve got a stockpile of Ivory Moris just for them
---
Also, the faster you gen rush, the faster the killer needs to kill people to have a chance, so don't complain about stuff.
---
it’s weird cuz everyone complains about finding spirit and nurse 9/10 games, so I assume you are a low to mid rank player but I’m not judging (I suck at survivor)

I don't really give a shit who laughs at me, points are worth more than the silent respect of a bunch of twats I'll never see again anyway
---
After the last update, teaching new friends the game has become vastly discouraged sadly
---
he can get an unhook grab and they can't do anything about that.  Yeah, if he takes a swing i guess there's a chance.
---
Its for Halloween prob
---
I would love to see this, probably the best outfit he has wore.
---
You got bamboozled!!
---
Holy shit there is some serious projection here. Get some help dude.
---
Wish there was one legion :/
---
Still not as helpful if I'm in a chase and cant check for decoys until after and by then they are all smashing their faces into structures.
---
Samara would probably be another teleporting killer (like teleporting through TVs around the maps).
---
10%. Bruh if 4 survivors run DS then they have a 40% to win instantly. And that is without any luck offerings or up the ante. This is a horrible idea.
---
Rofl fyi your comment is so fucking dumb dude but people upvoted anyways because they're salty about people judging them for using their braindead ebony mori's. FYI everyone I'm not in rank 20 where you losers are who need ebony mori's, so feel free to use them there, you probably need em.
---
Then you're a stupid killer main
---
r/expectedjojo for balance

---
Same, I've had this like 3 or 4 times, all of them right before the ghostface chapter. I forgot about it back then and decided to upload this now.
---
Yeah its a hard one to deal with man, just throwing out some options. Dunno how i would of dealt with it. I wouldnt say its toxic, just a really smart tactic. It happens man, sometimes you just get destroyed as killer.
---
&gt;Demogorgon using The World to stop time and move to the window
---
 **Demogorgon using The World to stop time and move to the window**. He uses his powers to take control of the planet at the same time the sun rises. When the Earth is fully consumed, the remaining fragments form and fall together and create a gigantic meteor known as a Planetfall. The fragments then join the remaining planets in a spiral of destruction.  
---
As a result of the meteor, a huge earthquake causes a vast swathe of land in the West and East to be taken over and colonized by the Ghetto-dwellers.  
---
A year later, a giant meteor strikes the Earth destroying the rest of the planet, and leaving a vast number of refugees and refugees in other planets (including Earth) who are still suffering. The Ghetto-dwellers, who do not recognize the world as they knew as the Ghetto, try to flee on the moon. [formoreinfosclickherelol](https://talktotransformer.com/)
---
Yeah, all players should get extra BP if a survivor or killer DC's.
---
Dude awesome suggestions! The fisherman would be dope af!
---
Is this Eyes of Heaven 2
---
Yes, uhhhh, I'll take um all.
---
probably because Plague looks better with it or maybe she sold better idk
---
ew
---
He responded that he's a killer main, that makes it worse 🤣
---
I'm demodone with this shit
---
This is dope.
---
Ah ok
---
Spirit looks metal as fuck, they nailed the Oni look
---
I already have
---
Suggestion 2 is super broken like. Tf. You vould use it to just jump around the map and theres 0 penalty for being bad lol.
---
The hooks height problem could be easily avoided by changing them to other type of sacrificial thing. I think the problem would be how the very small killers would carry downed Survivors, the could be dragged around the map but I don't see this being practical . Anyway, great post.
---
So he wants to lose XD
---
I got it, thanks!
---
Addon then
---
I give you a topkek/10.
---
In that case I thought of another effect
---
Demo can recycle through portals letting it destroy its own portals that way it can place them somewhere else.
---
Is that effect more balanced?
---
I just play Demogorgon gen Protector and watch them suffer
---
That would really be a question for the devs, I'm not sure anyone here can answer that.
---
I think too many SWF groups fried his brain
---
Sorry to anyone who was spoiled before I could spoiler and flair it, it took a bit for this to appear for me for some reason.
---
Actually I do, take a look at the player count between Friday the 13th versus Dbd. One of those definitely has more players than the other and it's not Ft13
---
Too confusing. How about decisive deactivates after the killer hooks someone else. The timer pauses if slugged.
---
U say that until ur pc explodes and u spend the rest of ur life a lesser human bc u dont have an opinion (Also have a bit of fun every once and a while.)
---
Yeah that sounds fine
---
Hoffman has taken over.
---
I'm really excited for the clown cosmetic!!!!
---
That would be terrifying as an actual poqer in the game! A killer who makes you hallucinate...nvm just ask The Doctor.
---
Will these be purchasable with shards?
---
I got 22k lying around and I would be interested in getting the Spirit outfit
---
That’s Jake.
---
Honestly I think not being able to recycle through portals is Demongorons biggest weakness
---
You even get a lobby?
---
Then they work very hard on a perk that doesn't get used for anything except bullying
---
"Hey, can I get uuuuuuuuuuhhhh..."
---
Oh. I *think* I remember someone saying it was a way to get killers, getting the offering gives you access to the killer, but I could be completely wrong.
---
The problem here is I don't hear. I'm very hard at hearing and I can't wear headphones at all they're very uncomfortable and I need to hear what's around me out of game, as I do not live alone. I can turn my volume up but the survivors fucking scream is already too loud so I don't like too.
---
if I'm playing with others I can't hear anyway.
---
I've always learned the just not rely on sound whoring and do fine but dbd is different and the terror radius is a must so I often deal the best I can with the volume I have. So hearing him and hiding first is not at strat I can reply on.
---
The jpeg is crisp
---
Hey man, it’s a concept, it might not work
---
Look, I agree with most people this sounds like a poor idea, but that’s mainly because you are offering next to nothing in terms of backing it up. Give more details, go over how it would be balanced, something. Just saying it would be hard to do without any detail is not helping your case.
---
I think they solidified killer instinct as a distance, rather than in terror radius
---
God I hate Jake but that cosmetic is way too cool.
---
Make spirit hear survivors louder in her phasing state (does not stack with stridor) But remove all other ways for her to tell where survivors (scratch marks, notifications, fast vault sounds, ect) gens and lockers being worked on/opened should stay the same
---
Make false survivor breathing/injured noises depending on who she is chasing, if a survivor begins to move left then decoy noises will go left. The decoys however will be slightly distorted/quieter.
---
I think this would make spirit more skill based rather then RNG based for survivors
---
That definitely seems in line with what I've seen. Thank you for your answer!
---
Does everyone reset to level 20 on the 13th?
---
Give solo survivors some of the information SWFs inherently have and buff killers to compensate. Now killers are stronger and have a better chance to deal with SWF and solos dont get curb stomped by all the survivor nerfs aimed at reducing SWF frustration. Just even out both queue types to have a clearer image of what potential survivor power is and buff killers appropriately.
---
I will reply to every one of these comments I see to try and justify the bad rep those Pigs get.
---
My explanation: more often than not, if a Pig is "tunnelling a survivor with a trap on" it's due to the same reasons they'd normally "tunnel" someone. For example, if they've just been hooked in front of them, if they're injured or if they end up at the same box the Pig is at.
---
Patrolling boxes is also a legitimate strategy, particularly when they're on the way to a gen or **more importantly** if the survivor with a hat on hasn't healed, leaving themselves in a hugely vulnerable position. At times, this is often a far more viable strategy than patrolling gens, where survivors are healed and more often than not hiding, which will lead to a chase vs. simply finding an injured survivor on a box who will, 9/10 times, get their hat off.
---
Did they?
---
Ugh I want one for nea. Nea is evil, I feel like she deserves one :(
---
Sorry I am not trying to single anyone out with hearing difficulties it’s just a primary part of killer strategy, like many online competitive games. Directional sound is not as good unless you have a really excellent surround sound system.
---
You can see the electric shock on the ground in his terror radius
---
no, you reset to to a higher rank, that rank is depending on where you were during reset, so a rank 1 wont reset back to rank 20
---
I dont mind soft camping/patrolling especially if all 4 survivors are alive, but killers think its okay to hard facecamp for the 1 kill if the gates are open and i personally dont see that as fair, and you wont improve if you just think "the gates are open, the game is over". When i play killer even if i get rekt ill walk away from someone on a hook, I feel like its taking an escape from someone that probably deserves it for how they played during the game, I dont enjoy punishing people for my mistakes.
---
People forget that games are supposed to be fun, end of. Every online gaming community is pretty much the same tbh. I just started playing Killer, after being a survivor player for like the last 30 or so hours, I'm on like game 4 now as killer, and lemme tell you, I will never complain about a Killer camping or tunnelling again in a single game.  
---
I thought killer players were assholes, fuck me no. Survivor players are the worst. My last two games were terrible, The first guy I hit blocked himself in a corner, as I was about to let him out rather than just down him, he dc's. I kill one more, then I down the third and hook the last, go pick up the third, let her wiggle off to rescue the Bill, chase em a bit, kill Bill, then find the hatch, so I piss around trying to find the Claud to take her to the hatch, she finds it on her own. "Ez, noob kill" in chat. Ok whatever.  
---
Game after, theres two people with the same name, chase one down and down them, they DC, spend the next lil bit chasing round people (still not great at that) they open the gate and I find all 3 of em crouch spamming. End game chat "ur bad" "u suck" etc, these are all like rank 12 ish players.   
---
I play this game for fun, but the tryhard "always gotta be doing your best" mentality just ruins games. I used to wonder why killers camped and tunneled or insta left games rather than sticking around to chat, but now I know why. So dumb.
---
This game has always been tough for new players. Good luck. I know you can do it.
---
Meat plant
---
I'll start watching for that then
---
If you go after the rescuing survivor whenever possible you will avoid a lot of in chat hate.
---
What sort of information are you thinking? Something like making Bond or Dark Sense a permanent part of every survivor?
---
No, everyone's new rank is determined by their previous rank. If you make it to rank 1, then you reset around rank 10  or if you are rank 5, you'll be rank 13 (I don't know the actual numbers/limits, so that part is probably wrong).
---
That was me last night. We finished the gens in Lery's. I got the struggle hook rescue and took the hit for my friend... NOED. Now I'm on my second hook. I see an aura at each exit, both opposite side of map from me, and the one I unhooked manuvering through rooms and windows. 
---
I then realize... I'm actually getting left. All I could think was... This is fucked up" and also "at least the one I blocked made it out...?"
---
Nah it's the same effect as borrowed time.  It's based on the terror radius.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbxrqg/anyone_noticing_a_rise_in_face_campers_and/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Thanks bud 😄
---
yeah but if survivors didnt 99% the gate you'd see a lot more Bloodwarden in games, its dont specifically to prevent the EGC and stop Bloodwarden winning the game
---
I feel like that’s a dick move if it’s instantaneous, like you hook someone as the 5th gen pops and then camp. 
---
It’s fair play if it’s been a decent amount of time though, since you’re right there’s a good chance they’ve got gates to 99%. Personally I’d say camping is fine 1-2 minutes after the final gen popped, before then it’s a bit shitty.
---
Personally I would pick freddy
---
I have a good strat
---
Its aimed at 3 deaths
---
4 if your lucky
---
Well I don't take comp seriously. That said I can't reply on sound so when I play killer I don't.
---
But I'm not trying to play as the doctor I'm trying to play against him
---
Identify which emblems you’re struggling with, and play more towards those emblems, like pressuring gens more of your gatekeeper score is low
---
I recently came into contact with a Adam who accused me of doing such a thing. I just told him” in the endgame everything goes” and it’s nice to see I’m not the only one who thinks that😊
---
what about nurse
---
Sorta related to post, but how is going straight to a freshly powered gen salt?
---
Dont worry, we'll get our chance next year :(
---
Ahh I gotchu. I don’t really check emblems as much so I’ll start doing that. I appreciate it 😁.
---
Fixed: https://www.mediafire.com/file/8lt2w03n2qhby5t/StrangerThingsManual.zip/file
---
Admitedly, that subject is kinda touchy, we can't just give solos dark sense or object of obssesion for free. All im suggesting is to subtly close the gap between the two. Give them Kindred, Bond or maybe Empathy. Anything that heps with information regarding unhooks, general information and who is being chased.
---
The Adept killer achievements suck. Don’t feel like you have to use your power 24/7. I know I had trouble with Plague because I was trying too often to use her power. Sometimes just M1’ing isn’t so bad. 
---
Don’t be afraid to drop a chase if you feel someone is on a gen, or if there’s someone very close you can get an easy hit on. It’s best to spread out pressure on the survivors.
---
Nope. Once the last gen pops anything goes.
---
Love her! So happy to find this out. She deserves it and did a fantastic job.
---
Since a double pip is the requirement for an adept achievement (Merciless Killer is a double-pip) the emblems are your main focus for adepts
---
Try an apple a day.
---
You can just get better and adapt to the play style. Genrush? Bring Ruin and Discordance. Pallet loop? Enduring and Brutal, etc..
---
Oh ok I see. I had some really good survs who ran me around for multiple gens but overestimated their speed when running for a pallet, but never did they run in place like survs do when they lag. I usually just down them, let them recover and get picked up because that's what I'd want a killer to do when I'm lagging and it's not my fault.
---
I think its a thing now that if you kill them all too quick, you don't pip. Something with how killer emblems work now, but maybe a killer main can clarify it better since I'm mostly survivor.
---
I would have plague and pig then but i don’t. :(
---
You have earned my respect for this. Bravo
---
Cause only one gen got done. You want more points for chases and breaking gens and more hooks (I assume their teamwork was horrible and they were bad at chases)
---
They all died first hook? You camped?
---
There are loads of reasons that might mean a 4k is not a pip.
---
Spirits head is definitely the first thing I’m getting. 
---
Plagues outfit is so disappointing.
---
It doesn’t matter if you get kills now, the only way to pip high rank as killer is by extending the game as long as possible to farm points, which is hard to do since ruin can be countered by gen tapping
---
Is that real?
---
Not enough information, what's your rank?  How many times did you hook each survivor before they died?  Did you stand in proximity to the hook?
---
Apparently Ricardo actually hates the memes about him a lot. Says that he wants everyone memeing him to pay for "his image". I'm not kidding.
---
Compensate for the ability to chat by removing the ability to see.
---
Exactly. Even if they were trained VA they would have still tweaked them. You can't get the types of otherworldly freakishness without some fine tuning.
---
It’s JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure references. Specifically part 3; Stardust Crusaders. 
---
Just search up Jotaro vs. Dio and you’ll get the gist
---
Does Ghostface’s stalk rate on survivors diminish with distance between you and survivors? Will I stalk a meg touching my butt just as quick as a Claudette watching it half way across the map?
---
I prefer Freddy myself but Demogorgon comes with Nancy and she has Inner Strength which is a spicy survivor teachable.
---
Yea I know it's really annoying. I think they need to release an unranked playlist. Where people can help new players learn how to play, test out weird builds, and practice new killers. It would be awesome and worth no points but it would allow that kind of thing.
---
If I’m not mistaken, as long as there are survivors near a hooked survivor, you won’t lose any points, so especially during the endgame there’s no point to leave, and doing so often nets you more hooks/kills. 
---
Even with the EGC, I still feel that endgame needs a bit more work done to it, especially since most of my games (red ranks) go to endgame quite often, and is the most important stage of a match.
---
Isn't she already without terror radius while crouched? The giveaway being the sound of the blade and the tiger roar...
---
It’s survivor that has the main issues. I find killer games quick right as bloodhunt ends too
---
Not underrated on a pink addon Myers tho
---
You need to do decent on all emblems to pip. If you didnt chase them for a while you wont get a pip
---
HE'S IN    
---
Oh wait..
---
Depends on what you want. Freddy is definitely the stronger killer, but Demogorgon is pretty fun.
---
Great minds slay alike!  Both def have fantastic Prestige looks, jus gotta find the extra time to farm Bloodpoints for it xD.  I only jus returned to playing after a few months respite, so catching up with leveling Demogorgon up some! Curse you near unending grind!
---
Both fun .. Demegorgon is fun in the chase but Freddys map control and Mind fuckery are fun too.
---
Sisters killer and Jill were both before and after Jigsaw being in his life respectively. as well as the police station massacre.
---
The Angel trap was specifically Amanda " Amanda however had started to doubt the methods of her mentor and therefore manipulated the trap, thereby giving Kerry no chance to survive. ([*Saw III*](https://sawfilms.fandom.com/wiki/Saw_III), [*IV*](https://sawfilms.fandom.com/wiki/Saw_IV)) " - quote from the Wiki
---
The chain trap was also Amanda's work.
---
You need to remember that Saw 2 and 3 only include Hoffman when they retroactively added him later in Saw 4, meaning that you need to only look at the films as they are, Saw 2 even has a scene showing Amanda walk up to Kerry as she is dying, clearly showing Amanda planned for her to die.
---
It was 5 killers and 2 survivors last year. looks like we're not getting free skins this year
---
People sleep on Wraith too much.
---
Freddy, he is a ton of fun to play and easily one of the best killers.  Excellent map controls, applies lots of pressure, and is agile.  Not to mention the stealth aspect as survivors can only see you once you close in on them (while awake).  Sometimes I feel games with Freddy are too easy.  
---
Demo if you want more of a challenge.
---
Don’t know what to say, sorry I can’t help you more.
---
U need 6-8 hooks, keep as many gens as possible for 9mins, end chases quick, but not too quick, make sure hit before u leave a survivor, stop healings as much as u can and never be under the 16 meters range of a hook if u aren’t/haven’t been chasing somebody, yeah killer is way harder than just killing them.
---
you lose points if you're in the 32m range of a hook
---
Haven't You Heard?
---
I love demogorgon so much, it always seems so casual walking and grabbing/carrying people for a crazy eating monster
---
It's the strangest thing, on paper having someone who can pretty much guarantee downs even at strong loops (eventually) should be better, yet...Clown suffers. Not that Clown is worse than say, Trapper or Leather, but some of my worst games I've ever had have been with Clown.
---
Niche as he'll. Lol
---
Honestly I prefer my Sloppy Butcher, Thanataphobia, Dying Light build.
---
Not really, Hoffman followed the rules that Jigsaw set out when he followed him, by the same merit Amanda killed multiple people with traps or other ways while still directly under Jigsaw's influence
---
I've played on PS4 for 3 years and I've only had maybe 20 insanely entitled survivors during that time actually message me about endgame open exit gate camps.  Very weird man.
---
Laugh. Laugh at the meme.
---
I thought that as long as there are survivors near the hook I don’t lose points. I can attest to this as in the situations where I’m juggling survivors trying to get a hook save for well over a minute, I’m not given any penalty for Prox. to hook at all.
---
9/10 it triggers when working on the first gen, it’s Ruin it’s triggering for. 😂 as for triggering for the same totem you’re cleansing, you’re absolutely right so take my upvote anyway.
---
I buffed the slugging aspect of it and the stun and I nerfed the BS hits you get when you hook someone else and then get DS'd, which happens more than you imagine.
---
I made it a true anti-tunnel and anti-camp, if you can't see that then I do not know what to tell you.
---
I hope you mean power lol
---
yes
---
I don't block messages because you lose out on some really funny wholesome exchanges too.
---
This happened last night to my friend with Billy. as well as his active Deliverance didnt work.
---
It's far more scary when they have monitor and abuse
---
I have chosen freddy because i have just watched his gameplay and compared it to when i played Demo on the ptb and he looks and sound more fun
---
I mean... Its broken and you spend more time relaunching the game in hopes of the errors resetting ...
---
getting to red ranks as nurse with those perks is about as impressive as not pissing over the entire bathroom when going to take a leak
---
It's not confusing it's simple, making it to what you just said makes it impossible for the killer to win at the end game when you slug someone who has just been unhooked and everyone else is at the gates. No one misses the DS Skill Check. If you do then that's you being bad.
---
The point is: there's a totem near a gen, it triggers, it's a dull, so no big, then you go back to the gen and is forced to cleanse that because small game will trigger every 10 sec
---
and people say survivors are salty. Imagine being so titled you generalize every one who plays with a friend as a seal team six SWF groupthen make a thread on reddit about how much you "don't care" post that's filled with tears lmao. can we get an F in chat for OP
---
Does The Pig's Ambush attach work correctly with exposed? What about perks that specify "basic attack" like Sloppy Butcher?
---
No one is shoving anything. It’s not like you’re forced to partake in this thread
---
Umm that is a perfect score which means you got iridescent in all emblems which means you should of gotten a merciless.
---
I don’t like the plague one. There’s nothing original about it. They just took the original skin and made the boils and pus serum I get they do this for the skins but they at least added more to the others. All in all, Skins are pretty cool.
---
Kart by Daylight when?
---
Pretty much agree on the optimal survor thing, don't forget if they bring instas and keys, gonna be an extra fun time!
---
Little upset we still don't have demon Feng and Elephant Clown :(
---
I pity any high rank survivor still gen tapping. (Survivor main)
---
He said only with GF's perks and the free perks.
---
I don't see how anyone would ever be banned for it in the first place.
---
All it does is crawl through an admittingly sorta messy log file where it grabs the killer's profile, then presents it to the user in a way that's less of an eyesore. It doesn't actually interact with the game itself in any way whatsoever.
---
If you really wanted to you could grab the same information yourself by manually reading the log file, as well as all sorts of information about events happening in the game that aren't relevant to the MLEB.
---
If you want to take a look at the log files you can find them in %localappdata%\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Logs
---
With lack of information there's way too many reasons.
---
Some reasons why:
---
Very little hooks (Multiple Survivors only got hooked once)
---
Very few chases
---
Instant Downs in chases
---
Staying near the hooked Survivor when unnecessary
---
it was 5 killer and 2 survivor skins. 2 less this year. Probably no free skins this year, or at least less than it was
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who missed this. I logged on during the last 20-30 minutes of it.
---
You don't have to pay for nurse to get her perks she a free killer
---
Don’t pull your hair out when going against super organized teams!
---
im sure you have bro
---
Ohh...I thought I missed the annoucement. That sucks, but thanks!
---
But only two free perks are even worth it.
---
Like if this is a real new ability, this would be super cool.
---
the correlation between dstrike and toxicity is none lmao. the fuck are you talking about lol
---
* Double (triple) BP  
---
* Limited time cosmetics
---
* New intro theme song
---
* Map theme change
---
I get what you’re saying but 1000 points is 1000 points. If you’re running SG I take it your goal is to cleanse them all anyway?
---
I’m afraid not. I remember I got a silver in gatekeeper and I remember seeing only two iridescents in other categories. Not sure which ones tho
---
Soon^TM
---
Edgy Teens don't get drugged. i guess D.A.R.E. can't even convince them from the entity
---
I tried it 5 times while dbp event ... and because of this happening, I didn't played it. 
---
But the patch seems to be fixing it.
---
i want one for thiccy bricky
---
A dead by daylight player on here
---
Yup, it's like a balance between the two, while the uneducated may think this is confusing or a buff to the perk, it makes you not want to slug and go for other survivors away from the hook. Obviously if you are 24m+ away from the hook it'd cancel out, but that lends itself to you using say BBQ to optimise your own pathing for finding survivors.
---
All in all I think it's good and does incentivise fair play.
---
Yeah the game is less fun at high ranks. Everyone is just running meta shit that makes the game less fun.
---
Survivors get to deal with every killer running bbq ruin nurses and having every Billy and nurse giga sprint across the map for your ass after wallhacking your location after hooking a survivor that they one shot despite the fact that you were tactically operating with the stealth aptitude of Sam Fischer up until this point. And hiding in a locker only damns your other teammate who didn't.
---
Killers get to deal with flashlight wielding dead harder loop gods who will decisively strike your asshole if you have the gall to pull them out of the locker (that they entered in front of your face after getting unhooked) that they are inner strength healing in.
---
Everything is cheesy as fuck when the game is being played optimally. I'm 100 hours rank 6 but this game is already losing its appeal the more the stale meta keeps being abused and optimized.
---
it did last time i played hag
---
Learning to play this game is most definitely an uphill battle.
---
Might I ask what killer you're playing?
---
jeff and jake can have man buns
---
You're getting chase points because you're most likely seeing survivors.
---
Did you like the playstyle or commentary?
---
Did you take a look at the playlist to see every killer is being played on the way to red ranks friend so far there is trapper, huntress, myers, doctor, spirit and plague with more killers recorded such as hag, wraith, billy, pig, clown, the nightmare and more coming up soon? 
---
Any constructive criticism is welcomed!
---
I agree. Started playing the game as survivor, got angry at killers who I thought picked on me or tunneled me.
---
Switched to killer for some fresh air, and along with not having to worry about if my teammates are dicks or not, I totally understand how things can feel like tunneling.
---
I imagine the survivors cursing me, saying I am tunneling, or camping. 
---
Well, you shouldn't have unhooked him with NOTHING else going on, when I just turned my back, the noise from the unhook and the knowledge that there are TWO survivors right there means that is the BEST place to go as a killer.
---
You have been hooked once or twice, and are running injured? Your full health co-survivor should try and distract or take the hit for you so you can both escape (cuz frankly I aint that good, and if there is a cornfield my eyesight sucks hardcore there). 
---
I have learned to be a better altruistic survivor by playing killer, well maybe not action on it, but I can identify what should be done.
---
I tried my best in making it fair for both sides and punishing scummy gameplay, I am glad you approve.
---
Is that black prior from for Honor
---
Not too sure but increasing my terror radius with distressing didn't increase the range of killer instinct, and the iridescent button makes your terror radius effect the whole map but you can't see killer instinct across map either
---
Clown's outfits are kinda crap right now. He has very few outfits.
---
why does every survivor have the same perks varying in tiers 👁👁
---
If you want both it’s better to buy the pack. 
---
If you just want one, just buy cells.
---
Buying both with cells is silly
---
I like this i can’t wait for this but the one thing is it goes against my colour scheme which is dark colours
---
She’s my main.
---
What you suggest should be an addon, not the default behavior of his hallucinations. Right now when they spawn near someone they always appear facing the person they spawned on. That's incredibly useful when using restraint addons to always have a general idea of where people are.
---
Lol figured you would but one can wish right? I know it will never happen just like face camping will never stop...
---
Huh, well i guess it doesn’t matter then
---
It's spooky month which means you're only allowed to play Ghostface and Meyers
---
Yeah, he's an absolute teabag magnet
---
I still own two of the them. That’s 10 dollars more than the pack 8 dollar pack lol. I didn’t know.
---
i see billies, huntresses, shapes with noed every day
---
We even reached the point of people being banned on all platforms which is hilarious
---
I started running it heavily a few weeks ago and honestly the only notification issue I have us the fact that there's no telling the difference between a totem and a fake Freddy Pallet or Hag trap etc...I think totems should have a distinct sound compared to the notifications for various killer ability traps.
---
because purple ranks are where the majority of players are.
---
More like Claudette with empathy so that they can stay far far away from the killer.
---
Distortion works as intended and does not affect Killer Instinct notifications.
---
Though, I think the perk is absolutely fantastic. It's simultaneously a counter and an info perk.
---
tl;dr Distortion is great at what it does - information denial and gathering. You cannot replace the effect it has. However, you can always play against/around Killer Instinct notifications if you don't want to run the counter perks.
---
It's a hard counter to BBQ, Scratched Mirror Myers, Rancor, Outdoor Security Camera Ghostface, I'm All Ears, Territorial Imperative, and Bitter Murmur.
---
It soft-counters Nurse's Calling (will activate if nearby. Does not hide other survivor's aura, iirc).
---
You get three tokens - if you know they are using BBQ, then hide in a locker. Paying attention to *when* and *why* you lost a stack reveals info to you.
---
Healing a buddy with zero terror radius and you lost a token? That means both that the killer is a stealth killer *and* they've got nurse's. They've probably seen your buddy's aura, so its time to relocate. Keep in mind, through the rest of the match, that they have Nurse's.
---
A generator was completed and you lost a token? If you were near the generator, it could be Bitter. If you're not near the generator at all, it's Rancor.
---
Are you fighting a Ghostface who just downed a Marked survivor? If you losy a token, he's got Outdoor Security Camera (add-on which does a 4-sec reveal each time he downs a marked survivor).
---
Did you fast vault and lose a token? Killer's got I'm All Ears.
---
You can even synergize Distortion with things like Babysitter or even Object of Obsession (the latter requiring slick camera control).
---
It doesn't *need* to hide you from Killer Instinct.
---
Tired of screaming? Run Calm Spirit or change up how you play. (Stay away from doctors, get away from killers who are known to have Infectious Fright, stay away from lockers due to Iron Maiden - all info you can gather beforehand).
---
Don't wanna deal with Rushed Vault/Locker Exit/Entry? Run Quick n Quiet or change up how you play.
---
Wanna reveal Ghostface or stay in Legion's terror radius during frenzy? Change up how you go about fighting them. Making a core part of a killer's kit null and void would make Distortion unbalanced.
---
Distortion is great at giving you information you otherwise would not be able to gather. There is absolutely no replacing its value. Any time you or a teammate would have been revealed through Killer Instinct, you get information as to what they're running, regardless of perks. Without Distortion, you're left with assumptions about the killer.
---
Healing near the killer without distortion. Do they have Nurse's or do they have a good set of headphones?
---
Killer came straight to your area after hooking. Does the killer have BBQ or perhaps its game sense?
---
Myers looking straight at a wall towards your teammate. Do they have scratched mirror or are they just playing REALLY strangely? (I've encountered a Myers like that)
---
Only if the tutorials weren't so bare bones.
---
Billy was a paid actor
---
Dash is not considered a basic attack, so it does not work with Exposed (or at least it shouldn't.)
---
ngl you should've just left :/ not trying to be rude just honest
---
?
---
i think its from LotR
---
It should be a tighter cone, too.
---
Also, maybe it's just me, but I feel that every totem-related perk for survivors should have a totem count.
---
Ghostface stalks at the same rate at point blank or at his 40 meter maximum.
---
Myers is the one with a weird Stalk curve.
---
lol i love the gag
---
It would be literally impossible for us to tell you why you didn't pip off the 4k without context.  Next time you do a post like this at least include a screenshot (blacked out names of course) of the final loadout screen so we can see scores of everyone involved.  
---
This game isn't all about kills.  If you got them via ebony mori, or trash camps or something you depip and lose often despite kills.
---
I haven't really settled on a killer. I've played Freddy the most technically but Ive played him mostly pre-rework. I've been playing a lot more Micheal when I picked up the game again. 
---
Really I need to know how to play the game not how to play a specific hero.
---
What is the proper approach to report to the devs that a certain youtube channel is advertising cheats and hacks from a website? Now the channel seems like it mostly advertises hacks for all kinds of games from mostly a certain website. Also the video could be an old one and be a reupload, hard to tell since the quality is subpar.
---
YES, small game level 1 is WAY powerful than SM level 3, they should inverse that
---
he probably had slow reaction time to being healed because If you don't know someone has an insta let alone going to use it on you, it can catch you off guard. Surprise factor
---
It's a good build regardless, you can get the drop on them more often than not with it, and the bleedout still works with terror radius, just not killer instinct
---
Add an official in-game voicechat, then SWF will be less OP because communication with random people will be improved.
---
This leads to extra toxic stuff though
---
the jake cosmetic 😩 I'm ready for this event
---
Maybe it’s a rank thing? I’ve found the salt amplifies as you climb the ranks
---
You gotta look Myers right in the eye as you mess it up. It’s a power move.
---
Hawkins lab,may be an indoor map but its pretty damn good when it comes to loops.
---
And of course there was also the [instant message](https://imgur.com/a/aLteb1D) popping op of course
---
Epic Clip!
---
Downvote me all you want, I still stand by my opinion. The graphics are cool and all but you really can't call this an objective tier list.
---
The Spirit looks scary af
---
Yeah, last I tested it was the PTB where he got changed, so my info isn't reliable
---
Long as he doesn’t cut you up he’s safe then, and now you have no weapon to defend yourself! Run!
---
Totally is.
---
Steve lookin thicc
---
What ended up happening was that people didn't end up getting saved because one hooked player meant that one less person was out there roaming to harvest the serum. And when a survivor only need a small % to fill up their vial in the beginning of the round, they would die on purpose to get into the next round once they got their fill.
---
I dislike events for this very reason, changes the behavior of players and feels like everyone is only playing to grind out the unlockables. Good to make the game seem active, but not very fun to play. In my personal opinion.
---
This might be the actual worst comment section I've ever seen on this sub. Not sure why but this video brought out all the 15 year old pro gamers from the woodwork.
---
I thought the video was funny. I can definitely relate lmao. I'm only rank 11 but this seems like pretty typical play from rando teammates. That instaheal was poor planning on the Nancy's part, the pallet was probably an accident, I bet she panicked.
---
Thank you so much! ☺ it doesn't look that bad after all.
---
Oh gotcha
---
I am newer to killer (level 35 bubba), and I can easily note how some of my actions may cause the survivors to think I am tunneling, but I can also easily identify in those instances how the other survivors should be distracting or taking the hit since they have full health.
---
As a killer I am not going to just ignore the only survivor on my screen, the only one leaving visible scratch marks that I can follow.
---
That is one reason I have switched primarily to playing killer as I was getting sick of my fellow survivors playing like they are alone or only in it to survive for themselves.
---
The spirit giving me The Spitter Vibes from Left 4 dead 2
---
That’s some bs
---
And you didn't mark anything as spoiler. Thanks.
---
I wish Save The Best For Last got a little more love
---
I will be as clear as I can be. In a situation like this, at the end game screen after the match has ended, I receive no penalty, no (-% prox to hooked survivor) asa result of the survivors staying near the hook for over a minute while I try to juggle them getting the hooked survivor off. 
---
Are you then telling me that by doing chases with multiple survivors, those chase points are directly impacting the prox to hook penalty points?
---
Her face without the hair looks like an outlast 1 character

I CALLED IT!  I CALLED THIS SKIN!  I WILL NOW HAVE TO SPEND SEVERAL HOURS DIGGING THROUGH POSTS FROM NEARLY A YEAR AGO JUST TO FIND THAT ONE COMMENT I MADE TO STROKE MY OWN EGO!

Jesus Christ shut the fuck up about jojo

i really love spirit's and clown's, lmao
---
I'd recommend watching some [Entity Education.](https://youtu.be/yTa6Q-lmaTk) (He also has videos for each killer, if you want to get into that.)
---
Yep the owner of a subreddit dedicated to dead by daylight leaks wont even take 2 seconds to mark spoiler. All he wants is to watermark his crappy subreddit and spam it whenever he gets the chance.
---
You are absolutely wrong my dude...
---
Page 284, section 3 of the survivor’s rule book for killer’s states 
---
“One the exit gates are open and a survivor has been placed on a hook, the killer must walk far enough away for another survivor to go for the rescue and exit the match”
---
Learn the rules bro👎
---
Yes.
---
In low ranks they do it because it works, 
---
At any decent skill level it would cost them the game
---
Oh yeah! Jake mains unite!
---
tfw trying to get a gf on psn
---
If I get sick you buy meds for me fr.
---
This post has nothing to do with jojo
---
Jake is fucked
---
Deal
---
This game can get boring as fucking shit because most players are boring as fucking shit. Having fun nonsense for like a week is fine even if it causes people to lose
---
So?
---
When you boutta kill the last person who can stop your world domination plan but his arm twitches in stopped time.
---
I get that, but I’m talking about killers that will ignore a survivor trying to take a hit to go for the unhooked survivor
---
No I don’t like using NOED, especially now that Inner Strength is a thing, I just don’t think it’s that good of a perk. Maybe it’s a specific killer thing? I’ve been maining Freddy since his rework, I know some people have issues with him
---
Considering you are not replying and just recommenting information that YES punishes you for tunnelling and you arguing FOR it. I simply can't continue to hear this idiocy.

---
3% then.
---
😂🤦‍♀️
---
Huh. Ight.
---
I think it'd be fun to run from the survivor now and then instead.
---
But the problem is that you can’t counter his ability when it’s this buggy/inconsistent. And not even in a nurse or spirit kinda way where it takes a lot of game knowledge or mind games to counter their ability, there is sometimes nothing the survivor can do to counter him because the reveal mechanism doesn’t work.
---
He's already pretty weak man, without stalk banking he'd literally just be a Legion-tier M1 killer. As it is it's still extremely easy to expose him because of the buffer that keeps progress going for like half a second which can be completely fatal to the power if the player doesn't have lightning reflexes
---
Adding this perk won't make the games the same. So comparing them like that is a false analogy.
---
Agreed. Plus it's somewhat a bit of irony. Considering Anna's bunny motif and the whole predator prey dynamic. 
---
And from the plague pic, I'm sorry that you've just gotten silence, but if you ever get your designs printed, please let me know. I'd love this one on a shirt, mug, mouse pad, or just something. (If I did want to do it, would I, as of right now, contact you and ask?)
---
Millenial.
---
Yeah lol. Hopefully they're saving her and Legion for the next Halloween.
---
That goes against the lore heavily
---
Omg I love it so cute!
---
That's fine, but don't be mad when I click my flashlight or teabag at you. I am trying to get your attention during a game, I am trying to get you mad and play irrationally and focus me so I and my teammates can capitalize on your mistakes, and it works.
---
I like using insidious to make survivors think it's a hallucination but it's actually me. It's a pretty big risk though because if they don't happen to come through where I'm predicting them then I've wasted a ton of time while they do gens.
---
I get that’s it’s a bug but this has been an issue in every match as far as I know since the last hot fix and they specifically mentioned it in the patch notes if you actually read them.  The timer was just out of sync between survivors and killer.
---
Fuck
---
Well played
---
if someone DCs and you tunnel me for 3 hooks you bet your ass I'm going to DC
---
This feels like Spirit would be weakened to a point as bad as Wraith, but oh wait she cant see anything so probably much worse.
---
I kinda wish Blindness Perks and higher end add-ons lasted longer(for add-ons) and had a darkening effect like Legion's Deep Wounds/Plague's Vomit effects..... Would actually, imo, give something more fun to mess with Survivors imo....
---
Spoilers in DBD? How?
---
It swings in a weird way, just have to get use to it.
---
I want all of them. And I never play clown or spirit
---
Lol I was teaching some friends how to play about a week ago in kyf. I was doing jump scare Myers with them and my one friend who’s had it forever. He hears one of the newbs yell “Stop following me!” A few seconds later he hears”Jesus how’d you get so fast?!” We both burst out laughing. 
---
A few real games later we hear him say it again and tell him to never let that bad man find him again.
---
I jumped in a match today where I had 105ms ping overall. Noone at home to ruin my connection. Long story short, whatever happened to me as well. Not in that level though and it is not the first time. Even with 200ms ping that I used to have when it was hard to find a match, you don't get down like this. The difference between player's lag,killer's lag and killer's lag switching is obvious. You are a fool if you blame OP's connection for this clip
---
i started playing killer again recently after taking a break for a month and i had a pretty bad game turn into a 3k because i decided to throw the game to chase my last bbq stack. let me just say i usually dont bother camping at the end of the game even if the survivors were ... "toxic" but let me tell you, its always the survivors who were being extra in game who have the most to say about how YOU played in post game chat. i love it.
---
It's not Steve. It's purchasable with event points and therefore can't be a licensed character cosmetic
---
What a toxic and mentally exhausting attitude lmao
---
During the event you had to fill a little vial during gameplay, for survivors you would do this by effectively milking these little pustules that turned up around the map. For killers, you would have to hook survivors on the event hooks. I can't remember how many vials you had to fill for tokens or what but you were restricted to 6 outfit pieces without cells, I think. Gameplay during the last one was *rough* lmao. But all these skins are so GOOD.
---
So what? I'll take bloodpoints over a random stranger's respect any day.
---
You'll probably be able to get enough in in-event currency to get 3 or 6 pieces. (Either 1 complete costume, 2 complete costumes, or mix and match.)
---
I say either 3 or 6 because I've believe they've done it both amounts in the past. I think the last time it was 3 pieces.
---
finally the devs did something about teabaggers. LIKE JUST GTFO!
---
I can't like this enough
---
This game is buggy as hell. You also dont hear huntress  wind up hatchets sometimes.
---
If Clown's facial expressions change with that head skin that's an immediate buy from me
---
8 seems fair as you would still be able to increase the max with add ons
---
For exhaust 5 seconds is fair Though there should be ad ons that up the time
---
I find empathy much more useful in finding the killer across the map. 
---
Bond works great for finding someone close for a heal, who's on a gen and where the killer is but at a limited range.
---
No, empathy is better for longer range information. Bond is good knowing how to avoid a hit from the killer when your teammate is being chased and you don't need to a thing to proc it. Empathy can only cover 2 survivors too.
---
STBFL is a game changer in those situations.
---
I won't stop being baffled that people somehow fail to notice that the timer stopped for over a minute.
---
He has no collision when he’s stalking so you could’ve just ran through him instead of letting him stalk both of you lmao
---
I always love when Survivors all rush the hook and constantly trade unhooks in the end game and then act all high-and-mighty in post-game chat for saving the person I "tunnelled" or "had a vendetta against" or whatever. Bruh I really don't give a shit which one of you I kill but one is better than none. And you guys hook trading just gets me more BP and more emblems so go right on ahead and destroy my "scummy tunnelling camper" ways by giving me more of what I want lol
---
Omg Sidney with this outfit would be awesome!
---
Except I never said there was shame in using meta perks. Like.... at all. 
---
I said not to call out survivors for using meta perks when killers (including you) do the exact same thing across all tiers.
---
I had this happen too. Better off to just level your killer up some while playing survivor then swap over when you've got your 4 perks to choose from. After that point who you play against don't really matter.
---
Purple flashlight with those addons? Those addons are garbo since the flashlight nerf lmao, use batteries. Also iron will is so not meta, its a great perk, but you need balanced landing haddonfield to be meta
---
They're very good, I'm aiming for the clown, spirit, and Jake one if I'm able to unlock them in game but if it is possible I'll try to get the other two just to have them
---
Red moss is actually borderline op actually if you're smart with you portal placement.
---
Demo's been hanging out with the Doctor I see.
---
This is scarily accurate.
---
Get high and play with headphones, Wraith can still make me shit myself
---
I don't even play clown and I need that
---
99% the gate makes no difference on Blood Warden because BW activates as soon as the gate is POWERED not open. I just had a match yesterday where the killer took one kill to three because of Blood Warden. 
---
You want more kills after exit gate powered? BW, not camping.
---
Pig is licensed so it's tougher
---
The drawback seems like a deal breaker to me you'll have to use the recovery add on to fully use it
---
NO need to be rude amigo, sheesh
---
Ohh, I didn’t realize that.  So if everyone is in range, bond will pick them up?  But Empathy will only ever highlight 2, if injured?
---
 Although you can use Ruin to slow the game down, Pig's traps should do the trick, provided you can down survivors in reasonable time. If you can quickly find, chase, and down survivors and get traps on their heads you'll slow down the game tremendously. However, if all the gens go before you get your four traps on survivors, your traps will become useless. **Your objective here is to down a survivor and trap them before the first generator pops**, then go find another survivor and repeat.
---
The tricky part is combating different survivor playstyles:
---
* The Pallet Dropper:
---
   * Common at low ranks. Just runs from pallet to pallet dropping them on you. Ultimately a bad strategy but with no ruin this will allow their teammates with enough time to complete the gens. I use **Enduring** to challenge these pallets and **Spirit Fury** to eventually down them at the third pallet.
---
   * Learn which pallets are safe and which are unsafe. An **unsafe pallet** is a pallet that you can run around to either side and get a hit if the survivor keeps vaulting the pallet, and a **safe pallet** is a pallet that you can't hit the survivor and have to kick.
---
* The Pallet Looper:
---
   * Uses simple pallet loops (like the ones on Autohaven, Macmillan) to waste time. Learn to use Pig's **dash attack** to down survivors around short loops (there should be some youtube tutorial you can find but basically you crouch at the pallet and charge your dash, faking one direction and then actually dashing in the other direction to hit them on the other side of the loop). Learn to **hide your red stain** to mindgame short loops with line of sight blockers (basically you fake going one way and then walk backwards and turn and hit them when they run into you). Learn how to **run common structures**, such as the shack and the Coldwind cow tree.
---
   * Some survivors are very good at looping, or know how to utilize very strong loops on certain maps. In some situations it is better to abandon a chase to find a less skilled survivor or a survivor in a worse position.
---
* The Jungle Gym Looper:
---
   * Jungle Gyms are generated structures with some number of pallets and windows. I would watch ScottJund's [video](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ) on how to run them. With Pig I like to use **I'm All Ears** to reveal the survivor's aura when they vault the window, then crouch to hide my stain and terror radius and meet them on whichever side of the wall they move to (remember, you don't have to use your dash to hit them, you can just stand up and m1 them).
---
* The Claudette:
---
   * Some survivors hide in corners and behind terrain. Crouch while patrolling generators (you can use **Monitor and Abuse** to reduce the range at which you have to crouch) in order to surprise survivors working on them. I use **Barbecue and Chili** to locate survivors and also give me a ton of information about who's going for the save, who's on a generator, and who's getting a trap off their head (also for bloodpoints).
---
* The Flashlight Clicker:
---
   * These survivors are cocky and usually in a Survive With Friends (SWF; a four stack). They are confrontational and seek you out trying to bait you with different perks and jukes. **Keep a cool head**; if you play well these survivors will give you an easy win since they aren't focused on their objective, they're focused on messing with you. They are generally good at looping but will play in a risky manner that you can take advantage of.
---
The build I run is **Enduring**, **Spirit Fury**, **Barbecue and Chili**, and **I'm All Ears**. Other good perks on the Pig are Hex: Ruin, A Nurse's Calling, Whispers, Sloppy Butcher, Monitor and Abuse, Brutal Strength, Surge, or really any of your favorite perks.
---
**TL;DR: Pig's game slowdown relies on an early down to start applying pressure with her RBTs. Use chase perks and good chase strategy to quickly down survivors and apply pressure. Or just use ruin and hope it doesn't get cleansed right away.**
---
Really? Every time I got a perfect score I got merciless.
---
Killer main here, I get more points when I leave hook even if they escape. A petty kill isnt gonna help you pip but you do whatever suits your play style. Camping will lose you all your chaser points
---
Omg clown yes
---
Plague’s looks very bland compared to the others
---
Calm Spirit is what your looking for
---
I know but I still can't imagine doing that in 60 seconds .-.
---
There are a lot of weird things about Ghostface's detection. [Here's a video I made](https://youtu.be/DkDyYBg5oYw?t=256) that might help you understand it a bit better.
---
Like are they unfair/balanced. Etc
---
Just wanted to make sure I clarified your comment. A lot of newer players see these “CaMpInG iS a StRaT” posts and think it’s a 10000 IQ Galaxy-Brain play. New players need to know they’ll get destroyed anywhere above rank 10 running these strats
---
1. Why should it cancel out a whole killer's power
---
2. That would burn through hella distortion tokens
---
And if you want to piss off a hag player, purposely set off all her traps as soon as she picks someone up/hits someone across the map.
---
They deserve it
---
Yeah, I am a killer main at heart (but play survivor equally because I like to mess around in a duo with a friend) and the things people say at 2 am are wild.
---
"How did you know where my friend was at the end? He was in the corner of the map away from any gens!!"
---
Me: Has BBQ and Bitter Murmur. "I don't know, just a lucky guess, I suppose."
---
Strong very strong, but not completely uncounterbale
---
Yep. In fact, if, for some reason, I'm still around by the time the exit gates are open AND someone is hooked, and the killer is leaving the hook, I'll run for the fucking hills and hide in a locker, because that smells like NOED + Blood Warden incoming.
---
Do you want fun or Try hard
---
A glitch in the Matrix. *Whoa*
---
She cute, She fun, but her power being "down the nearest injured person" is something I despise, especially cuz when the survivor is healthy her power is actually a fun mind-game to me.
---
When injured there's literally no counterplay tho.
---
It's an offering for more vessels for the moonrise even what was a time ago.
---
Plot twist, the left one is actually Nea
---
And whos who
---
 Wtf, is this recent? Try to use in one trial to se what happens.
---
Demo is fun and freddy is try hard
---
I specifically said “don’t act like survivors are the only ones using meta perks and killers aren’t”. I’m pointing out that he’s being one sided about his statement by using his exact words against him. It’s pretty obvious. 
---
At no point to I say or indicate using meta perks is bad. If I did, please provide a quote of what I said to make you think/feel that.
---
Oh thats correct,but one occasion minus I still have a valid point without any toxicity
---
There's already perks like that.
---
People who are hateful assholes will sent you hatemail because it makes them feel better.
---
The 99 sensible people who agree with OP's sentiment will consider it an obvious thing and not bother messaging anyone about.
---
Five gigs? The patch on Steam is 351.5 MB for me o_O
---
I'm inviting other people to back it up too.
---
Christ they look so sickkkkkk
---
He can be played in so many different ways depending on his add ons. He’s probably one of the most balanced killers and most fun to play.
---
And your solution, is to make the problem worse?
---
I do not have agitation and with the current match making I get put up against rank 1s who body block in pairs with flashlights.
---
The survivor becomes the killer. I don't see how that's against the lore.
---
Yeah I’ve never understood the logic behind going out of your way to send hate mail, but man some of the shit I get sent really does make my day
---
Franklin's might be my favorite perk
---
Not if another survivor is within a certain range of the hook as well
---
we are , it's an event lmao
---
Sure, sounds good
---
Arguable that it will hold ruin the game.
---
I always thought it was strange that people consider certain perks to be "toxic". toxicity doesn't come from your perks, it comes from your attitude
---
It really depends on who you vs. every time I've tried I had the 3rd or 4th person sit in lockers just to deny me the achievement.
---
Did anyone else read this I’m scouts voice or just me?
---
“We’re not being toxic by bringing noed we’re just tired of losing”
---
Do I see this right that we actually are getting shirtless clown?? 👀
---
If the perk is balanced properly then no issues would occur.
---
Wow someone commented on a Reddit thread. HELP I'M BEING OPPRESSED!
---
You're correct. That other person is embarrassingly incorrect
---
no pls don't spoil my *skins*
---
Die
---
It is balanced perfectly as is. Not being in the game is the perfect balance for that
---
He has the slow start but he can be deadly mid-late game. So, yes.
---
I want to see ash just obliterate any of the legion. That would be absolutely amazing to watch
---
Thats what everyone did
---
Who's the one with bs?
---
It is an ai from open ai that just complete his post as it thought it would go on lol
---
I mean I really think we're splitting hairs here on this comment.  Yes naturally camping with gens up is stupid and will most likely result in them losing themselves the game.  But if were to ask the 1 person they did remove from the game via this method I'm sure they'd consider themselves to be a stupid dick lol.  I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm saying there's almost little to no difference and that both simultaneously apply.
---
i would love to main Sam Winchester
---
Any decent killer would know camping before gates are powered is a complete permanoob crutchy badge-of-dishoner at best and pathetic baby rage at worst.
---
Let people enjoy what they want to enjoy. So what if I don't want to be spoiled by the new stuff coming to the game. It just ruins the hype for when it actually gets revealed.
---
Don't know why you're so sure, will see
---
2 free hits are huge. Also, not hard for swf to coordinate saves. People running it will most likely not even be doing gens. They will be running around. Eitherway, survivors need to earn free hits and it should be difficult, not impossible.
---
What's that
---
Does the pallet obsession thing sound like spirit fury or is it just me
---
It's been leaked, the skins have been shown and the event offering was changed so if it's pretty much coming
---
Maybe they'll change it so you can get them all through gameplay, that'd be really sweet! But not the end of the world if not! :)
---
Nah it essentially would make them the same
---
generators. quickly.
---
Hi Chris
---
U know the ones that did the Dota 2 bot
---
pig
---
It burns through tokens if you stay in his range and what the fuck do you mean that's his entire power lmao you've obviously never played Legion
---
Balanced Landing. I've tried not running it, but the stagger in certain loops is just too painful. Balanced Landing is like my crack.
---
I can’t stop watching this.
---
This looks like an older bloodweb. I doubt the 4 perks that should be in a level 50 bloodweb are all on the side the text is on
---
Yeah lol, I'll be satisfied anyways if I can at least get one
---
Well, I have yet to see a strong argument on your part, anywhere on the thread
---
Well, they definitely don’t need the BP and they probably prefer everyone else play the game instead of watch it.
---
Yeah I'll try her again, thanks for the advice
---
Do you have a link for them?
---
Me, a Rank 13: hooks all 3 rank 9’s in the basement and Mori’d their rank 3 friend
---
Rank 3: why did you camp me on the hook
---
Me: I Mori’d you...
---
BABY KILLER lol haha dud 
---
That is the vibe I’m getting.
---
I can't even play rn. The update (not surprisingly) fucked up the game.
---
They could get endurance for like 15 seconds or whatever
---
That clown skeletal/jack o lantern look is perfection. Great choices
---
Freddy. His power is more superior than demo. He has massive map pressure as well.
---
That's what I've been hearing, seems to be different for console. No idea why though
---
No but you can just sort by hot and see the post about it if you want, I can try to link it tho
---
Solid killer who is fun to play as and play against
---
Break line of sight as much as possible, smash gens quickly and gtfo.
---
Oh shit is the new event today? I thought they were just leaks lol
---
Nope, even with that dbd isn't the same game as f13. I don't understand your sophistry.
---
I'd argue that the most precise term is "stupid dick".
---
IM LAUGHING SO HARD
---
No counters, other then iron will, not fun to play against, 
---
To play as, very easy and satisfying being so overwhelmingly powerful.
---
I would love to watch a level 1 killer play
---
Pretty sure he’s swf. You hit him or his friend. They heal each other. Cycle just continuous and everyone gets points I believe.
---
Hold ps home button to bring up quick menu, go to Dead by Daylight, go to ‘players in session’ or something like that and you can see all the players you’re playing with if they’re appearing online.
---
The killer. Permanent exposed, and insta kill on down. There was literally no hope when he finished stalking all the randoms.
---
when you hold down the ps4 home button a side menu will pop up and it'll have something that says "currently playing with" and it shows everyone's gamer tag that is currently in the game with you, thats how they messaged you
---
Doc would be an A tier killer if his decoys could walk
---
Hell fucking yase
---
Recently played, they just remebered the survivors names. Not everything is hacks
---
They probably have a “recently played” list that updates when you get in the lobby 
---
If it is a hack, it’s probably the most innocent hack anyone has used in dbd
---
You are an evil man
---
Very very strong.
---
Hard to learn to play as.
---
Insanely fun to play against, most of the time.
---
One of the few killers that can make me actually scared.
---
what am i seeing
---
"Servant of the serum" i love it
---
&gt; From experience, most SWF dont even take the game hella seriously and just play.
---
This is my experience as well. But if a 4 man *wants* to win, they're going to win and the killer can't stop it. But most people do play more casually in their SWF instead
---
Connection issues mainly. I couldn’t hook up with my crew. It would tell me failure, then put me in the lobby, find a match then kick us back and repeat. It did this like eight times in a row, took forever. Randomly kick me out or someone in our group. And to top it all off my Xbox crashes at the offering screen if I don’t move the stick around on my controller...don’t know why. Makes me have to start completely over. Oh the list goes on...
---
So are you saying you wanna talk about feelings?
---
Since, you know, if they tell you more about the game and discuss how a certain idea is wrong because of x y or z, i Would call it discussion
---
So if you just say "they just wanna show of their knowledge and flex about it" while not accepting those facts, you're talking about feelings and I don't honestly care about them in a discussion
---
No I replaced the icons with custom galaxy themed ones. It's hard to tell in this clip though
---
The Nancy’s ranks
---
A million times this, one of the most underrated youtubers around. Has great vids on every single killer along with good builds to run regardless of wich perks you have unlocked.
---
For sure but I don't think we need more killers with confusing or to strong abilities
---
Play w y Food
---
M&amp;A
---
Ruin
---
These are the most important three. They slow the game down, they help you get stalk and helpnyou get speed.
---
Other good stuff:
---
ANY info perk: discordance, surveillance, rancor, ... maybe even spies in the shadow. maybe even "I'm all ears" gf perk... 
---
Maybe Thrill of the Hunt, since it helps you defend the totem. But let's be honest: you're to slow to actually defend it.
---
ANY game slow down perk, that doesn't require you hitting people: "corrupt infedtation" or whatever thingy from Plague... blocks 3 gens. That thingy. Maybe Overcharge.
---
what about it
---
I absolutely hate the spirit both playing as her and playing against her, I just don't find her fun at all
---
Strong af, but not too much that you cannot counter her.
---
With all the meme posts that's how long it takes when I'm going through 3 posts/second.
---
Jesus that Spirit skin tho...
---
10/10 fucking terrifying, I love it
---
69...
---
During rank reset when me and my friends are playing together we usually run no mither since it seems like 4 out of five games are with a killer who actually needs to rank up. That way we don’t need to play super serious and because of that, everyone including the killer has more fun.
---
Cosmetics are hardly content, I'd see where you're coming from if it was something that actually affected the game
---
game lore? because in the show hes been out in light/day
---
he sent me screenshot and this was it. didnt know about that.
---
1 killer per match?
---
She’s one of the few balanced killers that you need skill to counter and who can apply pressure.
---
I remember when I used the scratched mirror for the first time and got accused of hacking. It's really funny to see what survivors are really doing when they think you cant see them.
---
sent me screenshot and this was it. didnt know about that.at
---
When can we finally get a skin for my bubby? Guess I gotta keep showing those sexy abs
---
You mean the killer who has to stalk 3 whole survivors, is slower than usual, and is countered by hopping into a locker? (Tombstone cannot mori downed survivors. If you hop into a locker, he has to hook you or let you go to attempt to tombstone you again). And he has to get close to you to actually tombstone you, which gives plenty of time to find a locker and take a hook instead of a mori. Not gonna lie, against good survivors, that addon pair is terrible.
---
Kramer was justified in certain students though, at least to himself. He had rehabilitated Amanda. Through a test she gave up on her nonsensical ways. The issue is he was a stable mind and when the responsibility switched to her, she couldn't keep up.
---
Yep, still the same as far as damage and pallet destruction.
---
Whaaa new spirit skin?
---
&gt; Still typically do pretty well by taking advantage of their altruism
---
So I also agree with the original commenters experience, but this? Nah. And I don't know why this idea is so pervasive. This is pretty much the only video game I play and I'm a killer main so I have a fucking load of time in the game. SWFs are not overly altruistic; they're incredibly optimal with their saves
---
Killer gets less points overall though as opposed to if they get the hook I believe.
---
I always see everyone run dead hard. Feel like I’m one of the only people in existence to hate that perk.
---
because thats still a thing
---
^true
---
I had some painful experiences lol
---
Hallowed blight 2019
---
I abused the moon walk trick for legion back when they were released and didn't know how broken and unfair it was.
---
I'm Sorry.
---
It’s about fucking time Jake got a good cosmetic. Not saying the ones he got are shit (loved his carnival cosmetic), just not for me, ya know?
---
I’ll take you up on that
---
Aftercare has tiers? I never knew that
---
The doctor does have this power with an add on sort of
---
In a chase you can make it seem like doc is right behind you, having you make rash decisions
---
Someone did an Oopsi
---
i am dumb, have a good day.
---
Thank you. I didnt announce my age as a way of bragging so to say. I tend to be very insecure about my art and generally just want to let people know I'm young and still have a lot to learn. I'll keep that in mind.
---
I expose Ghost easily 90 percent of the time. I can count the instances I've actually been fully stalked by him on one hand
---
So that was a fuckin lie
---
He followed the rules out of respect. Amanda made a mockery of John's teachings. It wasn't through blackmail, that was just an add to the story. There was a lot that he didnt have to do to carry on the name.
---
Why are my team mates always incompetent?
---
Pumpkin Clown be vibin tho
---
&gt;And of course match making is at an all time low.
---
Right now I just assume there is a 10 rank difference between the killer and the highest or lowest survivor. I'm usually right.
---
Mondo is in a butter place
---
Hello. It's me.
---
U care too much lol grow some balls and just DO WHAT U WANT
---
I've stopped running it too since all the killers know how to counter it anyway above rank 5. Thought about running balanced next but idk not a fan of that perk either
---
Are you delusional, do you suffer from a mental illness?
---
Very nice! Do some more!
---
No HE is killer and a survivor messaged him
---
I hope they fix the hair for female survivors bc sometimes when in animation theyll have a shaved head. Not that I'm complaining sometimes bald Nancy is kinda cute.
---
i have so many ppl do this and it's just like oh yeah, let me give up my kill real quick
---
&gt; you respond da
---
Ain't you doing the same thing too? Whose the troll 🙃
---
What's your 4th perk? Boil over?
---
Nice shots!
---
Thanks for the reply. I do think running either enduring or brutal strength would help with pallet mains, so I'm gonna try to work towards getting those teachables (if they aren't in shrine tonight)
---
Watch 'not Otzdava' on youtube. He makes great plays and doesn't even use meta perks most of the time. Only prestiged ghostface 3 times because of him
---
I love balanced just for the passive ability while you’re on cool down. I usually switch between lithe and balanced.
---
I think gje devs said that rins dad was influenced by the enity and it wanted him but it took run once it realized her desire for vengeance was high.
---
Ironically Rin now serves the beIN responsible for her current situation.
---
That bitch had rancor AND NOED? 
---
Wow
---
Far too powerful. Especially with prayer beads. Spirit is so powerful that even in the hands of a potato killer like me, I can effortlessly 4K and get a perfect game against survivors that are far better than me. She takes virtually no skill, and has little counter play,
---
Hey bud, I believe in you to get better
---
Adrenaline
---
When they had that damn interview... it is so weird how after all the insane shit that is my second most memorable scene. After the angel scene.
---
More jpeg please yes
---
Agreed
---
Elemefayoo
---
You didnt miss anything special. Game was to broken to even enjoy it. Now halloween event is coming up and if its not fixed by then, Ill probably just skip it and play a different game like civilization for a few months
---
No?
---
I'm going to be a little sad if it's only 1 survivor, I really like the Hallowed Blight skins and seeing as Dwight/Claud got their's last time I was hoping another 2 survivors.
---
I'm fast AF boyyy
---
Wake up buddy, it's October
---
My build is always a sweaty meta build. I like ruining all survivor's day, but I make it more unfun for streamers.
---
Then Freddy Appears Behind you...
---
Literally makes your game twice as hard
---
But it gives you a superpower!!!!!!!
---
.... that any killer with IQ above 50 can counter.
---
Sooo.... 
---
Only exception: combining No Mither with a Sabo Build. Then you're suddenly .... B tier. Maybe if 4man SWF doing no mither+sabo ... A tier, if dome perfectly. But there are many many better options to play.
---
It’s effects are random, but that’s one of the things. There’s a whole list
---
The phantoms will appear longer is another one
---
Because it was leaked that you can buy it with a new currency. Check out the LeaksbyDaylight if you don’t believe me.
---
Yes he's lethal and probably the most fun killer in the game have fun and enjoy him.
---
Then don't get injured in the first place?
---
Charles LeBubba
---
"Outplayed."
---
I cant remember wtf that perk even does
---
Spirit yasss queen

That’s ‘exactly’ what you said, then you went back and edited your previous comment so it wouldn’t look like you said it.
---
Thats a dc
---
I have witnessed rituals disappear or be replaced. I had one for survivor chase 140 seconds and when I checked progress it was now Cannibal
---
It's even funnier when they do it right in front of you like they think you have to swing and miss or cancel your frenzy
---
This is new guys, he has the shadow people in the back which was added recently.
---
No distortion user would want to waste their 3 charges on killer instinct 😂
---
This guys a crackhead
---
It's new
---
Naw, new perk for any killer, press a certain button to send a clone, totally balanced 100%
---
Ah, got it, but still not sure if we can buy 3 out of 5. Pretty sure it will be 2 this year, if devs are not super generous of course
---
He's easily one of the scariest killers in this game. Not to mention MFer can mori in the first 3 min of the game under the right circumstances.
---
1) broken. Always injured. No heaöthy state.
---
2) unbreakable deluxe. You can always heal from slugged to injured.
---
= but everyone sees that you start broken. Everyone knows "oh okay. He can stand up again."
---
So yeah. 
---
F tier Perk.
---
I'm honestly more annoyed by that than prayer beads
---
Yep he is quite the mediorce killer in my opinion great chase potential but shit everywhere else. I do love him though and I hope they buff him
---
Bring the fucking V12’s back
---
so is your obnoxious attitude
---
Because it's not like they might be trying to hide somewhere (cringe emoji here)
---
Why are you so mad? OP is all calm and just posted a good game of his and you're bringing unnecessary arguments here, sod off
---
No love for the Nurse :(
---
kind of depends.  sometimes you can wind up with 2+ kills when you do, but that's also sort of assuming that the hook isn't close to the gates.
---
Normal PS4 menu option as stated above, I send messages to killers all the time. I didn’t know how to do that until a friend of mine told me a year ago.
---
To be fair I forgot that I didn't have to cancel my frenzy once, do that start worked at least once.
---
Also, in out it is immensely easy to get more than 1 killer, as there’s at least 3 seconds after everyone is ready where you can switch to spectator and killer
---
What on earth are you talking about. I just said some god came along with his infinite knowledge and talked about it already
---
No, it would be corny and generic.
---
A JoJo meme, which is where all the ZA WARUDO memes come from
---
"I don't think anyone expects you to leave the hook, because thats just throwing the game" Oof man, you do not know this community. I've had people call me garbarge and shit because I used LF chainsaw. Like, how dare I use his power. There are FULLY people who feel this way.
---
Is he crying?
---
Yes he is. Are you good with Shape? That's the question.
---
Give 1 upvote, get 45. 
---
This has been the best trade deal, in the history of trade deals, maybe ever
---
I dont know what they expect when hitting them actually helps them out the gate faster. what an absurd mechanic.
---
Clown is a tad bit boring to play, but that’s just my opinion

I wish I made his hair as Thicc as his scoops.
---
I didn’t say they were overly altruistic. But you have to try to take advantage of the times that you’re around and they try to save or heal. That’s what I mean. Not hang out and wait for them to come save that just gets you gen rushed.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna need a minute to process this in my mind.
---
Red moss is 10 seconds and I think when combined with the purple equivalent it is extended to 16 seconds.

Red Moss basically gives you Tinkerer every time you teleport

---
Wow that's actually pointless with everyone seeing you injured. Maybe if the killer saw you as fully healed it would be a little useful but even then the killer would realize after downing you immediately
---
The only way it could be new is if they had every perk in the game on Laurie at tier 3, or the ring was somewhere on there. It's easy to fake, say that it is new when you haven't touched that character in a while.
---
What an ignorant bliss to think that spirit actually takes any skill to play.
---
50$ on the Mexican
---
I'm surprised to see so many people looking back fondly on the Hallowed Blight event. I could have sworn this sub was bitching a ton about it back when it happened, and in my experience I couldn't wait for it to end because of the shitshow that it was. But I am glad people did enjoy it, I give props to BHVR for trying something new, it just didn't stick for me.
---
Okay, then you've had some sort of error on your side of things in that case.
---
I'm still hoping that one day we'll hear "for those who purchased Ghost Face, introducing Sydney Prescott!"
---
I can dream.
---
Yeah its always super satisfying to have like 1 or 2 teammates on hook at the end and then you and your other teammate just sit at the exit and have a "lets do this" moment, work together and sweat it out and escape with 4
---
Hag, Clown, and Spirit all have terrifying faces. If they translate well to in-game models, I'll be eager to grind for those skins.
---
That’s edited in I believe
---
no They're bleeding i think? i really don't know the never said what the "nectar" actually is
---
Oh my god. I never thought of that.
---
There’s no perks, it’s fake
---
Just to make it simple so you dont get confused again. I asked why rancor wasnt a hex. Toybasher came along and told me why and helped me understand. The end
---
Well we've now confirmed its happening again, the leftover pustula petals in game have had their text changed.
---
Yeah, rank 6 Freddy here. If you kill survivors too fast just let the last guy alive unhook then just repeatedly kill them until you feel satisfied. It's sounds scummy but pipping as killer is stupid and it's just how it is.
---
It was with LF if I'm remembering right but people speculated that she was going to be Nancy after LF launched with no survivor and nobody had found Quentin's files.
---
Facts
---
On my end?! It happened after I did their update and their game tells me the version isnt available. How is that a problem on my end? Lol. Nvm. I'm gonna delete the game and re-install.
---
This would have been part 2, but I forgot to record the first part which was the issue of Skill Check RNG chances with Ruin up.
---
Hahaha, that's priceless!
---
Vigil in it of itself isn't a BAD perk, being able to recover from 5 status effects all at once 20% faster is good on paper. The problem comes in due to the fact that these aren't useful DURING chases. If it were, then it would be used more or possibly meta. IE: Exhaustion doesn't recover while running.
---
Which means he took the picture when they were added, but that doesn’t prove it is new
---
I never edited any of my comments, otherwise it would say (edited) on my comment or have a little * on it if you use reddit sync wtf
---
Assuming the two who take a hit don't get hit a second time, because he just has to down one of them and then the whole thing repeats, the time keeps ticking down, and the number of hooks left to the blockers goes down as well.
---
What are some good patrol method for killers? I have a hard time finding survivers.
---
It says somewhere if a survivor is near by like 16 meters you wont lose points
---
I get into a lobby, sit there for 5-10 mins, it kicks me. Happened 4 times.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Not only that but no generators ever got done because everyone did the serum. Like I legit went hours without a single generator being finished.
---
Wow! Just... Wow!
---
Thank you. I get quite a few messages about camping after the game and after asking what reason is their for me to leave the hook after the gates are opened I never get an actual answer other than being called trash.
---
I can agree with this. I become angry when it's me but whenever I try to save just...oh god. Let's just say it don't go so well
---
Once the exit gates are open, are bets are off. Anyone that believes otherwise needs to re-evaluate how they play this game or uninstall altogether.
---
As a survivor main, when this happens. I make a choice. Do I risk going back into save my teammate or do I leave. 9/10 I will risk the save and so do most players. However in that rare chance NOED is active, I'm probably going to leave if there's no option to get a teammate off the hook.
---
Regardless, it's not the killers job to walk away from the hook knowing people are still in the match who will try to save them.
---
Thank you. I’m trying to find the evidence so I know I’m not crazy, but based off of pure experience it’s worked that way.
---
Well it doesn’t look like everyone was the same rank to begin with, and if the two lower ranks went out quickly (judging on their scores), then the other two were only a matter of time. 
---
Or he could have started off pretending to be friendly and then turned on them for a 4K. I’ve seen a killer do that before. It could also explain the incredibly angry message.
---
Ah! Why didn’t *I* think of that before!
---
I once mained Laurie before my progress got deleted and then turned into a copy of my friends save data. This hurts
---
Wasn't it Amanda who made inescapable traps?
---
See also: instaheal isn't toxic, it's literally just a mechanic in the damn game.
---
Ya now he gets to ruin a game for 4 other unlucky survivors.
---
Man, this sucks. I just had to work the entire bloodhunt weekend (12 hr shifts, only time to sleep and work) so I missed all of that, now I'll be working that whole weekend again and missing out on the event. Sad.

Literally. I only don’t play her, even though I have her level 40 with most good perks, because it’s not fun. But Billy...
---
***ZOOOOOOOOOOOOM***
---
Never seen such toxic dwights
---
What? I was joking the whole time. I never run NOED, and I don’t even have Rancor unlocked. The fuck are you talking about?
---
Depends if u have good headphones
---
Don't care about what others thin. Play what you want, how you want, as long as it doens't break the rules.
---
I've only played him once. The killer was pretty good, so we lost, but I cant go off of just 1 game.
---
Android police Urhhh 😷😷😷😷
---
Nice painting but why does age need to be mentioned ? Just curious
---
Yup. Killer main, totally agree.
---
There's no such thing as a toxic perk, killer or survivor side.
---
If you're being a teabaggy turd at the exit gate, a flashlight clicking douche, or facecamping a survivor without cause... that's when you become a problem.
---
I was getting into games pretty quick as killer on Xbox.
---
For real like perks aren’t toxic it’s how u use them
---
Well guess I can't put off leveling up my clown to get his teachables anymore with a skin that good.
---
Fucking red ping and ping spikes. Yesterday I got hit AFTER I've already vaulted over a window. Like my two feet were on the ground and I was good few inches from the window, but still got hit. Lol. I was pretty pissed.
---
No legion :(:(:(:(:(
---
You are joking right? I've managed to get the killers attention while they chase someone, letting them live. I've had killers chase me to try and get a hit while carrying someone, which resulted in them dropping someone. I've clicked my flashlight while being chased because I know it will make some killers want to keep chasing me just that much more, while my team tht might not be as good at looping focus on gens. Yes I do it to get under your skin, and you saying I'm a toxic asshole just confirms in my mind that it works.
---
Whoever decided that giving a killer an instakill as an add on needs to jump off of a high object without balanced landing.
---
My mandatory perk is Borrowed Time. The amount of clutch games I have saved survivors from NOED is astonishing. Or basement camping bubbas; Will not play survivor without it.   
---
As for Killer its a more loaded question, however to simplify, I would say RUIN since most of the killers I play are not Top 5 killers.
---
So 1. just because a lot of people here say that doesn't mean you should jump to conclusions. 2. Didn't realize you were the editor-in-chief of my comments. I'll be sure to send them to you first to make sure you approve of what I'm saying. 3. Here's clarification of my point on how you can punish "optimal" SWF altruism. When you hook and see somebody immediately, they are baiting you into a chase. Start the chase and then instantly turn back around and I'll bet you down the unhooker. They don't have to be overly altruistic and divebomb the hook for you to punish them. But I'm sure with all your time played as a killer main you'll already know this but you'll continue to complain about SWF bc you can't counterplay them.
---
When I was still learning to play, playing aginst The Doctor was my absolute nightmare. Especially running Overcharge and Unnerving Presence.
---
Patrol gens and your hex totems if you have them
---
I tend to be really insecure about my art (took me alot of time and convincing to post this ) so I kinda thought to put my age as a way to say that I'm young and have a lot to learn. It wasn't meant as bragging or anything of the like.

No problem! Not sure how shipping works, as I have a physical location at the mall for this store. Unsure if they do international shipments outside of the US.
---
This video was the embodiment of that Jimny Neutron meme:
---
"THIS is me 360ing!"
---
"Vibez, this is the 7th video in a row you've shown you 360ing on YouTube".
---
You could've sprinkled in the more varied gameplay.
---
Yeah, getting rid of the timer but keeping the ground and dings could be fun, like you'd still get clear cues that its coming and roughly how soon, but then you'll still get the tense suspense of if you'll make it or not.
---
Even more simply put: gens left = number of survivors dead

Ha ha ha! Oh wow, this is the first time I've seen this meme posted!

this is top notch! I'm glad this meme wasn't be posted 62 times in the past month!

 that sure wouldn't make it funny! Ha ha Ha! good thing that didn't happen!

very cool meme! thank you!

High rank spirits are scary on Console
---
He just went through the upside down obviously
---
Honestly if anyone was going to have this ability in DBD it would be Jason, but ya know FT13 The Game is a thing.
---
I am going to cop the fuck out of that spirit skin
---
Do they do double BP on Halloween? Well if so Halloween is a holiday exception to their usual plans. You know as well as I do that Double BP Events are super short and spaced too far apart. I don't think anyone argues that we have too many BP Events and that they last too long...
---
I mean, she does have a physical body within the realms of the entity
---
Even his chase power isn't that good je obl has 4 bottles which takes forever to reload and he moves slower when throwing them which defeats the whole purpose of it
---
That's why I suggest give it to Myers since he does it too
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah it just takes time and practice. Even afte 400is hours, still can't hit Great every time. But the two things that I believe helped me were 1: I hotkeyed the skillcheck button, which is default Spacebar, to "E". Got it from a streamer I watch. I find it easier to hit that with an E since it's right next to my WASD. Another thing is I came up on my own, I try to imagine hitting my "E" when the little pointer thing is before Great skillcheck zone, the white portion. Meaning, when you "think" that indicator is about to hit the white zone, press your button. This probably varies because I like to think that my reflex is a bit slow so I hit my key when I "see" that indicator is about to hit the white zone to get a Great skillcheck. Hope this helps.
---
Mad Grit + Agitation + Iron Grasp = Taxicab demo
---
Wow I guess the filters really doesn't work..
---
Oh wait, they work
---
I really want the devs to start adding cosmetic options for killer VFX and stuff. It would be awesome if we could change the visuals of Plague’s vomit, Clown’s gas, Hag’s traps, Freddy’s pools, stuff like that. It would add a ton of cool new cosmetic options and we’d actually be able to see it because currently we can only see our hands and weapons.
---
As a killer main myself I love the idea of this perk. It rewards you with a save but at a major cost of perma broken making it easier for the killer to get you next time. Its a very high risk high reward style perk. The only concern I would have would its effectiveness at end game a good team all saving this for EGC would be devastating! Otherwise I really like it.
---
Y i K e S
---
Yep, I’ve experienced this a few times, the only way I’ve been able to fix it is restart the game.
---
How about you fix killers being able to crash the game on purpose for all players on Xbox.
---
this has been happening to me a LOT, like ill go hours without being able to get in a game because this just happens over and over again. literally fucking unplayable
---
I guess I didn't like the RPG style of it. For me, god of war is a hack and slash where killing enemies is either easy or you have to get a few special attacks, like pulling their wings off (except bosses, they should be long and hard). All enemies just felt too tough and healthy and you can't juggle them as much
---
She’s basically the same on both console and PC.
---
Her left thigh is kinda, I mean really small compared to her right thigh but otherwise good job
---
I’m disappointed, it literally looks like her regular skin but she has no hair lmao
---
i know someone made a perfect loop of this video, but i can find it anymore
---
Sometimes I DC as survivor if I'm pissed off and got tunneled to my final hook anyway... it's not like that 3k points I would've gotten are going to help much, and I was already gonna die anyway.
---
But it fucking sucks when killers DC.
---
My friend unironically runs this and it works to much for me to laugh at him anymore...
---
Thats a why you always leave one obvious totem and break the rest. If you dont find all totems theres still a chance that it spawns on the obvious one
---
shut up meg
---
Aren’t u supposed to be carrying me smh
---
When the survivors spam flashlight at you and T-bag after dropping a pellet on you. Usually you can tell when they are trying to BM on purpose.
---
Wait, rank 9 and they’re not even picking their own perks? Survivors these days...
---
New Halloween skins and content probably being added this patch.
---
Omg we didn't know, we're still noobs I guess 😂
---
NOED gamers still lose by only getting one kill either way.
---
Don't forget about gonorotors

It's unlimited - Myers drains Stalk from survivors to give himself "double damage", Ghostface generates Stalk on survivors so that they get Exposed.
---
Confusing times in the fog
---
I was interested in thsi game because of how unique and refreshing it sounded. Let's just say I still play this game after 400 hours on PC.
---
Yeah I think there was jusg a big missunderstanding going on here from both of us haha :D
---
Not in new.
---
I always try to explain this, but it seems that this game has not a single survivor main that has a functional, healthy brain. It sucks man
---
I wanna buy and play Spirit, but I’m afraid one of my parents or siblings will walk into my room and think that I’m playing some kind of porn game.
---
&gt; You're against logic.
---
oh sorry i didnt know
---
cry more
---
Yes. When Bill came to console, all his perks became teachables.
---
If you look at the "more details" screen ingame you should be able to see which of his teachables have been unlocked (works for any character).
---
I wanna a killer that fully morphs into looking like one of the other survivors in the trial.  Then you can do gens with other survivors, open up the exit gates, and then slip out so no one is the wiser.
---
i tried but u just sprint bursted away
---
I’m surprised it got that many downvotes I guess some people didn’t like the joke
---
Them heartbeats be scary man!!
---
I hate these kind of comments. Yes, Iron Will can counter Spirit and yes, Spine Chill can too. But no, a killer is not balanced if you are forced to use specific perks to counter him. The game should promote different playstyles with equal chances to win (with your skill and knowledge, and not by the perks to are using). Plus, you won't know if you will face a spirit and yes, I know Iron Will helps with any killer but I like to change builds from game to game.
---
Are you using at least one tracking perk? Do you have a preferred killer? Techniques will vary depending on the killer and the perks you have access to.
---
They just mix it with ectoplasm
---
Some do. Including me especially Decisive Strike but we shouldn't get mad. I mean I won't say I get mad but I get frustrated because that could completely throw off the game I was winning. They shouldn't get mad. If they do, fuck them. Use whatever you want, play however you want. It's bullshit that people get mad for using perks that's in the game.
---
Never encountered infinite loading but have had this. So good chance nothing is fixed
---
I had a dream about this once and have loved the idea since. My dream was a killer who sent sent out avatars that looked like survivors. They could directly affect the  real survivors but could be used as scouts, decoys, etc. Not sure how well it would work, but in my dream a survivor led me straight to the killer before vanishing and the feeling of betrayal was pretty awesome.
---
better Q&amp;Q into a locker, trust me they won't see the scratch marks, youre too fast to leave em
---
I’d say it’s a little more like no mither
---
Smack in the middle of prime time, when the "audience" is at its peak.
---
If you're on PC then you can kind of track this in Steam - if you're on console then use the Steam numbers for your region as a "best guess".
---
For perks just run the standard meta build(if you don't got any teachables run Sloppy butcher,Whispers,NOED and some other perk idk) BBQ&amp;C,Ruin,Enduring and spirit Fury(or if you're feeling spicy Make your choice) for tips for keeping your portals up honestly just hope for the best I can't really think of anything besides placing them out of noise range. Honestly I wouldn't recommend Demogorgon for baby killers as he's kinda complicated and hard to use
---
Oh I agree but console especially you see that quite often high ranks since the frames suck ass on console
---
This looks like you  used the spray tool on MS paint
---
Doesn't even have iron will that guy needs to plug in some headphones
---
I like the gassy boi’s skin.
---
Oh nah man im not an asshole, we played the round normally [here is him complaining that I started slugging them after their unhooks](https://imgur.com/gallery/O40a0T3) if that proves anything
---
Tbh i thought he would be similar to hag in certain ways, but yeah i get what you mean.
---
r/angryupvote
---
You right. I always notice anatomy mistakes after I post it lol
---
I love when survs do this bc I know to save them for last - they want to loop instead of gens and the ones that are doing gens are the ones I need to disrupt/kill and are likely worse at looping.
---
How do you miss these? Are you listening for skill check sound? are you experiencing input lag?
---
You just need to cleanse the 4 totems and noed is gone and if you did tour job and died at end you will still rank up btw
---
thank god someone posted it in proper quality without the obnoxious "LEAKSBYDAYLIGHT" watermark taking up the entire image
---
So.. a build that is pretty much useless, since he has to stalk for ages, at that time 4/5 gens are done and he's slow af. Without even counting that he will probably depip after that
---
Did you ever played that yourself before? I guess not seeing your bitchy comments and lack of arguments except "it's unfair because I FEEL like it"
---
The P3 Claudette flair makes this even funnier
---
Oh, yeah but it’s very easy to notice it
---
Nurse rework is looking spooky
---
that doesnt change the fact that this shit shouldn't be happening.
---
They should just combine borrowed time and MOM into Borrowed Mettle, which in addition to giving the effects of Borrowed Time, gives you borrowed time when your unhooked by someone without borrowed time
---
Still the survivor technically played with him so he would appear in recent players. Its all just remembering survivor usernames and measaging the one you don’t see (killer)
---
I mean it’s kinda accurate to how demo is in season 1
---
I'm down
---
That’s funny. I use the exact same perk build for Ghostface.
---
I like Lery's best, it has a very immersive atmosphere and is beautiful to look at.
---
Ormond also gives a sense of presence with how believable the bleak wintry sky is.
---
Pure skill 100%
---
Im just even more lucky that the hatch spawned there, is it me or does the hatch spawn there alot on this map
---
An average spirit is truly overrated. They may make it to purple ranks, sure. That is spirit. But at red ranks it all changes. Iron Will is a popular perk, along with spine chill, along with a few more. If you want tips to play against spirit I can give you a few.
---
Effectively, you don't use dh to "dodge" killer attacks outright. It's best used to get the extra safe distance to a pallet or a window and extend a chase.
---
I had the same thing happen a few days ago. Today I'm having problems with getting in lobbies that never fill up. Sigh...
---
Then pick two of these: Enduring, Spirit fury, Make your choice, Sloppy butcher, Nurse's calling
---
I noticed the sound a bit later, but I think it's a bit of input lag, slow reflexes and trying to hear the heartbeat sound of the killer at the same time
---
Lmao I painted this in an art class I had and was hella stressed that would happen
---
Why do you have M&amp;A on Spirit lol? Im just curious
---
Holy fucking spirit!
---
Totally my friend code is
---
SW-2869-1872-0976
---
Not sure if you had any ideas in terms of chatting?
---
that's a shame, having new objectives for survivors made the game seem a lot more balanced for many killers since it helped witht he gen rush issue.
---
Who is the Otzdarva of Survivor streamers?
---
In game it doesn’t say Bubba i think
---
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT'S TRIAL TIME!
---
O shi
---
Haha asians /s
---
I took him to level 45 in 2 days because I loved playing him so much he's a very fun killer
---
Yea so did until I played him then i realized the demogorgon has a completely unique playstyle and you can't play him like Hag
---
Interesting mine was 600mb. It seems like something went wrong with your previous updates and decided to reinstall them
---
Try waiting until the 14th of this month for the rank reset. You’ll be placed against easier survivors and you can earn them then.
---
im with you. i really wish there was at least 2 like last event. i mean as killer you dont even get to see your skin so i have very few despite mostly being a killer main lol.
---
I'm not really sure, I'll add you in a couple of hours.
---
&gt;All these killer mains are making it sound like he’s the victim when he literally just has to watch you for half the game
---
Half of the game which means around 2 a d a half minutes which is unlikely. He has to stalk a lot, almost all 4 fully. He is slow af and have to find you. You lost 3 times, stealth, not being stalked and chase
---
Just because someone thinks your thoughts are dumb doesn't mean they main one role like you, since you clearly never played Myer nor with those add ons.
---
&gt;then when he catches you once he doesn’t even down you he immediately kills you
---
After the game is almost over..
---
Portable and docked. Been playing since it's inception and it's definitely not at it's worst on the Switch
---
If you plan on playing and using only one character's perks or the base blood web perks (I use Meg's perks on Meg and Decisive which I picked up from the shrine) then picking up your teachables doesn't quite matter as much, but I still would spend the BP to get them out of the way or if I, say, decided to pick up Nea for BL, I could use Meg's perks on her.
---
I would say the final decision is up to you, but if you don't want a specific perk because you know you will never use it, I wouldn't waste the BP to get it.
---
it was satire
---
I mean yeah everyone uses BBQ, at least for the points. But that alone won’t really win you a game. Gotta use corrupt intervention
---
Agreed, this will refresh the game for veterans like me.
---
That spirit skin is making me sweaty..
---
I suppose that's one way of admitting you last the argument.
---
It’s been happening since last patch (the one before today’s hotfix) and the unknown error as well
---
I really thought they fixed these but nope :(
---
Every time I use scratched mirror, everyone disconnects and I try to give the last guy the hatch but he ends up disconnecting as well :(
---
As a survivor I agree, but as a recent Pig convert I highly disagree. Lol
---
Legion*
---
The spirit looks like a spitter
---
Nope, absolutely not. THE worst killer in the game, even Claudette can get more kills them him, like, only ONE person has ever gotten a 4k within the 2 years he's been out
---
FUCK yeah he's good
---
Haha you making her thick than do it correctly 😎😂
---
That bottom text is too long
---
When you get face camped,
---
Because you were the only one downed
---
Works better
---
Itll take time but ill get used to the playstyle (hopefully)
---
But it's not meta so not many people are using it. When Sprint burst was meta it made all M1 killers worse because of the initial safety net and all chases took far much less skill and longer to complete. Iron will is not going to be meta.
---
I always wanted to try that comby out but I always have so many other perks I wanna run instead that I never find a time where I can put it in haha :D
---
With all that removed it sounds pretty good for a 1 time save. The major trade off specifically sells me on it. That and the fact that it suits David quite well.
---
Not her fault most of the people maining her are complete fuckheads.
---
As a survivor main, this is the only time I forgive camping or anything else related to it. You’re securing your kill. The logic behind your statement makes absolutely sense. Sometimes I go for a survivor and it all works out. Sometimes I die and the killer gets a 2-4K. High risk, high reward.
---
Not to my knowledge, no. It really works the reverse of how you assume it would, but w/e.
---
I was trying a style where I use the phase walk a little less for chases and just for getting around
---
Plus I was a bit fresh on her too
---
Imma eat that spirit cosmetic
---
I’m sorry what’s a pallet?
---
Nice. I was curious on how they looked in game so having this helps a bunch also I swear weren't you the guy that managed to get Ghostfaces animations early and all the demogorgon,Steve and Nancy cosmetics in the game?
---
Exactly just what happened to my last purple flashlight with a battery and filament 
---
Welp mayb time to take a piece out of aces book and get lucky next time
---
Is sloppy butcher a killer specific perk?
---
Yup Im that same guy :)
---
Clown looks good, but not as good as Santa Clown so....
---
That’s a great drawing
---
I thought my Jake cosmetics were perfect. That All the stealth, all the hair, everything was perfect. I see now my mistakes.
---
That's the idea.
---
Apparently, according to devs, even death escapes the entity.  Everyone is still alive in the Realm, so long as they were plucked right before death.
---
That’s why you give her a stronger decisive strike ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yes it always happens at the end of the game after I had survived and had a ritual to escape with bill and I never got it because of this
---
I (19y/o) upvoted!
---
It's not scummy. I tell you what is scummy tho, dumpstering survivors and not being rewarded because you did it too fast.
---
Well, we can remove them together with Moris.
---
Mmmm ad hominem
---
His deep wounds kept going down bc he was in freddys dream
---
You can earn the achievement if your score is high enough even if 1 survivor escapes, too
---
I legit spent a full game on badham tossing all the mans dream pallets yesterday with it.  I could feel his pain.  He basically just got to use the teleport portion of his power.
---
Shaggy is ghostface :)
---
Been totally down for that forever. Keep them on perks like Devour Hope and addons like Tombstone, or make Cypress basekit and you have a deal.
---
Very original. Never seen before.
---
Never pick up a recently unhooked Laurie. EZ PZ
---
Pwyf underrated on most killers
---
I like the Hawkins Lab, slowly learning the totem locations... So it's becoming more bearable as time goes on.
---
I LOVE the Chapel and Mt Ormond though, both reasonable sizes, one has our pet horse, lots of drops, both have a nice indoor location. Both seem fairly balanced for both sides imo.
---
Maybe when you M1 a survivor, you acquire their skin for your decoy?  Then you can run around as survivor, and you can teleport to that location (with some animation like the Alien baby popping out of your chest or something) and it's on a delay.  Not sure how helpful that would be compared to just being Pig or Ghostface, tho.  
---
I feel like there are way more thematically interesting than mechanically interesting options for killer powers.
---
oh god you're one of those neckbeards who thinks logical fallacies meant for formal debates matter in informal internet arguments
---
oh my god that's hilarious 
---
I have bad news: me making fun of you for being an illiterate moron has nothing to do with you misreading me pointing out that SWFs are capable of optimal saves in a way that solo isn't as me complaining about SWf
---
so so sad
---
Honestly some survivor Maine actually come of with shit reasons just to fill the hole in their heart that's pip shaped.. then again.. only some not all.
---
Ugh, not another hallowed blight event.
---
The second perk is Monitor and Abuse and the third perk is Bloodhound.
---
I hope not
---
Wtf I see it now, never happened to me while playing Freddy
---
Microsoft pays them to be on the game pass. You say this game is bad, yet you read the patch notes and are on the subreddit for the game?
---
I'm starting to lean towards the under 14 theory considering you haven't brought up one single point other than "YoU'rE dUmB" or "YoU'rE dRuNk"
---
Just avoid trash perks.
---
I lvled Jake to 30 for Iron Will.
---
Quentin for Pharmacy. (Vigil is useless)
---
Once you got a P3 Survivor Main you can unlock the trash teachables aswell.
---
I'm a baby killer and don't have any teachable perks unlocked
---
You can't do that anymore as far as I know.
---
DS is fucking stupid when you can just jump in a locker and be invincible.
---
DEUS VULT
---
GETTING DDOSED BECAUSE OF THAT THAT’s WACK
---
Spies From the Shadows is gonna have a Renaissance soon, the prophecy has foretold its return.
---
*freddy perks intensify* 
---
Not complaining tho
---
You fell asleep after he hit you, which is why it went down. You were no longer in his terror radius, so deep wounds started going down.
---
There should be a perk where after hooking one survivor you activate it and get a 4k immediately.
---
I only read them to see what the update was and yeah all the complaining worked cuz they fixed exactly what we were having problems with and I wanna see the game get better it’s just not fun anymore
---
Ooops, when you dont know shit but gotta pretend you do
---
Lag.
---
If you can reliaby find your obsession, then it may be an easy 4K depending on the map/gen-stopping perks. Even 1 token almost guarantees a chainsaw hit (that's how 5% is much).
---
If they are hiding, you re just Bubba who can rarely hit a chainsaw and M1 killer.
---
The Plague one looks better in game than I thought it would... but that Spirit cosmetic is fucking SICK.
---
*Ad hominem (Latin for "to the person"),[1] short for argumentum ad hominem, typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.[2] The terms ad mulierem[3] and ad feminam[4] have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.*
---
Source: Wikipedia
---
As far as I can see, or read even, he just inductively reasoned that you might not have the experience necessary to suggest such thing. It's not an ad hominem, maybe you just learnt that word and like to use it but he didn't do what you claim
---
Plus he pointed out you might be a Friday the 13th fan, which is highly probable since you're asking for a feature that come from that game and you never denied that. So, before saying someone is discussion based on a fallacy you should first be able to recognize if that's a fallacy or not.
---
You're not smart nor clever if you use a word you don't know like that just to excuse the fact you're a giant snowflake by not being able to take criticisms to your arguments.
---
You realize lore is meant primarily to explain the past and origins of things in a setting, right? You can't introduce something lore-breaking, call it an addition, and then just be done with it.
---
Killers can ruin the game for solo survivors...
---
Suck it up.
---
Dude that Clown skin is amazing.
---
neither should I
---
SPITTERRRRRR AHHHHHH She uglyyyyy
---
He's ghostface
---
I'm all for those, both completely ruin the fun of the game. The only time I bring a mori these days is for a daily and I don't use keys.
---
I remember being called a gen rusher by a Ghostface yesterday. I literally never saw him so imagine his surprise when I did the only thing I could, the objective. Did a gen solo, found ruin, did 2 more gens solo, then did the last gen with another guy. Ghostface and I catch each other's eyes for the first time that game as I am running to an exit gate to open it. He ignored me to continue chasing. I actually went down right at the exit gates because all 3 of us were sneaky little shits and got the Laurie off hook but I wanted to make sure she got out by bodyblocking 2 hits for her.
---
The amount of times I've taken 4 out myself and still gotten hit with NOED lol!  Feels bad man.
---
When brutal strength was a perk and not an empty slot
---
Down vote intensifies
---
They better not hand out ghostface for 7 year old to throw 20 pounds at.
---
My friend was tbagging the gate at 75%, I said just leave before you get karma-d by NOED.. Then he got eaten by the hand. This was our first experience with the bug lol
---
I use to get this on Xbox but never on Pc.
---
And you don't know how to read. He was attacking my character rather than my argument.
---
Figures that the Redditor with less than 200 karma is a troll.
---
Oh hell naw.
---
Guys, my wallet is making weird noises...breathing heavily...It also just told me it has no feeling in its left arm is that bad?
---
I think the spirit one is eh imo but each their own :)
---
I'm rank 2 and iron will is the only perk I must have. Who determines what is meta and what isn't? Is it you?
---
When you add new lore it still explains the past. It's just further in the future than the previous lore.
---
Games do it all the time, just look at WOW, overwatch, ect.
---
Bad meg players.
---
When is the October event going to begin? On the day of rank reset?
---
Fiiinally the only survivor I play gets some love!
---
That looks good. Who's next? Billy?
---
Well the teleport makes more sense than the alternative, being stuck inside the pallet
---
&gt;Thats true Hm....A lot of us were expecting legion to get one though might be too resource intensive since every legion character would need its own blight model.
---
I bet the community would settle for Frank and Julie since they are the "default" ones. They both have Prestige as well.
---
I randomly mentioned Nurse on your thread and completely neglected thanking you for providing these. 
---
Every new update I always look forward to your videos and general data mining done thanks to the dev build along side your knowledge exploring these files. 
---
Thank you and keep it coming!
---
I never expect someone to leave the hook as kill with the gate open. I personally just try to play nice and basically patrol close to the hook to just liven the game up a bit but I won’t get mad if someone doesn’t. 
---
Sometimes I lose my guaranteed kill; sometimes I nab an extra kill cause of over altruism. Whatever, I just move onto the next game.
---
I think their hearts were in the right place lol, but badly worded.
---
I used to get super salty when I played dbd, but after the first 300 hours I changed how I viewed the game and it's just been a straight up blast.
---
I think its just a matter of perspective.
---
Generally, the "bad" players are the ones who go out of their way to insult everyone else post game chat. If people focused on improving their game sense instead of lashing out, they'd probably have a better time.
---
Anyway, *see you in the fog*
---
&gt; It's not scummy.
---
It is. Your holding the game hostage and making 2 people who have already lost sit in a game that's over so you can get more points. It's scummy.
---
Same scummy fuckers who pickup and drop the last surv over and over to farm.
---
&gt;I tell you what is scummy tho, dumpstering survivors and not being rewarded because you did it too fast.
---
You can take that up with BHVR.
---
Hag is like top tier tho
---
I wish I clipped it, but some dude blew up a gen 5 times in 5 seconds.
---
I was beyond belief. They have never came that fast in that amount on me before, but there I was, watching the gen regress back down to zero.
---
You're the same guy who asked for a perk for killing the killer.. OMG
---
Now I get it why you are this stupid
---
your actually dumb, you dont get points for confirmed kills the game wants you to chase people
---
shes thicc aint nothing fat about that except dat ass
---
Well, in red ranks she is in about 25% of games so.... Still doesn't take away from the fact it is a great perk against every killer. More people should run it.
---
They went with Claude and Dwight last year, i’d be very disappointed and surprised if they don’t give Meg one as well to complete the original team
---
I never got 180k but I managed to get around 100k with Plague using only BBQ tier 3 and an escape cake. It really sucked because I used all my streamers when I could but survivors never burned any...not even the green envelopes either.
---
Once all the gens are done the supply drops with ar15s come in and the killer has to open door and eacape
---
It’s really cool!
---
But why can I see Claudette?
---
His power is being annoying
---
What’s a pug?  I finished a recent survivor game and one of the other survivors kept going into closets. Eventually, that survivor escaped through the hatch after we all died. In post game chat, the other two survivors kept saying things like, “fuck you pug, you’re a piece of shit pug, etc.”  Dude just said LuL, called us trash and then left. I still don’t know what it means to be a pug. Any help?
---
1. I see in other comments you cant hear the doc, Look below your feet for electricity. If you see electricity but don't have Madness tier 1 yet (brain status effect) you'll scream soon, be ready for that.
---
2. You scream whenever the doc zaps you (usually happens only in chase) and whenever your madness tiers up (circle around brain fills). Remember that. Its not just random.
---
3. Madness doesn't go up if you are in a locker. See electricity under your feet and madness almost full? Locker time.
---
4. Doc relies on messing with your perception. Know his tells. Sudden Terror radius change means its probably fake. Doc illusions never move. Fake pallets cant spawn on real ones.
---
5. Electricity under feet only happens when doc is in treatment mode (fist raised) not punishment (stick up). Doc cannot hit you when you are in this mode.
---
6. **MOST IMPORTANT** After doc zaps you, YOU CANNOT INTERACT WITH ANYTHING FOR A FEW SECONDS. Pallets and vaults includes. If he is charging up a zap, drop the pallet / vault the window early.
---
Still not providing points.
---
Your argument is flawed and abusable
---
whats bad about having something 100% precise
---
this made me laugh as hard as when i first heard “you’re mum gey”
---
Good question! I sure hope we can because I have zero interest in the characters featured on this year's event. Not that I have massive interest in the old ones either since I already got what I wanted (full huntress and full wraith) but at least I can get something for Billy.
---
Also Billy’s chainsaw activation counts as offensive action and spends tokens. Unlike Bubba, he also uses chainsaw for map travel, and thus, is less viable with it.
---
I never said i stood at the gates i ran spirit was running there as the same time as me
---
If i did most of the work it seems like ive earned my points 
---
I never said rancor gave extra speed i said the insta down is what stopped me now your putting words in my mouth you seem to wanna make me out to be toxic player that complains about everything but if you look it my original post i never once said it was op what i did do was ask why its not a hex becuase i thought it was really similar to noed
---
Because you can't alone? God damn it, that's a yikes for me, dawg
---
Jake has a bunch of shit wym
---
Barely anyone plays Hag though atleast in my experience. She is probably the least played killer hell I see legion more then her
---
I can't, it seems irrational and dumb.
---
Hi everybody, I'm Dr. Killermain. 
---
(Hi Dr. Killermain!)
---
Keys are fair and balanced. They are a limited use item just as moris are limited use, and are meant to give you a significant edge is escaping, just as moris are intended to assist us killers in our grim task.
---
If you're a killer with a key problem, I would like to proscribe some Franklin's hag for you. This should actually clear up any nasty item problems in your lobbies.
---
Take Franklin's Demise, Nurse's Calling, Monitor &amp;  Abuse, and your favorite swing perk (I like BBQ, for points reasons) and let's check back in a few days to see how you're feeling.
---
Remember to place traps in places you want them to have their vision snapped to, as well as to trap the items you slap out of hands. They ALWAYS run back for them.
---
HAVE FUUUUUUUUN
---
i don’t want to look at this
---
KINGU CRIMSON!
---
annoying and boring to play against because I know i'll lose
---
As a former P3 Hagatha main. I would run
---
Save The Best For Last(it's great on her)
---
Nurses Calling
---
Monitor And Abuse
---
I do it when helping my friend learn how to play. If he fucks up while learning to loop I run in and get the killer off him.  
---
Depending on how memey I feel I'll run MOM, Boil Over, or Adrenaline as my fourth.
---
most meg players
---
If she was a disney character, her name would be thiccy mouse.
---
Admitting to using a logical fallacy. Nice. You're not even Reddit premium.
---
Looks like the killer tried to warn you actually. The swing and then a no shaking quickly. Rip
---
In his defense, shred did work with exposed when Demo first hit public beta. It was unintended though.
---
Red herring fallacy.
---
The way you wrote that physically hurt me
---
Troll.
---
They’re called juke montages for a reason bud. By the way it seems like you’re talking I want to believe that you are the blendette that crouches in the corner of that map and calls that “ exciting gameplay.”
---
Largely agree.
---
However, there are things killers can do (I'm a killer main) that kind of invites survivor wrath. 
---
And there are things they can do that either incentivizes camping or tunneling. Example: do not make unsafe hook saves, I am not going after the full health hard target when an easy one is there. Suggesting otherwise is idiotic.
---
Furthermore, swarming the hook means I know no gens are being worked in while a player is actively dying. That is nothing buy a killer winning.
---
If you run into a camp, 80% of the time I'd say there was BM'ing involved or the rescuing survivors arent nearly as sneaky as they think they are.
---
The truth is hard to swallow.
---
Oh dear, “Mommy, Can i have this ghUstfeCe skin?”
---
I run out the door after I open it. I'm no team player even though I do SWF lmao. They know the deal.
---
I love Bill's perk but I only get slugged like once every 10 games, so it's just not worth it. It's kind of like when you actually see a Hag you wish you had Urban Evasion.
---
That’s fair but also kinda dick-ish.
---
Asking all the right questions, to the wrong bunch of people.
---
it boutta be a spooky release
---
WAZZZUUPPP
---
Revealing him gives him a Killer Instinct notification on you for a little bit. While you are in the process of revealing him, he also gets squiggly lines showing him what direction you're in (as long as they aren't bugging out)
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
I thought the aura was red devil ghost face repeatedly peeking around the corner
---
I would have escaped had i not been insta downed by rancor
---
Im not being toxic i just have to keep reexplaining to you what i meant if you would go back and read my post the right way (a person asking a question and not some salty survivor) you would see i do think rancor is stupid but i dont think its op or should be be changed as toybasher explained how weak it can be
---
IIRC I've read somewhere that the event starts on the 9th or 10th.
---
It typically starts around the 18th of October and goes until the first few days of November, just based on past Halloween events.
---
Sounds like lag lol. Wait till dedicated and that won’t happen again
---
Yeah I had another question about mains, I thought about going for p3 on meg or claudette, Claudette for stealth but I also have nice skins on meg, who did you p3 first ?
---
it's not, it's from an old event
---
no he just didn't leave laurie ever since the old lunar event
---
Clown is less common than her I think
---
Well thats just cos Bubba is a good boy
---
That looks cool kinda wish he wore a pumpkin on his head
---
Plague, spirit, Hag.
---
My wallet!
---
Howdy, Chris!
---
That's true, but not for something that throws the original spirit and concept of the game out the window. And that addition would *still* be lore-breaking, since the entity has full control over its realms and would not allow a survivor making attempts to kill a killer (see: what the entity does to survivors when the timer runs out on the endgame collapse).

Look man. You say that like I have a successful YouTube channel, I mean I’ve only gained 40 subscribers in almost two years. I do YouTube for fun because I enjoy editing and used to love making dbd videos. I know and you know I’m not gonna go anywhere because I do this for fun. I don’t plan on making it big, so why hate like I’m perfect and I take this seriously.
---
Just btw Otz learned to use PWYF on Bubba from Fungoose, he’s even said so himself for those who care to know. Fungoose’s Bubba is scary as shit because of it
---
MOM pre rework was godly. RIP.
---
That mori would be so damn good if they can make it a small cut-scene like in tekken. With the blurred vision from the  survivor's pov. And Rick Grimes would be survivor.
---
Watch some videos or VODs from Fungoose, he’s the one that made it popular
---

---
this comment section is like 5 mega threads

She has fat ass. That's about it.

It’s mostly the devs fault for how many damn embarrassing bugs in the game and etc.

I’m sure it’s an offering where it says something about it saying bubba

I just watch youtubers, so I didn't realize this was a thing until I saw Monto's stalk-only Ghostface video!

Dribbling is NOT a thing anymore. The only way that would work would be with a bad connection, as Decisive Activates in the pick-up animation now.
---
I’m a console player, I pity thy gen tapping red ranks
---
Heh. I was either working or played /r/MaelstromGame the whole weekend, I regret nothing.
---
Yeah, it's pretty easy to get into a routine that will let you get 3ks against most survivors once you get the hang of it. The majority of games, I'm letting the last 2 survivors go because I'd rather stay in purple ranks where I can enjoy killer. I have gotten a few thankful people going for adept.
---
Once you learn where survivors generally spawn and want to do, you can be in a chase almost instantly on most maps. Once you learn how to moonwalk, you make the easy-mode "follow the red-stain" looping a much harder mindgame for survivors, which almost none have experience against. Knowing when you are outskilled is one of the first and easiest things to admit to yourself and go for someone else. Killer isn't hard against most survivors.
---
351mb for steam might as well be 5 gigs
---
This girl is the thickest female character I’ve ever seen. Matter of fact. THE THICKEST FEMALE I’VE EVER SEEN MY GUY. I would clap them cheeks 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
dude you're literally a joke
---
SoOoO edgy!
---
Yep
---
When you ascend beyond revenge, you will leave that hook, and get another hook.
---
One day, we will al be able to leave the hook.
---
Same with pig.
---
My strategic mastermind runs straight at the killer while I have no mither. Now they have to choose: pick me up and let my friends unhook or leave me on the ground knowing I will just get up.
---
If they choose to pick me up, I'll die
---
If they choose to leave me on the ground, I'll rush at them again... and die
---
As you can see, this is a flawless strategy. Bonus points when the killer shows obvious confusion in end game chat.
---
I didn't know downing a survivor at the start of the match was toxic.
---
Yes. The perk will highlight the person on the ground and the person healing them.
---
Thanks so much bro I've been closing app
---
I still see.clown a decent amount but with hag I only see her once every month or so and it's a baby hag 90% of the time anyways
---
This update was for bug fixes (mainly EGC timer being out of sync) and pre-load event stuff.
---
Now I'm just imagining Apex Legends' Mirage as a killer in DBD.
---
And more then half the time it’s a survivor being a bitch. It would only happen more if they know the killer won’t be rewarded at all. Everyone could just dc whenever things stayed to go bad for them and killers would never have a good match.
---
Dwight screaming for the hatch was oddly hilarious
---
Aah so much spookier like this than the other formats ive seen, do you thin you could upload the others too?
---
Yes it does
---
I bought one. Its the comfiest pillow I own.
---
I feel like on top of killers getting something, survivors should get compensation points because it’s always almost an immediate loss when it happens because I know when a survivor dcs on me I lose a lot of points as killer or survivor
---
It's not your bullshit "truth" that hurts.
---
Spirit one was is mean
---
It’s mostly the survivors just being salty douches tho. And this is coming from a survivor main. I played a game where everyone except me dc’ed just because we were against Freddy
---
Oh. my. trapper. Look.at.that.spirit.
---
See, demo is a nice little flower :)
---
That’s funny. Your entire story happened to me. I got the game a month after Freddy was released. I would play a few trials a week, and dropped it multiple times. I started replaying it after Ghostface was added, and I’m rehooked (no pun intended).
---
Ghost Face is a lot quicker than T1 MM. I mainly play GF but man it would be a shiiiity game for survivors if he had smth similar to scratched mirror
---
Don't forget tier 2 version of that depips everyone but killer gets double pip
---
Kinda agree with this man here, if you want it, sell it.
---
Only one survivor skin? We only got two last year :/ There’ll be 3 survivor skins compared to the like 8/9 killer skins
---
Only thing I disagree with is attacking the unhooked survivor after their teammate farms them. Killers who tunnel are assholes. Period. Unless it's the end of a match there's no reason for it. Sure it might help matches end quicker, but point gains will be lower. It's not idiotic to not tunnel. It's smart.
---
I just slug the injured one and then go after the full health survivor. It means other survivors get off gens to heal them, and I'll likely get to hook the asshole. It extends match time and increases point gains.
---
Damaging full health survivors is my priority, especially if they farm their team infront of me. I'd rather do that than let them get away with being an asshole to their teammate for points, then to run to a gen and pop it. I'm not gonna fully punish a farmed survivor for shit they can't control.
---
I guess for killer: BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Haunted Grounds, Nurses Calling???? Idk it depends on what killer and what you need help with but you can never go wrong With those perks. 
---
Survivor: Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, maybe inner strength now. 
---
All of my personal opinions
---
I feel like I'm missing out. Huntress body pillow?
---
Yeah, just like Flowey from Undertale
---
I think you answered your own question ha ha.
---
Nah man 1-2 gens up means you got gens to defend not a single survivor to camp.  The amount of games I've turned around at 1 or 2 gens remaining is absolutely staggering.  Never give up on playing your winning game with gens up.  It's just conceding defeat and accepting your depip.
---
Survivor: borrowed time, decisive strike, adrenaline, dead hard, maybe sprint burst
---
Killer: ruin, enduring, spirit fury, bbq and chilli, nurses calling
---
What
---
The main anger was at being forced to play both sides
---
Lol at this post. Its a killer game. Since when is their respect in murder.
---
&gt;Entitled survivor mains.
---
Yeah, pretty much. I hate my fellow survivors sometimes.
---
ah yes the guy who wanted a perk to kill killers also complains about memes. love that
---
2 days ago, we did a game against a trapper. He had ruin, but it was in a good spot, because we never saw it. We ended up powering trough the ruin (none of us were consistent at hitting great skill checks, so it was going at a snails pace) killer was always patrolling the hook when he got someone. The game ended up taking 25 minutes and want to know what the first thing was that showed up in end game chat? "Fucking gen rushers!"
---
It's similar but a key difference. Spirit fury breaks a pallet automatically after being twacked. The tokens for this hypothetical perk are only gained from an obsession and after say 3/2/1 stun from the obsession only will a token be removed in place of a stun. The obsession stun can be pallet or DS or maybe even a wiggle escape stun. If DS were to remove a token instead of stun, they still break free but you aren't stunned
---
Well expect survivors to keep disconnecting then.
---
It stacks in the way you would think. If two add ons both increase an items charge, they are added together. Same with any other stackable.
---
W for us Jake mains
---
I hope he gave you hatch
---
I have often lamented about the amount of hand holding this game does. There are so many visual and audio cues to tell you what is going on, but the devs feel it necessary to add so much BS in the UI. 
---
I think for new players it’s great. However once you reach a certain amount of playtime hours (not rank since that shit resets), I think those icons should go away and you have to rely on skill  to notice or know what is happening.
---
is there a sale for killers that happens around halloween? I didn't get to play last october because my computer died.
---
Is decisive strike still considered really good after the nerf? Why is Adrenaline considered so good?
---
Does the plague get a visual indicator if someone cleanses them self?
---
I thought so at first, but I feel like hers will probably be better in closer view. Kind of like Billy's blight skin, just looked warped and oozy, but he's got skulls on him when you look closer.
---
It feels so good when you got your SWF all working together like a well oiled machine, everyone risking their life to just get that 1 person out as well. I hate it when it happens when I'm the killer, but pulling it off as a survivor is part of the reason why I still play this game
---
Spice it up even more and play another killer! Be daring, You got this!
---
Because who needs hair when we have H A T S
---
lmfao. me too
---
If the 2 other survivors bodyblock, a grab will be pretty damn hard
---
NOED used to have a 2 minute window? I wonder why they took it out. And killers used to get a 10% speed boost when all 5 gens were done? Sounds like complete bullshit lol
---
Noah
---
Get the boat
---
I wish I didn’t know this existed
---
I totally agree, but I make sure to still apologise in the end game chat (unless they were pretty toxic during the game)
---
Should've had a tongue sticking out
---
Which one? I'm on mobile and it's really smol
---
Been there, finding the hatch in time is my fucking nightmare. Also, very nice of you. As a survivor main, I'm glad when I meet such killers. While when I paly killer I usually let them escape if I don't have a ritual or smth
---
yeah
---
Oh god I would love Ghostface as a Fortnite skin, doesn’t fit at all, but damn it would be sick.
---
This is the average noed user
---
I mean, Ghostface is cool in any media
---
the clown be making the face pumpkin spice whores make on OCT 1
---
Iron Will is very meta right now. It's good against Nurse and Spirit both, while also being not useless against all other killers.
---
Hey, you can’t be playing this game! It’s rated 17+! 
---

Real gamers use Devilface to try and fix this.

Why Plague? Nurse deserves that spot more than her.

Also, one survivor skin is disappointing.

Oh god the last thing we need is Nurse’s abilities on a go kart.

I bring in BT because my whole playstyle revolves around prioritising the other team over myself; the Ash method.

Ash’s Finale outfit; the badass threads you see in the attached artwork.
---
I just played a game with all green ranks survivors against a rank 19 doctor.  After saving the only person hooked with an instant heal syringe and hitting the exit...well...we saw his rank and it kinda felt bad.
---
Also, can you go through stuff? Because I can.
---
Agreed but if it’s 1 gen left I’m getting that fucker off ASAP
---
Did you have to post this 4 times?
---
Lets be honest, if the survivors are any good, a camping killer before the gates are open should be an easy win. Just get the gens done. One giy might depip, but the killer will too.
---
Hmm perhaps, maybe even tremendously decreases night shroud recovery and he loses it if he’s broken out of stealth, but he doesn’t break out of stealth when he hits someone, so it’s literally ghost boi gotta slap you then gtfo before you can break him out of stealth, and it would need to be used with the add on that makes it take longer to break him out this would make for a terrifying but fun GF match imo...
---
OR he has to fully stalk you then your aura is revealed for as long as it would last if you marked someone normally, but still requires 2 hits to down a survivor... 
---
oof you’ve got me thinking about it and now I really want this add on (preferably the first idea but either one would be cool)
---
Well a few killers are already as fast as a go kart so... It wouldn't be unrealistic
---
I mean she probably expected you to run, not just stand still
---
There is actually only 1 reason to. Blood Warden if you have it. It would be so beautiful to see a Plague with Corrupt Purge and Blood Warden active at the same time.
---
Me:(can’t even draw straight lines)
---
Cool I didn’t know they were adding the boomer to dbd

As an international Bambi-activist, this offends me.

I got this one time for like 10 seconds before loading into the actual game. I still have the video clip on my ps4. "Debug Map/ Debug Theme" i remember it being called

Got a regular killer here in Australia who does it to change things up, 0 blink pwyf nurse....

It’s completely fair what are you supposed to do let them escape and lose that kill no that would be stupid

Where are you guys finding all these cool killers? The ones I get just try to kill me faster probably thinking I'll DC too.
---
And what a body it is...
---
I'm using the shape as of rn
---
They are also moriable in your terror radius
---
Such a waste of a perk slot, and unnecessary.
---
R/amitheasshole
---
That Jake outfit is fire. The only people complaining are the Nea and Dwight mains lmao. As if they don’t get a new skin every 3 weeks.
---
Epic
---
That's the attitude! I can confirm that it's almost impossible to repair 5 generators by only 2 players. And that with an almost decent killer, if he's actually good we don't srand a chance. So in the name of all "untoxic" survivors, I thank you
---
Just had this happen when I was trying out Plague's green add-ons. I felt so bad because one guy DC'd before I even touched him, while the other bailed after the first hit.
---
Low quality, delete this
---
Bamboozled
---
To tell you the truth, I’m a survivor who knows my shit. Not even looking to brag. But my teammates most of the time have no fucking clue what they’re doing man, atleast in solo q. Majority of survivors in this game just aren’t very good, whether it’s rank 1 or 20. Any moron can hold M1 on a gen, farm some dudes off hook, get into chase and make it to rank 1 with time. As you get better at killer and if you decide to get better at survivor, you will see. It’s the teams that commit to gens while 1 man is getting chased that win, so splitting pressure is key as killer. If you know one guy has self care, smack him and go find someone else. And always tunnel weak links, a shit of survs throw pallets ASAP so I just follow them and respect every pallet then break it. You will lose a few gens but the deadzones will be worth
---
I mean, if a feature was implemented where survivors could not spawn on ruin, then that also means that is less spots they have to look for it.
---
Or you use Calm Spirit for 5 hours, don't see a Doc then as soon as you take it off...
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
mori*
---
Me except Iron Will and Resilience
---
You're correct, but I learned a better way from watching DamnNoHTML (Scott? Idk his twitch name)
---
Looking down avoids flashlights just like looking up does, but with the added benefit of the survivor thinking you're still looking at them. So just stare down and laugh when they slow vault into you
---
Dat clown though
---
Wait....there's a huntress body pillow?
---
As much as it sucks as a killer, I take some joy knowing how awesome the survivors must feel in that moment
---
"Oh, hello, Mr. professional serial killer backed by a powerful demon, who holds a weapon when I do not. Are you ready to die?"
---
How did this make any sense whatsoever?
---
That would be so cool his headlight could be the thing emitting the red stain
---
Wait, it does that even if you've already been unhooked? Not to say that I tunnel, but good to know.
---
Nice chainsaw
---
Pat him
---
It's not that it is good, it just makes a weak killer more bearable to play.
---
Naw. Some people are pretty good on console. I have a friend who is probably better then most Nurses on PC.
---
Once we were playing and he told me to actually try to escape. He didn't believe I couldn't escape him at all. But I couldn't. He was damn good
---
IIRC, you can bring a mori in order to attempt to get around the issue (Though the hook change to moris makes this a lot less useful)
---
That’s what bbq does.  It punishes that shit.
---
Low karma, not authoritve Reddit user. Blocking trolls is the best response.
---
Bye.
---
Behavior clearly hates survivor mains
---
If you have talent, then your age doesn't matter and it will be respected.  Putting your age as a disclaimer to try and soften criticism is not a good habit to form and will not help you grow as a creator.
---
That's the risk you take.
---
There is a reason if you're running Blood Warden.
---
Devilface also makes the problem a lot worse.
---
As someone on the forums described it, "It's like trying to sneak up on survivors while cosplaying as a fire truck"
---
The entity isn't all powerful.
---
Spirit lookin straight out of FNAF 4
---
My cosmetics reset after every update.
---
I have so many video clips saved up of me spawni g within 20 feet of ruin. I feel bad and woild just let the totem stay up, but that would end up messing uo my teammates as well

Anytime it does this I restart my ps4 not just the app. It usually works. Keyword USUALLY

Exactly, teabagging can get you salty but it’s funny and you just gotta accept that they outplayed you (if they didn’t then they’d have been sacrificed). Face camping/tunneling/proximity camping is genuinely toxic - nobody has fun, nobody gets BP... what’s the point?
---
I mean blur their names out on this picture, posts that are shaming players get removed
---
I believe someone said they got rid of the 2 minute timer because Survivors would just hide
---
Is it normal for Daily Rituals to randomly change between matches? Kind of upset this happened.
---
Sick!!!
---
Bruh, I'm gay, get out of here. I have a job and friends and a whole life outside of this game. I'm sorry you don't understand how building up hours in a game and managing your time works, but I hope you figure all your shit out.
---
You have to uncrouch first, but it's  roughly 100x faster than Amanda's crouching and uncrouching.
---
Honestly, I really don’t care if lose the game lol. I just need my 4 bbq stacks and Im out. Usually the games go really smooth and I ended up getting 3 or 4 kills and sometimes I get none. To me it’s fine because bbq gets me a lot of points. For me it’s a win lol.
---
You should normally eat it if they're in a locker, leave em if they're on the ground
---
Or maybe I'm wrong and never managed to do it while crouching
---
Bruh mine was 600mb. Its like ur fownloafing the game again
---
I had this exact argument with someone post match and ended up getting a 4K cause they still went for the save. Calling me trash and I said - y’all are hooked and dead. I think the stupid one here is not me.
---
I love people that believe that if you aren't playing meta perks then you're trash, it's comical how you don't think for yourselves. Lol
---
I agree that Thantaphobia is pretty bad on most killers and by itself because it is hard to keep everyone injured and the 16% generally is not worth the effort. However, the one thing Legion and Plague are good at is keeping everyone injured to the point where good survivors don't bother healing against legion and don't cleanse against the plague. The 16% stacked with the slowdown from Dying Light does make generators progressively slower to work on.
---
Furthermore, almost everyone likes the new Dying Light because it works. I play Freddy and Hag in red ranks using Dying Light instead of Ruin so I can vouch that it works.
---
No Father as well.
---
Yo I can only imagine a blight Legion skin would actually be really cool. The Legion are the only really normal people among monsters (aside from Ghostface) so seeing them get the blight treatment would be amazing
---
These all look great especially Hag and Spirit. 
---
But one survivor and four killers? Not crazy about that. Last time, we had Dwight and Claudette at least, right?
---
I don’t play fort nite so I’m indifferent to whatever skins they get, it would probably be really easy for EPIC to license just the mask and put it on like a white sheet ghost skin and just say it’s “ghosttrooper” or something.
---
If you choose to play that way, fine and dandy. 
---
However, optimal play is to scratch a player as quick as possible. Work smarter, not harder and all that.
---
If someone else makes a risky unhook, blame the teammate, not the killer for making the optimal play.
---
That's like one of those inept robbers complaining the the store clerk grabbed the pistol when he dropped it at them. Not a perfect analogy, but you get it, right? It's never the killers fault when the survivors cooperate poorly, or just dont cooperate. 
---
::shrugs::
---
I got nothing. Except I will always chase a wounded survivor over a fully healed one. Every time.
---
There there’re.. I started playing last weekend so when this weekend came up with bps it was an incredible blessing in disguise for baby killer me
---
I knew about it but other games I played also had weekend events or things about to expire that I needed to finish up.  qq
---
I cannot wait until the halloween event.
---
if you are a gay its easier to find sex with someone
---
go to a gaybar and stop wasting time with this stupid game
---
give your money to buy drinks and condoms and not to buy bhvr's dlc
---
Tried and SUCCEEDED. Don't ever sell yourself short, this is amazing.
---
-Sincerely, a Ghost Face main
---
Actually yes.
---
Cute drawing :)

I'm going to block you now, I'm tired of hearing your bullshit
---
Isn't there a cooldown on swinging as the killer ?
---
oooh noooo lmao
---
Even teabagging or taunting aren't toxic. I can understand when a Ghostface tunnels the fuck out of me if I run Object, it makes sense, I can completely invalidate their entire power. Gates are open? Camp the hook, it's the sensible thing to do.
---
Both of those actions can have purpose, however they can both completely and without counter prevent one person from being able to play the game at all. It can be really shitty, but it sometimes is what is needed. Someone spamming crouch and wasting their time or making pointing motions doesn't prevent you from being able to play the game, and the fact the people compare it to actions that do is a bit ridiculous.
---
Yeah, many people are entilted in this game, but i'll always hold true to the fact that Survivors are always worse.
---
Yeah I mean it depends why you play I guess.
---
I try to get 4k every game. IDC about blood points because I got most perks in most killers (and a survivor with all perks).
---
It’s cause of his confident power walk

Claude is great for hiding, but I recommend maining your favorite character(s) with the best cosmetics.
---
I P3’d my Claude first.  Now I never use her.  
---
It’s mainly a rotation between P3 shirtless David, P3 Ash and Dailies when I do play survivor.
---
You're a controller user so no one is scared of you.
---
If they’re both for the same thing, just different add ons, the one with the greatest boost takes priority.
---
I commemorate you for making this post, last time I tried making a statement on here I got some interesting angry survivor comments xD
---
It’s not camping it’s permanently guarding

Really nice drawing, great job!
---
It does

Some of them have Vietnam flashbacks thinking they won't get even one sacrificie till the end of the match. Either this, or they are just tryhards who camp all the time. Unfortunatelly, some killers and survivors have their pride bigger than their skills. After all, it's a game where we should all have fun, rather than a "i-will-let-down-all-my-survivors-mates-so-i-dont-get-killed-first type of game" or a "camping-next-to-a-survivor-is-my-way-of-living type of game".
---
I’m calling the police
---
Beautiful Drawing :D
---
Mad grit probably
---
PREACH IT LIKE IT IS BROTHA!!! 
---
The amount of hate mail I get because I get gen rushed and atleast want to get two kills for some minuscule amount of blood points because I didnt bring add ons for one game and all survivors brought pink keys and brand new parts. 
---
Survivors think they are entitled. Snobs, if you ask me.
---
So the perk “borrowed time” uses the killers terror radius to detect if “deep wound” should start ticking down or not (it ticks if you’re not in the killers TR) when Freddy hits you you enter the dream world, making you “oblivious” while you are “oblivious” you are not effected by the killers TR including perks, so what happened was meg was hooked, then bill or whoever saved her with BT then she was hit by Freddy, she didn’t down and instead fell asleep and activated the BT deep wound effect but because she was now asleep her timer immediately started to tick down so Freddy just had to follow her until it ran out (like how legion use to work)
---
this is a pretty terrifying skin for him.
---
But you can use object of obsession from anywhere if you’re asleep.
---
For killing survivor* 
---
If you're camping and/or tunneling you will likely only get 1 kill
---
The objective of the killer is to kill all the survivors (or most of them) and prevent them from escaping
---
If you Camp/tunnel you are not doing the objective, you are just being an asshole to the other 3 people on the match and PREVENTING THE CAMPED ONE FROM PLAYING THE GAME. And you are not even making profit of it since you LOSE points from camping and you won't get the points of going after the other 3
---
Is It a strategy? I don't think so. But even if It was, It would be a stupid one
---
What if we wants to camp the last dude?
---
&gt; Hitboxes are fine, just look it up, they showed them several times. Oh wait, nevermind. Because people are stupid AF if you look for "DbD hitboxes" many braindead posts like this pop up.. it's like calling your skin "fingernails' even if they are not the same thing at all
---
Best response regarding this situation. Its so annoying to see posts like this titled "hitbox".
