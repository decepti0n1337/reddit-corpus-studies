Every multiplayer game ever made has people complaining about it. That's just the nature of it. If you think this is salty you haven't heard the ingame chat of peak Call of Duty

they downloaded a custom icon pack
---
It would be a new feature. I'm not keen on the idea either myself, but hiding behind and in things is already part of the game, so hiding under something isn't some out of this world idea.
---
BTW he mentioned hiding under a bed and behind things in the room.
---
I literally use Ruin, Surveillance, and Pop and gens still pop ridiculously fast.
---
‚ÄúSkill‚Äù
---
I've been seeing people run past the gate and into the part past it, but it's not counting them escaping.
---
I'm a r 4 killer and 6 survivor dummy. Still doesn't matter you're a shitty killer that got outplayed and now you're whining about it on reddit. Awwww man.
---
Yes but I‚Äôm obviously talking about the bed part. 
---
And so if they added a bed in that map they would have to add a bed in every map then. 
---
In some maps it won‚Äôt make sense. 
---
And it gives more hiding options which generally you shouldn‚Äôt have to use. Because your main goal is to escape as fast as you can. 
---
I don‚Äôt see the idea being implemented.
---
This is wonderful! Love how creepy it is, it's just unsettling to look at. Great work!

i would buy but you sold out on jane feelsbadman :'(

---
When in the world would you run discordance or surveillance over ruin?? Those both slow down only one generator at a time max, and it requires you to go deal with it. Ruins automatic, stalls everyone, and sets out survivors on what could be a long search for the totem.
---
Ruin is by far the number one reason I run stake out.
---
This just gave me an eyegasm. Nice job.
---
Maybe just over thinking it. "Press space to hide" could appear on various objects and wouldn't be so far removed from lockers. 
---
All in saying is it isn't a crazy idea. But I wouldn't care to see it in game either
---
Survivors that I valued their perks:
---
Nea: urban evasion and balanced landing
---
Meg: sprint burst, quick and quiet, adrenaline are all useful
---
Claudette: self care
---
David king: dead hard
---
I haven‚Äôt had much use for the other survivors reachable perks and look for the ones locked behind the moneyrealm in the shrine
---
Look at his name though. He's just role-playing. I bet he would go great with a hot turkey sub, mmhhhhh.
---
I‚Äôm a fellow Ghostface main, and I approve this message.
---
I would like Joyce Byers or hopper
---
How? Is there a problem with a perk that only activated when you fail a gen skill check? I believe it‚Äôd be a perfect change for the perk
---
It sure takes skill to just stare at someone lol, you have to mindgame and time your vaults as survivor dumbass, this game isn‚Äôt about skill
---
You just need some distance and out of line of site. I usually use it once or twice every game, especially with quick and quiet
---
At least Jane‚Äôs perk will net me 250K bp
---
Makes breathing louder
---
Obviously a survivor main no killer in their right mind would leave a hooked survivor right next to the exit gate, I mean what did you really expect? He made the right call and the t bag was not fair he wasn‚Äôt being toxic.
---
Those are always the worst type of players
---
Drunk drivers I tell ya, sorry for your loss bro
---
I feel like this mostly targets a very particular audience of people who went through losing a baby, or maybe those with fertility problems.
---
Not trying to be rude or anything, but that never happens. Toxic people just think that they are funny and laugh off everything. For the number of times he T-Bagged I doubt he had even a sliver of regret
---
I hope this never gets fixed
---
Most likely
---
bind "f" "kill"
---
There isn‚Äôt one yet, but lots of speculation that there will be one

:( indeed

Reinstall the game my friend had to do it too

Ah yes. Probably gonna get Overwhelming presence if i get any of them then. Thank you.

Good meme btw!
---
but that effect is really cool! :c
---
To inform you if they are active/cooling down
---
Oh! I've seen that on here before.
---
I like it on Ghostface, but I don‚Äôt need my screen activating kill mode when someone goes down across the map from NOED
---
Nah this shrine is shit. Which perk from this shrine would you pick up and actually use as opposed to the 40+ better perks in the game?
---
I'm shit at hitting great skill checks so I always look for ruin
---
Ty! üíï
---
Jane is life
---
It‚Äôs usually the other way round
---
Its normal and it is pretty frustrating. Some days its decent with like 2 minute waits at most and others I've waited nearly 20 minutes lol (that was at like 4 am though)
---
i personally love it, instead of NOED just showing up like that, now with that effect it makes me feel like shit just got real and i gotta be careful and dramatic and stuff
---
Baby legs, you're a good detective. But not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with regular legs.
---
nothing good, oh well
---
Lol, what a coincidence
---
Someone did an Oopsi
---
I would LOVE Billy as a Survivor. I would main the shit out of him.
---
Given how often you play killer your response is fair. But might you understand why someone might choose to stay near the hook and look for the other survivor?
---
No, but ruin is a bandaid that sometimes helps, I mean since I got to purple ranks all I face is atleast 3 swf, and even IF I manage to 3 gen them, I had matches where all 4 escaped through the hatch because someone had a pink key, not counterplay and they were all hooked 2 times, yet I lost and ofc they were toxic as fuck. The game needs some serious overhaul, SWF simply breaks it and voicechat will do the rest.
---
Oink?
---
Awesome play
---
It still doesn‚Äôt matter. Camping ruins the game for the person getting camped. I don‚Äôt care if my team wins or loses. If you‚Äôre wasting my value time gaming by sitting there and having a staring contest I hope you go down an entire rank. It‚Äôs not skillful, it takes no skill to stand near a hook and look at it.
---
I feel like you also punch holes in walls when faced with a minor inconvenience.
---
What's wrong with dead hard? Still under 100 hours here so still learning

r/cursedimages

Nice
---
I mean the monthly twitch challenge from dead by Daylight seems to be a leaderboard if you aren't aware of it and you sign up every month and it's based on points also per match.
---
Why would they pick Billy? While he had a bit of a redemption arc, I don't think he's largely considered likable. I'm sure they'd pick Steve or Hopper. I'd also take Joyce. Any of the other characters seem like they'd just be too young.
---
I don't like the effect either.  I like it on ghost face a lot.  But for make your choice, haunted grounds and Michael's tier 3 no thanks
---
It barely works most of the time
---
Billy as The Flayed, of course.
---
MEG JESUS CHRIST DON‚ÄôT DO THAT TO NEA

happy cake day
---
For me on PC:
---
Survivor queue time: 3 seconds, literally
---
Killer queue times: 3 minutes, literally
---
Why not run all 4?
---
Ya it can be fast midday then slow 3 hours later, it sucks. It's probably the biggest downfall to the ps4 version besides no dedicated servers.
---
I‚Äôm not aware of that no, do you have to be a twitch streamer for that ?
---
Well, atleast he tbagged, clearly outgamered
---
I have never had this happen until the last month.  It has happened a few times.  I just close out the game and steam and it's fine.  It's been about a week since the last time it happen
---
This give me autism's
---
1/6th scale means it‚Äôll be around 30ish cm in height
---
Ya I'm with you on not liking the effect on anyone but ghostface. Especially cause half the time it makes you think it's you with a tier 3 Micheal suddenly behind you haha.
---
looks like he's using Dead Hard
---
Is that where sometimes it doesn't lunge but it still puts you into exhaustion? I thought it was just my pc having frame rate drops at the wrong time
---
Yup, same here. Looks like we've got a situation.
---
Thats a whole another level of bad puns
---
Same
---
Make one for The Wraith and I'll buy one!
---
Lol I wish the killers I went against ran all these shit perks. The only one of them (besides ruin) that's worthwhile is Corrupt, and even then only on Trapper/Hag.
---
Oh darn, look out team, the killer's running Pop Goes The Weasel, he's gonna knock a whole 10 seconds off one of the gens after we get 3 generators done during his first chase.
---
i see a jojo reference
---
Agree on this, had a game last like 40 seconds cause 2 people DCed and I kind of just killed myself. Wasted an escape cake thanks to teammates thinking that going down first = Death Hook.
---
Are you planning to purchase all, some or none of the DLC? If some, which ones?
---
What killer should i buy first
---
Yes this happens every day for multiple hours... use the search feature
---
Chill, Claudette.
---
Ever played Overwatch or Paladins? Lol. Now thats a TOXIC community.
---
Imagine being so upset at being unable to get out of brown ranks that you say "fuck" 10 times in your title... sorry OP but you might just be bad if you cant get out of brown
---
The others talk shit but mention survivor dc they will worshipping your grundle
---
6 perks. 4 perk slots. And most of those perks don't work unless you quit chasing survivors To use them.
---
Not a bait like everyone else said but still solid hit
---
Shot through the heart, and you're to late. The truck gives driving a bad name
---
Oh yeah I was about to say if you was lower rank, perhaps that's the reason why you seen so many base killers. Who knows?
---
We already have two Jeffereys and two Davids.
---
I get autohaven and wraiths all the time
---
What a chad
---
Wraith i such a scary and cute boy
---
By normal he meant a killer that dont click any buttons at all, so he can feel he had something in his life by wining a virtual game match and see some numbers going up
---
No one cared about Bill. Also, Did seems to be down right now on PS4, so I can't play Bill anyway.
---
Petition for Kate to have misty day cosmetics
---
At any rank no one should care about their rank.
---
Yep that‚Äôs it. I think the bug came with the Freddy rework. Let‚Äôs hope we‚Äôll get a hotfix soon.
---
reminds me of vigo painting in ghost busters 2 really like the way you did this
---
5000BP is actually a very nice price for healthcare in the entity's realm.
---
Speculation? Or just hope lol
---
This is disappointing. I was hoping for Enduring or Overcharge, especially Enduring since I got Spirit Fury. Both Killer perks are virtually useless, Poised is decent but it's super inconsistent, and Calm Spirit is just a Doctor and Spies From The Shadows counter
---
Silence weaboo
---
You got it wrong pal, I am not upset about getting out of the brown ranks. I am upset about how the ranking system behaves when killer DCs.
---
Nah it was Freddy‚Äôs rework that‚Äôs when this all happened
---
Well maybe it's something not to include in your title then
---

Rank on this game for the most part is pretty meaningless, it mostly just means you play the game a lot. I've seen high rank killers that play like shit and high rank survivors that play like shit, they definitely need to change the ranking system
---
lol Ghostface's Elbow would like a word with you.
---
LMFAO sometimes you just have to set a 15 second timer after a game ends to see the chat messages fly in
---
Stridor is good if you game with a headset, makes it especially hard to lose survivors that aren‚Äôt running iron will.

Someone should do make a toxic meme doing the exact same thing but with the swf picture

Not to participate, no, you can see active challenges on the dbd official twitch and connect your game to it from there

Consistent =/= good. I guess if your arguing for Trapper,Hag, or Myers since they need corrupt intervention to build or place their power. But other than that you're wrong. Its the best one.

Ahem you spelled normie wrong *Normie*

Ok I am just a purple rank, but usually 4K on him the snares goes around the loop as example think about pallet between 2 cars L form u trap at   Middle of the car survivor is looping (u might need 2 traps cause that slow is really weak) also u can gen pressure without stopping a chase by baiting a teleport but not taking it which will slow gens a bit, that‚Äôs all I can think rn, good luck.
---
See's exploit.... BAN EVERYONE INSTEAD OF FIXING IT!!!I understand banning people for abusing exploits but... I wonder how many people got banned for accidentally using the wrong 2 legion add ons? Like I didn't know about it but it was a rare and very rare so by luck i just never used that combo. The devs said they were bannign people who were using it. I bet 90+% wondered wtf they were banned. 
---
It seems that the devs half hazard ban people for bugs they are slow to or dont want to fix. The Get outside of gate exploit has existed since day 1 and can be replicated 100% of the time... and yet people who cheat to keep there rank through disconnectring and the constant rage racism and toxic behaviour in post game chat continues to get worse.
---
Every day I play without fail has toxic chat in one or more, usually around half. And by toxic I mean straight up harassment, racism, and people trying to convince you to commit suicide. 
---
How hard would it be to create a system that selects players who use the n bomb or KYS 10 times a day and investigate??? Or if you are loggin chat you can 100% do that now.

inb4 they adjust the price to 2.700 but yeah, this is the first time.

She‚Äôs legal for sure now :)
---
##TL;DR
---
I wanted to rework [We're Gonna Live Forever](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/We%27re_Gonna_Live_Forever) to give Survivors a more reliable (a la [Barbecue &amp; Chilli](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Barbecue_%26_Chilli)) and team-useful way to earn 100% bonus Bloodpoints and incentivize taking the heat for fellow Survivors ‚Äî without requiring a hit or risking immediate tunnel after an unhook.
---
##Pros &amp; Cons
---
Pros
---
* It pays well to be altruistic
---
* Earning 100% BP is more consistently viable *without* being to the detriment of teammates (Safe Unhook doesn't always equal a *safe unhook*)
---
* Like BBQ, a reworked WGLF offers Survivors strategic advantages in addition to bonus BP
---
Cons
---
* Could encourage tunneling if the Killer thinks/knows a Survivor is running reworked WGLF
---
* 4 Survivors using reworked WGLF could be a vanishing nightmare for Killers, especially newer ones
---
* This is a band-aid solution to closing the Killer-Survivor Bloodpoint gap
---
##Notes
---
* 7 seconds is about halfway to Bloodlust I
---
* Scratch mark disappearance is an eyeballed blending of [Poised](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Poised) and [Distortion](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Distortion) numbers
---
* The template is a work-in-progress, but I'm happy to share ‚Äî or post once complete for each rarity level ‚Äî if anyone is interested (can be edited in Illustrator or Adobe Acrobat; could create a Photoshop one if needed)
---
* Actually, is there a current template that others are using? lol.
---
* Interested to hear any feedback! üíÄ
---
They're more than simply consistent though, the effects are strong. Surveillance slashes your patrolling time significantly by telling you directly what generator to head to, while PGTW rewards snowballing by taking massive chunks out of gens and is especially useful on any killer that's strong in the chase.
---
Wha
---
Another one who plays Spirit for daily at rank 14
---
BILL!
---
Why wait for when they are legal?
---
In-game testing shows what it really is. Test it yourself if you're sure.
---
Thanks ü§ó
---
We don't know but from what we've seen of their map and the legion themselves it seems it takes place more around the mid 2000s but that's just a guess.
---
Nah, give it a miss, watched the game against rank 20 nurse and yer just a pair o wee bawbags
---
Lmao that nurse was soo funny ahaha
---
works both ways
---
Only rules should be 1.don't face camp 2. Don‚Äôt tunnel (if possible. If your getting unhooked and downed right after blame your teammates not the killer.) 3. Don't t-bag unless you want to be tunneled.
---
Why is this person getting downvotes? This is how you're meant to play. How you want. There is no way you're meant to play. As long as you're not hacking or exploiting everything is fair. Survivors can do what they want and so can killers.
---
Yep, fuck quitters.
---
are you using the perk no mither?
---
oh and they're all teachables, cool.
---
If you are David king or have the perk no mither attached then that‚Äôs what will happen
---
Its a perk you have equipped most likely on david king called "no mither" its made for a specific playstyle you should read it well
---
verify local files through steam much less time than redownloading it

Won't fix that my friend did that 3 times failed each time

---
Thank you
---
Seen a youtuber discuss this suggestion a few days ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGZBfJQTANU&amp;t
---
Needless to say I agree with him. "Blindness" as it stands right now is pathetic, especially against SWFs. If they took the suggestion in that video and applied it, then blindness would be a threat finally.
---
did you find a solution for this problem ??? i have the same thing and its going worse every patch they're doing ... did a ticket 2 week ago and i think that team is sleeping..
---
fixed it for me less than a hour ago
---
You have the "broken" status effect, means you cannot heal or be healed in anyway. You can gain it from deliverance and no mother perks
---
You fool!
---
For Survivors its pretty useless or easy to achieve.
---
For Killers its harder therefore you can know if the Killer its kinda good or not more accurately
---
Yep. Basically makes you silent and makes their screams they produce useless at finding you however they get a point scoring meaning they could use that to know someone is around.
---
My friend had to do a full reinstall because even through the verify files finished EAC still came with same error
---
FBI, this one right here.
---
It is only because most survivors are complete morons and refuse to touch gens with it on. I've said this before, if I could clone myself to make a team of 4, Ruin would be completely and utterly useless. I hit almost every check and I waste no time looking for the totem.
---
PGTW is lowkey the best one as there's no way to counter it and it can effectively add a 6th gen (or more) if the killer can keep up with the hooks. Seriously, a competent killer using this perk is simply devastating.
---
I mean... he‚Äôs not wrong.
---
Shroud of separation is a fun mind game
---
yikes. tell him i press F to pay respects
---
Oh yikes. I don‚Äôt even want to think about how crazy working on her will be.
---
The thing is that I think the dev wants to implant a system reward for ranking but if they stick with their actual rank system people are only gonna abuse the system to get rewards :s

from the looks of it they were new to the game and playing her for 1st time so u dont come across 2 well. i'll play you both in kill ur friends.
---
What‚Äôs his weapon then
---
Survivor: *gets hit by ambulance*
---
Ambulance: ‚ÄúI have destroyed the very thing I swore to protect‚Äù.
---
Sure tomorrow im down im off to sleep now though üëç ik she was clearly new dont know how we matched her ranked 12 or somin on survivor, ill vs u tomorro if u want though
---
killer: brings red mori and insta downs, expects easy short game
---
survivors: 3 man DC and 1 hatches out
---
killer: angry that it was an easy short game
---
I‚Äôm way too dumb for that :( im reinstalling it rn
---
Can you actually be punished for being toxic? I had 4 lobbies today where the survivors after the game were typing vile racist shit
---
A killer with NOED contains about 110% of the daily recommended sodium intake for survivors DBD.
---
Wich perks are orphans? (This is a joke with the "no mother")
---
Okay. That still doesn‚Äôt make it better. Often you don‚Äôt have time to walk half way across the map for a gen that just got activated because you‚Äôre in a chase. And Corrupt intervention is a perk for 120 seconds. After this brief period it is an empty slot. While yes you can argue ruin becomes an empty slot when destroyed 9 times out of 10 it is going to waste *someones* time. 1 time out of 10 it will waste yours. Pop goes the weasel still isn‚Äôt the best either because you have to walk to a gen, which isn‚Äôt always possible and it only regresses it a certain amount. Furthermore, it can‚Äôt get rid of two close to finished gens. Only one. Unless you somehow managed to hook one, break the gen, hook another break the gen. And if it‚Äôs close to being done, the time to hook the second will allow one of them to be finished. It‚Äôs close to the usefulness of ruin but not quite. Because ruin always slows the game while pgtw does it only for a brief period albeit big amounts. While ruin has the ability (if not broken, which no, doesn‚Äôt get broken fast every game.) to slow down progress towards exit gates forever.
---
True story: 
---
I just hooked a survivor and went straight to look for another, and there you see a wild Bill standing up in the middle of the street ( Myers Map) like "I don't give a fuck" ( he knew I had mori cuz I already moried 2 ). Oh boy...  I couldn't kill him. I just couldn't.
---
The survivors could at least stay in the game, but your right that when a killer brings a red Mori and insta down add ons they shouldn‚Äôt expect to have a long game or to pip
---
It's truck month
---
Well I know what my new phone background is
---
SCIENCE
---
No cause it happens nearly every game
---
this is a little farfetched. Camping was the best thing he could do in that situation. Not everything is facecamping bud.
---
... how about Frank's butt as one.. no reason..
---
Unpopular opinion, I'm happy Stridor is in the shrine. This way I can pick it up for Spirit and not have to worry about getting bullied as a baby nurse for 40 something levels.
---
Wrong Jane perk.
---
I think you mean Sakura. But thats okay, shes a dumb zombie now
---
No. Now they're angry about dead hard not being fixed in this patch. :(

---
This meme needs better understanding of perks and exhaustion.
---
Makes pratically no difference
---
some people just get their happiness only out of insults. It wasn't the fair game that was fun to play, it was shitting on the killer.
---
I wish I could upvote this twice.
---
You have a point.
---
You often, if not always...see toxic coments from survivors in the chat. Like if it was part of the game, it literally pushed some Killers to hide the chat box cuz they really couldn't take so much harrasment. ( I keep it open tho I love the tears)
---
Baited by the bait.
---
Aw ty üíï
---
Ha haa!
---
Did he facecamp at the end or was this something he was doing from the start? That is the real question?
---
PGTW + BBQ &amp; Chili + Surveillance + Discordance. They won't be able to touch a single gen without Freddy knowing about it.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. When gens are being done fast you don‚Äôt need tracking you need regression and there‚Äôs only 2 perks shown here that are capable of that.
---
The best part is, if it's drawn right, you could think it's Julie OR Frank, depending on your preference. &lt;3 Great idea!
---
I hate to break it to you but there‚Äôs a lot of people in the world who have FUN with competitive gameplay. What‚Äôs the point of playing a game if there‚Äôs no competition? Why would anyone ever play survivor if it was rare to win with the role? The nature of the community‚Äôs toxicity doesn‚Äôt arise from competition or rank or anything like that. It arises from being an online game. All online games have toxic players, that‚Äôs just the nature of them.
---
It's a bit pricey ngl. Is it their first one because I could kinda understand if it was their first DBD product. Still, too much for me.
---
That it doesn't give either Survival or Objective points is weird.

I haven't played for a little while so I'm not at Rank 1 right now, but when I was I would always run Iron Will, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, and Decisive Strike. I'd say if you're at Rank 7, though, you know which Perks are good and which ones you like. Changing your loadout won't change too much unless yours right now is absolutely horrid.
---
Okay. Are you experiencing the same issue?
---
Not really. Red rank killer is almost equally as easy to achieve even for players with limited killer experience.
---
Well, you'll never know. We're talking about a $19.99 cosmetic. Or even a bit more expensive that'll bring in serious money.
---
Now that's salty
---
Okay, Are you experiencing the same issue?
---
That dude couldn't kill a deaf woman. How tf is he gonna outwit a band of survivors
---
The most common perks for survivor are usually Adrenaline, Decisive(?), Borrowed time, and one exhaustion perk.
---
No, thank you for drawing this masterpiece.
---
A person?
---
AFAIK, Disgraceful Defeat was the phrase that was used before the Killer Victory Cube (when they made killers get 2 kills to pip). It's likely to be just another bug
---
yeh ik, I just wanted to try out some new perks.
---
Well maybe bond to see where survivors are, adrenaline, stake-out, and an exhaustion perk?
---
I dunno, the devs will get creative
---
It's a salt community because of people like you. Just give it a rest with the division between killer and survivor. Both sides are as bad as each other.
---
What was his goal from saying that?
---
Wtf is wrong with you people!?
---
Just checked and yeah it's 2k
---
&gt;PGTW is lowkey the best one as there's no way to counter it
---
The counter is simply to just not get hooked. Waste the killer's time in loops as much as possible.
---
No respect for the 4%. I swear, new and baby killers don't know about the 4% respect.
---
RIP auto correct üòÖ
---
Surveillance is trash tho. There's no point it using it.
---
Hag rips her hand off and throws it?
---
I'd suck him.
---
I think Freddy should‚Äôve used some more sun screen when he went to the beach. (PS: Good job!)
---
But like he doesn‚Äôt have a weapon that he uses consistently in the show.
---
If you think DbD is bad check out the Overwatch, For Honor, and Gears of War communities. DbD is where I come to take a break my man LMAO
---
Pop Goes the Weasel combined with BBQ on Freddy is top tier ... But you know what? I still thrown in that Ruin. Why wouldn't I? Sometimes I'm lucky and it doesn't get destroyed right away.
---
Yeah, fuck 'em gens!

Thats not a netflix exclusive but cool idea
---
This is so weird, I feel like I havent seen a wraith in years on ps4. I get a lot of trapper, huntress and occasional pig. 
---
I miss that bing bong boi
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs just so *frustrating*. It honestly immerses me more because I want to kill them more
---
Thank you that means alot to me
---
Omg are you gonna make more for other survivors!?
---
If they are good, they‚Äôll hit you with a hatchet while you are dropping it.
---
I usually run Spine Chill, Borrowed Time, Lithe and Bond.
---
I do sometimes tend to swap out Lithe with Decisive Strike.
---
Iron Will, Lithe, Dance With Me and Urban Evasion is another go to of mine.
---
I have this same experience. Not a lot of killers in our region I guess?
---
How dare you question the flawless ranking system, there's absolutely nothing wrong it and you should get better because SWF is not broken at all. 
---
For all I know they‚Äôll use his fists. Maybe a bat. Maybe even the Mind Flayer‚Äôs tentacle or something. Just speculation.
---
I..... understand..... nothing
---
I use Adrenaline + Balanced Landing + Decisive Strike + Borrowed Time. It‚Äôs been working pretty good for me at red ranks.
---
I have no clue. Only thing I could think is he was hoping I‚Äôd argue. I really didn‚Äôt care though they found the hatch and had a key and made a clean escape. Nothing to be mad about.
---
if the doctor is running restraint its actually easier though since you can easily see the auras rather than a massive black circle just covering where the survivor is
---
Thanks sounds useless though
---
Aside from Laurie Strode, most survivors have died or disappeared from reality to end up in the Fog. 
---
Barbara and Billy come to mind as characters who fit this archetype nicely. 
---
Barbara for memes, Billy for the beefcake variety.
---
Rule 7
---
Just report them for inappropriate and offensive massages. If they actually said an insult then theyll most likely get a 2 day comm ban. 
---
Bouns points if you bait them into sending multiple messages insulting you. Only makes the algorithm pick it up faster.
---
It really js
---
This.... Is a high quality shitpost. Proof in the number of people saying just how bad the alternatives are. Killers that moan about genrush aren't a good thing, but survivors that try to act like theres oh so many ways to stop it are no better.
---
Either way, its a fact of the game at this point.
---
Oh gosh she‚Äôs hot
---
Same. Why would you want an insatnt queue if its going to be against players that are a way higher rank than you? Makes absolutely no sense for a ranking system to even be in the game at this point.
---
Same here on PS4. Can‚Äôt load into a game
---
Means more for rate Killers than Survs
---
The down votes do the same thing. I love a salty survivor who cries!
---
Don‚Äôt worry I upvoted
---
I mean he did have slippery meat
---
I also think that would help naturally slow down the game since survivors will have options other than gen rushing.
---
You are breathtaking
---
I mean of course he camped. Gate was right there. Pretty sure everyone would do the same
---
I might!
---
Serious Question: Why aren't the devs adding different gamemodes? Have they made any comment on the idea?
---
Abusive chat, yes. Teabagging at the exit gate, no.
---
Add BARB and you have a free 35 from me
---
How you get 4ked by a camper?
---
Freddy is a bit hard to get down. If you're just starting out, I'd go with Leatherface or Myers.
---
That‚Äôs fine but don‚Äôt complain about genrush if survivors just choose that it‚Äôs not worth doing then. A counter makes it seem like an actual objective. The whole damn point of NOED is to get survivors to do totems, so to go against an idea that also pushes survivors to do them because it makes NOED less likely to proc really doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Any killer who doesn‚Äôt rely on NOED should be for a totem counter.
---
I wouldn't really consider a killer that dodges toolboxes or SWF or anyone with more than 500 hours to really deserve red ranks and yet there are a bunch that do.

To be fair, it does feel awful to down a survivor, then the exit gates get powered and the survivor DS you and Adrenalines away with full health. Can we at least make it so that Adrenaline doesn't proc while being carried or while on a hook?
---
Last survivor potatoed and tried to be a dumb hero.
---
That hag is definitely a punk ass bitch but honestly you should‚Äôve learned after the first one was camped to just do gens and leave.
---
That's what we were doing. Only got three done with Ruin.
---
No, you're breathtaking!
---
He needs to learn grammar if he is going to taunt.
---
I recently got the game. I cant afford to buy the currency, so how long would it take me to get enough to buy a survivor? I think it‚Äôs like 9,000. I have 1600 at the moment and am level 15 and rank 15
---
Ya but if a person is shitty in general she won't let ya 4k like Shock Doc
---
The end game collapse only occurs if the hatch is closed by the killer. Let's say there's one gen left and one person left. It may be more favorable to finish the gen and open a gate since the killer will be looking for the hatch.
---
Thank you, I hope your friend likes it üò¨

My bad. But ive sworn ibe seen 3 before

Ah! To down them with the chainsaw when they show up for the save! ü§£ü§£ü§£ Jesus Fuck I'm dumb! ü§£ Thanks for that!

I just came üçÜüí¶
---
I feel your pain, happens nearly every time I find a damn key.
---
All Blindness does is make it so survivors can't see slugged survivors and have a harder time finding hooked survivors.
---
Hag is a mistake
---
That‚Äôs a whole 9 fucks this guy gives
---
Boi. you better link me. Lol
---
nice
---
I'm running IW3 on him an I can still hear his ass.
---
As a Killer Main I was clued in when I could hear Bills coughing floors below and above me.
---
Got a lot of hate mail for "cheating" that day.
---
I'm surprised people are going with legion, if we're talking about base kit killers (which is how you should base any tiers at) I'm going to go with doctor as weakest. Doctor at base power is the worst killer currently, his base shock therapy is slow and such a short distance, renders nearly useless on maps with big loops, which is most maps lol.
---
I think that's only marginally what happened here.
---
Yah this happened to me about a hour ago on PS4, closed App, reset PS4 and rebooted and still having problems for about 20mins then it cleared up. 
---
I really wish BhVR would address this issue and get it fixed. I don‚Äôt know how many games over the last few weeks that have been shit canned because of this broken ass game and it saying no connection when my wired 100mb connection is running perfect! 
---
But hey here‚Äôs another patch update and DLC add on! 
---
Game still broken. 
---
If it wasn‚Äôt so addictive I would be playing something else by now, but DBD has me hooked like crack!
---
Always make sure to patrol generators and damage them even if a survivor just started to run away from one.
---
Yeah.  PTSD, trust issues, and probably years of therapy.  It's fucked up.
---
Happens every time
---
On a whole nother level
---
what else was he supposed to do? -\_-
---
It‚Äôs annoying
---
*Piano intensifies*
---
Mayday mayday! It‚Äôs regular price!
---
If not everyone is at the gate then it's good to wait for them in case they need a bodyblock. Plus killers usually don't fully commit to scaring them out
---
Now do David's pecs and Dwight's ass ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Looks like robot chicken
---
I think I might get poised and Stridor
---
because ruin gives me inconsistent results, i don't like playing with it, either i do great because of it because no one finds it, in which case i don't care about it because i can't feel like i've won because of me, or it gets found right away and i've only selected 3 perks.
---
surveillience is an auto-pick for me on everyone. the info you get from this perk is wonderful.
---
They were all at the gates. 2 at each gate. Everyone tbagged me. Except for one guy who i didn‚Äôt see.
---
And this is what Breakdown is an underrated perk
---
I have no idea how you got that from my post. I didn't mean to say that competition isn't fun, most of the games I play are competitive, I meant that when you put yourself into a competitive, sweaty mindset in a game that is completely unbalanced and not designed properly for competitive play, you are setting yourself up for rage and bitterness towards the other side of the community, sorry if I wrote different my thoughts were completely scattered so I may have said something incorrect.
---
Head On
---
Let's be real here.. 
---
They ain't gonna stop. You gotta either: grow thicker skin so it doesn't bother you, git gud so there's no survivors alive to tbag at all, or move on to a different game with a less toxic community if you can find one.
---
Free bloodpoints
---
Survivor main here oof
---
For what?
---
Great taste, terrible execution. Have you ever heard of the perk ‚ÄúProve thyself‚Äù?
---
???
---
Honestly exposed is the only status effect that actually poses a threat, even deep wound is barely an issue cause your timer is paused when you're mending or in the killers terror radius
---
Repeated stabbing doesn't lower the meter anymore anyway
---
Play ghostface so you can tbag back if you're that passionate about it lol
---
This is not a grammar complaint, I'm just clarifying because he said he just got the game. The self healing perk is called Self Care.
---
He is just being pragmatic
---
I'm a simple man.
---
I see a jojo reference, I upvote.
---
I stopped playing Overwatch because I tired of the abuse because I didn‚Äôt constantly heal ‚Äúthat one guy‚Äù and when I did and he still died, I wasn‚Äôt protecting the team enough. 
---
Personally I haven‚Äôt received abuse in DBD in a few months. I think people on Xbox at least have given up abusing people for stupid things.
---
Does anyone have an idea when killer and survivors chapters might be on sale again for console or just ps4? I‚Äôm on the edge of buying a chapter but I don‚Äôt want to miss out on bundle deals if they are coming up again. Thanks!
---
Easier said than done sometimes. Overall PGTW has probably done more for me than ruin ever has.
---
&gt; (No re-posting please!)
---
Do you know where you are? I give it a week.
---
Lithe is the best in my opinion. You can use it on every map very easily and is almost impossible to use on accident like sprint burst or balanced landing. When paired with light weight or dance with me you can easily escape a chase when you need to.
---
I _do_ hear people complain about BT still when it's used to its max potential, but besides that, everything in this post seems about right.
---
i think he ment same place
---
Go play single player games. You're gonna get people teasing you in every online game.
---
But she just a stealth buff last patch. Transitioning into and out of crouching is smoother and faster. They basically made combat straps part of her base kit.
---
Buy him he is fun. Play him like a mix of trapper and hag and you will have a lot of success
---
I put that there because people tend to use the excuse ‚ÄúHurr durr I didn‚Äôt know they didn‚Äôt want it reposted‚Äù :/
---
Forget the snares bring in the pallets run enduring brutal strength and break everything
---
No it's not. I'd say it's about as useful as Discordance, which is to say mildly useful. It's helped me before.
---
They are skins. Just pick the one with the perks you like best. Claudette is newbie friendly with her built in stealth and self-care. Id start with her.
---
I can‚Äôt agree because tunneling is a real strategy. People can manuever around that. If I am targetting one guy? They can expect that. I don‚Äôt camp though. That‚Äôs stupid.
---
I just think they should change gens to make them longer then change Ruin so it doesn't make it impossible for gens to get done. Don't ask me how I would change it I have no idea.
---
Him or me?
---
Angrypug has been playing leatherface with insidious lately, atleast last 3 streams i watched, so that might be a reason, but idk
---
Survivor main oof
---
I don't think you understand how BBQ and Chili works
---
Trapper.
---
No other killer needs addons just to be playable, has such long prep time and can have their powers so easily bypassed, escaped from or completely disabled. It's insane how weak he is.
---
Developers said in the last developer live stream that they plan on that being a perk that gets reworked. I'd personally like it to maybe reveal the aura of the hatch if you are within a certain distance and are the last survivor. Thematically maybe have it like deliverance and you have to perform a safe hook rescue before you can use it.
---
He‚Äôs right, and I‚Äôm a killer main, just play a killer who can get point off of it like GF or huntress or play a killer who punishes it like nurse, every game people are gonna be mean
---
Ok thanks this just had one maybe a month ago and I didn‚Äôt know if they were going to set up a summer event or something like that to put chapters on sale.
---
Just a question, are you playing console or PC?  Console vs PC has some major differences on the strength of skill check related perks, as on PC frames are super consistent and it is easy enough to work through most "Skill check" perks, while Console's inconsistent frame rates means it is much much harder.
---
Adrenaline is countered by noed ?
---
You are not serious right? Right ?
---
You're not 100% wrong, it was free on psn as a ps+ game one month, so they may have been referring to that.

Oh look, never seen this before.

Erm, Is that the crap that lets the killer get a free win?/Kill Survivors after they‚Äôve been hooked?
---
I only care as a survivor because it decreases my chances of potato teamtates.
---
Really wrong.  It's value depends on your speed as a killer (Slower ones get less impact from it), but even just the extra sound range on gen repairs can help cut down patrol times fairly significantly, and being able to see what gens have actively not been touched by a survivor after kicking it can be MASSIVE.    Flat out knowing that no survivors are even touching X gen cuts patrol times down massively, and for killers who can blink/teleport to a specific point on the map at will, majorly increases how much pressure you have.
---
I'd argue it is infact one of the strongest killer perks, it's just sleeper in it's value.
---
Oh this. This is beautiful
---
I'm not talking about that, he puts MoM with good perks when it's garbage. Just shows that killers think every perk is op. I know this is probably an old photo.

You are right but he just holds a special place in my heart

A few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa. And, um, my cousin... Mufasa... was, um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests. And, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience... of what happened.

Nope, my spirit,billy, nurse, and huntress are all p3. Rank 3 right now, have a stash of moris I never use because I'm not an asshole.
---
Amulet
---
Do you need 3 traps for this to work? Can it be done with one perfectly placed?
---
I see this argument alot and IMHO there's a difference. 
---
Adrenaline only activates if the gates are powered (be it gens being popped or hatch being shut.) If your team fails adrenaline practically won't activate besides the hatch being shut, and YOU can die before the last gen is done and adrenaline did jack shit.
---
Adrenaline still pisses me off especially when all survivors are injured, you finally down one who's been looping the shit out of you, and just as he's downed the last gen is done and all 4 survivors were healed. I don't see it as a crutch but it is annoying as balls. 
---
NOED will always activate unless all dull totems are cleansed, it's impossible to know if the killer is running it outside of stereotypes ("Killer is playing bad, he's gotta have NOED. Every Wraith, Trapper, Leatherface, and Freddy has to have NOED.") and even when it activates survivors have no clue you have it (besides the speed boost) until you actually hit someone or they find the totem as it lights up.
---
Whether NOED "Rewards Failure" or not is up for debate. Just because 5 gens were completed doesn't automatically mean you failed your job as Killer, just that endgame has started. 
---
I run NOED on Wraith and Leatherface because they suck arse. (Leatherface's chainsaw is hard to hit people with) I ran it on 
---
Old Freddy as part of a "You forgot the power glove!" endgame build. (Remember Me, NOED, Blood Warden, Fire Up/BBQ/Rancor/whatever. Instadown, wait or slam the door open, hook for blood warden) 
---
I refuse to run it on Nurse because I'm still a potato and don't want to get into bad habits. I also don't typically use it because I hate the aspect of banking a perk slot when it could have been used for another whole-match perk.
---
I don't think Adrenaline is comparable to NOED. Adrenaline is basically a reward for doing your objective, while NOED activates even if you sit facing a corner the whole match. I wouldn't say it rewards failure or is directly a "Crutch Perk" but it definitely can be used as a crutch. Nothing frustrates me more than going from a 0 hook game as survivor, to a 4K at the last second. 
---
Personally I'd just add a totem counter to small game so totem-hunters (Believe me, they exist. If you suck at looping like me you're like one of those sucker fish breaking totems for boldness BP) can have a better idea how many totems are left, especially solo players.
---
Not bad, already working on stridor, and have unnerving but still not bad
---
Will take a while but not too long. Im like level 50 something and if i hadnt spent the coins id easily have enough and just got the game last month
---
dude i laughed so hard
---
I remembee seeing a tru3 video when he 3ked and complained that wraith isnt viable. Sure, wraith is the worst killer but you did 3k, no need to cry again.
---
If I bought a Mori for a particular player it's for an actual reason and not being good. People who shittalk me and call me garbage in post game chat, people in the Ochido steam group, (HATE these fuckers. I haven't meet a single one who wasn't a flashlight macro spamming, teabagging piece of shit who deserves everything they get) Usually I bring them for dailies or if I'm in a bad mood.
---
I do agree they're handed out like candy though. Hillbilly and Nurse lack ultra rares, meaning you get an Ebony Mori every single bloodweb (if you own the DLC killers and can't get the splinters) at high enough of a level. I only use them if I feel like a cleanup operation is needed. (Suspected SaboJake Squad, several Legacies with flashlights, etc.)
---
I think the Mori used to be alot more bullshit though. When the game first came out you didn't even need to hook anyone to use it and could Mori people on their first down. 
---
I wouldn't call them completely overpowered but definitely unfun to play against. 
---
I'd maybe add a BP multiplier bonus or something for how late you use the Mori (and how often if ebony) into the match similar to DeathGarden and executions. You tunnel off the hook and use it as soon as you can on everyone = very little bonus, but only using it late into the match (Especially with a Cypress) or ONLY using it when people are on deathhook = big bonus. 
---
Wouldn't completely solve the tunnel-mori issue but it'd at least provide encouragement to use them in a more fun playstyle for the survivors.
---
Where did I mess up, survivor main?
---
But the point is to make the perk good... it would be for bad survivors that aren‚Äôt good at skill checks. That‚Äôs what it is right now. It wouldn‚Äôt be meta
---
Hahhahaha Nobody uses keys, InstaHeals... You've OBVIOUSLY never been a red rank killer, where everyone is a SWF, InstaHeal,Purple/Pink key, Adrenaline,Dead Hard user.
---
Yeah Billy did the only smart thing here OP is just a jackass.
---
Repost
---
If 90% of the killer need a especific perk for the same reason, then that means it's game mechanic problems
---
Then they better learn to hit a skill check
---
But did you kill tho?

Sprint Burst is good if you're getting yourself caught out of position a lot. Once you've got a better feel for where you should be if you think the killer's coming, the rest are at least on par with it.
---
Dead Hard is pretty much always available but trickier to use right. Lithe has lots of opportunities to get used and combos well with some other perks. Balanced Landing has the nice knock on effect of always reducing your fall recovery, but you'll have fewer opportunities to use it.
---
Was never a DS user before, but I don't leave the campfire without new DS. Absolutely love it.
---
I mean the person did work and grinded the bloodweb for said mori's so i mean it only makes sense. Just as survivors farm for insta heals on their items.

Well Liver...it was a good ride while it lasted.

---
Using a stutter for fictional quotes from someone arguing against you makes this whole post painfully obnoxious
---
Thank you for actually having a conversation and not downvoting.
---
Too be fair, Ochido and his wannabes are assholes so you know what? Mori them all. But my main problem is targeted moris for survivors that play fairly like me. Thats why I want playertags to be hidden because I dont have the money rn to change my gamertags.
---
Old moris were actually fair if the survivors were good. Most of them probably run ds and that was when it was unbelievably bullshit. Double pallets, minimum of 30 pallets in a match pretty much. It really just depended on how good the survivors are but for not good ones it was unfair.
---
Sure you dont agree about the overpowered part, but at least you do realize that their unfun to go against.
---
Snares are your best bet. Don't be afraid to spam them around loops. When you're heading to a spot where you think a survivor might be, place a couple of snares along the way so when they run back they get slowed down. Doing this IS VITAL when playing on let's say Haddonfield or pretty much any bad loop spot like the pier in the Swamp Maps or whatever. You have to get into the habit of laying down snares at choke points during a chase. 
---
You can use the teleport to scare them away from a gen and also bait them to leave a gen. So, let's say you're using BBQ or Thrilling Tremors and know they're at a nearby gen. What you can do is walk up to the gen, start the teleport to make them run away, and (hopefully) have them run right into your arms. If they're running towards a gen you can teleport during the chase to mind fuck them and cut them off. 
---
When you close the hatch you can place snares at exit gates to warn you. The only thing they can do is run up to a clock to escape dream world and have the snare not effect them. But that's precious time being wasted when EGC is happening. 
---
I'm a firm believer that Bamboozle is core on every killer sans Nurse/Spirit/Hag for obvious reasons. But I don't think Freddy needs Bamboozle as much because of the snares. He still benefits from Bamboozle but it's not as essential to him. 
---
Perks that go well with Freddy:
---
BBQ/Thrilling Tremors.
---
Thanatophobia IF you're using Jump Rope + Outdoor Rope OR you're using Red Paint Brush + Swing Chains. If all survivors are injured this can slow down their action speed by 25%. 
---
Ruin. It's Ruin. It's a core perk for everyone. 
---
Haunted Ground. Just a great overall perk.
---
That's about it. You're free to use whatever but BBQ, Thanatophobia and Thrilling Tremors that really take advantage of his power.
---
Nothing wrong with Adrenaline or Dead Hard. Nothing wrong with Noed, BBQ, Ruin, Franklins. so what about me who solo qeues to rank 1 every month? who doesnt use keys instas, is that fair? Nope.
---
Red Ranks are toxic as hell but I wanna get there just so I can mine grade-S salt. 
---
NOED every match, 3-gen Dr. Worldwide (With a Jigsaw Piece), Ebony Mori's, Iri Heads, etc. Just burn 'em all and bathe in the glorious, purifying salt.
---
I already have the adept achievement, I was just asking for a fourth perk that goes well with her other perks.
---
This is behind that building with the truck in the garage. In a far corner of the map, hidden in this little circle of trees. I must've walked past it at least twice, as did my late teammates (God rest their souls).
---
Ah ok then I would say selfcare, pharmacy, iron will or borrowed
---
Im ashamed i didnt check it out sooner.

Sorry, I worded that horribly. I already have the achievement I was just wondering a good fourth perk to go along with her others. Thanks in advance.
---
Whos Bubba
---
Get 3 other friends. Easy red rank
---
...but what's in the Tupperware?
---
Decisive, Borrowed Time, etc. 
---
Maybe I'm unknowingly proxycamping as I do honestly tend to linger around the hook a bit.
---
There are also times where I come back after the unhook and the only survivor I see is the guy unhooked. 
---
DON'T unhook right in the killer's face. Sometimes I see that happen (or have had it happen to me.) and of course I'm going to punish the other guy's stupidity. (And from a logical standpoint, why go after the healthy unhooker when I can target the injured guy?) If I'm feeling merciful I'll leave the victim slugged. Other times I might re-hook or even Mori him. If you're gonna do an in my face unhook at least run borrowed time. 
---
I don't go out of my way to tunnel but if the only survivor I can get to first is the unhooked guy I'll go after him. I'm not the guy who will slide around 3 guys bodyblocking just to tunnel though.
---
Sorry, bad wording. Already have the achievement, just wanting a good fourth perk with the others. Thanks.
---
Holy shit that hatch! I'm legit happy that you got to escape man. That level of altruism deserved it
---
This is a really not accurate meme. Only comparable perk is PGTW, but that isnt as good at all. The rest don‚Äôt slow the game down, they help you choose targets. You can‚Äôt afford to go after every discordance or surveillance proc every single time.
---
You do realize that even if the killer brings an ebony and moris all survivors after their first hook, they actually depip, right? It does have a drawback that the killer doesn‚Äôt benefit from it
---
Don't mind the flair, but I second.
---
LMAO I had a similar run in with a Mori Nurse today who let us finish all gens because I just didn't give a shit and kept doing gens even when she was right next to me.
---
Sometimes Mori people are cool. You are one of them.
---
Do gens instead of only getting chased all game. If you can‚Äôt get on gens because the killer won‚Äôt leave you, then just purposely get hooked so they move onto somebody else
---
Okay, think I'll try out self care. Thanks!
---
2k hours later I still crouch and take one headphone off like a bitch if I see a hag
---
Not OP, just wan't people to learn. Maybe it could reduce the sound of the gen you're working on in addition to your own noise as a buff. I prefer when the gen blows up in peoples' faces, then they can go to a different gen and not fuck up my progress more
---
That‚Äôs an health cop car
---
You see the "Did You Have Fun" thing at the top? Rate it one ball. I do it all the time but it's probably a placebo button/illusion of control thing.
---
Who did I disrespect?
---
How did I play victim when I just want to have a conversation?
---
I am going to be negative if they just resort to downvotes instead of actually talking.
---
I disagree because the same can be said about some things that Survivors can do such as all starting together, giving them a chance to pop several gens  within minutes if you're unfortunate enough to be checking all the other gens they're not working on when they're sticking together. It's even worse when they're SWF because it just takes one of them having any kind of Killer detection perk to tell the others where the Killer is. I've had matches like that and it's frustrating because they end up with a huge advantage. Not even Hex: Ruin will help in some cases because a lot of Survivors know how to work around it. I'd use Mori if the match was going really bad against me with a SWF group sticking together because when gens are popping that fast and everyone's being told where you are Mori at least allows you to secure a kill if and when one of them slips up and gets caught.
---
When playing Killer I get most annoyed by Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, overpowered flashlights of doom, areas where there's a pallet within every metre in all directions, and all Survivors starting together. Heck, Survivors starting right next to Hex Totems. Adrenaline just hurts when you've been chasing an adept Meg for ages, finally manage to injure her or knock her down, and then a split second later her Adrenaline kicks in and she's sped off in good health. Borrowed Time's a bitch when the Exit Gates are open, you've just hooked someone, and then they're unhooked right in front of you, the perk kicks in when you hit them, and they're dashing into the exit. While these things are annoying I accept that they're game mechanics to boost Survivor's odds. I just can't be doing with people who endlessly loop the same pallet because the chase gets tedious. I wish they'd loop it for a limited time and then go off elsewhere as the chase is funner when you're actually running up and down the map in and around buildings.
---
When playing Survivor I've moaned about NOED but take it back because it's seriously useful when playing Killer. I've never really had a problem with Mori. While it does take away a second chance of being saved it's up to Survivors to try their best not to get caught a second time. Try to be more stealthy and predict the Killer's movements. I've had the insta Mori from Myers a few times where he can straight up kill you in tier 3 without ever hooking you and while you're healthy but it still didn't bother me. As a Survivor these days the only thing that really gets on my nerves is facecamping, genuine tunneling where the Killer ignores other closer Survivors just to get to you, and worst of all teammates who leave you on the hook for so long that enter the second stage. That's way worse than Mori in my opinion. For your own team to take away your second chance.
---
I mean, truthfully, I would love this, but it would take a ton of money for such a niche audience. If they did it, it would be amazing and I would be in line to see all of them though
---
Safety pip usually, most killers use them to stand their rank. You usually get good gatekeeper, and some sacrifice. Unless your a bad killer.
---
The effect isn't that bad tho
---
this ain't a casino
---
You know you don‚Äôt have to play a killer to put bloodpoints into them.
---
"Yare yare, you truly are face camping scum. You can never pay back what you owe... IN BLOODPOINTS! DC DC DC DC DC DC DC DC!"
---
Sure, If killers stop Headbangging/slapping on hook
---
Ah my friend she made me brownies. I wasn‚Äôt have a good week and made me homemade brownies. 10/10 would eat again

I think he means at the campfire and they all joined the lobby at the same time.

thats the Moment, I would just say screw it and work through it ^^
---
Happy cake day!
---
Freddy can camp now.
---
How about you fuck off.
---
Quick and Quiet or Dance with Me to combo with Lithe. Bond, Adrenaline, Kindred, We'll Make It, and Spine Chill are all good solo perks. Dark Sense and Alert is a fun pair to keep an eye on the killer. One final suggestion, and this is a personal one I choose, Prove Thyself and go to a gen the killer kicks that you see with Alert and you might find a teammate nearby to double up on the gen.
---
NO. You bring a medkit, get a teammate, or slap on Adrenaline
---
3 Davids and a Claudette. The perfect trolling squad
---
Forget searching for a totem. Learn to deal with the tough skill checks and pay attention.
---
Totems got really hard to find and is not worth deep searching trying to make the game easier for you.
---
How to counter ruin: fix the generators instead of wasting time searching for totems.
---
A reason why the rank system is broken. Ebony mori with iridescent head, I‚Äôm not expecting to pip. Just a total waste of time. Lame depip game, not even fun even if the killer is simply bad and we still manage to pip or escape.
---
Then other survs try harder to pip and make stupid plays, unhook in front of killer just for points, etc.
---
Quintin needs it more. Fucker looks like he eats crack rocks for breakfast
---
All the killers seem menacing and creepy AF, and some of them (Freddy, Myers) are. But literally all the non licensed characters used to be nice people turned into monsters by accident. Wrath was tricked into transporting human bodies, Nurse was abused in an Asylum. Clown, Wrath, Trapper all had a hard childhood. I love how deep these lores are despite them being like a page long.
---
Hmmm well you can at least milk GhostFace for the BPs and pour those into Billy. 
---
GF for sure is a BP goldmine if you have BBQ&amp;Chili.
---
It ain't easy bein teen
---
Kind of diminishing returns eventually, honestly. I see a lot of dumb shit at red ranks.
---
I just need Pharmacy, Technician, Aftercare and Distorsion to complete survivors' perks. Please...
---
Seen Laurie? looks like a cow and a Horse took turns kicking her face
---
just use blood warden lol
---
Smurfing. Nice
---
Brave of you to post this on this sub
---
amulets.
---
Legion
---
Nor is it great when that one girl in your class grabs a ruler, breaks it and uses it to torture other teens for an eternity in The Fog. Damn splinters
---
How about we add that and an offering that makes it so survivors get no perks! Equally terrible ideas
---
Im not talking about swf. 4 randoms with no items. Fair? Against an ebony mori omega blink nurse?
---
Ah yes make a feature where someone else controls how I play the game I paid for. Sounds lovely.
---
*for potatoes
---
Purple rank and higher don't even miss ruin skillchecks, much less the super easy overcharge skillcheck
---
Yeah I agree, but as we know survivors have it very hard
---
Wtf hahahahahahaha
---
its a bug you can fix by equipping self-care, solidarity and mettle of man
---
Survivors can still knock out one gen while it's up if you get unlucky on your patrol
---
Join the DBD discord server, muh easier to find teammates
---
This is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever seen.
---
Sounds like your issue is more with BBQ and Chile then it is with Mori's since you get less for killing then sacrificing.
---
r/justlearnedthefword
---
Yes and we should nerf dead hard because bad survivors should just learn how to run the killer correctly
---
I think the cooldown should be removed entirely
---
Me: A Cancer
---
Fewer skillchecks, probably
---
lol $359.99
---
Oh, I know.
---
I love it, make one for his horse!!
---
What do you mean "turns the game into a movie when exposed"
---
Ayup. Not even expecting sales to go through tbh.
---
Ohh yes red ranks would be even more fun more my nurse if I got to play her!
---
Nah, that was just a small transition buff where it makes the walking speed transition better.
---
Killer: "B-but you promised, that if i didn't facecamp or use NoED, you wouldn't DC"
---
Nea: "Know your place. Such a deal is obviously too good to be true for a man like you"
---
Killer: "YOU SICK BASTAAA-"
---
So your fine with the mechanic being in the game as long as its not being used against you? Telling him to "Mori them all" but don't use it against "survivors that play fairly like you"? Sounds legit.
---
How college feels .-.
---
Doin‚Äô the Wraith thing, yup. Maybe if he was like a Figma or a Nendoroid with movable poses and faces, that‚Äôd be handy.
---
I really like the affect but I understand the need for making dead hard more reliable instead of pressing e and then nothing happening although I still like it right now.
---
The stutter makes no point just makes your post obnoxious to read, is my point.

Permission to repost tomorrow with a different title saying "Sorry if repost, but it was too good not to"?
---
Pallet loop requiem!
---
Maybe. It still seems a little light to me because when I say extend gen time I mean really extend it.
---
It's completely unscientific. Astrology is unfalsifiable.
---
Btw it has been tested, that ppl were given their horoscopes, and asked to rate it, whether it fits them or not, and all of them rated it fits them perfectly.... Only to reveal, that they were actually given the wrong horoscopes intentionally, and unsurprisingly they still believed it, because that's how these things are designed by conmen.
---
It happens breh
---
That‚Äôs me except it‚Äôs my nuts
---
This is how we escape the entitys realm boys
---
Yo where did you get that cool stridor image.
---
I'd find matches right away as a solo survivor. This update for Bill seemed to have messed something up because we're back at long wait times. Sigh...
---
Because apparently people that use mori's are "Assholes"
---
It's fun to play a killer to level them up tho. IMO
---
Myers spelled correctly twice in a row? A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Poised is really good.
---
"Sorry, Daddy" ends toxic messages every time.
---
You fucking killed her dude
---
I usually go for a green restraint + calm/order when I play doctor.
---
Yes because ochido and his fans are toxic fucks that ruin the games for others.
---
I pointed out that I find it obnoxious. How many times would you like me to tell you that?
---
They all look like they do crack.
---
Well you have lucky rng then.
---
I realized that past a certain rank on ps4 nobody goes for saves so I task myself with doing it and avoid getting caught first.
---
I think she crawled and someone driving on the road saw and called for help.
---
Omg devs plssss nerf
---
BING BONG Daze... There's only one reason you DC'd. You pissed me off.
---
Fuuuck that was smooth as hell and must‚Äôve been scary to see happen from Kate‚Äôs perspective. I really want to try this myself
---
I swear the shrine is either amazing or just plajn awful. Shrine rework when devs?
---
Maybe make it so spending shards actually gives more bloodpoints or starters?
---
FUBAR? More like FUBARM.
---
It takes a bit to expose him and he must‚Äôve been stalking u earlier
---
You can apply that logic to ruin though, no? Its useless when it gets destroyed which is usually less than 2 minutes
---
Thanks for not stating any reasoning at all for why you disagree with me. And rather focus on calling me out for using bad persuasion tactics. You really helped us all.
---
What I commented on was you talking about how they can Mori the whole team and still get enough bp to max out a bloodweb.
---
She got moried by that truck
---
Eh i don‚Äôt mind if they did
---
Camping is eithe easily counterable or strategic. The only difficulty of camping is trying to resist feeding it. But yeah toxic players suck
---
I'd color code them or something but that'd be an issue for people with colorblindness.
---
When you‚Äôre confident in your skills as killer and would rather not rely on an RNG perk to slow the game down. I‚Äôve seen streamers start doing it. I still use Ruin because its easier and simpler but combos like Thrilling Tremors+Pop are looking a lot better.
---
Adrenaline procs on the completion of the last gen, not when gates are powered.
---
That moment when people straight up forget the radius the game counts for camping has been mapped out by killers who base all their sacrifice points on camping and camping from outside of that radius and dashing back to the hook isn‚Äôt difficult and is a commonly used strategy even
---
Yeah I tried that it didn‚Äôt work still.
---
adrenaline activates when the last gen is finished. That's when you heal and get the speed boost not when the gate is opened.
---
I'm pretty close to equipping Hex: Memeless Mode because 50% of the memes are Shirtless Myers, 25% "When you do hex totem and it's Haunted Grounds", 15% Mommy Huntress, and 5% Nea is a killer, and remaining 5% are genuinely funny and creative memes. Used to include Freddy being a weak killer.
---
Thanks! I used foam modeling clay for the spikes and cotton and liquid latex to "glue" them on.
---
100% my energy whenever I see a Nurse at all. No reason to even try it she‚Äôs any good üôÑ
---
Okay bud
---
Not at all. Not everyone likes a sweaty game with no ruin. Of course if you dont care about that then sure its fine.
---
The best advice i can give you is play, the more you play the better You'll get at the game both killer and survivor also it Doesn't hurt to watch streamers play and pick up on things they do quite alot
---
I level nurse two weeks ago to get it. I‚Äôve been saving up for it.
---
I believe he means as killer
---
Discordance gives more than surveillance does and unlike with Surveillance, a survivor can‚Äôt tap it then run away because you‚Äôll still know there‚Äôs probably one survivor still working on the generator.
---
Cuz then you have nothing during a chase or any tracking perk
---
Until they cleanse five seconds into the game
---
I literally said this exact same idea to a couple guys I played with a month or so ago! Are you one of them taking my idea? Lol take my upvote
---
Actual rip in chat
---
*Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult labour, which his mother wouldn't survive. This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father's resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.*
---
*With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers' barbs and the feeling of softness as he ran them over his lips.* 
---
Sure, he's a fuckin weirdo, but his parents, specifically his dad, didn't help the situation much. Lore seems to lead to the fact that his weird obsession developed because of loneliness during his childhood.
---
Oh don't worry, this bug happened before the EGC was a thing and no; it wasn't interesting watching the pre-nerf DS using P3 Claudette tbag from behind the gate for 30 minutes.
---
Honestly, I'm a killer main and I despise the fact that ruin is pretty much mandatory at this point.
---
Trolled by the entity
---
I can't run Ruin. It'd be too hard for the survivors.
---
Everybody gangsta till the spirit start speeding towards you while invisible
---
Soft would be getting offended, op just doesn‚Äôt enjoy unnecessary toxicity
---
Did I stutter? Every. Character.
---
Have the developers commented at all on the "Did You Have Fun" match rating system? It's easy to think that it serves no purpose other than to appease us at the end of the match making us feel like we are heard. Maybe I'm too pessimistic? I'm sure the statistics would be at least somewhat useful. Comments?
---
It‚Äôs a game. Yes
---
Yeah which I think would be a very small chance.
---
Except it‚Äôs a game and that‚Äôs not true
---
In my experience, they usually leave Huntress‚Äô Lullaby totems standing a lot more than Ruin totems. Leaving it is all fun and games until the Madness Tier 3 begins.
---
Except he is
---
I‚Äôve had plenty of survivors break a totem thinking its ruin or devour and boom, GG lullaby. Survivors who leave it are just underestimating it or think its haunted grounds
---
A Michael got mad because we did 2 gens in 1 min so he face camped a guy, which we did the rest which for some reason REALLY pissed him off. Remember kids, the main objective is to d I e
---
Do you happen to know if it‚Äôs just louder, or from further away too?
---
üî•üî•uüî•üî•

I believe just louder, but dont quote me on that
---
Nice that

Any perks to make him quieter. He‚Äôs loud if you can‚Äôt tell.
---
FREDDY IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE L. L FOR LIIIIITTTTTYYYY BOIIIZZZZZZ
---
Oh, rad! Yeah, I agree! :0
---
Why does everyone seem to like Nea so much? Every DBD youtuber I watch has Nea as their main girl and favorite survivor. Is it because of her background story? Or her cosmetics, despite there being lots of bright ones? I personally find her distasteful but that‚Äôs just my shitty opinion lol
---
It's like he didn't even read your first comment. Just wanted to be reactionary and start a fight.
---
Feng Min is the smallest but not the quietest. The quietist is Ace but he‚Äôs a male so he‚Äôs gonna be bigger than Feng Min.
---
Free de-pip for everyone :D (happens if a killer leaves early game on Xbox, idk if pc has the issue)
---
Wait what? Seriously?
---
just do gens 4head
---
*Laughs in P3 50 Freddy*
---
Thats why you make big brain plays and use the best ones
---
What if we also had granny as a killer
---
Why is the community so toxic
---
Freddy and the insane asylum. Only because I have the worst luck in those situations
---
Wonder where that lucky soul will be isekaied too... Truck-Kun you‚Äôve done it again!
---
I'm no Trapper main, but here are some suggestions:
---
Whispers is an amazing perk on any Killer, but doubly so on Trapper, so you can know if someone might be watching you set your traps.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse can help you set traps a little closer to Survivors without them immediately knowing you're nearby.
---
Thrill of the Hunt can work as part of memey strategy if you can trap the totem since Survivors might spend more time throwing at the totem and it's defenses instead of just doing gens.
---
Hangman's Trick can be helpful if you anticipate Survivors saboing your traps, but otherwise it's not any more helpful on Trapper than it is on Hag.
---
And of course Nurse's Calling, STBFL, Surveillance, BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, &amp; Spirit Fury are good choices, as with every other M1 Killer.
---
Maybe a texture glitch? It might supposed to have some other image but the devs goofed and gone put drax on the pants
---
This is actually funny and true.
---
I thought this was a joke until I read the comments. You're free to do with your money as you wish but that's a hard pass from me.
---
You play with NOED? xD
---
Swap those two around, and it‚Äôs still accurate.
---
Take a look at this, made by Otz: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uk0OnioNZgLly_Y9pZ1o0p3qYS9-mpknkv3DlkXAxGA/htmlview#
---
If your an altruistic player borrowed time is a must then perks like empathy, botany knowledge would be very strong and other perks like streetwise and vigil would be helpful for the team, and for exhaustion perk potentially would not have to run one and if you did preference is probably the best option.
---
Plague just wanted to help her people ;-;
---
Yeaaaa unfortunately
---
I was going to post my 4k vs a SWF, all ranked 2-6 (I'm ranked 10 on PS4) three with flashlights. I got a little over 31,000 points, then a couple games later I got another SWF, two rank 2s and the other two were low ranks, got 32000. But it's all for nothing. I'm a rank one on Xbox. I'll say this, the red ranks on PS4 are the equivalent to Purple Ranks on Xbox.
---
Spirit: Spends all her time making weird noises
---
Also Spirit: IS SOMEHOW THE STEALTHIEST KILLER IN THE GAME WITH A COUPLE OF BEADS AND A RING
---
Yea got to high rank with my sisters  and the only difference was the wait time for games. Having to wait 20-30mins for a game only to have the killer to see 3 people instantly pop in and leave only to wait again for another 20mins is utter nonsense. So we just demoted back to 18 and goof off, staying near 15-18rank. Don't know why people take this game so seriously like they're training for professional DBD esport or somethin.
---
Hi, Jake Park here I heard you need some hooks repaired. Me and my buddy Dwight can get those hooks off your shoulders in no time... what I‚Äôm saying is fucking around with jakes saboteur is fun 10/10 especially with SWF

Damn this is beautiful. I'd buy it for sure.

This glitch is so annoying and should‚Äôve been fixed with the new patch. Survivors not getting their escape/survival points they‚Äôve earned because of a glitch is bullshiz
---
The alarm clock adding 30 seconds was something I did not know.
---
Sounds like my same experience with IDV too. These
---
games encourage that if you just want to have fun, regardless of killer or survivor, to stay low rank, and not be douchey
---
It‚Äôs been a total shitshow tonight at least on Xbox. Camping and quitting almost every match.  Ironically not one leatherface or pig played like that tonight either. They must be trying new killers

I third. It's just so goofy but muscular shirtless David with his pecs as the wrist-rest/cushion sounds kind of clever.

At least I know other Xbox players have it happening to them. I don‚Äôt know about pc switch or ps4
---
thank u :)
---
ahh . here we go again
---
I used to be rank 1 as survivor, now I hover around 5-9 since I don't play enough. Last two weeks I was put (solo) against two legit rank 20 killers. By legit I mean it was clear that it wasn't just people who haven't played in a few months, but very clearly those were new players and had no idea what they were doing yet. I was pissed off for them, how in the fuck does the matchmaking algorithm even allow for that? I had no business being in those lobbies.
---
We are gonna live forever.. plus 100% bp in all categories offering.
---
no it isn‚Äôt, no scratch marks for 8 seconds after completing a gen is negligible and only bad killers go towards finished gens (unless they‚Äôre ~20 meters away from it)
---
ITS IN WORDS
---
Corrupt intervention to help you setup traps at the start
---
Very good and accurate review. Dead By Daylight is a very hard game to balance. The devs can‚Äôt keep everyone happy. I know a number of things are being fixed this year and the upcoming. But as a player who has over 3000 hours, you kind of just accept the broken features of this game. Sometimes I run to a window knowing I should be able to make it without getting hit, saying to myself, ‚ÄúI know, 100%, I‚Äôm getting hit here.‚Äù 
---
I have high hope hotboxes and all of that do get fixed in the near future but until then, you just have to accept the bs. 
---
I still really like playing this game after all of those hours. It has its ups and downs.
---
Well he meda himself look like a dumbass
---
You're not wrong. However, Ruin can also be completely removed by just destroying it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Risk vs Reward is all it is. Ruin has a great effect that no matter what WILL slow down the generator repair speed when active. However, it can get destroyed as with any hex perk it can get taken out early on and it's useless. Other anti-generator perks might not be as powerful, but also don't run off pure luck that it doesn't get taken out.
---
Because then you have two perks that are gone after the first two minutes.

No Mither, Self Care, Object of Obsession, Adrenaline

I‚Äôm honestly hoping it‚Äôs a typo cuz that much money makes no sense.
---
I legit got it at the same time as you. I feel like it really does suits my altruistic play style.
---
I think most people who have problems with instadown addons and moris off first hook have problems moreso with the fact that that game is an unenjoyable waste of time.
---
If they removed the cooldown entirely, it would be abusable. It should be short, but it should have a cooldown.

Idk but trash quality often enhances the experience for me

I hate Hag because her traps always scare the shit out of me.

And Gideon Meat Plant is just a shit map

Now to paint the rest of the killers and line the entry hallway of your house with them. Set the mood for visitors.
---
Tracking perks still slow the game down. Surveillance, Discordance and Tremors all get survivors off of gens, and being able to consistently keep multiple generators regressing at a time with Surveillance can also be huge.
---
She's barely a viable killer. I have to run NOED or else I'll get t-bagged at the exit gate. She's very inconsistent with how the game goes. I could get an easy 4k with 7-8 ranks one game and I get  destroyed by the same ranks another. Although let's face it. You're lucky if you don't get a red rank in your game as killer.
---
I usually play with my friends who are around these ranks, and I'm rank 8. I can definitely say getting ranked with green ranks is weird
---
Maybe technician xD
---
He is black and epic
---
The perk also makes gen repair quieter.
---
It already reduces the range of repair noise on gens..
---
I just don't want The Pig to get nerfed for no reason ‡ºº;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂ €ù ‡ºé‡∫∂‡ºΩ
---
Honestly I just camp the gate and wait for the killer to close the hatch then instantly start opening the gate and cross my fingers he chooses the other one.
---
It's 50/50 and there's not much potential for user error and I like those odds
---
I agree, it can also be fun to run and I'm not talking about insidious facecamp.
---
Example one of my favorite bubba plays...
---
Game map chased a survivor off the bathroom gen twice so the 3rd time I kicked it I stood in the little shower alcove next to the gen and waited about 10 seconds later survivor comes back and when I heard the gen being worked on I popped out and got the grab right off the gen.
---
Stuff like that if you can predict where the may go next and get a good jump scare.
---
May not be best for map pressure but it is fun.
---
It took months for PS4 to settle down and unlike Plus who knows how long DBD will be on gamepass. Since it‚Äôs popular, they‚Äôll probably keep it awhile. The only upside is that matches aren‚Äôt taking forever below rank 10 and that‚Äôs something.
---
I covered wars you know
---
Get your Jake Paul ass out of here
---
Some countries do dates differently. Some are dd/mm/yy, some are mm/dd/yy and so on. Pretty sure they expire on the 6th of August (might vary depending on where you live).
---
The spirit:
---
Rin studied education in a private university, homewever, the debt was growing, and when her mother became sick, the debt was overgrowing
---
No matter what the family did, it was futile, the father was getting overflowed with chaos, and once fired, it started to beat the wife, and a giant katana killed her, the father looked at her daughter, killing her too, making her fall from the window
---
The desire of revenge started to grow more than any bill, the entity answered her call, and became something else, a dark mist was coming, but waited, as the spirit fullfilled her wish, never to be seen again
---
Summing up the others
---
Frank was a light in the dark, despite his parent fighting, no matter what he do to escape, his family was always... Not good people
---
Once transferred in ormmond, he meet a beautiful girl, some friends, who shared a terrible life, and became vandalists, and frank was the leader
---
One day, they decided to vandalize the store joe was fired from, sneaking inside easily, the janitor who was still there grabbed susie, voices in the dark made frank stab said janitor to death.
---
They had to hide the body, but, as soon as thry leaved town, a black mist swallowed the group
---
I run premonition and spine chill bc I'm still kinda learning how to play stealthy and I like early warnings bc otherwise I always get jumpscared off of gens but the meat plant always ruins how they work so I always get caught off guard
---
It'd be cool but Predator is getting his own game soon.
---
every pvp gaming community has a toxic side to it.
---
I‚Äî ... I LOVE THIS AAAAAAAAAAA
---
You play Doctor by any chance?
---
this is a thing?
---
The perfect end for Kira
---
My rank has been constantly dropping when killers like camping leatherfaces do this so for me it‚Äôs more a case of hiding and trying to do gens before he comes around and run for my life and hope I get my safety pip
---
Playing well is being well-rounded.
---
I love the system personally
---
Good one
---
I‚Äôll do as many gens as I can while my team tries to go in for a save but I don‚Äôt do good at getting away from killers unless I have sprint burst. The only way I have of telling them the killer is camping is using kindred and hoping they either know how to work together and save or gen rush
---
Godly art lmao
---
I have more of a problem with NOED than ruin. Ruin isn't that bad.
---
Goddamnit I fucking knew there would be 3 free perks and I called it last time. This shit is absurd.
---
AUGghaAh
---
It's a gorgeous sculpt, but damn 350 sure takes a bite. Dunno if I could justify it. I do love it tho.
---
Can't hit skillchecks
---
Haven't played much dbd lately, when did they add the ability for Freddy to teleport?
---
Battle Tendency theme just started in my head

Never watched the show but this would still be a good chapter
---
The optimal way to experience dead by daylight
---
Oh? Were you wondering why I was eating those „ÄåROCKS„Äç? It helps with digestion, you know.
---
Especially when others stack onto it with their 100% bonus to all survivors
---
Survivors complaining about ruin are fucking babies. Whine about pink mori cause that shit fucking sucks.
---
As a killer player mostly, I can give more input on killers, especially since everyone has their own favorite killers and at later levels survivors are essentially just skins, but killers keep their unique styles of play. Thus, it‚Äôs usually more important for people to click with a Killer than a survivor to have fun. I can enjoy playing with any survivor, but will hate my life if I try to play Hillbilly at my rank.
---
I‚Äôd suggest trying out each killer a couple of games. Some killers that are widely enjoyed are Myers (The Shape), Hillbilly, Spirit, Hag, and Ghostface. These five are generally viable killers, meaning you can face competent survivors and still have a chance to win, while also being fun to play.
---
If you want to play the game purely in the optimal sense, level up Leatherface first to unlock teachable BBQ and Chili and get it on all your killers. It basically doubles your BP (upgrade money) and is a decent perk on its own. Next ones would be Hag for Hex: Ruin which is almost necessary in high level play due to the amount it slows generators, Nurse for Nurse‚Äôs Calling, and Clown for Bamboozle and Pop.
---
If you want to play survivors for fun, try all of the unique perks and see which ones are your favorite. Level up those survivors until you unlock their teachable perks so all your survivors can have the perks you like. Just as an example, my favorite perk is Dead Hard and I use it on literally everyone. 
---
For playing survivors optimally, Claudette is the best and there‚Äôs no question. Her dark skin and outfits as well as smaller stature simply make hiding easier than with other survivors. One of her perks, self-care, is also unequivocally the best in the game, as the ability to heal yourself without taking another survivor‚Äôs time is unparalleled. 
---
As a general rule, female survivors are better than male ones because they tend to be smaller, slimmer, and able to hide a little more easily. Meg, Bill, and Dwight have solid perks, but simply pale in direct comparison to Claudette.
---
Happy gaming!
---
Why does he have finger legs
---
F
---
Give us big booby myers pls
---
360s works only on lunge attacks, and I think that lunge attacks don't have aim assistance
---
my feet were on the ground. if a person can't rev a chainsaw and hit me through a window while i'm standing a foot away with my feet on the ground normally, he or she shouldn't be able to just because i vaulted a window beforehand.
---
In rank 1, at the highest level of play, without Ruin on your killer to stall the game a bit at the beginning it‚Äôs almost always a recipe for disaster. Nurse and Spirit are the only two killers that could probably get away without running Ruin at the highest level of play. 
---
I‚Äôm not talking about average survivors, I‚Äôm taking about the best survivors, the top 1% in the red ranks that know what you‚Äôre going to do before you do it, are strong at looping and outplaying their opponent. 
---
If you can‚Äôt handle a game as a survivor with Ruin, I‚Äôm sorry, either you or the people you‚Äôre playing with aren‚Äôt strong at the game.
---
*A small price to pay for salvation*
---
I always find the hatch 9/10 times when I don‚Äôt have a key. With a key 1/1,000,000.  However I do love those times getting away from a camper.
---
I think the dead body is creepy, but shes not underage (I think???)
---
He could believably be given a midtier killer movement speed considering Predator is also a stealth hunter
---
Did he just try and shame you for buying a killer you like?
---
All I know is every time they do that I try and hit them quick I end up only kissing them lol
---
They changed her ambush attack so that it doesn‚Äôt function as a standard attack. So perks that give bonuses to attacks don‚Äôt give that bonus when hitting someone with ambush
---
Vasectomy
---
Lol why should survivors just take the hit for you though? Maybe fun for them is seeing if you miss them when they 360?
---
How come he didnt bleed out?
---
Hey, kinda related: I knew a guy named Kira who felt the impact of an ambulance.
---
I'm not saying stand there I'm saying play fair like a man don't use cheap tricks just means ur bad at the game
---
No, according to survivors rule book noed is OP AF AND SHOULD BE REMOVED, and ADRENALINE is OK but should get a buff
---
Spirit, she's so annoying to go against because she has Gen control, She can mind game at loops, shes just not a killer that's fun to play against
---
Nurse and Billy are kind of the same thing too, but they're the strongest killers so
---
Could it be the overdone meme that people are tired of?
---
No, it can't be, it must be those pesky survivor mains
---
Marge
---
ohhh right
---
Thanks for the warning, you might want to put this on the DBD trade forums, r/DBDTrade as im pretty sure i have seen this mikasa guy around there trying to sell accounts.
---
Why do generator's get blocked by the entity at the start of the game sometimes? Is it a perk?
---
Ps4 has had DLC twice in the past couple months. Last year it was not so often. Ghostface has not gone on sale yet though.
---
Make predator survivor then.
---
nurse or spirit on any small map like gideon its always will be a pointless game
---
Getting fucked with every other patch is really getting old at this point.
---
Sometimes when I play Surv with friends and the killer doesn't have NOED, I let then take a hit on me so they get more points.
---
Maybe even work in a killer if they can
---
I‚Äôm just a huge fan, I don‚Äôt wanna see them represented poorly.
---
Easy to say that when you‚Äôre not the one being killed lol
---
I played against a hag today with no ruin and she was level 2 (I Guess new or prestige) after the whole match me getting tunnel surprisingly she had NOED and which I got face camped and my whole team left. Sad life
---
Lmao, 360s aren't cheap. That's like saying insta downs are cheap
---
If they're spinning, try to turn with them and hit them at the end of the turn.
---
Perhaps.
---
Uninstall then reinstall
---
Now I don‚Äôt feel so bad for tunneling and mori‚Äôing him a few weeks ago
---
Ahh, finally, the buff the survivors have been asking for
---
Man just give me pop goes and ruin :(
---
I wanna make a slow game build with them + sloppy butcher and thanatophiba
---
So it depends when I play?  I'm from the UK which probably means I have less chance of finding a lobby too?
---
I just started playing killer
---
Rank 20
---
Imagine only meeting Rank 8 survivors
---
For every 4k i get memed on in the next game
---
so the one where Claudette is ON A BUS and gets lost in the woods.. lol...
---
Smoker. That gotcha grab would be sick if on the second floor while survivor on the first floor.
---
dont rely on 360s as a survivor
---
Any perks that encourage you to injure multiple survivors are decent options for a fourth perk or even making a whole build based off them. If you're running distressing for a 3 gen build, you can throw in coulrophobia and run addons that mangle or injure them for disabling. Or just monitor with Nurse's calling/stridor.
---
If you're going for sneaky trap placement instead of just purely blocking loops/vaults, you can get a lot more injuries going quickly.
---
I had a game with Freddy, he had ruin, and the damn totem spawned right in the middle of a cluster of bushes, and we couldn't get to it. (It was Badham Preschool 2, I believe.)
---
NGL, I literally do not give any amount of shit for yet another Feng Skin that‚Äôs just conceptually... I mean what even IS that?  It‚Äôs a bunch of disjointed nonsense.
---
Meanwhile, I‚Äôm SUPER excited for the new Clown skin.  It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs thematically appropriate, and it‚Äôll encourage people to play an underutilized killer.  Not sure if I‚Äôm excited enough to buy it (I don‚Äôt buy cosmetic DLC on general principle) but once I see it in game I may be swayed.
---
Heh, you‚Äôre talking like I don‚Äôt wanna die, but if 4 dudes pulled up and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sacrificing you to Ra.‚Äù You bet your ass I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄúLemme take a shower, and eat a bagel, I don‚Äôt think Ra wants a smelly sacrifice. I need like 3 minutes write my will too.‚Äù *Writes ‚Äúall my worldly possessions go to my dog.‚Äù* ‚ÄúAlright, Lets die lads.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how entity works

Plagues teachable called Corrupt Intervention. Tier 1 80 seconds block time, Tier 2 100 seconds block time and Tier 3 120 seconds block time.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
In my opinion he shouldnt be part of the DBD community anymore. 1. He sells hacked accounts. 2. He sells hacked accounts as legit accounts (Scam). 3. He violates the Steam User Agreement and the DBD rules by promoting hacked accounts instead of reporting them. He is not better than any hacker in DBD, he is actually worse since he cheats on his community.  
---
Tunneling and Mori for him? Well, maybe that was karma \^\^
---
There‚Äôs no such thing as a sweaty game with or without ruin, ruin is just a lazy mans crutch, and with more and more good stall perks being released, Ruin is fading into obscurity in higher ranks.
---
Yes, its Corrupt Intervention, blocks the 3 further gen from the killers spawn for 120 seconds at level 3. Its a teachable from Plague.
---
See you in a few days ;)
---
But srsly, the game has many issues. Then again, so does every online game. The game has become much more well balanced over the last few months.
---
Here's something to consider:
---
On PC, players have instant acess to 7 Survivors (Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake, Nea, David) and 5 Killers (Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, Huntress). 
---
This means Survivors have guaranteed access to the following top-tier perks: Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, Self Care, Prove Thyself, Balanced Landing and Dead Hard. Meanwhile, Killers have access to: Enduring and Nurse's Calling...
---
Actually sometimes they give more specific information, but still common enough so people will identify with it. making them more beliavable.
---
You have no idea how perk works.
---
Here is a snip from Poised description:
---
"After a Generator is completed"
---
For comparison, here is a snip from Dark Sense:
---
"Each time you complete a Generator"
---
Get it?
---
Lol I feel like a lot of people won‚Äôt get the reference this is amazing tho
---
No worries my friend. I'm on pc. Sorry you got screwed though. Never a fun time being farmed. &lt;3
---
I am a survivor main and a cancer that will fucking destroy any teammates that type stupid shit like that
---
Just go die
---
What a gentleman.
---
I don't understand how he didn't go into shock.
---
Bubba (leatherface) is also another victim (in the 2 original films)
---
Swf
---
You're very welcome :)
---
The actress certainly did a great job sounding like her at least
---
Lol I‚Äôve played against so many killers that quit if the ruin is cleansed in the first few minutes. Waaaaahhh they cleansed my ruin, waaaaahhh he has DS waaaaahhh they‚Äôre playing together with friends like normal people who aren‚Äôt socially awkward and weird like us waaaaahhh.
---
What about shirtless kate?
---
I haven't been keeping up with the DBD news as much as I used to. Did the devs say what the DC punishments would be?
---
Well he has to spend the time trapping the gates in the first place which puts him at risk of you either opening the other exit or gens being completed
---
The Trapper was tortured by the Entity to kill I think, he has some of the Entity stuck in his arms lmao and also Benedict Baker talks about the Entity torturing the killers to make them kill.
---
.. try *not* going for a hit immediately when they do it.
---
Often they'll end up just flopping around like a headless chicken
---
trans gals be like:
---
That was based on real life events. The west was fucking crazy sometimes.
---
Irene?
---
I'll facecamp him in every match I meet him in from now on.
---
Also in case you don‚Äôt have any perk that helps you with opening the exit gate faster, one thing i like to do is start on a gate and stop right before the first red light turns on and then wait for the killer to come back and when they leave continue to open the exit gate and it should help you escape. I‚Äôm always in situations where the exit gate is around 80-90% and get fucked and this strat has helped me out a lot
---
I had to catch 3 survivors in bear traps with my level 7 trapper at rank 10 faced 2SWF Nea one with lantern one with insta heal both got treapped and killed xD
---
Bans. Like R6 Siege or CS:GO.  You DC you can't matchmake for X time. Also the ragequitter turns into a husk/dummy which can be hooked or (hopefully) Mori'd.
---
Yeah I can see that
---
considering they have lvl 3 perks and you only have 3 equipped perks
---
^(F)
---
You must not play legion but it can be pretty easy to lose a survivor once you get out of frenzy because you can‚Äôt see scratch marks while using frenzy. Also the power only works when they‚Äôre out of your terror radius.
---
How come?
---
Ikr, thats why I was always a bit freaked out by his design. I though it was metal bars entwined in his skin and thats what made sense cuz he has metal traps
---
that's why this new hatch system sucks ass. it's the same as it used to be just now it's more random and stupid. if a killer plays a perfect game and 3 people are dead at 5 gens, then you just have to play a 50/50 game of who finds hatch first which it's completely stupid in itself, because God knows it's screwed me out of multiple adepts. not only that but it sucks for survivors too. the system is no different if not worse than it was before and I hate it with a passion
---
i just feel underwhelmed when i see a killer with lullaby
---
It's like this with every other killer unfortunately since 2 killers are actually strong and can do shit
---
I must not play legion but the legion main can‚Äôt follow people. So YOU‚ÄôRE bad at tracking, therefore the power is useless. Riiiight. 
---
The power is the free first hit and ability to slow the game down. Your lack of tracking skill doesn‚Äôt mean the power sucks.
---
Ouch
---
Like brand new parts are any good
---
It actually depends on how fast the survivors get the generators rolling, if they play it smart and wait for you to finish a patrol first, they can crank out all five generators just over two minutes (technically under two, but you gotta add some travel time).
---
Noed + Bloodwarden can be active for nearly as long as the match, since survivors have to get to the gate and open (20 seconds) and wait out Bloodwarden if you get a hook (60) seconds, plus however long you can delay them from opening the gate before that.
---
You're generally gonna have NOED running for at least 60% of the match (2.5 minutes for generators, 1.5 minutes for gates opening+Bloodwarden) if you run both perks.
---
Can you can still throw on BBQ&amp;C and Ruin.
---
*sad chainsaw noises*
---
Also PC players.to don't pretend you know it true
---
That was actually pretty good
---
People are saying it wasn't "bait" but in this case, it may have been detrimental to fake the teleport as it still uses up your meter, and she coud just continue to loop around the building. Great play nonetheless
---
Damn this takes ages :( but i prob dont got any choice. I freaking love this dumb game
---
I don‚Äôt think a handicapped person could take out an armed squad of soldiers with nothing but throwing hatchets and a big ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù axe. She‚Äôs closer to a fucking Yautja than a human at this point.
---
How do you even manage to do that
---
you cant keep doing that because you take a while to put away your hatchet
---
I haven't heard anything about Korean coming to console. So my guess is you will have to change the language under console settings
---
New Freddy also really loves PGTW.
---
I thought Pig was underpowered?
---
Let me guess you want them to stand still and take it.
---
How much do you play Huntress? 
---
It doesn't always work but if you play super unpredictably you can mess people up really easily
---
Could we get one for the pig?
---
No, no one should complain about people using ruin, it‚Äôs almost required tbh.
---
But NOED ON THE OTHER HAND
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt run ruin and lullaby
---
His fists.
---
Yeah I believe you, legions power is pretty useless against smart survive with friends, maybe they will do a rework but I don‚Äôt really know how they would change his power
---
Wow get a grip you snowflake.
---
If it makes you feel better, she‚Äôs definitely busted from an objective standpoint. She literally counters every means of escape Survivors have (and don‚Äôt say break LOS because that‚Äôs actually unlikely in practice, Nurse will usually find you again) and it just comes down to how long will your mind games work before she gets you. I understand that the whole ‚Äúwhether you win depends on how good Survivors are, not how good you are‚Äù thing is a problem, but it‚Äôs reversed for the Nurse, and that‚Äôs a problem too.
---
It's a 5D bait though, freddy baited the survivor into thinking that he will cancel the teleport so kate just continued running.
---
ruin isn't overpowered, survivors should either push through it or one should do find the totem
---
Go swf and everyone use BPS and we're gonna live forever. I did once and the killer did it too and we got 500% more bloodpoint+100 from WGLF. Got more or less 200000 BP.
---
I'd recommend not actually using it on her. The perk only makes the moans louder, it doesn't make you hear them from further away.
---
It can often mess you up as you will end the phasing because you'll think that the survivor is right in front of you, while in reality they will be nowhere near you.
---
Then again she clearly has enough mental disorders (PTSD, etc) and symptoms of mental illness (pretty much everything she did to the villagers after her mother died) that it's hard to argue against her being effectively mentally handicapped.
---
She doesn't have something like Aspergers or Autism, but we do consider soldiers with mental illnesses to be disabled, so "Anna is mentally disabled" is not a stretch.
---
And tbh that does make it rather creepy.
---
Then it'd just be a griefing tool.
---
It should but there are add ons for freddy that make it so you can't wake up through failed skill checks. One i know for sure is when everyone starts in the dream state as well.
---
The Plague worships a religion that has been dead for millennia, if it even existed in the first place. Religions people still worship are kinda of on rocky ground, because people could flip the fuck out and make a huge fuss or not be bothered. You never know how it‚Äôll turn out and it‚Äôs safer to not even touch on that in games.
---
I just want Steve as a survivor. Instant buy
---
I don‚Äôt think they lost a specific religion but she is a Babylonian (IIRC) Priestess who beats the shit out of people with an incense burner, I‚Äôd say that falls under some sort of religious stuff.
---

"You're not afraid of me?"

"Nope."

---
oooh nmwht about terminator
---
It s a very much needed effect. It represents danger.
---
There won't be any consequences. Nobody would know it's me and what he's doing is over a hundred times worse. They can't prove I'm deliberately targeting him if I just so happened to be facecamping all 4 survivors, what a coinkydink my mouse and keyboard locked up and let everyone else escape after he was dead though.
---
I'm not going to treat someone who violated Dead by Daylight's EULA enough to get banned on multiple accounts "like everyone else".
---
They got *banned* from Dead from Daylight fro their actions on *multiple accounts*; they should not be *playing the game at all*.
---
Facecamping/tunneling/mori'ing them for joining a game that they're not even legally allowed to play because of their EULA violations is totally 100% fair.
---
‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think about you at all‚Äô
---
&gt;makes a post about it
---
As a Survivor main, while NoED can indeed be frustrating - it's very much in the spirit of the horror genre. It's a pretty common trope for the the protagonists to breathe a sigh of relief thinking that they've escaped - only to be brutally butchered a second later. I don't mind it, honestly. And it adds quite an edge when the NoED is somewhere on the map, Endgame is activated, your teammate is getting camped on the hook by the exit gate - and you're the only one left running around trying to find it and rescue them with Borrowed Time before the timer runs out (spoiler: we both died because the totem ended up being at the very end of my search route)
---
Run better perks or get better. I run BBQ, Ruin, STBFL, and Surveillance. I‚Äôm rank 5 and have no problems for the most part.
---
...is that your name
---
I've been practicing alot lately and I've played against all the top tier huntresses. You won't really be able to get people by repeatedly pulling the hatchet unless the loop is very long, like shack. What you should be doing (especially at smaller rectangular loops) is winding up and keep moving through the pallet while aiming the hatchet, then throw it at the upcoming corner, where the survivor will be. Usually you can get a hit
---
Free first hit. 
---
Wound timer isn‚Äôt supposed to mean anything except forcing them to mend. 
---
Most killer add ons are terrible. 
---
4 second cooldown isn‚Äôt bad when you consider that you got a FREE first hit. 
---
You getting juked by a vault is you playing bad. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 
---
Where‚Äôs the rest of this list? Because none of what you just said matters.
---
It works for me on Xbox.
---
This isnt a vait you just used your ability xD when sou bait with his tp, you need to channel it for a while and when they start running to you you just smacc em.
---
The Legion have the best mori and after them there is amanda with her nice hidden blade work.
---
this looks so shite
---
NICE TRY, FBI MAN, BUT THEY‚ÄôRE ALL OF LEGAL AGE!
---
We're sacrificing you to Ra
---
Why? You don't have so much stuff to aim in that game except huntress axe and nurse teleport?
---
Hell yeah.
---
Spine chill does. A spirt once tried to mindgame me at a pallet but I knew what the bitch was doing because of spinechill so I just poked at her until she turned around and phased.
---
I like the exposed effect and retired successful attack hit... Don't flame me guys
---
It's only louder, the distance doesn't increase.
---
Sister Irene is one of the nuns in the movie and since she's the main focus of the movie I'd have loved to see her as a survivor.
---
Just saying buying cosmetics is useless so i get that but 7 wraiths i wish i had such luck BUT the teammate not saveing is anoying because it shows they dont give 2 shits about you.
---
I‚Äôll be honest with you homie, if you did David King with the black cap and donkey jacket in the style of Jotaro it would make my year.
---
I live near the city that it happened in. Spooky.
---
Wait. . . why the fuck is Slenderman NOT a killer in this game wth. . .
---
Claudette has too many cometics
---
&gt;Perk 2: Hidden?: When hiding in lockers you are completely silent when opening and closing them. you exit/enter 30/40/50% faster.
---
Is this only for slow entering? It's probably a little too strong with the faster percentages
---
&gt;Survivor Perk: I love you! OR Save me!: After unhooking a survivor you can take a hit 1/2 per trial
---
This is probably also too strong it just seems like a way better version of mettle of man but honestly i feel like they should buff mettle of man to include hook saves and it would be balanced
---
&gt; Iridescent Hacksaw-Blade. Instantly sabotage a hook at the cost of your toolbox. Only available on green toolboxes and up.
---
I support this I really like the idea and the potential but killers would definitely complain.
---
I dunno man Legion is kind of just a bunch of asshole teens.
---
Only one of them actually killed someone pre - trials, though. Suzie is literally nothing but an edgy teen.
---
Huh... didn‚Äôt notice that there.  Oh well üòÇ. Yes.  Yes it is.
---
She got off at a stop mid - journey to take a walk in the woods.
---
I like it
---
I used to gentap until some wise guy from the comments taught me.
---
Basically you can prove it yourself, but just doing the gen is faster. You also get used to hit excellent skillchecks, further increasing your speed.
---
Actually, if you can successfully juke the killer and avoid hits that makes you GOOD at the game, not running in the straight line that you need so bad.
---
As a Killer main- Either Huntress (Just not fun to me), or Nurse (Each teleport permanently drops my FPS by like 5 for the duration of a chase), and for maps, I say this having put up with it on both sides at release,
---
Fuck.
---
Mt.
---
Ormond.
---
My FPS did nothing to you to deserve what you do to them.
---
I find every hex completely balanced.  The fact that you can destroy a totem to destroy a perk. What survivor can complain?
---
Yeah and you just follow the babymeg who wastes all the pallets on the map and then you are golden.
---
At least it was an ambulance.
---
I find it eazier to play on concole
---
Noooooo
---
Maybe Hidden? could be changed to 25/30/40%. and yes, only when slow enter/exit because it would be unnecessary for fast entering.
---
The save me! perk can be used to introduced a mettle of man buff.
---
I can see why they would complain. Now that it's brought up, it would completely deplete the toolbox on use. other than that i have no more ideas :(
---
I dont get what you mean by free first hit. Most killers are able to get the same hit around the same time. This is only helpful if you can tag multiple survivors which even then is average since by the time you get the first down anyone you tagged is gone.
---
You just seem like you're mad at a low tier killer.
---
If only trash killers use ruin then only trash survivors have to rely on Self Care.
---
Maybe this is not it, but I encountered two lag switching killers on PS4 a couple of days ago. Everything pauses (my totem cleansing didn‚Äôt show any progress at all when I was on it for a long time) and then all of a sudden a player is down. Someone goes for a successful save and all of a sudden they are both downed although the killer was far away. And then the we are all dead within the first five minutes. Just great..
---
I thought the same initially too but I just had another glitch as well that just threw off my will to play it ill post it in this subreddit
---
‚ÄúReasonable criticism‚Äù!? You called all killers socially awkward crybabies... and then proceeded to be a socially awkward crybaby because your post was so tragically doomed to downvote hell. I agree balance needs to be achieved on both sides but that was NOT what you argued
---
Take my downvote
---
I'm assuming those people don't like playing against doctor
---
Just let them do their account trading. If all goes well they either get scammed or banned and honestly thats a win for many of the legitimate players.
---
I'm trying to get my last trophy for platinum and it's from the void she walks, my question in do you have to chain blink for it to count ? or does the first blink also count towards the 100 ?
---
If you have any more feedback, please PM me, as this is my first time i am willing to learn! Thanks!
---
In no defense to the DCers except being fair, how are they supposed to know the add ons/perks before game? For all they know, it could be hostage doctor.
---
Oh is that what he said? I read it as "youre mad, you're really about to scream." Doesn't help that I'm tired though
---
Gen rush, second chance perks, no selfcare because of communication, all your 3 buddies must know how to loop and hit great skill checks 24/7,and gen rush. Yes, i said that twice.
---
Thats ofc a possible way to handle such a situation. In my opinion such a behavior shouldnt be tolerated. He absolutely knows that this account was hacked and sold it as legit. It took me less than 2 minutes to recognize it was not legit. So I'd say people like him need to leave the community. Better sooner than later - and ingnoring it will lead to a "later", reporting it to a "sooner". Thank you for your input @NoviceCodeQuestions

welcome to dbd ma dud
---
Yea, I was going for Adept Doctor. I was laughing hard though to be honest.
---
I‚Äôd say this is either bait
---
OR
---
that you‚Äôve never played survivor in your life.
---
In the game map
---
More balanced but it definitely still a very strong perk because it's completely silent from any distance without a cooldown
---
The survivor main in me likes it but I can already see the threads of killers complaining about how strong it would be as is
---
Maybe it could like half the distance or just make the sound quieter to a balanced degree
---
+100% isn't the equivalent of times 2 anymore?
---
Alright, i feel like the way you analyse your data is HEAVILY clouded by your state of mind.
---
Regarding killers, your point is "7 times wraith, and an alternation of huntress, pig, and trapper..."
---
... and hag, and billy, and doctor, and freddy. Alright, the last 3 you only met once. But you met the Hag 3 times, which is more then you actually met the pig, and still forgot about her in the alternations.
---
You cant expect to meet all 16 killers in 20 games; granted, the point that you've met the wraith 7 times is interesting, and pretty much the only valod fact based point in the entire post.
---
Regarding maps, you say "the same just recycle over 20 games is ridiculous". You also mention you dont get the Plague's map out of 20 games. Well you also said there are 31 map variatons, so that's statistically no wonder.
---
So let's see if indeed the same maps kept reappearing over and over again 
---
You had 4 wreckers yard, 1 wretched shop, 1 gas heaven, 2 blood lodge. 1 torment creek, 3 rotten fields, 1 thompson house. 1 suffocation pit, 2 coal tower. 1 swamp, 1 springwood, 1 meat plant, 1 ormond. This last 4 you also failed to menti9n in your analysis, altough they take up 20% of your sample size. You also havent seen a map more than 4 times. And the coldwind, macmillan and autohaven type maps have the most variations besides the new freddy maps, so the only surprise there is the fact that you didnt see more springwood.
---
You died 11/20 times. Thats almost a perfect 50%, which is the balance goal of the game, so pretty spot on. You also mentioned i believe how the teammates barely go for saves and you die on first hook; that really has nothing to do with statistics, you're just venting some frustration there again.
---
All in all a sample size of 20 games is pretty low, and altough the effort makes it look like you're trying to be professional about it, you pretty much just ignore the stuff that doesnt back up your point of view, and magnify the stuff that does. The 7 wraiths are tough luck, but again - pretty much the only valid point in your argument; and it still lacks a lot of factors, for example the ranks of the killers.
---
‚ÄúWhat a fun mechanic to play against!
---
/s‚Äù
---
Well I meant both at the same time. If they get cleansed that‚Äôs 2 perk slots gone. I especially don‚Äôt recommend running three hex perks. It‚Äôll leave you with only 1 good perk for the rest of the game. PGTW, Sloppy, Discordance, Thanataphobia, CI, and many others would be good replacements for those totems
---
32 upvotes and no comment? Take my upvote and comment.
---
Jesus, they really should put more DLC perks in here.
---
I have since made some clarifications to said perk. The only killer the perk doesn't apply to go as follow; Trapper, Huntress, Wraith, Legion, and Chainsaw Duo
---
"Oh I got eyes brother"
---
Nothing pisses me off more than this. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible but I often get the feeling that the killer is cooperating with my teammates (maybe they message each other in game?). The worst one is when I don‚Äôt get found by the killer and they are running bond to rat me out. Good times.
---
I still really like the game though, it‚Äôs so addicting. But in moments like these I really need a pause.
---
I also wonder about this. I have the game on Xbox, but my GF says she'd play with me on our Switch if the game had crossplay.
---
Oh boo hoo, now you can't use noed or devour, woe is me, because you know, that's toootally is fair. Nevermind that now if you dash attack the obsession you do not lose stacks from STBFL, because it's not a basic attack. Do you people know anything but whine? How about the recent buff she got? Why aren't you all making hooray memes? I know why, because you'd rather bitch and moan about "nerfs", even when they are necessary changes.
---
Another thing, I feel like if the compass was in the game, maps would be completely useless or just very useless
---
As of now most people use maps to find hatch and rarely use them to see gens or hooks or whatever because most people already know where gens are after memorizing maps to a certain degree. If compass was in the game everyone would use that instead of map. I would like compass if they removed maps maybe or maybe they could buff maps to help with hatch more.
---
Want a medal?
---
Yeah, I could see people spamming this so ill add a cooldown. A cooldown/exhaustion of 50/30 seconds.
---
I know what you mean like when I play its usually always good, but moments like that happen every so often and it just ruins the flow of the game, I had three escapes in a row was looking to make it a forth and that was the start of a downward spiral of glitches and asshole team mates
---
I.... cannot.... escape JJBA..... I‚Äôve only seen a few episodes, but it‚Äôs all over my twitter feed and instagram explore
---
&gt;Guess I won‚Äôt die
---
Ftfy
---
Any download link? Can't find this anywhere.
---
It's everyday bro with the Freddy rework flow
---
To*/You're*
---
lol Maybe if no ones dead and gates are powered, but at that point.... its kinda just pity points...
---
This is really helpful ty so much
---
I think Ruin is fine but seeing it 6 games in a row does drive you a little nutty
---
i want the clown outfit
---
Laugh
---
SMALL GAME GANG disagrees
---
Once when i got farmed by Claudette, the killer (Billy) downed her and hooked her. We both spent good 30 secs noding at her for farming without BT. He then let me run away and left the hook, the rest of the match playing like nothing happened :D
---
By reposting do you mean mirroring it to other friends/xposting or just reposting it?
---
Maybe but The nun I doubt will ever be in game, But she'd probably make it as DLC somewhere with Year 5, Because the nest supposed DLC is stranger things or hellraiser.
---
Sounding like they got heart failure lmao
---
Art belongs to  [https://askashleyjohannawilliams.tumblr.com/](https://askashleyjohannawilliams.tumblr.com/) , I have no talent whatsoever!

Generally when there‚Äôs cross platform play, it‚Äôs optional. So if a PS4 player joins a PC player, they get put into PC servers. If you solo queue, you stay in the console pool.
---
idk about y‚Äôall but when me and my friends see a NOED we get excited cause we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs gonna get clapped and who isn‚Äôt, it honestly brings scary amounts of fun to the end game
---
I complain about ruin because my random teammates are so terrible that I'm forced to go find it as well, and sometimes it can hold the game up for too long and hand the killer a free undeserved 4K game.
---
¬ø?????????
---
Don‚Äôt go with Meg right now, I swear her breathing is messed up because it is so fucking loud and when she‚Äôs injured she‚Äôs even louder. Jane is like a porn star when injured. Don‚Äôt fall for the booty, she is LOUD and you will die from the porn moans she makes when you try to hide. David is pretty good from what I‚Äôve seen in trials,(he‚Äôs not super loud. I‚Äôve never played him so I‚Äôm not 100% on that) iron will makes him even better and Ace is, I swear to god a ninja when injured, man makes no sound. I tried to find an injured Ace to heal and walked past him 3 times before I figured out where he was hidden. Claudette is good for blending but she‚Äôs kinda loud? It‚Äôs hard to hear on maps with lots of background noise but it‚Äôs audible enough that you may get caught if the killer is really good(and has a decent set of headphones)

Hi u/not_Queen_bhrv, the issue is that some perks are missing some numbers like seconds, meters and tokens. I made a imgur album that shows which perks were affected, unfortunately I couldn't get a photo of any daily rituals that also had the issue.

He literally banned me for saying ‚ÄúSurvivors op pls nerf‚Äù after he went down. It was just a joke lol. I can‚Äôt stand the fact that he hearts every comment agreeing with him that boost his ego. He‚Äôs good at the game, but I just saw him shittalking youtubers like Otz and Monto, like why? He thinks he‚Äôs a god at this game and that no one else can have an opinion or they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot a red ranks‚Äù. 
---
He was the first youtuber I started watching when I started playing and liked him because he provided information I didn‚Äôt know yet. Last few months his behaviour just pisses me off
---
U mean ADRENALINE SHOULD STAY LIKE IT IS and NOED SHOULD HAVE THE EXPOSED STATUS EFFECT ALREADY WHEN ALL GENS ARE POPPED, NOT AFTER THE KILLER HIT A SURVIVOR...?
---
Well, easy achievement for you
---
THICKK
---
Well you would compare the average in such a case.
---
Imagine seeing a week without daily 10 memes about adrenaline and noed.
---
Sit their and just look at their screen. Be slightly surprised when no one even attempts to save.
---
Alot of the time BHVR choses to go with the Slightly/Moderately because the values tend to be small and it makes add-ons seem more useful than they actually are, similar to Leatherfaces acceleration add-ons that effectively do nothing. 
---
Outdoor rope according to the wiki is 6%
---
Jump rope is 9%
---
Swing chains is 9% per survivor sleeping making it 36% at max I believe. Since its slightly at awake survivors its probably 3%.
---
Yes, in fact it often makes the game go from bad, to literally unwinnable. I'm find with ruin conceptually, but the fact that totem RNG is involved actually breaks the perk very often.
---
Nobody:

---
Nea's Bizarre Adventure sounds like something I'd find on r/dbdgonewild
---
True, but you see it less at the higher ranks.
---
*doesnt see the shitpost tag*
---
NOED is also a waste of a perk slot if you break all the totems
---
I cant wait for the archives to learn more about their story.
---
That terrified look on her face is adorbs!
---
They usually walk into it right after I dead hard over it then they get a pallet to the face for their trouble lol
---
I agree with the 1st part of your post, but no game should ever ban players for comments, regardless of how severe they are.
---
Working?
---
Which isn't at all troublesome? I'm not sure I see the complaint.
---
I'm still wondering why they couldn't give Legion something like Nurses fatigue sound
---
It's not true, it's bullshit, i was not camping, I W A S N O T
---
Im not home yet fam gonna tell ya when i got the time for it
---
Gen tapping is up there with immersed teammates on the list of things I hate.

---
B A R E B O N E S (gamemode from COD where you cant see most, if not all, of the hud)
---
Ah yes. P3 Claudettes rushing saves and Urban Evasioning away &lt;3
---
They should change noed to be a token based perk instead of a hex perk. Gain a token for every hook and 2 tokens=1 instadown, for a total of 8 tokens possible, after the gates are powered. This way it would reward killers for doing their objective.
---
There was a bug that you could spawn in with no hud so could‚Äôve been that or he just a potato
---
It's good to play as the one you want to level though, helps a lot with figuring out potential counters and generally getting you out of your comfort zone and forcing you to learn new playstyles. 
---
Ofc i'm not saying to do the whole grind, i usually level each killer to 10 before i've even touched them so i can at least field 3 perks from the get-go, and then do the rest of the grind manually.
---
Dear mother of God
---
One day, it'll change...
---
i feel like legion is just a bunch of kids that even Dwight can knock out clear with 1 punch.. theyre not scary, not from a horror standpoint and not from a game perspective.. just like GF i wish they were removed
---
here's how you can use the power. if you run Discordance, wait for it to pop, once it does, go to the gen and use the power when you get close enough. ( don't get too close though, the terror radius wil alert them, obviously... )
---
You know that they'd just kill themselves on hook? It wouldn't make any real difference.
---
If 3 survivors want out of the match, the end result would be exactly the same. They'd all run at the killer and point at a hook, get downed, hooked and sacrificed.
---
Legion can get a first hit but after that hit power is obsolete. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs bad.
---
A good survivor can tell you have surveillance if you hit the Overcharge but you still go back to the gen to check if someone is on it.
---
now you will find angry people who are insulted by this meme. to balance it out when you fail at making the killer dc you get the dc instead. oi cunt, balanced now.
---
Easy slowdown build:
---
Ruin
---
Corrupt
---
Sloppy
---
Another perk of choice (PGTW maybe?)
---
Kind of a meme build but gives plenty of time to set traps
---
Where do you get off on acting so high and mighty? I‚Äôm not gonna bother engaging with you, you‚Äôre an arrogant person who embodies everything ‚Äútoxic‚Äù about DbD.
---
From what I am aware all the injured sounds are at the same volume but the way the survivors moan and the tones are all different based on their voice actors and some moan more obstructively as others.
---
Here is a video comparing all their injury sounds.
---

---
Sounds like more if a you problem there, im always finding green
---
Do people even play him? In 50+ hours i've only bumped into 2 doctors(and got my ass handed to me both times since i haven't played against him enough to be able to counter him, and because fr me, hitting skillchecks normally is still not 100% certain, much less his madness ones popping all over the screen). I'd normally assume he is more used in higher ranks, but the higher ranks can hit skillchecks way easier than the mid/low ones, so he shouldn't be as debilitating against them.
---
Because it's not a basic attack. That's like asking Why can't you down exposed people using Feral Frenzy. Y'all downvote me all you want, but I am right.
---
You're trolling and I realised only know, fml. Diversion should've been a clue xD
---
Not funny didn't laugh
---
It‚Äòs not troublesome if you‚Äòre a great survivor
---
And not equip slippery meat
---
this is dwight's final form, this is why he stood in the locket for so much time, the entity tried to not making him use it by moving it to another survivor, but dwight is friend with everyone so his homie jake unlocked it, making dwight achiving ultimate power
---
That sucks :,( but yeah that‚Äôs hilarious to watch  XD
---
Memes like this should be banned from the sub
---
I will now proceed to alt+f4 on the world‚Äôs smallest keyboard.
---
I broke all the buttons.
---
POYO!
---
That's on an arm... please be fake, please be fake, please be fake.
---
Doctor is low tier in higher ranks. This is because his shock doesn't really help with chases, meaning he can be looped for a very long time by survivors. (I know it prevents vaulting, dropping pallets etc - he's my 3rd most played. But survivors can play around that).
---
And hitting skillchecks is commonplace among red ranks. Also why something like overcharge is poor in red ranks.
---
In lower ranks, he's a beast because he can constantly be in a chase, and since survivors are not that good he can actually END said chases, and survivors might also miss skillchecks.
---
You're probably right, it just seems faster because I'm not watching my progress bar shorten
---
Negative.
---
Yea, I don‚Äôt mind if I did. Getting the Adept Challenges in the purple ranks is hard :(
---
One on the left is my arm, right is wife‚Äôs leg üòÇ
---
It was actually ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù before they changed the flair. Don‚Äôt let them fool you
---
I don't know how you can simply assume that, given the amount of work they had to put into their entries. Dismissing them as a "joke" simply because you don't care for them is somewhat rude, to be honest.¬†
---
Could you please explain what BBQ actually does? Because I know it lets you see survivors when hooked but how does it affect blood points?
---
I actually read they over all smoothened out some things relating to her crouch and uncrouch speed so it's not all bad news.
---
Idk what his delay is, but if you refuse to play with a 15 second delay (which negates pretty much all sniping but definitely does if its 30 seconds) and still complain about it... you're wack dawg. 
---
Ever since I went up to a 15 seconds delay on my stuff it got so much easier but I guess I'm mostly playing survivor.
---
When you drop a pallet on Wraith
---
*The hardest choices require the strongest wills*
---
Honestly it‚Äôs rare to find actual nice teammates that talk nicely in game chat... so thanks for being nice! idk why everyone is so adamant about being salty and toxic in this game. XD don‚Äôt stop wishing ppl luck just Bc of a bad egg. Lots of cool ppl on dbd that would wish ya luck back!
---
Also when I bump into nothing as leatherface and survivors flee as I tantrum.
---
I also once hit a David in an open field with the chainsaw. His character screamed and he did a damage animation but didn‚Äôt take any damage, and my game registered a collision so he ran away unscathed as I tantrumed.
---
Perfect game!  Zero Bugs!
---
Can survivors bleed to death whilst the are on the shoulder of the killer?
---
Dick in one hand, mouse on another. Respect brother
---
It said Brutal Killer at the end which means he Black-Pipped, no downrank
---
Ruthless -&gt; 1 pip
---
Merciless -&gt; 2 pips
---
Why does the one on the top look so ugly?
---
A visual glitch?
---
The Nurse can be countered and mindgamed quite easily; you just need a bit of distance. Remember the Nurse always blinks to where she EXPECTS you to be.
---
Don't be there. Stop, turn around. Crouch at a corner. When she gets used to that, that opens up more mindgames.
---
There's nothing wrong with the Nurse (when she doesn't have multiple blinks or range addons). You just have to adapt your gameplay against her.

No offense boss, but you‚Äôre not as big as tru3 is.

---
Everything you described has more to do with the player than the character. The character mechanic is broken, even without add-ons or perks. How broken it will vary from player to player. A lot of Nurses suck, a few don't. These few Nurses that don't suck, there is little you can do against her. 
---
Not every Nurse predicts where you are going, some are very smart with their second blink and just like you, they will adapt to your playstyle. If you start cutting back a lot, they will adapt.
---
I personally enjoy playing against Nurses just because it changes the playstyle from the boring mechanical merry go round to something more thrilling like constant mind-games. Still, the character is far from fine.
---
do you always have a stick up your ass
---
theres no consequences to dc'ing and no one has time to play against doctor on a shit map.
---
Those same survivors are running green toolboxes with speed increase addons
---
i went against a hostage doc earlier today. 2 bloody party streamers were popped so me and my friends didn't dc but we were in a game for at least 30-45 mins. It was not fun at all he just ran around shocked and slugged. We pick up and heal same thing. Its really bs you have to forfeit all of your reward and de pip just because the killer wants to keep hostage.

Most I see are going with the actual full outfits for example a Jake with the grand slammer outfit instead of mixing it up.

I kinda wish Meg had a cheerleader outfit though.

Yeah but still I think her M2 and RBT nerfs are a bad thing. There are other ways RBT and Endgame could be matched together.

They dont even tell you about Pallets or Vaults. LMAO

Wow. You‚Äôre awful at making comparisons. Refrain from them. 
---
You clearly aren‚Äôt understanding, which tells me you‚Äôve never been into his stream. They are sniping his survivor lobbies. They‚Äôre sniping him when he‚Äôs playing Killer. They bring perks to counter to his build or killer/map offerings/and OP items. 
---
So I ask again, how does a delay stop this ^^^^^ from happening when hiding your screen doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Normally I don‚Äôt dc at Moris, I try to play the game bc Moris are in the game, right? I need to learn to play around them? 
---
Get downed, hooked, facecamped, tunnelled immediately off hook. I dced immediately. I tend to dodge moris now bc it pissed me off so much, probably be while before I don‚Äôt dodge em. Y‚Äôall, don‚Äôt be an ass if you bring moris, cause you make survivors that typically won‚Äôt mind them fucking pissed. 
---
The dc was honestly worth the two depip, I don‚Äôt want to give assholes the satisfaction of killing me.

(No I don‚Äôt just play survivor I equally play both).

I could not do all the items seen that it does not exist still but I continued to update it if you want to be informed about the nebula pack look here :[https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nebula\_Perks](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nebula_Perks)
---
Yeah, this is why I usually take out 1 totem and go do something else
---
A PC nurse may wipe the floor with console survivors, but that has nothing to do with them being console because she does the same to PC survivors as well.  There aren't really gameplay differences as survivor between the platforms.  Basically anything a PC survivor can do, a console one can do the same so the only real extra advantage a PC nurse has against console survivors is that the survivors would initially have less experience versus nurse.
---
It would be a terrible idea if killers competed against other killers, as a PC nurse would absolutely have an advantage against a console nurse, but that's not something relevant in this game since there is only 1 killer per match.  
---
Unless survivor moonwalking becomes relevant to the meta, then cross play wouldn't really hurt anyone.  From the killer side of it, it would be impossible to know or really tell a difference.  From the survivor side of it, maybe you would notice better nurses and huntresses but if that's fair against PC survivors (lol, nurse isn't exactly fair against anyone) and a console survivor can do everything a PC survivor can do, then I don't see the harm in making queue times better for everyone, especially if players could opt in/out.
---
Soooooo, it wasn‚Äôt bait then?
---
Oh can you all just fuck off with the bitching
---
Damn what part of the community are you hanging in? All the people I play with and usually run into are wholesome af.
---
Right but you also said killer latency. Latency shouldn‚Äôt affect client side skillchecks .
---
I'll never stop complaining
---
&gt;cries in console
---
I can relate, and everytime you his those great skillchecks you feel like a fuckin GOD
---
Having too much != preferring minimal. You are jumping to conclusions. 
---
Killers having mind game potential is important! Killers like spirit are great for the game imo, but the rank 1 experience on my end suggests that having the ability to neglect all environment elements within 15m (there's not really any chance to lose her and she can 100% stay within that distance unless shes boosted or drastically fucks up) is too much potential since at that point you have no real defense against a killer and you're really 50/50ing over and over till she gets you.
---
I'd get all the bp from the survivors i p3'd and never play back
---
*Finally,

Alt tab and change the spotify playlist

But that's why she's so fun to play against

and Ruin should come in every killer‚Äôs kit together with Franklins
---
I'm sorry, I hope I didn't ruin it for you. You still have your imagination tho! And there are *loads* of equally attracting Myers fanarts out there
---
My opinion thingy
---
Drake No: Only trash killers use ruin
---
Drake Yea: Ruin should be used until the killer knows how to successfully stop generators through applying gen pressure, at which point it should be switched to something that does not rely on luck and that will be of more use and fun to the killer (Red ranks and tombstone + fragrant tuft of hair myers are the exception but otherwise I‚Äôve gotten more use and fun out of other perks, even pop goes the weasel if I want a slower game)
---
not me the other guy
---
Even a useless survivor can get Adrenaline if their teammates are doing all the work.
---
It's so pointlessly boring. You don't chase anyone, you don't down people and hook them, you sit in one spot from the start of the match in treatment mode. 
---
If it helps to cheer you up, the devs recognize this playstyle as holding the game hostage and you can actually get banned for it.
---
The best part is that this build isn't even meant to win the match, if 4 survivors split on different gens and hit the tiny skillchecks, they will eventually win since you dont down anybody. The only way you really win is if everybody gets so bored they dc/afk.
---
Just cleanse the totems, duh. They even give you more points now. Dull Totem before 600, now 1000. It is not hard tho. Equip small game, or if you have Detective's Hunch (Tapp Perk) use that. Complete a gen and you can see the auras of gens and totems in a large area.
---
is it working for you, it isnt for me
---
Take a deep breath dude, it's a discussion. I think he could stop them if he pursued it but it's also good content no? 
---
You disagree, all good man, no need to get pissed off about it. I've stated my points, you've stated yours, I've done my best to address all of yours.
---
I used to watch tru3 a lot b4 the above meme along with his balance rants eventually made it unenjoyable and I stopped watching his content, so I am aware of his stream.
---
I take it you don't play much killer.
---
Well if the two playerbases were merged, PC killers would probably rank higher than console killers so there's that. I think dead by daylight should create a normal mode ( I don't see why this hasn't happened already) where crossplay is possible, so it doesn't influence your rank.
---
r/nonononoyes
---
It's not fun at rank 1 bro, it's definitely not fun for me anyway :(
---
Can't edit/don't know how to on mobile but: I need this as a huntress main haha
---
Pretty sure it's a game with no hooks. Probably due to losing connection it couldn't register how many you got.
---
I think there is a flaw in that fact, as many times I have lost normal skill checks due to low fps, perhaps it isn't direct fps of the game, but the skill check line instead of being nice and smooth will stutter like 5 times across the skill check, and you better pray you hit the check on good; because there's NO way you're getting great.
---
Not Hag lol. I mostly play Michael and Ghostface. But my Friend like religiously plays Hag and runs noed on her. So that's why I said "maybe"
---
Nice xD
---
I dont? 
---
"Cryies looking at trapper and my 2800 hours"
---
I swear the more these shitty memes get reposted the more upvotes they seem to get. Meanwhile some of the funniest memes only have less than 100 upvotes
---
Yeah i mean the counter to noed is 4p swf, have you ever tried cleansing all the totems in a solo game? It can't be done. And it it is done you will personally not have time for anything else.
---
Well I'd rather have collateral damage on minority of players that have connection issues and similar problems if it punishes majority of people that intentionally DC you would not probably because you are one of those people...
---
Man I hate NOED. If I'm a survivor and we got the power on, one of my team gets hit to reveal we're all exposed then I don't hang around to try and save anyone, I just leave.
---
Good meme tho
---
This is awful
---
the totem placements on this map are so good
---
U run Trapper without NOED? I fucking salute you sir/ma'am
---
DBD isn‚Äôt your standard horror though, you have to actually put loads of effort in to escape, it‚Äôs amazing when you get downed because the killer did such a good job losing to be rewarded.
---
Thing is I still often go against survivors that drop pallets instantly, don't know how to loop, etc. at red ranks. I can see what you mean but I wouldn't say you don't get really bad players at red ranks.
---
Are there any way to buy characters without spending any Money???
---
That is very interesting, seems like a good place to start at the least
---
I don‚Äôt think she needs a face rework at all I think Quentin does because he looks like a 80 year old
---
Susie was the innocent one of the group, and honestly she's the scariest. It's pretty messed up how the Entity can change someone so drastically.
---
no not really, i mean i woud avoid the fight at all costs as long as they have knifes, but theyre litterally just 4 teenagers with knives, not some unholy blinking or phasing monster who's bodies are seemingly barely hanging together or pierced with pieces of metal the size of teenagers legs... same goes for GF, hes just a dude with a knife not some unholy monster... basically the rule for me is if i wouldnt be scared of a killer irl, then i dont want to play vs them
---
No speed limiter. I guess he could have had MoM. This was back before the change. He didn‚Äôt get a white aura, but I mean, it‚Äôs DBD... ‚Äúthere was a visual bug on DBD‚Äù is a less shocking statement than ‚Äúthe sky is blue‚Äù.
---
Because it's reddit
---
Insta-heals need to go the way of BNP. It's dumb how a just-downed survivor can go to full health in a *tap*, robbing the killer of a hook/kill.
---
The non-licensed characters can be bought with the shards you get from level ups
---
It's obvious geez
---
If you can reliably hit great skillchecks to bypass ruin you'll finish the gen even faster without ruin, cuz without it great skillchecks award you progress.
---
I mean play as who you want. I don't care, I just think it's stupid to want to remove them from the game just because you don't like them.
---
I would actually no get trash killers teachables since is a nightmare now to get any good perks on new killer.
---
do you by any chance happen to know in which entry Benedict says this?
---
Whats the grind you need to atleast unlock one Character?

bc hes a tiny dude with a knife, if i sit on him irl he would die quicker then i would of the stabwounds

Same here, I don‚Äôt care about new chapters just give me that good lore

I don't know how much they cost, sorry :(

Nah I'm almost positive that it's happened a few times to me way before that, I always chalked it up to a latency problem
---
IMO 5-10 minutes for a game are way too little. Survivors should have to do some more to repair gens like find parts for it and fuel. Anything that keeps them from rushing. I can't blame anyone for rushing gens, it's the objective of the game after all. But it's bad design if a game can be over in 3-4 minutes flat. As a killer i want to actually enjoy taking my time, stalking people, planning things, chasing them around. That's what is fun about the game... I really dislike the stress killers get put under because currently it's "Your try your damn best to get the numbers down by any means or survivors are out before your chainsaw stops revving
---
As a survivormain I don't know wtf the fuss is about with NOED, spirit fury enduring is the real aids in this game, it's MoM/DS for killers, it's like an instaheal for killers everytime they do the amazing play of "walking into a pallet braindeadly" it's the old legion of perk-combos and no I don't respect you if you run this build, feel free to run NOED though, who gives a shit.
---
It's the fact that they fulfil the generic slasher teen trope. A bunch of hooligan kids causing havoc.
---
If yur eating DS‚Äô it means yur tunnelling ... I understand 1 ds but all 4 means it‚Äôs probably your fault
---
Wtf are you talking about stfu if you hve no arguments, he's right if you kill everyone before the end of the game adrenaline was literally a wasted perk.
---
I would get Hag nurse and leather face to lvl 40 
---
And then my spirit to lvl 50
---
I would level up  meg dead hard guy and Laurie to lvl 40.
---
(I would lvl 50 my dweet)
---
I made a joke about never getting ruin in my bloodweb and 2 red rank survivors said it was a crutch perk and I needed to ‚Äúgit gud.‚Äù If I tried to counteract that with ‚Äúthe gen speeds this game were insane they‚Äôd say: LMAO HES ANGRY git gud. They said I was exactly the type of boosted entitled killer to bring crutches
---
Coz your playing Claudette... Deserve it
---
1. Unlock the teachables perks you want always to use. (avoid useless perks)
---
2. Choose you main (survivor/killer) and prestige it to p3.
---
3. Now you have your main on p3 with all perks you want, choose play always with it or prestige and use others survivors/killers.
---
4. If choose play with others/prestige --&gt; choose if want to learn useless teachables perks.

The guy with the chainsaw and the apron. The meme is referencing how many people who play him use insidious and just sit in the basement camping
---
I don‚Äôt think the problem you ran into will be fixed with dedicated servers though. Sounds like game bug, not a connection issue.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Cool facts, all teammates working on different gens will get 4 done faster than if they did 4 together.
---
This community is honestly pretty garbage because literally everyone just bitches about the devs all the time. Tru3 is a whiney, toxic bitch, so I'm not very bothered by him getting stream sniped ü§∑ others deal with it so why can't he?? Oh is it because he can't camp his hooks?
---
I just get annoyed with perks I‚Äôm not over here making up rules for it it just annoys me and I think feeing annoyed at something is different from making a rule about something but I just get pissed because it‚Äôs all I see in the chat after I get like a 2k
---
When is the game not broken?
---
1v1 against a nurse I think (clickbait title as well lol)
---
Wasn‚Äôt really shittalking but he was answerring someone and said something along these lines: ‚Äúnext time you‚Äôll say monto is a god‚Äù

I was hoping that Vanilla meant that we'd also play on the original, darker, maps. That doesn't seem to be the case, unfortunately.
---
I wonder how hard it is to program stuff like this because for honor has the same problem where the executions just go everywhere. You kill someone on the stairs and and raider is back breaking someone behind him.
---
I screamed.
---
I think so, since it's now a survivor perk, now we just have to find it
---
They like to make their rules so they can feel justified why they lost. It‚Äôs annoying but it‚Äôs just people being toxic like every other game

## Pros &amp; Cons

## Notes
---
Play how you want, nobody can force you to follow their imaginary rules.
---
These are fake right?
---
Because that would mean Feral Frenzy should also apply it. A power that gives you increased speed. Same goes with dashing. You move at a much higher movement speed giving you an advantage that is not fair to survivors. You do realize you shouldn't be spoonfed kills just because you are a killer and deserve it, right? If as a survivor I have no chance of fighting back why play at all. It's all about game design and how to make it fun and being downed instantly because the opposition had an advantage in speed is not fun.
---
I don‚Äôt usually it‚Äôs just annoying rules like that are getting complained about more than like hackers or people who cheat in the game
---
Used to be literally impossible on console, then they upped the framerate. Now, super doable. But im also good at the hurricane/WoF arcade game so maybe it's just me.
---
Survivors be like

‚ÄúCome ooooon. Just let me escape!!‚Äù

They nerfed her again yesterday unless I can‚Äôt read. Said crouch speed increased in the patch notes.
---

# JoJo INTENSIFIES
---
I know just annoying when people wanna vent about it instead of talking about what changes they would want in the game
---
As a killer main i get pissed that other killers usually use moris and insta Down addons, like.. do you REALLY need that? Im doing fine without Them, and i tend to have more fun when its a Challenge for me. Dont other killer mains Think the same or is it just me?
---
How do you feel about Devour?
---
Just the funnest individual....
---
I‚Äôll go check it out.

But anywho he seriously takes this game too seriously. This game is not supposed to be this competitive e-sport he treats it like. Sad.

That‚Äôs like, your opinion man.

Give jim a portable locker
---
Yup I just have a problem because I could probably find a essay worth of rules there at Emmanuel toxic games like cod but in that game if you like camp it‚Äôs a legit strat and people bitch on you about it but it‚Äôs a legit strat a lot of people do same with killers but people wanna manipulate it to seem like it‚Äôs a unforgiving act and you should be executed for it
---
No, I don't see how it would mean that Feral Frenzy should apply it. Are there really only two options out there:
---
\- not applying Exposed to any of the non-basic attacks?
---
\- applying Exposed to every of the non-basic attacks?
---
with no middle-ground? If so, then why Legion can search lockers in Frenzy but Nurse can't after the blink?
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
Oh yeah it's big brain time
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 survivor main chief. I don‚Äôt play that much killer
---
That's why the devs need to make dc'ing a perma bannable offense. Also if they didnt want to roll the dice and get the game they should've brought a map offering.
---
Yup
---
Considering how easy it is to counter NOED, I fail to see the reason behind this.
---
Stop being a dingus, you still understood what he said.
---
That's exactly what this is. There's so many levels of sad here. 
---
1 You camp which is a boring braindead way to play the game. 
---
2 You don't feel bad about camping and don't understand how survivors could possibly have a problem with it, so you have 0 empathy and probably NEVER played a survivor game in your life.
---
3 You actually think anyone should care about your gay little feelings after the camped survivors rightfully shittalked you for your braindead empathyless playstyle, so much so that you make a redditpost about it.
---
Honestly I dont think Suzie was even that edgy. She just wanted to be liked and fell in with the wrong crowd. Frank even had to physically take her hand and make her stab the dude when Joey and Julie did it of their own free will.
---
I actually think this is cool but this is coming from a killer main
---
Probably the same survivors who are running through windows to look for them telling the killer where they are.
---
Oh dear God
---
Probably wouldn't work if you use the same concept for other girls but well played.
---
Why is that shameless? I feel strongly about that comment, so I want to talk to people who have that mindset. Isn't that why anyone comments about anything? I bet you've talked to more than one person about a single subject in your life. Heck, people gloating are the worst, they tell everyone they meet the same exact story.
---
1. I camp because 3 other survivors  are ganging up on me 
---
2. no I don‚Äôt because they shouldn‚Äôt be ganging up on the hook for a rush 
---
3. Probably the stupidest thing I‚Äôve heard from this sub

---
If by camping you mean facecamping one person when the exit isn‚Äôt open I could see why they‚Äôre annoyed. If you‚Äôre just looking around the area near the hook because you know they‚Äôre there, that‚Äôs fine. There‚Äôs loads of strats in this game but there‚Äôs some which slow down the game way too much or just makes the game boring, which I would justify why they‚Äôre annoyed. Most times though people are just salty, lol
---
I agree with most.
---
Good luck regretting that when you‚Äôre old
---
Laughs in five blink nurse
---
You can sympathize with someone and still not excuse their actions.
---
This is interesting to say the least. It doesn't sound OP or weak just meh which I like because it's balanced although kinda a niche thing it would do.
---
killer doesnt lose when gens are powered, they lise when eveyone has left thro the gates, there are alot of builds based around endgame for that reason
---
No everyone has access to every map
---
It's mostly just huntress/nurse that get much more value from a mouse though. I don't see why a PC trapper would rank higher than a console trapper. For high ranks on all the platforms spirit is popular and controller or m/kb doesn't really change how she is played.  There are skilled players everywhere.  Maybe a larger percentage of the playerbase on PC tends to get to red ranks since they have had access to the game longer, especially considering a lot of the console playerbase got the game for free maybe a year ago or whenever that was.  That's just conjecture though, so its hard to know.  
---
Most of the skill in this game is based on knowledge and experience, and that's something every player can have.  The mechanical skill part of the game is pretty minor, with the largest exception being nurse but regardless the skill of the nurse player it doesn't make the survivor side any more or less mechanically difficult. 
---
Mixing the playerbases together could result in players being at different ranks though, maybe some players would find it easier and others would find it more difficult to rank up but I wouldn't expect that to too major.  That may even be a good thing, if more players were in each rank then more players whose skill is around their rank would be there and you would have proportionally less rank 15s that play like rank 1s and less rank 1s that play like rank 15s.
---
I can‚Äôt even count that high holy crap
---
You will now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white
---
Don't forget the guy who got pushed out of a top story window in his apartment building, just to came back a year later with his pet bird to take revenge on his fiance's killers
---
Im actually so sad as me and my friend were so hyped for the shrine and then it gives us this
---
It wasn't by hand
---
Yup, survivors shouldnt have anything remotely useful or powerful in their bloddwebs.
---
Yes I guess
---
That's contradictory.
---
Yes there is. 
---
A Gen on average provides 8 skillchecks with ruin 3 that equals to 40% loss of progression. 80x0.4 is 32 seconds so a gen takes on average 112 seconds. With gentapping it takes 122 seconds
---
Depending on survivors I‚Äôd say if it‚Äôs swf then they might try to rush the crap outta you but if it‚Äôs random then yeah I‚Äôd say they go for wins instead of gens I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for saying this like the rest of my comments but that‚Äôs the sub Reddit I‚Äôm on
---
Dude has fucking laser cannons and shit it‚Äôs kinda dumb xeno would probably be a better choice
---
I‚Äôm kinda low key confused why you got downvoted also
---
Can i get this template with the keyboard üëÄ
---
i like it, also allows to farm a bit of hits/ healing/ chase time. it‚Äôs also a ggwp when they‚Äôre teabagging
---
Maybe in a different game where you could actually fight back, but running a Predator around loops would feel stupid, because their agility and advanced technology would be downplayed too hard in order for them to work for this game. This could literally be its own game, similar to Evolve or Friday the 13th, and work really well.
---
I mean, I play this game in a competitive way a mot of the time, but it‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt have fun and it‚Äôs quite sad. He has this massive ego and can‚Äôt admit his mistakes. He always blames the game (killers need buffs) or the players (even still when they have DS)
---
The idea is cool but there would be alot of enjoying shits bodyblocking and clicking with their flashlight
---
This achievement was obtainable by getting a 4k before they made pipping up harder. I agree that the achievment should have also been made a little easier to obtain after they did that.

I almost forgot to mention that this account from above is not the first account which was offered as legit account. He already sold an account with steam level 514.

Mikasa published some information about the account. Lets sum the most important ones up and proof if there is only one single steam account in the world which fulfills those infos to varify  its this account which is going to be sold.  
---
\- steam level: 514  
---
\- steam games: 500+  
---
\- Codes, skins, cosmetics: Red Ace Hat, Street Meg + Science Fair Claudette, Dweard etc.
---
This account has steam level 514 --&gt; [https://steamladder.com/profile/76561198106883456/](https://steamladder.com/profile/76561198106883456/)  
---
Moreover, it is one of two steam accounts in Asia with this level. --&gt; [https://steamladder.com/ladder/xp/asia/](https://steamladder.com/ladder/xp/asia/)   
---
The other one does not own the game Dead by Daylight, not the exclusives above.
---
I checked all the other regions and there is no other account which has  steam level 514 with Dead by Daylight and those exclusive skins.
---
Does the account have more than 500 games as stated in the account list by Mikasa? Here is the proof: [https://imgur.com/a/zasSs5a](https://imgur.com/a/zasSs5a)  
---
 \--&gt; So yes, this is also correct.
---
Now we have to look if the account owns the exclusive skins from above? Here is a link  to his inventory: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhatXHell/inventory/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhatXHell/inventory/)  
---
 \- The account owns Red Ace hat   
---
\- The account owns Street Meg (= Meg Comiccon)   
---
\- The account owns S.F. Claudette (= Claudette Comiccon)   
---
\- The account owns Dweard 
---
Furthermore, Mikasa published the account's achievements for  the game Dead by Daylight with the intention to show that the "Legacy" is legit and not hacked, this can be seen in the  prestige achievements of Dead by Daylight. The achievements are no indicator if the Legacy is legit. The devs can easily check if a Legacy skin is hacked and in this case the skins were not legit.  
---
 \--&gt; Here is a link to the images Mikasa Code seller published in the  account list (including the Dead by Daylight achievements): [https://imgur.com/a/mUjeNlb](https://imgur.com/a/mUjeNlb)
---
When you compare the achievements shown in the images with the achievements of the profile, you will see that every  single achievement date fits the dates from the images and there is a 0%  chance to have the same dates on all achievements (date, hour, minutes,  seconds) on round about 100 achievements.  
---
 \--&gt; Here is a link to the users achievements: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhatXHell/stats/381210/?tab=achievements](https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhatXHell/stats/381210/?tab=achievements)
---
I could continue showing off proofs. But I think it is enough to show you the accounts he offers are not as legit as presented. 
---
Be very careful guys and dont support illegal actions like this. Have a nice day and stick with your own accounts instead of risking to spend a lot of money for an illegal account.
---
No problem. If you know anyone who's P3 survivor and bored out of their mind, send em my way
---
The way they win is to get gens. The only other way is the hatch, which only works if there‚Äôs one guy left or if someone has a key with enough gens completed. The most they can do is bait you long enough for their teammates to get gens completed
---
NyAhHA
---
But just for Deathgarden. They would have to get separate rights for DBD
---
yeah, i believe the game i played was fair and i deserved an achievement you know. I hate playing nurse thats why i hate trying to do this achievement, cause im  b a d
---
Like i Said, every situation is different, and also depend on the killer you are playing.
---
I hope Pixar doesn‚Äôt file a copyright infringement on the clown. But it will be funny AF to be running away from my boy Bing Bong
---
Ironically, he banned me because he thinks I made this topic Lol.
---
instadowns&gt; running and getting a stroke after running
---
I just don't see it being consistent from a standpoint of playing both sides. A killer will often give you a protection hit if you get in the way or bodyblock, and unhooks are largely in your control.
---
However it's very unlikely a killer gives up a chase to just chase someone else without reason. If anything it would only be consistent against killers who tunnel because they give up on Captain "I want to loop you, look at me look at me look at me" to go after easy prey.
---
That's the thing though. Looping still requires skill. Especially at certain jungle gyms. Camping + tunneling requires zero skill. 
---
When I play killer and a survivor loops me really well, it's super annoying, but I can respect it since it takes skill. When I play survivor and a killer camps or patrols, to then ignore everything but me, is something that I definetely can not respect
---
"Played the right way"
---
There is no "right way" there's just made up rules when players are mediocre so they have something to bitch about.
---
Tunneling on a Tbagger? That's exactly what they want so the others can rush gens. Don't fall for it and cut your losses. 
---
Getting face camped? The other 3 can finish most, if not all, of the gens and the killer will de-pip.
---
Yeah but not everyone wants to go for win right away sometimes they save their friends for more bp or just to outplay like a bad killer and while gens is the main focus sometimes doing objectives is better for more bp than taking the win
---
Don't forger the fact that survivors are also not allowed to do gens
---
And yet here we both are explaining sarcasm.
---
It is, but by the time you get 4 hooks you'll only have double bloodpoints for part of a match.
---
It should be the last one
---
I was playing against a Michael and experienced this for the first time. It scared and confused the shit out of me, because that effect was reserved for just Ghostface as far as I knew.
---
1/6th of his original height. Too expensive for those measures though
---
I once got yelled at for totem rushing lol
---
Every online gaming community in a nutshell.
---
Camping won‚Äôt make them budge though, they‚Äôll wait for a bit then go for generators since they know you won‚Äôt move
---
When are these going to be released?
---
That's what I said I think?
---
Yeah but yet again if you when that killer chase you down your friends can do gens looping takes skill but yet again also knowing how to play a tunneling killer does too and if you can‚Äôt respect that‚Äôs fine there‚Äôs a lot of things I don‚Äôt respect on both sides such as face camping before exit gate or t bagging when you jump a pallet it just depends on how you handle it if the killer does what he thinks he needs to to win it shouldn‚Äôt be a rule to not do that thing
---
Best way to get adepts is by deranking a bit to yellow ranks. The game makes you gain pips faster in lower ranks.
---
Depending on killer you can also camp and murder people who try to rush or sit there a good nurse camping out a hook rush could probably wreck the hole team
---
That's a pretty bad system for adept. You need emblem points and the best method is just down someone and hook them as it doesn't reset one emblem through heals. You also need 9 hooks and a 4k to max devout, and chaser and malicious are also balanced around roughly 3 hooking most if not all survivors.
---
Slugging and killing most survivors in 2 hooks or less is a really low scoring emblem game.
---
Agreed expect Ghostface is my boy :( his power clicks with me a lot more than myers.
---
Who‚Äôs gonna rush though? Even if they unhook the survivor, you‚Äôre gonna hit them again and make it worse for that survivor anyways
---
P3 50 or p3 cause I have p3 ace
---
Don‚Äôt forget the fact killers can‚Äôt kill someone who‚Äôs low on health after they got on a hook or camp a hook when the rest of the team is rushing it
---
I p3 him because of his power, and now I have to deal with this...
---
That‚Äôs when I Downloaded it because my friends wanted me to try it and also get a 4th man for there SWF group and told me this and that and also to download the huntress for free and that PC didn‚Äôt have this or that. Ty for reminding me of this! 
---
So people I‚Äôm going off of what they told me when I downloaded the game a year ago, but people are so quick to cast you into hell on this subreddit.

I hate Texas now

DS is a free escape for sucking with no counter once the gates are open.

I wouldn't say toxic. It's more like delusional. Just play how you want. You played for the game. You will make people mad no matter what you do. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

thats rough
---
True but it's still sad cause, ya know, Rousseau was right. So it's really sad
---
You could say she got hit by an ambulance.
---
Lmfao people on this sub can make literally ANYTHING a killer vs survivor autism fight.
---
Considering that Nea's true identity is the entity, this makes sense
---
Mobile DBD only lets you level a character by actively playing them? That sounds questionable.
---
this bug has been here since hag was introduced iirc
---
What I mean by perkless is that perks have separate rules for spawning that override normal item/offering rules. 
---
Best example is that there are *always* six green nodes and three purple nodes. If you have a perk, it will take one of those spots (assuming it is green or purple). So that affects item spawn, as now we only have five green/two purple spawns to work with.
---
So whether you bought all the perks already *or* simply don't have the teachables unlocked, it doesn't matter. Just can't have any perks on the web.
---
My PS4 displays in 1080 so I think it'd be OK. I have a maxed Feng I could do this with.

Prestige him and you get it

[Hugh Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Glass) was his name.
---
Who is Nick Crompton?
---
Something I've always liked about Spirit's lore is that we dont know if the Entity has or ever will give Rin (?) the promised revenge. Did the Entity let her kill dad right away, or is it constantly dangling the prospect of revenge like a carrot on a stick to continue twisting this innocent girl into a ruthless monster?
---
**Hugh Glass**
---
Hugh Glass (c. 1783 ‚Äì 1833) was an American frontiersman, fur trapper, trader, hunter, and explorer. He is best known for his story of survival and retribution after being left for dead by companions when he was mauled by a grizzly bear.
---
Born in Pennsylvania to Scots-Irish parents, Glass became an explorer of the watershed of the Upper Missouri River, in present-day Montana, the Dakotas, and the Platte River area of Nebraska.

Happy cake day
---
Perfect. Is she p0 or p3?
---
What‚Äôs max level?
---
Ask their mom to bring them more tendies and Mountain Dew
---
She's P3 50 with all of the perks
---
probably cause I didnt tell you to jump off a Cliff for Camping or tunneling lol.
---
50.
---
Chance for an escape cake spawn is roughly 1/3 bloodwebs :)
---
50 but you can continue past that if you don‚Äôt care about prestige.
---
Yes, the entity gave her the "spirit powers" and let her take revenge
---
I remember the one where a guys father and mother were brutally murdered by a corrupt small towns police chief, who later dies of a heart attack, denying the guy his chance for justice. The guy is still hungry for revenge though so he kills the chief's son, and chases the chief's wife and other son half-way across the world to Massachusetts where in a freak twist of fate the wife and son blow him up in a lake with explosives. 
---
To think, none of this might have happened if Hooper and Quint had just listened to Chief Brody when he suggested they needed a bigger boat.
---
Not really in the horror genre tho, more action instead. Now ripley and alien would be sick
---
Dang, I wish I get these kinds of people, and I do sometimes... But more often it's survivors telling me I tunnel or that I need to give my mom's credit card back for buying the pay-to-win ghostface dlc... Ik "five dollars" is insane but let's be real here, those survivors honestly weren't even trying to break my stalk XD. Salt can be annoying, often childish, but it really does add some flavor to the game when you see people go beserk in the endgame chat. I find those moments some of the most funny.
---
What is the killer add on/ perk called that reveals survivors auras that are crouching within a certain range?
---
Oh that's exactly what we're looking for. If you want to burn BP on her, get screenshots of the bloodweb screen just like [this](https://imgur.com/vj1RmoT). Don't have to zoom in or anything. The program just takes the full screenshot and finds items. 
---
Make sure you don't buy anything in the bloodweb. Leave them untouched.
---
your comment just stinks of salt......calm down before you try to take Part in a discusion
---
Those guys probably never played killer in their lives or never hit red ranks as killer or even purple ranks. People who don't play the other half of the game tend to be uninformed idiots
---
^
---
So, spawn a new web and take a screenshot. Then, spawn a new web and take another screenshot. Is that correct?
---
lol
---
I like your reference in the title üòè
---
i would love to see a fav. system for killers, so you cab rank from best to worst the killers you enjoy playing against. legion and ghostyboi would be at the bottom... nurse, mikey and vommymommy would be the most fun killes to vs for me... but who am i kidding the mm has enough problens as it is. i just know if i play vs legion or ghostyboi its going to be a short unfun game
---
Don‚Äôt forget the purple and red insta heals
---
If Ghostface bothers you that much just run spine chill. If Legion bothers you that much... why? Legion isn't great
---
right, and hooligans are far from scary..
---
NOED punishes survivors for doing their objective rather than rewarding the killer for doing well. Adrenaline rewards survivors for doing their objective, rather than punishing the killer for doing well.
---
Knew it was something like that but couldn't remember it
---
I thought you meant so you could tune in to random games. Which would also be good
---
Something so brave
---
I played against a pink nea one time and this is how it went.
---
I found her pretty early she ran away from me but not to a pallet then she backed off into me then tried to 360.
---
It was an easy hit for me but then instead of running she ran circles around me then pretended to run away only to try to 360 again while I just literly stood still and hit her again.
---
She immediately disconnected.
---
after the game I had a good laugh with the other survivors who asked why she dced.
---
He just bans people over thinks they say if it‚Äôs something he disagrees with. He‚Äôs no fun
---
Oh yeeaahh, the one time use exhaustion perks in a chase, oh also did I mention killer exhaustion addons?
---
So insta heals are broken but not a 1 shot add ons with an ebony more? So what that like 8 hits to win a game because you'll mori off hook?
---
They mean any Blink that results in a hit - be that a 1 Blink hit or a 5 Blink hit.
---
They should add a replay mode so you can view the game you played, have evidence when someone cheats, and you dont have to record all the time just to have something on tape if something happens
---
I think that James has no place outside his own universe. Silent Hill is about the mystery.
---
Eh? Every other thread you have people saying fuck noed.
---
Of course people can use their profiles as long as the accounts are not sold. That is indeed not his problem. 
---
But Mikasa has to check the accounts before he offers them and if the account contains hacked stuff such as the Legacy skins from account no.114, he should not offer them as legit account. Someone who describes himself as trustworthy should be able to check the achievements, especially when they are public on steam. This takes less than 2 minutes. I wonder why he did upload a screenshot of the achievements on account no.114 and still offered the account as legit Legacy account.
---
Please feel free to tell me a single line from my message which is comparable with "attacking". Thank you for your input.

Thats what it is... Thankyou !!!!
---
I think that's fair.
---
However, I do view a catch-me-if-you-can Perk that nets bonus BP as less percarious (and sandbag-y) than WGLF as it exists now. Getting paid for being altruistic in a *strategic* way is missing for me.
---
Maybe this idea is not the best implementation.

True lol most upvoted comment on this thread is one that doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with post lol

yep, thats how dbd reddit works

People are assholes

She is blending into to his robes
---
I don't see how that's an issue. A survivor giving you a free hit is never a bad thing.
---
That‚Äôs why I usually don‚Äôt make posts like this because I‚Äôll usually get garbage instead of decent answers
---
I'm not trying to judge or anything, but I get far more hatemail from people with anime profile pictures than any other type. I'm assuming the audience skews a bit younger on average but it's just a weird pattern.

Oh really? Playing on ps4 and I‚Äôve never come across that

But blendettes.

Shes not an original character but I always found Amanda a pretty tragic character. Drug addicted, manipulated into killing a stranger to save herself, then manipulated into working for a serial killer who she sees as a father. She's physically tortured a bunch more (in movies and games) and then she's blackmailed into killing an innocent woman and dies because of it. Now, she's also a murderer who designed rigged games, but that was in part due to the fact that Jigsaw was a shitty mentor who failed to teach *any* of his disciples. 
---
Amanda's probably one of the killers that had no problem going to work for the entity. At the end of her lore it's even implied that she thinks Jigsaw is behind this or that she's given the Entity a father/mentor-like status.
---
You really are trying to get banned by the devs aren‚Äôt you.
---
Couple goals
---
how....tasteful
---
Devs already said Nurse is high priority for them. 
---
I don't know what do you want more for them.
---
Sure... When you have a bunch of crazed looking ones holding knives. Chasing after you in a dark alley.
---
Let's see you just run. XD
---
recomendation: when waiting for a match, see some youtube videos
---
Best advice a dbd player can give
---
Lemme guess, you want an M203 underbarrel perk.
---
Yeah it takes a bit but once you get to rank 17 you get lobbies a lot faster
---
Michael has probably never taken a shower.
---
Thanks :D
---
Because they want it easy otherwise the whole thing's unfair to them. There's those Survivors who don't seem to like the fact that they have to survive. They want the Killers to be nice. I don't have anything against Killers playing nice because I do it a lot, and I always play nice if any of us have connection issues because that genuinely isn't fair. Or I might just get in the mood to farm, or feel bad for a Survivor because someone else screwed them over. If I notice a Survivor tries to pass me on to someone else I won't allow it because I don't like it when that's been done to me. They're just personal rules I follow to be fair but game mechanics like perks are fine even if they piss you off. One of the most stupid "rules" I see made for Killers are that they're not aloud to use NOED. I use NOED to counter stuff like Adrenaline. The other day someone messaged me after a match insulting me for using Franklin's Demise. The ironic thing is that the person who was mad about it was using the most powerful flashlight available and they'd been following me around with it for most of the match, always waiting for when I'd picked a Survivor up to jump me. They didn't like that I caught on to their planning and made them drop the flashlight several times. They didn't like me knocking their flashlight, I didn't like them knocking Survivors out of my grasp. We were even and I didn't condemn them for using a powerful flashlight and following me with it irritating as it was. But no, apparently I wasn't aloud to use a perk that'd help me fight back.
---
Other stupid made up rules by Survivors are that the moment you hook someone you need to run to the very corner of the map and not look back at any point otherwise you're apparently camping. Also, if you notice scratch marks and sneaky Survivors right around where you've just hooked someone pretend you saw nothing and go sit in a corner. As if. The way I play the game is that I pay attention to my surroundings right before hooking someone as I've often seen a Claudette peeking around the corner right before hooking people. I'll often also notice fading scratch marks nearby. If this is the case I will scan the area around the hook thoroughly before leaving, and sometimes the moment I start to leave the Survivor is unhooked, I turn around, and apparently that's also camping? Alternatively after hooking someone I quickly scan the immediate area and break the gens closest to me, making my way further out. That's also camping, somehow. When I'm playing Survivor I always give it a minute or so before unhooking someone because I consider other Killers might do the same and break nearby Gens before going further out. Just as a test I have actually gone to the very opposite end of the map right after hooking people before, ignoring all signs that someone is nearby the hook, and been really nice, and I'd still get accused of camping if I'd manage to kill a single Survivor. I get accused of tunneling from time to time despite the fact that all four other players had been injured and hooked once before anyone reached their second hook stage. Or if you hook someone, they're saved, and then by chance they cross your path again and you pursue them that's also apparently tunneling...
---
Just fix her damn add ons. There's like 3 worth anything and theyre all common. Combat straps (25% faster crouch speed) and Rules Set No. 2 (Survivors dont see trap box outlines until the trap activates) should both be part of her base kit as well.
---
You don't know what you're talking about. lol  Solo queue as a survivor is extremely cancerous.  The average survivor actually DOESN'T hit red ranks because at some point their idiocy gets smashed by a decent killer.  Saying shit like this makes you look like an entitled killer who knows jack shit about being a survivor.  If hitting red was so easy then I'd never end up playing with ranks 9 - 14 so often.
---
I would rather have them do a generator
---
TBH I wish that I could play without ruin.
---
"whats up guys, scarce here"
---
Matchmaking at its finest, one of the things the ptb tried, and failed, to fix
---
Thankyou! Not understanding the total wash of hate but should of expected it from reddit/DbD community lol. It isn‚Äôt effecting me in the slightest but it‚Äôs nice to see a change of tune haha
---
Conceptually they are all just bad for the style of DbD with exception of maybe Chucky and Jason. 
---
Plus I‚Äôm sure the licensing fees are killers aren‚Äôt cheap.
---
Lmao! Did you share this on twitter and tag Monto?
---
It's what you have to do
---
I spam the power cool down when they're teabagging me at the gate for the immersion and fun.
---
It‚Äôs a good idea
---
Why does it even look like that?
---
Ps4 pro screenshot. I adjusted my brightness after that match lmao
---
I'm not saying that she has been nerfed to the ground, but still I think the nerf was completely unnecessary.
---
&gt;If they make a perk that says "this activates on basic attack" and with every new perk they have to argue "is this a basic attack or not", then that's an issue.
---
Yet they don't say it. They say that those perks activate Exposed effect, and it isn't clearly stated in the perks descriptions whether Exposed should be applied to any of the non-basic attacks or not.
---
&gt;As for why can't there be a middle ground, is because you need to have a standard.
---
&gt;As for why Nurse can't search lockers after, well that is reserved for certain killers, it's a design choice.
---
So, do they really have to make all standardized, or there is a place for design choices?
---
If you have everyone on death hook status NoED certainly does reward a gen pressure, no hook camping play style, and that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand out of the argument against it. It‚Äôs like that point isn‚Äôt valid??
---
im basing it of my experience since i play survivor solo and hit rank1 every month with ease, and i would not consider myself even close to decent.
---
his, I just know who she is. the movie was not good anyway.
---
Corrupt Intervention is actually not a bad replacement. I use it on Pig instead of Ruin.
---
If God exists I pray he saves us from you thirsty freaks
---
ikr
---
Choice or something extra gay like that
---
He died for our sins
---
It was not worth it.
---
Balanced, because it also works when you are exhausted, doesn't give you a drop stagger, also some maps have nasty loops if you have balance landing. Smarter killers will just leave you alone. 
---
Dead heart can be life saver too, but you usually can only use it once, twice if you lucky in a match, killer will bait it out when he knows you have dead heart.
---
Lithe is powerful, but to get full potential you need to pair it with other perks, which is not optimal.
---
Sprint burst is garbage for me. It slows you down too much and kills more people than it saves. Died many times because people where saving their sprint bursts. If it was manually activated it like dead heart it would be god tier, now it's garbage.
---
In spanish diversi√≥n means fun. Both apply here.
---
dcing against doctor in 2019 lmfao
---
They said they were actually trying really hard to get Jason in a live stream and it‚Äôs a possibility the lawsuit could be over in the next 2 months because Tim is writing a appeal or something not good with law in 90 days
---
I remember seeing a post in dbd forums that said that nurse was torture with the bag she has in her head and doctor too with those things in his head.
---
Yup, what Imp_foot said it is to avoid offending people, dead religions, like let's said ancient babylonian, zeus, Anpu, Thor and such don't count because people don't follow them anymore.
---
SO in short, it's not about religion, is about offending it's followers.
---
I WANT ALL SURV/KILLERS SO I CAN REPLACE THEM ON GAMES ICON PORTRAITS PLZZZZ
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what game you play. IDC if it‚Äôs a board game like Monopoly. People will always whine that you are playing a certain way. It‚Äôs no different in DBD except it‚Äôs 4v1 so there‚Äôs a majority whining against you.
---
I guess it's about playstyle. I tend to trap all around the totem and possible escape routes. So he's not so good at defending totems like hag, eh?
---
r/atbge
---
I'm proud to be a fully non-toxic super saiyan lesbian neon nea.  No flashlights, no tbagging killers, no dumbass 360s to "style" on the killer, and no stupidly aggressive saves.  Just decent looping, We'll Make It, the occasional bodyblock and some surprisingly effective stealth given the neon.
---
My second choice is Jeff, because I hate having a chance at winning.
---
Yeah, that's a valid reason. But I still think there should be a different design decision regaring Pig's lunge because of the specifics of how it works compared to abilities of other killers and because of how it works with her kit.
---
Also for the record ive put more time into survivor than killer
---
As long as it's not a hex.
---
TBF, working on separate gens with ruin is the best you can do because any missed ruin skillcheck will also stop the progress from your teammates.
---
Because ruin not only regresses the gen, it also prevents further repair for 2 seconds.
---
U have til the 2nd...games r usually instant.
---
 "With swf, the right map and enough rng, a match can actually be impossible to win as any other Killer than Nurse"
---
This is the only thing I don't agree with. With enough RNG any tier killer can win against any level of survivors, makes your argument hard to agree with. Great post nonetheless.
---
As much as I'd like to see Pennywise in the game, that description makes sense as to why they wouldn't add him. But I sure would love to see Hell-Razor in the game and or a werewolf character.
---
Oh alright i can pump point into ace then
---
I thought those were penises for a second there
---
"Press F to Pay Respect" is a meme, sometimes used sarcastically like this or as a RIP for when somebody does something dumb/dies in a game.

I send him a DM with the vid but got no response

watch someone like tru3ta1ent play and watch how he plays, I learned from watching others. playin killer can help 2 if you dont already

I‚Äôm a killer main actually. I‚Äôm just getting frustrated with survivor
---
1 works just fine. It happened to me on lerys map several months ago after I did a totem. I was like lol fuck that trap, it was only 1, and ran right over it. It launched me so far out of the map I didn't think I was ever going to land back into it.
---
I think the lores are so intresting, I really can't wait until the archives are in game
---
I was speaking from a Killer point of view.
---
We don't like your type 'round these parts, using logic and all of that.
---
as i keep climbing ranks as a killer, (14/15 now, not even anything good) i run into teams taht either a.  destroy my ruin within mins or  b. just hit skillchecks like its nothing.   so when its 4 mins into the game, and 3 gens are done and i have hit 1 person so far, i feel a little useless.   at least with noed i have a chance to do something.  granted, i pretty much never use it cause i want a different perk to use.
---
ive been enjoying the hell out of blood warden.  ive had it happen in about 3/5 games i play where i'm able to get that late hook  and stop the survivors at the gates, which will lead to another hook or 2.  i had a game last night where i sacrificed the first person when the gates popped.  i was able to hook 2 more after that.  all in all ended with 3 kills.
---
That's one brave tattoo to wear lmao!
---
Those are made well, I won't do these on my skin but tattoos are personal and if you enjoy those good for you!
---
Oh I remember that one. It just didn‚Äôt correlate for me. Thanks
---
They would never give the licensing for that. DBD is a direct c ol competitor, and the main thing that would make their franchise unique (The Predator in all his bad assery) would need to stay with them in order for it to be successful
---
Jesus Christ imagine getting this triggered over a meme lmao
---
I knew that much, but what icon pack is that?
---
Don‚Äôt be rude to Quentin you goober
---
I haven't played in a long time but I remember it being the community being toxic af on Xbox when I played there for the first year the game was out.
---
Pretty sweet, my guy.
---
I used to be killer main as was shit at survivor so just spent a lot of time watching others. I'm still not that great but a lot better, I gave up on trying 360's and just focused on looping etc and that helped.
---
They didn't want RBTs to be death machines in the endgame. People say "ugh, just extend the timer", but you have to understand they most likely already tried that and a million other things as well and this solution felt the best. Her traps are not supposed to be insta-deaths. Just use them during the game, not at the end. That change shouldn't affect you at all.
---
As for dash being different design-wise, then you start encountering a problem and start asking, but why isn't it an ability when it clearly is? Why does it function as a basic attack when it's clearly not? Like, these are serious questions that most of us probably don't even consider.
---
IDIOTS! you forgot left behind, and botany knowledge
---
Deaf people friendly survivor, that would not be bad at all!
---
It is easy, IF you have time.
---
First off it doubles your bloodpoints every game (assuming you hook a 4 survivors you get 25% per unique hooked survivor) . That alone makes it worth it but it has one of the most powerful effects too. When you hook a survivor every survivor standing farther ways aura is revealed for a few seconds. Unless they‚Äôre in a locker. Best perk for finding people in the game.
---
This is perfect
---
&gt;Having Jason in the game or not is in no way linked to his presence in other products.
---
We are always on the lookout for iconic characters that would fit well in the fog!
---
Obviously, Jason has a standing invitation.

---
This is a reply from not_queen on June 18th **2018**. Very old one so it could be a different scenario regarding Jason nowadays.
---
Watch videos/streams to get an idea of what to do, and then PRACTICE it. and to practice it, don't hide in a locker. Use OoO and get in the killer's face and practice looping him or jungle gymming him. Maybe you will get killed first for a few games but you will learn more than by being an immersed claudette
---
Use spine chill to tell when killer is looking at you. If it stays lit up, they are looking at you the whole time and are probably getting closer. Helps while doing gens. And have the combo is dark sense to see the killers location after you complete a gen
---
Xeno would feel so stupid in the slasher setting though.
---
They can tear open steel bulkhead doors and climb upside down; pallet stun, flashlight blind?
---
Thank you, I try to do that but just end up dying.
---
Jason has his own very similar game So i say it's a no.
---
The creeper you said it, they don't want association with that guy.
---
Slenderman is possible, he even has a movie.
---
Jack the ripper, well, he could enter in the "we don't want real killers in the game" but being so old, he might be an exception.
---
Norman: well, his mother outfit is kinda scary, but yes, he has no power except stalk and we got already two with that.
---
Dracula/Vampire: Vampires have a shitton of powers, so not flying is not a problem here.
---
Grim Reaper: Well, it can be someguy called the grim reapper. so I would not discard it completely.
---
Ellen Ripley/Alien: Well, it is true, the Xenomorphs just do what their instinc tells them, so they don't really fit the lore. But, the entity got a horse, who knows.
---
Chucky: it would be harder than just adding a normal size killer, i has to deal with some problems, mainly killer being able to find survivors being so small.
---
Pennywise: Someone actualy wrote a very good story for this: after getting it's ass kicked, Pennywise gets overpowered by the entity who takes it into it's realm as it's new killer. so something like that can work. His power can be fear based, not just transformations.
---
The exorcist/Nun: Well, demons are not exactly what you would call religious, but the nun outfit would be problematic at first sight, but a story of the demon taking a nun's form might explain it.
---
Carrie: Nah, the Freddy is almost omnipotent on his realm, and they added him,. a few Tk and fire won't be really a problem.
---
Or a gay man, lmao that made me grin
---
I'm a simple woman. I see Helen, I upvote.
---
I wanna see what wraith looked like!
---
Me too!
---
Except for Dying Light
---
I must admit I've been guilty of this quite a few times.
---
Imo fungoose is the most informative survivor streamer.  He‚Äôs always talking through his plays and a great looper as well.
---
Sometimes you can have more fun with that, compared to a 5 blink nurse and anal bead spirit grabbing you off gens, bringing in moris, insta downs, like to be honest I don't think rank 15-20 killers are all that good but that means you can actually fuck around and enjoy the game before you get face camped lol.
---
I used Paint Tool SAI üëå
---
Ok I'll admit I am not the best at survivor either but here is my advice that has helped me. First if you have trouble with chases look into perks that help you avoid them. Alert is a great perk for tracking the killer and finding out who it is early in the game. Bond is also good for tracking if another survivor is in a chase and also helping you know if they are burning through pallets and making areas unsafe. 
---
When you first load in take some time to learn the area you are in before you start on a gen. This will help you escape easier if you do get into a chase because you will know what you are running into. If you are in a chase make sure you try and take the short end of loops. If you take the short end it is more likely you will break the chase and restart the bloodlust timer.  Also remember stay calm when you hear the heartbeat of a killer. Unless its Hillybilly or Nurse a heart beat doesn't mean they will be there in a second or two. Sometimes it is better to walk to a hiding place instead of running away to another area even if the killer is close. Remember running shows scratch marks and most killers will aggressively follow them in early to mid game.
---
Hexes are just inherently flawed. Any perk that can be completely removed from play is not work the perk slot, IMO.
---
That's still four strong perks activating against one very strong perk activating which can be disabled entirely even before it's used. And you can't say killer is powerful enough when the entire role has a complete different strength depending on which killer you play. Yes top tier killers are powerful enough, lower tier killers are far from being powerful. The perk is fine as it is, specially after that last small nerf which gives more BP and emblems to the survivors doing bones.
---
And that's not even the point, we are talking about a perk, you're just stretching to demean what am I saying as if I stated that survivors should start on a hook.
---
I love ghostface
---
Jigsaws entire philosophy is shit anyways and Amanda made ALL of her traps impossible to escape on purpose. No way in fuck angel lady was getting surgically inserted iron bars under her ribs with just a key to unlock the harness if it still worked after sitting in acid for supposedly hours. 
---
She stops being tragic pretty quick though as she was not really manipulated at any point after that first kill, she just really liked what she did. Of course Jiggy is a fucking moron and never had a "Good" plan the entire time anyways so it's not really hard to figure out that all of his disciples, the 4 or 5 there are didn't "Get" his philosophy at all as it isn't even consistent in him.
---
I would still love pennywise being in the game but it makes sense why they wouldn‚Äôt/ couldn‚Äôt do it
---
Thanks! üíï
---
S'mores anyone?
---
Jack would have the best mori tho, slashing the survivor‚Äôs throat and then ripping into their stomach and taking out intestines
---
Salty
---
Yeah that or noed. Both incredibly frustrating perks
---
Sorry was trying to type while walking dog. The achievement counts each hit that occurs after a blink. It doesn't matter the number of blinks it takes to get the hit. So a 2 blink that results in and hit and 5 blink the result in a hit will each count as 1 towards the achievement
---
AHHHHHHHAAWWWW
---
You have people on this thread calling it a crutch and asking for a nerf.
---
Ya but I'm lazy. So without ruin I just don't care.
---
I usually don‚Äôt but I just got two kills and had another hooked and was checking a generator and saw they got rescued and was starting to stalk them when they opened the hatch and jumped so I was impressed and wanted to let them know. Apparently I should avoid that now.
---
I know how the ranks work, I just dont care. I need those BP to grind more perks on my favorite characters lol
---
Jason is Lilley once the law suit ends.
---
We have plague so maybe nun, and it doesn't matter about jeepers.
---
Survivors are squeaky toys. Learn your place.
---
If i practice a bit maybe balanced landing could be really good. Been starting to try other things out other than SB since i dont like walking everywhere
---
U r right...i misread the email instead of 2am as 2nd pff...gl
---
Makes me wonder if he'd be on his own like leatherface and ghostface, or he'd come with Tommy Jarvis or Christine Higgins for a survivor.
---
I feel like he'd either teleport for his ability or he'd use strength for breaking pallets in 1 hit.
---
They litteely said they are looking at nurse

They keep nerfing her, something tells me that one play test just hates her guts, and cries to the developers for hours on end. She one of the only killers I enjoy playing, but it's getting less and less enjoyable as the nerf her into the ground. She's already low tier, cut her some slack.
---
People who cry about NOED, but play the most annoying survivor build (adrenaline, dead hard...)
---
TentFace
---
Nice now I have all the nurse perks without having to level her up
---
The community really isn't.
---
The problem is that 1 toxic person has more impact than 50 kind ones.  A majority of people are actually nice, and helpful.  But you run into a few toxic or entitled people, and they have a much more profound impact.
---
Only trash survivors cant repair a gen with ruin
---
You mean like does it increase vault speed? If that‚Äôs what you mean, no it only affects repair, heal, sabotage speeds
---
She didn‚Äôt sacrifice anyone in her origin story tho
---
Oh shit I never realized that, I stopped playing for a while so I'm still used to it meaning how many people were sacrificed
---
Sounds like a neat idea but it‚Äôs wayy to much work üò≠
---
I just found the need to put a comment on here cus so many people are saying that I‚Äôm acting like a special snowflake or that I‚Äôm too sensitive or he‚Äôs just joking lol
---
We all escaped after that
---
Same. I think we could have seen a bit of his appearance in his concept art but they never released his, or at least I haven't seen it anywhere
---
I was playing with a group of friends against a spirit and the killer was so nice to let one of us escape, but the survivor refused to do so and, when the time expired, a divine creature was awaken: error 404.
---
Original video: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/458747785?t=04h41m33s
---
In the end the killer disconnected, it was impossible to end the game.
---
They don't have an issue with religious Killers, the Plague was/is a priestess. They might not want to offend any currently practiced religions, if that's what you meant. But that's mostly just to avoid controversial topics that might bring bad press to the game, which is understandable, I guess.

---
I can understand why they wouldn‚Äôt want to even play that game, I mean, the doctor, on the game, lol, but I always play my games through, unless the killer is being a bitch then I just let him hook me immediately and neither of us get many points.
---
I'm talking the sound of the generator itself
---
jane bends sexuality because of the orbit of her big booty
---
why do we make rules in general. the answer are the same.
---
And the Black key honestly. No clue why that's in the game. Played one where a SWF duo had a map and a key and just skulked around all match looking for the hatch once the other 2 survivors got some gens done.
---
I killed key boy and stood on the key for like 20 seconds cause map man was trying to grab it lol
---
The other 2 got away thru the gates like it's meant to be played xD
---
5 million sacrifices in 6 months, never done before
---
Which wiki are you referring to BTW?
---
the real question was if even the first blink and hit would count, its not a chain but i think it does count as i just got the trophy and do not have 100 chain blink hits, just 100 blink hits

No I‚Äôm on ps4 I‚Äôm getting into games

---
Does that happen when people play against doctor?  I probably shouldn't buy the dlc if that's common.
---
That's not what I'm saying, with context of what I quoted the OP said that with,"enough rng", an SWF lobby would be impossible to beat; any killer could win a match by that logic. By including rng in the argument it could go both ways. While not likely, with the perfect storm brought by rng the scenario could go towards whatever outcome you can come up with.
---
Legion is my second go-to after Pig. I love his AuGAHAGAhh sound.
---
I love it when people pallet blind, or tea bag/emote at pallets because it means they're wasting time instead of gaining distance by just running away. No idea why people complain so much about those things.
---
Pass all the competition man
---
Hillbilly is next
---
Too bad he‚Äôs not good in game :(
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe they deserved to win‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs so rude
---
It takes forever to get into games early in the morning.
---
I just gg and move on. 2k is a fairly balanced game and a 3k is still a win for me.
---
use windows of opportunity
---
I'd bet on the top tier SWF survivor team against a Spirit that doesn't run ruins. The billy will get humiliated. Nurse is only one that probably wins.
---
Map RNG is meaningless against good survivor teams. Gens still go at the same rate, maps all have loops that take half a gen completion to get a hit, maps don't stop insta-heals.
---
Good SWF teams are guaranteed a win if they minimize mistakes regardless of how well a killer plays, or regardless of map.
---
Nurse and spirit are the 1/8th exception to the rule
---
Ah, the survivor rulebook at it's finest
---
Both insta-meds and addons like Iri Head should be removed/reworked somehow.
---
It'll happen once they introduce the Battle Pass and god knows what other micro transactions.
---
Failing condition for survivor is them failing to escape (survive). Being hit for no reason is opposite of surviving. It was changed so your hits have survival purpose (saving live of another survivor). I think it would be more fair if survs had bonus points if they had saves on escaped ones.
---
Failing condition for killers is failing kills and sacrifices (though effort is recognized non the less). So killer didn't fail until there's no one left to kill. Freddy's perk kit is clear display of that trial isn't over until everyone have escaped.
---
Yh sometimes the cunts take it as a sign of salt or some bull but yh it's whatever.
---
If,you use ANYTHING to gain an advantage as a killer, survs will bitch tbh
---
Billy can traverse the map faster than any killer and has an instadown hit. He is arguably the strongest killer for those two reasons. Yes he can be looped but he can still mindgame most loops.
---
I don't care what you consider yourself, the norm would say you're wrong.
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I get the vibe that he‚Äôs definitely not from Compton
---
Nah, every killer needs Ruin. Not unless you get a tiny map or make absolutely amazing reads (and somehow don't get survivors all running Dead Hard which has a fat chance of happening) with Nurse you still need Ruin. 
---
Billy still gets looped and god help you if you're playing a guy who has a 360 macro and they pop up a lot at rank 5 and up. 
---
I've used Billy against The Magnificent Seven assholes and the best I could do was 2 kills with an Ebony. The use of mics, how quickly gens get done, terrible loops, and then throw on a plethora of 2nd chance/get away for free perks survivors have access to and you're skating up hill even with Billy. I used pre-nerf Legion against the same assholes with an Ebony and still the best I could do was 2 kills. The use of mics absolutely destroys any semblance of balance.
---
That was the argument made against old DS. It rewarded survivors for losing a chase. However when you bring up NOED doing the same for killers, suddenly that argument is invalid to a lot of killer mains.
---
A common misconception. Pig actually got buffed in [3.1.0](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/605150/#Comment_605150 ), check it out :)
---
Bro it was good bro plz don‚Äôt ban me
---
Billy will lose to a top tier red rank SWF team even with ruins on.
---
All they need is a strong loop and use mics to tell each other where you are and where the gens/pallets are.
---
Then she gets facecamped.
---
 The short answer is that some of these could be added but yes most of them will likely never be added. But more detailed for what I know are below 
---
* Jason Voorhees: Lawsuit is almost over last I heard but, it has been at this status before. Could be added though, he does have his own game but that game is virtually dead. 
---
* Jeepers creepers: As long as the creator is the license holder of the Creeper we won't see it in the game. 
---
* The Nun: Its not that religious killers aren't allowed, see plague, they don't want to do active religions  
---
* slenderman: Yeah BHVR probably doesn't want to open the can of worms since there is no owner of the license to the original idea and would open them selves up to lawsuits from everyone who has used the character in their project if his power was close to anything used in their projects. 
---
* Jack the ripper: BHVR has said multiple times that they will never do real life killers 
---
* Dracula/Vampire: Not the flying aspect as much as they have said they want to create their own killers or use licensed killers rather than use classic horror characters
---
* a grim reaper: See above for Dracula though a scythe wielding character would be cool maybe have a wide hit box be their power instead of having an active power. 
---
* Ellen Ripley/Alien: They said in the Plague spotlight that they wanted to show that the Entity can reach any where in any time. Also in the film series lore the xenomorphs have been on earth in the past so they would make sense in a lore sense. 
---
* Chucky: Yeah dimensions would be an issue. I was hoping with the remake and Chucky being more rouge AI than a doll with a serial killer soul would make it so he could be in the game. Like him controlling a human size robot. I had an idea the other day about a statue/golem killer that could switch between vessels on a map and use the other ones as a physical block when they were not in use. Something like that could be cool. I admit it would need some end game balance to prevent them from just camping the gens and doors  
---
* Pennywise: Just don't make his power shapeshifting or make it limited so that are stances like the doctor. Maybe have him have the ability to set a number of drains on the map that act like both traps (like trapper) and points he could teleport to. 
---
* psycho 1960: You could say that about ghostface as well before he was added. Maybe his power could be mothers whispers where when activated he gets an indication of where the closest survivor is. 
---
* the exorcist: possession like shape-shifting to survivors would be completely killed by survive with friends yeah don't think it will ever be added 
---
* Carrie: not so much implementing her power but I just don't think she really fits into the theme of the game.

I don‚Äôt have a problem with Ruin being a thing but yes, Ruin literally wins games at the low ranks (9-20). Bad survivors don‚Äôt hit greats so when they see Ruin they instantly resort to urban evading around the map to find it. This makes it a 3v1 (and even more depending on how many are looking for it) with gens which handicaps games. Even at the purple and red ranks people still do this. 
---
One thing people should know is if the killer comes where you are early game there‚Äôs a high chance it‚Äôs to check their Ruin totem and the generator near it. Try to hide and then look around for the totem spawns near your gen. If you find it, wellplayed, if not, just do the gen
---
I blame the entity's influence
---
It happened to me twice on PS4 so it‚Äôs quite possible
---
Found the stream sniper
---
I don't do any of those things, but I panic over it. Usually, also depends on the killer too. I have killers who know I can't run for shit let me go off, and then I have killers who tunnel me. u.u
---
Nah not really, no need to stream snipe. Kind of ruins the fun
---
Sorry, I misunderstood ur message.
---
Shut up doggo
---
are all husky eyes really bright ? or just those that I've seen in pics
---
Because users pay him to run specific builds, so he doesn't want to switch.
---
Stream snipers are scum, it should be a bannable offense in any game
---
Yup, I've learned to usually expect a 2k. A fair victory in my opinion. A 3k or 4k is always welcomed though. xD
---
You mistake me. Perhaps I should've worded it better. I'm arguing against the wording of the statement I quoted. I take issue with the use of the word rng. Also, it's rng not map rng that I took issue with. By using that word I could counter your or any statement by using the word to my benefit for instance, "Well if rng is involved my NOED use was awesome this game and even though they got the 5 gen I downed all 4  at the end and won the game." or "This one survivor I found 1 minute in messed up on a loop, got him hooked early and I denied all saves, he's dead now and the game just snowballed in my favor."See what I mean? By this logic nothing is impossible or guaranteed to happen. I take no issue with what you are saying, just the wording.

NOED is more frustrating than ruin, i can handle ruin. but NOED is just a cop out imo. that‚Äôs why whenever i play killer i don‚Äôt run NOED.
---
Truth
---
Running DS is usually a good idea when doing this to help against tunneling. But for the record the point is actually to get tunneled, you want to practice getting chased lol
---
Ruin and Huntress Lullaby for me has been amazing for me provided the hexes last at least through the first gen or two. get a few hooks, and the missed skillchecks essentially serve as a Pop Goes the Weasel gen smack. Very nice I must say in terms of stalling the game a bit.
---
I feel your pain. Billy is super strong against bad survivors but against good survivors he‚Äôs gonna get looped until all gens are done
---
Anyone else just let no mither players live just to trigger the other survivors.
---
Don't get me wrong I'm going to try hook them twice and slap them down if I get a chance but unless they are annoying as hell I'm going to reward the brave survivors.
---
If only I could get borrowed time 3 in my bloodweb
---
body blocking is fine. clicking flashlight is good for you since they are not doing gen.
---
It used to, but they changed it recently.
---
Sacrificed would be better.
---
My personal rule of thumb, a 2k or each survivor hooked once is brutal killer so that's technically counted as a win since the entity isn't displeased, 3ks and 4ks are also wins.  Basically anything that's not entity displeased is a win, unless you somehow get entity displeased with Morris thats still a win
---
Fellow day 1 60s bastard checking in
---
Try using Dead Hard over a trap with the current half step bug lmao
---
Gen rush is when everyone brings bnp's with purple toolboxes and focuses gens together so they do them as fast as possible.  Yeah it's doing the objective, but there's also fuck all the killer can do about it so it's seen as unfair and kinda sweaty.
---
So basically apart from the 5% of Billys who actually manage to curve and not stun themselves, giving even more time to the survivors, you're also describing LF in loops.
---
Well sorry for you if you don't manage to loop him like any other killer, but some people can.
---
On PS4, it's like right before the  "N" of open. I have messed with it alot lol
---
Right, so you had easy downs on 3 of the 4 survivors. That‚Äôs a pretty strong ratio. Stop chasing the one that‚Äôs a god at looping and focus on the others, forcing the looper to just do gens
---
Well, not that per say. Im always amazed that people never actually think about the rank system in a logic based sense.
---
Huge! 5Head
---
Play Wraith and bing your bong at people without uncloaking fully.
---
Survivors are toxic because that's the only thing that they can do that is fun. Their objective is literally a QTE.
---
They still done too fast but ya know I play nurse, billy, and spirit so I dont care #viable
---
I'm not a killer main, I just think the argument against NOED is stupid. 
---
Cleanse or remember totem locations and you can prevent or kill it later.
---
We could also think of such perks that allow less skilled players a buffer to not be so disadvantaged against more skilled players. I get that's why people hate them, but I just don't really think it's that bad. Sorry, the game isn't 100% skill based and different perks allow people to try different play styles. It's just how it is.
---
They still done too fast but ya know I play nurse, billy, and spirit so I dont care *viable*
---
And such is the issue as a solo player when the other 3 survivors are all looking for the totem, unbeknownst to each other.
---
*Johnny Guitar intensifies*
---
mind to elaborate? what would be the incentive to rank up?
---
This post sounds like it was written by a thirteen year old kid.
---
oh lawd he chunky
---
He certainly has an argument. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong with Nurse being top tier but Billy is up there too. It depends a lot on the person playing them, and the map you get. Billy on most farm maps is so much better than when he gets The Game map. Meanwhile, Nurse is stronger on the Game map, as well as maps with lots of visibility, such as Blood Lodge. But she struggles more on Lerys or some of the farm maps.
---
Lucky for me, I guess. I've been saving shards for that one.

No it just takes a bit when your new but once you hit rank 17 or 16 you‚Äôll start to get quick matches

OOH BOY I GET TO BE THE FIRST TO START THE RAGE THIS WEEK!

PLAYED A SPIRIT EARLIER WHO BROUGHT AN EBONY AND TUNNELED TWO TEAMMATES IMMEDIATELY OFF FIRST HOOK TO GO FOR THE MORI. WE WOUND UP GETTING ALL GENS DONE BUT REGRETTABLY THIRD TEAMMATE GOES DOWN AS I'M OPENING EXIT. I TBAG AT GATE FOR KILLER BMING MY TEAMMATES BY TUNNELING FOR MORI.
---
THEY CONFRONT ME IN CHAT, TELL ME I'M CANCER FOR TBAGGING AND SAY I'M THE REASON PEOPLE HATE THIS COMMUNITY.
---
[GET SOME PERSPECTIVE YOU FUCKING IDIOT.] (/intensifies)
---
ALSO PLAYED THEM TWO GAMES LATER AS FRED. THEY BROUGHT MORI, M1'D ME ENTIRE TIME I WAS ON HOOK, TUNNELED AND MORI'D ME AND SAID VERBATIM "TBAG THAT YOU STUPID COCKSUCKER."
---
IMAGINE THINKING I CARED. BUT WHAT A SALTY DICK.
---
Yes but mic/SWF is the most powerful tool against any killer, not just Billy.

Wouldn't doubt it.
---
What else will they do in between their long queues, even though according to them playing killer is unfun and massively underpowered?
---
Borrowed Time changes a lot. Without it many saves I see playing killer would result in the rescued basically instantly being back on the hook. You can rescue right in front of me with that shit and you say it doesn't change anything?
---
Mookle Mires
---
That's true. But then they've got all that time to search for totems to break as well and they're still getting a ton of BP/work towards pipping done.
---
I'm just never going to be open to an argument NOED is OP, I don't think.
---
I have no problems getting into games both as killer and survivor on PS4. Only exception is when there is a new killer/survivor or a event. My time for survivor is when not instantly, at most 3 to 4 minutes. And for killer ranging from 2 min to 6 minutes
---
Are they bringing a battle pass I hope not I play this game because it‚Äôs stressful but also relaxing you don‚Äôt need to worry about being rank down
---
Original Freddy was actually known, given how Fucked up the storyline was. In some outcomes he managed to turn an entire town into lunatics or corpses, and they knew who he was. In another he managed to get the government involved into giving kids some anti dream drugs. the new one just needed time until he was known by everybody.

Obviously if they unhook right in front of you then they deserve to be killed. But if a killer is specifically going out of their way to tunnel one person, there is nothing they can do about it. Borrowed time/decisive strike won‚Äôt stop a tunneller.
---
Ruin isnt even strong or op tho
---
Fair enough but how often does it happen outside the 4man swf swat teams
---
We had to cleanse 3 totems to get rid of ruin.
---
NOED is not fine because there is no way to know how many totems are cleansed (solo survivor), killers like Nurse and Spirit are way too OP with it, no one cares about cleansing them so you have to get them all by yourself.
---
Instaheals are fine as long as one shot addons and moris exist.
---
OP has been salty as hell about this since it was announced. Methinks they're mad their entry didn't win.
---
It was in a survey a few months ago. The community hates the idea but they'll still do it. The mobile version is already a preview of how they want to add micro transactions.
---
Slightly guilty, but most times it's actually a daily.  I'm using 1 perk, and it's a level 1 killer, but it's immediately ez, and they let me know at every opportunity.
---
But the fact that the game is not balanced from the top down makes this difficult when you never get to do anything fun against good survivors lol
---
Neither are OP though they are fair perks and ruin is weak even
---
ill be avoiding the fight yes, but i mean scared as in terrfied by their ghostly appearance... a hooligan is just a human, a being you need to be mindful of otherwise theyll hurt you. the spirreh is a fucking phasing ghost-type of being with a gigantic (re) appearing katana.. now tell me which one makes you shit your pants irl..
---
thats the difference in scary i meant, of course im gonna avoid a angry hooligan, but if i had to choose to fight a hooligan with a knife or a phasing katana wielding ghost then ill take the hooligan... actually since im pretty confident in my own fighting ability, ill take multiple hooligans before i optfor spirreh
---
Nurse and spirit def are the strongest, but I‚Äôd say that people severely undervalue killers like Hag and Huntress when playing red ranks. Both are very strong when used right and capable of taking on red rank teams if played well.
---
Didn‚Äôt devs explicitly state at some point that survivors will always/ more often load into lobbies at the same time because they changed the queue logic?
---
Haven't seen a killer iwth NOED in a while.
---
&gt;Gen-grabber Spirit can fight an SWF squad very well. Especially if you add Mori's to the mix.
---
This comment is nonsense on so many levels... Almost any killer can fight SWF squads if you shift the balance this much by bringing the strong add-ons with Mori's on top of it.
---
So stupid I hate it already I liked dbd because you could grind for most things
---
My point was that he still has to deal with loops and most of the really bad loops like say Haddonfield or Crotuss Penn Asylum have un-mind game-able loops.
---
slenderman wasn't a human before and most killers are humanoid killers, Slenderman wouldn't make sense and nobody owns the rights to him.
---
*DID I STUTTER*

Whatever you say. It doesn't matter how wrong you are but what matters is that you believe in it. Because Trapper with Bloody Coil and that instant down Ultra Rare can TOTALLY fight a 3-4 man SWF group. /s

there's no way they won't have a halloween event.
---
Yea I was agreeing with you
---
I mean every few games in my experience, especially the higher ranks. That's why ruin is essentially necessary.  I don't think it's possible, or at least easy whatsoever, to get more than a 1k without ruin most games I have without it.
---
The incentive is to play tougher opponents and be the better at the game. As much as people will say rank doesn't matter, it does because the competition is better and will always be better at lower ranks. Yeah there isn't a trophy at the end of reaching rank one, but it's the fact that you play and sustain in more difficult ranks. Rank matters logically if they didnt matter they would open the playerbase entirely like how F13 did. Also if they didn't matter we would have a lot more red rank players. Just because certain people feel rank doesnt matter doesn't mean that it doesnt.
---
&gt;Whatever you say. It doesn't matter how wrong you are but what matters is that you believe in it. Because Trapper with Bloody Coil and that instant down Ultra Rare can TOTALLY fight a 3-4 man SWF group. /s
---
Trapper with Iridescent Stone + Purple bag + taking the time to trap strong loops and then knowing how to chase survivors can. SWF squads will waste half the time disarming traps and the other half stepping on the very same trap they disarmed.
---
Bloody Coil isn't a very good add-on, specially if don't use any bags with it.
---
But he *has* to be shirtless, jacket still on of course.
---
You are delusional if you think a person can be useless all game (no gens, no being chased, nothing), essentially making the game a 3-man 5-gen game and still reach the end game. Second of all, if they do nothing all game, chances are they aren't injured and that 5 second sprint boost they get won't do them much.
---
Third of all, are you literally trying to day that Dead hard, a fucking broken perk that works like 2% of the time, is somehow op? Jesus Christ, you killer mains are really gripping at straws now that DS is gone. They nerf Adrenaline into the ground, next you'll complain about Bond or some shit. I am so done with you people.
---
I‚Äôd prefer them just hit the skillchecks, but at least they‚Äôre doing the gen and not searching the entire map for ten minutes trying to find the totem :/
---
Claudette, you've.... changed
---
I'm never the first to DC, but it's frustrating when I'm forced to play a match with one or more DC'ers and the killer is still playing as sweaty as they can. I try not to DC, but I'm not above killing myself on first hook just to get out of the match. Can't wait for dedicated servers.
---
Not doing a summer event to focus on other things is whatever, but I would have to think there's a zero percent chance that they wouldn't have a Halloween event for their horror game lol.

It works again thanks for the suggestion time to kill :D

So he turns into clown? Chunky as hell but with the speeds of a cheetah
---
Billy still gets cucked by Thompson House and the Slaughterhouse map (namely because of that stupid window loop). Rotten Fields is his best map in the entire game but plenty of maps are still bad for him like Lery's, to an extent The Game, roughly half of the MacMillan maps, and Haddonfield.
---
I'll give you Crotuss Penn Asylum. It's a bad map but so long as there's only one gen in the cancer building or near the cancer building he can do well in that map. Chainsaw around the cancer building, try to get them outside of that building and if you do M1 them then chainsaw to the building and try to cut them off. If you chase them inside the cancer building then you're fucked.
---
My favourite killer I love it good work
---
I play a good amount of DBD and even every 3 months feels like too many new perks from new chapters when the bloodweb grind is already so bad. I'm only now finishing leveling Jane and the Plague and I have other characters that need BP badly still.
---
Clown's gas cause higher GPU usage. If your specs isn't very high and you are playing at max capacity just to squeeze out 60fps (or even less), his gas will give you frame drops.
---
Perhaps the players had FPS issues when you did this?
---
Your eyes I can track you down + part of your face that lowers the amount of people that you can be

Watch out on the internet please 
---
Awe, that sucks.
---
Yah I knew the perk I just didn‚Äôt know that the abbreviations stood for thrill
---
Not greats but they should at least hit them
---
Easy to do with SWF not solo
---
1. **Learn the maps**. Know the basic locations of gens, pallets, vaults and totems. This comes with playtime and experiance. Chases are first and foremost about knowing where to go. 
---
2. **Dont get caught out of position**. Be proactive. Have an escape plan ready for when the killer heads your way. 
---
3. **Do fucking gens**. If you're not being pressured by the killer, if your not doing something else, you should be on a gen. Working a gen is your resting state. Not hiding from the killer, not crouching in a corner. 
---
4. **Watch streamers.** Mimic how they move around the various common map tiles. What perks are they using? 
---
5. **Play Killer.** Going against good survivors lets you see what they are doing from the other prespective. What are you having trouble countering? How are they extending chases again you? Take what is working against you and implement it into your game.
---
I mean the very fact that there is a ranked matchmaking system is pretty good evidence against what you're saying here. If this game was "just for fun," they would not have a skill-based matchmaking system at all.
---
Jeez, the sheer scoliosis
---
Is this on Netflix give the movie name I NEED CONTENT GAD DAMNINITN
---
If Technician made it so you make no noise when repairing it would be amazing.
---
I do gens as fast as i can and leave and hope the next killer doesnt do this
---
yet we have instant kill / down addons for killers which are equally rare which are totally fine ?
---
She‚Äôs pretty difficult you might‚Äôve just gotten the hang of her quickly but she‚Äôs a different play style
---
People looking for totems = less people doing generators, which slows the game down before generators are done
---
Where's the shirtless Myers???
---
I agree with the NOED thing and to a lesser extent the instaheals point, but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fair on normal killers without one hit add ons or abilities to help in a chase like the pig or wraith.
---
Probably shit luck. I haven‚Äôt touched the trapper once and still have yet to get a daily
---
Hook the person who saved.
---
That's what I'm saying, I've played killer in all ranks and what most have in common is killer times are quick, except on new killer releases, but apparently people get offended when I imply that. Which I know from actual experience ls to be the case, just shocking  how narrow minded people can be :/
---
 Come on man, did you really have to turn this post into debate. All I‚Äôm saying is that you should have fun
---
The only one that matters is Jane back
---
Nancy was there, just with a different last name. They mention her in Quentin‚Äôs bio
---
Not sure if you noticed the context of the discussion, but yeah a win is a win. Winning with a mori or iri hatchets or whatever is still a win, just like hatching out rather than opening the gates is still a win.
---
Bruh the fan favorite character is a cop.
---
Honestly, not much to discuss.  Those would be great changes.  Some might argue a bit on aura reveal distance, gate opening speed, etc. But in whole I think that would a great change.  If nothing else it gives an option to counter solo end game where right now it kind just feels like "hope I get lucky and find the hatch first."
---
edit: grammar

No HUD bug or it‚Äôs a Prayer Bead spirit trying for gen grabs?

---
Ok cool I can‚Äôt read
---
I still have no idea what this means. I think I'm getting old.
---
I always forget to not run a hex perk when I see a map brought in.  Map = professional totem hunter.  That might be a part of your issue.
---
&gt; Trapper with Iridescent Stone + Purple bag + taking the time to trap strong loops and then knowing how to chase survivors can. SWF squads will waste half the time disarming traps and the other half stepping on the very same trap they disarmed.
---
You really believe this too? It's funny. Yeah, by the time you setup your traps 1-3 gens will be done. Moreso if the squad has a guy with Object of Obsession which is something you obviously forgot about. And unless your downs them during a chase or really close to you then you can count on someone rescuing that guy way before you can get there in time. Trapper is bad but the devs refuse to buff him because he stomps newbs.
---
Now, Hag with Mint Rag does all right. But a guy with Object of Obsession still fucks her over and she's slow and still needs to setup her traps. All it takes is one guy running around trying to set off traps when you're in a chase and that removes that element of surprise completely.
---
Is there any way to know which way you will face when you teleport to a gen? I always feel super disoriented when I teleport mid chase
---
add bullettimegod if youre on your ps4 currently i just logged out for a lil while. (:
---
is that so?   
---
and who made you authority on this, exactly?  i dont run noed on pretty much all the killers i use, but if i want to i'm more than "allowed" to do so.  
---
if its in the game, its to  be used.  there has to be a reason why it hasnt been changed, right?  if it was sooooo strong, dont you think the devs would've addressed it?
---
He's from the city of England.
---
Oh? You're approaching me?
---
Instead of camping the hook you're coming right to me?
---
I mean it was its own game, Aliens VS Predator. It was a lot of fun, Predators had extremely limited ranged weapon options, but had cloak, speed, and a high powered melee attack. Xenomorphs were fast as hell, could climb walls/ceilings taking exclusive shortcuts. And the marines had a plethora of useful ranged weapons and a motion sensor.
---
got it, see ya
---
follow people as wraith with the beast add on pair it with distressing to mindfuck people
---
Those killers are very weak and need those addons. I meant things like Iridescent head huntress and just OP addons in general.
---
Never hopefully
---
Dont worry man... quite the contrary actually... be glad that you dont know... trust me...
---
It's not strong, it's just difficult to respect killers who rely on it to get kills. I never said that you needed it to get kills or that you're a bad killer. 
---
Nor did I ever claim to be an authority on the matter. I just play the game and observe the community.
---
The fingers make this so disturbing, but in a good way. Nice job!
---
The black guy is Kevin Hart, just look for a movie featuring him that isn‚Äôt Central Intelligence or Jumanji.
---
This is why people shit on me playing no Ruin Wraith and Trapper at red ranks. I can usually get around there and then it isn‚Äôt fun. No doubt, I‚Äôm not good enough to win without ruin all the time at red ranks, but MYC with Wraith is too fun. I have to try.
---
Here‚Äôs to your cake day
---
I know Kevin Hart he‚Äôs a fucking legend but I really wana know where this is from XD
---
lItErAlY fAcE cAmPiNg!!
---
tnx
---
You could play for a million hours but that doesn't mean your opinion isn't wrong and garbage. Pretend experts like you are the worst. 
---
Also lol at you bringing up Zubat like he's an authority. The guy plays at weird hours to avoid SWF squads that know what they're doing. He plays a lot of potatoes during his streams. He figured out the hours that the big time shitheads come out to play and switches to survivor to avoid them (also survivor is easier).
---
haha thanks
---
I think this would be a great idea!
---
I think left behind definitely needs a change after the change to endgame collapse and this works very well with the new conditions too :)
---
 I don't think this needs to happen but I compared it to deliverance (as it requires one safe rescue as a condition too) but comparing the result of each perk one provides a hook escape but the other provides an huge assist to escaping the game? If that makes sense? I feel like it would work with 2 safe hook rescues? Just from comparison with deliverance but if I didn't compare it like that I think it's a very good idea :) 
---
Well. The devs are really busy with other changes but if this could happen I would be for it :)
---
Smh you ignored adrenaline with no mither and self care with a purple medkit that has 2 instaheals? *pathetic*
---
That would be op, they should rather decrease the repair noise much lower than 8 meters
---
But how does that make sense? You can make the same argument about anything on the survivor side of things. I cant respect survivors who use adrenaline. And if you cant do anything without it you shouldn't play survivor.  
---
How is that a valid argument?
---
I understood what you meant but instaheals are unfair against weaker killers like the ones I said who have difficulty ending chases.
---
I may have misunderstood you but I was just saying that in some cases it could be seen as unfair to use an instaheal.
---
This isn‚Äôt marked at a shitpost so I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre serious. 
---
You‚Äôre asking for a handicap, yet calling other people ‚Äúcasuals‚Äù. The irony.

11 due to these kinds of matches
---
THEY WERE RANK 2 KILLER AND ALL RED RANK SURVIVORS, I WAS RANK 1.
---
JUST SAD TO SEE FROM A RANK 2 IMO. THE WAY YOU HAVE TO PLAY TO GET RED RANK KILLER JUST ISN'T FUN TO ME.
---
They redid the whole system. Now there are only two 'bloodwebs' (one for killer and one for survivor), and these bloodwebs only contain add-ons and offerings. Then each time you level a survivor or killer up you are offered one of two perks to choose from.
---
Overall, it's a positive change. Offerings now no longer are stuck on characters you never use as they are universal, ultra-pink add-ons are more 'rare' because they are in the large global blood web rather than character specific one, you don't need to spend BP on perks anymore, and it promotes people playing more characters
---
I suppose I didn‚Äôt say it in its entirety. 
---
When a survivor or two is in every single killer game you play, bringing instaheals and flashlights (to bm), and bringing the worst killer map offerings, for ELEVEN straight days, that‚Äôs sniping. 
---
As much as I‚Äôll rag on red rank gameplay for being incredibly unfair, the above scenario does not happen every game unless you‚Äôre being sniped.
---
You know what I mean? Can‚Äôt be arsed.
---
I don‚Äôt play killer at all cuz I‚Äôm a surv main. But I played a game today. Rank 20 killer vs 4 rank 9 survivors. I got a 4k. Survive with friends boosts rank way to much in this game
---
I knew that it was not worth wasting time writing a comment, but the message you left proves my guess.  I thought you were just a novice in a game that doesn't have three hundred hours in it. No, you're just dumb. The saddest thing is that stupid will never understand that he is stupid.
---

But FUCK; does EVERY cosmetic lately have to be purple/the most expensive?? What happened to green or yellow sets?
---
Heart attack after all the running and slashing
---
Dbddonewild already exists tho.
---
There were never maps in these matches, it was always a couple toolboxes with instaheals and flashlights
---
Sadly consoles are not part of the discussion when it comes to balancing around optimized players.
---
Ah, so like technically you could have done a 180 right before teleporting and it would spawn you face the survivor? I'll have to try that out
---
STOP SENDING ME MESSAGES YOU SALTY LITTLE SURVIVING CUNTS YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE EVERY FUCKING GAME
---
This is my games as killer. Ruin gone in .5 seconds. My survivor games however it‚Äôll still be up with 1 gen left.
---
Like, what the fuck is wrong with the entity?  He loves watching people suffer.  Just be normal with your simulations and make a porn.
---
FYI Calm Spirit should (theoretically) work agaisnt Freddy's blood snares
---
Guess it's just me
---
About 40-60 hours of playtime. Unless you are in a financial crutch, just buy them during a steam sale.  The value for your money goes further as buying one gives you both the killer/survivor in a chapter vs buying with shards only grants you one of them.
---
I'm planning on putting nurses calling and thanatophobia on him. Along with BBQ and blood hound.
---
They sure as hell make the survs depip tho.
---
Thats honestly something a lot of killers do, they let you open the gate, then hit you with like no ed or some other insta down, just killing you in the end after giving you hope.
---
Ok sure. Billy doesnt need ruin. Reasons:
---
1. Best at map pressure. 
---
2. Pop and overcharge on a high movement billy can stop most SWF.
---
3. If you used ruin against a strong SWF there's no point since they'll find it and pop it relatively fast.
---
4. Experience. SWF act like SWF what they do is predictable and with billy you can use that to your advantage. 
---
Just because you suck at billy doesnt make a ruin a must. In fact when I first played I didnt run ruin because I never leveled my hag. In fact the better at killer you are the less you need. 
---
Ps. This remains a wendy's
---
Exactly. People seem to forget to take solo play into account.
---
As a solo player you cannot communicate how many totems are left, you yourself don‚Äôt even know how many are left unless you‚Äôre keeping track and is the only one cleansing. And running around the map trying to find all of them is simply detrimental to your team as you‚Äôre not doing gens.
---
We see this with Ruin in solo queues and it can be oppressive as fuck only because you might be working on a gen but the other 3 dudes are looking for the totem. SWF can simply send one person to look for it.
---
haha ea bad
---
They should remove ruin and rework the gen system.
---
Maybe not something as accurate as an aura, maybe make the perk so the sound of the hatch can be heard from further away I crease the meters where the directional sound can be heard
---
Maybe the Entity just had a thing for torture porn? But yeah, it‚Äôs a freak regardless.
---
Just keep reposting them so they get more upvotes each time, ez. /s
---
makes sense but I'm currently rank 4 it only gets worst unless you run anti-gun builds on killers who have good map control which is why you usually see the same killers in the higher ranks (huntress,billy,nurse,spirit etc.) and I know im going to get downvoted for speaking too much truth but beacuse high rank survivors are mostly gen jockeys and SWF with other factors that allow them to progress a gen really fast they're most likey gonna pop gens less than 45 sec. even thoe this happens a lot more in high ranks it also happens in flowers too just rarely
---
What a Creepy comment.
---
Except you're missing the 1-2 s delay per "good" skillcheck, which brings the two much closer together. Although I still advocate for not gen tapping if working by yourself on a gen.
---
Oh, so he/she/it's a succubus/incubus
---
Don't think too much about it, most people here don't know what they are talking about.

Ah yes, THAT subreddit. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before the devs declare it canon.

Had one DC the moment I dropped him next to it, idk what happened
---
Lust isn‚Äôt love you fool
---
Better safe than sorry mate but lf I find it il tell ya
---
It's from Real Husbands of Hollywood I think!
---
Boys will be boys lol What can you do?
---
&gt; A majority of people are actually nice, and helpful.
---
Outside of the game, maybe.  Post game chat clearly shows a majority of survivors prefer to spout racist, homophobic, pro-suicide and generally cry they lost.
---
you can see her eye and skin color chill tf out theres 7 trillion people on earth
---
Even solos at rank one have like a hive mind of strong gameplay
---
Which is why they seriously need some punishment to DCing for both Survivor and killer, ruins the game for everyone
---
the face apped Meg makes this art.
---
This is so cool! That mask is horrifying i love it!
---
I'm about to presitge meng and just hope I get some better perks from the get go
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF SPIRIT "NOT SEEING SURVIVORS OR TRACK MARKS" IF THEY ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO MAGICALLY APPEAR DIRECTLY INSIDE MY ASSHOLE ANYWAY
---
I'm pretty sure they're hooks.
---
It's Insidious time
---
I have nurses, i really want bbq. Btw i‚Äôm pretty sure, not certain though, but you can‚Äôt see blood in feral frenzy so the blood wont be any better. Also thanatphobia is decent, but ultimately it doesn‚Äôt slow the game that much even when using legion. You should try stbfl or the spirit fury and enduring combo if you can
---
BUGS MAKE ME RAGE. 3.1.0 IS A SHITSHOW. SO MANY GAMES LOST BECAUSE OF VARIOUS BUGS THAT WAS INTRODUCED. THIS PATCH MADE ME PLAY MORE KILLER THAN SURVIVOR, AND ITS GETTING BORING TO STOMP ON THOSE POOR BASTARDS.
---
The spirit did likely get revenge.
---
In the store page her swords flavor text says, "the blade is shattered after its holder slayed loved ones" or something to that effect.
---
It sounds to me like she got revenge and is serving the entity as a price.
---
yes thats why everyone plays fps games without crosshair and pros dont use them either because they are so good at the game
---
totally not because it allows you to make accurate shots
---
not the shirtless Killer we wanted, but the one we deserved
---
 Don‚Äôt use either lol
---
More than just useless, it‚Äôs a handicap if the obsession plays their cards right with that altruism action speed bonus
---
It‚Äôs only a matter of time... Shirtless Myers soon ‚Ñ¢
---
it's all RNG man the web could give you really good stuff constantly then all the sudden it stops to only maybe do it again later
---
That‚Äôs a lotta damage!

Maybe unpopular opinion, I feel like ruin is overrated. Either gets destroyed super fast in the game and your left as a 3 perk killer or you power through it without hassle. After playing this game for 3k hours, skill checks are not really a problem. So the argument of using ruin against a good swf, Im pretty sure they won't get a shit if you have ruin or not and its not really going to effect the outcome of that game. 
---
I would rather run pop on billy over ruin, I use pop pretty much now on most killers but its really good on killers like Billy or Freddy who have amazing map pressure
---
And hopefully that never changes
---
Survivors trying to find an excuse as to why they die every game.
---
If you aren't playing Nurse, Spirit, Billy or Huntress it's probably better to use NOED.
---
Would be nice. I want to get the switch version to play on the go, but I don't want to put another 500 separate hours in it to get where I'm at. Might honestly sway me to not play it on another console.
---
SOUND IS OP IDK WHAT TO TELL YOU TRY IRONWILL BUT TBH IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK CUZ THEY CAN SEE GRASS MOVE/CROWS
---
So I should do exactly what the survivor wants me to do? So the person on death hook gets to possibly win the match because I had to hook a fresh person? When they made a bad save?
---
Killer: ‚Äú Ha ha looks like you‚Äôve been farmed now I will pick you up and sacrifice you‚Äù

*Piano starts playing*

Nea: ‚Äú I Nea Karlsson have decisive strike‚Äù

Green/yellows tend to only release with a new character.

They make them purple because characters rarely get skins so why not put time into them to make them purple worthy? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Like Legion for example only 1 skin in 7 or 8 months. If they released some greens for legion that'd be fuckin insane release a high quality changes everything skin.
---
Take attention to my user flair
---
Yeah, sure buddy. People like you are what is wrong with this community. Every perk is a "crutch" since they give you an advantage you normally wouldn't have. Miss me with this wannabe elitist bullshit. The only other good stalling perk is pop. And only on high mobility killers. Thrilling is a tracking perk, so is discordance and surveillance. Overcharge is garbage. So again.
---
Miss me with your shitlord nonsense.
---
People know where totems spawn. If you get one hook before ruin is destroyed and still 5 gens are left, ruin did its job. Don't expect for it to stay in a match for a long time.
---
Bieng a angry ghost lasy I assume she killed him if she has it.
---
I could be wrong though.
---
That‚Äôs kinda worse, they need to keep it one word like everyone else. I like ‚ÄúThe Facade‚Äù or ‚Äúthe mask‚Äù
---
&gt;Also lol at you bringing up Zubat like he's an authority. The guy plays at weird hours to avoid SWF squads that know what they're doing. He plays a lot of potatoes during his streams. He figured out the hours that the big time shitheads come out to play and switches to survivor to avoid them (also survivor is easier).
---
LOL
---
Sounds like an amazing theory. Do you have your tin foil hat on?
---
I am not even going to waste my time with you anymore. In another comment you complained about DS, BT and Dead Hard. All three perks are mindlessly easy to counter / play around. Have a good day.
---
Stop it with your well-thought logic, sir. I upvote nonetheless.
---
:O
---
GOTTA LOVE HOW PPL KEEP DCING JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING A CERTAIN KILLER. I GET IT BUT COME ON YOU'RE SANDBAGGING YOUR ENTIRE TEAM AND MY HOOKS. I NEED MY BBQ STACKS!
---
I agree but this kinda promotes disconnecting
---
He's literally been stream sniped, by the same two people, every single killer game he's played for the last eleven straight days. 
---
That's grounds for being salty.
---
And reporting them hasn't done shit. So, yeah.
---
Were you last alive?
---
I‚Äôm on console, and sadly this isn‚Äôt the truth. I‚Äôve reached rank 1 with every killer but nurse. I have now dedicated this season to nurse and have reached rank 5. I‚Äôve heard from a lot of survivors how great of a nurse I am, and due to this, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that she‚Äôs pretty butt on console.  She‚Äôs extremely difficult to master on console, but I do feel like it is obtainable.... maybe.
---
I mean a single cell is worth a cent and some cosmetics cost thousands of cells so...
---
How did you do the mask?
---
This is the 'ole "is-ought" gap you're trying to close, just because there is a rank system, doesn't mean you ought to climb it. Most people play games for fun anyways
---
I recommend every solo queue player bring BT and DS for this reason. Clutch perks that help alleviate bad teammates and a lack of coordination
---
Yeah it would be nice. Just sucks. Even if they lessen the grind I‚Äôd be happy. But also like characters that I‚Äôve bought, but they‚Äôd definitely not do that.
---
Ive never hooked someone after letting them think I was letting them escape, but I have downed ppl just as the gate opened and let them think I was taking them to a hook before I drop them and let them crawl out.
---
it was a joke.
---
"Slows down the game a little bit"
---
Rip me then
---
Nope there were 2 survivors left
---
&gt;Unlike other killers it's never stated that Amanda enjoys sacrificing survivors, in fact in Saw III she's engaging in severe self-harm.
---
She doesn't view others as worthy as her though to continue to live on though, which is why she actively goes the execution route with all of her traps over what Jiggy did.  I don't think you have to enjoy the killing to be a monster in terms of horror movie villains given that she seems perfectly fine with ending "Lesser" lives who aren't strong enough to survive their rib cage being ripped open or other such fates.
---
I think our fanbase shows Amanda differently than the movies or universe she was in did.  The entire point of her final act with Jigsaw is showing that he was fully aware of her BS from the mentor addiction to continuing to break the reason why she was brought on to breaking core principles of his.  She's mislead early on but by the end she's definitely aware of what she is doing hard enough by the end of her "Life."
---
EDIT: I'm also pretty sure it's stated that she SOUGHT OUT Jigsaw after Saw 1 which is why Saw 2 has her doing the "Betrayal" at the end.  I use a lot of quotes because that betrayal was so well earned that I don't feel bad for the dude who got backstabbed.

Great job! :)

---
It's critical getting used to looking behind you while being chased. Watch youtube tutorials and streamers play could really help you understand things well too. You'll learn more stuff as you play on tbh so don't worry too much bout it, having a rather aggressive playstyle as a survivor lets you learn things faster too (not telling you to teabag the killer and be toxic).
---
You'll still be able to do that. The battle pass is purely cosmetic and you'll be able to grind the upcoming Archives without having to spend money.
---
I hired a lovely person on Etsy, because I don‚Äôt have those kind of skills :)
---
Tunneling is a stupid strategy then since the game itself literally influences you to not do that. Even if it is your obsession you won't get half the points you could if you were going for someone else. In the end you just come off as a toxic dickhole.
---
Yea but red rank killer and solo queue survivor make it pretty tough sometimes
---
Prove thyself isn't an addon, provethyself is a one time use addon that adds 15% to a single generator if you manage to hit the two skill checks.
---
The only addon that survivors have that is op is literally instaheals, if you really think brand new part is op you should have played when it used to instantly complete a generator.
---
can't expose me if i'm effectively exposed the whole game
---
lemow gottem
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
WHY IS THE CORN IS DIFFERENT COLOR AM I DUMB OR IS IT LIGHTER NOW?!?!? ITS BOTHERING ME SO MUCH
---
I hardly play seriously so dunno much about ranks but I remember I‚Äôm killer rank 20, ‚Äúgetting to the lower ranks‚Äù does that mean your rank gets lower? Ooorr I don‚Äôt know
---
It's a game of attrition and killers are losing. Survivor skill at hitting skillchecks is rising. For every perk we have that slows down gens, survivors have perks and items to speed them. Every good stalling perk is either a hex (removable) or has requirements (PGTW). 6 minute games are becoming the average. Drop that by two minutes with an efficient 4 stack SWF.
---
*Big Iron has entered the chat*
---
Hate to be that guy but 7 billion
---
This post proves that gamers have a limited amount of jokes
---
Yep.  Depends on your performance/time in game.  The number of shards you get per match is influenced slightly by performance, but mostly by how much time you spent in match.  And there is a cap as well, so if you are stuck in a 30 minute three gen/hide and seek match, you'll get roughly the same as the 8-10 minute normal match.   
---
The $/hour grind is extremely pitiful to the point many mobile games let you earn their freemium currency at a faster rate.
---
If I see a secret offering from the killer I leave majority of the time, why would I wait in a 20 min q just to depip and have 4 minute playtime lol yeah fucking right
---
Exhaustion addons.
---
I played around with it yesterday and was just ‚Äúok‚Äù. Last month when I gave it a shot, my killer lost me in the corn and I got up and found the hatch. Obviously not a good perk but it‚Äôs funny when it works
---
It‚Äôll be years friend, courts are slow and that‚Äôs a huge licensing lawsuit
---
1500 points tho
---
*walks into the room, points at a message*
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just garbage at the game.‚Äù
---
*leaves*
---
Have you done Mr. Myers yet?
---
well done on the mask
---
not complete garbage, but yeah... wish they were better than what they are
---
def not a complaint
---
Cleanses ruin
---
Killer tunnels you.
---
Brings you to the basement
---
You: Ah shit, here we go again.
---
without ruin it can happen a lot more often than you think, especially if you're chasing a survivor that's good at looping
---
Yes I have: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Shape-Wallpaper-761027229
---
*best girl
---
I accept it only if it comes with a billy skin where his chainsaw becomes a giant vibrator.
---
Every night while you‚Äôre trying to fall asleep, leave killer running and keep starting new games until you fall asleep. Just be afk each game and only start looking for new games. This way you‚Äôll depip every night, should be able to keep your rank pretty high.
---
This is what good survivors do to killers that have no chase power. They all need ruin except nurse.
---
Lol he‚Äôll be like BUDDY!
---
Holy shit, look closely you can see his nips
---
I love the neon Nea skin and I actually do plan on buying it since she‚Äôs tied for my favorite survivor. But when I‚Äôm killer, that skin just intimidates me lmao
---
&gt;erghtfc
---
You are very observant. I like it.
---
I must heal, my people needs me.
---
&gt;This is what I mean by good survivors. Yes he needs ruin.
---
&gt;https://youtu.be/EuKrEiXfRak
---
If you play like that billy... not even Ruin will help you. He had two survivors cornered in that beginning, one injured and decided to drop chase with both because Tinkerer went off on a gen that was already lost.
---
But thanks for giving that example, it showed a lot about **your** understanding of the game and why you think billy needs ruin.
---
The games hardly been out for 3
---
I wanted to say like as long is it works... but nvm.
---
Break ALL of the totems in case of NOED and any active hexes, also free points
---
Finally someone who found suspicious stuff related to Mikasa wrote and posted about it. Ive talked to a few people who got scammed by him even by 450$, but they didnt want to post about it because they didnt want to get attention. Thanks for doing this and spending time to write this post. &lt;3
---
If I was the entity I‚Äôd force the killers to fight, that‚Äôd be pretty fun to watch.
---
This video hurt your argument. 
---
You are aware of this, right?
---
Try playing killer and you'll see how "op" they are.
---
That maybe the worst billy I have seen.
---
Slightly off topic but I have had way more success running discordance, pgtw, and thanatophobia all I need is for surveillance to show up in my bloodweb to complete my anti-gen build. Ruin is soo easy to counter its depressing
---
Cool mask but looking at it makes me wonder how the hell do they even see anything.
---
FLASHLIGHT PURPLE
---
Made the meme for a laugh, but she has just had a buff I think? Had her transition speed between standing and crouching increased.
---
Much easier to counter as SWF for obvious reasons.
---
If you are solo, you can try initiating working on it, then hide or go near a good loop. If the killer comes, just keep doing this until he gets bored and stops comming, then actually do it.
---
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CHANGED CORN BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE. I WOULD LOVE IF WE COULD GO AN UPDATE WITHOUT CORN BEING CHANGED AGAIN AND AGAIN.
---
Oh darn, you got us! What a shame everyone will be running No mither now. Drat, bamboozled again. I sure hope I don‚Äôt run into a bunch of survivors running such a good perk like *no mither*.
---
Then let‚Äôs bring back the old decisive. Nothing wrong with survivors having perks that increase their chances of survival!
---
In before: ‚Äúold decisive had no counter‚Äù learn to dribble my dude
---
underrated comment.
---
I remember an I survived story, where a woman was shot several times, even a shotgun to the face. She survived.
---
Fucking legend!
---
Just work through it,have quick reflexes and just do the generators. That or just annoy the killer by repeatedly touching their totems and if they are in a Chase better hope they don't abandon it.
---
Spam a totem until they start chasing you or they rage quit from the notifications. 
---
Adrenaline doesn't reward for winning. Frankly, it's not losing or winning until you're out. It actually rewards for *other* people finishing gens. NoED on the other hand isn't really a reward, as much as it is the punishment for not breaking totems.
---
Best feeling in the game is one-hitting people who t-bag while they're in the Exit Gates. I had one the other day, just doing the t-bag and they didn't realise I was using NOED. They died. ;)
---
You might wanna report it to the dev's with some gameplay. You don't want to get reported for hacking.
---
was gonna say "what if he only has level 1/2 ruin?" then I remembered
---
Can't wait to see it
---
Yeah killer adapts are fucked right now.
---
Using David King? Mine was against the spirit
---
They also hard counter billy, bubba and Ghostface! Good stuff.
---
Yes I would love to play prayer beads spirit that has almost no counters.
---
I always love it when  a killer tries to do this but I have dead hard or sprint burst and they fail miserably
---
&gt; What if it is a woman
---
what if she's a lesbian?
---
That's what we call an UNSAFE hook rescue
---
Hhahahaha...thank you im glad someone understands.
---
She's trying to impress Frank
---
Collar stay poppinnnnnn
---
Generally, just power through gens as fast as possible. If you are good at looping, just piss off the killer by "gen-tapping" the hex totem to get attention and then hide/loop him and hope your teammates aren't potatoes.   In SWF, you can do 2 different totems at once, and the loser has to loop/die.
---
üì†
---
I feel bad for Claudette mains. Now they have like 5 auric only purples.
---
Also RIP ever having actual swimsuit cosmetics.
---
To me doing gens is winning, you're doing objectives that get you close to escaping how is that not winning.
---
How are solo survivors expected to break all 5 totems.
---
Is it only in KYF?
---
Man I'm poppin all these pips, got survivors crying and shit
---
Tru
---
This is the same joke
---
What a nice guy... Looking out for the girls in our community, making sure they're cautious.
---
I don‚Äôt think she needs a nerf they should just buff everyone and make everyone in the game op
---
but if you get the golden edition, it comes with many skins for the pallet and a free "suprise mechanic"!    only $52.99!
---
Yup, I've commented on that before, her skill floor is really not that high. Yes it takes more time to learn her than say the Wraith but it's not like she's some super hard to learn MOBA hero that takes hundreds of hours to get down.
---
Anyways, you dare comment on that here and you got torn to bits. I'm not sure if people here are actually that bad that they struggle to learn her or if they just refuse to accept that truth and want to keep the illusion that she's really some high skill floor super hard killer to use for reason
---
I've actually done this (as a beeb Dwight) when I was brand new.
---
My thought process was, I thought the killer was taunting me. Like "oh you want the hatch? Well here bitch I'll drop you on it and you can't jump in. Now you'll bleed to death."
---
I had no idea you could jump in while crawling :/
---
Then you blind yourself because you forgot about the light underneath the mouse.
---
What about ruin level one or 2?
---
Man, I've never seen a post like this before.
---
He's saying she isn't hard to learn
---
Could you imagine him showing up around a corner with that, the girls would start/stop running and the guys would run faster.
---
*sad Pig noises*
---
Why is there a kitchen knife in my back?
---
Wait, I though ol Finder guns was a pornstar...
---
If you read the bio, its says "And the shy, naive Susie."
---
  Which possibly means that she could have been possibly desperate for friends, leading her to do that type of stuff.
---
Worst part about dbd by far
---
Don't have to worry about BT or DS if you go after the saviour. I just don't have to deal with it since I can usually see a survivor zooming across the map for a save so I can just head back and slap him during the save. Then both the saved and the saviour are injured, but the saviour doesn't have a proc of BT or DS.    
---
Also getting tunneled is not fun, which is why I don't tunnel
---
I pretty much always win without ruin but then again I've always been rank 9 killer
---
You little Vulture...
---
That is some cool cosplay.. Thnlanks for sharing.
---
I think Killers should be around Billy's power level. So most killers needs a buff, but not Nurse or Spirit.
---
Then you find out the killer has TOTH.
---
I usually use bond with a open handed 3 just for the extra range
---
I knew there were more ways to hide thats just the first one I thought of because of its 100% effectiveness in hiding your aura without taking a perk slot or involve running closer to a killer which some people might not want to do. No means was I trying to suggest this is the only way or that its perfect. Its just one way. Also games are meant to be played the way you want regardless of rules. If how you play is fun, then play that way including being immersed. It shouldnt matter if other people dont understand why you find it fun and to clarify there is a difference between playing the way you want to have fun and knowingly being an ass by facecamping or relentless tunneling.
---
You get an ultra rare add on per bloodweb once you've maxed out and a bloodweb is around 50k. If you are using BBQ you can pretty confidently have ulra rare add ons for each game

"...."

*Exposed*
---
CAN SOMEONE FUCKING TELL ME, IS THIS SO FUCKING HARD FOR DEVS TO MAKE IT THAT 2 PEOPLE CAN GO THROUGH DOOR AT THE SAME TIME???? KETTONG KILLED OVER SOMETHING SO PETTY IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING.
---
Iron grasp and agitation for extra snowballing
---
He said OP, even has it in title.  wtf are you reading or jsut to busy to dv?
---
I'm a noob with currently 67 hours played.
---
Doctor is my absolute favorite killer to play. Bought the DLC originally because of the good survivor addons and because I only played survivor in the first 40 hours.
---
Where did you get that dress omg
---
I suppose so - but the gens I do with HEX: Ruin on still get completed in 80 seconds. The bonus just makes things quicker, but 80 seconds is the standard and I'm good with that.
---
Although I think people should always power through ruin, you are right. The bonus percentages would be nice but oh well - at least it's not as slow as gen-tapping.
---
and what if it's NOT haunted grounds? gotta check fam, my burning curiosity gonna kill you all
---
Not only that, but how in all hell didn't he bled out to death before an ambulance arrived, did he rolled himself like a bloody caterpillar in a sheet to slow the bleeding?
---
As a filthy survivor main I follow only one rule when it comes to totems:
---
**If it glows it goes!**
---
Haha it was a gift so idk I‚Äôm sorry!
---
Adam and Jeff need to switch and then it's accurate. Also Feng in the second one
---
I'm a noob. Care to explain?
---
Nah I think it is death, it's happened to me before it just skips over the second hook and I just died. May be a bug which has never seen the day of light because it happened to me almost a year ago.
---
What about huntress lullaby
---
Fair
---
WHY IS THE BUG WHERE IF THE EXIT GATES ARE OPEN BUT YOU RUN THROUGH THEM YOU DONT ESCAPE BUT INSTEAD GLITCH OUT OF THE MAP STILL A THING. I MEAN COME ON ITS BEEN 3 YEARS, I WOULD RATHER NEVER HAVE AN EVENT AGAIN THAN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS BUG FOR ANOTHER SECOND
---
Maybe she's been spending too much of her free time with David King?
---
Me as a claudette main at -literally- any point in the game.
---
What is gen tapping?
---
so ambush is even LESS useful... wow
---
I tap the totem and hide and keep doing it like 4 or 5 times and usally the killer assumes I left it again and that‚Äôs when I keep breaking it. On top of doing this it also wastes the killers time going back to the totem to see no one on it
---
Dead Hard is so easy to bait out though...
---
Texas Chainsaw Massacre has to be one of the most disturbing movies i've ever seen xD
---
That's amazing!!!
---
So cool !!!
---
Bruh this isn‚Äôt Striking Vipers
---
brb Karl is online
---
I see you've discovered Dead By Daylight fanfiction.
---
As someone who often quits playing when I find myself on a downward spiral into the single digits, I agree.
---
Damn it's so cute
---
Nothing like a threat disguised as some wierd kind of concern wouldn't pay it any mind, 
---
I hear its pretty hard to track people who have been taken by the entity even with a lead as concrete as a photo of a single eye and a quater of their face.
---
‚ÄúThe lore said she was naive and shys‚Äù she fucking kills people. Lol stop it.
---
With how the lawsuit's been going on. I sincerely doubt it'll end within 2 months, especially with how much dosh F13 makes as a series.
---
I've had this happen on the other end. Thought it was an exploit but guess not.
---
Unfortunately I was around rank 10 at the time so killers often didn't have that sense of courtesy yet.
---
I mean maybe, I just think it‚Äôs poorly designed and is at at point where it‚Äôs either op or useless with basically no in between
---
&gt; and even reinstalled Easy Anti-Cheat and then the whole game
---
Yeah... Nothing changed. I even tried tutorial they have on one of the steam posts. Still the same...
---
At least he sounds like he enjoys his job.
---
What does his hat say? I can‚Äôt make it out
---
Hahahahahahah
---
.....hahahahahaha....damn...ok kid whatever you say my guy.  "1v1 me bro! 1v1 me!" Go back to fortnite or pubg my guy.
---
It‚Äôs not an issue with matchmaking, they were probably SWF.
---
She was forced into killing the Janitor, and more or less the Entity is also forcing her to kill.
---
And then the killer SPOOKS YA! SPAGHET!
---
Ignore the goons mon ami you are right to defend the game and challenge these comments, you are right to hold your ground here and defend the fact that, yes people play these games because they are fun. Dont let a few bell ends dissuade you from that
---
Hopefully, it'll put this Susie stuff to rest
---
Top tier creepy
---
Regardless of how long they last it can really screw up a start of a chase.
---
You don't get anything out of ranking up so I don't see any reason to try.

Wasnt Suzie the one the shopkeeper grabbed? Frank was protecting her, angry that someone would mess with her
---
This is the best counter to BBQ + Pop on Freddy
---
Maybe we should put a tax on pallets so people won't use all of them up before the first generator gets done.
---
it‚Äôs literally not that bad. just cleanse it, fellow survivor mains. or ignore. that works too.
---
Ah sex and whiplash great combo
---
When the devs don't give Myers cosmetics so you start coming up with your own ideas. 
---
P.S: I want shirtless Myers so I took a shirtless pic of me and edited Myers' face on it for my entertainment. But maybe I shouldn't link that. Unless...
---
Shitposts like this are a way better than hearing ‚Äúthe pig/suzie/ LF is cute, shirtless Myers.‚Äù For the millionth time.
---
But thats literally the worst case that it comes out at approximately the same time. If you Hit one Single great skillcheck you save 6 seconds.
---
Toxic Killer : Playing properly
---
It's reverse. Rank 1 would be the best ranked players. You start at 20 them proceed to climb down the ladder toward the pits of hell where all the best players live.
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
What was he doing there while carrying her with the rapid fire swings?
---
Work with what you‚Äôve got good on you
---
It'll probably fixed in September when the next big update happens. Since it wasn't in the hotfix and even 1 hotfix is rare for bhvr.
---
Spirit is fine maybe just her prayer bread is a bit OP
---
Myers-Chan
---
Hell yeah, thanks friend.
---
No Mither is the best perk in the game, change my mind. 
---
Counters Billy, LF's, Myers' and Ghostface's power like a Chad
---
Counters one hit Huntress addons
---
Leave no bloodpools because you ain't got no time to bleed and ultimately cancel Sloppy Butcher
---
Pick your ass up like a man anytime you want
---
Run Resilience and perma 9% easy, and if you're even more ballsy run Spine Chill for 15% increase like a madlad 
---
Don't need to heal so no worrying about shit like Nurse's Calling and Coulrophobia
---
Then go ahead it's part if the game stop being a toxic salty survivor main
---
Whoa that‚Äôs funky, oh well I play like once‚Äôs every 2 months or so haha
---
I didn‚Äôt get that so I dunno.
---
Any angry killer main who is offended by this joke?
---
Never mind it was Julie F
---
Complaining about something being broken is me being a salty toxic survivor main? What the hell?
---
Let me guess, you can't get a 4k without the most op addons and perks?
---
Tunnelling - is when the killer focuses on one survivor continuosly chasing them specifically untill they're dead.
---
Took me a while to work that one out when I started playing aswell as, 
---
Exposed means you get downed in one hit not that the killer will know your location.
---
You didn‚Äôt have to say that
---
Exactly, you literally have to get to ruin before they do or else you just won't be able to cleanse it. As soon as you disarm the trap, he stops whatever he is doing and goes straight for the totem.
---
So I am 15 days early on 3 years. What kind of OCD you have?
---
So nice of you to heal the claudette
---
Standard "Try to restart the game" and then my player ID.
---
Yep, there‚Äôs many trash perks I wish I didn‚Äôt have the teachable of.
---
now kiss
---
SAME UNLESS ITS THAT SPECIAL GROUP OF ALL CLAUDETTES OR JAKES! BUT I DON‚ÄôT MORI TILL YOU ARE ON 3RD HOOK, BECAUSE IM A GREEDY FUCK AND WANT ALL MY POINTS, THEN YOUR USELESS TO ME!
---
Uh no?
---
Man, it‚Äôs not mandatory to reply to any posts, no need to be nasty.
---
 SOLO Q. NEEDS. A. FUCKING. TOTEM. COUNTER
---
IM GETTING FUCKED BY NOED EVERY GAME, I CANT CLEANSE EVERY TOTEM. AND IT ADDS ANOTHER OBJECTIVE FOR SURVIVORS SO KILLER MAINS CANT CRY
---
Then I dont use the most OP addons and perks to get 4ks
---
this just in: why i‚Äôd pick literally anything over ruin
---
I feel like there may have been some rage off that red rank lol
---
HEHE I'LL BRING A MORI WHEN I HAVE A DAILY AND SOMETIMES FORGET TO USE IT.
---
THEY CHANGED IT, I CAN SEE BETTER THRU IT NOW WITH MYERS.
---
As a survivor main I will say :  
---
If you are afraid to lose, don't play. We don't need people like these in the game.
---
The sad part is it usually depends on the player instead of the killer in that sense. Wish a team would stick around and get a feel for a game instead of just instantly dc. I‚Äôd much rather face a doctor than nurse on that map. lol
---
I LITERALLY HAVE A CLIP OF REVEALING HIM AND GETTING EXPOSED AT THE SAME TIME
---
Battle passes only work for free games since you arnt taking your customers money for access to the game.
---
XD
---
I enjoy myself by getting pips tho...
---
Don‚Äôt use FD if the survivor are not bring items. I only bring FD if there‚Äôs FL. That‚Äôs my only threat to survivors. TB? Nah I can end loops faster and track survivors from far away plus I have a really good headset which I can hear them running, moaning (injured) etc. I like your build. I‚Äôm a legion main plus a hag main. On legion my build is, enduring, spirit fury, ruin, and BBQ and chilli. On hag I do the basement build. STBFL, iron grasp, the perk we‚Äôre you carry them faster (I‚Äôm having a brain fart), ruin.
---
Hahahahahha....im dying...bro I dont know you! I dont or have ever had a PS4 you literally have never seen before today. You resorting to lying now, because you had a bad argument. Thats freaking hilarious. My guy you need to play something else if youre just gonna straight up lie on people. Come on now kid. I get you feel embarrased about this but lying isnt the solution.
---
Unexpectedly funny
---
Yeah it would have to no longer be a totem at that point.
---
That‚Äôs tuff üòî
---
You also get a share of your teammates unhooking and healing. The 25% Safe Hook Rescue represents your 1 unhook and the ‚ÄúUnhooked Survivors‚Äù at 88% is what the team did as a whole. Heals are combined for all teammates.
---
The not being able to use stealth is probably the main reason they left . These players have an entire year of growth before they would even consider trying object of obsession. Lol
---
Hiiiiii Rory\~!! Hopefully I PM'd you correctly with my address :P This postcard is beautiful :D

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckbxp1/whats_the_most_sweaty_chase_you_had_with_either/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Except she literally didnt do it of her own will. The lore states Frank grabbed her hand and made her stab the janitor.
---
Watch Hostel. I think its its more disturbing because at least their reason for killing was for food and to protect their family, Hostel is more disturbing in that there isn't any reason beyond people just love torturing people.

You get dragged into a hellish forever night of which death is no escape; only to learn that you've qualified for the most competive game of the Bachelor ever.

EVER SINCE THE NEWEST UPDATE MY GAME HAS BEEN CRASHING AND MY XBOX COMPLETELY SHUTS OFF...WTF IS GOING ON?
---
Rofl whoops, thanks
---
As long as you request one, you'll receive one. It's not like a raffle, it's guaranteed. No worries!
---
I'm being serious. You wanna learn how to play against the enemy, you gotta be the enemy. 
---
I main killer, but I play survivor to learn hiding spots and perks. Makes me a better killer to play survivor and vise versa.
---
There's nothing wrong with that, you're enjoying the game in your own way!
---
Claudette gang gang, we out here, you just cant see us üòé
---
I did that at the end of the game when I thought it was noed. Needless to say I died after I cleansed the totem.
---
Don‚Äôt fuck me √∂v√¶h
---
Yea. 
---
It's still going strong homeskillet.
---
I got it! Thank you so much, Tink. I hope you like your card. &lt;3
---
You don't even know what the perk is called... How are you gonna call it out when you play next? 
---
"oh he's got... Uh, that perk... You know guys, the one... The uh,... He can see us after hooking us... Duh you know" 
---
Instead just say, BBQ... Learn the game and it really helps you play it easier.
---
jack the ripper was a real serial killer who raped and killed real people. he's not a fun horror movie villain dude.
---
I think a low priority system would actually work better. I think a lot of survivor mains DC a lot because there is no penalty and because they can get into a game relatively quickly compared to the killer. If survivors were made to play a certain number of games (maybe increasing the more times they do it until eventually being banned) I bet you'd see a high decrease in DCs
---
I meant in the game. What material did you made it from?
---
So.
---
I did find this funny, like really funny for some reason.
---
But, why is this on the DBD sub reddit? This literally has nothing to do with DBD, except for 
---
Bubba, which wasn't created by Behaviour. 
---
Not hating, just saying, this could've been posted somewhere else.
---
The doctor is fully willing to kill and experiment on survivors, so I doubt the entity had to encourage him. His wounds are likely self-inflicted to allow him to channel his shock therapy.
---
I HATE BORKED SERVER. ALSO NURSE IS BORKED. EVERYTHING IS BORKED. WE DID A PRETTY BORKED JOB SO FAR.

I FEEL LIKE YOU‚ÄôRE SPEAKING DIRECTLY INTO MY SOUL

Why would you use dying light for any other reason. The perk encourages tunneling
---
I'm on console and I loop killers all the time but doctors always seem to catch me, I'm rank 9 btw
---
I want this hillbilly skin except with Gucci flip flops
---
And yet, you've been bitching about it since it was announced, seemingly unaware of the term "opinion"
---
You're either taking this personally because you didn't win, or you need to sort your priorities.
---
i wanted to see janes new cosmetics in game : (
---
wtf is happening here?
---
You obviously dont know how badly peer pressure can effect someone. Also - from what we know I wouldnt put it past Frank to be a manipulative and emotionally toxic if not abusive person. He goes and hangs out with high schoolers he doesnt even know when hes graduated? Straight from the Piped Piper of Tuscon.
---
y u so mean to my boi Frank? :(
---
YEA BUT SOMES IM NOT IN THE MOOD TO PLAY AGAINST UNFUN KILLERS THOUGH.
---
anyone have Susie but still main Julie? Julies UNITE
---
Not. Not really. *She did not do that willingly she was fucking forced to.*
---
YESTERDAY, WAS PLAYING SURVIVOR AGAINST MYERS, RIGHT?!
---
SEE MYERS HEADING TOWARDS ME AND DECIDED TO TRY TO HIDE.
---
HAD A PRETTY DAMN GOOD HIDING SPOT...EXCEPT THERE WAS ONE PROBLEM:
---
A FUCKING MEG DECIDED TO TRY TO HIDE WITH ME!
---
HER STUPID ASS RED JACKET PROTRUDING OUT FROM THE SPOT GAVE US BOTH AWAY!
---
OH, BUT IT GETS WORSE!
---
THE MYERS SPOTTED US AND WAS USING HIS STALK. THE MEG HOWEVER, DIDN'T NOTICE HIM!!!
---
SO I WAS TRAPPED IN A CORNER BY THIS BRAINDEAD MEG WHILE A MYERS GOT A FREE EVIL WITHIN PROC.
---
EVENTUALLY, SHE RAN. FORTUNATELY, SHE WAS THE ONE HIT WITH THE INSTA-DOWN.
---
AND YOU BET YOUR ASS I DIDN'T GET HER OFF HOOK.
---
So because I didn‚Äôt win that means I HAVE to have taken it personally instead of formulating that I don‚Äôt like that a low effort character sheet beat out a bunch of well drawn and amazing skins. Pfft your a joke
---
I know, but i thought you might say NOED xounters genrushing
---
Cause I love Frank as a character - but let's be real he a PoS
---
I saw a streamer do this once. Said he wouldn‚Äôt accept a free hatch.
---
Bro you sound dumb af after reading this thread.
---
Recording gameplay with the phone camera? That‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôve ascended üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve been practicing with nurse lately, went 5 games in a row without a single hook. Game six the stars aligned and the gods blessed me for a bit. I had 2 on hooks 1 slugged on the ground next to a hook and as soon as I hit the 4th for the second time this happened to me. Really killed my morale.
---
Once I got back in game I got a message from one of the survivors ridiculing me for DCing as if I did it on purpose.
---
Instasaw, Omegablinks, Multiblinks, Prayer Beads. Mint Rag. That's all 5 of them. Let's talk about them.
---
Instasaw. Using the fastest charge addons, Primer Bulb and Carburetor Tuning Guide, you turn a 3 second saw charge into a 1.92 second charge. It turns a 3 second charge to a 2 second charge. One second of difference. With addons people swear are uncounterable.
---
Omegablinks. Using both range increase addons, Ataxic Respiration and Catatonic Boy's Treasure, the max blink range goes from 20 meters to 27 meters. This increases effective blink time and blink travel speed by 35% That may sound like a lot, but again, it saves about 2 total seconds in blink charge and blink travel. Not enough to warrant the infamy it has generated. 
---
Multiblinks. These are nuts, I'll give you that, because they try to balance those addons with menial downsides that have no impact on Nurse performance. The biggest offender being Fragile Wheeze adding a 3rd blink with no downsides. Multiblink drastically increases margin for error by allowing for more chances to correct blinks.
---
Prayer Beads. Turns off the Spirit phase walk vacuum sound. If you can't hear footsteps or pay attention to moving grass, this addon feels like hell for you. For those of us blessed with awareness of our surroundings, it just removes a very obvious warning that we're getting chased. Aside from that, it adds nothing to the power. No movespeed, no charge speed, no recovery speed. It just removes warning when out of her terror radius. In chase, this addon makes *zero difference* since the phase sound is already muted in Spirit terror radius.
---
Mint Rag. This addon allows Hag to manually teleport to any trap on the level and puts the trap teleport on a 15 second cooldown. This is only here because it drastically increases Hag play potential and turns Make Your Choice into the deadliest instadown in the game on her. However, it only guarantees the first hit. She still has to chase the survivor and is unable to cut them off anymore with traps for 15 seconds. This addon only increases the range from which she can threaten survivors to a global scale. She realistically won't even use it as often as it comes up because to gain a benefit from the global range, she'd constantly be dropping chases to cut someone else off.
---
These are the best possible killer addon combinations in the entire game. I've gone over all of them, and outside of Multiblinks, they hardly hold the same weight that comes with fully healing oneself or a downed teammate. 
---
However, instaheals are only as good as the person healed. If you are a good looper or can  constantly hump a strong loop, that third healthstate will be worth massive gen progress. If you are a potato, that instaheal is going to end with you just dropping more pallets in a pathetic attempt to stall your inevitable death. However, as an endgame item, there are absolutely none stronger, and it almost guarantees an escape for whoever is on the receiving end of that heal. Of all of the addons in the game, this is the biggest offender for having too much strength and deciding the outcome of a game.
---
I was just thinking the other day: "I'll never get where did they go? achievement, because I don't have friends." And I got it with this random solo match.
---
I FEEL LIKE IF THEY JUST FIXED THE MATCHMAKING, ADDING BETTER RANKS, A LESS STUPID RANK RESET SYSTEM AND SHORTER KILLER QUEUE TIMES, LIKE 90% OF MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME WOULD BE SOLVED.
---
Yes, same thing just happened to me.
---
Happened to me as Billy on lery's just moried a Claudette, the Tapp was continuously fast vaulting a pallet, chainsawed him down in the exit gate.
---
Nice logic. Then spirit shouldn't be in the game because irl she would be completely dead. Nurse and plague too. Hag should also be removed because she's just a walking skeleton with some flesh on it. Killers dont have to be Trapper sized lmao
---
Excuse the Scottish accent haha
---
Could you link them?
---
thats his preference i guess, i know im always gonna take the free points
---
He sure does!
---
He stops being useful when Survivors get good which is roughly rank 6 and 5 and down.  He also gets worse if you aren't running a set build specifically made to meme people to death.  Things like Nurse with Ruin can end games faster with far less effort and get more BP for it.
---
Slug builds universally suck because you lose the ability to gain tons of BP and once Survivors find out that is all you are doing they'll be happy to just rush gens.
---
Hot Tip if you hate everyone's fun, run a KO Ruin BBQ Deerstalker Nurse build:  Slug everyone and then hook them slowly after everyone is down.
---
The threat of it could.
---
Yeah, I have the same issue. Can‚Äôt play with friends, can‚Äôt play solo. I got couple of errors and endless loading screen. Very nice, very nice.
---
Because she's forgotten what it means to be human. She's a hunter and views all creatures as prey. Hunting is all she know. She didnt choose her life, that's why I feel with her
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit, is it?
---
Read again. I didn't state that you HAVE to have taken it personally. I stated that you have far too personal of a grudge against the skin, considering you bitched about it when it came out too.
---
It's far from low effort, obviously, and being well drawn doesn't mean a skin will translate well into the game.
---
Ironic that you're calling me a joke when you get heated over a fucking skin.
---
I usually drop my item walk up to them and look up into the sky
---
i stopped running ruin for the most part because i shouldn't have to rely on a perk to play a game longer than three minutes. i also want to try different perk combinations even the meme ones. in the extremely likely chance that gens go quick, oh well. i dont care anymore.
---
Because 95% of the time the survivors aren't smart enough to try this and go just as hard trying to break the totem, resulting in easy kills for the killer.
---
https://www.etsy.com/shop/DKstudio2015?ref=search_shop_redirect
---
We dont take the Entity into consideration here
---
This happened to me the other day.
---
My teamate was healing me but we were about a meter apart.
---
It's funny because the survivors with names like "Ruin=Noob" etc. are the first in the lobby to be using 4 top tier perks and a god toolbox, and most of the time being in a 3 or 4 man SWF. You can't complain about top tier perks if you're using 4 yourself.
---
I actually had to check in-game to make sure, but actually it applies the bonus percentage to all your bloodpoints post-game. Meaning if you do hook everyone at least once (100% bonus), you get double points for all of the points earned in the whole game. So getting a total score of 20k points will award another 20k post-game. 
---
From a design perspective, it would be needlessly complex to store up to 4 different point values that all get modified by a different modifier (25, 50, 75, or 100%) based on when you got those points in the match.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
It‚Äôs just a fucking reaction meme post lol you literally said either I have to have taken it personally or I need my priorities straight like your some kind of gate keeper and if it doesn‚Äôt align with your ‚Äúpriorities‚Äù then clearly I took it personally
---
Thank you! I'll keep that in mind :D I'm currently waiting for the Shrine to put up BT or DS.
---
We are not taking about every killer - we are taking about 2 niche killers whose powers should help them more on a chase than it already does so we can have a more diverse balanced killer roster - it wont hurt survivors in any way since IT just makes changes to only 2 powers
---
I just got Legion today, currently grinding some BP to get him leveled a little, but I'm excited to give him a try :D
---
No. They said they need to be human shaped to fit the model and rig they have.
---
Well you should? Because that's what survivors are dealing with?

OG Nancy &gt; Quentin &gt; Remake Nancy
---
Doesn't change the fact she is shit like the rest of the killers.
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until you sprint into the basement to heal a locker against Bubba
---
And this is why I won't play killer right now. Queue times are so long yet game times are so short. Punishments better be good for stuff like this.
---
It's a shit reaction meme, evidently. Nobody would have cared if you didn't act rude about it in the comments, saying "It must have been a joke entry"
---
How is it gatekeeping to tell you that you're pathetic for getting heated over a skin? All you've done is bitch and moan about how "BETTER SKINS DESERVED IT"
---
You're welcome to an opinion, but fucking hell, you act like a top class wanker about it.
---
Nea is not a killer, she is the Entity.

WHY CAN I NOT GET 250,000 BLOODPOINTS FROM POISED?!?!?

Calm Spirit could be worth just for Infectious Fright Nurses alone.

Oh God oh fuck Gru please don't hurt my family please I'm begging you

---
Gets countered in literally every other way like a boss üòé
---
Hah, that's what they get! Best thing I ever did was destroy a Survivor that'd been taunting me the whole match. They were even taunting me in the exit so I quickly knocked them down in a single hit and it was Mori time. Gotta say I've been guilty of it as well and faced the consequences. Had a few Survivor rounds where I did well, decided to play in the Exit Gate and... yeah. Can't say I've done it since.
---
Feels bad man
---
Right? I like staying at 15/16, it's pretty nice there
---
I think there's a good ammount of Killers that are almost literally fucked on it. Trapper and Billy for example. Also idk if i suck but i find nurse to be hard on it too.
---
On the other hand not many killers are "amazing" on it.
---
B 0 n )&lt;
---
Oh god plague with corrupt purge oh shi-
---
I used to be one of those survivors until I got hit with a blood warden, been traumatized ever since.
---
btw for who all doesn't like what i said you can all suck my pipi gently
---
It doesn't because the devs forgot about it while designing it.
---
Poised is new though at least.
---
Not amazing as in I'm going to 4k every time, but that's usually the results. Trapper, Billy and maybe Clown are the only Killers I'd enjoy facing on that map.
---
Done! I remember seeing this pixel art before. Must be yours and it looks AMAZING. Can‚Äôt wait to get it
---
And Head On has yet to be on the shrine.
---
Your money but i got 50 hours out of the game myself
---
Sexy Marvel Hel or Norse mythology Hel?
---
Thank you so much! I hope you like your card.
---
That one second difference can make a huge difference, also the prayer beads isn't used to gain an advantage in a chase, its to get free hooks on people in a gen because its basically impossible to counter unless you have spine chill.
---
If you as a survivor are very skilled and can make the most out of an instant heal then in my opinion that survivor deserves that win, there is clearly effort and skill that is required to make the most out of the addon. Playing as prayer beads spirit, feeling up against gens to see if survivors are on it and then grabbing them is not fun to go against and literally takes no effort at all.
---
I really don't understand it myself. I play as the Pig a lot and usually have an easy time when we end up in Lery's. Depends on the Killer and your skills, I guess. I've rarely had much trouble with the windows in that place because there's so many doors as well. Most difficult map I find as a killer in general is the Spirit's estate (hiding spot central especially for Claudettes) followed by that damn swamp. I've found as a Survivor that the most brutal map might be the meat plant. It's never fun when you hear the terror radius but you're not sure if the killer's approaching you or just below or above you, and all those ways up and down the two floors as well.
---
I mean other than like Doctor or Myers, which killers does massively well on Lery?
---
Once the lawsuit ends, I have no doubt BHVR would actively try to get a license for Jason, that is true.

Hex: devour booty
---
Big Brain time: open until first light, lights up, then yeet out of there to the second gate, a little longer of a run so the killer doesn't see you. Open the second gate while killer is busy trying to find you at first
---
fuck
---
This is me vs Spirits in the purple ranks and higher. The game needs rebalancing so bad. It‚Äôs fun but it could be so much more fun if it were balanced and the perks/addons weren‚Äôt a constant arms race.
---
Now that‚Äôs hot
---
Depends on your Killer imo. I play Billy and i have no issues with the 2 maps you stated. Maps i hate are those where i can't easily go from gen to gen. So Lery is hard for me.
---
I can't stalk worth a fuck with ghostyface at rank 12.
---
Any tips?
---
Why don't they give the brand new part treatment to them? Maybe only one hard skillcheck where the purple heals half and the pink heals a full.
---
If it was on small game I would agree and it would make the perk better. Otherwise, I think it would limit them if they want to do more hex perks that work like noed if the totem counter was at base for everyone..
---
Everyone upset at the shrine
---
me who only needs stridor and calm spirit to complete my collection
---
im so happy
---
Usually I play one game on the killer I'm leveling then 1 game off of that killer. Siphone all bp towards the leveling killer.
---
You letting a survivor live is banable?
---
High rank survivors tend to be much braver with doing gens, often staying on them until they're sure they're going to be chased.
---
They also don't rush the unhook as their teammate has 1 minute per phase, plenty of time to pressure the killer away with gens and safely unhook before they go into struggle or die.
---
Ruin is often seen as an immediate threat, but experienced survivors know they can repair gens until someone stumbles on the totem, even if they miss those great skill checks. I've seen many games lost because everyone looked for the totem and many won because we repaired most gens before even looking.
---
Understanding which pallets are strongest is important. Using the killer shack pallet to live for another minute at the start pales in comparison to using it at a vital point in the match to swing it in your favor. Everyone can get hooked twice before dying; certain pallets are worth way more than staving off your first hook.
---
Hope I can be one of the 100!
---
NOED is a pressure perk. It doesn't activate when the killer fucks up. That would be Play With Your Food. You are literally rewarded for losing chase with the ability to more easily win chases. 
---
Without Ruin, lower tier killers are expected to go into the endgame. They have no pressure for gens. Chase can only stall one survivor at a time. This is a given for all killers, good or bad. But lower tier killers spend *more* time in chase, therefore the other three survivors finish *more* gens. NOED is the reverse Ruin. It is there to create pressure in the endgame rather than the early game. 
---
However, these two portions of the game aren't weighted equally. 
---
The early game is much longer and the survivors' task is more difficult. Therefore, Ruin, the early game pressure perk, isn't nearly as strong as NOED.
---
The endgame is much shorter, and the survivors' task is much easier and requires drastically less manpower. Therefore, NOED, the endgame perk is stronger as a result.
---
Both perks are there to create pressure. They do it in different ways and are for different scenarios, but both hinder survivors in a very big way.
---
Now if you want to talk double standards, don't. With me, you will lose that argument. Fire Up operates much in the same way NOED does, strengthening killers as gens are completed. But no one complains that it gives benefits to the killer as survivors complete objectives.
---
As for a reward for fuck-ups, none is more blatant or overused as Dead Hard. The ability to extend chase because you got hit. You actually are losing the chase and gain an ability to extend it. If this perk didn't suck, it would be a serious issue in terms of balance. The perk makes up next to no distance in comparison to better Exhaustion perks. Only Sprint Burst is on par with this in the Exhaustion category as Sprint Burst can hinder survivors more than it could help. Old Decisive Strike was very unfair, as it renewed chase once you'd already lost. Dribbling worked, to an extent, but actually smart players knew to just run to a corner away from hooks and they couldn't be dribbled anywhere.
---
it has been post 4432 times already in DBD
---
Can you close the hatch mid drop? This one time a survivor was on the other side of the hatch were both sprinting for it and get to it at the same time I see her hands throw in the air as if she‚Äôs jumping in and I shut that bitch right under her and she didn‚Äôt get to escape. I swear she was in some jumping animation
---
I find unnerving pressence is decent at rank 12. Just letting any average killers know.
---
See, I can't even play Billy at all. I can't seem to control him. It's like as soon as the chainsaw's activated he's in autopilot. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. So when there's a map with a lot of obstacles and stuff to obscure your vision it's just crazy for me as someone like him. I like the cornfield because it's got such an open area but the downside I've found is the cornfield itself can be tricky to follow Survivors through if they're the types to do unpredictable crazy random movements during a chase.
---
Wow, I feel so attacked right now. I am a survivor main and Lery's is my favorite map. 
---
Personally I don't put that offering in because I think its an easy map to win, I put it in because I love the atmosphere to it. Like I don't give a fuck if I live or die in game I just wanna have a good time and the hospital setting enhances that for me. All those windows for the killer to spot me through, multiple doorways in every room, these things just add to the paranoia for me. Like you never know when you are gonna be spotted. Its also harder to keep an eye on the killer, you can see for miles in some maps, and always keep an eye on the killer, but the hospital has all those walls blocking your view. I also love the potential for traps; nothing like vaulting a hospital window and landing your dumb ass in a bear trap you didn't see, or vaulting into a hag trap and shitting yourself so hard you launch into orbit.

Then throw on some bbq stacks and distressing bonus.

Do you have this template? This is a good meme!
---
Hag. A half decent hag on Lery‚Äôs is a nightmare since her power practically covers the entire map almost with no addons. It‚Äôs both the reason why i love the map (as a hag main) and hate it (as survivor).
---
Spirt is also just good on every map so.. you know.. there‚Äôs that.
---
exactly he isn't a human or humanoid.
---
This is filth
---
FILTH
---
Ew ü§Æü§Æü§Æ we need shirtless daddy myers immediately
---
It is strong and OP, killers like Wraith are unplayable without it. How long it lasts can often determine the match. Almost every single killer main at high ranks refuses to play without it. How is it not strong?
---
Yeah dont listen to the salt boyz
---
Throw huntress lulaby on! Imagine the difficulty of that!

I'm pretty sure they renamed her to Nancy Holbrook in the remake

I'm a filthy casual and I go solo. I am rank 11 at the moment.
---
I honestly think that survivors should get a flat 100% increase to all their actions. Even with the buff the BP isnt comparable to even a decent game as killer.
---
Disconnects from real life lmao
---
Your cosplay is amazing af like why are all y'all so cool and pretty lmao
---
Huntress, Billy, Trapper, Leatherface, Nurse, Clown, Plague, and Spirit is bad on this map, if you try to follow the scratch marks while being invisible, you need to have super human reflexes with all the turns possible.
---
Myers, Pig, Ghost Face, Wraith, Doctor, Hag are pretty good. And Freddy and Legion are average.
---
He is humaniod shaped though. Do you know what that term means?
---
where do people get the "your objective is to defend the generators" no its not, my objective is to make sure no one escapes the match (if you mention the emblem system i can tell you its as "flawless" as ranking up is "rewarding"), hence the name of the perk "no one escapes death" if i do it by using an early/mid/late game build is irrelevant. People seem to think that just because you play a certain style you are either a baby or bad, but then they still get salty when all four die despite me literally letting them do gens because i wanted to play a late game build. But sure if survivors really want it I could just play omega nurse every game and laugh as not a single gen gets done before all four are dead, bet they will have alot of fun.
---
If someone is running no mither, they probably have resil and tinh, or some crazy shit like that, and if you don't find them first they are going to be finishing all your gens faster than you can say "ha, permanent thanataphobia!"
---
From my experience, if someone runs no mither they aren't scared of anything the game has for them.
---
Can't agree more, this map and The Game are definetely my favorites.
---
Pig.
---
The source im using these values from is this;
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Frederick_%22Freddy%22_Charles_Krueger
---
The jump rope is definitely 9%. It was confirmed by BHVR in the patch notes as they increased the J.R slow down from 8% to 9%. 
---
I am not sure where they got the outdoor rope value from or if its a prediction based on BHVR usual way of creating add-ons.
---
The movie is called Night School
---
Man this is so spot on. Just yesterday when I was playing I encountered a face-camping Leatherface, Spirit, Billy and Huntress. I played about 7 matches give or take. I know it‚Äôs a shitty thing to DC on killers, but I‚Äôve had enough on my last match I got camped on and  I turned off my PS4 and went to bed.
---
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT FUCKING COLOR IT IS I STILL GET CORN VISION AS IF I'M LOOKING THROUGH SATAN'S FUCKING ASSHOLE
---
FOR FUCKS SAKE DAVID SIT YOUR STUPID ASS DOWN AND LET ME CHASE YOU I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR SWEET CORN FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME
---
Yea For spirit i agree... she's just good everywhere.
---
And yea i can see Hag doing great on it, but Hag isn't a killer i see a lot.
---
getting to low ranks and having fun bruh
---
TINH is boss, because ruin skill checks are gigantic and hard to miss with it.
---
Might as well get automatic great skill checks all the time. üòä
---
Professor puppers does not care about grammar.
---
The "easy" trick is to only attempt to chainsaw survivors if they're either not paying attention, or if in a chase, if ur really close to them and they have no pallets or windows close. If they're next to a window, don't bother, go for M1.
---
Lery sucks because u cant even go from gen to gen fast
---
&gt;I'm gonna go back to sleep when I wake up I want this fixed.
---
\*BHVR nerfs Pig again\*
---
&gt;God damn it.
---
If the killer doesn't take advantage of the slow, yeah you could escape really fast. Against a good killer, generally 2 people will always be occupied, one hooked and one going for the hook. That leaves 2 survivors to work on gens which they have to hit every single Great skill check, otherwise they will lose progress on their gens.
---
I played without Ruin for a bit on Wraith, as I couldn't find it on the bloodweb, and it was horrible. A gen would be completed every single time I finished a chase. I very rarely was able to get a kill before the last gen popped ever. Then, I got Ruin. The difference in how fast the gens where done was insane. Sure, there where still some Survivors with fully decked out Toolboxes that got Gens done stupidly fast, but anyone who didn't have one was doing them so slowly. I was generally getting 2 hooks before a single Gen was done, constantly getting kills before one Gen was left, was actually able to pressure Gens as they weren't finished before I could get to them every single time. 
---
I play a bit of Survivor, I have no trouble hitting skill checks, and can somewhat reliably get Great skill checks when I need to. It really does feel crippling. Losing 5% of Gen progress every time I didn't get a Great skill check felt significant, as skill checks came up often. Plus, you always run the chance of hitting it too early trying to get a Great skill check and miss it completely. Against perfect survivors, yeah they can blow through Gens even with Ruin fast. But imagine those players without Ruin. Imagine survivors who hit Great skill checks every time while not having to worry about Ruin. Ruin still slows them down a good bit.
---
the problem with huntress is that she is very map dependent, being a 110% killer with no movement increase makes it almost impossible on larger maps and maps with tall jungle gyms you get looped for alot longer than normal killers, unless surv is autist and throw pallets early
---
Ninja builds.
---
Even when a killer would camp hatch, the survivor could still finish the generators and escape through the exit gates. Meanwhile a survivor can hide in any random locker on the map and the killer will never ever find them. Killer has never been able to prevent the game from being able to end, they can just make it last a really long time.
---
Without perks killers are only as good as the person playing them. A rank 20 player with no perks is going to give different results from a rank 1 with no perks. Especially if the rank 1 is playing on a fresh rank 20 account vs the rank 20 playing at rank 1. 
---
Experiments in this game are hard because there are just way too many variables.
---
Ok, this is epic u/alexaka1 play crab rave.
---
Considering how the trend appears to be 3% a jump between considerable to tremendous is likely another 3% increase. The slow-down being 15% is the most likely suggestion. Since BHVR usually have very weak changes to values in most of their add-ons I doubt they will share the actual value of the slowdown. 
---
A youtuber called int3r4ct is a very useful source for some of the add-on details. He gets data mined info from the add-ons and tests them to confirm the details. 
---
He also provides tips for playing each killer but using his time stamps he can be useful for finding the exact information for each killers add-ons. Im looking forward to his info on the Freddy add-ons when he gets around to making a video about it.
---
Same survivor who dies after playing *clicky clicky* melodies with flashlight and runs right to you after unhook, in order to use DS: ‚ÄúTrash tunneler‚Äù.
---
Ok I guess I didn't fully understand. Someone set up a a3rver and had perkless matches for some reason? Was it BHVR?
---
Generators normally take 80 seconds. Gentapping takes about 102 seconds. Every good skillcheck is -7 seconds (4 seconds of progress lost, freezes the progress bar for 3 seconds). Good rule of thumb is three strikes and you're out - if you hit three goods, you would have done faster gentapping.
---
But obviously if you want to learn to hit greats consistently you just have to try it and suck for awhile. An investment in the future, I guess. But if you're bad at hitting hex skillchecks and want to win this game happening right now, yeah, gentap. Everybody talks shit about it but it really is faster if you can't hit the greats.
---
We have been talking in the context of the Entity's realm this entire time.  And that's just plain not true, pallet stuns and decisive all exist.
---
The poor guy haha. Knowing he was like ‚Äúgreat I woke this guy up, now heal me....heal me please...‚Äù and then Freddy goes right for him.
---
I FEEL YOU SO MUCH, ESPECIALLY NUMBER 4, I'VE LOST COUNT OF HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME RECENTLY
---
We need more of stuff like this, these are the best
---
HEY LOOK IM NOT SAYING THERE ARE ZERO ASSHOLE DIMENSIONS TO THE BEHAVIOUR, I‚ÄôM JUST EXPLAINING WHY IT HAPPENS.
---
I ALWAYS forget about TINH because I've only ran it like twice, but yeah fo sho', I dig it.
---
Yeah unless you have them for a survivor already then you keep them until you prestige.
---
OK
---
Maybe make some of the status effects that dont have a timer be timed and buff the reduction to 40% having you recover from exhausted would be a bit broken.
---
Congratulations, you figured out the meaning on the comment
---
Just a way to complain about match making, that's all I ever see
---
You don't get adept from a 4k anymore; you have to get a merciless killer game.
---
This isn't Shirtless Hillbilly, It's grandpa Hill Billy.   
---
And I don't know why but it reminds me of the " Pepperidge Farm Remembers " meme.
---
I play exclusively at high ranks. Before I stopped playing for a bit (around when Legion was released), I was always at Red ranks. Ruin was always a help, unless it was cleansed in a few seconds. I play now close to Red ranks, just haven't sat down and dedicated myself to get all the way to Rank 1.
---
Gens take 80 seconds for one Survivor to do without Ruin, and Great skill checks only add 2% to progress. I've had 3 Gens pop that fast ONE TIME in my entire time of playing this game. It's not that uncommon for a SWF to complete a Gen that fast, but it's only ever one Gen, because to complete a Gen that fast as a single Survivor is near impossible. If you're constantly having 3 Gens done by the time you get one Survivor down with Ruin still active, then how the hell are you staying at high ranks? Because at that point, there's pretty much no coming back without running NOED.
---
I'd take a killer with actual skill over a face camper any day. 
---
When I'm first hook by a face camper, I feel like I just wasted 10 minutes getting into a game only to not have fun and not get a meaningful amount of blood points.  
---
I wish every face camper could get a taste of their own medicine to realize how completely shitty it is.  Or, you know, Behavior could change it so that campers truly get punished.
---
How many times has Infectious Freight been in the shrine?
---
PREACH FOR NEW JULIE SKINS
---
Lol!  If you need that as a perk to play killer let alone you think it should be base kit you simply haven't learned how to play killer yet.
---
So... pretty much the old exhaustion mechanic then?
---
Wait, fuck off can be unlocked ate level 40???! I tought it was 35
---
‚ÄúGG EZ BABY TRAPPER PUTTING TRAPS ON GOD PALLET AND BASEMENT WINDOW GET GUD‚Äù

BHVR FIX DEAD HARD PLSSSSSS I WANT TO USE MY FAVORITE PERK AGAIN üò§üò¢üò§
---
How can you tell it's a ruin totem?
---
Ok while I'm appreciative of any pig buff, that is the most lackluster buff I've ever seen
---
So it's more of the person's connection or the games connection?
---
Yes they gave us codes for beta test i guess it was about 2000 players
---
I've been teaching my friend who just started playing (she's currently rank 18) and we keep getting paired up with red rank killers because of me and my friends but somehow she keeps escaping. First an annoying Huntress, then a Freddy today a Bubba. I'm just proud of her.
---
Let's be real if I would sprint for 10sec I would also sound like that :D \*gasps\*
---
I have a PC too. We destroyed u kid
---
no they need to focus on balancing the game.
---
I feel like red add one should change a power rather then straight buff.
---
Curving huntress hatches.
---
Extra Legions piloted by AI.
---
The map gets REALLY dark with ghostface.
---
Hillbilly can make wide swipes with chainsaw.
---
Leather face can lunge with his chainsaw.
---
Spirit can make short dashes with her huanting instead of long sprints.
---
Myers takes off his shirt.
---
Pig gets a useful power.
---
Tell us more..
---
I did that mistake yesterday. Spent two hours reading doctor fanfiction god damn lol.
---
By waliing up to them and using your bound button to cleanse said totem.
---
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
---
Petition for Spaghett survivor and just actual Eric Wareheim as killer.
---
*angry elephant noises*
---
I dunno both i guess
---
I wouldn't call Bubba bad on Lery's at all. Above average compared to most maps for him. Spirit I completely disagree. I main her and love Lery's.
---
Of course the Nea flair would shoot down someone's idea within 2 minutes of it being posted
---
I WAS AT RUSSIA, AND NONE OF THE FAST FOOD RESTOURANTS HAD ANY FUCKING MAYONAISE!!!!
---
IM DEEPLY OFFENDED SINCE MY MAYO REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT MET
---
Nah because then you could simply run an ebony and mori directly off of hook to cheese a no effort 4K.  This is supposed to feel like an achievement so they require a double pip to ensure people don't take the least skilled approach to their 4K.
---
I thought it was laughter
---
Perhaps a middle ground.
---
When the hex is destroyed the perk permanently weakens but is still active.
---
For example.
---
Not all skill checks are effected by ruin.
---
NOED only works for 1/2 hits.
---
Huntress lulaby can only have 3/4 tokens max
---
I haven't seen this happen yet on xbox. Is this PC or console?
---
Yeah
---
OR WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR FIRST HOOK AFTER THE EXIT GATES ARE POWERED AND WHAT DO YOU SEE? THREE DUMBASSES LOOKING AT EACH OTHER READY TO LEAVE, NOT WILLING TO SAVE EVEN IF THERE'S NO NOED.
---
It really sucks. I am rank 3 and I got in a game with rank 16-20 teammates with a rank 20, peerless killer. Literally really unfair for new killers. I also got accused of swf when I only play solo unless I'm helping my friend learn how to play the game. (Note: her game wasn't even updated so that's out of the picture.)
---
I feel like no one on Reddit knows what tunneling means , they use it as a synonym for chase and it‚Äôs annoying
---
Meg with glasses :)
---
But what‚Äôs the point of purposely getting people mad. And not even the way monto does it where makes a fun build then people just get mad, it‚Äôs just stupid
---
Those are good ideas, I feel there are so many little changes that could be made to NOED that would balance it really well, but nothing is ever done about it.
---
I really doubt the entity let her kill her father.   She's a spirit held together by pure rage -- rage at her father.  The entity is a dick, he'd know that that rage would make her powerful.  And that promise of power and revenge would be incredibly powerful.  
---
At least that's how I view it.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
I 100% agree that's why most people play killer to farm BP because getting a perfect game as survivor is basically impossible
---
I couldn't agree more with you. Well spoken.
---
I bring terrible knowledge.
---
No way, man. That'd be AWESOME.    Half the fun is writing stories and drawing the concept art IMO!
---
First it was ppl dcing on being downed, then dcing on hit, and now they dc on killer spawn. The evolution continues...
---
My issue with NOED is that it inflates the kill rate. It single-handedly guarantees a kill or two in most games but they're hollow victories that make killers seem more balanced then they are. You don't see many Nurses or Spirits running NOED because they can usually win on their own. On killers like Clown or Wraith it's almost expected.
---
I don't play bubba nor camp but like sometimes it's a way to also let off frustration aswell and if you make others mad it makes you laugh and helps brighten your mood or they literally just are that sweaty for the kill
---
Having a full group running No Mither is honestly super fun.  As it turns out we actually did really well against high tier killers but the moment a fuckin' wraith showed up we got our shit slapped.
---
Could anyone link me the unedited picture of this?
---
No they will not appear in you bloodweb anymore until you get the teachables by leveling bill
---
When I started, I played with red rabks do to my friends, but it allowed me to learn my quicker then it would have if I started  by myself in low ranks
---
JUST GOT FACECAMPED BY A DAMN NURSE, THEN MY 2 TEAMMATES GOT AWAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH (NOT THEIR FAULT, THEY WERE WAITING FOR HER TO LEAVE).
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
nice.
---
Just an update for y‚Äôall. I got leatherface
---
Wraith too spooky i guess
---
I HAVE ONE OF BOTH OF US IN AN OPEN SPACE, NOT EVEN TALL GRASS AROUND AND WE‚ÄôRE BOTH ABOUT WALKING DISTANCE AWAY AND THE GAME REFUSES TO REVEAL HIM BUT HE REVEALS ME
---
i disagree with everything you said, except instaheals and what you said about adrenaline, as someone who plays alot of killer and a lot of survivor and has over 1300 hours, never camps, tunnels or uses noed and has been rank 1 multiple times as killer and survivor i'm not just the guy who says ''your opinion is wrong'' i just disagree heavily (also, have you actually met anyone who said ''you're rank 1, you can't camp or tunnel'' survivors usually accept that no matter what rank they're at they can get camped and tunneled if the killer for some reason decides to do so \*i do realise that they will still be angry about it, sometimes even when it doesn't happen\*)  also, noed is stupid and that's my opinion on your opinion about alot of peoples opinions on issues with the flawless masterpiece known as dbd, i still don't know why i wasted time writing this but i'm sure i won't ever understand that. edit: also the point about variety killers is true however saying it about survivors is maybe stretching it a bit
---
Got it, thank you!
---
Only boys with breasts
---
No not at all, it's angering because survs think they're hot shit after pulling down a pallet, a pretty easy task that usually isn't due to a killer mistake. I know because i get angry at myself as often as at survs. Playing surv generally isn't that hard and teabagging survs tend to be the ones that drop pallets the fastest like idiots.
---
And the map can be used as evidence for bodyblocking and taking the game hostage.
---
Calling the red ranks ‚Äúlow ranks‚Äùtechnically makes more sense, but for consistency purposes they are referred to as high ranks.
---
Me either but 3 and 5 sound self explanatory
---
In the game she has eye slits to see out of
---
so fucking true
---
it only really happens on The Game map. i‚Äôm a doctor main, i‚Äôve played hundreds of hours as him, i run a pretty cancer build (unnerving, distressing, overcharge, bbq) and i really only get disconnects on The Game. i recommend buying the DLC
---
Well then, the game's sales would sky rocket.
---
No chicks with dicks and boys with breasts exist too.
---
Damn hella good
---
CAN SURVIVORS STOP DCING AFTER BEING HIT ONCE?!  IM TIRED OF CRYBABY TEAMMATES!!! IVE BEEN HIT AND STILL PLAY THE GAME.  NOT ONLY DO YOU RUIN THE GAME FOR ME BUT THE KILLER TOO.  I JUST WANT TO PLAY A FULL GAME FOR ONCE.  
---
I‚ÄôM A KILLER MAIN BUT WILL PLAY SURVIVOR TO CHANGE THINGS UP ONCE IN AWHILE.  I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE GET SO DAMN ANGRY AS A SURVIVOR DURING GAMES.  YOU GOT DOWNED, OK IT SUCKS BUT IT‚ÄôS PART OF THE GAME.
---
Better yet why not cool down about Stranger Things, I don't want more licensed characters.
---
THE GAME IS A MAP THAT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO CHANCE OF HIDING ON BECAUSE ITS SO EASY TO THINGS THAT DONT BELONG ON IT. MY ONLY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IS THE KILLER BEING A DINGUS AND FOCUSING ONE PERSON WHILE WE ALL POWERHOUSE SEPERATE GENERATORS.
---
Oh fuck you too bud
---
Kinda I personally don‚Äôt like noed or adrenaline but diversion is a good perk it‚Äôs saved my life multiple times
---
The thing is survivors find games way quicker. You might be able to stack two 20k point games into the time it takes a killer to queue and play 30k point game.
---
Thank you so much! I got your message!
---
It‚Äôs been suggested a lot actually
---
That's a useful perk. It's even better when paired with a fast medkit, you unhook a mate and heal them in two seconds. Always funny when the killer comes back like "the fuck how is that hoe back to full health"
---
I don't know if my heart can take seeing Barb sacrificed in dbd
---
You legit are lucky or some shit because I constantly get gen rushed as killer and it's boring as hell and ruining the game for me
---
&gt;Forster

Me with unbreakable. As soon as i take it off i get slugged
---
She's been physically merged with all the others
---
Haha, that's why I ended up trying to sell a few of these. I wanted a few to give away for free on stream, so I paid the $300 and then sold most of them to afford the few I wanted to give away.
---
and its sibling subreddit, r/dbdgonegay for folks like me
---
Probably why most legion players are shit
---
Her actions not excusable even before the killing. She had no issue harming people and like everyone else, she made a choice which lead to where she is.
---
Yes but I still won‚Äôt like her what she went through is hard and extreme but a killer is a killer
---
I would like a resort battle postcard!
---
Alright thanks.
---
Where is cosmetics?
---
Haha, okay. Thanks. :P
---
Yeah, it never happens to me. It feels like we're playing totally different games tbh. But all the videos I watch on Youtube never have people completing 3 gens that fast. True, Monto, Otz, they never have Gens done that fast, and they don't always use Ruin.
---
Hoo boy
---
Best boy, he's a dying kind ;(
---
I have watched true get 3-4 gens done in a 1 min max before lmao
---
A lot of people are assholes as teenagers, especially when their friends peer pressure them into doing things. If she got a chance to grow up and mature she probably would've been a decent person. But that didn't happen because the entity got to her first.
---
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT YOU SPEND HALF THE ENTIRE TIME WITHIN THE KILLER'S TERROR RADIUS, BUT THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ON THE SAME FLOOR AS YOU.
---
I JUST SIT THERE DOING GENS UNTIL THE KILLER RESTS HIS BALL SACK ON MY SHOULDER, THEN I START RUNNING.
---
Lol at you not mentioning Iridescent head and Infantry Belt.
---
False, although the in-game survivors appear to be from the movies, they are really from a slightly different universe. Just look at Michael, in the original Halloween he was 5'10" but in-game he has to be at least 6'6". People always complain that Quentin and Laurie don't really look like the actors, but maybe this was an intentional move to show that they aren't the exact same characters.
---
No i dont want vigil to recover exhaustion while running i want it to have a bigger impact and have more uses by having some of the status effects that arent on timer be put on one so i can be useful on them
---
I typically get better teammates in the red ranks and i run into way less issues.
---
Checked a player I was queued up with in DBD and they managed to get every single Adept achievement at exactly the same minute a little over a month ago. 
---
Is this reportable?
---
Pls teach me sensei
---
That's more or less how I see it as well.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter even if it were ghost face, he can still charge his power / break out into a run while standing and you looking at him
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how hard you try with some killers, map design and high survivor skill can and will power through any slow map pressure you can dish out.  Ruin simply isn‚Äôt as reliable as NOED at saving you time.
---
Problem is totem spawns in general fucking suck.
---
yes
---
YEAH.  IT'S ALWAYS LOTS OF FUN TO GET YOUR FIRST HOOK AND BE FORCED TO WATCH AS LITERALLY NO ONE EVEN ATTEMPTS TO STEP FOOT ANYWHERE NEAR YOU.
---
I said in the body of the post that I‚Äôm not getting matched with survivors rank 13, I‚Äôm getting matched with survivors ranks 3 through 5 even though I‚Äôm killer rank 13 to 14.
---
If you're really, *really* focused, I'd say you could easily get all 131 achievements in a little under 3 days. All the adept achievements at the same time is fishy, though. They could possibly have been in a lobby with a hacker that unlocked all the achievements, but you should report them just to be safe. It is an exploit.
---
Woohoo free stuffs!
---
Why does everybody say No Mither counters noed?

Does it make it so that noed can't down you?
---
Or is it a joke that since you're always a one-hit anyway, it doesn't matter because you'll die anyway?
---
It really doesn't.
---
In basic mathematics 1 possesses a lesser value than 20. As such, 1 would be ranked lower because it's the smaller number of the two. You'd rather have 20 strawberries than just 1 right?
---
But in a ranking system where 1 is the best you can get and 20 the worst, 1 now possesses a higher value than 20. Because you're not just talking about the raw numbers, but about the skill level associated with that number.
---
I don't think you can.
---
with pallet vacuum and most pallets gone it shouldn't be a problem

Just need to know if I need a towel or a tarp.

Suzie is the ultimate homegirl. Bestie got her dream dick appointment so she eventually killed a guy just cuz Julie was in it too and didn't want to be that awkward bitch that ruins the fun.

Hey do you have any more info on this? I just started playing again today, and 6/7 games ive gotten this " **Rank update error** " bullshit its fucking infuriating
---
This happens to me almost every killer game. At least two red ranks. Since i dont really stand a chance (only green rank killer) it has started to put me off playing as killer at all. Especially if they're teabagging all game because they can loop me.
---
Know your vantage points. Top of the Thompson house, top of the tractors, etc. They're pretty solid for it. The trick is getting to that one spot where you can barely see them, and they can't see you. A pretty good spot for stuff like that is in between some of the boards on the Killer shack under the window. It depends on what is near them. Stalking them when they have a full line of view as to where you are is a bad idea. Stalking when you can be hidden is key
---
Uuuuhhhh that‚Äôs a no from me dawg.
---
Nah, let the pink heal 2 health states and the purple one. I‚Äôd agree that it should be a channel tho, maybe like BNP 2.0 with a rapid series of checks over a short time.

---
It always happens in matches that go very well. I could've easily escaped.

no way to do it I can think of on ps4 but its not impossible to do. you could buy a headphone splitter to plug in2 controller. have  1 output plugging in2 hifi or surround sound and the other can be 4  headphones.

You know I recently(ish) bought a new Overwatch account to practice my other characters with without affecting my rank. You have to play maybe ~10 games of unranked in order to level urself up enough to start playing ranked. These 10 games I was facing silver and bronze players (I usually am 3-4 ranks higher than this) and honestly, it was the most fun I've had in the game in months. I felt like I could do whatever I wanted, I was getting multi kills left and right, it was awesome. The thing is though, after a few games or so of this it started getting really boring, really fast. The huge plays I was making lost their flavor and I swapped back to my main account before I even played out all the games. I realized that my time at low rank gave me a ton of bad habits that took a week to work back out. 
---
Moral of the story: stomping noobs is fun. It has been since the days of Doom and it's not going to stop anytime soon. But it gets old quickly. Playing against bad opponents makes you play poorly. It takes losing and getting rekt to realize that you have holes in your gameplay; that's how you improve. And believe me, hitting a sleep dart on my main account to shut down a GOOD player's ultimate felt way better than any of the 10 play of the game's I got at low rank. There's actually risk and consequence at high rank. Your decisions actually matter because good players capitalize on them.  So yeah, it may be hard going against people more skilled than you, but it's the only way you are going to become skilled yourself.
---
I'll admit that I sometimes get in back-to-back-to-back frustrating games and end up DC'ing.  
---
The other day, I played for about 2.5 hours and didn't have a single game that was remotely fun.
---

I‚Äôm actually really happy with it, I was gonna level up nurse as the 2nd to last Killer to P3 max perk my Billy, but I got strider and now I have all 3 of her teachables from the shrine. Now I only have to get Plag to level 40, and no other killer. Until we get a new one.
---
??????????????????????
---
What kind of dumbass does that with a public profile üòÇ
---
I've had this happen only once, about a week ago I'd say. I think it's lag dependent as others have said.
---
Everyone who disliked is probably a Survivor Main  ^^
---
Pretty much this, forgot it was her speed curve not the movement speed.
---
Did you buy it in the shrine?
---
Hopper would make the most sense ;)
---
I‚Äôll never understand how some people literally only play killer or survivor, you‚Äôre neglecting half of the entire game that you bought! Both sides are fun to play for entirely different reasons I totally get, but honestly, what‚Äôs some people‚Äôs reasons for only literally playing one side?
---
pog
---
This! You will face less of these when you rank up cause they mostry target rank 10-14 in my experience. So rank 7-9 is where you have easier games again. Ofc the average survivor here vill me better but the toxic swf groups are less often encounterd.
---
Wow you guys literally did not understand op. At the end of EVERY game i play i get "rank update error" and my rank cannot be changed no matter what. This is happening to a lot of players. This is happening to OP. This is not a case of gitgud. The game is a buggy disaster. Players have been getting banned due to this error being  interpreted as a DC. I've been rank 1 since 2016 and now my rank cannot be increased or decreased from rank 12 its literally stuck and I'm afraid to play because I know others who have been banned due to this bug. 
---
Lookup "Rank Update Error" on the forums or in subreddit search bar and see the loads of results

Poor op getting bullied jesus christ

HAD A GAME WITH A PIGGY AND I HAVE TO SAY MY TEAMMATES FUCKED ME HARDER THAN SHE COULD EVER
---
WAS WORKING ON A GEN WITH ANOTHER NEA AND JEFF FUCKING POPPED HAUNTED GROUNDS RIGHT NEXT TO US IN THE HADDONFIELD HOUSE WITH THE GEN IN THE BASEMENT, PIGGY SHOWED UP AND SHOVED HER DRILL INTO MY ASSHOLE AND TRAP ME, JESUS DECIDED TO GET ME OFF THE HOOK WITH NO BT INFRONT OF THE PIG SO I GO RIGHT BACK UP CAUSE THE GLORIOUS FUCKER COULDN'T TAKE A HIT, SO I GO RIGHT BACK UP, JAZZY JEFF GETS ME BACK OFF AND MY TRAP STARTS CAUSE A GEN FINISHED, QUICK TIMER TOO, RAN MY ASS AROUND FOR 3 JIGSAW BOXES BEFORE FINALLY GOING TO THE LAST ONE. HAD TO RUN BY A NEA IN ORDER TO GET TO THE BOX ON THE TOP OF THE HOUSE. NEA BAILS KNOWING DAMN WELL I'M ON THE ROOF TRYING TO GET THE TRAP OFF, I GET IT OFF RIGHT AS IT'S ABOUT TO GO OFF, I'M THINKING FOR  MILLISECOND "OH BOY I CAN ACTUALLY PLAY NOW" BUT PIGGY CORKSCREWED MY ASS SHORTLY AFTER THAT SO I LASTED ABOUT 2-3 MINUTES IN THAT GAME.
---
A HUGE FUCK YOU TO THE NEA AND JEFF WHO DIDN'T HELP ME AT ALL.
---
ALSO TO THE TEAM OF MEGS WHO I WAS FOR SOME REASON PAIRED UP WITH EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THEM WERE RANK 16-19, THERE'S 5 GENS YOU FUCKING CUNTS WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THE HATCH.
---
I mean, yeah? Y'all got w/w over there for the men but god forbid m/m, fuck my drag, right?
---
This happened and still does sometimes happen to me. It‚Äôs 100% you and it‚Äôs your internet connection
---
billy doesn't need ruin but use it if you want id recommend you to swap it for pgtw
---
edit: just realized you are already running pgtw, maybe whispers?
---
And not even trying, I‚Äôm just here, crouching in the middle of the map, invisible to all
---
Good to know about the locker! And about the 4 seconds - I like the idea of running one way, BBQ wearing off, and then running the opposite way or whatever. The problem is that the killer sometimes happens to be 4 seconds or less away from me. I'm glad that I now know the lockers are a counter but until now I've been unable to do anything to stop from being murdered one by one until we lose as far as I could tell. I play in a group of 3 but we're all new.
---
Huh, weird. I just played with you.

HardMode: Look up the entire time.
---
Or she could just end up being worse. The only way we will find more about her character is when the devs add the archives.
---
I‚Äôm out of the loop,what‚Äôs archives?
---
The person making the killer chase them has no control over that though.  In fact, by making the killer chase them so long, aren't they doing exactly that?  Prolonging the game by making the killer take longer to get kills.
---
amen! on a slightly different topic, they should always allow new items to be purchaseable with shards, not only cells. instead they seem to have some way of deciding when some items can only be cells, and some shards too. the new trapper body is awesome, but no way i'm spending mula on it. i did pick up the new plague body since it was shards
---
Once you get better you don't really miss the skillchecks, at higher rank the survivor game becomes "can hump the gen while someone's looping a non-viable killer for an hour" or "can I sprint between these two jungle gyms and hope my teammates are humping gens"
---
Hence why gen protection perks have went from Ruin, to Ruin + something else for most killers.

Plague is lame and her outfit looked identical to her other outfits.
---
Matchmaking abuse is all too common in this game.  The devs were on shrooms the day they designed that feature. You won't have easier games until you reach purple (ranks 9-6).
---
That's literally what their doing by linking a separate Entity Damned subreddit you bellend
---
Think you misunderstood, which is fair enough.
---
Basically, Bill was just added to PS4, but we already had his perks available as if they were in the open bank of perks, not teachables. So my question was about whether we kept those still after prestiging.
---
fOr ThE tEaM
---
Im drunk it z my bday sotty
---
I'm a hardcore, p3 all perks trapper main. I thought this new outfit was a wraith one, but when I saw it was a Trapper one I nutted. Its definitely a top tier outfit, but it sucks not being able to play the game I just put money into. It's like a spit in the face, "thanks for the cash now go fuck yourself." Makes me legit want to not play the game.
---
I'm experiencing the same issue and yea it's pissing me off. All I want to do after a long day at work is get murdered online.
---
The game is trash because of a temporary server issue that rarely pops up? Talk about over reacting...
---
Oh,happy birthday to you than.
---
...
---
Yes everyone is fucked
---
The legion thing is cool but wouldn‚Äôt swf just destroy him?
---
Difference between love and lust. Plus pretty sure most of the survivors wouldn't want to fuck a killer who killed and tortured them repeatedly. Just saying XD
---
just stop working while it sparks after a miss and finish the gen faster than gen tapping.
---
Oh my fucking god you people need to sort by new instead of making ten threads about the same fucking thing.
---
Do it now, sort by new and see if that answers your question. Fucking christ
---
I didn‚Äôt check the timeline before posting. I guess that answers that lol.
---
rarely? This shit happens daily on PS4.
---
bruh I'm joking. unless if you are EA but EA = BAD. you = bad.
---
This^ x1000
---
Gideon Meat Plant has some of the best VPs, especially the dropdown above the bathroom gen. 
---
My rule of thumb is to get to the highest point, scout-stalk then close distance on whoever‚Äôs closest.
---
Yea just started for me
---
ohhhhhhh you act like assholes! Nice ma guy!
---
It's literally the same as everyone else. It feels long because he is attacking with, essentially, his hand. Just like Hag, who people also complain about. He doesnt have a weapon to give him that visual reach, so they move him further forward for his lunge to match the other Killers.
---
Agreed. Yes it's the same lunge as other killers but God damn it's decieving. His lunge either needs it's reduced or, more ideally, his model updated to more accurately depict his range
---
Why do delete your comments
---
It happened yesterday and today. The game has been out for two years.
---
I don't?
---
This would be a worthless perk on good survivors vs good killers since they'll know to leave you alone if they got an easier target...
---
u/yulse- , defend yourself!
---
My most upvoted comments are a spelling error and me playing it off with a meme
---
Shoo go away
---
Heck, even right in the open, a really good survivor can be difficult to hit. If they have windows or pallets nearby you can forget it.
---
Fortunatly for me at rank 5, there's usually at least one potatoe i can easily chainsaw
---
Yeah and similar to you, I take all memes I see 100% seriously! Nice ma guy!
---
Haha...ok..sure..
---
Freddy lunge is the same as all the killers. It looks like that because his model is smaller than the other killers.
---
I hear it there too but I think it‚Äôs still ash..?
---
becus it does not do what it is meant to do, counter slugging.
---
Enjoy the 60% lol &lt;3
---
Because PS4 is mega gay
---
It‚Äôs s joke you specials who downvoted
---
I have a love hate relationship with this community and the only reason I love it is because of these stupid memes
---
Shut up you muppet this doesn‚Äôt involve you
---
No you
---
Awesome
---
Yeah billy is still really good and doesn't need ruin vs trash survivors but good ones like zubat you definitely need it.
---
Just keep as much of it as you can over there alright?
---
Good luck slugging 4 players of the skill level of Zubat.
---
Meh, Myers at red ranks also gets looped. Every killer does expect for nurse and spirit. Bad argument when we compare fun factor imo
---
At first I was like "dang not bad"
---
Then the toxicity came
---
Hey, I‚Äôm a console player at rank 6. Not exactly in the breeding ground for players that are much better than potatoes.
---
People say it‚Äôs because of his character model, I‚Äôm not so sure about that because I hardly ever get hit by the same bullshit hits from legions, hag or ghost face which are similar size or even smaller. Freddy can literally wrap around pallet loops or connect with window vaults that visually look safe from any other killer at those distances
---
That's our size of our fucking hitbox.
---
HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE LAG SWITCH ON PC AND IS IT REALLY A REAL THING. BECAUSE I PLAYED A LEGION YESTERDAY WHO WAS MISSING HITS LEFT AND RIGHT, 3 GENS LATER ANYONE WITHIN 30 FEET OF HIM STARTED LAGGING LIKE A BALL SACK AND GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE UNTIL HE DOWNED AND HOOKED YOU. 
---
OUR DWIGHT WAS THE LAST ONE ALIVE, WAS OPENING THE EXIT GATE, 80% PERCENT DONE UNTIL LEGION APPEARS IN THE DISTANCE. SUDDENLY THE METER FOR THE GATE IS AT 100% BUT GETS STUCK AND DWIGHT STARTS LAGGING ALL OVER THE PLACE UNTIL HES DOWNED AND THE GATE NEVER OPENED. FUCK YOU LEGION, YOU SUCK AND DIDNT DESERVE EVEN ONE KILL AND GOT A 4K. PIECE OF SHIT.
---
I GUESS WHAT IM ASKING IS IS THIS A LAG SWITCH OR A HORRIBLE COINCIDENCE OF TERRIBLE LAG.
---
Yeah same. Especially the window hits are ridicolous
---
I have proposed before for Trapper to have his traps already be active when he starts the trial and give him the ability to reset traps on the ground instead of having to pick them up and reactivate them. You trade off the possibility of getting a lucky early grab vs the chance they will be in horrible places. I really like the Plague change.
---
Saw a guy with all achievements and only 42 hours a few days ago lol
---
Not really. It used to be good on Old Freddy due to his aura reading mechanic outside terror radius. On New Freddy it's not that good. The Lullaby is independent of terror radius meaning sleeping survivors will still hear you at 32 meters or whatever the default lullaby range is.
---
I love hope, but I would never run it with no mither
---
Part of the problem, as usual, be funny for once
---
She and Plague have the best stories.
---
You can't. Alone the 1000 sacrifices achievment makes it impossible to do in 3 days.
---
At the end of the match, when you look at the rank screen, there will be little circles above your rank. People call these ‚Äúpips‚Äù and when you fill all the circles in with pips, you‚Äôll be promoted to the next rank. The issue is it‚Äôs far too easy to pip. I‚Äôm rank 6 right now and I haven‚Äôt even played for two months, I don‚Äôt have access to a shitload of good perks that are character specific because of how long it takes to get blood points but I‚Äôm constantly ranking up because you don‚Äôt even have to play that well to get pips.
---
I wanna see game with red rank survivors with no mither and object, and like a rank 14 console nurse go up against each other
---
perfection
---
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT JUST WHEN HE USES HIS POWER, IT'S THE ENTIRE GAME THAT'S BAD. OR MAYBE IT'S JUST HIS EXISTENCE THAT MAKES MY PS4 CHOKE
---
This game specifically too. It‚Äôs an asymmetrical survival game, it‚Äôs not meant to be competitive as there are no distinct winners or losers due to the ranking system. If you have fun, then you win and that‚Äôs all that the player base should care about.
---
I was debating over having that with trapper but say someone spawns and steps in early on while you're far away. Sure they get hurt but at the same time you spread yourself kinda thin. Honestly it would be cool to test out things if they ever put out some kind of testing tool.
---
And thanku! I got her recently and I enjoy her but struggle with her a little too. She feels ok, middle of the road kinda.
---
I mean you wouldn't be laughing at that point? Man I was excited!
---
lol 4 teens killed one guy. Dahmer, Wournos, Helter Skelter and Bundy would like a word with the entity.
---
Imagine a Latina chick "Oi Cunt."
---
Thanks for the explanation. I'm in the same situation lol. I'm not that good at killer but I do well enough to keep ranking up, so now I'm going up against good survivors (when I really shouldn't be)
---
Such an underrated post lol
---
i see what you did there!!
---
When it happened the second time, I cried laughing.
---
I want to see this from the killers view with Nurse's calling. Lmao
---
that scream, it always gets me lmao.
---
You‚Äôre right! When I have fun, I win. I have no regard for rank. I play a character for who they are or design, not how ‚Äúviable‚Äù their power is. I think that‚Äôs nonsense. We should play the characters we grow fond of and find a way to do well as them!! That is how I enjoy the game.
---
I like to combine it with Pill Bottle since it will make you virtually undetectable from beyond 24 meters if survivors are awake. It‚Äôs not a bad perk on him, as it can help you sneak up on awake survivors. Only problem is that it‚Äôs useless to survivors in the dream world.
---
Yeah, I think that's the consensus.
---
However, I do think it has value for low-rank players to gain BP quickly and potential high-rank use with the scratch mark disappearance for the rest of the team.
---
Plus, skilled Survivors/Killers don't make the perfect play *always*.
---
By the time you put them to sleep you are already in a chase though
---
It happened last week too and kept up for three days, if we're gonna be fair.
---
When I see someone cleansing my hex totem so I use all my snares around their hook. No one will ever know where it is.
---
A Barbie in a hoodie made from a napkin?
---
Just sabotage it.
---
-this post was made by the Jake Gang
---
Trappy boy needs some love. He's the first killer but hasnt evolved with the game much. Maybe his iridescent add on stone should cover what you're suggesting. Instead of randomly opening they all start open. And maybe re open after some time?
---
they need to seriously fix the totems, i played one game the other day as survivor and the ruin was in the middle of 2 boxes and a car and we couldn‚Äôt clean it. spent the whole game trying to do gens and then ultimately dying. totally fair totem placements!!!!
---
He‚Äôs 14 feet there‚Äôs no escaping him.
---
Not at all. I‚Äôm here to play a game. I‚Äôm not going to wait around in lobbies as killer when I could be playing other games. This game is very one sided; either the killers destroy survivors or the survivors destroy the killer. There are very few matches that are really decently played on both sides. Plus, I can never run for fun gimmicks without my teammates getting mad at me. It‚Äôs more fun in low ranks were matches are more unpredictable.
---
I love this. I'd love to see more pictures if there's more.
---
How do you define good game design? It gives survivors an alternate objective that slows down the pace the ridiculously fast generators go by. They also made dull totems give way more bp and objective points so why are you complaining?
---
The only reason Quinton is just as strong as other characters is because he is really tired.
---
Yeah she literally took the S tier all for herself, followed by the spirit, hillbilly and huntress in tier A
---
If the game had no bugs, then what would they work on? Maybe they intentionally break the game so they have something to do. In this essay, I will......
---
Who hurt you?
---
This is very true and what I really mean. You're not consistently downing a zubat/noob type survivor with anyone other than spirit and nurse
---
cool
---
Everyone....
---
Contribute to the post or gtfo
---
No
---
That‚Äôs another weird issue I have. Green ranks I destroy when I play killer, but purple ranks I go against have every perk in the game and I still don‚Äôt know what all of them do.
---
WHY CANT I PICK WHICH KILLER I WANT TO PLAY, THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES.
---
Sure.
---
Dont repost. 
---
Billy doesnt need ruin. 
---
Stop deleting comments.
---
‚ÄúIt is a trap. But a trap one must step in..."
---
See...
---
You're completely right how I can I not see their master plan. It's not like they can work on improving the game mechanics.
---
this isn't a repost I had to reupload it because it was 4 am and no one saw it
---
I never said it was trash. And you cant compare it cross platform like that, if the game works flawlessly on PC but has 10 frames (as an example), on ps4 or whatever then the game is bad on ps4. Doesnt matter how good it is on PC.
---
I don't get the big deal. Yes, it looks weird but it still functions the same as any other killer. If a Freddy hits you with his lunge then any other killer would have as well.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs when the servers decide to work...
---
Uh, yeah that‚Äôs what i mean. 1 is technically lower than 20, but granted the circumstances, you should still refer to 1 as higher than 20.
---
That means they all closed their apps. If they dc through the game you keep your items and points.
---
I think just her range and extra blinks add-ons should be nerfed. Base kit Nurse isn't broken and can be played around.
---
Friend: ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs ruin?‚Äù

Hooked guy hasn't used his DS yet. Is within 60 seconds crawling distance of gate.
---
Tell me the counter pls. Cuz it seems as though its just a free escape to me.
---
Yes its an anti tunneling perk during the rest of the game however its also got a use where it GUARANTEES survival in the end game. As it allows a completely consequence free unsafe unhook.
---
I'd say play who you want.  He's really fun cause he's different.  In my opinion he is trash but fun I can get 4K's but he's not as meta.  
---
I just kinda take being called toxic or whatever like I hate playing Billy cause it just feels like I'm playing fucking Mario Kart.  
---
I don't think killers can be toxic just playstyles.  Like facecamping or letting the last person crawl around till they die

I REALLY HAVE GOTTEN INTO PLAYING TAPP AND HONESTLY MAPS LIKE ASYLUM AND THE GAME ARE GETTING LESS ANNOYING BECAUSE CONSTANTLY HAVING STAKE OUT MAXED IS AMAZING FOR SPEEDING THROUGH GENS. HOWEVER I DONT WANT FREDDY‚ÄôS WRINKLY NUTS ON MY SHOULDER.

No idea if it'll be a grind but usually games arent that bad in the beginning when there is no meta formed yet. Although the downside is bugs

Ok sure, doesn't change anything at all though. They recover after a few seconds.

Guess they had to cancel their doctors appointment.

I dont understand why you act this way
---
Play legion and just deep wound them all game,
---
What puzzles me the most is simply how active the subreddit actually is. I choose to believe some people redirect their salt to that subreddit or something lol
---
I would argue that it has a little less synergy then what most killers have for this perk. 
---
Since Freddy can teleport to gens, using the perk to sneak up closer to survivors working on a gen is not as important. This makes M &amp; A alittle weaker. 
---
It can have good synergy with Pill bottle since pill bottle makes Freddy visible only when he is within 24 meters making the perk somewhat useful. 
---
Lullaby seems to be independent of T.R effects making the perk useless when survivors are asleep.
---
Simple solution is have half a mind not to hook near exit gates if there‚Äôs 1 generator left or the exit gates are powered lol. That‚Äôs like common knowledge even against players that aren‚Äôt running DS.
---
This is so cute. I was laughing the whole time.

I‚Äôm kind of disappointed there aren‚Äôt more jokes like this on this sub

If i see a post on the sub and I want to comment on, im gonna comment on it. You should focus on getting better at the game so you wont think ruin is some be all, end all.

Unfortunately not really. it seems like BEhaviour has gathered information on that and is currently trying to fix it but as far as I know there's no solution for that other than being patient and hope for the better
---
I mean there are perks on both sides that each side doesn't like some of the combos of killer perks can be just as nasty as some of the surv ones. I think DS is absolutely fine where it is, nerfing it any further would being us to another MoM issue where the perk has as much use as Left Behind. The issue with BT aswell is think of it as would you rather have the one time use original? Or the new reusable one meant to stop killer tunnel, honestly idk i like BT so that it stops camping and makes a tunneled player get tunneled longer.
---
I just wish they would increase the time to complete a generator. Without Ruin, at least 2 pop each chase and it's kind of unfair
---
When will the website be up again?
---
how did I not see wraith in the background before lol
---
No i mean, he face camped for picking claudette, not for in game behavior.
---
Yes, her add-ons are getting a rework.
---
Thats...  not a power. He just "runs" whenever he enters a chase with you. It has nothing to do with stalking or marking survivors.
---
You deff watched donkeys video
---
Nah, it disturbed the hell out of me on top of disgusting me. I can't handle children abuse like that.
---
Sprint burst in mid chases are a pain in the ass
---
Obviously, I was stating everything my version would do
---
Thrilling tremors any gen that isn't white that's were a surv Is
---
It's thicc not thick, get it right next time nub
---
Thanks for the opportunity, these are awesome :)
---
MegMainSmollBrain
---
&gt;in fact he never gets chainsawed by billy
---
Not factual. And if you use Zubat for an argument, you will have to concede that most survivors are not good enough, given that he chainsaws people all the time, even without add-ons, winning the vast majority of his Billy games with ease (and without Ruin).
---
Either way, use Carburettor + Doom Engravings and be good at Billy, and you can make a lot of in-chase/on-loop saws work, even on competent survivors.
---
Am I a bad person if I prefer stranger things Nancy over nightmate on elm street nancy
---
lol, good assumption buddy, funny how just because we make killers dc from a 3 man swf means were flashlight spammers. killers dc too easily now if they don‚Äôt get 1 kill.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Fortnite bad, and you have (and I mean *by law* have to) mention how good the Witcher 3 is.
---
I mean, you said "safe unhooks or...."
---
Which wouldn't be a change now would it :P Maybe i'm being too literal...
---
Honestly i think the perk is fine they way it works now, one can't farm people for it, not at least without BT and unhooks are core gameplay.
---
I think that the killer should know who is in a swf and who isn‚Äôt so they know who‚Äôll be communicating
---
I don't wanna be that guy, but rank 1-5 and ranks 6-20 are completely different games. In green/purple ranks you can get away with playing stuff like leatherface. You can't really do that in reds.
---
Safe unhook or means either are an option
---
this is why game chat will be added, so they don‚Äôt have to make horrible changes like that, you can‚Äôt punish people for playing with friends, they care more about keeping their game alive.
---
What if its a good hillbilly?
---
Ah
---
could be, but some of them didn‚Äôt looking like they were closing app, idk.
---
&gt; Low rank killers don't switch targets and are more prone to tunneling.
---
Overlooked, for sure.
---
&gt;we got enough perks which hide scratch marks
---
Super valid.
---
&gt;You won't get stacks now if you farm people off hooks
---
Couldn't disagree more. I can register a "Safe Unhook" and that rescued Survivor could end up right back on the ground, on that same hook (or one nearby), and potentially dead if the Killer is nearby or decides to tunnel.
---
**Overall:** WGLF is probably fine as is, yeah. This was just a concept; I'm not campaigning lol. However, WGLF still has major sandbag potential and that does concern me as Survivor.
---
Nice repost there bud.
---
Now this is epic
---
nah it was at the very end of the match every time, when the killer realized they weren‚Äôt getting any kills, idk why y‚Äôall assume we‚Äôre being toxic just because killers dc on us... ik i don‚Äôt have any way to prove it but it happens so much to us at the end of the game.
---
I was going to do that. But I cant buy legion yet
---
Trans flag colors
---
I kinda figured that tbh
---
Thank you!!!!
---
I feel like the words tunnel, camp and also "toxic" gameplay/survivor/killer are sooo overused.
---
whats even funnier is that that girl literally ends up getting hooked in the movie
---
I dont think it should come back but i think using vigil should let you recover exhaustion mid chase
---
Oh, those disgusting DBD fanfictions. I mean, there's so many of them though. Which ones? Which ones did you read?
---
Why tho, i havent played dbd mobile in a few days so I'm not sure if there has been an updaye that caused more problems
---
I GOT FACE CAMPED AND TUNNELED EVERY TIME I SEE A GHOSTFACE
---
There‚Äôs Friday 13th video game but the killer is quite OP, and haven‚Äôt played that game in a while. Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any perks in it afaik
---
Bloodpoints are bloodpoints. Good luck everybody else :D
---
To come back and add to this month-long discussion, I have experimented with different add-on combinations and have started playing more vanilla games and honestly I've been having a lot of fun memeing as space Billy on Autohaven maps (I managed to jump out of the map in one game) and I've been consistently getting more and more kills without add-ons
---
only BHVR knows
---
He didn't....stop inserting context that isn't there.  I don't know why this sub always has to have responses when it comes to bitches that DC saying "oh yeah well the other side does it too!"  This is one if the few topics where each side should universally condemn the practice or ragequitting like a toddler but instead we get defensive here instead.  Just odd to me.  Odd and extremely commonplace.
---
Even a good hillbilly.
---
You should follow leaksbydaylight it shows the release order .
---
Sort of - the Entity (spider thing that stabs you on the hook) brings both killers and Survivors into its realm, where it feeds on the survivor's hope that they will eventually escape. More lore is probably coming with the archive update.
---
As for other lore there's a guy called benedict running around and writing journals, and other named Survivors like Vigo that we never get to see directly.
---
i agree personally, but still wanted to pose the question to see what other ppl in the community thought about it.
---
"I see you too are a man of culture" :^)
---
It starts.
---
claudette running away to the exit: Th-tha-THATs all folks!
---
he's a precious baby boi
---
I wasn't putting in context that isn't there basically what I'm saying is why isnt he complaining about survivors and killers that can't take a loss instead he is trying to call out only killers which is weird to me this community is a odd place agree
---
Lmao that's hilarious dude
---
I hate this guy
---
I JUST GOT THIS GAME AND WHY ARE PEOPLE BEING SO EASY TO CHASE AS HAG ARE TRAPS GOOD OR AM I GOING AGAINST IDIOTS
---
Desync between where the survivor is, and where the host thinks the survivor is. When you interact with someone, you'll move to their expected position and then begin the action.
---
When the killer approached, the host checked in on the location and realized that wasn't the right place.
---
Yeah, it was fine as solo player but my friend and I couldn't get into a lobby together, we both tried multiple times over an hour. PS4 Europe that is. Kept saying failure.
---
Because the basis of his story is his experience playing survivor in a swf so naturally from his specific point of view it would be framed as the killer dc'ing.  There isn't a need to include both sides because that wasn't part of his anecdote.  Yes naturally survivors doing it too would be just as bitch of a move and wrong.
---
thank you for your well thought out post. I personally agree, but i go out of my way to not tunnel the person who got unhooked, and have to often ran into the person intentionally going down to DS me, maybe a handful at most. I do know that those people do exist however and wanted to hear things from both sides.  Your English was Great By the way you did a good job so no worries there. Thank you again for commenting.
---
Hex: everybody horny
---
At that point you lost 2 times, you don't deserve an easy third chance.
---
it‚Äôs deep fried from being reposted lol
---
I FEEL YA
---
GROOVY BABY
---
Right which is what brought me to the question, when I was reading the offering from Virgo I'm like who the hell is that
---
She's just trying to show you a sick cartwheel
---
Dude want an Harvard license?
---
Now that survivors have arranged for Legion to be completely useless, Doctor and Nurse are their next top complaints. I pretty much never get DCs anymore unless I'm playing those two.
---
Yeah happen to me today where I was only hooked once and I had the full time then full struggle time and didn‚Äôt get unhooked, bad thing is it was me that was baited out by the other survivor
---
Isn‚Äôt noed just the n word because It offends the people in the healthy state
---
Each to their own I guess. As long as people are having fun I guess it's fine. However this community has some serious salt problems. ESPECIALLY in purple ranks. And it really doesn't matter if you're survivor or killer. Playing optimally as either generates salt for the others and it's so unfortunate that people get mad and come up with excuses and unwritten rules rather than just admit they got outplayed by a completely legal, valid and legit mechanic
---
i hear you in those situations, but how would you adjust it without breaking the main anti tunnel mechanic?
---
Ever been to a grocery store and Linda has to call her manager Sherman to a register to ring because it's busy? That.
---
Corrupt Intervention - they just rush other 4 gens
---
Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, Discordance - Don't slow the game down at all, those are information perks.
---
Pop - It's good, the problem is that most likely the first time you'll be able to use it, there will be only 2 gens left
---
So? Just a Spirit. Be glad it ain't a Doctor. Dr. Worldwide (Maximum TR build) + 3-genning + this map = a bad time.
---
Try hitting those skill checks üòÇ
---
Forsters home for the entitys playthings

It‚Äôs lit up.

*Obligatory r/dbdgonewild comment*
---
Why did you have to hit me in my childhood?
---
Why'd you edit the comment?
---
Sounds odd to me but I guess he is the most brutal of them all like most fucked up messy one
---
Dwight and David are already doing that OwO
---
I have no clue what u mean?
---
Hostel is one of my favorite gore movies, the second one is easily the best imo
---
Don't forget Wraith, he murdered a bunch of people without knowing.
---
Why the fuck are you going off so hard over fucking porn?
---
Damn, Trap Daddy, you are snappier than those traps.
---
Please not the BASEMENT mr LEATHERS
---
players who gen tap never get better at the game because they dont force improvement
---
no
---
I don't think so. Zubat consistently runs Billy's around. He has nothing to help him in a chase near loops.
---
Because it‚Äôs the one thing that keeps me happy
---
And soon we'll have troll killers hold games hostage to get survivors to DC and force the bans. Hostage taking being against the rules and all but much harder to confirm than the good old cord icon.
---
If you want a tip... Just slug them. It gives you a lot of pressure, and you don't lose time being ds'd, so it's worth it. I think slugging is underrated, because most people have no idea how helpful it is.
---
He's not even that threatening... ohh you'll bleed out if you don't heal.  Yeah he slows the game down but he's so nerfed it's insane and most of his addons are fucking useless
---
Then just scroll past the gay, my dude. Gay people have been scrolling past straight shit for ages and not whined a bit.
---
I agree with the sentiment but survivor in lower ranks is soooooo bad. People don‚Äôt even unhook you and afk in lockers all the time and have no idea how to play survivor properly.
---
With so many memes about it I think I'll buy leatherface and grind for insidious just to try a basement game.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main that plays killer maybe one day a week and I still play as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù killers that I hate going up against, but I let the last survivor live every time. It‚Äôs a way to have fun if you‚Äôre not a killer main and still feel some love for survivors.
---
WHILE I COULD DEFINITELY SEE STAKE OUT BEING BENEFICIAL FOR THESE MAPS, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO USE A PERK SLOT FOR IT.  
---
PERSONALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO ONLY BE CONSIDERED IN THE TERROR RADIUS IF I'M ON THE SAME FLOOR AS THE KILLER.  OH WELL.
---
just think of the survivors comming over to play with all of those very-friendly killers the entity has in its spooky old house! C: Its basically the game but with multiple killers!
---
r/softwaregore
---
I'M ACTIVELY GETTING WORSE. I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT BUILDS, BUT NO, EVEN AT MY SWEATIEST I'M ALWAYS THE FIRST DOWN, THEN FARMED.
---
I DON'T CARE ABOUT RANKS HONESTLY BUT I'VE GONE DOWN 4 FROM BEING GARBAGE THESE LAST 20 GAMES. I'M AT MY WITS END! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY JUKE! I'VE LOOKED AT TUTORIALS FOR HOW TO PULL IT OFF ON PS4, AND I KEEP TASTING BITTER DEFEAT!
---
Lmao take your updoot
---
It doesn‚Äôt counter NOED.  Unless they refer to ‚Äúcountering‚Äù as the killer essentially having NOED all game. Only thing it counters is slugging and it also allows you to fly through gens with the right build. It sucks though because you can‚Äôt get risky saves or saves in the end game or body block for your team.
---
It penetrates their flesh OwO
---
Chests too
---
I like both of these ideas but I lean towards this idea more because it rewards the player for continuous altruism rather than a one time thing, making those who have a higher aura reading, more deserving of it. It works well both ways I just like the idea of continously earning your way out.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. Frustrates me whenever I watch someone break a totem just before the last gen pops. Unless you‚Äôve already gotten the other 4, all you‚Äôve done is eliminate the chance of noed spawning right next to you
---
Spaghett!!!
---
The ghost face in the game is sadly not the one from the movies
---
No Mither isn't that bad of a perk. Granted it initally seems useless but there are some extremely niche uses for it.
---
A: By being injured and thus one-shot the entire match, you have access to Dead Hard from the get-go, meaning you can still dead hard through something like an EW3 Myers swing, a chainsaw, etc.
---
B: You also start injured without *some* of the disadvantages leaving yourself in the injured state usually gives you. You don't bleed. Your groaning is quieter. You can run something like No Mither with Resilience and This Is Not Happening for easier great skillchecks and faster actions. I don't know if Resilience still affects vaulting speed. (Wiki claims it and spine chill still do, but I remember hearing a few guys on the subreddit recently complaining spine chill no longer affects vaults, so what's going on?)
---
C: You still are quieter when downed unlike Iron Will. With no blood trail if the killer ever decides to slug you, you can crawl away and get yourself back up.
---
D: It sort of saves time. Since you can't be healed to healthy you don't have to worry about taking time being healed or healing yourself after being unhooked, etc.
---
So I don't think No Mither is complete garbage like Vigil and Monstrous Shrine are. There's technically some niche builds you can do with No Mither. If you're going to do an "Injured Build" no mither would be a great choice instead of having to let the killer hit/down/hook you first + be louder and bleeding.
---
Noed is in a crap spot, because survivors see it as op, and killers see it as fine. No matter what you do youre going to piss a lot of people off by changing it or not
---
Adrenaline is really strong against weak killers, not so much against strong ones
---
A team of survivors at full strength can beat most killers at full strength, yes.
---
Instaheals are really strong, maybe too strong.
---
If they increased both speed and decreased medkit charges at a rate of 100% theyd be more balanced
---
If survivors recieved an equivalent nerf to instaheals id been fine with ebonys being removed in favor of more ivory moris. Maybe make it so the killer has to get everyone on death hook first so its more about being able to mori everyone rather than end games faster, because im pretty sure everyone wants slower games. 
---
How dare you insult ghostface smh. Hes similar, but i like his stealthier style that he can keep up throughout the game rather just than at the start.
---
At some ranks, yeah. You still see some variety at rank 7-15
---
Agreed, especially with lower tier killers. Even higher tier ones
---
Not that many mistakes, but im only rank 8 so maybe its worse at rank 1
---
True i guess
---
DS is most annoying at the end when you cant wait out the timer because they will crawl out the gate. Guaranteed escape at that point
---
https://i.redd.it/rsfj5lry1ql21.png
---
Hahaha that's a great analogy
---
Here's the basis of their music, Susie (the best) is power metal anything you can really headbang to, Frank likes screamo and death metal, Joe is about chill beats possibly some classic rap or maybe something like beastie boys. Julie is about the depressing music, the "emo" music for lack of better term. Probably something like Nirvana
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call them hooligans it‚Äôs still undermining them someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to kill someone is not someone you want to mess with the fact he had no hesitation killing you should make you scared they would beat you in a fight in fact frank would beat you in a fight cause it‚Äôs not gonna be a fight it‚Äôs going to be a murder
---
Well both sides cant take a loss and i should know as rank 1 survivor and rank 6 Killer
---
Not really.
---
The DS skillcheck is so big now. Unnerving isn't that impactful anymore, unfortunately.
---
Don't get mad at my baby Susie! She's scared so it's her self defense from the bullies that are SWF
---
Lmao
---
I started working on this when Ghost Face's power was announced as another killer following the trend of stalk but with a different reward for stalking. While Myers starts stealthy before ramping up through stalk, The Rain starts obvious before becoming stealthier and stealthier until he's almost impossible to see coming, the calm before a raging storm. I also like the idea of a killer who's stealthy because of an environmental effect rather than becoming invisible or just having no terror radius, rain and lightning obscuring him.
---
Also, I completely agree that his power wouldn't fit the game... because it would probably crash everyone's match (lol), but I make these concepts as fun projects rather than serious suggestions. Thank you for your feedback, though!
---
I thought climbing up to rank 1 would stop this,
---
But I was so Fucking wrong.
---
1 game I was saved before I was sacrificed, so I ran around looking to see if there was any progress on any gens. No, there was not. 0.
---
Killer it is then. Survivor is not working out.
---
I only give a warning for the future
---
The one joke
---
There is counterplay to ds . dont tunnel
---
I know rank 1 doesn't mean alot to most of you but feels good finally getting there after playing for abit over a month
---
It's supposed to be them controlling their anger, coming back from their feral rampage I think. But it just sounds like they got hit in the chest or something
---
This would look stupid. A predator barely able to catch up to a human and getting outfoxed by people dropping pallets and shining a light on him...  0/10
---
FUCK RUIN IT ALWAYS GETS FUCKING FOUND  30 SECONDS INTO THE GAME AND I FUCKIGN HATE HOW BULLSHIT IT IS OH MY GOD  CANT IT JUST STAY UP ALL GAME FOR ONCE OR WHAT? FUUUCK
---
Damn than huntress is gonna have a large bulge sometime soon
---
MAYBE I LIKE SENDING SALTY MESSAGES IN POST GAME CHAT?
---
I think there‚Äôs a couple things that could be done. It‚Äôs a very strong perk, it can stack with BT, a killer potentially has to deal with this 4 times in a trial. It‚Äôs a nightmare perk for tunnelers, as it was intended. I‚Äôm good with this part of it.
---
That being said, my main problem with it is when it is carrying extremely bad plays. I think it should deactivate once you are healed. Or deactivate if you move out of a certain proximity of your last hook. If it‚Äôs an antitunneler perk like everyone says it is, then should a survivor be able to run clear across the map, bait a killer and still use it? I don‚Äôt think a killer should be punished because of bad plays on the survivors part. In return, if you are chased within a certain proximity (tunneled), the timer for DS stalls for a bit so you don‚Äôt lose your DS. So essentially it‚Äôs gaining more anti tunnel value but losing that kind of derpy aspect of it.
---
David, you'll be the first...
---
People can make counterarguments for every killer, but that poor dude didnt deserve it
---
THEY NERFED CLAUDETTE NOW SHE HAS TO GO FROM BEING BLACK TO BEING YELLOW TO MATCH THE CORN
---
Yeah, dbd is not an horror game so it wouldn't fit. But I have to say the lore is fantastic.
---
The image on the left should be anywhere on the map
---
I thought it was 150K, no?
---
I THINK THEY MADE IT AS A KILLER BUFF THATS WHY THEY DON'T FIX IT
---
I would like to bit it's hard if you don't have a pc and ps4 can't run more than 12 fucking frames
---
This is why ranks and a leaderboard have no place in a game like dbd and hitman
---
To be honest, sounds like you could just play the game differently. Why look for ruin in the first place? Sure it's a hit annoying, but it'll only slow you down a tiny bit. Look for it between gens. Sometimes you get lucky. You sick of teammates going down all the time? Great! Lots of juicy altruism points for us! And you say a killer is predictable? Then it sounds like you should try hard countering them more often ;)
---
Cool! I‚Äôll check them out!! I‚Äôm all for promoting positivity within the community :)
---
Shes so overrated oh my god, Julie is much better, and Joey.
---
I wouldn't recommend nurses for legion, detection isn't a weak point they need covered in. I run bamboozle to help me vault faster even in FF, BBQ is fine to keep pressure obviously, bloodhound is the same thing also with detection, if you use headphones you don't really need it although the glowing blood definitely doesn't hurt lol.
---
By that logic, Nurse is shit because I've seen a few [insert your favorite streamer here] dodge and survive against a Nurse? Does that mean Nurse is a shit killer? Absoluty not, but to to say Billy is shit is because he can be looped and whiff a chainsaw are ignoring very key plays to Billy's kit. Watch Ryanpez or OhTofu play Billy and you'll see why Billy is not weak against swf.
---
So terrordome?
---
If this post was from the killers pov about how some survivors were salty after losing it would be on the front page with 1000+ upvotes
---
Personally when i'm having a bad day i usually run self care + botany, really helps when you cant rely on teammates.
---
SOMETIMES I BRING MORIS AND FORGET I EVER BROUGHT ONE
---
Would've helped more I guess lol.
---
Man there needs to more iCarly memes
---
The show is *highly* memeable so I agree
---
I mean, it wouldn't let me. So
---
*AHEM AHEM* SMALL GAME
---
Cheers mate :)
---
Anyone playing a 4 vs 1 online game that constantly has new abilities, characters and balance changes added frequently and expects no bugs or imbalance is delusional.
---
It's pretty much impossible to make the game bug free and 100% balanced.
---
Be happy they do as well as they do, do.
---
You could have GUN Media and Illfonic in charge of bugs and balance :P
---
Hmmmm do ya not know how bloodweb works? Not being toxic just curious
---
I had a game where I kept disarming the trapper‚Äôs trap by the ruin, and he kept coming back to it. I did for the whole game until the final generator was done. He DC‚Äôed.
---
This. You're posting the wrong picture. Post a picture of the emblem screen.
---
Would it be so bad if Doctor didn‚Äôt have a treatment/punishment mode? I always thought this was a stupid part of his mechanic. Just have right mouse shock instead of switching modes. Hell still be way worse than the meta killers.
---
And Trapper should default start off with 2-3 traps. Slightly darker traps. And slightly larger area so the trap will go off more consistently.
---
If I went for a perk first, yeah. I just got excited and went after the BPS first. Ah well.
---
Nah, Billy is easily looped. His chainsaw only helps to move through the map
---
You won‚Äôt get them back unless you unlock them on bill
---
It isn‚Äôt just for my purpose, getting away from a ranked game could stop the killer and survivors from feeling like they need to play certain perks. I played about 10 games tonight and all but 1 had ruin. I don‚Äôt really have a problem with the perk itself, I‚Äôm having a problem with this consistency of matches and i think socials are a good way to get away from it because no one wants to ruin their rank so they‚Äôll never move away from the perks that help them win. 
---
Just a passing thought
---
lol I‚Äôm new to the game, how does it counter no Ed if no Ed one shots you anyway?
---
I have 700 hours in the game. I got fucked by this bloodweb, I'm not crying over it. No big deal. Just thought it was funny.
---
I went after BPS first, that's what boned me. If I had gone for a perk first, then the BPS, I'd be fine. Again, no big deal.
---
Remember when he had that magazine titled ‚ÄúTRAPS‚Äù
