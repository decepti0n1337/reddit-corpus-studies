Takes 7 seconds for him to be a normal killer. Ranks 10-20 he's great. Ranks 1-10 He's trash. His power doesn't help at all in a chase. You won't lose survivors easily? Cool. Can you beat pallets? Windows? Mind games? Range? No. No you can.g
---
---
---
That's an awesome cosplay but seeing as you now have that mask in person, how the hell does one see out of it?!
---
Bing bong
---
I've learned to only do it to people I really enjoyed playing against. It can be the difference between them getting angry (few too many bad matches in a row and it happens to all of us) and them enjoying themselves and trying another round. You always feel pretty happy when the killer does that
---
Right? I don't think that ever hasn't thrown me from a Chase. 
---
I recomend chosing something else than unbreakable. I did that at first too, but if you manage to get up with the unbreakable boost, you were probably also gonna get up with the regular No Mither. I think you'd get more use out of another perk. Still, you do you, try unbreakable all you like, it's far from useless on the build, but I'd prefer having something else in my kit than going all out on the tought that I'll be able to get up from the downed state myself.
---

---
I love using No Mither, I often feel more confident when using it. Hex totem that might be haunted grounds? Not like it will affect you. Michael stalking you? What's he going to do? You already go down in one hit, it's not like he'll suddenly be able to instantly ki- never mind that. Leatherface? Don't make me laugh, his power is useless on you. NOED? The hell is that? Why are all my teammates fleeing tho? *goes to hook, distracts killer and escapes unharmed while team resques hooked survivor*
---
He's great for discussing history and numbers, and what those numbers mean. But for balance mmm. I hate to say it but Tyde is not as good as he thinks he is (just like me haha). But killers like Tyde and I are a perfect example of one of the worst problems with this game: the rank system. I shouldn't be high rank lol, I'm not good. And yet, basically because I have enough hours in the game, I can climb without trying really
---
This’ll be easy
---
It probably should be given conditions, like getting a certain amount of hooks

Yes. All other killers have good characters and backstories. The clown has absolutely nothing to offer in either of those aspects. 
---
Even then I feel it's a bit much, but I understand your reasoning
---
Reduced stun time, and only triggers if you’re downed within 60 seconds of being unhooked. Instead of being a crutch second chance perk, they’re making it an anti-tunneling perk
---
Moreover you don’t start off as the obsession - if you hit your DS you become the obsession (So it changes mid match)
---
All other killers are decent in some way. He is not. 
---
&gt; the community doesn't want you in dead by daylight, please leave the game so that you don't create more people like you
---
I don't care about what the community thinks about me, I have fun playing DBD in my own ways. I paid for the game, not "the community". 
---
These are not the minority of the games, more like every game. When I tried to play differently and work as a team, it would happen again and I would have only myself to blame for being dumb. People in solo queue don't care about you and you shouldn't care about them. If people are playing SWF with 3 players, they don't care about the random. 
---
THEN I'LL DIE DOING WHAT I LOVE.
---
Wait, so no more DS after I down someone and start carrying them to the hook? 
---
Why is pig and hag A tier? Why is wraith B tier? What the fuck is Hunteress doing down there? Which genius put doctor all the way down there.
---
I just like saving time as much as possible. It also effectively gives me more self-revivals, should I need them, but I'm more into the whole saving 6-7 seconds.
---
Someone’s toxic
---
Because cleansing totems is hard. 
---
MVP to the 1%ers who do this
---
[sneaks into locker]
---
The main Problem i have with him(talking about a lerfect played freddy vs a perfect played swf) is 
---
a) the rng (sc after the pallets and hope for a sc to waste more time)
---
B)That his power doesn't really help him while in a chase, that puts him in such a loopable position and you have to rely on mindgames*not viable against toptier loopers imo*, which can be won but if fucked up the survivor can stun you and still get a sc to waste more time. Also it puts him in a disadvantage in key situations:instahooksaves, hatch, exit gates, adrenaline plays, instaheal plays.
---
Tldr: He is good against unexperienced people but will loose against a r1 swf most lf the time because it is really easy to waste the killers time.
---
Lmao, right next to a hook too! Been there, feels bad 😫
---
Nope. I know, I know. Save your tears of joy. You’ll need a full bucket to collect all the salty survivor tears. In all seriousness I really like the change
---
Nurse: Yeah... nerf legion am i rite guys?
---
Let's not pretend that a good portion of these "kids" aren't grown-ass men.
---
Or you get a Dwight that refuses to heal you because even though you had a trap on your head you didn’t save him until stage 2
---
I am so happy, this is beautiful. 
---
He's like freddy. Great against surviviors who can't loop or play properly. Rank 1-10 "gg ez baby killer git gud lmao"
---
lmao
---
I've only encountered Blood Warden once, and I hope I never encounter it again lol. I was literally at the exit game screaming WHAT?? OH MY GOD, NO!! and tried to bail to the inside of the map. But Spirit wasnt having that, hahah. The whole squad died when just moments before we were all about to live.
---
It is. Now early game momentum means something, and loops won’t last twice as long
---
Have you been living under a rock for the past month? 😂
---
I’m down when I get home from work. bloodyblackout18 
---
Yep :)
---
You obviously either dodge SWF teams or don't play at rank 1 killer often. Going against a team with 4 DS is pretty common. Adding an extra 20 seconds to a chase because you can hit a skill check is insane and was a total get out of jail free card being able to use it before you had even been hooked once. 
---
The Entity has decided you, and you in particular, will die this trial. If you have any questions regarding this decision please contact our Human Resources manager, Leatherface
---
Want shirtless Jane
---
Dude why is there a massive gap between Freddy and Wraith? 
---
You lying fuck.
---
YEAAAHHH BOOOIIIII
---
I believe the devs have said they wanted to make dying light less tunnel-y anyway 
---
Yeah. And i bet he kicks stray dogs when he sees one.
---
Seriously, dude. It's a game, it's a war between survivors and killers.
---
Hag is as strong with addons as without addons. She is stronger than huntress imo
---
My point is that survivors should be trying to do totems anyway. If solo survivors don't do totems, that's on them, not NOED. And where did I say you should "only play SWF" or do all the totems yourself in solo queue? Oh, that's right. I didn't. 
---
&gt;Hillbilly above Nurse
---
&gt;Plague that damn high
---
&gt;Pig above Michael
---
I find the best players reside somewhere between 6-13. My experiences have led me to believe that most players at rank 1 are there due to simply running the best builds/addons and moris on top tier killers or running 4 man SWF’s. I don’t consider this type of play to be particularly skillful and I tend to have more of a challenge at the mid ranks when not considering moris and such.
---
Me too 🖤 it's why I use it so much, I might change it up one day though 🤔 but the mask makes it super easy so I don't have to add mouth movements 😂😂
---
Yes, and that is a 100% step in the right direction to balancing the game in my opinion. To not make one side stronger and the other weaker, but to add both weaknesses and strengths to both.
---
Bringing back the DeRanking meme again?
---
With the auric cells you can buy some cosmetics. Probably only one part, but I’m not sure how much they cost
---
throw 'em good
---
Imo, I just buy the dlc with money.  It generally takes a fair bit to get shards for em, let alone wanting to get BOTH Killer and Survivor.  The shards are better spent on the shrine for Perks to unlock to save time on the grind,esp for the level 40 teachables.  it's even good to use shards on Perks you already unlocked to get a bunch of Bloodpoints,,which speeds up the grind imo. ,or you can bank shards for cosmetics.
---
True do you know if I can get anything with the 100 cells?
---
I dunno
---
Ayyy now just got accused of hacking because I used whispers on a claudette that was crouched in the corner... Epic
---
Happy cake day
---
Just played a game where a survivor DC'ed *after* the last gen was completed, and we were opening the gates. Was a Freddy killer with Remember Me, so instead of the doors being opened by the time that guy was even hooked, Freddy instantly went right to us and managed to win the game in the end. Thanks, random douche! 
---
broken hits will be fixed with dedicated servers.
---
If the point of the build is to be the "sweatiest" "tryhard" build, wouldn't it be Ruin/BBQ M&amp;A/NOED? Nurse's Calling only capitalizes on survivors healing near the killer (which they shouldn't be doing) whereas BBQ is the strongest perk a Nurse can use.
---
And it took the other survivor all that time to do the last fuckin' gen
---
You’re a fucking legend. I can’t use flashlights bc I suck ass at the game. 
---
Why don't you ask Farmer John himself, instead of clipping up his content right as it comes out?
---
That's not 100% confirmed. It might be latency but it could also be actually broken hitboxes.
---
No, not at all. Myers is honestly a pretty poor killer without addons as getting his stalk faster is such a big thing. Hag plays almost the same with or without addons without having to worry about setting up fast while mikey pretty well has to hit tier two before gens are up or he’s lost. 
---
Mad Grit, bring dat ass hea boi
---
Yes. There are some small color changing cosmetics, but other than that there are few things you can get
---
The main problem is balancing around SWF. As a solo player it's been pushing me to play more killer.
---
nah, mclean said the hitboxes are actually alright and it’s mainly latency. he’s not a liar, he’s honest and i believe him.
---
Myers and Pig and Spirit shoulf be able to get deviousness easy wtf
---
Alright, could you send me a link to where I could see that? Just for confirmation 
---
Face masks never go out of style imo!  I may get her Cyber Punk cosmetics for something to change up (that jacket and shades are to die for) but for now it's Harajuku Ninja!  I find Killers sometimes avoid me when seeing me xD I guess there's a reputation for Toxic Neas with the Pink hair xD
---
Steam says they cannot modify or restore achievements. This is on their end not bhvr’s and ive tried talking to them 5 times and keep getting the its not possible run around
---
Bullshit. It's not the killer's fault that a survivor is shitty and wants to duck his team over.
---
Eat Doritos, drink Mountain Dew, remember to 360 no scope, and nae nae on those newbs.
---
Nah man, in a chase there is no counters to her traps. Slow movement speed doesnt mean shit when you are bouncing around like a pinball, and the only way to counter her traps outside of a chase is to crouch everywhere, wasting a bunch of time.
---
that's happening in my games too
---
it’ll be in one of his recent twitch vods, yesterday or the day before. someone asked him about broken hitboxes and he replied that a lot of people complained about them, that he checked this issue and it’s much more of a latency problem to do with the lag compensation given to killers.
---
Has anyone ever had fun against Legion? Anyone? No? Okay. 
---
Omg same! They chase me for a bit and then abandon me and I get so confused 😂 now I know why. Might use basic nea like the old times for a laugh and see how that changes
---
Hope actually gives a bigger speed boost than NOED. Hope gives 7% at teir three, NOED gives 4% at teir three.
---
I agree.  I feel like I deal with way more dcs, suicides, tunnelers, and campers in purple ranks on average.   
---
Sounds about right 
---
I gave it a [shot] (https://i.imgtc.com/ARujAaK.png)
---
I have a friend who did the same thing played mostly exclusively dbd on his daughters ps4 and played weekdays since she comes on weekends. But summer is coming and she stays there the whole summer so he bought a second ps4 lol
---
When you tunnel so hard but you don’t succeed....
---
here
---
In all honesty, while I don't use it (because I never hit it) it seems EASILY abusable by killers. Chase the guy who went down, wait a minute afterwards, then hook. Real easy to just turn "off" the perk now
---
Yeah I play F13 a lot just for a nice relaxing change of pace. 
---
The nurse should be above the hillbilly. Hillbilly should be way further down. I find he’s quite over rated. Sure he can instadown you, but that’ll only happen when survivors mess up. Billy still gets looped as easily as any other killer, and when survivors are playing smart, he isn’t that strong
---
In the case of a bunch of randoms the game seems to be decently balanced. In the case of 4 player SWF running good perks and items, yes survivors CAN dictate the game but they do not always dictate the game.
---
As long as you have fun and enjoy yourself it doesn’t matter how much you spent, the only reason I bought a PS4 was for spider man. 
---
I don’t know man, I think a lot of that unbalance is toxic people playing SWF together. I used to play SWF with three other friends and we made an actual effort to play fairly/consciously and not do stuff just for the sake of pissing off the killer.
---
At the end of the day, it’s just a game. Both sides want to win but that doesn’t mean you should want the other side to not have fun. If you do then the player base is going to drop off. 
---
I don’t play toxically on either side of the ball. I don’t use exploits, I don’t stack my perks to be toxic, I don’t play games with 4 Claudette’s with purple flashlights, I don’t face camp. I just try to have fun and do what I can to make the other side have fun. 
---
Well that’s like saying when the killers playing smart he can easily get a 4K I’m going to have to respectfully disagree with you 
---
I personally think they should work towards fun rather than balancing for competitive play. I simply don't think the game design makes anything approaching true balance feasible.
---
...You know too much. \*Bingbongs away\*
---
report them after match.
---
Or just light em up with a flashlight, lmao.
---
Spend the $10 a month and get game pass. You can try out tons of games. Unfortunately though dbd is pretty much a one of a kind game. Many have tried to be similar all have failed. F13 is fun if you’re into memeing and goofing around but personally it’s pretty boring if you’re not with a fun group of players. 
---
Survivor Mains: Drake
---
Killer Mains: Josh
---
Switch Mains: Megan
---
Spectator Mains: Oprah when she got run over by Josh
---
Pig is good because it's ironic to have a quick death in a saw movie.
---
Yeah, but that’s where a lot of the killer complaints are coming from is with SWF. So it feels like the devs are indulging those killers which doesn’t account for that lot of people who play solo or even just casually. 
---
They’re changing the game to account for one exploit that not every person in game uses which makes exponentially more difficult for those didn’t use them already 
---
That I can understand, but I don’t see why you put billy above nurse
---
Yes!! 
---
“Helen, be my victim”
---
There's a growing group of survivor players, here especially, who encourage each other to disconnect during a match if they don't like their opponent or their build.  I'm sure this will be controversial, nobody enjoys being criticized but it's not untrue. The problem is getting worse, not better. There's nothing BHVR can do besides increase the consequences for disconnecting, but it's a player behavior issue, not a development one. 
---
You are 100% the asshole here. Tunneling someone down just because they knew how to loop you is a cunt move. 
---
He did literally nothing wrong, he didn’t even dc till last hook so he didn’t hurt his team, and you tunneled him out of the game. 100% correct calling you a shitty idiot. 
---
I agree. I also think that the recent killers they’ve come out with have been really frustrating to play against. 
---
this raises a better question
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
would someone fuck the entity?
---
With the previous match making system on PC, I would click "Join a Lobby" right? Before even letting go of the mouse button, it would find a game. Instant. Now I sit there waiting upwards of over a minute. I'm not liking this change, needless to say. As a killer there doesn't seem to be much of a difference.
---
He did literally nothing scummy tho?
---
I'm a Myers main and I approve this post.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE ME SMILE? IF THOSE INCOMPETENT DEVS OVER AT BHVR WOULD PUT IN THERE NEWS FEED ABOUT THE NEW MATCH MAKING SYSTEM AND HAVE IN BIG BOLD F-ING letters 
---
“SURVIVORS WILL NOW SPAWN IN AT THE SAME TIME AND MIGHT NOT BE A SWF SO QUIT DC”
---
I'll definitely see when I get to use her. See how bad its gonna be. I need to start practicing more with the huntress. I use people that is hard to loop. So far I use legion, freddy, and spirit. I've been practicing the nurse too. 
---
Not tunneling isn’t cutting slack, it’s not being a douche. Its your fault and your fault alone if you can’t deal with hard to run loops
---
Tunneling? Mildly scummy
---
Whose to say you "deserved" your escape? If you're dead, you're dead. You didn't win anything, you didn't complete the objective.
---
Entirely new ability that doesn’t remove skill from the equation
---
Frank is a good break from susie
---
Haha boobs
---
I really don't like the amount of hate Tru3 can get sometimes. He is a very good play on both sides and understand the macro game very well. He can keep track of where most survivors are most of time and has a very good understanding about the game and how certain situations need to be played out. If you watch him play you will see that he compliments players when they make a good move and points out why/how people are making mistakes, himself included, and come at the game in a very rationable way. He may point out some flaws about the game very often but he accepts the way some things are and pushes through it. Not all but many people on this sub like to be VERY one sided towards something and the only solution is to nerf something into the ground or remove it which is why I think people don't like Tru3 as much. A lot of people here get very heated when talking about something that they dislike and Tru3 likes to talk about the things that need changing.
---
Pretty often. It’s like 2 gens and a save to pop I think so if I get that or more I start playing cocky and taking aggro so teamates who need the escape to pip can get it 
---
Your dedication to saving that Kate was like a Hollywood film. That being said, can bhvr please fix those bugs? I'm not even talking about the vaulting. Meg's skirt is all stretched out and horrible and so are a lot of the other skirts for female characters.
---
I’d say nea. Low level killers are easy as fuck to juke with ue and balanced landing is a good exhaustion perk
---
What did you do to Bubba? 
---
No, not "but still", you ended your own argument by admitting a bias. You're not good. Or even taking it a step further and pretending "you're good", the people you're playing aren't good. You don't get to have an opinion on it when you're just uninformed. Sorry if I sound crude or rude but I hate when people just open their mouth and spew ignorant opinions. Play him. Play him a lot. Play him against real survivors who know what they're doing. If you time you shock to stop a loop, you deserved the hit. Some loops are so dam hard to stop even with the stun because you slow down when you do the shock. You're entire argument based on the premise that your bad and play bad people, thank god everyone listens to you and we use your voice for the cornerstone of game balance. P.S. just sayin' fam
---
They didn't seem too upset to me lol. It seemed like they thought it was funny. 
---
Having four points of view is an advantage over having one point of view.
---
She's odd.  I do encourage trying her out, but from my admittedly limited experience she was like a slightly worse Chainsaw killer without Corrupt Purge, but a slightly stronger Huntress with it.  I look forward to seeing how she develops in the meta.
---
What if there was a mechanic in place where if you do NOT solo que as a survivor, there is some type of penalty to kind of re-balance the playing field? Say, a 25% slower repair speed on generators? Now we are only rank 16 &amp; 17 survivors respectively, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. Much rather hear what you guys think if there was something like this in place? Would it work, or...?
---
It just sucks that the more you play the game, the less you can play the game
---
In my personal experience as survivor, rank 12 - 5 killers always run ebony mori and use it after first unhook. I try my best to get out of that cesspool as fast as possible. As killer, 12 - 5 is usually one good survivor who is unfortunately stuck with 3 plain-clothes Bills. I only ever get good games from ranks 5 - 1 on both sides, but even then the skill level fluctuates from "hidden rank 20" to "og 6,000 hours". I've never understood deranking on purpose
---
I CAN BLAME MAP FOR BILLY. FUCK LERYS.
---
I've often got yellow flashlights from chests and just shining them (especially around windows and hooked people) will show them. It's not that hard.
---
I could hear the trappers retinas screaming
---
Legion can locate you with their power so stealth isnt optimal against them, nurse have to rely on tracking perks. 
---
oink
---
Too many high ping lobbies. It was actually a rare sight for me to be in 200+ ping lobby before.
---
Getting them from chests is heavy RNG and I was talking about traps spread around the map, not at hooked peoples feet. You cant predict those, and know where they are, if the Hag is good.
---
Hope and wake up with adrenaline are end game god tier perks
---
Alternatively, every time I use streamers as a survivor I get tunneled or the killer home-screens...
---
Got me running no mither tonight lol
---
This Is Not Happening
---
Now give me upvotes
---
Unpopular opinion: i dont know what is it about the doctor but i find him fun to face. 
---
When I SWF we dc if it’s franks mix legion/ moonwalking exploit, iri heads+ ebony, and or prayer spirit. 
---
Yeah, I get this too. Want to be the first to die? Offer up a BP streamers offering.
---
Trapper should absolutely be at the bottom without perks or add ons.
---
If it was against Freddy he might have been trying to save your team from blood warden activating.
---
Yep i play on my buddies ps4 all the time and its hard enough at lower ranks to get matches.
---
that actually requires timing and skill, and can still be countered
---
He lost his charger
---
Killer lag switching at the end
---
Ugh so annoying. I play killer a lot so I try to think of it from the killer POV—they still want points &amp; to rank up, but holy crap, what an unfair game. Usually when it happens to me when I’m killer, I’ll smack them around a bit and let them go.
---
Nah, it\`s just another boring streamer that tries to promote his stream by clipping rank 20 killers, nothing new here.
---
Take it you all died?
---
sorry but this artwork makes me wanna do the opposite
---
Don't forget the haybale loops where the tiles are just high enough for survivors to see the killers head, but killers can't see the survivors/throw hatchets of them and whatnot. 
---
&gt;A good game developer 
---

Choose one

It would make sense that he's chinese because he was based on a real life chinese doctor that would use electric shocks to "train" WoW addicts to stop playing games. Feng is an e-sports competitor and it's no big secret that the story of [Yang Yongxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Yongxin) is inspiration for Doctor. Wikipedia even has a section on that very page explaining the connection to DBD.
---
That’s not entirely true.  Except for maybe Sundays, DLC on PS4 can appear at anytime.  There was new stuff added today for other games.  I’ve seen new stuff show up on Saturdays in the past.  I was really hoping the new chapter would magically appear today.  😭
---
Sucks.
---
Then be conscientious of where traps could be and don't be dumb and run in those places.
---
this is why you never use perks that help your teammates, selfish perks that help YOU are best perks.
---
What’s SWF?
---
That's exactly what I said, they gave it an ALL tier buff for 40 metres across three...
---
Dem feels
---
It fits her character. She's sadistic, methodical, and she gets her job done. That just screams a taunting, but quick and mostly painless mori imo
---
What about the game?
---
Let me just hit that subscribe button real quick. I mean, huh? 
---
Hey man, I tried my best. There's a limit before I turn my back on you and save my own skin. 
---
I hate u
---
To be fair it depends on the killer at that point.  I'll just shake my head and walk away from someone if they spawn next to me.
---
"so what if my ping was 800 in the lobby? ur lag switching bro"
---
this mm is super hot garbage, 500 pings all day and then i get a team with 3 level 15's, im level 10 solo and killer is level 11, he downs all 3 of them and i try my best to get them up but they just die again. jesus it was so bad i did that one game and im done for the night with teams like this.
---
Apparently you can.
---
So instead of saving my teammate on their third hook while the last person is working on the generator, I should just not buy my team time? 
---
I know a Jake Park main when I see one lol
---
Honestly I’m more excited about the DH buff
---
I dont quite understand what you mean? hooks?
---
ᴋ
---
only activated if they haven’t hooked or downed anyone before the gates open
---
therefore, killers are either forcing themselves to play shittier, or wasting a perk slot
---
😊
---
Number of times you put a survivor on the hook. 
---
you do realize they dont have to add everything horrific he did? right?
---
it's like you assume thye have to lmao
---
they can make his mori something like his slicing up his victims or even slicing their throats.
---
I doubt people would be upset by it tbh
---
In the case of this game, I don't think you do fix it. The only way to fix it would be to make Make voice chat not matter or remove SWF. The game was original released without the ability to queue up with friends so perks like bond and empathy helped out a lot. Once they released SWF those perks didn't matter because players could communicate their position.
---
So being realistic SWF will not go away not would I really wan't it to. Losing the ability to player a game you like with your friends would suck. So the other option is to make the ability to communicate with your teammates not provide an advantage however this games structure is already set in stone. They can't go and change the fact the people need to get gens done and others need to distract the killer.
---
Then lies the issue that if you make the killer stronger and able to stand up against 4 man SWF all top tier perks and insta-heals then the killer will be so string that he will stomp and group of solos the come their way.
---
I think that we have to accept the fact that for the most part this game does not require an insane amount of skill and a group of decent survivors can do really good against a killer especially on a map that does not favor the killer. You will not always run into the 4 man SWF but when you do prepare to just get 1 maybe 2 kills and leave it at that.
---
My opinion on balance would be to limit what a survivor can bring into a game. For example only 1 insta-heal med kit allowed. I don't like the idea of the insta-heal med kit at all but if it must be in the game please limit it. Decisive strike is being nerfed but if it were not being nerfed I would suggest only 1 person is allowed to have it and other survivors would have to use a previously picked "Back up perk" that would replace their D-strike perk if they were not randomly chosen as the obsession. Next fix the walls on the farm maps. Survivors can see through them and it completely eliminates the mind game of looping and gives a huge advantage to survivors. I have a few other ideas but This comment has already gone on long enough lol.
---
TL:DR - There are a few things that could be changed but besides that balance is a hard thing to find when the unbalanced part comes from groups playing together.
---
Oink
---
Absolutely needs a blood point boost since its basically just hard mode. I love using No Mither but you pretty much need a whole build (Iron will, tenacity, and dead hard) if you plan on surviving and the BP boost would be nice. Sometimes I'll use it for altruism build though where I take the L for the team and the boost would be nice there too
---
So if Monto came out tomorrow claiming the same thing, would you now accept the claims?
---
Agreed.
---
the blade isn’t parallel with the arm and i can’t unsee it
---
Eh you're not wrong
---
Context?
---
Where did you see this at?
---
How do we know they're brand new just because their killer rank is low though?
---
Thanks! :) was just wondering 
---
Depends on who's playing the killer lol I had a guy who started right next to me and was looking at me and didn't even give me a piece of a silver of an inch of a chance to even start the match 
---
Before posting it I said it in that billy the puppet etc voice 
---
i’m supposed to overwhelm and bully the other side what the heck!!!! devs fix your broken game!!!
---
What exactly is happening to it?
---
She's adorable!
---
Evander Holyfield new survivor then.
---
As long as Legion exist... No.
---
nah dude balanced landing, check that speed boost when she jumps down the stairs
---
Yeah I use speed and duration add ons. You at least need those then she's definitely top 3. Personally with those(yellow or green) or the amulet she's top 3. Without them maybe top 5ish
---
You can only activate it within a minute of being unhooked.
---
Tier lists are subjective and everyones is different.  I don't see a reason to be toxic about opinions on something like this.  Honestly don't see a reason to be toxic most of the time.  I usually get told how nice a killer I am because I refuse to kill if enough gens are still up and a dc happens or if someone is unhooked in front of me I ignore them and go for the unhooker.  Just dont find matches fun like that as survivor so not gonna make people go through it as killer.
---
They have customization, Laurie has two shirts. 
---
Are you the authority on what constitutes a good survivor? I've played at rank one for a long while now, swapping various builds. I can run the killer reasonably well as long as it's not a "spirit fury/enduring" build, dear god that sucks. Ranks don't indicate skill level at all, but they do push you into a different echelon of "game type"... where tunneling and camping is rampant. Survivors being pussies and ragequitting on their first down, or "Urban/Iron Will/Live Forever" camping hooks and pulling you immediately after getting hooked only to have the killer desperately tunnel you down.
---
 Personally I don't mind the change they are making to D-strike. It seems fitting and it looks like it will still fill its intended purpose in my kit. I never hopped on the Dstrike train until probably 4 months ago.  
---
Now... all of the sudden.... the game is more fun. I don't HAVE to take Dstrike... there are plenty of other options. But none of those options yield ANYWHERE near the overall enjoyment boost and potential to avoid scumbag plays from both my own teammates and the killer. When you live in a world where the hooks are the least enjoyable and easily trolled aspect of the game. Who in their right mind wouldn't want to avoid getting on one? To say you aren't a "good survivor" if you take DS is total BS.  
---
DS seldom "wins" the game for me. Shit if you don't get the obsession it's rare you get to use it anyway. If the killer wan'ts me to loop them for 5 minutes, slam multiple pallets in their face, lose all map pressure, the rest of my team does 4 gens during 1 chase...... then when they finally catch me... I DS... and they still want to pursue me for 5 more minutes. That's their fault.   
---
What wins the game for me is finding Ruin quickly, making smart map transitions and keeping check on the killer location, knowing when to unhook so my teammate doesn't get jacked up, knowing not to Generator-Fuck ourselves so we aren't ping-ponging 2 gens that are 2 feet apart, judging whether it's the smart play to  to be the bait to help my team unhook... or say fuck it and do a generator.
---
Pig is crap, seriously.
---
To be completely honest pig is truly terrible against good players. You don't patrol the map in stealth mode as its much too slow compared to how fast the game will go which makes her just an M1 killer. Most loops cannot be mind gamed with her crouch dash and even then the timing is quite easy to just slam the pallet on your head if you try and get it off.
---
Her power basically just says "wastes between 20 and 80 seconds of a survivors time after being unhooked depending on RNG"
---
She is arguably worse than freddy as they are both M1 bots except he has better tracking and spreading his dream world pressure will waste more time than her reverse bear traps if done properly. 
---
Leatherface is WAY stronger than pretty much your entire C and D tier list simply due to the ability to punish an out of position survivor with a one shot down consistently and because he punishes aggressive hook saves.
---
What does a killer have to do with the topic of no debuff timer to stop people from constantly disconnecting? Because a killer may seem overpowered, or because players just don't "like" a certain killer/build/map they should be allowed to just disconnect 24/7 until they find a more favorable match?
---
I wouldn’t say Freddy has the highest skill cap, but I suppose you could argue the highest experience cap. I’d consider skill cap to be like motor skills or being good in the chase, timing your swings and stuff like that, but Freddy is a lot of decision making and micro management 
---
Oof Toxic, that’s like me saying Survivors are terrible against Good Pig mains it’s simply not a good reason
---
Ending chat message “why did I install this”
---
That’s fucking funny 
---
I honestly didn't care about what they were saying, thought this place might get a giggle though
---
Oh shit does this happen?
---
This is like a Slasher flick. Low budget but still really good.
---
Self care is not one of the strongest survivor perks. It’s a crutch that will end up hurting you more than helping, especially if the killer has sloppy butcher. Dwight’s bond is a much better alternative.
---
I'm a Xbox kinda guy I suck more or less really but have fun playing if you want I'll play with you and just have fun win or lose shoot me a pm if you want
---
I love this so much thank you!
---
I take it you didn't know it was a Spirit?
---
What? No. I main Trapper and I haven’t used addons in 3 MONTHS. I don’t rely on perks to much other than basement. Trapper isn’t rock bottom. I understand he is a shitty killer but just no. Trapper *theoretically* is the best killer since he can *technically* down every survivor in the match and can stop windows and pallets from being used. What can Freddy do? That is what rock bottom is.
---
D/Cs happen frequently against every killer.
---
Ok. So that is how long it takes for it connect to the other players?
---
Think so yeah.
---
Thanks, then.
---
Swf definitely determines the game. How many times have you guys seen a steamer do the no perk swf challenge? They all make it to rank one. This is coming from somebody who literally only plays survivor when my 3 mates are playing. This game is super easy when you have a coordinated team.
---
I'm a killer main when I'm alone. And a survivor main with my mates.  I've been rank one on both (although I will admit I don't like getting that low on killer any more for this specific reason). 
---
This game was designed around no communication on the survivor side. And it really impacts the killers. 
---
I've said it for awhile.  They need to enable voice chat survivors and literally balance the game around it. Because at this point at the low ranks where the game really matters there are more SWF than there isn't.  
---
Ok
---
I get many messages from killers tell me to kill myself or asking if I am in an swf to justify their garbage plays. It definitely is a thing.
---
The running joke I have with my SWF is "You know how I now you're being toxic? You're playing DBD. Trying to survive as a survivor? Toxic. Killing as a killer? Toxic."
---
well if one player on a team has small game hunt noed is useless so....
---
I'm not 
---
About 80% sure.
---
Hey, that's me!
---
Me too.
---
Tapp was my first P3, and I could have don't it with Jake, Dwight, or anyone else.
---
He is my PTB tester, has all the perks, and best of all he has no hair or loose clothing to give you away with the elastic bugs. 
---
Thanks so much i hope to eventually draw them all and survivors as well :&gt;
---
Lately I've been running adrenaline, dead hard, resilience, and this is not happening because healing takes too long anyway, but if you have we'll make it then I'll let you heal
---
Gg my soul left my body
---
Killers closing lobbies at the pre-game screen because they feel threatened by the survivor players. For example
---
3 survivors with toolboxes? Nope, time to back out and create a new lobby! Prestige skins? Nope, these survivors have invested a lot of time into the game and are probably going to provide a challenge, better leave!
---
Any survivor will tell you how fucking obnoxious this is. Especially during off-hours and rank resets when queue times are *brutal*. I used to try to play before work, and would waste about 45 minutes altogether just searching for rounds because I used a p3 skin and nearly every single killer was dodging me all morning 
---
I guess I’m a dum dum then. 
---
sacrifice complete
---
I was.  Plunderer’s was for a daily 
---
Quentin's p3 looks better than any other survivors you cant change my mind
---
he killed this whole sub guys
---
Well there playstation japan posted this:https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/386460686747828226/557387417192235008/unknown.png (translated to english) No idea if its legit or not but seems legit 🤷
---
My favorite time I ran into a leatherface basement camp. The Leatherface literally didn't leave the basement. He just waited for some idiot to show up which they did at like Gen#4 being finished. Before we finished the last gen by the end the leatherface has a 4K. 
---
Glad I’m not alone on this one 
---
*Ravioli ravioli  
---
Don't lewd the stabby psycholi*
---
I would have been livid. Done for the rest of the week to cool off from that match. Great video though. Very nice. 
---
There was a toxic piece of shit in my dota game the other day with the same name, wonder if it was the same person
---
Thank ya
---
I took them 3 mins to finish 1 gen and kate kept looping the 2nd floor without balanced landing typical solo queue in a nutshell.
---
Great cosplay. Anyway to grunge up the hair a bit?
---
Is this what it’s like having children?
---
Interesting perks! 2nd might be a bit overpowered, and the third one seems very situational, but still being interesting!
---
Thank you!! I’m curious, how would you balance the second perk?
---
It's an amazing perk if you can get at least 6 stacks. Allows you to basically maintain pressure in a chase after a hit and your capacity to defend a hook shoots up.
---
Thank you for breaking the game again. Glad I get to play with China killers now as a survivor player. I appreciate red ping 9/10. Much more enjoyable now........
---
REAL TALK, I was so mad earlier. I got into a match with a clown and he was shit. He took down people, but he just stood in front of their hook (of course), and despite that, people were still getting off of hooks.
---
It was just me &amp; a Meg left, Meg goes down, and I figure, I'm going to finish this gen, open the doors, save her. Finished the gen, got found, and mind you, I'm just a lowly Dwight playing solo survivor with one perk (bond) and no items, so I did a lap around the map so that Meg could recover--he's huffing and throwing bottles that are completely off target, they miss me by a huge amount of distance. I SEE MEG, I'm amped, because I figure I can take a hit for her while doing a tap heal and I'm going to pick her up and I'm going to be a HERO DWIGHT, we're gonna survive and we're gonna roll off into the sunset together. I am HERO DWIGHT, THE UNDERDOG OF THE MATCH.
---
I almost get to her and the stupid Clown caught up with me and had NOED. I had never been hooked or even INJURED the entire match, even though I spent a lot of it playing distraction so that other people could be unhooked while he was camping them.
---
I'm normally pretty understanding because I play killer a lot, but he didn't deserve that 4k &amp; it's total bullshit. Fuck NOED.
---
Reduce the speed, 150% faster then your NORMAL speed seems extremely fast, and perhaps the avoiding damage may be a bit too much, I would say either keeping one of them and removing the other, 
---
Hippity hoppity, your soul is now my property.
---
IDK, ridiculously skilled nurses and 4 man SWF is pretty unfair.
---
Alright, here's a controversial post... -clears throat- NOED IS NOT TOXIC OR HARD TO COUNTER, SURVIVORS SHOULD JUST DO DULL TOTEMS. Also to get some of my fellow killers DECISIVE IS NOT TOXIC OR HARD TO COUNTER, JUST SWING YOUR WEAPON TO THROW OFF SURVS OR SPEND ANOTHER FEW SECONDS CHASING, NOT THAT HARD. Alright, everyone have a good day, need to make funeral arrangements for my Karma.
---
i love nyooming down the street but that’s almost all you have.
---
Being a toxic asshole means you get to be a fog whisperer.   It is actively encouraged to engage in disruptive behavior.
---
Positive difference here. No longer 15-20 min waits for killer lobbies on pc.
---
Do you play console or pc? Cause I'm on Xbox 
---
Lmfaoo talkin about his son
---
But using the best addons usually ends up in a quick game which doesnt give anyone a lot of points.
---
I have seen so many Huntresses using BPS with Iri-Hatchets ending up with a 4k but only get like 12k points, thats not how you do it.
---
Dead Hard?
---
All justifiable. Sorry but im not wasting my time against OP bullshit that shouldn’t be in the game. I don’t give a damn about the wasted add-on or mori.  
---
Ehh wraith can be absolute aids without add ons. Otherwise I agree with the rest
---
Thank you for this!
---
Awesome!
---
I can roll with those odds.
---
Facts are facts!!
---
You probably played like scum tbh.
---
Probably PS4. No one has spaces in their username and there are a few symbols, which is a tell-tale sign of a PS4 username. Could be wrong, but it's most likely PS4. 
---
Are you the guy who messaged me

I posted it earlier

Hate to break it to you but heifers can have horns too... lol

Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Your videos make me hate legion that much more.  
---
Small Game
---
Love the art!!!
---
Everything is going according to plan.
---
Here you dropped this \
---
It's an old uncommon Map Offering for Haddonfield from back when all Maps had common, uncommon, and rare variants which all increased the chance to play that map by differing amounts.
---
They were removed by Patch 1.8.0 to reduce clutter in bloodwebs, so if someone used this they've been playing the game for quite a while.
---
I need like two weeks to make it beyond rank 7 because I get matched up so shitty. Everything after that feels way more easy. But I also have a friend who is back in red ranks after four days so maybe I am just a shitty player myself xD
---
Agree. I don’t blame any survivor for DCing against Legion or any OP add-on and mori. Like you said, the killer dodging logic is that they want a “fair game”...which typically means a game against a solo queue where the killer has the advantage going in. And yet, I’m supposed to suck it up against iri hatchets? Lol doesnt work like that....see ya!
---
Why is there spaces on the last 5?
---
Was going through a box of stuff in my attic and found this.  It’s a sticker.  No idea where it came from.
---
What?
---
Too late.  Thanks for the discounted game mate.
---
Watch high rank streamers and copy what they do (minus the whining). 
---
This game is almost 100% knowing what to do, which means unlike other games you can improve just by watching 
---
I’m just glad we don’t have post and end game chat on PS4. 
---
Between the number and the name, there’s no spaces until the last 5
---
Right they can still be used but are no longer coming up in bloodwebs. I also found out yellow is considerably and green offerings are tremendous.
---
Supa cute
---
I dont know this text is messing up sometimes there's no spaces sometimes there is
---
NO
---
You misspelled Verizon 
---
I'm still crossing my fingers we'll get Speedo Quentin and Grandma Laurie, but I'll admit it ain't looking too good.

I never expected a (no lifer kek) someone whos played a while to be in the same lobby as me because I'm bad at survivor

---
If you're playing clown and fail to hook more than twice in a match you're doing something very wrong my friend lol
---
&gt;Killers will find it harder to sacrifice survivors due to their new buffs, however have a lot more time on their hands since the survivor has to repair the remaining generators before getting their win
---
Not with that 25% increase in repair speed, they won't. This seems like a massive buff to survivors and a massive nerf to killers.
---
Leatherface aint give no fucks.
---
I’m sold on this idea, hatch standoffs are boring as hell, this would increase end game tension and would be a welcome change 
---
I think The Plague is pretty fun to fight but I do have problems with how Freddy and Legion are. 
---
If you make me use my sprintburst to heal you... GL out there, be free my lil bird. 
---
4% each* /s
---
Well yea if they’re literally going to add him as a killer then what would be the point in adding him if it’s not really him? Jack the Rippers whole thing was maiming, killing and dismembering prostitutes. I personally don’t think it belongs in DBD and I don’t see how they could do it justice in a non offensive way if they tried. If they made him like you suggest it’s not really him. 
---
I think more people would find it off-putting than you think. When it’s crimes of a severe sexual violent nature/ rape it seems a bit fucked up to play as someone who actually did that. I’m sure they’d never add real killers for that exact reason. 
---
Maybe people lose perspective because it was a long time ago, or maybe you’re not from London. But real women were brutally killed. Idk, sue me but I don’t think that deserves to be celebrated. 
---
Because as a solo player I have time to take a different perk and hunt down totems while my teammates crouch in a corner
---
is the pizza conspiracy real? 🤔
---
Sub-ironic cringe. Love it
---
Really? Killers go against 4 people at a time just fine and it’s not that hard to patrol 2 or 3 gens, plus if it’s a really bad game, the last survivor is almost surely never going to complete all 5 gens by themselves no matter if it’s 25% increased speed or not. 
---
"slapper Billy"
---
No chainsaw, just smacks
---
No one is talking about how horrid the Plague is. Being a germaphobe, she would scare me the most if I had to face against her. 
---
Sizzlin' with Freddy. 
---
You don't know how bad you jump scare huntresses doing that. Even as killer I open lockers randomly not expecting them to be in there. 
---
Learn to play without tunnelling and camping.
---
Instead learn how to cut off survivors' loop points and direction. Killers will always be faster than survivors and if you know how to cut them off, you are guaranteed to catch them, especially when Bloodlust got activated. 
---
Here’s how I look at it, and why I think it’s fine. A game against solo players is definitely advantage killer. A game against a mixed queue is probably a balanced game. A game against a 4 man SWF is obviously advantage survivors. I know it’s not this cut and dry because it depends on the caliber of players, some 4 mans are potatoes and some randoms could be strong. But I’d say in general, that’s how it would stack up. I think in the end, everything balances out. You’ll get some easy games, some harder games, some right in the middle. The problem I see is when killers dodge lobbies to tilt everything into their favor by trying to avoid any SWF.
---
There’s not much they can do aside from a little post match extra BP maybe, a multiplier based on the amount of SWF. Nothing crazy, I’m not talking double BP. I also think though that anyone playing solo survivor should receive a similar bonus.
---
I love innocent Megs
---
Oh these are awesome, may get matching ones for me and a friend!
---
Who made this?
---
Those 4 people also don't have a 25% increase to repair speed, lmao. And nobody said anything about 5 gens. 2 or 3 gens by yourself with 25% increased repair speed (especially if you've got a toolbox) isn't that hard, especially if you 99% them before popping them all in quick succession so the killer has no reaction time.
---
Thats exactly how i see it, all the bullshit this game comes with, isnt worth the work he was trying to accomplish.
---
Oh no
---
I literally said its not toxic just aggravating and like i said we dunno if the streaming survivor is just an all-round douche or situationally-angry, but we have proof from OP’s explanation that the guy was being an ass about it on stream. 
---
[Here u go](https://www.reddit.com/r/DBDGoneGay/comments/b2ddl7/the_entity/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) its sfw i swear on the en-tities.
---
You could tell he just got sick of all the bullshit like the "survivor rule handbook" and stream sniping and general cancerous community as well as massive unbalance (at the time i stopped), he was swimming upstream in a river of shit and he just got fed up, with that came attitude and extreme opinions, he just want happy streaming dbd anymore.
---
Consequently, whenever I get Haddonfield as Billy, that's all I do.
---
kind of pissed a week ago i bought a bunch of killers. but i did get the spirit/adam francis pack for 3 dollars so im happy :)
---
B u t. AMANDA'S FUKING CUTE. How else can I look at my sweet piggy babe w/ out lewds??

This can explain why Michael never speaks. He just can't hear us so he can't reply. 
---
E X C E L L E N T
---
Didn't realize this game had an escort mission mode lol
---
That trapper could have just not tunneled for 3 seconds and gotten a hook or 2 more. Hope he learned from that experience
---
just nyoom, no murder?
---
He explained it in a comment
---
This was similar to an idea I had but mine used existing elements already in the game. Essentially, you have your rank and you have bloodpoints. So for matchmaking it should consider both on whatever character your trying to match.
---
Before I go into what I mean, the other big change is that matchmaking should consider Only the highest ranked survivor in the lobby when matching to killer. So if a SWF group with 3lvl 15s and a rank 1 don't get put with low ranked killers and instead get treated as if they are all ranked 1. Most of those toxic streamers you see abuse the current system with the way it is now. 
---
I feel that ranks need to be more per character. While I may be able to play doctor at rank 5 doesn't mean I can also play nurse at rank 5. This way I don't have to wait to derank to play a killer I'm not used to at that rank. It would even help survivors because typically people main 1 survivor but get dailies for others so if it's a survivor you didn't put bloodpoints in and have a daily then you'll get lower ranks. However, the system I have planned will make that irrelevant so survivors could keep their shared rank. I'm cool either way. 
---
The next aspect is bp spent on the character. A rank 15 survivor who has never prestiged is much different than a p3 rank 15 survivor who has 3 tiers in every perk. They haven't put time in that character or are legitimately new and just playing the game normally. If it considers this while match making then it will place them with killers who have equal load-outs at the same rank. It's easier to notice this as killer because you may only have 1 tier in every perk and barely any addons but the survivors at the same rank all have rare items and full loadouts, which adds to a vast mismatch even if you are the same rank. 
---
The only issue with this is the ability to switch characters after lobby. So they would have to make it where once you enter a killerlobby your character is locked in and can't switch it, for both killers and survivors. Which would cut out the 'quick switch' toxic meta. 
---
then how do you explain the uneven cuts and edges? 🤔
---
I feel like any trial with Bill it in he would just automatically take charge, he dealt with a zombie Apocalypse before, with a team of 4, im gonna listen to him, and he is a old soldier, he is gonna try his damm hardest to make sure everyone gets out alive.
---
~~I can make this more interesting~~
---
How is pig worse than Freddy? She can slow the game down for a long time compared to Freddy.
---
You're brand new to killer even if you've seen it done you're still a baby killer
---
But they also said they did a pretty good job so far
---
But if you've played surv you know how shitty facecamping is...
---
Devs ship Kate and Meg
---
You know, everyone is tired of the "hood man bad" posts but this is golden. You get a pass 
---
The funny thing is there's never a big enough emergency to use them "maybe there will be a bigger emergency".
---
"it seems a bit fucked up to play as someone who actually did that"
---
 But we have Freddy Krueger, who's whole M.O. was touching kids in his secret lair/ rape and being pervy towards/ touching them (older people) once he became the nightmare. 
---
Also no one is celebrating it, you're defeating your own points here. 
---
This isnt an argument I'm just saying they could make a Jack the ripper clone that looked like how he dressed but played to what he did. 
---
-Slashing and wounding
---
-stalking in a way that's not myers like
---
 
---
One mistake
---
Tier 1 Myers is immune to detection perks, so Premonition doesn't work against him
---
https://youtu.be/BKhDvxOy1KE here you go mate 👌
---
Honestly I think I’ll like it more from a survivor perspective, it’ll prevent a lot of tunneling which I’m definitely okay with.
---
4 people with 25% isn’t even close to equal with one person having 25%. You do know he said it’s only for the LAST survivor right? Not all 4 people? And yeah but have you ever played with a bad team and ended up being the last person with 4-5 gens still left? 
---
I love when these threads come up &lt;3
---
YEAAAHHHH GIVE US ANOTHER ONE. GIVE US ANOTHER ONE. YEAAAHHHH
---
... What.

The five antiseptics in my inventory know that,  it's nice to have a lot of every thing. 
---
DWIGHT THE KILLER IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU 
---
OH GOD OH NO HE HAS AIRPODS IN HE CAN’T HEAR US
---
I'd say make it a bit dirtier looks rather odd how clean it is based on how it is ingame
---
New perk: gen repair and killer movement speed reduced by 99%. Disables power.
---
I feel that the hitboxes are normal but the latency is just the worst. I don't even think it's a killer host/survivor internet problem because people complain about my host when I have great internet and the same goes when I'm playing survivor. I'm pretty sure it's just the games connection between players that's broken
---
If he was so crap, and guarding hooks and all then why didn't you guys have time to cleanse totems? 
---
Even without noed, it sounds like you two would have died anyways. Sure you could tap her back up but after taking that hit both of you would be injured by the time you got her up. He could smack either of you down. Then take his time looping whoever was still up. 
---
With no gates open there is no where for you to go. Noed from what you described only helped make the end game end quicker. 
---
Literally just watched this episode of ATLA/ What are the chances of that? lol
---
Just use Up the Ante. Problem solved
---
I've honestly never seen Blood Warden pop off in a video before, so thank you for this. Love it.
---
Sorry for the Snapchat video quality!
---
Wasn't hard in the beginning, it's how finally started to move down ranks. Then once you get past rank 14 and move into the colored ranks, that's when just about everyone gets wise to what you're doing unless you have a trick up your sleeve.
---
Insidious will help you get more unsuspecting noobs with the chainsaw
---
Where's the source? It's always good to credit artists for their hard work. 
---
Got devour hope, so I’m satisfied 
---
BBQ I guess? 
---
I'm 100% with you.
---
Funniest time this happened to me was when I played the offering that puts me as far from the killer, and another played an offering that spawns us all together. So 3 of us spawned in the killer shack with myers and I spawned just outside of the window of the shack. 
---
I never seen a myers tier up so swiftly lol. WHAT HAVE WE DONE!
---
hi adam
---
Dance With Me, Hangman's Trick, Surveillance (?), Discordance, and Corrupt Intervention.
---
Deliverance (such a fool for not grabbing it when it was out there), lithe, BBQ (who doesn’t), haunted grounds, rancor
---
Hook every1 twice and then just fool around with them 
---
New perk: GTFO. Makes the survivors DC and boots them out of the match just by seeing you.
---
Pool noodle lmfao. This comment needs more recognition.
---
Literally yesterday my friend and I were finally about to escape, we run over to the exit, see those massive Chad spikes, and I yell “HE HAS FUCKING BLOOD WARDEN WHAT THE FUCCKKKK” too good
---
I can confirm this. A lot of the “good” killers here on Xbox derank themselves. And by good I mean they’re shit. :)
---
Is this for usa only? 
---
Report him, he can get banned for holding game hostage
---
Body blocking?
---
Holding the game hostage.
---
*Cries in console*
---
I'm not sure how to check other regions but it's live in North America for sure.
---
Imagine asking for something that is already coming. 
---
Susie is honestly one of the fan-made cutest (It's where the fandom made the character cutest) killer imo.
---
Susie is just impretionable and wants friends.
---
You leave trapper alone, that dudes friend shaped. 
---
Its like if Instagram did a tier list.
---
Sure just give me your social security number and your bank account /s
---
Please nerf, BHVR should have realized how OP this is before release...
---
Extra thicc thghs is best thighs on Feng min
---
What the huntress is doing is holding the game hostage, but yeah technically body blocking. 
---
My guy you're killing me
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
It’s gets noticeable when you can’t hear the skill check warning so it won’t really matter
---
You hit the gen I think.
---
Then why would he want those perks specifically lmao
---
He was dead center of my screen, I don’t get how I swung through him and hit the gen
---
Switch Freddy with trapper and clown I'd say. Or at least put him at the bottom of C.
---
 I disagree with Billy being in front of nurse (I assume the first killer in each tier is supposed to be the best) and put hag to the top of A, if not in S. 
---
She is a lot less reliant on maps, add-ons and perks than spirit is
---
Idk I've saved a ton of shards once and 3/4 perks were one's I had so I got big bp pool
---
Honestly, the map is small enough that he doesn't do too bad.
---
I have a ton of practice with Billy on Lery's, and I feel like I don't do as bad as it looks on paper. 
---
Its a shame his looking cool is locked behind paying aswell. Thats kinda his issue, everything about them is a problem, their theme, their power and even their appearance, you have a killer who is mean to be 4 different people, and nothing at all about their gameplay ever links into that. You stick the skins next to each other and you just see four skins for a killer, you dont see the legion.
---
(Its also funny that the 2 aesthetically distinct legion skins are the two paywall ones, meanwhile the male and female of basically the same character are the free ones).
---
\*Moves an lone blade of grass, making tiniest rustling noise\*  
---
Me, while spinning the camera around wildly: "What was that? *Who's here? Come out come out" "*Oh wait, I think that was me, fuck"
---
Yes. I have 2000 hours in the game and probably 1500 as killer. Safe to say ive seen most things. If the pig succeeds with that move then the survivors must not have ears or not been looking behind them to notice the pig crouch down. There are very few loops ambush works on against experienced players.
---
Freddy can CONSTANTLY spam his sleep on people over and over and each one is wasting time. A good freddy who doesn't tunnel and is constantly sleeping different targets will waste WAY more time. It is not even close. Hell if the freddy runs remember me and even stacks it to a decent amount they can easily gain 75 seconds in the "gate" phase alone. That is on average two pig traps worth of time. Let alone the rest of the match of constantly sleeping everybody and swapping targets.
---
No matter way you math it, freddy delays the game more than pig. It also gives him tracking which by default saves time as freddy rarely ever has to waste time trying to find survivors.
---
From a pure game mechanics standpoint - pig is just not very strong and is even weaker than people realize simply because most survivor teams do not play the game efficiently.
---
More like a petty one
---
I really, really like this. I’m all for mind games.
---
Man........I'm not gonna pick a specific side, but how in the hell do you think there is nothing unfair about the game? 
---
Leather face.. the face camper
---
As long as there’s no mixtape I’ll play vs 1-2 legions a week and not flame, but past that my brain just starts to bleed and I gotta dc 
---
You deserve to get dc'ed on.
---
I’ve already got the leatherface
---
Buy the spirit DLC
---
NOED will be fair if the survivors get a indicator that its there and that dull totems still stand. This way we can know if our team already did it and we won't waste time breaking totems and not doing gens for no reason.
---
Jokes on you I always kill my self with the aoe before zombies can get me 
---
Strongest killer? get myers
---
When your not knowing if your teams helping you can be looking for a totem that's already gone. And if the killer didn't use NOED then all your time is gone
---
The Plague DLC. 
---
Will this apply for the new dlc too?
---
I like all 3 but get the Halloween chapter first.
---
As someone who was a killer stabbed i to like these changes.
---
A lot of killers will farm if someone dcs right away
---
Id rather be a killer. I would use something with deception and trickery.
---
As a Meg main with the same exact outfit, I approve. This is it chief 
---
As a mixed player with a bit more survivor now that we fixed the survivors mega perk we fix NOED. Just a indicator that its there and hoe many totems stand is fine
---
I actually meant resilience every time I said "this is not happening"
---
Well F if they have surveilance haha. 
---
I myself was Playing on Pc, idk if theres Cross Platform Gaming in r6? Might have been that Nea was on console, but the Rest of the Lobby was on PC :)
---
Get Plague tomorrow
---
If you want to be a dickhead, get legion. If you want to pratice tracking or anything of that sort, get spirit.
---
Bananana?
---
Myers
---
I mean I want a reason. Dont be rude bro 
---
Wasn't trying to be rude, it's just the simple answer. There are a lot of reasons for each killer but I don't want to go over every one, which in particular do you think are worse?
---
Your mask is way more yellow than mine does, mine has way too much emphasis on the dark lines particularly on the left cheek side. 
---
Look at all those chickens!
---
r/whoosh
---
Myers is so much fun get him you wont regrett it 
---
RUTHLESS KILLER
---
&gt; Freddy is comparably better than Clown, Trapper, Wraith, Legion and maybe even Pig (though I'm okay placing her higher) without perks/add-ons imo. You kinda have stuff built into his power, and except maybe Pig, the others are just way too shit without anything.
---
Holy shit someone with a brain in r/dbd
---
&gt; A freddy properly applying pressure slows the game down more than pig does as his slow down is easy to apply, has unlimited uses, and does not require downing someone to do so. Freddy's delay of game is better than Pig's without a doubt. Especially in the late game because his power is the only one that also makes the gates take longer to open without perks and can multiply its effectiveness with remember me.
---
Agreed with the first part, meh with the second. Freddys stall is good enough that you shouldnt be getting to the endgame.
---
I agree, but this is a sarcasm thread. No serious opinions allowed
---
Can't play without ruin on highrank, sad truth.
---
What happened?
---
I would rather die, who wants to complete 3 gen when all ur friends are dead.
---
Haunted ground and blood warden
---
Dead hard. He did have it, you saw him use it after he jumped through the window a bit earlier.
---
It also is the only option for that miss.
---
At first I was wondering if he got stuck on the pallet because none of us saw the killer for the whole game lol
---
News: Still no word on console optimization.
---
This is so funny and needs to be seen by everyone! Fuck console players. This is way more important!!!
---
that’s what you get for baiting a hatch standoff. 
---
Bad/Good spawn for him.. Purely good spawn for you :P
---
don’t bait a hatch standoff. deserved every second of that. 
---
There's something *fishy* going on here..
---
100% with you on this. 
---
Amd again, this is exactly why I get upset: a GOOD nurse does not miss just like a GOOD legion doesn't miss. Yes the Nurse stun is more punishing and even more iritating than the legion stun, but by increasing your FOV, you can continue tracking survivors. You are comparing a bad legion to a bad nurse and yes, of caurse legion has a bigger window of error, but once you're good at nurse, you'll always hit and the times that you do miss, it's not because the survivors juked you, it's because you missed yourself (or they just used an exhaustion perk). Same goes for legion, do you really think a good Legion main is going to miss 5 times in a row? The only difference is that dead hard doesn't work on legion. 
---
&gt;If you manage to waste his whole power somehow, then he simply waits a few seconds to get it back.
---
Same goes for nurse tbh
---
“A few more seconds” oh boy
---
“Just do totems” oh boy, and how will we know if they’ve all been done or not.. or spend the entire game cleansing them all only to find out the killer doesn’t have noed
---
I recommend you wait for the plague and see if you like her and if not then go with the myres and after that get freddy for the perks.
---
Yes but what is it that you are after though? :(
---
Single White Female
---
Thank you ;)
---
Thank you! :)
---
I haven't seen a doc in a while, actually don't mind facing him
---
When you get to player level 100, you get one devotion and get back to level 1, so for example level 268 = level 68 devotion 2
---
I swear to god there are still gonna be killers who will be instinctively dribbling the obsession haha.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49456/optimization-status-update-road-to-60fps
---
I got no idea mate, we will see today
---
Just give them a rope to escape through the gate ez
---
Oh ok, yeah I'm devotion 0...😁
---
Me
---
Yo if you go afk in games thats pretty aids
---
Because Devour Hope at 2 stacks doesn't affect the survivors, it effects the killer.
---
Huntress Lullaby **does** affect the survivors, however.
---
Oml, this is older then my grandma, can we stop using it?
---
No need to be sad with this. Everyone earned loads of BP making it a very active game with everyone taking part in the action throughout it all. It was likely a fun time for all as well, maybe a thriller round for those Survivors to boot if there was near misses, jukes, and what not.
---
These types of games tends to my favorite as well regardless of what the ranks were. So much fun for both sides with this kind of BP gains win or lose.
---
I listen to loud music while playing, so it's really a negligible affect for me.
---
What was that scream sound effect from? I’ve definitely heard it before. 
---
DbD isn't competitive. Anyone claiming so for grounds of balancing is holding the game to extremely unreasonable standards. It's like sending a high schooler's novel idea out to a Pulitzer ceremony.
---
WHATS UP WITH PEOPLE PUTTING PIG IVER CLOWN? , also wtf do you mean with making hillbilly best killer? Hes not even on same level as nurse
---
This fucking sub man.
---
Why do you call my gimmick build crap? Yes it's not meta, but I hate meta, the less perks in the meta, the better if you ask me. By no means will this perk be crap, it will actually be improved in some ways and will have interesting matchups. It's not because something isn't meta that it is bad. By that logic, only a handful of perks are not crap
---
Yes I did put legion at bottom can you read
---
I say we unban ochido and make him a fog whisperer. 
---
I can't 
---
Haha yeah it's one of my favorite perks
---
I think Adam's perks are kinda nice. They're all niche, but it's a good niche. Definitely better than most other survivors in terms of *all around* usefulness. Adam doesn't have a single perk I'd never use.
---
Some survivors stay to let the killer down them before they exit for extra points. Not all survivors stay to be arrogant. 
---
I think Adam needs to be higher. Also Bill, Jake,  need to be lower
---
I live for Susie fanart like this
---
Me and a friend had a game the other day where the 2 randoms didnt move after we loaded in. They both got caught and hooked. I went to unhook to realise they werent back and they just got hooked again....not fun when the entire game is 2v1. I thankfully got the hatch as the killer decided to camp my friends hook. But its so annoying and demoralising to be 2v1 in the first 2 minutes...
---
Sometimes you get hatchets, sometimes you get a Dwight. #huntressproblems
---
Yeah i find her easy mode,  and versing her isnt very enjoyable
---
No NOED, +respect
---
Hell no. Tapp yes. But Bill and Jake have perks that are meta essential in high ranks where audio  plays heavy role and tunnellers and campers are a plenty.
---
And Adam's perks are useless most of the time especially against skilled killers. 
---
look, if youre gonna keep messaging since youve clearly fallen in love with me, dont clutter the subreddit, private message me if you wanna keep spamming me even tho ive said goodbye
---
Why would I not respond but you respond to me???
---
been a while since i saw a p0 LF at rank 1, in fact i havent seen that since his release
---
Doctor main rise u..... *gets palletstunned* *UUEHHHHH*
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, Nurse's, and Dead Hard cause I just really don't wanna spend BP on David
---
You're using the clowns power wrong brother.
---
This is true! He was also created for the Chinese playerbase! Though, because it is ambiguous, and there is no place it's really stated, I suppose it's just speculation unless we get word from the Devs
---
I agree with all of your sentiments except Freddy being fine.
---
Nice play dude. can i get name of song pls
---
Yes, Legion seems to be really fun, but a lot of people are saying that he's bad. From what I read, he's only op when you build certain addons and play him in a different way.   
---
I found that if I play him as I'm supposed to, I don't do that well. I'm still tryng to figure out how much I like him, how I should play him and when I should use "mend". But I'm having fun in the process which IMO it's the important thing.
---
no, one of the devs confirmed that these hits won’t happen on survivor side when dedicated servers come out. on the killer side it probably won’t be too bad.
---
You're the one that needs the r/woosh
---
You're the one that needs the r/whoosh
---
I feel you with every bone I have. Urban Immersion claudettes are an auto-win for the killer because they never do gens and they bring him about 23424242342342 more minutes to finish the game. Heartbeat? -&gt; hide. Does get found? -&gt; run into someone with bond, then do nothing again. 
---
small game is only 12 meters, which is basicly nothing, and it requires running around the map fucking headless in hope it activates, it aint even a 100% counter. 
---
HOW DARE YOU SAY SOMETHING SO RIGHT?
---
There's this Korean player called "쫓아오지마세요" (or "jjot5", on twitch) who's Devotion 14. That's the highest I have personally seen.
---
TWENTY EIGHT STAB WOUNDS!!!
---
?? the exact same thing goes for you???? im just gonna block you now, bye boosted kate main
---
they didn’t say, just they think he needs a rework.
---
Not even a Kate main 
---
it barely does anything. the 12 meters are useless as heck (i have used it a shitton so i know). plus the totems you find with small game could have been found if you looked a bit around
---
Nope, it was a retired map offering. 
---
Thanks dude
---
I'm disconnecting my life
---
i think we did a pretty good job guys
---
Jake is my personal bias,I just love Iron Will too much lol
---
i know theres a ps4 player called TheShowStopper that has STUPIDLY high devotion, maybe message him asking what he has
---
if they did something about speed of the game and added a 2nd objective (which aint m1 simulator thanks), i would say the game is balanced, but rn survs can still do gens in no time with little to no stopping. 
---
Because they were useless I think
---
Cause you got an extra 0.0001%. Do you think that was worth it?
---
What's the point of common map offering if there's a high chance you won't even end up there? waste of BP.  
---
Waste not want not.
---
yeah i do this with hag when i play her, i p3'd her but i HATE to play her, i fnd her so unenjoyable, like all 110% speed killers
---
(Serious opinion)
---
I got a 4K and almost max points against a 4man SWF with 4 Decisives... As Freddy.
---
https://imgur.com/35jsiGd
---
This meg could have also just done a gen honestly. 
---
they werent, they increased the chances to be sent to a map, didnt guarantee, i remember them, i loved them
---
I don't care for him either lul.
---
thats not true, i remember using them back in 2017 and getting the map fairly often
---
If body blocking was bannable we would not have high rank survivors.
---
Body blocking is common and viable at high ranks.
---
Of course the one we see in the picture is a different type of blocking. 
---
I agree with literally all of this except for David. David should be 5th next to Meg. No mither sucks but DH (should) gets you a temporary 2nd chance and WGLF is always a solid choice and a lot of people think of it like this. I *could* have a 4th perk if I take off WGLF  but I like money.
---
Placebo? I dunno what to say.
---
???? is it better to have some shitty 50%increase in alturism? ive NEVER user a common bloodpoint offering and never will, i really miss the old offerings, they gave you a slightly or moderately better chance to get the map, and it was nice
---
He was arrested so I doubt he will respond.
---
"Feng move you're blocking my hatchets."
---
"Shoe best add on"
---
no, they were nice, and didnt increase with 0.0001%  theres no chance unless you show me 100% concrete proof
---
The tier list is about usefulness. 
---
It’s m1 time 
---
what? how do you know this? dm me
---
because they are dumb devs??? idk, i want them back, you prob didnt even play back then
---
Well if you don't believe me because you haven't encountered it I just wish you to never encounter it in the future too :) 
---
The Killer I find the most terrifying is actually Freddy. From past experience. I have actually had a dream where I felt pain. I'm not joking. Freddy slashed me in the arm and it fucking hurt. I didn't wake up instantly and I felt nothing when I woke up so it wasn't just me hurting myself in my sleep. I was fucking sweating after I woke up.
---
The one I'd befriend first is Ace. I don't like taking chances but Ace makes the chances more in our favor. I just like how cool he looks. And tbh I would try to seduce him from time to time (o\_&gt;o)
---
Never once has an 'elastic bug' been the reason I saw/caught a survivor.
---
First: You can rename it anything you want but its still bodyblocking. Its literally the definition.
---
Second: I was not even talking about hook. Pallets/doors/slow down killer, etc for injured or grabbed survivors is common. I do it too.
---
any ps4 player that played in 2017 and run into this will freak out, lol
---
Ok, which one, cause BL is very good, and so is Lithe, and SB is also very effective.
---
What? No I never said that. What I said was that DH is strongest when you know what to do when being chased
---
Hands where I can see them ! Stop it now !
---
How do we know she baited and the killer didn't just stand there to begin with? then she jumped down to see if she could take the hatch while she was locking the other way but the huntres was standing in the blocking spot makimg her unable to jump in and now unable to do gens.
---
&gt;  wait a minute afterwards
---
uhhh, that strategy just won't work....waiting? A minute?
---
Mhmm... 
---
I think it‘s better if the 3rd Surviver die, the last survivor has the oppurtunity to escape through the exit gates. This means that all end game perks are activated (Noed and the other Perks). Now the Survivor can try to open the exit gate and can try to escape. But this is only possible if the survivors has repaird 2 of 5 generators.
---
&gt; I'm waiting with interest to see if Make Your Choice enters the meta now.
---
How is it not already meta? It's a great perk, I use it often. We don't need an anti-tunelling perk to make it better lol...you are basically saying that you tunnel.
---
Your flair is PS4 god (boosted) I’m guessing you started with the free month right? THEY CLUTTERED THE WEB. Look at it like this. Let’s say there are 20 common offerings and 10 rare. I have a 2/3s chance of getting a common. *But* if I take out clutter I have bigger chance. Let’s say 5 of them are clutter. 15/10. I have a 3/5s chance of a common. The absence of an offering isn’t filled. The chances of a common have gone down since they took away that offering.
---
It was nice to have a 'chance' of going to the map but it's not nice to have a gurarranteed 50/75/100% more bp in altruism? Even 50% can end up being 4000bp which is more than cost of the offering itself. I use the brown map offerings on some of my survivors and it's garbage, most of the time they don't even send me to the requested map.  
---
IMO lithe is a worse exhaustion perk because you can still get hit. It’s not a long shot but I still think DH is a little better.
---
first of all, started in september 2017, secondly, removing the offering doesnt make it so HIGHER tier offering appear more, it just replaces them with other common ones, and those common ones are the really bad slightly increases bloodpoints. facts ben shapiro rekt
---
I like Piggy the most, but I've never played as Freddy.
---
Knowing what to do = good no? You make it sound like you need at least x hours of skill to use DH. DH was the first exhaustion perk I used. Fun fact I thought the exhaustion status effect slowed you down back then. I’m not smart.
---
they arent worth it, i would rather have a greater chance of having my favorite map then getting a couple extra thousand bp every game, 
---
Ok. Random question what and who do main? Just no. Why would they take them out of it didn’t change anything?! 
---
I'm with you on this. My favourite yet is Lithe + Dance with me + Q&amp;Q. Can't wait for Head on to try it with IW + Q&amp;Q + Dance with me
---
DH is countered by EXPOSED, decent killers that don't try to hit the first moment they get, even if I hit a bit early but after he clicks E I can still hit the surv with my lounge, the only killer I get reked by DH with is nurse and sometimes trapper (if they see the traps) but thats about it. 
---
i main Jake as surv, and as killer i play everyonhe since i ALMOST have all p3, and thats what im asking, WHY WOULD THEY, it got replaced with slight bp offerings, and i dont think its worth it, would rather have thr map offerings back, you see what i mean now?
---
Your game is awful, why does it take years to implement dedicated servers? Console optimization, fixing map sized hit boxes, Freddy Rework. And now matchmaking lol, pairing Rank 1 with 20's. Amazing work.
---
&gt;And if survivors does not have DS and you took Enduring and juggle you waste time too?
---
Grammar btw but if you just said that enduring slows you down then you don't know what enduring is. And also did you just say that you juggle when there's no DS? The whole point of juggling is to counter DS so why do you juggle when there is no DS?
---
I give advice i use and i don't say it on to much feelings. If a killer says to use a different perk if its not them just complaining about literally every survivor perk ever then i listen and if its actual good advice i take it. I dont just say "killer idea bad must stab" 
---
And also 2400 BP when i can get more from chasing or gens in that time... don't say we should do it for 600 BP each. Cleansing is a hassle because if your solo then you have no idea whether someone else is helping. Its so painful that if your not SWF then its just another part of the game that's just not fun AND if the killer didn't run NOED you ran through hell for no reason. That's why i just want the simple fix of a indicator of if the killer has NOED and if it over. Then we know when to stop running around and we won't waste time on a perk that the killer doesn't run NOED.
---
Also im seeing some salt about DS lol its getting nerfed you gotta find a new example
---
Please no. I liked the movies but holy shit is the leprechaun annoying 
---
yeah i would tunnel a shirtless david, i dont want that naked molerat lookin ass in my game, come at me with the downvotes LGBTQ+ :P
---
Now take off your shirt!
---
Get gud
---
Well DH is definitely not a useful perk if youre relying on it to gain 3 seconds of distance between you and a killer if youre going to get downed immediately after the killer. To use DH properly you should be keeping track of the killer and using it to dodge a lunge or a swing.
---
Bruh, don't even bring in my man Ben into this. Where are your facts? All you do is attack the guy. 
---
runs bad on ps4 pro as well. stable 12 fps
---
I didn't think about it like that, beauty is in the eye of the beholder!
---
And you deserve to be banned, if you can't handle your sensitive feelings little dcer.
---
I totally agree with this, to hell with the hatch. Its a get out of jail free card.
---
"FIND HELP" 👀
---
blur his name, this isnt ok
---
I legit JUST got out of a rancor game to see this 
---
I updated my flair see what I did there pulled a sneaky on ya! I'm just memeing honestly I dont mind being tunneled let's my friends who aren't as good at the game get practiced without worrying about the killer!
---
i guess, still, im sick of the "omg shirtless david makes me hard" posts
---
Don't sweat it... There's literally no reward to Devotion levels... Just shows who play a lot of fucking DbD lol. 
---
I bought the piggie and i absolutely love her, if you have bbq she gives you alot of points almost every game
---
the fact is, that they replaced the map offerings with shitty slight bloodpoint offerings, and thats bad
---
Oof I honestly didn't know they were still rampant tbh. OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE
---
every day those posts pop up, and as a straight boi it makes me feel sick xD
---
It's LIT!
---
Fucking lit
---
You're a monster!
---
A straight Male myself I get it, shirtless dude meh but look at the red pants my dood and the shit eating grin too
---
It’s ok this dude has commented the same thing multiple times. He thinks he’s cool
---
Very interesting and creative perks! I love the idea of the first and second one. But why would Crafty make you exhausted if you can only use it once per match?
---
yeah but i will never betray my boy Cowboy Jake
---
DH doesn't save you a lot of times, it is also very easy to counter. Lithe and other exhaustion perks are just bad timings.
---
15-20 go together a lot, you were the only outlier and you were in a swf which is why you got pulled in. 
---
Depends on rank, he is a noob stomper in lower ranks, but can be rough at higher ranks.
---
Its nice at first. People usually don't run until you sleep them and by the time they are in the dream world you give them a hit. The only bad thing is if you don't put down map pressure they usually can walk right though you out of the exit gates unless you can activate blood warden. 
---
I have the same face as Quinton irl so it's personal
---
Well I think they will buff her
---
**reeee hatch standoff :((((**
---
well, the higher ranks are 90% boosted urban noobs, even if i verse good survs i can mindgame my way to a 2k, sometimes 1k with loads of hooks, i got alot of playtime, and i started in 2017 so i had to get used to vacuum pallets, when 2.0 came out i had a cakewalk in most games
---
A fellow man of culture. Jake and David are both survivors I'd want in my trial if I ever got pulled in tbh and some of that sweet new survivor to round out the team 
---
Freddy doesn't need to chase you. Freddy needs to put people asleep to gain map pressure and abuse moments where survivor's aren't safe at jungle-gyms or similar tiles. You can't be at safe tiles at all times. You need to come in the open at some point. Freddy will be coming for your ass. 
---
i 100% agree, fuck these other commenters, they are those immersed twats lmao
---
Ok but like how many times do you get the exposed effect besides noed? Exactly. When gens are done I don’t heal. If noed procs I start injured. Otherwise I heal. Just don’t be shit lol. All you have to do is look behind you, judge distance, and like nothing else.
---
LOL THIS IS SO TRUE
---
If I may give my hot take in this:
---
Huntress for me isn't scary. Especially the one where she sounds like a spoilt little girl having a temper tantrum. You all know the one. That is adorable for.
---
Trapper, Myers and Billy are kinda intimidating but my only problem with Trapper is that he sounds like when my Skyrim character dies for one of them.
---
And I've been seeing this in the comment section. Yes. Frank/Joe sound like they stub their toe or step on a LEGO brick.
---
inb4 "omg this is so racist" comments,lmao, i think the post is funny, nice one op
---
yeah kinda ironic huh?
---
Ascension has been complete. All you do now is run No Mither, fuck up your DH, dc, and complain that Shirtless Myers is overrated.
---
I still don't understand how my Deranged Pursuit doesn't even have 1/25, I've played loads of Legion JUST for that achievement, and it just doesn't work, omega oof
---
yeah, i use p3 to flex, :P
---
You realize she can do gens and leave through the gates right?
---
That's not taking the game hostage.
---
But you know what it does include? No Mither. That automatically makes David King trash tier (in this list anyways)
---
Just for the record, the fan art is amazing. Always love to see a good Spirit fan art. Well done!
---
name checks out
---
But he isn’t. 2/3 is better than 0/3.
---
Do they not understand that they are the ones that lost
---
I mean when they say silly stuff like this you would think that they are being cocky that they won yet they act like they didn’t lose do they not have a brain
---
"LAUGH THROUGH THE PAIN JEFFERY! LAUGH THROUGH THE PAIN!"
---
Autohaven, Coldwind, mac millan estate, red Forrest. All of these maps have a lack of windows at least on a lot of parts, or they have windows, but are not safe to use. Why even use DH when you could just use SB which always gives you extra distance, instead of having to be injured?
---
I can understand that :)
---
After all, dedicated servers may (for many) eliminate the possibility of red ping matches, but may also dl the same for green ping matches.
---
Alright. Thanks for wasting two minutes of your time. Only two people on gens while I run my first chase.   :)
---
make pp big hard
---
Of course, I love doing tier 1 Myers there. I normally do my gen protector builds on the game.
---
Well I rather not walk everywhere. Replace that with BL, Adrenaline, or Lithe. Honestly I just prefer DH.
---
I love this format, first time seeing it.
---
Yeah sure that is up to you what you use. But what I'm saying is that Dead hard is objectively worse than other Exhaustion perks. Another thing that i hate, is is suppose to be a rugby tackle, but we use DH to dodge the killer, nani?
---
idc, i got em all, just use them for bp
---
Jokes aside, this legion cosplay looks great.
---
I legit bought the outfit put on no mither ded ard wglf, got adept while carrying my friends against a super sweaty Myers! Scratched mirror had my team all messed up (they are very new btw) was funny to watch em get scared even after I explained the scratches mirror! 
---
I mean even David isn’t dumb enough to try and tackle an ancient Babylonian woman oozing vomit.
---
I see it when I'm on the hook. Meg's hair whips around like a scorpion's tail and Feng becomes Fillia. Never have I seen it as killer, though.
---
He should tho, he a badass
---
To be fair, they were in Gideon with 3 people to start. Legion was probably just the tipping point here. 
---
The point of the video is that OP can’t get out of that area, they’re being completely blocked by the killer who is thus holding the game hostage, a completely bannable offense.
---
it doesnt work
---
This guy gets it!
---
Very nice! Next 👏 meme 👏
---
Only missing deranged pursuit. Need a fist full of Frank's mixtape to get it I think
---
I think it is too general. We see this on everyday movies...
---
PC's aren't out of your reach, dream bigger, reach higher, game harder.
---
*-and if you look to your left, you will see a full grown man shamelessly and not ironically wearing a FNaF shirt.*
---
I would look the other is they aren't the obsession
---
This is actually amazing. Weird, but amazing.
---
i feel ya on the waiting issue. it's just that this happened in 90% of my games and i felt guilty that i was just shitting on newbs. 
---
i would prefer to go against t-bagging and decent survivors bc it's more of a challenge and i just like laughing at it. 
---
When no other argument go grammar nazi!
---
Outside of obsession atm you can't know if other players do or do not use DS if you have to carry them certain distance to hooks ,(some spent, downed in corner etc) you can juggle them when close enough "just to be safe"
---
Totems are there to slow progress down and alleviate gen rush also we got stuck with Hex perks to balance it out. If you do not feel rewarded enough for doing your job well bitch about that maybe?!? They should increase BP reward for cleansing dull totems 
---
I give DS as example as long as it is on live servers as you have to deal with that shit now. When new patch drops I will drop DS ...
---
But you gotta admit, there's always something tempting about what you can't have 
---
Agree
---
Yeah I guess you're right. I just think Michael's instakill ability is better from my experience. But yeah Billy is really good. 
---
I played hell out of billy and i had 3 ebony mori games, today i log back in to see that somehow my progress got reseted and now im back at 3 ebony im happy
---
I feel you man i feel you
---
That's EXACTLY what I think.
---
Legion should be in a lower tier. The shape should be in B tier and Billy in A. 
---
The Shape isn't that difficult to deal with as a survivor if you just avoid his stalkong ability.
---
*zap*
---
Legion is either Freddy or nurse tier depending on add-ons so I'd say put them in China and not A.
---
Also Amanda is not D teir, maybe C without addons, but with she's B-A(definetely not biased)
---
Billy is always with or just below nurse, he stronk boi
---
Hag should be A tier or at least B tier, she is really good since her buff
---
what perk or perks are your favorite from Dwight? 
---
Yes and no. It also punishes survivors for not being diligent. It's the anti gen rush perk. If you see a totem you NEED to cleanse it. I do agree that is a crutch perk though(I don't hate it much though as it is easy to counter). Also I way it's fair game for a gimmick build(especially end game) since there arnt usually enough perks to pick from.
---
Wait, 5% MS boost *baseline* as in you don't need to hook someone for it to take affect?
---
This is mostly based on opinion and experience and is a bit biased but I see where you're coming from. For me Pig and Billy never work out tbh. 
---
Myers over Billy? Big yikes
---
I once had a killer disconnect because I burned Lery's offering.
---
Sorry not sorry. I like that map. And with BL I can run the killer around there. 
---
I was also lucky that killer DC because he burned a Mori offering. Okay, it could have been Shroud of separation but I'd rather not experience it first hand. 
---
It's mostly bias and my own experience
---
yep, pretty much
---
Ah yeah that makes sense. I thought Huntress was booty until I put some work into her and now she is pretty good imo
---
I mean sure NOED can feel like a cheap way to win, especially if all 4 survivors are alive till the end and all and the killers isn't that good or being out skilled and then BOOM all 4 die thx to NOED. But think of it this way, a survivor is on a gen ,doing it ASAP and once it is done they run over to another gen, and they spot a totem, if the survivor doesn't cleanse the totem it is their fault that NOED is activated, you cannot blame the killer for using NOED if you are letting it activate. Your bacilly giving the killer a bullet and then being mad because they brought a gun. Just like DS, NOED can be abused by bad players to make up for the lack of skill. As of the current state of the game, gems are being done to fast, perks like ruin doesn’t buy you a lot of time. So what is a good solution to a group of players doing the objective ASAP and getting out. *Spoiler alert*, it’s NOED. I don’t get how survivors can get mad at the killer for using a perk that they can just disable. If there is even the slightest chance that the killer might have NOED why are you not cleansing totems? NOED isn’t a baby perk, ofc weaker players can use it. In reality the survivors are the babies, not cleansing totems. THis is the main thing with NOED, survivors have a very easy way of not getting fucked over by it. If the killer runs NOED and gets you, it is not his fault, it is your fault cause you are the baby survivor.
---
God i bet the Huntress really enjoyed prolonging the map for so long for a chance at 3000 more points am instead of actual being a decent person and just hitting you and letting you go.
---
I’d rather do this and commit a bannable offense than move on and complete a different match for more points.
---
the little big planet faceplant thing omg 💀
---
Kind of like Cabin in the Woods?
---
I could go for that. Especially if they could get a Michael/Freddy crossover.
---
She is but for some reason I always do better with Clown. Thank you for understanding btw. 
---
Did you even watch the video? 
---
Do you know the windstorm wraith gets while uncloaking? Any good pig killer knows that she has the same thing, only opposite. 
---
You can use the crouch dash to save a second or 2 of chase, every hit. You just get to the right distance, and do a quick crouch and dash, and get the hit earlier than an ordinary M1.
---
Also, if played right, you can all but guarantee a kill with reverse bear traps, and you don't have to waste much time following the victim. At least 1 every game.
---
There are deeper understandings that most don't get about some killers, like trapper, pig, clown, and Freddy. 
---
Well Tamar, have you watched the clip?
---
If he loses it's every other people's fault but his
---
Oh yeah no I feel Clown is much more rare so people don't get to practice against him. So I definitely understand his placement. And of course :D We are all fellow players, regardless of opinion.
---
someone tunneled and facecamped me because i was a shirtless david 😔
---
I firmly believe Myers is A tier. In the right hands, assured destruction of the survivors team. It’s all about timing your T3 though, so I can see how certain people may not see it that way. 
---
proberby because they didn't want to clutter the bloodwebs
---
Yeah
---
I'd move Tapp up one, Detective's helps with totem hunts and finding gens, Stake Out if you're having Ruin difficulties or speeds up normal gens/healing, and Tenacity can mess up killers if they leave you on the ground for even a second.
---
It’s just the way he does basic killer plays and calls them 200 iq is too cocky
---
Empathy, Botany Knowledge, and Self-care are always useful? I like self care less now that all it does is distract from objectives or chases.
---
The thing is that totems aren’t always easy to find, especially on the game or lery’s
---
Yep, hate that map as billy. Vault master Myer however...now that is a different story &gt;:D
---
Maybe he just got two greens 
---
Based on the title I think that this is what happened. However I am not sure if it really is the killers fault in this scenario. For all we know the killer could have just blocked the hatch: Not very nice but still completely legit. After that the killer got afk: Still not a good way to handle a hatchblock but still not against the rules. (And I really think that the killer was afk before Meg got there, based on the direction she is looking at). So if Meg jumped down after the killer already was afk it really isnt the huntress who is at fault here. However: If the huntress wasnt afk then she really hold the game hostage. 
---
Nope i think you just have no comback. I made my points but where are yours? Also for the record i could give a rat ass about downvotes. I say how i feel popular opinion or not. If i really cared about my vital internet points id stroke BHVR all day like some of the shills on this sub and repost shit memes all day. 🤔
---
PUT A GOD DAMN ‘PING LIMIT’ IN SETTINGS, BHVR, ITS NOT HARD! Then this new match making will be good. 
---
Quality over Quantity.
---
sincerely, the entire Oceanic region
---
I can’t believe it isn’t utilized more.  The way survivors insist on dicking around begs for it.
---
Ok, so it becomes a map problem and not a NOED problem. NOED is a good perk, it can be a crutch, but in a meta that revolves around doing gens ASAP and getting out NOED is the perfect counter, it counters careless survivors. 
---
It makes up for it by allowing us to purchase all unlicensed characters for free.
---
Of course, people still fork out the $11, but that just helps the game's funding even more.
---
they're the only survivors worth P3'ing now that cosmetics are a major part of DBD.
---
I like my P3 Laurie, but it seems like on of the most dodged cosmetics in the game.
---
For a second plus he's just way easier to play 
---
Can't wait for fair killers to have fair games and scumbag killers who tunnel get rekt?Yes.
---
⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆
---
This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.
---
Be careful, friends!
---
Double calm doc with M&amp;A, makes it more fun for both sides
---
Then we would have threads like:
---
*"Its been over 1 hour and the in-game hud still says looking for a lobby", fix it BHVR.*. 
---
If you are getting multiple high pig lobbies it probably means there aren't many killers in your region at the moment (or survivors).

---
We go the same shit on PC. That window along with the schoolbus window is fucked
---
im sorry but you are brain dead 
---
No problem. Obviously I meant that I will sit in a locker if the killer enters chase with someone else. I would of course *not* move to an unlocked gen in that case.
---
Looks like my sister 🤢🤮
---
That about sums it up. Maining leads to bias.. most of the time anyway. 
---
This needs more upvotes
---
300% canon 
---
that's not holding the game hostage, she can do gens and open the doors. 
---
holding the game hostage is trapping someone in basement or in a corner where they can't do ANYTHING to progress the game. 
---
Problem is people can’t seem to understand that simply because Freddy is the worst killer, he isn’t a bad killer. All killers are viable currently, he just happens to be at the bottom of the chain. 
---
If I remember right they were actually 100% if no other offerings were used. Idk if it was a bug or not but I definitely recall almost always getting the map I brought even if only having a slight chance.
---
I agree, he does have decent map pressure. But you aren't going to win by just halting people for a minute. Especially if there's a swf. They'll find each other and wake them up while you're trying to chase somebody. You can't win by constantly putting people to sleep. You NEED to chase them. Nurse is super strong because she can counter pallets, windows, loops. She can down someone, hook them then go baxk and down another survivor so someone is always on the hook. Unless they're bad survivors freddy can't do that. You'll be constantly chasing survivors through loops and often have other survivors wake up while you're chasing somebody.
---
100% chance unless someone else brings an offering*
---
No you have to stay atleast 80 meters away from hooked survivors at all times or else you're proxy camping. If they get unhooked, you have to pretend they don't exist and chase a healthy survivor instead or you're tunneling. You also can't kick any of the final 3 generators or else you're gen camping.
---
Then at the end of the game, you have to stand at the gate and let them blind you for extra points or else you're ruining their experience.
---
Tapp has some nice customization tho
---
WIth theguy who keeps writing about the monsters, I forgot his name. I want to see him as a survivor and later a killer
---
That just took 5 years off my lifespan.
---
Thanks.
---
for me if dedicated server dont fix the hitboxes then I will keep complaining about it
---
I've been doing a meme with Quentin where I've been collecting green medkits. Only green medkits. 
---
Find a purple flashlight in the bloodweb? Drop it in the next trial you ain't need that trash.
---
Running perks to make my medkit last as long as I can, pharmacy, botany, self care, ace in the hole.
---
Been updating my username for every medkit I successfully save. So far I'm at 88 green medkits with no other items.
---
ooof
---
why?
---
i bought the pants at forever 21 and put the laces on the pockets myself, the belt i just got at a party city, the hoodie was from old navy, and the jacket i just had lying around. i weathered them accordingly with the help of frank’s model up in SFM.
---
If they have a beanie they're 100% playable in my book
---
...Okay, so your position all killers are in fact "viable" because your operational definition of viable is completely fucking incoherent and you question whether the concept of viability is valid? Why did you even make a list of "viable" killers that includes everyone except leatherface, legion, trapper and freddy? Why are you like this?
---
Yeah i kind of agree with that but the NOED does need some changes. Like not speed boost AND instadown but just 1 of them. But to balance it we would have to change adrenaline aswell to give only either a sprint burst or heal 1 health state
---
be a good killer and give up your evil ways....Doesn't seem to go well together xD
---
Your job is in the name, you kill
---
PGTW I did miss. I actually like that perk. Overcharge....I can’t defend as good but you still correct. Also a grill build of gen stopping would be stuff we already have. PGTW, Ruin, Surveillance, And Lullaby/Overcharge. 
---
Dark Devotiom’s short but powerful effect is going to be its downfall from good to amazing. Like a killer like Hag or Trapper or Amanda May love this but everyone else really has no early game issues for gaining a lead. Gen Halting builds have been a thing so idk why the person I replied to first is so worried as if 100% of people are going to be running DD like it’s a better Ruin. 
---
Yes and no.  I've put enough hours into Freddy that I honestly think he's better than Wraith, Trapper, Clown, and Doctor.  But "tier lists" are subjective anyway.
---
Hag should be much higher. Once she has momentum you're not getting it back and she's one of the few killers that can work on practically any map. Shape should be lower. Yeah he has stealth and an instadown, but he's a basic M1 killer with little map presence and stalling while still being very much loopable.
---
Ruin.. Played for 3 months last summer before quitting, but I never saw ruin. Might even get Hag soon if I don't see ruin soon. Not tryharding for high ranks yet though. 
---
I facecamp, tunnel, humiliate and I'm proud.
---
"This perk is useless."
---
"It's not useless, I use it in my gimmick build!"
---
"Your gimmick build is useless."
---
"We shouldn't judge perks on whether or not they're useful."
---
"..."
---
Idk what you do to your PS4 but mine runs pretty well up until I get someone with a potato connection. Even then, since I've started I have had to play at 200 ping and it honestly doesn't seem to affect the game much since the killer has shit connection too, so it's either just complaining about a flaw for the sake of it or your PS4 is junk
---
The most disturbing killer to me is (by gameplay) Myers since I'm EXTREMELY paranoid.
---
The most disturbing killer by lore and backstory is probably going to go to Clown. Clowns are most of the time terrifying and his backstory of just keeping a dead bird because he liked it. Kidnapping and murdering a kid just because (forgive me lore enthusiasts. I don't remember clowns lore 100%)
---
If I saw that bitch I swear I would disappear like Claudette into the fog
---
So many people saying the Killer should get reported... to me it looks like: Huntress found the hatch, stood on it and wen AFK... not her fault that the Meg jumped down into a pit and got stuck...
---
I just started playing, I didn't know
---
I just started playing, I didn't know. And I did do a search on the reddit for it and I didn't see anything so I that's why I posted it
---
This is why it's amazing on myers.
---
Why is the plague like 98% mouth
---
But that's why freddy needs to prioritize pretty much **everything** above chasing someone. Wasting time in a chase is the worst thing freddy can do, the only thing he needs to do is rid survivors of pallets and waste their time. If someone got lucky with a skillcheck, go over there and sleep them again (and punish bad/risky positioning), chances are the odds will not be on their side again. Ofc if you can hit someone, go for it. But as soon as you can tell that a survivor feels safe next to a thousand loops, leave them be. Next time when you ambush that person, come from the direction he would be the safest to run to. 
---
Also a freddy should always notice when survivors wake each other up, which usually means that he will get to put both of them to sleep, unless they are AMAZING at stealthing against someone who's invisible. 
---
I think that's a fair trade as adrenaline is probably one of the best if not the best survivor perk. Adrenaline also wakes you up against Freddy as well it's super frustrating lol
---
Neither. Survivor does his job, which is getting away from the killer. He does what needs to be done. And you decided that you wanted him gone cause he triggered you, thus throwing the game but finding peace in killing him. I honestly think that nobody is evil here. Besides it's good practise as killer and survivor
---
*Mission failed, we'll get it next time*
---
the idea of it changing locations is really good! 
---
No.
---
"The hug".
---
Though I guess that describes what I'd want to give her if she wouldn't stab me and eat my innards.
---
I just farmed for it. Saves yourself and the survivors from playing legion
---
I know exactly what youre talking about, I usually stream killer and face some major dickhead streamers, I always drop them a follow after the game cuz I know it can be hard to get any kind of following but they usually see the follow as some sort of bm and will say shit like "I bet you streamed sniped, you're garbage", like holy shit man, I just wanted to help you out. Calm the fuck down
---
Yeah he was a pedophile and rapist too! Or at least heavily implied
---
I want to give her a hug too lol I’ll change that real quick. 
---
If the reason you want to be nicer is to avoid the complaining in post game chat, go ahead and give up on that dream now. They will always complain.
---
IIRC its a movespeed after you hook survivor for a limited time. Its not just "lmao have free 5% movespeed, so that combined with next stage of H:DH you can M1 people while moving at 120% ms"
---
Ok, thanks for your help.
---
20 games of dwight, while locker hermiting should do it. If that dosent work in 3 weeks come see me again.
---
Looks great. $40 seems about right. Can't really hold it against people who think $40 is too much. It took me awhile to actually get a sense of what handcrafted work and machine crafted work should go for and the labor that is put into each. Some people see these and just think it's small so it'll be cheap
---
Killers go through windows slower, it creates distance between you both. You just vault at the wrong time or or not do it as fas enough like if you run straight at it, you fly over it, if you go at it from an angle, you will like climb over it, which makes it easier for us to hit you :O
---
If you keep getting hit you need to analyze why you got hit :) trial and error!
---
Thanks a lot! I'll tell my friend to get him to play some more Dwight.
---
Best skin.
---
Also pls delete Claudette.
---
Not out today?
---
Trapper. He always kills me, the traps terrify me, it's ugh. Also Spirit
---
Every fucking time, A survivor will run past me as I'm cleansing a hex totem and transfers the killer agro onto me. I get hooked and no one comes for me
---
It feels so good to have them all done. The last one for me was where did they go?!? Which i actually got from a legit solo queue game. Hoping this next chapter's achievements aren't ridiculous like legions
---
This.
---
No news from BHVR, so most likely will be Thursday
---
After rank reset I wanted to try killers I hadn't played before. I played my first game as Billy ever, and I got The Game. Guess I'm going to just left click the whole game :(
---
The more I've been doing it, the more I disliked it. Now when people would message me for a swf, I wouldn't joina voice chat. Apart from being fair towards the killer, it also stays fun for me. I don't like it when there's no more surprise factor cause your team lets you know
---
Oh boy. I definitely did not remember that part. That's a whole new level of disturbing.
---
My first kill (I play survivor 99.5% of the time and started last week) was a guy at the exit pointing and beckoning. I just wanted the game to end and wouldn’t chase him. I knew he’d just double back and get by me since I really am a terrible rank 20 level one killer. 
---
Anyway, he finally got in my face and I slashed him. He still acted the same way. I let him hobble past me not moving, then slashed him in the back. He fell and started crawling to the exit. I picked him up and carried him to the exit like I was going to drop him. I turned around and found the nearest hook. He died instantly via entity since everyone else had escaped. Not an amazing feat for my first kill, but I felt he deserved it for being so cocky. Plus he looked like a guy I don’t like IRL.  
---
But, if the girl in the vid did nothing annoying, I feel a bit bad for her. However, if it was me who got hooked instead of hatched, I’d feel sad a moment then laugh it off; it’s not that serious! Plus when killers hatch me, I feel like a loser still since it was only their mercy that let me survive.
---
Btw., ingame you can just press escape and see the offerings used.
---
Our fellow killer is maturing &lt;3

I mean all you need to do is be an immersive gamer or leave early.
---
Aww that’s sweet, also thank you!
---
Are you on PC? Or is this just based on the potential of the basic killer and their basic power? Just asking cause on ps4 nurses are pretty bad (I've honestly never seen a good nurse on PS4) but YouTubers and many others on PC pretty much accept their fate when they go against one. rest of the list seems alright if you take into account a couple things 
---
1: survivors aren't playing immersed 
---
2: survivors actually know how to run a killer around
---
I say this because I know wraiths are pretty hard to go against for play styles that rely on hiding from the killer rather than being able to loop them

If you're saying it's fine because it has gone trough a lot of changes, then I'd have to disagree.
---
The survivors need to go out of their way too much just to avoid this one perk while the killer doesn't really have to do anything to get use out of it.
---
&gt;I run small game and literally never have it go off on me. 
---
I run small game often as well, and it also never goes off but not because I managed to destroy all totems, it doesn't go off because it never gets to end game since I play solo and gens don't seem to get done
---
&gt;If i go solo sometines i might not get that last one
---
This is a litteral contradiction to what you just said
---
&gt;but who cares?
---
Pretty sure that she survivor that was being chased by the killer who caught up because of a sudden 5% increase in movement speed and an insta down cares
---
&gt;A lot of times i think it's a lot more exciting to rush to get out because there is a possibility of getting insta killed.
---
I do agree with this, but one perk this powerful that requires no effort on the killers side to activate, but a lot of effort on the survivor side to activate just isn't balanced. Either force the killer to earn it, give it a nerf or make it an active game mechanic.
---
&gt;If i go solo sometines i might not get that last one but who cares?
---
I'd also like to bring up that this is the problem I was proposing to kind of fix. If you let survivors know how many totems are left, then solo survivors come closer to the potential of a SWF when it comes to getting rid of this perk
---
Yeah, you can get multiples. Here's the scenario: 
---
You need at least two survivors. Frank's mixtape is a big help as well. Get the two survivors to go to a hook with you (just signify "it's my turn to hook you guys" in the farming session). Frenzy hit one survivor twice, so they are one hit from down (if you have Frank's). Frenzy hit the other survivor then hit the original one to down him. Hook the downed survivor. Frenzy hit the 2nd survivor again, bringing them to one hit away from being downed. They will go for the unhook. Once survivor #1 is unhooked, frenzy hit him then frenzy down survivor #2. Hook survivor #2 and repeat the process with survivor #1. 
---
Once they've both been hooked twice, you can carry on this method by just letting them heal the downed survivor, it just takes a bit longer. If all survivors cooperate with you, you can get the achievement in about 2 games
---
Mcote usually messages me the day before
---
unless you can provide proof that they do not have dedicated network programming team the guy who you replied to has more probable answer, so there really is no need for a comeback. Noone provided proof for their statement, but his is based on knowledge of how programming works and how it's done in companies that deal in the industry, yours is based on criticism of the bugs and 'doubt' that they have a team big enough for that since the gameplay programming team is failing on some things. Faults of the gameplay programming team do not indicate that network programming team does not exist.
---
I'm not gonna argue further on this thread tho as you do not strike me as a person that is willing to change his views even when provided with new information (in this case, description of the structure of game development programming teams) so there is really no point. Also, you salty AF man and that does not fare well for a civilized discussion
---
Feels really hard to initiate a farm with people who understand the mechanic. They usually just heal the other person straight away
---
Hahaha, I realise you've seen the video

---
he is easy to win on ps4
---
Sumerian Twitter said they would be getting the DLC yesterday
---
Damn gay ada player
---
How do you feel about a giant pizza cutter for the mascot
---
Cool idea but how would you implement the ‘headstart’? I think hatch stand-offs are hardly the biggest issue in the game right now but honestly, as a rough idea this sounds alright. It’s unlikely to ever get implemented though because many survivor mains will be annoyed, especially so soon after DS has been changed
---
Why balance landing and dead hard? That's kind of a waste.
---
This was changed awhile ago actually 
---
😂  “Teamwork? I don’t think so!”
---
The 75% stagger reduction from falls during a chase can make a huge difference when exhausted. I don’t usually run this combo however it’s always worked in my favor when looping a killer. 
---
I only became aware of this recently, was it in any patch notes ?
---
damn, u rite idk [what i was thinking](https://i.gyazo.com/8fb9e8a8e63742e7a1b43debbfadc547.png)
---
Fair enough, in maps like Assylum and Coldwind Farm stagger reduction can make the difference, I agree. Good point.
---
Yes I believe it was. Don't remember exactly which patch but I think it was Legion...I only remember because I had 25/100 and one day when I got on the game it just automatically popped. 
---
Fellow Quentin main, gotta protect my son at all costs 
---
Toxicity usually means you did well or they were annoyed by you so that’s a personal well done I think
---
Ugh I had to do this the long way on ps4
---
Exactly. And saboteur can be extremely powerful if used right (Saboing hooks infront of killers carrying survivors) but no one really does that anymore. 
---
Whyyy so vague :(
---
Why did this come up when I sorted by controversial? Keep up the good work, always great to see fan art
---
I love all of them,but Bond is a personal favourite. I just find the information it can give you to be so useful in game
---
Thanks!
---
Just checked, I unlocked it January 22nd. So whatever patch was around then. 
---
Thanks! Appreciate it!
---
Thank you!
---
First off my tiers don't go in any certain order.
---
I feel like Nurse should be in her own tier, but there is no S+ tier, and I think Billy is still 2nd best in the game, therefore deserves the S tier.
---
I too main Spirit, she's fun to play and deadly too, I don't want to go in depth with add-ons because the tier list is solely without add-ons. I still think she needs a lot more skill to do well unlike Billy, which is easy to learn and not too hard to master. That's why I think she is a bit worse than Billy. 
---
I think Huntress is a really good killer, but takes some skill to work and knowing hatchet patterns etc. so she is at A, she is well balanced but still one of the best.
---
At regards with Hag I explained why she's here in my list, good players can easily counter her by just knowing how to move and where. She has good map control so she might go one tier up, she's kind of a middle man between the tiers imo.
---
Another user also changed my mind about Clown by having some good counter arguments so I do think he is a B class as of now.
---
I feel Pig is C because her power doesn't help with map control, chases or putting pressure on. It only prolongs time, and her dash doesn't help much since most good players will know how to counter and look out for her once they know it's Pig.
---
Legion is very controversial, while they are an annoying killer, they aren't really that good, don't want to get a lot into that because people like to get tilted about it.
---
All points you brought up on Doctor I feel the same about.
---
Wraith I think is F class just because compared to all other killers, hes pretty much shit. He has counters, and his cloak really doesn't offput any better players. Easy burns, pallet stuns, sprint burst which most people use completely counters his whole ability, spine chill is very potent against him. There's just so many counters and his chase potential is bad, he may be fast while cloaked but so can Spirit, Billy, Nurse. Hell even Legion is fast in Frenzy. He's one of the worst and that's why I put him all the way down. 
---
Tbh you have some really nice arguments and it's really nice to just have a discussion without being toxic, throwing out names and what not. I'd love to hear your opinion on my counter arguments :)
---
Tbf there's no way to hear anything over the chase music depending on which one you get. I always hate when I am running to a loop after either exhausting a window or using a pallet and I hear a gen at another loop almost done. Makes me think people are sandbagging when they do it to me but then I remember I always accidentally do it.
---
It doesn't matter if you spin the stick like a madman or just very slowly rotate it, it goes the same speed.
---
safety first kids!
---
Lmao this was my favorite episode 
---
That's just how the most evolved of us look. Sleep is a waste of time right?
---
Self-care can be time consuming yes but dont forget its still the most used survivor perk and the most useful one i'd say. It lasts you all game long and it doesnt really come with any risks to running it.
---
Yep I'm on PC and I'm talking good players going up against each other, good survs vs good killer. :)
---
Some say the game is still going on to this day.
---
I think they have always released DLC on thursdays.
---
I'm literally on reddit in bed rn. Who needs sleep?idoactuallywhydoipunishmyselfso
---
Chris Hansen would like to have a word with clown
---
I'd assume license killers would be too expensive for a b movie.
---
Otherwise there needs to be a shirtless myers vs shirtless david stand off at some point
---
Every time my stack complains about a useless teammate urban evading around the map, hiding in lockers for extended periods of time etc, we all get sacrificed and they get handed the hatch at the end. Without fail.
---
I actually agree. Ive been putting a lot of time into him lately and he's really fun and can be really strong if you play him right. The main problem with him is that he gets absolutely wrecked by swf teams. He's strong when you can keep multiple people in dream world for a decent amount of time because the survivors cant easily find each other. But if they are immediately able to run directly to a buddy to snap out of it, he just can't do shit about it.
---
He's also super dependent on good add-ons and perks, although I feel like he's got some best add-ons in the game. Class photo is amazing.
---
I think it's a reward from getting prestige 3, the way the killer is standing 
---
I always max out hags devious UwU
---
:D
---
&gt; The carrying bug
---
That, the killer flexing/bragging about the fact he's rank 1 even though nobody cares or asked
---
Cries in basement.
---
Lmao. As a killer main, I will avoid the last hook if one of their teammates are nearby. I suck at survivor and know how it feels to die early lol.
---
If you’re basing whether a killer will have NOED or not based off of how strong a killers kit is then why is it a crutch for LF? He’s in the running for worst killer. That and spirit is widely considered the second best killer, so why would she not fall under having NOED as a crutch?
---
New dlcs comes out today?
---
Plague's projectiles can injure at base if she gets enough on you and corrupt purge acts like a short range hatchet. While Clown can only down if he has the finger add on and hits you with the bottle.
---
Tapp is the male Claudette without cosmetics but what Claudette you know uses anything but P3?
---
What? There are EMOTES in DbD now?!?! Man I'm so old
---
Shit happens yo. People gotta die :(
---
I get to reversed. Someone saves me from hook, has we'll make it, killer is chasing someone others. Rather than fast healing me runs away. Why using that perk when not using?
---
Any of Legion or Jeff's so that I can more efficiently spend shards for bloodpoints to spend on Plague and Jane.
---
Hello someone from Discord
---
Don't forget your M&amp;A!
---
Well cosmetics were always a thing the 80’s suitcase and the bloodstained sack and what not
---
Please don't change my words to take me out of context.
---
&gt;Emasraw: "This perk is useless."
---
This is the only accurate part
---
&gt;BobTheBox: "It's not useless, I use it in my gimmick build!"
---
Pretty sure my original words were "I love the decisive strike change to be honest, I'm a fan of gimmicky builds and the new decisive strike will fit right in" or at least not far off and it has the same context
---
&gt;Me: "Your gimmick build is useless."
---
You said it was objectively crap, but sure, same thing
---
&gt;BobTheBox: "We shouldn't judge perks on whether or not they're useful."
---
And this is the most out of context you could take me. These don't resemble my words at all. Pretty sure I originally said something along the lines of "it's not because something isn't meta, that it is a useless perk"
---
You want as many perks between useless and meta. Meta means that it's always a strong pick, regardless of killer, the perks you bring and the perks your opponent brings, the perks that would be a strong pick even tough it is the only perk you equipped. Useless on the other hand is either so weak that there is no use bringing the perk with you even if you combo them with other perks. Or the perk requires a your oponent to pick a specific killer or perk.
---
Decisive strike would go from meta to a place inbetween meta and useless, a game developer's goal should be to get everything into that sweet spot. We should judge perks on wether they are usefull, but that means that you should judge them if they are useless AND too usefull.
---
I hope I was clear enough and I hope you don't need to make up more sentences I never said to feed your own narrative 
---
You've been a redditor for 4 days and you already have negative karma. Good job, mate.
---
Ooof?
---
Clown. He's... gross. His backstory is thorough, original, and interesting, but disgusting nonetheless. 
---
Maybe, nothing confirmed yet. But the last 3 killers came out on June 12, August 18 &amp; December 14. So the new DLC could drop today i think
---
On ps4 its fucked, farming is a must to get it
---
Been trying this out, and it's still not counting for me. Oh well, might aswell stop trying so I don't have to suffer from playing Legion too much
---
I can’t figure out the flashlight as a survivor or killer so honestly this video and comments were educational lol 
---
A Nurse's calling 
---
Unnerving Presence
---
How can it be possible to both love and hate something so much 
---
I didn't realise two chases and one hook, per survivor, was free.
---
It's not more fun but it's not free.
---
Oh ok then I understand, but I was mostly talking about PC players and stable fps experience
---
I am a p3 Laurie. I love my og scream queen
---
How is she supposed to do gens if she cant move?
---
Not on console, those came out pretty recently for us
---
Every perk should be gimmicky or situational. If it is a general perk, it should be weak. I personally think  self care should just be deleted. Perks like pharmacy are much more interesting and fun.
---
Well yea but they were always gonna add new cosmetics
---
Are you serious?! I asked Mathieu on his stream a few more than back about licenced cosmetics and he said it was going along very well so I'm actually inclined to get a tad hyped
---
And this probably just will get worse
---
Why does anyone care who anyone plays as in the first place?
---
Also when killer has a mori
---
Feels bad when you go against a full hex perk spirit/hag build and you break everything but devour/noed and the killer patrols it.
---
According to [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches), nope. There doesnt seem to be much of a consistency on patch delivery, but if we look for chapter patches leads to believe that this new chapter will be released on tuesday.
---
Legion - 18/Dec (tue)
---
Spirit - 18/Sep (tue)
---
Clown - 12/Jun (tue)
---
Piggy - 23/Jan (tue)
---
And that's exactly why I love it stacked with unnerving presence and a game offering while playing Doctor. 
---
Self-care/adrenaline/sprintburst etc.. is a plain crutch for bad survivors who failed to do their job sucessfully and rewards them for playing badly. 
---
What are your thoughts on Franks?
---
The killer has her blocked in a corner dude, she cant leave to go do gens
---
Extended Range are his best addons by far.  Nancy's Masterpiece + either decreased skill checks or decreased action speed
---
And you don't believe being completely invisible plus no scratch marks isn't a crutch? Try that method with kate or meg. It will work way less. And then to make it harder, try without urban evasion. I mean I'm not gonna tell you how to play, but it just feels so wrong when you say "confused killers" when you're absolutely invisible. I'm sure you won't change your ways but you can't be a p3 claudette and complain about crutches
---
Okay i agree that adrenaline needs a chsnge and sprint burst IS a crutch but self care is not a crutch
---
It doesn't have to be extreme. Just an exposed icon would do. And some killers know the signs of ds and juggle to combat it. Borrowed Time, I can see your problem with, but how is Self Care unfair? Is it unfair if survivors heal each other or use an insta-heal on a medkit?
---
Or in BHVR's opinion you're fog whisperer material.
---
yup, had one that hid in the basement the entire time and would let us die on hook, then urban evasioned out after we’re all dead and it’s a fully brown immersed claudette what then gets downed by the nurse who gives it to her i was so mad
---
I'm cleansing 5 totems when I can what's the rant about? Also, Small Game perk is here for a reason
---
This is my opinion
---
But I can see why you think that way. It's all from personal experience. 
---
Absolutely. The amount of times a killer has hooked me after 5 gens of failing to hook even a single person is ridiculous. As someone who mostly plays killer, I feel like people think I'm crazy when I say DS was alright and NOED should be removed. I refuse to use it.
---
Ye
---
lol, so you would Start with the ability to Mori everyone?
---
Self-care is a crutch because good survivors shouldn't get hit and have to use a perk to make up for being bad.
---
That's literally your logic when it comes to NOED.
---
while I am not trying to argue with you, I feel that you need to watch all the Texas Chainsaw to get a good feeling of who LF is as a character.  There is a lot of mystery in the 1st 2 films and then i gets into more backstory in the other films.    His family is amazing in Chainsaw 2 (my favorite and CHILI!) but Dennis Hopper is over the top! 
---
Thanks for forcefully reminding me of the fact that the lorewise (arguably) sweetest Character has the most toxic Mains (mostly) I'm shaking OP :(
---
~~obligatory /s I guess? I do find it ironic tho lmao~~
---
Which killers? Some have no terror radius until they engage.
---
Everybody i play with doesn't play as much or as good as me or as frequently as me and i don't really want to play with randoms so i solo queue /:
---
It's a stalemate, it's just as much on the survivor as the killer. I'd like to know if gens were left or if the gates were open.  
---
too op but so is Iridescent Heads so...
---
I saw leather face on Netflix so I have an ok idea about his origin. But I do find that the first film alone, shrouded with mystery and just outright blood lust makes him a very distressing killer. 
---
Apparently saying you hide a lot is what gets upvotes on this  post -\_\_- but that's reasonable i guess. but you should probably work on getting better internet
---
Imagine not saying anything at all if you dont have nothing nice to say, am i right?
---
I can't be bothered making detailed replies to NOED threads anymore so i'll just go ahead and post this comment chain from a few months ago that does a good job explaining why NOED is in a good spot.
---
&gt;NOED has counters.
---
&gt;&gt;I shouldn't have to run perks(Small Game, Detective's Hunch) just to counter my opponent's, if he doesn't have NOED than it's just a waste.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes you should, that's how balance works and you can't always prepare for every single loadout and circumstance.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But it takes too much time to cleanse totems that could otherwise be spent rushing my opponent out of the match.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, that's the entire point. It's supposed to slow matches down on average without having to keep increasing generator repair times, which nobody likes. Killers who don't even run NOED still benefit from the fact that there's others that do. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only bad killer use NOED, it's a crutch.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can say that about anything. You know what? Good survivors don't wipe to NOED. The perk is going to activate the same way every single time, whether the killer was trash or whether they're MLG, if you didn't cleanse totems than it's going to proc. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why should I be punished for doing the objective...?
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doing gens isn't your objective, escaping alive is. Repairing them are just a means to that end. So if you died, you didn't actually complete anything. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just think the perk is too powerful, it's frustrating to make it all the way to the end of the match just to get one-shotted at the finish line.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The killer was playing with a handicap for 95% of the match, only using three perks. You might not have even lived until NOED's activation if the killer had taken a perk that would have been relevant for the whole match. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Look I just think it's an unfun perk.
---
I think that about sums up every post that could be made in this thread, am I leaving any out?
---
When you try and help some people out, but people drop in with some harsh knowledge and ridicule 
---
Dbd community at it finest 
---
For all the downvotes ive gotten on this post it feels really good when someone agrees lol i hate claudettes
---
Any perk that can be removed without it ever being useful is not a crutch. All of the perks that survivors whine about are also the perks that are the most easily countered. It's tiring. 
---
Now that's where you're just being fucking stupid.
---
I was curious, I play Legion and I see this a lot. My general take on it is that you’re right, it’s stupid strong, but it’s not like Legion is the only killer with a borderline broken add on
---
I would absolutely love it if they changed this for PS4 as well. Its one of the only trophies I consider impossible as I play all killers on rotation.
---
I dont get it. /s
---
Run Small Game? Survivors have a total of 16 perk slots among them, there's no reason one of you shouldn't have it if you're too new to know the totem spawns.
---
Feel free to explain why, without resorting to personal attacks.
---
Yeah lol it really gives you a good idea of what kind of people play this game. I'm amazed i got so many downvotes on things that are pretty reasonable and make sense but idk apparently using every crutch as survivor is more fun than having skill
---
well tbh just Mixtape and Heads. others don't have such annoyingly strong add-ons. 
---
His family is NUTZ in the Chainsaw 2, I highly recommend if you like over the top.  
---
I've been hearing the heartbeat just fine ... except for the run of Michael Myers we were up against over the weekend. Sneaky mofo.
---
Yote Boat
---
Had this happen to me before. Though it was more the chase was dragging on so long i knew the crows were coming soon and I would get spotted anyways. 
---
The thing is, the survivor isn’t doing anything wrong. The killer can and should be banned for this. It doesn’t really matter whether the gates were open or not.
---
I do understand this reasoning, I just dont think perks that dont involve a mildly fair input/output ratio are fair by any means. Referring to my idea of that and end game perks, I would say that Blood Warden is valid and fair because it requires you to input an effect (actually hooking someone)  and there is a somewhat proportional output (the gates being blocked). Again imo
---
Not disagreeing there, tho I do find it hilarious the mass down vote for pointing out the obvious that people are missing xD
---
You can actually see it yourself in [jesterret’s Github repo](https://github.com/jesterret/DBDPakTrack/tree/master/DeadByDaylight/Content/Data/Store) - that link goes to the store section, and if you go into the subdirectories for campers/slashers, you’ll find the two in the respective ones. They have only been added there with the recent PTB along with Jane and the Plague (can be checked with the history function of Github).
---
I was worried for a second that this perk wouldn't have much counterplay and would just be a massive time sink for the killer, but surveillance is a great point and makes me okay with this perk existing as a killer main.
---
pretty much every survivor uses the free kobe perk 
---
had not just one, but TWO killers in the same day see 2/3 DC's and let me/us escape unscathed! shoutout to that doc and trapper who were surprisingly chill, you know who you are~
---
and for the first time in my stealthy, UE-running life i took hits for &amp; distracted the killer from a lovely bill who'd always run to save me from the hook! picked himself up with unbreakable while i died, finished the last gen, and died so his swf duo could get the hatch. they were both super sweet post-game, i'll remember 'em forever!! 💕
---
I kinda agree on ace, but Quentin's perks aren't trash:
---
Wake up, even though beibg extremely situational, can be really usefull with randoms and killers against whom you'd want to open the gate asap.
---
Pharmacy gives you a free green medkit and therefore allows you to heal yourself 2 times at full speed and, if you get it out, to then use that green medkit in the future without having to waste a perk slot for pharmacy or self care.
---
vigil... ok, since the "exhaustion no longer recharges during running"-change it really is trash...
---
From what I've seen and played she's really good
---
If you want to take it literally, fine, it's not free, it's cheap as in both sides actually have to do part of their objective but only a fraction, 
---
For survivors minimum 3 gens (1/2 of their objectives 3 gens for 1 survivor or up to 5/6 5 gens for 4 survivors to get hatch) 
---
For killers minimum 4 hooks 6 downs (1/2 of the work rather than 12 downs and 4 hooks)
---
This one is good
---
Tinkerer reduces the heartbeat to 0, michael has no heartbeat in tier 1 and can get a 6 meter terror radius in tier 2 that you often won't hear as the chase music starts instantly. Pig has no terror radius when crouched, wraith can get an add on which temporarily gives him no terror radius after decloaking. Chances are you have just had a couple games where the killers have one of these by chance.
---
Sell because so many people disagree I’ll say why. I want to disclaim this first off by saying it’s been a long time since I’ve both played DBD and watched Tyde so if there’s something I’m supposed to know about him, then sorry.
---
Anyways continuing. When I first started DBD I was trash and when I left it I was mediocre trash. The reason I like Tyde so much is because I found value in every video he did. He helped me become better at both survivor and killer.
---
I became a better killer and therefore using my experience as a killer was able to transmute my ideas and play style to make a better survivor play.
---
I saw how good he is too. A lot of people seem to think he isn’t good. I don’t know why because unless he cherry picks times he loses out of the videos (I don’t believe he does) then his win rate is pretty high.
---
So to sum it up. He has helped me immensely in my game strategy while also having a deep knowledge of how the game works.
---
I spy with my little eye... AN IFUNNY.CO WATERMARK
---
I do believe she’ll be a good killer, but I still usually wait until she hits live to make a final determination, just to see how everyone plays her.
---
I demand a passive bonus to boldness for wearing bright colors! Pink hair Nea's and blue hair Fengs are putting themselves in huge danger to look stylish.
---
Yeah cause I used its meme making software to make it
---
HybridPanda would be proud lol
---
That sucks for you because it was just on the shrine like three or four weeks ago. You literally just missed it.
---
If i understood you correctly, then yes skip all the perks and expensive offerings. However you'll spend approximately the same amount of bloodpoints anyway, and if thou ever want to play that character take in to account that you dont have any good perks for them.
---
If I had a dollar for every noed post, I would be rich.
---
Yeah I'm aware of all the stupid things survivors demand from killers. It's just stupid, and they're trying to invoke some sort of outside influence to make sure killers play to their liking.
---
Last I checked you don't get a choice in how a killer murders you.
---
Ive gotten over my distaste for certain perks bc I play both sides and use all the best perks across my killers and survivor builds but I have become annoyed with the shrine of secrets and everyone unlocking certain perks so easily. Hex: Ruin for sure. 
---
Honestly this. Like this explains all survivor.
---
I was busy running distraction so that people could get saved off of hooks &amp; doing generators while everyone else was healing.
---
&amp; no, we wouldn't have both died. We could have easily split up while one person ran distraction &amp; another opened the gate.
---
I still wish the Trapper's was him curb stomping their head into a bear trap.
---
&gt; how is self care a crutch?
---
Self care is a crutch because it allows survivors to heal themselves infinitely without the aid of other survivors. This means that you can't punish survivors who run this perk because they can ALWAYS revert whatever damage you do to them.
---
&gt;You have a bad game, you don't apply pressurr correctly and survivors pop all the gens. But then you just get a speed boost and instadown. Crutch.
---
You have a bad game, you don't avoid the killer correctly and they get a hit on you, But then you juke them and hide and heal yourself back to full health. Crutch.
---
&gt;Now i think we can change it to have only 1 of those things: only the speedboost or only the instadown.
---
Or maybe you could add a way to remove the perk from the game before it even get's activated, oh wait that's already a thing.
---
The devs have already said that the perk is in the right spot, an opinion only disagreed upon by the vocal salty minority.
---
Quizzing. How about STBFL?
---
Wait what. Am I lucky the clip won't play for me?

You sound fun.

Its not a matter of close, she came up no heart bear, she hit me chased and downed me, she picked me up and hooked me, and camped me.  There has always been a heartbeat before.

So kinda like the new corrupted pool. 
---
Perhaps the time the last is equal to the total amount of time that survivors have spent hiding in lockers.(also only one at a time so you still have the other gates and gens)
---
First is Make Your Choice and Second is Save The Best For Last
---
As a killer main, I feel no need to use noed. At rank 1 I often kill three people with at least 1 gen or 2 left. Unless they all have instaheals with decisive I feel no need to use it. 
---
That being said, I understand why people use it. Some find it very frustrating when a 4 man swf, with instaheals and decisive, rush ruin and complete the gens in five minutes. Using noed is just a way of making sure that survivors who rush gens are punished for not doing totems. 
---
I personally feel it should be built in the game, with a counter at the bottom telling all of the survivors how many totems are left. They should also implement a way for the game to figure out the difference between dull and lit totems so that the game can make dull totems spawn in more obvious spots.
---
This would make noed easier to counter but also force survivors to destroy totems and increase the game by at least two minutes without it being bullshit or unfun for survivors.
---
Depends on where you are, If somewhere in the UK it might be about 5-6Pm maybe, But If you are near Finland, Estonia or such it might be about 6 (Maybe 7)-8.
---
How about ANC?
---
What is actually a decent ping? Commonly my friends and I have lag free matches all the way up to 150 running into more problems at 200 what is your limit to leave the lobby?
---
A 3k is a killer win and a 2 escape is a draw, as far as I'm concerned.
---
i like you
---
The ones who wear bright clothes are the ones truly RPing Claudette.
---
It's not used very much since you rarely find the survivor that is affected, but when it works, it can end a match fast. Especially if paired with Devour Hope!
---
Why would you say soon to something with an actual answer :(
---
I've played every killer except clown and spirit and I am awful at any killer with a normal terror radius. Then with Huntress I can't hit anything and wraith I can't either. The only three killers I've

Had good success with is Pig Freddy and the Shape in that order, Freddy is actually pretty good for my playstyle
---
&gt;Self care is a crutch because it allows survivors to heal themselves infinitely without the aid of other survivors. This means that you can't punish survivors who run this perk because they can ALWAYS revert whatever damage you do to them.
---
Self care is healing but way slower than healing with survivors. Even if all 4 survivors ran it, theyd still be better off always double healing. Self care is not a crutch, it takes an absurd amount of time just to heal one health state, with the logic of "always reverting whatever damage you do", that means healing as a mechanic is a crutch too, or youre just being inconsistent with your own logic. 
---
&gt;You have a bad game, you don't avoid the killer correctly and they get a hit on you, But then you juke them and hide and heal yourself back to full health. Crutch.
---
Juking the killer requires skill, you can't just heal yourself mid chase with self care unless the killer stands there and let's you. Again, with this logic, healing as a mechanic is a crutch. Self care is just less effeciant than healing with the help of other teammates, the only way the situation would work with your logic that it's a crutch is if 3 survivors are dead and the 4th survivor is able to heal themselves with Self care, but they're already at a disadvantage unless they know where hatch is (then that makes killer at a disadvantage).
---
&gt;Or maybe you could add a way to remove the perk from the game before it even get's activated, oh wait that's already a thing.
---
&gt;The devs have already said that the perk is in the right spot, an opinion only disagreed upon by the vocal salty minority.
---
I wouldn't say it's the "vocal salty minority", but to each their own. I'm not saying my opinion on noed,just saying that the mentality that noed is obnoxious is more common than you think
---
Psh that's a game changer, really appreciate your insight bruh. I actually decided to get it. Its downloading right now. And i got the dlcs so f it lol
---
“Kenneth take a seat right over here.”
---
I think stability is more important. I could be wrong though. Looking at the ping in the lobby, if the killers ping keeps jumping up and down inconsistently, then you get these games where u warp around.
---
Tired of trying to play killer just to see red pings constantly leaving, my internet is fine.
---
It's based on personal opinions and experience. So for me not. 
---
Im sorry, I only got 420420420420.420. Wanna give me a discount?
---
Oh ok 
---
Oh ok now I get it
---
*I can be your Ormond or your McMillan.*
---
My idea was that the 15 second action would be the headstart, it would just need to be a noticeable animation so the survivor knows that the killer is doing it. 
---
Not sure if it's necessary to make it an uninterruptible a room since if the killer hits the survivor anywhere near the hatch they will use the cool down to escape.
---
I wish NOED would at least show in the sidebar when it activates rather than requiring someone to go down for it to appear.
---
I like Lery's.
---
I've had matches where the killers curb stomped me and other survivors, and matches where the killer never finds me.
---
Nice

[Patch 2.6.0](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/50204/2-6-0-chapter-11-player-test-build/p1?new=1&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
Check the devour hope changes. It might not be implemented but I think that this is a much more balanced noed. You work for your buffs and get them before the end of the match. You do well enough, you even get a mori to boot
---
Why even make it a tier list if you aren't trying to meme/trying to be objectively accurate?
---
It is confirmed by playstation too btw. 20th for japan so today because of time zones.
---
https://twitter.com/PlayStation_jp/status/1106398192512327680?s=19
---
you see here is the issue the survivors have no choice they can do the gens and "gen rush" you can loop the entire game and the killers bitch about that or you can hide and do gens and get called for "immersion" which makes no sense 
---
you see the issue is no matter what the survivors do the killers will still complain (not all of them) so its a lose lose situation please tell me what do you expect the survivors to do?
---
Alright let's answer these in the order that they appear
---
1) the terror radius is when not wearing a mask. As soon as a mask is donned the terror radius is normal
---
2)hack=completing task such as a short memory game, making a path with specs,or moving blocks. Something simple but requires brain power. Again only without masks
---
3)okay that one may be out there cant say much
---
4)masks are under the outfit screen so you can only have one. Changing masks takes about as much time as it does to switch from punishment to treatment
---
5) just kinda one big refrence but hey hope this clears it up
---
Then enjoy the extra bloodpoints.
---
Yeah, you're completely right. I realize I am sensitive, but I only take it personally when I am actively trying to make sure people are having a fun and fair game. 
---
Ahhh shit. 
---
INB4 “fookin dead ard”
---
Nice that you were able to provide PS4 Japan official twitter post that is ... same as https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR saying it is coming today. But all the same you provided information. Nice work *slow clap*
---
I never knew I needed Legion with sunglasses so much in my life
---
Thanks for putting my old and new mains so high (Clown and Trapper) but they are not equal or better than Huntress no way. I mained her a little bit too and I can tell ya, she is way better than Clown and Trapper.
---
no I think not self care is a important perk becuase the meta will be slowing healing down chloraphobia franklins sloppy butcher,nurses calling,unnerving would deletea  medkit 
---
Yeah, I think it would fail. In addition to certain killers just being dodged (Legion most of all, but also Nurse for sure, Doc, maybe Clown), the problem mostly lies with certain add-ons that can be used. So if you see it’s a Huntress, you might be thinking “cool, I’m down for this”....then then the game begins and you realize that she’s using insta-down hatchets. That changes everything. A lot of killers complain about going against certain survivors and dodge lobbies, but then have no problem using broken add-ons or ebony mories that give them a massive advantage. 
---
not to mention how many people will freak out and run towards you if you just stand 2 seconds in the same spot :)
---
Don’t let toxic survivors deter you from playing the way you like, some survivors get off on calling killers/survivors for supposedly “sucking”.  So if you don’t camp the survivor when the exit gates are open then cool, but if you do it’s still okay. I’m a survivor main, and I definitely understand where you’re coming from
---
Bro what 💀
---
This brings a tear to my eye. Freddy gang.
---
It’s extremely situational but when it works it’s an amazing perk. 
---
exactly!  My fun and enjoyment has and always will come first.  
---
This sounds good on the surface but it's essentially just "Don't let people with high ping host games" painted differently.
---
People are ALWAYS going to choose the lowest option regardless of how many matches they had at high ping.
---
It's the same thing as adding an option to disable killers you don't like, nurse mains would NEVER get a match again.
---
Trust me, in my current state, you don't want me to,and I don't want to.
---
Depends how often you go for unhooks. If you dont go for them often dont use it, if you go for them often you are bound to find a face camper. Especially in end game and borrowed come in super clutch when its needed. 
---
Ok. I actually got this mask about a month ago. It was half price on Amazon. It still cost me $50. IMO, it was worth it!
---
Fuck them.  That’s the purpose of playing Killer. People get salty when they lose.
---
Good for making sure that last person gets out end game and for those pesky tunnelers.
---
"Find Help"
---
Please listen to the game, it cares about you.
---
That is not completely true. Although that would be a pretty funny exhibit to see.
---
What's wrong with the spelling?
---
Love the style on this one. Great job! 
---
It's a great counter to camping.
---
What people hate is abusing the addon « Frank’s mixtape » by tunneling one survivor and ignoring the stun. Also looking down while following that survivor so their mend bar still goes down, while being out of chase
---
Noed is only countered by swf. Even if its only a two man they can easily counter it.
---
&gt; Self care is healing but way slower than healing with survivors. Even if all 4 survivors ran it, theyd still be better off always double healing. Self care is not a crutch, it takes an absurd amount of time just to heal one health state, with the logic of "always reverting whatever damage you do", that means healing as a mechanic is a crutch too, or youre just being inconsistent with your own logic.
---
It's slower but still allows you to play sub optimally with very little risk, at most it delays you 12 seconds, wheras finding another survivor can take longer + the ammount of time they spend off the gen. + The added risk of running into the killer while injured and going down. 
---
&gt;with the logic of "always reverting whatever damage you do", that means healing as a mechanic is a crutch too, or youre just being inconsistent with your own logic.
---
A Medkit has charges that run out, A teamate has infinite charges but A) can be hard to locate or B) can be removed from the game by the killer, Self-care is slow but an infinite source of healing that requires nothing other than standind still for 12-13 seconds.
---
&gt;Juking the killer requires skill, 
---
Not really. drop a pallet, round the corner, crouch down and move slowly. 9/10 times you can avoid the killer, survivors don't play like this hence why theres this skewed perception on the survivor side that killers are some unstoppable that are literally impossible to get away from.
---
&gt;  you can't just heal yourself mid chase with self care unless the killer stands there and let's you. Again, with this logic, healing as a mechanic is a crutch. Self care is just less effeciant than healing with the help of other teammates, the only way the situation would work with your logic that it's a crutch is if 3 survivors are dead and the 4th survivor is able to heal themselves with Self care, but they're already at a disadvantage unless they know where hatch is (then that makes killer at a disadvantage).
---
Already covered this above.
---
&gt;I wouldn't say it's the "vocal salty minority"
---
Really? because almost every post, including yours, is some variation of "Killer gets free kills for no reason, unfair, pls nerf."
---
Your own post dosent even go into detail, you just call it a crutch and leave it there.
---
You can moan about the perk all you want, but the devs think it's in a good spot and it is. The Perk is designed to slow the game down by forcing survivors to look for totems and break them. If you think looking for 5 totems takes too much time, and you'd rather do gens and try to escape, that's perfectly fine. But if you go down to NOED as a result, then you lose all right to complain about the perk.
---
Try and play killer. You will quickly realise that their limited FoV makes it very easy to lose survivors in the right conditions
---
~Nea~ The Entity told me
---
Strange... The only perk I know that can do that is tinkerer but that only lasts max 12 seconds and only triggers when gens are completed.
---
Which is fine, other people probably wont and that person still gets a match albeit with a slightly longer delay.
---
If there was a system that literally PREVENTED you from being matched with high ping, everyone would use it. No one would sit there and go "Yeah ill let myself be matched with laggy high ping matches."
---
Cloak and Dagger. 
---
So you actually have to expend some effort? That's not a bad thing.
---
Got ya. It's A Nurse Calling. No one uses this anyway. 😉
---
This would be a nice option, had a few games last night with killers in the 700 ping range, and also change the lobby load time from 60 seconds to 30 seconds, I hate sitting there because 1 dipshit won’t ready up and is rotating on what type of pants they wanna wear! 
---
Oh, I forgot about the update that prevents solo survivors from being able to cleanse totems. Wait...
---
With filter I wouldn't get high ping lobbies with higher wait times.
---
Without filter I would leave high ping lobbies with lower wait times.
---
Either way the high ping user doesn't get the match.
---
Claudette as normal is invisible.
---
How do you bait the flashlight?
---
Which is the intended purpose of the perk. It's supposed to have two functions, the first being a bonus for killers in the form of an instant down and a speed boost, the second in the form of slowing down the game by forcing survivors to look for totems.
---
Right now the gen speeds are too fast, you can be in and out of a match in under 5 minutes if the conditions are right, the game needs SOMETHING to slow it down, because adding more time to the gens is boring and turns the game into an M1 simulator.
---
On PS4 i i have played with japanese people....I live In Norway.
---
hahaha this hit me in the feelings like , my friends are sick and tired of dbd's shit, i spent hours convencing them to play a few games, when i actually get them to play , something like this happens and their like 'yup i knew it , that's it for me' and im like ffs.
---
Lol even in a part of hell or whatever realm the survivors are in we still have spy’s.... 
---
&gt; With filter I wouldn't get high ping lobbies with higher wait times. Without filter I would leave high ping lobbies with lower wait times.
---
And other people would join and possibly stay.
---
One is you manially dodging the lobby, the other gives people an automatic way of doing it.
---
Solo survivors have no idea how many totems are left on the map. Unless they look for all five (which is a huge time waster) there will always be one or two well hid totems.
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE VOMIT MOM ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
That's mostly the question of bp grind, but not the NOED balance itself. Also Small Game is not a teachable, so you would obtain it in time. 
---
First 100h have steep learning curve and consist of hard grind, but that's what game is right now, balancing perks around that would make them less worthy for high skill and experience players. Many players don't even need Small Game because of the map knowledge they have and Hex perks are already fragile because of that.
---
Just keep the grind, keep winning and loosing, you'll get to the point when NOED doesn't seem so OP anymore. I'm telling you this as a player who started as survivor main solo, long time has passed before I found friends to play SWF with.
---
Also first hours were my favourite because those were still scary. Right now it's just a competitive game for me and I kinda miss those times though I don't miss the grind. 
---
I think we’re mostly on the same page. 
---
I said this in another comment: It feels like the developers are tailoring all of their updates to killers who are complaining about SWF which significantly effects people who play alone or play casually. They’re taking a minority part of the player base and changing the game for them while screwing everyone else
---
How was SWF not in the games original parameters? It’s in the base game, the devs expected people to play together with mics. I play SWF occasionally and we still lose sometimes, no matter how coordinated we are. It’s a strategy game at it’s best. You have to plan for the opponents move and be smart about what you do. Being able to talk to your teammates is just another strategy. 
---
And like I said, I don’t play toxically. I don’t teabag, I don’t camp, I don’t instasave even when people do it to me. This game has a pretty toxic player base in general which I think is where a lot of frustration stems. This is by far the most toxic game community I’ve been apart of 
---
Or much lower.
---
He's talking about connection issues because he hasn't experienced frame rate issues, I haven't ever had problems with my framerate on a base ps4 either. 
---
Comparing console to polio XD
---
Is that Ellen?
---
Unless they actually look for them? Then yeah. Plus, not every survivor needs to be on the hunt for totems. And NOED is meant to slow the game down, so "time waster" is moot.
---
They made the skillcheck bigger.
---
lol salty
---
If we get old lady Laurie, I will have a new Main.
---
It really has become one of my favorite tracking perks. 
---
This stuff very rarely releases on a different time. If it will be released like Legion, it should start to appear in around 4-5 hours.
---
Playing against Russian killers as someone who lives in the middle of the US is wild.
---
He’s definitely not as good as trapper, clown, or doctor at least, just because he lacks chase abilities. Being good at a killer doesn’t make him good
---
Still morning, just wait a bit &amp; we will see. Believe me we’re all excited, but good things come to those who wait. 😊
---
Fuckin beautiful
---
Whoa, just take it easy man
---
Didnt the ptb come out two weeks ago tomorrow? Have a hunch it'll be released tomorrow but I dont know anything.
---
He's a fucking pydchparh why would we feel bad for him
---
Its quite tall i must say
---
&gt;It's slower but still allows you to play sub optimally with very little risk, at most it delays you 12 seconds, wheras finding another survivor can take longer + the ammount of time they spend off the gen. + The added risk of running into the killer while injured and going down. 
---
If you play sub optimally youre getting hooked and you're closer to death. Self care doesn't change that. You can lower the amount of time it takes to find other survivors by running a perk that locates survivors, self care is inefficient. You still have a risk of the killer hearing your moans and finding you, and if you get healed by a teammate and it's 12 extra seconds 2 people can be on a gen, which can be a lot. Also healing with self care make a it more likely youll be found by the killer before youre finished healing.
---
&gt;A Medkit has charges that run out, A teamate has infinite charges but A) can be hard to locate or B) can be removed from the game by the killer, Self-care is slow but an infinite source of healing that requires nothing other than standind still for 12-13 seconds.
---
If you can't find teammates run a perk that can find teammates, saving you time from self caring. Self care is not standing still for 12-13 seconds, it takes much longer to heal with self care, it isnt worth it, unless you're sure you can't depend on your teammates.
---
&gt;Not really. drop a pallet, round the corner, crouch down and move slowly. 9/10 times you can avoid the killer, survivors don't play like this hence why theres this skewed perception on the survivor side that killers are some unstoppable that are literally impossible to get away from.
---
If you can pull that off, that's the killers fault. They're playing horribly, a killer with common sense won't let you pull such a basic maneuver and let you get away with it. Killers arent impossible to get away from, but acting as if it doesn't require skill to escape a killer who is actually decent is lying. A lot of chases will end in the survivor going down, which is why a lot of survivors prioritize wasting the killers time during chase instead of escaping that chase.
---
&gt;Really? because almost every post, including yours, is some variation of "Killer gets free kills for no reason, unfair, pls nerf."
---
&gt;Your own post dosent even go into detail, you just call it a crutch and leave it there.

But if you go down to NOED as a result, then you lose all right to complain about the perk.
---
I don't refer to basically any perks as crutches, I hate that term. I didn't even say my opinion on noed, I'm not even calling for a nerf. I think if noed should stay the way it is, there should be a more interactive way to deactivate it than just playing a game of hide and seek with a totem and holding a button, it's tedious to do it every game just to get rid of the risk of a single perk turning your flawless match into you being sacrificed, especially with random where you have no idea if other people are trying to cleanse totems too
---
Roleplay the killer in your head.
---
It's how I got allowed myself to tank in MMORPGs - you'll be told in whispers that you're going too fast and too slow in the same dungeon, for example. If you can't take criticisms you'll burn out. I started thinking of myself as the leader of petulant, hyperactive, coked-up murderers, like I was the one sane adult who had to make decisions for this pack of wild, rabid DPS dogs.
---
In DBD I do the same thing. I'm a killer. A psychopath. If I'm making survivors angry, if they're yelling at me, then they're getting the experience they signed up for. They're being reminded they're meat, to do with as I please, and they don't like it. But the game would be nothing if there weren't this antagonism and asymmetry. You're the murderous version of a roller coaster - you're inducing emotions they wanted when they clicked ready. They might scream all sorts of nasty things, but then they get back in line for another round.
---
They don't think they want harsh killers, but meat's stupid. Give it what it really wants. The screams are your thanks.
---
Yeah I figured lo
---
Yes!!!!
---
If you have ever played solo survivor at rank 1 you will instantly realise how rare it is for noed to be countered. 
---
I don't think noed is op and I don't think it's weak. I think it's inconsistent. You can not argue that solo survivors struggle to counter noed and even if you do you have to acknowledge that swf absolutely annihilate it. If you do you are delusional.
---
Got hatchets AND continued her original pursuit of the Kate.
---
fengs perks are useful? more than bill's borrowed time? claudettes perks are useful? other than empathy i don't think i agree. meg's? i mean .. adrenaline is arguably the best survivor perk but other than that, sprint burst is literally the worst exhaustion perk of the game, quick and quiet , i mean, meeeh , in my experience it gives you out more than it helps you tbh, even yesterday, i was chasing this quick n quiet user, he vaulted i had no sound cue, shortly after he desapears, 1 second later he's getting yoinked out of a closet.   just goes to show you, perks beeing useful are totally variable depending on you skill level/rank at the game. quick n quiet might be extremely powerful against low skilled killers, i think self care for instance does absolutely nothing besides wasting the teams time, selfcare users don't even use their time as long as they are injured, leading to a lost  game for everyone. the game doesnt press pause just because you are hurt.  but on the other hand on lower skill levels you cant really rely on anyone to heal you so i guess it kinda makes sense? i dont know i dont think theres no accurate tier list that can be made. 
---
37. But preferred the old days sir
---
Stop.
---
Well, some professionals have standards.
---
Oh okay, I haven't played the test build.
---
Little point to spend dev-time to it now.
---
This system has been in place for years and dedicated servers are about to be introduced to it.
---
Also a big flaw in "ping limit" is that ping fluctuates. I've had yellow/red rooms go green countless times.
---
It’s not morning for everyone, I want to play the chapter this evening lol
---
Yeah, because solo survivors don't want to do totems in general.
---
And of course they do, because they have more information than they're supposed to.
---
Looks at gen i kicked at 40% see it's at 75% angrily scuttle around looking for survivor
---
More of morning where the devs are, it will come. 
---
Oh, I know, just saying ;) The game is just pretty stale rn and I want to get something to grind for again
---
Please I wanna see cosmetics for this guy
---
It will come next week 😢
---
Amazing perk, easily one of my favourites
---
Exactly there's nothing interesting about him at all. 
---
cool... when it comes. it’s only taken them 3 years

Here is the thing my friend. I am survivor main and i occasionally play killer too. As a survivor I always deeply appreciate killers that want to have fun. Killer that doesnt need to 4K with any means necessary(slugging the survivor so he can find the forth person for example). And i appreciate if somebody gives me the hatch. I adore that. Having said that the super nice killers can sometimes be more annoying than the mean ahole ones. Becouse you want the challange as a survivor. You wanna outthink us and we wanna ou think you. People that are mean at the end of a chat for somebody literally accomplishing their objective are just the worst. As a survivor I have had other survivors writing me the worst stuff and when I am killer people write mean stuff too. But I had matches with SWF with 4 flashlights and 4 decisive strikes and survivors apologized at the end for making it not fun for me. Easisest solution to any video game problem is...play the way you have the most fun. You spent money to have fun with the game. And people will do the same. And just because someone say the mean stuff doesnt mean a thing. Next match they will forget they said anything mean to you and you should do the same. Play the game to have fun. You will meet nice people and mean people. There is nothing you can do.

I believe it’s on sale for NA only
---
God have mercy on your soul
---
To be honest, this would be a great feature for everyone, not just oceanic players. Me/my friends will commonly leave lobbies with consistent 300+ ping so it would be great if we could just not connect to them at all and keep our party intact (side note: please keep swf parties together when they leave a lobby! It sucks to remake lobbies after every game.)
---
100%, agree.
---
“Hello motherfucker” 😂
---
I can't wait to never worry about DS again because I don't tunnel.

You get Frenzy back in \~2 seconds, so they don't have time to heal. You don't need to wait to fully recharge it, just wait till it's usuable again (when it turns red). If they are in for farming, meaning they're not running away, they can do whatever they want and you will still be able to get hits. I did in 5-6 games without Frank's.
---
Yeah that’s the good thing, it’ll punish the right killers now.
---
Updating PS4 version now!  I just finished my daily and got the message that I couldn’t continue without updating.  Woohoo! 👍🏻
---
Just how I like my killers
---
Ebony and Ivory~
---
MARCHING FIRE THO
---
New Freddy buff looks marvellous 
---
Yeah! Devs hate survivors which is why 6 survivor perks were buffed!
---
I'm asking this myself every single time, but I don't get anything extra from buying the PSN or Xbox package instead of the single characters via aura cells, right?
---
Sickness not resetting on hook will be great.
---
You'll have to force yourself to get sick when going for saves now. Increased duration is big too. Almost doubled.
---
Sickness will be spreading way more than in ptb.
---
I didn't see the pause button. Someone else already explained.
---
I think you'll miss out on a color option for jane.
---
It’s great for Huntress, Clown, Pig and Legion, imo. Even Trapper can do alright there if you play the vault locations well.
---
If I see a toxic swf rejoin my lobby and I don’t have an ebony mori, I’ll totally drop a Lerys offering.
---
Doing Meg, you?
---
I think Lery’s is just brutal for Nurse... so many walls and objects to get stuck on. 
---
these changes are delicious, good to know that they've taken feedback and released her with good dp gain instead of waiting a whole year like with some of the other characters.
---
It's really well done and I love the art style 
---
It's probably because the plague has to infect people first then go to a fountain while the huntress has to go to a locker. 
---
AHHHHHHHHHHH I NEEED I GOTTA GO
---
Thanatophobia nerfed? Did I miss something, I thought this was basically a useless perk?
---
It should be cheaper to get the Package instead of both with aurics! And I think there was some kind of extra outfit you get, when you buy the package.
---
"Fixed an issue that caused the Halloween® music to play too loud during the camera intro when loading into Lampkin Lane. "
---
Perfect. Thank you. 
---
+1 for the username 
---
Stalker points. Hell yeah
---
The real question is why buff ruin.
---
The plague &lt;333333
---
I get your point, but it’s already hard to find a match with a survivor. I run into a lot of killers with ping and that’s after searching for 10+ minutes. You either find a match in under 2 min or over 10 min.
---
its not really much of a nerf. Maps are that size anyway
---
Freddy Vs. Jason would like a word, she was like 6th at least!
---
Already come across a couple Jane's.
---
The ptb ranking system was a huge change. I didnt think they were going to go through with it though. 
---
Ahh, I typed in Haddonfield and didnt see any results so I didn't think they fixed. Ty good sir for proving me wrong.  
---
What he said, but the one time I did experience frame lag it was because I upped my camera speed for nurse and Billy, so I just changed it back 
---
Am I just remembering it wrong, or was Deranged Pursuit changed? It now says
---
"In public matches as the Legion, down 25 different Survivors that have Deep Wound applied"
---
Didn't it have a "while in Killer Instinct" requirement before?
---
Stalk is love, Stalk is life
---
Summer update leaked
---
Alright, thanks guys. :)
---
These are all simple. I dig it.
---
Fixed an issue that caused the Halloween® music to play too loud during the camera intro when loading into Lampkin Lane. 
---
I'm confused by that too. I think it was buffed and then reverted or something 
---
They did
---
so this is the kinda guy that camps my ass when i get hooked 
---
It is, but at least it will probably seperate good from bad players more. Rank 1 wasn’t good how it was either. 
---
 What happens if you try to buy her with auric cells?
---
Either killers are rage quitting en masses or something keeps causing the killer to disconnect
---
You’re right. The first thing i did was downvote this post.
---
I just feel like its going to make morr survivors worry about themselves then the teamwork aspect of the game which is the main point of it
---
FIRE UP IS ACTUALLY GOOD NOW OMG
---
Very true
---
Not sure, I want to use them on cosmetics, that's why I'm waiting for the steam DLC.. still not out :(
---
I hate you.
---
Lol yeah
---
It is still like creating an indefinite amount of different queues and trying to match players within those. Imagine having 10 different game modes and 10 players they all prefer a different game mode above the others but they might not be completely opposed to playing other game modes, so what do you do? You allow them to queue for multiple game modes reducing your overall number of queues and increasing the chances of getting into a game with a reasonable wait.
---
Also ping is not constant so you might get a lobby jumping in and out of your preferred ping range, would you remove them from your system or include them, after all it might just be a one time ping spike or a constantly changing ping.
---
Or let's suppose every lobby is just 1ms above your preference making you unable to find any games, would you add tolerances and if so how big should they be?
---
You have to look at the probability of every event which could occur and judge their significance based on that. Its not as easy as saying I want an automatic filter to represent my subjective preferences regarding ping, its easier to let you decide per lobby if you want to play it or leave it. Also your expectations might change after leaving a few lobbies eventually allowing everyone to play dead by daylight no matter their ping.
---
final nail in the coffin for anything related to slugging. Never running honing stone after this comes out
---
Ash from Evil Dead is Ashley James Williams...
---
* This image link is either dead, deleted or broken. Please resubmit with a better link.
---
They have accidentally leaked info of the next survivor, as in not Jane. 
---
Can Legion perform interrupts like grabbing people off gens or while they're jumping into the hatch in Feral Frenzy mode? 
---
i hope u spawned on that hook D:
---
🦀🦀 DS nerfed 🦀🦀
---
So it released but the dlc didnt on the psn store?
---
Evil dead chapter next?
---
because they dont know what they are doing
---
because swf groups demanded thanato be nerfed cause of legion they nerf it
---
If only my EAC could be "instantiated" I might be able to get in and give this a whirl.
---

---
I'm in the EU and I got a 1100 ping lobby once, and before I get to an acceptable green-yellow lobby I have to leave at least five 300+ ones after having to wait 2-3 minutes to get one. 
---
Print screen, son, do you speak it?
---
Yes.
---
Context: I'm playing on PS4 and I'm doing Kill Your Friends and suddenly my friend sees these perks. Not sure how that made it in.
---
Nice job u/siberlily for the find.
---
"ggez" -Killer, probably.
---
Wait...what ? 
---
Look at the perks
---
Any of the baseline killers will teach you the basics. They share the same movement speed and terror radius. (The latter is less important) 
---
Huntress is a good place to start if you so choose, but she is slower than other killers and that comes with its own challenges when learning the game. 
---
Nurse *is* hard, and I agree with the other comment. You shouldn’t attempt to learn her until you know your maps (roughly) and you know the basics of chasing, patrolling, etc. I don’t know what console you’re on but I know that it is not very optimized and suffers at times. 
---
Spirit is a very fun and unique killer, definitely easier to learn than nurse is but I would still recommend a light knowledge of maps and chases before learning her, as her power benefits greatly from both of the aforementioned. 
---
Michael.. well, I don’t play him much. I do know that knowing when to use EW3 (evil within, the power) to capitalize on your 1 hit KO is important unless you’re running scratched mirror, which is its own beast and arguably not something you need to know about when learning Michael. 
---
TL;DR - Nurse hard, learn maps + how to chase first and foremost. Huntress good. 
---
Uhhh who
---
Is this real?  OMG tell me this is real!
---
I wouldn’t call running a brain dead loop “knowing how to loop” as there’s no thought at all involved in running that loop. The killer can’t catch up until the entity blocks the window, and the survivor isn’t doing anything impressive or skillful.
---
Not saying the huntress isn’t the asshole, but imo both people are assholes, the surv for being toxic on stream and expecting the killer to not react negatively about him abusing a busted tile, and the huntress for feeding into his play and looking to ruin his experience for it.
---
Yeah we are mostly on the same page, I'm also not accusing you of being toxic! It's cool that your not.
---
I've been playing on and off since 2016, Devs have been saying since then Team Comms were never intended to be used (note the lack of any Comms in-game) as it destroys much of the horror aspect, and they don't plan to either punish or promote it (could you imagine the fallout of getting rid of SWF). I think it makes the most sense at this point to embrace Comms into the base game for the sake of balance, but again a lot of the time not having to communicate with the toxic portion of the playerbase can be good, and it would be a lot work without a lot of players using it (continue to use discord, etc). 
---
No. 
---
This can’t be real right?
---
healing against Legion is not only useless, but it ruins any chance of your team finishing the gens.
---
I was just scrolling through my phone and almost screeched.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Exactly what I’m doing.  Gonna use cells to buy cosmetics for each, and use real money to buy off the PS store.  Hope it goes up for sale soon!
---
100% Evil Dead. But who's the Killer?
---
Someone is getting fired lmao
---
get the fuckkkk out! yes.
---
It was updated.
---
I know you're joking tho
---
Should be another hour or so till the psn store updates shouldn't it?
---
Everyone will have to
---
The only nerf was being Blinded in lockers to prevent OoO tracking. Everything else is either a buff or rewording to match accurate wording. 
---
Also for the killer perks getting “buffed” that’s only on teir 1 and 2. 3 remains the same in all cases. This just makes having T1 or T2 a little less worse than before. 
---
Can you grab people when they are searching in a chest? Never seem to work for me, even though I’m perfectly positioned and tap m1, I always slash not grab
---
Definetly, i hate the fact you can get stuck mid blink because of some rubble on the ground
---
Same thing happen to me, except I hock someone in the basement and need my hatchets, went to the nearest locker and there was a Dwight lol 
---
It’s installing.
---
Ruh roh raggy
---
I'm out at the minute has there been any signs of a update?
---
a demon of some sort I'm sure!
---
No but you can open a locker and grab them while in frenzy. 
---
So much same. I don't know if I'll drop Enduring off of most of my builds or not though. Pallet Stuns being a quick annoyance at best is p. nice. 
---
You gotta take what you can get without cosmetics
---
I’ve improved so much since this was taken! It took a while, but I got it.
---
With the way ping can jump this wouldn’t solve any issues, let’s say you’ve set your max ping to 150 ms, you join a lobby at 127 ms so you’re set to go, waiting for more players and as the last one joins your ping goes up to 173 and stays in that range (never going below 155 ms) until the match starts. Would you have stayed in the full lobby despite the ping being higher than you set? Would the system automatically remove you? What if you’re in game and your ping goes up? Do you get DCed because of the system or do you have to tough it out? Even then you can still just DC on your own. 
---
All I can say is wait for dedicated servers, it’s not that hard to be patient a little longer, hopefully the OCE servers aren’t just a glorified toaster.
---
I can't even buy it, it's only for shards for me lol, and below that "coming soon"
---
DS doesn't do anything vs a mori, so why should it now.
---
It's not available on any store yet.
---
Clown omegalul
---
What are the other perks?!! Are there any killer perks revealed? This is nuts lol
---
What are the perk descriptions though?
---
this is completely true
---
Because it’s so hard to unlock rank 3 when you already get double survivors bp every game. Nothing in survivor changes even matches the strength of BBQ. But ya know, gotta balance the game around 4 man SWF
---
Jesus fucking Christ y’all toxic
---
Yeah maybe its jsut my style of playing her. I found it to be the most effective when I was able to run around full charge, purge on someone and hopefully get them broken in one shot, and then m1. That method will definitely be more difficult to pull off now. That said I think I'm still gonna have a lot of fun with this killer. Love the design. 
---
It wasn't nerfed. McLean clarified that 128m still completely covers every map, they just needed numerical values on these perks for consistency sake. I imagine if we ever get a map larger than 128m Empathy &amp; others will be changed to compensate.
---
Fire Up buffs too. Actually seems pretty good. Curious to try it out.
---
This. The new killer barely came out and we already know who the next one is. 
---
I consider it BM personally to openly taunt hatch like that, matched with constantly attacking a hooked survivor. Not my cup of tea but whatever.
---
Lol, maybe not his potion but he still takes most skill then someone like Micheal lol.
---
I want that fukin perk
---
Ash Williams from Evil Dead. Pretty cool addition.
---
so the next dlc will be only paid with real money?
---
Ash Williams from Evil Dead? God damn.
---
There was once a chance for it to maybe be used. It is literally unusable now vs a killer with a Mori. 
---
Kinda lame no? That an offering can counter your entire perk
---
Yeah, depends on how you use the perk to be successful.
---
I agree with you. Seeing immersed survivors do nothing the whole game but UE around (even while another survivor is getting chased all the way across the map) then go down in 10 seconds, go to the corner of the map to heal, then return to crouching around is frustrating as hell.
---
If you’re going to be immersed, fine, but at least do gens for gods sake.
---
I'll keep it because it pairs nicely with Spirit Fury, and for those times I forget not to tunnel and get hit with a surprise DS.
---
Play how you want man. One of my biggest reasons for consistently quitting this game (and coming back because I hate myself) is because I used to main killer, and it would really piss me off to get complaints/get flamed at the end of a game when all I want the survivor to say is GG, because I know I played fair/not purposefully stupid as some survivors want me to.
---
I now mainly play survivor, and I think its because I let it get to me when survivors trash talk me (when I play killer). I know they're idiots and that they're wrong but it still annoys me when I'm told I played unfairly/improperly. I think the guy with the top comment has given you the only and best advice people can give you; you just have to grow tougher skin, or you're going to feel bad for playing killer properly, and its going to ruin the experience of playing killer for you (as I think it has for me). Best of luck, and try to enjoy it as best you can.
---
It could be like Bill and Leatherface and just be Ash.
---
“You have an unprecedented ability to escape the inevitable. When you are dying, 50% of your recovery progress turns into progress when the killer catches you, up to a maximum of 50% of the total.”
---
So basically up to 50% of your dying recovery gets converted to wiggle recovery. 
---
Not lame. Killers are meant to be stronger than survivors.
---
I did on PC, came here to see whats up.
---
They have accidentally added the next survivors perks into kill your friends, someone fucked up, as in NOT Jane. 
---
Pretty much.
---
Did the tier 3 version of the perks get stronger? If not then it wasn't a buff. It just make Tiers 1 &amp; 2 not garbage. But that shouldn't matter given once you're past a certain point, you should always expect everyone to have Rank 3 perks. 
---
Killers can be stronger than survivors without needing their perks into complete uselessness
---
Evil Ash
---
Not only that, he's licensed. They might not even have permission to mention his name yet. This is a massive fuck up on their part. 
---
No decent or useful survivor perks were buffed, though? The only survivor perks that got any meaningful buff were Kindred (which isn't that useful in the first place) and Technician (which is a noob perk that no one uses once they've gotten the hang of skill checks)... saying "a bunch of survivor perks were buffed" is really disingenuous and just incorrect.
---
It's even worse now than it was before. Previously it was 6/9/12/15 at rank 3, now it's 4/8/12/16. Since you're very rarely going to be able to keep all 4 survivors injured, it's worse.
---
BHVR TAKE MY MONEY. 
---
No you're wrong bad players dont cleanse totems and the killer is doing his job *yawn* it is not going anywhere.
---
Spirit below Huntress and in A tier, OMEGALUL
---
Holy shittt. They fucked up pretty bad huh
---
I mean, I wouldn't call it "bad", more so I am just empathetic and consider how my actions may be affecting others. I will fully admit that it's a pretty silly viewpoint to have if I'm playing killer.
---
R the killer perks there?
---
I guess you didn't play the test server because it will still be something you think about even without tunneling, it's a long time until it turns off.
---
all next years dlc will be licensed
---
Ahhhhh the frame rates are sooooo much better on console now my eyesssssss 
---
Hello again. I am finally going through old notifications. I can't read. Ignore what I said.
---
&gt;Spies From The Shadows: Added a 5 second cooldown when the perk triggers. Reduced the trigger range from 32/40/48 meters to 20/28/36 meters.
---
Noooooooo, they nerfed spies :( 
---
Tiers aren't sorted by strength. Spirit doesn't compare with Nurse in any way.
---
Looks to be coming! 
---
https://i.imgur.com/5DHpyxE.jpg
---
Then you’re wasting even more time than the original perk wasted.
---
Right on, I didn’t think you were accusing me :) 
---
My point about that was just that, in my opinion, there are features in the game that make it easy for people to be toxic. I.E. teabagging, certain perk stackings, 4 Claudette purple flash lights  etc.
---
And that I make an effort to not do any of those things because I don’t want to contribute to the toxicity 
---
I see what you’re saying, you’ve been playing longer than me (I’ve been playing about a year and a half) so you probably have a bit more insight. I agree, the backlash would be awful. I would most definitely stop playing because I primarily play with one of my friends. 
---
I think comms can be OP at times and I’ve been on the frustrating side as killer against 4 SWF’s but I still seem to get frustrated when I play killer games than I do survivor. Even when it’s a 4 SWF’s game 
---
sadly no
---
Awesome!! I'm stuck in the vets at the minute can't wait to get home now haha 
---
considering how survivors have been begging for better Kindred I'm going to say nah
---
and the devs need to buff less good perks
---
whether or not you think it's enough it's just objectively false that survivors got some nig ol nerf
---
They have been doing this for months and months now though p: I don't know why anyone is surprised... they keep making the game less playable for survivors..
---
You sound like you have no idea how game balance works.
---
im sorry but my brain cant handle a middle aged man being called Ashley
---
Out of curiosity - Does buying it with shards make a character only available for that user? Planning on buying DLC from PS store w money anyway as my boyfriend also plays and that’s what we usually do but just wondering. 
---
That’s very interesting anti sluggy hope it’s real. 
---
He's probably not because I don't know anything about ash Williams or evil dead either.
---
Why can nobody use Mic in game? Or is it set up to where if you dont have one you cant hear anyone else who has one?
---
Ill never understand the need to nerf DS. This supposed complaint where 4 survivors are using it and wastes all the killers time is something ive NEVER seen happen at any low, mid, or mid high rank. This must be something Rank 1ers cry about which has to be a fraction of the people playing.
---
Any skins for sale yet?
---
Someone's losing his job today.
---
lmfao
---
I know I'm saying that because I have no idea how this slip up happened. 
---
Someone is getting fired for this. This is a huge leak if it ends up being true.
---
Are you sure it means in stores later? I felt the same way as OP felt when I read the announcement... Pissed me off.
---
Fuckin groovy!
---
Is this normal? 
---
There is no in-game voice chat functionality. 
---
Not everyone plays the game 24/7 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
They literally did nerf survivors again though? You're.. literally lying if you try to say survivors weren't nerfed...
---
From experience, I would say no. 
---
True, but these images don't even look like placeholders. There's no missing text, no beta icons. These look ready at first glance. It's a definite confirmation. 
---
source?
---
Groovy.
---
It’s something that they have accidentally added, its new survivors perks, as in not Jane someone else. 
---
DEVS 10/10
---
I'm sure if they've already been working on it they have their legal ducks in a row.
---
It would be extremely stupid not to.
---
A possible tease/leak of a survivor from the Evil Dead franchise. We can only hope! 
---
(because survivors are fucking entitled)
---
Thank you for your extremely valuable contribution to discussion. :)
---
Is this the only Perk?
---
A leak for the next survivor, Ash Williams from Evil Dead. No idea if there will be a killer as well.
---
This seems like a decent perk but I doubt it'll be used much. 
---
Good fucking RIDDANCE decisive strike.   
---
Mines was under 12 minutes 
---
Same
---
Patch sizes for Xbox?
---
That’s so ironic. I brought my dog to the vet yesterday. They initially booked me today and I changed it. 😂
---
You're the one fucking sitting there as if there aren't buffs, fucking 4head
---
I’m on PC and this has been happening every match over the past few days
---
Probably one of Ash's deadited friends.
---
Mettle of Man, Flip-Flop, and Buckle Up
---
Holy shit I've been wanting this as a perk for so long. 
---
Yeah that's how Puppers was playing her, Monto and Noob did the short burst iirc. Def will be harder but you can probably still do it at loops
---
Next DLC is being leaked by mistake!
---
I can’t hear you over the sound of something flying over my head. 
---
My bad, lol
---
Fuck yeah. A demon killer would be awesome. 
---
Yeah I noticed this too. Thought I was going crazy.
---
no shitpost flair?
---
Just recently bought the game and played as a killer. First match, had two rank 1s, a rank 5, and a 16...
---
I’ve since not picked up the game since.
---
multiple extremely strong survivor perks were just leaked ffs
---
There’s another thread with pics of all 3
---
UM. Anyone else see some special things in KYF? This is the best booboo they've ever made. My DBD hype has returned!
---
Pics: (future DLC mega spoilers) 
---

---
DS is a crutch perk.
---
Same. I Love them. Not sure why anyone would hate them. I mean, sure, they're kinda bright, but it's worth having them.
---
Who would the killer be? Just a zombie?
---
Are there 2 more perks or was this one the only one leaked?
---
Ah yes, of course buffing some of the literally most useless survivor perks in the game while nerfing to the point of destruction the strongest ones over and over again is completely comparable to buffing the strongest killer perks over and over... this makes sense.. I suppose if you have no perspective...
---
Ash Williams hypeeeeee
---
Infinite values are impossible to code, so it was always a set value.
---
I'm guessing they just updated the text to reflect that value for clarity, it shouldn't change anything
---
Let me preface by saying that I am a Survivor main, I mean the only money I spend outside of dlcs on this game are cute outfits for Ace, but in my opinion killers definitely have it worse off. I don't envy them, I spent a brief stint as Killer not too long ago and within my first day I was getting 4 man P3 Claudette SWFs with purple flashlights and it wasn't fun.
---
Although, the ones who have it the best are the Nurse mains, you guys have it made.
---
Yea I saw :) I like the perks
---
No shit, go to kyf and see
---
They done goofed, it's not on the PC build but apparently it slipped through console certification. OOF
---
Leaked? Please explain.
---
If you meant "buffed" you are, again, just lying.
---
When playing against Plague, what is the gong noise that randomly happens? Does it alert her to where you are?
---
Huntress is a tier
---
You fuckers will never be happy unless survivors can kill killers
---
..did you miss the massive DS nerf?
---
 Mettle of Man, Flip-Flop, and Buckle Up 
---
Flip Flop is amazing
---
Perk based stuns shouldn’t affect enduring, so that means Head On shouldn’t either. Enduring is already great enough to eat pallets, especially with spirit fury.
---
Just started playing Myers and I’m having a hard time figuring out how to hit tier 3 and immediately get a hit when I’m chasing a survivor. I have T2 at 99% but do I need to be right behind the survivor for the lunge to hit or can I be a lil further? 
---
It’s in the store
---
Look in the store in dbd
---
Where the fuck is the new DLC in the Steam store? I can't find it...
---
Yeah, me and my sister do the same, buying it with shards usually only unlocks it for the one user only.
---
cant right now, but I just assumed by seeing a perk called "Flip-flop" lol
---
look in /new, genius
---
Ye but like the way to buy it from steam. Ik it's out for shards and stuff.
---
How do you accidentally leak a LICENSED dlc? This is proof they don’t check their patches.
---
Thank you :)
---
We need a perk that puts Exposed or Broken on survivors who double crouch within a certain time. No more teabagging xD
---
So I was in a game and this survivor who had kindred equipped dc'd whilst she was getting hooked and we ended up keeping the kindred effect for the rest of the game.
---
That lithe change though! Good! My experience using lithe was I'd be chased and fall out of chase for .5 seconds while I vault (for some god awful reason) and it would never trigger! So frustrating.
---
flip-flop and buckle up are the other 2 perks 
---
DS was a crutch perk, now it's a useless one ^^

Meyers is pretty scary if you watch his movies (and rob zombies Halloween) because of his extreme obsession with murdering his own family. He has been stabbed, shot multiple times including in both eyes and if I recall correctly, M60LMG for some reason, lit on fire, dropped from extreme heights, hit by cars, and he just keeps coming back for more. 
---
Freddy is pretty scary and for those who said the clown was scary because of rape and maybe a pedophile, that's what freddy was doing to children before being burned alive and becoming a demon. 
---
Doctor is also pretty disturbing and hands down my favorite killer. 
---
Legion just feels kinda dumb (sorry legion mains)
---
By short burst do you mean a bunch of quick fires? Was that more effective than just going for one big burst?
---
yeah i also dont see it on steam
---
That’s a shitty perk
---
2 things: 
---
1.my resolution is lower on ps4 after patch. 
---
2. Why do killers have queue times now?
---
Because money .. nuff said
---
What a stupid fucking perk on top of the fact that people are definitely losing their job over this. 
---
Where did you find this?
---
&gt; while nerfing to the point of destruction the strongest ones over and over again
---
haha you fucking drama queen holy fucking shit
---
wanna know how game balance works? there are fucking 4 of you shits. that has to be accounted for. multiple DS in one match is disgustingly strong which is why the change was necessary. devs are finally making the game fair for killers. hopefully they take care of adrenaline next
---
:(

Evil Dead is a cult classic horror film by Sam Raimi from 1981, and was remade really well in 2013. Basically a group of friends are in the woods and they find something like the book of the dead, and they recite some lines from it. Then everything goes to shit. A demonic entity of sorts is summoned.
---
Ash is the main protagonist. 
---
The movie is campy, and it's fun. It's low budget gore and guts. It's 80s terror. Please watch it. Or if modern remakes are your thing, the 2013 version is worth checking out. But it's very gory.
---
Ahh okay, thanks!
---
Perks themselves look awesome. It's more the survivor name that has me losing my shit rn.
---
They are just making perks like what they did with NOED. Tier 1 and 2 still give the effect but the 2nd part of the perk isn't as good at lower tiers
---
I think I see what you're referring to now. Sorry that I don't live on this sub like you must to see everything and expect everyone else to as well...
---
Anyway, survivors getting the first useful and good new perks in literally over a year does not change the fact that the devs have been buffing killers and nerfing survivors consistently for months and months now, giving killers useful and strong new perks consistently while giving survivors garbage, etc. and it doesn't change that DS was nerfed into the ground while killer perks got buffs.
---
So jealous. Tried to get it (adept Jeff) today, got normally out but no achievement. I used oinly his 3 perks. Lvl 10 Jeff...
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; It hasn't fully out yet. We're assuming they're waiting for it to be live in all regions first. 
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
I'm not familiar with them, forgive me. Where do they come from?
---
I’m always skeptical with “leaks” since I’ve seen so many fake ones in other games, but this looks pretty promising. It looks very professional and there hasn’t been a licensed killer in a while. If it’s a photoshop, it looks very good, and if it’s legit, amazing find!
---
almost none of my survivor matches have moris. you're screeching about a non-issue
---
Hahaha nice. I rang this morning and got lucky just to get a appointment.
---
The DLC isn't out in PlayStation store yet though.
---
It's in SWF on the PS4 version after the update 
---
As a big fan of slasher movies, I feel DBD could use some of the genre’s more salacious elements. 😏
---
Are you talking about when multiple people are on a generator? If that's the case  then working as intended.
---
Unless you're using Prove Thyself / Toolbox then you're going at 90% or slower speed. That's why the bar is red. It's indicative of personal repair speed, not the group effort.
---
I have the other perks in screenshots, how do I post them here on moblie
---
Preferably you want to be as close as possible to the Survivor so they have less time to react.
---
Simply be aware of your surroundings. If a survivor is close to a window or pallet where they can loop you or avoid getting hit then it might just be better to wack them and move on to a better target. If they are out in the open with no pallets or windows to run to then pop evil within and enjoy a down.
---
Omg I hope this is real I love evil dead sad Bruce put down the role but I can understand 
---
I don’t either 😂😂. But I keep up with news about changes to the game.
---
Ash Williams. Evil Dead/Army of Darkness/Ash Vs Evil Dead. 
---
SPOTLIGHT:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=074l4CHALcA 
---
holy crap! Jefe finally in the town! 
---
Those are the ones i seem to get i’m afraid. It’s gotta be the pizza 🤔
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD !!!!! YESSSSS !!!!
---
That’s pretty cool, wonder how this mishap happened
---
I like Legion!  It’s just fun to run around and make people bleed.
---
The best way to enjoy Ash, as a silent survivor with no shotgun or chainsaw and silent except for screams and grunts.
---
Amazing. I was excited for a moment to try it out, but now we are back to it being trash again. Thanks BHVR for helping me decide on which perks to use!
---
So? There are lots of end game perks that are useless if a killer uses a mori. 
---
Because a mori is one time, and a perk is indefinite 
---
It's not like it really mattered. Doing anything brought you right back to full sickness. 
---
As a killer when I notice a survivor farming like that I kill them and let everyone else escape 
---
Yes. That's exactly what i was talking about. Ew. Hate it so much. Loving the update tho
---
I really want this to be real but it seems too good to be true. They could do a deadite ash killer with it.
---
I cant wait for shirtless myers to drop and he have pepperoni nipples and a happy trail ending in spotty belly hair.
---
Do these perks work at the moment ?
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
&gt;you shits
---
Alright... I am not going to discuss game balance with someone who is so obviously one-sided and so incredibly biased. You are wrong, but I am not going to continue this as you clearly will only see things from your perspective as a biased killer player who openly hates survivor players and assumes anyone who disagrees with him must only be a survivor player due to your bias. Have a nice day! p:
---
Ah yes, your personal anecdote has certainly proven me wrong. I'll counter with, at rank 1its pretty much nonstop Moris on ps4 ^^ 
---
Im not screeching, just pointing out how useless the perk is now. Youre getting offended over a nonissue
---
Oh thank you! :) I haven't seen those. I guess I should check them out.
---
Seems like a long awaited balance update for the solo queue survivors, duh. /s
---
It’s real, and someone is getting fired
---
I just booted up the game on PS4 to check, the 3 perks are there in KYF. This is a definite leak.
---
It seemed like Feng might have been dodging BBQ but probably heard the hum get louder. Then was blocked because of the looping. Better to stay in than just offer herself to Huntress.
---
&gt; Anyway, survivors getting the first useful and good new perks in literally over a year
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha holy fucking shit
---
The game was DISGUSTINGLY broken against killers. you still have the biggest crutch in the fucking game, SWF
---
and again, DS was a disgustingly broken perk. That had to be changed
---
you can't just be like a fucking caveman and go "hurrdurr survman nerfed hurrdurr" you have to consider how it fits into game balance. but you won't because you're an entitled sack of fucking trash
---
and acting like killers have gotten tons of great perks is fucking lolworthy
---
good  god
---
I genuinely hate survivors 
---
Henrietta. She’s gonna stretch her neck across the map and swallow our souls. 
---
I call photoshop, motherfucker
---
They do ? Wow all these perks look pretty damn good. Hoping for some good killer perks to go alongside this.
---
Are the new *Evil Dead* perks seen in KYF real? Is that the next chapter?
---
Unless it’s Matthieu Cote narrating I’m not watching it
---
Wow, any leaks on the killer side?
---
I wonder if this means we'll be getting a new survivor before the next chapter? Also, are there new killer perks too?
---
These perks are fucking awesome
---
Leaked to the console version by accident. Someone is getting fired. 
---
go drown in shit 
---
Could you describe them please. 
---
I feel theres quite a big difference between maybe not getting to use a perk because of a lack of endgame, depending on how said game goes. And having a perk, seeing the offerings and knowing for sure it is useless for then on.
---
Can it be used in game? Just out of curiosity. 
---
As I said in another comment, you are wrong but I will not continue to discuss this with someone so incredibly biased and unable to see things from any other perspective than completely entitled killer bias. Have a lovely afternoon.
---
"I'll get around to it later..." 
---
keep being a brainless caveman
---
Good. Do the same with NOED and watch the heads of 99% of this sub explode.
---
They are literally in the current build of every console version after the update, these are not fan made, someone fucked up 
---
[This is what I can find](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Ashley_J._Williams_(Earth-818793). Not sure if that's the one /u/runeXstarr is thinking about tho. 
---
Bouffed
---
I believe so
---
Probably an attempt to help frame rate. 
---
Resolution is lower but fps is better no?
---
Probably a stand alone survivor DLC.
---
You mean fixing a seriously broken component of the game?
---
They better have Bruce Campbell voicing him
---
Probably a stand-alone survivor.
---
DAYUM, fat accidental leak
---
Anyone see if you can still get stuck in the temple map if the door closes on you? Read it once and skimmed it a second time.
---
Glad doctor’s pallets finally got fixed, I just leveled him up to finally have a build and it bothered me that they have been bugged for so long.
---
That's a bug that needs to be fixed immediately but then again they took forever to fix the no heart beat tinker all game bug. 
---
Tag leaks with spoiler tags my guy.
---
Could be survivor only DLC like leatherface. 
---
literally played a match two nights ago where all 4 players in a SWF cancersquad had it and got hit 3 times, but okay shitsack
---
They're actually there, yes. But not officially confirmed.
---
Those perks look really nice though.
---
I'm a rank one killer and can confirm that I've only ever once encountered more than one survivor getting to use DS in a match and it was only one other survivor, I have never had a match where more than two survivors had/used DS. I honestly think some lower level killers mistake a survivor wiggling free for DS.. p:
---
They first focus on generator and once it looks like they are set to escape, they'll cleanse totems, however, this only holds true for the SWF, I'd just not bother cleansing to be honest snd just get the generators done asap
---
Look in KYF right now then, the perks are there 
---
It’s in kill your friends for everyone rn 
---
How can I Instantiate my EAC client?
---
Freddy is definitely not better than Wraith. Wraith's and Freddy's powers fill the same role (easier first hit because stealth and, in Wraith's case, movement speed and a special lunge), except Wraith's is straight-up better and he isn't forced to set up and use his power if taking the time to do so would be disadvantageous. Freddy's also definitely not better than Doctor or Cannibal. All three have to just run loops and eat pallets, but Doctor buys himself the time to do so and Cannibal can get some pretty easy instadowns once he's eaten all the pallets in an area.
---
Clown and Trapper are certainly down there with Freddy, though. Clown's power is that he can shave one loop off most tiles (woopty-doo), and Trapper's power is that he can be tricked into wasting his time thinking he has a power. I'd say without add-ons it's Clown &gt; Trapper &gt; Freddy and with decent add-ons it's Freddy &gt; Clown &gt; Trapper.
---
It’s 100% real I’m on PS4 looking at them right now.
---
Yeah so we couldn't see the killer all the time, only when he was within the range of where the survivor was hooked.
---
They are literally right there in every console version. 
---
I’m sorry lol, but my hag is one of my tops 
---
Seen a comment elsewhere that confirms they actually work
---
Moonlight 
---
Doctor gonna slap that ass with his stick.
---
Anything for the killer? Or is it only the survivor perks?
---
Warp the tits and I'll consider it Kappa
---
Probably a survivor only DLC like Leatherface
---
I know I was joking, there’s barely any difference until you really get the gems done, but at least it fits the perk’s style :(
---
Are they useable in kyf?
---
Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me too much if Ash comes as a standalone survivor, similar to how they released Bubba. If there is a killer though, I'm very excited too!
---
I'm trying to stay calm because at worst, it could be up to 2 or 3 months before we see him. But if we're lucky he will be added as a paragraph within a month
---
I legitimately once had a ping of about 1000
---
I'm jk ik hag can be really good. I do predict Plague will be better than Huntress! 
---
Wait, you seriously think that’s a nerf? DS is now the biggest fuck you to a tunneling killer. 
---
The Plague cums wid tree purks
---
Ash and Evil Ash, I’m calling it now.  Hell, Deadite Ash from Army of Darkness would be awesome too.
---
mettle of man: after you get hit 3 times the next time you are hit you are unaffected
---
flip-flop: when you recover while in dying state that is converted to wiggle bar progress when picked up, up to 50 percent
---
buckle up: you can see auras showing how much recovery progress someone has 
---
Rip ds
---
Devs just tweeted it goes live today 
---
Rejoice for even in death you are all children of Haddonfield intro 
---
Oh I didnt realize that! I thought that was intended in ptb but was confused when we didnt get sick. Seems like a fair change. It's kinda cool how we can all infect eachother lol. 
---
I hope its Eligos!
---
You stand over the downed survivor, pause a sec as if you're going to pick up the survivor then do a quick search around to find the flashlight survivor to attack.
---
Maybe you shout git gud and pick up on movement and check common hiding spots.
---
Also starting pointless chases is still less effective than not having the killer chase anyone. Especially in the late game, having 1 person running away from the killer rather than not being found can cut your productivity in half. 
---
I play a lot of killer as well. If you suspect someone is hiding it's usually quite easy to flush them out.

Weirdly a lot of the dbd community aren't actually into horror films. Also, I imagine a large chunk of the community is pretty young and would probably consider evil dead an old film not worthy of watching. Their loss.
---
Mettle of Man, Flip-Flop, and Buckle Up are the survivor perks leaked in the screenshots in the post. Read them. No killer perks were leaked.
---
will there be season rewards in the future?
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
I’m a fan.  Spirit is a babe too though.  😂
---
I’d rather have a timer than constant flinging crows every moment of the game. 
---
I think theyd have to balance it out like with Bill + LF
---
Thats great, and Im specifically talking about my own experiences at rank 1 on ps4 ^^ trust me, it's a lot more than 3%
---
While I agree with you I feel like the devs don't know what they are doing with console optimization and I doubt they wanna invest in getting better team members to sort this out. 
---
So I'm confused. This tier list that you're making is a list of the killers you play well as? Only asking because you have Pig below Freddy.
---
Thanatopobia is buffed still. Just not as buffed as PTB. 
---
PSN Store only updates at a certain time, it’s not BHVR’s fault
---
Yep 
---
i mean , people use their builds accordingly to their playstyle for sure, there is nothing wrong with that. but using SB because you can be 'stealthy' it's a very selfish way to go about the game imo, being stealthy for your own sake, hurts the team on the big picture. you can't afford to be stealthy without hurting the team efficiency, you just can't. being stealthy hurts the team on so many levels. few examples: stealthy hurts the progression time, a stealthy player takes huges amount of the time to do objectives/saves as they only do things when it feels safe. other stuff like unhooking, unhooking and being stealthy leads to tunneling. if you come back to a hook as killer and the unhooker went immersive you will only see the unhooked running for his life. tunneling is caused by immersive unhookers 90% of the time. the killer wont spend any time looking for someone they can't see, you def need to use yourself as bait in order to save others in a worse situation than you, it's a critical part of saving team mates. The save it's not done after the unhook. sometimes you need to even take a hit in order to save someone, unhooking it's just not enough in some cases. if you are fully healed and you are leaving your hurt teamate at the mercy of the killer it's just poor decision making, that will lead to his death quicker, and the focus of the killer will be able to be on you afterwards, less players alive, means its harder for you to succeed on surviving.  i'm not here to chose the playstyle people use, as you see this 'stealthy' kind of players in every level/rank, but they do hurt the team overall. during the game, the killer wont be just standing or patroling, chasing is required. someone has to be chased all thru the game time, the person being chased obvs need to be on rotation, meaning everyone eventually needs to be doing the chase part  while others work gens. if all 4 players are 'stealthy' and no one is getting chased you are giving the killer little to none mental pressure with the gens being worked on a fairly slow pace as they have all the time in the world for gen pressure. that's a huge part when playing killer, you def play better with no pressure, knowing you have the game pace on control. in my expirience you need to be stealthy for 10% or less of the trial time imo. in most situations you cant afford being immersive at higher levels. also, you will never be good at chases if you keep avoiding them. 'if the killer come i hide' it's just selfish and overall not a viable option imo   
---
you cant afford to be walking or crouching in the majority of situations, you have a very little time window to safely unhook someone for instance, if you miss it, now 2 players are in danger. just my 2 cents anyway
---
How about don’t be a bitch and slug?
---
We're getting Ash?! It's a shame it won't really look like Bruce though
---
It is a straight nerf, though. DS used to be useful against all killers, now it is only useful against tunneling killers who manage to catch and hook you, assuming that someone rescues you. It's pretty much useless for solo queue now and a lot less useful in general.
---
Also DS used to be an effective way to escape from a camping killer but now survivors who are downed by a camping killer are just screwed again. So it's again significantly less useful than it was before.
---
It was nerfed severely and if it wasn't a severe nerf the killer players who are strongly biased wouldn't be celebrating it so much.
---
Not looking forward to playing against a nurse with infectious fright tbh. 
---
He probably just wanted the game over with. Sitting and waiting for you to repair 2 gens if they woulda farmed would have been boring. If he just hooks you game is over and you can both move on
---
Maybe they want us to spend more by buying cells instead of using money for the DLC pack?
---
Not another annoying insert random sound bites over a video.. this is getting really old. 
---
Then I'll pretend I didn't see you and talk away. If I'm Myers I might grab some evil off of you to tier up though 
---
Spies has been low key broken strong recently. I’m gonna miss knowing exactly where everyone is the entire game
---
Same for me on the regular PS4, noticed it right away when looking at Jane in the Store. This sucks :(
---
Your welcome :) oh and enjoy the new DLC
---
Is the Plague’s incense supposed to be bouncing/shaking on the menu, or is that a glitch?
---
Link? Haven't been able to find it
---
Moonlight
---
Why is pig so low?
---
It was more because it was a crutch perk that rewarded a survivor for failing, just like noed. A person could completely destroy any momentum a killer had with a well timed d strike. Add to that the God complex that a lot of ds users can have, and you have a perk that generates a rancid amount of toxicity from both sides: the people who rely on it as a way to piss off the killer, and people who feel they've been slighted by those who use it. Imho, it's more a nerf on toxicity. If it weren't for the toxicity surrounding the perk, it would've never gotten 'nerfed'.
---
But complaining about them balancing from the top rank down is a little asinine, imo, because that's where the highest skilled players are supposed to be, who can use and abuse perks to maximum effectiveness.
---
My dear Spirit is sCCinny. 
---
Yea exactly I think the devs must just play killer honestly they've been making it rough for survivors for awhile 
---
Hag *has* to do it sometimes. That's just a fact. And if you run Honing Stone on Trapper people need to spend time lying in dying state. And Devs intend it as genuine strategy, and it was already not even viable unless you play Nurse
---
And, again, if you down someone and more members of the team show up there's essentially no point in trying to get hits on them as they fuck around because it was just cause you to lose your down. this is just another perk that punishes the killer for playing the game
---
That's gotta be Garry Chalks voice.
---
They were going to buff it to max 24% speed reduction but considering legion is a thing they went back on that. It definitely didn’t need to be weaker though. They did the same thing with fire up for some reason where it’s technically “better” cause the max number is larger but that doesn’t really come into play so often so what’s even the point?
---
It's glitched. I just got the new achievement for repairing the gen in the Temple on PS4.
---
Ah well the reason I have that is because pig is so dependent on rng she can pretty much be completely ignored. Freddy, although bad isn’t really as bad as the memes make him, he has some decent mindgames, a free hit, a bit of map control, and imo he’s more fun than pig- which is not the reason I put him there. 
---
Played a round now, they increased the FPS on PS4 and it's now running way over 30fps now, but they lowered the game resolution quite drastically and it's way under 1080p even on a Pro. :/
---
I love her extra outfits. Cant stand her default cosmetic though. 
---
For PC users: Launch Dead by Daylight, select either the new Killer or Survivor and click the bottom right corner to open up the Steam Store purchase page. From there on out, you can buy it! Enjoy.
---
The new upcoming dlc
---
I replied to someone else with that for my reasoning 
---
is it tho? highly doubt that
---
It's always been one additional top for the survivor.
---
Might as well have.  
---
He gave me a good hit from the very beginning and then I managed to juke him in the shack and he lost me. 
---
Looted basement for a medkit, then started healing up, but he had Nurse's Calling, so a short chase later I'm hooked.  
---
cringe
---
holy FUCK this video with this edit actually made me laugh super hard, thank u so much for this gift today
---
any good ping filter would take all what you said into consideration. maybe averaging it out. but either all. if your ping is all over the place, i’ll consider that as shitty ping. plain and simple
---
Laurie thick. Until now maybe
---
Alls I remember was, “You wanna play a game?” “Fuck you” “Sounds like fun.”
---
Oh I already fixed it with verifying the integrity without deleting anything. Was poking fun at the fact that it happened after an update, so the update broke the game, and also at "instantiated" which is such a bizarre use of a perfectly legitimate word but in a way that is unexpected. :) I'm getting puked on already.
---
Is anyone actually gonna run it, though? It's competitive with Unbreakable, I suppose, but the very existence of that perk doesn't render slugging useless, either.
---
Yeah you just charge it for like a second and then let go, it breaks them faster than doing a long one and then medium ones
---
Do you know what time that is by chance?
---
Ashley Williams?
---
**We'll bang okay?**
---
now for the grand ascension. 2 pairs of sunglasses.
---
I just noticed this!!! So nice!! Thank you BHVR!!
---
I think they needed to test things out. Thanatophobia would be very strong with other perks like dying light and while it is not meta, it can create an unfun gameplay for survivors. 
---
the amount of NOED Billy i encounter in my games is TOO DAMN HIGH tbh
---
Or Jason Voorhees haha. (OK, extremely unlikely I know... but Jason Goes to Hell DOES imply that Jason may be a Deadite from the Evil Dead universe.)
---
If this is true this is another huge oversight this patch. BHVR being silly it seems.
---
Billy on Lery's, Haddonfield, or Badham is absolute ass. But I'm also terrible with Billy. 
---
I think so. It's going to be extremely strong in SWF which is how most people play
---
&gt; but the very existence of that perk doesn't render slugging useless, either.
---
I didn't say that.
---
Okay dude thanks for the amazing advice when i'm trying to discuss the annoyance and skill-less tactics on invisible players
---
Basically. She just now can't hold it to try and get an instant break the moment a chase starts. That's the major difference.
---
I've started to do this too.  Why b.s. around when you can end the match in no time so you can both move on to a legit game?
---
Someone just told me that survivors hooked will stay 100% sick. That means when we are unhooked we'll get the rescuer sick 🤢🤮
---
are you playing at peak or non peak when this occurs?
---
For all you guys wondering about leatherface too, I put him there because I think that he has more good things going for him than bad. He can insta down, now down pallets, has 115 move speed, and can hit multiple survivors at once. Tier lists are always going to cause some controversy since obviously not everyone agrees with your list, but I’d like to keep the thread more focused on how Plague could do once in live. Thanks
---
Good list but you need an extra tier at the top for Janes perks 💪
---
Post restored.
---
Two minute video of someone throwing down every pallet on the map, runs into everything whilst looking behind them, doesn't know how to loop and gets the buggiest 18 I've ever seen. All whilst playing against a Myers who pops T3 at 100 feet interspersed with sound bytes that everyone and their mum uses. 
---
Sorry, I sound like a cunt, but I can only imagine you made this because you assumed it was good gameplay. Also, what the fuck do perks have to do with this chase? Even rank 20s can throw down all the pallets, run the wrong side of loops and escape a shit Myers.
---
and you will be broken when you get off the hook right?
---
&gt; come at me with the downvotes LGBTQ+
---
You... you do realise that homosexual men aren't the only demographic of DBD players, right?
---
A man can be straight and admire David's bod.
---
I think they did the queue times to make match finding more consistent. You won't be able to tell who's swf and who isn't any more either so there's no use in lobby dodging. All survivors, swf or not, load in at the same time 
---
You can tell there are more survivor mains than killer mains based on these like ratios... survivor mains are so entitled they think killers are responsible for letting them win
---
fair enough. then you have the option of selecting NO LIMIT. just give us a players that want fair gameplay, a choice. 
---
I see them ? There’s one for healing 50 people whilst injured ? I’m on Xbox 
---
Huntress is quite map dependent. On some maps she'll be better by far but plague should be more consistant. Huntress also has more snowball potential. 
---
Wait like an exclusive top or a top from the store? How have I missed this bonus. 
---
Nice.
---
For those who don't know, leaks are as illegal as EU memes in the official Dead by Daylight Discord.
---
Sticc
---
Jeff is thiccc though 
---
What about corrupt purge lasting longer or puke staying on the environment longer? Based on your time in the PTB did this seem like a necessary change?
---
Then how come Hillbilly and Nurse are considered the best and no one talks about how “OP” the pig is? 
---
Slugging is the single most effective way to apply pressure and slow gens down.  Or would you rather reaffirm the meta that says that only Nurse and Billy are competitive?
---
There was talk about Enduring not affecting DS stun any more, which it will need, if the stun time is getting nerfed to the previous tier 1.
---
Yeah, fair point, but unless I'm wrong, for such a short game with just 1 hook, I think he'll depip too, so it's a lose-lose situations.
---
"Accidentally"
---
At what rank?
---
You definitely should! Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness are absolutely amazing! Evil Dead (original) is also great but the pure cheese/campy fun of the others is a must see!
---
Cool thanks for the feedback, I do agree with that- that they each have their own maps they excel in
---
I know the sounds were excessive but I added them in because without them it was boring, yeah I used every pallet but I outran his WHOLE T3 and to me THAT was an achievement.?
---
If im playing a killer and the survivor is just teabagging at the exit, i just wait and stare at the survivors and alt+tab watch youtube. It's so satisfying to occassionally tab back in to see them making a fool of themselves running around trying to get my attention.
---
There was once i did this and alt+tab to do work and 15 min later the guy was still in the game, when he finally goes out the exit, i just told him i watched youtube and did work and he said "fuck you"
---
Who cares if it was a waste of time (technically isn't cause i was doing work to get money). Im happy to get the last laugh
---
There’s nothing wrong with slugging and in some cases it is needed to win. This guy is over reacting on how this perk will effect slugging but there’s no need to call him names.
---
survivors don't give a fucking shit
---
Killers too if they didnt change anything from ptb, which is fine if everyone is rank 15 idc lol but matchmaking is bad so maybe that's the only way they could fix it?
---
Freddy is in my top 5 killers, he's a lot more effective going after multiple targets instead of tunneling one survivor, which a lot of Freddy's play that way, but even still is way below Amanda. Even though Amanda's traps are RNG, Pig is high to mid-tier on any tier list because of her mobility, ambush, and her ability to prolong the game. That's why I asked if you're making a tier list based on your own experience.
---
Either I'm misreading this or it's exactly what I think it is, after 3 hits you basically gain an additional hit? 
---
I can just imagine two injured achievement hunters crossing paths based on the first achievement 
---
According to the wording, yes
---
OOOO I see. Well, Having 1 really cool cosmetic for each survivor and 1 great cosmetic for finally getting rank 1 would be a little less intense. 
---
If you enjoy the game then give it a thumbs up on Steam! It is easy to give a bad review when you don't like something, but it is even easier to forget to give a good review when you've enjoyed it.
---
I will, thank you! :) I've heard of them before I think and meant to check them out, now I'll make a priority of it.
---
Is it really? That's what I've been looking forward to most of all and I haven't had a chance to play yet. Please say it's so! 
---
Nah you’re the only one in existence
---
I survived one match with no mither so playing surv is obviously easy af like how the hell can you even die as a surv lmao (crying and laughing emoji)
---
/s if it wasnt obvious
---
This fucking sucks for BHVR
---
Satan is that you?

---
Because average player is a potato
---
I personally like the change. I like how the game is informing me that it’s more efficient to work on one gen per person unless you have Prove Thyself.
---
Every killer takes skill. Give the game to a 3 year old and see if they 4k. 
---
Has that ever happened?
---
Can someone explain to me why people are saying this? I thought borrowed time was the counter to that.
---
I'm part of the EU...
---
Well, Britain so I'll have my ass covered eventually.
---
Believe it was buffed in the ptb 25% at max, which obviously was overtuned
---
They really made it worse for what reason??? I just want it to actually be usable 
---
When used right I'd say probably. It's really early days though so we'll have to get more time on her and playing against her before we say for certain though.
---
Obviously I butcher my DH *very* often but every time I recognize my mistake. “Oh my finger slipped, oh I got mindgamed, I should know better. Most of the time I get enough distance to add at least an extra 10 seconds worst case scenario. Usually it’s a few extra pallets or maybe a good long T wall loop. I don’t think DH takes too much skill as I’m a killer main. 80% of my collected hours is killer. If I can do it, Survivors sure as hell can. Honestly, if you are using DH into a wall it isn’t a good exhaustion perk for you. You are either A.) Not looking in front of you which is your fault and not DH’s B.) You misjudged distanced. If it’s A dip your head in an oven or something idk. If it’s B Lithe or BL are probably better exhaustion perks for you. Maybe SB but that’s for stealthy players. I dunno why you would put a rugby tackle on a stealth build.
---
Can you confirm it? I only heard that DS was both nerfed to 3s across all tiers and was being affected by Enduring in PTB, and can't find in Patch Notes anything about Enduring not affecting it
---
Who cares about pips? I'm not gonna bore myself for a few minutes when the game can be ended in 20 seconds just for a single pip.
---
Are these being found in KYf?
---
muh free escape
---
Nah man, Meg is still bae 
---
Yes
---
Also on psn NA
---
blocked is a very strong word, i see plenty of oppurtunity to make it out, when shes on the other side of the loop you can make it out just fine...
---
NOOO THEY KILLED THANATO
---
so basically it would grab the ping when it “buckets” players. look to see if it fluctuates.  average it and accordingly match you with the specified limit. 
---
Yessssss!!!! But the resolution has gone down. Oh well! I’d rather that than fps 
---
Well if you have been streaming from before the legacy update there’s absolutely nothing to worry about as you have proof of getting prestige 3 well before 2019. 
---
On the one hand I hope this is real because Ash is a great character.
---
On the other hand I don't want Mettle of Man to be real, it's hard enough playing non-meta Killers ;_;
---
Yes, Bill on PC
---
Yowza what a slip but that’s pretty cool
---
You can, you just have to buy them with cells/shards. Purchasable DLC isn't out yet.
---
Yes. Bill. And leatherface for killers
---
What’s the patch size on PS4? 
---
this bhvr here. let’s be real
---
You encounter a lot of mori killers, eh?
---
You mean my rank? Or time of the day?
---
Chili boi intensifies 
---
Cant have her cute stun noises nerfed 
---
You can probably still get a refund from steam if you disagree with policy changes. The 2 hour refund window is for automatic refunds.
---
decreased skill checks never seem to work for me. Survivors always get them somewhere around pf 10 - 20 % of healing/repairing.
---
God I hope so. Pinhead here we come. 
---
It’s not meant to sound entitled,  I apologise. I appreciate it’s meant to slow the game down and killers still need that, but all my logic goes out the window when I’m surviving well against a killer and suddenly all gens are done, and they fly towards me and suddenly I’m instadowned and pseudo camped. 
---
It’s just annoying and can feel like it punishes those distracting the killer while those who have all the time to find totems genrush and don’t bother to find any, then can get away scot free a good portion of the time. Get what I mean?
---
smh survivors always getting nerfed devs biased toward killers
---
“Especially since it affects mostly worse killers the most.” Maybe I’m reading this wrong but do you mean like that perks aren’t supposed to affect just the killer and only the survivors? If so you’re just wrong lol.
---
Is this for real? Evil Dead chapter?

"New idea" HA, no, no it's not

...Do you know what "final nail" means? It implies that there were previous nails which contradicts deserterkalak's characterization of my comment when they said "but the very existence of that perk doesn't render slugging useless, either."
---
HELL YEAH BOIIII
---
He did you a favor. Now you get less tryhard/toxic killers.
---
But seriously, I am not surprised that they managed to let a huge oversight pass by them.
---
Not lucky, just not blessed by Monty Python. Here you go lad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxRnenQYG7I&amp;t 
---
I gave you the full clip, instead of a mere 6 seconds at 3:45, aren't you special!
---
This pipping system seems super rushed and poorly implemented. It punishes players hard for others being shit.  DCs are already rampant, now it’s going to be worse than ever with players knowing they can fuck over their competitors by rage quitting. I’ve been screwed three games in a row as killer by people DCing. 
---
Already on Steam 
---
The sacrefices one must go through to look stylish. I'm full pink Ace.
---
Ok let me change that a bit. No killer takes much skill to play. But lots of killers take lots of skill to play well. You can run a no perk Freddy and 4k often at rank 20, that doesn't mean he doesn't take skill. 
---
That’s so strange, I reset my Xbox and they still aren’t showing up
---
Oh shit. It's the guy from evil dead.
---
I think it's trash now tbh. At least they need to remove the timer from it for me to use it. For now, borrowed time is better.
---
Flip flop is something I wish they added in without needing perks. It just made sense for some reason
---
I mean, I can confirm that those 3 perks are available in Kill Your Friends on PS4, I just checked on my own because I didn't believe it.
---
It's out - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1009820/Dead_by_Daylight__Demise_of_the_Faithful_chapter/
---
But are the frames better? I'll sacrifice looks for performance in a heart beat
---
Since the deadites are able to take human form and essentially “possess” others, would that mean we finally get a disguise killer somehow?
---
 ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ SUMMON THE CHAPTER! ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ  I NEED YOUR ENERGY!
---
This would fit with r/identityv as well
---
This + no mither + Dead Hard + old DS + SB = ultimate looper 
---
A little extra info, I started the match seeing this. 
---
Got killed FAST because I couldn’t see anything, it appears like that for every survivor I spectate. 
---
Was playing with a friend and everything appeared fine for him (while crazy for me, spectating him). 
---
It's very interesting how she is comparable to literally every killer in the game. Like they took a piece of every killer. But thank you for your input. Based on what i've seen i can see why you say sometimes its too short and sometimes too long
---
No just the top. The darker hair and really bright long hair, a long with the different colored shorts, are all uncommon/yellow cosmetics you can buy in the store.
---
the emblem system is terrible for killers, too. 
---
Pyrovision plz 
---
It's out now.
---
One transfers recovery in dying onto wiggle. (If I recover 30% before I get picked up my wiggle bar starts at 30%.) the second let’s you see how much a survivor has recovered in the dying state by their aura from 48 meters. (Red means none and white or yellow means that they are 95%.) the 3rd is very complicated. It increases the chance of being the obsession. The 3rd time you are hit the perk activates. Once activated the next hit that would have downed you will be ignored. The phrasing is shit so idk.
---
For some reason it seemed a little darker than the store one so I was wondering, thank you so much for replying!

---
* Please use a better suited subreddit for trading, such as /r/DBDTrade or /r/gameswap.

Get rid of overcharge and use Play with your food. Find the obsession and get 3 stacks of the perk. Then you're super fast and its easy if you use brutal strength 
---
This is crazy good dude!
---
post that in the official forums
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/bug-report-pc
---
So are the devs going to even acknowledge the graphics downgrade on ps4? It's absolutely awful and makes me want to uninstall. Not noticing a performance boost either. Why the fuck did they do this?
---
i thought you meant why was i tackling stealth builds , my mistake
---
Console doesn't even have bill, so idk about that one
---
There is no counter to tunneling, even BT IMO. You've already smacked the hooked person once, what's stopping you from smacking him again except for another chase, which will happen either case if you didn't smack the unhooker while he was danger-saving?
---
You must be extremely new
---
Praying for your rework 
---
You can only use the new perk in KYF, it’s not in the bloodweb.
---
lol that's total bullshit
---
i don't know what devs did but they fucked up killer hits in a big way
---
Why not add a time ban for people that DC? Like 30 min timeout, might keep people from DCing just because they rather leave the game to join a easier lobby.
---
Yeah, length of being hit by the vomit doesn't break them faster, number of times does, so doing bursts is ultimately better. Holding it for a long one for the initial hit was really good if you expected them to already be running or have sprint burst/balanced.
---
Ah, no. DH is a rugby tackle. I was saying that it would be weird to have a literally tackle in a stealth build.
---
HOLY SHIT I'VE WANTED ASH FOR SO LONG HOLY SHIT!! I was kinda hoping one of his perks would be "This is my boomstick!"
---
So they already nerfed The Plague. Awesome. God forbid we have another strong killer. Ugh. 
---
Yeah I saw the other posts. Appreciate the reply tho.
---
You give me too much credit there’s lots of nice people it’s just that as a killer so many can seem mean because they’re doing their role. I also don’t understand why the vast majority of wraiths camp hooks, when you have massively increased movement speed in cloak mode and a perk to track injured people down
---
AH I REMEMBER THAT NOW.
---
Atleast beads spirit is genuinely scary and you can try to run spine chill to counter.
---
I don’t think we’ll get a killer, I think it will be like Leatherface, only a survivor this time.
---
Np. 
---
I don't think we will get any killers. We have gotten stand alone DLCs, Leatherface. OFC there might be a killer, but I hope that we get a survivors stand alone
---
His dead gf would be great. The time for a demon possessed killer is now. 
---
I was the obsession in my last game and I dont run DS. The Huntress only had Lullaby and nothing else. My perks were: adrenaline,balanced landing , alert and kindred. Which of these gives you the obsession O.o?
---
Ooh okay, thank you! 😌
---
Yeah but again it only proves that NOES basically serves for the purpose of shortening the skillgap. If the killer is skillful enough they won't need it chases (which aren't meant to last really long to begin with). Also there is already the Adrenaline perk for situations like that you've described with Adrenaline + Hope combo to counter it even more.
---
But in the end, you are supposed to break LOS and hide, not being chased all match by the killer who can't catch you. Loops while being a current meta are still an exploit of killer's bigger collision.
---
And trust me, I'm being frustrated about the killers who just chase you for eternity until you're finally downed even if 5 gens are being fixed meanwhile, but they are already punished by the game's rules enough for it. 
---
Still, YAAAAAY
---
whoops?
---
By the way, you can find them in the Kill Your Friends bloodweb. This is only one of them (sorry the quality is so bad)
---
Sprint Burst counters her stealth charge completely and Spine chill will alert you to her if shes sneaking up on you
---
I didn't notice better frames. They seem the same to me. Anyways, the devs should be able to increase frames without making it look like a ps2 game.
---
*screams in Bruce Campbell*
---
I'd love this, I hate searching for a game, having 300+ ping, leaving, finding a new one, having 300+ ping... rinse and repeat until I find one under 100.
---
Just completed game as Bubba on the spirit estate. Had 60 fps all game. 
---
Those are good points. I wish people would try though! Huntress with instadown hachets terrifies me, so I try to go slowly and avoid her. Once she’s chasing me, I’ve only got away a few times. I can see how some would think “fuck this” and DC though that’s so inconsiderate of people who may have brought some offerings they’ll lose or would just like a semi-fair trial. With Moris, you can’t see those coming right? That’s why I like them (if they’ve already hooked me at least once; if not it feels unnecessarily cruel).
---
I think Doc and Legion aren’t too hard rank 10 and up and never see nurse. I’m not high ranked though and only play solo. I feel like SWF would make this game so easy. What really sucks is if you’re with a three person SWF group and all DC right away.
---
Maybe ban intentional DCing all together? Except you couldn’t prove they weren’t having computer/internet/console issues, so that idea is dead too. 
---
If you listen carefully you can hear the yelling at BHVR trying to figure out how this happened
---
 I mean if you think about it kinda makes sense, names are the same and plus the mettle of man perks talks about how evil always has a way of finding you and what not 
---
First of all – this is like the 100th post about this topic. Second of all why do you have to spoil it for everyone? 
---
Ash from the movie Evil Dead.
---
Leaked survivor. Ash Williams from the Evil Dead movies.
---
Ash Williams from Evil Dead, must be a leaked chapter
---
Yeah they better revert it. Its absolutely horrible looking. No mention of it in the patch notes either...
---
That actually made me laugh lol
---
No biggie :)
---
I want to first focus on one part of your statement, what makes bbq overpowered in today’s gameplay? We have multiple counters to it now that it’s terribly easy to avoid having your aura read. Not only does positioning behind generators still prove a bit effective, we have a perk dedicated to countering auras (Distortion), And you can just go into lockers to block all aura readings. To call bbq op in this day and age is just a huge overestimation of the oerk’s Power. 
---
Before we get into what makes DS stronger but different, please give me insight to what makes bbq op. 
---
The killer was there first. Meg dropped from the baler to take the hatch from behind, but got stuck.
---
I think it'll be like the bill chapter and only be a survivor.
---
So i played a match with the Clown, the fps is better but you better have good eyes to see anything now. On a big screen it's close to unplayable for me at least
---
The worst thing is I also sit in red ranks as killer. I don't want to play killer anymore because I have depipped due to survivors suiciding on their first hook. Like each team can fuck each other over at red ranks. If the killer gets looped by one guy all he has to do is facecamp him and everyone will depip because they can't get any benevolent points. If survivors suicide on hook killers can pip either. The whole system is flawed.

---
Much Thanks
---
Personally I like this but I think cleansing totems should have a worthwhile effect outside of countering NOED. It’s unfortunate enough that you have to guess whether or not the killer has it, but if they don’t then all you really gain is some extra bp. I’m not sure what but there should be some gameplay aspect that they affect one way or another imo.
---
I call publicity stunt or disgruntled employee
---
I think the issue with that is that Dying Light is a god damn miserable perk since it encourages tunneling and once it activates it just removes any semblance of fun from the game.
---
Buffing Thanat a bit was a decent idea, I doubt it would have been too overwhelming. Sad to see them go back on it.
---
*cries in console*
---
I lost a pip when I got 16K blood points. This new system makes no damn sense at all. It seriously needs to be changed soon
---
Does that mean the Cabin will be the next map? Mmmm, yes PLEASE
---
I knew the chapter after this was going to be licensed. Anyone else remember those posts before the new DLC showing that BOTH dlc 11 and 12 were having files uploaded?
---
For a second I thought it was a shit post since it looks like the infinity gauntlet 
---
That's because no one cares about us console users
---
I have seen the term paragraph used a couple times about this. What exactly is a "paragraph"?
---
It can in KyF. I tested it
---
no u 
---
I meant that no one uses the acronym. People usually call it nurse's for short. I use this on hag and spirit. 
---
Yes sir!
---
K, just never saw anyone post about it before so I thought it was remotely close to “new”
---
Maybe Ash Killer and Ash Survivor. Who knows? Legion can be more than one guy, Ash can too! 
---
&gt;Foxtrot4504
---
Ya, but you don't always know who exactly is who
---
I believe that a game designer had said somewhere (in an interview maybe?) that they wanted Enduring to not affect it, because they wanted to DS stun to be 3 seconds, the same as if a Survivor actually escapes just by wiggling. I'll try to find a source, but it might take a while, I can't remember where I read it at the moment.
---
Is it possible this an intentional leak?
---
No FUCKING WAY
---
that is so fucking HYPE
---
It's sucks but it's still pretty hype!
---
It just happened again with a trapper. I did 1 gen while someone was chased. 2 gens pop he downs his obsession then rage quits.
---
I had played a game in between the game of this post and pipped in it so I know it is not a visual glitch.
---
https://imgur.com/a/hqI5ZXJ

Huh? What does this mean? I havent played the PBT
---
Did you try to play with them? 
---
With everyone on here spamming about fedora man bad its fine if you still think freddy is bad. It took me a while to realise his strengths as well. Try playing him with range addons and the green dress (the yellow addon) and go for a more spread the pain type strategy, how legion was meant to be played. Get as many people in the dream world as possible, and be switching targets constantly. This guide helped me a lot on him: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628612661

F-MEGA
---
A 'Chapter' consists of a map, killer, and survivor. A Paragraph contains 1-2 of those three.
---
Ps 4
---
Tbh, having a no-cooldown detection perk with that kind of precision would be very nasty. I was already shivering when that thing launched with no cooldown (remind yourselves that it has a 100% chance of triggering now).  
---
  
---
Didn't see the range nerf coming tho
---
also with buckle up, you and your friend can both see the killer aura for 6 seconds
---
Gonna pair really well with Dead Hard.
---
No, because it's too situational so I still don't care about it. I'm still happy they nerfed it though. 
---
NOED used to be on a timer, it was changed because everyone would hide until the timer ran out and then went for the door
---
The ping problem is just because the new update to matchmaking. It's been going on for like a week or 2
---
All of the quotes are from the Ash vs. Evil Dead tv series, so if there is a killer it will most likely have to be something from that show. I honestly think this is just a paragraph, though, based on nothing but intuition.
---
Lol at Mettle of man. Finally a good reason to uninstall the game if that garbage actually makes it in.
---
F for the worker who fucked up
---
Have a feeling this is a paragraph, not a chapter.
---
Mettle of man with dead hard oh dang.    
---
Also flip flop is sick I'd totally run that.
---
There should be some effect for each totem cleansed
---
i play on a laptop. [i sympathize.](http://prntscr.com/kf2iz0)
---
I wish they buff DS in next patch to be not affected by Enduring
---
I love those. No more running to heal a dying random survivor only to find out they haven't recovered and then you both die.
---
OPEN THE GAME
---
Amazing news but it is hard to imagine Ash as defensless survivor. He is a force of nature. Can not imagine some whimp Legion killing El jefe
---
Is this serious advice?
---
Personally, I like "fuck looping" killers. Spirit, Nurse, Legion, Huntress on her good maps. Running around a wall isn't fun for me.
---
Hail to the king baby
---
I already run both of those perks so if this is a real perk that will be released then I'm going to be very happy :&gt;
---
I’m thinking that maybe behavior leaked the dlc on purpose, but it might be an accident
---
Thanks, I hope they patch it soon, I just had a game with a bubba and he hit me like 7ft away from the window I vaulted through.
---
A few reasons why this isn’t a good idea:
---
1. NoED is balanced right now, but actually used to be terrible because it functioned the way you’re suggesting it should. At tier 3 NoED used to be 120 seconds of exposed before it wore off, making it a less than useful perk since survivors can just wait it out. What you’re suggesting is a worse version of what it used to be
---
2. Why is anyone staying behind, as soon as the gates are open you should just leave unless someone else is downed/hooked, in which case everyone on the team should be hunting for the hex. Most of the time, killers using NoED will hook one person, camp, lose their NoED, and lose the kill they would’ve gotten with NoED. 
---
3. Why do survivors waste time cleansing dull totems for a maybe perk in the event the killer  even has it and manages to hit someone, even though less than a third of killers run it
---
Flip flop is one they’ve talked about in the past. I think it could be useful
---
did they patch it out? i cant see it
---
Come on, seriously? 
---
I have some good news for ya :)
---
if this is console exclusive well...
---
**i'll quit dbd**
---
Yeah I'm still a little new to reddit, my bad lol
---
I'd kinda want to know what caused it in the first place
---
I've been playing for a while. I was sweaty when I first started but after a while it just became more fun to roleplay the killers
---
Honestly I wouldnt mind NOED if it just told you you were exposed the second you finished the gens. I dont like the perk overall, but not knowing is my biggest issue. 
---
First off bbq is not global, it has a natural dead zone of 40 meters which on some maps is natutally easy and depending on the killer you know you’re safe by hearing a terror radius. Distortion also does have a limited use of three tokens however when your first token gets consumed, that’s enough information right there to tell you to either prepare to hide in lockers or get close depending on where you are when someone gets downed. The fact you get that information at all is all the counter you need to avoid having your aura read for the rest of the game unless you’re pushing your objective and it’s worth burning the token. 
---
The rest of your statement on bbq is about the bonus BP the killer receives. That has nothing to do with balance of the perk in this case. The stipulation of the tokens comes from finding a new target as an soft anti tunneling/camping incentive. Bringing up no survivor equivalency is missing the point of my question entirely. Do you actually think bbq is op or do you just have a bigger issue with BP gains on either side? 
---
Because if it’s the latter, then I agree. Survivor BP is fucking terrible but pointing at something like bbq is not the correct motion to push for. Look at how only two survivor perks give decent BP increase and one of them does nothing in trial. Prove Thyself still has a stipulation but WGLF has no in game benenfit and does not offer a reward for anything analogous to your main goal of doing gens; only unhooking. 
---
Now about your other previous post about the whole DS nerfed into uselessness, that’s simply incorrect. It’s significantly more synergistic with other perks, allows for the same amount of escape potential and handily punishes a killer for tunneling and even to an extent camping because those two are frequently together with bad killers. The fact you’ve never used DS before it’s change also shows that you truly don’t understand just how much of a comfort blanket it’s power provides. I can’t debate you about how it’s power is in a much better place when you’re talking from a place of no experience. 
---
This is going to be a divisive question and I'm terribly sorry for whatever conversation may occur;
---
Am I the asshole for camping in this situation? For context, I'm new to killer but I spent my first year or two of DbD playing Survivor. The situation is as follows:
---
I was playing The Cannibal and I hooked my first survivor within a minute of the game. The rest of the survivors surrounded the hook the moment I placed their friend. BBQ didn't show any auras at Rank 3 and an Ace spamming flashlight at me basically told me they wanted to unhook the person. I had to sit and watch the hook while 3 survivors tried to sneak around and save them. It felt horrible because I know how shit it is to be camped like that, but there's nothing else for me to do but walk away and let them save their friend.
---
I got chided in the end game lobby for not walking away to do something else, but I'm 90% sure there's nothing else TO do. Am I the asshole or are there really survivors out there who want killers to play like idiots for their fun? Was there REALLY something I could do besides feed into a rescue attempt?
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks! 
---
I did, Flip Flop is fun and when I played killer one of the perks caused my friend to glow white and it ignored my hit on her. It's bascially Dead Hard 2
---
Shit, they do?
---
Where did you get this shot of his face? Is this in the files?
---
Groovy
---
These sounds really freakin good
---
That's insane. I hope that's a bug and not intended... 
---
New ranking system in general is crap. I'm in green ranks as survivor and you pretty much HAVE to get hook saves or you are not pipping. Got iri lightbringer and unbroken + silver evader. Didn't get any points in benevolent cause the killer was complete trash and never got anyone. This would've been a little over a pip in the previous system.
---
Right, because more toxicity is so healthy for the game...
---
Follow the common denominator. If it keeps happening constantly to you several times in a row, then it might be a problem on your end.
---
Make certain you aren't blaming others for no reason. For all we know your ISP could be having a problem or maybe your copy of the game bugged due to the new matchmaking. My game bugged when they started telling everyone in the game that the obsession was being chased. That little wiggle and new lines of code made my FPS tank and net connection drop EVERY time I so much as looked at the obsession. So it is a possible bug, an ISP/modem/router problem, or the netcode.
---
Make certain it isn't on your end before accusing others.
---
They also stated they never used DS before so, honestly, they’re talking from a complete space of inexperience. Also bbq is only for the BP gains at this point. The aura reading is just to help with that don’t camp incentive. 
---
My bad, it’s only on console apparently? 
---
Based on the quotes i believe this is going to be from evil dead the show. But i think this would be an amazing opportunity to drop the first ever licensed cosmetics. There are a lot of great outfits from the movies he could possibly have

---
Nah, I just got it from google images. It's of an action figure, I think.
---
Das racist
---
Think it's from an Ash figurine. No character model leaks yet AFAIK?
---
Your are the savior 
---
Yet I get hit while tanding behind a killer
---
Well, on the bright side it means you don't need to level him to 40 as his perks are general pool...
---
yeah they're just fucking lying
---
Ight, who's getting fired?
---
They have a history of doing this. They were banning people who even *mentioned* the Saw leaks last year
---
What do you mean loops are an exploit of killers collision?
---
Basically.
---
Yeah it's kinda aggravating rn, hopefully they can fine tune it over time
---
Ok I am screaming because I’ve been praying for a perk that lets you convert dying recovery meter to wiggle meter! FUCKING HYPEEEEE
---
I wanted to say Hex protector :D Gen protector builds are the best on Shelter Woods as it's small and have an open center part
---
Did she maybe use Dark Devotion on the obsession before you got to the unhook?
---
Evil ash is a good possibility 
---
God i hope not, getting one of the fkin monsters from evil dead would be awesome
---
Damn what a horrible group of people. We've all seen our fair share of toxic swf but this is terrible
---
1. I see, of course they could make the time limit longer. Or instead of making a time limit. How about for each cleansed totem, the speed buff is reduced? My idea is more to, cleansing totems actually weakens NOED somewhat.
---
2. Indeed i agree survivors should just leave. But i do believe NOED’s counterplay is too rather difficult to achieve for solo players.
---
3. Sure there is really no need to cleanse dull totems just for a chance of NOED. But by the off chance the killer actually does have it, it does contribute to weaken  the said perk. Which is a good thing 
---
Saying a lie over and over doesn't make it true. Every official stat ever released has shown that Killers have always  had the advantage.
---
It's a survivor DLC, there's no killer
---
What data are they even collecting? What I buy in their shop? Also what ads?
---
How likely is Bruce Campbell to give his likeness? Is he historically known to be liberal in giving away his likeness? 
---
Yeah, this frustrates me a lot too.
---
It’s probably going to be the show version of Ash due to the quotes of the perks.
---
Borrowed Time works specifically when you are within the Killer's terror radius, not when they are within a certain range. If they don't have a terror radius for whatever reason (Monitor and Abuse, Dark Devotion, crouching Pig, invisible Wraith), then Borrowed Time won't work
---
Yeah this is just awful.You played awful but he played worse.That is all there is.You camped every pallet and showed absolutely no skill.
---
&gt; Global aura reading is O
---
hoo boy do I have some news about some survivor perks for ya
---
This is the type of shit that happens on console lmao
---
This is legit?!
---
which leaks?! I need moar context please 
---
I thought the resolution thing was trolling... until I loaded up the game. Wow.
---
That Mettle Of Man perk looks devastating.
---
I'm getting leatherface already, don't worry (BBQ)
---
Where the hell you getting your 1/3 stat?  NOED is in at least 2/3 of my games.  Every baby killer in game runs it since the level 1 instadown change.  I'm usually surprised when they don't have it at this point.
---
Well that’s pretty cool. *reminds myself to see evil dead*
---
#EE-ONE-D COUNTDOWN STARTS
---
They're likely to go for a *similar* looking face model, if BHVR's track history is anything to go by.
---
The problem with this is that when the exposed effect is applied everyone hides and becomes super stealthy/immersed. I’m guessing since you have “shape power” you know what I mean lol.
---
They would only come out once they see someone has been downed... 
---
I don’t really like the perk, but it’s pretty much balanced in its current state. Everyone knows there’s s chance of NOED.
---
every official stat? what the fuck are you on about? if you're talking about the escape rates thing devs put out once that was a trash stat that didn't control for disconnects and hook suicides
---
Gotta get that sweet sweet karm--eerrrr awareness! Yeah, gotta create awareness!
---
I think this is going to be a page rather than a chapter (like the cannibal) since no killer perks have leaked and it's very early for the leaks to begin for a full chapter.
---
Sort the subreddit by new.
---
I guess, but I don't use Unbreakabill and BT I don't use it very often
---
I honestly think that flip flop is way more fair than DS. It's a counter to slugging obviously.
---
I love all 3 of those perks, wow.
---
Its a dreadful perk thats a meme nothing more
---
Depends on your play style, laurie has perks for people who like to chase the killer and myers is very fun and dynamic. Pig is really good when you learn exactly how she works. Tapp looks cool but his perks are eh. 
---
Idk why people argue just to argue on here sometimes. Like I get opinion but in some cases they’re just flat out uninformed or blinded by bias. 
---
Oof. It can’t be that bad right? I mean as a killer main...
---
Calm down lmao it ignores the hit. It's reliable dead hard with way more set up.
---
I'm talking about getting insta downed from full health state. 
---
Yeah it seems to be broken... unless they changed something and I didn't realize.
---
Seems like it, survivor perks got accidentally released in PS4 KYF 
---
Yeah, like I said I waited for it to light up, double checked and everything... Gonna keep trying with it for now see what happens
---
They'll never nerf or "balance" NOED because killers would complain too much. I'll get downvoted for saying it, but it's true.
---
It is up for official sale though. You can buy the DLC in the Steam/PS/Xbox stores now.
---
Reeeeeeeee!!!!
---
I honestly doubt they ever release a new chapter without a killer. The hype always surrounds the new killer
---
I'll gladly take another Red Forest map over another mess like family residence or Mount Ormond
---
Yep. It was leaked in KYF matches on PS4 I believe.
---
BHVR fucked up. Bad.
---
This is No0b3’s big ear head ass
---
Based on perks: 
---
Laurie: great if you want to get tunneled or you are good at looping
---
Shape: obsession reliant perks is something I don’t like. Good killer at most ranks, iffy at red ranks.
---
Tapp: perks are pretty bad imo. Great for meme builds though.
---
Pig: Make your choice is one of the best perks in the game. Surveillance is good too for gen protector builds.
---
TLDR: depends on your play style.
---
I will certainly try it, thanks for the tip
---
Ah, are they functional right now? 
---
Did she have insidious? In order for it to activate you have to u hook while in the terror radius. If they have insidious, they do not have terror radius. Same thing with a cloaked wraith, or anything else that suppresses terror radius.
---
Lol
---
That might be a possibility, but there was only me and the guy that I unhooked near the killer. And the guy I was unhooking wasn't the obsession. Weird.
---
Confirmed. Didn't get my adept Jane or Temple gen one.
---
Before bashing the new killer we should at least give her a week to understand how to counter her. It's still pretty easy to loop her, if anything it makes it almost impossible to hit you with her damaging vomit.
---
Why am I always matched with Japanese players dispite being in south america?   
---
i´m getting nothing but asians, i can´t play!!! (PS4) 
---
"less than a third"
---
LOL
---
We have 2 red forests. We have like 7 autohavens, coldwins, and macmillan’s. They aren’t just now getting lazy.
---
I prefer Michael over the pig but I’d rather have tap then Laurie. You sure you can’t just buy both?
---
It was a toxic, broken perk and you know it.
---
I prefer it now anyway, easy punishment if I get tunneled.
---
Alright it may be bugged. Sometimes you can't fix all of the bugs. Plus i didnt see a lot of people running the perk in the one thingy(can't think of what its called at the moment)
---
Wow, your perk ideas are very good. I hope they add them to the game next chapter
---
^/s, ^in ^case ^you ^really ^need ^it.
---
Just a visual bug tho, it still had to be minutes. Just tried this with a "get chased with Kate Denson for 2 seconds"
---
yeah, it was broken on the PTB. i don’t know why they didn’t fix it when getting it to the live version.
---
Not bashing, just saying that its not fun 
---
OOOOOOOOF AS A FUCKIN DWIGHT MAIN I USED TO HAVE FUN WITHOUT GETTING FUCKED BY SOME HILLBILLY SO I FUCKIN HATE THE DS REWORK
---
I would say go with halloween but check that 'chaserly' dude's comment. He has a point about make your choice. Amazing perk and pretty much one of the biggest reasons i bought saw
---
I consider camping alright if there's obviously a team of survivors about to rush the hooked survivor. Don't beat yourself up about it in my eyes you did nothin wrong
---
Oh I know they've always been lazy.
---
Now: Pls tunnel me
---
It seems like such a good 'fuck you' perk though. Like you could just be completely safe, they don't even know you're in there but you bonk 'em with the locker anyway just too spook them or w/e.. That will be my usage of it anyways if I can get it working lol
---
Reeee Lol try playing like that loser
---
Ah that explains it
---
I thinl tapps stake out perk is really good for gen jockeys
---
Bro, me and my friends thought it was a joke when that one Russian name showed up in our xbone session. We just went along with it and him having 300 ping. Not even 5 games later, we get another killer with the exact same Russian alphabet in his name. 
---
I wonder if we'll get a monster from Evil Dead or just Bruce Campbell.
---
The map is not lazy at all? you must be high.
---
I seriously only see killers with NoED after rank reset, whenever I’m back to rank one I don’t see any. Almost all of them run nurses, ruin, bbq, and franklins 
---
...the difference being all of those map variations are one killer's realm.
---
Pretty much confirmed with adams quotes on all the new perks
---
Can I host meme review?
---
Can’t speak for 60fps but the game absolutely feels smoother now.
---
PS4
---
The problem would be the next best word IMO is Initialize which is already predefined.
---
Basically instantiated means it’s created/exists but initialized would it already exists but hasn’t started up/setup. 
---
Crotus Penn.
---
This is a garbage perk. The other two seem good though. 
---
Hm. Good to know. Its a new update though, so some bugs are to be expected 
---
I do like being chased, I also don't think obsession perks are that great and make your choice seems awesome... May be getting both of them since I can't decide...
---
i saw this Pic for National Laughs day.
---
this is how it feels to be loved by the new killer
---
Bad Ash.
---
"I get caught by the killer a lot so i need an entire extra chance to be downed, this game is unplayable now!!"
---
lmao just read that and reflect
---
No Elon, you already had your turn.
---
Oh my god this is really happening, holy shit
---
Oh....... 
---
Good.
---
The Spirit did crack i guess
---
This is why people hate SWF.
---
4 DS and 4 instaheals, powerful medkits, purple flashlight and a map offering.
---
So they nerf survivors and solos get punished for it.
---
I feel games like these are why ebony moris exist.
---
I may be getting both of them since I can't decide... Thanks for the help!
---
Don't forget Freddy too. Legion's best friend.
---
These perks are in the game files they were leaked
---
agreed. It's not a great perk but i actually really enjoy using it lol nice synergy with diversion too
---
We've already had proof of that for a *long* time now
---
Kind of a weird choice if you ask me. A character arguably best known for his witty dialogue and fucking CHAINSAW HAND and SHOTGUN being put into a game where human survivors don't talk or get to fight back with conventional weapons.
---
Steve: "Hey John, go increase the Halloween music intro from 2.3 to 2.5 please"
---
John: *typing:* sed -i 's/2.3/25/g' /src/models/shirtless_meyers/../../maps/hadonfield.cfg
---
Steve: "Hey, deaf Ivan, did you have a chance to verify the latest patch before we release it?"
---
Ivan: "...."
---
It’s not that great tbh
---
Well, I could buy both....
---
It's pretty much only good for memes but they definitely need to change some aspects of it... like increasing the range and also giving it a completely separate cooldown from exhaustion. 
---
Isn't it capped at 20%?
---
Oh.
---
I REALLY hope this doesn't upset the licensors and keep us from getting the chapter. :S
---
I see. I play trapper and i was just skulking around and trying my best like charging and trapping too. Thank you for the positive comment i was expecting sweaty pig mains to be reeeing at me so thank you.
---
I think it’s bugged and gives someone obsession every match. I’ve played multiple games where there were no obsession perks or add ons involved and there is still an obsession. 
---
Yeah like literally more red forests and autohavens.
---
He's attempting humor
---
It’s pretty damn smooth now. The reaping has begun
---
IMO, Mettle of Man is pretty garbage, but the other two are great.
---
Yeah, if I see the same 3 people and im chasing them down all day, then that last dude, I'll hook em. Always. Running whispers and legion if I DONT chase you at LEAST once off a genny you're prolly a dwight.
---
Just cause they release a standalone DLC doesn't mean we get less killers. When Leatherface came out he came out of the blue, yes he is a killer, but still a surprise. We cans till get 4 fill chapters this year as well as a stand alone survivor.
---
Also keep in mind that latency matters alot.
---
I mean if you’re planning on getting all the dlc eventually now is the time
---
No. But if the next 4 chapters are all licensed, a Hellraiser chapter seems likely. The devs have talked about their interest in having Pinhead show up.

---
SPEAK YOUR TRUTH PAVIGNA! &lt;3
---
Yea would the killer be just a spirit or a ghoul/possessed.
---
Got into a 900 ping game a few days ago!! Fuck
---
Ok thank you for the positive feedback 
---
To clarify please, I never said I have never used DS, just that I don't run it normally when I play survivor. And BBQ is absolutely not only used for the BP bonus.
---
The thing is I don't like Freddy neither Quentin and the other dlcs I can use shards so I think Myers/pig is good for me
---
Which was Nurse's, then when they released Clown back in June, he got a different variation. That's where I see the "dip" in creativity. Also, all the different MacMillan (Trapper), Autohaven (Wraith) and Coldwind (Billy) maps are completely different layouts. These "new" maps have different tiles sure, but the same layout.
---
Id love to see some play with it combined with Dance with Me amd maybe quick and quiet
---
I just saw it used in a game I just played, calm down.
---
I barely safety pipped with everyone being 2 hooked at least, sac 2 and having decent chases. No I didnt camp I dont see this new system being anything other than promoting farming 
---
Dude, no. They were being sweaty and farming the hook. In this case, camping was completely valid. 
---
The license holder could go after BHVR or smack us with a DMCA claim. Neither has happened with A Nightmare on Elm Street, SAW or Halloween.
---
Also I don't rlly care for having everything
---
Paying for free content. Lol
---
😡
---
Ok, I was just asking and trying to help, but clearly that causes for downvotes and you being a dick
---
Now as a killer I can confidently pick up my obsession without wondering if they’ll DS me. 
---
I slug anyone who’s just been unhooked if I’m nearby. 
---
It’s effectively been taken out of the meta. If a killer wants to tunnel, they still can.. you’ll just be bleeding out. 
---
As a survivor it was so godly for me. Looping the killer for gens, getting downed, DS, and looping again was just standard for me. It was too toxic, but it was only toxic if you were the obsession... there’s pretty much hooks everywhere. SWF could block for them and help them DS.
---
As opposed to Billy, CamperFace, Tier 3 Myers, Etc?
---
Just think this is after they "buffed" her deviousness gains
---
Yes, a system that can cause almost everyone to depip in one match depending on the game, exactly what this game needs.
---
Out of my 3 games as killer, I’ve had dc’s in every match. One I even brought to my ruin cuz I felt bad.. dc’d anyways.
---
ecks dee
---
Yes. At least they have to hit me when they down me. They can't just spray and get lucky when I'm 10 foot away 
---
14 im a noobie
---
I feel like they need to just completely overhaul rank like instead of 1 to 20 make it 1 to 1000 and you gain or lose a number of ranks based on your performance each match 
---
I didn't want another license character, in my opinion original characters are by far better, and they have cosmetics.
---
But it is now an anti-tunnel perk as it activates after the unhook.
---
RAWR XD
---
Yup, safety pipping with a 2k no camping 
---
Or even better. This could be how they implement the multiple killer game mode. Use multiple monsters from the movie that a couple of killers control.
---
VwV what's this
---
SAW was twofold - first it was content leaks, and then the DLC was accidentally released a day early in New Zealand due to timezone mishaps. The F13 fiasco is due to the ongoing copyright legal fight, but a tangled issue like that isn't currently going on with any of the licenses in DBD.
---
So the update is here and Plague and Jane are both listed in the menus and are available for purchase through AC or IS. They are not yet in the PS store though. 
---
(Notices my Feral Frenzy)
---
She didn’t bait anything dude. Huntress went afk do she could escape but Meg fell and didn’t realize there wasn’t a way out. Look through my post history. I’m a Trapper main and I roughly play killer 80%. Maining survivor or not doesn’t contribute to this opinion. You are literally insulting someone is being griefed.
---
That's quite Adiri-ng
---
I’m playing killer tonight but feel free to add me for the future : NizeDine 
---
Well profile is solid for strutting around I guess.. music is shit
---
nani the fuck
---
I did misunderstand, I thought it only happens 1 per match. If it was that way I would definitely never run that perk. Also, the other two aren't bad at all. 
---
thank you so much!
---
Yeah lets just not get a survivor/character that is loved by millions. Great idea just deny that bhvr lol
---
Okie I will do :) 
---
How do you know?
---
Buddy I wish. That or region controls or something. Seems since the new matchmaking I've gotten consistently more lobbies I've had to dodge as Survivor because of 260+ ping, while also seemingly getting a higher frequency of teammates from other countries as well, which can't be helping the lag situation. 
---
Well you can't expect people to play with you when you have an absolute abomination of an internet connection. Killer just ain't for you then. 
---
Now where have I heard this before .. “New killer is not fun to play against..” I wonder 
---
Clown and Huntress can already do that with addons for their bottles and hatchets though.
---
And Billy can zoom to you faster than that Vomit can.
---
Just sayin', it's not exactly something new that we haven't dealt with before.
---
ha gat em
---
Have any of the others been able to insta down you from 10 ft away?
---
Thanks for your input. Wish me luck.
---
What’s going down clown?
---
Hang on, probably a noob question.. but you can get legacy skins by doing character achievements?
---
Someone above said:
---
&gt; Previously it was 6/9/12/15 at rank 3, now it's 4/8/12/16.
---
If it's lower at 1 and 2 injured than before, and only 1% higher at 4, it seems like a nerf
---
*Pebble Gang would like to know your location*
---
A disguise would be a hella weak power.
---
Evil Ash from Army Of Darkness maybe?
---
You forgot the most important part! Where after waiting and getting a lobby, that everyone has a red ping!  
---
yeah i didn't get temple gen :/
---
Meg Kate Claudette and nea are most used, but yeah I’m sure yet ANOTHER male survivor is necessary.
---
What is it? 
---
But you have to aim huntress' you can't just spray and to be honest I don't think I've played against clown 
---
Outstanding.
---
This is real. 100%. It’s on the console versions right now in KYF. Behaviour are in for a field day trying to contain this.
---
Why did you do it? You fucked up didn’t you?
---
But then you also get tunneled because the killer can see you permanently. It's pretty bad, man
---
Yup but the killer can camp your ass when he downs you
---
This and the Evil Dead stuff. At least 2 people are getting fired.
---
Ash Williams in DBD.  You commented on the post I made 8 months ago saying how you'd love it.  Wanted to make sure you saw IT'S HAPPENING
---
It could be Cheryl (Ash’s sister) which I personally would love the most. It could also be either Henrietta from the second movie or evil ash from the third movie. It all depends on which movie they chose to do. I feel like the first movie would make the most sense since that’s before Ash got a chainsaw for a hand and it’s the one which has the most emphasis on horror. 
---
Thanos gauntlet
---
No
---
Ivan releases evil dead perks on console as he silently wonders why they asked him to do that
---
WTF!
---
If you have a spoiler tag but the spoiler in the title what’s the point?
---
I know like wtf
---
Sadly, I do not. Sorry about that. 
---
Amanda better
---
That would be interesting to see. Imagine being confused if the Ash coming towards you is Good Ash or Evil Ash.
---
Well, Freddy was reduced to being a mute (I mean, even remake Freddy was talkative), and I suppose the entity wouldn’t let Ash in with his Boomstick and his chainsaw, being unfair to some of the killers and the rest of the survivors.

Also Mettle of Man shows the robot hand that he gets in the show
---
I NEED TO SEE
---
Cosmetics usually come out little by little.
---
Patch hits all platforms first. The actual killer and survivor DLC's hit shortly after. And a few cosmetics hit around then or shortly after as well.
---
Then over the next few weeks, we get some more cosmetics trickled here and there to spread out their release.
---
So if 20 cosmetics got leaked as an example, you might only see 7 on patch day then see 3 more a week or two later, then another 2 a week or two after that, then maybe another 3 etc etc etc.
---
That's how it's always worked since the shop launched.
---
I find that playing as the new killer is not so much at red ranks lol.
---
Using only brown add ons... it takes a good amount of chasing and vomiting until the survivor gets the broken status affect.
---
Not only that, but they slowed her movement speed while vomit charging so any survivor can just crouch around a small obstacle and avoid it completely (you’re better off just hitting them). 
---
In the PTB she was fun. Now she’s kinda meh. The only benefit is that some people don’t know how to play against her, but they’ll learn soon so...
---
Honestly they shouldn't. It's such a minor mistake, and I don't think anybody should be fired for something like that. We know the survivor and their perks, but have no information on the killer, the map, or any of that stuff
---
spray n pray has finally came to BDB!  YAY!  
---
Fast vaulting out of a locker is pretty broken right now. Most of the time it doesnt work for me.
---
i would like to play as the plague but i spend all my points over the weekend, so now i have to grind as the doctor @\_@ 
---
lol, would be fun but it'll probably never happen
---
Like Myers, billy or Leatherface. Huntress or clown with add ons. Any killer using make your choice, NOED or devour hope. It's not like she can always instantly down you. She has to either infect you until you break or get corrupt purge. She's strong but that's not bad. She's not nurse.
---
it has less to do with the individual connections(tho it can be an issue if on wifi) and more to do with where you are adjacent to the killer and vice versa.
---
no matter how good your net is it won't change the fact that the game matches you with someone half way across the globe.
---
This may be the funniest trolling I’ve read all day
---
I have almost 1000 hours in this game and have NEVER used decisive as a survivor. I consistently hit Rank 1 every season and will probably continue to do so with these emblem changes. If you need a "free escape" once per match, the problem may be in your playstyle.
---
Insta down from 10 foot away?
---
Why does this bother you so much? It's fucking Ash Williams. Get over it. 
---
Also any SWF group would figure it out insantantly. 
---
yeah, but Freddy ~~sucks~~ still has his evil laugh.
---
Why’d you run to a corner?
---
Yeah it's smoother on most maps, but then absolutely tanks on the new map.
---
And to reach that they lowered the resolution to way under 1080p and the whole game looks like a blurry mess now.
---
woops, thought it was the shitpost tag
---
He looked pretty good in **Poker Night at the Inventory 2**.  Not a dead ringer, but most of the differences seemed to be a result of stylization.  He looked like a caricature of Bruce Campbell, which is what they were going for.
---
Could still swotch things up
---
Screw that, give us projectile eyeball basement granny demon.
---
they’re just toxic surv mains. i agree with you. 
---
Maybe they’ll make it so instead of grunting when he gets hit, he just says ‘groovy’. 
---
hmm me and my friends call it your "dead hook." Did we make this up? Is there an official term? It's been so long that I don't even remember where it started.
---
I had been considering joining the discord but if that's how they're going to act then yikes, pass.
---
I'd you're out of position yes. It's possible to loop her to prevent being hit by the purge. Also there are insta heals all over the map.
---
Then why would they leave me down instead of hooking me 
---
100% fuckin' hype!
---
You're trying to appeal Survivor rules. Don't follow them and just play how'd you like. It sounds like you're stopping yourself from winning sometimes because of it.
---
I think that’s just the Doctor’s new weapon. 
---
use distressing perk
---
who gives fuck about if they have a dick or not is that really going to affect you at all?
---
Granted there are like 2 more male than female killers (because of Legion) and 4 more male than female survivors, I, as a woman, am still pretty happy with the characters we got, and I'm sure we'll get more in the future. Representation in this game is really the least of the issues we have, I think Bhvr is doing a pretty good job in that area. If you're bored with the characters, it's your problem. 
---
They don't heal you to full. I've been playing all day and never once did i get full from a pool
---
There are many reasons for her to let you die:
---
1)You were last 2 Survivors and she wanted Hatch
---
2)She thought Killer might have NOED
---
3)She was Obsession and Killer had Rancor
---
4)She is bad at looping and thought she might die herself
---
5)She wanted you to die/Maybe she was mad you beat her to an Unhook or a Chest she wanted during the game
---
“Don’t weep for the stupid, you’ll be crying all day.”- Alexander Anderson, Hellsing Abridged
---
lol this is sarcastic
---
The killer can only see you if you're fully healed.
---
I'm not the one that took it down, &amp; miscommunication between moderators.
---
There's a chance they might have negotiated a bunch of cosmetics right away for Ash, considering how much the community wants them.
---
Of course it was a Dwight. It's always Dwight. 
---
Please be Cote.   Arrogant prick needs to be gone for the good of the game.
---
They’re bigger, easier to see, less interesting and FAR less used. David is the only one used a decent amount.  When you ever see ace or tapp lullll
---
OwO
---
SWF just got that much easier
---
I just saw. Hope it’s true.
---
 [**u/Redmanstalon**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Redmanstalon) I'm mad now
---
I have a feeling that the intention isn't rewarding players for playing badly, but in combination with the other perks we can see, it's more rewarding players for playing heroically/altruistically. 
---
Right, because randoms won't be following you around wasting their time trying to heal you, AND staying in injured is a good idea
---
honestly Ash should’ve been the killer tbh
---
We better get to play as the evil presence and be able to possess players turning them into deadites temporarily. Maybe we could make them injure themselves, sabotage generators, rebuild totems, etc. 
---
I just want more maps released for old realms. At this rate I doubt we'll see more maps for Yamaoka Estate or Ormond. 
---
It's not just games though... I don't understand why you're bringing this up in a dbd subreddit. It's a real issue but I don't think this is the best place to bring it up. Dbd is really not the worst in that department.
---
The Necronomicon. A book that just floats around! /s
---
Idk, reading other comments it might just be a survivor DLC. But other candidates for a killer (if there even is a killer that pairs with him) in his universe could be some deadite manifastions or Ruby. 
---
Even so, I still pity the guy whose fault this was. He’s about to get the full power of Mathieu blasted in his face.
---
For real though, they’d better address this in a dev live stream, it’s such a big thing that I’m not sure they can sweep under the rug and pretend never happened.
---
REDDIT_desktop_comment_BODY
---
Thanks
---
lol im just glad they give us new content at all, and its every 3 months, on top of events. i think they're doing a pretty great job so far
---
I’m only happy because it’s more easy to get shit killers again lol
---
Jeez the devs try so hard to make new perks that can shake up the meta only to painfully fail.
---
* mettle of man is the obviously the best and only viable choice, a solid perk that is powerful all through the game.
---
* buckle up is already over shadowed by empathy and bond, or just regular SWF.
---
* flip-flop is a perk that should have been a baseline ability for survivors, as i think in some notes from the devs they were talking about including a mechanic like this a while back.
---
Kinda disappointing if you want my opinion.
---
But on a side note EVIL DEAD!? I'M READY! Hope we get another female killer! ;)
---
Quite interesting my doot 
---
Is it me, or its hard to hear survivor footsteps after legion update?
---
Like a more dragged out less skilled dead hard?
---
Then make it reward players that actually play like that, like proc the perk if you're bodyblocking. I'm fine with that, but in it's current state it's just a free healthstate
---
It even has the opposite effect, now people bleed for the next chapter ! Like a Drug dealer just giving you some meth for free to try ! It was a Mastermind who leaked this ! 
---
Marketing Genius ! 
---
BBQ, Ruin, Make Your Choice, Spies.  
---
My flair is just enough. Myers is overrated.
---
I personally use ruin, discordance, monitor, nurses :)
---
Ah ok I see where you're coming from. But even then, if more and more killers started doing this, I am 100% sure it would bring unbreakable to a top tier spot. And yeah, I hated running DS as well. There's some things that I've sworn myself to never touch, starting with DS for survivors and Noed for killers
---
Imagine being this ungrateful.
---
Yeah, I had to jump on to see it for myself and it's in the game.  Since it is licensed we know it's coming.
---
Is that a shotgun in your pocket, your you just happy to see me ? :D
---
BBQ, ruin, nurses calling, and Monitor and Abuse is a fantastic combo for a spirit on the go. This is what I use at red ranks along with addons that reduce your powers cool down/charge time.
---
People like Clown. People like the macabre I guess?
---
A mistake, itll obviously be on console,  I was just making a joke about them not caring about us because bill isnt.
---
Yeah the killer twice in one match **GRABBED ME** out of the locker as I was jumping out, after I met all the conditions of the perk. wtf?
---
buckle up: you can see auras showing how much recovery progress someone has, when you heal them you both see killer aura for 6 seconds
---
Holy shit. Take my money!
---
You dont, at least I have never lost items because of that
---
Totally messing with my eyes. It’s giving me a slight headache.
---
I'm from Chile, the game loves to pair me up with Brazilians. Their ping is from around 300 up to 700-800.
---
Killers always had the advantage? You mean when infinite's, double pallets, no Bloodlust, Insta flashlights etc. Were a thing?
---
Strong killers with good perks and add-ons probably do have the advantage against non-coordinated / non-SWF players but comparing the game's state right now to how it was a year ago I dare to stay it's the most balanced it's ever been. 
---
Scroll over your perks and addons quickly to make it dance.
---
I just dont see this system as a good idea and the community was quite outspoken on it being a bad idea
---
Man, I feel bad this leaked for them. This is fucking awesome.
---
It happens all the time to me. sometimes you lose them, sometimes you don’t. Just had a game with a freddy that quit and i lost my purple flashlight add ons and I’m pretty sure my flashlight too 
---
Has anyone played using the 3 perks?
---
First Match: Tried the Plague, I wasn't really too interested in downing anyone, I just wanted to try her vomit power and see how to aim it and explore the new map.
---
Got teabagged &amp; flashlight clicked at by a Claudette. I thought maybe she wanted to see the new killer, so I went to go try to vom on her, but it turned out that she just REALLY needed me to see her go through hatch. K.
---
Second Match: Played Jane, ran into a Plague. Not once during the ENTIRE match did they use their vomit power, just walked around and M1 attacked instead. When she downed me she stood behind my hook and then immediately hit me back down when I got off. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.
---
Toxicity is out in full force today.
---
Ash Williams from the evil dead
---
SWALLOW YOUR SOUL! SWALLOW YOUR SOUL!
---
i hope they don't, it could be an easy mistake but seeing how mathieu wasn't too happy with the "plague is the oldest killer" spoiler and all, i imagine he's definitely not that happy about this leak
---
My theory for the killer is that he will be called something along the lines of
---
The Demon
---
Power "Cursed Soul" : Each time you hit a survivor the evil shines within your soul (Survivors perks are about hits and dying state) You will be able to control pallets , dying survivors, generators , chests and rather small misc. things. Such as possessing a dying survivor , smashing survivors with pallets and sabotaging a gen. Totems are also part of your smashing ability. Using "Cursed Soul" will deplete a part of your evil but it can be obtained by hitting a survivor (not with your ability) 
---
*Dying survivors which you have possessed will be put back into injured state and will be broken for 10 seconds.
---
*Cursed Soul can be used for 15 seconds until you forcefully unleash your hate and smash a prop. Dying urvivors can be possessed for 30 seconds if they resist your possession.
---
*Dead survivors can always be possessed , sacrificed souls make your power stronger
---
1 Survivor sacrificed +10 Seconds for your ability.
---
Sorry for my bad english, im german.
---
I may be wrong on some things by the way, i havent watched these movies. I did only do some research on google.
---
Killer too? Or not confirmed yet 
---
That shows it's fairly balanced right now, not that anyone needs buffed or nerfed
---
Aw, it's an unfortunate side effect of where I live. I don't play killer cause those poor survivors would be lagging everywhere. So for any online games I play it's a matter of being on hardmode and learning how to play with it.
---
Ace has the quietest and most subtle injured noises. A lot of people use him so they don't have to run Iron Will.
---
Well...I personally think it was about time the devs gave survivors some strong perks. Killers have some amazing perk every DLC and we had nothing meta changing for a looooong time. So stop ranting and try to adapt. But that is just my opinion. I might be wrong. I would rather to see how it plays and in the game and then complain.
---
I mean the general consensus seems to be that design, lore, and theme is on point or at least on par with other chapters.
---
The main complaints are entirely around the gameplay aspect of how Legion functions. Only amplified with Frank's mixtape and moonwalking cheese.
---
Kms
---
I don't play killer to earn pips.  The 4k is where love is.
---
Make Your Choice, Pop Goes The Weasel, BBQ &amp; Chili, and one flex perk has never steered me wrong. 
---
He is almost never used, same with Adam Jeff and tapp. Women in the game are just superior. 
---
Using lull in a sentence... I can see why no one is taking you seriously 
---
I know on console there’s a glitch where you can lose items you didn’t bring, could this be related? Also yea you only lose offerings if the killer dcs.  Did the Freddy have Franklins? 
---
What the hell are you talking about? As an Evil Dead fan it’ll still be great to run around as Ash. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/52296/patch-notes-2-6-0-demise-of-the-faithful#latest
---
This is also what I run, sometimes swap sloppy for monitor
---
Yea the nurse does just wait a few seconds as well, but the legion can hit a survivor and regain all his power, where a nurse still gets stunned regardless. I’m not going to mention any add ons, I’m only talking about their base power. Legion has built in tracking once he hits someone, which he will do. Once nurse downs someone, there is 0 that another survivor that happened to be nearby can do to hide. I understand the points you are making though, I personally just find no fun going against a legion (and I will admit to never have gone against a good nurse because I play on PS4, so my points are probably a little bias)
---
This was my boyfriend's suggestion (although I like the actual perks):
---
"Goody Two Shoes" If you're made sick or driven mad, you have to fist fight a doppleganger of yourself. Lose and the dopple becomes an AI assistant to the killer.
---
Imagine that being your response lulllll 
---
For real, I better fucking hear “groovy” at some point.
---
Woah slow down, extinguish the torches and put the pitchforks down. While I agree with most of what your saying, there's still several months of internal testing before these perks come to light(play with them in kyf while you can I imagine they'll get this patched out) and there's still the PTB testing, it could very well change for the better instead of making the M1 killers hate their life and turn back to hillbilly hell of red ranks.
---
The 2.4.0 patch really screwed up sounds. It has gotten a little better, but not by much. A decent set of headphones and installing a volume equalizer helped a bit. 
---
Bloodhound might not be the most meta perk, but I find it super helpful to catching up to a survivor if you lose them during phasing. Scratch marks are pretty inconsistent, but the blood is reliable. 
---
Again, the perk is not propably powerful, but it is bad design. Those are two different things. Billy is strong, legion is bad design but not very powerful. You can make a strong perk that doesn't reward bad plays.
---
I wonder if spies will still be worth running after the 2.6.0 nerf :(
---
Dbd used to be quite survivor sided but for a while now it has been really balanced. Anyone claiming it favours killers or survivors right
---
Yes I’m quite aware, what I mean to imply is that any pro-Legion comments made in this subreddit is met with mass dislikes, regardless of the context. I apologize if it was not easily implied in my original comment, I am incapable of simplifying it further. 
---
I don't think it would be too confusing. He has a very different outfit, a fucked up face and a skull hat. That with the red stain wouldn't be all that confusing
---
Imagine instead of wanting a balanced game, you just want it to be unbalanced in the opposite direction.
---
They do actually work
---
Anyone can on kyf until they inevitably remove them 
---
1. There were 3 survivors alive (including myself)
---
2. Killer had no NOED and she knew it herself (no one is that stupid to not know when a killer doesnt have NOED.
---
3. She wasnt obsession.
---
4. All she had to do was a body block just a little bit, exit gate was super close.
---
5. No such thing happened, it was all an friendly match.
---
A  Kandarian demon obviously. 
---
Am I the only one who’s seen the movie? 
---
That is part of the reason i'm making this post: to tell them this is not what we want.
---
It was almost *too* much info before.  We'll see though.  
---
wait. why would Americans hate that site? lol
---
I could see the Necrinomicon being the power of the killer.
---
You know they made her slower while she is using her power right? She cant run around at full speed and i think it slows her a bit after she uses it. 
---
I mix it up with my Spirit but Whispers is nice on her. Zooming around checking gens is nice when you know when to stop because someone’s near, but it only really worth it at Tier 3.
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury can be fun if you’re struggling with loops.
---
I feel like Devour Hope is really fun on her because of her mobility but you may want to run Haunted Ground or Thrill with it, or just defend it heavily. 
---
Do you think this means the Plague will be played more? I have severe Emetophobia and I don’t know how I’ll be able to play against her without being constantly sick  :(
---
Gotta get on there before the hot fix.
---
Did anyone check killer side yet?
---
Why did I expect this before seeing the responses
---
Hello everyone, I played a game as Doc today and went against some food survivors on the Father Campbell's Chapel map.
---
I got pretty much destroyed and looped around the chapel for most of the game lmao
---
What is the best way to loop that building as a killer? Are there any things I need to look out for or something?
---
I’m more so interested in what the advantage of that perk is? Like there’s no upside for the survivor. You’re automatically exposed.
---
Just tell them to play better. You used your skills to make a decision. You didn't camp to be an asshole.
---
And the evil dead 2. 
---
&gt;I will admit to never have gone against a good nurse because I play on PS4, so my points are probably a little bias
---
I guess that explains a lot, on PC, if I see a nurse, I know I will not be standing 30 seconds later, the only time I do is when they are new to nurse.
---
&gt;Legion has built in tracking once he hits someone
---
This is obviously true, but most legions don't even utilise this, they will often just tunnel 1 survivor, the legions that do switch targets are usually the easier ones to beat
---
Lol just don’t m1
---
Yeah I've been called sweaty for it but I feel like it's the best build. 
---
Opening doors, cool looking golden things. But sure
---
Maybe ill try that. As of late the hole game has been a negative experience for me. Ive been thinking about hanging up my hat on it. 
---
Yeah, it'd be cool if it involved protection or similar conditions to WGLF.
---
i just played, got 4 out of 5 gens going, healed 2 survivors, took out 3 totems, lost a pip at the end after dying...so i guess you only can gain pips if you escape? fuck this
---
SERECT YUR CAEER
---
Feature - Changed the Character Swap controls from LT/RT to LS/RS
---
Feature - Disabled changing the active characters with the Character Swap controls while the player is Ready in a lobby. This was done as an extra check to ensure there are no more accidental character swaps.
---
THANK GOD
---
Yeah, and I've gotten a pip for both 4ks I've gotten. 4 kills + 9 hooks isn't unreasonable for the best score. I think a way to improve it a little would be 3 kills and 9 hooks is also gold, though. 
---
 If you don't play to earn pips, then you shouldn't care one bit what they do to the emblem system. This will keep campers and tunnelers out of red ranks(most likely relegating them to purple or green), so red is more competitive. People who want the challenge will now get what they want. If you are a good killer, it seems that you'll have no problem ranking up in the new system, it'll just be slower, which is good, because it'll give you less imbalanced matches right after rank reset. 
---
Bruce Campbell has voiced Ash Williams in previous Evil Dead games. I imagine they'll get his likeness no problem, and wouldn't be surprised if he even voices himself.
---
Granted, I'm not too sure *how* they'd translate Deadites into gameplay but that's why I'm not a gameplay designer at BHVR and survivor-only DLCs aren't unheard of, see the Left Behind DLC.      
---
I gotta say, as a massive Evil Dead fan, this is just strange. I’d love to see Ash Williams in some video games, but I don’t see the point of putting him in DBD where everyone is silent &amp; helpless...
---
Ok. I see your point now. But i would rather see it tested in PTB and then decide. 
---
All the susie cosplay and fanart of Legion got lots of support.
---
People also appreciate the fact that this is one of the few killer/survivor duo (quintet?) that are heavily connected with each other.
---
3 new survivor perks got leaked from Evil Dead (bear in mind the names might change and these effects were listed from KYF so they are the Level 3 versions
---
# Mettle Of Man:
---
Evil has a way of always finding you.
---
After getting hit **3 times** by a Killer's basic attack, the perk activates.
---
Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the dying state from the injured state is ignored.
---
The next time you heal back to full health, your aura will be revealed to the killer when you are further than **16 meters** from the killer.
---
The perk will deactivate the next time you are put into the dying state.
---
* *Increases your chances to become the obsession*
---
* *The Killer can only be obsessed with one survivor at a time*
---
*"Evil has a bullseye on my back the size of Tiger Stadium." - Ash Williams*
---
# Flip-Flop:
---
You have an uncanny ability to escape the inevitable.
---
While in dying state, 50% of your recovery progression is converted into wiggle progression when you are picked up by The Killer, up to a maximum of 50% total wiggle progression.
---
*"Catch ya on the flip-flop." - Ash Williams*
---
# Buckle Up:
---
Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability.  The recovery progress of dying Survivors can be determined by the intensity of their auras at a distance of up to **48 meters**.
---
When you heal a Survivor from the dying state to injured, both the healed Survivor and yourself see The Killer's aura for a duration of **6 seconds**.
---
Should be illegal imo. Super anti consumer
---
Clowns belly physics got loose and it’s infecting other items.
---
Not confirmed yet unfortunately 
---
Boi it's probably not for the reason you think.
---
Nurse's weakness is line of sight. That forces her to play a guessing game with her blinks as she doesn't have any vision on the survivor. You force her to guess 1 of 3 general choices:
---
* You continued running around said object like a normal survivor loops
---
* You went around the corner and ran in a straight line gaining the most distance
---
* You attempted to double back on the corner you went around (this is the most common)
---
Nurse is undoubtedly strong in the hands of a skilled player. However saying she has no weaknesses just shows that you don't play nurse and pushes the narrative that "a good nurse can't be beaten" which is categorically false. EVEN A GOOD nurse can have an even match with a survivor crew who splits up and is working gens efficiently.
---
A bouquet of oopsie daisies
---
Plague can put people into injured state without the fountain, it just takes longer/you need to hit the whole vomit stream or at least most parts of it.
---
This is maddening and I love it.
---
Meg might not be thicc but she definitely has a nice ass. 
---
Update: Nothing is working, neither survivor nor killer. I can even get into games sometimes but then this pops up
---
Always liked Halo 2's ranking system...
---
Is this a real leak? If so, that perk suuuuuuucks.
---
It’s not fun for survivors, but a slug build works very well on her. Combining distressing and coulrophobia not only slows healing, but let’s you phase walk more freely.
---
Meme totem defender is always my favorite with her but like you said, it depends on add ons.
---
Oh man that’s spicy but the first one looks pretty annoying 
---
Obviously fake these are Survivor perks that actually sound half decent /s
---
I feel the same way about my boy Bill. Just a straight badass. (insert look how they massacred my boy meme)
---
Pretty sure all or just new achievements progress is not counting atm 
---
PTB PATCH NOTES: Thanatophobia: Tier values are incremented at a rate of 4/5/6% up to a maximum of 16/20/24%.  
---
"Thanatophobia is finally getting the Buff its needed, we'll Just invest this in a short term PTB..."
---
LIVE PATCH NOTES: Thanatophobia had it's values decreased after testing in the PTB. Values decreased from 4/5/6% down to 3/3.5/4% for a new maximum of 12/14/16%.
---
"...aaaand it's gone!"
---
Wonder what they changed in this patch that made EAC uninstantiate itself in protest. lol Maybe EAC liked the old DS, or maybe it just didn't wanna be puked on all day. We'll never know since I forced it to instantiate itself right back in there and get to work. :D
---
That's why I got it before last rank reset I knew this shit was coming going to be impossible to get after.
---
I’m not sure if he had franklins, as he never even put me in the dream world and I didn’t look at the scoreboard when he quit. All I know is that I am 98% sure I had two flashlights and now I only have one. I know I lost my add ons but wasn’t completely sure about the flashlight 
---
Adding to this can someone check if healing someone while in broken status makes progress towards wounded survivor?
---
Like, why scale based on rank if it’s the same objectives. Now I don’t care about my rank 1 bc I have to be a try hard. Stuck on four 🙃
---
Maybe the witch? 
---
Isn't that what half this sub is anymore?
---
is this real? because holy shit an Evil dead chapter would be...
---
...groovy
---
No it doesn't. Once you are downed after using the perkit deactivates. This means you would need to get hit the third time (perk works), then escape, then heal, then get hit, then escape, then heal, then get hit, then escape, then heal, then get hit(perk will now work again if you get hit another time).
---
If, at any point, you go into the dying state once the perk activates you will lose the perk for the rest of the game.
---
As a side note, keep in mind you get revealed once you get to full health after the perk activates. *But,* if the perk deactivates you won't be revealed anymore. Also, Billy (and other Killers with non-basic attacks) will *never* let you used this perk more than once.
---
Yay it’s finally here!
---
Yup and it just dropped in the store. Woohoo! 
---
It might be... but i have a strong feeling this perk will break a few controllers if it gets released
---
could just be a survivor dlc, kinda like how bubba and bill are
---
Finally someone not circle jerking to Legion hate
---
Give us possessed ashy slashy as killer, less' go. Lol
---
Ok good luck on your quest to make people play video games the way you want them to play.
---
*Insert joke about Dwight*
---
Bloodhound, distressing, stridor, and save the best for last
---
BBQ, Pop Goes The Weasel, Ruin, Stridor.
---
Except this perk doesn't reward you for altruism, it rewards you for getting hit.
---
Yeah I’m disappointed as fuck.
---
With SWF in the game, [it'd be a similar case to how you rarely if ever see a Spy-pick during a Sixes matches of Compettive Team Fortress 2:](https://youtu.be/9UiVtTR4aMY?t=343) on paper, an impressionist is a cool concept but rarely do they ever work outside of the bedlam &amp; disorganization of public matches.    
---
That said; The Deadities in the films and TV show are notoriously aggressive &amp; mobile, though.       So if they are on the table for this DLC they could take an angle more like a Mobility killer like Nurse or Hillbilly.
---
Did she get nerfed?
---
Survivors don't need buffs. They need to balance around swf. Even the best players like true talent get wrecked by even semi competent swf. And now it is damn hard to pip as killer. I just got a 3k with plague and only safety pipped. 
---
What's the nerf?
---
i didnt know there was a second one!!! i love it so much. the cuts make it so much better 
---
Yeah, pretty sure its your joystick, happened to me, switched controller and it didnt happen anymore
---
I don’t see how, in any way, you got a Billy comparison. 
---
i like that one way better for jeff tbh
---
Stupid T H I C C
---
Damn, surprised I got tagged. But my God this would be awesome!!!
---
Yeah, I actually D/Ced from the Plague that stood in front of my hook when she downed me the second time, because I was like... This is fucking ridiculous. I don't usually d/c, but I had a couple of hours between work meetings and wanted to check out the updates, not sit on a hook being babysat by someone who isn't even using their new killer's power.
---
That's too good looking for DbD
---
I agree that in this case the Huntress is going against the rules by holding the game hostage.
---
What I don't understand is how going AFK (the time doesn't matter) is reportable. I even tried looking for the rules but couldn't find it on the DBD rules post ([link](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system)).
---
If for example I've been looking for the last survivor (with all gens done) for such a long time that I got tired of it, should I really quit instead of going AFK (so I keep my points/pip) so that the survivor finishes whatever he is doing instead of going gates/hatch?
---
Obviously a new location would be better but the devs said that they can't do a new location for every new killer due to time constraints.
---
So I rather get content quicker while not a completely new map with every killer. I quite like the new map in any case though.
---
It’s not you specifically, it’s that killer mains love to excuse bad design when it suits them (like bullshit hit boxes) but when a perk like decisive comes along to discourage tunnelling you lot have a bloody meltdown
---
BBQ &amp; Chili reveals our location when you hook someone and gives you blood points to name one 
---
That nerf to movement speed while holding purge is messing with me. All of my strategy has gone out the window and I have to relearn the new killer at rank 6 lol. She is fun as hell tho, love puking on survivors. 
---
How the fuck did this even happen? Are they actually that bad, or just teasing us?
---
I couldn't tell what that was until you pointed it out.
---
I'm wondering that too
---
It might be the controller. I've experienced the same thing because my sticks are busted from wiggling too much.
---
The only thing I hate is that she grabs you while puking. This patch is making me only want to use try hard perks and items now since it’s so hard to even safety pip without SWF
---
Bunny Feng Min confirmed!
---
Shotgun
---
If you move the character description for The Plague up and down the text, her incense burner will shake with it hahaha
---
You guys think his prestige outfit will be Ash without his right hand? 
---
I have been using Plunderer's+Ace ITH and whenever the killer disconnected, my items plus their add-ons were added to my inventory. Never happened to lose them after the new ranking system patch or even earlier( can't remember correctly)
---
Your only option is to contact BHVR. I heard they're pretty responsive. 
---
Also, PS4 here.
---
Pretty sure that politicians already have workarounds around it...
---
Can’t say it’s surprising lol, certain maps this killer is absolutely no fun to play against with her fire hose vomit. There is absolutely no chance dodging it. At least with huntress it’s fun cause it takes a bit of skill on both sides to dodge or hit a hatchet. This is just brainless point and spray with absolutely no chance of missing.
---
Out of 6 games I’ve had 9 dc’s since launch with Plague, I could care less about ruin. I just wanna puke on people :(
---
And you console players cry that you don't get anything cool.
---
/s of course 😁
---
Mettle of Man looks like it will become the next pre nerf DS. You’d think BHVR would learn not to make second chance perks that reward someone for losing
---
I've been playing all day and only deranked once,but still its just unfun. 
---
IF YOU USE PERKS OTHER THAN ENDURING RUIN BBQ YOU ARE GOING TO DIE IRL
---
-BHVR, probably
---
On PS4 when I play new killer on the new map my frames plummet. I haven't been able to get a different map so I'm not sure if it's a map issue or not.
---
Actually, both instances of the perks effect (the heal and the free hit) only work **once**.
---
They both state on the **next** occasion of each event. So once you are healed your aura is revealed until the perk deactivates (when you get downed).
---
But, this could mean you could go down after getting the free hit and you never have to worry about the aura part.
---
This perk is actually very solid. It's a mini-version of old DS. (This is assuming the Killer goes through the wiping animation and you also get the speed boost). It's DS but you have to activate it first and has downsides if you escape after using it. The Killer also can not juggle you.
---
I think maybe it’s 60 seconds and not 45
---
Holy shit.
---
There was a new perk leaked or are you talking about an announced perk
---
This guy does nothing but spam retarded shit to defend legion
---
Damn that sucks, bbq is going to be a must for the BP, I get the idea behind the new BP/ranking system, but it’s only going to cause even more rage especially now that BP is even more precious, the most optimal I did as survivor I ONLY SAFETY pipped from 2 saves, 1 ones cleanse, 2 dulls, 1 heal, 1 blind, 2 escapes. 
---
The toxicity is going to be out of this world unless they really crack down on the new EULA and ban system 
---
when i heard we get a temple map i thought of another indoor map inside a temple. THAT would have been great. this though. its basicly red forest with a few temple assests. really low effort.
---
That Trapper skin brings a new meaning to Salt mining.
---
Me:well we have gotten Jane,Spirit,Plague,Susi....
---
(Accidentally clicks profile)
---
(sees profile picture)
---
Me:well theres no use arguing with this kind of people 
---
Why downvote when you can dc 
---
Did they already fix it? I see it installed an update and now it’s trying to download and install another update on my ps4
---
Woomy!
---
chileno acá tmb y tengo puros japoneses en vez de los clásicos brasileños, esta injugable desde que agregaron lo del matchmaking 
---
It looks like it's just a survivor character, so it might not be the next actual chapter, just something they release in between them. I don't remember what they did with Leatherface, but it'll probably be the same. 
---
The way to do it is you have deep wounds apply to someone, end frenzy, hit someone else, find the first person and down them that way. Its stupid and takes forever. I got the achievement... I wasnt happy doing it though
---
My problem with this perk is the downside. Aura reveal when fully healed and also have to be 16 meters away from the killer? So like nurse's calling but worse. I as much as I understand this post, the new chapter is so far away that the it will probably get changed.
---
What's 60 not 45?
---
There are some not a lot but plagues all look eh while jane has a couple decent ones
---
Should Note:
---
V is me
---
e is a fellow survivor
---
r is salty killer
---
They're in the store.
---
WGLF isn’t working properly either.
---
Yeah, that’s what it sounded like. Her weapon also jitters around a lot, hopefully they sort it out. 
---
Is anyone on console (I’m on PS4)  getting a wiggle bug? As soon as I load into game it’s prompting me to wiggle and that’s on the LS and how you move is with LS so it’s causing some problems running away lol
---
Not so *Unbreakable* now, huh?
---
If I read it correctly, the time it takes for the timer of the survivors to become that 1-hit state
---
But people get automatically reported for DC'ing 
---
No it doesn't. It still puts them in a 'Deep Wound' state.
---
You are bad and don’t understand how the game works thanks for playing try again next time when you get good. 
---
REAL TALK: If the next update isn't named *"Evil Dead by Daylight"* then the devs fucked up.
---
If you haven't seen the film then the little bite of text the game has provided really doesn't so it justice.
---
Host privilege is my guess
---
This makes me want to theorize on the killer, and seeing as how Ash’s main thing he fights in the movies is deadites, I wonder when you choose them if it will be a zombie version of a survivor or something along those lines. Just imagining Nea living up to her killer potential 
---
AND no mither and sprint burse 
---
Farm.. Dc’d...Autohaven.. Dc’d.. Ormand.. Dc’d.. Temple... All 4 dc’d. I have a hunch it’s just the killer and not the map people don’t like lol. And it’s a lot easier to wif a spray than you’d think.
---
Wow! I'm glad they are making a chapter about Mass effect! 
---
Ashley Williams makes sense as a survivor because everyone kill her on Virmire :D
---
Oh no I’ve seen the movies, in the movies he’s always following his family’s instructions so they’ll accept him and killing people that are hostile towards him
---
Well like i said, they usually come out shortly afterwards. So might be up later tonight or tomorrow.
---
Yes because possibly the sunniest area possible would work fucking great in this game 
---
What's the other two?
---
Trash. Two gens, two saves, never hooked, exit gate opened, survived, safety. 
---
Haha I tagged you because you posted in my suggestion post 8 months ago saying you'd love it too.  Spreading the joy!
---
it's not amazing and i wish it was an indoor map but you're being a bit overdramatic
---
Thanks. Didn't notice.
---
I love when rank 12’s have the audacity to call anyone a noob.  Let alone, a dead rank 12. 
---
I was actually talking about other killers and survivors cosmetic. I've seen the ones for Plague and Jane..
---
Except it didn’t because it’s just a visual bug 
---
Like Bayonetta? Or Tomb Raider? Or Remember Me? Or Skull Girls? Or WET? Or Metroid? Or any of the hundreds of copy paste sandbox games that let you choose your gender? No, you're right. Every single video game has more playable males.
---
You still hear her breathing

Dwight with his bright-ass clothing is the best, and Ace whos so quiet you dont have to run iron-will on him is the worst? Im gonna be real with you chief, your graph is poo poo garbo.
---
&gt; I love the assumptions people here make p: I actually mostly play high rank killer and never use DS as survivor.
---
These were your exact words. Keep your story straight. 
---
Ruin, BBQ, Monitor and Abuse, Rancor. 
---
Played against it as well
---
Looks like you were salty? He didn't say anything until you did.
---
Doesnt mean there isnt a killer though. Its possible that they only fucked up on leaving the survivor perks activated in the live game.
---
What else do you expect the killer to do once the gens are done and they have someone on the hook?

---
What if we got evil dead themed cosmetics for a nonlicensed killer that’s already in the game? Crazy idea I know but it would be better than nothing.
---
You know Ash himself could be a killer. Chainsaw hand and shit. But that's just because I want crazy Ash to say one liners while mowing people down.
---
If they were in the game's code you'd be able to data mine them. This is the console version so they probably added them early to make it easier on the verification process microsoft and sony does.
---
I'm not sure if you're able to datamine console but if you can it's a lot harder than datamining PC.
---
&gt; no other killer have a weakness that consists on relying on mindgames.
---
Spirit is literally this.
---
Haha, I love the cut to being carried into the basement after that disapproving look from Myers.
---
We've just had one on pc, it ended two weeks ago i think. 
---
I'll be honest, I was the same way when I started. I really wanted to play fair and make sure everyone was having a good time. But it didn't matter how nicely I played and how fair I acted, survivors just kept being rude to me. I would run from hooks, avoid slugging, break chases if I kept finding the same person to avoid tunneling. In exchange, survivors would flash me on every pallet, teabag on each vault, and make me waste time coming to them at the exits just to watch them teabag out.
---
I just play as I see fit now. I'm not intentionally toxic, but I've stopped treating survivors with kiddy gloves if they're going to play bad and make mistakes. If they're swarming a hook I just put up? I'm not going anywhere, and I'll keep slugging until I'm sure everyone is gone. If you TB or flash on a pallet or vault, you're going down, you're going on the hook, and I'll make sure you go right back up when you come down.
---
Survivors choose to value their fun over everyone else's. The choice is either to play in a way to offset that, or just stop playing killer. And since the community is already lacking in killers, that's a choice between nobody playing the game, or some survivors having unfun matches.
---
Infinity war dlc look at the perk picture
---
Lol imagine complaining about BBQ, the easiest meta perk to counter
---
Well if it's Evil Dead 1 Ash, he wasn't a hero yet. He was just the final guy and if the sequels hadn't been made, the ending could very well have been him dying to the dark force that was unleashed. Remember Evil Dead 2 was a sequel and remake at the same time. 
---
You guys do realize I put \*Shitpost\* for a reason right?
---
My guy, hes right. Once gens are done and gates are opening/ opened then it's the only smart thing for the killer to do unless they have noed or all the survivors are wounded.
---
2,330 Gb
---
Maybe it's the realism that makes him such a stressful character for me. I mean, his family never forced him to wear the faces of his victims. That was done by choice. 
---
I mean, it still makes missed skillchecks regress more progress, it just doesn't affect skillcheck difficulty. If they changed it to not have any affect until 1 token I could see it not letting survivors know. 
---
Ah...The great deku tree 
---
Hooooly shit, Those Jeff and Billy skins lookin’ dope!
---
Entirely possible.
---
Exactly my point.
---
Something as simple as this made it out of the 2 week PTB.  A simple visual bug.
---
Let the Trapper start with all of his traps in hand at the beginning of the game has to be the dumbest idea of all time. They could just get one basement hook, set three traps around basement, and then win the game from there every single time. He needs buffed, but not that way
---
That... makes sense. Thank you for explaining this to my dumbass.
---
Just don't let the randoms heal you, and if you've got a free hit, you can stay injured, just be aware you're gonna make noise and need to loop. 
---
Aren't you the same person who claimed the DS Nerf was simultaneously not a Nerf at all and also a great and needed nerf?
---
And even then it is dangerous to go too far from the hook. If they get them down and all escape then you got nothing. If you stay close or just outright camp, you at least get the one.
---
Erm, technically both. On the console version of 2.6.0, in KYF, there is a set of three survivor perks for one Ashley J. Williams, which shouldn't be there...but they are. This isn't just a leak, this is a flat-out oil spill.
---
genius, it was even better back when you didnt have to hook people to mori them.
---
Input lag from tv? Are you in game mode?
---
A buckle up.
---
Killer main here. I love the toxic messages. It means im pissing them off 😂
---
Nice!
---
*Cries in lack of cosmetics for them*
---
Only if you fully heal.
---
Slight buff to no mither?
---
*vigo disliked this*
---
It’s not his fault that poor map design exists. A tile where the best option a killer has is to give up the chase is horrible map design, and entity blockers are a poor bandaid fix when tiles like wretched shop, ironworks, god window on torment creek, and god window on rancid abattoir should’ve been done away with in the first place.
---
That being said, the huntress did choose to play his game and make a less optimal play for the sake of catching and tormenting him, which is why I do agree that OP is still an asshole. Still, that does not exempt the survivor from being an asshole. The survivor was toxic on stream and knew that he was running a loop on which the killer was powerless to catch him, and then in turn got angry when the killer tunneled him and rendered him powerless to escape.
---
Hey none of this Ashy Slashy business. Just because a guy goes crazy and cuts off his girlfriend's head in the woods doesn't mean he's a killer.
---
Do you imagine how terrible it would be if they coulnt even get his Likeness? like Laurie,David Tapp and Quentin.
---
No its not lmao? thats unbreakable on console 
---
What if that's blue shirt kid?
---
Well I know what I'm doing when I get home
---
Uninstall the game, delete system 32, and commit sudoku.
---
My dick is hard from this! Better be real!
---
You make fun of a killer than make a post about them being salty.
---
If you’re able to add that in to a normal match then smart yes. If your plan is to sit behind there the whole game on the off chance they go to that one exit.. and haven’t broken all the totems because no killer what else are you gonna do..No.
---
lol me too 
---
Give man back his m16 ffs
---
Why? Survivors don't say shit, so what's the point?
---
They prob don't play on console
---
Wow so toxic /s
---
Idk what that means
---
The thing is... They made it worse than it was before.
---
I literally can't see where the generators are anymore, its insane
---
Aren't we supposed to get one the same day the chapter drops? 
---
Jeff and Ace need to be switched...
---
Good to know.
---
Honestly just stopped trying for rank honestly. legit it punishes you for ranking up with worse teamates and higher Q times, i dont like saying it. but i will stick around 8-11 thank you
---
It's worse at every stack except 4. At 4 stacks, it's better by 1%
---
After this massive fuck up they'll never simultaneously release DLC again lmao
---
Poor Ardetha
---
Honestly, I’ve found that with the new matchmaking, I’m getting paired with the grimiest of players.  It’s a smorgasbord of ranks and all the green/yellows will insta-DC if they’re found first and downed. Sorry Buttercup, this is the reason you’re stuck in the survivor hell ranks. 
---
Just got another safety from a 3k. I can tell you this much. If they don't change this system rank 1 killers will be terrifying. 
---
It is not fixed.. It is not even mentioned in the notes. It is just mindblowing for me they can't fix their bugs but they keep releasing new and new patches. Also WGLF seem to be broken when unhooking infected player...
---
It's a fucking infinite loop. Take 3 to 4 month to patch bugs from the patches before, when new patch comes out new bugs and glitches start happening. It's a shitfest
---
Billy is better in every way. Just try and find someone 5 gen with this killer. You can’t, her effect forces a trickle down effect which makes it so survivors have time to get so many gens done. 
---
Billy = insta down survivor, amazing map control.
---
The Plague = get looped while trying to infect survivors, know the general location of where survivors are when they heal but can’t put map pressure thus it doesn’t matter. Most of the time if she wants to even use the best part of her power (the devotion) she has to go out of her way to find a pool. 
---
You've outdone yourself. I'm always sad when I see a new meme that doesn't use one of your templates! And unfortunately the leaks are gonna drown this fantastic post! 
---
Oh new ones, uh idk I wasnt really looking for them honestly but I figure they will come later this week or next maybe 
---
IF it is a chapter, the quotes being from the show and all, it would really be sweet to see the demon [Eligos](https://evildead.fandom.com/wiki/Eligos) as the killer. He played a small part in the show but he would be a pretty great killer. 
---
Me too fam
---
It’s evil genius!
---
I wish I could give gold
---
Botany and streetwise can help to counter those perks
---
Is this what heaven looks like?
---
True, good for hag that way as well. I hate getting these hate messages while I'm learning a new killer lol, baby killer, ggez, go hang yourself. And if u dare to get a hook almost guarantee a dc. 
---
18 min for 1.7gb? Lul xd
---
well said my man
---
You get a free hit after being hit 3 times.
---
I mean, I have 11 followers according to reddit, and I have no idea who they are or why they follow me.
---
SHOW YOURSELVES DAMMIT
---
I think its broke on plague vomit and hatchets. Hook immunity i frames dont work against them either
---
I would also like to point out that Skemooo [made a render video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX_1PUm0) of how these outfit will look ingame on the characters.  
---
Wondering if he's gonna have a killer with him or just be by his lonesome. 
---
Fantastic use of this meme. 
---
the tree!
---
It feels too forced. Like going through a check list than playing the game naturally. 
---
It could be good, but in reality it’ll probably just prompt people to look for ruin if they can’t do the gens closest to them.
---
It had nothing to do with another game but Jason rights still being tied up in a legal dispute 
---
Corrupt lasts for 60 seconds instead of 45 seconds. the only nerf she received is that I believe she moves at 110% movement speed while holding her vomit in. 
---
They buffed her movement speed while she is charging it though.
---
This is all from the patch notes
---
If the leaks are on PS4 it's most likely going to be on PS4
---
Unless you’re playing someone who can control flow of chase I try to avoid that building or force pallets down and pray they don’t have BL
---
It has harsh downsides tho
---
Are survivor hitboxes the same for each survivor or is it based on the character model? (Asking for Jane lul)
---
underrated comment
---
They do. If you use a fountain while infected and broken, you instantly heal to full and have the broken status effect removed, unless it’s bugged atm
---
Legions feral frenzy, PLagues Vomit (uncorrupted) and Huntress hatchet (without instant down addon) (Healthy State on survivor) 
---
do not instant down when exposed from dev hope or no ed are in play 
---
or else youd see people spreading even more salt on how Legion is Stupid or op blah blah 
---
Ruin is fine
---
Uhhh what do you mean, you don’t lose items or add-ons 
---
If a killer disconnects you get survival points and keep the items and addons you are holding when the killer leaves
---
Read the patch notes or just play the killer to see how she was needed instead of the mass survivor downvote brigade... 
---
and survivor mains wonder why all they ever see at high ranks is billy and nurse. 
---
these perks are just showing how survivor sided this game is. The devs are putting in more ways to counter slugging, which by the way arises from Survivor stupidity. Very few killers slug as a strategy from the start of the game. It happens because survivors are stupid and start clumping up, allowing themselves to get slugged. It is stupid how many second chances survivors are getting. Like do we really need another Dead Hard perk? But this time it is auto activated...Yet the devs still do NOTHING for killers, so for survivors this game just gets even more and more faceroll. Like can we fix hatch please, it's been almost 3 years but survivors can still DC from the game and give the last survivor hatch since it auto opens when the DC(s) occur
---
All, please?
---
Biggest problem then is, if your ruin gets taken out, you have 2 perks left
---
I was thinking that originally, but you need to be hit 3 times before it works
---
same
---
Thanks game but this one time, i do not need to find help
---
is this back?
---
i know it was a thing before but i thought they patched this
---
I did not know I needed Dwight making that face in my life. Thank
---
That picture is really cute
---
A DVD copy of the ED remake on a segway with a hammer taped to the front
---
LMAOOOO THAT'S TOO COINCIDENTAL 
---
She needed that though otherwise you could just walk around holding vomit in your throat ready to puke on everyone. 
---
What is going on?
---
Wait, so this is legit and not some hoax?
---
I don't care, I just want to get a look at that sexy piece of ass.
---
It’s a good dash of “If I can’t bully you I’m just gonna quit” type of players I find also. Today I’ll give the exception because Plague but that doesn’t excuse the others I’ve had this weekend.
---
Yeah balanced landing and lithe seem to be a nightmare on that map for killers lol
---
Thx for the advise, I guess next time I'll just ignore the Gen in there and pray no one runs in there to loop me around 
---
50% is achieved by getting 100% recover. That's a lot of time.
---
And so? You learn to not slug that match after a failure, or at least not slug that guy. 
---
But... why?
---
dew it
---
The Legions problem is his gameplay mechanics. There is no counterplay. Especially if he runs mixtape and decides to just tunnel you. There is literally nothing you can do about it. Even the devs have owned up to him being in need of improvement (gameplay wise). I still think the nurse is stronger 100 fold.
---
A DVD copy of the ED remake sitting on a segway
---
I always try to remember people who farm others off the hook right in front of me. If I have the choice at the end of the match of who gets the hatch, you know the farming guy is getting a fat hook.
---
Pretty cool perks! Saw all 3 and they seem mid-tier
---
Especially since now more and more single player games offer to choose between a female or male character even when it’s FPS!
---
besides Jane and Plagues cosmetics, the rest arent in game for some reason yet
---
I checked the in game store on console btw
---
fair trade we get ptbs you get one survivor leaked
---
Don't forget "Leigon is BAD" and "Fuck the DS nerf"
---
Fix 1 bug and it creates 2 other bugs, its been like that since release. I like to call it "Get BVHR'd" 
---
Alright... another killer that causes constant DCs? Please god I hope not.
---
everybody just imagine how worthless bhvr as a company is
---
do u expect from those guys to fix this game?
---
Shit, I misread it. Rip

I dont see how giving the game to a 3 yo has to do with skill. What 3 yo can play a video game?
---
Why is this cameraman just chasing her lol
---
The the $12.99 question 
---
I tasted that as soon as I finished reading this
---
BHVR did an oopsie.
---
The way you worded the Perk is confusing. From how you wrote it you are saying:
---
\-You get Hit 3x. The 3rd Hit=Heal 1 State
---
\-You get Hit 3x Again.  The 6th Hit= Heal 1 State and then Aura is revealed to Killer
---
Is your aura revealed then the Entire rest of the game?
---
I'm not arguing if it's op or not. The problem is that the entire killer game revolves around one perk that makes a core aspect of the game unfun for the opposite side. This should never be the case for killer or survivor. Game changes needed to be made regardless
---
That's kinda odd. They usually drop when the chapter drops. Correct me if I'm wrong 
---
So the survivor is like some sort of race-car driver? Or something mechanical/?
---
It’s so fucking like BHVR to somehow screw up so bad they put half of the new DLC in the game
---
I have a fear of heartbeats and I find that in game they aren't bad for me because I'm distracted by the game and not that sick sound 
---
Fingers crossed but my own stats aren’t making it look to promising atm :( 
---
Fire time
---
That’s not the Ash anyone wants tho. That’s like making an Iron Man game about Tony Stark before he built any Iron Man suits. That’s a poor comparison but that’s how it feels to me. 
---
I just mean that technically speaking a person shouldn't be chased for 5 gens either (and also a lot of credits for that goes not to the intended design but to the exploit of it). If the killer is THAT bad, there would be a plenty of opportunities to break LOS and escape and that's what survivor is intended to do by the game's rules
---
I can 4k with doc and freddy and I am pretty bad at killer. Only reason I can 4k is because on killer I am very low rank and play the killers that require the least amount of thought to win which is doc and end game build freddy.
---
i'd recommend the Licensed killers, if you dont want freddy Take saw since she got hella buffed recently with shattered bloodlines. 
---
have fun 
---
Here are the notes
---
Corrupt Purge base duration is now 60 seconds instead of 45 seconds.
---
Increased The Plague Brutality and Deviousness scoring.
---
Increased the duration of infection of environmental objects to 35 seconds instead of 20 seconds.
---
Slightly increased The Plague movement speed while charging Vile Purge and Corrupt Purge.
---
Slightly reduced The Plague movement Speed while fully charged and holding Vile Purge and Corrupt Purge. 
---
Survivor infection no longer resets once The Survivor is hooked. 
---
Vile Purge can now correctly infect gate switches.
---
When all Pools of Devotion have been corrupted, all corrupted Pools of Devotion reset and The Killer automatically gains the Corrupt Purge effect. 
---
I fail to see any serious nerfs. The speed she moves while holding the vomit is not great but that's the only serious nerf I have noticed. If anything it seems like more of a quality of life buff with the increased time holding corrupt and having all pools infected giving the plague the corrupt vomit automatically.
---
I'm guessing a lot of people don't know what the "sed" command even is. Hell, I hardly ever use it and have to look it up every time I do.
---
For those that don't know:
---
*sed -i 's/before/after/g' &lt;filename&gt;* will replace ALL instances of 'before' with 'after' in the given file.  Steve, deprived of caffeine, replaced all instances of 2.3 with 25. Hopefully that is the only place where 2.3 appeared in the file too...
---
Yea but you’d be mad if you were on that guys team...
---
how is it unfun? you literally just have to hit skillchecks
---
I guess it’s the constant issue that the survivor is throwing up every millisecond so the visual is bad too. I can’t even play her for that reason too. 
---
Maybe in the long run this might help me with this fear by the exposure. 
---
Hopefully. 
---
I hope not. It's just that dedicated servers have lags too, sometimes really noticeable
---
Yeah both times I tried to use it last night it didn’t work. Made a Bill disconnect because of it :(
---
Kate was leaked like 6 months early lmao 
---
It's, like, 1% mouth. What.
---
This honestly looks really fucking real? The perk icon, the description, everything about it.
---
If it’s fake it’s extremely well done and if it’s real it means we’re getting a Deadite killer, they’re all about possession so I’m super interested in how they’d work as a killer if they’re real.
---
Ain't buying it.
---
Could be a leak of an April Fool's joke. 
---
It happened to me against a face camping doctor i was so pissed
---
It’s not a datamine or anything though.
---
Literally anyone can go look at it, it’s not even a leak, it’s just a release lmao
---
Honestly I try to force them to do that gen early so the entire building becomes a dead zone. If they get that gen done at the start, I know a lot of their escape potential can be pushed in my favor because I won’t ever follow in there. It creates stall. 
---
Demise, Shattered and Saw/Curtain Call
---
Oh yeah I think most of the other QOL changes are good but the nerf on movement speed while holding it full charge was necessary. 
---
Nobody wanted Rorschach Freddy either, but that's who we got. But despite whether or not we want Ash the hero, Ash from the first Evil Dead makes more sense for the theme of Dead by Daylight than the Ash from Evil Dead 2 and forward. 
---
I think this was the same when Shattered bloodlines came out, the Themed cosmetics for survivors/killers came out later, but i could be wrong. 
---
I wouldn’t call them worthless. I don’t see you making a game
---
No shit. But you'd have to be a god to hit 10 hard skill checks in a row. I just played a match where I got 10 skill checks in about 40 seconds. 9 of them were in the first half of the circle. I hit 6, but the regression was strong enough from those three missed checks to only get my gen to 40%. That is the definition of unfun
---
I wonder if evil dead is going to be a whole new chapter or it’s going to just be Ash like how Texas Chainsaw massacre was just Leatherface
---
When I buy I like to buy for teachable perks (although I now own them all.)  
---
Based on that I'd get Saw absolutely and Curtain Call.  You get a lot of great perks for killer and survivor.  Make Your Choice is a personal favorite.  Bamboozle is fantastic.  Pop is really good as well and Surveillance is very fun after the buff.  
---
Dance With Me &amp; Windows are solid but not S tier or anything.  Tapp's perks I'm not a fan of.  The killer perks are def better than the survivor ones.  
---
I'd rate Nightmare as the worst of the group.  Blood Warden and Remember Me can be fun for late game builds but I prefer to focus on ending the game before that point.  The survivor perks are also trash.  
---
Use money for licensed killers and shards for the rest 
---
I doubt Universal or whoever currently holds the rights to Evil Dead gives that much of a shit in all honesty.
---
From their whole hands off approach to the horror movies they make I’m sure they’re pissing their pants in anticipation over just how much money this DLC will end up making them after Halloween.
---
This sounds like a survivor main, when you play killer you’ll realize the game goes too fast nd you need some way of slowing down the gens 
---
Nah it definitely feels slower on PS4. Thought it was my controller but it wasn’t. I thought I was going insane but turns out I’m not the only one
---
I ugly laugh-snorted at this
---
r/unexpectedsplatoon
---
I really hope so I can't wait for them ahah
---
Power has cooldown and isn't instant teleportation like Nurse's. So is not as good as Nurse's power, but yes you do rely a lot on mindgames with/against her.
---
Just wanna say Demise of the Faithful is not on sale since it just dropped two hours ago.
---
My votes would be for Saw, Shattered Bloodlines and Nightmare on Elm Street.
---
Any videos of Killers like Tru getting wrecked by SWF? Even VS SWF I still see him always getting 2, 3, or 4 Kills.  
---
Also, SWF is very rare, especially a 4 person SWF. You don't balance around something that happens maybe 5% of the time
---
yeah, like the killer is getting fucked because hes solo against 4 people, if theyre organized then the killer stands almost no chance if he is not a god either, so both sides can get fucked if they arent good
---
It’s very good now rank one won’t have players who don’t belong 
---
If it’s Sam Raimi’s decision on the chapter I think we’re safe, guys cool as anything and super passionate about Evil Dead and Ash.
---
Seeing all the hype for this chapter is probably super awesome for him.
---
Same with SWF.. you can fight it by doing totems 
---
everybody must fired
---
especially that dwight dev
---
This post is a joke ? She got her power upped from 45 sec to 60.  That\`s the only noticeable change with her, and comparing her with hillbilly is just dumb and ignorant
---
I'm killer main, but I appreciate the identity politics. I'm saying the meta needs to change, not to just need the perk. Go look at my other responses.
---
Complaining about ruin is like complaining about exhaustion perks... Stop, they're both crutches ADAPT.
---
Would that work though, given that ash didn't meet any of his iconic baddies like possessed ash until after he lost his hand and I assume we won't get chainsaw hand ash. Unless the explanation is that the entity made it come back.
---
BRUH I WANT HER BUT I DONT HAVE MONEYYYYYY
---
**Flip flop**Would've never thought on that one
---
You don't need to be a 5 star chef to know your food isn't good. 
---
Swf is not very rare at all on ps4. I can tell you over half the games I get are at least 3 swf. And true has a ton of videos I'll go find a couple for you. 
---
Lol. I was a like level 3 Dwight with one perk (bond), I didn't &amp; still don't have Small Game.
---
Especially with the more they change the point system the harder it gets to get those.
---
Borrowed Time is currently bugged. It was bugged in the PTB already, not activating at seemingly random times, but now it seems to only not active on unhooks after all generators have been repaired.
---
Framerate seems higher on PS4 Slim, lagspikes are still prevalent however.
---
Oink!
---
Man. This sure is a relevant comment /s
---
Demise, Bloodline, Curtain call.
---
All of them!
---
Unless they played like morons, there was not way you could even win. 
---
Many 3 year olds lol. Not very well but they can play. It has to do with skill because if it didn't take skill you should be able to give that controller to an old lady or your girlfriend who doesn't play games or a 3 year old and they get a 4k. 
---
Could you fill me in?
---
MARGE!
---
Hoping for undead Evil Ash with the decayed face.
---
SALLY FOR-*jaw unhinges*
---
I don't use Ruin and do fine idk what you're talking about
---
You can and now will speak for *all* PS4 players
---
To be fair the clown is just as annoying as legion
---
Jesus, you are a daft cunt. The killer meta revolves around one perk. That is extremely unhealthy and make the game stale fast. But no, go off. I'm just complaining cuz I'm bad even though I hit 70% of the skill checks. Just make assumptions! That's Reddit for ya
---
&lt;3
---
I tend to get my best stuff done on Mondays and Tuesdays because these are my days off. Coincidentally, Tuesdays happens to be when something interesting with BHVR happens. 
---
Unfortunate, but I'm glad that my stuff is still being appreciated, nonetheless. :D
---
There are literally dozens of us
---
Killers shouldn't be compared to Hillbilly, similar to how every perk should not be as strong as NOED.  If anything Billy and Nurse should be nerfed some
---
I'm pretty sure the reasoning was that no one was putting spoiler tags which, per the subs rules, are required for leaks.
---
The buff was reverted, but it's also needed for some reason.
---
man this sure is not a salty surv who cries when killers actually stand a chance
---
/s
---
Yes it got nerfed. It has been more or less been reset to what it was originally was.
---
I'm taking a guess that Legion was the reason they nerfed it.
---
Actually really funny
---
well not really, no
---
It's absolutely a nerf.
---
Ahhh yeah that might be bad. Let's hope so! Good luck 
---
Why leak it the second the new chapter drops though?  If they wanted to fake leak it they should have slipped it into a bug fix patch a month or so from now.  That it only hit console and not PC too makes me think it was absolutely a mistake. 
---
This ranking system feels terrible. Two kills, no camping, one early dc, two gens done and last guy gets hatch, depip. I feel punished for the survs being terrible. Red ranks doesn’t feel like “weeding out people who don’t belong.” It feels fucking frustrating and poorly thought out.
---
Who’s the next killer? Do we have proof
---
But..didn't they said that they don't want to put license killers anymore in game or something like that? 
---
Awww, you’re no fun! 
---
Legion is two boys and two girls though??
---
\&gt;:((((
---
Damn. I was looking forward to it being useful. Oh well, I'm still going to use it as part of my legion build.
---
It's in the actual game on kyf on console so
---
https://youtu.be/F5OVEQ23KrA
---
https://youtu.be/cNy3cB_XmBw
---
And for the record a 2k isn't a win, and someone who literally plays the game for a living shouldn't be talking about how has to dodge swf groups now because you can't win against them. 
---
Thanks again! I hope you do as well! :))
---
I'm a killer main you fucking identity politics moron. I don't like having to rely on one perk to have a fighting chance at rank one. Is that a problem? Do you like HAVING to put ruin in your build on 50% of the cast to have a fighting chance? Do you ENJOY having less build options??? Fucking idiot
---
Yes, there are already 2 more male killers than female and then there’s Legion that also adds two more (it made sense in my mind but it probably doesn’t haha).
---
This perk looks pretty op...
---
That... Doesn't make any sense.
---
I still think it is that.
---
 It states you need to be hit 3 times to activate.
---
Then it states the next time you are fully healed, the killer can see your aura if you are farther than 16 meters away. 
---
Assuming it's an M1 killer... You get hit twice, get hooked. You get unhooked and than healed. The perk should not be active yet since you only got hit twice, so the killer should not be able to see you. You get in a chase and then get hit again, the perk is now active. 
---
If reading the perk right, if you heal from this state, the killer can now see you. 
---
What is really nice is that there are some killers who counter this. Pig's ambush, hillbilly chainsaw, leather face chainsaw, axes, legion frenzy. 
---
I'm inclined to agree with you on that. While 2 minutes is a long time in the early game, if the survivors go full immersion during that time and Ruin gets hit, it was all for nothing. 
---
Yeah, but if the killer is bad enough to chase someone for 5 gens, it's silly for the strongest runner on the team not to run the killer around for 5 gens while the stealth oriented players do their thing.
---
If the killer goes for it, that's their poor strategy. I play killer more than I play survivor and I have a rule to myself; never chase anyone for longer than a minute, especially if they're a strong runner that knows the loops. There's always weaker runners on the team.
---
What's even wrong with that? It's pretty fucking memeable and big news.
---
I get that. I honestly have a tough time playing against Clown. Like I just get mind blocked on what to do against him.
---
But that's mostly from not having enough experience on with playing against them. 
---
Wait someone needs to test this. Apologies I never fully read your post. In game, it says it reaches its max at 24%? It could be that they forgot to change the text. Are you on console or PC?
---
Since they explicitly state in the patch notes that its 16% I would assume that they have it mechanically set to that.
---
It saved me earlier so it's not always broken. Weird
---
The killer wasn’t powerless to catch him, it’s not an infinite if the killer runs it right. Plus it’s his fault he picked huntress, other killers have way less trouble on hard loops like that. The survivor did nothing wrong, got tunneled by a salty killer, and then called him a name on stream, not in game chat. 
---
Gen tapping, I think that is the name of it but it has been a while so that may be wrong
---
I'm on console so I wouldn't be surprised if they just forgot to update the text for us.
---
Lol what? You could make that argument about almost every perk that's been tampered with. Most recently DS. Dribble them and they won't use it, they made hooks spawn closer, the decreased the distance between hooks, and the killers STILL bleated until it got nerfed. NOED is even worse because it rewards failure as you've allowed all five generators get done and are given a speed boost as a reward.
---
I’m one of the people who downvoted you.  Address me if you have any issues.  I speak for the mob.
---
When did i talk about ds. Anyway when it was non-obsession ds, it wasn't.
---
*BHVR sees leak*
---
"We're doing a pretty bad job so far."
---
I think I'd rather partner it up with Discordance, since 3 of the gens will be out of the way they are more likely to pair up to work on the remaining gens together. 
---
That’s a big nut moment right there. I loooove Evil Dead. 
---
I'm going to be REAL disappointed if its not. Ash coming to DBD might actually save it for me.
---
&gt; https://twitter.com/GroovyBruce/status/1084190471469973504
---
Could have it be Evil Ash, The Tiger Mascot from Season 3 of Ash Vs Evil Dead, Killer Tree?
---
As a survivor it’s not like we don’t run adrenaline, we’ll make it, and at least one exhaustion perk every game
---
Two Claudettes were in the basement, the one who had the bear trap already died.
---
it doesn't make sense even more considering it's a perk from Bill and in Left 4 Dead you can't get up by yourself
---
Thanks and happy cake day!
---
Yeah, I’m done with this game until they take that shit out. 
---
Top of the leader board, fixing gens, in chase and unhooking just to depip.
---
How’s the FPS though 
---
Do I need to go my the library on his account or mine?
---
The fact that you not only found this series but also decided to meme it makes me very proud of this community.  I think we’ve done a pretty good job so far
---
Yeah I don't like limitations on build. Feels like you have to have ruin and I always run BBQ just for the bloodpoints cause this game is already such a grind. To have your BP doubled is amazing. I wish more perks implemented the double blood points thing on killers AND survivors. Their BP perk doesn't even give any other benefit.... With ruin and BBQ my builds consist of 2 changing perks unless I want to make a sacrifice in some really nice quality of life aspects.
---
Oh wow.  That is a whole lot of work.  Thank you for breaking that down.  That's silly.  
---
But did you wear the shaw though?
---
Lazy? No. They release new content regularly and work their ass off to improve this game. I think you're very entitled to consider this lazy. Don't forget they have to make models, textures, materials and all that for each asset on the map, as well as making sure everything works and it looks good. I think Plague's map is interesting and well made. It doesn't matter that it's on Red Forest. We need more map variety in realms.
---
Ah then the first Claudette was fine.  Doing this to the second one is absolutely holding the game hostage and should be reported.  
---
Oof. 
---
You realize you basically proved my point right?
---
You said you would find examples of Tru getting Wrecked by SWF:
---
\-In the 1st Link he finished with 3 Kills and DOUBLE PIPPED
---
\-In the 2nd Game he finished with 2 Kills and PIPPED
---
\*\*He did not get close to Wrecked in either game. In your 2 examples of getting Wrecked, he averaged 3 Kills and 1.5 Pips. Game 1 was a Landslide Killer Victory. Game 2 was basically a Draw
---
Why was self care nerfed then? Just don't allow them to heal and they'll never get a chance to use it.
---
Brand new part? Don't let them near a generator and they'll never use it.
---
We could make that tired argument about everything killers have whined and cried about. But killers whinge more so they get the buffs and survivors get nerfed. Case and point DS nerf, NOED untouched. Numerous changes were made to counteract DS and killers still couldn't handle it so they just broke it for them.
---
I think we did a pretty good *job*
---
One thing I totally forgot to test was if Mettle of Man works when you escape yourself from a Trapper trap when the trapper is running the Honing Stone add-on. 
---
Nice work, best have a Dwight hiding in that darkness though.
---
Wait did they leak something?
---
The pools only cleansed me didnt heal. So maybe bug 
---
Ah, okay! Thanks! 
---
You would have gone down anyways, so why not extend the chase for a bit longer?
---
I lover that you used Bill and Meg as the dumb suggesters since they are always the stupidest players in game
---
[Groovy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhZYAL_7nMg)
---
Well, they don't get punished either way. They just get to secure their kill and they'll move onto the next person they can down and stand in front of.
---
There really needs to be an actual way to punish it.
---
This is so perfect!
---
I mean if you want the WGLF stacks, at least wait until they're nearing the end of their phase to unhook them, so maybe let the killer be punished for 50 seconds and then approach the hook and save
---
I thought Enduring did not work on it ? At least that is what everyone reported on PTB ....
---
Honestly, it won't pair well with ruin, but it will probably replace it in the high ranks, since there the survs can hit greats anyway, or already know all the totem locations and will therefore find the totem within the first 2 minutes anyway, so Corrupt Intervention will give more benefits than ruin in most cases.
---
Using "their" isn't technically wrong: [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/their](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/their)
---
I'd love the cabin as a map for Ash, but I don't care too much if they don't include evil Ash as a killer, which it doesn't seem they will. 
---
apparently there was a leak of perks for ash williams from the evil dead franchise (it would have to be evil dead 1 ash cause he is too badass from 2 on to let monsters hook him)
---
Like george washington once said:
---
"Fuck legion im dc'ing"
---
Flip-Flop is basically the new D-Strike if it is a thing. Though mettle of man is also pretty good. Buckle up seems the least useful.
---
Plague who?
---
I mean it may not be punishment for them but the camping will take them out of high ranks if you aren't near the hook, so you won't have to deal with them anymore
---
His 
---
The perk is fairly complex. Check the front page post about leaked perks.
---
Could this also be used as a anti tunneling perk?
---
No worries then, just don’t want others to misunderstand how they work. 
---
We get it, get some new material. 
---
I really don't like this girl's videos. Something about her just rubs me the wrong way. I don't know if I find her extremely annoying or unbearable or whatever, but it's just grating. Not to mention her gameplay is DEFINITELY not something to write home about either. 
---
You have to do one or the other against good players. You can't get a kill without it.
---
Veemo!
---
I had this exact scenario play out. I guess I was meant to hang out after the game and make the killer chase me around so I could pip?
---
This update doesn't feel like it takes more skill to rank up, but instead it takes more luck of opportunity to do the things required to pip. 
---
At the Product Testing Facility:
---
Lab Tech 1: Pleasing smell.
---
Lab Tech 2: \*marks note-pad\*
---
Lab Tech 1: Some monster-ism.
---
Lab Tech 2: \*marks note-pad\* 
---
That's not due to lagswitching. As I said, lagswitching on dedicated servers is impossible. 
---
dog shit trash tbh, im losing rank by winning games, just had a game where the killer was afk the whole time, we do 5 gens and escape = lose rank.
---
 Just gonna play something else till this garbo trash is fixed.
---
 If you bothered to open up your eyes and see you would realise there aren't many sheep. Many of the "sheep" comments you see are usually the same people, both those flaming Legion and the ones defending him. Others just make a passing comment and don't go deeper than that.
---
That’s Feng. 
---
Potential for killer yes a waste, but they released paragraphs before so I wouldn’t be surprised. I am surprised however that this passed through. 
---
The replies sum up why NOED is left the way it is. Killers are much more vocal in their complaints of survivor perks and defence of their own shitty tactics. I don't mind the take that DS was a crutch perk, but you can't say DS was and NOED wasn't. Basically every survivor perk is cheap and a crutch. And no killer perks are. That's the view of this sub.
---
Hello everyone!
---
We are aware of the achievement issue. It has been entered in our data and the issue will be fixed eventually in our next patch. Thank you ! 
---
Exactly, it’s very frustrating. 
---
Shit I meant chapter sorry. 
---
Parkinson’s?
---
Lisa is feeling herselffff! Go off queen
---
Yeah, considering Evil Dead quite literally made Sam Raimi (and rightfully so, I love every movie in the series) it's understandable that him and Bruce Campbell are super thrilled about all things Evil Dead.
---
Wow you been scrolling for a while to find this on new
---
BRUH I WANT HER BUTT; I DONT HAVE MONEYYYYY
---
FTFY!
---
Was it always like that though? I coulda sworn I always got the map regardless of % unless another map offering was brought. I could just be losing it though.
---
I bet you got camped by the rank 20 that really didn't know how to play. Pretty funny though. 
---
Thanks a lot and no problem!
---
I've repaired the temple generator in two games and escaped without a single scratch twice now as well without it popping. Pretty sure they're bugged.
---
Not necessarily. It means they'll likely rank down, but there's a huge rash of killers who do this at ranks 20 - 14, so as a survivor, it can be really difficult to get out of those ranks. Altruism is a big part of pipping, and camping killers takes that away from you.
---
Yup. I have so many good ideas for builds, but they don't stand a chance because I have to use ruin at high levels on every killer but nurse and Billy 🤷‍♂️
---
I highly doubt they would create content without first having  license agreements set in place. It would be such a time waste if the agreement never gets “agreed”. The MOST that’ll happen is the leaker gets fired. 
---
Guess it broke?
---
WTF? Jeff is a top, not a bottom. How dare you. 
---
Haha love it 
---
I don't get it, why would you have it on lvl3? 
---
AvED is way recent though, getting, sadly, cancelled just mid last year after its amazing third season, so it makes sense but Im sure they'll have some old references in there soemwhere
---
God, those skins are dope, and let's Just appreciate the highly detailed Doctor skin
---
Yeah i had some internet troubles a few months ago survivors hate you lol
---
same happened to me, all the gens were done and the gates were open &amp; it didn't work, I think it worked before the gates/gens were done/open
---
She only received one nerf and it was a nerf that was needed to prevent her from walking around the map puke ready. Other than that she got a bunch of qol buffs, so please, tell me how you find she got a massive nerf. 
---
Can you rephrase this ? Too complicated for my
---
Relatively Shitty english.
---
There’s no way to run that loop right as even a 115 killer on rancid abattoir, that’s the point. If the window spawns on the side wall and is protected by the rails then the survivor could run it indefinitely if there were no entity blockers, and will run it a maximum of three times since there are.
---
And yes the survivor called him a name on stream, he is still an asshole. The huntress didn’t know that and tunneled because of the tile abuse so she’s still an asshole as well, but the streamer is an asshole too.
---
I doubt it. They lose the surprise factor and fan theorisation of the next chapter. It also could potentially harm them because its a licensed character meaning having this leak will reflect poorly on them which might lead to the company pulling out their agreement.
---
Considering how the console version is where you can only find these leaks and that some of the console perks like Unbreakable description have been broken, it's likely that it has been rushed programming with the perks and it was accidentally not set to hidden. 
---
If the leaks were deliberate, it would have more likely happened on all platforms to increase the hype and it would be closer to the release of the new Chapter. Having it now is too early especially with the release of the plague meaning that the hype they built would die down after a few months. It also ruins the hype of the mystery behind the DLC. When they released the Demise teaser images it created tons of hype as it allowed fans to create their own fantasies of the killer and new survivor.
---
Saw and Halloween are designated as Chapters too, FYI.
---
I read “This is” sorry qt &lt;3
---
Could be cool
---
Haha yeah that's why i got excited cause it looked very clean
---
No, aside from losing a little bit of speed while holding the puke at 100%, she actually got buffed.
---
How does the new pip system work?
---
Yeah I actually don’t care about killer rank. Killers are just BP farms for me now. Playing console version with killer sucks. 
---
Because potentially getting sued for using someone's IP is a good April Fools joke
---
Ahhhhh this is cool as fuck, please let the Surv be Ash!!
---
You’re right. It could be true if the leaks were sooner, but day after this patch, probably ur right
---
Word. If you get tunneled, you just get depiped. 
---
You're completely ignoring half of Freddy's power:
---
Any asleep survivor suffee massive penalties that slow the game to a crawl.
---
Freddy is the best tracker in the game, because he gets free wallhacks to anyone asleep and outside his terror radius.
---
Freddy requires a different playstyle than "run loops".  Try this: sleep as many people as possible and instead of blindly chasing, constantly track the survivors and drop chase with one to get to another.  Gen progress will halt completely, and you'll secure a slow but inevitable 4k
---
Lmao thanatophobia nerf. BHVR has no clue what's going on in their own game. Disgraceful
---
So check lockers when I get the perk. Got it. Easy hooks.
---
It does. It sucks the most for solo players &amp; encourages more SWF, because its easiest for a communicating SWF team to get someone off of a hook (as long as its not a Hillbilly, Myers, Leatherface--instadown killers who are notorious for this, because nothing can really stop them).
---
They went all kris Kardashian 
---
Fake,you can tell by the way its worded compared to the other perks
---
&gt;Being good at a killer doesn’t make him good
---
But by that logic why is Nurse considered S tier?
---
The limit does not exist. 
---
You do well against 4man rank 1 squads as mid tier and low tier killers without ruin???
---
I would say, yes. Simply because it has more hype at the moment than the new chapter which just released. Maybe not
---
I always thought the road-map said more licensed killers than just one a year?
---
Or was it 3 original and 1 licensed per year, every 3 months?
---
BHVR: "OOPSIE WOOPSIE!! Uwu We made a fucky wucky!! A wittle fucko boingo! The code monkeys at our headquarters are working VEWY HAWD to fix this!"
---
i thought the same.. i was watching for the ruin pop lol...... i havent made it home to play yet, so is Plague = DC a thing now??
---
*Thanathophobia exists*
---
To BHVR: Am I a joke to you?
---
The new piping system isn't even focused on skill though. You literally have to do SO MUCH. And if the killer isn't doing well YOU get punished. The scoring system is based on how others perform and not just you. Rank 1 is gonna be pretty empty after rank reset if they don't fix this.
---
as a reminder, make sure to make your Account the one the ps4 automatically logs into, worse thing you can do for your buddy is log him out as he's getting a 4k
---
and he will need to be online(connected to the internet)  to run digital games on his ps4, this has to do with the licensing on digital content 
---
Yeah god forbid survivors from having strong perks, how dare they. 
---
Yes, but she’s speaking a dead language
---
At least you can get 4ks.....I am struggling really hard as her idk what I'm doing wrong but I think she's trash
---
Is that the infinity gauntlet?
---
It reminds me of what the rank system used to be like before you could rank up for breathing.
---
Ayyyyyyy!
---
Early game is hard for many reasons, not only that. On higher play NOED isn't really good tho
---
If something is getting nerfed then that means it was too strong at one point with the current meta. 
---
You’re doing a great job promoting discussion and not just being a condescending dick 
---
US Government on both sides already oversteps the constitution to a ridiculous degree, but I'll digress since it's not really the place to discuss it.
---
the clown ate my fucking finger i will never forgive him
---
How did they fuck up the sounds again? Chase music is way too load, as killer you cant hear an injured survivor when hes right in your face.
---
People who run the discord are not BHVR.
---
No problem. Sorry, I didn't notice you were her or else I would've probably held back on some of the stuff I said lol. Nice to see you're so unbothered by it though. :) 
---
No. That's Ash's prosthetic hand from the the tv show: Ash vs Evil Dead. 
---
Pretty much a useless Perk
---
I do not care about legal ramifications or whatnot.
---
If we get an Evil Dead DLC I will fucking buy it in a heartbeat. I love Evil Dead. 
---
Who would be the killer though? The Darkness? A Deadite? Evil Ash? 
---
*Freddy grunts*
---
All the quotes come from the TV show, so maybe something related to that?
---
I keep getting matches where everyone dies within seconds/not doing generators. Killers are making 22k on average and survivors are making 5k. It’s frustrating to play rn 
---
In the first game he actually got no kills. Not to say that it’s really relevant as firstly, he got huntresses worst map, and second, spent a decent bit of the game wasting time. Pair those with the fact that he really doesn’t play very optimally or try to apply pressure, what can you do. 
---
Ah, thanks. Seems like a really weak perk though as you end up getting forced to play injured through the whole match or heal yourself and have the killer permanently aware of your position.
---
Bit concerned about Buckle up. Strongly counters Knock out. 
---
Suppose it makes Hex: Third seal more useful though.
---
dont you get it, dont u seee? evil dead is behind this too. its a conspiracy man
---
I totally didn't photoshop the 48 into an 18 because my wifi was terrible this morning.
---
“what is it with those dwights? always running to the locker!”
---
I got a 4K just now with the Plague. Brutal killer. At rank 11. 
---
What the actual fuck, behavior?
---
I tried new DS and omg it's so good.
---
lmao, i needed a good laugh, well done 
---
How could this be fake when it happened to EVERY CONSOLE PLAYER?
---
Sure does, yours is closer than my shitty ass name though lmao
---
Good? Bad? I'm the guy with the gun.
---
How did they manage to screw up the sounds again? The chase music in insanly loud you cant even hear a injured person right in front of your face.
---
Now we have to wait 5 weeks again for a fix and killer is pretty much unplayable during this time...
---
What are you not able to understand? You're "hoping" that lagswitching doesn't work on dedicated servers, yet it is an actual fact that lagswitching doesn't work on dedicated servers. Never has done, and never will do. Dedicated servers mean that the gameplay itself it hosted by the devs, and not a player in the match. The host is currently the killer, which is why they can lagswitch. Hence, when dedicated servers arrive, the killer will no longer be able to lagswitch. 
---
Thank you for he compliments take my upvotes
---
Dafuq
---
If it’s just ash it won’t be 3 months until it drops
---
How do you have the patience to play that hot mess? Lol now I’m dreading playing on my PS4 pro. 
---
All? There is no way they would only release licensed killers cmon.

Yoshikage Kira licensed killer when
---
Regular ash as the killer... he sees everyone as deadites....groovy 
---
They're boobs, they move.
---
Sma hi go at z to me lwa*was aaA
---
That’s because they were literally called the saw/Halloween chapter, the original killers all just have the chapters name 
---
It will also prevent dribbling.
---
At red ranks I played a strong game of looping the killer and doing some gens, but I only got a safety cause i didn’t get enough hook saves. It’s unrealistic to expect survivors to be able to have multiple winning chases, unhooks, and generators, while hopefully still escaping, just to pip up.
---
Flip Flop + Tenacity would go great together.
---
That’s when you stop wiggling and pray for nice boi  killer 
---
Yesterday they were in a locker together, now just doin it in the open? Cmon ladies, decorum!
---
Idk what rank you are at, but I’m rank 10 and I feel like I’ve been playing with rank 20 survivors and rank 1 killers lol
---
I'd be wary of using them. It could fall under a potential ban. Just being cautious for yah.
---
one of these things is not like the other, one of these things just doesn't belong 
---
Crazy theory - What if this is an accidental leak but not of the next chapter but of an April fools prank? Like this was supposed to be "leaked" on April 1st but was actually leaked early.
---
I’m Commander Shepard and this is my favorite post on the sub 
---
You've got a lot to learn about this ~~town~~ subreddit sweetie
---
All good tips I feel it takes entirely way too long to puke until broken in a chase idk how it works but I keep hitting them and Utah like 4 to 6 full pukes for them to become broken....she might not be for me or I just have shit perks atm I really need bbq but it wont show up
---
Why do you care? Is it about "inclusion"? The stack is almost 50/50
---
Same, idk what’s happening :(
---
What if the ultimate meme is that all the quotes are by Ash but the survivor is actually Mia from the remake lol
---
I remember seeing two of these perks suggested here before
---
teh next 4 killers will be licensed
---
I'm on console it's 28.08gb
---
9~ gigs
---
If onto everybody on Reddit was like you and didn't just assume I was a complaining survivor main LMAO. Maybe then this sub could have legitimate, healthy discussions about game balance lol
---
Pretty sure it was intended as a joke friend 
---
Does that show have some sort of big bad they could fit in the game?
---
I need to see her myself to make a real judgment but she isn’t even thicc SHES DUMMY THICC
---
I feel like I do all of that and still get 17k point games. lol
---
So thicc she actually blocks the killer's view partially.
---
Have you ever actually known a woman with large breasts? I'm married to one, and I will tell you, they bounce, a lot. Even with minimal movement, let alone running. Even when contained in a sports bra, they still move a lot, to the point where it can make a woman sore. Keep that in mind.
---
Well if you play console you atleast have a slim chance of running into my dumbass dicking around as her :P
---
It's her best outfit for a reason. Watch everyone buy and run it, guaranteed.
---
i just tested on low settings same FPS as ultra. Only 30.
---
I am having game crashes....like lags tf out and crashes. 
---
jeez sorry dude 
---
*Sweats in Tiandi main*
---
yeah 
---
My biggest issue is if I commit to puking till broken....it takes so good damn long like if I just infect hit and then move on they full heal at a fountain....idk she's very confusing
---
I mean, Bubba was a standalone killer so it would make sense for a stand alone survivor to even out the ratio.
---
Currently on 25 but still going strong.
---
I honestly wonder what was showing on the killer’s screen
---
How is the new DS crap? 
---
Do you not know what Evil Dead is?
---
which actually makes a lot of sense
---
I don't know about amazing, but it'll counter slugging decently. Tenacity/Flip-Flop/Boil Over would be an great combo against a slugger. Tenacity your way into a corner while flip flopping, then boil over the killer.
---
Yeah I keep getting an EAC report even though there was no issue yesterday. Just trying to play my spitty girl :(
---
So Enduring does its job and that's a bad thing?
---
My two guesses are Deadite Linda or Evil Ash.
---
Ooh yes. If they’re gonna use any monster from that show it should be him. 
---
Imagine thinking this game is survivor sided. There are survivor sided maps like Haddonfield which absolutely need to be changed but for the most part you’re in control of the match as a killer if you’re decent.
---
I’d rather them focus on making sure the game works than making sure the achievements do
---
i was getting deja vu, then i noticed this was actually me! youre welcome haha, got ya with that locker stun ;)
---
When are the new outfits coming?
---
Gotta main my bro Ash.
---
fake yet i can see it in KYF on PS4 right now.
---
your doing it wrong,
---
you apply directly to thicc cheeks to add stun time
---
The plague of Deadites Ash has to fight obviously.
---
The post has restored my strength. 
---
Eyy, gg man. You kinda did, I forgot about her perks lol. I saw you go into the locker but forgot to turn my camera in time like an idiot lmao. Thanks for buying that outfit and giving me laughs 
---
I'm just wondering if anyone is gunna ask if the source of the leak was fired in the next Q and A. 
---
&gt; There are a lot of technical aspects to him.
---
:/
---
I mean Ash would just roundhouse the killers but this is still cool I guess, even if it ruins half the point of Ash as a character like Freddy.
---
Lol your super late edit
---
Did they fix the vaults that won't work when fast vaulting?
---
Chipmunk sounds from Huntress were so cute! \*Squee\*
---
It won’t remove status effects like blindness from third seal or exposed from make your choice, but it will remove all sickness effects and give you full uninjured unless you’re using no mither.
---
I legit upvoted for the TF2 reference. 
---
Are you always butthurt or are there moments of exception?
---
Is there a perk to make your survivor not make sounds for coughing or puking? The calm spirit doesn’t help. I was thinking maybe iron will, but I haven’t tested it yet. 
---
Heh, I’m getting that as well but I’m still getting a ton of kills. Partially due to her strength and partially do to it being a new mechanic for survivors. 
---
She’s still new, we’re all still learning and getting used to her. As for the scoring, that’s something the devs are going to have to sort. 
---
Found the 12 year old.
---
Also true. 
---
yeah, it was literally fine until i updated. apparently loads of people are having the same issue. i swear this update is one of the worst they've done in a while, what with this, leaking a licensed survivor, bugged perks and broken achievements.
---
Oh neat!
---
It's hilarious. Now that Enduring is finally, *actually* the counter to Decisive Strike that survivors have been arguing it's been for years, the salt flows. 
---
i didn't want to pay to play online anymore like i had to with my XBox One and all of my friends play on PC, so i deal haha.
---
Didn’t unlock for me on Xbox 
---
I've seen plenty of people do just fine without Ruin.
---
Whoa you can do that? That's creepy af lol. 
---
I was making a joke about it slipped into the console because they don't care about em :P
---
It would be a little disappointing but I. Still really excited for Ash 
---
It is really hard, I played 5 games in a row. 4 kills everygame.  only once survivors finished more than 1 generator. results: 1 black pip, 3 single white pips, 1 double pip. 
---
I just unlocked my adept Jane 👍🏻
---
Some of those quotes and icons are from the show. Safe to say the Ash we’re getting is chubby 40 year old Ash, which is fine with me. 
---
Perfect timing for all whom “needs” adrenaline to survive 
---
***Spoiler warning!***
---
Title : **EVIL DEAD DLC** leaked
---
Thank god there was a spoiler warning. 
---
oof man, oh well, people say they want honesty anyway.
---
Ik thats a really good perk. Combine it with sprint burst for gen jockey to get away quickly
---
well, when i play legion, i don't really try to get kills anymore, right now i see legion as a kind of bloodpoint farmer. i try to get a bunch of stabs, a few hooks here and there but when i chase survivors, i just swing at them wildly because feral frenzy has little to no cooldown to missed attacks. now believe it or not, missing attacks and letting people live is fun for me when i play legion. and hey, everybody wins in that scenario, right? i get bloodpoints, they get bloodpoints and escape! until legion is reworked, i shall continue playing them like that.
---
eh still don't think it to be too strong, m1 killers get dunked by it but m1 killers are kind of shit anyways so they get the low end of the shorter stick more often than not, I just view this as a middle finger to legion so I love it.
---
Fixed an issue that caused Bitter Murmur not to show all Survivors' auras when the last generator was repaired, and for less than 5/7/10 seconds respectively.
---
Omg thank God!!!
---
It's been reverted because of Legion.
---
Being an asshole isn’t capital punishment. He gave the killer a rough time by abusing poor map design, the killer gave him a rough time by abusing the power they have at their disposal. Then a streamer who was already being judgmental (evidenced by their comments about OP’s decision to chase) gets angry and begins to make crude remarks when the killer responds harshly by tunneling them. Both people are assholes. The streamer for being hypocritical and toxic and OP for deciding to take justice into his own hands.
---
OP literally stated that they don’t mind loops, they’re obviously a core part of the game, but the issue comes when people abuse broken tiles that the killer doesn’t have any influence on whatsoever.
---
So yah, tyl that being hypocritical about how someone should play, and talking down on someone to other people does make you an asshole.
---
“You’re a killer Nea”
---
Hilarious. Now that Enduring is finally, *actually* the counter to Decisive Strike that survivors have been arguing it's been for years(it hasn't), the salt is flowing. But guyz, I thought that killers were supposed to run Enduring if they want to avoid DS, you all told me that.....what happened??? 
---
Were you partied with the lower ranks
---
So take out NOED and Warden at same time before they even start? I like it. 
---
What would his Mori be? I'd imagine something like actually using the laser rifle to shoot and kill the survivor on the ground.
---
I believe it’s in a much better spot and overall stronger, to be honest. If I worded it like that, please point it out, but do understand I don’t see this as a normal nerf as if it’s fully useless or a bad perk. Even as a solo player, I’m hype for this change because I fucking hate tunnelers and want to fuck them over with this. 
---
That'd be funny, but if you look at the original post it says "Ash Williams perk" or something along those lines
---
Nevermind, I just read further down that you're not sharing it "yet" so I went ahead and made my own.
---

---
Lol the game already looked like PS2 tier graphics, now I hear its worse... OPTIMIZATION PASS BTW
---
Most likely a new DS. It is essentially a chase extender like the old DS was. It does feel more balanced however than the old DS. It gives 2 extensions as well, maybe more if you can escape the killer.

Mia is basically Nea

BHVR: Hey, everyone! Do you want a good patch? :)
---
Community: Yes!
---
BHVR: Sure? Yeah? You want it? :)

Community: Oh boy, yes plea--

BHVR: FUCK. YOU. FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU!!!
---
Yep. Really annoying. 
---
"TRY HARDER!!!!" -BHVR
---
in all sincerity, what they mean to say is:
---
"DO EVERYTHING DESPITE HOW SITUATION-ALLY POINTLESS OR STUPID IT IS!" 
---
i never saw this perk and i go through my survivor perks regularly. 
---
thanatophobia was said to be buffed. 
---
Was 14 down to 16. Killers have been 14, 16, 17, 17 and 20. All the plague 
---
You know he cooking that special chili tonight
---
Am roxxy Andrews and am here to make it clear . 
---
I don’t think bhvr is big enough to fire someone over leaking a survivor 
---
Just went into kill your friends and yea, They are just sitting there 
---
same here. usually i only get 300+ ping killers when the player numbers are at its low (like playing super late or super early) or when i'm unlucky, but right now i get super shitty ping killers all the time. i have to leave lobbies multiple times until i get someone who has a ping lower than 200...
---
Well yeah, what do you think is in that Black Box add-on?
---
Try opening a ticket then
---
Yo, what's the name of the music? The YouTube description links to the website but not the specific track.
---
I'm talking about the puppet, lol
---
She’s honestly midtier imo, I’m a killer survivor switch and I don’t think she’s too op. She needs accuracy with her vomit and sometimes her vomit is just broken on inclines. Most of the maps are not in her favor cause there are too many boxes to hide behind, and her power only helps in the later chase when she actually is able to get the survivor into the broken state using her throw up. I’m not dissing you or anything I’m just stating the reasons why I personally don’t believe she is overpowered.
---
*laughs in T E N E B R I S*
---
Heh, thanks!            I used that with complete sincerity, though.        Characters like Spy excel at the height of a match's calamity &amp; uproar.           But once he shows his hand?         People start Spychecking and maybe even swap-up for a Pyro to pocket &amp; protect Medic.
---
Pretty sure it will just be a stand alone chapter like bill and LF
---
Based on the perk icons, he's gonna have his metal gauntlet from Army Of Darkness in all likelihood.
---
Alright. 
---
Hey u/siberlily they used our screenshot because I can see your dumb red Dwight :^)
---
He wasn’t being hippocritical, holy shit the killer bias is real. He was near a strong loop so he went to it, and then the killer punished him for playing the game by tunneling him and denying him the chance to play. Judge mental? Lmao he fucking commented on why a huntress was running a loop she has a huge disadvantage at and wondered why the killer was making the mistake of following him through it. 
---
Saying he deserved toxicity because he ran a strong loop is like saying killers who use the basement deserve to be tbagged and chain blinded all game. 
---
He did nothing hippocritcal, he did nothing toxic, and he did nothing to be an asshole. Unlike the killer who intentionally tunneled him out of the game and then got offended because the guy made a comment about him playing like a bitch (which he did) on stream, where the only reason the killer saw it was because he pulled up his stream. 
---
And fucking lol at “broken tiles”. Literally all you have to do is chase them through the loop enough for it to get blocked off, or ya know just go find someone else if you know it’s gonna take forever to catch them. 
---
I heard it's inconsistent as long as you take a offering and/or a item with you 
---
Bruce Campbell as a survivor would be the best thing ever
---
Oh, yeah, no, lots of people are dealin' with it. I dunno what it is that's causing it, but I've seen a lot of people getting to a certain point and the game just dies.
---
The point that “it becomes a hassle to cleanse totems if you’re playing solo” is a really cheap way out of it. You are not forced to play solo, you are queuing up, no one is doing it for you. And by that you should no that playing solo is a lot harder than SWF, you cannot communicate as well about things like who/where the killer is, what perks/add-ons they have. So by queuing up alone you are deliberately making the game harder for yourself, how can you then sit and complain about NOED, if there is a simple solution, play SWF. And if you say “But I have no one to play with” you are wrong. You can just join the DBD discord and always have people to play with.

The Left Behind perk is also glitched out. It's description is "PERK_console_leftbehind_DESC"
---
The new achievements don’t get done after completion.. Did the adept Jane and the generator twice on the new map, but the achievement is still not completed.
---
maybe they could use ruby from ash vs evil dead
---
xena warrior princess and ash in the same game would be great
---
Oh man how are they going to destroy ashs beautiful face with dbd graphics 
---
So good but my wallet can't handle it
---
&gt;Dead Hard  
---
&gt;Sprint Burst
---
Whoopsie-daisy.
---
i didnt get the adept plague achievment when i got a merciless with her 3, they may not be working properly, but steam also wont load my profile or anything other than the library so...
---
Dealers choice, honestly.            I have been meaning to go through Ash Vs. The Evil Dead again, though &amp; I recall there being a pretty wide "monster of the week" hodgepodge.                
---
maybe baal
---
When unhooking a survivor vs Plague, we are getting poisoned even if that survivor or hook wasn’t poisoned.
---
Not really. More of a hidden evil master mind that becomes a reluctant ally and an evil, possibly sentient, Necronomicon.
---
I am not caught up on the 3rd season.
---
Evil Ash  makes an appearance though.
---
I agree, I learned a long time ago to only play Spy for a small amount of time and then switch to another class when the heat got too high. I was actually featured in one of Funke's videos. Sadly I can say that my younger self was an asshole and if you see the video you'll see what I mean. Hell I'm using the same username in the video (just King MikeOTR)
---
Whoa.... I can't believe that. 
---
I always wanted a charger skin for billy although it's never gonna happen
---
He does this every day on this subreddit, like constantly. Go check his post history for some cringe. When you pointed out how his claim of how “numerous survivor perks have been buffed” was ridiculous (because all it did was “buff” the tier 1/2 perks and a slight change of tier 3 kindred) he goes and talks about the leaked Evil Dead survivor perks (which had nothing to do with what you’re talking about) because he didnt have an argument.
---
Constantly moving the goal posts, constantly changing everything to fool himself into believing he’s a victim, it must be exhausting doing that everyday for a game where you unironically *hate* people who play the other side. I used to be annoyed with his posts but now I cant feel anything but pity when reading his comments. Its honestly just pathetic.
---
He shouldnt play this game since he obviously hates it so much, **he’s genuinely more toxic than any survivor I’ve ever seen**. Whats sad is that he probably wont ever stop since killer bias on this subreddit is so strong his batshit crazy comments get upvoted by other reddit killers who are exactly like him. Just sad.
---
Bill wants a word with you.
---
The problem is no one cleanses dull totems. Every time I play survivor, I see people running past totems every trial to find the Ruin totem.
---
Survivors will continue to be punished by NOED until they start cleansing them. It shouldn’t be something you occasionally do, it should be something you always do. Everyone is blaming the perk for lazy game play.
---
That was also my first thought 
---
Definitely lower resolution on my PS4 Pro / 55" OLED TV. Not much difference in fps, maybe a little better. 
---
I can see how the FPS optimisation would be more noticeable on base PS4 / Xbone. 
---
I guess this is all part of their optimisation plans. Lower the resolution to temporarily improve FPS before they release the new code rewrite. 
---
Fuck this game
---
Like Mistar\_Z said barely anyone plays Clown so not a lot of people have experience going against him. I've played him enough that I can counter him pretty well as Survivor but I've legit gone against like maybe 7 Clowns since he came out, whereas in that same timeframe I've probably gone against over 100 trappers and 100 Huntresses.
---
Yeah from the sound of it they lowered graphics in order to get better frame rate is what I heard. 
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
don't know why all the downvotes, you're completely correct.
---
why am i hard 
---
The entire game does not revolve around this perk. All you have to do is hit great skill checks. Most of the perks in dead by daylight can be considered “unfun”.
---
Had to celebrate!
---
It’s bad because the company wants to set ‘reveal’ events to generate hype. Making a trailer, posters, teasing information, etc. That’s all lost now (though a trailer will still be hype).
---
When it comes to public perception, non-diehard fans will be briefly interested during a reveal, but after 3 months? That interest can easily be replaced by something new in that time.
---
It’s great for us lovers of Evil Dead and DbD, though!

---
I went with the shape simply because I love Michael Myers. Sorry I know that doesn't help but he's just so creepy😁
---
It's a replacement for DS that isn't as punishing to the kill early, I think it's fine. 
---
Yeah first hook deaths are the fkin worst
---
I doubt it.  BHVR has really bad leadership. 
---
Lmfao okay 
---
Buckle up just seems like a weaker version of Unbreakable.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NOED helps good killers the same way it helps bad ones, it's going to activate the same way every single time, whether the killer was trash or whether they're MLG. If you didn't cleanse totems than it's going to proc. But you can say that "only bad players do ____" about anything, it doesn't make it true. You know what? Good survivors don't wipe to NOED. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doing gens isn't your objective, escaping alive is. Repairing them are just a means to that end. And sometimes, countering or avoiding NOED is, too. So if you died then you didn't actually complete anything. 
---
If evil dead will come I can probably get my dead to buy this game. He loves the evil dead movies and buys almost everything related to it 
---
I never noticed she sliced the same place she was cut. Good observation.
---
Usually only no skill killers use it. It should have speed penalty atleast.
---
We’ll Make It doesn’t seem to be triggering either. So I guess perks triggered by unhooks aren’t functioning right now. 
---
If thats the case we should've been given a choice because this is kinda hurting my eyes lol
---
just because your internet is fine doesnt mean red pings should stay... a red ping is a red ping.

Nice!    Yeah, Spy was my first main and while I'm comfortable on the other classes (Med, HWG in particular) none of them feel as *good* as Spy!             
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doing gens isn't your objective, escaping alive is. Repairing them are just a means to that end. Sometimes, so is avoiding or counering NOED, too. So if you died then you didn't actually complete anything.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just think the perk is too powerful, it's frustrating to make it all the way to the end of the match just to get one-shotted at the finish line.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The killer was playing with a handicap for 95% of the match, only using three perks. You might not have even lived until NOED's activation if the killer had taken a perk that would have been relevant for the whole match. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Look I just think it's an unfun perk.
---
yea i think thats bullshit. Someone got hooked, and just because another survivor unhooked them first, that means I should be penalized in a way? I literally started 3 of the generators by myself, I healed a player, and took out 3 totems....but since I didnt unhook anyone nor escape, I lose a pip? I got I think 18k BP from it, why the fuck am I punished for actually having a really good round?
---
Zig zag when running from her, the puke is a bitch to aim when people know what to do up close.

I mean I get everyone loves ash, and don’t get me wrong I liked evil ash in the movie but he’s just so goofy I don’t see them adding him 
---
Do they work? 
---
Backstory wise, no. Unless you're talking about remake Freddy of course. Remake Freddy is a mistake but he was the only one the devs could get for DBD so we'll have to make do which is why a lot of people just act like it's really the original Freddy in dbd and not the remake, myself included. 
---
Stay in a pallet. He'll throw a bottle and think you're blind. Throw the pallet down.  
---
Works every fucking time. They don't even try to mindgame.
---
They could disguise themselves as a survivor for x amount of time w/o a terror radius and then attack when someone’s guard is down. Basic attack could be any survivor, add ons could make it so you look like one of the survivors in game, add time to your disguise, etc. It would be sort of useless once there’s 1 survivor left though...
---
Apparently yes
---
She's fucked honestly...haven't won a match yet against her...zero counter play the puke has no delay it's a mess 
---
If you can maintain a stream of puke on someone for long enough, they get to the broken effect very fast, even without add-ons. When a survivor who is fully sick is taken off a hook, the rescuer I’ll be inflicted with sickness as well, forcing them to go and cleanse. She has a small amount of map pressure because of sickness, but not a ton. The key is corrupted purge. If you use it well enough, you will end chases very fast. When you can end chases fast, you can build momentum and potentially snowball. 
---
Give her time and get used to her. The only reason I have a good grasp of her is because I’ve been obsessively watching streamers play her for the past two weeks. She’s actually a very solid killer. Not the best, but far from the worst. 
---
Killer Queen has already turned that Exit Gate into a bomb.
---
Same I wish more console games offered PC like settings. ( I know I could just play the game on my PC but my friends refuse to switch on over)
---
I mean their reason for existence it to put on a show for the entity, not to immediately murder everyone 
---
Wow might have to try that out later with friends 
---
Because her ability allows her to ignore all obstacles in her path
---
I just don’t see the benefit, you’d rather risk de ranking than just taking the points and dying?, you’d rather throw your whole team under the bus so you don’t have to try? If you’re the first found and you dc right away... that’s also not getting tunnelled... that’s just being salty. It sounds (if your being serious) that your reasons aren’t logical, they’re emotional.
---
Notice how he says “you guys”. Meaning he doesnt even play HALF the game yet feels like sharing his opinion on balance in this game. Blatantly showing his bias as if it wasnt obvious enough.
---
The only buff I can think of for survivors in the past months is the medium vault change. Thats...pretty much it. 
---
https://youtu.be/iyuCblnkioA
---
"just hit skillchecks lul" is always my favorite response. Like I'm going to be able hit 20 greats. I can hit 14, but those six are still enough to stall thirty extra seconds and make the most tedious aspect of survivor even more annoying. And what if the other survivors can't hit checks? You're fucked cuz they are bad
---
Yeah I only piped once in the ptb, and that was 23k points. Awful, it disgusts me even thinking about it.
---
new achievements seem to all be bugged ATM
---
f
---
It's mostly lack of perks and inexperience is what makes killers strong. You can't balance all the perks around that or they will be bad for experienced players
---
On xbox the description hasn't changed, still says while in killer instinct. Still a complete pita to do 😣
---
It's literally playable on PS4, the perks work
---
*Myers is displeased*
---
No clue, but almost everyone was against that change but they did it anyway. At least they buffed her in other areas to compensate. 
---
They’re thinking about making pools heal you over time rather than instantly, so you would be healed to fill after a short duration after using a pool. Implement that along with her old movement speed and she’d be golden. From the way I see it anyway. 
---
The DLC literally came out today, of course it's going to be buggy. (Your grammar is wack)
---
Thing is all those other killers you can juke with misdirection or spins. The vomit is too forgiving because even if you miss the first bit of it it’s easy to get back on target with the tail end of it.
---
This would never happen but they could turn all the survivors into deadites and ash could fight against them
---
Honestly I think ruin is horrendously overrated. I play every single killer and one of my most played killers is Freddy. I haven't used ruin on him in months and I do mostly fine. Ruin is only good if the survivors are bad. 
---
Any sensible survivor is going to power through the gens. 
---
Then there is the RNG of when and how many skillchecks you'll actually get.
---
It doesn't even really matter cause they'll probably get the totem anyways.
---
I wish people didn't keep thinking that this overrated waste of a slot is something that is required. Games need to be slower, but Ruin doesn't do jack nor shit unless your survs are stupid.
---
I meant only one oopsie?
---
Yes, on the audio, it’s quite annoying.
---
As for the pools showing, yeah, sometimes I don’t see them. I assumed maybe you had to be within a certain distance or something. 
---
On what system has the resolution gone down? How do you know this?
---
Sure, but they've done this on several occasions. I love this game and will continue to play for many hours, but these devs are unreliable for quick bug fixes and notorious for pushing things out without QA doing much. 
---
i know it breaks them down, but it takes so damn long to get them into that state.  how does them cleansing make them easier in a chase? im just getting her to 40 for her perks and never touching her again.....pretty disappointing chapter, killer whos power does fuck all, the rank system is all over the place now, the map is pretty bland....i expected a lot more but at least DS is fixed that is about the one thing i am happy about.
---
Oh, nvm
---
What legal ramifications? If they've already licensed the character, they have permission to show them in the game. You'd have to be privy to some pretty specific points of their contract in order to know if there are any legal ramifications.
---
&gt; I don't think you're going to convince me it isn't, because it simply is, especially in a game where you are meant to be able to use stealth
---
It's crazy that you are just repeatedly ignoring that BBQ aura reading is 100% countered when you use stealth against it. Hiding in a locker or behind a gen or within the minimum range are all stealthy plays that prevent the killer seeing you. You keep arguing that BBQ is OP for global aura reading and ruining stealth but making those stealth plays are the absolute counter to BBQ, thus it's not OP at all, it's balanced with multiple avenues to counter it.
---
Yea it would have been great if that was added to the ptb some time over the two weeks it was sitting there.
---
I've been an Evil Dead fan since I was a little kid. This is so hype!
---
Yes but if the indicator is there then people will break totems anyway. It will just become a gamble of whether the killer still has it. Maybe increase totem break time and increase the amount of totems to counteract the knowledge because then it will slow the game down alot more.
---
A few hours ago everyone was able to see it plain as day in the KYF lobby. If it's faked it would have to be a mis-timed April Fools joke by BHVR themselves.
---
Yeah, Enduring makes the stun less than two seconds. I'll still have it on my build to pair it with Enduring.
---
They're not uncommon. 
---
Yea there’s a huge emotional component to why I d/c for sure.  Some of it has to do with garbage teammates but a lot of it is also just rotten luck.
---
Also I don’t really understand how the ranking system works or why it’s important.  The only thing that bothers me is losing high ranking items. That’s why I mostly don’t bring items or burn offerings anymore so that if it’s a Legion or if I have bad luck then I can just dip no consequence.
---
Thought the same. Would make sense as well..after that meeting in Canada with a hand of streamer, few of them were all like „don‘t spill the beans.“ guess this leak are the beans and it was fully planned in my opinion 
---
Idk 
---
Right, well that sounds like a failure of communication on your team's part. Have you tried designating a totem hunter in pre-game chat? I usually run gen rush builds and playstyles and I say so in the chat, if nobody wants to step up as the designated scavenger than I do it myself and swap Prove Thyself for Small Game or Detective's Hunch. 
---
But even if you can't find all five totems, at least try and memorize the location of the ones you cleansed so that you can eliminate those areas from your search if it procs.
---
Wow if they are doing that well I have no idea what to say. I hope it's not for that reason I have an Xbox one X and I feel like the game could run way better if they put a lot of time into it. 
---
Its not a bug.  Its the scoring system for points. This is about how they should change the trophy/achievement’s for the killer side to balance getting those better. (Ok Grammer Nazi.)
---
Just walk away Ace, just walk away. 
---
i'll try that out. thanks for the advice :}
---
That trapper skin is giving me mad “My Bloody Valentine” vibes. Love it. 
---
Its my all-time fav show, and there is a lot of classic and new villains that appear on that show, lots of choices! Looking forward to it!
---
Okay legion's cosmetics and backstory are a lot of fun and the devs when through a lot of effort to design this killer. ( I you love susie!)
---
It's just that he is not very fun to go against(kinda like freddy) and his power is more annoying than powerful.
---
I don't DC against legion but I do buckle myself down for what is most likely gonna ba a very painful game.
---
Like sweater boi I think legion needs a rework, Not a buff or nerf.
---
It seems too good to be true
---
Why does it say Ashley J Williams when you look at the part where it says "Super Rare (insert name) Perk" Is that his full name or is it actually a female?
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;I shouldn't have to run perks(Small Game, Detective's Hunch) just to counter my opponent's, if he doesn't have NOED than it's just a waste.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes you should, that's how balance works and you can't always prepare for every single loadout and circumstance.
---
Interesting to hear this argument coming from you because you were here crying in every “DS is OP” thread when someone told you to put on Enduring to counter DS.
---
And it gets worse, the difference between putting on Enduring to counter DS and putting on Detectives Hunch/Small Game to counter NOED is that Enduring is one of the best killer perks in the game and is a part of a meta build while Small Game and Detective’s Hunch are trash meme perks that arent even good at countering NOED
---
The actual counter to NOED for solo survivors? Dont use Adrenaline, use Hope. The haste effect negates the NOED speed boost and doesnt eat your exhaustion like Adrenaline does, so you can still loop and use dead hard/BL when the NOED killer comes for you. Hope is still good against killers without NOED because the Haste effect should make it so that you dont lose the loop unless you get outplayed.
---
Or if you’re really committed to the totem breaking game, a map with the add on to track killer belongings. These are the only two reliable NOED counters. I think NOED should stay in the game but it’s the speed boost is the real problem that needs to be removed. 
---
I love BHVR. 
---
TFW they say they optimize but in real they only lower graphics quality ;P
---
I had that happen too
---
Interesting view there
---
Checking Steam profiles on PC is still a thing.
---
better framereate? or at least  stable one.
---
I agree. My reaction right now is hesitant excitement.
---
I’m almost P3 on David so when I play clown I can mindgame the shit out of people. Still doesn’t save me from 4 flashlights, dead hard, and DS but man is it satisfying.
---
I managed to get the plague adept on my 2nd 4k, was on the game map when it popped, other than that there's been no visible progress for the other achievements sadly
---
I play nurse only bc of that haha
---
I get 4k without actually getting good points (somehow) based on all the achievement I've gotten the points don't actually matter, you just need to get a 4k and you get the achievement. Regarding the plague adept, other people were complaining and one of the staff actually stated they are working on fixing the bug (thank you for that title everyone calls me that)
---
Yes. They did stress that in doing these upcoming optimization passes, they wanted to make sure as to not sacrifice quality. So I also want to believe the current resolution downgrade is just a temporarily fix. 
---
According to the roadmap, I think we now just wait for the: new anti-aliasing, simplified shadows, optimized character outlines, imposter rendering for specific objects, baked lighting, etc.
---
Hopefully once some of these new systems/Code are implemented, the resolution will be restored, if not even better. 
---
bouta squeeze my hog
---
Spirit's HA just makes it look like she's giving you a really sarcastic laugh at your memery 
---
Unless they’re right up against you and you shoot over their head, or they’re too far away and ur hitting the ground, you have to slosh it everywhere to get any distance making you easy to juke, and anyone capable of a decent 360 (considering you can 360 a Bubba in rage) should have no problem dodging the majority. From there it just comes down to their add ons and how much damage is being dealt. Which anything below a green is np. Corrupted’s are easy to outplay as long as your not drinking wildly from fountains you’re close to. Making the killer have to go distances is the key there. I get you have your reservations... but I’ve already developed decent strats on each side, it’s just a matter of trial and error.
---
&gt;if you infect someone and hit them but dont down them its completely worthless since they just heal to full at fountains
---
Why are you infecting someone and hitting them before they become broken? And if they do this that means you have access to Corrupted purge anyways which turns you into a better Huntress. 
---
She seems pretty good still.
---
&gt;Interesting to hear this argument coming from you because you were here crying in every “DS is OP” thread when someone told you to put on Enduring to counter DS.
---
What's interesting about your post is that only *now* is Enduring a counter to Decisive Strike, and oh man let me tell you it's finally working just like you guys always pretended it would, as an *actual* counter. So yeah it's in a great place right now, have you tried it out so far? How have you been enjoying it?
---
Also it sounds pretty good for survivors. At least decent... 
---
That's why I'm being skeptical I don't wanna be excited for something that probably won't happen
---
Except this game is not competitive and is for fun. As long as I won, I don't care - was it with skill or not.
---
Why are so many people taking the bait
---
I have several builds I like on spirit 
---
Ruin, BBQ, pop goes the weasel, and haunted ground or discordance
---
Ruin, BBQ, knockout, make your choice
---
Or, as of the release of the new dlc I have played 3 games with a new build, corrupt intervention, BBQ, thanataphobia, sloppy butcher. This build seems to be seriously capable of slowing the game to a crawl without using ruin, in other words, slowing the game consistently, thanks to the buff to thanataphobia. I'm gonna play around with this setup more but this could easily be my new main build with her, and a few other killers.
---
Has text definitely changed? I knew it was always worded differently from how to achieve it. Its LITTERALLY the only achievement I don't have 
---
Silly question. Is devoted gateway backdated? Or starting from now 15 times?
---
I wonder who the killer will be in that case, yes a deadite probably but I am curious if it will b a certain particular one

There’s tons of screenshots when it was available, I saw it myself when I finished downloading the patch. I’m not sure if it’s still there but don’t automatically assume it’s fake with that mindset.

Why you posting the same thing everyone else has already posted 1000 times already?
---
An evil spirit killer that can briefly possess enemy survivors and turn them into deadites
---
Hey im on xbox lol so at least you get good frames
---
DS is meant to be a second chance perk. This change forces people to use it as such instead of a continuation of their first chance. Plus, killers who play well and don't tunnel are rewarded by literally never having to see DS again. This is a really nice change.
---
He can’t cash in on karma if it gets downvoted.
---
So? Bitter Murmur rewards you for letting survivors do generators.
---
Dead by Darkness?
---
"Touch the well" means hauling ass across the map, breaking chases, just to get ranged damage for a minute. Hope you can find someone by then!
---
I’ve seen you on r/deepfried memes
---
I mean, 🅱️
---
What do you mean? That’s exactly how balance works. If you want to avoid it, you can. You just choose not to.
---
The only thing that I think NOED could use in its current state is adding a dull totem counter to everyone’s UI. It’s crazy they have to do this just to get survivors to cleanse dull totems though. It’s literally the same thing with out without a totem counter.
---
The balance shifted months and months ago to killer sided, but the devs keep on nerfing survivors and buffing killers unnecessarily. Survivors used to be more powerful yes, but it has been a long long time since that was true and any honest person would admit that.
---
I mentioned your assumption that I'm a "salty survivor main" in your language. Everyone here assumes I must never play killer because I want the game to be fair for survivors and not just a killer steamroll every match! Just silly.
---
Low key lol 
---
I do not recommend playing this game on console because its treated like a cash grab joke to BHVR. Thats probably why they made it free on PS+.
---
Play a better, more polished game thats actually worth your time.
---
F
---
Don'r get me wrong, I feel you. That was not to patronize you, but to be a blanket statement to all solo survivors. Usually I am the person to break the totems; but I will say that I don't have any issues with NOED because killers won't get the chance if I'm a survivor in their game. 
---
Pretty sure the totem spawn points will be the same. It has just made it that the totem wont spawn within visible sight of starting survivors. Not sure though if there is now a minimal distance set based on spawn of survivors.
---
Okay, I definitely believe you and you are not yourself at all salty about losing this argument. Have a wonderful day.
---
it's optized with Q&amp;Q and dance with me now. 
---
You lost the killer for 1sec, or you wait that he juke himself in a jungle gym, and you quick vault to an other universe without any mark.
---
Ashley J Williams is indeed his name and it’s almost definitely really him I was just joking 
---
Holy shit 
---
Do the hero
---
Jesus christ, more like Jiggle by Daylight
---
I was always saying that they could do that for Ash and maybe give him an ability to uppercut the killer or something lol 
---
These changes aren't unnecessary, but continue thinking that, I guess. Some survivor perks even got buffed this patch.
---
I dont think they would release just a suvivior dlc, espcally since it would make the killer and survivor count uneven. No body gets as exicted for a new survivor as a killer. 
---
His full name in the movie is Ashley James Williams
---
Just curious, how much have you played of the new killer?

You misunderstand or are avoiding the point, Enduring wasn't actually a counter for Decisive Strike until today's change. Now it is. Nobody has any reason to whine about it anymore because they can run Enduring and negate it, like DS apologists have pretended it could all along.

or if someone gets facecamped, you literally dont get enough points if the killer does nothing
---
all right, let's wait for the fix then

Thought you left?

I'm not salty about a reddit thread, and I didn't "lose". You're a stranger on a reddit thread, honey, you're not that important. 
---
Sort of on topic, I think the ping indicator maxes out at 1,100. I saw that in my lobby the other night, laughed, and decided fuck it, let's play.   
---
Horrible rubberbanding and a generally bad time is had by everyone.   
---
Get to the end game chat and the killer is in Spain.  
---
I'm in US.  
---
NICE 
---
I'd say it's somewhat similar. The Plague doesn't have to reload her Purge she could just keep chasing you. She also can damage you with it to potentially only needing to take one hit. She still has to melee attack you down but she's got 115% movement so it's manageable. 
---
Then there's the corrupt Purge which is essentially a ranged AoE damage ability.  
---
weaponized nintendo power glove
---
I agree with the ping problem, hitboxes, and lobby dodging. But usually if a killer is being retarded and not moving from the hatch at all then I suck it up and do generators.
---
I just wonder if they actually used Sumerian language 
---
They did it with Bill.
---
They absolutely are. I already addressed the so called survivor "buffs" in this patch, short answer is there aren't any and if you think those are meaningful buffs that will help survivors I simply will no longer believe that you "play both sides" as you claim.
---
But regardless I'm not going to keep discussing this with you as you are clearly arguing in bad faith as I said in the other thread. Have a nice evening.
---
* **Flip-Flop** - Along with being one of those perks with a fun name akin to "Bamboozle" this perk is insanely good. Obvious synergies with Unbreakable and pretty good synergy with Decisive Strike (If the Killer wants to slug you to avoid DS) and Tennacity. Insane combo potential with SWF. I don't know if you run this over Unbreakable though.
---
* **Mettle of Man** - You have to escape the chase twice to get this to work. Once if you have an instaheal Medkit. This perk is also le cancerino against Le Cancerino Legionrino, but Legion would be able to see your Aura so IDK. It's a really interesting perk and I'd have to see it in action to see if it's viable.
---
* **Buckle Up** - Overly-conditional trash. Literally everyone has to be running anti-slug builds for this perk to be useful in any way. The range limit adds insult to injury.
---
As awesome as Ash would be as a Survivor I don't know if any of his perks are really worth running. He has one good one (FF), one bad one (BU), and one ??? one (MoM.)  
---
Can't say I'm not excited though.
---
This is super super confirmed in my mind and im very excited! I was looking on Artstation a few months ago for DBD stuffs and found Damion Devuax whos their Lead Character Artist and found this [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL) . So Deadite new killer then???? SO HYPED!!!!!
---
Source?
---
Just play a killer with BBQ every other match to help level up until you get it. That’s what I’m doing.
---
Lmao I love your posts.
---
As soon as survivors break chase, they'll go to the nearest well (which you see when they're finished), you can definitely find someone in under a minute if you have eyes, you can keep using it for the entire minute which means you can just constantly spam it, and you don't even have to break the chase, you can just lead the survivor towards an area with a well since by 2 gens left most have been used.
---
Well yeah, but in this conversation we've covered that NOED is useless at high ranks and too strong at low ranks. It needs to be reworked.
---
yea Bill is always so useless. It's the dude who do nothing whole game and at the end think he will save the day by unhooking you in front of the killer.
---
i'M HelPInG !!
---
Poor Spirit must've gotten a hell of a jumpscare :c
---
So the Lithe buff is nothing? K, then. Sounds like you're stuck in your ways and nothing I say will change your mind. And I do play both, regardless of what you believe. 
---
"Bad faith" lol wtf is that, even.
---
I can see maybe a little bit of a difference but honestly it almost looks the same to me :p
---
Dang Claud is looking noice 
---
Are these in any particular order in the ingame files? I want the Ace ASAP
---
I’ve been vomiting on every gen when they have 3 left(5 on map) and it’s just about forcing them to get sick from gens. Working pretty well tbh. Makes games take longer but usually get a 4k. Also don’t go super far from gens to get corruption. Just leave it if it’s on the other side of the map.
---
Smart survivors will wait to cure themselves, effectively holding her power in limbo.
---
Good to see there's another real person who plays freddy besides me! I'm not alone anymore! He literally gets so much hate, and people say he's the worst killer, but I consistently get 4Ks with him.
---
You think it would go that far?
---
We're allowing you to discuss it, you just have to put spoiler tags on it.
---
Saw a little more than I expected 😉
---
I would. I'm more a killer main and i dont care as much about suvivors
---
I feel like head on was a joke they were having in the design team that actually got sent out for launch.
---
A 3 second stun at a locker and then exhaustion? 
---
Why would any survivor choose Head on as an exhaustion perk. Your screwed if the killer manages to just dodge your attack as seen in this video and if the killer has enduring then you have just wasted time inside a locker.
---
Even then why would a survivor ever be in a locker in the first place. The only time I can think of is when doing a basement save buts its a very risky move. Both for missing the head on or doing it to late and having the killer pull you out the locker.
---
Is this the new S-Tier?
---
Yes they no longer spawn in the same exact area on over half the maps so people actually have to search for them as opposed to immediately sprinting to the totem and cleansing it within 30 seconds.
---
They don't in-game ban you for stuff in Doscord, right?
---
Rofl
---
For me he is so fun! Underpowered killer, but fun to play
---
I have almost all the survivors levelled up to 50 and I prestige’s a couple but the prestiging thing ended up being a big waste cuz it lost me all my items and I had to start fresh with low level perks again.  So I haven’t had any incentive to prestige my characters.  Once I top off to level 3 the perks that I want on a survivor I don’t see the point of prestiging.
---
I’m an adult so I’m not too worried about the cosmetics aspect.  
---
I’m just over here tryna not connect to Legion matches, really.
---
Could you explain, since you seem quite knowledgeable about this stuff— why is it better to be a higher *rank*?
---
I mean doesn’t that mean you’re likely to pair up with  killers who are really good at either killing fair or really good at killing cheaply? (I.e. camping or tunneling)
---
Turning on each other what do you mean what happened
---
The Army of Darkness Timeline
---
Survivors will already be Broken by the time the chase is up, and its hard to lose a chase when they're constantly puking
---
None because 1. Killer is boring for me at this point, 2. I haven't bought the dlc since all the perks to me are bad and I'll never use them and 3. The pack hasn't been out for more than 48 hours

Honest question because I haven't played on PS4, does the pre-game chat not have keyboard support? Man that would suck, I get so much coordinating done with my teammates on PC and that's just in the solo queue.
---
I was a killer the other day and a dude DCd right when I picked them up.
---
But their body was still on my shoulder. I dropped them and they were in the downed state. 
---
So I picked them up and carried them to a hook....just to see what would happen. 
---
Still got a BBQ stack. They remained on the hook and it counted down the timer.
---
Another survivor pulled them off the hook even. Now their model was just standing there. So I hooked him again...and he got sacrificed in the struggle phase as you would expect.
---
Except, every time I walked by, I could still hear their struggling sounds like they were still there. 
---
Only mildly related I guess...

I’m sure it was an answer on the Dev Q&amp;A on the DBD forums, I’ll try and find it for you.

The cylinders that pump in and out on the top of the generators. The top are literally pixels.

I'm amused that people think this is not intentional. This is a free buzz/PR for the game and people will talk about this for the next 3 months.
---
No one's getting fired. 
---
Most likely legit. A few people had the perk in their kyf games.

I got held hostage by a Wraith on Xbox last night. He held me against a wall and a gen and wouldn’t let me leave until I said please and gave up my Medkit.

The matchmaking has been rough for a while but as of today, it’s been great for both sides. Have not tried playing in friend groups yet but queue times seem to have improved. It’s only been a day though and there was a new DLC today so that could be part of it. 
---
I think it’s worth a try. 
---
Are there better games? Yes.
---
Is it on sale in the PS store? Yes.
---
$15 is a fair investment I think even if you get a few weeks out of it but it hooked me in from the start and I’ve played almost daily since last summer.

Question from Nirvana115  
---
Any plans on removing the Insta-heal off the Plauges power? I feel it's the right buff she needs to help make her a little bit stronger. 
---
Horvath - game designer | Answer
---
We are thinking of changing the insta-heals in our game into heals over time instead. This means that instead of instantly being healed a health state, you will initiate the heal and it will take several seconds before you are fully healed. Imagine the opposite of Deep wounds, if you are hit before the heal over time finishes, you will be considered injured, and knocked down into the dying state. 
---
Wait. Am I stupid or is this actually real? Isn't that a huge fuck up since it's licensed?

---
Did they seriously make Hex Ruin affect everyone on all tiers now? What the fuck. Every time they change stuff, it's at the benefit of the killer, it's ridiculous. 
---
Dwights spend too long in their locker to eat properly.
---
I always disliked huntress' lore for that exact reason.
---
 She should know that tieing up children to a post with no food was not a good idea, she grew up in that cold hell, after all.
---
 She would definitely know some stuff like the cold not being good and the neck (which is where she tied the ropes to them) are sensitive.
---
Flip Flop sounds op tbh. Might encourage a lot more slugging
---
Not at all a good argument, but I think it's fair to give a stupid response to a stupid comment. 
---
I'm personally excited that they're implementing perks that sound like they're from fan-made concepts. 
---
Yeah, he has a lot of weaknesses but in the right hands He makes a good killer. I personally run Lullaby, Haunted, blood warden, and Bitter murmer. It gets me 3-4 Ks at the rank I'm at. Haven't played in a bit tho, so my rank probably went down by now. Last I recall I was at I think rank 10 killer, and rank 8 survivor. 
---
Yes, because we had a killer only DLC and Bill techally isnt a DLC as he was free. 
---
My sweet child, is that a watermark? 
---
Exhaustion prevents something like Head On going right into Sprint Burst, which would be too much.
---
I've been saying for years evil dead would be great for this game. maini my boy Ash. And please give us a deadite killer
---
Bill is still DLC. DLC = Downloadable Content.
---
You know thats the one thing I can respect about Legion. He is the best killer for bullying toxic SWF squads back for trying to dominate a game.
---
Legion + Franks Mixtape will bully any survivor into leaving the game and giving you hate. I agree that its amazing for providing solace by bullying an SWF back.
---
Yep, tall loops are on nearly every map and are her bane. She has no choice but to run those like every other killer cause if she tries to vomit you at those it will take forever. Her power can get downs very quickly though if they’re in the open like huntress but it’s nearly imposible for survivors to dodge if there isn’t any cover.
---
I tHiNk wE DiD a pREEty gOoD jOB 
---
That's because pig's ability is to stall the game. Other killers aren't as fortunate. Plus, people at rank six are really rank 12s Imo. Hell, most rank ones are really rank 8s but play too much lmao
---
There is no leak in Ba Sing Se
---
You should have made that arc into plagues vomit.
---
What the fuck are they gonna do about his chainsaw hand that’s what I wanna know
---
I know I could have do more gen but I was mostly being chased or unhooking other survivor. And while doing so, gens were being done by the other ones.
---
The difference is the baby bird is cute but Dwight is fugly.
---
The vomit will do a favour to his face. 
---
I’ll complain. 🤷‍♀️ 
---
I had a survivor game of 25k BP with no WGLF or offerings and only safety pipped. 
---
I agree that the rank system needed something but I don’t like this and I don’t even care about rank usually. I think it’s more disappointing to have what I consider good games just for the game to tell me they weren’t. 
---
My guess is it's going to be a deadite Linda. They cant not add a killer for this. The series is too iconic
---
Theres literally no pre game chat. Console fucking sucks and I should just get a PC but Im a naughty dog fanboy so Im just sticking with console for TLOU2. Probably will build a PC soon and leave console gaming behind forever.
---
seems unlikely to me seeing how it was only on consoles and on the day of release.  Not to mention, they immediately got to deleting posts about it until the mods were sorted out and reminded of the subreddit rules
---
Still doesn't mean they can do gens by themselves. Doesn't matter if I can hit the checks if my team cant. I can't do all the gens for 4 people. And when did I say ruin was op? Never? Ok, cool. Glad we got that out of the way.
---
Someone has to feed him
---
Maybe...if they do a survivor only it would be consle excluive to balance out the fact that bill is pc only. Thats the only way ill believe it. 
---
Also, you dont even need to download bill. Its more like a free update. 
---
You gotta mark your post as spoiler dude
---
But yeah, lol, nice meme.
---
I'm sorry I'm not downvoting you I really do like the discussion especially since the change just happened. 
---
I know, right? It's such a lovely game.
---
So you're mad the game is cheaper? lol
---
yikes
---
I can! One is a creature that hides in someplace safe until it is safe to leave, and the other is a bird. 
---
I  run franklins on trapper 
---
I agree I’ve got legions Iron Maiden on most of my killers and everything time I see the new survivor I just pop it on and wait to see one of them step out from the locker and get smacked
---
I mean, it is a discussion, but I cannot help there are delusional people with no taste at all. lol
---
Are there any pics of the other perks?
---
It's not me being entitled, its them being lazy, that's just the facts.
---
To be honest I don’t know how, I tried lol
---
You are scared because of 1.30 Euros?
---
Agreed, its pretty incredible how that one item makes such a difference.
---
No, I'm just scared that it is a mistake and it actually costs 6.99 and I pay more without knowing
---
Dude, you're making no sense. Why would Ash be console exclusive? And like it or not, it still requires a DOWNLOAD. Hence, DOWNLOADABLE content. It literally says in the "Left Behind" banner "DLC"
---
21gb on for me on Steam.
---
In short you've missed salt on top of salt with just a dash of salt. 
---
Tons of changes since Pig release honestly don't remember how the game played back then. Checking patch notes would probably be the easiest and most concise way to discover the changes/balance. As far as Legion goes, its a toss up. OP with specific addons but like most killers easily beaten by competent survivors/swf group. Trapper and Hag both have shorter trap set times. Wraith had a slight rework(didn't help much). Every killer now lunges at 115% movement speed regardless of their normal movement speed this was a big change (also kind of funny looking seeing a 110% movement killer get a *speed boost* but has helped killers like huntress/hag/clown etc.) Bloodlust was reworked,  its gained faster but the new tier 3 = the old tier 2. Nurse and Billy are still at the top followed by spirit and huntress, I'll stop with those four as I don't want to start this tired debate. SERVERS!! Are supposedly coming in late summer of this year, do what you will with this knowledge. And as before with every patch/update new and *fun* bugs are created.
---
P.S. Exhaustion perks were reworked you can no longer run and recover exhaustion. Decisive strike was reworked, self healing is a lot slower now, and Diversion is by far the best perk that was and ever will be created.
---
you calling people on the internet “ bums “ 😂 oh man you must be real bored right now 
---
no that doesnt help it cancels out franklins there still those other perks... oh thana
---
But at the same time having Head on as an exhaustion perk removes any types of synergy with the perk and makes its value drop significantly. 
---
I can see were your point is but I cannot see Head on ever being a perk that's worth using. I suppose i'm just disappointed that the perk is little use.
---
Adept Jane doesn't work. Escaped two times, no dice.
---
Also to give correct information, plagues corrupted vomit also doesn’t instant down while exposed effect is inflicted on survivors.
---
None of the killers 2nd attacks instant down with exposed, excluding the ones with a chainsaw and iri huntress
---
None of those "counters" are actually real counters, though, except I guess lockers but that is a very recent change? Hiding behind a generator is not at all a guarantee and you can usually be seen even if you do it, and getting within the minimum range to where they can't see your aura 99% of the time just means the killer will camp your teammate.
---
It is still OP, it still ruins stealth, but more importantly my argument is principally that it is *unfair* and *un-fun* for survivors to play against so it should be changed to make it more fun. After all, that is why DS was destroyed by the devs, right? Because killers complained that it was unfair and un-fun?
---
Well, then I'd recommend messaging the mods about it so nothing "bad" happens.
---
No, only that is a mistake and I pay 6.99 without knowing
---
Killer perks have more utility to them because they're outnumbered by 4x the amount from their opponent's. Enduring is clearly a stronger perk than Small Game or Detective's Hunch, like it should be, and I don't see a problem with that. 
---
Survivors should try giving up some of the extra flexibility that BHVR has given them and use it as insurance against their opponent's build. Use the pre-game chat to coordinate roles and loadouts as best you can. Dodge the lobby if you're not confident in what they're saying. And even then, no, you can't always be prepared for every single loadout and playstyle your opponent throws at you, sometimes you or your teammates(or the killer) guesses wrong and they pay for it. It can be frustrating when it happens, sure, but it's supposed to happen. 
---
It synergies well with DWM and Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
I’ll just delete the post then
---
&gt;the best players
---
&gt;true talent
---
haha yeah totally 3Head.
---
Lol, if that's the case than well played BHVR well played.
---
I could not disagree more, the perk is nearly useless now especially for solo queue. It's just useless now while killers still have tons of OP and unfair perks that are only being buffed with every single patch which is patently unfair. Enjoy the game while you still can though I guess... the continued direction of these balance changes will kill it.

You'd have to most likely transfer the files from the xbox onto PC then use some sort of program to read it.

That was my immediate guess, but unless they got consent, they’d be in some potential hot water.  Also, if they did get consent, might as well use it.

Sounds like they're a bunch of pussies lmao. I hate this culture of "chopping people in half is neat-o, by all means gun down my friends, but heckin help me if you use a naughty word or show skin!

Using an IP they don't own for an April Fool's joke wouldn't really sit well with the copyright holders.

Ah ok then. It was good while it lasted though. Love Terraria.
---
Yea its way harder to rank up now. I was chased for 4 gens and  did half a gen by myself  and guess what. I depiped.  Like how i was supposed to to other objectives if killer chased me for the whole match?
---
Poor bunny😢

You contradict yourself in the post

Might as well stay safe, right? Lol

Considering it's illegal w/o permission, nah
---
Yea I guessed, you've been pretty civil and I appreciate that but the post is sitting at 0 points and it seems like people are just ignoring the change. 
---
WGLF just broke for me too
---
Going through his posts and comments they're always butthurt. Unless pointing out that next years DLCs will all be licensed counts as a moment of exception.
---
lol yep, I wish you luck in your future memes!
---
Having a crouching pig attack you and unknowingly grabbing a survivor from a locker as huntress are the two scariest parts of the game for me haha
---
They most likely didn't know the last gen was going to pop, and had the trapper picked them up, it was likely that he'd step in his own trap. It was just unfortunate that they happened to have adrenaline pop before the pickup.
---
No one was around to save me
---
Which is still bad design. However bitter murmur is bad, while this perk might not be
---
Holy shit, that's a pretty big handicap compared to PC players. Pre-game chat is literally the only thing that's stopping me from playing SWF exclusively, what a dumb oversight. 
---
Ha, take your upvote good sir.
---
I’m a PlayStation boi 
---
Visually I find Hag to be the most disturbing. She's the furthest removed from humanoid and the way she shambles around freaks me out. M&amp;A Hags get me way more often than a Mike or Pig jump scare.
---
In terms of back story I actually find Hillbilly to be the worst. Being imprisoned by his own parents, in solitary confinement, then slaughtering a bunch of animals when he finally gets out. 
---
If it was an April Fools joke it would have been something ridiculous, Ash Williams as a survivor makes perfect sense and the perks are perfectly balanced
---
I haven't seen the POV of the killer yet so IDK if killer will have to switch gamestyle in order to pip. Like if you focus only one survivor you derank?
---
No they are counters, they counter the aura reading. It's as simple as that. Using those stealth counters stops the aura reading, so it doesn't ruin stealth. It's not unfair because it has perfectly fair counters. Unfun is just pretty subjective, if you find it Unfun that's your call, but it's not universally Unfun, infact the aura reveal makes killer hook camping less likely so imo it makes matches more likely to be more fun. I'm not interested in talking about DS, I'm just pointing out how flawed it is of you to say BBQ ruins stealth and is unfair, when in actuality stealth methods counter it and having multiple counters makes it fair.
---
I remember being a new survivor, going against ruin hitting no great skill checks I could still do gens.
---
At the end of the day you don’t need to prestige people, it’s more of a self accomplishment thing than it really mattering tbh. If you’re fine with a lvl 50 and just adding to that, perfectly fine, If you want the challenge of re doing it for “better” stuff and a bloody cosmetic, perfectly fine also.    
---
    
---
You’re definitely more likely to be against capable killers (and of course that means you’ll have a few idiots only trying to get meta kills), but that gets balanced out by your team also. It’s more of a challenge in an intelligent way as opposed to being a challenge purely on luck. You might get camped once or twice but if you’ve been doing your thing the whole time and so has your team like higher ranks do, it won’t really affect you as much, it affects the killer more. And to be honest there’s far more challenge in higher ranks actually mind gaming and having battles of wits. I couldn’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve played a low rank killer/survivor and I’ve been “juked” by them running out in the middle of the open or making a tech speaking random and bad play, but that’s how low levels survive is on less knowledge of what to do. The higher up you go the more rewarding the escapes/kills feel, the matches are, and the game is as a whole.
---
Man, they finally buffed Fire Up. Still too late for ol ' Freddy.
---
From now on 
---
Thank 👏 you 
---
The map and true being a mediocre huntress player was more of a factor than SWF in that match.
---
Decisive Strike is a non-perk against Enduring. It is supposed to disincentivize/punish tunnelling/farming off hook, yet the killer can simply use Enduring to all but nullify the perk. Either Enduring has to be adjusted down to 50%, which is more reasonable also with regards to Spirit Fury, or non-pallet stuns have to be made exempt from Enduring, like they used to be.
---
Probably Mathieu's face right now
---
If today was April 1, I'd probably believe you. 
---
This is real?! I THOUGHT IT WAS A TROLL!
---
If the counters don't work... which stuff like "hide behind a generator" does not... then they aren't counters and shouldn't be counted as such. It is not fair and it is OP. And killers use it and camp anyway all the time so it literally doesn't even accomplish what the devs wanted it to do... so it should be changed.
---
oof that's sad
---
It’s harder to rank up now so it’s a good start. It’ll be changed but it’s better now than how it was

It's called interp, it's not a difficult concept
---
that has happened to me so many times. my friend said on her screen, i was still out of the killer shack but i was like “nuuu i was in the shack”
---
Its not even a jump scare for the survivor they see that coming but for killer they should be able to me throw the mouse across the room and hear me scream.
---
I'd be okay with Decisive alone being exempt from Enduring.
---
Secretly the killer IS Slashy Ashy. 
---
They changed all the variable survivor perks too and made lithe work outside of chases. The confirmation bias on this sub is pathetic.
---
Ikr
---
Laurie would like to also interject in that conversation
---
so when does the evil dead chapter release?
---
I appreciate you taking the time to tell me all of this.  However I’m not convinced that frequently disconnecting due to Legion matches or bad luck at the start has any impact on the way I’m enjoying the game. 
---
It would be cool if they came back to it in the future. Coach skin for tapp and Louis skin for Adam. 
---
Spitter skin for Adiris, Charger for Billy, witch skin for hag. idk
---
Hate it.
---
It's not useless. It's a powerful perk that isn't without its downsides. It fits in with other powerful but situational perks like Unbreakable and Deliverance. 
---
Where were you 20 minutes ago when I got the idea
---
Of course you can still do them... Nobody is saying you can't... It just takes insanely longer if you can't hit them. Even if you can hit skill checks, you aren't gonna hit them all and it can take an extra thirty seconds. Either way, this is irrelevant. I'm merely saying there need to be new ways to prolong games, but you just sidetracked with a bunch of shit to boost your ego lol
---
Yep, it's still active when the user is on the ground.
---
Can't wait to have to wait who knows how long to get them because the achievements are broken again.
---
why the fuck does bhvr wait so long to release them then??
---
Triplets with self esteem issues, a rare sight
---
All perks are crutches. That's the point.
---
i reduced the numbers on jiggle physics from Jane to make it more subtle.. but in extreme movements it will be noticeable :(
---
Sorry your crutches broke.
---
Hail to the king baby.
---
60 seconds isn't that long. You'd basically have to throw yourself at the killer to use it in time if they're smart. And survivors are already powerful at the end game. You could still use old DS at end game, this changes nothing. 
---
Outside of console looking like 360p I think the new patch is fine. 
---
You sound like you have no idea how "asymmetrical 4v1" works.
---
Hiding behind a gen works fine if you are decent at lining it up. But even discounting that, hiding in gens and going within the minimum distance are still 2 perfectly fine counters that make BBQ not OP, and keep it fair.
---
Useless, especially if the Killer has a Mori. Which is the main point of my first comment. "Situational" perks, are arguably the worst imo, any perk that can't be used consistently throughout the game :). 
---
doesn't look like it'll be something that goes meta
---
Hey OP, did it let you use the perk? Or was it just listed 
---
I don't like how big it is or how unsafe it is for Survivors; besides a few tiles almost every jungle gym and pallet is either unsafe or mindgameable or both AND they're all a fair distance from each other too.
---
I feel like it'll be pretty annoying for both sides; since Killers will struggle to maintain pressure on generators due to the size and Survivors will struggle to avoid going down once they get caught thanks to the map's design.
---
Of course that's a Killer Main's opinion based on, like, a weeks experience, so take it with a truckload of salt.
---
It's a privilege to be gouged so thoroughly. 
---
I don’t get why they made a THICC survivor. Not complaining. Just wondering. 
---
Bad idea. You'll be banned within a weak. The mods there are a special kind of sensitive.
---
D is for dhag /s
---
Then by that logic nothing in the game is OP because there is a way to sometimes occasionally maybe perhaps "counter" it.. including DS before the nerf... so we shouldn't nerf or buff anything. Revert all the changes from the last several months of survivor nerfs and killer buffs, because nothing is OP and nothing needs to be changed or fixed ever if there is even one way to (sometimes) (kind of) (maybe) (possibly) counter it.
---
Was there really a graphical downgrade?
---
Its the new matchmaking, now scared killers cant tell anymore if its swf or not just by the joining pattern.
---
A licensed character wouldn't be part of an April Fool's joke.
---
If they got the license to use him, a joke would be a total waste.
---
If they didn't get the license to use him, they'd be in trouble.

---
PS4 player here and can confirm it’s true, was actually using some of the perks earlier
---
this tier list is kinda wack
---
Your previous comment literally says they can’t do them by themselves and how is this boosting my ego. I can hit almost every ruin skill check. At most I am delayed by 10 seconds.
---
Yeah,  everyone has been super hyped about that perk. 
---
What do you mean? 
---
Not for me. Playing on the One X.
---
Suck my dick 
---
we got bill on pc and we also got Leatherface as a stand-alone killer
---
Let's see a video of your gameplay. True talent is one of the best dbd players. Tell me who is better who still plays? Marth was better but quit because the game was so survivor sided. 
---
I don't find lobby dodging an issue but I do it myself with toolboxes.  I have a 1 toolbox maximum in my lobbies. The games go fast enough, last thing I want is more than one toolbox running around.
---
I think I spotted the killer main
---
So we're actually get Ash Williams?
---
Can't play yet, can anyone tell me:
---
&gt; Slightly reduced The Plague movement Speed while fully charged and holding Vile Purge and Corrupt Purge. 
---
How much her movement speed is reduced while holding her vomit? I'm not really surprised they did this, it seemed pretty damn strong in the PTB to be running around with it charged pretty much all the time
---
Well I make it short hopefully your a killer main or have a 4 player pre lobby survs xD
---
My boy Quentin makes a cameo in the background! Sweet!
---
Didn’t dm they say there should be dedicated servers come summer?
---
Wow, you are extremely literal. I always forget never to exaggerate on Reddit. How is saying "get good scrub" and then saying that you can do it not some ego boosting shit lmao
---
😒 no need to be an ass. We don't have steam on console so won't have a way to check for swf groups. All I meant. 
---
But if the killer runs enduring then he’s picking you up and downing you instantly after you hit the skillcheck. 2 perks made useless!
---
Really it just comes down to the perks. Which perks of those dlc sound the most appealing to you?
---
Quick question: pallet stun always depleted Spirit`s power bar? I have`nt noticed it before. Now when I`m getting hit by pallet my ability cooldown resets 
---
freddy gang
---
putting all people to sleep to apply constant pressue, using range addons and not using block addons. This is how freddy should be played
---

There's 2 completely reasonable ways to always counter BBQs aura read . You're just being intentionally obtuse so that you can keep saying 'its OP and counters stealth' despite stealth plays literally countering it and thus making it not OP
---
In b4 comment
---
Shattered bloodline, I got darkness among us and I actually preferred shattered bloodline. The legion isn’t that good, and any game that you’d play as him people would dc. So if you get darkness among us and like to play as the killer. Good Luck.
---
with no mither, you'd have to hope to get slugged. no one slugs no mither characters, so youll get hit three times, downed three time, and hooked three times and die before your perk even activates
---
Oh Really because every game I have played today is against a swf group where there all playing way above there rank ten. Its so frustrating
---
It happens on left behind too 
---
Borrowed time unusable? Nerfs weren’t needed? The mad man has spoken revert ds now! 
---
Tryna work out how to set up drobox xD all set up now, feel free to look them up :)
---
I’m just saying if I can play normally through ruin then it shouldn’t be so hard for other people because I’m not even that good at survivor, not trying to boost my ego. 
---
Yes the 4 people on coms, 2 Insta heals, and decisive strike had nothing to do with it. True is just bad. Lol excuses excuses. Just because you are bad at survivor doesn't mean the game isn't survivor sided. A good swf wins everytime against everybody. Have you ever watched a tournament? Some of the best players out there and more often than not the killer is lucky to get a 2k.

I play both. Good joke anyway.
---
But you guys could see each other's auras all the time, correct?
---
Yeah, that’s definitely an issue, but actually, I haven’t really seen it today, yesterday I played against a few rank 18s at rank8-9. Overall though, I feel like this patch was VERY killer skewed 
---
The person above mentioned the game looking like it’s in 360p but to quote another forum:
---
Too bad they killed the PS4 version with the newest patch today. They downgraded it so hard that even Watch Dogs would be proud. The resolution is now way under 1080P and it’s just a blurry mess now. Even on my PS4 Pro. It looks ridiculous. I was so excited for the newest chapter but after playing a few rounds, I had to stop, I was legit in a very bad mood.
---
Any info?
---
All good :)
---
These are nice perks tbh
---
Licensed killers are great if they're released with a huge window of time in between. Having 3 licensed killers released back to back (Leatherface, Freddy, Pig in Sept. 2017-Jan. 2018) made me want original killers even more.
---
DS literally became an anti tunnelling perk 
---
whats the point of chasing if you cant apply pressue? freddy can take care of all survivors at the same time and switch targets quite easily, giving him one of the best stall and pressue abilities. Clown and doctor are overrated since their powers can be countered easily and trapper, well he isn't overrated but his power is still piss easy to counter
---
Shattered bloodline if you play killer, the Spirit is so fun to play and her perks are all good. If you play absolutely no killer then darkness among us is probably better because Jeff’s perks, while still bad, are better than Adams.
---
R.I.P
---
Ohh, I was gonna say that I didn’t mention it in my post, very confused for a minute. 
---
Umm to me there doesn’t seem to be that big of a difference (I’m Xbox 1S) but that might be bc the graphics always suck 
---
Yes quite happy actually. In fact, and you will love this, decisive strike needs another nerf in my opinion. 
---
lmao imagine thinking that freddy's power is about free hits. Please don't touch freddy anymore if you legit think that his power is just that
---
Well this is the thing they’re, if YOU were legion and joined matches failed and dc’d, it’s only affecting you. If you play a team based game, and bail on the team because of personal reservations, sure it might not “affect you”, but in a roundabout way it does by affecting the type of people in those ranks and what killers do to secure kills before people disconnect. It’s a ripple effect. I had 15 people dc on me within hours of launch with Plague because YouTubers “said” she was op. Trashed tons of people’s chances at a fair game (which hurts even more for me to see as a pretty happy go lucky nice killer) because then I can’t even get a “fair” being nice match where I’m already letting 4 people go, but now it just takes longer and wastes everyone’s time the fact they joined in the first place because of 1 or 2 disconnects. Picking and choosing what you get to deal with isn’t really reality, so no offence by this one, but that’s usually why the younger crowd is more susceptible to that. Most of the adults I’ve played or met like myself, just cut their losses (unless it’s an extreme case which is rare and I wouldn’t call not liking a character on that basis alone even remotely a good reason.) 
---
"Difficult"
---
I am liiiiiiiiiiving for Lisa’s lewk. I wish I was a better Hag player cause some of her cosmetics are just so gorgeous 
---
finally
---
Thanks man, sounds interesting! But they should probably wait a little with that, since she just got rather significant buffs 
---
Perk looks sick tho.
---
Buckle up I assume can be used multiple times. Especially can be strong in a swf who can bodly bocón for you since it will take way less time for you to wiggle out.
---
Sorry for the poopy framerate, I'm a console pleb
---
what the fuck whyyyyyyyyyy
---
fucking legion has to ruin everything
---
They’re decent IMO, they work best at anti-slugging but not many killers slug. 
---
Wait what? Current DS is totally fine, it’s as simple as not tunneling or just leave them on the floor for 60 seconds. 
---
Textures are less smooth but the framerates are drastically improved. I just wish they would have put that in the patch notes.
---
And if you start to win they dc??? My brother!!! Seriously the disconnects and hate messages are off the charts today. 
---
Leak? Who got leaked?
---
Yea you’re a goof. I’m not gonna entertain it anymore 
---
Brainlet.
---
Yes. DS was absolutely too strong and turned a 2 gen chase into 3, 4, or even 5, given the Survivor was good enough.
---
He still needs a map too :(
---
Oh boy 
---
You’re still new to the game. Once you become a seasoned survivor you won’t need any perks to do well. Shit, I can loop most killers for 2-3 gens with no perks. At least now killers won’t get completely owned by good survivors. This game doesn’t need to be balanced around low skilled players because then killers would be completely useless against skilled players. Also, what’s wrong with burrowed time? Borrowed time is a god send when your teammates are being camped. The main problem with this game is the ranking system, not OP killers. The main reason I die isn’t because its unfair, it’s because of stupid teammates that fail skill checks, hide in lockers, waste pallets, etc. 90% of my deaths are due to my, and my fellow survivors’, mistakes, not due to the killer being too strong. 
---
He could save others from death, but not himself.
---
This would almost be a great perk to use with No Mither, except you'd be dead.
---
It's completely irrelevant when the best way to play her is to charge for like 1 second and hit them, the "nerf" was more of a fix to something unintentional than a nerf imo 
---
Oh my god you’ve made me crave an opulent sci-fi skin for her now
---
That’s disappointing. Well a guy can dream
---
As a killer main I won’t be happy until they nerf NOED either. Both were garbage crutches and both need a nerf.
---
She hasn't even been out for 6 hours. Let people figure out strategies first before you start complaining.
---
Eventually you’ll have to commit to one, because you’re going to have to down them to gain momentum. He can’t “take care of all survivors at the same time” because they’ll run away and wake up. Yeah this will take time and you may be able to keep some of the survivors on their toes but you can’t down them fast enough. He just can’t capitalize on the slow game
---
Okay in their defense the meme was a kinda offensive and I got banned by the most easily triggered mod on the server.
---
But on the flipside it was a photoshop of a cat. When I got banned I posted that meme on a bunch of other Discords and told them that I got banned from another server for it. Everyone on every single one of those servers were beyond confused as to why. I maybe got about 10 total people saying that "yeah it's kinda edgy so I can see how you'd be offended by it but at worst I'd give out a warning. I wouldn't ban you for it."
---
Hey, the tweet isn't showing up for me, what does it say?
---
Exit gate is open, 1 person hooked 1 person free. Do you A- camp the hook, losing points for being near it and harvesting tons of salt. Or do you B leave knowing if they get unhooked there is literally nothing you can do but hope they miss ds. You don't even need to body block anymore. Ahhh it's better than it was for sure but I think it needs a bit more tweaking. 
---
THOSE PERKS LOOK AMAZING! I wonder if the Killer perks are great too
---
You can live without your get out of jail free.
---
&gt;!Ash Williams from the Evil Dead series. No Killer is known yet!&lt;
---
Well he has no proof that the upcoming DLCs will all be licensed. He's just trying to make them look worse than they are. Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to criticize BHVR for. But there's a difference between criticism and pettiness. Hopefully he learns that one day.
---
Shop smart, shop s-smart
---
Virigin Huntress V.S. Chad Chainsaw
---
Maybe not this game but definitely for honor lul
---
Sounds like a cello, but I'm not 100 % sure
---
If that's how you feel, that's how you feel. But all of those perks are powerful abilities that deserve to be situational and easily countered. DS fits right into that group. 
---
People are just sad that DS isn't how it used to be. 
---
some of us actually want to play with useable fps, not everyone has a le ebic ps4 pro
---
Well who's the main bad guy in the show?
---
#fucklegion (Not literally)
---
Who the fuck is that man in the 2nd pic
---
Eli5 please never played evil dead
---
*Hgnnn Colonel...*

It’s the Trapper
---
It looks to be that way, they look 100% legitimate
---
1, 2, oatmeal; Kirby is a pink guy
---
Yes but i don’t get triggered by video games to the point where I break stuff. 
---
Botany counters sloppy, Healing counters Than. Botany is a healing perk. 
---
Hot take: if you need to rely on a perk to be good, you're bad.
---
Except the rank up system. Apparently I'm rank 7 material because most of my 3k are safety pips. I'm saying this now, if they don't change the system a bit rank 1 killers are going to be fucking monsters. Which maybe that's what they are going for but hell at rank 7 most of my games have been against rank 1 or 2 survivors today. 
---
Correct. That was last year's roadmap which began with the Clown. This Evil Dead chapter would start next year's road map. It would not surprise me if the next 4 killers are all licensed. Or at least the next two chapters considering those coincide with two big events for DbD (dedicated servers and Switch port). 
---
Who would the killer be if it's a chapter release? Evil Ash? Henriette? Mean rapist tree?
---
\#fucklegion (Not literally)
---
hey, just wanted to tell you how pretty this drawing is! you made a spirit main really happy today :) keep it up.
---
Non obsession DS not so much.
---
 And ds didn't have any consistent counter. Sure you can dribble IF you're close to a hook, sure you can drop them to try stun them, sure you can slug them if you wish to sacrifice your pressure and immediately lose to unbreakable. But none of these were consistent. Sometimes there is no hook or drop or you can't afford slugging and there is a god window or pallet nearby. Strong perks need consistent counters, like noed has (though i still think it's bullshit).
---
I want a dick reveal. 
---
Thanks everyone!
---
He’s the same concept as the pig tho, put you on a timer otherwise you die (get downed in legion’s case) the difference is you trade the pig’s stealth and potential lethality of the RBT for mobility and tracking
---
Unless you look at the ping lol. 
---
Anyone who needed the old DS to enjoy the game shouldn't have had it. The game and the community are better of without it in it's former state. It is still usable too, it just now won't effect/be used against Killers with Moris or who don't tunnel people.
---
As for Borrowed Time, I'm not sure I see the issue. Besides it going down quickly outside of a chase it's better that the person effected by it can Mend themselves to Injured. Previously you had to have Self-Care equipped or go down anyway. 
---
IMO it *could* do with a few buffs (like letting Mending take precedence over Snapping Out Of It, being based on Killer proximity rather than Terror Radius, and **not** letting a Killer moonwalk a Survivor to death) but those were all problems old Borrowed Time faced (besides the moonwalking, but old BT was worse because it could just be waited out mid-chase). 
---
...to the point where I break stuff I paid money for?
---
No, I don’t ever do that. 
---
&gt;a difficult skill check
---
OmgeaLUL
---
All of those other perks can be used even if the killer has a Mori. 
---
Someone mentioned that the demon Eligos could be the killer (if there is a killer).
---
Someone has never been around a girl
---
Never said I relied on them, just made the game a lot more enjoyable to me
---
That is fine but the pig can't keep smacking during her dash attack she has to aim and hit on point. If a legion misses then 0.001 seconds later he hits.
---
I’ll be honest with you I’ve played against the plague three times so far and disconnected every time.  I’m tempted to agree with those saying she is OP. I hear what you’re saying about it being a team game but I’m thinking even bigger than that to the integrity of the game as a whole.  If we don’t show what we are displeased with and voice it and act out our displeasure (through d/cs) then the game folks will never intervene and make the necessary adjustments 
---
"Annnnd release update... Oh god we broke everything."
---
These are the only tik toks I can accept
---
Wow look, the same post I’ve seen 20 times already :/
---
It was just an idea since Bill is PC exclusive. I didnt have to download him. 
---
Oh I definitely agree there should be a penalty for whiffing
---
New and original killer concept Nr 377, please wait in line
---
Oh hey, I saw this on the HB Server. Good job!
---
I’ve stabbed a controller before... I was drunk and I can’t remember what game I was playing.. but the shame afterwards.. yup... that I remember.
---
I didn't even know you could have followers on reddit
---
adendum...tried playing her on PC and it turns out shes just shit on console do to fuck all aim....on pc i can actually hit a long stream and in about 2 streams people are broken.....
---
TLDR i was wrong shes just shit on console....i think its time to move to PC full time
---
No like dude I’ve never really raged before 😂  this is the first and only time I’ve done this so... emmm yeah 😂
---
I'm just using brown add ons until I get used to her, that being said using 2 to increase vile purge effectiveness or using 2 add ons to increase corrupt purge seems the way to go. 
---
Idk dude the rank system has been hitting me pretty hard too. I’ve lost quite a few pips today :( 
---
yup turns out shes just shit on console....might be time for me to move to pc full stop
---
Me neither I’m pretty calm and quite shy but holy crap this match there’s nuclear waste less toxic then this swf 
---
The Plague was released today, March 19th
---
As an American and hater if iFunny, can confirm I hate iFunny
---
Maybe post it here? I want to see it.
---
For honor... huh
---
So because of 1 situation in which the perk performs like a shittier BT, DS needs another nerf? 
---
If we are nerfing perks that are super powerful in specific situations we would be nerfing nearly every perk in the game.
---
It’s funny you say most adults cut their losses— where I’m coming from is I’m an adult with limited time to game. Im  it gunna squander it running away mending and healing in an interminable Legion match!
---
I appreciate the comment but I never meant to imply that I needed them or that killers are now op with this nerf, just that I got used to the way those worked and really enjoyed playing with them in my arsenal against the baddies. I agree with you 100% though, most times I lose its my own mistakes or some other survivor wasting pallets/farming me on hook.
---
BHVR: hmmm....buff Freddy or troll the fan base?
---
The new matchmaking system the patch brought along has been awful for me at least, i keep getting 300+ ping and 3-man games, that is if the loading screen doesn’t freeze up for me getting into the match
---
That is what makes the skill gap nothing. Also I think the pig and legion are not comparable because the timer on the bear trap doesn't start until a gen pops. Legion can use nurses and then your timer will always run out and it tells him where you got downed.
---
 no the guy in the hiking gear
---
\-Lobby dodgin. I personally don't even understand why people dodge. I love to see 4 squad survivors with flashes xD. It's funny and easy even in rank 1 if you play it right \^\^.
---
\-Hatch standoff. Agree with everything.
---
\-The ranking system. I know alot of people who play just like rank 15 in rank 1. My sister is an good example. She doesn't know how to loop, how to juke or how to use pallets correctly and that at rank 1! On the other side I have a good friend who is a god in juking, looping and everything else. Well, he is rank 5 at the moment cause he helps his teammates alot and yes ALOT more than a casual player.
---
\-Hitboxes. I can just Agree with like everything else.
---
\-Peer-to-peer servers. How to deal with 600+ ping? Glitch threw escape door xD.

\-Ending. In my experience (2,5 years of playing) this game is unbalanced af. I see alot of bad killers like myself on rank 1 who are there because of the ranking system. On the other hand I see alot of survivors on rank 1 who play like rank 10. And then I see alot of extremely good player at rank 5-10. I really don't understand it. Lags are most of the time a benefit for the killer so lagswitching=win. There is only one escape.... going to doctor to get my addiction away and uninstall this game\^\^.
---
And yes I'm not a native english speaker. Not surprising I guess.
---
?
---
Are you trying to be sarcastic?
---
I haven't seen anyone run it.
---
The puking does very little to help in a chase. It just tells you they are broken. She really isn't that good. The range on her purge is very short, and since they nerfed her movement speed while holding it you can loop her easily if she holds it in. I think she is a solid killer. Fun to play, fun to play against. Not op, and not complete hot garbage. 
---
dude i know i need BBQ so bad....i hate playing without it
---
...
---
Oh man going against a peacekeeper as a highlander made me delete the game 3 times
---
killers always have queue times when a new killer releases. everyone tries them out. lasts like a week usually.
---
That’s Meg... lol
---
some back story to this 
---
Swf 
---
There all... ALL running purple flashlights 
---
They are ALL running Adrenaline 
---
And self heal... for the exception of one that was running kindred ??
---
So in the absolute salt fest that was that match I couldn’t get one hook :)))))) and all the survivors I’m like 10000% sure they trained in the art of spin.... 
---
im going to rainbow six now... for now.
---
came in this thread to make the same comment, thanks for saving me time
---
I'm ashamed to say I only played one survivor match and I killed myself on hook because it was Freddy and I didn't want to play freddy. Sorry team. 
---
Why my pp hard?
---
There are multiple reasonable ways to counter pretty much anything, even if those counters are difficult, so like I said, we should undo every change that has ever been made.
---
I havent played it on survivor yet but i feel the same on killer side. On a match i just played there was one surv left and there was 4 gens. Took me a pretty long time to find her.
---
Man I really shouldn’t have posted this eh? Lol. First post and last in this sub, can’t believe the amount of hate in dm’s just for being sad about perks I enjoyed having been changed
---
They do sort of link to it with this:
---
This update also contains some additional optimizations for all platforms. Click here for more information
---
The click here part links to:
---
We are currently in step 2 where the biggest changes are supposed to happen. This covers:
---
STEP 2: CPU, GPU AND CONTEXTUAL OPTIMIZATIONS
---
Target: Chapter 11 and ongoing
---
This is the core of the work to improve the performance and the game’s frame rate. 
---
There are many opportunities for optimization, but here are the three main pillars overarching our efforts:
---
CPU optimizations: improving the game’s baseline systems
---
This is where the game world is simulated (interactions, character navigation, perks and powers). We will be converting our slowest gameplay blueprints to C++ which should, in specific cases, run ten to two hundred times faster. We are also moving from a tick-based system to an event-based-system. A tick-based system is much more demanding, as it constantly pokes the CPU to know when to trigger an action, while an event-based system can enable an event only when necessary and therefore reduce the stress on the CPU.
---
GPU Optimizations: Overall Graphic Optimizations
---
The GPU is where the game world is rendered into an image which is then drawn on the screen. The optimization actions listed below mainly affect the game’s visual representation. The objective is to render the world faster without sacrificing quality. We will be updating our anti-aliasing system to TXAA and moving the SSAO to a compute shader, simplify our shadow pass, optimize character outlines, improve LODs, slim render passes, bake more lights, use imposter rendering for specific objects (trees, grass) and more.
---
Contextual Optimizations: Performance Spikes for Specific Actions
---
We are working on optimizations that pay at any given time when you play (as mentioned above under GPU/CPU) but we also know there are specific actions and/or Killers that will need extra optimization. These are problematic cases where we see major hitches in performance. Here are a few examples: multiple characters moving in close quarters, specific Killer slow down, perks combination, etc.
---
Maybe we should be needing every perk in the game. Make people rely more on skill and less on crutches. 
---
*plus the adapt achievements aren't working* 
---
:(  at least, not for my friend and I
---
It’s on KYF on consoles
---
As someone who’s played COD almost their whole life I wouldn’t even dare assume that. Dc’ing is about as effective as making an angry post on Fb about politics, you’re only disturbing those you’re closely connected too, not the creators/owners/devs etc. Not even slightly. If anything from a marketing standpoint having people so emotional they need to dc is a success, as they created a product that’s hype worthy.
---
Lmao you’re funny. She’s just not a shitty killer like you’re used to and you haven’t adapted your style to playing against her. She probably had the add on for the puke. Suck it up and learn to play against her. Don’t cry nerf or we get another worthless boring killer. 
---
Now they got to get rid of noed. Or just change it so it's not as strong. I'm so glad DS is gone, though.
---
New ds is fine. Borrowed time is fine. Anyone messaging you about it is a dick but these perks needed a change lol 
---
I actually accidentally broke my tv lol playing this game
---
Mending doesn’t proc nurses, people wanted it to because “snapping out of it” did but they changed that because they didn’t want mending to proc nurses and people were complaining that if one is a “healing action” the other should be. The reason why RBT doesn’t start until after a gen is popped is because you have to run around the entire map looking for the correct box, with legion if you can get out of the chase you’re safe to mend
---
God I know right, I wish they’d just remove Nea already 
---
There was a post earlier saying that it was bugged for the moment. Patricia from bhvr said its gonna be fixed in next patch 
---
Are you suggesting current DS is a crutch? If so I think you’ve just solidified this conversation as a waste of time for the both of us. 
---
These devs are a fucking joke.
---
honestly this has made me make the full switch to PC...that and shes trash to play on console. The game looks like dog shit on my 1x....there is no excuse for that.
---
Meh played 2 games against her and am underwhelmed just keep her out of LOS like huntress honestly 
---
that's trapper
---
why is she so... masculine? that looks like a beard
---
Don’t be ashamed. Half the games I play I fight the urge to quit because it’s some plague bullshit 
---
Alright, thank you.
---
Then go soak your head lmao. Nobody is forcing you to reply. What exactly did you hope to get out of this conversation that wouldn't be a waste of time? 
---
When I do dailies for Bill my surviving rate gets a lot lower for some reason.
---
Meaning adults (mature anyways) don’t throw people under the bus for self preservation. They accept their fate. Of course there’s exceptions, and not everyone has “true grit” to persevere.
---
anyone else getting EAC error code 4?
---
Are we looking at the same picture?
---
It's on a timer so that Survivors don't just dip into a locker after rounding a corner for a free get away.
---
It's perfect why should you pip at rank 4 with only silver gens, I love the new pip system all them urban evaders who don't make saves will never be rank 1 again perfect.
---
Fair enough,
---
She's really powerful. When she uses a corrupted fountain it's like a machine gun of hatchets. I honestly find her more annoying than the Legion.
---
Fair enough, thanks for honesty. I guess they were pretty broken in the right hands before the nerf. And I suppose borrowed time didn’t change much, just annoyed that if the killer is just barely out of range and then immediately comes back when I unhook someone it becomes useless
---
"Dont worry, the gentle hare will take good care of you..."
---
Jane main big brain
---
Oddly, haven't run into her yet.
---
I've gotten into a game where every other survivor was the new one, though.
---
Hahah fair enough.  Maybe that’s true and it’s not a great form of protest.  But what it is effective at is getting me out of undesirable games fast!
---
does it even work in kyf
---
She gets very little scoring in the Brutality category, that’s why. She’s damn near not worth playing right now.
---
Resolution is downgraded but framerates are massively improved 
---
Guys this is the same idiot who compared the plague to spirit. When nobody ever mentioned them two in the same sentence of a previous post i saw OP post on about the plague 
---
Can’t argue with that one :P
---
So, you acknowledge the fact that it's only been out 48 hours, yet say that the killer is boring, even though you haven't even played her.
---
Don’t know if anyone will still respond but it wasn’t put up this week. 
---
Does Nurse’s calling work with the plague’s fountains? 
---
So you accept that BBQ has multiple counters. Cool, that's all I was aiming to get you to acknowledge.
---
We all know it's going to be the rapey tree
---
Honestly I’d delete too hard 
---
Nah, it can’t be. Couple of reasons;
---
-They’d need permission (doubt they’d go through the trouble to get the rights to Evil Dead just for a joke).
---
-The leaked perks would be on PC too.
---
-The perks make too much sense and look too legit to be a joke- if it was an early April Fool’s joke, the perks would probably be really fucking dumb.
---
The original actor was always the best
---
It could only be funnier if you were laurie so you could go
---
"it's just a prank bro!"
---
Great. Can we get Hellraiser now? Pleeeaaaase... por favor???
---
But your comparison is wrong. Because you can use unbreakable at anytime as long as you are on the ground. The 1 hook prerequisite makes it so if the killers got a Mori, you won't have use of your strike, cos you get a dank mori instead. I feel it wasn't thought through well enough, again you don't have to agree. Just see that your comparison is bad. 
---
maybe, but Im afraid I'll get even harder ones
---
Don't underestime his stealth.  Survivors in the Dream World suffer the samr bullshit lighting and fog that Freddy does.
---
Also, learn how to mindgame the Dream Transition.  Free hits.

The comment we all need to see
---
Not to be annoying but I have terrible eyesight and the pic for some reason on my screen is terrible quality...is this written out anywhere or anyone have a clearer image? Attempting to look around but nothing yet 
---
I think DS is finally balanced now, it’s no longer just gimmick for toxic survivors anymore, it fulfills it’s purpose much better now.
---
Oh so very true. This ain’t a rumour or a hoax, this shit’s in the console version of the game.
---
Let me ask this though is actually real cause it could be fake for all we know cause they just dropped this dlcs out be to early for another dlc 
---
&gt; once in a while under very specific circumstances and usually they don't even work, as I pointed out repeatedly
---
And you've been repeatedly told that is wrong. 
---
Saying 'because X argument applies to Y situation, X argument perfectly applies to every situation' is not a logical conclusion.
---
And again you keep trying to bring up DS as if I'm in anyway talking about DS. I'm only talking about you trying to say that BBQ is OP and doesn't have reliable counters. 
---
BBQ can be easily, repeatedly, and consistently countered through commonly available methods, which keep it balanced. You keep trying to throw out 'very specific' 'unreliable' 'usually don't work' 'once in a while' and none of that is true. You are actually lying about the counters to BBQ so that you can keep saying it's unfair and OP.
---
Well that's we're thinking argument ends because that's a huge damn lie. 
---
Rapist tree = Groot off camera
---
Secrets out.
---
Ahhh Yes!  It's her off Spartacus &amp; Xena.  Thank You V Much 😃👍
---
Yes, the discription of the perk says "you're permantely on the injuried state"
---
Yes, I’m pretty sure because you can use dead ard with it.
---
Yes, No Mither counts as being Injured.
---
Yes absolutely.
---
Although block addons are still good to run.  Gets you cheeky gen grabs and easy hits
---
It only happened for like 5 minutes during a match but kinda cucked me. 
---
That part of the video has never been so relevant than at this moment. The Ash leaks, Unbreakable not being so unbreakable... I love it.
---
there's literally swearing in game lol
---
i wouldnt say massively...but they are improved
---
Spoilers...
---
Lovely, thanks.
---
Freddy is B tier.  Come at me
---
This patch has made this game pretty shitty on my One X.  I’m experiencing stuttering that wasn’t there before and a severe graphical downgrade.  It is nice to hear that base console has been boosted, though. That was rough. 
---
Elm Street, however.
---
Can you imagine if it was *2* seconds
---
Dont bother using boil over instead
---
Active for 60 seconds after unhook? Why even have this in the game at all? Get rid of it this garbage tier perk.
---
All of them are functional 
---
Improved enough that I'm not constantly dropping frames as killer in chase so I'll take it.
---
Ikr what a cuite
---
Please tell me the title was a joke, this is in no way fake. The devs just fucked up big time.
---
Honestly, the game needs to remove the option to Leave Game. It makes no sense. At least throw on a 30 minute - Hour wait time whenever you use it. 
---
Whoa. Good catch. Why isn't this upvoted yet?
---
I've repeatedly pointed out how the "counters" you list are not reliable or helpful. Over and over.
---
There is a perk that allows killers to see people in lockers, so hiding in a locker is not a reliable counter ie cannot be done every time.
---
Hiding behind generators is almost never useful.
---
Getting within the distance where they can't see you is not useful as it just makes the killer camp your teammate every time and also puts you at higher risk of being seen so it isn't a good stealth move.
---
You are the one lying saying these counters are "always useful" and "always work".
---
And it is a logical conclusion of your argument since your argument is literally "BBQ has counters so it's okay and shouldn't be changed". In that case nothing that has counters, no matter how ridiculously slim the chance of using them is, should ever be changed.
---
I did just get a whole new problem though. Was about halfway through a match then it showed all survivors DC at the same time and I got my points and quitter bonus for all. Then when I tried to start a match got that message about player level profile or whatever. 
---
Scared the fuck out of me I though my level was gonna reset again.

---
Notice how I said "killer" and not "the killer". I find killer in general boring
---
Why the fuck did I get 10 downvoted for that?  😳
---
It really wouldn't be that good. Use common sense and avoid Survivors. At that point the Killer basically becomes an alternate version of the Wraith in that they can get closer to people before being noticed than most other Killers.
---
Then you have SWF, which I don't even need to detail.
---
No, they fucked up and leaked perks for an upcoming character lol.
---
I see you cycle R6 and DbD as well.... 2 games that make you feel like shit when you play like shit lmao

Oh lmao

---
Oh okay! Thanks! Fingers crossed then
---
Seems like you were 1 shot and 1 hooked lol. Wtf.
---
But does it actually take this amount of time to complete?
---
Easily pipping as survivor too btw
---
Yeah, that's what I mean by "you'd have to be privy to some pretty specific points of their contract to know if there are any legal ramifications." It's not impossible for there to be trouble, but it's not particularly likely either. If this were some tentative playing around with a concept, you'd expect it to look more "beta," not release-quality art with detailed descriptions and flavor text.
---
#Notkillerlife   There is no way to tell what kind of map someone has. Also, out of all things that annoy you, a rainbow map?!
---
So happy. I no longer have to think twice about picking up my obsession when gens are popping. 
---
I feel like there’s so much potential for awesome and unique maps. I feel like this map doesn’t reach that potential. The temple does look cool tho
---
Sorry, its actually tankcats isn't it?
---
havent tried it yet
---
Sucks. My Doctor still just has T1 BBQ. Such a slow... slow... grind.
---
You aren't even a good troll
---
&gt; Hitboxes. I can't tell how many times i've been hit through a window or a pallet when i was meters away. 
---
Hitboxes arent the issue and never were. Its a latency issue that goes back to the peer-to-peer hosting that this game utilises. odds are it looks correct on the killers side of things.
---
Just gonna leave this here :D [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL)
---
I understand this is a joke and I get the reference but I’m not entirely sure how that would serve him well. 
---
Clearly he’d just shoot it and it would start up instantly, come on dude. Use actual logic here. 
---
Damn dude you got me there
---
I think it's the same thing with Head On. Head On becomes useless when the killer has Enduring.
---
I usually can get BBQ first try on a new killer, but no not for poor Adiris :( 
---
Klatu...barada...necktie 
---
I feel you, the new Ranking System is already heavily in favor of SWF and so is noed. Also I am just sick and tired of suvivors not having any strong perks anymore because Killers cry 24/7 when this perk still exists. 
---
Waking up is fast but not always too fast.  I've had situations many times where I had one survivor dead and the other three asleep and I slugged them one after the other.  
---
Freddy applies arguably the most pressure out of any killer, and combined with his natural slow down, you have all the time in the world to eat pallets.  If you're good at general chasing, Freddy shines.
---
Additionally, since he already has insane tracking and game slowing, you don't have to run any tracking or stalling perks.  Freddy can comfortably go into a game with Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, and Brutal Strength for example.  His weak chase potential can be negated since he's the only killer who can stack chase perks without suffering for it.
---
What if they are not fully infected? Just slightly infected. Do they infect everything they touch or just random chance or no infecting at all until fully infected?
---
You keep dismissing proven reliable counters to BBQ. Of course you're entitled to your opinion on the power of BBQ, but you are flat wrong in acting like the counters aren't valid. 
---
You did shift the topic, I made it clear I was only and specifically talking about BBQ and it's counters and you multiple times tried to reframe it as talking about nerfing or buffing every/anything in the game.
---
Shrug emoji. 
---
Do you mean Corrupt Purge?
---
Either way, that’s crazy. 
---
Just gonna leave this here :d [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL)
---
For the third time, you can't use Unbreakable until you're slugged. After your first hook, that'd be any time you could be mori'd, as well. The concept is the same; you'd die after your first hook with both. I'm not "missing" anything, you're ignoring how the two are the same. 
---
Jane's adept also bugged. 
---
Not all tvs are made for gaming. Most models have terrible delay between when you push a button and when it registers. 
---
What’s the leak?
---
1. No because then if they're just in the injured state and not sick then they would heal in the blink of an eye.
---
2. Yes survivors can spread the plague to each other. And the person rescuing the sick guy on the hook will get infected as well.
---
3. I think there are 5 fountains. I can't say for sure but there are at least 3 definitely.
---
It’s playable on PS4, and reported by lots of people.
---
Definitely real.
---
It's been bad for everyone. As survivor when I was playing with my friend we kept joining lobbies for TEN MINUTES trying to find a lobby that didn't have over 300 ping. And as killer, people have been joining my lobby with OVER 400 PING!!! And they've been STAYING!! Those games go horribly so I just dodge those.
---
Corrupt purge yeah lol, been a long few hours going against her. 
---
I 4 stack with my buddies and we had no idea either. 
---
Me and my friends did a build with Unbreakable/Tenacity/Flip-Flop/Boil Over and it worked fairly well when we did a kill your friends game. Plenty of us got off before reaching the hook if we were far enough (like 20m away from a hook mainly).
---
To test it properly we didn't tell two of our friends about it and didn't tell them after the game. It was a shock for them to find out about it. Legit a good set-up if you have friends to back you up.
---
i am not 100% sure cause i'm usually the killer side of plague games but from what i have seen it seems to only infect things at full infection
---
I’ve been finding matches fine but they’re all 700+ ping
---
Not de-pip? Dude youre fucking one way from a double pip calm down.
---
And even if you managed to evade them all game, you dicked your team. You need to go in and spread hooks and waste the killers time. If my friend is on final hook and I unhook them and the killer is on their way, Im fucking running toward that killer so my friend can live. That in turn gives them more time to do gens and me time to increase chase and get more overall hooks that my team can pull me from.
---
Not to be mean, but you played selfish. Distracting the killer is a legit role you need to play as a survivor, you got bronze. You earned that bronze.
---
While you're not wrong, I'd still like to point out that "building hype" would be worthless if people cared enough to look into the DLC and not spend $7 because of bugs like this, if they're that bothersome.
---
It appears that partially sick survivors can work on gens without infecting them, but only for so long, as it makes them sicker but don’t quote me on that. That’s just how it appeared to me. I can’t say for sure what happens to a survivor that heals a partially sick survivor. 
---
Shake it like a ~~Polaroid pictureee~~ incense burnerrr
---
psst downvoting someone who disagrees with you doesnt make them wrong. if you really think SWF was the major factor in True’s loss then theres no point in trying to explain it to you.
---
Same, when I try to swing the game just keeps lagging like crazy, hopefully behavior can fix this asap 
---
Ahh good point, I usually only ever play solo. If you get your meter full in the dying state then someone taking at least 1 hit for you will  be massive.
---
Now *that* is a shit your pants killer. Wait a minute......they could also make the killer Ash's dead ex who got possessed. Hmmmmmm)
---
That's easier said than done tho. Unlike Huntress she can continuously puke for seconds at a time while chasing u. That's not to mention being able to puke on gens, vaults and pallettes. Huntress gets one shot and can't change the direction after she throws it. Plague can, and it's not really fair. I understand the green puke that's fine, the red puke it what I have a problem with is all. I'm fine with the perks too, eventually all killers are gonna run the new Gen perk with Ruin lol let's be real.
---
apparently infection negates BT for some unknown reason
---
Gotta unlock the boomstick to figure it out
---
Jeff was obviously the kid that ate paste in his class.
---
Shorter stun time and completely killed by Enduring. A punishment for something (tunneling) should not be easily countered by a perk, let alone one as popular as Enduring. The logic behind Enduring working on new DS makes no sense.
---
Aside from that, the clock isn’t what it should be. You can chew up much of the clock in chase, and then the rest of it gets used up while lying on the ground. Again, another counter for a killer who just chooses to slug. 
---
It’s just no an effective counter for tunneling at all. It’s a situational perk that you won’t always even get to use when you are tunneled. Add to that the minuscule stun time on top of that, and you have a worthless perk.
---
That or armored cats, but I didn't want to nitpick.
---
Do they?
---
Can confirm. Mines 🅱️roke too.

Not having any problems on PS4. Both me and my friend are rank 5 if that makes a difference 
---
I assume this is Ash pre Evil Dead 2.
---
What *you* consider to be "proven reliable counters". I do not have to agree with you. In my opinion they are not reliable, and in my experience both as a survivor and killer running BBQ (both in high ranks) they do not work most of the time. When I run BBQ at high ranks I can still see survivors trying to hide behind generators, and it is not difficult to find survivors who rush into the minimum distance so I can't see their aura, etc. I have not played as much since the changes to lockers but the fact there is a perk that allows killers to see survivors in lockers makes that automatically a less reliable counter.
---
And I have all this time, including before you commented, been referring to the balance of the game as a whole and the way that the perks interact with one another to form the balance, and the ongoing trend of nerfing survivors while buffing killers unnecessarily. You are the one who wants to change the subject, I have been consistently talking about the same thing this entire time.

Running Intervention AND ruin is a sign of a bad killer. A coordinated team will spend the first 2 minutes searching for ruin in that case. If your team all had the same idea it would be a non-issue. I think you should look at your team as the problem.
---
seeing as thats their lead character designer, its a safe bet thats your killer bub! i cant wait

You just need to get used to her. Keep practicing.
---
Not a huge deal. Sure, some suspense is lost, but we all love the concept! If it's only a survivor release, like with Bill, then it's really not a problem. Otherwise, well, we don't know anything about the other perks/map and the killer is speculation.
---
Its you. My wait times are less than 1 minute as killer. Usually 20 seconds.
---
Idk but the fact that there is a queue to create a lobby seems pretty broke
---
This has been happening to me a lot as well. Match making is super weird right now. Not only do I get paired with people who have ten billion ping from China they're also rank 20 when I'm rank 9. Lol
---
Looks very cool! 
---
Since this update I’ve had 3 games in a row crash.
---
Weird... but I like it.
---
Thanks. The BP loss sucks, I was more concerned with Jane not having any perks. I'll definitely send in that ticket.
---
Dicked his team by doing gens sure... 
---
See!! I’ve been dealing with this bs all day lmao 
---
Yeah, I played for like 4 hours today on PS4, only got to play against Plague once lol. Dunno if it's bad luck or just no one is playing her but that's a FeelsBadMan.
---
So if you save someone from a hook and you have borrowed time, if she hits them with corrupt purge it just downs them 
---
Glad to help :) And yea it really does suck. When I sent in a ticket I didn't remember how many points I actually lost so I just estimated and said 500k (it was probably more like 300k) and they gave me 500k, no questions asked, so I wouldn't worry about being too horribly accurate with how much you lost either.
---
F indeed
---
I'm copying a refference picture yes, but it is not traced. It would be much nicer had I traced it.
---
Yeah. I don’t flame but it’s likely I’ll dc if it’s a legion. If it’s Franks Mixtape legion I’m fucking out before I see him. 
---
Nice work, bro.
---
Wouldn't mind her putting her trap on me
---
If it were true, then he better come with a chainsaw and a boom stick. Groovy.
---
Not really sure why you're being downvoted, there is a lot of toxicity in the community but it sucks to hear it's prevalent on the official server.
---
no its a joke
---
&gt; And even if you managed to evade them all game, you dicked your team
---
He got every other emblem iridescent. He did anything but dick his team. 
---
As much as it's still cool to get Ash in the game, I hope it's a full DLC pack with killer+Surv. 
---
I run Borrowed Time and We’ll Make It. I guess half my build is now worthless... How does this make it through testing???
---
Longest I’ve waited is 6 minutes on Xbox average has been 2
---
Borrowed time has been broken since the ptb. They never fixed it.
---
What a shocker. /s
---
What’s the boomstick 
---
Anyone else find it crazy that they have a full set of working perks an entire chapter before they are released? Makes me wonder how long it takes them to create a single perk from start to finish. I wish we would get a mid-chapter perk patch; a decent set of new perks while also re-working and re-balancing some of the most underused perks.
---
One of the perks is gonna be “shotgun blast” shoot the killer in the face every 5 minutes
---
It’s broken, you can also be downed with the basic attack.
---
There are 4 fountains in total and once they are all corrupted (once survivors used all 4 and the plague never drained the corruption), it'll get cleansed automatically.  
---
Alright the consensus is that it should work. Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
