For perks run ruin, bbq, stbfl and infectious fright. You could change stbfl out for brutal strength or enduring but I can't seem to get brutal strength on any of my blood webs.

Should get them in 2-3 games!
---
Ok, so I watched his reveal trailer
---
1. Was he a scrapped survivor idea or something? 
---
2. Why don't we have a shopping mall or store map? That'd be sick
---
3. Why doesn't Ghostface have a shopping cart in game? That'd be great lol
---
I looked at your page and let me say your awesome! You should do a chibi Ghostface in the Devil outfit. It‚Äôll be a contrast between cute and creepy
---
*cries in ballerina Feng*
---
I completely agree with these other comments. However, I want to add that high rank survivors will look for your traps in their high traffic areas, in their common loop set ups and especially by hooks/pallets. Personally, I've had great success with completely random placement of my traps. Unexpected traps equal unexpected hits. The bug and necklace add ons are a must. Monitor and Abuse is a must perk. However the rest are flexible. I use M&amp;A, nurses calling (because the radius for detecting healing is greater than your terror radius), sloppy butcher and bloodhound (good for chase and finding slugs). With a low terror radius, a short stature and random traps, if you take a random route to get to survivors, you can take them completely off guard. This makes them panic and make mistakes. I'd also reccomend her black cosmetics for extra surprise. Have fun and be spooky.
---
XD
---
Thank you! I don‚Äôt know why I never thought to do devil ghostface. That‚Äôs actually a great idea! Keep an eye out for it, because I‚Äôm definitely going to draw that!
---
I look forward to it!
---
He is honestly very overrated. He is like B tier.
---
Who‚Äôs the doge with the beanie
---
Don't threaten them with a good time!
---
Wooow so salty. Instead of learning how to play against the killer you insult the person playing him lol. No doubt it‚Äôs bloody hard against Freddy but I‚Äôve done it, I‚Äôve escaped since the rework. It just takes practice.
---
The effect makes it feel like the wind is so strong that it strip my character naked. xxxposed.
---
Screenshot them and send it too BHVR support, they are pretty good at punishing toxic people.
---
If you didn't play L4D2 with an Ellis who was spamming the adrenaline noise all game did you really play L4D2
---
Been playing her since her release. It would be very sad if I had to adjust 3 years worth of muscle memory and predictions because of a drastic change to her kit.

Is he really that bad? I haven't had more trouble with him than others. I'm also not very good but even still. Is it that bad for some?
---
Clown
---
Nea
---
Are goobers actually wanting him to get nerfed
---
Triangles have three sides
---
Wait I‚Äôve seen this one before
---
jokes on you I bring breakdown with my sabo build
---
Why does he look like he's got a candle on his head
---
I just played my first game against him today, it took me a minute to get used to him not being weak but it was fun
---
That‚Äôs what I thought lmao that person doesn‚Äôt want to admit that ‚Äútrying another build‚Äù is nearly impossible because most survivor perks don‚Äôt even help survivor gameplay. There‚Äôs a reason nearly all survivors are using the same perks lol
---
F
---
Damn. Didn‚Äôt know you could do that. I‚Äôm a console pleb as well.
---
And I‚Äôve got a feeling BHVR will cave because they aways cave to survivors asking for nerfs the same thing happened to Freddy the first time around the same thing happened to Ghost Face before he even released (even though they had said before they will never change a character before they get released)
---
How does that make survivor more interesting?
---
God, I hope they don't listen to them. Freddy doesn't deserve to be nerfed. He's in a really good shape right now. For the longest time he was one of the most disliked killers in the game. Please, Behaviour don't budge on this.
---
Nurse is probably the hardest killer to learn at least to the point of competency.  Even Hillbilly isn't too hard to get halfway decent with the chainsaw.  Nurse blinks are so much harder because of the reads you have to make.
---
I remember when he first released you could get like a couple thousand points from stalking one person haha
---
Listen here you little shit
---
It's funny cuz just today i got saved by a Kate from a Clown by the exit gate where i would have died otherwise without BT
---
My grandmother called, she asked when you'd be back to give her tennis lessons.
---
Spirit is a *teenager*...
---
It says he‚Äôs hard, but he‚Äôs not really. You just have to get used to him.
---
&lt;3
---
He could use minor buffs, mostly to his snares and a few add ons, like the shitty z block
---
I mean, there‚Äôs a good reason why she‚Äôs on the hit list for addon reworks. 
---
Nurse is a difficult character to master but once you‚Äôve done that it‚Äôs hardly a game anymore. That‚Äôs why red ranks consist of nurses, billy and spirit. She‚Äôs a top tier killer and arguably the best of the 3.
---
Who complains about Franklin's and Legion? It's 2019
---
Because survivors can‚Äôt stand the idea of a powerful killer they will actually have to put in effort to go against (but they still bitch about Billy Nurse and Spirit taking up all of the red ranks) maybe if any other killer was viable we‚Äôd see more killers in high ranks
---
üòò
---
It looks like the Entity forgot to add in a gen so it just dropped it where ever and Jane just happened to be there.
---
A literal rock with a terror radius would 4k at rank 16. So many survivors in that rank just do *nothing* if they‚Äôre in the heartbeat.
---
Apparently salty swfs
---
No need to come after my head y‚Äôall. I didn‚Äôt watch the Q&amp;A and I most likely heard it from an reliable source. Calm down lol
---
Havnt seen anyone complaining about any of these things.... just looked through 5 pages.....
---
Well that's shitty
---
Never see clown or Bubba that much anymore.
---
How did you manager to do that? I meant i know the head Is Photoshop per but i'm talking about the body. How did you glitch It that way?
---
How about being productive and giving suggestions (that make reasonable sense)  to fix your problem instead of asking without better feedback given
---
I have never been so confused.
---
I still constantly see bitching about franklins in comments
---
Fuck you...
---
Looking back, the hag isn‚Äôt outshined by Freddy, but the Clown has 4 charges on his Toxins, compared to Freddy‚Äôs 8 on his dream snares. While clown does have better range on his bottles I don‚Äôt feel that outshines the new map control Freddy gains from his teleport and the stall he gains from survivors trying to go wake up. Freddy just seems like he has a flat out upgrade to Clowns power
---
I don't want him nerfed, i just want to go up against people who don't just tunnel and camp with him still. I know i probably sound like an entitled complaining survivor but I'd just love a match against a freddy utilising their new powers and not playing like a total 4head
---
Have a wonderful night! Gl in your games and see you around
---
I‚Äôve asked this before and still have yet to test it myself. But does franklins work with frenzy? As well as hatchets and pigs ambush? Since they aren‚Äôt considered basic attacks?
---
That's a neat little detail!
---
I used to watch that shit on telemoondo even though I never could understand it because it was in spanish.
---
Uh duh?
---
Actually the pay off is far worth it you stop a hook and get a stun and make the killer go into another chase and when it‚Äôs a survivor with friends and everyone on the team blocks the hook to stop the killer from hooking it‚Äôs pretty fucked I‚Äôve even got a full team to body block a killer when no one was in SWF and it was so sad for the killer and then survivors complain about slugging XD
---
Teenager doesn't automatically mean underage and I highly doubt the lore has a naked underage woman running around with a sword
---
Exactly. There‚Äôs a reason the old perks are still the meta. All the new survivor perks (except MoM, which was completely ruined and doesn‚Äôt see use anymore) have been jokes or weaker versions of perks we already had. Killer perk choice has been much more varied, and I‚Äôve even seen less BBQ and Ruin in place of things like PGTW and even thrilling tremors. It‚Äôs way easier to vary your killer perk selection since most of the killer perks are useful, whereas most survivor perks are memes or just plain bad.
---
Get rid of collisions, allow the killer to push survivors out of the way, make both survivors and killers block less of an area.
---
I think they would have been fine with some tweaks to the old Freddy. I liked how unique it was. If they had added in the mechanic of always falling asleep and had to use an alarm clock to wake up and kept everything else the same it would have been cool. I really liked the major difference between being awake and asleep and now it's not much of a big deal.
---
Sounds like a good idea, they should also add more incentives with Player Devotion.
---
I havent found pallets annoying at all. I find them super easy to counter. I‚Äôve gotten fooled by *one* out of the few games i‚Äôve played against him.
---
You ever heard of the doctor?
---
Easiest way to ban hacks is to ban all background programs
---
*taps head*
---
Mmmmm no
---
If I understand both of their powers correctly than the clown has more slow with his bottles and more aoe but that's definitely not as helpful as Freddys tp or the ability to spam his snares at a loop
---
Why
---
I play to have fun, being in a game that's failed to doom and not going to get me much bloodpoints is not fun for me, so I'd probably just DC and find a new match.
---
That said I due respect you for playing it out
---
WHY THE FUCK DID I GET A DEPIP FOR SOMEONE DISCONNECTING WHILE LOADING
---
does reporting for that even do anything?
---
He isn‚Äôt wrong. Anyone can play omega blink nurse and easily get a 3-4k
---
Wraiths worse and honestly Amanda might be too. People really underestimate Legions map control especially with certain perks like thanatophobia, discordance and distressing. He runs a 3 gen strat good luck beating that
---
This is a old joke from since the game first came out that Nea is the killer
---
Intended or unintended?
---
Nea is killer dead meme.
---
I‚Äôd rather get a hook on someone than get a few hits in.
---
Yeah but killer wait times are way too long. And I'm lazy so
---
Not me tool box
---
Lmao
---
It works on frenzy, idk about hatchets or ambush tho
---
it‚Äôs worthless
---
Oooh, I just noticed the the bottom! Hahaha. Nea is the Entity.
---
It adds more variety to base gameplay so you can stray from doing the exact same thing every game
---
Rofl, that's what I was doing?? But then you couldn't pick that up ü§îü§∑
---
What was so op about him?
---
I personally think survivors should be buffed somehow especially against killers with almost 0 terror radious.
---
Oh gee I couldn‚Äôt pick up the sarcasm over the internet I am dumb ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
If you get looped around something 5 times and it‚Äôs a fake pallet, you‚Äôre doing something wrong.
---
Intended according to the dev stream.
---
Poggers. I like it.
---
Hex: MC Hammer.
---
Very strong ones, judging from that flair üëÄ
---
I loved how Matt just completely demolished any hope immediately after this quote happened.
---
Laughed my ass off.
---
I think you forget that while disguised you probably have the same movement speed as survivors which is slower. It's just a bad power for a killer.
---
Insidious mori bubba is also toxic fyi ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I don‚Äôt play apex
---
Yes but dream pallets are hilarious
---
I LOST 2 MICHEAL OFFERINGS THIS WAY BECAUSE SURVIVORS ARE TOO AFRAID OF SECRET OFFERINGS
---
Yup. Punctuation goes inside quotation marks in nearly all circumstances. Though honestly, the people that'll complain about it are also the kinda people that are more interested in the appearance of writing rather than the substance of it.
---
Yes. If you are asleep, you can see him place them down.
---
Beautiful sight, especially as I was playing doctor
---
Ok! I am rank 18 and really new to the game and unlocked borrowed yesterday, so sorry for such a stupid question lol.
---
Probably he dropped them knowing he could still get away just so no one else would think it was real.
---
I don't think it's that bad at all. It gave me a good giggle regardless of some stupid watermark, I didnt notice until people pointed it out honestly, but I dont even look at that stuff
---
They're really not lackluster at all.  They're actually very strong.  TBH as someone who has played a decent amount of Clown it saddens me that Freddy's traps are basically a better version of Clown's only power...
---
Why are there questions asking about gender, sexuality and race? What does that have to do with DBD?
---
Yeah there should be a "surrender" option if someone DCs within the first 30 seconds or so
---
I have definitely seen it happen on both sides. So I am pretty sure it's a thing still
---
Truly awful
---
They're both sandbagging. Sandbagging is just anything you do that intentionally holds another survivor back from doing well. Y'know, like tying a bag of sand to their ankles.
---
I'm not negative. The thread is about making survivor game play more interesting and then you made a comment to me that didn't make any sense.
---
I like the idea of either pushing them a little cloer to being fully asleep,or giving the notification on an awake survivor. Doing both might be a bit much.

---
Whenever I try to play chill this happens. This is why I play doc with IK and ebony Mori.
---
But Killer is still host. Yes the person with 700 ping should dodge the lobby, but the bigger problem is, she shouldn‚Äôt be placed in that lobby to begin with. (If its 700 stable that is).
---
Hag, Plague and Clown
---
What show?
---
ik but it just looks like a rash to me lol
---
30% of the questions. I‚Äôm not your friend and I am chill, just seems unprofessional.
---
WHAT?   It's 3%?  Why is it so bad?
---
he really is not wrong though
---
I mean I get the shirtless Myers meme I don‚Äôt get the open gate close gate template. Lol
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to be professional. I‚Äôm not a member of Behaviour.
---
Find a pallet, hold W and either A or D into the longest wall next to it when the killer comes and drop it when he's half the wall away from you. Congrats you just hit peak survivor
---
More of a punishment than 0 points for the match and losing two pips...? What do you suggest?
---
Regardless it‚Äôs unprofessional.
---
and?
---
I bet the killer was like "WTF dude what are you doing"
---
I like it
---
You're out of your mind if you think Franks mixtape isn't a 12 hour loop of Rockefeller street
---
Honestly? If survivors would just be a little bit more stealthy, they'd win basically every game. If the killer doesn't know where you are, they can't hit you. Even with BBQ, nearly no killer can move fast enough to capitalize on the reveal besides Nurse, Billy, and now Freddy.
---
They're just so impatient and want to win the game in less than a minute, instead of taking their time and guaranteeing a 4-escape every single round.
---
Spine chill
---
The saddest part is it always happens to me **just** when I need it to register.
---
Like if the survivor is an inch away from a pallet and I need to quickly lunge before they can make it but then it just doesn't register and they get the pallet lol
---
Stef√°n is a snacc
---
Odd, I've never had this issue at all. People reporting this issue here should say what kind of hardware they are using
---
Here's the [KYM](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/open-the-gate) page for it, at least.
---
It's not the Killer's fault the survivor has terrible internet. If your connection sucks it's going to suck in every lobby.
---
I did not lol. Immediately started using balanced landing and dead hard. Never ran urban, I learned from good youtubers like: noob3, truetalent, and Ussylis. I picked up on the game very fast and got red ranks within a month. But I now realize that, that doesn‚Äôt happen for most.

It's only be 'unprofessional' if this was some kind of public corporation conducting the survey.
---
Well tyde has basically stopped putting out dbd videos since deathgarden re-launched so we're pretty much done needing to discuss him anymore
---
They should get a 15 minute penalty, it worked for ubisoft games and making no one really quit
---
Yes
---
I see what you did there.
---
I thought I was just pressing the button to late!
---
\*toxic survivor noises\*
---
Looks like his connection hiccuped. There was also an issue that was supposed to be fixed where some killer actions force everyone to DC, though I'll admit it's a bit late in the game for it to be hitting for this clip.
---
Yep. Again. For the 2nd night in a row when I was able to play.
---
That was actually completely by accident but I‚Äôll take it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Doubt it.
---
For real! Been ridiculous for the past few weeks. Lost rank cuz of it, bloodpoints, offerings and other shit
---
It was definitely an odd kind of thing to happen, funny either way
---
Does almost nothing for unhooking yourself. Lol don‚Äôt know why survivors try this
---
I saw one more post abouy this. Time to change exhaustion perk for the moment.

Ahhh thank you. I don‚Äôt know that meme at fucking all so this is where it‚Äôs losing me.
---
You're right. They're usually about 30 and just never figured out how to be well-adjusted socially. It's a crying shame.
---
If we did that then Console Players linking over to PC have Of Flesh And Mud, And Spark of Madness Free.
---
They depip and get zero bloodpoints, also there is literally a "leave" button right there when you open the menu and you still get to spectate and chat, so it's not like you're cheating by forcing the program to close.
---
I do understand your frustration though, especially considering the long killer queues. That said, I hardly ever have anyone DC on me in the beginning of the game  as killer (but I'm not that high in rank). If you don't mind me being so direct, if this is literally happening every single time I feel like the problem may be slightly on your end too...? Are you constantly running Moris with Hex: Ruin and Nurse of something?
---
Is that why thwy call it a 'slash'er?
---
Git gud
---
Love the ash
---
Wraith too, he pretty much has no anti loop as well as getting cucked by flashlights each game so he doesn‚Äôt get his sprint burst.. only way to really win chases is mind games which no good survivor will fall for :‚Äô((
---
*When Michael Myers forgets how to do the classic head tilt.*
---
He said good day, not bad day.
---
That‚Äôs good To hear. Lol. I didn‚Äôt watch shit the first few months I played, like most players im sure, but after watching similar things it made a lot of sense that urban was a fuck all perk of used in such a way. Same for self care. It‚Äôs useful as hell but a lot of people would rather heal themselves than do anything else that‚Äôs possibly a better use of their time.
---
I‚Äôve literally had survivors disconnect simply because I hook them. I beat their loop with a mind game and they disconnect. I‚Äôm literally just using a new perk trapper because I prestiged him.
---
IM SICK OF DAILY RITUALS BEING LIMITED TO ONE A DAY AND THR  HAVE THE SHEER AUDACITY TO MAKE IT A 20 SAB 2 HOOKS AFTER REJECTING A 25L HEALING BIT.
---
Reading all these comments makes me question everything in life
---
Like for siege? Thing is DBD is a casual game (relative to CA:GO or playing ranked in RB6:Siege). 
---
Seems a little rough. If it's two guys playing and one of them dies I could see the other wanting to leave so they can get in a new match. It's an asshole move but it's not like this is a highly competitive esports game , people should be allowed to do what they find most fun
---
"YOURE IN MY SCHOOL NOW"
---
I‚Äôm not sure honestly, I‚Äôm just using a new trapper because I prestiged him. At this point I just wanna play. SWF groups all dc if one person leaves too.
---
[removed]
---
why comment if you don't even know bro
---
The official website also takes reports, but I believe they're primarily set up for PC issues. No harm in looking into it if you have clips or anything, though.
---
Not just ranked, any match in any ubisoft competitve game, whether its for honor or rainbow, it greatly reduces dcs, and in this game teammates are very important towards winning
---
That'd just make killer queues even longer.
---
For a little bit, it would actually end up decreasing queue times due to people no longer wanting to quit but considering they want to quit they will instead kill themselves
---
I didn‚Äôt think about an internet issue, usually happens after they screw up tho. I‚Äôm using WiFi at the moment. Do survivors still keep their items if they yank their Ethernet?
---
It's pretty brave to be that aggressively wrong and still insist you're right.

And exactly how is that better?

I would actually recommend if demographics are your goal to have a bunch of fluff questions in the beginning and sneak the demographic questions in at the end. People tend to answer questions differently when it's up in their face like that.

---
I bought it last time it was in but I only just got it.
---
You can only get a grab if the survivor is injured.
---
You fell for it fool!
---
Damn really? Guessing excluding off gens, never noticed that
---
It may be confirmation bias but in my experience this game actually has more women playing it than most PvP video games. I'd be interested in seeing if there is truth to that

Interesting, thanks! I‚Äôve never made a survey before.

This is a callout comment for the people who complain on reddit that a certain character should be nerfed just because they killed them

Oh I'm sorry, I thought I would ask which show because I dont get the reference. So sorry
---
This surely cant be every trial, right? I dont think I've ever come across this problem.
---
Too many people sleeping on snares. You can spam those bitches at loops to create an infinite field of slowing. It's pretty good tbh.
---
You probably didn‚Äòt actually lose a pip. I noticed it sometimes shows -1 on that score screen but you keep your pip once you go back to the main menu, so it works correctly in my experience.
---
Same
---
This was one of my inspirations for making this survey, actually! Great point.
---
Confirmed
---
blessed comment
---
It comes from your mouse clicking 'off screen' because the fullscreen in this game evidently isn't true fullscreen.  There is a way to fix it that disables mouse sensitivity scaling or something like that in Steam.  I can't remember exactly what I had to do but it did solve the mouse thing, but at the cost of losing a shitload of FPS for some reason.  I used to play on high but had to go down to low to get the same fps.  Feels bad, but not as bad as missing a click at a crucial moment.  If you search 'mouse clicks not registering in DBD' IN Google you will find the fix.
---
You don‚Äôt see Micheal teleporting?
---
i bring a badham offerings with devour hope just for this hex placement
---
Just checked, my pipe actually did get saved do Nice! ü§ô
---
What does this even mean
---
Its due latency issues caused and the perk itselfs sucks thats why i am using balanced landing  . But u should use it to increase the life span of the loop cause deadharding in the open or into walls is like disarming a trap just to instantly step into a second trap .
---
Agreed. Just now I was in a match against a Squadette. They must've been SWF because one of them had OoO and another DC-d soon after the match started. It was downhill for them from there. Then when I asked why in the post-match chat, they said "nobody likes freddie" (their spelling). Survivors shouldn't be able to rob the killer of a match just because they don't like the killer the opposing player chose. They don't get to choose stuff in the match like that.
---
Can't see that Ace in the hole, Plunderers instinct, Pharmacy crate in time to get that medkit
---
Survivors are 100% move speed while running which is 4.0 m/s I think? Clown gas and Freddy snares are both a 15% slow so 85% move speed, what ever that maths into.
---
You don't make reads with Nurse unless you're on Lery's where you're forced to.

Nurse should use her first blink to land where the survivor breaks line of sight then wait to see how the survivor reacts. If they double back, a hit. If they kept running, use the 2nd blink to catch them. Nurse is easy to get down. 
---
The real challenge for Nurse is playing with one blink only with penalties to her blinks.
---
Omega blink and extra blinks just make her a bullshit killer.
---
What are you supposed to do against him?
---
Why did I think this was another old town road remix
---
*SNIIIIIFFFFF*
---
Didnt knew this thx for the tip ^_^
---
Really don't think this game would work with two killers
---
... You realize your post itself is insubstantial, right?

Just insulting people and making claims without any proof of evidence.

DOSNT GIVE A EXCUSE TO TUNNEL SOMEONE WHO WASN‚ÄôT EVEN BEING TOXIC! IF I WAS THEN SURE I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME! SO DONT BE A FUCKING ASSHOLE TO SOMEONE IF THEY ARE PLAYING CHILL! FUCKING PLEB

Is it that easy to just add a communications element that was entirely missing before?

Call of Duty is going to have more young straight males compared to Overwatch which has more females and non-binary people

NO NETWORK GLITCH FOR THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS!!!!!!

GLITCH WHERE MY CHARACTER FROZE AT THE GENERATOR. WHEN THE PROMPTS APPEAR, I MAKE NO PROGRESS. I CAN‚ÄôT MOVE AWAY FROM THE GEN, KILLER GETS ME!!!

So away we go.

Press X to daubt
---
Freddy is fun as fuck to play with, do not nerf him.
---
Base survivor run speed is 100%, base killer move speed is 115%, so at base, killers are 15% faster than survivors.
---
Clown and Freddy's hindered effect from their powers is a 15% debuff to runspeed, Freddy's lasting however long they are in the trap+ 3~ seconds after they leave it. Clown's is however long they are in the gas for + 2 seconds after they leave it.
---
So when affected by Clown or Freddy's hindered, the killer becomes 30% faster than the survivor. This is the equivalent of obtaining bloodlust tier 3.

I ALSO HAD THIS. CLEANED MY PS4 OUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND IT STOPPED. TONIGHT, THE FAN SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO SHOOT OUT THE PLAYSTATION.
---
ONLY IN DBD THOUGH
---
Haven‚Äôt seen anyone ask for his nerf tbh but you did say you‚Äôll start
---
Pig and Clown
---
No we must buy the special edition for 30 ‚Ç¨ and if i am right the special got the 2 dlc too
---
The strength of dream pallets is that Survivors will tend to drop pallets early against you. But as people learn how to counter it they'll become weaker.
---
Dream pallets are definitely Freddy's "noob stomper" option, while dream snares are more consistently useful.
---
Happens on PS4 as well
---
NOT FROM A JEDI... OH SORRY, WRONG SUB
---
No mouse is not without any adapter usable
---
IF IM TEABAGGING NEXT TO YOU AS QUENTIN WHEN YOUR OPENING THE GATES THAT MEANS I HAVE WAKE UP AND CAN OPEN THEM FASTER GODDAMMIT.
---
I was asking to go further into detail because I initially didn‚Äôt understand what you were saying but I managed to ‚Äúdecrypt‚Äù it. So the killer just leaves before you have a chance to back out to the main menu after you‚Äôve escaped?
---
Well shit.
---
90% of the players are potatoes.
---
The slow is 15% for 3+ seconds. At that moment you become 30% faster than the survivor, it's the equivalent of reaching bloodlust 3.
---
If  he leaves before u can leave through the gate it happens . Sry for my bad english though .
---
This was posted 2 months ago. 
---
Also thank the Lord maybe he figured out the stuff he advocated for was batshit fucking stupid and decided to make a quiet exit
---
In game hint at the next chapter?
---
Actually, I'll go a step further, I just can't stand the DC mindset at all. I can be getting out played on my killer and I'll still play it out. F-it, still gonna get some points at least and learn from the mistakes. Same from survivor side.
---
I WAS ALLOWING A MEG TO GET THE HATCH AFTER HER THREE TEAMMATES DIED ASAP.
---
INSTEAD SHE ASKED ME TO FOLLOW AND TRIED FARMING ME BY DROPPING A PALLET ON ME.
---
SO I FARMED TOO BY CLOSING THE HATCH.
---
It‚Äôs a map marker
---
They go on shipping ships shipping shipping ships.
---
Well not everybody thinks like u
---
What's that do?
---
It‚Äôs supposed to let the map holder mark important objectives (hatch) for everyone to see
---
Exactly! I‚Äôm tired of killers having to play to survivors rules.
---
The map marker? It‚Äôs an add-on for the map that allows the map to leave a mark for survivors anywhere (usually for hatch, exit gates, etc).
---
Legion is C tier huh? Excuse me while I pull out my sloppy butcher, thanataphobia, third seal, and Franklin's Demise perks.
---
Doge Doge Dogedoge
---
Yeah... give the killers more of a God complex...
---
Ohh I was so confused. I don't play much survivor and i don't use maps so i had no idea.
---
Yah I don‚Äôt run self-care and haven‚Äôt for like a month (I‚Äôve been playing for 2 and a half) and it‚Äôs honestly way better at high ranks to ru borrowed time. My setup is: borrowed, ds, dead hard or balanced landing, and adrenaline. I know it‚Äôs like the most meta build known to man.
---
3.4 m/s
---
Heck yeah, preach!
---
Snares actually take skill to use. That's why some people think pallets are stronger.
---
Bouncy
---
It doesn't do anything anyway
---
Or SWF
---
Yeah I seen some of the start of the live stream for the q&amp;a then I had to get back to work. Looks cool. I never got to see the dream pallets in the match I was in. Dude I was going against just used the snares and I made him look like an even bigger joke before the buff. Like you said, discount clown and like i said, with some half assed hag mixed in. At least I can avoid the blood or trip it out of chase which makes the shit completely pointless. 
---
"The killer is on me" 
---
k gonna go run through all these stupid puddles and clear my loops then get back on that gen. Even if you're not playing swf, most people run some kind of obsession perk. Just wait till the obsession is being chased and fuck his traps up.
---
Oh okay. I‚Äôve been playing close to the launch not right at it though. And bro we are dead hard balance landing buddies lmao yeet I should run borrowed time but I like bond too much. It helps me a lot with awareness.
---
They do double BP events throughout the year independent of bigger events like Summer or Halloween. They're saying they aren't doing a summer event like the barbecue. That doesn't mean we're not getting any double BP again. Why even assume that?
---
IS THAT A FUCKING LOWERCASE LETTER?
---
I mean, it's not that bad, I guess. There's... There's Whispers... And.... Uh... Okay yeah it's pretty hard to make out.
---
Headsets are the real OP killer perk. I never play without one.
---
Dedicated servers would prob fix it
---
A good way to counter the fake pallets is to throw down all of the real pallets in the beginning of the trial. this way you‚Äôll know for sure if hes set the trap!
---
I will literally give someone gold if they draw a good Ghostface downing Ace with a shopping kart from S-mart, IN the Ghostface trailer store
---
Yep. I don't like yelling.
---
"Success, so clearly in view. Or is it merely a trick of the light?"
---
That was fairly amusing. I honestly don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt just have the option of multiple killers in private kyf lobbies.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest. This is the dumbest statement I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. I really hope you‚Äôre trolling or being sarcastic.
---
They are once dedicated servers come out they will get a little time out the more they do it the longer the time out and when they stop the timer goes down
---
Yeah, I don't get it. We get one pretty consistently about every 3 months, but it always seems like only a few weeks after a double BP event people are already complaining about when the next one will be. Memory of a lemming...
---
If you have a problem with noed and the killers that use it, cleanse totems
---
Killers have been recommending that Survivors get new gameplay mechanics for fucking ages now.  Too many Survivors and BHVR employees don't want to upset the status quo.
---
Not what I was implying at all, sadly.

That is old legion luckily

All the maps are very different but in subtle ways. Some are cornfields, some junkyard-like, others being a forest. The best map(to me) is Blackwater swamp, just because of the tug boat and the gen which 100% spawns there.

Even if she was 15, which according to devs, isn't. what is the difference? it is a fictional character.

Thanks for the criticism.

I usually make portraits, so my environmental lighting lacks in a lot of ways. I've left out fill lighting in favor of more dramatic lights, which was what this comic needed in retrospect.  
---
The blurred text is intentionally hard to be read to blend into the panic of the last two panels. The legibility was sacrificed for the humor of the situation and depends on readers still noticing it because of the positional consistency of the text from previous panels.  
---
I appreciate the criticism no matter your background, everyone has insight into something. This stuff I will definitely take into consideration into the future.
---
It‚Äôs not lol they‚Äôre just not doing it correctly or the ghostface has addons to reduce detection range.

i looked on steam and it does not look like the special on steam came with any killers free at least it does not say it does

Exactly. It‚Äôs not ranked and doesn‚Äôt count for points. So we should be able to have multiple killers just for fun in kyf.

It would be at that moment that I turn off my PS4 trying to process wtf just happened üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I played with the coolest Bill the other day. Dude was running Deliverance, Unbreakable, and Borrowed Time. Three of us got hooked in the basement (potatos, we are) and this guy unhooks himself, unhooks us with BT, and takes the first hit from GF heading up the stairs. GF slugged him to keep chasing us but we both got away thanks to BT. Bill gets himself up and we all completely recover to get the last gen done. Then Bill nobly sacrifices to body block for an exposed Survivor while we open and run out the door.   
---
I would be pissed if I were that Killer, but I'll never forget that beautiful Bill.
---
The devs might, which is the problem.
---
Isn't that John?
---
Does it have to be good?
---
It happened to me too. I haven't actually been able to stop the glitch, but I just restarted my game. But if you can't wiggle you can't escape. When it happened to me, the exit gate was next to me wide open, and I was on hook. I 4 percented and ran to the gate, but I couldn't escape. It really do feel bad. üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Ya I know, it's just a game though, just think cutting out cause of "losing" is dumb. If I expected to win every time what would be the fun or thrill of playing anything hahaha!
---
but but my strategy /s
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
&gt; activating 2x BP for a week is clearly a drain on all the precious manpower they could've allocated to breaking more shit in the game instead.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Oh, I see, you were implying something else by this.
---
OK IM SORRY
---
HAPPENS TO ME A LOT! üò°
---
Double Nurse would be absolutely oppressive to play against, but imagine a combo like Wraith and LF. Fleeing the bing bong just to run straight into a chainsaw. Or Hag traps around Jigsaw Boxes. Or even Doc and Plague for status effect hell
---
I couldn't even start a match all day, just kept getting errors.
---
You still can, but it is pretty much useless right now.
---
In the past you had to hit them 3 times, and for using feral frenzy your power bar didn't had to be complete, so it was viable. But right now, if I'm not mistaken it takes 5 hits, and you have to wait till your power is full again. SO it's easier to just try to go with the normal attack.
---
I'm surprised no one has mentioned toxic teammates which are like 50/50. I would be absolutely terrified to even talk in fear of being talked downed to.
---
You should check out the forums. They‚Äôre full of Scrubvivors complaining that Freddy is OP.
---
Oh, so that's what the marker looks like. I was wondering if the nurse was going to teleport over to look at it too lol.
---
No, it's usable until you lose map charges. You can just spam the light everywhere as you run along.
---
Truth, I'd rather get an extra couple hundred bp from a hit or some shocks at the exit than DC just because.
---
But he's right though
---
He is trying to lean out like ghostface.
---
He's got an idea.
---
Sounds like someone hasn‚Äôt looked at the forums.
---
I don‚Äôt think its  for 3+ seconds I need some proof of that

I believe people watermark memes to make karma farmers have to do work to repost it.
---
Well the effect would down you, but if you get rid of the effect it will heal you, if you get an unlucky locker you will go from having the timer be 1:20 (decreases with addons) to it going 3x faster (quicker with addons)
---
Hmmmm
---
Do you want my opinion on this list?
---
MEG IS JUST GOING TO KEEP FAILING THE CHECK IF SHE DOESN'T LEAVE.  EVERYONE IS BETTER OFF IF SHE JUST RUNS AROUND THE MAP AIMLESSLY.

WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Yeah but as someone who plays survivor and killer I think his traps should be less visible

Why would you think that?

that really how it be sometime

Everyone loves their sweet karma. Honestly o haven‚Äôt faced Freddy yet!!!, but I think he deserves to shine a bit.

Counting is not a good strategy, but it is a strategy, and a combatible one at that.

Message brought to you by nerf gang - freddy is op
---
Which rituals? I know in the past some have gotten bugged and just been impossible to complete.
---
Hahahahahahahhahahhaha this is so accurate jesus
---
I mean, all it will show is the rituals i have. It was escape with david king and escape with a new item, which i did but it didnt count?
---
Brock?
---
Escape with an item and escape as david king
---
Not til they nerf pig   
---
She op af rn, almost as strong as Wraith or Cannibal
---
Considering it was sarcasm, yes.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=merSR-CNzRg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=merSR-CNzRg) 
---
This is what Billy needs. THRASHGRASS
---
Are you positive you grabbed a new item from the trial, or did you just escape with the item that you brought in? Also escaping through hatch does NOT count for this ritual if I recall.
---
I found a key if i recall and it was a normal escape...
---
I run shadowborn on mine fire the FOV increase
---
Hm, weird. If I or one of my friends get one of those rituals I'll see if we run into the same problem
---
Encourages people to waste lots of time self caring instead of touching gens.  I run Empathy sometimes and will just watch the same players spend damn near the entire match healing contributing next to nothing towards the groups objectives.  Drags out games and gets teamates killed in the long run fairly commonly.
---
they dont do kids in DBD
---
I absolutely love it.   
---
Being able to mind game was always a strong part of Freddy, but now the gen teleport, fake pallets, and sneaky snares gives you a huge play on survivors who get too cocky. It makes survivors just DROP pallets in front of you to avoid the ghost pallets!  
---
I like the old Freddy a lot, but I will be the first to say that playing him could be legitimately infuriating. This Freddy? It's more relaxed, but still gives you enough to do and focus on. What gen do I teleport too? Do I teleport or try to mind game them? Etc.  
---
That combined with the paranoia you give survivors, seeing them all go to sleep and being able to teleport faster is a literal DREAM (bu dum tsst).   
---
He may not be original or unique, but I have only gotten 1 Entity displeased so far, and about 7 Merciless Killers. I LOVE the new Freddy.   
---
(Although his addons could be buffed a bit, i'd say focus on buffing other characters first. Pig, Wraith, and Cannibal namely.)
---
Maybe Hopper? Or the Wills mom?
---
How
---
Welcome! People will crap on you for this just fyi because it's talked about a lot but I don't mind.
---
I'd love if Demigorgon were a killer. It's hard to think of a unique power though.
---
As for survivor I don't think it'd be Will because there are no minors in this game. My personal choice would be Steve but Joyce would be nice too.
---
what are you on about?
---
No. Steve
---
You pulling a fellow survivor off the hook in front of the killer and having them get knocked down is pretty toxic and I would have been very upset if that was me. Especially if it was my first hook and now I‚Äôm instantly in struggle mode because you unhooked me too soon so you could get away
---
Thanks for the heads up! And yeah Hopper would be cool, Billy too. And yeah that was my struggle was thinking about a specific power other than having that sleep thing like Freddy
---
I would rather have two hooked survivors especially so close together (if the killer isn‚Äôt a camper). It‚Äôs a team game so don‚Äôt sacrifice other players so you can get away.
---
I love the way he apologized üòÇ
---
STONKS
---
No
---
I was high making this post lol, but I rather him joining the roster of DBD than a single game. look at Friday the 13th for example
---
You can do it. I‚Äôve done it once when I used Frank‚Äôs + Stab Wounds Study.
---
This is me 
---
I do this...
---
I'm not sorry
---
That‚Äôs not a team player, two hooked survivors then one? And a nurse by the time someone got down there to unhook two most definitely someone else is going down before the second is unhooked
---
Just spitballing some ideas:
---
Mid/Late-game (optional) objective - With the Toolbox or Saboteur perk, you can interact with an exit gate switch. After 20s of base cumulative interaction time, the switch is ‚Äúsabotaged‚Äù,  will no longer make the klaxon sound, and the lights will stay dark.
---
Late game (optional) objective - During the Endgame Collapse, a few ‚ÄúShattered Realm Fragments‚Äù pop up around the map. Interacting with them as a survivor lets you pick up an iridescent fragment item. Escaping with it will grant you some Iridescent Shards (or just bonus blood points)
---
Getting hit by the Killer causes you to drop the fragment, like a built in franklins demise. All dropped Fragments at the end of the match give the Killer Iridescent Shards (or blood points), but a lesser amount.
---
I GOT TODAY A LAG-SWITCHING CLOWN. I FEEL YOUR PAIN. I HOPE THEY DO SOMETHING.
---
I think that would be more of a QoL change than making the experience more unique.
---
The template doesn‚Äôt quite work with dbd‚Äôs gate system but it is still Shirtless Myers.
---
Not if it means survivors have to run right up to them just to check and thus away from a safe pallet
---
...how?
---
YEAH... I FINALLY BROKE INTO THE YELLOW RANKS... HOLY SHIT, WHAT IS UP WITH ALL THESE SURVIVORS WHO CAN'T HEAL FOR SHIT OR UNHOOK OTHERS.
---
Pretty gay man
---
Cool.
---
BRUH... SAME. I'VE RUN AWAY FROM KILLERS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, ONLY TO BE BACK AND DOWN BY THEM. THE INVISIBLE SKILL-CHECKS, OR SELF-CARE/GEN BAR NOT GOING UP OR WORKING. THIS PATCH HAS BEEN HELL.
---
I wish more people played that way
---
Definitely not. Exhaustion perks should be usable once per chase and that's it.
---
Was just playing as Spirit, right when I was going to get my last hook it dc'd. Try to start a match as Pig, same thing before the match even started. What's up with PS4 getting hit with so many bugs lately? First no Bill and now this is happening again.
---
I stopped watching the show once they started giving the jack offs the good guy edits. Fuck the racists and fuck H8tful.
---
i dont agree, i loved play the Pig as killer and fight against her as survivor, the feeling that you are the only survivor with a trap in your head and your friends are out calling you and you still had to disable the trap before escape, was epic, and when you managed to escape you proved to your friends and yourself to be very good with skillchecks and a deserved winner of the match, still for crybabys you could always use the hatch, everything was perfect, as killer you had that feeling of control and also the chance to be more playfull and let them run around while you check engines, and as survivor was freaking epic, the fear feeling was like be in a real Saw movie. Now with the new nerfs survivos can escape even with a trap in their head, notice the nonsense this traps cant be deactivated withouth play the pig game and its totally absurd that you can escape with a bear trap in your head that have a few seconds timer, and you escape through the door like....well i m going sleep maybe tomorrow i take out this trap of my head. It destroy the epic feeling for the survivors, it destroys the fear to the time run out, and force the pig to stop be playful and have fun with survivors pushing her to accept she will only will kill 1 or 2 suvivors by heavy camp the hooks, and let the other 2 escape through the door, and if camp the hooks its a must now, then why you even waste your time putting traps in their head ??, this traps dosnt even act like in the movies, and now it dosnt even work like a real mechanical trap would do, lol magically the timer stop when the killer its close ?? what?? the timer activation dosnt get activated..what?? how that mechanism even work lol its seems more a trap made by Harry Potter than a killer, ruinning the inmersion for the killer and the fun danger feeling of fight against the clock on survivors. It was probably the killer power more close to the movies and they destroyed it, now survivors do you teabag with a bear trap in the head withouth fear the the trap kills they at the end of the game.
---
About what you said that was OP thats just a plain lie since pig was always just a mid Tier killer, the traps are more easy to take out than wake up from Freddys dream, just few fun skillchecks, and trap out, it wasnt anything OP, even Ruin its more OP than the PIG main weapon since fail the skill check breaks the engines wich is the main target of survivors.
---
There is not such a thing like " shit storm of pigs saving all their traps for end-game " the pig only have 4 traps, using them on the begunning or the end have diferent risks, if you use your traps at the end some survivors could escape and the last could use the hatch withouth even take out the trap, using them too early means they will easily take the traps out and your killer lose his main weapon for the rest of the game. The Pig was also an old killer with not the best future at high ranks so no one was going to switch to it just cuz you maybe can do 1 kill at the end of the game if a noob tryed run through the exit with a trap in his head.
---
Its not justifified as i explainned yet, she wasnt even a high Tier killer, what they did to the pig its like make the Huntress always run out of axes if the doors are open, or like make Michael Mayers get blind and cant stalk when doors get open, or lol imagine ppl that fall in one of the traps of the trapper get magically healed and all your traps dissapear.
---
Today 3 survivors escaped to me with a trap in their head, they ofc stopped in the exit with thier traps in the head to do some tea bags, in the aftermatch chat they said sorry and feel bad for me and what Devs did to the pig, since one of the survivors was also main Pig killer he told me to dont play it again, and thats what i m going to do, RIP the pig for me, useless killer.
---
i m not against end game collapse, its true loved long matchs but i m fine with the actual fast games with minimun trolling time for survivors, my problem its how useless its the Pig now and how they force us now to play like a camper tard and even forget about use the useless traps wich remember are the main weapon of this killer, i m also against magical Harry Potter devices that dosnt fits to the Saw franchise and not even an engeneer would be able to explain how this traps get constantly activated or deactivated and clock timers that just dont count the time, why you even put a timer on them if it dosnt activate to kill the survivor ?? no matter how you put this thats an absolute nonsense, if you put this on the Saw movies they would need rename the franchise to Scary Movie and invite Ghost face to it to make some laughs toguethers lol
---
its not like: "holy shit I have 3 minutes to go running around the entire map and then get back to the exit gate in time". But more like "WTF this surviors wear a bear trap in their head with a timer that will make explode their head, and they dont even botter on try take it out their head, lol THEY SURVIVED WITH THAT BOMB ATTACHED TO THEIR HEADS BY A BEAR TRAP HOLLY MOLLY !!! wtf its happenning here, i should had buy simple traps like the trapper ones, atleast that traps actually trap someone"
---
PS: i m not killer or survivor, i own all survivors and killers of the game, even the DLCs and i play survivor when i m with my friends and killer when i m alone so plz dont get me in that political Bias of Survivors VS killer.
---
Zubat streams survivor too
---
100% agree with you...I never said that wasn‚Äôt the case.

Maybe over time it'll be clear which is better but I actually like at the moment that it's preference over meta, means the killer is viable in more than one way (:
---
He is really great! I like that he's been the most consistent member on the streams.
---
Big props, for real. At the end of the day it‚Äôs a game and should be fun. I‚Äôm sure that killers get tired of annoying bt saves and other shenanigans right in front of killer, sometimes I think they assume it‚Äôs a swf and think I‚Äôm complicit but I hate getting punished for my teammates farming me. I wish there was a button to reject saves haha.
---
I can only vouch for Freddy, but with his new kit, Pop Goes the Weasel, Barbecue and Chili, and Surveillance are your best bet. The last slot is a flavor perk of your choice. I'd suggest Discordance, but I personally go with Save the Best for Last.
---
When I‚Äôm playing against Freddy as a survivor and if I‚Äôm not in chase I throw any dream pallets I know are traps so my teammates won‚Äôt fall for them
---
The snares are fine people just need to leern how to use them properly
---
I'm a serial killer I kill bad guy when will i get to be dead daylight
---
Then you‚Äôll just get people throwing the game by getting hit on purpose to recover from the downed state... I don‚Äôt want people playing just to farm perk dailies
---
she honestly just seems to be giving you advice
---
Don't touch our glorious Freddy. I love him as he is with this rework. Balanced and I have no issues versing him.
---
as other people have commented I'd appreciate double bloodpoints
---
You‚Äôre right... thank you
---
Normally I hate unnecessary crafting systems in games, but yeah if we've all got 100+ something add-ons we'll never use then at least give us some way to make them worth it
---
Machine gun Doc where?
---
How do I get BBQ and chili I‚Äôve heard so much about it but never been sure how to get it?
---
Can u explain?

When the survivors keep tea bagging me behind pallets
---
Fuck off
---
I do think a small nerf to pallets is fine, maybe just have like 6 or 7 instead. Wont hurt him too much, but it will make pallets need more skill from Freddy.
---
I wish that DC‚Äôs in general should be a lot more punished I mean like temp bans.

Hopefully a part of that is making his base shock range longer than the basic two inches it is now
---
Yea she game more good advice too I thought it was funny cause she ran into me when I was attacking in a corn maze
---
incoming triggered killer mains
---
The problem is survivoes don't want changes, they want it to be easy
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äústrictly better‚Äù as both do different things and they do it good. 
---
The snare cuts many paths and loops slow and you still got 2 addon slots while the pallets can create paths that aren‚Äôt real
---
YEAH.  YOU'VE GOTTA LET THEM PLAY LIKE POTATOES SOMETIMES.  IF THEY'RE POTATOES, JUST LOOK FOR THE HATCH AND DO AS MANY TOTEMS AS YOU CAN.
---
SOMETIMES YOU CAN PULL A POTATO OFF THE HOOK LONG ENOUGH TO BE KILLER BAIT WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE HATCH.
---
IT'S KINDA FUCKED UP TO DO, BUT WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS WHEN YOUR TEAMMATES ARE BASICALLY KILLING THEMSELVES?
---
that would be the biggest mistake they could make lol
---
says the bloody nea
---
I thought so at first but I feel like I‚Äôm getting used to him. I think I lost my first 4 games in a row to new Freddy but I finally snagged a few wins. What seems to work for me is to completely ignore waking up. I think he is certainly very powerful but the community takes some time to adapt and it‚Äôs early. That being said I do think that he would be fine with 2 out of 3 of: gen teleporting, snares/pallets, the new sleep changes.
---
Arguably upper-middle tier, so yeah rank 5 and below he will be called OP because the killer called **THE NIGHTMARE** has good presence and oppression abilities.
---
Nah they definitely need a slightly larger range. Or at least make that one of the add ons, you can‚Äôt deny those suck. All the blocks are trash and they used to be the best
---
Oh yeah that reminds me, today the game didn't even let me log in. Yeah that happened.
---
You have to get Leatherface to level 35 and unlock the teachable version in his bloodweb. It's worth it though. BBQ is one of the best tracking perks in the game, plus it can increase the mount of bloodpoints you get per game up to 100%. It fits on nearly every build and it makes grinding for other perks and add-ons significantly easier.
---
You have to unlock the Leatherface DLC either by buying him with real money or saving up 9000 shards (the ones you get from leveling up). Then, once you get Leatherface to level 35, BBQ and Chili will appear as an orange perk in his bloodweb. Buying this orange "teachable" perk will unlock it so that it has a chance to show up in all your other killers' bloodwebs.
---
Note that if you skip buying a teachable it will show up in every bloodweb for that killer until you unlock it. So if you want to level Leatherface to 50 but you don't want, say, Knock Out to show up in all your other bloodwebs feel free to just skip unlocking it. Then, months later if you decide you want to run a slug build you can just quickly pop back to Bubba's bloodweb and unlock it. This will save you a TON of points later on because you will only have good perks in your bloodwebs and won't have to waste levels getting crappy perks. The downside is (since each bloodweb can only give you a max of 2 perks) you have less perks available in your leatherface bloodweb.
---
Yeah that seems like BM
---
I'd say either let them farm or don't, or at least let them farm a little longer before you murder them so they get some BP. Seems rude to hold the game hostage just to mess with them when you could be moving on to a new game and everyone could be getting more BP
---
But I mean it's whatever, least they got a little more bloodpoints than the alternative
---
That, and literally anything that helps survivors immediately gets nerfed
---
That is fairly close to what I have been running and finding success with. The only change is I have been running Fertive Chase instead of tremors. Tremors is ok though Fertive works betier in my experience. If you can build it up basically you have almost no terror radius at all and lord does that mess with survivors. I have traded out overcharge for ruin but it really didn't I didn't like it too much. With over charge and survelience I can easily control gens and make it easy to corral survivors to where I want on the map
---
Reading this was confusing to me not cause it was bad I‚Äôm just super new lol
---
Disconnecting is straight up not smart in my opinion. You don‚Äôt get any points for the work you did before you left, so what‚Äôs the point, If your getting tunneling and the killer is camping you and ruining the fun in your game, I can understand it then. But disconnecting for no reason is annoying. It hurts everyone in the game.
---
Come to console bro. Even in rank 18 you play against rank 12 in every match
---
Pretty sure I bought boil over instead of BBQ when I was a new player, because I played SWF and thought it boosted wiggle speed.
---
[Mildly accurate.](https://youtu.be/BLrXahz7ZxE?t=44s)
---
Headphones have really helped me lol injure someone then track them with sound I‚Äôve hit rank 3 with her and love it
---
You do know you can use Dead Hard in a way where the killer can‚Äôt counter it right?
---
Yes.
---
Get a good pair of head phones and learn how to listen.
---
He's the scariest one to me.  He'll just be standing right behind me, silently staring.
---
Nevermind you're right. It went down and then back up and since pips are always fucky I couldn't tell
---
Lmfao upvote this man ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
---
I can't tell if you are joking or not because of the name, but...
---
I like using a format that I made. Wow who would have thought?
---
I don't think Freddy or Ghostface are OP in any way.
---
Remember this well: ALWAYS use your power in a chase. Other than that just have good hearing. Spirit isn‚Äôt difficult when you got those two things nailed down
---
I hate it when survivors disconnect I have disconnected a couple time mainly when a killer tunnels and facecamps me but when I survivor disconnects just because they got downed or hit due to their mistakes that's when I'm not good with it
---
you seems fail to notice that place that traps its an incredible waste of time for the killer, same than ppl said Freddy its the worst killer cuz needed make survivor sleep before kill them, have to trap them its also a waste of time, not to mention if they succes the minigame they basically disabled the main power of the killer cuz she dont have traps to do this more than 1 time for each survivor, its like be Freddy and have only 4 chances to sleep the survivor lol
---
With the actual Nerfs its better dont use the traps, and just hook the survivors and then camp the hook, the traps dont even keep them away from engines since the timer stop when you are close, wich means survivors can safely do a engine with a trap in their head if they are inside your terror radious, and if they can escape through the door with the trap in their head, this mean the one who wasted your time its the killer and that traps actually was keeping the killer away from camp/hook the survivors wichs seems to be the new playstyle they want force on the Pig.
---
But that's what I'm saying. People complained GF was OP when he came out and wanted a nerf within the week. No patience.
---
From my favorite film, ‚ÄúBad Dream on Oak Road‚Äù
---
I'm just confused on how he works like is he meant to always appear out of the dream world or not?
---
how about
---
"the possibly upcoming game voice chat shouldn't be upcoming god please no please I wont be toxic ever again"
---
Oh damn.
---
Is it still effective or is it trash?
---
Not sure why you would think that, and if it were like that, somehow think 75% would be a balanced amount.
---
AU stands for Alternate Universe
---
Good thing that Trapper is into that sort of thing
---
Back to the drawing board lol
---
Someone needs to take over the DBD IP because BHVR can‚Äôt handle it to be honest
---
For now I‚Äôm using surveillance, pop, bbq and spirit fury. I mostly chose surveillance and pop cause I don‚Äôt have a lot of good perks unlocked yet, but I‚Äôve found they synergize wonderfully with his power. Surveillance just seems to get better as the amount of gens on the map dwindles and makes it easy to figure out which gens to teleport to. 
---
Tremors and discordance are ones I‚Äôd consider replacing surveillance with, but I feel like smart survivors can figure out if you‚Äôre running discordance and then counter it pretty easily. That and I feel like if I‚Äôm damaging gens consistently enough, I‚Äôll probably get more use out of surveillance.
---
It's a bug, the devs are aware of it
---
Yea but most skins that aren‚Äôt just lazy recolors are expensive af.
---
Then all the gambling, scamming and whatnot? CS has the worst skin system to have ever existed.
---
Perfectionist should be 1.5%

You definitely added that

No dude it‚Äôs the add on called ‚ÄúCrystal Bead‚Äù. It goes on maps
---
Lmao damn my bad sorry
---
Get real jabroni
---
Well technically the survivors fall in and out of dream world.
---
Freddy's always in it.
---
They passively fall asleep over like a minute or getting hit and it seems like maybe chase too but that may just be the passive sleep in phase with me chasing someone.
---
True. Some people don't want jokes to die because they love them. It keeps the old jokes there for new-comers like me. I find the "Nea is a killer meme" pretty funny because I've only had the game for a month and I've never heard it before.
---

Ok yes I added it because of downvotes but I meant it was sarcasm when I first posted it. I was making fun of the guy above me who said ‚Äúwhy comment if you don‚Äôt even know?‚Äù

0.0001%, coincidentally that is also the percentage of me being sure that number is correct.

For me it's been about 5%. Pretty rare, most of them are just really lagging.
---
He's like.. 2/5 games right now
---
Not talking about strong shit.
---
Survivors are plenty strong. 
---
The problem is that the core gameplay loop for survivors is lame. Broken shit like Mettle of Man isn't going to fix that.
---
As someone with almost 7k hours of Dota 2, trust me, it can be way worse.

What does his traps even do?

Nah man, billy or a lucky leather daddy spawn gets it done in seconds not minutes.

Adding heat makes the soup hotter
---
Officially? Where?
---
Triathlete would be fine with just a cooldown,no need to block windows
---
Honestly I feel the same way. I get genned rushed because of swf and then they bm and send me messages saying I'm bad
---
It's okay not really worth trying to ambush only one player
---
This happened to me earlier against a clown with myc, I knew it was him but the noise instantly made me go "wait its ghostface?" like a damn fool
---
Then I lose two perk slots, and I don‚Äôt have room for those
---
Hmm no longer toxic
---
Not toxic or BM imo just playing for that 4K I never much care for these fake rules / hey that was toxic when your trying to 4K or just kill them
---
Search up the DbD wiki. I‚Äôm pretty sure each perk‚Äôs page lists past changes to it.

It's pretty good advice but that isn't tunnelling lol
---
It's not soft. I'm saying I have no desire to put myself through something I know I won't enjoy. Plenty of people think like me. I'm not too worried about how others might view my opinion on this. Besides, my lack of presence in the voice chats won't affect you.
---
Because people enjoy those memes because to them it‚Äôs funny.
---
What‚Äôs that add on?

You‚Äôre right. She‚Äôs the Entity.
---
But I will take your advice, I mean I‚Äôll give it a shot. Time to try out mad grit...
---
So be it
---
Nope, de-pip only takes away 1 pip.

If you DC you lose 2 pips (plus showing everyone you are a sore loser)
---
Sorry to bother you guys, especially since you probably get plenty of these.
---
With the newest update (haven't had a chance to read the patch notes due to work), what would be a good solo Survivor build? I tend to play more with randoms than SWF. If it helps, I'm absolutely awful at loops/jungle gyms.
---
Haha now THAT would be bad for me, I admit I'm a garbage survivor.
---
I‚Äôd say less than 0.01%
---
I mean, you could trivialize my intentions by saying "something you might not like". But that's not quite it. Lots of people say things I don't like. But my choice to avoid something that would benefit me in no way doesn't make me soft lol. But keep trying to paint me as a snowflake, I guess.
---
Snares are just budget clown.
---
They gotta change his snare add ons. Hemorrhage is not worth an add on.
---
I mean like the survivor will be hiding on the other side of a thin wall completely invisible to me and my auto aim will hijack my camera making me aware that someone is there when I shouldn't have known that
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
Nurse is OP but not in the hands of a noob.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to even try to body block an unsafe unhook, it‚Äôs honestly more of detriment for you to rip the guy off the hook because that‚Äôs two peoples time not spent on generators, but sure say it like that.
---
Trapper Robyn is terrifying oh god
---
Hehe dbd anniversary queen
---
I have gotten that a few times on ps4, but I actually get more ggs and positive interactions than negative.  Usually there aren't post game messages, but occasionally there's stuff like ggwp. Of course some people are always going to be salty, especially if they make a lot of mistakes and you don't go out of your way to give them that 5th or 6th extra chance.
---
I had someone say he looped me for 3 gens while I hard tunneled him, but by the time the 3rd gen popped I had already gotten 8 hooks, only 2 of which were him. 
---
Really though, even the people that start off trying to be toxic with insulting post game messages tend to come around and even apologize and be respectful if you treat them with respect and realize every one is just trying to have some fun at a video game.  
---
The negative messages are much more memorable than the 90+% of players that never message or only say positive things, but it's very far from it being most of the community that act like entitled brats. It just doesn't always feel that way.
---
Same issue, G502.
---
Looks like logitech and dbd are reacting weird. Might be specific to this series
---
Maybe just choose one or the other then, whichever you find more usually.
---
Let's be real this game definitely does have high skill cap but part of it is rock paper scissors between perks too. If you feel like you're always losing to rock might as well keep choosing paper
---
Way too early to say that I believe he's very strong but a lot of it is just cause it's new to survivors
---
That was terrifying
---
I just three gen on it, usually works fine
---
I‚Äôve played against him enough, about 85% matches now because how OP he is.
---
That‚Äôs all based on the assumption there is anything going on. Honestly one tweet doesn‚Äôt sound like much to go off of. Like I get people can draw conclusions from hype, but there‚Äôs no event happening.
---
May get it for the memes haha
---
It depends on why I lose. Plague just has huge design flaws. What is supposed to be the survivors' detriment (survivors being broken) is just optimal survivor play (not healing and doing gens).
---
No bubba and Clown :(
---
Pfff strong killers are toxic.
---
I remember Smite being pretty toxic on Xbox
---
Yeah you still get it. I got mine last week.
---
Ok buddy. Good talk.
---
Then you have a one shot killer for the rest of the match. What‚Äôs the problem with this?
---
I think the allegedly toxic part he is asking about is that he stalled the game rather than just killing them
---
Well I don't know how you typically sleep but I personally find veing hanged from the shoulder on a giant meathook makes it really uncomfortable to get to sleep. 
---
It's a leftover from how he used to function and I think it's fair to keep it that say, just chalk it up to anither case of the devs not being clear about mechanics... again.
---
Look up while using it for better results
---
Okay, I'll go back to nurse then. Is that what you want?
---
What's devotion?
---
He doesn't deserve a nerf but to be honest his reach is really off, it feels like he can hit u from a mile away, and his speed when attacking is really high to an extent where u can drop a pallet while his on the other side of the wall but he still hits you out of the blue.
---
Yeah, not all SWF want to play like seal team 6 and always communicate gameplay things to each other. A lot are just hanging out with friends and don't even talk about the game all that much during the match. Aura reading makes the information easy to convey quickly and can help coordination even if it could be possible to do with words instead.
---
Indeed
---
I am rank 7 or 8 and ive 4k on it about 3 times. Map is new, you just gotta learn it again.
---
But that's yet another way to wake up out of the umpteen ways survivors already have to wake up.
---
I mean it wouldn‚Äôt hurt anything would it? You could just stay out of voice chat.
---
No, but if you want the same effect then run DS
---
Youtube search 3 gen strategy. Guard 3 gens in close proximity. They can't finish gens if you keep swatting at them flies.
---
the truth was in front of us the whole time
---
And sandbagging them is making that worse.
---
Killers think they got it bad when a survivor dc's. At least they still get points.
---
And they already fall asleep fairly quickly on their own, not to mention whenever you land a hit on them. Every minute they spend looking for that umpteenth way to wake up is another minute not doing gens or cleansing totems.
---
You really want easy mode huh?
---
Is dead hard bugged? Lmao of course it is, it's a survivor perk.

Map usage!! Map usage!!

Is anyone gonna mention those back to back pallets?
---
A buddy and I were testing out the new Soringwood maps in KYF earlier. I commented how I wasn't finding any spots to put a pallet down, and he said that, yeah, there's a lot of pallets on those maps now. Funny how the devs gave more maps that have a lot of pallets on them to a killer who has one third of his power changing to include pallets if he has an add-on equipped. The devs need to remove some pallets on those maps.
---
Just laugh at them and move on
---
Eh spaghetti code everywhere. Wake up and sprint burst were bugged but in a good way
---
For now, balanced landing is my baby
---
Its between ranks 6-13. Those survivors will message you for finding them first.
---
But I still can't think of another killer that has *so many* ways to counteract their power.
---
Fallout 76 is another bug fest I can't help but still turn on. Something about these devs keep me interested and in love with the game. Can't help but still play even with bugs.
---
Must be a survivor main.
---
When I used to stream I used a 1 min delay for competetive games. It gets annoying after awhile.
---
It has to do with new freddy, and previously new ghostface.  That‚Äôs plain and simple why.  Survivors even got BP buffs and will get more soon with the wiggle score events.
---
Its easier to track survivors now?
---
Yeah, on PS4 I've been getting a lot of "no network connection" messages.  Sometimes it totally disconnects me from the middle of a game.
---
My internet connection is fine..

---
There's a lot of derankers and smurfs too
---
I really like playing against new Freddy since his power is so different. I hated Old Freddy.
---
I'd only love a "nerf" for the dream world. Whenever I get sucked in there, I suffer from my graphics card almost exploding and hence, fail all skill checks, even without ruin. The only reason I wake up, is not pallets or snares. It's the graphics card.
---
It meets the minimum requirements but that's it. üòëüòë
---
DbD has plenty of recolors as well. Last I check, most people had 3 recolors, and one new model.
---
Pay attention to sound a LOT. Get a good pair of headphones and listen to every leaf crunch under the survivors feet. I would usually try and listen to gens and phasewalk to them if they are being worked on. If they are go to them and you'll usually get an easy first hit. Afterwards once your power comes back it'll be easy to get your second hit by listening for the survivors groans of pain and looking at their scratch marks. An easy mind game is freezing in place and standing there for a second or 2. This will make the survivor think that you are phasewalking and they'll do some stupid ass things. This won't always work though. You are slower than most killers so your phasewalking is very impostant. Use it as much as possible so you get used to it.
---

---
That‚Äôs exactly what i mean. It‚Äôs a different and by itself, worse issue.
---
And then making him have discount power that only works if they spent a minute falling asleep or you've already hit them in the rework
---
Kate derping as usual.
---
I'm just hoping dedicated servers fixes it. They say killers will get husks to hook when survivors dc. I just hope survivors get something for when killers do as well.
---
Your Left Behind rework would be busted.
---
It's 80 secs for a gen, 1 dead survivor makes that 60, 2 dead 40, 3 dead 20.
---
At first glance that doesn't seem so bad, considering once 3 survivors are dead it's usually EGC time regardless of left over gens.
---
However at just 1 dead, it's 60 secs for a single survivor on a single gen. Add a second survivor and it's 30. If they both have Left Behind it's 15 secs.
---
Your quickly looking at 1 person dead being the best thing to happen for the remainder of the team.
---
To keep it fair you'd have to dial it back to like 10/10/15% an even that might be a bit much.
---
I think it's fine. Ormond and Haddonfield need to be deleted from the game though.
---
put a min timer delay on the stream as ik it sucks but stream sniping is not against the rules

---
In greenranks.

Pallet freddy is not as good as snare freddy youcantchangemymind.
---
Whats a 99 and how do you break a hook
---
Jane is thicc in the same way how Squidward got thicc after eating the contained volume of Scroogebert McDuck's vault worth of Krabby patties. Fat. Jane is fat. There, I said it.

The bearer of "good job so far" news

Why is there a rabbit on the bottom right
---
Also prayer beads are by far one of her best addons. It makes your phasewalking silent. Also her Wakizashi Saya and Katana Tsuba addons are good for beginners. This increases the reappearance time and speed. This means after you come out of phasewalk the speedboost you get lasts longer than normal and you move faster than normal. This gives you more of a margin of error.
---
But think about all the perks that would become useless, kindred, bond, empathy ect.
---
Those mf eyes
---
Meh doesn't stop him for being fun to play at rank 15 below. Im honestly having a blast with the Doctor regardless if get rushed. Tho in my book he isn't as bad as Pig. Who would be the F tier killer and where would Doctor be in the current tier list?
---
It's already being worked on. It should give them the coordination of a swf. This way (proximity chat) it isn't as op
---
Why not just add a marker system
---
Basically allow survivors to put down colored markers 
---
Like Red/orange Beam for killer
---
Blue for item
---
Green/yellow for gens
---
And white if you need heals
---
They basically have the beam FX from that map add on nobody uses
---
And could modify the code to just be a universal thing
---
Put it on the D Pad for controllers (not sure the kbm equivalent) and either ditch or remap emotes
---
Then everyone basically can give info like a swf team, without needing cons, and it bridges all team play
---
Rather that be 1, 2, 3, or all 4 players 
---
And no toxic bs except maybe some marker beam trolling
---
Thank you.
---
Nice :)

Yes but freddy can play snares mid chase without any penalty to him. This allows him to instantly take away any loop a survivor runs to, just like clown throwing a bottle. The only other killers on this level are spirit and nurse. How does billy counter loops? His chainsaw? He can't. He has to mindgame. Freddy just presses a button and takes away your fast vault, your speed, and your loop. No skill or mindgames involved.
---
Why not both?
---
I understood that reference!
---
Bulging out like Tori Spellings eyes
---
Gahaha
---
I'm wondering how you got confused when the camera literally zooms in on "switch to survivor" meaning that the player is currently on killer
---
Hey if u wanna learn from seeing check out tru3talent (may be wrong look it as tru3) YT channel, as advice if u r on pc try using some of the strongest killers, u might get beaten against SWF but if u know the loops already solo survivors should be easy, or at least 50/50
---
The months later part and everything after that lol
---
is it just me or is matchmaking extra fucking garbage recently?
---
At least I‚Äôm not the only one noticing it lmao
---
Then don‚Äôt get stalked all the way lol, you just have to look around or glance at the character portraits when doing a gen. Not to mention survivors have a significant advantage over killers in medium to high ranks especially when combined with discord use
---
Implying I care about virtual numbers on a social media site?
---
*Gagging noises intensifies*
---
Basically overkill, plus many players don't like voice come, including myself. I would turn it off, however I would use the crap out of a beacon/market system both in and out of SWF scenarios.
---
Also, sadly DbD does have a fairly toxic community, and there are a lot of kids who play, and I can't willingly play with kids on a game. I'm sure I have before, but like many people, it just completely throws me off, and i feel like a wierdo
---
Another reason for just a beacon system is, it adds a bit more of a bridge to all players, we all have different languages, and terminology, and pacing, and markers can kind of fill that void in a way voice chat can't
---
And yes it would help the already existing SWF players too, but no more than it would help a team of randoms
---
I'M SAD BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPERIMENT, I WILL BE ON HOLIDAYS AND WILL BE RETURNING ON THE 1ST OF aUGUST IN THE EVENING.  MURPHY'S LAW OR WHAT.
---
Played about 20-30 matches against him. Every single one of them 4k, with around 2-3 even getting down to one gen. He doesn't even look that good on paper but man, playing survivor really isn't much fun right now.
---
Dream pallets are an addon though right? So they probably won‚Äôt see super large amounts of use depending on their rarity
---
Maybe add so extra stuff to madness, since atm its super add on reliant
---
And remove his slowdown in treatment
---
Use it to bribe Gabe N into actually doing Left 4 Dead 3 and Half Life 3
---
MOTTO MOTTOOOOO
---
I'm not going to lie. If eight P3 Claudettes loaded into the lobby at once, I'm going to be literally shaking. That's terrifying.
---
Just Play Nurse
---
I think they're a brown addon.
---
This build is trash. Run tenacity/resilence/dead hard with no mither and power through those jennys
---
Ahhh okay! Basically some killers have bad teachable perks that you probably don't want on most of your killers. All I was saying was when you get to a level where you can buy a teachable perk, think about whether or not you really want to unlock the perk because you can always go back and unlock it later. If you don't want the perk on any other killer it might be better to leave it locked for a while.
---
There are 60 killer perks in total (i think). Each of these perks has 3 levels so if you think about it, that's 180 perks you need to buy in order to have everything unlocked on a killer. Let's say I just bought a brand new Level 1 character (let's just say the Spirit) and I want to get Barbecue and Chili on them. If you have all 60 perks unlocked (like I do) it becomes really difficult to get Barbecue and Chili on the Spirit because every level I only have a 1 in 60 chance to get Barbecue and Chili on my bloodweb. I might have to spend hundreds of thousands of bloodpoints buying tons of levels for Spirit just to get Barbecue and Chili level 1 to show up.
---
But what if I was smart about it and only unlocked the perks I need? Let's say I only unlocked 5 perks so far, plus the \~15 perks that aren't unique to any killer and show up in any bloodweb. Well now I have a 1 in 20 chance to get Barbecue and Chili and a 1 in 5 chance to get one of the useful perks that I deemed worthy of unlocking (such as Hex: Ruin or Discordance). I probably will be able to have a full Spirit build with good perks by the time you hit level 20 and have all the perks unlocked. This saves you a ton of time trying to get bloodpoints and now you can use your super strong Spirit build to farm even more bloodpoints quicker!
---
Does this make sense? It's a tip I really wish I got when I was new because it saves soooo much time so I want to make sure you understand lol Basically, just be smart and unlock perks as you need them, don't just go HAM and unlock everything the first level that you can.
---
Oh well, I figured trying a taste of originality and I got this.
---
When you hit random on the character customization.
---
Big one I want to see is the shop garage, if it had a back door it be perfect
---
Maybe rework the asylum some, has a bit too much crap inside
---
Is this a joke? If no the brown toolbox are the worst in the game but also every brown item or addon or offering. You can say that the devs are racist in your opinion, but the only racist is you. You associate DBD with being racist only because they're using a damn color.
---
I got it anyways. I knew it didn't work like that I just wanted to have a new perk.
---
Maybe someone didn't know there is something else than rank 1 in this game.
---
So..3 Dwights, huh ? *blinks eye*
---
These gave a solid wholesome smile. 10/10 would frame un-ironically.
---
10 dream pallets is overkill, though, is it not?
---
Yeah 100bp for 'wake up' lmao
---
Any change that results in less tryhards with Spirit and Shitbilly in the queue is a good change in my book. From what i've seen, Freddy is a pretty good change of pace, and isn't downright OP (except his lunge, not sure if it was a result of lag or wonky hit detection, but he's managed to hit me in some pretty ridiculous angles and distances, so i think there might be a problem here). Overall though, playing against him is a pretty interesting matchup where survivors actually stand a devent chance to escape.
---
Stealth is for babies :)
---
Even the mess of a game, Friday the 13th the game, implemented a ‚Äúsalt mine‚Äù system where people who dc would receive salt, and would only get placed with people who had a similar salt level to them, so it can‚Äôt be that hard if gun media could do it.
---
For that he must've done more than just a pretty good job so far
---
No nerf my freddy boi. I just bought him and leveled him to p3 level 50 since release lol
---
It‚Äôs a god complex to not want to play with someone who has a large recorded number of dc‚Äôs, who will potentially ruin the match for everybody by being a cry baby?
---
When I first saw this i thought it was Nea after killing Amanda so Nea can steal her costume and become the killer she‚Äôs always dreamed of being
---
Tried it yesterday it doesn't work with ambush which sucks that was my favourite perk to run miss piggy.
---
bruuh same smh
---
Does anybody even use this perk? I always keep it as a possibility in the back of my mind, but i've never once bumped into a killer using it. Granted, highest ranked killer i've versed was around rank 12, but i've never seen a blood warden pop in youtube vids of high rank players either.
---
I don‚Äôt think Freddy is OP but I wouldn‚Äôt ask to nerf any killer until nurse gets it. The worst thing about nurse is that with range addo s she can hit you before she appears on your screen. Maybe it‚Äôs latency but it also happems to streamers with green ping.
---
I love the sound  and screen effect. It‚Äôs spooky
---
A 99 means that someone sabotages a hook until the bar is 99% filled, so that just touching the thing will break. You can break a hook by using a toolbox or Jake's teachable perk: Saboteur.
---
THEY SHOULD ADJUST IT TO THE CURRENT GAME MECHANICS. REPAIR SPEED WHEN THE HATCH SPAWNS IS USELESS! THE GATES ACTIVATE ANYWAY WHEN THE HATCH GETS CLOSED
---
There's a bug apparently, even though I haven't experienced it  - you get the i-frames, but next to no distance.  
---
I can only imagine how annoying it is when you DH for distance, just to get screwed by a bug.
---
Toxic ass loadouts poor guy
---
Not to mention he can also become the environment as long as ot has no mechanical parts e.g gens
---
They did and they gave him a bad cough and throwable bottles
---
For real, i get people are disappointed, but we have been BEGGING the devs for years to focus on fixing stuff before adding new stuff, and the very second they stop rushing out content, people start complaining. I don‚Äôt know how videogame developers deal with the amount of constant complaining they get no matter what they choose to do.
---
Thank you BHVR, for actually stopping and taking a second to fix the glaring issues with the game. (Although maybe a double bp weekend wouldn‚Äôt be terrible.)
---
The true meta.
---
I hope you reported him, that's a bannable offense.
---
7k hours in a moba. You could fill a salt mine. My heart goes out to you friend.
---
Spirit: You, Freddy Krueger, Freddy Krueger was number third in the usage? I could not BELIEVE it!
---
Hell yeah, glad to see them taking this approach, hopefully they still turn on double BP for a week or something.
---
Dream pallets are fun and all but they can't be used at windows like snares can and it's kind of hit or miss. I have had games where they just fuck up every loop and throw down the wrong pallet and in my last game this Dwight seemed to be watching my screen cause this guy guessed EVERY SINGLE pallet correctly, and yes he was asleep. Pallets are good when they work but they don't always work. Dream snares are reliable and don't guarantee a hit as hard as someone falling for a dream pallet but once again, the palletes are unreliable.
---
I think everyone jumped aboard the hate on snares a bit too fast
---
If someone dc‚Äôs too much... 
---
if it‚Äôs a survivor they should be temporary banned from using swf, and the next matches they play until they‚Äôve hit enough matches where they haven‚Äôt dc‚Äôed, they should be marked with a specific cosmetic, and everybody in the lobby should be able to vote kick them before the match starts, if three or four people vote kick, they will get moved to a different lobby.
---
If it‚Äôs a killer that has been spam dc‚Äôing then they should have to play with shitty mechanics based off of their killer until they‚Äôve played enough matches, here are what I think could be used.
---
All killers: no addons or perks or offerings are usable 
---
Trapper: You move at 90% movement speed, no traps in your inventory or on the map, and randomly a trap will spawn open on your feet and you will step into it, after the animation the trap will despawn.
---
Wraith: move at 50% movement speed while cloaked and uncloaking takes longer, you have no lunge
---
Billy: you move at 80% movement speed, and chainsaw sprinting makes you move at only 100% movement speed and your chainsaw no longer deals damage.
---
Nurse: move at 80% movement speed, blinks no longer go anywhere, you just stay in place and then are fatigued
---
Hag: 75% movement speed, whenever someone triggers your trap they receive a sprint burst, you can no longer teleport to traps.
---
Doctor: you move at 70% movement speed while in punishment mode, but while in treatment mode you move at 100% movement speed, madness no longer increases on survivors, you cannot shock, all survivors within treatment mode terror radius get a 20% speed increase.
---
The shape: while in tier 1, you have a 32 meter terror radius, no lunge, and move at 80% movement speed. In tier two you move at 90% movement speed, no lunge, and everyone can see your aura across the map, and even if you stalk all four people completely, you won‚Äôt hit tier three, 
---
Etc....
---
If you think this is too harsh, you forget the fact that as killer dc‚Äôing all four survivors lose a match, and their earned points, so you deserve to lose matches and be humiliated, and as survivor you make the match unplayable for everyone else, so it makes sense that you should be at the mercy of other players to make the game unplayable for you since you liked to do that so much.
---
Also if you dc mid match while these shitty punishments are put on you, you will be banned for several days at a time, since you don‚Äôt wanna make up for being an asshole.
---
Yes and its rotten fields, and you are nurse, and they are all running flashlights and deadhard.
---
Ment guys fuck him
---
im not too sure what that means, but yes us Quentins are treated harshly, especially on console. I play on Xbox and when i get hooked, people don't even bother to rescue me.
---
This joke is the essence of this game of course it will never gets out of date, god bless mathieu c√¥t√©
---
Didn't they change the corn up to look much lighter now? I play fancy blendette and the corn looks much lighter. Unsure if corn vision is still a thing on killers but so far it seems like people get easily seen now
---
I think what most people mean is that at red ranks, while you can still win, you have to play almost perfectly, and survivors have to not know exactly what you're trying to do.
---
With Nurse, Billy, and Spirit, it comes down to how well the killer is adapting to what the survivors are doing (where they're going to try and loop, how they're going to try and juke you).
---
With other killers, you're kind of trying to make the survivors make mistakes, so when they don't, you're in a lot of trouble. Especially if they know how to optimize gen rushing, when and how to save hooked teammates, and how well they know all the best looping spots.
---
I mean, I managed to get from rank 5 to rank 1 with JUST Myers a few months ago. The thing was, it was not only extremely difficult, I had to play at like 110% focus, where every mistake cost me a fuckload.
---
This happened to me before the patch, but so far I haven‚Äôt had any so it prob will come back
---
I mean, that can happen right now as well.
---
I love the thought that besides being a psychotic murderer, Ghostface is just a normal late teen-young adult and probably gets along with survivors in the fog between trials.
---
veat
---
Steam comments are cancer, because there is no community or mod team trying to keep anything in check.
---
I mean, I'm not advocating for people dogpiling against comments and threads they don't like, downvoting them into oblivion over fanboys / haters being the majority. But people will make the most asinine threads that are completely devoid of logic, reason, or even facts about the game.
---
I like the rework. Its good but not too OP. He has what all killers should, a mobility tool, a decent trap, and a neat gimmick. 
---
Trapper has a trap, no movement and his gimmick is trap.
---
Imagine the spirit whilst fading in and out of reality walking towards you with a fucking chainsaw
---
I said what are you on about? hitboxes are fine
---
Wrong add-on that displays auras that maps detect to other survivors whenever you use the map. That's the "Glass Bead".
---
It's called the God pallet for a reason because survivors can get a ton of loops out of it  before the pallet is dropped. I don't want to have to keep relooping the same place over and over.
---
Its like the devs for DG sees all the popular suggestions for DbD and goes "We'd love those!" and then implements them.
---
We need this hero back
---
*laughs in MacMillan*
---
People have been arguing whether it‚Äôs a buff or a nerf. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a buff if you‚Äôre good at the game and maybe a nerf if you‚Äôre not
---
The pig Lowkey looks fire in her own way
---
Yes, same. And it‚Äôs taking pips and offerings with it.  (PS4)
---
I love the art style.
---
Save the best for last is pretty nice on m1 killers
---
My spirit in a nutshell.
---
At this point, I just find Freddy a pain in the ass to play against as everyone is playing him and it gets a tad boring.
---
But it was, the one which give you speed when you leave the obsession scape, or the one which give you atk speed when you hit a non-obsession sr?
---
Probably, but I still get corn vision.
---
Agreed. I played a lot of games where salt is prevelant. Cod, overwatch, fortnite and a lot of others but nothing comes close to how much hate messages I got from dbd
---
At least you have teammates that try to save you, I always try my best to get everyone off the hook but once I‚Äôm hooked I‚Äôm pretty much guaranteed to go into the struggle phase.
---
It's slug time :)
---
Goodbye, may you have the best of luck in whatever game you pursue
---
Can we get a character that looks like him
---
And up vote this
---
Mmmmyeah
---
I don't think he's majorly overpowered but I don't find it fun to play against him. His kit has to much going on.
---
A teleport, snares/fake pallets and a debuff every 60seconds that require you to run around the map basically revealing yourself not to mention the damn lunge range make him fairly counter fun.
---
He doesn't seem to have any weakness or ways yo out play him.
---
When kate was released I thought that boil over would be a great replacement for decisive strike.
---
I've never been so disappointed.
---
Love you too bro, hope you have tons of fun with whatever you're gonna get up to next.
---
Currently rank 10 and got a wraith rank 20 with nothing on
---
This is very true. I am hoping BHVR don't nerf him off people claiming he is OP based on this. End of the day its not the killer being too strong just survivors making bad choices, I think half of them still think he can see auras when your asleep.
---
The one where you get a token for each hit that isn‚Äôt dealt to the obsession and each token grants a stackable 5% decreased cooldown on succesful attacks. Hitting the obsession will make you lose 2 tokens though
---
**Coughs in WGLF**
---
If you get frustrated by chat you should hide it by default.
---
I would love it if they added both Steve and Robin into DBD. But, that's just hopeful thinking.
---
everybody gangsta until the spirit revs up a chainsaw
---
And he gets a teleport that synergizes extremely well with perks like tremors/pop/bbq.
---
^^^^buff ^^^^trapper ^^^^pls
---
Although it might be against rules posting this glitch I hope this wont get removed. I really laughed.
---
They only trigger if you're sleeping. They slow you for 3 seconds and cause you to scream, giving a visual notification to Freddy.
---
Yea its nice to have a strong licensed killer. Other than Myers, and even he can be hit or miss, I don't think the licensed killers are that strong which is weird because if I sold you the license to my killer I would at least want him/her to be up their with some of the best. Now all I need is a Robert Englund Freddy skin.
---
A ok, that isn't bad, I dont like but is a good perk
---
Imagine four P3 Squadettes blinding you at the same time with this
---
Ah okay, thanks
---
Oh god yea the end of a bad Freddy game was always survivors clustered like a flock of birds bobbing up and down by the exit as they know you wait for them to fall asleep.
---
I'm not sure if you know this already, but generally you don't commit to chases that will take you too long to finish. I often bail the chase after the first broken pallet at the start of the game if that survivor isn't still injured. While 3-4 survivors are still alive map pressure is top priority
---
In a SWF context it could still be worth it. The Killer is more likely to go for a Hook further away because he couldn't see the Aura of the Hook behind the Wall next to him. Which in return enables bodyblock opportunities.
---
Well thank you very much !
---
Yeah but the customer must run around to trigger the trap lol
---
You don't deserve memes
---
It's like a rope walk. Just don't look down.
---
Bubba would have to be the chef on account of the only thing he is good for is BBQ and chilli...
---
Traps don‚Äôt indicate that you can‚Äôt hunt down those survivors. Next time- let them do all the gens, search chests and teabag out the exit. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
and that's why I absolutely love kindred
---
&gt;No perks should ever have a benefit that appears later in the game; The only acceptable killer strategy is to roflstomp at the start
---
When the killer closes the game instead of leaves it via menu you lose your points and items.
---
Quick question: I played against the reworked Freddy once so far and he handed us all of our asses on a plate in less than 5 minutes. What is a good way to counter him? 
---
I know he can now hit you whenever he wants and that he can teleport to gens. When I played against him, there was also a timer and when it went off, we were all in the dream world. It went off like once in 60 seconds. Is that a normal occurrence?
---
I always go all out with that daily and the entity smiled on me because of it when I got that today. I 99'ed every hook I could and decided to open a chest only to find another Alex's Toolbox in it to finish my righteous crusade to rid the realm of all sharp things
---
If they nerfed him, it could be as simple as 1 extra hit.
---
Slap into dreamstate - hit injured - hit down.
---
Nope, game is pretty active. Regardless of what updates you deem fit or not.
---
I was just guesstimating, I didn't know all the coop inefficiency percentiles, those really make the difference.
---
But even then, when Wake up was giving that glitch buff to everything everyone cried how  busted it was an we were flying through gens.
---
It's really surprising how much those co-op inefficiencies work, still feel like 50% is a tad too much. Plus where not even factoring in toolboxes and great skill checks.
---
I wasn't a freddy main and I wont get to deep into it but now he's the most generic killer that you can get.
---
Ah geez, I unfortunately was a case of this, feel free to hate me for what you're about to read. When I was learning Nurse I got a bunch of "gg ez" etc etc, but I didn't really mind. It was after I learned her, after my hours and hours of horrible games started to pay off and I could actually 4K in red ranks, after I adopted a personal policy of 2-hooking everyone before putting anyone on death hook, it was those messages that got to me: "shit nurse needs ruin crutch baby killer" "had to use 3 blinks cuz you're bad" (especially in games where I barely used the 3rd blink) "nurse doesn't need addons you're bad." Watching VODs of streamers who had no idea how to counter nurse but complained about her being an overpowered killer and how I was being toxic by using my build.
---
So I thought: if they're going to complain when my build wasn't even **that** strong, why not just use the strongest and most toxic possible build that I could? 4 blinks + ataxic, BBQ + MYC + Ruin + NOED. Ironically I started getting less salt post-game because most people would disconnect or suicide on hook. I even used a VPN and changed my IP every 2 hours or so just so people couldn't block me with MLGA. I didn't really have fun and didn't get many bloodpoints, almost every game ended as a 4K with multiple disconnects/suicides. I realized I was taking out my anger on a lot of people who probably didn't deserve it (silver lining: some of them definitely did) and went back to my original build after maybe 15 games of being toxic, but I still feel bad for the innocent survivors that had to deal with that.
---
DS should not even exist lmao
---
Hey, you‚Äôll get it eventually. Just keep drawing and you‚Äôll eventually develop your own style, and just naturally learn it. Use a reference image as a good starting point, and possibly invest in one of those artist mannequins, which you can use for posing and body proportions.
---
cool story bro.
---
I never thought about Windows. I have been using small-game but it can be hard to catch the alert in time especially during a chase. I guess the issue with running windows is that its great against Freddy but if your decent at the game its a potential wasted perk slot with other killers. 
---
Bond is a perk I love because the amount of map knowledge you get if you pay attention is huge. You can tell were people are so if they are chased off a gen you can run to continue it, you can vaguely know where a killer is, you can see pallets getting used and thats just some of its benefits. Great perk when I play solo because it gives me a chance to still play co-ordinated with my team. 
---
I don't run the snares much. I just haven't found a way to use them so they are as viable as fake pallets. Like I said in my op often survivors are throwing fake pallets down I have put up in chase with them or that they have used already. Also it is is hilarious when you face a toxic survivor who will sit at a pallet to drop it then t-bag you only for it to explode and you hit them.

Boil over was good until nerfed, literally, killers were fucking blind with Boil Over 3, now they just easily can find a hook and boil over does shit all towards killers who know how to traverse obstacles.
---
It's not cut but r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Lmao all the killer mains downvoting as soon as they see ‚Äûtoo strong‚Äú

Imagine being the killer and the last 2 survivors have a fucking 100% speed bonus for repairing
---
Pretty sure its a troll.
---
He should have my babies
---
As sly as this comment is it‚Äôs pretty fucking funny
---
Two things I hate about this video
---
1. On console, it's not possible to not be a "fun" nurse. So calling someone out for the most difficult killer to play is kinda dumb.
---
2. DS is supposed to be an anti tunnel perk, but it's timer makes it a second chance perk. He chased and killed another guy and hooked them before going to you and it was a bailout.
---
Of course nurse would be the fastest waitress, blink to the table, drop the food, blink back to the counter.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be cheating to be broken as shit my man.
---
once dedicated servers come they will be the only one suffering honestly
---
Grrr Mondays
---
Killers are stressful and yet there are more killers playing than survivors.
---
r/nobodyasked
---
People say Legion is bad, and he is, but not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Legions is strong when survivors group up and personally I feel like you need to run save the best for last. No other killer even comes close to stacking save the best for last like Legion does.
---
Unfortunately survivors will stay spread out once they know they are goes against a Legion so you are going to have to make the best use of your time when they have to group for saves or heals. Maybe sloppy butcher to make the group for heals.
---
But I think Legion is ok, just use save the best for last and try to snowball then when they make hook saves you can just M1 for downs with super fast recovery.
---
This looks like mobile holy shit.
---
Oh fuck look at that ankle
---
would you rather have what decisive is now or old decisive lmao
---
No gagging. Gabe‚Äôs gotta chode. Full deep throat the entire time.
---
IMO they should definitely add reasons to stick around during endgame collapse besides bming or dull totems. another person in the thread (UniqueName39) suggested that you can get irishard item drops lying around during endgame collapse, obviously they'd have to give very little for the designers to consider it as the amount of skins/killers purchased with auric cells/money would probably go down but it'd totally be a neat system
---
alternatively i'd suggest survivors having different "stats" or alternatively just random bonuses, like jake having a passive +4-16%(?) sabo speed per prestige, david having +5-20% bonus movespeed on protection hits or +2-8% bonus interaction speed and item efficiency while injured, etc. obviously it'd be a bad idea for it to affect something major like base movement speed or vault speed but it'd be *something*. alternatively it could just interact with their teachables or give them bloodpoints instead of stats but extensive survivor gameplay needs something that makes you want to keep playing it instead of just increasing your clout number
---
Y‚Äôall remember the Chicken Hat from MGSV?
---
Yeah.
---
In order to one hit you he has to stalk you first, he doesn‚Äôt just turn on one hit when he stealths
---
Source?

Muuuust commmitt.
---
Idc if i get punished  because when killers dc its the best feeling evaaaa
---
Man, one that like, teleports a short bit forward to catch up to survivors would be so dope and totally ignore windows and pallets üëå
---
Like, we could call it blinking, it would be legit amazing
---
i main legion billy and spirit because they have satisfying (movement) mechanics
---
I am loving this Freddy. My favorite part is that it feels like they added a new style of killer. There are stealth killers like Ghost face, Myers, Wraith...The more straight forward killers like Clown, Doc, Leather face, ect.
---
Freddy though, I would classify him as a trickster. You have great map control with the teleport and the ability to switch between different powers with add-ons is amazing, and they even made them brown, yellow, and green add-ons so you should always have a supply if you want to play dream pallets.
---
Survivors could run a loop while awake and then as soon as they fall asleep the loop could be filled with snares or a bunch of pallets could just show up and they don't remember whats real and whats fake. When I'm in chase if my teleport is up I will constantly fake it on a gen I know survivors are on and once they realize that I'm constantly faking it I go in for real and get hits. or faking a gen teleport to make them run out of the tile but then they just end up running right into you or even using my gen teleport mid chase to appear on the other side of the survivor and trick them. And this plays into Freddy's character SO well. He's a demon that is basically a god in the dream world but loves to make his victims scared by confusing them as to what is real and what is not and then hunting them down.
---
I love this killer so much now and I hope and they do not nerf this. We need more high tier killers and even though Freddy might not be high tier he's a hell of a lot better than he was before.
---
you posted cringe bro
---
This is something the junking mofos says
---
I can't believe we still use watermarks, have you ever actually looked up one? Me neither.
---
Not half as cringy as "cringe, bro".
---
Thid has happened to me, its like the doctor screams you see. Pretty sure its a bug bc we've also had games where ir hasnt happened
---
It‚Äôs a risk. If it‚Äôs up and the players arent amazing at hitting GSC you can add a lot of time to the game. However if a survivor finds it early or memorizes spawn locations or uses a map, Detetcives Hunch, Small game, spawns near it or finds it in a chase and tells their SWF and it goes early, then you‚Äôre down a perk for the rest of the game. 
---
I personally hate how reliant the game is on Ruin in most cases and when you slap it on a build, you have to bring it with the expectation it‚Äôll get destroyed early and your other perks need to be powerful enough for the remainder of the game.
---
Lmao triggered
---
Idc.
---
that's your opinion and I respect it
---
I'm not having a problem at all. a lot of the loops are small enough to mind game. Still getting used to the layout obviously but other than that I'm liking it a lot.
---
Her eyes are killing me omg
---
Stop, I can only masturbate so much
---
Don't play online games with bad internet*
---
You will get gen rushed as no tomorrow
---
I will never be able to forget what Ive just seen.
---
I think he has an add-on that reveals your aura when you tier up in madness. He's one of my least played killers though so I'm not sure.
---
The Spirit had enough of your shit.
---
Maybe will be fixed with dedicated servers?

Honestly I find the diversity of his kit to be thrilling to face against. Also I swear if you use the alarm clock you stay awake longer but that I don't know.
---
If you want to hinder Freddy's teleport ability stay awake. If you're a pro gam3r then have your asleep timer off set with your buddies so you can always just wake each other up
---
https://imgur.com/a/kaQ3Vji Finally got it done!

99 term is also used towards anything you can leave at 99% for your needs. 99 gens, healing, gates switch, stalking abilities. I don't think people say "99ing items" but technically that's what you do when you want to exhaust your item's charges but not the item itself.
---
Also I think you can 99 sabo trapper's traps and then break em in front of him, but I don't wanna be facecamped so I never did that.
---
aww thank you!! It means a lot to me
---
Map always makes a difference no matter what ya do, I never really plan around maps cause of that. The build is mostly based on fast chases, where you chainsaw a survivor before they can even use a certain pallet or loop. When you move at 130% you can take control of many more loops than you could before, only certain specific loops are an issue that you have to eat. Rank also doesn't overally matter, you get the good and bad in all ranks, but if you want to know im 11. I have been 1 before and used not this build, but just PWYF,Bamboozle,BBQ,Ruin together and it worked out well in the red ranks. I do agree without ruin it will be hard, but its not straight up suicide, more like 80% suicide.
---
If you're going straight from hook to chase, then it sounds like you're not being safely unhooked.  Granted that's not your fault, but nobody should be pulling you down if the killer is patrolling or backtracking to you unless they have borrowed time.
---
And if they're leaving you slugged, somebody should be coming to pick you up.  60 seconds doesn't seem terribly long but it's almost an entire gen.  When the killer is *supposed* to hook 4 people 3 times, every second is crucial.  Extending much longer than it is would be pretty broken.
---
People who wanna help their teammates to wiggle free obviously. Easy way to get yourself tunneled tho
---
Welp, the forgot it's called (Leg-ion)

For some reason it's hard to imagine the Spirit running at you at the speed of sound with a chainsaw.

Actually I don't have the Plague so I can not run Infectious fright,I recently prestiged Leatherface and  atm i'm upgrading ghostface, bui I will try it in the immediate future!
---
Aaaaannnnndddd?? The team is already big
---
Thanks for your overwhelming points that u gave me
---
They still slow you down. I am not saying that he needs a tremendous punishment for placing the snares or dream pallets.  I am not even good at playing killer and I am wrecking people with freddy. I was thinking a 2-3% slow down only while placing snares and pallets would be fair. I usually play trapper and hag when I am playing as killer. You have to completely stop what you're doing to place their traps.
---
It is nowhere close to being a suitable killer for this game
---
Dwights heading straight for the nearest locker... unless they're already there.
---
* He no longer has to put you in the dreamstate to hit you, but hitting you puts you in the dreamstate.
---
* He can either spawn fake pallets or snares in the dream state.
---
* Everyone's on a 60-second timer to automatically enter the dreamstate.
---
* Dreamstate still has debuffs applied to survivors.
---
* He also has a cooldown skill where he can teleport to any gen he chooses, which he can also cancel before the channel finishes so that he doesn't teleport, and the cooldown is decreased for each person in the dreamstate.
---
I may have missed some stuff but that's what I remember.
---
*hehe*
---
Actually this is why I find ghostface boring, there‚Äôs nothing special except stalking but you can usually see him faster than Myers.  Myers has that scary moment where he‚Äôs chasing you and stalking you and you‚Äôre trying to get away as fast as possible before Tier 3s. I kinda agree with Freddy though because I always wake up to avoid dream snares and traps and also time penalties. But if you do go asleep it‚Äôs a more immersive game.
---
Him teleporting does make the game exciting though
---
On that Plaguey note my friend. PWYF on plague is amazing as well. Same concept with Leatherface with the 1 shot to conserve stacks, it is also super fun.

and that's when nurse comes into play, though the staggering after the blink..she better not be carrying any trays xD

I feel like he is pretty balanced besides the speed when setting his traps and pallets.
---
New skin for... uhhh... both?
---
Op because you dont even try to counter him, probably only dc
---
The game is P2P and the killer is the host so isn't it just your internet at fault?
---
\&gt;shitposting with blender  
---
Absolute madlad
---
Dont you ever thought that you and your team is not good playing? Because you have to suck in order to loose 30 games against freddy in a row, freddy is not that op, billy is way worst
---
What the fuck?
---
Cool, never seen it before
---
Nah, Myers is actually better and has way more snowball potential than him.
---
Just look at ghostface and his stealth is completely gone
---
It won‚Äôt be balanced- so BHVR should make it a separate game mode that doesn‚Äôt affect your rank. Just make it a fun yet chaotic game mode that you can play without having to worry about your rank changing.
---
It‚Äôs quite pathetic considering his Kit is fairly underwhelming.
---
There is at least 1 on every single map.
---
Demise Of The Faithful
---
Snares are way better than the fake pallets.
---
Similar experience here, this subreddit is 100x more toxic than my actual experience in-game
---
That‚Äôs gotta be an instablind :)
---
i‚Äôd let her smash first
---
If you‚Äôre ever feeling frisky, Run Boil Over and Flip Flop. You may never get slugged but BOI if you ever do, you‚Äôll be giving the killer one hell of a ride.
---
When you switch off your main killer and try to play as them still
---
But sometimes he 1 hits me even if it doesn't seem that he stalked me. Does it mean he stalked someone else and then he used it on me? Like Myers?
---
She would be more op than nurse lol.
---
Gota love the spirit rework
---
Doctor is way worse than him.
---
Wait can u just spin it?
---
 all my friends and I have been left right spamming
---
No, duh
---
Why would you close the gate when the killer is coming?  in our case, we want it open faster  xD
---
I‚Äôve played so many games that showed green ping in lobby, only to be very laggy in game. It‚Äôs rare for a green ping lobby to actually be well connected in the actual game for me.
---
Learn Spirit, Hag or Huntress.
---
Head on will never be good. The fact that it‚Äôs an exhaustion perk and you have to wait 3 seconds to actually use it? Yeah no. 2 seconds and a reduced exhaustion timer and fix its issues, the perk would be somewhat decent.
---
that survivor was definitely standing in the wrong place
---
Funny af when I get them on my profile, whenever I'm bored I'll laugh at the salt
---
The game is currently, today, balanced around survivors knowing what they're doing. And yet how many don't and do stuff like stand out in the open when BBQ could be active, forget that running causes scratch marks, that entering lockers makes noise, etc.
---
If you **choose** to disadvantage yourself by not communicating with your team, you can compensate for that by being a better player. So what if you're not calling out the killers location, you're still landing those great skill checks, keeping the killer looped, bodyblocking for last-hook players etc.
---
Some people play without head phones, while watching tv, eating, or otherwise dividing their attention and placing themselves deliberately at a disadvantage. That's their decision, they chose to do these things and the game doesn't need to be balanced to accommodate them.
---
Try to practise as much as you can beacuse if you get at higher ranks you will cry if you not rely on the instadown of the Leatherface
---
What?
---
Which side do you play?
---
That shirt makes me believe that the Entity has Nea's body
---
Imagine if NotQueen were the creator of dbd and you made this exact post but with her instead, downvote rain + banned or deleted post
---
Idk why you so pressed, Nurse could‚Äôve easily ran extra blink addons, in which she is no longer a difficult killer to play as. 
---
And so what? The perk helped him.
---
It's a meme build. It's rarely run, but when it is. It works. Disgustingly. It needs to be rare though to work honestly.
---
Facts
---
Yeah, just do it fast if you can.
---
I think that there are two main problems for survivor game play.
---
The first is early camping and tunneling. Especially for newer players and solo queue players, it makes it so that you effectively don't get to play the game at all. I harp on it often, and it's kind of amusing that one of the things I say about it is that ultimately it will make it so that survivor is only worth playing if you do swf on comms, and look at that....
---
The other problem is timing. Right now it takes x amount of time to win by doing 5 gens, opening a door, and escaping. There are a few ways to make x smaller, but not by much. Instead, nearly everything that happens in the game works to make x larger. Getting rid of totems? X got bigger. In a chase? X got bigger. On the hook? X got bigger. Rescuing someone? X got bigger. Removing ruin? *X got bigger*.
---
The game needs some mechanic(s) that allow survivors to alter x that doesn't involve simply sitting at a gen and pressing the action button sometimes. Obviously you would balance this by making the base level of x longer, but the game is in desperate need of more ways for survivors to interact with the game in a meaningful way. 
---
I've long advocated for severely punishing early camping and tunneling and balancing that by making the base x significantly longer and using a gas can function. Survivors collect gas cans at one of two spots and filling a gen with gas is a quick action that reduces x for that gen. If a survivor runs with a can they drop it and it spills, so they have to go back to get another if they want another. This let's killers be able to slow down gen progress simply by chasing well while removing the most toxic mechanic in the game, and also gives survivors more useful things to do.
---
I'm late to the party, but the reason would be because no survivor would like to be camped or stepping into an trap the whole time.
---
‚ÄùJust git gud‚Äù Trapper is unbeatable if you know how to properly use him, talking from experience and from other trapper mains.
---
So when you say: **You‚Äôd have to convince me by proving every post in their entire post history on the DBD forums makes them out to be a dick, WITHOUT a SINGLE EXCEPTION.**
---
You refer to: **But Peanits is a bloated dick just like Not\_Queen...**
---
You refer to a whole different paragraph? and now you try to play it of as if you didn't fuck up royally? Are you sure those 2 aren't your parents... because god damn you have a bright and shining future ahead of yourself as a BHVR CSR...
---
Have fun mate, this started of a rant I admit but now it's getting super fun for me! I can't wait to see what you'll suck out your own dick next that won't make any sense!
---
League was sure as hell a shitfest. Only happened when there was a yasuo on my team though... hmmm
---
Easy for you to say when you have GF as your flair. You could stare at him and he still wouldn‚Äôt be taken out of his power.
---
Get the hag dlc for hex ruin it's a must for killers   
---
Halloween dlc for Laurie Strode's decivise strike which it's a must for survivors
---
If you want also a top tier killer you have to buy the dlc of the spirit which is imo the strongest killer
---
Feel free to play console nurse with range addons and post a video.
---
I think it's bait. I got a hint from their name "I_h8_memes_"
---
You do stay awake for an additional 30 sec if you use the alarm clock.
---
So basically give people even more reasons not.to touch the game anymore
---
Ghostface is funny too because he can teabag
---
..retrad
---
I feel dumb
---
Nor if you got a 4k with a strong killer or some shit like that
---
Lol the tf2 update dropped last night. Good post. Enjoy the upvote :)
---
Okay guys i will remake the meme
---
The possibility of running about with fortunate son blasting out at full volume or GhostBusters when playing as GhostFace seems WAY too intriguing to me
---
It‚Äôs not that big a deal :)
---
It's impossible to lose the killer? Lol what? No it's not.
---
Poor guy a nurse even with range add-ons on console is really difficult to play as
---
Yea it's infuriating cause as of now there's no way to know if somebody is around unless using whispers, but opting for a game where killers automatically have whispers makes it another thing, especially I you heighten the fov for the killers.
---
sad thing is that survivors have it easy
---
Atleast you got to rank 1 in the first place. Life is hard as a bubba main, currently at rank 3
---
I miss equip swap glitch Nurse already.
---
This isn‚Äôt even my final foooooorrmmmmm
---
I‚Äôll probably mostly play killer
---
wait till No0b3 sees this post somehow lol.
---
(On PlayStation only) Just look in the store for dbd go to extras,show all and there you can see everything
---
U're right. But i just use Leatherface until i get BBQ on Doctor. My main is Freddy
---
Unless you have BBQ, I would suggest buying Leatherface as BBQ is very important. Aside from that, Clown has good perks but isn't a very good killer by himself.
---
In my opinion:
---
1. Halloween: Michael has a good power and fun to use + Laurie has 2 god tier perks, which DS will help you extremely much since you'll get tunneled a lot as a new player.
---
2. Leatherface: just for his teachable perks, which are really good.
---
3. Curtain Call: Clown has also 2 great perks but his power is meh, however, his survivor, Kate, has 2 decent perks which one of them, Windows of Opportunity helps you see all the windows and pallets within 20m and it can help you a lot as a new player getting used to the environment around you.
---
4. Ash: it's not worth it, garbage perks and he's loud af as a survivor.
---
5. A Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy has only 1 good perk (Bloodwarden) and he just got reworked and his new power is pretty fun. His survivor, Quentin, not worth it, the perks are awful.
---
6. SAW: Pig has 2 great perks and a really fun power (she also has a really cute stun noise), her survivor, Tapp, has 2 decent perks.
---
7. Shattered Bloodline: Spirit is the second best killer in the game, her power can be a little difficult to use at the beggining, but if you have good ears and a little awareness, you can do great with her, her 3 perks are also good. Her survivor, Adam, has 1 amazing perk, Deliverance (which works well with Decesive Strike).
---
8. Darkness Among Us: Legion has only 1 good perk, Discordance and their power isn't too great but not too bad also. Their survivor, Jeff, has 3 decent perks.
---
9. Demise of the Faithful: Plague has 2 good perks and her power seems pretty fun and easy to use. Her survivor, Jane, has 3 perks that are really situational, not too good but decent.
---
10. Ghostface: Well, Ghostface has only 1 decent perk, his power is somehow similar to Pig and Myers, not really worth it.
---
11. Last Breath: Nurse is the strongest killer in the game, she has 1 good perk and her power requires a lot of practice but i recommend not to try her first, she's not supposed for beginners. Her survivor, Nea, has 2 good perks.
---
12. Headcase: these are just cosmetics, i recommend to not grind for this, it won't make you play better or anything and the cosmetics are yikes.
---
&gt;The game is currently, today, balanced around survivors knowing what they're doing. And yet how many don't and do stuff like stand out in the open when BBQ could be active, forget that running causes scratch marks, that entering lockers makes noise, etc.
---
Difference being here that you can just play the game more and get better through practice. It doesn't force you to talk to strangers and be uncomfortable/have a bad experience.
---
&gt;If you choose to disadvantage yourself by not communicating with your team, you can compensate for that by being a better player. 
---
The game will be balanced around you having comms, it's not about being a better player. You are can be a good player and not use comms and you will be handicapping yourself because the game assumes you are using the built in voice comms.
---
I've played team pvp games that had comms. I've seen how often people would just throw games just because someone wasn't using a mic and sandbagged that person, blamed every loss on them not having the mic and shat on them every post game lobby. You will feel pressured to join comms both by your teammates and by the game assuming you have them. It's a bad experience, this game doesn't need it.
---
Ok you ruined my day :(
---
Usual toxic* clown
---
I would say Bamboozle,Nurses, thrilling tremors, and Enduring its what I use and its been pretty successful.
---
I prefer survelience over discordance on them since most experienced players can figure out you have it discordance fairly quick and can just avoid doing gens together. Also while I love thanatophobia on them if you are running ruin and sloppy I would suggest nurses instead. Maybe instead drop ruin and add nurses in its place
---
It just *feels* that way
---
Damn good play!
---
Claudette was a dumb dumb
---
Okay? I mean that's no fun for you but what do you expect them to do?
---
Unfortunately. I wanna play Ace because I have his flamingo shirt and I adore but Everytime I try I get tunneled like no body's business because ace has a bad rrp
---
Me with bloody coil: "congratulations you played yourself!"
---
Hmmm....
---
Probably put Spirit in the kitchen too.  She can add some variety to dishes.
---
Ghostface can also bus.  He'll peak out from behind a wall to see if people are done.
---
Myers can be another host, alongside Wraith, backup while Wraith shows people to their table.
---
Billy can also go to the kitchen, handle food prep, taking Huntress and Trapper's catches and prepping them before the go to the Chef's.
---
I think Meg and Jane should be higher.
---
Run away from me?
---
They didn't? And you didn't kill them?
---
The doge meme made a comeback. r/dogelore is thriving right now,
---
All for of them at once?
---
Just team up with Ashleys or Jeffs. Those mother******s are loud.
---
Tbagging won't kill you nor does it affect the game at all, besides them wasting their own time, genrushing? Girl no. 
---
And farming depends on what you mean by that
---
Milly time
---
Jake should be higher, I don‚Äôt face camp but Sabo-jakes tempt me.
---
Yes if I‚Äôm at the gen they shouldn‚Äôt stay on it or I‚Äôll keep killing them
---
You can always go M1 killer build on Legion : Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, Enduring and Spirit Fury. Other good perks on Legion are : Sloppy Butcher + Thanatophobia, Surveillance and Discordance.
---
You win this time
---
Why would you post this why would you remind of the only reason I'm playing dbd and overerwatch you sir have ruined my morning and thank you very much
---
I feel like on 1 play sesh every match is a 4k and then the next day i just fucking struggle and go play survivor instead
---
Imagine spirit...
---
This is how I imagine someone who cheats in videogames is. Do you not understand that what you did was fucking braindead noobieshit that requires 0 skill and will not make you a better player which you should be strifing towards if you can't get a single kill vs "le evil swf" at what rank 14? You're also a sore loser who has to go full-autismo whenever he gets shattered on, i bet they weren't even swf.
---
Seems like it would be great. What addons do you use?
---
Does it matter? You won, they lost. I see no evidence of a-hole playing, just a salty dead survivor. Good job on keeping the pressure up.
---
By farming I meant whilst I was carry them to a hook they would follow me and unhook him instantly
---
I use a mix of iridescent or legion button for the added effect but the one i keep is one of the knife addons to make mending a nightmare.
---
I HAD THE TUNNELING THING HAPPEN TO ME.  FFS, CAN YOU WAIT MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS AFTER I HOOK SOMEONE TO UNHOOK THEM?
---
IF NOT, AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO RUN BT OR TAKE THE HIT FOR THEM.  NOW I FEEL BAD HOOKING THEM AGAIN.
---
Why couldn't you play the game and get better through practice after the addition of voicechat? It's not like the game will become voice activated.
---
You know people who are colorblind play this game right? They're playing at a handicap but they can still be excellent players because  your performance doesn't hinge on color recognition, just as being balanced for voice chat would't make your performance hinge on communication. You're reading way too much into this. You're not going to get insta-downed and hooked just because you're not talking to your team. Nor are you going to get flamed even remotely as much as killers today right now get flamed.
---
Alright cool
---
I down 2 injured 2 then they decided to start running
---
He is salty, not reasonable.
---
Rank?
---
going strong since 2017....nothing new
---
We won't do gens if you don't hit us lmao. Privileged killers woahs
---
Again, the base ability of nurse does not need a rework. Her multiblink and range addons do. Be aware that your not just talking for PC, if this change was made, nurse would be *practically* unusable on console
---
I was hitting them
---
Pretty smart. Cause of how i play i usually run cooldown addons so i can get right on someone and let Feral go to give chase.
---
HAVE YOU TRIED VERIFYING YOUR GAME FILES?
---
Just had surgery for carpal tunnel and there are definitely times where I just couldn't smash the space bar or struggle any more. Infact that's why I swapped to be a killer main now.
---
That also works but i prefer to slow the game down then to have feral ready at all times, its what you do with the feral is how the game and your addons play out
---
You mean playing as, don't pretend you play survivor my dude.
---
Most megs are megheads (bad) anyway or always stays hidden from the killer because of sprint burst so that's why I put her down the line.
---
Hanzo and Widow had the same nerfs.
---
auto-aim turrets got nerfed tho
---
and it's not a bad approach. imagine someone asking a question on reddit and people being like "well, depends on where you're playing"
---
You could've just asked me, it's because you're shit and you need overpowered killers to rely on.
---
I don‚Äôt mean Feral cooldown, i mean the small atun at the end of Feral. Certain addons help with it.
---
So why complain about them doing gens? Did you bring add ons? If so then don't bitch about them bringing add ons.
---
This, fuckin this
---
A similar thing happened to me as a survivor the other day except- I never got hooked so Freddy couldn't Mori me. I was last alive because he also couldn't catch me. He closes hatch that I was on my way to because I had found it before last guy died. Long story short I ran out of time after he closed hatch and he kept pressure up by patrolling two exits. Like he was supposed to do. Its like that guy who messaged you thinks killers should let last survivor escape if they close the hatch lol.
---
Your brain has design flaw
---
I HAD THIS RITUAL TO.  I DON'T PLAY SURVIVOR, UNLESS IT'S FOR A DAILY.  AND I STILL WAITED FOR KILLER TO BE WAY CLEAR OF THE HOOKED PERSON BEFORE GOING FOR THE SAVE.
---
STOP BEING GREEDY, BILL!
---
Everyone wanted him in game.. butttt we didn't get him, just a prop in the video
---
He needs to blow harder, Bill is still not on PS4
---
I‚Äôm a killer main about 80%, 20% survivor. When I play as survivor I play Quentin or ash. Quentin catches ALL the facecamps. ash kinda gets left alone. No matter what happens that match, Quentin getting face camped.
---
but.. it's incorrect
---
I just ended up uninstalling it :/
---
He doesn't slow down while throwing them. They did originally but that was change a long time ago.
---
It's true that he has less, but his are also far stronger. He can make the slow stronger and make it last longer, plus they cover a larger area.
---
I honestly think if clown had some kind of map pressure he'd be far and above freddy.
---
agree
---
I usually get face camped cause of my cosmetics not the specific character.
---
That and if i manage to run the killer round the map (not a fan of looping it's boring af to me) will usually get me camped aswell.
---
I thought they didn't get as severe damage nerfs on console?
---
I don't know what it meant, you're using ebony mori's like some autistic kid so idgaf go talk to the other loserkillers who can't with crutches.
---
hanzo and widow deal the same damage on console and on PC
---
Ana has an aim assist on console tho
---
tht waz vry rd ovf him to say thta
---
(That was very rude of him to say that)
---
He's talking trash to you. He can't even freaking spell.
---
You must be the most exhausted person on the planet. The amount of mental gymnastics you must go through just to please everyone around you instead of just being free to say what you want must be taking its toll.
---
I used Jake because he‚Äôs my main üëÄ
---
i use crystal bead the same way as that claudette. usually place it at whatever gen im working on incase someone wants to help. especially if im running prove thyself. also nice to place one if you get chased off a good gen or a hex totem
---
I‚Äôm still waiting on that. I‚Äôll do it myself if I have to.
---
I will admit I have done this lol.
---
please tell me this is satire
---
As a Quentin/Nea Main that doesn't tbag I'd like to say I get facecamped a LOT more as Quentin than I do as Nea.
---
^(Of course, I also have a tendency to get caught by the Killer more as Quentin than I do as Nea... :\\)
---
She used where everyone already was though, I didn't see much of a point
---
Ay big mood üòîüëå
---
Every time I play survivor I play Meg and it feels like facecampers are drawn to me
---
 
---
I

I‚Äôm not exactly sure when, but the video had mentioned later in July, but could be more in August since July is almost over.
---
Using it as lock screen now. Many Thanks
---
Don‚Äôt worry about whether it was tunneling or not. There is no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to play as killer, salty survivors just make those rules up because they‚Äôre shit at the game. 
---
You played fine that game. The survivors just couldn‚Äôt handle the fact that they lost, so they tried to shift the blame onto you.
---
beanie quin tho ooooooh
---
Don‚Äôt touch the game if you‚Äôre just gonna be an ass who ruins match‚Äôs because you got downed first or because you got a 0k as killer, didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs too much to ask for you to actually play the game you spent real money on
---
Laurie and Quentin should be higher
---
I mean kinda tearing away from the main point the mori was for me to let lose a little bit and actually have fun without being a massive dick.

wooosh

I hear clown also makes finger licking good stuff

why didnt you hook her? or was it bugged?
---
Go camp some more  shitter.

Yeah, huntress is really rare on console. You only see huntress if it's a new player, or someone running iridescent head

It was bugged because of her dcing

Crazy idea, that has been said numerous times but: Add abilities to Survivors that work just like Killer abilities. They can be used just like active or passive habilities, they are unique and only usable to each survivor, while two of their perks remain teachable and shared.
---
Perks that make unique each survivor should help the team overall.
---
Example:
---
Dwight: Leader
---
Jake: Saboteur
---
Claudette: Empathy
---
Nea: Streetwise
---
Bill: Borrowed time.
---
Team comp will now be a thing.  New releases will be exciting in order to see what they bring to the new pool of variations.
---
In short: 4 perks plus 1 unique ability to each survivor that works to help the team.

Freddy Kreuger

Ah, can't see that on my mobile app unless he comments

Ofc he's playing killer. That's obvious. He said "Anger other people"

Ikr, he's a pain in the ass to play
---
Jesus, imagine the power consumption on something like that

Nah it'd still be completely braindead ezmode on your part, beate me without crutches and then you can have some glory fget.

Wtf ace should be SS rank

Only Ace existence is a troll
---
I can count the number of times a survivor has lost me in the last month (not counting times I intentionally let them go to do something else) on one hand.
---
Strictly speaking it's possible, but tracking in this game is stupid easy so it doesn't happen much.
---
I didnt create this image and i dont know who did.
---
Why so serious?

Played against him once, and a ton of bubbas for some reason. (Rank 15 btw)

It really do be like that tho
---
WHAT DID THEY DO TO NERF HER? THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MANDY LIKE THAT. BUT I THINK THE REASON THEY DON'T NERF NURSE IS BECAUSE SHE'S SO DAMN HARD TO LEARN AND PLAY AS.
---
Yes i still get corrext bp but i think they need to show us again
---
To be fair the wording in this game is confusing overall. For example nurses accuracy doesn't seem to affect anything at all
---
She's a movie character that's why I didn,t put her in that tier.
---
I guess I'm not a good enough killer to pay attention to the birds, so I don't care for them as the killer either lol, maybe I should.. Hmm
---
And, I haven't played against the plague either a lot, maybe it's because I'm low ranked?
---
Yeah still none even after I told you twice I don't wanna argue with some camping loser. Weird.
---
Probably, but it‚Äôs not like some other games where your entire team is insulting you and telling you that you‚Äôre doing bad. I‚Äôve never received a salty message from a teammate in this game, and I don‚Äôt think I will. Survivors tend to throw their built up hate towards killers instead of other survivors.
---
I believe he said it was a one game thing because he was salty

Where did they t-bag in this video?

Could be the Ghostface release and Freddy rework. All I see is Freddy, Billy, and Nurse lol

Pretty good job so far

Dammed hitboxes, man...

They have dedicated servers now do they not? And it is a glitch going around with killer a bunch of my friends get stuck searching for a game then get kicked, or get kicked eight after a game starts.

Didn't knew that :D thanks

You sound like you're a lot higher ranked than me lol, i see Legion, Billy, Mike and some other people

Lol you‚Äôre definitely mature bro
---
Yet you‚Äôre still here, throwing insults at me. Don‚Äôt throw insults at people if you can‚Äôt even back up your own argument.
---
Imagine looping a killer and blasting running in the 90s through VC. Probably funny the first five times, after that the killer will mute you lol.
---
The goal of the killer is to kill the survivors. If you can get a 4K, you may as well get it.
---
Not Op but I think the Asterix is to mark that it's a joke on clowns power
---
Yeah, I'm with you there
---
Nope. The guy just had the natural urge to defend his ego after getting his butt kicked.

Uhm, I mean, it isn't super altruistic either.. I don't care for you running it, but it isn't the most team spirited perk out there
---
According to Xbox I have 629 hours in Dead by Daylight. I would estimate around 200 hours of those are playing Killer.
---
Wanna know how many messages I got playing Killer? Maybe 50 at most. Wanna know what the majority of them says? Ggwp.
---
There are people in this game who will report and harass you for nothing but if everyone is complaining about your style of play, maybe playing against you is just unfun. 
---
Don't sweat too hard when you don't have to and remember that there are humans on the other side trying to enjoy the game.
---
It‚Äôs when the killers camera is looking in your direction. Doesn‚Äôt matter k
---
Which way u face , it matters on killer facing
---
Yeah, I know. Dont you hate it when you got borrowed time, you unhook them from next to the door, and then they spend 30 seconds trying going right and left in the jungle gym because the killer is in between the door and them? I got borrowed time, TAKE A HIT AND RUN FOR THE DOOR. And then they scream at you for unhooking next to the door in the chat. Look to the right dumbuss.
---
Reasonable, but a bit of a stretch, eh?
---
the only new mechanic they gave us since launch was cleasing totems and exhaustion, they could add something i really hope that the plants that were getting leak do something else rather than just be another customization option.

I sincerely hate this

You cry at higher ranks regardless as Bubba, and I say that despite how much I enjoy playing him, if somebody doesn't walk into your saw early, chances are most people are gonna escape

Stop camping if you don't wanna be insulted, pretty fucking easy buddy.

Nah lol always just always

I don't care about Bill, I just want to be able to play the game with my friend and we keep getting booted from games and can't join each others lobbies.  Fix that then let's discuss Bill.
---
Yikes...
---
No, no. Lol I hate p3 claudette honestly and I don't ever really run self care. Meant to just be a funny. It's why I gave it the flair ShitPost lol
---
it takes so long, because almost no one is playing on low rank, so it takes really long to find a match. Once you reach rank 15 you should find matches a lot faster.
---
For me i don't care one bit. If you run me around many loops without even being hit sure teabag, your kicking my ass. But if you teabag on pallet one ooooboy you better be looping me right for the rest of the game. 
---
Mind you i'll still make teabaggers lives hell if can be.
---
Because of the Nightmare rework, more people are playing killer and testing him out, hence longer killer queues. In a few days it will return to normal.
---
Which is always confusing when I've just played an entire match against a Trapper and suddenly I'm exposed when the gates are powered.
---
As opposed to equipping an ebony because you didn't win, fuck those claudettes though saying shit like "camper" or "ebony mori-user" that's the real problem here. GL in rank 15 once they nerf mori's trash.
---
It‚Äôs not on ps4 thou....

So yeah, nice b8 m8

This is NOT ok.
---
When you ran into that bush at the end...I felt that
---
Hmm yeah maybe, but you're still a camping loser.
---
so you use your own post as a source?
---
That's actually all part of the solo survivor experience. Survivors aren't meant to be able to keep tabs on everything throughout the game.
---
Use VPN go to a saturated location and you can cut down queue time to less than 5 mins, just make sure yo connection is good otherwise with red ping everyone will dodge.

so you use your own post and subreddit (where 50% is posted by you) as a source?
---
To me, on console, it‚Äôs actually pretty hard. Since frame rate isn‚Äôt amazing. But on PC in higher ranks I know they usually always hit because they‚Äôre used to hitting great skill checks for ruin.

Only exception is Myers tier 1. He is immune to spine Chill

it's fine for you to post as long as you credit me!

Alright

dont nerf him or im uninstalling
---
She's not even crying. What is she wiping off?
---
Did you use insidious?

Sometimes you gotta play with them to get maximum bp or double pip

He‚Äôs actually pretty balanced. People are just used to Freddy being bad.

Don‚Äôt do it as fast as you can just do decent speed because it won‚Äôt go any faster by turning the hell out of it
---
One of my greatest moments (on console) was when a doctor was doing the whole overcharge, unnerving presence, pink add-on build while camping and tunneling. He downed me off the hook and the decisive strike skill check was the size of an overcharge on unnerving presence (I was tier III madness too). Nailed the skillcheck, ran him for the rest of the match, and everyone else escaped.
---
So to answer your question: it's basically the size of an overcharge skill check.
---
He is great. Staying awake is super important if you don‚Äôt want to get rent by a good Freddy now.
---
I don‚Äôt care if you believe me, but I did.

What... that makes no sense he initiated contact

LMAO well, that escalated quickly.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Also you shouldnt start injured and as soon as you got hit once you get broken. Also the killer shouldnt be able to see the broken icon
---
Spine chill works with the real killer, not the husk. Survivors will know if you are looking in their direction
---
There's a lot of buffs that should happen to no mither. This is a miniscule buff to ask for
---
No. That would kill the perk.
---
you don't take it to "pick yourself up"
---
you take it to start the game injured without killer's help
---
I don't doubt that. My issue was with the hundreds of people who laughed at this joke for the fourth time.
---
I'm just waiting for Cyberpunk and Death Stranding to uninstall this game. I also can't wait for dedicated servers and see if they're actually going to fix anything. I'm also leaving because I know they're going to fuck up my girl Nurse really bad.
---
*confused wraith and nurse screams*
---
Oh fucking hell, now I'm excited
---
When I play Jeff killers don‚Äôt bother camp him. But I noticed Nea and Divid get face camped most of the time. I play the same in all characters yet killers have preference and more inclined face camp characters more than others. Divide is game over for me he will get faces camped and tunneled all the time. I don‚Äôt know why but I use the same perk for all characters to me survivors are just skins
---
And the ghost face was chapter 12 right?
---
youre veat is my veat
---
Wait... generic? Are you insane?
---
Yup
---
Gotta give that a firm upvote
---
Hahaha yeah that's the point of it
---
Use STBFL, it's really easy to hit survivors multiple times
---
Cooool, ok thanks
---
Someone *please* tell me what this has to do with DBD.
---
I haven't played in a long time. What's the game here - is it who spams close hatch/escape faster? Read that you can't hatch grab anymore.
---
He is reasonably salty
---
Every time.. I even tbag crouch before unhooking to get the message through but they just run off... and bam hag goes for me everytime
---
I would say left for dead
---
You can remove them by flashlight them, but it will notify the killer
---
Lmao. When I went back to clip it I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. üòÇ
---
soo true: (
---
this is obviously a joke. if it was a woman, it could still be a joke, but the intent would be far less clear to everyone seeing it

Oh Senzuduck went HAM on that bitch. Oh my God, the topic was awesome.

That's never worked for me. They activate whether you're moving or not. You just gotta be within the radius and standing
---
It was wrong, you're an asshole.
---
Omegablink nurse
---
Doctor needs help ASAP
---
I mean I stand in them all the time.. it's only when I move while not crouching they activate.
---
Nurse's addons and Doctor in general from what I understood
---
Weird. Maybe I'm just doing it wrong
---
I rewatched several times and I'm not seeing as much as a single crouch.
---
Sorryüòó autocorrect
---
So well that people played it for 3 days because of the Hype then dropped it like Michael's Mori.
---
Generally I think they're better than old Badham, aside from some tile rng being complete bullshit at times.
---
Disclaimer: I do not know if it's true or not but it could include people that bought the game and never played or only played like 15 minutes.
---
I'm not sure if that's the case though
---
Aw shame, but no it's not my internet it's been a constant problem with people I know.
---
Just run noed.Everyone will bitch about that.
---
Okay, good. Just making sure.
---
Freddy and Michael above billy???
---
i dont thnk... people that play this game mainly are normally rank 1's
---
Do you have a cross hair?
---
It took several watches, but yeah, it's actually just after his camera pans back up after the hatch is closed that you can see some crouches. I don't know that it was to be rude or not, since it was kinda a delayed reaction on the survivor part.
---
Yeah, but not giving them a reason to play at all is not the solution. Give them a temp-ban or less bps for a while, but don't change the gameplay.
---
I have the exact same problem. I can't play Spirit now for example because she randomly leaves phasing or just tap it. Don't even want to try Huntress. A lot of times can't m1 either.   
---
And same, it's only an issue in DBD.
---
Bruh or when they're overly altruistic and all of them keep trying to go for the rescue instead of gen rushing then most of them get downed. I stop even trying to rescue them if they play like that.
---
I'm wondering the same?? I used to watch her every once in a while.

Platform: PS4
---
Type of Bug: Visual
---
Description: The player level wheel bugged out and the xp number starting increasing dramatically, even going into the negatives at some points.
---
Screenshot / Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-V8URKBX3c
---
Steps to reproduce: Have the killer disconnect right as the wheel is moving to show how much xp you gained in the match.
---
Expected result: Seeing the wheel move a small bit and not create an integer overflow when showing you your xp level
---
Actual result: Wheel spinning around very fast and having a large inaccurate number for your xp
---
Reproduction rate: You can't really make the glitch happens, it's all up to the killer, but the glitch seems to happen ever 2/5 games
---
What are the archives?
---
My playlist on spotify
---
Like you said, she's your main. With pretty much every other Killer besides Nurse, you can play them in rotation.
---
With Huntress and Nurse, you have to invest time and effort into overcoming their control. It comes down to this, most of the time:
---
You a 4k *because* you played Hillbilly, but *in spite* of playing Huntress.
---
Answer me this: why should anyone invest the time and pain to master Huntress, when they could just play Plague?
---
Pink Map, Streetwise, Green Stamp, Crystal Bead and gg.
---
‚ÄúWhy do devs want ppl like me to suffer?‚Äù Why are you making it look like it is done on purpose or they actually want you to suffer when they don‚Äôt, they just didn‚Äôt think about it - I understand your issue and completely agree, but stop trying to make the devs look like pricks enforcing an illness when they really aren‚Äôt.
---
Spam hatch close as the killer. Since killer is host, they‚Äôll take priority in closing it over the survivor escaping.
---
Lol I think it's hilarious that they have the audacity to call you a cheater when they camped the whole match.
---
Season Pass essentially
---
I do lol. It only really helps with long range shots tho.
---
CHRISTMAS IN JULY, SEND IT LADS
---
I love it, they just need to fix the unreachable totem and it'd be perfect
---
 pls dont tell me you consider that toxic. It wasnt even BM, it just seemed like the claud accepting her fate.
---
Here I think this is a good way to normalize it:
---
The achievement, "Getting the hang of it: Raise your rank for the first time." Is at 40%
---
Meaning we can through out 60% of the playerbase probably as people who only tried the game once or never even played it (maybe bought it during a summer sale or humble bundle... whatever)
---
Anyways, so I think 40% is a good baseline, meaning if 4% have the achievement for rank 1 survivor that means relatively around 10% of actual players at one point are rank 1
---
This game keeps getting worse.
---
Her lunge hitbox is longer than my dick
---
Thought I couldn't disgust her more...
---
I‚Äôve been Playing for just under a year and have 1k hours on ps4 and I recently switched to PC and I can confirm that skill checks are 10x smoother on PC
---
Hard to argue it needs a buff and this would make it way more viable, but it‚Äôd also make Iron Will even more lackluster than it already is. Idk how to fix that though, that perk did not age well...
---
I'd put shirtless David in s tier and other David in f tier
---
I'd also create a s+ and put object of obsession in it.
---
Best waste of a pallet I‚Äôve ever had.
---
It would be better to give them each mild passives and not full on perks, which wouldn't be very fair. Like Dwight= slow locker uses are silent, Meg= Exhaustion restores mildly faster, Feng= Skill checks move slightly slower, Ace= Add-on efficiency goes up mildly, etc.
---
Probably Clown. I just had a hard time with that one.
---
Ah that's hot that's hot
---
I don't believe so, she was really ugly so some people in the community called her a killer and then the samanimation solidified it as a meme. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think they started it.
---
I like to spoop them out when they message me and reply like "Thank you for joining the list" and never reply again. Or, say something like "Your more fun to play with on this game as compared to your others". Doing this creepy shit helps if you played as killer. Probably going to get reported one of these days, but it has made like 3 people freak out.
---
Exactly, that's why I said 200% extra. If you're handicapping yourself, you should be rewarded for it.
---
I've thought about it, but I've been on console my whole life and I'm just not ready to invest $1000 into a good gaming PC and learn keyboard and mouse.
---
I gotta agree, I find billy really boring too. Michael is really underrated and can be dumb effective if you use him right imo, and yeah new Freddy is  actually bonkers lol (NOT OP PLS DONT NERF HIM BHVR IM A SURVIVOR MAIN HE‚ÄôS COOL)
---
Yeah it is, it's every 60 seconds. Staying asleep is a strat you can do so you don't waste time on going to alarm clock, you just have to be confident you can hide or loop him. Being asleep also means he can teleport more. He has map pressure, but he can't move fast like spirit or billy, so he's mostly mind games and avoiding his anti-looping powers (dream snares/pallets)
---

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ci48iu/claudette_crawled_in_here_and_i_couldnt_pick_her/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Maybe it's due to the add ons they're running since they can adjust the distance from where the trap activates?
---
There's a gong?
---
double bp would be cool but why should people get punished for wanting to play with their friends? that'd be like making nurse or spirit take 4 hooks to kill someone just because they want to maximise their chance of winning
---
This should just be what Legion does.
---
The first time I heard Michael hit t3 after the update I wondered how he transformed into Ghostface.
---
They are 3 different addons, so they will show up mostly whenever people want to use them. They're tougher to counterplay without small game, but the snares used effectively are arguably stronger, and those you can at least see and adjust for. Pallets you jave to remember, preserve real pallets, and make educated guesses for
---
Now who can we get to give him the best blow job for Half Life 3?
---
Kinda sounds like cheap background music when you customize a character in games
---
He saw the potential in selling cosmetics to PC and console. Mark my words, Bill's gonna get a lot of hats.
---
I disagree personally, one is could promote griefers to hold the game hostage agaisnt noobs, and two, I like the caps as it promotes being a week rounded survivor/killer
---
that would be a bit broken if the killer farms
---
They should add a specialized flashlight that just lights up the area in front of you, kind of how the Alex‚Äôs toolbox is for sabotaging. It could aid in revealing hag and trapper traps easier. A longer duration than other flashlights but near impossible to blind with it.
---
I know it‚Äôs gimmicky but it‚Äôd be a cool immersion feature, especially if they reduced the lighting on the maps.
---
Samination has a way of being blissfully ignorant of the community, doesn't he?  I saw a video where he said he had just learned that butt dancing is actually t bagging. I'm happy to learn he really is the one credited with cementing Nea in as the entity, though!
---
Thank ya kindly!
---
I love this idea
---
he is the same speed as most other killers in the game
---
and he can lunge very far yes. that's not really broken tho
---
I'm just kind of confused as to why Behaviour doesn't want to release anything like a summer event because they want to clean up the game with bug fixes and QoL changes... but they're going to release a ...battle pass?  
---
I'm so sick of this battle pass shit being in every game now: Fortnite, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Smite, Paladins, etc.. and now Dead by Daylight.
---
There is a difference, iron will silences your injured grunta without forcing you to be injured for the entire trial, No mither does.
---
I did that once too, confused the hell out of my teammates. Looks like you duck under the swing and dodge it.
---
Could have blood lust (chasing/looking at survivor for long time )
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care about Bill. Can we get 60 frames on console like come on.
---
Maybe he would have 110% movement speed if he could teleport to his snares (imagine how badass that'd look, with Freddy pulling himself out from among the grasping bloody hands), but he can't so no his movement speed is fine.
---
^(Also I know it's a typo, but imagining Freddy sprinting around at 150% movement speed has me dying.)
---
why just console players
---

---
Thanks for speaking for all of us. Didnt know I wanted it to be easy.

When I play hag people talk shit cause they hit all my traps and she‚Äôs ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù

Yeah what's happening on console?

I legit spent a minute considering hunting down the video, but it's completely buried in one of his older live streams somewhere. Maybe someday I'll come across it again and prove myself. :)
---
Check the ping.
---
My idea for no mother tier 3 = no pain grunting and a 15 % recover speed buff
---
lol NOED on Ghostface. ok
---
But all in all, yes, totems are terrible.
---
Sure it wasn't sarcasm? Some people are scarily good liars.
---
Small Game should be split into two perks
---
One detects totems and also has a counter of remaining totems
---
The other detects traps
---
why tf would anyone wait this long and not save them for the next blood hunt...
---
Incredibly safe pallets and loops mostly around the houses.
---
Freddy is the most well balanced and designed killer in the game.
---
Sexist /s
---
Anyone knows how to swap models like this?
---
Lol complains about Freddy rework. While billy and nurse are still there. Yikes.
---
THANK YOU
---
Thats what my opinion has been, he's right up there with myers when it comes to most balanced killers
---
Is this what the world's come to?
---
Oh nooo! Other people exist that aren't white straight men? GOOD. GOD.
---
Yeah that seems more than fine
---
She reminds me of me when i want to troll a survivor and purposely barely hit him over n over to make chase last forever. She's either trolling or really bad.
---
Yeah, give us back pre-patched Sprint Burst in the meantime this is bullshit.
---
Well his addon were u get a debuff even when awake is stupid and shouldn't be in this game cause its more like a middle finger that care about staying awake . But the rest is fine though .
---
The problem is that they just aren't very punishing. 
---
The slow just isn't very potent.
---
&gt; Thats what my opinion has been, he's right up there with myers when it comes to most balanced killers
---
na he is stronger than myers imo
---
But definitely not stronger than Nurse.
---
How is that even a glitch. I know it is, and have had it before. How do you accidentally remove half the features of your game.
---
*Sees Freddy at 150% Movement YEETING through the cornfields
---
Lmao you‚Äôre welcome
---
Where?
---
I prefer the Dentist drill.
---
Yeah didnt mean like that,just as imo myers is just a really balanced killer same as freddy, not meaning to compare the 2
---
I'm questioning the very fabric of reality now and will have to find this clip to recenter my place in the universe.
---
Rushing to please killers and forgetting about survivors lol jk I'm sure it is just an off code in the middle of 10 others that they gotta untangle without tangling it in with another 25
---
Daaaamn. That was slick! Id just be like gg right then and there if I faced that.
---
read the rest of the comments? it's a shitpost.
---
Me too I can't honestly wait. I feel bad for playing killer with my internet that lag spikes every few minutes but dailies tho.
---
Legally yes, socially no.  There‚Äôs double standards  against both genders.
---
I have 70 hours and I knew none of this. I‚Äôm an idiot
---
More luck than skill
---
Yes. You miss out on game time when the killer disconnects; therefore, depending on how late into the game they disconnect, you can lose a pip.
---
I don't know which one it is but there's one with a huge open space in the middle and only one pallet there, I don't like that one. The others are ok. I prefer pretty much all the other maps to play on but these ones aren't bad.
---
YOOOO WHY YOI NO BOLO TIME
---
I was watching someone stream xcom, and they wanted to make a French soldier, so he put a Russian flag on the dude and said with a completely straight face that it was the French flag, and when people told him it was the Russian one he said that the Russian flag has the hammer and scycle on it. If I didn't know any better I would have believed it.
---
You need bolo time
---
You got your syllables all fucked up. Try again
---
NEEED BOLO TIME
---
Time to decide which killer will be your date: Clown or Hag as you upset Myers with your choice in chapter 1.
---
I like legion . He is a challenge to Play as
---
More just a bad killer lol
---
Release the boosters!
---
This is the same guy who will get pissed about ‚Äú tunneling and camping‚Äù  while proceeding to teabag after wasting 10 pallets in 1 minute.
---
And I mean why would you want a character to be added that takes away general perks and makes them unique to one character

For 3 seconds...

---
It helps you gain at best a meter or two on the survivor. it can be a big deal if you are already close, since it can be what you need to hit them, but if you are farther out it's pretty lackluster.
---
Phil?
---
Because he sucks
---
I forgot to mention I already have her. I edited the post. Sorry about that.
---
At red ranks, isn't it unhook 2 people, do 2-3 gens, and be chased for 2 mins? That's what I usually try to do when I'm not being chased all game.
---
Always wake yourself up at clocks. If asleep, always run through his slow traps when someone else is being chased.
---
Chasing a blinking survivor is shit to tbh.
---
I did this last round she couldn‚Äôt teleport cause my teammate baited another trap on the other side of the map
---
Well not everybody has to rely on strong killers with not balanced addons to get kills
---
Ghostface is an absolute riot to play, I love him
---
Behind the car
---
I know I was just making sure that you weren‚Äôt saying he‚Äôs got a high skill cap or something, he‚Äôs just bad, and I play GF and Clown so I too don‚Äôt rely on thems things
---
"BOOOOMER!!"
---
Mettle of Man didn't give you a "different style". Don't give me that horseshit.
---
It let you do exactly what you were going to do anyways, only instead of getting killed after being downed for the third time, you'd get a free extra health state.
---
The only counterplay was to run an exposed perk (and hope you ran into the obsession after that point), ignore the MoM user (not a real counter since there can be multiple MoM users), or play a killer who doesn't need to M1 people (So if you wanted to play Hag or Wraith today, sorry you're fucked).
---
MoM didn't get nerfed because "baby killers can't play lul".
---
MoM got nerfed because it is just straight up broken, and if you think it was fine I don't think you quite understand what it did.
---
I completely agree let‚Äôs make him move at 145%
---
1. Devs release perk
---
2. Perk helps survivors
---
3. Killers call it broken
---
4. Devs nerf perk
---
5. Less people play survivor
---
6. Long killer queues
---
7. Repeat
---
Self care is a killers best friend
---
You should be sorry
---
Sometimes I have the same, I get a really toxic team so I take Spirit with Ring and Anal Beads and ebony mori, then I feel really bad so I'm trying to stop doing it, it's unhealthy
---
And he's a great killer too !
---
Some rules can be bent.
---
Others broken.

***TRIGGERED WRAITH AND NURSE NOISES***

---
You really think the developers of every game have time or thought to bring a medic in to accommodate to every possible medical issue a player may have? That's insane.
---
After the buff I hit killers multiple times per match with Head on(red ranks so they must at least have a few hours), it's hilarious
---
Bill a savage i see.üëÄ
---
I like the subtle highlighting in her hair. Good stuff!
---
"I can't hold W and camp pallets! Spirit OP!"
---
yeah, you can also remember what parts of the map have been played in more as well. I think that explaining how to do this to newer people might not work as well for them is all, because they're already learning everything and some of this relies on situational awareness that people just aren't going to have while they're learning the ropes. not that i'm some pro. Snares are easier to explain to people having trouble with freddy, don't step in them, go to another loop if you must, simple, can remember it even while in chase
---
Ok...
---
Yeah, that's the build I use. Issue with Thanat is that it's most effective on a single survivor on a gen, but by the time you have the 16%, it's usually mid game and they're tag teaming them. Still, some slowdown is better than none.
---
Wait, your the One that made it?
---
Bubba if ye dont have BBQ N Chilli
---
Halloween event maybe?
---
Because the killer ping never decides to suddenly turn red as soon as the match starts and your locked in. ü§î People still using this excuse huh.
---
Safe pallets are still safe pallets and she has no chase potential without Corrupt Purge. Survivors can still outpace hook states on pallet heavy maps
---
Am I the only one that enjoys the grind. It‚Äôs actually rewarding when you earn something. You can‚Äôt just get stuff gifted to you in this game you have to work for it
---
Only buy licensed characters, as you can unlock the unlicensed killers with iridescent shards.  Honestly, I would start with Bubba in order to unlock BBQ and Chili. It‚Äôll help massively with blood points.
---
Why should his speed change at all? It'd honestly be really dumb because his power would basically be making up for the 5% speed he has had taken away.
---
I heard he‚Äôs getting nerfed. I already have enough for him. If he‚Äôs still good even after getting nerfed, then I‚Äôll consider getting him.
---
While being chased, a % of gens being repaired is also credited to you. So if you can run around the killer for an extensive amount of time, its definitely the most rewarding thing.
---
Personally i'd be in favor of people losing or winning as a team, but most people aren't unfortunately.
---
I see your point. 1 ability unique to a survivor. Then you can customize more with perks. Note that those abilities will not be accessible to other survivors. The main idea is to tackle the "survivors as skins" idea and make them unique in their approach. Just like killers.
---
Well if u already have spirit and nurse and hillbilly are free than what else could you possibly want - this subreddit.
---
What about Michael?
---
I‚Äôm thinking about Freddy or Micheal. I already have BBQ from the shrine. And yes I‚Äôm only buying licensed killers. I bought spirit for 9k.
---
She's op with the skill-level of old legion unlike nurse who I can at least respect.
---
They started getting more money with the introduction of the cosmetic store and the rate that the game changes hasn't exactly improved.
---
wait... ur not the one who is saying its OP, sorry, wrong person...
---
My favorites are ghost face, Michael Myers, and Freddy in that order, all are really fun in their own way.
---
Oh hey sorry, I suck at checking social media.
---
I dont know what the killers name was, we play on the PS4 and he didn't check.
---
It‚Äôs okay, you only downvoted so you could upvote twice. We get it
---
I was going to respond, till I read what you said about noed
---
The unsafe pallet loops have a tendency to spawn hooks, gens, chests or totems which make them safe.
---
They haven't fixed the two-storey house; the window that spawns right at the top of the stairs should be offset to prevent fadt vaults. Plus, the upstairs pallet can only be looped one way.
---
Badham 1 (the original layout) doesn't work with the new pallet system and should be removed.
---
Apart from that, I enjoy them.
---
For some reason I though the environment at the start was a gothic castle. Now I really want a knight/possessed armour killer with a castle map.
---
Gotta pretend to be important
---
I have the same issue. Sometimes it's just takes some minutes sometimes 15+ minutes. Only at 8pm you get literally instantly into a match.

posting content here is kinda pointless, because a lot of people here take it as smap, which its pretty pathetic, i feel its way better to post your channel on the official forum;)
---
If your teammate runs around the killer long enough, it means you have time to do the gens and it means he knows what he's doing. You can go and take hits or take aggro (aggression) and distract the killer I'd you want the boldness points. More often than not, and I only assume you're at a lower rank since you mentioned about 100 hours, at low ranks, the killer will list give up on a survivor thts better than him, giving u a chance to loop and get chased. 
---
Also if a survivor is getting chased, there's no reason for him not to escape the chase or loop, just so you can get chased a bit later, if that makes sense
---
Use money in the store instead if you can not a.c. you will get a bonus cosmetic that you can only get by purchasing thru the platform (ps, steam, xbox) store instead of the dbd store.

Okay I feel a bit better lol

SC heal is so slow that it isn't worth running IMO just take Bond or a medkit

---
The difference is that gens being close together in the end can be prevented if the survivors are smart where they repair gens, wheras infinite bloodpoints wouldn't be able to be prevented. I agree that in this point of the game, the cap should be raised to at least 10k per catergory, but having NO cap is a bad idea.
---
And then they all skedaddle.
---
Well, it's not like the game explains it anywhere. The only way to know is to be told, watch a YouTube video, or play Hag yourself. You're not an idiot.

Did you even read my posts? I've been playing this game for around 2 years now and as I said, while I'm not a top tier player I normally have a good balance between wins/deaths against pretty much every killer.  I'm not even saying that a specific property of Freddy needs to be nerfed because as I said, he doesn't even look that good on paper, all I'm saying is that after losing for around 30 times straight that something is going wrong, whether it's the killer or matchmaking. I've even admitted that I might've been simply unlucky. Throw a billy, nurse or spirit at me and I'll escape half of the time like it's supposed to be in a balanced game. With Freddy it's been 100% losses so far.
---
Probably yeah lmao, welcome to 2019 the year where nobody can make jokes.
---
It doesnt take away a loop if you dodge the snare. With practice you can dodge around them easily. You do vault a window slower but pallet vaults are still the same speed. Usually freddys are too confident to break pallets. If killers didnt have any way to counter looping besides hoping mindgames work then the game would be boring. Billy can force pallet drops if played right, allowing him to avoid being stunned and destroy the pallet very fast. Freddys dream snares can be hard to place properly, so if he messes up placing them then dodging the snares can become even easier. The whole point of a killer being high-mid tier is that they can make it more difficult to loop or have good map pressure
---
 you‚Äôre both bots
---
they should add a bloodpoint bonus for no mither
---
freddy.  idk who's talking about him getting nerfed, and even fi he does, he's still fun as hell to play.
---
To make the killer so frustrated that they disconnect.
---
No kidding, I'd suck him dry like an otter pop on a hot day.

---
It's because of the freddy rework, this happens everytime there is a new killer so it's gonna take a while for the next couple days. It will die down soon enough though and que times shouldn't be that bad.
---
Oh hell naw
---
It would be especially dumb due to the ridiculous cooldown of it. Moving at 110 to justify 1 teleport every minute (that also goes away in endgame) is the height of shitty design
---
I was gonna say that‚Äôd be a problem when you‚Äôre slugged but...
---
no, they removed hatch grab.
---
Using this perk is going hardmode, you should get high reward for such a risk
---
Yeah this is just really weird imo.
---
The only counter to noed is to cleanse the hex. You have 2 options: power gates, see the killer has it, find the glowing hex. Or, cleanse all 5 totems before finishing the gens. With no totem to spawn on, noed will not take effect.
---
If you‚Äôre concerned about noed, and your boldness points (get those mainly from chases), equip small game and look for the totems. They increased the points you get for cleansing too.
---
spillbilly
---
You just proved me right lol he has to be centered on your screen, and it turns out to be above your character. Your characters face was looking directly at him, but he wasn‚Äôt in the right spot on your screen.
---
No, I don't think I will
---
His snare's are a slightly better version of Clown. Clown who moves at base killer speed as well.
---
He's fine.
---
I just realized what this meant
---
The problem is that I don‚Äôt have 5$ Xbox credit. I only have in game a.c. 
---
I might just spend 5$ to get it though.
---
I got you bruv, I got jewelry and funeral invite add ons rn
---
Ah that‚Äôs a much easier explanation than some random words thrown together, thanks. Also lol at getting downvoted for asking a question. I love this place!
---
To everyone who has unhooked me with hag around: I‚Äôm so sorry. I didn‚Äôt know you could crouch to get by her until today. I thought she was just OP.
---
Yeah, I de-pip from dumb teammates all the time.  Just played a game where the first person got hooked, and I started making my way to them while the others work on generators...
---
But this fucking guy has decided to kill himself on the hook.  I get there right as he ends his own fucking life, and now we're left with 3 people at the beginning of the game instead of four.  
---
After that, it was easy murder time for our killer.
---
fairz
---
Cool I just might.
---
I think that they're losening up due to the near release of their new game, back for blood, which is basically the spiritual successor to left 4 dead. I would imagine they want to release the game on consoles for those extra sales.
---
Does he stream?
---
&gt;I'm comparing "They stated the character was like this, and people erroneously assumed that would never chage" to "They said you could earn it until this date, and people erroneously assumed there would never be another date when you could earn it."
---
1) No one who has ever played a game before would assume aspects of the game/character wouldn't ever change. So still the comparison makes no sense me, it feels like you're just grasping at straws.
---
2) It wouldn't be 'erroneously assumed' because they stated you can get it for free in the event, and then you'd have to pay for it. If they go back on that statement, the players wouldn't have just assumed incorrectly, the devs would have just lied.
---
The difference between the comparisons is the devs never stated that a character would stay the same forever. But they did state that you could get the cosmetics for free and then you can no longer get them for free after the event ends.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what kind of moron would say that. If anything, it‚Äôs a benefit to the team since you don‚Äôt have to go to your buddies and, in turn, alert the killer to both of your locations because of all that loud groaning.
---
Survivor: David (or high ranks Laurie because your gonna get targeted), killers: nurse (or high rank leigon/trapper because the survivors will treat you like a joke)
---
I really hope cyberpunk can get me to play this game less :D
---
As a killer when someone hits me with a bamboozle I know my head at them at a dropped pallet. Then I solemnly  vow they will be hooked!
---
When the game came out Nea wasnt even in the game. Shows how new you are, lol
---
(I'm the Ghostface in the clip btw)
---
I often get up to 75k bloodpoints as Leatherface. How is that underwhelming, people?
---
Honestly?
---
Easiest: Claudette (just stealth and wait for your team to do everything/ the hatch to open), killer: low rank clown or Myers )because no one knows how to fight them at low ranks)
---
I have 90 hours and didn't know it either.
---
Lol don't worry, there are a lot of really small things like that the game doesn't tell you about with every killer- like how the red icon at the bottom right means how long you have till you can throw down a pallet again with doctor, or how you can break a Trapper's Traps with Saboteur and they'll disappear for 3 minutes.
---
His grammAr is fine?
---
I thought i was a hero when I found the NOED totem somewhat near the gate and started cleansing instead of running to the gate a teammate was opening. The killer found me right as i cleansed and it turns out my teammate DIDN'T OPEN THE GATE so we died anyway
---
Whenever I stop crouching on a hag trap, even when standing still, I trigger them :/
---
Odd. Guess I‚Äôm just shit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
I don‚Äôt normally miss attacks on other killers which is why I asked, ty for the reply
---
...you wut now?
---
They removed it
---
know your trolls guys
---
That‚Äôs not saying much
---
I knew employees did voices but I couldn't hear his in David's grunts. I'm surprised.
---
Was the nurse lagged out or just being a campy tunnelier waiting till you finshed
---
And even with seeing this zone that you have introduced me, he entered this without being obstructed several times in the video- with no sound effects hinting at the start of a reveal. 8-9s no obstruction and still in this rectangle, and 12.5-14 seconds, still no hint that I am revealing him despite being in that zone on my left. Mind you even when he is "obstructed" like you say while I am looking at him he's not even fully covered by my character. Why are you defending this so hard? I can show you another clip of him in that same zone in that same match with no indication that I'm revealing him.
---
Nope, can't grab on the hatch anymore, but you can close it before they jump in if it opens with both of you there. If the survivor's on an open hatch, though, you're only chance is to try closing it and hope they screw up.
---
&gt; The difference between the comparisons is the devs never stated that a character would stay the same forever. But they did state that you could get the cosmetics for free and then you can no longer get them for free after the event ends.
---
They didn't say the event would never happen again, and they didn't say it wouldn't be offered in any other events. You were able to get it free after the event and you did have to pay for it after the event ended. Just like the assumption that a character would stay the same forever, the assumption that the cosmetics would never be offered again is unwarranted ‚Äî they didn't make any promises that final.
---
the moment u tried to fake haunting but u realize your playing billy.
---
Oh yeah you can definitely save fellow survivors from campers if you work together. Just know how/when to take a hit and run borrowed time.
---
That said, often times you're better off just going to work on gens
---
She is still really ugly, and yes, thats what community thought of her at the time, but after saminations first animation, this subreddit was flooded with nea is a killer jokes and memes. If he didnt created it, then at the very least made it popular.
---
KYF
---
Has anyone ever seen those Thirst Tweet videos? Stefan should do that, but take all the thirsty comments from Twitter and Reddit and steam and the forums. I bet there's a TON. Shit there's a few in this thread lol.
---
This looks pretty cool. :)
---
Killer queue times are normally okay on PS4, but the new Freddy rework has more people playing him. Plus a lot of people got tons of gateaux on their killers from the event that they‚Äôre still using. Give it a week or so and I‚Äôm guessing killer queue times will go back down.
---
Clown is the most fun to me. Hitting a survivor with bottle and ruining loops is amazing. Also pop goes the weasel feels amusing
---
Didnt they say a while ago they had no intention of voice chat?
---
I know its a joke, but no.
---
haha get it guys because nea is a killer haha im so funny
---
As someone who just started I think iller is far easier. I tried survivor and it was so much harder imo. I have got to rank 10 in about 10 hours of game time as a huntress with no meta perks or anything like that.
---
We in this learning experience together then
---
If you understand how literally anything works and ur not a nit picky idiot, then youd get what i was saying but you choose to be stupid so theres reason to talk to me
---
same
---
I mean, I can tell who the killers are, so it's better than anything I could do.
---
Yeah, No Mither still scares me too.
---
It all depends on if the survivors are a SWF group. If yes, killer is underwhelming. If no, killer is scary.
---
I love this style and that's it's greyscale with those pops of red and yellow. Great work! :D
---
&gt;and they didn't say it wouldn't be offered in any other events
---
I'm not going to be able to find where they said it but I'm almost 100% positive they said this during either the last summer event or the Hallowed Blight event.
---
&gt; Just like the assumption that a character would stay the same forever 
---
This doesn't happen. People may buy a dlc because something is overpowered in it but they aren't going to expect them to never balance/update them. Unless the person has never heard of a video game before. Like I said you are grasping at straws with this.
---
No I understand that, and I definitely don't mean to complain. I truly am excited for The Archives, but I just hate the idea of a battle pass. I'm willing to spend more money and support Behaviour, but I just don't think a battle pass is the way to go with this one.
---
I've had this too
---
My advice would be to not worry so much about pipping as you get no reward for ranking up (survivors tend to get better teammates at higher ranks though). Just have fun and try to get a lot of bloodpoints; pipping comes on its own.
---
For 360s, I'd again recommend focusing on looping instead. 360s are a last ditch effort and won't work very well as you face better killers. You might gain a few seconds against a rank 15, but you were probably going to win anyway. Effective looping can gain you minutes against bad killers and is necessary against good killers. That said, I don't know how to do the best 360s, but it does look satisfying when done right.
---
For survivor and killer in general, I recommend watching some youtubers for great examples of good play. My favorites are Monto, Otz, and ZubatLEL, but there are many great players.
---
Yeah, but the rank 2 DISCONNECTED.
---
Comes from buying leatherface. It could've just glitched and not shown up until the update that or you bought LF
---
Not my fault that people from Russia and America decide to connect to me in the UK
---
I hate how you can't undress unfun things for survivors because "gEnS tAkE 3 mInUtEs". Love holding m1 and having no interaction with the killer thank you.
---
Yea maybe something like that. Maybe they just changed something small that had to do with all of those actions. Whatever I just hope they fix it.
---
I love the ghostface lean, just peekaboo‚Äôs his head around a corner and stares at you. It‚Äôs hilarious!
---
You can set preferences in the options, you can favour survivor, Jason, or neither. Favouring Jason nets him like 70% of the time
---
Honestly if you're reasonably confident you can save without just getting yourself killed then go for it. Otherwise just do gens and let your teammates save. Spine chill is good for knowing if the killer is nearby(Most of the time).
---
 If it's Leatherface don't even try it though.
---
ive had LF for a while. thanks tho
---
I don't know why you were downvoted for such an obvious sarcastic reply.
---
Luckily I got all the adepts before they switched his killer adept works. Now I can‚Äôt get adept plague or Ghostface to save my life even though I often get 4K. I really wish they‚Äôd bring it back to the old system :(
---
Good to know, thank you!!!
---
Almost every Pig game I get results in a Pig crouch camping by a bush or box or something like ten feet away from the hook.
---
Thing is, this is definitely an issue with Sony, hence why it came out on time for Xbox.
---
I play nea (I started playing 1 and a half months ago) I‚Äôve only been face camped once and it was from a ghost face that was also my first dc (only dc twice overall)
---
Back 4 Blood isn't valve, fam.
---
^This. Hatch grab is indeed gone.
---
With console framerates and stick sensitivity? You're joking right? If she was so easy on console, she wouldn't be literally bottom tier on there. Nurse works on PC because the frame rates are good enough to allow proper reactions, and mouse sensitivity is flat out superior to controller. Your comment is dumb and the people who upvoted you are mentally incapacitated.
---
Meg is fine compared to Quentin its like saying a candle needs to be extinguished while there is a burning building behind it and im a full on Quentin main
---
i hate this meme now , he is overused
---
Even that's not worth a perk slot in this survivor meta
---
Myself and probably most other killers at higher ranks take note of nearby hooks before downing a survivor anyway
---
It's not the year where you can't make joke, it's the year where people finally get tired and stop uplifting stuff that was never OK.
---
I have only got this to work one time where it ended up with the survivor wiggling out, and my god is it satisfying
---
Did they really? Wow I didn‚Äôt know. Thanks for correcting me.
---
John's robe, huh
---
Perks like borrowed time, deliverance, kindred, and decisive strike can help..
---
However, it still just sucks when the killer does this.  When people talk about toxic killers, this is what they mean.
---
Tea bagging is still someone being a toxic asshole, camping while annoying is a legitimate strategy.
---
True but it does enrage therefore affecting mindset therefore affecting gameplay
---
Ranking up is a scam. There is literally no reward for it. All you get is longer wait times and bad ping lobbies. People often say there‚Äôs more toxicity at higher ranks but that‚Äôs up for debate. Just play to kill the survivors / escape the killers in a fun and fair way and enjoy the game
---
Someone here literally said that THIS is disrespectful.
---
Yea it sucks a lot of the fun out of the game.
---
They made it so killers cant grab anymore when they made the hatch mechanic in killers favor
---
The best advice I've seen for her is stopping but don't use the power right away. Watch the survivor for a moment to figure out where they're going now that they think you're phasing. Then, use it to go there. Understanding where they are around you requires a mix of prediction, watching environmental cues like scratch marks and moving grass, running into them, and listening for them. Once you have a feel for where survivors go, you won't even need to pause unless they pull some strong mind games.
---
&gt;:)
---
"Haha penis wow im 12 and this is funny."
---
\- You, probably.
---
I will (sometimes) dc if I know my internet starts fucking up. I enjoy playing killer but it‚Äôs even better when it‚Äôs a challenge.
---
Every Jane I personally deal with is a gen jockey ninja type that I rarely even see. The attitude you're describing is what I normally see from Kate.
---
Jokes Bad
---
- You, Definitely
---
i'm on ps4 and i've seen some very, very good billies (as well as nurses)
---
honestly a lot of my survivor games *are* hillbillies
---
... Have we ever interacted before?
---
This weird "no negativity allowed" mentality is what is holding back plenty of people from improving. Not everything is good, deal with it.
---
Nice
---
On console his snares don‚Äôt lock onto the ground and stay put while you‚Äôre moving like they do on PC. Kind of frustrating and makes him feel clunky.
---
I'm not saying extend the timer, maybe pause the timer at crucial moments or make it so it's not the obsession perks so the killer doesn't know not to slug you.
---
Megheads leave a bad taste in my mouth since I also play survivor, and Claudettes are generally assholes. The ones in the schoolgirl outfit are the worst.
---
Really? I usually get camping Wraith. I don't think I've ever had a camping Pig. I'm in the lower ranks tho so that could be why.
---
Only baby Dwight because he doesn't like vegetables.
---

There should be an add on that starts every survivor on hook and if you think that‚Äôs a bad idea than I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre part of the problem
---
What's funny about this is that I know this video and it wouldn't be funny if I didnt know the reference. Thanks scarce.
---
I hate that outfit with a passion. I try not to be a Blendette, either, but that schoolgirl outfit is atrocious. I'm just hoping for one outfit on her that doesn't look weird or out of place.
---
Sure, what else do you want?
---
I know right?!
---
please stop asking for new killers to be nerfed before you have a chance to adapt to them
---
By that logic tbag flashlight stunning is a legitimate strategy to trick the killer into tunneling you while the others get gens done
---
i notice most of these kinds of images seem to have a low low rank survivor matched with a high high ranker.
---
I‚Äôll make sure I get my 14 dollars
---
No actually that‚Äôs not how that is by that logic at all. Flashlight stunning on pallets, while annoying is a legitimate strategy. It‚Äôs ok to be good, it‚Äôs not ok to be toxic. Flashlight clicking is toxic because you‚Äôre doing something intentionally to be annoying.
---
Super Freddy sucksssssssss
---
That summer one that got leaked looks cute. If I wasn't such a diehard Bill / Adam main I'd be looking forward to it. The fact that you try not to be Blendette earns you points in my eyes. I'm so sick of playing "Where's Waldo" with those pricks.
---
The color black
---
Rank? If he was high rank he was memeing
---
you know who else sucks is your girlfriend, she let's me nut in her mouth
---
I love using Franklin's on my Hag. Survivors tend to lose their shit if they lose an item, and every second they're otherwise occupied (Healing, Looking for their item, etc.) is time they're not on gens.
---
They also tend to get extremely tunnel visioned on their item. Especially McLoopyPants with their purple flashlight. They go back, see it, and are like "OWO MAH FLASHLITE!" and go over to pick it up, only to set off a trap I placed directly next to it, usually netting me a free hit or at least scaring the shit out of them. 
---
If you play Hag alot, try franklin's. 
---
[Example of the tunnel vision survivors get from Franklin's.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HogwEwuQB-A) Survivors tend to put getting their item back above everything else and it can cost them dearly.
---
Ah finally, a freddy post so i can ask a freddy related question:
---
How does the new achievement work for him? It was "Put 200 survivors to sleep", is it the same but instead of actively putting them to sleep you now just... wait? Or slap them normally?
---
David is the hardest to get the adept achievement for survivor. No Mither is such a bad perk it literally makes it almost impossible to adept other a competent killer. Not to mention one of his other perks serves no function other than to gain bloodpoints.
---
As for killer it‚Äôs kinda very opinionated. It depends on which killers you prefer to play. I would personally say The Hag because all of her perks are hex perks and unless you get lucky you can end up perk less. I would also suggest The Doctor as Monitor And Abuse directly contradicts his power and other perks.
---
The problem is its a perfectly fine "solo" perk but its broken in SWF.
---
If you hate it that much, run small game and hunt for totems. You already said you don't like doing the main objective and you hate NOED, so there's your solution.
---
Youre veat
---
Uses the excuse of no pallets for why he died of course. Can‚Äôt accept he got outplayed...
---
as opposed to the 1000s of reasons you bring up to not ply anything except hte most overpowered killer ever. fucking nerd.
---
it‚Äôs a gen rush build cuz i‚Äôm rank 18 and haven‚Äôt played in forever
---
&gt;If you think nobody gets mad when characters get nerfed or reworked, I'm not sure you've been on Reddit before
---
I never said people don't get mad, hello? I said no one expects them to NEVER make changes. People can get disappointed when a character is reworked/nerfed/adjusted but they wouldn't ever say "I bought them because I assumed they were never going to change them in any way"
---
Yeah, it really does.
---
Damn that looks good. Nice work OP
---
Perfectly cut screams are legit one of the things that keeps me going in life
---
But just because camping is a legitimate strategy, that doesn't mean the Killer is doing it for that reason, they very well could be doing it just to be toxic 
---
IMO that's the difference between "camping" (monitoring the hook) and "facecamping" (literally staring at them from 2 ft away hitting them every second)
---
I have my eye on it! I just hope I can snag it without Iri-shards - my count on those are super low right now. 
---
Thank you. &lt;3 I wanted to start with Jane, but the person who suggested this game for me advice Claudette. He just forgot to tell me how much she's hated and for good reason. So, whenever I play her, I do my very best at being active, not toxic, and definitely not trying to play Hide &amp; Seek with the killer.
---
please check it out and let me know what you guys think! I had a super long battle with the footage and transferring my work from sony vegas to adobe premiere, so there are a few rough cuts I couldn't fix, but otherwise I'm proud of how it came out :- )
---
The only time I've ever camped as killer and the only time I think it's even close to acceptable:
---
When the gates are open, you've been flashlighted and T-bagged all game and been intentionally annoyed by SWF and they really want the survivor you just hooked before escaping.
---
What you think I'm going to pity you guys and let the game end without a kill? no. Happened to me on Coldsprings just yesterday. 3 Bills and a Kate. 
---
I caught one Bill, Hooked him right by the open door. 2nd Bill comes to save him and I down him. 3rd Bill comes to save him and I down him. At this point Kate comes to save someone and then gets static shocked and runs faster than I've ever seen to the exit gate and doesn't even t-bag just leaves.
---
She was the only rando I think, so good for her. Meanwhile the Bill's smoked their last cig on Hooks.
---
It felt amazing after getting looped and flashlights in the face for the last 20 minutes.
---
I thought they were connected? Am I really that misinformed?
---
The Cannibal (Leatherface) has a perk called Barbecue and Chili. Every time you hook a survivor you get +25% bloodpoints at the end of the round, maxing at tier 3 up to +100% (so, you just get double bloodpoints, basically).
---
Dropping 5 bucks on the game and grinding B&amp;C to teachable will let you level any character you want at double the rate. It also has another mechanic for finding other survivors after you hook.
---
I can appreciate this on a personal level.
---
What's the name of this song/theme?
---
Rank 12 IIRC
---
If you just want bp, Legion is a bp generator. You don't even need to do many hooks; just get your BBQ tokens and stab, stab, stab. You'll max Brutality and Deviousness easily. Hunting will be maxed if you chain enough deep wounds as the game values that a lot on Legion. That's 48,000 almost guaranteed each game if you don't care about losing, and you're not throwing the game. You can still kill survivors as they waste time mending, but I liked to let them go so everyone gets a ton of bp.
---
Another controversial piece of advice for bp is not running Ruin. Again, you'll likely lose more, but the games will go quicker, getting you into the next match faster. I'd rather get 20,000 in 5 mins than 30,000 in 10 mins, but your experience may vary.
---
Other good bp killers include, Hillbilly and Shape, but neither can get it as fast and easily as Legion.
---
Literally just do the BBQ summer event.
---
Have you ever gone against a 4 man balanced landing SWF on haddonfield? Its possibly the worst example of balance I have ever seen.
---
You don't think it's disrespectful?
---
Hey man can you dm me or post the original one that you had before you added ghostface
---
I'd take a buff on Dream snares if it would mean that Dream pallets had some tell to help you figure them out.
---
Flash light clicking to get the killers attention off someone else is a legitimate strategy. Especially if you got it macro‚Äôd to click 20 times in half a second. Boy they can‚Äôt resist it, it‚Äôs like a dog whistle for killers.
---
Idk if the entity obeys the rules of space and time.
---
Nah the sprint burst was pretty busted.
---
I mean yeah obviously how could I have been so stupid.
---
Dude you‚Äôre the killer, you‚Äôre supposed to kill people. There‚Äôs no way to do it right or wrong, you‚Äôll still get flamed by survivors. Just play the game, and hook em all til they die, or mori the bastards.

Well first off DBD canon isn‚Äôt canon to any of the movie tie ins and secondly you don‚Äôt need to be dead to enter the realm of the entity, it literally just picks you up from your reality and yeets you into purgatory.

Doesn‚Äôt really matter. Camping isn‚Äôt toxic. Facecamping is. Facecamping is the killer equivalent of teabagging.

Uh, last time I checked I meant this as a Joke. Nothing more.

Where do you get info like this just wondering wanting to do research on killers myself since all of them are hella interesting
---
Exposed with tier 1 Myers?
---
Oh hell yeah. If they were being toxic assholes then I feel its justified too. I personally don't camp because they could gen rush me or open gates but I completely understand if you do. I do tunnel toxic players though. 
---
However in this round no one was tbagging and no one had a flashlight. Just baby killer antics.

---
we also tried showing this to the sub before, but I had messed up the title and a few things in the vid. it didn't communicate the vibe we wanted is all!
---
if your goal is to farm then that's fine, though letting their teammates heal them back up will get them more bp whereas picking up a survivor and letting them wiggle off doesnt get you any bp
---
This
---
There's no rules behind farming. If survivors wanna farm, they risk the killer killing them. You have no obligation to farm.
---
That said, what I do when there's multiple +100% offerings is play normally but try to only 2 hook survivors. By playing normally, they don't need to risk me betraying them
---
YEET.
---
I'm not worrying about canon, it's just a bit dark to suggest that in this canon that's Steve's fate.
---
Not bad besides the exit gate that spawns behind the fence in one of them. If a trapper places all of his traps right there you have to run ALL the way around the school/fences to get to the other side.
---
Not really an issue but if you are in a chase..... your pretty much dead :) smart move there Mr Trapper.
---
Not a bad idea on paper but seriously how many survivor uses aura perks for killer?
---
True camping is also very punishable people just t bag at the exit to fuck with the killer hella toxic
---
The injured music is the sole reason I dont play with it anymore
---
Did you just compare camping to SWF on comms?  Lmaooooo
---
Actually, it took 21 seconds
---
As long as u weren‚Äôt an asshole about it calling him ‚Äòtrash‚Äô or ‚Äòbaby killer‚Äô then he‚Äôs probably just salty at it. Also you don‚Äôt know his situation, could be his only current perks after prestige? Or maybe he‚Äôs new to the game? Could have been low rank? Or maybe he doesn‚Äôt have the right tactics. As long as u didn‚Äôt knock him down for that I can appreciate you trying to help him
---
You could do it faster if the KYF had 3 other people that got killed
---
Okay many thanks
---
He lied to us :(
---
Can't imagine how it looks like when it's facing you
---
*click* Nice
---
I honestly feel the same
---
If any killer perk is toxic it would be rancor imo
---
Yeah if they place the trap right below the hooked survivor and either of you DO NOT hold crouch the entire time (while unhooking or BEING unhooked) the trap will be set off
---
Well just liking camping is situationally either toxic or not toxic, so it tbagging / flashlight spamming
---
Doing it on a noob killer who clearly has no chance is toxic, but doing it against a fair match to try to get their attention / get them off your friend is a legitimate strategy
---
You can't have your cake and eat it too
---
Thanks for all the advice fellas. I'll put it to good use.
---
Ive had survivors just hide and make the game take 30 minutes.  Ive never had a killer take more than 5 or 10 when we're trigenned
---
On So Real Shit
---
In what way is that outplayed? He had 0 chance lol no gameplay involved.
---
Only in the sense that they suck to play against.  But if you wanna kick that horse, they're also both legitimate as far as the game is concerned.
---
I'm happy you enjoy her, but I can't. I play PS4 Pro on a 48" LCD TV and like to play something of a rotation. Basically, I'll play two rounds as Survivor, then play as the Killers I faced, with my builds. As such, I wouldn't really get much practice in as her.
---
When I play as Huntress, I feel as though I'm fighting against her design in order to succeed, rather than working symbiotically with her.
---
Worst part is, I used to enjoy playing her. Since her nerf last August, though, I've had maybe a half-dozen fun matches with her and the rest have been utterly miserable.
---
the entity does not go it goes to different universes and times
---
Hey great job. Go out and treat yourself, you deserve it.
---
By farming their teammates I mean unhooking when I'm right next to them
---
For me, killer takes about a minute and survivor can take up to 10 or so.
---
Yeah it's terrible
---
i just go "as you wish" and tunnel the fuck out of the obsession
---
I got a 3k but by farming I mean unhooking when I'm right next to them. I never let anyone get an easy game unless they're good at the game.
---
Unpopular but I love playing on The Game as survivor and killer, I like being inside for whatever reason.
---
i mean if your goal is to be a nice guy then letting them wiggle off is all right, but you're not obligated to do that. usually when someone farms their teammate i just chase them instead of the guy they farmed
---
If you play with friends, screw you. Very cool.
---
The licensed maps are my favorite so I really love the game, Haddonfield and Badham.
---
It says much to me
---
It only spawned because someone completed a gen or a fellow survivor died. Which is it?
---
He was running Haunted Grounds.
---
By not revealing the ghostface, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a killer who‚Äôs power can‚Äôt be stopped by survivors, (eg wraith). I can‚Äôt blame him for losing the chase but it‚Äôs his fault he got knocked, not the game‚Äôs as he blames the pallet spawn, even though he wouldn‚Äôt have been in that situation without ghostface being smart and outplaying him.
---
Literally the most broken m1 in the game, literally ignores windows.
---
And they are one to talk
---
Ofc you're hatch camping
---
Run dying light. Thatll teach em üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah but with the liquid system people would typically suicide once they capped out resulting in the entire team getting fucked over. It was a breath of fresh air but it almost entirely ruined the survivor main objective. I just think that any secondary objective they add for an event should tie into the main objective in some sort of way as to not make the secondary more desirable then the primary.
---
Mostly from the wikia and the characters info you can read the game.
---
Katie
---
Nah if you let them wiggle off your back they can get away. Better to knock them down again and hook them up you can secure your kill. 
---
That is, after all, the objective.
---
Probably because he came off as a cunt
---
Macmillian estate might be my favorite too. I like red forest too kinda
---
Which is... What I said.
---
Google
---
Should have used white text so we can see the text clearly
---
Holy shit, is that a motherfuckin JoJo reference?
---
Yoshi‚Äôs island
---
thanks \^\^
---
unironically this would be a god tier killer idea
---
Ah, gotcha. You're still under no obligation to let them go, but it sucks to be farmed like that. I usually slug them and try to get their farmer, but if you gotta kill them, it's not your fault their teammate basically killed them.
---
It's the music that gonna play when survivors teabag in exit games
---
Had trouble in school then?
---
And if they complain then they are brain dead as that‚Äôs the style gameplay you ask for when you run that perk
---
Hope is fine how it is. That rework is broke af.
---
Nicole for the win!
---
Oooof right in the feels. Always make sure I send them a aggy message after game
---
Have you played solo yet lol. I mean we do have end game. I don‚Äôt know how else someone could hold the game.
---
I've been having this problem where the ping is fine before a match starts when I'm playing killer, it ranges from like 30 to 100 for some of the survivors, then suddenly in the match everyone is lagging everywhere. I'm starting to think its not my internet because dbd only uses like 0.1 Mb/s in task manager and I have 3 Mb/s up and down, and I have a wired connection. But my CPU and GPU is at like 100% because laptop and I think that's whats causing it to act like that. Or its just comcast being comcast and I can't do anything about that.
---
Thats actually hysterical
---
How though. It‚Äôs the same but there you just get more use out of it right. It‚Äôs progressive as the game goes on instead of right at the end where it‚Äôs not all that needed. I feel it‚Äôs a pretty bad perk as it is
---
Oh I see I haven‚Äôt had that problem yet but I can see how that would be annoying
---
Just more Bp for me the more I hit them :/
---
You did good, ignore all these try hards and have fun with the GAME as you should (:
---
Im not touching the NOED comment. NO mither should be just exposed status. The monsterous shrine reowrk is just as useless the original perk. Leave hope alone its fine. Insidous is fine, its made for people who arent a SWF. Leave mettle as it is, it was broken when first introduced. These changes are only survivor sided they dont benefit the killer at all.
---
&gt;not using spine chill
---
Pathetic.
---
Yeah, unlike Iron Will it does affect the sounds while in the dying state.
---
Sigh more clowns without knowledge about how internet, ping, and distance works.  I've had plenty of games against people across the Atlantic that are not laggy.  Because the killer didn't have shitty internet.  Rubber banding only happens when someone has an unstable connection(ping jumping from 120 to 220 for example).
---
Removed we ask you take a part in this sub before advertising your channel thank you
---
Time is meaningless in the Entity's Realm. It's impossible to tell who came first.
---
You have no clue how ping works
---
I disagree that its broken, but that's not the argument here.
---
Please don't tell me the 100 deviousness was from letting 2 people bleed out on the ground lol
---
I thought so as well but I'm also probably always moving a bit now that I think of it. Maybe I'm releasing crouch before I stop movement.
---
The game for 4 other people that also bought the game.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôve watched your video a few times and compared it to the reveal diagram, and you just didn‚Äôt have him in the right spot. I‚Äôm defending it because there‚Äôs too many people in this community that holler that things are broken when they just don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. I know that, at times, the reveal doesn‚Äôt work correctly, but in the scene you showed, it didn‚Äôt work because he wasn‚Äôt in the right spot. I‚Äôve played many, many games where the reveal worked without any issues, and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve practiced playing against him (as well as playing him). I know it can be frustrating, but I‚Äôd suggest practicing it in KYF or something. The very clip you provided as evidence is one in which he had been obstructed and out of frame the whole time.

Believe it or not, your objective is to have fun. If OP had fun by bringing justice to an asshole survivor while letting one go, then he did his "job"
---
I've met some super sweet people in this game
---
I've been a salty angry bitch who ranted in post-game chat about what a f\*cking shitbag the other side was (both on Killer and Survivor)
---
I recognize my mistakes and have realized that I do love this game despite all the problems its undergoing.
---
If you don't like how the other side played, at the most put 'GG', at the least just leave when you're done and ignore it.
---
Let's not tea-bag at gates as survivors, let's not smack the last survivor to be hooked until they're dead.  Let's not tunnel or camp or worry about winning or losing.
---
Let's just have fun with this game.
---
Well then you'd have to ask if all that is worth losing 1 health state and the choice about being slugged is completely up to the killer. I think it's worth it since having to run iron will is such a waste just to GUARANTEE the killer cant find me instantly is a decent buff by its own accord.
---
If you have nerves of steel, teabagging should not affect you as killer. Just play like always because that survivor wants you to get triggered so that you facecamp him, then the other 3 escape and you get an easy depip.
---
But it‚Äôs unacceptable and unnecessary BM. Then these same survivors complain when the killer camps or tunnels them. It can even affect you as teammate of that survivor as well, because it can ruin your game m.
---
What map is this? I‚Äôve legit never played it üò≥

Hope is  pretty useless right now (hence why it isn‚Äôt used), I feel my Monstrous Shrine rework would be great for trap based killers and Insidious is literally just for camping as it is and my rework makes it stronger directly contradicting what you said about not benefiting killers
---
For the rest of the week. Damn.
---
Dunno. Camping basement as LF waiting for someone to go down there and then face camping him would qualify as toxic in my book.
---
DCing as survivor if you dislike the killer choice is also pretty toxic.
---
sTOp cAmPIng tHe HOoK
---
god damn i wish i could have mained Keanu's look-alike but it's too late, i am maining PINK GOD now and i'm hoping like hell that someday all of Jeff's perks will appear on the Shrine, Aftercare looks so godly
---
RRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You dont see a problem with giving survivors a stackable 2% speed boost every time a gen is done? That would be far and away the most powerful survivor perk in the game. 
---
Hope is a fantastic perk in its current state. You suggest its not needed at the end game, id argue thats exactly when you need it most. When you reach the endgame you are likely on or near death hook, and there are necessarily less pallets on the map. Also, getting caught and being hooked in the end game is more dangerous because the killer is more likely to camp you.
---
Thanatophobia because he can apply the injured state to multiple survivors quickly.
---
Hex: Ruin( or sloppy butcher) to slow the game down.
---
Discordance(or BBQ): legion benefits from having multiple survivors near each other.
---
Bamboozle: only use it when it's tier 3, increases legion's vaulting speed for windows and pallets(only blocks windows) so it's pretty good.
---
I see hope use a lot lately actually, you shrine reowrk doesntbwork because if it doesnt block windows while the killer is there they can just bum rush a hook and all get away. Like I said the perk is designed for non SWF. It works perfectly for people not play SWF, you reowrk doesnt buff anything about the perk.
---
Sure.  But if you camp every game you're a cunt.  Camping sometimes is just the right strategy, but if it's your go to strategy you're actually trash at the game and don't know how to adapt.  There's nothing wrong with preferring SWF every game.
---
NOED is in a weird spot where it's very strong and the only reason besides Thrill of the Hunt and points to cleanse dull totems, which are the only other objective beyond generators. It makes the game into a bad balance of rushing gens or taking the time to cleanse. They need to add something to dull totems to make them more worthwhile before changing NOED too much as the only objective left would be generators. I don't like the current design either, but it serves a purpose even when not used.
---
I like No Mither as it may actually be used once or twice to pick yourself up.
---
Monstrous Shrine does nothing if it only works while the killer is away. You don't need windows if you're not being chased. Now, if it worked no matter what while the survivor is hooked, you create a nice dead zone where pallets are the only defense so long as you have someone hooked there. A very nice idea behind it.
---
Hope would be way too powerful like that. The only reason it's not used much is because it affects a small part of the game. If it worked the whole game, everyone would run it to extend loops and create actual infinites.
---
To make it more useable, just make it so the survivor starts the trial healthy, but the first time they change health states, it makes them broken, regardless of what causes you to change health states. 
---
So if you would get insta‚Äôd it‚Äôs resisted, but after that you remain broken. The survivor still has to play on hard mode for the remainder of the game, can still pick themselves up over and over (implying anyone past rank 15 slugs a NM) and leaves no blood but the killer doesn‚Äôt have to ez mode tunnel you down because one hit lmao. 
---
If anything it should also turn the ‚Äúinjured‚Äù music off completely just because you are not hurt in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared and should be weary‚Äù way. You are just a badass and tune that pain out.
---
The way I see it, as I play both survivor and killer about 50/50 although lately I‚Äôve moved to killer a bit more because it‚Äôs more fun when you ruin a swf 
---
Anyways, let‚Äôs look at this from a survivors perspective, the entire purpose of the game is to finish gens, power the doors and escape. If you have team mates alive, you obviously want to do what you can to get everyone out, so you go and unhook them, if they‚Äôre hooked.
---
If you as a survivor unhook someone with the killer around, you should do what you can to take a hit for the person you just unhooked so they don‚Äôt get farmed. But I mean if you‚Äôre stupid enough to unhook someone with the killer close by, you‚Äôre a complete idiot. 
---
Now for the killer perspective. My goal is to kill 4 people who are doing gens. Oh what‚Äôs this? A huge fucking made up rule book on how I should kill 4 people? Oh and if I don‚Äôt follow I‚Äôm a pos griefer? 
---
Obviously the more people alive, the less chance of you the killer finishing the game. So when you down someone and hook them, you go off to find others, but in the back of your mind you know someone is close by to unhook the person you just hooked. When they do unhook someone you have one of 2 choices, go for the person that was on the hook, or go for the person that unhooked that person. Now survivor handbook says you do neither, and you go off and look for the other 2 people, allowing the unhooked and unhooker to escape to heal and start on gens. Why may I ask, is this something as a killer you would do? The goal is to kill all 4 people, if you go after the one that just got unhooked, that‚Äôs their second hook, and they either have to be unhooked again (to which you simply take them out the third time) or bleed out on the hook. This puts you in a now 3v1 situation where there‚Äôs one less person doing gens, and the game is now closer to you winning. People say tunneling is bad and you‚Äôre a bad killer if you do it. That‚Äôs quite the opposite, your only goal as the killer is to kill. Your goal isn‚Äôt to bend over backwards for survivors making the game easier for them.
---
Now this is entirely up to you, if someone dcs early on and leaves the survivors in a shitty situation, yeah go ahead and be a good person and let them escape, hook em twice and get your points, but I mean at the end of the day you don‚Äôt have to follow along with what anyone tries to tell you. You bought the game with your money, you play that game however the hell you want to.
---
I must be the only one that uses the come here emote as a taunt.
---
teabag at exit after genrush is toxic
---
ü§£
---
Now that the Tf2 economy is fucked, left 4 dead is all they got left.
---
Probably not and ace
---
Those are both actions, and they're toxic, yes.
---
Answer: ye
---
This is one of my friends then he complains about dieing first because he always gets caught and doesn't learn how to outsmart the killer or dodge killer in the first place
---
we could also take the extra step and have the christmas lights on year round (please)
---
Aftercare is SUPER fun to run!  Because it means you want to be altruistic and others get rewarded for it.
---
Honestly, it's a bit OP when it comes to SWF (but like most things are?) because you can see the other person anywhere on the map, but I really do love the perk &lt;3
---
If I have a key, I'm going to look for that damn thing. Also, does black ward still protect dropped items?
---
Most experienced killers know hook spawns and know which hooks they already used so Boil Over is usually a waste. Except on Lerys...fuck you if you use Boil Over with a Lerys offering.
---
Genrushing isn't toxic, it's playing the objective in an intelligent manner.  It's an unfortunate gameplay mechanic that necessitates Hex: Ruin in my opinion, but to say people playing the game well is *toxic* isn't the healthiest thing.
---
Teabagging at the gate **IS** toxic, however.  It doesn't show how bad a Killer the other person is, it shows how bad a person the teabagger is.
---
Yeah maybe your right, a stackable 2% is a little to much but as a killer main I‚Äôve never seen a survivor utilise it against me. Playing a game with just 3 perks is just making it more unlikely to be used in the endgame as your more likely to die. I just feel like it‚Äôs rare to get use out of it and it‚Äôs not worth sacrificing a perk slot
---
Yeah lets generalise group of players that go in thousands on the basis of 20 people posting in the sub thats a good idea too.
---
I didn't say they didn't have their differences.  I'm not condoning camping, nor will I ever.  I was pointing out that one or the other can make a match practically intolerable or unplayable for the other side.  The intentions behind them are night and day though.
---
It'd be like making the Clown move slower because his power slows people down.
---
And what does this have to do with the actual game...?
---
Username checks out
---
Fat Jesus is our real savior
---
Ok...i said insidous doesnt work because its 12 seconds. Its like ghostface's perk except worse. Its sucks against swf. But is stronger against non swf.
---
Your shrine perk works for trapper and hag. So instead of being super bad its not just super bad for every other killer instead of trapper and hag its just bad for them. 
---
You made bad reworks it happens just deal with it and move on.
---
Doesn't everybody love sitting on a gen, holding M1 for three minutes straight? :^) fun times, as fun as stubbing your big toe
---
i did it with judiths tombstone and fragrant tuft
---
It‚Äôll cost probably around a week of grinding and 14 dollars is ok
---
But improvements, not perfect but better than the current state of the perks.
---
Ok, here‚Äôs the thing. Let‚Äôs say 1/8th of the player base is toxic (I‚Äôm sure this number is low).  As a killer, you‚Äôre going on an average of two games where you‚Äôre dealing with a toxic asshole.  Conversely, as a survivor, you‚Äôll see a toxic killer every 8 games or so.  This will skew the numbers, as you‚Äôre much more apt to encounter survivors being toxic, just based on numbers.
---
It's actually annoying
---
Speaking about lore is Plague, speaking about the game is Trapper
---
To find out the demographic of this playerbase? It's good to know what games different kinds of people are playing.
---
You should really use Judith‚Äôs Tombstone and Fragrant Tuft Of Hair.
---
For perks use Ruin (early game slowdown on gens), PWYF (you really need the speed bonus), Dying Light (gives you extra time once you reach EW3 and kill the Obsession) and another good perk is Corrupt Intervention (again to slow gens early game as much as possible).
---
2 Claudettes, 1 Nea also squadding, 1 solo Jake
---
Did you seriously just bump a month old comment to prove how big of an ass you are?
---
It‚Äôs sad that ‚ÄúHaha he‚Äôs sucking dick‚Äù is still a punchline in 2019.
---
I think this is why the devs occasionally lean towards the survivor side of things more. It makes more sense satisfying 4/5 players than 1/5 players
---
https://discord.gg/sbyqPN
---
This should work
---
Yeah the best way is to use it is to create distance between you and the killer, not to dodge a hit.
---
They arent better. They are just as bad the originals. Except the originals can be used. Like I said you made bad reworks, it happens try again pal.
---
You should cross post this on /r/perfectlycutscreams if you haven't already.
---
*p a l*
---
It must be such a brutal job trying not to piss off 4/5 of your game, while keeping an essential 1/5 happy. I don‚Äôt envy them.  Too much sway and you have a dead game.
---
That's way to much of a nerf for NOED, which is a perk I personally don't even think needs a nerf. At most maybe just some better counter perks
---
https://imgur.com/a/ZbAmJJL I just don't huh. This is literally the images with a transparent version of your diagram over them. Same image dimension, both tall male survivors, etc.
---
You even said youre open to critism why are you responding like you didnt want honest opinions.
---
WRONG. I was up against a wraith with the add-ons that remove the bell sound, and the one that, when he uncloaks, his terror radius and stain are suppressed for 6 seconds. He hit me with a lot of surprises, and everyone else with yoinks. Only reason I survived is because I payed attention, and I had premonition and spine chill. Somehow I got an iridescent survival emblem, however.
---
Make sure you don‚Äôt have any background apps open, which I imagine might have a small effect on your gameplay. But trust me, when your game freezes, chances are everyone else‚Äôs has as well. The dead hard bug where it freezes the game affects everyone, even if you‚Äôre sitting on a gen
---
Have you seen 4 literally even good survivors versus a God tier nurse with or without ebony?
---
I wanted to see more.
---
Up the ante does not stack if multiple survivors have it however.

What happened to Infectious Fright?

There was a reply underneath that misproved me, i'd give it a read as it contains good info

We are talking about power not bp

He‚Äôs still being blocked by the rubbish. I‚Äôm really not sure what you don‚Äôt understand about it.
---
blind the killer ... This would melt the players head off of their shoulders through their monitor.
---
I love The Game. Might be because I love the Saw franchise but I also think it works quite well as a map. I always have fun in there and the fact that it's in two layers adds a nice new element to the picture.
---
I also like all MacMillan Estates and the boat variation of Backwater Swamp (don't remember the name).
---
I do not like any variation of Coldwind Farm nor some of the Autohaven Wreckers variations.
---
Dammit this is hilarious to me because of the image take my upvote!

That's actually wierd. That's definetly a bug or u were playing with friends.

My meat
---
the op's post was his opinion on the dbd sub reddit. i agreed with his opinion. if you dont, thats fine but just let us know your arguments without being offended.
---
jesus
---
Well, at that point, running Franklin's just to bypass black ward is actually toxic, in my opinion, and one of the very few things I'll actually be mad at the killer for if I suspect it's on purpose.
---
Yourell veat on my meat?
---
Doing gens and not letting someone play the game are two different things. I shouldn‚Äôt HAVE to run hex ruin just to make the game last longer than 3 minutes. Come on man.
---
By the grass. Still making excuses. Good lord you are not worth the time, goodbye.
---
All original, i may accept thy offering.
---
What is the consensus on cleansing vs not cleansing against Plague? I appreciate that corrupt purge is the strongest weapon in the game outside the blink division but at the same time being broken and constantly making loud noises seems to be such an impediment to success as a survivor that it's worth cleansing and hoping that no one gets spotted or at least downed for the 60 seconds the corrupt purge lasts. Then again it's so easy for the plague to infect someone that it may be worth it. idk.
---
Finally, some **smart** fucking **people**.
---
Ive done some pretty nasty insidious plays when I find two survivors at an unsafe gen. I get the smack on both players, kick the gen then go pretend to start chasing one of the survivors. I round the corner and stand still and activate insidious. Then just hang out for 15 seconds and listen. The second I hear them tap the gen (or use surveilance) I pop out and get a clean easy second hit for a hook. 
---
It's not super good or reliable but I set a challenge for myself to use insidious for anything other than hook camping and this is literally all I got. The idea stemmed from using wraith and ghostface's powers for a hit and run style so the survivors dont know when they are in a chase.
---
There‚Äôs also the wooden rubbish. If you don‚Äôt want to learn how to do the reveal properly, why even make a post about the issue? Someone gives you advice and a diagram and tells you how the reveal works, and you‚Äôre just being rude because you don‚Äôt want to accept that you simply didn‚Äôt know what you were doing.
---
Ok Stevie wonder
---
Interesting
---
Probably because it requires too much of an investment for most people to bother with it. It needs everyone to dedicate a perk slot to something that gets weaker as people die, everyone needs to bring a purple offering, and the result isn't even guaranteed (even though with Slippery Meat you can get  up to a ~98% chance of success, but that means half the perk slots of all survivors are dedicated to this)
---
Most people will look at all that and go "Screw it, I'll just run Deliverance". The consistency will be more appealing than trying to set up Kobe shenanigans via luck bonuses.
---
And he can also make it so that direct hits with a bottle cause the exposed status.
---
Last night I joined a game with 80 ping which is a rarity in my case as even 120 in Asian region is comsidered "amazing holy kangaroo smacking balls" ping, so I was expecting a great game.
---
 However, what I got was frame skipping the moment I found myself in the trial. The killer was meh, but I played decent and managed to be the only one who survived.
---
I politely asked him to check what's wrong with his internet and in return. He started threatening me to come to his city and see what happens I tell him that to his face, idiot kinda gave me his address as well.
---
I started laughing and just to test what else he will do stayed in the lobby and got threatened more for my life and a story of how this guy traveled to a nearby country with his friends on vacation and beat up a player there who also had accused him of having a bad internet. I literally fell off my chair laughing.
---
Fun times.
---
Quick and Quiet, Lithe, and Dance With Me would like a word with you lol. Granted you only use it once in a chase, but I've lost plenty of killers with it. If you run the same loop over and over so the scratch marks are all there, then go another direction when you break LOS on loops where that's applicable, usually fucks the killer up pretty nicely as well. But you also run the risk of them seeing a foot or something and not falling for it. Depends on the timing and the killer, but it's totally possible to lose the killer. At least for a bit.
---
The effect activates whenever a survivor is put into the dying state. It no longer requires a basic attack so works off chainsaws, hatchets, locker grabs etc.
---
I made an entire diagram following yours to give you the benefit, and it still rung true, the 2nd through 5th of the photos there is literally nothing between me but the grass, I CAN'T make it any easier for you.
---
They just need to add one or two more perks that change a dull into a Hex so that cleansing dull totems actually becomes a thing. It would help with gen speed a little bit too if survivors actually had a reason to look for all totems.
---
As a former 3 gen Doc main, anyone who plays 3 gen Doc is toxic as hell.
---
Something about this makes me nervous
---
So i just had this match. ghostface did not stalk on me before this moment and was clearly looking at him the entire time. I honestly don't get how to reveal him..
---
That‚Äôs a game balance/development issue you have.  Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing toxic about doing gens with quickness.  Sure, it sucks, but survivors are supposed to do gens and get out. You can‚Äôt fault them for doing their one objective well.
---
I wonder if one leads to the other.
---
 But what about equality!?!?!???!
---
Brave of you to post this on this sub
---
It was a joke chill out
---
Awwwww, sad that the game isn't completely survivor sided anymore? Too fucking bad.
---
Swamp map is called Pale Rose
---
Huntress really needs that speed buff. I think the reason was that she had a projectile that harms from a distance, but that's kind no excuse when you have plague who can have a projectile that harms from a distance and moves at base speed now.
---
You didnt notice that his opinion puts large group in negative light based on posts of few people on this sub? Nothing wrong with that? My argument is that you dont call group X for example criminals because out of that large group 5 people stole something. And yeah lets call me offended because i call out someone's bullshit.
---
Head on still fucking sucks*
---
From my point of view the Jedi are evil.
---
Yeah I loved old Freddy, I can‚Äôt play as new one though, but I guess I‚Äôll have to just start over with a new killer
---
I'd love if you DM'd me it, it looks awesome!
---
Repeatedly revealing him is the best and really only way to counter him, so you have to try but it‚Äôs a tricky mechanic to code and they haven‚Äôt quite nailed it. Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work.
---
the problem is its so hard to outsmart the survivor in a chase when they have it. You need to get really lucky and brute force it, and even then its just rough
---
but i'm pretty sure you can reveal him while working on a gen even though your character looks at the gen?
---
U know that isnt true, they did alot for the game.I understand ur disappointment, there's alot of bugs that compromise "both sides" and make us lost the feeling to play.I actually don't play often lately because of this, as a main killer, I don't have time to wait 30 mins for a match, and then most of times the survivors DC because of the first down of the match.
---
We all expect improvements, and I know they're working hard to make these changes, but the matchmaking needs to be fixed ASAP indeed.
---
I'm so confused
---
They trip all of hag's traps, then complain that the hag is tunneling for teleporting to them.
---
By "forgot" they unintentionally changed the perks and their QA team didn't notice it in time so they only added the "changes" to the patch notes after players noticed them :)
---
if something like this doesn't work i honestly don't see the point in trying and potentially ending up walking into random crap because i'm looking behind my character.
---
Well, the best way to show them that no one likes the pass, Is not buying it, sooner or later they'll find a fair way to get money.
---
I main plague, and tbh teams which don't cleanse have a far better success rate than teams which do.
---
I think it‚Äôs a console thing. Happens a lot on Xbox too
---
Wasn't this exact image posted like two days ago?
---
Ok if you don‚Äôt try you get exposed and go down in one hit. If you do try and it doesn‚Äôt work same thing. May as well try because if you don‚Äôt the outcome is the exact same as if it just didn‚Äôt work.
---
no one disagrees there. If it affected wiggle timer it would be one of the best perks in the game. It would be run  on every survivor. The problem is that those are such drastically different effects. Thats like saying no mither would be great if you could get up instantly. I mean yea, but thats not what it does
---
He's so much more fun to play against than old Freddy. Don't touch him.
---
In terms of human timelines, it is 100% Plague. Babylon was a kingdom from 2300 BCE to 1000 CE, putting her between 4,300 and 1,000 years old. No other Killer goes back that far. While we may not have had access to her as long as some other Killers, as far as we know she is the oldest Killer.
---
how i said "at certain angle" meaning you need to look at his overall direction with your in game character ,even if you work at the gen
---
in way that the perk small game works
---
Yeah i know you're right but losing a match because of this is so damn demotivating. anyways i'll try again next time and hopefully things will go better then.
---
Can someone please explain to me how having bad internet as a killer affects the survivor? I've seen them stutter while I'm completely fine, but I didn't know that it was affecting them. How is this happening? I'm sorry, I'm just really stupid
---
When you down the toxic nea as ghost face.
---
I‚Äôm the one guy that bodyblocks the killer and takes the down if someone close to death is being chased.
---
It works 9/10 times. For me anyway. Annoying when it doesn‚Äôt that‚Äôs for sure.
---
You won't get anything like cells you would just be paying 7$ or whatever it is on sale for a meh shirt

Who the hell even is the hoes above?
---
I cannot give you gold man, but I wish I could. Crying in the gym right now.
---
It happened once with myself last night so I was presuming so. I used it on my Plague and grabbed someone from a locker at the top of the Thompson House and I got a notification bubble of another survivor hiding by the gen just around the corner.
---
I've played Michael with Insidious and I've managed to go from Tier 1 to Tier 3 without Survivors realizing I'm right behind them. 
---
Probably because nobody expects Insidious outside of facecamping.
---
Did the other person?
---
i hate you
---
To me it looks about half of the old one
---
You can‚Äôt be grabbed from a vault if ur at full health
---
If your in the terror radius it doent work nor does it work aginst tier 1 Myers but for example Ghostface you can see him basically right beside you in the shroud and pig while she is crouching. Best counter is run perks that increase your terror radius tremendously leaving the survivor more guessing on where you are going
---
There is a dash it‚Äôs just pretty small
---
oH wOw tHx
---
So what‚Äôs the problem?
---
"I have to actually think about what I'm doing as a survivor! I can't loop her for 3 gens! Spirit OP!"
---
Pretty sure he's talking about like police reporting them not just getting them banned because DDOSing is a federal crime that could give them a decent amount of jail time
---
Players:  please buff weak killers!
---
BHVR:  we need to nerf pig
---
Your a true artist ill pay money for that
---
Sorry to break it to you but If they do that they‚Äôre just messing around. They don‚Äôt want to win.
---
If the killer tries to shroud or crouch up to a survivor with OoO then they are an idiot.
---
It needs to be removed with all the "Skill based loops" now. Killers just use it instead of trying to mind game. It makes the game frustrating.
---
Properly
---
Yup, posted on Tumblr with some other stuff. OP could've credit me but its ok
---
Lol that‚Äôs embarrassing, you completely missed the whole point of the perk. It‚Äôs only a small dash because your completely invulnerable during the action. It‚Äôs used for doges and fake outs. Try reading the perk description before you get all mad at the devs.
---
I Main trapper on console and I notice this for sure and yeah need that bloody coil xD
---
I keep seeing people talking about it, but never seen someone in game having the dead hard glitched or even complained about it after the game. And like half the survivors I play against run it.
---
It used to be performable via a glitch to equip any weapon on any killer back in the day, but this method involves hacking your game to unlock every cosmetic for everyone, even from other killers.
---
This is the result of equipping Spirit's default body cosmetic on Billy.
---
tl:dr 
---
cheating, not worth it
---
Im pretty sure hes complaining that there have been reports that Dead Hard isn't working correctly right now. I haven't experienced it since I dont use the perk.

It‚Äôs currently bugged. Some times you get the full distance dash, and sometimes your character doesn‚Äôt dash forward (although you still get the iframes and exhaustion)
---
Contact your ISP (they might even have an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù number) and tell them you‚Äôre being DDoS attacked. Pro tip: if they make you talk to a stupid robot, keep pressing 0 until you get to a person. This works with any large business I‚Äôve tried, but I don‚Äôt guarantee it. This is also a good step to take before contacting law enforcement, because the ISP‚Äôs information collected will aid the investigation. Do not call 911 unless there is a legitimate emergency‚Äî look up your county‚Äôs non-emergency phone number if you want to call the police.
---
Are u playing on pc? Having the same struggle every game and need some dbd friends for swf
---
Okay so I have no idea if you used dead hard before but before the patch you got a guaranteed dash but now when you do use it the killer still hits you. You also get no dash. I have no idea if that will make sense to your pre pubescent mind but alright.
---
Purple / ebony ones open hatches. The DBD wiki is a great place for information. Welcome!
---
Look up a bit more. I found it helps register.
---
Coming from a hag main at rank 1, the hag is awesome if used right just need patience.
---
Quentins, although extremely rare, are more often than not toxic goblins, especially P3. On top of that, at the time this tier list was posted, there was a large boost in the amount of Quentins being played due to players wanting to abuse the Wake Up! Glitch, which increased all action speed by 15% at all times.

The proportions are messy, cloak apparently defies gravity and the colors and the shading look bad. I do like the mask, it is stylishly messy.

Is that better? Didn't think so, you guys just want a villain to righteously punish so I simply must be a dick, no matter the reality at hand.
---
As a survivor, I sometimes see things like a random meg just running in circles around the generator I'm working on and wonder what the hell is going in that person's mind.

I dont understand the reference but I agree

Sure, you‚Äôre right. Let‚Äôs just nerf every killer in a still survivor-heavy meta. Sounds good.
---
Give them time man. Bill was just released a few days ago on PC. 8 March 2017. It obviously takes more than 2 years to do that. I think they did a pretty good job so far.
---
Relying on Bloodlust for most loops is a waste of time and only cause more gens to pop during a chase.
---
No. It doesnt freeze everyone. They keep running away as i lag and smash my face into a wall
---
It was because of the add ons, not because Wraith is good. When I use those add ons I sweep too but without? Just mori me out of my misery
---
Sorry to break it to you but that doesn't matter. Still a dick move.
---
Yes it does
---
Speaking of this can we please please please just take out the broken key? I get it does have a use in some form but i never use my keys to aura read and it really blows opening a chest to find one of these uselesa things
---
How is nobody talking about Surveillance and maybe even Discordance on Freddy? I've been using Surveillance and it is godlike. I kick a gen and keep an eye on that gen, then immediately teleport back if a survivor dares to touch it. It's shut down a lot of gens for me.
---
Not on controllers it ain‚Äôt. This shit is ridiculous. It‚Äôs like I have a hit box the size of a house dude
---
Move clown now dammit he‚Äôs is not f tier I‚Äôll fight you
---
Am I a woman? Guess I gotta use the tuck technique now to keep the illusion alive
---
It's not a "Survivor-heavy meta" maybe you shouldn't rely on bloodlust to catch survivors.
---
There is a debate between Hexy and True about which is strongest, billy or spirit.
---
True thinks spirit is stronger because Billy can simply be looped by a good player, but spirit is mind games.
---
hexy seems to think Billy is actually the stronger one, because of pressure and ability to abuse the weak link of the survivor team.
---
The snares don‚Äôt slow survivors down as much as the Clowns‚Äô bottles do right?
---
TheLuckyLich635
---
How about Sloppy Butcher and Nurse‚Äôs Calling/ Bloodhound? Or maybe Insideous and Territorial Inperative? Or maybe even Barbeque and Hex: Ruin?
---
I just checked again, my Internet came back.
---
It's always a claudette
---
New Badham is my favorite for killer and survivor
---
Thanks mate appreciate it I have been doing it for weeks
---
I want to spend my 1.13m bloodpoints already.
---
No idea. If not they probably should. The bottles are better for chases, the traps are harder to use and they do less.
---
It feels like the devs really over estimate the distance between pallets lol
---
*killer player
---
Clearly the Entity is calling
---
AnonymousMofe adding you!
---
See, I‚Äôm not the only one. It feels like this game is in beta and the devs don‚Äôt know what to do about it. This game has been out for years and you‚Äôre telling me they still haven‚Äôt managed to fix the whole hitboxes and windows shit. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so hard about putting a mechanic into the game and then polishing it. I understand in real life, a killer could reach out the window and stab you but this isn‚Äôt real life, this is a strategy game. I should be able to run out of a window and not be able to get hit through it, why, because that‚Äôs the whole purpose of windows. To vault and escape. Not to vault and sit there and be vulnerable. So stupid
---
5,5 years in leagueoflegends and i dont even realize that dbd is actually toxic
---
Yup, but a lot of people say its not optimal to run all 3 , however it would be fun to meme around with it
---
Bloodlust relies on you keeping your eye on the survivor the entire time you are chase, othereise line of sight provides no progress to bloodlust. This is not possible for loops that have walls (like T/L walls and jungle gyms, some of the most common loops in the game, as well as indoor maps and most interior structures). I feel that bloodlust needs more consistency, and that is why I believe it should be buffed in this way. Maybe not 20 seconds, but enough time to maintain bloodlust even after losing a chase.
---
Last I heard the dedicated servers should be coming in August. My guess would be with the next chapter release. So just need to hold on until then.
---
Its pretty humorous how the quality of the game gets better as you lower the graphics....im running on a 1080ti.
---
Well people from Russia and America will have high ping if they join a UK game.
---
And imo, survivors do decide to join the killers game, it is survivors responsibility to leave if ping is bad, not the killers.
---
A mod did reply to a thread saying that the team is aware of it, so we'll probably get a fix... eventually. Probably low priority though.
---
It's the last trophy I need for 100%, until Bill comes out.
---
Any of Spirit or Hag can't be "looped easily" unless they are bad. Spine Chill is indeed a strong perk against Spirit, but she still can play around that and still catch you with her power. You waste time to disarm Hag traps ( more than you do with Trapper ) and a good Hag can punish these disarmed traps very well, unlike Trapper.
---
As a ghostface killer if I get teabagged then I just keep in mind who they are and teabag them when I down them. Its especially nice when they're on deathhook.
---
Right?!
---
let's agree to disagree then. the rework made him better but not that much better.
---
Iridescent Flashlight  
---
Ultra-Rare Item  
---
9999999 Seconds of Use  
---
Tremendously increased range  
---
Tremendously increased efficiency  
---
Tremendously increased blindness time  
---
Tremendously increased accuracy  
---
Tremendously increased toxicity
---
I suppose that's fair.
---
It's soo fun to lose all the time.
---
Roaming frothing madness of a chainsaw
---
You have no clue how ping or rubber banding works and it is incredibly obvious.  People don't care about latency.  People care about inconsistent latency.
---
And be looped by rank 20s
---
You‚Äôre complaining about a low-rank killer strategy and I‚Äôm the one salty? 
---
PSA: calling somebody salty doesn‚Äôt make you win a debate
---
Yup, it‚Äôs actually pretty annoying.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt. Most people think that they DC because they got outplayed or something when in reality they are just having fun and messing around.
---
Hopefully they'll rework you too so you'll be more viable to everyone
---
no one gonna talk about how this dude is using monstrous shrine
---
If they rub it in post round. Like "Aw, you mad your black ward didn't work?"
---
I am in Tru3 side in this debate, but I don't think Billy is as bad as Tru3 makes out to be. I think that Spirit is still stronger Billy against good survivors, not with much, but I see her better.
---
nice photoshop
---
You say that until you get your hope devoured
---
Honestly a lot of the killers dont care if the others get out and they depip because the point of camping and tunneling is to intentionally cause another person to derank and ruin the experience. Thats all the satisfaction they need.
---
Bruh üòÇ
---
Well, you can do well with any killer, that was viable even for old Freddy.
---
And yoink em because 8 meter terror radius and no stain.
---
Hahaha that's hilarious!
---
You're crying saying that I must know more than everyone else. I don't. Obvioisly. However, survivors aren't op. It's the loops that were and gens being the only objective. People like yourself that bloodlust and then get gen rushed to shit. Then proceed to complain avoit how "op" survivors are, are the problem.
---
Just weighing in and say I agree that clown should be higher, just based on that his power let‚Äôs him cut down the amount of loops a survivor can get which saves time
---
Do they not realize most want to actually play the game?
---
My problem is the ever changing definition of a facecamp. If I've just hooked someone and immediately spot another survivor running for the save, you can rest assured I'm going for them, and will peel from them to get any other folk who think that they can capitalise on the distraction. The fact that some survivors expect us to willingly walk away from an opportunity just because of their arbitrary rules is ludicrous.
---
I'll reiterate that I'm happy to leave a hook and patrol, but an immediate target sitting nearby for a save is fair game, and if that snowballing results in the hooked survivor dying, that's on their team's thirst for benevolence, not me.
---
Their survival is not my responsibility.
---
Legion *and* Bubba higher than Wraith? No way
---
Just paranoia won't win his matches. He is very bad without purple/red add-ons and he is very bad against SWF teams. His traps also have a shitty hit box and can be avoided with Dead Hard.
---
Other killers are fun to use. I want to have fun with them and use their different powers. Micheal and Freddy can do cool things with their powers, so I‚Äôm considering getting one of them or maybe both.
---
Been working on using Play With Your Food on certain killers, and Infectious Fright is a new favorite of mine. Gonna try both on Pig to easily get 3 PWYF tokens and slug for pressure. I've stopped using Ruin so slugging is good for pressure when you need it. Finished build would probably be Pig with video tape and medical file addons (ambush charge speed) and BBQ, PWYF, Infectious Fright, and Knockout (you know if anyone is close enough to see their aura after downing them). If I didn't care about BP, I'd replace BBQ with Monitor and Abuse for sneaks and Infectious Fright range.
---
They'll just leave the loop when you start setting up the trap, your traps aren't very strong against high tier survivors, so you end up an M1 killer most of the game.
---
In any other context it would sound like cheap stock music but I think this sounds pretty good.
---
Bubba can one shot and legion can frenzy and put them into deep wound but wraith can just go invisible
---
Ok then, thanks for respecting my opinion.
---
i mean if they don't know youre not trying then that really does just sound like youre a shit killer
---
Only *good* Bubba‚Äôs can actually use the chainsaw properly without needing to camp. Legion is okay but his ability is no where near being able to go invisible, especially with the right add-ons
---
For me it is.
---
As a woman myself I can see the shitty double standards unfortunately:(
---
You can still see him pretty easily while invisible
---
That is terrifying.
---
i get that but they legit just importing a model they have into a different console right? i may be wrong
---
I agree, plus he's not even fully invisible so if you try you can spot have m coming still
---
Not from a distance, it‚Äôs easy upclose but it‚Äôs not supposed to be overpowered to the point of not seeing him in general
---
Hag is my strongest character, she's just so stressful to play. The games although usually 4ks, even against 4 mans, require me to turn on a much bigger brain than if I were to play spirit or billy
---
You did reveal him it's just he exposed you right before that. You can tell because his red stain shows up.
---
Huh, guess its different on console then.
---
Idk but I can think of plenty of more iconic duos off the top of my head
---
No you idiot it‚Äôs f
---
bubbas one shot only works if a survivor fucks up and gets caught in a bad place, otherwise it's literally worse than useless. and legions power is essentially just an on demand bloodlust that won't even down a survivor. they're both bottom of the list killers
---
The clown throws toxic gas. It was obviously a joke lmao
---
Not only that but Myers higher than Hag and Huntress lol?
---
You can put it on the steam group, with the artist permission and credit of course.
---
Ebony Mori.
---
Yeah I have platinum just thought would work on this too but didn‚Äôt seem to happen know I know why thanks
---
Bubbas chainsaw works pretty well and legion basically gets a free hit (even though he is cancer to play against)
---
It‚Äôs feng
---
Hag is terrifying once you get that first down, throw on make your choice and you really get that snowball rolling. Plus, if you get yourself into long chases with Hag, you're playing her wrong.
---
Rip Ghostface
---
I run it because medkits have no charges and it's nice to always have a way to heal.
---
Yeah, sure, lMAo.
---
Snares is supposed to make survivors slow vault right? Everytime I have a survivor go through a snare they still fast vault windows and I have no idea why. Some snares I out right in front of the window and they still fast vault
---
Shit I forgot him
---
I would put him A tier or C
---
Agree 100% even when I play killer and hit someone like that it‚Äôs like wow as if I got them then I say sorry about that like they can hear me haha so I just leave them on floor to be healed up.
---
PC, I assume?
---
Either way, I 'd put Ghostface above Myers and both Doctor and Legion beneath Leatherface.
---
Any survivor who complains about dying is a traitor to all survivors. There is literally not enough killers in the game and any survivor who does that is driving killers away and making queue times longer, therefore they are traitors.
---
At rank 12 never swinging should be a big hint tho. If they were misses that'd be another story
---
They are detable, I put Myers higher because of his synergy with Monitor and Abuse and Infectious Fright, which are very strong perks on him, but Freddy also has strong synergy with gens perks like Pop Goes the Weasel, Thrilling Tremors, Surveillance, Discordance or Tinkerer, so he definitely can be higher.
---
Same...
---
I run Witcher 3 on max settings but I get frame drop on medium setting in DbD.
---
Well rights of characters can be a bitch to transfer  as you need valve in this instance to accept it being on a console then you need to wait for it to process then add it into the game.
---
How would it be a shittier version of trapper? Freddy  would still have movement at almost 100% of his speed. Trapper has to stop and set a trap. He loses complete movement.  Freddy would slow down just a little bit while setting snares and dream pallets. Why should Freddy not slow down while using these add ons?  
---
I play both pretty equally these days and as killer I wouldn't mind this or having it break bloodlust while doing this.
---
Yes, this is a PC list.
---
Bill is coming to console?
---
That doesn't stop it being funny to me.
---
I‚Äôm on mobile sorry
---
Remember Leatherface's add ons?
---
Is there really a rework for Wraith or is this jst a bug?
---
Right next to the chat window is a small box with &gt;&gt; inside it. Minimize that chat and you'll be better off for it
---
You just seem to want to be mad at someone. While you still come across as a dick, your reason about improvement makes sense now.
---
That's why she's A tier üòÅ.
---
I agree
---
It was a bug or some kind of lag problem, there isn‚Äôt any wraith rework that BHVR have publicly announced as far as im aware.
---
The state of Oblivion and Toxicity does seem to go hand in hand.
---
I was standing by the totem according to the wraith.
---
That‚Äôs the problem. They shouldn‚Äôt be able to. I know it sounds a little broken but what‚Äôs the point of putting in the option to vault if it‚Äôs nothing but negatives. The only time a window is good to vault is if the killer isn‚Äôt around you at all like you‚Äôre not being chased, or if you have like mettle of man or deadhard or sprint burst and you‚Äôre way ahead of the killer.
---
i agree he needs some buff but he's definitely not that bad and can be strong in the right hands
---
funny, good SWF teams can destroy even a Nurse, dunno why you need to mention that
---
that's good, you got rid of their DH and force them to go somewhere else
---
i play a lot of Trapper and i don't consider him terrible, he's decent imo and no, i'm not in green or yellow ranks
---
no. i dont think i will
---
I know
---
so basically it‚Äôs you need my rights even tho you already have them( because he‚Äôs on xbox)
---
Not really. [Devs responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/chtoja/live_qa_recap_july_25_2019/?st=jykkhhw5&amp;sh=94239f1f) to all the "It's underwhelming for a purple addon!" complaints and argued it's for tracking and Exposed/Exhausted would be "Too powerful".
---
I agree the block series suck arse now. 30/60 seconds of blindness, and 60 seconds of hemorrhage/60 seconds of hemorrhage when even healthy is absolutely ridiculous. 
---
Clown's Exhaustion addon is uncommon, Huntress's most common exhaustion addon is common while her better one is rare, Doc's exhaustion addon is very rare (or ultra rare if you count iri king). Pig's is also Rare. 
---
Note I think this was before the exhaustion not recovering while running change and the devs have been very finicky with Exhaustion addons since, because they effectively prevent Lithe, Balanced Landing, and Dead Hard for the rest of the chase. Personally I have nothing against those addons. They're annoying to have used against you but if the Killer wants to dedicate an addon slot for stronger chases so what?
---
Also for tracking the addons feel especially shit. Most dream snare hits (Besides super clever stuff like pre-trapping exit gate switches, etc.) are going to happen right in the middle of a chase, so they're borderline useless besides the fact scratch marks (and hearing) are super hard to use in the dream world as Freddy. 
---
Blindness doesn't do jack shit and doesn't even hide the dream clocks. Bleeding as a Very Rare is pathetic.
---
oh no my comment was genuine. the "quality" doesnt really matter as long as its a funny edit.
---
tell that to the tunneler's and campers, Survivor's also want to play the game.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
What a lad, thx m8 appreciate
---
Why do you think it has nothing to do with the game?
---
If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt take it. Simples.
---
This is probably the worst type of argument. "these killers are good, and if you can beat them easily then you're just playing bad killers" or, better yet, "even though this perk counters her completely, good spirits will always beat it"
---
That's a common theme in people defending their tier lists on this subreddit, along with downvoting. Hollow points that are said purely by people who never reach red ranks.
---
What're you on about? Snapping out of it is a thing ya know. How could he possibly trap you into the map? Care to give me a scenario?
---
Unfortunate but understandable. When I first saw it I got hemorrhage and mangled mixed up (brain is slow today) and I was super excited. After I realized my mistake I got disappointed. It‚Äôs all good though. I think Freddy is fine where he is right now
---
*cough cough* stop saying he should be nerfed plz *cough cough*
---
i get your point, i don't disagree with you at all, trust me but i want to also prove my point that Trapper is quite decent, i just think he's underrated and deserves more love
---
they said it didnt matter how much you have played, which is very true, i got in with only 60 hours.
---
Sorry to break it to you but if they do that they‚Äôre screwing over their entire fucking team
---
I agree despite the negative thumbs you‚Äôre getting. If there were other survivors around then yeah, it‚Äôs toxic. But like you said, there‚Äôs no one else around it‚Äôs just killing time.
---
I appreciate your honesty
---
The Cancer.
---
Bruh this is too funny
---
Have you also noticed the dim scratch marks issue? Reminds me of when Ormond first came out and Freddy's ALWAYS has this issue, but his aura reading made up for the bad scratch marks.
---
Easy 4k all the live long day
---
No status effect ability can keep you from opening the exit gates. That would be ridiculous. That‚Äôs why there are perks for end game.
---
You got called out for playing an op killer and build didn't you
---
No duh, he got reworked.
---
What the hell is a generator? 
---
-My teammates
---
There is still a large community on ps4. Waits are not bad maybe like a min or two for killer and almost instantly for survivor
---
The is a much larger playerbase on console due to it being ps plus game of the month last August and it's on the xbox game pass now so you won't have any trouble finding matches
---
They have a guaranteed 4k
---
I am a Pig main I still have fucked add ons
---
I'm trying out STBFL, PGTW, BBQ+C, and Surveillance. I might switch out STBFL for Discordance the next time it comes on the shrine.
---
i mean you're faster, if you play the chase straight (especially with bamboozle/brutal strength or enduring/spirit fury) you will end the chase relatively quickly even if you're an m1 killer
---
Guys we have a comedian over here
---
siri define:depression
---
Alright thanks for the quick reply :)!
---
Personally I've got to respectfully disagree with you on your whole list
---
1. Rancor | Makes a little sense but you can only use the best part of rancor in the end game
---
2. Make Your Choice | Only synergizes with it because you know your chasing your obsession
---
3. I don't play Myers so my apologizes
---
4. Save The Best for Last | forces your to go for your obsession even harder at the start of the game because you will be wasting your stacks (of STBFL) if you don't and by the time you get furtive chase stacked and you can now ignore your obsession to stack STBFL the game will be 50%-90% over
---
5. Remember Me | only because it is an obsession stacking perk the actual abilities don't synergize at all
---
6. Play with your Food has the same problem (not as bad though) as STBFL
---
7. Monitor &amp; Abuse | would be horrible because that perk increases your terror radius by 8 meters while in a chase which would reduce the fully stacked furtive chase ability by half
---
8. Dark Devotion | also doesn't make sense to me because your not transferring your terror radius its a fixed 32 meter radius and your terror radius is already at 0 when that perk (Dark Devotion) activates 
---
The whole perk is just to high risk low reward and its just not worth running in my opinion
---
Idk if it's bc trapper is so fast but I 4k with him so often it's weird bc I don't recognize him as a "good" killer
---
At that point just let luck take the wheel.
---
That is literally the entire point of Doctors ability when you are in tier 3, to prevent you from interacting with anything. It should prevent you from opening the gates until you snap out of it and no it would absolutely not be ridiculous wtf.
---
If the survivors blink too there's a deeper issue...
---
Man, no wonder I do well as Hag. Y'all bitches might as well be playin Dead by Hopscotch.
---
No duh, that‚Äôs the joke
---
It sounds...too hopeful to be a dbd music.
---
Why couldn‚Äôt they just snap out of it?
---
It takes time to do that while also spamming him madness notifications and doctor auras of their location.  You think it's balanced to receive that guaranteed time stall and probably location info and then expecting them to be able to open a handle against the killer without being interrupted.  Think about it man this isn't balanced.
---
If only you‚Äôve played halo 3 on the 360 or call of duty.....
---
That‚Äôs okay! It stands for Bad Manners. People being toxic dumpster goblins.
---
All block addons for Freddy are pretty bad. Devs claimed exhausted or exposed would be too powerful and I disagree. (Ok, maybe Exposed, but what about stuff like Exhausted, extra hindered, Mangled, Broken, Deafened, etc?)
---
Yeah but... worse than Legion?
---
You didn‚Äôt DC. I just don‚Äôt play against him anymore. It‚Äôs not ever consistent or fun.
---
That‚Äôs usually how I do it. I will see someone near the hook and they try and run me away. Obviously they have someone else going for a save so I look back and catch them trying to unhook but apparently you‚Äôre just supposed to take the bait and play stupid.
---
Yeah I know how to use his ability just fine. The survivors would have to be absolute potatoes for you to be able to abuse something like that considering there are two exit gates on the map.
---
Wdym
---
PS4 Red rank killer looking for anyone to help me out of yellow ranks with survivor. Happy to help you practice survivor in KYF too. 
---
PSN thekiller490490
---
If you think its "useless" then you simply haven't seen a good hag... You can literally insta teleport and insta hit survivors with it.
---
He has a toxic killer and survivor series for each character
---
Hag is in a good place = I like
---
Your list was good until you mentionned clown
---
He still posts those ‚Äúonce upon a toxic __‚Äù videos that encourage this kind of stuff.
---
I have her p3 but the nerfs hurt her a lot, nobody even asked for nerf
---
Here comes the crapper üé∂
---
Constant bad latency is far worse than intermittently bad latency. You are clueless.
---
For context, he was injured running towards the exit gate being chased and I ran to him and jumped in front taking the killers hit letting him escape
---
But... worse than Legion????????
---
Right? And I understand giving the company time to fix things, I feel that many of us have been more than patient! I‚Äôm really happy playing killer, I love it, but every time I have a bad match, I get spammed with ‚Äúget gud‚Äù and ‚Äúwow you suck be salty‚Äù or ‚Äústop being shit‚Äù. Every time I have a good match, I get told I‚Äôm hacking or ‚Äúproximity camping‚Äù when I‚Äôm halfway across the map or something. 
---
We just can‚Äôt win. üòû
---
And thank you, I really appreciate the advice! I‚Äôve been getting increasingly frustrated because I figured the best way to get away from toxic behavior is to rank up. But _how the fuck am I supposed to rank up if I‚Äôm trapped in a level against Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the toxic twins?_ 
---
I‚Äôve been getting tons of matches as a killer where the survivors circle me and just spam fireworks. I can‚Äôt do literally anything.
---
Both the ultra rare add-ons are the most used but people forget that you can win it by only using Tombstone and J Myers Memorial. However you have to be really lucky to kill at least 2 survivors in the same tier 3 because you can only reach it twice
---
i would  whoooosh you but you gave me more knowledge so you cool(it was a joke)
---
Oh, I have but not for long. The second anyone found out I was a girl, I got spammed to hell. I usually stay away from shooters now, smh.
---
Many people don‚Äôt know why you want the change. You should edit the post to contain an explanation.
---
Bloodlust is made to counter infinites, but you often can‚Äôt maintain the chase around some windows because of how broken chase mechanics are
---
I know it's not the same glitch as OP is talking about, but I keep getting obnoxious bugged matches where I can't trigger dead hard at all and it's so frustrating cause of course I don't realize it until I'm balls deep in a chase injured and go to use it and only then notice it's fucked
---
eh, Those wraith/nurse skins I'm pretty sure are a nod to Phantom Of The Opera
---
i was playing doctor and a dwight tbagged me after he stunned me and i made sure he was the only one that didn't make it out alive
---
He did? I gotta check it out.
---
Yeah it sucks. Play survivor, get slugged over and over or face camped or hard tunnelled. Play killer, get spammed with fast vaults or nasty messages. It‚Äôs obnoxious. 
---
The best thing you can do is try to find a nice group to play the game with. Then at least you can laugh at the bad matches and you don‚Äôt have to deal with being farmed or sandbagged. I used to be solo only and SWF saved this game for me.
---
I have a clip where I did literally that and still lost
---
Lol i really like your Bloody vision perk. Should be added as a perk regardless if they like ur killer or not
---
If left to right is their placement on that tier I'd place plague behind everyone. At high ranks no one cleanses so she's essentially a trapper without traps.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs really true. üòû I need to find a group that plays often. It‚Äôs really hard to find a time amongst my friends where everyone is free.
---
The wraith rework is not even one day out and you already complaining about this perfectly balanced killer being OP. Such toxicity   (;
---
You can ask the support and get a refund if you paid for something twice. I got spirit‚Äôs and clown‚Äôs DLCs on steam even tho I had all 4 characters bought via shards, contacted their support team and got 36k shards back
---
 That would be true if the gates never spawned within clear view of each other. But they do, and quite often.
---
I don‚Äôt really know why you‚Äôre still on about this. It‚Äôs not gonna be a thing and never was. Bring an endgame perk if you wanna keep people from leaving. 
---
You asked if survivors have always been able to leave in T3 and said it makes his ability useless. You got your answer and I just explained why his ability is not useless.
---
I actually agree with you lol. Fuck tunnelers.
---
Have you seen the spirit with prayer beads?
---
I have been playing dbd a few times a week the past year and half and haven't seen any significant drop in community
---
Not all of them should be great, but there should be situations in which running them is justifiable. There is no reason to run Z Block. Old Freddy had great add-ons, in which all of them were good and had specific purposes and uses. Personally I would like the new Block add-ons to either reduce the charge time on his teleport, or reduce the time it takes for survivors to passively fall asleep, as I feel that those would be more consistent with their old theme.
---
Well i didnt escape my first game against new wraith so clearly he‚Äôs op.
---
Im not sure who i would put above clown
---
Pretty sure thats not omegablink my guy
---
&gt;The company can‚Äôt even balance their fucking game properly.
---
That's easier said than done. Half the community thinks killers are OP the other half  thinks survivors are OP.
---
Then you gotta ask yourself: For which group of players will you balance the match?
---
Will you look at rank1 players that play as a 4man SWF? Then you gotta buff killers to a point where ranks 20-10 have no chance as a survivor, especially as solos. That would make a lot of people quit and the game would die with a small hardcore fanbase.
---
Or do you balance it around midtier, then high rank players get frustrated as killer, which would impact the influencer base and also be bad for the games health.
---
They've dug their own graves with the ever growing amount of different killers and skill levels and i doubt the game can ever be balanced.
---
The green key isn‚Äôt bad if you want to run a bootleg Bond with certain add ons. The purple and iridescent keys unlock the hatch.
---
2500 hours try again.  This buff would make it way too easy to kill the last survivor guaranteed in EGC after you closed the hatch.  It is not a smart decision.  You shouldn't make it physically impossible to open a door handle ever.  Which is why you won't see the devs implement anything like this luckily for the rest of us.
---
Typo my bad
---
It should be available after each time you get off the hook. Even if you‚Äôve used it. It‚Äôs not fair that once you use it once, you can still get tunneled again.
---
&gt; it pretty much becomes useless if the killer doesn't tunnel
---
So what counterplay do you want the perk to have? None? The perk is meant to punish tunneling killers, not to punish every single killer you come across.
---
Even the ones that have been here for a while didn't really know about it.
---
For example, I joined the community in 2017, and slowly but surely learned a lot.
---
I feel like ruin is the scariest part of the game to my teammates. Once they see it they just run.
---
I honestly think you did a good job except for hag and clown, but other than that you did a good jobüëç
---
It doesnt really matter if you can or not. The constant screaming and fake doctor auras will give your position away long before you get to a gate to even try. To get a gate alone against doctor you better hope you're tier 1.
---
I try to do that but good survivors will fake where they are going to go and mess you up. Or if they see where you are blinking they will go the opposite way.
---
I guess if the survivor is in madness 3 prior to me closing the hatch then yeah they're probably screwed if I'm using an add on that gives me illusions more frequently but if I find them after the hatch has been closed it really wouldn't make a difference if they're in madness 3 or not the way I see it.
---
Ok furry nea flair.
---
Ah I was fucking around with it on newfred last night and I thought I remembered it behaving a bit differently, but I use the perk so rarely I wasn't sure if it was just my shit memory
---
It‚Äôs because people are still getting used to him I agree he is one of the best killers but not god tier
---
I personally run Ace In The Hole, Plunderer‚Äôs, SB(Switching for BL or Dead Hard soon), and Adrenaline. Lets me zoom around the map opening boxes for people and get a decent item if i escape(which is fairly often).
---
Yep love itüëç
---
Tunnelling isn't inherently toxic.
---
I‚Äôve had a couple different matches now as killer that I‚Äôve been getting circled by survivors that keep setting off those sparkler stun things and carrying flashlights. I keep trying to take them out but I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening. Plus the other things that I mentioned in my post.
---
As survivor, I keep getting sold out to killers by other survivors and other BM behaviors. I don‚Äôt know why.
---
I went from a rank 11 to a rank 16 just last night because I keep getting too low of points to keep my rank. It‚Äôs part of why I made the post - I‚Äôm having trouble actually playing because people keep BMing. 
---
I usually know how a match is going to go early in the game. If I take measures to prevent toxic behavior, I get spammed in chat and on Steam. If I try to actually play, I get bullied by the toxicity. 
---
Just my luck, I guess.
---
Her power is one of the best. Shes def a teir
---
Thanks.
---
Guess I‚Äôm trash with her
---
I'm pretty sure proximity camping means they want you to AFK and let them repair all gens and escape without any interruptions... üòí
---
Yep no problem
---
How do you up vote something more than once üòÇüíÄ
---
This post still apply to that. You can mori after 1 hook or the second hook so it doesn‚Äôt matter because they wouldve died anyway.
---
Pretty sure this is against ToS...
---
Well I was in a situation where I had 1 person on the hook and another 2 survivors opening separate gates so I put the survivor that was opening the gate closest to the hook into madness 3 then went back to guard the hook from the other survivor who opened the other gate only to see the madness 3 survivor opening the gate closest to me.
---
idk trapper in decent hands and knowledge of the map can bump him to b tier at least and leatherface should be be tier
---
I‚Äôm starting to main pig and i agree, addons(except gear addons and difficulty addons(interlocking razor) are pretty much garbage.
---
Sounds like a really OP survivor buff. Imagine chasing survivors in a SWF and having to open a door for 5 seconds every fucking time.
---
Damn right!! üôÇüëç
---
Most of these idiots are 13 year olds who know no better. Relax and don't pay attention.
---
What does that have to do with it being hard to outsmart a survivor with OoO in a chase when OoO isn't active in terror radius?
---
Beatiful
---
And how does that change if it's used twice after each hook
---
You need to kite the survivors into running into you traps and instantly teleport and hit
---
Doing gens you?
---
Most of Freddy's add-ons are bad now. 
---
Hemorrage and blindness, woo... I'll totally use *those*. /s I use Pill Bottle and Paint Thinner instead.

You can use decisive strike one so how secure are know survivor has it to tunnel them

---
Iirc PS4 has a little bit more players then PC. Xbox has way lower then both though.
---
This wasn't confirmed btw, but I had heard this a few months ago
---
It's the same with most games really. I know the whole gamers are oppressed is a meme but the truth is most people who are in high ranks in any game are people who don't have a life and instead play games all day. They are mostly people who got picked last at sports at school or were just picked on in general and now have a superiority complex. This is why they always blame their team and not themselves and BM with every opportunity they get. In comparison in smaller ranks and more casual game modes you see players who play to have fun rather than to appear superior to others. Sadly many casual players also get to high ranks and they have to deal with all the sweat of the vicious cankers that are tryhards.
---
Lagswitch
---
I agree but only if DS doesn't have the obsurdly long timer. It should deactivate if the killer downs another survivor. Honestly even if they hit another survivor because you have to be all kinds of stupid to get downed quickly after the killer hits someone else.
---
Right, but that still leaves plenty of time to teleport to the gen. Or of course if decently close, bluff the telephort to try to scare the survivor off of it and run right into me with no terror radius
---
That's good timing.
---
Not sure how you want the perk to change, to be honest. The perk is fine.
---
Yeah its almost impossible to escape after the Hatch is closed right now.
---
Something will hopefully be done soon...
---
Anyway, if someone is actually able to get a door open in those situations then they deserve to escape
---
Old post but  
---
Jeff gang rise up
---
Everyone involved in this video was a dumb dumb
---
I can't stop laughing at this, thank you OP
---
That literally tells me jack shit, dude. Do you mean you should be able to use it again right after you DS a killer? That there should be no timer on DS after you get unhooked? Just that D'S should be available to use for a second time after you get unhooked from your second hook if you already used it before going on your second hook? You need to explain things more.
---
Imagine thinking decisive strike is still broken. Truly a baby killer
---
People suck. Plain and simple.
---
This post might as well say "you're not allowed to play internet games if you live in a certain region of the world"
---
I struggle with that last part. Survivors swarm the almost finished gen and I can't keep them off of it and chase someone at the same time because they will invariably run away from the gen.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right. I know you‚Äôre right. I can‚Äôt fight toxicity with more toxicity. üòû 
---
As for the ranking, I exaggerated there but you see my point. The rest of it isn‚Äôt exaggerated. But I have been having _literally_, like actually every match for the last three days with high levels of toxicity. 
---
I didn‚Äôt know I could turn off the exit chat, I‚Äôll have to take a look at that.
---
Thank you for the clarity.

The Goodest of Bois
---
you're one of those people who say things like "Back in my day" aren't you?
---
He's not even remotely similar to Hag. His snares act VERY similar to Clown's bottles. They slow you and end loops. That is their purpose.
---
Hag's traps are for teleporting, map pressure and many things, they also end loops sure, but not many Hags will use her traps this way.
---
All praise Thicc Jesus!!!
---
This sounds OP as shit, being able to change map paths like that. it sounds like an extreme survivor buff, like, they lock the on the Macmillan infinite, and the chase was really long
---
What is?
---
Hemorrhaging doesn't do anything for anyone unless you're running Blood Hound. And even then, you'd be better off running Sloppy with it.
---
Like I said, not toxic
---
Was watching my husband play killer recently and he was chasing a Jeff who teabagged at a pallet and we both audibly gasped ‚ÄúNooooo..‚Äù We hold Jeffs to a very high standard. I was like ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no Jeff. That just a Claudette in a Jeff suit.‚Äù
---
I know your reply is 16 days old, but for the love of God, it was an obvious sarcasm.
---
Noob isnt really toxic, if you watch the videos hes just looping, 360ing, and talking a little trash. Nothing toxic imo.
---
new player here, just got my first ever 4K while playing Ghostface :D this image makes me happy :D
---
You're cute in your naivete
---
Advertising
---
I think hes better off now, just his old kit was more creative and interesting imo
---
Definitely not hit. Because one of your teammates could be trying to run interference on a tunneler
---
No Jeff main would do such a thing.  We are a loveable and huggable bunch.
---
That was someone doing a daily and tarnishing the image &lt;/3
---
I never thought of it like that. Thank you for the realism. It can be frustrated for real.
---
Clown has the best method of applying Exhaustion, which is why his "Uncommon" add-on is far more rare than most of his other Uncommon ones. Frankly, the Snares in general need help and Exhaustion would be a good effect versus the pointless Bleeding.
---
Well what else didn't go down well?
---
Using it in the optimal (the design intent) way is after the first hook. Which is toxic.
---
Hard truth. If something exists in the game it's meant to be used. I always found the argument that Flashlights, Moris, Instaheals, NOED, Exhaustion Perks, Camping, Gen Rushing, and Tunneling are "toxic" to be laughable. They're in the game and they're meant to be used. Are they far too strong/annoying? Yes, but it's on Behavior to fix them, not on us to not use them because of some imaginary concepts of "fairness." It's nice for you to not use these mechanics out of respect and the concept of treating others the way you want to be treated (this is why I don't use Adrenaline or NOED since I hate both those perks) but you won't win an award for following some made-up code-of-ethics.
---
Can you imagine how ridiculous it would be if, in real life, you had to stop driving because people without legs didn't like seeing you drive?
---
People still play this game?
---
its annoying i never said broken dickwaffle
---
No.
---
Jesus, lmao. I once had a survivor match with a Billy that was so exhausted from dealing with two other survivors that he just AFK‚Äôd in the corner and let us finish the match. I talked to the guy afterwards and he was just... battered, dude.
---
/r/Ihadastroke
---
Pig on the same tier as wraith? It's a no for me dawg.
---
I like that when it's cosmetics everyone says "It's different teams!"
---
apparently that logic doesn't apply to the events team, they can be co-opted for game health at a moment's notice.
---
If a survivor jumps in the hatch and you're fast enough with closing it, their animation gets cancelled and they don't escape.
---
It actually is because when you put an RBT on after the gates are open they have to remove it which can get you a kill, closing the hatch won‚Äôt activate the RBT, the RBT timer stops when in terror radius or chase, and her ambush isn‚Äôt considered a basic attack anymore
---
Small and miserable people have the need to infect other people with their misery, hence why toxicity exists at all. The anonymity of the internet amplifies it. These people are probably pussies in person so they need to feel big with a wall between them and their opponents.
---
I don‚Äôt think Mori‚Äôs have a design intent. You use them how you want
---
Yeah... dealing with toxicity for extended periods of time tends to lead to mild depression
---
its not even about tunnling a tunnler is subjective ya know from a killer main if you see a unhook 2 ft from you who u going after the one thats closer to being a sacrifice thats injured or the full health non hooked one
---
Especially to the killer
---
Her toes are kinda weird....
---
I called her sweaty because of the add ons  she was using , she was using 3 blinks and omega blinks i know she is hard to play but damn those add ons makes it pretty hard to survive , evenif she was playing on console
---
Just relax, boss. Its hard to identify which side you‚Äôre talking about that brings more ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù and frustration or I‚Äôd have more advice and input that may help you. 
---
You need to realize when to quit the game for a bit. I down pipped (before the newest rank system patch) about ten games in a row as a survivor a while back. I kept playing because I like the game, but it only put me in a much worse mood. I could have easily played/done something else and salvage my day. I didn‚Äôt salvage my day though. 
---
It sounds like you need a break, so take one. The game isn‚Äôt going to die while you‚Äôre gone, and it‚Äôs better to take breaks so you don‚Äôt get burned out. I got burned out and quit for a year. You don‚Äôt want that. 
---
I‚Äôm not on PC, but I believe you can hit the chat bubble icon at the end of the match and it hides the chat. 
---
I would still like to know your definition of toxicity.
---
You‚Äôve gotten some pretty good suggestions. Zubat is the best survivor i think. Ironic becavhes the best killer main
---
Eeh, as frustrated as I am with how easy trapper is to bully I don't think making the Iri stone addon default is the right way to go. It's a lot more interactive to just be able to plop down a trap whenever ya please rather than setting and forgetting.
---
My suggestion to make it so you need a toolbox to disarm traps is a lot stronger than just an infinite bag, as depending on what survivors bring in you could just completely shut down the shack and the bigger loops like cowshed and coal tower. The maps are far too big for his traps to be oppressive, even if he has 8-9 of em with the stitched bag
---
you mean 3 high rank survivors with 1 low rank? even then the killer should be no lower than 13
---
Can someone actually explain the purpose of wearing face masks in real life though?
---
I see it often recently, and especially on Asians. I assumed it was because they were sick and didn't want to cough on anyone?? Or maybe they were avoiding getting sick from others? Or is it actually just a really dumb fashion trend?
---
Play on hard mode for more rewards? Seems fair to me.
---
Pig and wraith are better than doctor, trapper and huntress in my opinion
---
With brown sugar on it? Mmmm
---
yes he is(in a good way) the amount of mind games you can play is amazing
---
Double BP.  Easy.
---
You made me watch 30 seconds of him right now and yea he just dominated that billy lol
---
You‚Äôre really putting Hag below Billy? Billy can get looped so easily. Hag can use her traps to cut them off.
---
Exactly my point, yeah Hag needs set up time as well, but the fact that she can realistically still use her power in a chase alone makes her far more viable.
---
You start a chase as a hag early on and you can still use your power to set up/stop loops, win win.
---
You start a chase early on as trapper and you can just be an m1 killer and hope the survivor makes plenty of mistakes...or destroys most of the pallets. That's worth 4 gens being done right?
---
&gt;Freddy can now walk around slapping traps/pallets that have no counter/way to disarm down willy nilly and can charge a teleport with no slowdown either.
---
You can throw pallets down to see if they're a real one or not. Not effective and an extremely hazardous way of testing, but it's there. And Freddy has a five second channeling time he needs to go through before he finally teleports. Not sure how much more you'd want from that, to be honest.
---
Same could be said about gen rushing, yet people still complain about it?
---
I use it to gen camp when I know a survivor will come back the moment the heartbeat is gone
---
claud's just like fuck  this shit gotta go
---
it does you just dont like it. no worries tho
---
I‚Äôm on console with dips in fps but ok
---
Oh no i ment usually as in not EVERY time but theres gotta be something to do with that that triggers the imbalance
---
I didn't get critical feedback so I wanted to try again to no avail
---
Exactly, it's like they want everything at once, am even started to question the community age due to these behavior
---
Constant 200 ping won't cause rubber banding you moron.  I'm done replying to you morons.  Think about how the p2p connection will act when someone drops packets and jumps from 100 to 200 ping.  Now think about how the connection will act when the packets being sent are consistent even when at a high distance and a constant 200 ping.
---
I also main Nea, but I get a totally different experience with her so I'm forced to play stealthy
---
It's not nothing but negatives. It's a risky play that you aren't meant to be able to just do. It makes logical sense for a killer to be able to hit you through a blank space in the wall if you're right next to them. Why shouldn't they be able to?
---
If you couldn't hit survivors through windows like that vaulting would be busted.
---
Maybe it came off like I was screaming he's OP, I'm not. I've said before I think he's perfectly balanced as if you're willing to use a perkslot for a 5 second head starts (DS) then the warning you get that Freddy's teleporting to your gen is more than enough.
---
The fact that you need to be asleep for his power to even matter also comes into play, neglected to mention that little tid bit, which is why I also said that his trap powers, while TECHNICALLY not having a counter, are still the least effective out of the bunch.
---
What do controllers have to do with your hitbox?
---
a lot of people do actually since the game gets updated a good amount
---
That doesn't change the fact he only has a chase power which is very buggy, while other killers have more tools in their kit ( Pig has stealth, mind games and stall, Legion has free hits, tracking and stall, Wraith has mobility and stealth, Ghost Face has instant down and stealth ).
---
Aha, I‚Äôm trying, thank you. I play both sides so I get double the toxicity.
---
Yeah, I may have to do that. I dropped it earlier this year for a couple months but I love this game and had to come back when they announced Ash and Mr. Bhut Face. 
---
I‚Äôm taking a break and watching Shazam at the moment. Cookies help too. 
---
I‚Äôll see if I can find the setting! Thank you!
---
As for toxicity definition - what do you mean? I kind of explained the behavior I despise in my post and that‚Äôs the toxicity I see/experience.
---
What is the etiquette for how many times we teabag at the pallet
---
Yup. Even got the score event for it. Just got stalked quicker than the reveal.
---
Me all day yesterday lol!!
---
It is exactly like politics. Makes me think of the way things are with people trying to find reasons to look down on others. People are inherently bad, it seems.
---
Plauge is boring, just don't cleanse as survivor. Being noisy really doesn't change much good killers can still hear you breathing anyways. The only thing plauges power does is make chase end quicker by removing 1 health state. That said its nothing really that strong once you think about it. You can still loop her just like any other m1 killer, just don't get hit and play more safely. 
---
Cleansing gives her corrupt purge which is basically machine gun huntress with even more broken hitboxes. Turns her into a sorta pusdo nurse/huntress hybrid for its duration, ie all kinds of no.
---
I think no mither should give one extra phase on the hook
---
Yea but...spirit‚Äôs jumpscares tho
---
Noob3 really isn't bad, I highly recommend you watch a few of his youtube videos before just judging him off of the angry comments blaming him for other people being toxic. Blaming popular YouTubers is easy, and he makes himself an easy target by jokingly having a series called 'once upon a toxic X' imo acting like he is the source of other people being toxic... Well that's really just another face of the coin of toxicity. 
---
Noob3 loves this game and it's community, it's the foundation of his means of income, and he wants the game to continue to be successful and for players to enjoy being good and skillful in their playing. He's good at the game and sometimes against weak or new players he realizes he may be coming off as bullying them because he's a good player.. but he doesn't go out of his way to be toxic and frequently does go out of his way to avoid things that are seen as toxic.
---
Premonition is better imo. The range spine chill takes is just about the same as the heartbeat I think, so it‚Äôs only useful against stalkers.
---
That's pretty debatable. If he throws a bottle directly on the pallet it forces the survivor to avoid it or deal with hazy vision/slowed movement speed. It's hard to read what he's doing when everything's blurry.
---
Also how is he buggy? I've played a dozen clown games since the patch dropped and haven't noticed anything weird.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Oh, I see - yeah, I‚Äôll take a look! If I‚Äôve learned anything, giving people the benefit of the doubt is the least I can do.
---
Yeah, that's why I choose pallets over snares.
---
Very simple: use your traps for map control, defending (3 genning, hooks, totems, ect.), killing loops (they'll either have to leave the loop or give up a free hit), play very defensive, very patient. You're not just a slow M1 killer, don't just run around eating pallets and playing like you would a character without the luxury of your traps. Don't put yourself into long chases, Hag doesn't like those. Hook in the basement whenever possible. Your mindgame potential is strong, don't break pallets unless they're unmindgameable (like the ones on the stair way on the Game). Survivors like pallets, they make them feel safe, with Hag, they aren't.
---
Leatherface, then Legion then. Franklin‚Äôs demise works very well on Legion.
---
What is the unedited version of this pic?
---
I cannot for the life of me remember what Ruleset No. 2 does.
---
But...... worse than Legion????????????????????
---
Switch clown and legion. Other than that, looks good.
---
Alternatively, if noob doesn't appeal to you, hybridpanda is a wonderful streamer and YouTuber. He really tries hard to encourage fun entertaining games and avoid toxic attitudes, and has a weekly video called 'shrinewatch' where he plays a match demonstrating the weekly shrine perks and talks about development news and gives shout outs to interesting stuff from this sub. 
---
I think the most important aspect of staying above the toxic players is to remember that there is more to the DBD community than the toxic people. It's easy to watch panda and feel good and remember that this game is fun and there are great people that play it. :)
---
Just connect a keyboard &amp; mouse to your console, it's the only thing you can do
---
Only primitive people make premature conclusions from nothing. Also, often these can not objectively assess the situation.
---
I am not a salty survivor. 1700 hours in the game, I'm in it from patch 1.3. The first approximately 700 hours I played only on the killers, of which 400+ hours were on the nurse. At the moment I play for both sides, according to my mood.
---
A nurse without addons is already the strongest killer in the game. Range add-ons are obviously too strong and require a nerf. The third blink and more is like ‚ÄúDead Hard‚Äù with easy application without fatigue, it gives you endless second chances, forgiving your mistakes. In the chase with two blinks, the survivor has few chances to outwit you and extend the chase, with three blinks - nothing, provided that you somehow know how to play the nurse. Range add-ons allow you to very easily get close to the survivor and leave him no chance to dodge you.
---
This is not only my opinion, most experienced streamers from 3000+ hours (the opinion of a player with a lot of experience obviously means something), the killer players will tell you the same thing, as well as many players from the forum who also play for killers, not just survivors.
---
Why did I stop playing as a nurse? Because it was too easy for me, I easily reached the first rank several times, even playing WITHOUT addons. Well, let those who know how to play with the nurse - continue to have fun, but giving the noobs an easy victory at the expense of the third blink and bottles at a range - no.
---
And no, if you do not know how to fully understand the game and look at it only from the side of the killer - this is not a reason for honor.
---
Leaving the third blink without a significant debuff means not to change anything in this game.
---
Makes it so that survivors don't see the aura of the boxes to get the traps off until the trap is activated
---
There are uses for Bubba‚Äôs Chainsaw other than camping?!
---
Oh my god
---
Do not question
---
#THE ELEVATED ONE
---
Not Legion, definitely Myers.
---
Leatherface has 3 perks. One is called BBQ and chilli. It shows you survivor auras if they are about 48m+ from the hook, and each time you hook a survivor for the first time, you get a 25% stack of blood point gains. Franklin‚Äôs demise makes a survivor drop their items when you hit them. Knockout makes survivors be hidden from each other until they get in a certain range. Franklin‚Äôs demise and BBQ and chilli are good for Legion, so get Leatherface, then Legion.
---
You just stand there without the red light and with no terror radius
---
It doesn't look like like anything, just if they move and you're near the terror radius immediately turns back on at the same time as the distance is normally. So if you're close it's very sudden and loud. I've been scared a a couple times by it.
---
I don't really know, but its like, their game. They don't have to really listen to complaints unless its game breaking bugs or exploits, they shouldn't be trying to please each side.
---
You made a full YouTube video out of this..20 odd seconds.
---
Come on my dude haha 
---
Was kinda creepy seeing The Nurse in that doorway though lol
---
Shirtless Myers commented this, hiding in the locker brb
---
Sorry i dont speak competotive dead by daylight, i guess i'll train with legion
---
this is what makes Freddy‚Äôs dream pallets alllll the sweeter
---
Alrighty.
---
I usually just hold off as long as I can. In my experience against her I have more wins not cleansing at all, or at least waiting until the very end.
---
Console doesn‚Äôt have M&amp;KB support
---
Both sides is going to get a lot of rage out of you but at least you play both. 
---
This game is just a necessary evil. It claws its way into your mind if you don‚Äôt play it for a while. 
---
Breaks are good. Cookies are better as long as they aren‚Äôt raisin. 
---
As for toxicity, if survivors giving you out is the only thing that you find toxic (on the survivor side), then you should be in luck. I‚Äôve rarely had that happen to me, ever. And it will never happen to you outside of rank hell, unless you‚Äôre doing literally nothing. 
---
My point in that question was that maybe certain behavior frustrates you, so you deem it as toxic, when in reality it is just good gameplay due to how the game works. Most things deemed annoying in this game are very annoying, but it‚Äôs just part of the gameplay. In turn, you might just be frustrating yourself further.
---
Just because you didn't experience the bugs, that doesn't they don't exist. I have a video with a list with all Clown's bugs.
---
Clown just get pallets down quicker, but he has nothing else, no mobility, no pressure, no stall, no stealth, no reliable tracking, nothing. He only has a chase power which even isn't that good. Literally every other killer you listed has something else beside a chase power ( which also is far better than Clown's chase power ).   
---
Spine Chill even isn't a meta perk and you can counter it by not looking directly at the gens. 
---
Still, you can't play around drop pallets as Clown no matter what you do, because they will always get a fast vault on pallet.
---
Ochido
---
I love playing as and against the new freddy. Rank 20s gotta cry like the last time
---
If they just change her addons as they said, killers won't care, she'll probably be more fun to play if anything. Because they seem to make more and more addons that change the gameplay quite a bit on new killers. Like the pallets for Freddy, or Wraith's addons making it so you can't hear the bell, or where it's coming from etc.
---
Except homosexual is literally and definitionally correct, so it's the proper go-to every time.
---
Some of my LGBTIQ+ friends (and acquaintances, and people I've met but not really fallen in with) dislike the word "gay", some because they're "lesbian" (which solves the which-word issue right there) but there are lots of other reasons.
---
Thank you anyway!
---
I agree they should do. But they needed the survivors last time so maybe it's just killers turn.
---
I play both and love were the game is at right now. When dedicated servers come out then it will be pretty solid.
---
Yeah you're right , have a good day my fellow Reddit user
---
No worries. PM me if you need anything else.
---
I phrased it wrong.  
---
What I mean to ask is: What does a survivor see when directly looking at a killer who has insidious active?
---
Same range
---
Turning it on stuns every Wraith player on the globe
---
Freddy was a full rework and needed it badly. 
---
Yeah it depends what they do with nurse.

Just go play Clown and tell me if he doesn't slow down for a brief moment everytime he throws a bottle, if you are not blind you will see.
---
I have heard of many people that (at least on ps4) connected K&amp;M on the console (to play dbd lol), console does not let you by default, so IDK what they did to make it works
---
I have nothing against dirty jokes but this one's in poor taste
---
Once I saw a Myers do this and I knew he hasn‚Äôt left because the gen has only one entrance and his heartbeat was gone. It was obvious he has insidious so I just hid until he left. He waited too long and left once two gens were completed.
---
Don‚Äôt always wait too long
---
I mean spine chill is more of a constant thing, once it's one for more than 1 second you know the killer is coming towards you, premonition is just a "he's over there"
---
Why is melee‚Äôing survivor toxic? I‚Äôve never heard of that being disrespectful. Tea bagging has always been like a ‚Äúpwned noob‚Äù thing. What does meleeing hooked survivor mean?
---
Welp shitty joke
---
Oh they just see the killer, they aren't physically hidden, they have no other animation. It's just no terror radius
---
do you have any idea how long it takes to derank as Killer? Especially with the queue times as they are now?
---
The community pushes its finger in its eyes!
---
Oh yeah. I forgot about that one. Ultra rares are hard to remember sometimes. It really should be base and a different ultra rare should make survivor able to always see jigsaw boxes but give them some sort of debuff(possibly exhaustion) when they have a trap on their head.
---
this has happened to me at least twice, they really need to fix this.
---
Nurse was literally the most hated killer and agreed upon to be OP since her release day. The only nerf they gave her was reducing her original 3 base blinks to 2. She's still broken though and anyone who can't see that has never gone against a decent nurse.
---
I think the point is also to say, the killer isn't to blame in this situation, but it's the survivor who farms. But somehow most survivors don't see it that way.
---
This is actually pretty accurate
---
That is correct. Save your teammates or get the hook.
---
Already getting triggered one day in
---
We'll see how long you last
---
&gt;What? His snares are placed down without a cooldown. He can place as many as he wants in certain areas making him super efficient and less time consuming.
---
You didn't read my post, did you? Point being, that Freddy's snares OR even his pallets don't actively assist him in a chase. Sure, his snares can cut most loops short if you place them correctly during a chase. But you know who can also do that? Hag. But the difference with the hag is that she can instantly teleport long distances or even short distances if she places her traps correctly in a loop. Freddy can also teleport distances, but he gives off a 5-second warning beforehand. The literal count to Freddy's snares is not being a greedy bitch and cutting loops short before he can deploy his snare in a loop to slow you down and get a hit. 
---
Aka: git gud 
---
Another example, if Freddy has chosen to use his Dream pallets instead of his snares, you're suggesting him being a 110% MS killer with only the power to teleport with a big warning and placing dream pallets, which is literally an RNG power just like Trapper. He'd have to first chase survivors with his 110% MS and "get looped" so they drop pallets. After that, he can start putting his dream pallets and even then it's still just as RNG as the Trapper, but the difference being at least trapper can use his traps "at the start of the match" and he has 115% MS. 
---
You're "suggestion" is basically transforming him in the worst killer in the game IF someone decides to use the Dream Pallets power over the Snares, which would essentially turn him into a shitty version of the Trapper and make the Dream Pallet power a "literal joke".
---
No, it's the new red
---
Why were you urban evading in a corner of the map without being near the killer
---
She will be nerfed and she needs to be lol. However, all they‚Äôre doing is reworking her addons and removing the extra blink addons, supposedly..
---
I was playing Micheal the other day. A Dwight ran right past me while I was still at tier 1. He didn‚Äôt even notice me. He just kept going to a hook nearby and started sabotaging it. I stood at good five feet away from him while he did so and not only did he get me to tier two, he got me to tier three just as he noticed me and ran off. It was a short chase...
---
Impossible at EU Rank 1.
---
That is a really nice change. Appreciate the info, thanks.
---
The thing is that kind of tea-bagging doesn't bother me...
---
It's the people who do it after vaulting and I hit the window instead of them, or after pallet stuns, or just because they can (sitting on a balcony with balanced landing, for example) without getting caught for it; or people who abuse BL loops and will just run it all match who start teabagging.
---
I give props to the people trying to distract me when someone is dead on hook and trying to take aggro - it's not upsetting, it's more kind of a cheeky "I see what you did there"; sometimes I accept the challenge (because I have to down them before the other guy gets up, it's like a race) and other times I don't, but it's not the same kind of tilting.

I am on console and you don't see many good nurses at all. The only time I see a good nurse is when I watch streams.
---
amazing work, sorry if this is too much to ask but can you please keep them updated when a new killer or survivor comes out?
---
There isn't anything toxic about using firecrackers and flashlights. If they really bother you, then put on Franklin's, lightborn, or let them waste their items. The selling other survivors out and yelling at you in chat is understandably annoying though. You need to report them for those actions.
---
I can speak for all Quentin mains that we're too lazy to be toxic, we just want that medkit bro
---
You sound like a bot to me

She takes skill to get good with you can‚Äôt just start the playing nurse then instantly get a 4K double pip

It works sometimes but that doesn‚Äôt prevent the inconsistent connections.

Jendenise. Call her toxic all you want you can't deny she's one of the best loopers in the game.
---
T bagging initiates it most of the time though
---
Oh nah I've been playing killer a lot, I'm just now starting to actually PLAY the game exclusively killer, I got so much hate mail yesterday bro it was funny asf
---
Hexy? I rarely watch him but doesn't he just urban evade and play super stealthy most of the time?
---
THANK YOU! They're called "Unsafe Hook Rescue" for a reason like wtf?
---
I agree somewhat, mostly because most of her add-ons mess with your memory and make it hard to play as her since they all change her stats in order to make up for something lost or gained. However, she is still hard as balls to play, so I don't think she herself needs to be changed. Most I could see is making her run the same speed as survivors, but even then that would change alot about playing her. I don't really know though, being a console player I don't see or play as nurse that much because its hard to turn with the decreased sensitivity.
---
Duude i always do thaaat
---
Hey if this happens again look for the hatch bc u can actually leave with the hatch
---
LOL and they died once and now crying for a nerf. Love making them rage.
---
There's a difference between *available* and *legitimate*; it's like saying "this is something you can legitimately do", but that applies to a lot of things, you can *do* almost anything even if it's incredibly self-destructive or outright illegal, but that doesn't make it *viable*.
---
Which isn't to say you can't ever stay near the hook and profit from it when dealing with overly altruistic survivors, but that's not the same thing at all.
---
Being near the hook =/= camping the hook.
---
PS4, always looking for more players to swf with.
---
Pacific time and I'm usually on around 9-10 pm 5 or so days a week.

---
Yeah that shit is hilarious, especially as a Doctor main, some dude yesterday got butthurt yesterday and said "you wouldn't even let us finish gens".......my main, and ONLY OBJECTIVE......IS TO KILL
---
Exactly. I‚Äôve gotten so much hatemail from survivors who were farmed off the hook by their teammate, yet somehow that was my fault.
---
I think they do see it that way but as a killer if a survivor farms another I will punish that survivor, not the survivor being farmed. Most killers go for the easy down then get salty about decisive/bt/adrenaline. It all goes both ways. Just play how you wanna play and take the salt that comes with it. Dont blame or point fingers
---
I manage to do it. Lucky for me I was low rank and was missing 4 killers. Spend the whole night doing it, now, I‚Äôm missing the hatch trophy and the prestige 3
---
Nothing lol
---
DS hit = killer tunnels. That's what I understand from survivors in my games. The person who just got unhooked can be the FIRST survivor I see and he'll complain about me tunneling even if he runs straight into me.
---
get this man a reward
---
I just tbag back
---
Her hair looks like a couple of turds
---
Oh I see lol, also why would you "pledge yourself as a killer main"?
---
Like im probably 60/40 killer to survivor, but I couldn't imagine completely giving up one side
---
This happened to me two times today
---
Pallets are the ones with more counterplay. Memory. Use your brain. Also, I‚Äôd suggest always running Bond when not playing SWF to see where others are dropping pallets
---
I love playing as wraith and revealing myself to someone not paying attention and I can see them turn violently so I know I have scared them (:
---
They said on stream they won‚Äôt be changing him anytime soon thank god
---
*nightmarish laughter increases*
---
I don‚Äôt know why you got downvoted. Camping does ruin the ability to play the game properly for survivors. Especially the one being camped. If a killer tunnels (which honestly I don‚Äôt really blame them) then it ruins the game for that survivor too because if they don‚Äôt have anything nearby they literally can‚Äôt do anything. We‚Äôre all sitting here ripping into survivors DC‚Äôing and ruining the game for both sides yet apparently we can‚Äôt say that camping does as well.
---
This is the funniest thing I've seen all week
---
nothing... the comment isnt saying her rep. its saying bc of stereotypes if the poster said a female sucked dick for bill to be on console then the post would be downvoted, but saying a male sucked dick for bill is OK.
---
Unless you find the hatch, even the second gate does this.
---
They need buffs for people who don't want to learn how they work.
---
I did learn of the preferences late, like after 20 rounds, but within six or so, I finally got to play as him.  I imagine the majority of people probably have their preference set to Jason for the higher chance of playing as him.  I should try again but I'm a bit addicted to Rocket League at the moment.
---
Playing as killer is so bloody stressful coz even if you perform well the survivors can still be toxic/mad. Wasn‚Äôt there a question on one of the dev streams where they asked how they would address killer not being  fun anymore a while ago?
---
He is "the trapper". Give him something in addition to bear traps. Like barbed ratchet straps to trap pallets and thin razor wire for doorways and windows. All of which he starts out with and even starts out with all his bear traps. Takes time to set up, but at least he won't have to walk around collecting traps at the start of a match.
---
Technically the way the perk is coded, it only activates once all the gens are done, and since closing the hatch blocks the gens, they aren't technically 'completed' so the perk doesn't activate. McLean said it was something they'd look into, cause he ran into the same thing on his stream.
---
Certain end game perks have different requirements in order to be used. Some refer to the last gen being powered and others to the exit gates being powered. I‚Äôm not sure why as most of the time both happen simultaneously but that‚Äôs the reason.
---
Sadly that has happened since season 15, maybe even before then. This group is a shit show who thinks they are the best thing to happen to BB. I've never heard the word respect said on the live feeds this much by people who then turn around and call those people sociopaths. 
---
Long story short; you're not missing anything good.
---
I kind of wish that they would do more add-ons like Freddy's where it changes his power completely.
---
Most Survivors and or Killers BM because they have a fucking god complex. I don't think there will be anything the developers can do, and an age limit could first, be circumvented, second, there are plenty of people over the age of 21 that still teabag (as a survivor or GF and Pig), nod at you (as a killer), sandbag you, insult you in the post game chat or team up with the opponent. Even though the last two offenses are bannable, I don't think there's anything the developers themselves can do to shut down the toxicity in this game, unless they shut down the game, otherwise, it's us, our playerbase has to stop being so toxic towards each other, but since there is nobody going to start doing that, they'd have to shut the entire game down.
---
&gt; 4 good survivors not on comms &gt;&gt;&gt; 4 mediocre survivors on comms. 
---
I didn't say otherwise 
---
&gt; Being on comms doesn't turn you into a god looper 
---
I didn't say it did?
---
&gt;  I won't deny that it's a big advantage, 
---
Great, then we're in total agreement.
---
I'm so confused but at the same time that's a  win for sure lol ggez bud!!
---
All hail lord StarWae!
---
I find snares to be easier to play against because you don't need to remember every single pallet dropped
---
On perks you don‚Äôt feel like grinding out?
---
This actually happened to one of my teammates on Lery's too! Absolutely hilarious to watch... But it needs to be fixed.
---
I only recently started playing survivor and every single time I hear the music, *"which of you stupid bitc-"*
---
&gt; Ok, so you need specific perks to counter Spirit and to change your play style and waste time to counter Hag, you don't need any of those to counter Billy.
---
I have zero idea what your point here is, when I didn't mention Billy at all. And, yes, SC completely counters Spirit along with all invis-based killers. The only thing SC is completely useless against is Nurse. Then again, not many perks out there are viable against her.
---
The snares are strong enough without add-ons. He should Just stay how he is right now. He is perfectly balanced they shouldnt buff him.
---
&gt; My Proposition - Give Trapper a Hag/Freddy like trap mechanic. Meaning he sets down 6, and then when setting down the 7th one the first one he put down gets erased from existence.
---
Not a bad idea at all. I had another one, but yours could work for me as well. My Trapper power rework is as follows:
---
1. He begins with 10 traps on a meter. 
---
2. He never needs to bend down to place a trap - they just materialize from his hands like Freddy's snares. He walks, aims to make a small circle where he wants his beartrap to go, then the trap materializes in that spot in 2 seconds flat, armed and ready.
---
2. At default only one trap can be placed at a time, after which there is a 15 second cooldown before the next trap can be placed. The number of traps remaining shows in his "trap meter" on his HUD like the Hag/Freddy.
---
3. All the set traps around the map are not only seen via their auras, but they can be aimed at from anywhere and automatically reset OR picked up. It's obviously what resetting the trap does, but when the "pick up" option is selected from afar it just materializes back to the Trapper's hand both re-setting the cooldown and allowing him to place it immediately anywhere wants. After the trap is placed, the cooldown begins again.
---
4. Any trap that is "sabotaged" gives an audio cue to the trapper and he can aim at it's aura and choose to either reset it or send it back to his bag to place it elsewhere he walks.
---
5. Addon changes:
---
**Trapper Sack** allows you to place down two traps before the 15 second cooldown begins until the next two are available. 
---
**Trapper Bag** allows you to place down three traps before a 15 second cooldown begins until the next three are available.
---
**Stitched Bag** allows you place down four traps before a 15 second cooldown begins until the next four are available.
---
Shards you can buy certain cosmetics, non-licensed killers and survivors and use them in the shrine of secrets.
---
Multiple people, or the same person, asked similar questions, and Cote gave different responses.
---
"That's your opinion" was one. "Go play Civ V" was another. A third was "go outside for a week" or something like that.
---
Generally very hostile, snarky replies to otherwise mostly innocent questions.
---
And yeah, not_Queen supposedly streams on Twitch. I think it was mentioned briefly that she was just a DBD streamer before joining the team back when DBD was still fairly new (around 1 year old) 
---
She's rank 20 along with other devs. They also do SWF. They're literal babies.
---
And while they are busy making the game and might not necessarily be able to play it... they 100% need to talk to pros and people of all ranks. Not just rank 20s. Who also gets Killer design decisions in favor of them. (GF being easier to detect was one.)
---
hm, hm, true, true
---
Man what a huge bruh moment, with a sprinkle of a boomer joke
---
&gt;I grabbed them
---
it doesnt work anymore :( all tho you could wait until theyre close and close the hatch in their face
---
What are you registering for? This is the second time I‚Äôve seen this
---
If we have to fuck off just because we want the game to be balanced and fun for everyone on then
---
I just have hopes that Valve give BHVR free reign over Bill. Considering Jim French passed, there isn't much they could do with the character even if they did somehow manage to make a L4D3 that had the 1 and 2 characters in them. BHVR have like the perfect setting for the old bastard in a game where characters don't have voicelines anyways.
---
My point is give Bill a fucking Hawaiian shirt dude all he wanted to do was make it to the keys with his grandkids Zoey, Louis, and Francis man cmon give the dude some happiness.
---
Just give him the same sort of outfit that Ash has with some nice khaki shorts (pale ass wobbly knees shining brighter than a halloween medkit), some flip flops, a nice button up Hawaiian shirt with the buttons slightly off, and a nice beach hat so he doesn't burn.

Someone just had to come in and ruin this post with a unnecessary SJW comment, huh?

....no... it doesn't. Again, watch the example match. Then go ahead and tell me "lag" is the reason these survivors are giving up.
---
&gt; you could wait until theyre close and close the hatch in their face
---
Wraith is perfect for this because he's totally invisible while standing still and he can close it while cloaked. 
---
Also, unless it was changed with the EGC, he can bodyblock Survivors from using the Hatch while cloaked.
---
Yes I‚Äôve said this before! They need to actually sit down with the content creators like monto, and I personally think they should talk to No0b3 although i know they hate him, true talent and people like that because they have strong opinions about the game that actually reflect the majority of the player base.

Could I ask why he doesn‚Äôt use that hex? It‚Äôs annoying but I thought it was helpful for killers to slow down the game a little? I don‚Äôt use it so I‚Äôm not sure of it‚Äôs use much.
---
Aww
---
Did they say the are going to rework nurse?
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give it a try I was using Snapchats cropping feature.
---
 I teabag back...  But the point is that survivor teabag to annoy me, while i teabag, breaking the line of sight, in order to regress his revealing process, so he wouldn't break me out of Nisht Shroud. And i also slowly expose him at the same time.
---
 Thus he can teabag all he wants, he only makes my job much easier.
---
Every killer has bad add-ons. Why don't you complain about that? And yeah majority plays Freddy with dream pallets. If you want to learn how to use them you should give it some time instead of saying that it is bad and that is why I don't use them.
---
if youre wraith you have 100% confirmed win if you find the hatch, bodyblocking hatch still works since once a survivor used a key and i body blocked by accident a nea so i closed it and killed her
---
I know it is but everyone cracks on how bad F13 is in here and thought it be funny to post, guess not...
---
What have you brought upon these cursed lands?
---
Both are toxic and ruin the mood of the other person making it less fun for them, if you are teabagging dont be suprised to that leads to facecamping and tunnelling and this is coming from a survivor main who just plays killer on the side
---
Yup that was the joke
---
This is some high quality work. Well done, OP

Keep in mind it is not from best to worst(the tiers) like in A tier Michael isn‚Äôt better than spirit they‚Äôre the same along with billy..(imo)

---
you just called him daddy myers though ;)
---
Doesn't help you when you're in a chase. You either have to avoid good loops which means you go down faster or step in a trap.
---
