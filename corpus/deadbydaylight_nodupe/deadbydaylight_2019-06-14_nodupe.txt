I am prestiging my characters for the clothes and yet I don't want to use said clothes cause my teammates will expect me not to suck... And yet I do :(

I was gonna keep scrolling passed, yet this is literally the dumbest shit I ever read. Please learn another language and stop using mine.
---
ugh, mariah min and her mind üòç
---
Are you trolling? Seems like trolling.
---
Pc and just the normal menu sounds
---
You're chaotic good
---
A young disciple playing hillbilly, I‚Äôm proud of you my boy.

---
Also that snipe was satisfying as hell
---
only Bad thing: he still gets his Power completly destroyed by this perl
---
It is most certainly a nerf, but a nerf that was *definitely* deserved.
---
I gave you advice on what you should focus on. we all know this games ‚Äúranking‚Äù is absurdly bad, doesn‚Äôt mean you should give up, facecamp and blame it on swf.
---
Disconnect.
---
OMG this is adorable &lt;3

aww, did i make the little baby mad??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

All ya have to do is be altruistic no biggie

DELIVERANCE DECIDED TO NOT WORK WHILE ON THE PTB! I COULD HAVE ESCAPED. HOW YOU GUYS MANAGED TO FUCK THIS PERK AGAIN AAAA
---
Lmao no but I am bored with nothing else to do
---
yes, such is why you went to my comment history just to talk shit. bc you're not mad at all
---
That's the true strength of pebble. I've almost been tricked like this before.
---
Ironically it's the out-of-place scratch marks that gave it away.
---
Like I said I am bored. You talked shit therefore I replied
---
How fast are you spinning it?
---
This better win. I want this desperately for my wraith
---
Magic Mike. I can‚Äôt be the first one to think of this.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt know that legion gets so much bloodpoints, played him instead of the typical nurse billy huntress flip flop and got 32 küëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
Damn, this might be the coolest fan made design I've seen not only in DBD but any game whatsoever. Awesome job man.
---
You earned it regardless of what any cuck may say.
---
She can be hard to wield though in their defense...
---
you didn't reply tho. you went out of your way to comment on other things ive said. that's a clear sign that someone is upset
---
Lol you think so?
---
And death comes for everyone.
---
Just to get you off your fuck buddy pillow so it can get away from thr neckbeard having it's way with it
---
Yes always
---
Someone said they would expose me and threatened my life for getting 4-0 ruthless Killer last night. When psn went down I thought he ddos me or got me banned. Ugh
---
I accidentally threw my mouse off my desk one time because I went to peek through a window and a fully bloody David stood up on the otherside.
---
if you get stunned by 21 pallets as doctor, you're obviously bad or have no clue how to play him
---
Unfortunately???!!! He was fucking annoying af, no skill involved and was shit, the new legion is actually a buff for those who doesnt moonwalked and uses always franks mixtape.
---
There are little arrows between the panels. Took me a second to get it.
---
Good art, terrible formatting imo.
---
Jeez you really typed up some worthless shit lol
---
I was more getting at that as long as they don't get 0.2sec blinds and vacuums the length of the pallets they're pretty happy
---
"Thirsty killers?" 
---
How *dare* people play to win in a competitive game! /s
---
There's little arrows pointing to where, there's two different things going on which makes it hard to follow
---
Uhhh....
---
Yea. I typically don‚Äôt mind if the last survivor finds hatch before me and gets out. Doesn‚Äôt hurt my score too much. Yea I‚Äôd rather 4k but it‚Äôs whatever. However, if a survivor really wants to survive that badly then I guess they should get a shot
---
omfg i got the exact same tile missing in a different game
---
Good. Game didn't crash during loading
---
Nice job
---
It‚Äôs an additional 5k points lol
---
Wicked !
---
PLAYED AGAINST A DOCTOR WHO WAS DOING OBVIOUS SKETCHY SHIT (I SAY THIS BECAUSE OF THE LAME ASS EXCUSE THEY GAVE RATHER THAN A REALISTIC ANSWER LIKE REGULAR LAG/CONNECTION ISSUE) AND WHEN I POINTED IT OUT, THEY BLAMED IT ON DOCTOR NOW HAVING ABILITIES TO FREEZE PLAYERS MID GAME AND CAN TELEPORT.. WHAT? JUST OWN UP TO IT YOU LOSER
---
Nor are you entitled to survive. Get over it.
---
Isn't the point that there's no need to have a mori if noone is getting of the hook or am I mistaken?
---
Legion got a minor rework.
---
TLDR:
---
* 115% movement speed
---
* 32m terror radius
---
* Longer Frenzy Duration
---
* Slower speed in Frenzy
---
* Longer stun when ending Frenzy
---
* No benefit for frenzy stabbing an already deep wounded survivor
---
* Lose Frenzy if you miss.
---
You know what ruins the experience!? Tunnerlers and campers... that shit is for the birds. 
---
But Billy is op and I'm sorry you dont see it. He has no cool down why does every other killer have a cool down to their power!?
---
And that meaty thwack when he hits someone is also top-tier. Only thing he's missing is the clown's laugh while in punishment, and he'd be perfect.
---
Losing the entire power meter hurts.
---
Wait, I'm kind of out of loop(hehe), you get mettle of man stacks by protection hits and safe unhooks?
---
Two kills is a draw, yes. 3 is a win. 4 is a FLAWLESS VICTORY MK style. 
---
Substitute for Safety pip, Pip, and Double pip at your leisure.
---
IM NOT REALLY MAD BUT I KNOW THIS ONE PLAGUE I WENT AGAINST IS FUMING, I HAD A SABOTAGE HOOK DAILY AND I 99% THE HOOKS AND SHE KEPT TRYING TO GET THE PERSON ON A HOOK BUT I KEPT SABOTAGING THEM AS SHE GOT TO THEM SO SHE PRIORITIZED ME AND I DIED BUT HEY I GOT MY DAILY AND THEY HAD THEIR ACCOUNT PRIVATE SO I COULDNT MESSAGE THEM AND DUDDE IF YOU SEE THIS IM SORRY
---
It's all about what you consider victory. Hell I'd argue getting over 10,000 points as Survivor is a win because that's how we used to pip. 
---
As Killer, it being open to interpretation is a good way to put it. Sometimes even just getting what you needed for a daily is a victory.
---
Throw on that Ivory Mori, yo!
---
Imagine sending someone death threats because they beat you in a video game.
---
On topic be sure to report that guy to Sony.
---
You killer mains are fragile AF over a meme and it shows.
---
- Me, someone who has both escaped and gotten 4k's before, and isn't a little shit about it.
---
I just don't see why gay people deserve month when Chinese Canadians went through far worse, and we don't have month or even a week dedicated to them.
---
he just got a buff, there is 0 reason for a nerf
---
I'm legitimately excited to play as him and against him in the current state
---
I've literally hooked everyone and killed them before NOED even activated and they still complained about it in endgame chat.
---
Nope
---
I remember seeing zubat(a streamer) get baited into falling in the hole that sends you to the bathroom. Was fucking hilarious, chat went ham on him
---
You beat me to the punch ~~by two hours~~
---
just don't miss lol
---
WATCH TRICK R‚Äô TREAT ASAP!
---
if u don't want to eat all the pallets i highly recommend playing the nurse. with her u don't have to deal with the shit survivors are constantly throwing at you.
---
no. Luck is almost useless. it only works on chance to untrap yourself and chance to unhook yourself
---
Adam has more fun perks imo. I really like the concept of Autodidact, even if it's not really a great perk. Deliverance can be legit useful, and Pebble is Pebble. Nuff said.
---
As far as I know... Lck only applies to attempts to escape from hooks, bear traps of the trapper and chests
---
True, although he does have addons to increase his movement speed while crouched. Not sure by how much though.
---
Michael is much better and maintaining and gaining momentum. EW3 also has a lot of scare tactics and will prevent gen progress. They're good in different ways.
---
YOU TELL ME WHERE MY BLOOD IS WOMAN! WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD!
---
I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúhow dare they‚Äù I‚Äôm just saying it really sucks when you stand absolutely 0 chance of surviving, how are you supposed to be a competitive survivor if all routes of escape are blocked and you‚Äôre just waiting 2 min to die?
---
at first glance i thought the green mask was Midoriya's alpha hero costume lol
---
He most likely will sadly because 1. People love complaining and 2. They need to appeal to the mass audience which are Survivor players. the final one is that they probably only buffed him so he could sell well then nerf his ass to low tier kinda like MoM or just revert some of the changes making him worse but not as bad as when he first released on the PTB. From what I seen of the new GF he seems very buggy and strong I mean hell I believe he can stalk during chases and get a one shot now don't quote me on that.
---
 what (and i can not stress this enough) the fuck??
---
It mentions in the patch notes that some of the addons are bugged right now, I guess that's one of them.
---
Yeah, that's part of it, they also slowed Frenzy movement speed while making it last longer. 
---
Other changes include:
---
-reworked addons
---
-bloodstains not visible in Frenzy
---
-Killer Instinct detection range is not tied to Terror Radius
---
-base movement speed is bumped up to 115% from 110%
---
-bleedout timer progress is not visible to killer; you can see who has the status but not how far along it is
---
-bleedout timer is static in the killers Terror Radius.
---
-additional Frenzy strikes don't cause bleedout timers to lose any extra time; (unless you run Frank's Mixtape, it causes a *small* portion of the meter to be lost.)
---
Oh, I meant my teammates. Granted I could definitely give advise to the killer too.
---
Survivors, amirite?
---
/s just in case
---
You guys suck
---
I thought I'm supposed to totem rush because of NOED?
---
He's not even a good killer, though. There's literally no reason to nerf him. He's still underwhelming as shit, he just actually has a power now.
---
The mentality is dumb and certain people don't help it.
---
Hmm well that's a good point fuck me right?
---
I don't think it would ever happen, but I want Bob from Twin Peaks as a killer so I can play as Agent Cooper.
---
Literally anybody who's saying ghostface is op is rank 20. He's still bad.
---
Yup, usually how it goes. When a new chapter comes out (sometimes even double bloodpoint events) so many people wanna try out killer. I normally play killer, so I kind of like that. Allows me to play survivor with fast matchmake times and gives dbd some fresh air for me. :D
---
What‚Äôs the change?
---
Personally, I run her with Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Overcharge, and either BBQ or Brutal Strength.  While I always preferred to  play Pig as a mid-game killer, saving only 1 trap for the endgame, this tactic has become a necessity due to her massive endgame collapse nerfs.  Ruin is mostly just there to stall until you get your first trap applied, don‚Äôt worry about it too much.  The meat and potatoes of the build is the PGtW+Overcharge combo in conjunction with your traps, which can grind all progress to a halt so long as you ration your traps so that no more than 2 are ever applied at the same time.  Having 3 applied at a time is just a waste of a trap since you can only optimistically pressure 2 people at a time.
---
How I like to play Pig is trapping 2 survivors, allowing 1 to run around and try and get their trap off while the other is used as bait.  I will knock them down but intentionally not hook them, going into stealth immediately and going out to hunt their teammate who is working on a gen.  The one who is coming to pick them up is going to be very slow in responding and overly cautious, since they assume that I am just camping the slugged survivor and will leap out and attack the second they get in range, and by the time they realize it‚Äôs safe I‚Äôve probably already gotten the first hit on the gen-er.  If the slugged survivor gets picked up and their timer is ticking, they will bot wait for heals and will run to the nearest box 9/10 times, allowing me to easily find them down them and repeat the process.  If they begin to catch on to the trick, then I WILL do exactly what they expected me to do in the first place and camp the slugged and strike down the savior, while the gen survivor hides in fear thinking I‚Äôm coming for them and the second trapped one keeps trying boxes.  This strategy, admittedly, is limited by Pig‚Äôs luck, as trapped survivor 2 may get their trap off in 2 seconds or they may get their head blown off, but it generally yields good results so long as I can get the initial setup in place before the second gen is done, and preferably before Ruin goes (though that‚Äôs REALLY optimistic).  Also, obviously, don‚Äôt be a total dick and slug the bait  to death.  Cycle between who is used as bait whenever a new trap is applied.
---
You know it.
---
as long as he's released on time! looking forward to tuesday
---
Luck is basically garbage. It needs a total rework.
---
It doesn't even effect chests.
---
If you trying to learn survivor, painreliever and ussylis are really good. If you are trying to learn killer, damnohtml/scottjund is really helpful and monto are amazing
---
Are you able to even get in a lobby together where it says ‚ÄúSearching for game?‚Äù If you are at least at that point and together waiting, it could just be long queue times. SWF times vary but are fairly often quite long compared to solo queues.
---
Probably a negative opinion you got there. I think he is fun for both sides and is well balanced.
---
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I did that on mobile. Shoot me
---
Right? I used it for saves most of the time anyways? This changes nothing for me.
---
Not if the trap's active. (was placed before the last generator popped)
---
Ruvik from Evil Within would be cool as fuck.
---
Thank you so much! Details are my thing :)
---
Yep! &lt;3
---
bruh xd
---
"exploit" flashlight, "exploit" loops. Lmao Yeah you're a killer main, bub.
---
A lot of people have been saying stuff like that! It's very flattering. Hopefully the devs agree with you guys :)
---
What about the creator?
---
that would be cool!
---
None.
---
Original killers ftw
---
He's Dwight
---
Little Big Planet 4: The Massacre
---
Ah I understand...
---
Child Predator.
---
So getting a couple protection hits should be no problem. It's just slightly more work than it would be to get three unhooks, no biggie.
---
oh , i gotta test that
---
Nobody said they were but yes.
---
Yeah just looked it up. I mean if he truly owns the rights to the character then yeah guess not.
---
Yea you definitely sound like a killer main if you think looping is an exploit
---
Why don't you start the campaign yourself to get a month dedicated to being part of the majority?
---
This game has been a horror game for killers since the beginning.
---
It's still bugged can't get it
---
thank you, mister.
---
I love it, but arent wraiths cosmetics divided into head, body/legs, and weapon? If so, how would the head appear separately from the body here?
---
*screams in no one escapes death*
---
Don‚Äôt forget about ppl who do not like a idea you have and say duh your survivor/killer make lol
---
My only concern is that from what I've seen it's pretty hard to actually break his stealth without getting exposed.
---
I've seen survivors stare straight at him without breaking his stealth, if they tried breaking it in chase then GF just got the exposed before the effect got broken.
---
Either make it more responsive to looking at him or make the charge bar start ticking down after a while.
---
Fair enough! Original killers are some of the best designed so I can appreciate the love for them!
---
First game 30 minutes
---
Second game 40 minutes
---
Both games everyone had object of obsession and DS so 10/10 experience
---
Right in the childhood
---
This is some scooby doo ass shit
---
The scary big guy from snowpiercer
---
I get more scared as killer than I do as survivor.The random claudette appearing out of nowhere and dropping a pallet etc..It makes me fucking jump
---
[yep, sure does seem fitting](https://youtu.be/zSsmVgxf4tM)
---
I swear, that Leatherface speaks to me.
---
I don't care who's top tier or not, I fear only one killer, and that's LF, because no matter how much junk is around me I cannot dodge that saw and every time it's him I could swear he's got Sprint Burst on
---
read the previous posts.
---
I remember hearing in a stream, not really long ago, one of the devs saying that it affected
---
WHEN I SEE SOMEONE GET FARMED OR SANDBAGGED I NORMALLY SLUG EM THEN GET THE OTHER PERSON AND IF THEYRE STILL SLUGGED WHEN ITS DONE I GO PICK EM UP AND DROP EM OVER AND OVER AND SWING TO TELL THEM THEYRE FREE BECAUSE WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO ME AS SURVIVOR I SOMETIMES WANT TO JUST UNINSTALL THE GAME
---
Pyramid Head as killer 
---
James as survivor
---
Source: Silent Hill 2. Imagine the concept of The Otherworld aka Hell. And just walking around with that big knife.
---
My Walmart didn't give a damn - I got told it wasn't a problem/would be okay for the day or night or until the freight was cleared (often took weeks) or that I could do all the work to clear it but I'd be written up if my own section wasn't also spotless.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I just gave up and left things that they couldn't prove I neglected (eg; anything I saw outside of my department or anytime they weren't watching, meaning I'd move the odd pallet sometimes but not often) alone.
---
It was a constant mess and it drove me mad.
---
definitely Nancy as survivor
---
GREATER GOOD? I AM THE GREATEST GOOD YOURE EVER GONNA GET!
---
i feel this
---
I am straight
---
well it stops survivors getting benefits from being bad
---
I'm totally not biased as a Kate main she's OP and you'll escape every time
---
DOCTORS ARE ALWAYS THE MOST TOXIC, DOCTORS AND HAGS. EVERY FUCKING HAG AND DOCTOR I GO AGAINST CAMP THE FUCK OUT OF YOU AND SEND HATE MESSAGES IF YOU MANAGE TO GET UNHOOKED AND MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AFTER BEING CAMPED AND IT MAKES ME SO MAD AND SAD AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME BECAUSE THEYRE COOL KILLERS BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THEM MAKES ME HATE THEM IMMENSELY BECAUSE OF SOME TOXIC TWATS WHO USE THEM AND MAKE ME WANT TO BECOME A KILLER MAIN INSTEAD OF PLAYING BOTH
---
*uneeded 3rd party response saying both parties are justified*
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and either Spirit fury or Brutal strength.
---
You can try changing up the Ruin for Pop goes the weasel if you want to run Brutal strength.
---
Shame
---
Uh what...
---
I also just want to note, I like the endgame collapse, it keeps matches fun and quick, I just wish a lone survivor stood a little more of a chance, like if maybe the gates got halfway powered when the hatch shut or something. What do you do when you‚Äôre the last one and both doors are shut? When not all gens were started and you‚Äôre the last one and the hatch gets shut.
---
 Do you just give up? 
---
Cuz the killer certainly won‚Äôt let you open a door.
---
His power also lets him have no terror radius and stain even when not crouching, so it balances itself out.
---
That would be too op sackboy could just delete looping structures
---
I agree with Kirby, that's one step too far, you should report them.
---
FUCKING LOVE HOW THE PING IN THE LOBBY WAS IN THE GREEN AND THEN AS SOON AS THE MATCH STARTS I KEEP LAGGING BACK TO WHERE I SPAWNED AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IM DOWNED HAVING A DOCTOR SHAKE HIS HEAD NO AT ME EVEN THOUGH I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCKS GOING ON JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCKS HAPPENING THATS SUCH BULLSHIT ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD CONNECTION AND MY INTERNET IS FINE WHY CANT I MOVE UGHHH
---
I got them all before the update: During the Pip update, they changed all the Adepts for killers. I was lucky to get them all, but some people aren't so lucky, and we should fix them
---
That's why I pair it with Decisive Strike these days it'll at least let me gain a little distance
---
I Definitely feel ghostface is the buggiest killer ever released and I kinda feel he will be like Legion 2.0 just a little more bearable. They definitely didn't playtest Ghostface a lot he is just so buggy
---
Another source is the movies.
---
You must've had some really dirty trap spots.
---
*Gloomy  keyboard*
---
There are so many now...
---
Main source Is Silent Hill 2 as that was his first appearance
---
Oh I know you weren't making a noed statement. I simply made a remark on noed in passing on a meme I made that I thought was topical to the comment thread. In all honesty I wasnt even trying to actually make any actual comment or discussion, it just felt like somebody else was and I wasnt interested
---
*watered electroboard*
---
Why do I have this feeling you gave those awards to yourself
---
yea, but you're always more biased toward one side
---
Except it was changed again and is only protection hits now, safe unhooks were removed.
---
It went from 3 hits to protection hits and safe  unhooks but allowing a killing blow to be entirely avoided healthy or not, now its being changed again to ONLY be protection hits.
---
Do you know that in the PTB the progress or what you spend will not be saved in the original server? People just do not play seriously because they do not look for blood points, they just want to try the new changes
---
Well I wouldn't call him that, as opposed to old Legion he has counterplay and can be looped. He does seem a bit buggy, I can agree with that.
---
He's gonna be a lot better then when he was first released on PTB. He can still be looped (but so can 95% of other killers)
---
I'd say he's gonna be fairly strong. The changes they made to him are really good.
---
Tough but fair
---
Yeah so theyre doing these things because they're not playing seriously. But how am I supposed to test ghost face and see if I want to spend my hard earned money on him? Xd
---
I just don't see why people complained about removing it from safe unhooks, perk is still a 1 time use and all you have to do is be altruistic 3 times smh.
---
Slower vaults.
---
Jah
---
Ya, because the only killer I play is miss piggy and I want to play ghosty boi

Sometimes I forgot how toxic this community is
---
I thought it was something they said they were planning on doing but it wasn't even in full effect yet.
---
Shirtless clown
---
Even David's adept is easier than all killer adepts if you ask me. I am a killer main and got all survivor adept achievments bedore I got 1/3rd of the killer adepts
---
Makes sense I mean you already went to heaven.
---
Every 13th of every month.
---
I agree. Just be a good teammate for once and not be selfish.
---
That too, that's sort of part of slower speed in frenzy though. This is just the tldr, if you want the full info, check the wiki
---
Lol I don't think it's an exploit. It's satire, its usually the players that want to laserbeam, loop and teabag the whole game and then get salty AF if you get em that think this way and get toxic toward killers.
---
I was playing hag and got jumpscared from my own trap going off.
---
Ok nvm
---
It can be... My memory is not the best honestly
---
Bahaha fuckin' Wolverine over here
---
A bit buggy? I seen games of him just getting his stalk off while they were directly looking at him but they still get one shotted. This just seems  half-baked on devs part sure he may decent now but the bugs just make him absolutely overpowered because you can't do anything against him. I really hope they fix the bugs but they only have 4ish days left to do it and I honestly don't want them to release him at such a buggy state. I feel he is Legion 2.0 just that he can be looped but besides that he seems pretty broken. I really like these Developers but they need to get players to bugtest  the killers before releasing them sure it may be PTB But still Ghostface feels half baked.
---
Demogorgon gimme gimme.

---
The game is killer hosted, so if you have a bad connection to the killer it's laggy and you get hit when you shouldn't, and people always, always say it's legitimate (i.e, the use of a switch, a network device, to artificially induce and control lag specifically to gain an advantage)
---
Yes but he‚Äôs more widely known through the Movie.
---
Drake, wheres the blood web?
---
Did you mean to tell this to the other guy?
---
If it didn‚Äôt start now it doesn‚Äôt start tonight.
---
Yes 14-18
---
*satirical responses making fun of the situation that only gets responses from triggered people who think it's serious*
---
Should we create club names for each clan of killer mains?
---
Pigs are Oinkers obvs.
---
Wraiths are the Bing Bong Bois. or maybe the Bing Bong Brigade
---
What else?
---
w o a h
---
What time tomorrow oink
---
Such a perfect timing for Double bloodpoint weekend no?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that. I have more friends who knew about the games before they knew the movie even existed.
---
Mikeies are Stalky Chalky?
---
Yeah, figuered they changed it because I don't remember it being this hard to get adept when I got the Freddy Adept
---
I hope to god, that you having played this game before, you've achieved a 4K and an escape. Because neither of those are achievements. Saying this as a neutral survivor/killer.
---
But Kramer actually knew all along, and was using it as a test for Amanda, who he believed was faltering from his moral code (and slipping back into drug use and self-harm!) And he knew about Hoffman's betrayal and set it up so Hoffman would pay four movies later, by using a character from two movies prior!
---
Gods, the SAW plotline is so wonderfully convoluted.
---
True. I have a daily right now to chase people for 2m as trapper. I got a 2k with 1 gen repaired, i had the other two DC (3 of the 4 were friends on steam, so...) and i'm halfway done with my objective. Honestly i wish i'd gone a bit easier and just chased them around for 2 minutes.
---
Same honestly lol
---
Credit the creator
---
I. AM. YOUR. WIFE. I'M THE GREATEST GOOD YOUSE EVER GONNA GET
---
Holy shit
---
I'm guessing it's just a glitch? Or perhaps removing the music so that you can hear ghost face easier so that his stealth ability isn't over powered?
---
I think you have to look at him for 1,5 seconds
---
He was playing as Killer, and it was entirely gone. Someone asked him and he said "they lowered it" but I can't even heat it at all
---
Yes but think of your average horror consumer then your typical gamers especially when it comes to old school games. Most people will know of Pinhead through the movies.
---
I played as him and against him today. As survivor and as killer, the chase music seems to be non-existent
---
Please put the meme "I think we've done a pretty good job so far" in the hole
---
RANK RESET FUCKING SUCKS
---
Wait since when was there 11 months of straight pride? Never heard about that maybe it's just a myth made up by libtards. Straight people don't throw their sexuality at people, straight people don't need a month to say hey I am straight! It's a sexuality get over it.
---
That‚Äôs definitely tunneling. Maybe he had a grudge against that guy.
---
Yes that‚Äôs rank 20... I mean tunneling
---
Are you saying looping/flashlights are an exploit?  Lol
---
I mean he has no obligation to let you unhook in front of him and leave. If you guys had been diving hooks before then it‚Äôs perfectly understandable he waited for it. That probably wasn‚Äôt the case but it happens. You should have borrowed time to negate this situations.
---
it's the 14th now, any idea what timezone?
---
Yes when you go out of your way to kill another person despite getting other options to hit the other one. 
---
Some scenarios are fine to tunnel most aren‚Äôt. 
---
Like fro example if you go back to hook and you chase scratches and find the injured survivor it‚Äôs not your fault at that point that you are tunneling.
---
*There's two pallets*

It‚Äôs 13th in America. So tomorrow my Friday which is your Saturday I believe.

That‚Äôs what that is?!?!? I saw that shit on Haddonfield and I was so comfuzzled. I thought my P.C was being a potato

If it‚Äôs at the end of the game, everyone is healed up, and then they unhook the guy. You bet your sweet ass I‚Äôm going to tunnel because I‚Äôm getting at least one kill.
---
I love how I can read your mind by seeing where you keep the progress on the M2 bar
---
If your on the homepage of the subreddit. Click the three little dots on the top right, one will be change user flair.
---
That‚Äôs acceptable. It always feels bad being on the receiving end of that but I rather be on the receiving end of that with a chance to escape then with NOED and no chance to escape lol.
---
*MonkaS*
---
He was cloaked camping it looks like, which is pretty typical for Wraiths who are shit.
---
Let them play with their hole
---
If any Netflix Original could work, there's also Slasher, which offers several prospective killers.
---
Also, it's literally called Slasher. I want a chapter for the Druid just called "Slasher."
---
No one gonna point out that he is a leather face with insidious and noed?
---
The biggest buffs I'm not in favor of and I hope they look at reverting are the "If you get your power broken the Survivior who did it gets revealed to you" and the "you can see where they cancel ur power from" buff. 
---
Simply bc those two buffs give him a pretty hefty crash pad for bad players, which I'm not in favor of
---
It‚Äôs literally built into his kit. It worked this time right? Must not be too shit then.
---
That is what you call a bad killer.
---
He should have hit you and then continue to go for the nea or whoever was easier to get.
---
Ehh this would make more sense if you said downing a survivor with Iridescent Heads. Cause the surprise is supposed to come from something you should expect to happen. Idk I guess I'm sorry for nitpicking.
---
MAN, FUCK RANK RESET. I AM BEING DEMOLISHED BY SURVIVORS. IT'S LIKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE FUCKERS GOT DECISIVE, METTLE OF MAN, ADRENALINE AND SELF CARE. 
---
I'M WONDERING IF THE LORD IS TESTING MY FAITH, BUT FUCK THIS GAME FOR THE TIME BEING. I JUST CAN'T. AND IT'S NOT LIKE I'M BLAMING THE PERKS OR SAYING THEY'RE UNBALANCED, BUT HELL, THEY'RE JUST BETTER THAN ME. I TRIED RUNNING NOED, BUT GUESS WHAT, IT CANT WORK IF THERE ARE NO TOTENS. HAPPENED TWICE. I MEAN, COME ON.
---
kinda wished sam would do jokes about the legion relating to the fact that they are 4 different people instead of just constantly shitting on them in his parodies
---
7 hours...
---
Who's got the time for that haha I'm jealous.
---
Honestly play how you play but if you camp it‚Äôs super unfun, and it hurts the killer because he could be chasing survivors off gens. Sorry my English is terrible
---
As a weird choice I would like to have Book Rambo as a killer and William Teasle as a survivor.
---
yeah actually that's better lol
---
Yes, you couldn't have posted a better example.
---
No prob on the English. All I‚Äôm saying is use the tools you have available.
---
We could have a deteriorated mask, rotten to reveal parts of her face
---
As a way to re-open it? well, it is totally fair I think.
---
Dexter.
---
Ghostface can warp reality and trap survivors in wormholes, OP :/
---
But, better in every way
---
Not to forget Wretched Shop Be Like, Coal Tower be like, (idk the name) The Silo one be like &gt;.&gt; pls devs
---
&lt;3
---
No way haha 
---
Least you got out.
---
He needs some chest pubes goin down to his ball fro.
---
You are the enemy of the people
---
Yes, however, if that were a decent killer you would have been hit
---
That definitely would be in the top.
---
I personally never really enjoyed 2 either; 3 was definitely the best of them for me.
---
Pig we worship
---
Everyone seems to like the spirit. That is one of the two I don‚Äôt own. Everyone hates him, but I have fun with Freddy, and once they do his rework, he‚Äôs going to be better. I just go Legion, Clown and Pig, but haven‚Äôt played them yet.
---
Uhh theres one for moderately and i think thats like 2-5% i think its somewhere in that ballpark
---
Does someone have his changes to his power now?
---
Remember that you can buy with the game currency the DLC's of characters that are not from movies, and which killer is more fun, that depends only on you
---
I run BBQ/Surveillance/Brutal Strength/STBFL
---
Read my flair buddy boy ;)
---
*SOON*
---
"Great news everyone!"
---
Now that's a different kind of **loop**
---
FalconMcBob!
---
Yessir
---
Nah the wraith's head and cape are usually one unit. That would be the case here as well. Glad you like the design :)
---
Leatherface is fun. It‚Äôs like driving a bumper car with a chainsaw. You will learn the slippin slide saw and it becomes a monster, I can circle trees and obstacles with no problems.
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs just entertaining how quickly people change
---
Oh okay, I couldn't remember if it was head/shoulder, legs, weapon or head, body, weapon. Thanks for the clarification. Also, not gonna lie I thought this was legit art from the game when I first saw it lol
---
Killer\*
---
Doctor is buffed with being buffed on mobile
---
No working cars in the Entity's Realm, so logically the honks were Clown honking his own nose and making his own sound effects for it
---
I bend over forward and look between my legs
---
that and you have to look at him non-stop. cannot break line of sight for the entire 1.5 seconds. Ghostface also has be something like +20% visible to start being spotted.
---
that's too bad.. a heart beat would have been freaky..thnx
---
This is Clown discrimination
---
Hopefully they dont remove this
---
*Freddy cries in the background*
---
David would clap the entity. No contest
---
What I'm doing is connecting my fight stick and leaving my controller on so I can controll the game with the PS4 controller and the fight stick. The stick has turbo, a mode that in short will rapidly press a button for you if you hold it. So I thought "Can't I just leave somthing here to hold it down then move it when I'm unhooked"?
---
(The down side is I have to use a second PS4 controller if I want to use headphones because headphone output doesn't go through if the controller is connected to the fight stick.)
---
SWF should be removed but they would lose too much of their playerbase. Sadly it just doesn't make sense for the devs. They should create a true ranked mode where SWF isn't allowed
---
I don‚Äôt consider it tunneling if you‚Äôre trying to bait me, if I‚Äôm chasing your one healer and a jake or a meg swoops in to distract me I‚Äôll just ignore them because I don‚Äôt want to be looped for an hour while my target heals.
---
Then they need to add Wesker as a new killer! That would be hype as fuck!
---
1/2 milky drink
---
But the two cheapest things to play against (ultra-rare addons for flashlights and map) are reuseable; the ultra-rare bulb is pretty dang close to instant-blind.
---
Killers need their addons quite often, either for mobility (Spirit) or to carry more than one trap (Trapper) or for basic utility (Pig, Hag) among other things. Even Huntress (exhaustion on the hatchet is particularly welcome due to giving them a speed boost while you're still at range).
---
Have you tried playing addonless killer and having to sink 30-40k into a bloodweb to get more? First you have to eat up 20-30k getting to the first addon, then more for the second, and then you have to spend even more to refresh the level 50 web before getting to spend the initial 30-40k sink. It's ridiculously RNG.
---
You can't just take Plunderers and know you're going to get a purple flashlight within two games (I think it has like a 20% chance w/ Plunderers and most maps have three chests).
---
If you actually have a problem with killers getting addons for free try doing something like dropping your flashlight after each match before escaping and not using Plunderers/Ace in the Hole to get items to simulate having to get the items again from level 50 webs.
---
It sucks.
---
Ghostface is coming on the 18th, just to let you know, you might be a scream fan
---
From this without context, it looks like you are just trying to be an ass.
---
*laughs 
---
After his upcoming rework
---
I know you meant no harm, and I know it's a joke...
---
I just think about when I was little and kids would say "he's gay" as an insult. I didn't even know what homosexuality was but I understood that it was supposed to be bad. 
---
So, I just think about how times are changing and that should start to change too.
---
That's my main looking like a snacc...making David feel inadequate.
---
So Spirit is the second or third best depending on opinions and she has quite well perks. But she‚Äôs not a killer you want to try right off the bat, she‚Äôs more a good killer if you know how to play the game and utilize her right. 
---
Michael Myers is a good and fun killer with okay perks some better then others. Like Svae the best for last is pretty good. Downside is you have to get to t2 and depending on the survivor that might take sometime and ultimately crush you. Also don‚Äôt just stalk right into T3 make sure you get T3 close enough to full then when you are breathing on someone‚Äôs back go into T3. (T2 means Tier 2 and so on) 
---
Freddy is getting a buff/reworkish so you can wait to see how good he is same with Ghostface. 
---
Pig has 2 good perks and 1 bland perk but your goal isn‚Äôt to Crouch throughout the whole map. 
---
Clown is good enough if you‚Äôre good enough but he‚Äôs not amazing but he has 2 good perks. 
---
Doctor and Legion I wouldn‚Äôt worry about. Legion does have Discordance a truly wonderful perk. Doctor has MAA which is great for Michael. Then the other perk is a skillcheck perk which is more reliable on rank 20s-10s I believe but could be a wasted perk.
---
Hag is great and has 2 out of 3 good perks but they are hexes so you are chancing good rewards for good effort if they don‚Äôt destroy the totem. 
---
Leatherface is alright but Good if you‚Äôre already skilled at the game with 3 not too bad perks. Bbq is the best out of all of his perks though.
---
You can get banned for using a macro on pc dude, this is essentially doing the same on PS4
---
I have been here. Mine was in front of the hatch. Didn‚Äôt make it out
---
Fucking Nothing
---
all the survivors run to him to be close with him...ez game
---
Even with Context.
---
Throw it!!
---
what do you mean by "i'm tear up"?
---
Cupcakke would be so proud of this. ü§£üíÄ
---
The norm in society is heterosexuality so there doesn't need to be awareness. I feel like it's a very simple concept to grasp and I also feel that you are most likely saying all this just to be controversial.
---
Its a secret addon you put on called "FMJ hatchet head"
---
Me cry
---
This is what Bubba's wet dreams look like
---
I saw this post and literally "respected" it and took a step back.
---
Thanks I wasn't planning on sleeping anyway
---
Bad grammar
---
I meant 4k as a killer and escaped as survivor. Did you fail English, you abominable twat?
---
it's okay but i'm a bit confused 'cause i don't know if you try to be sarcastic with this post or not :))
---
You know it‚Äôs a face camping Killer when they use frosty eyes
---
things like this always happen to me when I'm a survivor and never the killer..
---
Honestly they need to just get rid of the struggle phase. It's annoying as fuck, terribly unintuitive for new players, and super punishing if you skip a beat for .2 seconds.
---
It's supposed to be quieter but it's bugged
---
Wait really?  how much "game currency" does the killers/survivors cost?
---
oh nvm, you were, didn't see the shitpost flair
---
They still can, Feng miscalculated.
---
It's possible she vaulted the window too many times and it blocked.
---
She picked a bad vault location, blocking her view of where Hag was approaching from.
---
She vaulted back and forth right near the hatch, rather than at the next nearest window over to draw Hag close enough to watch Feng run to the hatch instead.
---
She ran down the outside edge of the wall enclosing the hatch and it gave Hag time to catch up, if she'd just vaulted straight back over the window she'd have been able to get the hatch; even though the killer can interrupt the animation through hatch closing, there's a certain point into the jump animation (when they're already like half fallen into it) that it doesn't seem to work anymore.
---
They would've escaped through hatch despite the fast vaulting if not a dumb-dumb.
---
Starts tomorrow at 2pm EST.
---
oh look! another rank reset Flex! coooool
---
Streamers literally openly admit to using struggle macros on PC. They don't get banned.
---
Just leave
---
sorry im dumb, but what does SWF mean?
---
yeah, it's sad leaving Pig behind
---
survive with friends, duh. i'm slow
---
Strong.
---
"It's cold out I swear"
---
did u notice the flashlight too? ...can confirm
---
It's still a thing home slice, coming from someone who was banned. The Devs are all over the place with it tbh
---
I'm just imagining the hellish requirements for Adept Nurse and Hag
---
9000 shards every character if I'm not wrong
---
seen a few vids..Hybrid Panda and TruTalent...they really buffed him out...I suggest watching this one: GhostFace got BUFFED!! 3.0 PTB - Dead by Daylight \*new update\*
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P96XX0Uiaf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P96XX0Uiaf8)
---
I'm just pointing it out so people know
---
Mostly just trying to point it out
---
She just wants to give you a gift, that‚Äôs why I keep it on my head while escaping
---
ye and I agree
---
so strong that they will have to nerf him in a few weeks.
---
could be a swf dcing, but it sounds more like unintentional DC overall. 
---
Who knows.
---
completely agree
---
I know that's the thing.
---
Happy oink noises*
---
Same :(
---
Wait, wait ... the man has a solid point. Why not shirtless Trapper?
---
Thanks!
---
There was an instance when i was playing Ghostface in the PTB, I was wondering why my cloak deactivated then a wild Meg popped up behind me and we both scared each other.
---
I really want a Demogorgon from Stranger Things but I know I‚Äôll never see it. 
---
Another idea would be the Outlast Twins (ooo a prison map!). 
---
I think overall I‚Äôd love to see more non-human-like killers and more monster-centric killers if that makes sense.
---
Hey, everyone! Watch me bully this person who clearly isn‚Äôt as experienced as I am.
---
I am here for you, brother &lt;3
---
Watching that vid before i actually think they should have started with that and buffed him down based on the PTB reviews.
---
Ranks reset and I found myself messaging people after games. We were crouching to unhook you to not trigger the hag traps or you can break them with a flashlight. Trying to remain calm but it's hard when you crouched in for a basement save and an injured n00b stumbles his way in too trips the trap at the top of the stairs and royally sabotages the entire game.
---
What do you mean with Nurse, I think nurse would be one of the easier -if not the easiest- ones out there. It's nurse, getting kills with her isn't exactly hard. Hag is the one thats really hard since she needs to spend a lot of time setting up, time she can't use to defend the generators, so she basically has to rely on her ruin. But if you get 3 stacks on your devour hope, it should be doable
---
The struggle phase while on the hook is still better than struggling while being carried.
---
Ah yes that or i read your comment completely wrong and mixed. My bad.
---
What hole?  
---
I've not seen the new map design, also i'm with the other dude just let them stuff their holes with hooks :P
---
Nurse requires lots of skill to successfully play, and so does Hag. You can completely miss survivors if you dont play nurse correctly
---
You sat in queue for *only* 7 hours?
---
Shhh dont tell to the devs and let GF to be very strong
---
I'm just glad they buffed him before release. It amazes me that they "released" him in the PTB so weak. I'm sure they don't want another Freddy. I wasn't buying him before, but now I'm def. forking over the cash. I'm a Michael main so I'm a stalky boi. GL
---
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD POINT THOUGH. HOW COME SURVIVORS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING LIKE HEX PERKS? THERE'S PLENTY OF SURVIVOR PERKS LIKE THE ONES YOU MENTIONED THAT ARE STRONG ENOUGH THAT IF THEY WERE THE KILLER'S THEY'D BE NULLIFIABLE HEX PERKS.
---
Some people farm BP
---
Others farm Salt.
---
99.99% of the time you won't wiggle free from the killers shoulder, so you might as well not wiggle unless they want a greedy basement hook. The biggest difference is that you actually can opt to not bother.
---
exact same time? that was a problem with your connection, it will have paused for a second
---
You must be incredibly unlucky or over exaggerating. A little less than 30% of matches have 2 man SWF and way less for 3 and 4 man https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/
---
That's not how book pages work
---
What's audible in-game is part of the balance mechanics. The music is at a completely intentional volume. If you could turn it down everyone would turn off music in the game and turn the game way the fuck up so you could hear survivor's breathing as if they had their lips up against your ears. The music is meant to make sounds difficult to hear, so if you're having trouble hearing something it's doing its job perfectly.
---
It's a licensed character so there is a lot of Copyright laws that prohibit that. That is why you don't see cosmetics for Bubba, The Pig (some coming soon though), Michael etc.. They would have to get the lawyers involved and negotiate $$ and how much they can change an actual Licensed Entity. Would love to see more cosmetics too though.
---
Shit I wanna play that map and new game design! BRAVO BHVR YOU GAVE US A NEW GAME MODE!!! Take my money...
---
I am quite glad that they fixed those issues. Also impressed at how quickly they acted.
---
I dont have the link, but search up year 4 roadmap
---
Naa he looks really ridiculous, i prefier remake ones!...
---
Probably because the [weirdmaggedon theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWvdqkl2UH4) and some other themes in the show make use of reversed sounds and deliberately flipping the order of notes, which sound just like this song when reversed.
---
Yeah.  It did just that.  I've been having some weird issues with my connection lately and figured it was that.  It's really weird and it just does it randomly.  What's weirder is that it counted that I remained and gave me ruthless/merciless killer and my BP.
---
Still stuck on Nurse as well... Then I have the 15 kill, four kill, and Where Are They, then I'm done.
---
Could've been the big DC bug like the one I encountered right after EGC was released, I'll get the link for you in a moment.
---
Asking a nerf now? He has counterplay... he doesnt need any nerfs
---
Say that louder for the people in the back.

---
&gt;Finally, someone understands. Yeah SWF can be really annoying, the only improvement this game did was hiding killer's perks at the end game when someone dies or something so they don't announce the killer's perks like in the old days.
---
are those really hard to obtain or not? Like, do I have to grind 30h to get 9000 ? Sorry if that is a dumb question Im new to that part of the game
---
SEF GEN RUSHERS TRULY NEED TO GET WHAT'S COMING TO THEM IN THE NEXT COLUMBINE OR PARKLAND.
---
ITS THE KILLER
---
Same thing used to happen to me all the time. I changed out my ethernet with a new pne from the store and used a different port on the router (just to be safe) and it hasn't happened since. Hope it works out for you.
---
I played two games today to finish some dailys, I got destroyed in both of them. Only one sacrifice of the eight survivors I faced, and that one only because of end game collapse.
---
That sacrificed survivor sent me a message over PSN to tell me "when your a shitty killer and you need egc to to kill" and another that said "nice Mori you wasted to ashole." I kept all the spelling and grammar errors in. 
---
I responded with "gg, I chased you so long I forgot I had that Mori lol". I don't get why anyone would get that upset, this was my first taste of dbd salt.
---
Sorry I didn't mean now...but after watching some talented killers playing him, comment themselves that he is top tier as in Nurse and Hillbilly maybe even higher, I bet they may nerf him in a few weeks. He is extremely powerful.
---
Myers stalk effects all survivors at once, increases lunge speed, gives other benefits, and lasts longer. 
---
Ghostface's stalk is fine.
---
I wiggle on shoulder all the time because if someone takes the hit for you and you're not wiggling at all, your teammate wasted a life state on you. Struggling on hook though. That's a little different.
---
Probably because like in the movies you've found a new appreciation for life
---
My only gear to grind is when a killer slugs everyone and waits for the bleed out to kill us (at that point I‚Äôm on my phone watching a DBD YouTuber as I wait for my ‚Äòat least you made it to x amount of minutes‚Äô emblem)
---
Unless they add cross play, adding another game mode will screw up the waiting times even more.
---
Just bring your own offering? Or does everyone bring a badham preschool map offering
---
I haven't played GF yet, but watched tons of game play. A lot of his mechanics remind me of the pig. His crouch stalking mechanics especially. Playing one may help indirectly your play with the other. GL.
---
"How is this scary? She's going to easily esca-OH SHIT!"
---
As a Trapper main, give me the daily. I'll finish it and earn the 45k for both of us, yeah? 
---
Seriously kinda wish it was a thing as off the wall as it sounds
---
I'm interested to know
---
As far as i'm concerned if they're dead and i'm not, what they say about skill doesn't mean too much. I don't even stay on the post match long enough for them to do it unless i have a particular interest in something in the stat screens.
---
Did they change it again? I thought now it activates when you get 3 safe unhooks and protection hits. Now it‚Äôs just protection hits makes no sense
---
Maybe once this whole legal shitstorm is over we can get a version of Jason added. I will never lose hope. He's my favorite horror character.
---
David and bill teachables. I get it ain‚Äôt the point but cmon we don‚Äôt need to post the more disliked side of DBD for karma

---
This fucking pebble gets me every time. Unless I actually see the survivor throw it, I WILL investigate.
---
Without Ruin it does. Not a lot of killers work without it.
---
That would be hilarious and terrifying to see coming at you.
---
Fuck this is a good one!
---
Id suggest to fix the bugs and flesh out the egc and adjust some of the perks before going global. But w/e, do what they gotta do.
---
Hahaha no nip steve
---
Bloodwarden should shows your aura when its active and someone is standing in the exit gates. So i dont see why it would light up (if it did) cause you would already be locked in.
---
Solo survivors don't *know* if an insidious Bubba (or *any* killer with insidious) is camping either. They don't *know* if a Pig or Wraith is camping with MYC. They don't *know* if a T2 Myers who's nearly T3 with M&amp;A is camping.
---
There are so many situations where solo survivors don't *know* something and can be one-shot by a camping killer. The problem is, Ghostface gets punished for **not even camping**. He effectively doesn't have a power if he's within LoS of a hooked or downed survivor. But I guess we shouldn't change this because a solo survivor could *maybe* get downed by a killer, who's effectively throwing the game by camping. 
---
All a solo survivor has to do, is realize that no one is getting chased shortly after the person was hooked. If no one's getting chased, then there's a chance he's camping. Once you realize that, just look around behind obstacles GF could be leaning behind near the hook. If GF is in a spot where you can't knock him out of his power, leave and do gens...now you win. Also, there are so many hooks that are practically out in the open. This gives a survivor even more LoS, making GF's power even worse. Not to mention, you can't camp a hook that's in the open.
---
I have a question for you--does *anyone* remember the hatch standoff and how terrible that was?
---
Nah it'll be one more week.
---
Wait how do those connect...? Bloodwarden isn‚Äôt an aura reading perk
---
Jesus Christ. I‚Äôve spent my entire killer career without using ruin and I‚Äôve been just fine. What are other perks/add ons do you use to need to rely on ruin so much?? It‚Äôs definitely a situational perk with so much rng you can‚Äôt control.
---
Low ranks so the killer was just tunneling me and my friend, had to use ds to get away.
---
So you'd rather have hour long queues
---
It is if you're in the exit zone
---
Your aura is read once your inside the exit gate area, basically as a way for the killer to get extra confirmation people are waiting in the exit gates (Likely to teabag you, toxic little cunts) so you can make that power play with blood warden.
---
What he holdin
---
So far
---
Usually just the tunnelers
---
The aura reading part triggers even before you hook someone. It shows their auras in the exit gates as extra confirmation as soon as a gate is open. I used to use it all the time since if I saw everyone in the gates, they were waiting to buttdance and I knew to go into the basement and face a corner while I wait for them to get bored and leave. (This was before endgame collapse)
---
He's saying that neither is exactly an impressive feat you fucking cunt. Obviously you didn't read it.
---
Bloodwarden shows survivors in the exit area even before the killer gets a hook
---
Can I say it?!
---
Only if you wish to suffer.

Actually, I have been consistently a rank 1! I just don‚Äôt play like a potato lmao
---
Badham, for some reason, has two holes that go out of the map. you respawn if you go into one of them, but still. Pretty cool, I guess.
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
 I don‚Äôt get the survivor or killer mains arguments . Why not play both?
---
How dare you disagree! /s
---
Same though, plenty of other killers I'd want before this one.
---
*Whistling*
---
I'm a (crappy) survivor main but I think the killers should be tough.  Like, it should be a challenge and you shouldn't expect to live more than die.
---
I would say yes, but I don't know the rules of the submissions...
---
Say some shit like "Does me standing near you at the hook offend you?"
---
Lol they have this game called identity v and they basically have this guy XD
---
The best way to play as survivor is with friends. If I couldn't party up with my friends, I'd never play this game
---
Gotta look pretty when you‚Äôre gonna be looking at a survivor on the hook the whole game
---
YOU GUYS I JUST PLAYED THE BIGGEST TEAM OF TOXIC FUCKING DOUCHEBAGS I'VE EVER SQUARED OFF AGAINST AS FREDDY. I'M TALKING TBAGGING AND FLASHLIGHT CLICKING IMMEDIATELY AS THEY CLEANSE MY RUIN RIGHT AT THE START. THAT CLAUD IN PARTICULAR KEPT THE CLICKING GOING THE ENTIRE GAME. REALLY ANNOYING LOOPS AND SEVERAL FLASHLIGHT BLIND DROPS THROUGHOUT. ADMITTEDLY IT WASN'T MY STRONGEST GAME BUT THREE OF THEM HAS GOOD FLASHLIGHTS FFS.
---
BUT LUCKILY I GOT MY REVENGE. THEY WERE SO COCKY THEY KEPT TRYING TO HEAL AND GET EVERYONE OUT DURING EGC WHEN MY NOED WAS ACTIVE. KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE THEY WENT DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO IT BUT NO ONE CLEANSED IT. DROPPED THE MOST TOXIC CLAUD, NAILED THE OTHER CLAUD TRYING TO HEAL HER AND CUT OFF THE NEA AS SHE TRIED TO SNEAK OUT THE BACK TO THE EXIT.
---
THE LONE DECENT ONE JAKE WAS DOWNED SOMEHOW TOO BUT CRAWLED OUT RIGHT BEFORE I HOOKED THE TOXIC CLAUD AND HIT DAT BLOOD WARDEN. 
---
TWO D/CS AND ONE ACTUAL DEATH ENSUED.
---
GLAD THE JAKE LIVED. FUCK THOSE OTHER IDIOTS. I'D LIKE TO RAM THOSE FLASHLIGHTS UP THEIR ASSES.
---
I love seeing Ash vs Evil Dead get some meme love. What a great show
---
Whaat? I didn't know that was even possible. That seems like it's really unintended, looks like trapper is floating.
---
It's amazing, but boy would I be salty if that happened to me.
---
Make Wesker a skin for Billy, have him like roar or something and dash forward with a downing punch

I was going to give her the hatch anyways so I didn't double-pip, but she was taking too long so I closed the hatch to activate End Game and then she zoomed out of nowhere with her key lmao

From patchnotes 1.56:
---
Fixed an issue that caused Blood Warden to show Survivors‚Äô auras when outside of the exit gate, and before the requirements were met.
---
Pretty sure theyre now shown when theyre locked in.
---
Learning counterplay to a new killer is still something new
---
can you still 360?
---
.....
---
Unless these specific players did it to you you're just being an idiot. Not to mention wasting everyones time. 
---
Just hook them (if you can. I'm guessing you've had issues with these players before) and move on.
---
Gone.......
---

Locked away forever

It woulda been so funny if Nea had found the Hatch right as that happened.

Omg thanks! I didn't even notice.
---
A portal themed map would be pretty cool
---
I wish distortion had more tokens usually the perk is gone before its even mid game
---
The fact that you can see the outlines of his spine and shoulder bladesp on his back is really unsettling and well done, however, the Bell-Bonger9000 is a bit uninspired. Overall 8/10 tho!

Okay now his perks need a buff
---
So does Marked mean Exposed?
---
But temporary as it‚Äôll dissolve away a few seconds after triggering the traps, thus not allowing you to gain the nutritional benefits of the nugget.

Most of killers already have trouble with survive with friends, but yeah this concept has critical weakness against them.

There was a kid who killed a close friend of his because the friend didn't/couldn't return the borrowed in-game currency. So.. yea..
---
I appriciate that!
---
Anyone who says Pig is top tier is actually crying for help because they are locked in the gideon meat plant, it's their only way of communication or else Amanda will pop their heads off.
---
Yes!
---
when the circle around the survivors name turns red they become exposed. 
---
Default exposed  time on PTB is 45 seconds :)
---
bloody spireh
---
Don‚Äôt see how this is toxic or karma. Just the killer playing the game. Is it toxic because they tried to kill you?
---
Wait so does that mean survs can turn their camera to their backs while working on gens?
---
Well then how come the other survivors are so good at pallet looping? They know exactly which way to run even when they can't see the killer.
---
We‚Äôll make it and botany knowledge don‚Äôt stack
---
Bruh
---
using devour hope is toxic?
---
Yeah its just no skill. Remember to crouch around gens and hooks when youre against the hag. You wont set the traps off
---
Wu Tang Clan ain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô to fuck with
---
Ghosty boi is looking at it like he's trying to figure out what happened to it
---
Even if he couldn't see my aura, Territorial gives a distinctive sound cue when entering the basement from the killer's FOV.
---
But theres a bloodhunt tomorrow :o
---
I know how you feel man. It's mostly 50/50 for me in matches where I get camping killers. Sometimes you get away, sometimes you dont. Most of the time your own anger and frustration CAN and WILL cause you to lose. Almost 75% of the killers that have camped me in my experiences are either hag or leatherface so I understand your haggy problems. My opinion/advice would be to take a small break...nothing drastic like a few weeks or anything...more like hours but after that break you just jump right in and you'll feel refreshed and ready to play with a positive attitude again. I hope my comment helps even if a little
---
bm‚Äôing?
---
Any killer gets 4k in "bad" ranks, survivors who doesn't know how to play don't know the maps or how to loop correctly, sometimes they run to nothing, they are still scared of the terror radius, etc etc
---
Netflix recently tweeted out their partnering with behavior, so it's actually a possibility.
---
Now make one but with patrick scaring squidward with "genrushing"
---
ohhh clearly a bug, but that'd be annoying after the millionth time.
---
Seems like more effort than it‚Äôs worth honestly. Just click the damn button.
---
i audibly gasped holy shit
---
are you asking what it means or are you asking for examples?
---
Honestly the best defense for hook campers is to just knock out gens. If they decide to just sit there and lose the game for one kill, they are probably not that great, and they will learn one day. I feel like a couple good losses to survivors who know to do gens is enough to teach anyone that camping a hook is not the way. I learned real fast back in the day haha
---
The 13 of each month are the rank resets, maybe is that?
---
What does it mean.
---
Who is that
---
Lol I loved that little head shake you did there, like if the Hag was saying "this doesn't involve you".
---
Oooh. Okay that would make sense thank you
---
Well that escalated quickly
---
You're mistaking horror-comedy like Evil Dead (hence puppet hand) with an actual horror movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Chainsaw Massacre, and The Saw. I dont remember seeing Michael Myers trying to be funny and wear a horse mask or do something funny for the audience purpose. Ash gets a pass on the puppet hand since it's part of his lore and character unlike all the killers and most survivors.
---
The teams have been auto-balanced
---
You are now on red!
---
Go choke on a hook.
---
Good ole Robbie
---
Most of the "exclusive cosmetics" are just recolours. I like Kates top variant but again thats just a recolour...
---
Why list Evil Dead when that comedy GOLD is in the game already?
---

---
Wow look how toxic he was. Using Devour Hope instead of something good. W O W

Rainbow six siege character whose main ability ingame is to kidnap an enemy player to learn the location of others.
---
phantom of the opera wraith, miner trapper, prospector jake, demin adam and neon joey
---
To prevent the survivors from dcing alot of the time
---
Ahh, I see. That makes a lot of sense actually, thank you for explaining. This is a straight line chase though, I suppose? A killer might reduce that advantage by cutting the survivor off.
---
Gotta have boil over and a Sabo team to really make struggling work but the wiggling does limit how far the killer can go
---
not yet, june 18th!
---
So you are saying respecting pallets is the right play?
---
The power sounds neat but she doesn't look like a "killer"
---
There's so many hooks on maps now, that taking hits is basically pointless.
---
I've tried to play killer a few times. I was not good. I'm not good at survivor either but much better than killer.
---
Do I need to mention Scream with all it's goofy teenager gimmicks? It is in the PTB as we speak lmao
---
Then she does memento mori (INTERROGAAAASION), then all survivors auras reveals for 10 seconds.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt count on survivors DCing simply because there is a killer. And you lose hook points if they DC early. So yes, it hurts you.
---
They need to have hook camping hemorrhage bloodpoints. Killers dont care about ranks. In fact the lower the rank the better/easier BP. If they changed the current system to losing BP in lieu of emblem points I think that would help a lot. As it stands most killers can only benefit from camping and tunneling.
---
Another change I would like to see implemented is a variant to survivors "safe unhook". A killer penalty to downing a survivor just off the hook... No need to punish the person being farmed.
---
I swear the hook camping goes up like crazy when rank resets Ive gotta run ain't camp builds now
---
‚Äúbad manners‚Äù it basically just means that they‚Äôre being toxic
---
Yeah, let's ignore the entire comment and focus on what's irrelevant. That is GOLD.
---
I‚Äôm love you
---
My friend group all call the Doctor "Mr. Vice President" already hahahah
---
People like that Claudette are cancer, but that‚Äôs literally the survivor objective, to do the generators. If she didn‚Äôt pip because she didn‚Äôt do enough that‚Äôs on her
---
I pitty the fool that comments on some shit that they don't belong on. Lmao downvote and move on sucka
---
Give it productively and not like someone who just stubbed their toe yelling at what they hit
---
Its basically only used to prevent you getting put in the basement if far enough away. Or a lucky wiggle if the nearby hooks were destroyed/occupied. I do think hook placements seem to have gotten a bit too close with recent reworks but will hopefully get balanced soon.
---
I'm not just cause I don't want to download a ptb, get 2-4 games then redownload the normal game for bloodhunt. Not the best timing on this one
---
Not very sneaky, I mean... If a person has good hearing and a decent volume, can know that there is a survivor running behind
---
What is you died and now you're in DbD?
---
Honestly my favourite skin in the game is Legions Frank varsity skin. Something about it just vibes with me
---
What is in the PTB? Goofy teenager gimmicks? This 'Ghost Face' is not part of the Scream franchise.
---
I enjoy the taste of ^v ^o ^ i ^d
---
VROOOOMMMMM

I honestly don't see what the issue is, but maybe it's just a matter of my limited perspective of copyright laws.  Half to the devs, half to the lisenced studio
---
I swear I do not understand the people who complain about NOED, it surpasses me
---
She‚Äôs starting to go into hallucinations from the lack of her medicine and she was basically told ‚ÄúThis is your life saving medicine and a cure for your poison‚Äù so granted common sense would work well but she was already on the medical equivalent of a second phase hook
---
It is representing the Scream franchise and is a licensed killer, but think what you want because you have a brain and the ability to type.
---
You talking about when he was swinging at you? He was probably just trying to kill you but couldn‚Äôt get it to work.
---
I have a link to those two as well in the imgur attachment.  One from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning remake, and one from Texas Chainsaw 3D.  I like the 3D edition the most.  Old, almost greying, but still a terrifying beast.

This this this. Please pick this bhvr

Disagree all you like, your arguement carries absolutely no weight. I will happily continue to entertain myself with you as long as you keep responding tho. Woooooooo
---
YOU NEED TO DEALS WITH IT, ITS AN AVAILABLE PERK AND THERE IS NO RIGHT AND WRONG WITH IT
---
No, but since you couldn't figure out my (ridiculously simple) message, you must be illiterate. I was saying that you aren't impressing anyone by saying you've 4K'd and you're not impressing anyone by saying you've escaped as a survivor. Both are easy. Also, I appreciate your unnecessary swearing towards me since I pointed out how small your achievements actually are. And since swearing is apparently ok, go fuck yourself you miserable inbred, toothless mother fucking bastard man-child.

no theres an addon you can get for pc that literally does this for you on hook
---
This guy is looking into the real issues
---
I hate being left behind so been trying out builds that let me save others especially towards end game.
---
Playable now, but still bad. Power still gets cancelled by using your camera, and he's still not immune to detection perks like T1 Myers. D tier at best.
---
With the same success as this person? because I'm talking about those levels of success.
---
It is true that I am assuming his rank, but if this person is a new player and is doing very well with a killer that objectively does not belong to the top of the best killers, having little experience in the game (as a new player), it is most likely that is in a "bad" rank
---
Survivor main: But, seriously?
---
Oh wow he got he down...it‚Äôs a legit good strategy! The killer doing it is still dog shit at the game. So best case, the survivors are aware the complete lack of skill Wraith is camping while cloaked, and leave the hooked survivor to do gens. Hooray, nobody really gets any bloodpoints and they most likely won‚Äôt even pip. It‚Äôs stupid and ruins games, but go ahead and defend it I guess?
---
This game isnt particularly hard to rank up in to be fair. When I got it a few months ago I got into 8 pretty quick.
---
He may not be as good as nurse or billy, but hes incredibly underrated. His mind game potential is really high, especially with some of his add ons.
---
With the changes from PTB, people will have more reasons to cleanse totems, even if the killer doesn't have NOED.
---
Finally someone else sees that
---
Will he be available with shards
---
Still, the GhostFace mask is licensed. Still licensed killer.
---
if this is a "friendly" reminder, where is my hug?
---
as Survivor its possible
---
The people that complain about it are the solo players generally, I know for myself I never get hit by Noed my team clears out the totems within the first 3 minutes or so of a match
---
Actually if you ask any Silent Hill fan. "Where did Pyramid Head come from?" Everyone is gonna say "Silent Hill 2" as he acted as the main antagonist for the main character and played such a big role, even able to acquire his weapon. Yes the movies uped his views but only a true fan would know his origin. Plus as Gamers I would think many of us has played the Game before seeing the movies and would pick that out first.

You said my comment didn't belong and I am not a teenager and haven't been one for more than 10 years lol. I am not even reading your full comment because it is based on you misunderstanding me with your little brain. I was mocking you trying to for shame me for posting.
---
Eat some airline nuts
---
This is accurate beyond so many levels. Thank you. I shall prescribe these to all the complainers.
---
I expected NOED, but this hurts way more
---
Instant buy without question
---
Wraith isn't too bad anymore indeed, but I think he is too add-on reliant. He seems strong with green and purple add-ons, but without them, not too much.
---
Its a fact lmao. It even says it on his Wiki. It's helped me get many of my cannibal dailies. It also is the sole reason I unlocked the Dwight mask(leaderface). If you don't believe me check his dead by daylight Wiki
---
Santa Clown
---
It said hard to swallow but damn never expected you to choke on it like that maybe back up a few inches
---
Even that means 3 people were not doing generators, so it's still pretty detrimental. So now 3 people need to heal and 3 people aren't doing gens. It's way better to just have the person be hooked and have had the other 2 doing generators during his/her chase.
---
What? Playing matches doesn‚Äôt get you Iridescent Shards. The only way to get them is to level up your player level.
---
I think you might need to change your flair, my dude not very fitting to your attitude.
---
The system in place is that when the killer camps your team should knock out like 2-3 gens.
---
As survivor you can do basically nothing, escape through hatch and Depip but get the adept trophy. As killer, even if you 4k, if it was a short match or people dc or you do too well with applying pressure and only get like 6 or 7 hooks before everyone is dead, then you'll likely not get the double pip and therefore not get the trophy.
---
Is it completely unreasonable for a trophy to be difficult but still fully possible to get? Absolutely not. Does it seem fair that the survivor adept trophies are, in comparison, much easier to get than the killer ones? Not really.  Even if it were just changing the survivor ones to require a double pip as well to make them more similar in difficulty instead of making the killer ones simply a 4k, then I would think that it's more fair.  I think many people may be upset by making something harder, and a double pip as survivor is even more RNG based/uncontrollable than a killer double pip is but at least the conditions would be standardized. 
---
A double pip from either side requires some amount of skill, and encourages healthier gameplay than simply escaping or just ensuring a 4k.
---
EITHER WAY, the current state feels unfair for killer players/ casual trophy hunters.
---
whatever nrd
---
Ace In c tier!! You thick cunt
---
Inaccurate on many levels, it‚Äôs not that players are to lazy to do dull totems it‚Äôs the fact that they don‚Äôt give you any benefit for doing them. In the 14 seconds it takes me to do that totem I could have had gen progress done, altruistic by healing people, saving off hooks or even looping the killer. The benefit for doing dull totems prior to the new PTB isn‚Äôt there. Especially for solo players who only care about themselves
---
One Tip; dont waste too much time chasing one person, if you dont think you'll be able to catch them in a timely fashion find somebody else.
---
Yea she‚Äôs awesome
---
When I play killer and seen somebody do this to someone I make an active effort to punish that behavior and let the person they did it to go just to spite them in the hopes that if they get punished enough they‚Äôll stop
---
I assumed the penalty was the Hag being able to transport through the trap and be closer to you. I‚Äôve seen Hags jump through traps and instantly hit people, it just matters if their fingers are fast.
---
Had this happen when someone saved me off the hook. They probably thought I was afk but I was frantically plugging it in before the killer came back to end me.
---
Is legion good? He seems fun for sure, but isnt he like Low tier? maybe I should buy him after I other Killers at good level
---
*Everybody's Super Sonic Racing, try to keep your feet right on the ground!*
---
Since when did Hag traps turn to something similar to Trapper traps?
---
2 PM EST
---
They can also be put of range, and not be able to teleport to traps. The main point of the camera turn is to make sure you can't just ignore the traps. It disorients you and gives the hag time to possibly teleport. If there was no effect other than the noise then she would be c tier or worse.
---
dry your tears before answering me
---
I don't understand your question. Can you rephrase that maybe?
---
You can walk out if the trap isnt activated, which means if the trap was put on before the last gen was done then you have to take it off before you leave
---
It‚Äôs his creepy eyes that make him look bad.
---
The only time you can get out of the gate with trap is if she put it after the endgame collapse has started. If she put it before then you'll still die.
---
On the off note, your fight-stick‚Äôs button shouldn‚Äôt be registering as mashing while holding it, that‚Äôs probably not good(It ruins execution in Tekken). I‚Äôd look into some better buttons to install, especially since I hear that one in particular has easily mod-able parts.
---
B tier actually
---
If the trap was active it will still kill you. It won‚Äôt kill you at the gate if it was put on after the last gen was powered.
---
mew see people leave because it's not activated since it doesnt activate after the gens are done. An active trap still kills mew
---
Are you telling me his name isn't John Halo?
---
There is an addon for that, but it is an ultra rare so it can be hard to come by.
---
Tbf that happens more than it should
---
Well I‚Äôll obviously be a little biased as a Legion main who on occasion dips into Michael and Freddy. Personally I think that he‚Äôs in a good place, and I find that I manage to ‚Äòwin‚Äô games as killer (2-4 kills and pipping) quite often, even as I go up in the ranks. 
---
Thing is his power is for getting a first hit and stalling so to end chases you need to be able to mindgame to a certain degree. 
---
With Legion gens are kind of hit or miss however, because he doesn‚Äôt really have an insane amount of pressure. If you get a hook before or as the first or second gen is done you‚Äôre practically golden and it‚Äôll quite likely snowball from there, but otherwise it‚Äôs gonna feel like a losing game. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt personally say the Legion is low tier, I‚Äôd rather class him as mid-tier. He‚Äôs not the best killer in the game, and he‚Äôs certainly not the worst, but he‚Äôs right in the middle and amazing if you play to his strengths but otherwise can be a little lacklustre. 
---
If you do decide to get his DLC I‚Äôd recommend running Sloppy Butcher on him, and if you want you can pair it with Thanatophobia (not a great perk by itself but it does motivate survivors to heal and with sloppy you can stall the game a ton). NOED is a good choice ok anyone really, but it works well with Legion in the games where the survivors do the gens faster than you can keep up. 
---
Wow this got quite long, my bad dude lol
---
shi ne.
---
You don't need power to tunnel vision 1 surv with mori. And btw, you can put exposed even in chase if you're skilled enough
---
Prayer beads is broken strong, other than that single addon spirit is in a great spot
---
lol
---
?
---
Yep
---
No Big Booty Jane makes this worthless
---
I'm not sure about that, but there definitely needs to be a change. And for people saying that survivors could just look at grass or some shit, let's look at Freddy. He is perfectly invisible when someone is awake, has the grass move for him, has a seven second wait before he can touch someone, *and he still has a very loud, very noticeable hint that he's there* (his lullaby). 
---
Why should Spirit, who is also perfectly invisible while phasing, has the grass move for her, and can **instantly** grab someone off a gen or whatever, not have any indication she's coming? I've had the gen grab thing happen to me a handful of times, and that was some major bullshit.
---
Yep. It's super annoying
---
I have to agree. I don't even think it's *that* broken, I just think a *very slight* nerf is in order.
---
She‚Äôs in the cool tier. The template didn‚Äôt have her on it

Anyone else super sad when they find out people only play survivor or killer? I play almost exactly 50/50 and I just feel that instant aversion 'cause I just *know* they're bad for the health of the game.

Exactly. I think the counterplay should be **hard** but not *that* hard.

You mean you want this Nerf applied to the haha power. You say 'fixed' as if it's something broken, but it's not. It's an intentional design choice to help her power be that extra bit stronger.

Hey thanks, I will have that on mind, and I dont mind reading huge walls of text so dont worry
---
This doofus went on and on about how broken GF is. He's one of those people who complain about the game not having strong killers then complain when a killer gets buffed. As if GF is on Nurse, Spirit, and Billy level. Shut up, HydraPanda.

No thanks. I'll stick with my PS4.

&gt;It‚Äôs like if everyone got mad at killers because they are killing.

....Which, they do.

This makes no sense unless directed at a 4 man SWF. As a solo survivor, I can't be responsible for every totem on the map.

.....uh.

Great.

prayer beads is a unfair add on but alright
---
M&amp;A/Whispers/Enduring/Brutal Strength or Spirit Fury
---
*would've my man
---
Thats because you don't have confidence in your abilities as killer. Idk what you main but if youre a good killer you should go after the healthy survivors, consistently only going for an already injured or hooked survivor just shows that you don't get kills often so you have to, im sorry for lack of a better word, play the baby way? Like, of course anyone can chase an injured survivor right off the hook long enough to down them its how kindergartners would play. This above video is in all honesty most likely someone in elementary or middle school at the most.
---
Italian hands
---
I do agree it's annoying, moreso on console even where camera movement isn't as fluid as PC mouse usage. But it's not a glitch or bug, it's definitely an intentional thing the devs put in her power so it'd be a Nerf to get rid of it
---
I like that you just have to worry about yourself. No shit teammates sitting in bushes doing nothing.

This just happened to me lol!

Doesn't matter, streamers work exactly the same

I‚ÄôM SO SERIOUS- THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER SYSTEM FOR RANK RESETS.

SO WHY THE HELL AM I STUCK WITH POTATOES WHO HAVE 70 HOURS WHEN I HAVE 900 SO OFTEN

Just use spine chill and premonition if it bothers you that much

You know what kind of pisses me off? They can do bug fixes...

So why didn‚Äôt they rush both Uber Jason and the Grendel into the game, then ‚Äúfix‚Äù it later?

I think of it this way, You kill me, you‚Äôre better. I kill you, I‚Äôm better.
---
I prescribe you to take fucking LEAD!
---
Well I won't speak for him but I didn't feel like he was going that far. It's a controversial area, I think, due to a number of factors. I think killers that play at red ranks are going to be more against it b/c they really need any advantage they can get.
---
*I* think the killers should be brought to about the same-ish level (including obliterating Nurse), and then the high-skill survs nerfed a bit, but that's a topic for a different day.
---
Rip
---
Or dropping all of the pallets in 2 minutes
---
This is so cool! I‚Äôd love to see it in game. 10/10
---
I‚Äôm just gonna have to :/ :/ :/ every time I play against her
---
Nah OP is right. You spin and check a notification real quick it can be really hard to tell where that bubble is coming from. Especially since depth perception is so tricky with those things.
---
I just want my bp
---
That‚Äôs not what the issue was for F13; though that applies to Camper likenesses.
---
The legal rights for F13 are being fought over quite viciously, as there is a lot of cash on the line.
---
Ha okay thats a terribly small minded way of looking at the game but okay you cant ever lose at killer then i guess so youre always a winner üëç
---
I think she's the only killer in the game that doesn't have a bad map. Maybe there's a map where she's merely good instead of great (like Lampkin Lane for example), but she's still good on it and for all others she's great. Truly the best killer these devs have created in years.
---
You shouldn't need basically-required perks to play against certain killers, unless they show who the killer is going to be pre-game.
---
&gt;Can you send me a link of the guy teabagging the streamer? Curious if the streamer was acting like an asshole first and Ghostface did it in retaliation.
---
The streamer didn't do anything out of the ordinary and in return, the killer did this. Even then, doesn't matter what the survivor does, doing what you plan to do isn't justifiable in any way whatsoever.
---
Some killers act like assholes because they've been looped for too long, a survivor TBagged them, blinded them at a pallet or got a flashlight save, a survivor has TTV in their names or a skin they don't like. There will always be an arbitrary reason for killers to act like assholes which is why BHVR needs to make acts like yours, punishable. 
---
Personally, if a killer does that to me, I will just tab out in the meantime because I played this game for far too long to bother with petty players. I still wish they make it reportable since I would very much like the option to leave that situation rather than having my time wasted.
---
if that was me as Hag I would have downed both of you. But that there was a man on a mission.
---
Sounds like you didn‚Äôt actually understand my point behind my comment üòÇüòÇ, or that‚Äôs you‚Äôre blatantly ignorant to it
---
I don‚Äôt really like it. The crooked shoulders are more of a Hillbilly thing and I never liked that weapon on the Trapper. But you definitely put a lot of effort into it and ya gotta respect that.
---
Nothing it‚Äôs just what some killers that are not good at pressuring say
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs justified though
---
Now available at HagDonalds¬Æ
---
In a way you‚Äôre not wrong but at the same time I was just referencing titanfall my dude.
---
Don‚Äôt care and no
---
Sure, but plenty of people argued that the PTB was NOT a place to make major corrections. Pretty sure that's who this is aimed at.
---
I would say ignoring hooked survivors for gems, even if they die. That is the only valid definition of this.
---
Relatable
---
Doctor clones regularly scare me.
---
Playing Nea makes the gen look even safer cause of balanced landing
---
Easily the best way to get hate mail if that‚Äôs your thing
---
Yeah, she's definitely the best killer, IMO, that actually *plays DBD* (**Nurse!** lol). But I do think that the killers need to be buffed/nerfed to around the same-ish level to encourage variety (along with nerfing high-skill survs so that the killers can get ggs, ofc). Hence my nerf suggestion.
---
It is a strat just no a good one but,
---
"The Ends Justify the Means."
---
Just last week, a killer messaged me after a game saying I was ‚Äúboring‚Äù because I was ‚Äúhiding all game‚Äù. The actual problem was that we were on the Jigsaw map (one that I often get lost in), and I just was running around the map trying to find generators and happened to not see him. Honestly, it hurt me more because I didn‚Äôt get any points for evading, lol.
---
Yeah, I have my messages turned off on PS4, but even still I got a shot talking friend request.
---
I knew the deal going into the match....LOL
---
I never thought depth perception even was an issue with thrill, or any notifications for that matter
---
&gt;I'm just gonna saw it.
---
Meep! Meep!

---
Yeh idk how you expected me to know that in the slightest? Im done replying now
---
&gt; Why should Spirit, who is also perfectly invisible while phasing, has the grass move for her, and can *instantly* grab someone off a gen or whatever _not_ have any indication that she's coming?
---
Because she is a 110 killer who relies on quick bursts of speed (phasing) to catch people. It would make her near useless if you knew where she was coming from (which she used to have and she was regarded as a low tier killer.) As it is now you can't even grab people properly, and even if you could the _whoosh_ is stronger the closed it is, making it almost impossible to grab people off gens vanilla. Honestly the addon is fine, but it should either be made Ultra Rare, or given some kind of drawback such as reduced time in phase or slower movement speed. Even then it would still be countered by her actually OP addon: Yakuyoke Amulet.
---
She's amazing. I always that blinks four and five should be taken from the Nurse and that she should have an ultra rare that gave her 115% movement speed and one blink. I think that would for sure give her a different feel and be something interesting to try. It'd also even things out with her and Spirit.
---
But yeah I agree, ALL killers should be buffed to Spirit levels. She's the gold standard for how killers should be. A fantastic all around beast. Love her. And she needs that Grudge hair cosmetic. It would fit her so well.
---
üôÉ
---
Lmfao!! I saw this the other day, sent it to my wife. We had a good laugh. But it's SO TRUE. I get so tilted when a killer does this shit to me, but hey, what can ya do, amirite?
---
Your honesty shockingly does not feeling refreshing, but instead unsettles me. I appreciate it!
---
Or if you are playing many of the killers who can't pressure gens.
---
it does depend on how you play any killer I seen some trappers really put pressure down if they can get survivors knocked down fast enough. but ya some killers are better at pressuring gens than others
---
Billy, Nurse and Spirit absolutely don't need ruin.
---
Male, 18, Xbox, SWF. Usually not toxic until the killer starts being toxic. Then that mf going for a RIDE
---
I think he's trying to point out that 3 of them have clan nomenclature for names, which is something I haven't seen in a LONG time.
---
You're right, sorry about that.
---
You definitely don't play against good Billies. I played a match at rank 1 with 2 players over 3k hours and 2 over 2k against SchawbbelTown with brown addons and I don't think he ever m1ed somebody and literally washed the floor with us.

Nasty bitch had Noed on nurse too..... what is overkill?
---
If I‚Äôm just feeling mean, insidious bubba is my favorite go to.
---
Absolutely. I won't comment on the Nurse nerfs b/c that's a whole separate can of worms, but I do think killers should all be around where Spirit is now.
---
 100% true. I haven‚Äôt ran it in forever. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that good as Billy but can do pretty good still.
---
BBQ,  Enduring /SF + any perk of your choice is literally the strongest build he can get
---
oh, you kids these days are always playing that the fortnite! even better is when any game is on the news and you get the obligatory "have you ever heard of this the GTA?? I don't know who would play that smut!
---
&gt;Awhile ago when I didnt own the game I noticed you could play as bill from left 4 dead, but now he's no longer available
---
Are you playing on Console? If so, Bill is a PC exclusive.
---
Ah. That explains it. Thank you lad.
---
Oh man, idk how I could share a screenshot.. but there‚Äôs a sponsored post below this one in the feed on my phone that has a photo of someone‚Äôs legs standing on a board, and because of the placement it makes it look like Michael is standing on it.
---
Glad you got that butthole. Surprised you pulled it off, honestly. EGC with a Billy or Nurse feels so broken. If the exits spawn together you've just got absolutely no chance.
---
well with all the buffs he got few months ago. what do you ask for more? blink trapper traps?
---
That's most killers, you see someone get off the hook and now you know where 2 survivors are (minimum).
---
Can't really do much if he has bamboozle, 3/4 maze tiles on that map were TL walls, not respecting pallets at all,cutting corners perfectly and Spirit Fury-Enduring to force us to drop after 1-2 loops max and a lot of slugging. Im curious how many hours do you have and how would you play against him if you think WE were bad :)
---
No killer needs ruin.
---
I can singlehandly disable NOED with Small Game. It's a decent perk.
---
People really have no right to complain about NOED at this point.
---
I did basement bubba once. 3 people died there, and the last guy got grabbed in a desperate attempt to use hatch. Good times. Felt horrible.
---
As a huntress main I see hits that don't connect yet stll count all the time
---
Starts at 2pm EST. About 12 hours from now.

I just feel like his whole face looks kinda methed out.

Exactly, I thought it was unbeatable for a while until I discovered this perk. It‚Äôs crazy how bad it nullifies it

2pm EDT happens when this comment is 12 hours and 4 minutes old.

I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
Every killer that isn't the top 3 will be obliterated without Ruin at high ranks. It's the biggest balance problem in this game.
---
That was unintended, i sent an email asking this
---
But then what's the point of just not giving them an insta-down, since there'd be basically no counterplay to said stealth? Yeah, stealth killers should be stealthy, but there shouldn't be all but no counterplay to that stealth.
---
Jesus Christ, never thought about this but now I want it more than ever!
---
It just works like additional pudding or streamer.
---
Not to forget that still everyon dc'es

Hard....
---
I like playing swf a lot actually and I even think that was an awesome change lol
---
Well Spine Chill laughs at the thought of Prayer Beads
---
What makes trapper worse than doctor for example? They are both m1, 115% killers. Trapper can catch survivors in his traps, while doctor can cause little annoyance with his shock.
---
I fell in love with Feng's past chinese new year cosmetic, it's turned me into a bit of a feng main.
---
Nea's tokyo graffiti artist and santa clown are also dope
---
You missed the point where I said they need a drawback, or to be made an Ultra Rare. An UR should have _no_ drawback. It _should_ be OP. Look at tombstone, or Bloody Coil, or Clapper (for Wraith.) Yet her Prayer Beads are only rare. If you look at corresponding purple add-ons for other killers they are very strong, but have a drawback. Windstorm for wraith, the mirrors for Myers etc. As it stands, removing the phasing sound _in itself_ is not overpowered, but what causes the imbalance is the lack of a drawback. If they added, say, less phase time or slower speed I feel it would be perfectly balanced. 
---
Tl;dr: it's not op, just imbalanced.
---
Stilts
---
My heart would have been POUNDING when opening the exit gate
---
It isn't. You can cleanse it by doing the dull totems, or if it pops, you hunt it down as it is lit and easy to find on most maps. Nephews here don't remember that it used to be a normal ass perk and couldn't be cleansed. Those were the OP days.
---
It's used often by M1 killers that need some help, like Wraith, Doc, Legion, and by low ranks who need the help and can abuse low rank survivors lack of awareness and skill. They typically won't cleanse dull totems, can't loop for long enough for their teammates to find NOED/Unhook, and aren't coordinated enough to trade hooks and open gates.
---
It's one of those perks that as a new player I felt was very strong, but the more I've played, the more I've matured to put the blame on myself. They can't use NOED if I do my job as a survivor and make the read. And now it catches me far less off guard, and isn't ever a problem.
---
You have no one to blame for dying to NOED other than yourself. You should be cleansing, you should make the read the killers perks, and you should expect it on certain killers and at certain ranks. Lots of things in DBD feel unfair and are objectively un-fun, but not NOED.
---
I think they actually work together with the dbd-team, but yes, it is a rip off
---
Yea I thought so. Can't ease the grind can we.
---
Think it's to hide his/her username
---
Good effort thou
---
Well it wasn't really therapy it was more like torturing someone to create a form of ptsd linked with their homosexual thoughts in order to create horrible anxiety/fear/etc whenever those thoughts come up in order to suppress them, and if that sounds terrible to you well that's because it was.
---
Which honestly sounds like something the doctor would do, except he'd do it to "cure" idk, using flashlights? And teabagging, yeah probably.
---
You‚Äôll get 32,000 (base BP), + 32,000 (BBQ), + 32,000 (from event). Add another +32,000 for your pudding/cake offering or for each additional Bloody Party Streamer.
---
&gt;How does double bloodpoints event work?
---
Im not sure. I think you get like triple bp after every match or something.
---
From what I've seen he seems pretty mid tier. Chases that long where the survivor doesn't take a single hit within 45s are pretty rarely and even then there are lots of killers that perform even worse in such chases. Ghosti can also try to mindgame by hiding red stain/ TR + crouching.
---
I mean the grind is already not too bad. Of course depending on how much time you have to play. 
---
But this event just makes it more easy.
---
UR's should be strong, but not oppressive. There's a reason why people dislike Huntress' iridescent heads  add-on so much. Even with URs, there should be counterplay and the add-ons should not be OP. 
---
I disagree. Removing the phasing sound is OP, because the phasing sound itself is Spirit's drawback (much like Freddy's lullaby is for him in regards to awake survivors, the terror radius is for killers in general, etc.). Prayer Beads allows Spirit to perform without her drawback. That's OP. I don't think a drawback for Prayer Beads would sufficiently balance it, since having no phasing noise for Spirit is so strong.
---
*Is mayonnaise a comment?*
---
What does detectives hunch do again?
---
Destroying a dull totem doesn‚Äôt reveal your location.
---
And suvivors don't need MoM, Dead hard, ds and adrenaline in one build. But here we are.

really! wtf surely when i go into the game it‚Äôll say by bhvr too then
---
Buddy, I literally spend 500 000 Bp on my p2 level 50 Myers to get MaA so I could play some spoopy Myers against rank reset potatoes on Lerys. I gave up after 10 levels or such. Hopefully I ll get it tommorow when it hits.
---
Yeah, this popped up last year, I think?  Caused a small buzz, BHVR said, "actually we helped them out with it a little and they have our blessing", and that was that.
---
Yea, so it is just another ghost pudding. Damn.
---
Yea people are actually that fucking sad
---
Thx
---
I saw a Billy with 6k hours getting rekt by survivors with just 2k hours. But he also played on Haddonfield, so maybe that match doesn't matter too much ...
---
Honestly, BHVR needs to bite the bullet, admit they made their "4 lone Survivors" game into a "team" game, and just give everyone voice chat and then balance around it.
---
I was thinking DBD needed to implement something like that lol
---
Sorry man.
---
I love playing pig :)
---
I SEE YOU MY GUY
---
You‚Äôre an angel

You like the pun?

Can someone make a design of him looking like the food critic from Ratatouille?
---
Nice! Not rusty either! Remember. You can close the hatch now! Unless not closing it was part of your strategy... for some reason.
---
Again?? I've seen this posts countless time.. it's part of her goddam power. The trap positions are important for that reason too helping in a chase. Even like that isn't a big deal, it takes quarter of seconds to adjust the camera again and you don't even need to since you know.. you play in a 3rd person not 1st 
---
It's annoying? Kinda but not that much. I like to play against hag. Just learn to play around her
---
Imagine be a killer hard countered by 1 item and asking for nerfs for basic power mechanics
---
Damn that‚Äôs the same day as Shang Tsung for Mortal Kombat 11
---
It wouldn't have gone this far if the game wasn't so unbalanced and full of bugs/cheesy mecanics since his release.
---
It would also help if the Devs weren't actively thriving and making money on this toxic environment.
---
So many adult jokes in the series actually
---
Way more
---
I'm pretty sure this picture is also like a real picture, so is that ghostface one he has
---
Bruh if you want it just play the roblox game
---
Really? I‚Äôve been using macros for struggle and wiggle since launch. Never heard of people getting banned for it.
---
It takes what, 80 seconds working on a gen alone?  
---
If you have a team mate being chased then you likely have 2-3 people working on one gen, 2 people bringing it down to about 50-60 seconds and 3 being around 30-40 seconds.  
---
A typical chase can take anywhere between 10 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the killer, in that time a coordinated team can complete 3 gens easily, and that's before the chased survivor is caught and put on a hook, which easily affords 4th gen and maybe the 5th if you wanna be ballsy.  
---
Gen rushing is real, denying this only hurts the game's health overall.  
---
There are more than enough streamers and youtubers who play the game extremely well and prove on a daily basis that the game is fully in the control of survivors, and that even if a killer players perfectly all survivors can escape.  
---
But sure, like I said, keep ignoring the evidence that proves gen rushing is a problem, I'm sure if the game stays this way Killers will happily stay in the game and queue times wont be negatively impacted at all.  
---
I mean it's not like it can take me 30 minutes to find a game as a survivor in peak hour or anything.
---
Oh wow that must‚Äôve been fun
---
You need to try to make it look cute. She isn't camping she just wants to spend time with you.
---
Ok that is a pretty good clutch ill admit that.

Haha play hag in a non rank 20 match then we can talk about it
---
I wish legions chase music was Dance Gavin Dance

well thats good news

hmmmm wait a minute...
---
What about the one on the house in mothers dwelling, redwood that's safe because even if they come up you can hide behind the gen and make it look like you've jumped down, they jump down and look up and look like an idiot

It's the bleeding effect

&gt;No killer needs ruin.
---
I would argue that Trapper and Myers "need" because of setup time.
---
 
---
**Why do I have to always use the perk Ruin?**
---
Why can't I use any 4 perks that I want? Why do I have to always use Ruin no matter what? The Players should be able to have the same outcome with out Ruin. But we can't. If you choose to have fun experimenting with other perks then you can expect your fun of mixing things up to be down right Dull. The match will end so fast that you will have no choice but to tunnel, and camp the only kill you can get.   
---
That should not happen. I don't want to be forced to tunnel, and stand next to the hooked player. I want to try all kinds of builds, and have fun.Players should not feel forced to always play one perk every match just because its the only thing that slows the gens down and avg amount.   
---
Players should be able to get the same effect with any build. Other wise what would be the point of allowing so many perks to choose from, and why keep making more???  
---
The whole reason to keep collecting killers and survivors is to have fun mixing perks, and come up with some great, and fun builds. I don't feel the devs wanted one perk to be required every match no matter what you want to do so you have the ability to try new things.  
---
If Ruin feels like it is required always in every match then I say the Ruin perk is not doing its job as it was intended to do.   
---
Players should feel they can have fun with any build. They should never feel they should always play with one perk no matter what.

I understand you, I am also sorry for the peeps who downvoted you. I think we both however can agree on the sexy a little of mods, yes? ;)
---
Aren‚Äôt they changing totems to count towards emblem scoring? 
---
If so, wouldn‚Äôt that at least somewhat alleviate the issue and (hopefully) tempt more survivors into breaking them? 
---
In all honesty I wish there was a totem counter, then it would bring all survivors to the same level of information that 4 man SWF have. Less complaining if NOED goes off too.
---
We AT LEAST need the suspenders. That is all I will settle for

Palette swaps exist so that they can still say "a majority of cosmetics are purchasable with shards" since they flooded the store with worthless crap at the beginning. Meanwhile anything that took more than 5 minutes to make is shards only.
---
Fair enough, not tryna bust your balls, just wasn't sure if u were insecure or summat
---
lmao. pallet swapping is a thing that used to be in the game and i assumed you were making this post as clickbait

It's only 900. You practically do (get them for free), as long as you actually play that char and want them (the pallet swap skins).

See Hannibal Lector is a psychological horror movie. But it‚Äôs such a stellar movie. I have thought of him but he doesn‚Äôt just fit like any other killers. 
---
Unlike any of the killers though he is extremely smart. 
---
But I don‚Äôt know what you could do as a power to make him interesting. Maybe I don‚Äôt have the creativity for that but I don‚Äôt know it just seems wrong. 
---
It would be definitely cool to see him I just can‚Äôt think of any kind of power that would make him awesome and unique.
---
Bikini Kate plz
---
Yeah, but its not as bad as camping. and this dude is trash. What he should have done is hit you and *then* gone after the other guy (unless they other guy had sprint burst or dead hard). It would force you to bugger off and heal, or get hooked.
---
At the end of the day, all the killer wants is hooks. Regardless of what other people are saying, two injured survivors are NOT better than 1 hooked on. If you lose an injured survivor, chances are they are gonna heal. Doesnt matter how long the game goes if you dont hook anyone.
---
Tachanka better
---
If you suggest a new killers you need to describe their powers.
---
Personally I‚Äôm just not interested in the whole ‚Äúbeing hunted‚Äù side of things. I much prefer being the big thing with a knife doing the hunting, I just find it more fun and less stressful
---
But what would his weapon be, or perks? Hannibal is a genius cannibal that tricks and outsmarts his prey rather then brutally hunting and killing them.
---
I'm not too sure if he would be a good fit, although if the dev team came up with something fitting and cool I'd be behind it 100% as Hannibal Lector is one my favorite killers in cinema.
---
I used to be a wraith main and just started playing him again tonight. He‚Äôs definitely underrated and great against most players. Body blocking key windows and pallets is great along with so many other things he‚Äôs capable of. Very strong in the right hands

P3 Claudette alone has smashed the expectation that Prestiged players are supposed to be any good into itty bitty pieces. Don't worry about that.

I usually run enduring, brutal strength, BBQ, and monitor

I agree, he would be much harder to create than anyone else in the game, and wouldn't feel right in the game
---
you know those lil garbage pokers.. that you pick up garbage with... i've honestly never seen one irl but it seemed appropriate
---
does that mean Wraith is the pure original character out of the original 3?
---
A lesser man would think this is an apex reference.
---
I am not a lesser man
---
yeah i'm stuck on the power+perks as well lol
---
Yeah I guess
---
The issue is the devs are doing a horrible job of making the game feel like you've actually been beaten. Over half my downs as a survivor are because of bloodlust, need, lag, or some other bs, and half of my 1/0 Kill games as killer are because of full SWF, gen rushing, or bad totem spawns. This game is frustrating because it's incredibly unskillful on both sides.
---
i kinda self projected and in all honesty it's inches away from a self insert. based off myself n i'm a trans dude pre-t/pre surgery so...lol

Wait. Trapper can instant down with his weapon?

Wow. That's legit creepy.

The fire is a lot trickier than you're giving it credit for lmao but yeah he was kind of blind.
---
If everyone is super....
---
;)
---
I don‚Äôt know about anyone here but a guntoting maniac spraying bullets everywhere just sounds entirely bad. Also it seems as if he‚Äôd be completely weak or insanely OP.
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of a fully auto gun or ADSing in this game it just sounds really bad and needs to be in a game it‚Äôs more suitable to, CoD. 
---
Sure you can make one of a Vietnam Vet but instead of using a gun he has a Bowie Knife in one hand. Maybe he has a gun on his back or hip but he doesn‚Äôt use it it‚Äôs just for looks.  
---
But yeah no pass on this idea a hard pass.
---
You're doing god's work
---
Ability afaik with the honing stone addon
---
There are only two well balanced killers in the game. Currently he's just another easily loopable killer with no map pressure.
---
Where's this from???
---
Do frosty eyes actually do anything???
---
The bar was set so low for his abilities that any improvement was a big improvement. They did an amazing job in one go so that improving him overtime was not needed. Freddy is next!
---
My man, it's a joke, calm down a bit
---
&gt; DBD needed to implement something like that 
---
oh it did, multiple times, one concept was even to make the first hook stage infinite
---
The spirit enjoys eating 'em
---
And why are you mad? Oh it's a free world you can be mad whenever you want &lt;3
---
This is amazing
---
You are amazing
---
No, it's just a cosmetic.
---
Endgame use Whisperer best perk
---
Trick r Treat, it's a horror anthology.
---
Lmfaoo
---
I like the Slasher series that would be cool to see on dbd.
---
Oh good so now we‚Äôll have even more people unhooking me right in front of the killer
---
You are super outdated
---
Power - A Friend For Dinner: When a survivor is within his terror radius, he gets a speed increase of 3.5
---
Perk 1 - Special Facewear: Activates when he loses his prey. Decreases his terror radius by 6m
---
Perk 2 - I Said Closer: You become obsessed with a survivor. For each 250 bloodpoints you will gain from being in a chase with your obsession, you gain a speed boost of 15% for the duration of that chase
---
Perk 3 - Will to Escape: When the survivors power an exit gate, you gain a 25% speed boost
---
(also, I'm new to this sub and I probably should've read the rules but thank you for telling me)
---
Perk  2 - I Said Closer: You become obsessed with a survivor. For each 250  bloodpoints you will gain from being in a chase with your obsession, you  gain a speed boost of 15% for the duration of that chase
---
Objective is ensuring no surv escapes tho, not only keep gens from getting done.
---
Seriously, I dont even play killer besides for dailies, but I can't understand people getting that butthurt over NOED. Sure, it's annoying, but it isn't there every game and ain't like we got no hella annoying perks too.
---
locc
---
Oops I forgot to post were they actually call out behavior in case none of you saw this I will link it https://mobile.twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1138903234356006912
---
Oh stranger things still that‚Äôs dope. Thank you for the link! Have a great day!
---
New to this game but has unbreakable teachable
---
Im about to get r/wooshed right
---
He only has default perks and plays on xbox so he probably just picked up the game from the xbox game pass.Not every beginner is the best you know?
---
Thank you
---
you earn bloodpoints to lvl up the charater, some good youtubers to watch are farmer john. no0b3. and monto to get you started
---
Yeah, also huge props to that first hit like....wow, sure it could have been a gamble and not 100% calculated, but i know i would never do that.
---
bring noed + blood warden
---
farm while trying to keep every survivor together. 
---
when the gates are open, betray them
---
way worse than adrenaline, mom, dead hard, sc
---
Myers wore a sheet with glasses on the outside to trick a lady when he coulda just walked up and stabbed her
---
And people said Chucky will never be added
---
Theres just one slight problem, more than half of team mates are greedy bastards who go for saves and get found in 2 seconds, even at high ranks, so more than half the time, no gens get done because youre getting totems
---
Doesn‚Äôt look that way as in the comments daddy Mathieu responded
---
You know what I was thinking what if Netflix added something to dbd, now I‚Äôm thinking what if dbd was added to Netflix? Like each season has about 7-12 episodes about an hour long but each season is for the back story of that 1 killer. 
---
That would be cool and interesting and I personally love gore and more shows to watch. 
---
Let me add this to my things that will never happen list!
---
I still think he shouldn‚Äôt notify survivors when they‚Äôre marked.  It tells them to go to a pallet loop instantly.
---
Omg I could die so fucking happily
---
When you take a new player (a friend) under your wing, and you watch in disgust as they refuse to play anything but Nurse and bring noed every match because "I've been hit by noed so it's my right to noed others."
---
Then they tunnel a game 1 player off the hook 5 seconds into the match despite having other injured survivors nearby.
---
Why have I failed?
---
1. They need the license 
---
2. They could still have a Pennywise or Twisty in the game. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen the second movie because it looks incredibly bad and mediocre I always see it on Netflix. If you think it‚Äôs good let me know and give it a rating. I personally love slashers so if it‚Äôs like that I will definitely check it out.
---
excuse me what the fuck i'm a Dwight not a Meg.
---
But do you wanna see me do it again?
---
I would be so happy if this was true
---
remove endgame chat
---
Pennywise doesn't fit the lore of the game
---
he kinda does with the traps
---
Understandably but also kinda stretching it.
---
Bruh yeeted the fuck outta there
---
This makes me feel much less guilty when I bully killers
---
I personally liked the new movie. It's more faithful to the book than the first miniseries was. Most likely because this was a theatrical release rather than a tv miniseries so they had more open hands while doing the more controversial scenes. 
---
And the child actors are spot on. Great praise foe them. Bill Skarsg√•rds Pennywise is also way more grim than Tim Currys silly clown.
---
But that's my personal opinion on the matter.
---
‚ÄúAlso he has a minigun‚Äù
---
It's not her add-ons that need a fix it's the fact that she has collision when she‚Äôs phase walking
---
Yea that's what I thought also. He's more similar with the actual Entity than any of the killers. Still, would've been cool.
---
Ah huh that‚Äôs hot! Ah that‚Äôs hot
---
Sorry I meant I haven‚Äôt seen Twistys movie. I thought I worded it right until I reread it my bad. But yeah I like the second it way better, I watched the first it before the second one and it just rubbed me wrong. Also Tim Curry‚Äôs voice does not fit a menacing clown. 
---
But yeah I‚Äôm sorry for wording that wrong I should have said Twistys movie but I didn‚Äôt.
---
I rarely do this but sometimes I will. Especially if you‚Äôve played really well.
---
He feels fast because he has the sluggiest running animation
---
I.... did not know that! I missed the prompt.
---
Absolutely, and it is one of the many reasons why it remains a good show. Jokes for both young and old.
---
If everyone DCs it‚Äôs only fair lol
---
Oh yea sorry. Twisty The Clown is from season 4 of a tv series American Horror Story. He's a complete show stealer in that season. One of the best villains from the show.
---
tjat is fucking amazing. i needed this
---
But how do you determine who‚Äôs played well and who hasn‚Äôt?
---
The ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak ...‚Äù is a well known joke but okay.
---
I run small game and personally start mass totem breaking at the start of the game.
---
And if no one DCs there‚Äôs no way in hell you‚Äôll let them go?
---
Yikes. Someone's out of the loop.
---
Ahh I‚Äôm thinking of a different clown. Yeah I watched S1 of that show and it was kind of miserable I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs good. I heard mixed reviews of that‚Äôs a good or bad season. 
---
So I started off into S2 but that‚Äôs about where I stopped, you know the season where the guy was sticking his hand in a room for a blowjob then gets killed. I think it has something to do with nazis ghost or some shit. 
---
But If Twistys that good I may just skip straight to S4 to watch him.
---
You‚Äôre an ass for tbagging just leave
---
True unless you get lucky and find good teammates or you‚Äôre running with a team of friends who know what to do. It‚Äôs very situational
---
Because they‚Äôll of played well against you?
---
Welcome back to binging with dwightish
---
When killers join in the chaos its absolutely hilarious.
---
Trapper main big brain
---
Usually they loop well don‚Äôt tbag and just really a trooper. If someone doesn‚Äôt play cocky and just plays great If they are last surviving I may give them a chance. 
---
Especially when they do so great with a 5 minute loop and the other survivors don‚Äôt do any gens within that 5 minutes.
---
I don‚Äôt make friends with the guy I will try to kill him but he ended up being last one alive and I felt a little bad and generous and gave him a free escape.
---
Nah.  I rather close the hatch and see them dying slowly .
---
But you can‚Äôt see how many gens they‚Äôve done. I guess you can decide around if they‚Äôre good at evading you
---
Honestly, BHVR is a fairly large company and works on a lot of stuff. It's likely a mobile game based on a Netflix property
---
Good at avoiding you and good when they are caught at looping etc. Not being toxic
---
The hillbilly has a very high skill cap so very brave of you to pick him first. I can't recommend enough changing the turning controls to and q and e for the chainsaw. It's so amazing having so much control over the start of the chainsaw.
---
Still not pipped
---
Oh god plz don‚Äôt miss this opportunity devs plz don‚Äôt
---
I wish u wouldve pointed at him at the end but nonetheless that was beautiful
---
YEAH!
---
Thank you, that was a hilarious comment that really added to this post.
---
Hallowed blight wraith
---
Bill is only on pc so I think they just made his perks available for everyone on console.
---
That was satisfying to watch
---
Not that nurses greatest moment. I P3ed my nurse on PS4 but Ive never done something like that in that time or with any killer its just bad taste gg to dwight itll teach the nurse
---
He's actually pretty decent now
---
Entity: "And nothing of value was lost."
---
I didn‚Äôt.
---
Hmmmmm
---
Because some players are good at making fun chases, even if they do waste your time, thats the point
---
Probably leatherface or Legion
---
Happened to me. Just report it to the devs and they give you some bp back
---
Under the right circumstances it can be hilarious imagining what the survivor is thinking.
---
"He's just standing there... MENACINGLY!"
---
Yesterday I played Nurse on Rank 20 with Distressing, Caulrophobia, Sloppy and ANC...
---
I haven't played for almost 4 months, else I wouldn't have done that but damn I felt soooo bad for doing this.
---
I lose half my team not even two minutes into the round way too often- like what‚Äôs the point?? It‚Äôs not like you lose blood points for dying!
---
It is just as legit as survivors saying abusing infinity pallet loops is a 'legit strat'. It sucks for the opposing party, but it is just as legit as some of the things survivors can do.
---
thank you i appreciate it
---
meep meep
---
just gna say \^Monster
---
kiss
---
I'm gonna guess this a very old meme
---
*"The abyss returns even the boldest gaze."*
---
~~literally~~
---
*snap*
---
You died!
---
Honestly I like to switch too but I don‚Äôt have the patience for how long I have to wait for a lobby when I try killer usually
---
I also do this like almost every single game playing Nurse. Sure, as a good Nurse the game's easy, but sometimes you just feel like the worst dick in the world when you're annihalating the poor Survivors within mere minutes. The only exception is when certain SWF groups attempt to BM me. Then I'm forced to display some dominance but besides of that...
---
So this is my way to replenish some karma lol.
---
Ill try thanks
---
Was gonna upvote till you tbagged, wish you died now.

As a wraith main I approve
---
Well i have 2 exceptions:
---
If i get my dailies done OR the survivor doesn‚Äôt teabag
---
Feels so good getting all the totems when the killer actually brought NOED, especially since I don't run Small Game.
---
I fixed it.
---
In steam add the launch option "-lockMouse".
---
Don't know why this is not a default.
---
Not experienced enough to find every totem without it. Must feel amazing doing it without it lord
---
Personally, I appreciate his effort.
---
I was trying to open the gate the other day and got downed by a nurse who was nice enough to let me crawl partway through before picking me up and hooking me to death lmao
---
Mine is "keep going."
---
You're acting as if facecamping doesn't work, even if people worked on gens. Here's the issue, unless you run Kindred or are in SWF people will probably go and try and save the hooked person, which takes out some of the time and most likely most people will go and try to help.
---
By the time the first person dies you got maybe 1 or 2 gens done, meaning when you go camp the 2nd guy it's too late. You still get two kills. Pop on NOED and people who go "If He FaCeCaMpS jUsT dO tHe GeNs" it means you're not doing totems, so now you have to deal with noed as well. So no, it's not the survivors fault camping killers get kills.
---
How are David and Laurie the best ones lol
---
That pissed me off
---
Perk being not earned does not equal perk being OP. 
---
You don‚Äôt ‚Äúearn‚Äù unbreakable, it‚Äôs just in the event you get slugged. That doesn‚Äôt make it OP, his perk is about unearned perks. 
---
You can do literally zero generators and get adrenaline. If you earn adrenaline then you earn noed.
---
My thoughts, though I haven‚Äôt given any further to how to exact the mechanics, would be luck could increase either blood points or decrease your aura radius, or alternatively have like a percentage chance to make regular skill checks work as great skill checks like how fengs gen perk works but obviously lower in occurrence.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
It was after a stressful game and i forgot i had bbq in the web. I was leveling up Doc for distressing as well so i make fast and when i did, it is gone
---
To be fair it's also glued down. Even if she didn't stick her dumbass hand into the other hole, she fucked up and pulled the needle open so would've died to gas unless she found another trap. (Ironically though this isn't even her trap, and there's got to be at least 4 others around the house.)
---
Hard to swallow pill, you want survivors to waste their time on totems even for killers who don't use noed and probably would like to have survivors searching all the chests for useless items to buy more time for killers, uwu
---
What do you mean shitpost? This is art.
---
He‚Äôs still low tier, removing his detect would make him mid-tier at best.
---
probably thought they played good enough
---
That‚Äôs less reason to cleanse them actually. Ranking up is already too easy and being in red ranks is not rewarding at all. Only thing it gives you is 5 min queues as a solo survivor (at least on console)
---
It was after a stressful game and i forgot i had bbq in the web. I run through the blood web as usual with the freshly gained points and when i took it, i was screeching. Bbq still not reappearing after that.
---
I misclicked the edit and delete of the above reply lkl
---
That strawman is so massive it could tear a hole in reality,
---
.... No one will be.
---
Maybe you‚Äôve mistaken him as legion or friend had borrowed time.
---
No, it was ghostface, lol
---
Even it out, make it 1 pip for both sides. That decreases the insane requirements for killer, especially at high tier, and increases the complete ease of survivor at all tiers.
---
I mean, you‚Äôre stating that those 4 perks together are equal to noed which might be true.
---
Than I‚Äôve got nothing else to say
---
Part of it is finding a killer you clique with. Some people have an intuitive sense on how to use a killers power first find yours. Mine was wraith at first as I could get really close to them without drawing too much attention unless they were super vigilant. Also remember that most obsticles in the game are the same they might be arranged differently and rotated but theyre the same. It takes time to learn the various map pieces and how to get around them. Most low rank players just continue running straight away from you after dropping a pallet or jumping a window, keep that in mind and ask yourself is it worth going around or through the pallet. In ranks 10 and higher you start getting in to players who really know what theyre doing and theyll try to mindgame you at a window or pallet in order to make you go a wrong way instead of they way they went. As a wraith if a chase was getting to be too long or I felt like this player was going to be difficult I would re-cloak and start walking away in some direction but keeping an eye on that player, stalking them until they felt safe and stopped to heal. At that point Id try to sneak back up to finish it off. 
---
So in short find a killer you seem to already play well with using its power effectively, over time youll understand the various map pieces, if a chase is too long its ok to leave knowing when to leave comes with practice and your pactience, as a killer you have your own mindgames with various map pieces, and just practice.
---
Or you could forget nearly all of that and get good with Nurse lol As long as you practice enough windows and pallets do nothing to the Nurse. I played her on console as a challenge to myself as people say she's usless at high ranks on console and at 100% sensitivity you can wait for a pallet to drop blink through it and turn around fast enough that they dont have time to get across it and get a hit. Yesterday was rank reset and I already got 2 salt mail for using her. I have no idea if anything I said helps but things will fall together for you in time.
---
Fire barrel OP
---
Most likely it'll be $4.99 as it's only the killer and not a survivor and map.
---
4.99 it's just a killer like Leatherface
---
You have my attention.
---
I actually find doing gens and hiding more fun to be honest. Even though putting up a good chase can be fun from time to time.
---
You know the rules trapper always has NOED
---
Private profile = plays in a 4 stack regularly enough to need to.
---
As a pure killer main, I strongly support this totem counter idea floating around.  If survivors knew how many totems are left, this would help both killers and survivors overall.  Survivors would spend more time cleansing totems than repairing gens granting killers precious extra time, and survivors would know if they should keep looking for totems allowing them to effectively prevent a possible noed FAIRLY because of the time invested.  Killers should also have a totem counter to give them a choice to possibly defend dull totems.  This would benefit the game health GREATLY.
---
They did it. Survivors finally learned bloodlust. This is the end of all things.
---
I'd argue that downs due to NOED/Blood lust are just you being beaten and not BS.  
---
Same goes for being "gen-rushed".
---
Had no idea Oroboro the ninja plays dead by daylight
---
2 mixtapes in 1
---
I mean, if you don't play nurse, then sure it's hard to get used to her because she plays veey differently than other killers, but it kind of pisses me off when people say she takes skill. Nurse really doesn't take all that long to become good at. With Hag I totaly agree, in my opinion she is the killer that requires most skill in this game.
---
Did you see it in HybridPanda's video?
---
Preacher
---
&gt; Uhh I don‚Äôt know what type of survivors you play against where this works. Sounds like you play hag as a chaser, which is the wrong way to play her. Hag as a chaser is an awful killer.
---
&gt; 
---
Play Hag? Not while I am sane. She is one of the worst if not the worst character in DBD. I don't even have her DLC and thanks for Shrine giving me her 3 Teachables, will never do. 
---
I am talking from the survivor perspective. Maybe once every 20 matches I encounter a Hag that doesn't play like this.
---
Maybe the other guy was a teabagging nuisance.
---
Still, a free hit on OP has points.
---
Jesus... did you ever play the game darkwood? this looks like something STRAIGHT out of it
---
No, just happened to me. Confused the hell out of me
---
I think op means noed, trapper with noed is a stereotype
---
Why's it a stereotype with Trapper?
---
&gt;Plus, like, adept trophies don‚Äôt actually mean anything besides a spot of data for your profile, so I‚Äôm not really sure why it‚Äôs such a big deal.
---
Pretty bold statement. In life, nothing really matters untill we give meaning to it. Why do we care about winning? Why do people collect stuff? They are artificial goals we set for ourselves that get meaning because we give meaning to it. I am an achievment hunter and contrary to some other games, in DBD it's actually possible to get all achievments, but with the change to merciless victory, it changed from something doable to something you need to get lucky at and could have you busy for 5 hours per achievment.
---
nothing more wrong than this
---
\&gt;I just find it more fun and less stressful  
---
\&gt;Killer  
---
Wait until you reach the higher ranks and play SWFs, unless you're there already and just don't care about getting kills
---
I think it's similar to how he has the ability to have Killer Instinct on the Survivor who spotted him. Now, keep in mind this is just my logical thought, maybe hitting that Survivor applies the Deep Wound status effect on the Survivor.
---
Nice don‚Äôt see a problem here honestly hated the spot mechanic.
---
I don't think that would work too well on the model, or for the ability.
---
So you‚Äôre like 100% trolling right? She‚Äôs a top 5 killer?
---
Letting the last person go is communism. I won't have it.
---
Although if you spawned in alone or your team DC'd I'll probably let you farm
---
Wahhh he pressed ctrl on me
---
Bad Reception would be useless on mobile though, the port will already run at permanent T3.
---
yeah, i'm just bored so i came up with this shit lol. i'm shit at this sort of stuff so i would not be surprised if this is trash, but it's obvious this would never be added.
---
Oh god oh fuck look behind you boys, it‚Äôs bloodwarden
---
Hi, I‚Äôm Claudette and welcome to my powerpoint presentation

That was a farming killer, would've escaped either way.

Maybe I'm remembering wrong, or thinking of a different game.

Didn't BHVR get a huge payment under the table, to say that it was a partnered game? Like there was a shit load of evidence pointing to them never meeting, and the way the announcement happened only at release, was never hinted at before. Then all of a sudden when the shit show started BHVR posted that video saying they helped them. 
---
I just remember a lot of sketchy things going down, and the Chinese residents pointing at a very clear rip off from their POV.

Lolwut? 
---
There are 9 classes in Team Fortress 2, yet many players only play 1-3 classes well.
---
There are 10 perks in Killing Floor 2, yet many people only play the same 1-3 perks well.

The same shit goes if I ask you, how many Killers do you play? Not everyone? Well, I am super sad to find that out ;-)

The fuck? Are try gonna make a mini-series? Would be cool. :&gt;
---
You can use Unbreakable when you made a mistake by going down, you get DS when you were off the hook and got downed so that is 2 mistakes, you can use mom to cover up one mistake. You get adrenaline for free and it can fix one or when timed roght 2 mistakes. 
---
You get NOED when you as you say it, make the mistake of letting survivors get 5 gens. However you forget that a weaker killer can be looped for 80seconds thus 60% of the gens will be finished. Then one saves, one does a gen and one gets chased and boom another 2 down. A good survivor team will destroy a good killer player with a weaker killer. It takes around 4minutes for a good team do all 5 gens. If the killer leaves people to go to gesn the left survivors does a gen himself. 
---
You decide how long the game lasts, if you wanna make it 4minutes and not do totems fine, but you can easily cleasne all 5. There even are 3 perks to help you with it. Don't say NOED is op anyone can cleanse 5 totems before the final gen is done. You not doing so doesn't mean the perk is OP.
---
If you delve into the patch notes it says that he is spotted on a more centralised part of the screen - You did basically NONE of this in the video until the end where he found you, well done.
---
Secondly, it specifically states in the patch notes that to spot him while he is crouched you need to stare at the top of his head.
---
Take those two pieces of information, watch the video back, delete it, this post and move on with being wrong.
---
I saw this one on the forum before and I want it to win.
---
Adrenaline rewards survivors for staying up long enough and actually surviving, NOED however does quite the opposite, rewarding killers for not killing their victims fast enough.
---
Wait so you are saying I wasn't looking at him?
---
In brief, no. Every game you ever play will be toxic and salt, and I don‚Äôt think that will ever change
---
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie

Not in the central part of the screen? Yes. Read the fucking patch notes.
---
Centre means you know, top and bottom of the screen, not centre vertically? Is this hard information to digest?
---
Ypu give him too much credit, some people are just flat out bad at the game
---
I'll assume you've been playing a lot of killer, or only exclusively killer?
---
You will hardly ever notice you're lagging, but the survivors sure will feel it every single game. Just know if you're playing killer (host of the game) with garbage internet you have an incredibly unfair advantage.
---
This is the type of creativity that dbd needs more of
---
I think luck should increase your chance of getting skill checks.
---
Scanning around and seeing Michael looming there just staring, that and tripping a hag trap are the only things that still make me scream out loud in that game.
---
It's not. People who whine about NOED are just salty because they refuse to cleanse dull totems, you can completely prevent NOED from even being a factor if you actually cared about it, but people don't, they purposely get hit with my NOED and then whine.
---
r/hypotheticalcomments needs to exist for this but sadly it doesn‚Äôt
---
that said I would say that if it's like Nurse or Billy who has it, you may not have time to actually cleanse the dull totems, but as we alraedy enstablished the discussion is mostly about shit-tier killers like LF, Trapper or Freddy.

I actually love pissing people off because I play in a conciously fair way, and outplaying someone so hard they lose their shit and act like psychos is hilarious.
---
Dead By Daylight should contact you and ask for it to be in the game!
---
Try going to Settings and then under Account Management select Restore Licenses.
---
Yes.  Atm you can just delay fully marking someone and have the same effect by completing stalk after you already start running at the survivor, so all it would do is allow the killer to surprise the survivor.  It would also add anxiety as to if the killer fully stalked you or not, giving the survivor a choice to play more cautiously or more greedily with their looping.
---
This was clearly a joke. No need to get mad.
---
Spine Chill is good. Change my mind.
---
On paper that works, but in action you usually get found trying to cleanse totems, get distracted by all the other things going on and trying to get your team the fuck out, and get slammed by NOED and die while getting camped becuase you were the only one who could last 5 seconds in a chase and your team just sits there crouching instead of leaving. And then they still die too cause they are stupid.
---
You simply cannot say something is iffy if you do it wrong. Even then, maybe it should have occurred to you were doing it wrong and that you should have double checked the patch notes to check if you had done exactly what was said - hint, you didn't. 
---
It's like trying to but a Cube into a Cylindrical hole with Circle side up and saying "Yeah that hole is a bit iffy".
---
Welcome back-

---
Since when is survivor stupidity a killer mindgame. One does not simply pallet camp spirit (/) (¬∞,,¬∞) (/)
---
i was saying that since the start , you have to have the center of your screen at his head .
---
when playing naturally you'll put his head higher than the center, but you have to make it as centered as possible ( just as centered as your character's head can be ) which isn't naturally and shouldn't be
---
Hahaha what
---
Megs DG mask
---
Ah thanks :) he's like my son :p
---
no, english is not my first language, so let me try to go at it again. in that same vault where OP was hit, you can either be inside or outside the machine. you go on top of the machine and vault outside (like OP did), if the killer tries to lounge like he did in this video, slow vault inside. the killer will try to go around inside again, slow vault outside. repeat as many times as needed, you only need to leave the loop if the killer is coming to vault outside as well. was this any better?
---
It was unintended to get them with 4k suppor told me
---
spirit for killers : "look at me, i'm mindgaming!"  
---
spirit for survivors : "welp, I have no clue what she's doing or gonna do, so I'm going to guess th- Oh I'm dead lol"
---
What time is double bloodpoints?
---
you don't have to talk like that , i think he meant it like ( spotting him should reveal him , not spotting him and then trying to center the whole thing unnaturally) because if you play the PTB and try to center your camera your character's head will get almost in the way and that's when you get the reveal which is spotting him in code , while the Devs meant spotting as seeing him.
---
Who golded this? Jeez this is a petty sub.
---
I mean at least Iron Maiden won't reappear in bloodweb anymore
---
Don‚Äôt hate the player. 
---
Hate the game.
---
yeah he doesn't understand that spotting him should reveal him , that the devs should add this to the pile of situations that reveals him . not us trying to fit with the devs way of seeing while we clearly spotted him
---
That is just stupid. What, you think the 2 second wipe animation is gonna let them get away? God just smack its not like all the gens are done anyway. Stupid tunneling killers can't take a free hit if you let em.
---
Demogordon killer plz
---
Or i can just hate on the petty ultra partisan B.S. this sub constantly devolves into. Apparently only like 10% of the community actually plays both sides.
---
That spongebob one is terrifying as hell.
---
I get tricked by that too. Out of a Killer perspective its really bright. Also loud as fuck. It doesn't work though if you a trying to hide there midchase.
---
Yup I did and had no issues whatsoever it's almost like reading the patch notes made me able to do it correctly.
---
And I understand that character part perfectly, but I didn't say this because the way people learn is by acting and thinking for themselves, you know if you crouch you have enough space? Shock and horror! Survivors have to do something to counter him rather than just looking at him on your screen anywhere?? :O The Shock! The Horror!
---
WHAT??
---
"urgh guys don't you understand it's a TEST build? They were testing to see if anyone noticed that the killer's power doesn't actually function? God, I'm so fucking smart. I wish I hadn't put my shirt on backwards though, when I pop the collar it blocks my peripheral vision."
---
Bloodlust shouldn't exit anymore because infinites shouldn't exist anymore and that was the whole reason it was added (I know there are still some balanced landing infinites or near infinites but those NEED to be removed by devs ASAP)

Someone's salty they didn't get a gold coin XD
---
lol you look like you didn't read my comment at all
---
listen and understand
---
the devs wanted the game to understand how a player can reveal GF ok ?
---
by that they coded the way reveal works which was broken before,  now they wanted the camera to be centerd and GF in the exact center , now go look at the video and you can know that centered GF means your character covers so much of the screen when you look at him THE WAY THEY CODED IT TO BE . it was intended to center him but this game is 3rd person view , that way ask someone playing it to points the center of their *view* , they'll point higher than center because that's how it is , no one plays DBD and look stright ahead because that isn't naturally how it's played . now remember the devs want the game to understand when we look at GF , but like this person's video he clearly saw , spotted and looked for a while at him with no reveal happening , that means he shouldn't look like the devs wanted , because they wanted him to be reveled when a player sees him and center is just not it.
---
You sound fun at parties.
---
Im crushed man. Im sitting here crying into my phone. Tbh I dont actually know what gold even does.

You sound like a sweaty killer that been bullied by one too many swf squads.

---
what's the one on ormond? i havent played the map enough to see it
---
whats the difference on console
---
Could be Deathgarden related as well, don't forget.
---
I mean, considering the past few killers, it wasn't a stretch. Legion is Legion. Plague was above average. Ghostface however started horribly buggy and crap. With these changes, he might serve as effective.
---
That said, their initial design definitely was them being afraid of Ghostface being too oppressive. Global audio queue, loud ass wooshing, his power being broken? All of that combined is something else. Now it's much less skewed, and that's good. Hopefully he reaches a good tier location.
---
I honestly can not imagine him running around with a knife and getting hit in the face with a pallet
---
Trutalent put it really well, it's not OP, it's not a crutch, but you can do well without using a killers powers, or showing a good understanding of a killer, and he personally doesn't use it because he likes showing that he has skill with using a character. It's not OP because tons of killers can one hit down, it's not a crutch, because all perks are crutches, more so for survivors.
---
Stake Out. It's a counter to ruin, speeds up gens, and can be the clutch difference between finishing an action and being interrupted by an unexpected killer.
---
You really are brainless aren't you? Did you even watch the video? His head not in a centralised part of the screen for more than 1.5 seconds and therefore would not get spotted. Correct? Correct.
---
Like I said, it requires a little bit of brain power from survivors to press that ever so sweet crouch button so they have enough space to see him.
---
He did not do what was said in the patch notes for even CLOSE to 1.5 seconds, he is so incorrect and trying to stand up for something you are clearly very fucking wrong on is honestly hurtful to many people with brains.
---
Btw just so you know, it's 20% of him that needs to be visible in the centre of the screen, not all of him. While he is crouched it's still only the top of his head, which is very easy to do if you crouch as well.
---
I will retort: Survivors needing to do something to counter him?? The Shock! The Horror!
---
What you said in terms of coding is not incorrect, but it simply does not apply when he did nothing that you or I have said from the patch notes on how to reveal him. I like you're standing up for him, it's cute, but you really need to have the right points for a good counter argument, this is not one of those.
---
Territorial Imperative. "Fuck you too, random ~~citizen~~ survivor!"
---
Devour Hope. It almost never has any effect because totems are a flawed concept, but when it actually works it's incredible. 
---
Also, bloodwarden, I just wish it was active for a bit longer, given it's a situational 1-time activation perk.
---
Wow, what a jerk. We all understand you disagree, but do you have to be bitchy af? No. Just shows you how much you need to grow up and learn how to argue with someone properly.
---
It‚Äôs not not ‚Äúdoable.‚Äù If you‚Äôre an achievement hunter, don‚Äôt you feel better accomplishing a difficult trophy rather than having it handed to you for doing the bare minimum? As I mentioned before, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time playing killer, a lot of time at rank 1 playing a variety of killers, and I don‚Äôt have a problem getting merciless victories, and I‚Äôve gotten many of the adepts that I care about having. Are some of them more difficult to get than others? Absolutely! It‚Äôs supposed to be that way! The way they changed the trophy isn‚Äôt outlandish. The survivor adepts still forced the survivors to play as they would normally play, trying to complete objectives and stay alive, though many survivors are at a huge disadvantage because their perks don‚Äôt provide survivability (David and Ace). The new structure of the trophy is forcing killers to actually still play like they normally would, forcing them to complete their objectives optimally instead of merely having to do the minimum, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs bad. A lot of killers have this misconception that if they simply kill the survivors they won, when the bloodpoint award system is split into four categories for objectives, and killing is only part of one category. In a way, it‚Äôs kind of pushing people to be more aware of that, as opposed to people simply trying to one-hook everyone. Besides, there are some trophies that are incredibly more difficult than getting a merciless victory (coughcough Deranged Pursuit). All I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs more fun to actually try to adapt and ‚Äúbecome adept‚Äù with a killer by exercising your ability to play optimally with a limited set of perks, and that is more impressive than the previous structure of the trophy requirements. To each their own, I guess. You don‚Äôt have to agree with me, I‚Äôm just a killer-player expressing their opinion in response to your opinion. It‚Äôs unlikely at this point that they‚Äôll change it back.
---
id wanna see dbd in first person for survivors too. With overall balancing to account for that. First person for survivors would make it scary.
---
Maybe who knows?
---
I get that but like, he‚Äôs still unmasked for a portion of the film as an adult and still has darker hair. No matter what film you look at from the series, as an adult he‚Äôs got darker hair lol
---
Every time, survivors abused it in every way they could. Face camping is an issue that won't be solved easily. Nerf killer for staying too close to the hooked person? Survivors will gladly stick around until he gets the debuff, abusing whatever loops are nearby.
---
It's one hell of a problem with one hell of a solution required.

How does NOED on myers become a mind game? I ask because I never used it on Myers.

I‚Äôm not going to lie and I know I‚Äôm going to get downvoted for this but in my opinion it isn‚Äôt the survivors it‚Äôs the killers and survivors I‚Äôve seen both sides toxic and entitled as hell besides gameplay and good memes I‚Äôve only seen both sides take shots at each other I can almost say this community is as toxic as league of legends
---
I think that's a differwnt Blood Hunt if you catch my drift
---
Wait killers can close hatches?
---
Not enough data can you link some more examples
---
The witch from L4D
---
Sounds like the 1st scenario you tilted them pretty bad ( well their team mates from what you wrote)
---
Pretty much deserved if you recognized them the 2nd time ( and on ps4 we can see who the killer is in lobby) and if they remembered you..well you‚Äôre asking for it, if I got tilted of course I‚Äôm going to be a ‚Äòtry hard‚Äô the next couple games :,) 
---
Use your noggin
---
This is strange because I never actually witnessed much toxicity
---
The main reason I see many get annoyed by it is the fact that the Killer doesn‚Äôt have to do anything to be rewarded by it. 
---
The Killer has failed at stopping all the gens getting done and then is rewarded by the Survivors failing at cleansing all the totems. They didn‚Äôt actually have to do anything to earn it themselves, just fail at stopping gens and hope the survivors didn‚Äôt cleanse totems.
---
It also detracts away from Killers powers in the sense that you get one hit downs at the end of the game, which coupled with the speed boost from it you can basically bloodlust someone and you‚Äôll get them in the end, it takes no skill to catch someone with it.
---
Arguing when you're right and people not realising it is extremely fun because it just goes on and on. It's like when people ask dumb shit like "When it double bp weekend?" Or "Where are the pig cosmetics for mid chapter 3.0.0?" When you could use google and find it faster and stop wasting everyone's time, just like here with not knowing how to spot and calling it iffy.
---
not what i asked
---
Console players have to buy the huntress?
---
Consoles suck for twitchy movement needed for the nurse.
---
You can't nurse blink and 180 instantly to turn around and hit a survivor.
---
Why can‚Äôt we just round up all of you toxic people and just put you on an isolated island somewhere?
---
Yay we can watch teabagging survs on Netflix :)
---
No problem boblem
---
Oh god, Please. Yes
---
Welcome to the world of fighting games
---
Use WGLFn
---
I'm feeling a little woozy here!
---
Yes, but doing this, the remaining generators complete by itself.
---
It's not OP, but it literally rewards losing. I've seen so many killers play like complete ass the entire game and then NOED comes to save the day and give them free downs they never would have gotten otherwise. ANY perk that just gives you tons of power for zero effort is bullshit. End game perks in general reward killers for playing badly. Survivors however SHOULD get benefitted for making it to the end game, because that's their objective.
---
I see but as you said yourself the survivors failed at cleansing. So it is their fault not the killers.
---
link because I‚Äôm lazy
---
That‚Äôs far from low tier,
---
I got someone right at the exitgate before they left the exit I had no one escapes but still lol was great.
---
I actually think that's fine. If she makes the vacuum noise, survs have the ability to dodge.
---
Excuse me?
---
I don‚Äôt see any issues with survivors at this point and if you do change things they better fix endgame collapse
---
Iron will. It‚Äôs so easy to lose the killer when they come back to tunnel. They think I‚Äôm gone because they hear no survivors whining.
---
I never use it. Think it is boring but OP it is far from that I agree with Tru3.
---
It's alright if you slug a lot. Which you should if you're losing and there's other survivors nearby.
---
He literally says ‚ÄúThe Huntress is free‚Äù.
---
Funny thing is, I play better as killer but am more biased towards survivors
---
Are you this lare to the party or is there another one?
---
I'm not standing up for anyone lol it's just simple logic and you clearly didn't get it . also this happened to me even before the fix on PTB so i relate so much and it happend to me a lot that i tried to test it with randoms and they thought i was killing myself XD. i want this killer to be good because i play killer a lot and mostly Pig and Spirit so this killer brings stealth to a new level and I'm excited for it but bugs will make him not fun for survivors and you gotta think about the other side too
---
It‚Äôs a free download, but it‚Äôs not part of a patch you have to specifically download her chapter, but it‚Äôs free.
---
This is a funny strip but the title doesn't make much sense to me. Squidward is in the right in the original context.
---
Behavior is a company composed of several games, it is not only "dead by daylight"
---
Thank you, that fixed the problem.
---
Yea. Part of an update that released not that long ago where this thing called the Endgame Collapse starts. The only way to start the Endgame is to either open the gates as a survivor (or Killer if you want to end the game quickly but all 5 gens need to be done I think) or to close the hatch as killer. 
---
The Endgame Collapse will last for 3 minutes. After that, any survivors remaining on the map will be **SACRIFICED** to the good ol‚Äô Entity.
---
Besides Quentin, I main Tapp
---
IW is not low tier
---
Only thing they messed up on is the title. The strip itself is fine.
---
Huntress, Nurse and Plague disagree.
---
Yes starting today
---
No, I don't.
---
Yeah. 14-18th. Should start 2pm ET.
---
Yes
---
You're either thick as bricks or trolling but either way, god you're making yourself look stupid.
---
Leather faces look so high, I love it
---
Looks like the lovely sackboy from little big planet
---
Exhaustion perks in general I would say.
---
The idea at the time was that you earn what you get since we all knew what we were doing, plus on comms so we'd save eachother when we needed to with distractions across the map and such.
---
But you could send easily flip it around for newer players if you wanted to
---
If the hatch's opened with a key, it'll automatically close within like 20 seconds.
---
Reported for giving me anxiety.
---
Ah thanks for the info!
---
Oh ok thanks I thought it was starting at midnight üòä
---

---
"The Void"
---
I do think about the other side it's why I've been playing the PTB since it came out and now has been updated. I've not had an issue with revealing him and yes I have played both guys and girls because the camera problem is one I thought was an issue, but I haven't had it and saying it's iffy like it isn't in the video is feedback that is wrong and shouldn't waste dev time.
---
I play Pig too, I'm still not happy with the EGC changes with her although I know they were honestly kinda needed. In my heart I want the EGC to complete the gens to activate the traps but slow the game down by 20 seconds for every trap active rather than just you know, 30 seconds with someone downed or hooked baseline. Meaning 2 traps make the game last longer and if someone is down it's 30 + 20 seconds etc. I want him to be good but he's still not there yet.
---
They don‚Äôt though, they get locked and the gates power themselves. If the gens would complete then the killer would be able to open the doors
---
Isn‚Äôt it two minutes ?
---
It used to be if i remember correctly
---
Just break them 4HEad
---
its just these are some normal things in DBD removing/changing these would make the game a different one
---
so you can camp it harder... nice
---
Calm Spirit, because Fuck you Doctor.
---
Yes I agree, it is the Survivors fault as it‚Äôs their job to cleanse totems. However that is also the reason, presumably, many get annoyed by it. The Killer is rewarded for Survivor failings even though they didn‚Äôt actually have to do anything but equip the perk and lose control of the gens. 
---
As a solo player i‚Äôm fine with Noed being used, especially for an endgame type build (Noed, Blood Warden, Remember Me) because the Killer is playing the game with fewer perks until the end anyway but to be hit by it even though I was maybe tunnelled all game and had no chance to prevent it myself is a pain. 
---
I guess it comes down to as a Killer what you play the game for. I‚Äôd rather take perks that help myself during the game which in turn helps me get better, helps me learn a Killers power more and have the chance at getting more BP even if all 4 escape over taking Noed and hoping for a late game 4K by slugging.
---
That's kinda stupid.
---
1. Assymmetrical games are always unbalanced, that's in their nature. You can only make things better, but there can't be a moment when games with different abilities but the same roles can be called balanced (Dota, Wow, etc.). Let alone when player roles are completely different
---
2. Companies develop games for money, it's business. If they weren't making money out of it, they wouldn't update it. Yeah they could fight toxicity more, but yet they still do it. They banned Ochido for example, they are developing dedicated servers, etc.
---
3. Community isn't even THAT toxic anyways. I play on both PS4 and PC and get tbag maybe 1/3 games at most and some salty shit in no more than 1/5 games. Mostly it's just normal guys I'm playing with and against.
---
other hard to swallow pills : 
---
Camping and tunneling isn't a problem, you just can't accept defeat
---
He's half pug and half poodle so he's Pugish hense Pugsley, get It? Plus he's black and white like Pugsley from the Adams Family :) also the breeder I got him from owned the pugs from Men and Black and her dogs are on Saturday Night live all the time, so he's got some famous pug in him!
---
The fact that survivors need to be constantly worried about cleansing dull totems for a perk that may or may not be in use should show how strong it is. The perk is just shittly desgined all around.
---
Oh right, completely forgot about that haha
---
No, not the mini lock, how could you?
---
Love you too
---
 ‚ô•Ô∏è a Kate main
---
oh look we found the other brother of hanzo and genji
---
i also think that stalking a survivor should always benefit the player. for example you should get a slight speed boost for 3s after fully stalking an injured survivor
---
Killers liken Adrenaline to NOED and its not a fair comparison.
---
Imagine a survivor perk like Hope, but it triggers after you've been hooked twice. The vitriol from killers would be unbearable. WHY ARE YOU REWARDED FOR BEING BAD AND GETTING CAUGHT!?!?!
---
Personally I don't mind them getting the 4 man because sometimes the last guy is some guy who has been doing nothing all game. I don't like to see them get out
---
Chris Redfield as survivor
---
I know how it works. Its iffy in practice. Your eyes don't naturally rest on the head of your character. I'm not asking for a nerf, I'm asking for the detection zone to be moved higher for it to be more natural for players
---
Yup! Laurie and Tapp for me.
---
Every survivor either runs Adrenaline or Dead Hard, sometimes both at the same time.
---
God damn meg looks awesome
---
NOED is a counter to gen rushing, and survivors who try to do that end up on hooks by the end because they didn't do their secondary objective of cleansing totems. Absolutely no sympathy
---
Hypothetical situation, this didn‚Äôt actually happen. 
---
What triggered it was that I was playing as Legion on Ormond resort. I downed one survivor at the start and they disconnected. The next survivor I downed, they disconnected, ruining the game for everyone. It was clearly intentional. The following situation did not happen.
---
Wonderful now 3 ppl don't play the game because they are holding m1, one people doesn't because the fifth player likes to pretend to be afk.
---
That‚Äôs me! I love Stake Out.
---
In what world is GF a bad Killer? True he lacks map pressure, but you can use gen-defence perks to make up for that. He can chase without a red stain, making him really strong in chases, and is the most lethal Killer in the game. He's like a combination of Fragrant Tuft Myers and Jumpscare Myers!
---
If the Killer has half a brain, they'd be aware of their surroundings and wouldn't use the power near a hooked Survivor.
---
It's a mechanic that punishes survivors for rushing and not cleansing totems.
---
People say it's a crutch for bad killers but those same people run exhaustion perks, MoM etc... the reality is that it's not a crutch, it's a meta disruptor for survivors.
---
[heres the first ever screenshot i took.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/264966045871395034/E558803608B23B8A70504FBCE7E63CB84CD3C3B7/)
---
Trapper : \*heavy breathing\*

So while the killer camp it you can gen rush harder? Very nice for survivors too
---
oof

[This was my third.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/442858231144023139/C9D75FFF469AB8ECB95A86080B7912E7332A5D27/)
---
Tbh TWDG is kinda crazy in their own way. They can easily justify and then circlejerk any bad shit happening to a specific character they don't like.
---
Which I find kinda sad because for me TWD is a fiction that really shows how complex and different every person is, and the game shines in that aspect too.
---
The falling instaheal Lmao
---
its like always playing with a party streamer
---
Trapper too, set a trap at one gate and wait near the other, they have to reveal themselves, game over.
---
I love breakdown, especially the closer to endgame the trial gets. So many times either I or a survivor who got downed close to the exit has been able to wiggle free because of a hook I broke. Bonus points if they have boil over equiped.
---
It's one of the mod posts on the front page
---
I run Bitter and NOED on nurse because im a pathetic nurse and i always get told to kill myself and im tryhard, even though i get 2 kills tops lol.
---
To quote the greatest^* leader in American history: "vergina."
---
*not
---
Oh, that's one holy dog then xd Good pupper
---
I want to say Self Care, but the nerf hammer struck hard with that one.
---
Exhaustion perks? Maybe, but their strength and reliability puts tem more in line with BBQ.
---
Adrenaline? That's more of a NOED.
---
I'm gonna go with Prove Thyself.
---
They‚Äôre trolling.
---
Silent, you gonna anger the rank 15s.
---
u dont know ur tiers
---
Another tenacity lover here! Saved me many times especially when paired with unbreakable
---
As a Myers main:
---
It's not a mindgame. NOED on Myers is pointless, he can instadown with his tier3. Only exception: Scratched Mirror Myers who stays in Tier 1 and has Wallhacks. Surprise hits with NOED = amazing with that.
---
Plus M&amp;A+rabbit Myers has almost no Terror Radius. Combined with NOED a potent combo.
---
... It's really not a mindgame though. Xaoyu doedn't make much sense for me.
---
&gt;ANY perk that just gives you tons of power for zero effort is bullshit
---
Any perk that has no counter and no drawback, would be more fair to say, i think.  There aren't too many of those, but there are some on both sides, and they could use addressing.
---
Yes thats tunneling, all the shit the average player says is tunneling isnt tunneling, this is tunneling.
---
That'll do, Pig. That'll do ‚ù§
---
Honestly people who quit are just buttblasted they can't (as a killer) get a 4k gg ez or (as a survivor) just run meta perks and win.
---
Quitting gets you reported (remember to always report people who DC, as a killer or survivor) and earns you no points. There's literally no point doing it.
---
Someone already asked this, it‚Äôs supposedly a typo and it‚Äôs supposed to increase marked time
---
Its not always about the options though, avoiding body blocking isnt tunneling, but focusing down a player, deserting chases paired with proxy hooking, thats tunneling.
---
Same actually :)
---
Which makes me a killer who spares life whenever i can. If it feels right. Hatch for last guaranteed etc.
---
If this skin is added in the game I will main Wraith
---
Resilience, such an overlooked perk because of the self-care meta, but this thing is amazing if you don‚Äôt like wasting time on healing.
---
Well, I guess death really isn‚Äôt an escape.
---
Yeah but what is their biggest hit? Because it's a safe bet that it has to do something with it.
---
Thats a completely ridiculous profile to fabricate.
---
An afk killer? Nice.
---
[Here's my first screenshot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723916059)
---
Now kiss
---
I just think they're neat!
---
Wait, threaten his life again - we still need swimming trunk Quentin, then we're done
---
No, they wont, because most killers that post here understand the standard.
---
Same, if rather try to use perks that compliment may killer, or that help me before end game. If I made an end game build I'd use It, but I prefer Devour Hope much more if I'm looking for a perk to help me clutch the end game
---
This.
---
It feels incredibly cheap to die to NOED, especially as a solo Survivor. People say "just cleanse the totems", as if there isn't a Killer running about. You don't know if your teammates have been doing totems and you can't really stop them rushing gens.
---
Hell, you could loop a Killer all match and still die because you got hit ONCE.
---
If there was a totem counter and/or the perk was revealed to Survivors when the last gen is repaired/hatch is closed, it'd be fine.
---
There are infinites mate...
---
It seems like I‚Äôm either very lucky or very unlucky. On the example I gave here, it was my fault for staying on a gen too long. Then I got unhooked twice in unsafe conditions. That happens a lot unless I spot the killer soon enough on that first gen. Other times I usually have higher bp totals than everyone but the killer, and sometimes never even see the killer! I do usually play with caution - like I only unhook if I know the killer isn‚Äôt camping nearby.
---
Also, agree about remembering who did well. I like to give thumbs up to people who played well or helped me, but if I‚Äôm in a pack with three Jakes or Claudette‚Äôs, it‚Äôs tricky.
---
Same... he seems veru string and fun
---
We should just call Ghostface a paragraph
---
A lot are very new and naive too
---
Because you have to stop looking at her to escape :(
---
Even if you go for the injured survivor after a hook rescue, given they're both equally hard to catch that's not tunneling, that's smart. It's the healthy survivor that fucked up by letting them get off the hook too early.
---
And clown
---
Sure no problem, it is not a Dwight so it is cool
---
I crawled across map into the hatch with 1% left becasue of this perk.
---
It was three in the initial PTB but they lowered it to 2 minutes because it was too long of a window.
---
They will never understand. NOED is like Ruin, it either slows down the game by them doing totems, or it provides major benefit endgame for the killer. I think it has nothing to do with ‚Äúlosing‚Äù and everything to do with slowing the game.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the info lad

No it's bad play. Legit strats should be in the realm of optimal play. Optimal play would be to tunnel the injured survivor if you're close anyway. Optimal play is not ignoring the healthy one that's bodyblocking you. He should've swung at him and then pick who to chase based on who was closest.
---
And it was 20 minutes long
---
Aw that's hot, that's hot!
---
Surv: Alert, I only soloQ and it gives tons of info.
---
Killer: For some reason Ive always liked Rancor. Surprise Mori outta nowhere!
---
Yeah but totem spawns are like:
---
In prenn, literally spawning at the midle of an open area.
---
In lery, they spawn in the most fucking annoying place where you would Never fucking look around, because you didn't even know that it was actually a place where you character could walk.
---
This inconsitency makes every match being torn to random odds, because a funcional noed is insta-win we all know that.
---
Don't get me wrong I don't want totems always spawning in open areas, normally the spawns are good, but getting to find them all when you are not a 4 man team is fucking hard as hell, and really depends on the map.
---
It‚Äôs a good thing you hit that otherwise this clip would be a lot more embarrassing

Oh shit dude u ok?

Dead by datlight doesnt need to have fake rules

Change my mind.

No really now, u can run wharever u want and dont let the community ruin ur experience

As funny as the concept is, that image of the battery is just painful to look at. I am offended
---
She is not that thick after all
---
Such positivity
---
I'm pretty sure it is, you just gotta report them so they get their just deserts. A similar thing happened with a Nea who got ontop of a totem. I used a bone splinter b/c I was considering buying LF, and I was pissed. But she fucked up and I downed her and she couldn't get down. So she just bled out while I nodded at her.
---
I play survivor more but I‚Äôm more biased towards killers
---
JufF is not cool??! I dead u
---
Great! No worries.
---
If anything, current MoM is the closest Survivors have to NOED
---
I think it just depends from person to person.
---
I feel like killer is less stressful for me too since you don‚Äôt have to rely on classmates
---
I know it‚Äôs a joke and all...  I‚Äôm a survivor main, but...  I really don‚Äôt THINK I act like this?  I say gg in the chat even if I got camped, I tell the killer they did well if only a few escaped, or I give the guy whose playing M&amp;A Doctor to take off that perk and explain WHY he should take it off.  Is this a rank 1 thing, or something?
---
...wha...
---
So...he lost you...and you were fully able to open the gate...against a nurse.
---
Fukken gg that guy is a trashfire both in skill and attitude.
---
Thrill increases points you get in game. It makes it easier to get to the 8k cap, but doesn‚Äôt increase the max amount you can get. Only BBQ and WGLF can go over the limit
---
Autodidact, games barely ever last long enough for it to be useful but sometimes you get those back to back skill checks and it feels so good when you're almost insta healing people at 5 stacks.
---
Yeah I agree with this.
---
I hate the mentality that just one side is toxic, this goes for killer and survivors.
---
Both sides are toxic, that is a fact.
---
Also this community is still better than the cod one, trust me
---
I love grabbing people off vaults as spirit, the choking animation is hilarious for some reason
---
For spirit it is
---
I play solo a lot and I really love Empathy honestly.  Not only can you easily find anyone who is injured to maybe help them out, but you can almost always tell where the killer is just by seeing your injured team mates aura running around.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt use NOED on nurse though. Just keep practicing without it. When you‚Äôre not good at nurse focus on whether or not you met or improved on your blinking and how many hooks you got. NOED is kind‚Äôve a crutch perk on nurse
---
No it's not it's for killers that failed their objective.
---
He's not bad but he's too add on reliant. You pretty much always have to run windstorm and swift hunt
---
really remembers me [this](https://i.redd.it/fh8dnjv1l6u21.jpg)
---
Gonorrhea, colloquially known as¬†the clap, is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Infection may involve the genitals, mouth, and/or rectum.
---
And the killer has noed
---
AND YOU'RE RANCOR
---
I'd love a Dota 2 crossover since there's a hero called Nightstalker.
---
Every killer has NOED until proven otherwise.
---
Open-Handed and PWYF
---
Feels bad though when you cleanse all totems only to find out that the killer does not even have it :(
---
Meanwhile in reality as a solo player: Run around whole map getting totems. Get 4 and never be too sure if your teammate got the 5th one. 
---
Find out that you waters so much time cleansing totems and running around the map that the nurse has already hooked multiple survivors whilst 1 gen has been completed.
---
Die. Next game. Repeat.
---
You have a point there.
---
If you don‚Äôt like being tunneled (it sucks) try d-strike
---
As someone else has said before, NOED is a work around for actually trying to learn a killer.  You don‚Äôt have to know how to mind game with spirit or body block with wraith etc. if you can just instadown people when gens are finished.  It‚Äôs not a guaranteed 4K obviously but it‚Äôs still very rewarding co spidering that it requires you to play poorly in a match to get such a large reward.
---
Just checked Xbox and no 2x bloodpoints yet, so indeed coming in a few hours, as described. Try in 6 hours.
---
Well then again dead by daylight is better than cod I play trapper and David nothing makes me happier than either looping a trapper to bloodlust or getting someone in a trap across the map in the middle of a chase or herding them to traps
---
it was a top post on this sub a few days back but i cannot find it:/// it basically looks like bm, the first milliseconds of the mori starts and then it stops again
---
I think we all need this one. Looks really good!
---
lol yes because different survs had different powers...
---
Or if your team cleansed them too
---
What happened to MOM? You got hit and then shouldn't your aura show up when the Nurse isn't close? If that's right then how didn't they spot you?
---
Eh I play Killer mainly. Just looking to have a bit of fun when I play survivor. I don't rate myself at all as a survivor. I just thought this was worth sharing since, for me it's very rarely I see a killer completely misjudge their attack and fall through the whole in the middle.
---
It could be anything, and honestly a dbd series sounds the least likely. Chances are i'd be more hyped for characters from netflix shows making an appearance in DBD; I'd love a stranger things survivor or demogorgan killer.
---
There's also the chance BHVR will just be working on mobile games for the company, or (although less likely) making a full size game. we'll see.
---
What did he say?
---
If they include Local on Switch but not on PS4 Im honna be pissed
---
NOED is fine in games where the Killer played well.
---
Situation: Killer got 5 or 6 hooks in, put pressure on the map, and now needs a little boost to secure some end game kills. Totally fair. 
---
However, the survivors can cleanse it right away by RNG and the Killer is simply doomed to watching survivors dance out the gate. 
---
NOED is not fine in games where the Killer played poorly. 
---
Situation: NOED Killer secures and facecamps an easy kill next to the NOED totem after being looped by putting very little pressure on the map. 
---
Solution: The problem with NOED isn't that it is too strong. It is that it is not earned. 
---
Let's scrap this idea of "Totem NOED" all together and make it a token system instead based on how the Killer performed. Rough example: 2 hooks = 1 token. 1 token buffs movement speed. 2 tokens exposes survivors for x amount of time or # of hits [and so on--this is a super rough idea]. 
---
But seriously. You can't punish Killers an entire perk slot for like 90 seconds of completing Totems. And you can't punish survivors for completing their objective. Instead, REWARD the Killer for playing well by giving them a massive end game buff with counterplay throughout the trial for survivors and passive incentive to the Killer to keep hooking and hunting instead of camping. 
---
All this said. I don't give a single fuck about NOED killing me. It is a game and while I care about the overall health of it--I can 100% tolerate losing in a video game.
---
I don't really understand why killers do this, closing the hatch after they dropped you there. I mean... I don't really care how small your peen is. Like, not at all. Same for Survivors who think they're great shit by doing something similar. 0o
---
At least she got her ass kicked for that, great job! :D
---
An experienced Hag will mop the floor with you. I 4k most games at high ranks. Its just that most people dont play her and most people who do dont know what theyre doing. Shes top 5 easy.
---
Only after you fully heal.
---
Lol, wow you're actually dumb as fuck. Rofl
---
~~You shouldn‚Äôt use NOED on nurse though~~ You can use whatever you want but NOED will not make you any better.
---
When I play solo I just habitually survey the area before I do a gen and even when traveling to another location still at least basic sweep the area before getting on another gen. 
---
The meme is partially correct, which is why I can see it‚Äôs really striking a nerve with some people. Solo players only want to do gens and leave so NOED preys on their laziness cause y‚Äôall have some lone wolf mentality and wonder why y‚Äôall get 3-4k‚Äôd. 
---
And you damn sure can‚Äôt expect people to try to bring maps, or detective‚Äôs hunch, small game or even ask them to survey the area cause they gotta stick to their ‚ÄúAdren, MoM, DH, DS/BL‚Äù meta build and do their M1 simulator. 
---
It‚Äôs interesting and ironic that the survivors who control the pacing of the game cannot seem to delegate the time to prevent one perk that almost ensures their safety. Maybe it‚Äôs those people who are bad at time management.
---
That‚Äôs what I meant
---
I think left behind should speed up gate opening time if you are the last survivor.
---
Alright, Meg(I'm assuming it was a meg) is at Hag tier
---
Oof, you'll get there one day
---
&gt;An experienced Hag will mop the floor with you. I 4k most games at high ranks. Its just that most people dont play her and most people who do dont know what theyre doing. Shes top 5 easy.
---
I won't doubt and I don't disagree she is top 5 if played correctly, which isn't something you see too often, thats all. 
---
The average Hag just trap at pallets mid loop and traps around hooked survivors.
---
I like that except it would be a worse wake up because wake up allows you to see the aura of the gate along with a speed increase
---
I love this cosmetic most out if all of them. Thoughts on an animation of the snake digesting something it has already caught?
---
Wake Up already does that
---
I don't see how but whatever
---
What the hell dude
---
Good point, it's pretty nice when you do have good teammates though
---
Who was the surv, I need to know(The character btw)
---
I do
---
Wazzzzzzzupppppp!!!!
---
Claudette seems like she has seen some really fucked up shit.
---
Dread it. Run from it. The Wraith arrives all the same
---
Also it was rank reset yesterday. It's not that uncommon for experienced players to get into lower ranks if they haven't played in a couple of months. Trust me after rank reset my first 10 or so games are always total miss matches.
---
Me: loops killer without teabagging
---
Killer: facecamps me
---
Me: teabags next time I loop him
---
Killer: survivors are toxic 
---
Based on multiple true story's
---
You must be completely rehabilitated thanks to bear traps. You‚Äôre welcome.
---
Thats cheats dude, ive been playing since release, thats cheats.
---
Bodyblocking (depending case by case) is reportable with video proof if the survivor prevented you from escaping, 
---
iE a random Nea blodyblocked me in jungle gym gen preventing me from leaving the corner until clown came over from afk crows and downed me and you bet your ass she got a temp ban :,)
---
I think you dropped this /s
---
Its 4 perks vs 16.
---
Oh yeah good call I forgot about that movie
---
This is a bug almost impossible to cheat on console like this
---
Good point.... ugh, so frustrating.
---
JUST DONT TUNNEL 4HEAD
---
Ah fair enough, thanks for letting me know. I guess matchmaking is somewhat all over the place now since everything is around the rank 20 quote? That's why there's so many prestiged people.
---
Thank you for letting me know. &lt;3
---
Lmao
---
I'm glad i've never seen it happen again. I don't know for you guys on pc but for me on ps4 that was the one and only time this happen.
---
If the only way to get stacks is by protection hits and it goes to the live servers, MoM is going to be shit. I would say I feel bad and it got nerfed hard but honestly mettle of man can literally go fuck itself

I'm talking about the non toxic ones (has happened to me before)
---
It doesn‚Äôt make you better at nurse
---
I had the most satisfactory run as Legion yesterday.
---
4 SWF, three flashlights and a toolbox. Tried to genrush and loop me about, no problem, Franklin's was there for a reason. Mad Grit helped with the failed saves (seriously, they were awful at it, didn't hit a single one) and BBQ proved that all but one were stalking my ass, waiting to farm their teammate. They were the most toxic, BM, teabag-whenever-I-get-the-chance kind of player. Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, Selfcare and a mix of balanced landing, lithe and sprint burst. They did nothing but loop.
---
They were smart enough to get eachother hooked twice, but not a single kill on my end. Until, that is, 1 gen was left. Claudette went on the hook and meg went down after a failed attempt, and thanks to mad grit I was able to carry Claudette into the basement, and so went Meg. 
---
Last generator was 99'd, and someone went down there to rescue them. Big mistake, because the moment I saw the scratch marks going down the basement, their gen jock finished the generator just besides the basement, tried to come down, and learned that NOED popped. All four went down to a M1 Legion, and proceeded to call me a "Lagswitching toxic cunt who just camps and doesn't know how to chase" for a solid five minutes in the endgame screen. That was fun.
---
On pc we had about a quarter year of just hackings rampant, then it stopped.
---
Grey area because technically they can still bleed out, I would submit a CS ticket anyway just to see the response and don‚Äôt forget to tag proof :) video is better
---
It gave me so many nightmares as a kid..
---
in it's current state i don't like it but they need to find the right thing that triggers stacks. protection hits only is garbage. I think the perk is fine as long as you have to work for it
---
Hey, the creator here. Just so this isn't turning into a discussion-
---
There is a watermark but it's only visible if you really look for it bc that's not the point of a meme. But I guess if people want to find my name, it's there in her veil for them to see.
---
I actually did tell people to go wild with it in the original thread, bc for me personally. that's what memes are for. I'm happy it's being reused.
---
Still, in general, I'd find it much better if people did credit creators even only of memes. Bc if you don't do that, chances are people also get used to not crediting actual artwork, and that's a dick move.
---
Anyway, I'm glad someone made it relatable for Huntress players. &lt;3
---
How is prove thyself in line with ruin? üòÇ though I agree with adrenaline, both are annoying to play against.
---
I‚Äôd say at least 50% of survivors that I‚Äôve seen use it. I always run it. It‚Äôs a high-tier perk for sure.
---
&gt; face camps without repercussion!
---
any team that loses to a killer who facecamps is a team that deserved to lose.
---
Supplies mothafucka!
---
It gets me more time in chase, for me personally.
---
Devil May Care legion
---
Lagswitch... u can buy it on eBay
---
Cute but kinda looks like the bear hang himself.
---
Honestly I think one way to get survivors to cleanse totems is just to buff Small Game, make your aura visible to others when you're cleansing a totem, gain more points for cleansing &amp; disarming, maybe a small speed increase to disarming and cleansing.
---
you guys sound like you're about to disappoint your Japanese father.
---
I‚Äôm all for a Werewolf killer, but I don‚Äôt think turning survivors against each other is a good idea.
---
[here's my first screen](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/219941464655067334/7C6AB7EC556477F0FD03809CA5A1505A3524C93A/) Not sure what caused this but my whole game looked like this and I couldn't move as the killer at all.
---
I‚Äôd actually be all for this.
---

You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/JhuluqOih

This image needs more use.
---
True
---
I think kindred is really underrated 
---
It prevents 3 survivors from going for the save, and it counters insidious and wraith.
---
Seeing that pink bubba aura is just public shaming
---
So if I understand correctlly he has multiple stacks of it
---
My problem is the diference in dificulty between survivor and killer adept. Also, if I get a 4k, with only 4 gens left, but then don't get the achievment because I am in red ranks and needed 1 more emblem there than I would need in lower ranks, I feel robbed.
---
Yeah isn't the Overkill walking dead game on life support since Overkill got raided for impropriety? I'd imagine that community **has** to get along together because they're dying.
---
That's pretty good! :)
---
I agree tbh I wouldn't mind if you had to work for it but I'd much prefer if they completely reworked it because it's design in general is horrible

Yeah sadly you can't choose who to face first. Typical scenario, you go for Dying Light or Remember Me and don't see the obsession for the whole match. You go for STBFL and the obsession is the only one being spotted.
---
And then you're like "damn, if I could've chosen who'd survive, it definetly wouldn't have been that dick".
---
As killer I've definitely *thought* I heard survivor footsteps through grass, only to find a fire barrel instead.
---
Because playing survivor as a solo player is fucking garbage. I'll do it for the dailies, but I'd much rather have the relaxation of killer.
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
What time does the blood hunt begin anyway?
---
haaaas to be meg

lmao you gotta give him that love-at-first-sight type of look

you all remember [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=721184991) ? or the good old [4+ Survivor matches](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=764182866) ? and getting [stuck behind chests](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=767512278) ? happy memories :')
---
No Jill redfield?
---
Honestly, I couldn't think of anything else that I always see.
---
Ruin isn't that strong, as decent Survivors can hit greats reliably and it usually gets cleansed within a minute.
---
Urban evasion is my favorite perk, can't play without it. Gets you out of so much shit. This guy is just a dick.
---
Totems weren't made a secondary objective on purpose it's just another means of having a strong perk mechanic. NOED is the thing that forces it to be a second objective.
---
He really likes attention on him
---
Except Doc and Clown are two of the least played killers
---
Top comment should be self-care
---
They also drop pallets right as they see them instead of looping, and even drop them mid-chase.
---
Even if survivors hit the hex skill checks, they ain't hitting greats, so the gens are still slowed. And to be fair I do see prove thyself quite often but not compared to dead hard, decisive, or adrenaline.
---
Nah doin gens, you?
---
I don‚Äôt disagree that survivor adepts should be changed, I just disagree with the sentiment that killer adepts are impossible to get because they aren‚Äôt. I think in theory, they should be around an equal difficulty, but that isn‚Äôt always reality, since the survivors can get the hatch and still get the adept (however, this is a whole different can of worms with endgame collapse). If killer adept is going to be linked to pips, survivor adept should be as well. Also, just wait till rank resets to try to get adept then? You‚Äôll still be playing against people at your ‚Äúskill level,‚Äù but the requirements for pips will be different. There are definitely ways around it if you‚Äôre having a hard time. 
---
At any rate, this is BHVR we are talking about, and the devs can barely play the game they made and definitely don‚Äôt play to the extent many of the player base plays, so they have no actual reason to care. If they wanted to change survivor adept, they would have done it when they did killer adepts, but they didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a problem that starts with the devs, so bringing it to their attention would probably be the best course of action.
---
Damn, every wraith cosmetic looks like it belongs in dark souls and I love it.
---
2pm EDT.
---
so in about 5 hours.
---
she seems a bit fast
---
It depends on what the survivor did to the killer.
---
This. Hahaha
---
Fucking rip
---
All of you are so scared of getting downed by NOED just run No Mither Lmao!
---
r/Dexter
---
for years killers complain that surv, waste their time at the gate...and now they do the same.
---
get a idea where the last surv is, find the hatch close it right away and finish it. why people enjoy frustrating other people so much. espcially with loo at me i'm waisting your time...with my time

I appreciate your appreciation of all my Ash memes, you groovy son of a bitch you &lt;3
---
I go around with Leatherface doing speed limiter chainsaw only and trying to get 4 stacks of barbecue. Godspeed.
---
Did you make this?
---
It only actually helped in two situations; One where Meg tried to flashlight save Claudette, and ended up actually giving me just enough time to carry her that extra distance into the basement (while also knocking her flashlight out of her hands and wasting her time by forcing her to go heal) and when the basement group tried to bodyblock me - despite NOED having been up.
---
Not only were there 2 people in the second stage hooked into the basement, but the gates were already open. If Claudette¬≤ hadn't decided to be altruistic with her magical ultra rare flaslight that she couldn't use, I would've gotten a 2k if I was lucky. But no, the one person I hadn't chased all game just wanted to be there to help.
---
Saying new DS wasn't bad? BAH! Try saying that you don't think ruin is useful in anyway
---
I dont think I've ever met a "nice" Nurse. Only the slugging tryhard who absolutely NEEDS a 4k.
---
I would give rewards if I had the coins
---
Adrenaline is an award for making it to end game finishing your objective. Noed rewards bad game pLay... stop comparing the 2 they're different.
---
Oh man, haven‚Äôt heard the term ‚Äúlagswitch‚Äù since the old school Halo days. Good times.
---
Yeah. This whole tbagging thing is just lost on me
---
Why would the Perk be lit?
---
Would the bug then not be that the hex perk is lighting when it is in fact not active?
---
How dare you lying directly into my face, that's a png and not a jpg, step up your game m8 :^]
---
Oof toxic survivors got angry at me
---
Yeah I get that but what's the point in unhooking if it's almost impossible to do it.
---
Trying to land dash attacks is a nightmare. They're absurdly easy to avoid thanks to "JUST TO LET EVERYONE KNOW, PIGGY IS HERE AND ABOUT TO DASH ATTACK YOU SO JUST HIT SPRINT TO EVADE IT" siren she makes.
---
because you'd run inside other survivors making killer's attack hit "someone around here" instead of a specific person
---
It wasn't even activated
---
Agreed! Everyone is just trying to make a bunch of points and have fun while doing it.
---
Michael camped me and used it to farm evil within  
---
Then would just instantly down any survivors who come close. He won that game
---
Killer Uses Shock
---
Survivor is paralyzed 
---
Killer uses slam on hatch
---
Survivor has given up
---
"how easily rewarding it is" yeah, it's not like survivors need to do the objective or something
---
So the Claudette with Urban Evasion and Self Care who ignored two people on hooks deserves a reward?
---
I play friendly Wraith only during blood hunts. Global bell addon + the addon where he had a terror radius while cloaked. üëèüèª
---
You can get out when it's not activated? Had no idea.
---
It‚Äôs actually really fun! I have like 100+ hours in it and the characters have their own ability and downsides. But the game is really fun and is definitely worth it
---
I notice that more on PC when I watch streamers people are constantly dcing... PC is full of pussys...  lmao.. I mean it happens on ps4 but not nearly as much.
---
Remember when the lighting was good?
---
Also, Adrenaline is guaranteed while NOED has easily removable Hexes
---
Myers can't stalk and body block at the same time because when you stalk, you lose collision
---
Can't help but hear Jane's moaning after being hit in my head. That's seriously wicked
---
Exactly!
---
Gg, close one! No need to point out the trap was inactive because you already know now
---
......I was just trying to help. I've only ever heard of "Ghost banning" which means not giving any info to a player of them being moved onto a server with other toxic/cheater players. And saying "You're welcome" isn't a mean thing, now is it? It's up to the reader to interpret the meaning.
---
Some fries mdfka
---
Friday the 13th? Haven't heard that name in years... *puffs cigarette*
---
well, it did in the games I played
---
Problem with NOED is that there is absolutely no reason to cleanse totems other than the possibility of NOED; if the killer doesn't have NOED you just wasted a lot of time doing jack shit. 
---
Here's a fun suggestion , imagine if Hex totems weren't distinguishable from dulls:
---
1. this buffs hex perks that aren't normally good.
---
2. this indirectly nerfs NOED because people have more incentive to go cleanse totems.
---
3. it slows down the game a bit, which helps killers.
---
This could especially buff Devour, because *if* survivors don't bother cleansing they can end up with a Devour killer roaming around and no idea what to cleanse; 
---
of course bringing Ruin would be a surefire way to get survivors to cleanse your totems, but you could choose not to bring ruin so that survivors are more likely to leave totems standing if you are running either Devour or NOED
---
It would also make Haunted Grounds stronger.
---
Yeah, this. It's like people think there's always an instant notification to everyone when a killer is facecamping. Unless you're in a 4 man SWF, you're not always gonna know, and that can make facecamping actually successful. Shitty, but successful.
---
Same, give Pig some love.
---
Cigarettes are bad for your health young gentleman!
---
Ah, my apologies. I shall be punished for this grave mistake-
---
So, where is the crapper?
---
Do you know of anything else that‚Äôs been changed in the PTB that isn‚Äôt in the main game?
---
After 2000 hours and getting rank 1 killer for almost 3 straight years I'd imagine I'm using him correctly.
---
Clown is bad. The only thing his ability does is make survivors drop a pallet one loop earlier than they normally would. Every map has 15-20 pallets, and you're still going to get looped for 5 minutes.
---
If games end in 3-4 minutes, and you get looped for 5 minutes... do you see where I'm going with this? On top of that, he has non-existant map pressure because has no ability to travel.
---
The only "fairly good" killers are nurse, billy, spirit, and huntress.
---
I enjoy the gameplay of killer way more than survivor
---
I had a game against a wraith who stood not 5 feet away from every hook and got three kills and could have gotten me as the fourth too. But he let me open the gate and leave. Normally I'd thank a killer for that, but I'd have just encouraged his textbook camping and tunneling.
---
Ah yes indeed. I will now immediately quit smoking and all other bad habits, thank you kind sir!
---
I only teabag if they were camping.
---
My work here is done. *fades into nothingness*
---
Nurse nerf
---
players need to stop bitching about SWF because this game it's not only about them, most of survivors only play solo like i do, if you don't like and feel confident enough going against them, then dodge but don't proritize SWF and ask for nerfs only to punish the solo survivors 'cause a SWF will be strong with and without "crutch" perks
---
If you have to go across the map yes it does
---
I remmeber reading aabout netflix doing something with videogames.
---
Probably they'll be streaming stuff.
---
you can avoid that by putting enough pressure on them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Love doing this, but it always reminds me of how limited the killer perspective really is. If you can't see something clearly, you can't see it at all. I walked by a Claudette in the tall grass at least three times in one match.
---
So the guy who got chased the whole game doesn't deserve Adrenaline, when he's in fact the one who needs it most?
---
He can still get a lot of juice from you, as if he is blocking you there's usually not anywhere nearby to break LoS
---
Ok, but even if we ignore SWF, Adrenaline would be unbalanced without NOED. They're counters of each other, and if one gets lowered than the other one does to as to keep the end game balanced.
---
Exactly haha. It's guessing but it's also mind games. The more mind games you've had with that killer during the match, the more info you have to make a read on your opponent
---
Noed imo is fine against swf, not fine against randoms. You don't know if your teammates are doing gens, cleansing totems or going for saves. Solo queue is completely unpredictable and you don't have any info on the others. You could barely fix the gens only to die to noed
---
For real.  There‚Äôs no reason to have fifty different kimonos and a schoolgirl outfit for the only Asian inspired killer.  Jfc.
---
The killer *won* the game with 3 perks. Very different from getting stomped as a survivor and not even getting to use your fourth perk, Adrenaline. You must know that this is a false equivalence, don't be intellectually dishonest.
---
So the M1 killer who can't cover every generator on the map doesn't deserve a single chance when end game collapse hits?
---
You clearly aren't in the higher ranks. You find NOED almost every single game from 9-1.
---
Yeah, the killer has to be doing some major BMing of their own in order for me to tbag. Otherwise I don't bother
---
Its also a good tactic if someone is still out there
---
Agreed just enjoy the game
---
No mither&gt; noed, myc and hg
---
You wait till the hit and then go in for the Rescue. Hope your teamate has desicive strike and that you have that perk where you have 100% chance of escaping a hook after you unhook someone. Killers destroyed.
---
I don't play as much as I used to anymore but I'm 300hrs in and usually was rank 1 within a week after reset. While you see it alot, it almost certainly is not a 90% rate. Sure, sometimes it may feel like that, but overall it really isnt.
---
I have had all 3 do this i then went to killer and got him to kill me in basement lol
---
PLZ NERF
---
I have submitted this for the contest. It's pretty clear it will not win but still was fun to create this :)
---
They really do, it's kind of terrible
---
It used to not work for generator repairs, not sure if that‚Äôs still the case
---
yeah
---
More incentives to play a variety of killers.
---
I‚Äôm really hoping the killer leaderboards/rank change is going to weigh the killers differently or have their own unique ranks.
---
I love the tentacle skirt :)
---
It's so true
---
Love it
---
Fun fact: BPS doesn‚Äôt stack with the Bloodhunt.
---
Say you get 20k in a game
---
With BPS, it‚Äôs 40k
---
With bloodhunt it‚Äôs 40k
---
With both, it‚Äôs 60k
---
I mean, she's cheating obviously. If you still have her name then report her, that's just poor sportsmanship.
---
Another killer whining, what‚Äôs new, also slightly delusional if you think killers have perks that do nothing. Killers have such overpowered aura reading perks it‚Äôs not even funny. Thank goodness there is swf, survivors need some way to counteract overpowered killers and toxic survivors not to mention that some killers play with one of their friends as survivors and get their Nate to lead them to other survivors. Killers won‚Äôt be happy unless survivors have no perks at all.
---
Perfect!

I...

No.

Not gonna bother.

You're right ! Everything is fine !

Oh my god I'm so sorry
---
Oh no anything but the [REDACTED]
---
I prefer the booty grabs.
---
&gt; It prevents 3 survivors from going for the save
---
I wish... I used to run it for this reason but noticed people have the situational awareness of a spoon and i'd still have the whole team sitting in bushes near me while i was getting facecamped, low &amp; high ranks alike.
---
I really don't understand how people have an issue with adrenaline. 
---
Its 1 health state with a speed boost once per game if you even make it that far. At least half the time a survivor will get zero use out of it beings that they died before the gens were done or their team all died before the gens were done.
---
Even in most games where you make it to the end if you're not injured, being chased, or already on a hook then all it does is get you to the door a little faster.
---
The pay off for getting almost no use out of it most of the time is that when you really need it it can be REALLY clutch. Adrenaline needs to keep that clutch factor or else it would be far too low of a payoff for how often you get to activate it. 
---
At that point it would be thrown into the very crowded bin of useless survivor perks and you would probably move on to complaining about borrowed time or balanced landing.
---
The collector and Arkin DLC, Pigs EGC nerf tweaked and crouch speed increased , hit boxes fixed,  and DC‚Äôs fixed with dedicated servers
---
i know but i use it with STBFL, BBQ and Rancor as a build for my Spirit, it's fun tho, end chases pretty quickly and punish hard the obsession at the end
---
I remember that. Tibia, wasn't it?
---
I get tbagged all the time and i don't  even camp, we killers have emotions you know...
---
Literally the first time I‚Äôve seen anyone open the gate as last survivor in EGC.
---
I‚Äôm surprise they never fixed gate spawns to make it more realistic for a survivor to open them,

Can‚Äôt wait to play the game at 20fps because someone dragged me out of my house
---
Object of Obsession would like a word with you :P
---
Combined with Iron Will, fuck Nurse as well :)
---
I‚Äôll be using Doc quite a bit as I have 29 BPS on him. I‚Äôll be playing the game properly so long as no one asks to farm, however i‚Äôll only be 2 hooking everyone and then if I come across someone who‚Äôs dead on hook i‚Äôll slug them and leave and let them all escape in the end. The last BP event was Hell for survivors, every other match the Killer had moris and ultra-rare add-ons.
---
My internet is great and doesn't lag at all (in other games), it turns out it was just a issue with my Ethernet cable.  Must have been loose or something.
---
But I thought DBD was on dedicated servers now making that irrelevant anyways?
---
Well, you ARE trying to murder them in a brutal ways.
---
I don't think it's a fair comparison since you have to actually do something to get adrenaline (the objective). Id say it's more similar to MoM, although MoM is wayyy worse than noed since at least noed has some counterplay
---
&gt; I always run it. It‚Äôs a high-tier perk for sure.
---
I'd like to hear your reasoning on this. IMO the perk is garbage.
---
\*Teleports behind you\* Nothing personell kid

I'm not that confident :(

Cosmetics for Laurie and Michael
---
I just want love and a hug, but they are always running and hidding from me, they then hit me with those pallets so i have to defend myself you know
---
I think once dedicated servers come out I'll play killer more
---
right now, my wifi signal is bad so I feel guilty for the survivors
---
Worse are the ones that run to a pallet then wait for the killer to catch up then drop it... you realize that's what we want, right?

Do tell me more.

Good to hear that you've fixed the issue! :)
---
DBD is currently P2P. Peer to peer hosting. Aka one person is hosting the server on his connection. (Killer is always the host). Huge design flaw, that they've admitted to.
---
In 3 months i think BHVR said, we will get dedicated servers finally.
---
exactly. not imagine that being a normal thing
---
This is great
---
Left Behind should allow you to see the aura of the hatch from a certain distance if you're the last one alive AND be able to open it, but not like you usually would- make it the same opening time as a gate or something maybe, like you have to "pry" the hatch open.
---
It would be a decent perk because it would give the killer three things to potentially guard in EGC. It would also be useful for the person running it if the killer HASN'T closed the hatch yet. Finally, it wouldn't be overpowered because it would be extremely situational any way. In the cases where the killer has closed the hatch you'd still have to spend the time opening it or a gate so it wouldn't matter too much. It would still be a very specific and niche perk but it would actually have a use.

It's a bug with dead hard, one of streamers got it long time ago. Basically it do not apply exhaustion or animation and you can press button to dead hard over and over again.
---
What?
---
You could make the same argument about noed considering if you get a 4k before the gens are done, he‚Äôs totems getting destroyed, which is why a lot of people compare noed and adrenaline.

---
I don't think people hate him. 
---
He comes off a bit arrogant at times which I think rubs people the wrong way. He's not a bad guy though.
---
Some people on this sub think he‚Äôs arrogant. This is probably due to his remarks towards people in chat.

Some just don‚Äôt like him because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not good at the game‚Äù

I once arrested a dude who burglarized someone's house to attack them over Fortnite.

Killer‚Äôs have challenges, daily rituals. The whole point of the game is to be an asymmetrical horror it doesn‚Äôt need another mode to change that. But hell, the game doesn‚Äôt have dedicated servers yet (but they will soon) and it has been like 3 years since the initial release. The game has so many problems still (hitboxes, lag switchers, many many bugs, etc.), and I feel like another mode would just add more.

Nice thanks dude

You bet.

I‚Äôm still like a baby at this game so I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing, is this survivors crouching? Like can someone help me lmao
---
I have a question. Is there always five totems in any map?
---
Both it is :)
---
 thx
---
Spirit‚Äôs husk can body block while in phase mode. She should be way higher
---
Except Adrenaline rewards survivors for actually doing well compared to NOED...
---
People who suggest Adrenaline nerfs make no sense...
---
Not getting to use NOED because you got a 4K before the gens were done is different than not getting to use adrenaline because you died too fast. 
---
For the record my opinion on NOED is that its only lame when someone uses it on high end killers (Nurse, Billy, Spirit) or they use it to face camp all game, get gen rushed because of their face camping, and then use NOED to get another kill. ZZZ on those games.
---
I get why NOED can be frustrating, but its overall fine where its at. If I got to change anything I wanted about it I would only make the exposed status show as soon as its active and add a totem counter to small game.
---
adrenaline and noed aren't equivalent. one rewards players that have completed their objective, and the other rewards players for failing. they're pretty much opposites. the only thing they have in common is that they proc when the gens are finished/hatch is closed.
---
Yea it was Tibia, couldn't remember the name thanks.
---
I‚Äôm hoping I can mori people non stop for the entire event.
---
Whats that perk lol
---
I use the Halloween eyes, any stereotypes you can throw at me?
---
Oh boy, you didn't meet insidious noed nurse inside exit gates. Yes, nurse is able to teleport everywhere where survivors can get. Exit gates, even closed, is no exception.
---
It doesn't start at 12am gmt
---
But that will cripple your own BP gaib if you Mori everyone after only hooking them once
---
He‚Äôs a bit slow. Be patient with him.
---
Directly fighting the killer: Friday the 13th. Tried this. We all saw how well that went for them.
---
Surviving for a "set" amount of time: Just a king of the hill, vs an un-killable character. Sweet.... or we get back to the time where people can take the game hostage.
---
Killer has certain obj to complete to kill the survivors: Wtf? No killers job is pretty simple, deal with the survivors as they do objs to survive, not the reverse. Having the killer do objs, while the survivors just straight up hide is honestly a terrible idea. "Have them try to stop the killer" thats exactly what we have in place now, just the exact opposite, and it would be straight stupid to balance.
---
&gt;Map design:  here is no way to avoid the killer besides hiding or sneaking around  
---
You're not expected to avoid the killer all game. The job is to mindgame them, and try to survive long enough. You are 100% supposed to get caught and killed. If we could just hide from the killer all game, do you understand just how damn boring that would get?
---
I understand where you're coming from, thats there isn't a huge variety of choices when escaping the killer. Tho adding things like vents wouldn't work. You'd have to design the entire game around sneaking passages. Killers, maps, survivors. All of it, simply because chases just don't happen on a crouching field.
---
This game largely revolves around suriving long enough to escape, chases, and team work.Not how long you can stay hidden from a killer.
---
Why? Are you just being a dick on purpose?
---
He max-skilled his camping skills. That was the reason i stopped watching him. He is just average.
---
They changed it a while back from pure white to a more red colour, but I still feel like it can be a bit harsh... I‚Äôm not sure what would work better, though, because it‚Äôs not like they can make the screen go black or something (since it wouldn‚Äôt make sense).
---
This would be terrifying to play against, and that's why I love it, even though I don't like playing the clown.
---
I've never seen someone point that out before but that's actually very true. I don't use MoM when playing surv but when I play killer it does feel irritating to catch someone, be able to down them and they get away when it doesn't really feel like they should. Definitely a fair comparison. At least the new MoM has to be earned a bit more.

---
Yeah. Kind of annoying. Not sure if it's  feature or a bug
---
I understand why she's fun to play as. I just don't like her ability. Standing still is a mind game with very little counterplay because you have to guess most of the time which is frustrating.
---
NOED:  Rewards bad players with oneshots and haste effect.
---
Adrenaline: Rewards good players for doing their job with a heal and a 5 second speed boost.
---
If you think these 2 perks are comparable to each other in fairness I don't even know what to tell you.
---
Looping is basically wasting the killer's time by causing him to chase you for a long time and "looping" him around pallets. Facecamping is standing infront of a hooked survivor as a killer, insuring that they won't be unhooked.
---
i felt this my fucking heart oh my god
---
Dbd facebook groups are fucking terrible.
---
Console ones even worse.
---
He hurts survivor main's feelings by making fun of SWF groups and how often they get carried.
---
He's not wrong, they just don't want to hear the truth.
---
Other than that, sometimes he just makes excuses for loses that are his fault.
---
If the killer is competent and is putting out pressure, one guy running around and only focusing on totems instead of doing generators is essentially making the game a 3v1, and the first 2~ minutes of the match can be crucial.
---
Add in the fact that there is no way of telling if your teammates are also doing totems (so you have to check EVERY spot yourself) and that there is no way of telling noed is even being used (so most of the time you are completely wasting your effort) and you can see why the currenty design of NOED can be frustrating/problematic.
---
Not everyone plays in a 4/3 stack to communicate totem progress. In fact, most of the playerbase plays solo/with 1 friend.
---
I commonly have this bug so I thought this might be useful for some others.
---
So far I've seen 8am, noon, 2pm EST, 8pm GMT (4pm EST), 12am GMT... I guess we'll see.
---
r/croppingishard
---
I think blood warden is a great perk as a survivor playing against it. It's 100% avoidable but it always makes you play a bit different toward the end game just in case the killer has it, even though most of the time nobody is running it. I like the fear that it creates and the second guessing. Definitely doesn't reward bad play either, as you have to at least be a bit tactical using it.
---
YES, HERE COMES THE CRAPPER
---
No she didn't I have a longer video if needed
---
That's not noed I was already injured and okay I wasn't sure
---
Ah, makes sense. Thanks! Yeah, facecamping seems like a dick move. Seems like some kind of 'fuck you in particular' without any good reason.
---
This seems a bit far but I want crossplay, I‚Äôve wanted to play with my brother who‚Äôs on a different platform for so long.
---
Oh man! I love when the nurse does that. I tried it the other day but it wouldn't let me
---
Apologies I googled it and said they normally start at 12am gmt, I only started playing this game on Monday :D sorry for my misconception
---
Glad to help. You should have seen some of my games last night. Its bad on the survivor side as well. I hover around 10 but last night I thought about changing my name to "Corn" based on how much I was farmed in some games.
---
Same I love games with bots because you usually can enjoy multiplayer by yourself but adding bots would cost a lot of resources to do. 
---
Let‚Äôs take a look at the benefits and disadvantages. 
---
Benefits:
---
Offline play
---
New player can play tutorial trials
---
Testing experimental builds
---
Downsides:
---
Would take a lot of time and resources 
---
Might need to higher A.I teams. 
---
As this game has no ai to begin with... the crows aren‚Äôt ai btw there simply zones that if the player steps in they trigger them to fly away and the game runs a check before they get startled if the player is running calm sprit the crows will ignore the player in their trigger zone same with urban evaders or crouching players.
---
If I ever see someone teabagging me at the gate I'm just gonna turn and walk the fuck away.
---
Someone said they got rid of it but clearly not :s
---
Feel free to show it.
---
If I know they have opened it and are just waiting for me I don't even go over there just let the timer run down
---
Sadly they changed that :(
---
I'd assume that guy is new to the game and (possibly?) Migrated from identity v. Tunneling is super common there and attack recovery animations are much slower so hitting the bodyblocker instead could easily end up in both survivors just GONE. XD
---
That short boost to the door could save a teamates life who is getting chased and is running to the door hoping it‚Äôs opened.
---
Idk he wears a weird hat like all the time though
---
Is this bannable? There was two ppl doing this with me. Rip my mori daily.
---
Me completing an Overcharge Skillcheck against a doctor with Unnerving Presence and Tier 2 zappy skillchecks.
---
Ok, but still I don't agree. But everyone has it own opinions.
---
Yeah dude why complain about an unengaging and boring gameplay where killer sits under your hook and then follows you the moment you get off so you don't get to play the match at all.
---
It's so entitled to want to get to play the game, isn't it?

For which you have no indicator and it's just wishful thinking in most situations.
---
It was hard to see as killer though.
---
Particular screens made the experience brutal.
---
Dont be a claudette ez.
---
We know.
---
What did they change ?
---
I've watched him for years and I don't have an issue with him at all.  Sometimes he can sound a little condescending, but as far as DbD personalities go, he seems far less bitchy or toxic than some of the other top players.
---
Of all the videos of his I've watched, he seems to be chill the majority of the time and often calls out nice plays against him instead of being completely salty. Maybe some of his older stuff is different though.
---
I dont even know what that means I just play her with her glow in the dark prom dress
---
5 minutes? That's cute
---
In lol everyone gives vision to each other, if they were to implement a totem counter then this comparison would be more fitting.
---
Is it just 1 out of all of them or 1 for both survivors and killers?  
---
Cause theres so many good ones that I kinda wish we got at least 1 killer and 1 survivor :(
---
Man the way they had it looking was super creepy! What happened? They need to revert back to this look
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68260/
---
Never seen that before. Bit harsh, but very cool.
---
I mean I get that but with the amount of moris you said you got I thought you were just gonna use them every game.
---
The guy comes off a bit arrogant and he is quite full of himself at times but that's who he is and he does seem to be better than he used to from some streams I have watch recently but he not a bad person, hes also not too bad at the game. 
---
When it comes to Reddit, people are like sheep, a lot of people who may give Tru3 some stick, most prob have never even watched anything from him or have an actually opinion on him but just copy others who say the same thing because they either think its the cool thing to say on the this Reddit. Honestly just take what anyone says on reddit with a pinch of salt mate.
---
T-bagging is when survivors crouch very fast. Its usually a way of saying ‚Äúha you didn‚Äôt kill us‚Äù or ‚Äúloser get good‚Äù. It is disliked by majority of the community

Yeah I'd praise them if they didn't camp and tunnel the others :/

Not if they bring 4 toolbox and gen rush so hard you can‚Äôt do much without a mori lol.
---
I know but by "use them" I thought you were just gonna kill survivors no matter what since you said you had like 50 of them.
---
True, he is a bit more focused at doing that now. Does Thanataphobia work well on him? I know the numbers on it are rather low but seems like Legion would have greater uptime on it.

---
it's legit both ways around though, when i play survivor i get tunneled or camped most of the time. When i play killer there's always 1 guy that is toxic. but as killer you have 4x more chance to go against someone toxic
---
Is she Japanese? I need to re read her lore.
---
i didnt see it
---
Bullshit. I cleansed five in a game once against a Clown who incidentally was not running NOED anyway. 
---
Some games you get potato teammates and nothings gonna change that. If you have halfway decent teammates they can buy you enough time to at least pass through most areas where totems spawn. 
---
Hell, you don't even have to cleanse. Just note where they are and do a pass through later to check for NOED after gens are done.
---
I'm solo queue 95% of the time, btw.
---
And they loop you again? Nice.
---
Same,good to know I'm not the only one but am disappointed that I cant play

Honestly I love Spies. It only ever gives me any information like once a game but I love it like a son.

I've had troubles finding lobbies but inevitably found a match as killer. Took me ten minutes tho. Be patient I guess.
---
Told me I was triggered by MoM and that my build was too tryhard, and I also apparently camped and tunneled all game
---
Yeah true, let him play how he wants to play even if he looses
---
what rank are you? what else did you manage to accomplish that game?
---
also, learn to read, you fucking moron. i said it was unrealistic, not impossible.
---
Like what other objectives? Throw some real ideas out...
---
Because honestly, the few things you suggested, would lead to 100% more stale game play or absolute nightmare balancing, or just straight up only 1 side having fun.
---
Keeps saying I need an update that's not available
---
Well that‚Äôs good but, I think it should be slow actions inside it.

I'd go along with it.

Uninstall life.

You also on xbox one s?

No it was after.

I play on ps4 and I remember that it was like that when it got released there so I think they patched it a year ago (?)

Cross play
---
Not my point lol, I mean for those who don‚Äôt like to heal, they get rewarded for staying injured
---
Idk. I dont even know IF its an exploit... OhTofu said it is one but wouldnt say how it worked and it happened to me as well when i was playing surv and i did nothing special

Already did.  I play dbd.

My point is doesn't do anything so why have it all

It's been 35 plus minutes for me trying on both sides.  I give it 5 or so minutes then requeue and nothing.  I just don't get it.
---
Just walk to them backwards, they don‚Äôt get their chase points plus you don‚Äôt give them the satisfaction of seeing them teabagging. They‚Äôre usually too pussy and just immediately run out, scared you‚Äôll be able to turn around and down them super quick
---
Perfect. Thanks.
---
Same
---
Ahh, darkest moonlight on shelter woods.. without lightborne
---
It‚Äôs a gaming community, so no. Toxicity goes hand in hand with a community largely composed of immature dudes. But DBD has a far less toxic community than many games, in my experience. I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs far smaller than the likes of OW and DOTA.
---
It's already on?
---
Whoever you‚Äôre best with. It‚Äôs generally easier to net more BPs if you stay away from killers who are hard to earn deviousness on, like Pig. LF is one of the better farming killers. Wraith is great. A lot of people use Doc or Nurse. Freddy and Legion are also great assuming you have BBQ on all of them. It‚Äôs just up to you. Just remember to kick gens and break pallets and hook every survivor and there‚Äôs no reason you should leave a match with less than 20k points unless you get wrecked.
---
Also, stay away from BP bonus perks like thrill of the hunt. It takes up a slot that something useful, like Enduring, could be in. Also, it doesn‚Äôt net you additional BPs, it just helps you reach the cap faster which you can easily do without them.
---
Points wise doctor or legion and i‚Äôd have bbq on either
---
I love it. It looks famtasticcccc. Too bad she doesn‚Äôt have a... SWORD fish. 
---
I‚Äôll get camped for an eternity now.
---
I can somewhat agree
---
I believe 2 pm est but i know there is a countdown somewhere
---
If you don't tunnel or camp and they teabag anyway, it's probably because they don't win too often. Someone who's good would just leave and move on to the next game rather than waste time at the exit. I really wish they'd add as soon you set foot into the exit and no one is hooked, you have 5 seconds to leave or the Entity snatches you.
---
I love it!

Eat shit you rude dickhead.

---
Tea bagging in this game is like the N-word. We can do it to each other and it's funny but if it's done to the killer it's racist. Well you know what I mean
---
Maybe add a note to 6: if you're killer and everyone has already been hooked twice, pick up a survivor and let the others save them by pallet stunning you.
---
~~oh yeah~~
---
So I‚Äôm new to this game. What does that meter at the top mean? Also damn perfect timing from your controller lol
---
I'm done with you if you're going to be a dick.
---
And I am freeeeeeeeee
---
Freeeeeee faaaaallin'
---
Yeah most player use the term for when other survivors remove you from the hook in an unsafe position and don't do anything to protect you from the killer. Some players also use it to refer to working with other survivors and the killer to earn points during double point weekends.  
---
So an example from a game last night. Spirit pulled me from the gen near the start of the match. She was playing conservative, so I guess she had BBQ and Chili and didn't see anyone, and stayed near me on hook not even 5 seconds later a Nea runs in to remove me and body blocks me on the side the killer was coming from. Second hook I was rescued about 10 seconds in by the same Nea but this time I was able to out move the spirit long enough to run to a safe area. Find the first Nea and another who start to heal me near a pallet. Spirit comes and they body block me and throw down the pallet right in front of me allowing the spirit to get a down.  I forgot to check perks but I'm almost sure she had We're going to Live Forever.
---
The problem with Adrenaline isn't just with having one of them, that's manageable, it's when more than one survivor has it that it becomes a problem. This was also a problem old MoM and old DS had. There is nothing more demoralizing than having four people injured and then suddenly everyone is back to full. Not only that, but it also picks up survivors who are on the ground and fully heals them on unhook, so there isn't any way to counter it other than NOED, which I don't like running because it's bullshit.
---
Aww she's so precious ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
if you wanna cuss at me, im going to do it back. also, you're not reading what im typing, so....
---
If this wasn‚Äôt a shitpost I‚Äôd lay into you for being dumb. 
---
But since it is a shitpost. Nice bait.
---
Yeah dude you have to be an asshole to other people, that's what is to be expected. No other way.
---
Yep, having same issue, restarted and cleared cache and still nothing. Its an issue on their end not ours.
---
Plenty of other perks need it before the newest ones.
---
I usually leave
---
Oh nooo. I forgot to bring my mori
---
thank you !
---
I managed to snag a teabagger with NOED by just waiting outside the gate. he went a little too far out and *smack* on the hook he went. He then proceeded to call me a facecamper of camping his hook right next to the open gate
---
I would so the same except for teabagging. What you have to understand is that not everyone likes farming. I do likd getting a lot of BPs but I hate farming. That's why I just do the gens and get out as quick as I can, so I can join another, real match.
---
There‚Äôs an update for Xbox one DBD and we can‚Äôt download it. It says there‚Äôs an update needed, but Xbox can‚Äôt get it right now.
---
Oh i see! I never knew about that part of the perk, thank you!
---
Lol this is funny and I main killer. Rule #1 of Killer Club, Rule #2 of killer club, you do not talk about killer club.
---
I used to mindgame a lot when I first got my hands on Rin, but now that she's my main, I hardly do it anymore. I find it too cheesy
---
Most Definitely but his parks need it too
---
I think he is not talking about playing a side more than the other. I think he is talking about players only playing one side and never giving the other one a shot. Those players are often the main source of entlitement in the community since they always only see half of the game balance and don't care about the other half
---
Yeah its not letting me open it at all on Xbox atm, was working earlier.
---
I'd restarted the game and the console and nothing.  I got 1 Lobby with Killer,  but it spawned in 3 survivors and never gave me a 4th so I had to close it out and try again.
---
Oh damn that's rough. I get that a lot and I've just learned to deal with it... By me "dealing" with it, I just scream at my damn monitor.
---
Big oof.
---
Thanks
---
I love the perks. "I'm all ears" now helps tremendously with loops especially when stacked with his No-Stain and Zero-terror-radius if he activates his power mid chase. Thrilling Tremors slows the game down and let's you see what generators are being worked on a the time of being picked up which eliminates pointless walking around and patrolling which obviously saves you time. This helps you build momentum fairly easily as it can create a snowball effect. Even if they try not working on a generator when they see a person go down, they are forced to wait for the time duration which wastes their time. 
---
The only perk that I agree with you on is definitely Furtive Chase. I don't see it being useful in really any situation on any killer
---
Unfortunately match making issues have plagued this game but recently it seems worse than ever. I used to consider dbd my main game but sitting in empty lobbies has become a chore sucking the fun from the game. Luckily for me the new PoE league just released so I'm sinking my teeth into that.
---
That is what makes it creepier. The fact that something so cute would be capable of such harm.
---
The slow motion was a nice touch!
---
Was that noise in the 3 sec video an advertisment of your channel? Couldn't make it out.
---
Is the perk fixed yet? I think it was last patch where it broke, it would constantly trigger on a guy hooked in the basement
---
You didn't do the international farming signal. You have to spin 5 times counter-clockwise, 3 times clockwise, 1 more time the other way, and then do the moonwalk.
---
I just started playing that game. I haven't made it too far but I'm really enjoying it.
---
You are too poor to allow yourself to pay for cosmetics.
---
I am the same way, its shards or nothing.
---
It counters spirit, pig, Micheal, Wraith, Ghostface, Freddy,

The randomly placed totems in the game could be reused for a different concept, maybe you have to get a car working to escape and go around doing tasks to get the car working such as carrying tires, filling up fuel. Maybe an objective to take down the killer seeing how in some horror movies the characters find a way to banish them so maybe they need to find relics or other things around the map to help them vanquish the killer but as they get closer to the goal the killer gets stronger to a certain degree. A relay race type objective where the survivors have something the killer wants or needs and you can give it to other players to escape with it.
---
And you can heal up to 99, keep your gen speed buff, then finish the heal if the killer comes by and you need to run
---
There are two halfs of a day and most people prefer day over night. Same thing right? Pepega
---
Also most people I know who play TF2 or KF2 can play nearly all the classes effectively so I dunno where you're getting the 1 - 3 number from.
---
Forgot to switch accounts there bud?
---
Yeah, I guess it would take a lot of resources. But this game is really fun, and i want to play it, but its dead. I can't get lobbies. I can wait 5 whole minutes and never get a room.
---
Okay gonna most likely get downvoted but if I'm looping and in chases with the killer, I tbag rather than escaping so I can take the killer away from gens to help my team.
---
Woke up early to get started... Sadness.
---
Drake? Where's the hatch?

I can attest to this

I didn't know inactive traps were a thing until I saw this post. Started playing the game 2 weeks ago again after a few months off.

Can confirm. An X player too
---
If video games are making kids more violent why do I keep beating them up?
---
Petition to make them the killers, so when Meg drops a pallet on them they can yell, ‚ÄúMEG‚Äù together
---
I understand the stigma with nurse and hillbilly getting NOED but it's all the worse killers have to stop the ds spam with adrenaline.
---
Most of the clips were too long and overloaded with sound effects. Tone down on the clip length and don't use 5 different sounds effects in a single clip continously. Some clips just make no sense whatsoever, let's take 1:37, why this sound? As far as I am concerned this type of sound is used in a rather passive moments but you used it in an action sequence which lasted a whole 10 seconds before you applied another 2 sound effects. 
---
It would've been much better if you speeded up that clip by 2x and added an exaggerated action sound effect and when the survivor was downed you should've immediately replace the action effect by the splat sound and allowed 2 seconds to let that sink in. On a bonus note, if you added some visual special effects to increase the intensity of a rather simple chase sequence it would've felt powerful. 
---
Instead you went with the 'more sound effects the funnier' way.
---
This remains the worst argument for NOED
---
Jesus christ people. Check the flair.
---
Heh good idea
---
For every time the obsession is hooked, you get a token. With a maximum of 4 and losing all of them if the obsession dies, each token decreases your terror radius by 4 meters. Whoever unhooks the obsession becomes the obsession
---
Id rather see all of huntress perks get reworked.
---
Yes, that is a situation where it happens. But that is indeed a situation where "my team sucks". Being facecamped to death isn't a "my team sucks" it's a "this guy ruined my match" situation. That is why Behaviour will bother trying to challenge camping than not doing gens.
---
What's NOED? Only got the game yesterday lol
---
Another important thing for killers. Don't hit the guy that just got unhooked right away. It takes away the "safe" unhook bonus
---
Better bloodweb navigating. At the very least, an option to just automatically buy a level randomly. It takes forever on console to go through the bloodweb
---
Survivors that don't use self-care are practically biblical üòÇ

So the team of four running ds bt dh and adrenaline get an added bonus against the poor trapper who almost got them down?

Before it seems like i'm just completely nagging on your ideas, or trying to destroy them for no reason. Understand there are 1000s of countless suggestions, from players that are low rank, or high rank. Both killer and survivor. People have a hard time looking at it from both sides, since this all based on a 1v4 game, with different end objectives depending on what you play.
---
Fighting the killer was already touched on by another game. That game absolutely died faster than you can imagine, and it was supposed to be the "end" of DBD. They will avoid them sort of mechanics at all cost.
---
Fixing a car, a single point objective. Regardless if you have get other things, you're bringing it back to a single location. (3 gen strat, is currently the most powerful setup as a killer). Imagine a 1 gen strat, 200% chance killers just wipe the floor with you.
---
Totems in general need a rework, so there is a possibility of opening another objective/side objective up there. (though we literally already have it, totems are just terribly placed currently) I believe it was there intentions to make this a side objective, they just kinda flopped on execution
---
A relay race idea could work... but just think of this. Some people are trash at chases, thats why they are Gen jockeys, same for medics. You're now forcing them to participate in a part of the game they like to avoid. Not to mention 0 perks, survivors, and killers were designed with this in mind, so thats an entire rework on core systems.
---
This is an asymmetric game. Which require massive planning ahead of time, and constant changes to keep them alive. We're on year 3, and this is first game, of its kind to even live this long. So clearly they're on the right track. Others have failed so hard in this genre they you have to be incredibly careful, and hell this has been going solid so far, so why make any massive changes to the core game.
---
I really like those!  Do you have any similar ideas for entity hooks?
---
Mettle of man.

I think both Killers and Survivors should gets Auric Cells for leveling up devotion. Not even that many, maybe like 100-200 for each devotion level. Considering that it takes the average player a thousand years to level up Devotion, I feel like that would be pretty fair.
---
Somebody enjoys some Dead Meat :)
---
If the Killer is reliably downing people near-instantly to the point that no gens are done during the chase then they have the right to get more than two kills.
---
Though I do agree NOED does basically guarentee a 2k if you camp.
---
That's fucked up and its abusing the glitches in game.
---
Yup. Did the same thing. I'm super peeved because for the past week I haven't been able to play because I kept getting an error 302 message on load up. BHVR was supposed to restart my progress today so I am able to play but then I started getting this.
---
hehe..
---
It'll end sometime on Tuesday
---
It‚Äôs not op in the sense that Adrenaline is op you‚Äôre willingly losing a whole perk until the end of the match especially when the perk is tied to the chance totems are still up most perks are pretty balanced tbh the only thing is feel is crazy op is the area leatherface can chainsaw should be smaller
---
r/woooosh
---
I‚Äôm not very good at comedic timing
---
I just want my 4 stacks of BBQ and Chili, to be honest. The bloodpoint grind is real, man.
---
Depends if I need bp. If I get a message and  levelling someone had core. Slap on a BPS and go for it. 
---
If I have limited time and want to play a game I leave. I'll just message back saying "cheers but I just want play normal game right now, thanks for asking though" 
---
I think it's important to thank them for the pre game message as there's nothing worse than being forced into a farming game if you don't want to. So more killers need to do it if they want to farm.
---
This sub is full of people who get so butthurt lol. I swear.
---
It's just sad when people feel the need to be a sore winner in a glorified hide-and-seek game.

Of course they might be worried the new Bananna Splits movie will sue them.

---
that's beautiful
---
What about Circular Saws that the killer straps the player down to?  A furnace that is starting to 'turn on'?  Timed electric chair?
---
Utilized both pallets at the start of the vid. That building is a fckn nightmare as killer.
---
Deerstalker honestly isn't bad as it lets you more openly slug which opens up oppertunities to stall the game and make smart plays. But it suffers from the eternal DBD perk problem of "why would I run this over top tier meta garbage?"
---
\*sighs for 7 seconds\*
---
QFT
---
No
---
It's basically American politics in a video game.
---
No. Would be dope if they did just save up 3 days worth of the best ones and you'd be swimming in BP.
---
its just a hiccup 
---
This also has been happening for me on Ps4
---
ever since they updated it, to no longer start a match when one player dc's in the loading screen
---
ive experienced what seemed to be killer lobby dodging but its not, as  on the killer side i see survivors backing in and out losing connection and getting sent back to the Title screen
---
Behvr has taken note of this on ps4 side and said that its possibly due to psn issues 
---
now we have people on xbox being unable to play do it the game thinking it needs an update when it dosent
---
I wish I'd get a message like that every now and then.  I play killer exclusively during blood hunts (minus survivor dailies if they can't wait till the event is over) so I always message everyone I can.
---
i started running before haunted grounds got activated
---
Tell me how this is a glitch? The Nurse‚Äôs Power is to literally go through obstacles, and that includes exit gate barriers.
---
Hitting a survivor with a hatchet isn't that hard.
---
Impossible. That technique is here to stay and no one can oppose the facts.
---
Is it an issue with the double bloodpoints update?
---
Yes my friends and I all had the same issue
---
What is happening I‚Äôm in school right now can‚Äôt see
---
If you want to play survivor during events (or even not on events) take a build that has prove thyself and we're gonna live forever. I usually cash out same BP as the killer if I'm on the ball with saves and coop gens.
---
Aaah, I see. It's a FIGHTING game. Well now I don't feel so bad for bringing a piece of glass and my special glove to the trial! 
---
:P
---
Ghostface release I think
---
I don't think it's impossible but okay
---
I hear you, there is nothing more annoying than being camped and seeing that no one is doing gens. But, I don't know, I still have a problem with this line of thinking. Ok, it's a "this guy ruined my match" situation, but what happened before that? First you were found. Then you were caught. Why not just accept that you made two mistakes and now you're dead? Yep, it sucks that the killer isn't giving you a second/third chance, but why not just deal with it and move on to the next match? The rules of the game state that you MAY have to be hooked 3 times before you die. But everyone translates it to "I MUST be hooked 3 times, I deserve this!". No, I'm sorry, you just don't.
---
is it enough tho, thats the right question
---
Herman is almost as big as trapper. why would you fight him?
---
Ever heard of Ochido and AngryPug? They‚Äôre even worse.
---
If you‚Äôre on console go onto their name an use it you‚Äôll be taken to their account on steam just roll the dice on the name you see or thank them in chat
---
Survivors are sterotyped as toxic because there are 4 of them per match and you're henceforth four times as likely to meet a toxic one #ChangeMyMind
---
Even without HG you still made a bad play. I'm not shitting on you lol. Just explaining that you were also to blame.
---
 Xbox too it just thinks you dc too but also gives you blood points it says the other survivor dc too on there screen

We love a good Feng play. üëè

Dude sparking like a mother fucker just gonna grab an Aquafina bottle and chuck it on him

No. It just doubles the score you got after the match.

The Furnace idea would work great for Bedlam Preschool, and the timed electrical chair would be great for the hospital.

Not sure where the circular saws would best fit though.

its always that one survivor who died early for me LOLOLOL
---
Maybe but my rage induced by his pedophilia will give me Super Saiyan like powers to rip his god damned head off in this world, the next, the dream world and every alternate universe as needed
---
The game is just refusing to launch at this point now.
---
I'm assuming they're pushing an update out, and we're just not receiving it yet. Though honestly no idea, never seen this issue on xbox yet lol.
---
While yes his powers are op Actually no probably wouldn't die from him since he thinks he would take him on technically he would beat freddy the easiest out of all these killers you can beat freddy just by literally fighting back it's your dream you can also use powers against him
---
Each one of them would make you cry like a bitch. 
---
Freddy would diddle you fart box until you cried for mommy.
---
Do you wanna know how fast I am? I am fast as fuck boiiiiii

It'd be cool but he's like from the space age, and everyone else is from this age ü§£ Would be difficult to work him into the game hahaha, would be funny to see a dude in an EVA suit vaulting pallets though.

Megan should be the killer then.

Oh okay. Thank you for the reply. I just didn't want it to be me that was constantly getting kicked and people thinking I was a jerk and disconnecting out of no where, lol. Just confused me,because it always shows the killer and I disconnected but everyone else not. Didn't want to get reported for no reason. Glad to know it isn't me üëç. Hopefully this gets fixed for everyone soon.
---
and doomfist.
---
I'd rather just get fucked by her
---
I wish there was like a collective hub for everybody to post their shit too, suppose I could search through reddit and Google though. People make some crazy cool stuff
---
I honestly would rather get one toxic survivor over a toxic killer. Like, when I‚Äôm playing killer, if one persons toxic I‚Äôll find a way make him/her regret that. But if I‚Äôm playing survivor, if the killer camps and shit that ruins the game for eVERYBODY because half the time if you just do gens you either depip or safety pip if you‚Äôre lucky, plus just doing gens is boring as all hell. I can still have great games if only one survivor is toxic but I can‚Äôt have a good game against a toxic killer, if that makes sense.
---
I mean, it IS the interwebs.
---
It is to be expected.
---
Lol, i've got Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark on in the background and the theme tune started playing right as you made the move to go back to the hook. Nice play!
---
I don‚Äôt think timeline matters because plague is from ancient babylon. It might look weird at first but it would still be really cool!
---
Like a lot lizard skin?
---
Oh yeah onii San!
---
I don't think its as big of a problem as 4 old DS's or MoMs. Having all four survivors running either of those two perks could be the reason all the gens got done before you even got a kill where adrenaline doesn't change anything until the gens get done.
---
If you get to the point where all the gens are done and you don't have a kill then IMO you should already be in the mind set of accepting it just not being your game. Can't win them all, right?
---
I totally get the frustration of having a rough game and then 4 adrenaline's pop, I just don't agree that it really changes a whole lot especially not to the scale that old DS and MoM could.
---
So you‚Äôd beat the shit out of the killer whose mori is to maul you and then rip an organ out of your body as you‚Äôre dying. 
---
Out of your mind lad.
---
If that comment hadn't been made I'd never have found her, but she's just to the left of the tractor.
---
Played the other night and I would hook someone in the basement, get up there stairs and about 5 seconds away and they would be unhooked, so I would turn around and head back, hit the rescuing survivor as they are leaving and the other person would still be down there, rinse and repeat for 2 kills. One dude was actually looking in the chest after I had came back down.
---
I feel like doc would be super strong and legion you are fighting 4 people who are gonna utterly destroy you haha I wouldn't even try with huntress giant Russian who took out many soldiers by herself
---
It looks so fucking cool

You're all good it made me looj like that one fish from SpongeBob when he hears giggling as he drinks.

All Bloodpoint addons are ADDITIVE not multiplicative.

Lets say you get 10,000 BP, got 4 stacks of BBQ, plus the event, and had a party streamer. 10K + 10K + 10K + 10K = 40,000 BP
---
# xd
---
What does M1 mean?
---
The extra points that the events give you work as if they were an extra offering of points, because they are given **after** the match, based on your base match bloodpoints.

Uhhhhh skydoesminecraft
---
It only takes alive survivors so like Adam and Jane were pulled last minute from the crash. It still takes killers that have died because they are given power from the entity as servants.
---
It's not really a surprise... If you're the obsession you'll see the killer aura every time a gen is finished, and you get exposed as soon as gen 5 is done.
---
I don't think he kills them. Survivors tend to stumble upon an Entitys "location/fog", or some place hes caused destruction. Sorta like how people find "Silent Hill" in the movies. You just stumble upon it, and by then its too late.
---
Killers vary depending on the situation. Each either had a traumatic evil experience or died a terrible death, and begged for a 2nd chance. Tho the same method that pulls in survivors can seemingly be used on killers to. The clown for example, traveled and loves to kill. He eventually stumbles upon a location, and gets pulled through.
---
Though not all killers are compliant, the entity does have to torture some of them, till they decide to do his bidding.
---
Yeah this subreddit is very killer-biased. God forbid someone main survivor
---
It's fairly common and you will not be able to walk past.

Any killer with a Kanabo gets my vote.
---
This!! The worst thing about NoED especially in solo is that it rewards killers when playing poorly. If someone is being camped, we always say to focus on gens so they only get a 1k but that doesn‚Äôt leave enough time to look for and cleanse 5 full totems without risking another camp. So the killer gets NoED and gets another kill or maybe more. If it‚Äôs earned like how MoM needs to be then it would make its second chance much less frustrating.

this legit this i've said this multiple times before, a toxic survivor cant ruin the game by himself a toxic killer can.

Well hag has Hex: Ruin. So its likely lots of new killers, are trying to unlock her perk for others.
---
Though she is one of the higher tier killers, so could just be them practicing.
---
There is no punishment so they don't care, and that's bullshit
---
Those corn stalks are more powerful than you think :p
---
Most likely her lvl 35 teachable hex:ruin its practically mandatory at red ranks so learning it as son as possible might be causing a lot of players to play hag.
---
Lol i got one of those too! I got 4k with my level 1 pig and this guy threatened to ban me because I was "hacking". I took it as a compliment lol. I wonder if it was the same guy. Was it username rapidpup6713981?
---
I just hide by the gate and wait for the killer to either down and take away the gate person or Chase them away then take over, like a shadow.

My stand [INVISIBLE MAN] will defend these generators

killers that dont use bbq or noed

I think it has to take alive survivors  but with killers it can take them after death or just when it gets the chance

I don't know why, but ever since I started running Stakeout Skillchecks just never appear.

I fond i get less BP when I camp on survivors. Camping on gens when there's only 3 left though is another story.

Scarecrow cosmetics for the Hillbilly. All of his costumes are terrible, the community has wanted a scarecrow killer for a while now, and his map is a fucking cornfield. What are they even waiting for?

---
But the other side is UHBJECTIVELY WORSE!!
---
If you don't understand, I don't know how else to explain it.
---
Usually I go along with it but I am very cautious. I've been tombstoned before by a killer saying he wanted to farm.
---
It's partly the fault of reddit and partly his own fault. He's an emotional guy. If someone in chat writes something dumb (or simply something he disagrees with) he can be pretty mopey. Obviously you don't want to watch someone that's mopey half of the time. And because on reddit you're not allowed to dislike someone if he's mostly okay but has visible flaws, a lot of people invent these horror stories about his massive ego and god knows what.
---
Read the descriptions for the 4 emblems.
---
You‚Äôll want to kick and patrol gens consistently, end chases quickly, use your power effectively, and get numerous hits on survivors. How well you do in each emblem category will dictate how pips you receive/lose.
---
The Spirit at C tier? 
---
Somebody's never used Spirit beads from this list, cause I get more asses off generators than a prize bull.
---
I dont really hate him i just find him kinda obnoxious?, he whines a lot, not the best at the game, ect. From what i have seen he seems very insecure about his image and how people talk about him on reddit, he responded to one of my comments calling him out on clickbaiting and he tried to argue with me. 
---
He seems like a nice guy, but he has kinks he needs to work out, he isnt a streamer that focuses on entertainment but he also is not one that focuses on being good at the game he is playing.
---
you havent played doc right?

I did this as a hag a few days ago... the game starts and I find what probably was a new player right off the bat. Down and hook him and he tries to get himself off the hook to no avail. Then doesn't struggle on phase 2. So insta-kill right at the beginning. About a minute later I find another. He gives me a good chase before I down him but he DC's. And again I find another survivor and who does the chase and DC when I down him. Lame... so I found the last survivor and I downed him and brought him to the hatch
---
but everyon in this game sometimes whines... so thats bs bassically
---
That is the dude David King.
---
You rank up with 3ks too, I haven‚Äôt played much I only started on Monday but getting a 3k can get you more progress than a 4K. If you get a 4K from camping hooks you don‚Äôt get as many emblem progress or something. It‚Äôs to encourage map pressure and to learn the basics of the gme rather than someone just camping a hook until the person dies.
---
NOED is a disincentive for trying to rush your opponent out of the match.
---
Is bill canon? Because that makes the sacrifice so much more depressing
---
Oh god this guy totally likes ochido
---
Sometimes you just really want one survivor in particular. I've ignored other survivors for one, at times.
---
But, she‚Äôs really hard to master due to quick reaction times and knowing where a Survivor would go or else you‚Äôll lose. And don‚Äôt get me started on Spine Chill, a Perk that lets Survivors know if they‚Äôre targeting you directly or are rerouting to get you the same way.

2pm edt , 6pm GMT, 7pm GMT+1

Especially if you go The Ghost+Coxcomed Clapper. 
---
Although the sprint after uncloak is also really good for some of the pallets, which are barely safe, and can be made unsafe by just standing, cloaking, and uncloaking Galway through a loop.
---
how else is she gonna fuck survivors so hard
---
I only started recently got into it since I watched some people me play it for the longest time and enjoyed that I suck with survived only can play killer I main huntress the axey girl
---
There has been like 3 vids of that in the last few hours
---
Cringe
---
Light was more realistic
---
I know that happens sometimes, but I guarantee you that this guy just didn‚Äôt see me. Gotta love those Xbox gamepass players
---
But is everyone a streamer/youtuber? Sure popular streamers whine from time to time, its normal. But he does it way to much.
---
in 4 minutes.
---
Nah, the only ones getting murdered are the toxic teabagging, flash lighting survivors!
---
Whats pip
---
Those kinds of players are jerks.  I've only killed people after messenging them by accident.  Whether that's because I lose track of who is who and hook them a third time by accident, or (as was the case this morning) hook a survivor for a second time when they tell me to, and no one bothers to come rescue them.
---
found the frosty eyed killer
---
I'm saying you have a unenforceable standard.
---
 I'm certain atleast half of the all directors and producers from the 70s to early 2000s did some coke off a 13 year old.
---
Cox combed clapper +all seeing blood is amazing
---
Shes so cute!
---
I started playing the game on Monday and haven‚Äôt stopped playing it since, the game is beautiful I am so upset I only got into it on Monday. I love playing killer I got to rank 10 before ranks got reset. I was playing hillbilly a lot because I heard he‚Äôs good with bbq but then I realized I needed to get leatherface to level 35 to make that perk teachable haha I‚Äôm such a noob. But now I‚Äôm playing hag I hated her at first but I‚Äôm started to get used to her ability and it‚Äôs really cool and works quite well. Tricking survivors into going over pallets to traps and forcing a chase to a trap etc. huntress is fun too!
---
She's wearing some off brand dimpers though. I like the art. Hopefully you'll get an A.
---
Camping hooks, long chases, fast gen repairs, not using ability, not shutting gen repairs down, letting 2+ escape.
---
One of these is your issue, or multiple.
---
oh, so a me.
---
Hey wait i know this man
---
I wait at the gate to give killers extra hits on the way out.. unless they were playing toxic, then i teabag and leave before they can hit me :P
---
I mean, Legion is good now, not the best but he's fun to play. Plague is kinda boring I'll admit since it's basically a EW3 Myers without the advantages of it since people just won't cleanse. 
---
I don't really think that their objective was to release a Killer that bad, or they wouldn't have buffed him like they just did. Still, kinda weird that he was first released in this state but at least he's really good now
---
Who's your friend who like to play?
---
Really?  XD 
---
I'm outside so I can't see videos really well.
---
Leave or stay and simply play the game as normal and leave.  I don't farm anymore too boring.

This happened when the game went free for PS plus last year, that's when I started playing and it was definitely the same situation. But within 2 months most of the chodes will move on to the next thing to piss on and what will be left is a community more filled by the free players that are actually having a good time and picking the game up.
---
Maybe. I think he is a slightly worse Myers, but who knows. Maybe he we have a very specific loadout that make him amazing. I could see the shorter stalking time addons makeing him pretty good.
---
2pm edt and 6pm gmt

I started playing dead by daylight January 2019. I love this game because of it‚Äôs unique with many perks and killers that you will have to improve and adapt to, and this game has some of my favorite horror movie slashers. I main Claudette because she was the first character I got to level 40.
---
I love the idea but he needs to be a wolf full time. Have his power be something that allows for better tracking of a survivor. Maybe have it when he activates his power he gets a noticication of any sounds or makes it so he can see scratch marks and blood clearer with an indicator that they are fresher like they start of white for the first second and then turn red over time
---
dont body camp
---
I also personally just keep going after the survivor that tried to sandbag. I hate when other survivors do it to me, so i punish it when i see it happen.
---
:O

When you don't understand how ping works.

Killer is the host, means he has 0 ping.

Hell yeah brutha, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about! Keep up the good work - I have over 30 days played (super embarrassing, I know) - and I still find myself getting better and more acutely award of how to react to situations on the fly. So the game should just keep getting more and more fun for u if u stick with it. Welcome to DbD, and thanks for being a positive influence on the community. Stay groovy!

it‚Äôs a top tier perk wdym
---
Hag just clicks for me. I love her so much. It's kinda like playing Techies in Dota: very different game that uses different skills.
---
I don't have to be amazing at spotting the grass twitch (Spirit) or spacing out Nurse blinks. I just have to have decent game knowledge and predict where people are going to be, and then where they'll be in 3 seconds when my attack CD is over.
---
If the double BP event already started then... that. Haha.
---
I play for bloodpoints, not kills.  So even if i get demolished I'm still content in the fact that i get twice as much BP as all the pros who just wrecked me.
---
If you are against veteran survivors, they can hear the Nurse heavy breathing behind the exit gates. Just like most memes, this only "work" against new players.

Anyone else come across unlocked DLC killers that you didn‚Äôt purchase?  Last night I had 5 extra killers I didn‚Äôt buy.
---
Oh my god
---
Its beautiful!
---
I absolutely love the design, and the Kanabo is sweet, but I don't know if it'd look right with her mori. Like I know, spider god steroids, but jamming a blunt club through a torso? I'd buy the head and body in a heartbeat though.
---
Patrol gens. Don‚Äôt camp hooks if someone gets unhooked that‚Äôs fine because while they are unhooking that guy they can‚Äôt do gens which they need to do to escape and then you can be applying pressure to someone who‚Äôs doing a gen while thinking you are trying to stop the unhook causing more pressure and stopping gens being done. It sounds stupid that you are letting someone unhook but there are 4 people in the game don‚Äôt just gunnel for one. You will eventually catch them again because after all you outplayed them once and you can most certainly do it again! Because you are a strong and independent killer.
---
Can you read? Its how they perform on lerys. C=Average meaning no impact and i never said anything about the add ons.
---
Really? I was always sure it was mid-tier, it's sorta helpful but the killers can still track you pretty easily.
---
For something this short, we typically would not do some sort of compensation. There's a fix incoming shortly.
---
On a brighter note, a bloodhunt is conveniently starting shortly, so there's that I suppose.
---
I think it's for the contest. The best costume will be put into the game. I would vote for this one and the Wraith that was posted earlier.
---
My friend got it on gamepass as well so I've been giving him tips. But since he's in the party we've been getting lower ranked games and I've seen so many more campers and tunnellers in the last couple days than I have in the past month or so.
---
I've gotten a few angry messages. A survivor even sent me one when I unhooked him while my friend ran the killer away then took a hit after he hid in the most obvious place.
---
I literally send a message after every game:
---
Get camped (Trash talk killer)
---
Own killer (GG)
---
Own Survivors (You‚Äôre welcome)
---
Get owned as killer (MoM is garbage) 
---
Face camp with Leatherface (You either die a nurse main or live long enough to see yourself become the villain)
---
Yea i get tunneled a lot.. that is not tunneling.  If I'm the only one they happen to find, oh well.  I only get salty when they beeline for me off hook, and even ignore teammates who try to run in and intercept.
---
There won‚Äôt be compensation. Well it would be unique if DBD did give compensation but I don‚Äôt see why they would. Yes we can‚Äôt play but they know we are gonna keep playing so there‚Äôs no point.
---
Why you can find such quality gamer gear at  [https://shop.deadbydaylight.com](https://shop.deadbydaylight.com/) , my good sir/madame!
---
Yeah, among the community at least it‚Äôs viewed as a strong perk. 
---
What perk is It and what it do
---
if you would miss the Blood Hunt, there would probably be a Bloodpoint compensation
---
Nice now everybody downvotes everybody to win
---
It's a mind game because you are supposed to think Myers=built in instadown so why would he have noed? Then no one tries to cleanse noed because they don't think he has it. But it's been so overused on PS4 I always expect Myers to have NOED
---
What??
---
Where is that info I never saw a notification when I logged in (PS4)
---
So even if it‚Äôs double BP are they just banking on x amount of Bp for one kill?
---
Seems sad to troll the game 
---
In the time it takes him to watch me like a hawk until I die they could‚Äôve gotten five hits on a different survivor and gotten chase points and everything else...
---
Why troll the hooked survivor ?
---
I‚Äôm glad that you got downed, the teabagging is unnecessary and the entity judged you and forced the hatchet into your back.
---
Good for you, I guess? I mean if that‚Äôs what makes you happy... üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Killers have no right to complain about DS or BT.  Both perks only affect babykillers who camp and tunnel.  Your playstyle chooses to make those perks function.  You literally do it to yourselves.
---
I forgot to mention the Terror radius is only decreased DURING  a chase
---
You're responding to an argument no one made.
---
Yeah I killer main wraith so I get at least 1 message pretty much every game from somebody saying I‚Äôm cheating because I‚Äôm going invisible
---
I‚Äôm sad that people are downvoting me :(
---
It's actually a survivor in costume
---
I forgot about the bloodhunt today thank you for the reminder
---
Thanks for the quick work, glad to be back into the game soon! :)
---
As in ,"sorry for the technical problems heres something to say were sorry"
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear there‚Äôs a fix coming soon, been trying to get on dbd since 3pm haha been a rough couple of hours.
---
Did BHVR finally give an origin?
---
thats normal, he is a human after all...
---
Are you on PS4 by any chance? If so then it doesn't matter what rank,70% of the killers play like that on PS4. Pretty much why I've stopped playing.
---
i agree with him about noed, noed shouldnt exist for me, any perk that rewards u for failing sucks... but thats my opinion lel
---
Yea i tend to not use my bloody party streamers on double blood hunts... dont wanna give the killer more bloodpoints to tunnel me.
---
Like I said I‚Äôm only level eight which means I don‚Äôt have that much time is played but if I played 10 games before today all 10 games had killers that actually play the game properly today I‚Äôve had five games and out of all five games I‚Äôve been trolled on the hook
---
Well it's hard not to let 2+ escape when you can't get your hands on them in the first place
---
That's not for 40 more minutes lmao
---
This is the internet. We all use lingo on it. Cancer is lingo for bad. I've seen people say it means bad, so there for I thought it means on the internet "bad".

&gt; I've ignored other survivors for one

especially if i need that survivor for those juicy BBQ Stacks
---
So don‚Äôt check right away.  You‚Äôll know if you hear the terror radius headed your way they aren‚Äôt camping.  If you don‚Äôt hear it just finish your gen and then go for the save.
---
To be fair, killers that play like this almost never get 4k matches unless your teammates are equally as trash and just dont do objectives. If you're being camped that's prime time for other survivors to work gens. If you die and no gens popped in that time, it's probably for the better that you got outta there so you can get new teammates lol
---
Everyone acts innocent on DBD, I don‚Äôt believe it. The toxicity is overflowing.
---
Yeah I agree it gives the other guys time but still I‚Äôm being penalized by making 200 BP got a game I qued up for 10 min for lmao
---
Okay children, settle down.
---
I would, but the devs have also said that if you get banned for it by EAC, they won't help you.
---
You‚Äôre comments give me carcinogen

When browsing r/Xbox it said that‚Äôs happening with all games also I just got out of school summer started this entire day was a graduation thing so boring but fu

Mettle of Man is that, but for survivors.
---
Getting hit is bad.
---
Mettle of Man: Gives you an extra hit because you've been getting hit, therefore rewarding people who get hit a lot.
---
Just want to put that out there, so no need to reply, especially if you just want to curse me out. I don't want to hear it.
---
Hard to counter stealth on a lot of maps. It also means the difference between walking and running away from a generator in a lot of cases.
---
Nah the overkill game is shit. The actual telltale series that was story-based and was basically a movie where you could chose what happens
---
Yeah I would mind starting a new match right away if ps4 que times were not 8min on average
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure only mentally ill people take the time to send post-game messages because they are mad.
---
Thank god they reverted that Billy nerf
---
As far as I understand it's intentional so people are more inclined to play a harder role... But to me playing killer is easier tho. I just don't like the idea of killing people so I play survivor more
---
Oh yeah, that's precisely why I stopped playing on console. The wait times are atrocious. On PC I've pretty much never waited longer than 5 minutes
---
Overkill‚Äôs still going off rn? Damn. No I was talking about the story games from telltale games.
---
Most of the mixtapes are bad now, go for the sketches
---
Probably bald

I feel like this is how I opened my lock in high school gym

Which is something I never understood since it wouldn‚Äôt  work
---
You're wrong.  Small Game does nothing to tell you about a totem a teamate may have cleansed.  You could spend the game looking for a 5th totem that doesn't exist.  It helps against babykillers running NOED but it isn't a 100% counter.  It should have a totem counter included in the perk to rectify that.  This is an issue for soloqueue.  A more accurate statement from you would be SWF has no right to complain about NOED.
---
I love this subreddit
---
Lmao I got downvoted for offering to help. I sent the friend request. I have a Mario and Bowser theme
---
Can't handle peoples opinions? Get of the internet. I'm entitled to mine just as you are to yours, but you start being an asshole when you insult. Don't matter how smart you think you sound, your still the one insulting.
---
This happened to me last game against pig, i got rbt‚Äôd, my mates popped the last gen, I said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fucking open the gate my traps active I need to re- *big fucking gong* shit. And I had to check every single box and on the way to the last one the egc triggered and I felt personally victimized
---
See I wouldn‚Äôt skip this weekend just because of the trolls but at the same time because I‚Äôm so new to the game I need this double BP event just so I can level as well
---
I do my best to play the objectives and play intelligently but I‚Äôm just surrounded by trolls add that to the Q time and this game is near Maddening for me today
---
they fail a skill check on the 6th second, manage to complete the gen what happens to be the final gen and have adrenaline.
---
Sometimes, the start align not for a cause or purpose, but just to be kind of a pain in the ass.
---
GF is not gonna work on Lery's because his woosh woosh is loud af.  
---
Also wtf is Hag doing in C tier? So many choke points, Hag is the queen of Lery's. And before you uncloak as Wraith survivors will find one billion windows.
---
Who the hell would downvote for offering to help
---
Must be a troll killer main lmao
---
You don't have to hit it very fast.
---
It is basically being removed from the game while NOED is here to stay as crutched out and unchanged as ever.  Weird timing for your comment.
---
Most likely lmao all well
---
The increase in face camping has more to do with rank reset than the double bp. I can‚Äôt tell you why people do it. As a killer it‚Äôs not very fun, but if you are in yellow ranks or above, camping is very common as new players seem to think that‚Äôs how you play killer. There‚Äôs also an increase in meme builds like basement Bubba around reset. Give it a few days.
---
Megan for third Survivor that sandbags other survivors
---
that is the situation I believe
---
High mid?  No that‚Äôs where Myers is.  Without addons he‚Äôs mid to low mid.  And with time that will probably deteriorate as survivors learn the optimal hiding spots for him to peak from on all the maps.
---
2pm eastern.
---
&gt; Awareness doesn‚Äôt stop a Pig from suddenly appearing from a row of corn
---
Good headphones do.
---
You realize how hypocritical that statement makes you? You realize what you commented in the first place, right?
---
It's literally been a thing with this killer since she was put in the game and it's so frustratingly annoying
---
Ah yea a lot of people have played those so it makes sense that they‚Äôre close knit considering they have to deal with characters they love dying in every game
---
I loved this one too. Actually scary
---
Shhhh, Marble. Don't spill the beans, homie
---
I play both and I've never tea bagged a killer. Just why lol. You look like a dick and you're being rude to someone just playing the game.
---
Watch some youtube videos I know there's a good one about how to run certain loops as killer.  It will help.

Still 5 min on pc for a que

And 8-10 for console

How many people play this globally?

That is one time where it is acceptable to teabag

The problem might be with the killer you play or even the way youre playing the killers. If i feel bad about losing with the plague (my main) i just hop on nurse or billy for a little bit and then i feel better.

So basicly i think playing fir fun and playing to win require two different mindsets.

True, true, I feel that

Well keep a spot open bro no worries
---
Dude, this. I seriously dont understand why devs keep adding this type of shit to games. Whether its struggle phases or quick time events or whatever. The companies are not that stupid, they're smart enough to realize that enough button mashing is going to eventually break your shit, but they just leave it because ya know.. reasoms
---
You just lost all credibility claiming Hag as the or even one of the worst killers.  It's common knowledge that she's actually one of the stronger killers in the game.
---
Okay.....but you do realize MoM is about to be nerfed out of the game yet the killer crutch you compared it too remains unchanged and unhealthy as ever.  So what point were you attempting to make by comparing the two lol?
---
Ok, now that is a dick move. I still do that occasionally, mostly if the survivor is lag switching.
---
What a bitch
---
Gods it was dark then!
---
What kind of traps don't activate when gens are completed? Even hag traps? Even trapper traps?
---
Ok real talk, imagine if they added in environmental "traps" like this into the maps. For example you find this box, and hey look theres a pink key inside it, but you only have an X% chance of getting the key and freeing yourself from the box (could even be altered by skill checks, increasing or decreasing chanses when you hit greats or if you fail it entirely), otherwise you go down or maybe even die in a mori like fashion. If you succeed, sprint burst to that hatch. High risk for high reward
---
Why specifically those?
---
He is worse than Michael but I'd argue with a little bit more time to learn his kit the most effectively that he would be better than the pig.
---
My life. I never get to do gens. :(
---
Chucky as a killer
---
I've been playing for a few months now so I don't think I have that excuse anymore
---
There are still terrible connections on PC.  I play with a full group in SWF and the number of times I get disconnected after I get hit or chased is fairly high.  When it happens I have to tell me friends to tell the killer it wasn't a rage quit.  It also doesn't help when I DC by myself and it ends up saying the Host DC.  I have to check if it was actually me but everytime the match has gone on and friends finish up.
---
ok thanks
---
 No
---
I'm not opposed to a counter. I'm neither a babykiller or even a killer main. I just think survivors that whine about NOED are whiny little bitches.
---
I honestly want to see someone  do a kickass shirtless myers cosmetic, but these skins be testing my desire
---
A survivor who isn‚Äôt toxic? Do my eyes deceive me???
---
I was in the same boat when I started playing killer. It was so fucking frustrating. I was talking to a friend and asking his advise, so he took me in a KYF lobby and helped explain everything to me (I main Myers.) We played probably 4 matches in KYF, and since then, I've gotten nothing but 4K's. I highly recommend practicing that way.....worked wonders from me. I absolutely despised playing killer, now I love it!
---
Double blood points should double your bloodpoints, I don't see your point.
---
Even without BBQ, if I use a survivor pudding and get max bps, that's 64k. Double bp events should double that imo.
---
Right now it's just a hidden bloody party streamer event
---
Thanks for reminding me why I play this in couple hour bursts and could never main game it lol
---
what a good comment
---
I really need this one to win it‚Äôs amazing and perfect in every way
---
Hell, I've seen enough Food Wars to know where this is going
---
It's a counterpoint to your argument
---
Soon as the match starts a killer (probably Billy or bubba) runs over to a survivor downs them, hooks them and face camps them and as soon as you get his attention off him he downs you, hooks you and goes back and forth between you and the other guy. 2 Random have borrowed time and get y'all both off.
---
Get chased to the exit gate and see if teabagging doesn't seem viable.
---
BUT ITS TRUE. like every survivor runs Adrenaline, and many killers run Noed, its for the same situation, the endgame, its literally the equivalent
---
First meme!
---
I think killers that run NOED are bitches lol.  I get it if you're like rank 15 or some thing you don't know what you're doing yet playing killer but ranking up with NOED is just pathetic.  
---
That would be a solution though and would end survivors rights to complain about the crutch.  Simply add the counter making dulls officially objectives.  At that point we can only get mad at ourselves for feeding bad killers a down endgame.
---
Why are you guys making me actually work today instead of DBD?!?!
---
I stopped reading at self-care.
---
Thanks for putting it all the way up in your wall of text, saved me a lot of time.
---
Because he‚Äôs Michael Myers, and they actually did him decently and accurately...for the most part.
---
I find surviving to be much harder than killing though..
---
When you put someone on the hook camping is sitting on them. Patrolling however is staying close enough to get back if needed while looking for other players. As a killer main I suggest looking into Deerstalker and possibly Nurses Calling to help you get better. With Deerstalker you can down a survivor and chase someone else knowing exactly where the slugged guy is when you want to hook him. Nurses Calling lets you see anyone healing and when used together can be a nasty surprise for survivors.
---
Mess around with different perks and when you have enough shards check out the shrine weekly for good perks so you don't have to level a trash killer.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a while, what‚Äôs with the bar in the upper left and the glowing red floor ?

Mettle of man. It‚Äôs pretty OP and will be nerfed soon :(

Idk about power, but the Hair straightener could definitely be in her mori

---
I‚Äôm actually playing with shaman online right now and queuing up with two people is so much faster than doing a solo queue
---
How do you mind game a survivor? The closest I've done to that is walking away from them when they teabag me at the exit gates
---
The entity forgot to close the door after restocking chests
---
3 people will watch it, 2 more than people who actually play the game.
---
At that point when you see a killer face-camping and still go for the save you get what you get.
---
Then find hatch
---
wonder if changing HG to always be the first totem cleansed is a good idea
---
Whenever someone t-bags and starts clicking their flashlight at me there‚Äôs two possibilities 
---
A. They‚Äôre a looping god who could run a nurse all game while blindfolded 
---
B. They‚Äôre some overconfident idiot who thinks they‚Äôll be gamechanging but go down instantly then DC 
---
There is never a middle ground
---
I do not mean when survivors farm, I mean when you "patrol" the area around the hook not going further than 10 meters, most of main killers do this, and it would be okay if your intentions weren't so obvious, like, going around the hook one or two times to ensure that nobody is saving behind your back it's okay, but going in circles around the hook the entire process of the entity, while gens are being repared, it's just stupid.
---
This happens to me in ranks (20-8)
---
In ranks (8-1) its a 50/50 chance, either they play good, or they straight facecamp ur ass.
---
Its e
---
Which makes exactly 0 sense lol
---
And as soon as you fall for the infinite loop and not decide maybe going for someone else is better... You get what you get.
---
Yes! Arkin for sure! Can‚Äôt wait for the third one in 2020
---
Same I‚Äôve been waiting for this for ages haha
---
This one time she was mindgaming me at the pallet, I just stayed there, staring at her for a solid 20 seconds, didn't move an inch. Then I saw her disappear and reappear far in the distance still looking for me.
---
Next time I get mindgamed at a pallet, I'm probably just getting up and grabbing a beer, no action appears to be the best reaction.
---
Glad to see that you found an excuse not to read! I know it's hard for people who are illiterate to try and fit in on Reddit, but I'm proud of you for trying! Have a nice day!
---
That's a bit *pun*itive if you asking me.
---
Felt like doing something positive in this community.
---
im pretty sure hes on the hook. i actually cannot see him and took this picture a while ago so im not certain lol
---
Ikr, hopefully it will be playable soon.
---
I just started playing yesterday. Why are Xbox players getting it an hour behind? I don't mind I'm just curious why.
---
im pretty sure thats him, i took the screenshot a while ago and wasnt sure. but i do remember him being on some red part of the hook
---
true, works great with MoM
---
We aren‚Äôt. Some kind of error is happening on DBDs side preventing us from playing.
---
Probably? It‚Äôs been down since half 2 for me that‚Äôs 4 and a half hours why just because double bps is active that is only another hour, there has been no updates apart from 2 hours ago they announced they knew about the problem if it was going to be fixed soon it would‚Äôve been done by now, the fact it‚Äôs not already fixed means it‚Äôll be a while yet.
---
You see the stats saying SWF dont really have that great of survival rates? Killers complain way too much about them to be honest. If anything they make it more balanced otherwise its too easy for the killer.
---
No bloodhunts on Xbox. In fact, haven't been able to launch the game all morning, no one else has either.
---
Game is currently unlaunchable for many, if not all, Xbox players. We are getting the message that an "update is needed but can't get it right now"
---
An hour of double. Yes. 
---
A developer by the name of Peanits said they had a fix coming shortly. 
---
You should apply for a position at BHVR since you clearly have a knack for fixing unexpected issues.
---
&gt;Tea bagging in this game is like the N-word
---
Camping fucking scumbag, I'm gonna press the gamer button! üòÇ

---
Definitely not entitled to escape. Still nothing worse than looping the killer the entire game and dying to noed or rancor though.
---
I don‚Äôt even care about the double BP, I just wanna play the game :(
---
thats the point thought it would be funnier if it was the opposite and more true to most games.
---
Kek powerful for not jumping in the Hatch.
---
Ever since the Hatch closing became a thing, bming at the hatch is one of the riskiest things you could do as it could lead to you basically screwing yourself over
---
Ehhh, I don‚Äôt think it really NEEDS a Buff. I find that even if they cleanse the wrong totem first, at least one Survivor will go and cleanse one of the two later on.
---
and you will. 
---
Patience is a virtue.
---
I haven't seen a toxic killer to constitute that. However i have had few Billy matches where the dude camped me on a hook. Still i understand your explanation and agree.
---
Isn't Dying Light that zombie parkour game? Or am I thinking of something else?
---
He‚Äôs a more notable threat, but he could do with one or two more changes, namely how much OoO and Spine Chill can neuter him
---
Yep.
---
Indeed
---
Mouse 1, the default attack, as opposed to say using the killers other ability(if it has one).
---
&gt;Can you read?
---
Thank you for caring about my reading comprehension, sending hugs and kisses as well.
---
&gt;i never said anything about the add ons.
---
Maybe next time you should. Cause you didnt put it in your title or in Tier list. 
---
Food for thought.
---
Killers aren‚Äôt mad at tbaggers, they‚Äôre upset that there‚Äôs no killer mechanic that lets them tbag.
---
I've seen it happen before, would be best just not to use them cuz devs might ban you  before fixing it :/
---
Yeah you‚Äôd be surprised how hard it is to see through all the fire/smoke/warping, plus you have the crackling to mask your footsteps/breathe.
---
Works a lot better with Urban Evasion though since you don‚Äôt need to stand up.
---
Waaahhh. I'm entitled to compensation. Go outside kids.
---
Someone didn‚Äôt read Patch Notes
---
I come across killers like that sadly too often. Just the other day I had a huntress who decided to camp and tunnel me no matter what. She would face camp and hit me on the hook repeatedly and shake her head at me. Had no idea what I did lol but you bet your ass I tbagged her every time I saw her after that. Didn't even care if I lived at that point. Game wasn't fun anymore.
---
Slug their altruistic asses off, unless there is one gen left and you know it will be done soon
---
Mouse1, left clicking. In this case it means Legion didn't use their power and just left-clicked all the survivors down with NOED.
---
Yeah thats it. Bit confused with this post too lol
---
And then the old guy says ‚Äúit‚Äôs less than worthless‚Äù
---
Which is true
---
Peanits said there won't be any compensation. (He's a Dev if anyone isn't aware)
---
I didn't even know she could blink behind the gate...
---
Thank you for posting.
---
Still think hooked or down survivors shouldnt able to reveal him but these changes are already pretty huge so I have no real complaints
---
Tuesday
---
Thank you! Hope they fix it soon. I hate waiting even more.
---
Dying light = dead daylight. Its a pun and i thought it was funny
---
I remember a game late at night, and a shack was in the far corner of the map. Everything was quiet. Then as soon as I stepped into the door, I heard Michael‚Äôs chase music blast and he was staring right at me. He was actually AFK, but it gave me a heart attack.
---
Change mine too
---
Killers, be sure to run Devour Hope while farming for that sneaky five stack
---
They're not really the same since camping guarantees you a kill whereas tbagging doesn't guarantee that you will get chased by the killer. The intentions are also different since most people who tbag do it to piss off the killer rather than get chased, whereas most killers who camp do it to secure a kill rather than piss off the survivor. At the end of the day they both happen and we have to deal with them.
---
True true
---
r/oversaturatedcontent
---
Yea?
---
The new Bunny Feng has arrived
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDBzDkJDJW4
---
Ever since the new update though theres a great impetus to do dull totems. In addition you can almost always find it via a cursory search after the exit gates are powered. NOED dosen't reward the killer for failing to do gens, they sacrifice a perk slot in order to get a power boost in the late game. It's very easily counterable regardless.
---
Bloodlust I've never felt was a BS mechanic because it gets removed upon pallet break and LOS break. If you're allowing the killer to get high tiers of bloodlust then you aren't utilizing the chase mechanics to the fullest and therefore you get downed.
---
Gen Rushing is literally the survivors objective, and if they get done fast that's because the survivors were good and you weren't able to pressure them enough. Balance issues with killer aside at it's core there is nothing bad or unfair about gen rushing. The frustration felt from it comes from the realization that you are losing and not from anything intrinsically wrong with the act.
---
Anybody who thinks wraith is easy to play and do well with is no higher than rank 15 survivor üòÇ Wraith is very easy to see coming if you‚Äôre paying attention and he suffers from being a basic M1 killer possibly the most as he‚Äôs very easy to loop.
---
They said they'd pick two, but i'm not sure if it'll be one of each.
---
She wasn‚Äôt running NOED/Insidious and she let you guys go. What exactly is the issue?
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs an overpowered ‚Äúexploit‚Äù or glitch, you could clearly hear her Terror Radius so why not go to the other gate? 
---
Even if a Nurse were to do this seriously as an end-game Strat, she‚Äôd realistically only catch one of you. Plus it‚Äôs a waste of her own time to be just sitting there instead of tracking you all down/alternating between the 2 Gates.
---
Dude, Where's My Bloodweb?...
---
First game I with the double bp, the killer brought a mori
---
I play on PC and Xbox and it‚Äôs alarming how much more DC-happy PC players are.
---
Mou daijobu desu!
---
Thanks for the response. Apparently I offended the rest of the community by asking my question. Not sure why my comment has been getting downvoted.
---
The terminator or the jeepers creepers main villains for killer and then like John Connor and then trish and Darry for the survivors would be pretty cool
---
Jesus chill out I was just asking if it was allowed and NOED and Insidious are allowed so I why would I complain about that wtf? Also she didn't let us go Nea saved us.
---
Why would using items and addons be toxic? Lmao.
---
It's too bad only two of them will be used.
---
There are so many cool designs that have been submitted that have clearly had a ton of thought and effort put into them, but most of them will be completely forgotten and all that effort rendered utterly pointless in about a month.
---
Still, I love that they're having this event. It's very thoughtful and nice of BHVR to give members of the community a chance to put their personal creativity and artistic talent into the game.
---
Platform: Xbox One
---
Playing against The Hag yesterday and her traps, when set on the basement stairs, survivors were being trapped inside of them, overlapping. Couldn't move.
---
It seemed that the killer was aware of the bug and exploited it.
---
it's the Chain from Furi
---
I'm going to be gone all weekend this was the only time I could play :(
---
Apparently hatch closing takes priority over jumping in hatch. You can't jump in hatch if killer is currently closing it
---
I mean, you gotta think like a survivor to get them.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was edgy to not take internet bullshit personally.
---
Look behind you when you runnn :(
---
last week, most played is nea
---
Killer could've got her but didn't
---
Been playing at rank 1 killer since the game was released, and been playing since beta.
---
Something tells me you don't play at red ranks as often as I do.
---
play hangsman's trick, it's really funny how sabo squads dc when you use it against them
---
If you watch carefully the hatch was open long before the spirit actually got there.
---
She phased to it already open meaning the Kate was pretty much bming on Hatch
---
This. My only complaint because there's that broken sword sound effect when she summons it. It's gotta be a metal blade of some sort.
---
Beyond that, it's fucking terrifying badass
---
Same and I've been playing since the start xD
---
On vigil: Even though a perk reducing status effect time would be interesting, it shouldn't recover exauhstion while running, that was the whole issue of "the dark times" loops would become infinite and that's not fair at all.
---
On distortion: this perk already counters a lot of perks. (Nurse's, BBQ, any detection add-ons for a killer.) Simply giving it more charges would be plenty and an acceptable buff. Hex perks are all glass cannons anyway, TOTH is any hex' saving grace. There's no need to counter it, the counter to hex perks are destroying them.
---
I wish, all I have is iron grasp since all my killers are very unleveled. Barely any teachables on most even though I've got nearly all of them
---
Survivors have no right to complain about NOED. It only affect babysurvivors who don't cleanse totem. Your playstyle chooses to make that perk function. You literally do it to yourselves.
---
The community just acts weird sometimes so don't mind that. I get downvoted for the most stupid things anyways better get your bloodpoints while the event is going on so you could level up your killers fast.
---
I'm not sure I was on Xbox. The hit boxes looked fine on my end.
---
[Here's one of my first ever screenshots.](https://i.imgur.com/qwIdH6Y.jpg) Probably one of the coolest looking glitches I've seen in this game.
---
K, I'm just gonna wait.
---
Thanks. And yah, that's what I was thinking. I currently only have the teachables from Bubba, Hag and Spirit so I was looking forward to grinding out a few more killers this weekend
---
Ah, I‚Äôm on PC so idk if Xbox does something different. But often times on PC the killers perspective is fine but the survivors are in a waking nightmare of rubber banding and being hit from 15 feet away
---
use your time during the event to get as much points as you can and spend them so you are prepared for the situations like that
---
it's mainly due to the narrative spun around that killers have no control over matches whatsoever and anything that has gone wrong is literally all due to the survivors. I've said this many times myself and is personally why I prefer killer more right now on console because I can dictate how the game will be whether I win or lose. Whereas like 2/3rds of my survivor matches consist of facecamping killers and unengaging matches through and through.
---
Good to know
---
Yeah, he's just bad. But his mechanics are easy and playstyle is the most basic you can get. Not saying wraith is good by any means, he's terrible I don't see why you would play him PAST rank 15
---
So this is where each side recites the popular perks? Like adrenaline, dead hard, Mom, etc...
---
Not that I'm denying what you are saying. But great solo survivors are better than decent sfw survivors.
---
In the edit I made in the original post, I took into account your argument. Now, are you done belittling every little thing because someone mentioned not sucking off the survivors of the game.
---
For killer if you genuinely want to help, make sure everyone gets 2x hooks, let killer work on gen for a bit, make sure they use their power for points ( spirit), gens/pallets give same category.  And let killer get slug hits to get points and you guys will get your healing points, make sure you get your safety points before next hook killer should be playing musical chairs to avoid safe hook loss.
---
Nea should've been goblin
---
would love to see her head rotating to the different masks when she twitches in game! great skin concept
---
yea
---
Yeesssss!!!! Someone who's able to needs to make the clown with this cosmetic and enter it into the contest please and thank you!
---
Have you seen No0b3's  drift king video? xD
---
Pretty much him doing this the entire video lol.
---
This one dude tbagged me last night after every pallet drop and any chance he could get. I was playing leatherface and managed to chainsaw his ass right before he made it to the exit. He had the nerve to call me ‚ÄúGandalf at the gates‚Äù after the match. I just said I was returning the favor for the BMing all game. He said fair enough. 10/10 would gatekeep again.
---
But isn't that a bit like saying, I should buy the new FIFA because why aren't I giving it a shot? I know I don't like football games. They're not for me. I'm not excited by them, they're not what I want to play. 
---
There are lots of things I know I'm not interested in. I don't have to TRY things I'm confident that I won't or don't like just to prove that. Life's too short.
---
If someone played killer for even 5 minutes and didn't like it, so stuck to survivor - good? They're still getting enjoyment from the game, they don't have to be even-handed in how they choose to spend their free time like it's a charity.
---
Thanks bro
---
If you use range addons then the 7 seconds are over right before you need to hit them.
---
Jumpscare.mp4
---
That was a great video for the first twenty seconds or so. Then you panted as hard as you could on the microphone for another twenty seconds.
---
I love this
---
same.
---
That‚Äôs hyperventilating for you. It makes breathing uncontrollable.  I was trying to laugh but the air wasn‚Äôt in my lungs.
---
I uninstalled and now I can‚Äôt reinstall on Xbox, I‚Äôm sad
---
I go away on holiday for a couple weeks tomorrow. Please just give me a few hours of double bp :‚Äô(
---
He has the same build and everything! 
---
[Anton Ego](https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Anton_Ego)
---
that was the first thing I tried and now I'm gonna miss the event completely AND there is no compensation
---
That's the best thing I've ever seen in my life
---
What did you do on set?
---
It has been 47 minutes since the event started.
---
Ohhhh, thx
---
They may extend the event
---
What about characters?  Could the lobby be increased to showcase those skins we buy?  it does not need to run at a high frame rate.
---
You're 48 minutes late :P.
---
I can already feel the long waiting times as killer.
---
Upvoting for more to see. I play in Ps4 and trying to bridge that gap that separates the players
---
This is quality.
---
Fine I got like 32 saved, but y'all better not DC.
---
It's always extremely morally confusing when a scummy killer gives the last person hatch. Like, you're a prick but I GUESS you're not all bad?
---
Had this happen this morning against The Legion. Right as the match started, 2 DC'd, and I literally cleansed every totem, and got 4 gens repaired. I have no clue what the other guy was doing. Eventually the other guy got hooked, and on my way to save him, he tried to get off by himself, and died before I could save him. Legion shut the hatch, and we ran to the gates together, and he let me escape. I was going to give him the kill cause I felt bad for the other 2 turds DC'ing on him. He messaged me later saying he let me live cause I made him laugh (I kept pointing at him everytime he would get close to me.) One of the funnest experiences in this game yet.
---
Yeah
---
Ok, but is teabagging ok if you are using it say hello to another survivor?
---
Or a crouched pig you thought was a survivor
---
Yea yesterday I was playing as trapper and two players DC‚Äôd, so I let the other two survivors farm generators and then my wifi went down :(. I like to think they got plenty of points
---
I hate this shit. I don't understand why people DC. It's irritating.
---
I think the game is in a very balanced state rn
---
(Excluding some bullshit like Nurse and MOM)
---
I‚Äôm headed to bed. Hopefully it‚Äôll be back up when I get up. I was really looking forward to playing this weekend.
---
please fix matchmaking for surviviors on ps4 , i found a match within seconds as killer but takes so long to find a match as survivor, there alot of others on ps4 that have the same issue
---
Everyone is affected. You‚Äôll be able to reinstall once it‚Äôs fixed...but no one knows how long it‚Äôs gonna take. We‚Äôre missing double blood points right now.
---
I am sorry for responding to your arguments with arguments of my own, I did not realize it would make you feel belittled. I play both sides and I suck off neither.
---
We need this!
---
if it's 4 man swf with no mither, tennacity, flip flop and sabotage then it's so freaking annoying
---
Some people dont give a shit about BP and just want to play the game regardless of events. This person is probably just crazy tunneler all the time.
---
I also enjoy survivors that run into me.
---
I'm sure they did! I can't stand people DC'ing. It's like throwing a cry baby fit cause they didn't get their way.
---
Billy is alright he can still be looped as  hell.
---
Bloodlust is needed for catching infinites
---
Male,12,Xbox,killer
---
Just shove it down the Survivors mouth while they squirm.
---
Either that or shove it ^down ^^their ^^^ass...
---
This killer will now be B+ tear
---
This is awesome, I love it
---
By the way, is this an old version of dbd? This does not look recent
---
Even then, it's still a frustrating and unnecessary mechanic.
---
There are no real reasons that mashing a button needs to be there for second phase.
---
Nobody said the bad Survivors are OP
---
Don't forget lery's offering
---
Yeah, I captured this clip like one year ago.
---
Fair point, although I honestly don't think the resolution is that bad, and seeing how much improvement they've made with game stability over the last few months on console, I'm pretty happy with what they're putting effort into.
---
i wish i could have done a better job placing the  glasses but meh 
---
i think i did a pretty good job
---
I did this while playing the Bing Bong Boi. Imagine that, disconnecting to the Bing Bong Boi.
---
Man its in the rules not to self promo here. People still do it why?!
---
she's also 500 years old
---
They DC for everything.
---
You can use the Everyone hears the bell add-on + ghost for same effect for cheaper.  Just spam the bell, and they ignore it after the first 30 seconds.
---
Its good, i recomend replaceing dark sense with bond, pharmacy or selfcare.
---
If all fall at one hit, then the first hooking of the game should be fast, and with that you have already occupied them while you hook another far away
---
i made em a little transparent and placed em on the tier 1 icon 
---
ooof on my part
---
They did put on a Survivor Pudding though.
---
I don't have any of thoseüò≠
---
If you hyperventilate for over 45 seconds because you had a spoop in a video game, you're physically unwell. FYI.
---
Replace it with BT.
---
Dont use selfishcare, learn to play without it homie.
---
Lmao, so true.
---
Also, lets be mindful that some people just want to play the fucking game. Dont put down killer nor survivor who just wants to actually play and not farm. We always get abused during events and double BP because farming is boring I loaded up the game to actually play.
---
Farming is the most consistent way, but it gets boring fast. Just play normally and make sure to use BBQ and a bloodpoint offering
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty new at the game (got it two days ago lol), was messing around with the killers getting a good feel of them when two people DC‚Äôd at the beginning of a match, Literally immediately. So I let the others farm points and my wifi went down. I don‚Äôt know if you earn points when the killer leaves but I like to hope so
---
Its an alternative to bond and pharmacy. I didnt say its first pick.
---
If you play this weekend, I highly recommend leveling up Claudette to get self care. Just a suggestion!
---
Leave the perks alone for a minute , change your camera haha
---
I recommend a new camera üòÅ
---
I wanna walk around stabbing people as a sock monster yes!
---
Looking at what you have as options I say you picked the best ones.. you should work on getting balanced landing from nea or deadhard from David those are better exhaustion perks.. sprint  burst is just annoying because you literally have to always save it.
---
Lmao my bad, those glasses on black should be looking nice
---
That happened to me sometimes. Couldn't walk through them and eventually a wall appeared in their place.
---
It's not up for everyone yet?
---
SWF aren't that ridiculous in fact they have a pretty poor survival rate. If anything SWF makes it a little more balanced otherwise the game is in tipped to the killer. A lot of times its too easy as killer.
---
Dark sense is good if they're newer.. gives them a visual of the killer.. or pharmacy would be good just to always have a medkit.
---
Do you know when it‚Äôs gonna come back up? It‚Äôs been like 3 hours
---
Yes,  I have been for quite some time now. I have a nurse for a mother.  I‚Äôm aware of how sick I‚Äôve been since I was 5.  Not much I can do about that unfortunately.    Again. It only lasted that long because I was trying to laugh with no air in my lungs.
---
SWFs dont have that great of a success rate. If anything they help the balance between killer and survivor. You just dont want to have to try. And want the easier game of playing against Solos.
---
that would work better for someone like pennywise imo
---
Lets say you are playing vs a non SWF. You down the first guy, facecamp him till he DCs or just perishes after the full struggle. Meanwhile 1 survivor will come for the unhook, linger a bit to see if the killer is leaving. Another survivor will do the same... Both survivors might even spot eachother and feel like they can pull off the save in a teameffort. 
---
And then all off a sudden its 3v1 instead of 4v1 and maybe 2 gens popped and you are in total control of the game and can max points with easy and no stress...
---
Unless you are playing vs a SWF facecamping pays off immensely unfortunately... sad truth.
---
Last I heard was ‚Äúshortly‚Äù, but that was two hours ago. LET ME IN. LET ME INNNNNN
---
Vaulting back over the pallet towards the husk has never ever worked out in the survivors favor, and yet, survivors be like "maybe this time it'll work!"
---
I actually screamed the first time this happened to me.  My neighbors called the police because they thought I was hurting my wife.
---
I was just shocked I didn't see any other posts, I grind the events when they come out so I wanted to let others know c:
---
Fake, Nurses never give that shit away.
---
It is always a Billy, Myers or Piggy that seems friendly enough to grant mercy of the hatch to you.
---
Unfortunately can confirm the long ass wait times
---
Right? I want to hate you but I see you have the capacity to be cool.
---
UGH ME TOOOOOOO wtffffff
---
What happend to big boi wraith?
---
This looks like your perks are trying to run away.
---
I loved that description and that sword, although I think that something like this would be better suited for The Wraith, this is a wonderful skin and I would love to see it added to the game!
---
I'll give any camper a good ole' nard-slappin'-grounds at the exit gate. Otherwise, I just keep that shit to myself
---
Same problem
---
Something that would help immensely is removing perk tiers. A lot of the perks now have been changed so that they have small differences in tiers.
---
Something else they could do is cut the price of everything by 1/3 or half. There's loads of characters and perks now and if they truly intend to support this game for at least 5 more years then we'll continue to get many more as the years go by.
---
- Legion of angsty teens
---
For their own benefit. I hate going against guys like this. Like I know they see you chasing them. I had a guy hit me once last night and I chased him like this and he still ignored me for the rehook.
---
No way....Shirtless Myers first!!!!!!
---
I have to laugh if you honestly think Ghostface wouldn't have a twinks body under his robes
---
It should be up really soon, I checked both console and pc and its active for me, sorry it hasn't come for you yet :(
---
oh
---
I can't stand killers like this. Gotta ruin everyone else's playtime cause they 1.) Can't get a kill any other way or 2.) They like to troll
---
Hopefully it gets extended.
---
Ghost face,his new buff makes him literally insane
---
I ignore the prestiged ones with flashlights because I know they will loop me for 5 gens.
---
Nothing, GFs whooshing is quieter and reaches less distance
---
That must be why the biggest streamers make fun of it all the time and why most of the playerbase with thousands of hours see it as one of the worst perks in the game. That must ALSO be why [the use of Urban decreases as rank increases](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/928/2YVQMEWUS0KN.jpg).
---
I might be a dick, but I'm not wrong.
---
I mean, is he worse than myers? The only thing myers is better at is just snowballing with tier 3, but I guess some can argue that's myers most powerful tool
---
Sometimes, people just really don't like that one survivor, and it's not about bloodpoints or multiple hooks at that point
---
Oooh okay.
---
thanks
---
I like Myers but I'm terrible at him.  Partially because I don't have a lot of perks atm.
---
It‚Äôs actually not a bad build if you don‚Äôt have a lot of teachables. Only thing I‚Äôd do is switch out Dark Sense for Borrowed Time. Adrenaline/Sprint Burst/Borrowed Time/Decisive Strike is a pretty common build in the higher ranks, though they usually use something like Dead Hard or Balanced Landing instead of Sprint Burst. But Sprint Burst is still really good and if it‚Äôs the only Exhaustion perk you have than use it.
---
Then level them up. I dont play killers I dont have perks for unless it's a daily. I usually wont play a killer for the first time until they are about lvl 30-35
---
Most people teabag at the exit gate though
---
hes been hitting the gym recently
---
They already said that they can‚Äôt do a killer like that because it would be hard to balance with swf unfortunately
---
Dont be that person that chases the hurt one if you run back to the hook after a rescue.
---
I mean the survivor had mettle of man too
---
Ghost face is a bottom
---
Bruh moment
---
had a guy call me a camping noob because i was trying to find a downed guy hiding in grass lol
---
Exactly. Apprechiate the attempt that you tried bodyblocking.
---
With a Bucket of Chicken perk too ‚Ä¶ I'd take the entire set of Devil's Rejects. That would be awesome.
---
Please...stop...why wont this sub just stop with the shirtless characters.
---
Probably your monitor or TV is (or is configured to work at) 60hz
---
What kind of monitor do you have? If the refresh rate of your monitor is only 60Hz, then your frames will always be capped at 60 FPS.
---
Just happened to me. Played against a nurse who barely did anything only to get downed by noed and hooked in the basement. FeelsBadMan
---
I actually avoided playing her for a long time-she seemed really bland and weak imo. But I started playing her to get the achievements and learned how fun she could be! Now she's basically my main lol
---
I would be the happiest if they change something about the grind, it's horrible for new players like us
---
Feng Main = Big Brain. Thats it.
---
Take what you can.  Give nothing back.
---
Depends whose leaving all the scratch marks I‚Äôm following.
---
Chasing the hurt one is sometimes the smart play.
---
Just did that a few minutes ago, yaay
---
Meyers and ghost face yaoi on r/dbdgonewild?
---
S H I R T L E S S  G H O S T F A C E  Y A A S S S Ss s s s s-fades out of existence-
---
Hot take: any and ALL lag a survivor experience's is the fault of the survivor for not checking their ping in the lobby
---
Totally thought that said drowned for a second and thought "Woahhh dead by daylight forum starting to take a turn" üëÄ
---
I'm a low leval getting those perks to teachable will take along timd
---
Sounds about right, smh. If only they knew how much they don‚Äôt even understand about the game they would feel pretty silly.
---
no its 144, its so weird
---
Thank you, kind sir!
---
no its 144
---
I think that of the center of your camera is able to look at Meyers, you should still be able to detect him
---
because it hurts so good
---
looks like legacy Laurie
---
This is every event.
---
Its just too much man...ive seen things that this trend has produced that i can unsee. Things like r/dbdgonewild
---
Discordance, surveillance, and the second two are optional but I'd suggest ruin and deer stalker. 
---
Discordance: unless they're the smart survivors that know the proper way to gen rush, 9 times out of ten they'll double up on gens, so take down one of them and slug at one gen, then go to the other gen affected by discordance. You've effectively taken the time away from working on the first gen because they're trying to be altruistic, while keeping the other people on the other gen busy because they're getting chased. 
---
Ruin: I mean the first part isn't as possible without the game being slowed.
---
Surveillance: you'll know whether they're taking the slug bait or powering through the gen then going for their friend
---
Deer stalker: again let's all the above be possible, and guarantees a 4k if you get to that point.
---
Once you get someone hooked, then they get unhooked and go back to do gens, repeat the process. For me this works best are characters that can one shot like Billy, leatherface, Myers, or plague, and then nurse because...well she's nurse
---
Noed I feel is a necessary perk but an unfun one for both killer and survivor. Like I can run a killer around a whole game with them not getting even 1 hit on me. Then when the last generator pops the killer gets his first hit in the game and it's noed. It's such a big crutch but also on some killers a necessity.
---
Fingers crossed! ü§û
---
Dude if they put Baby Firefly in this game I would legit become a killer main, shes one of my all time favorite horror characters
---
I don't think they'll actually increase bloodpoint gains. It encourages people to play more dbd although they're tired of doing so
---
I think the closest they ever got to it is adding bbq in the shrine
---
i bet ghostface is a hot twink
---
Hmm. Make sure vsync is turned off in the game settings. Also, modify the gameusersettings file in a text editor. Make sure vsync is set to "false." And make sure the frame limit is set to something high like 300 or 144 to be exact.
---
No clue. The last time something like this happens, it took them quite a while. I‚Äôm headed to bed and am hoping when I wake up it‚Äôll be fixed.
---
hopefully it gets extended to the 19th
---
Says some loser scrolling through reddit to complain to people telling them to do something instead of doing something productive himself.
---
i knew it would be a mistake posting this
---
Nerf grinding, too op, pls.
---
i wish it was on live servers because I've been switching between PTB and live 3 times now and i want to try it
---
That's when you send the killer a thank you.
---
What's going on with Xbox players not getting double blood points? Xbox live down I'm guessing? I'm planning on playing later tonight
---
You‚Äôre right, literally every guy that has ever been Ghostface in the movies was a twink
---
Rob just dropped the trailer for 3 From Hell a few days ago ‚Ä¶ great tie in with the movie to add them all. They'd be perfect for the entity. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQxaGpJNfyA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQxaGpJNfyA)
---
It really annoys me when a killer who barely did anything the entire match ends up getting a 3k or 4k because of noed
---
Come on man
---
...so far
---
Ghostface is clearly a power bottom twink, not a real man like Myers.
---
Thanks OP and u/WickedHardcorg for the great advise. My first Double BP event, and these pointers are great!
---
It's over Billy, I have the high ground.
---
Nice job. Love it.
---
Then filter, if possible, the posts or ignore th√™m.

secure 1 hook

just to get that bbq 4 stack
---
then just down, break gen+Pallets
---
and move on to the next one
---
Yeah same. Killers like wraith and Freddy need it to get kills during a game from rank 1 to 8 which shows some killers desperately need buffs.
---
It's not. What he's saying is that killers can't use that as an excuse for camping. They do it regardless. Although honestly, at higher ranks, they don't, but it's replaced by spirits, billies and nurses, which is arguably worse, because two of them have pretty barebones counters, and billy is just billy
---
...? Shouldn‚Äôt the top be the bloodweb and not the shrine?? Noed is automatically available.
---
Now THIS is a REAL buff, thank god BHVR, you did it!
---
eyyyyyyyyyyy 
---
LOL
---
Since there's normally two of them ‚Ä¶ he/she's both.
---
Acting like you're better than the rest in a pretty dickish way is edgy though. There's a pretty fine line between not taking internet bullshit personally, and just straight up staring down your nose at others for not treating the world the same way you do, mr. hardened internet veteran
---
Teabagging's a dick move, and whether you let it influence you or not, doesn't make it less or more dickish when it's done with the intent of being a dick
---
Oh I'm well aware lol, I've been following 3 From Hell since he announced it. I even watched the teasers he was showing during his live shows last year. I'm so damn excited for this 3rd movie, I love the series so much already. They'd probably befriend the other killers that were psyched by the entity's offer of eternal killing lol
---
Something on their end, last we heard was that it would be resolved ‚Äúshortly‚Äù, but that was before double BP started.
---
Nice. Thanks for the links!
---
Do you even understand how often this shit happens. I take 5 steps and I hear the hook. What the hell do you want me to do? Ignore you and your wounded friend? You should be happy I'm gonna go after the healthy one and not just tunnel the wounded one. But nahhhhh let's expect the killer to let us win.
---
They fucked up and accidentally went to release the June 18th patch and Xbox servers are fucked up because Xbox have the new June 18th version on their server and now dbd have to revert back to the current version by putting a patch through Xbox again but Xbox have to verify everything so there‚Äôs a delay. This is what I‚Äôm guessing has happened as I‚Äôve seen this exact error and issue before in other games and has always been the issue. Some dude at dbd getting fired for giving Xbox the wrong release date lmao
---
I know enough about Japanese media to say with confidence that that is most definitely a penis.
---
Lol come on man.  Objectively you cannot claim the information available in a swf group is a huge advantage.  To pretend there isn't is impossible to take seriously.
---
ughhh i just want my double bloodpoints. i hope they extend it for xbox
---
I looked into it it's system wide they are working on it
---
You can‚Äôt , everyone on Xbox is having this problem for 6 hours alreDy. Well 6 hours in my case anyway.
---
GD... I wish you could've heard how grossly and annoyingly loud I just laughed while reading "twink's body"
---
Yeah but if the game is chasing me and desperately *wants* to be chased and/or is body blocking me, I may be inclined to be a little toxic in the moment and tunnel the player that was just unhooked.
---
Right I‚Äôm so freaking bummed right now.
---
Sad oink :c
---
Yeah. Every time you try to open the game it says you need to download an update, problem is the update doesn‚Äôt actually exist. BHVR said they are working on it and it‚Äôll be resolved ‚Äúshortly‚Äù, but who knows how long it will take. It‚Äôs been two hours since they said it‚Äôll be fixed shortly.
---
It looks like fun time and as a console player myself, I wish I could experience it just once.

Theres like 15 recent topics asking about this though...
---
Damn, Thanks for telling me though.
---
110% you're a whiner. A lot of times that I end up circling hooks like this is when the survivors have proven they will farm them off hook. Or if I'm having a truly bad game and the other survivors are being cocky. Again I dont understand what you expect killers to do. You get that we are trying to win as well right?
---
Jeez lmao
---
Really? I see OoO all the times at the higher ranks (usually from 5 through 1), I assume because survivors at these ranks are very confident in their abilities.

Get a ps4 üò¨
---
That building let alone is an insane god loop. You could‚Äôve looped her for the remainder of haunted grounds. But instead you went for the hole which staggers you by falling which basically made your sprint burst pointless. So what I would‚Äôve done is ran downstairs to find a window or pallet because there‚Äôs always a pallet or window downstairs instead of run outside in the open to just run in a circle.
---
Me too but it‚Äôs a Friday and tbh if the patch isn‚Äôt rolled out in the next hour it won‚Äôt be fixed till tomorrow and they won‚Äôt extend or compensate as Xbox is a minority in player base. If it happened on pc or ps4 they‚Äôd get compensation as that‚Äôs where most players are.
---
Dont do that to Keanu.
---
All i see on your profile is this post and bunch on pokemon go shit. Explain how you trolled everyone
---
I typically don't have issues on console until I get below rank 10. Then, it takes forever. On PC I rarely have this issue at lower ranks. Dedicated servers are almost here. That should fix the issue somewhat.
---
If you're doing 0 terror radius Michael, you gotta add in Monitor and Abuse in there.
---
Lol have you read the other comments?  There are a lot of good points about solo queue being broken with the ability to take out every totem.  Also calling put survivors for not cleansing dulls as babies but not the killer who brought the get out of jail free crutch for getting rekt protecting objectives is very hypocritical.  You can't have it both ways.
---
No problem, hopefully we hear something soon but my guess won‚Äôt be fixed til tomorrrow.
---
I saw a series earlier that had a character on the cover. He looked a lot like Adam Francis, with the coat and hair. I forgot the name.
---
Was just about to say the same thing. ü§£
---
Unpopular opinion: I don't think the bloodpoint grind is that bad. I 've played since about November of last year and have most characters maxed or maxed to the point I want them to be (e.g.  up to 30-40 where I needed to get to get what I consider to be to unlock the good teachable perks).
---
That took a few hundred hours of gameplay which seems like a good chunk without being miserable.  The only time I felt particularly underpowered was in the first couple of dozen of hours and even them Meg/Claudette feel decent.  Killers certainly feel much worse when that low, but even then things were doable.
---
I think he‚Äôs trying to take credit for this glitch üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
A cool power could be like, using a higher sense of smell too. You slow down and sniff the air and get like a faint trail to where the closest survivor is, sorta like scratch marks that you could trigger as a power
---
Does anyone know if this is intentional or not. I tried looking it up but haven't seen anything on it. If you fail a hook sabo skill check, the progress bar won't move for about 10 seconds. After that, you can finish the sabo.
---
On xbox the update hasn‚Äôt come out so no one can play so i went into looking for groups and started telling people to uninstall to fix it and people were doing it and getting pissed so i took it one step further and told people to factory reset their xbox and they did and now looking for groups is chaos üòÇ bunch of people reporting me, others helping troll it‚Äôs great
---
First guy I find (Ash) tries to immediately 360 me around a gen and I just bonked him on the head. He ran away and juked me so I kicked the gen and wandered vaguely in the direction he went. Legit walked into the next room and I heard him healing around a box. Came around and hit him in one nice neat motion and he DCed before hitting the ground. Must have had a friend cus another also immediately DCed. I found the other two and we all spent a good 10 minutes farming then I let them both leave. Some killers are nice.
---
Smh big same. I was tryna grind for ghostface release üòî
---
Wow. Your mother must be so proud of you.
---
Strong disagree there, finding hatch is most definitely the most effective way to escape as the last survivor.
---
Yasss!!! Wraith's face makes this for me!!!
---
If you're on a base PS4. then that's how it is. They're working on performance issues.
---
Lol you all really like to pick and choose what you argue against while ignoring the big picture. No ones pissing on your leg. Someone is pressing a button to squat their character repeatedly in a video game and you‚Äôre all pitching a fit over it. I‚Äôm not even acting superior. If someone has fun teabagging, good for them. Why the fuck does that bother you so much? It‚Äôs not even real. It‚Äôs like someone ‚Äúlikings your shit on Facebook.
---
If someone‚Äôs slinging racial epithets and telling you to kill yourself, that‚Äôs one thing. But they are literally spamming crouch in a video game and you‚Äôre acting like they‚Äôve defiled your mother.
---
If killers are babies for running NOED, then survivors are babies for using DS and BT because they aren't confident in not being hit.
---
Do you see how stupid your logic is yet? Or is your head just that far up your ass?
---
Eww Fornite fanboys.
---
Hey you said shortly a couple hours ago, any ETA for the fix?
---
You underestimate my lunge hitbox!
---
Reducing the perk grind is a good thing, but think a bit about the whole 1/2 or 1/3 prices on everythign in the blood web, that means kilelrs will bring rare/hard addons more often and survivors will also bring insta heals, powerful toolboxes and flashlights more often, its goignt o cause everyone to play even more agressively.
---
What is the music and "to be continued" a reference to?

Wow epic troll. I‚Äôm sure all your friends will be laughing with you when you tell this about this epic moment.

Is that what we call wraith?
---
Thats dope!

---
Bruh get that shit outta here
---
Lol!  DS post rework is designed solely to punish baby killers who camp and tunnel off hook.  It literally only functions against babykillers it has no effect otherwise.  You couldn't be any further off.  Baby killer who needs NOED to get a kill confirmed in the wild of reddit.
---
so annoying when the timer is more than halfway and they just slug and wait the timer out, just kill me already.
---
run
---
y e s
---
Right? Lol let‚Äôs say my palms were sweaty with mom‚Äôs spaghetti that whole time
---
You lose me on the equalizer stuff, you don't need Discord to even the odds with killers, it's not like you're handicapped without it. It's not so much the success rate that makes these matches less fun, it's just that voice comm undermines a ton of perks and mechanics and makes stealth killer's lives harder.
---
No problem I‚Äôve just seen so many people saying they can‚Äôt reinstall so just trying to save some people while there‚Äôs still time üòÇ
---
*Platform:* PC  
---
*Type of bug:* Gamebreaking  
---
*Description:* Killers are able to hijack the game by picking you up and dropping you just as the EGC timer runs out.  
---
*Steps to reproduce:* See description.  
---
*Expected result:* The last survivor is stuck in place, and cannot bleed out to end the match.  
---
*Actual result:* See expected result.  
---
*Reproduction rate:* Timing is key, but it works fairly consistently.
---
OH SHIT
---
ok

It's a known [meme.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yes-roundabout-to-be-continued)
---
In my opinion, if you have a red ping bar in the lobby and join anyway, that‚Äôs on you. I can‚Äôt force you to join, nor should you want to. I will just down and hook yah
---
This is exactly what I think, too. I think the game is that Killers kind of *should* have a leg up on Survivors and it should **not** be an even playing field. I view DbD the same way as how Friday the 13th: The Game is. Counselors are not supposed to survive. Jason is supposed to win, and Counselors are supposed to die. The ones who escape are the lucky ones.
---
we need Steve Harrington as a survivor
---
Maintenance
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse and Whispers are imo the most important thing on EW1 Michael. M&amp;A because...Well that's obvious. But also Whispers because the Mirror has an exact range of 32m. Just like Whispers. Meaning Whispers will always tell you when it's actually useful to use your wallhack. Which will actually save you lots of time as you don't want to stay around stalking each 10 seconds just because there MIGHT be a Survivor around.
---
But I must agree, I've played EW1 Michael with M&amp;A, Whispers, Third Seal and Sloppy on the Game, it's absolutely hillarious.
---
they are working on Performance since the game came out on ps4, dont expect a fix in next couple months ^^

Are you an imbecile?

This is an actual exploit. I am currently sitting in a match where this has happened.  
---
The EGC timer has disappeared, I cannot move, and I am unable to bleed out. The match cannot end. It's a hijack.
---
It keeps telling me to update my game when there is no update
---
For Survivors that do NOT want to farm: As someone who plays friendly Killer a lot, and who loves being matched up with one, I understand your point completely! You do NOT have to participate in farming. But:
---
If you play Survivor and the Killer is farming, try to communicate that to them. Maybe shake your head at them and just do the objectives, then leave. You might get them to change their mind about it. If they decide they won't bother you, don't be salty about it, just do your thing and leave. Don't abuse the Killer's decision in order to get as many BP as you can while leaving them with none extra.
---
There's some people out there denying a friendly Killer their BP while cleansing totems, going through chests, and maybe even teabagging/pointing at the Killer, running away and looping them around... Don't Be That Guy. It makes you look stupid.
---
If you play Killer and Survivors don't want to farm, but you don't want to play a normal game either: sucks to be you, mate. Why waste time, just chase them around a bit. You can't force them to join.
---
I‚Äôve been wanting to play forever but this stupid thing is happening
---
It's a shitpost because of the dc part, I always use Kindred
---
I ‚Äúlol‚Äôd‚Äù at this funny ‚Äúmaymay‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôd say be mindful of your character. If I‚Äôm a killer, I don‚Äôt mind farming, but if I see 3 Jakes, I‚Äôm going to lose track on who I‚Äôve put on a hook how many times.
---
You need to put that in your OP, you didn‚Äôt say anything about ‚Äòdisappeared‚Äô and do you have any proof? You didn‚Äôt even post a video, who‚Äôs the imbecile here?

Jeepers! That sucks. Thanks for telling me anyways.

That was me when I got this gane 2 days ago lol, first thing I did was play killer for like, at least 15 rounds.

I see no god up here.....OTHER THAN ME

It's just that 9/10 killers will be running BBQ right now for the spicy x2 BP, well x3 with Bbq. And if entire teams are just... not letting the killer do that with 99ing hooks. It's really an asshole thing to do right now.

I'm aware. But when people start off as Freddy they're usually drawn to the block addons at first.

No, you don't. That's what OP said. By picking you up and dropping you just as the timer runs out, the entity won't get them.

u/thepowerofcutleries that must be a bug. I‚Äôve played killer with egc and was carrying a player when the timer ran out. The game forced me to drop him and the entity killed him. That‚Äôs how the game should function

Thanks! &lt;3
---
Then you die in four minutes. Whoa.
---
Stranger Things videogame I think, nothing to do with dbd
---
So much this. Let us obtain perks on a separate bloodweb or whatever.
---
Theres people who dont play everyday and are very casual. You need to play alot and divert all you BP to make 1 killer viable. If you want to play another killer the  tough luck cause you gotta invest alot of BP that will take you weeks to
---
acquire if dont play this game often.

---
My boy Jed ain't a daddy. delet this
---
He's myers on one person without the god lunge which is the best part of Evil Within 3.
---
Kindred should change to: while using kindred when another player is hooked you alone get those benefits for any other player who is hooked. That way it‚Äôs more of a selfish perk and benefits yourself instead just everyone else.
---
Yah I just like playing her for snipes, while she‚Äôs not the most OP I still think she‚Äôs the funnest to play lol
---
What do you mean pay monthly? I bought it before it was on game pass...also im not a fan of pc.
---
I mean Leatherface isn‚Äôt bad but he‚Äôs not Nurse, Spirit, Billy tier. 
---
He‚Äôs more of a if you‚Äôre good at killer you‚Äôll be good at him type of character. Only downside like all M1 killers is he doesn‚Äôt have full map pressure like you know Billy, Nurse and Spirit.
---
It would be nice, but considering how messed up auras were on the Ormond map (which has snow) I think other maps with weather might suffer the same way

What is happening? Can we get some background?
---
How many times do you actually hit multiple people with his chainsaw in one charge? Never. And that is supposed to be his niche. He needs a rework
---
Same. I enjoy a game where I need to grind things and getting everyone to at least level 40 honestly didn't take that long. I've found new life in the game by deciding to all perk, P3-50 everyone
---
Maybe. Think that's what they're doing to the map now. We'll just have to see if it works I guess
---
Is it a new monitor?
---
Yea
---
Hmm wait a little longer I‚Äôm good already, just got in my first match.
---
I‚Äôve nvr had any issue playing leather at all
---
Thats what double BP weekend is for
---
Before anything happens, don't get mad if all of this is completely ignored because some people just want to play the game
---
Rainbow 6 siege does horror better than dbd: change my mind
---
4 hours later... Anddddd it's still down. So much for double blood points.
---
All the sudden my Xbox just flipped out, I'ma just restart it
---
Any chance they'll extend it for xbox users?
---
[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/byohcx/trapper_left_me_to_the_entity_and_this_happened/), video evidence of the glitch OP is talking about.
---
That‚Äôs because people aren‚Äôt stupid and don‚Äôt group well some aren‚Äôt. 
---
His chainsaw is more like a 2-3 sec charge for an instadown on a survivor of course you have to be skilled to use him effectively and control him effectively. 
---
Why is this literally and argument? Are you just mad you don‚Äôt play with stupid people?
---
You guys are right it‚Äôs all preference. I guess I‚Äôm just a pc fanboy. You can plug in an Xbox controller so it plays just like Xbox, don‚Äôt have to pay 5$ a month forever just to play online, and usually support for the game is better on pc. But I like ps4 and Xbox too, just not as muchüòòüíª
---
Probably a daily quest wraith
---
The animation when opening a locker while using iron maiden is broken i guess.
---
Good thing I don't either. I have only disconnected once, and that was a pre-EGC game. The hag I was playing against went afk on the basement stairs, trapping me and one other dude down there.
---
Could you link it to me, please? I would love to include it in my original post.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve played a wraith who hasn‚Äôt played like that.
---
This looks like one of those randomizers, but for a meme
---
Just treat him like the most basic default M1 killer that sometimes gets to M2 but only really situationally.
---
Which, yeah, I guess that sort of makes him the worst killer without addons, doesn't it?
---
Definitely deserved. Any idiot that doesn't instantly take the hatch (especially against Spirit) is asking for it.
---
 My PS4 has been on repair for almost 2 weeks now.
---
Still not back.
---
Whoever slowed this down, I want to shoot you
---
Leatherface is fine 115 speed, instadown, solid combo with other perks what else you want OP?
---
So you were trapped against the locker? and couldn't do anything but open it?
---
I teabag to distract and buy remaining missing survivors some time if needed, or sometimes I need all the desperate boldness points I can get. As a killer, I walk straight up to them at the gate and start smacking. I don't get the dumbass killers who just stand waiting for them to leave. Seriously? You've been trying to smack them all game and there's some easy points. Lmao.
---
Oink oink, Saw=Pig=upvote
---
How did you time this?
---
At first in thought you being a cocky shit and then I realized she was using iri hatchets. Any huntress knows they‚Äôre broken as shit and are just bm to use.
---
DbD's Ghostface is one specific original character, Danny Johnson. A guy. And before you ask yeah he's a twink
---
Dont get the 5$ a month part still...
---
Nope. The killers objective is to kill the survivors. Them finishing gens is separate to that. NOED is a late game buff. It's like saying that any of the half dozen second chance perks survivors get are for survivors who failed their objective.
---
Coward
---
Rank reset brings all of the players wuth shitty habits to the surface, like all those earthworms that pop out of the ground after a storm.
---
Then you get downvoted to hell
---
I have a stop watch in my room. I like to know if I do well.
---
The cost of Xbox live or PS Plus
---
Me and the boys in 3 man games after first downed survivor dc.
---
You just need to know map layout the charge time to his saw and if you can pull it off. The trick is to be right in there back like Myers usually.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. and not that u asked but i recommend BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is the company still hasnt given us an update that shows the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not yet. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are.
---
Just gen perks. ruin, weasel pop, overcharge, surveillance. Other than that you have to have a killer who can pressure. But there's not a lot you can do besides going and challenging those gens. Sometimes this kind of stuff happens. especially against a swf who's goal is specifically to gen rush and nothing else
---
pretty much.

---
That just means there are more people playing survivor than killer, its not a bug there's just nobody to play with.
---
...a buff won‚Äôt change that. How would you even buff that? Make one charge last a whole minute or two? It‚Äôs just survivors being smart. 
---
Personally, I think he‚Äôs in a decent place. He‚Äôs not supposed to be top tier. The devs aren‚Äôt ever going to make him top tier either because a large proportion of leatherdaddy players face camp and getting a save with a face camping LF is next to impossible, even with borrowed time.
---
Seriously, her ass is wider than that barrel. How the hell?!?
---
Surveillance only helps with gens right?
---
Thats because it is unrewarding. There's a whole game mechanic (dull totems), based around one fuckin perk. Either rework it and make it more rewarding regardless of if there's noed, or make it so noed isn't the only perk that is killed by getting *every dull totem on the map* ffs.
---
All three of those devs?  My guess is cosmetics in DBD, Fortnite and Roblox (not sure what that game is).
---
There's always that asshole you gotta smack after hooking them cus they teabag at every pallet
---
Even without Camping he‚Äôs viable and good enough.
---
It should be fixed now. If you're still unable to launch the game, restarting your console should fix it.
---
They might extend it for everyone, they've done that in the past.
---
Yea , point is if yo u hook the dude any near a kicked gen theyll instantly go there, so youll know where the marked dude is
---
Right, $5 a month. And correct that‚Äôs a fantastic deal, being able to play all those games without having to shell out the full price. I hope they fix DBD on Xbox soon for you mate!
---
Yeah... that's a lie. The gens wouldn't have been done that quickly considering all the hooked survivors and survivors running for the unhook etc. Weird thing to lie about though.
---
It's not UNfair to include, since there are common ones that people will frequently run.  The less common ones, perhaps.
---
I saw it. I have edited the original post to include a link to the video.  Thank you very much!
---
I would love to see the spirit with a tetsubo
---
Xbox is glitched at the moment the devs are working on a fix just watch the reddit for now until it‚Äôs fixed
---
Yes I was thinking about this because I reached lvl 50 with clown without getting BBQ and devour hope  at all and got some trash perks like monstrous shrine, distressing and thrill of the hunt instead
---
At the very least survivors should be rewarded for it the same way killers are.
---
For once, a DC would be a perfectly acceptable response.
---
I do actually agree that Blood Warden is fine because of your reasons.
---
I just dont understand the sentiment of playing in a SWFs is a crutch and killers just insta dodge because they dont want a harder game. For me, when I play killer I welcome the challenge and playing survivor solo is just frustrating when you get someone who just crouches around and does nothing or overall just a bunch of potatoes.  Idk maybe I just like killer more than survivor but I like playing with my friends.
---
finally the spirit backlash is coming?
---
but teabagging in the exit gates doesn't let other survivors know where the exit gates are.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a farmer, it could mean they‚Äôre bad or simply made a mistake or gave up or any number of possibilities
---
Thanks I'm on now, see you in the fog.
---
Kindred is a very underrated perk.  Randoms know if the killer is camping, if someone else is saving you or they need to go for the save.
---
UPDATE: XBOX DBD NOW WORKING PROPERLY. NOW LETS GET DEM BLOODPOINTS.
---
Thank you! It seems to be working now, I appreicate that you replied.
---
I was just a PA on that one.
---
If he's not nurse tier then what's the point üò°üò°üò° ^^^/s
---
For those that are lazy signing out and in should work as well
---
What's the deal with all these evil wraith players? I hate it :(
---
Maybe they're just doing it for a quest...
---
..... Yeah? Like if you teabag me, you're getting camped. Plain and simple.
---
Beautiful artwork! Her face looks terrifying!
---
i swear some of y'all act like they haven't constantly adjusted the bloodweb since 2016 :x
---
Its very obi when people dont like it bc of personal preference or if they hate it bc its popular. Grow up boys.
---
This happened immediately after the game started so I had no idea it was Myers and I almost had a heart attack. Definitely the worst jump scare I've had.
---
If they spawn on ruin, and play well its gonna be a challenge for you. Sometimes bad rng is gonna screw you over
---
Holy shit been playing this game for so long and never realized this, thanks for the tip!
---
pig is better at that, i get consistant y(Oinks) on survivors by staying crouched and just yanking the off it by standing up, its harder to spot a crouched pig than like 10ft tall Myers, plus bear traps help early game.
---
So like, maybe he doesn't know the creator.
---
You probably should have mentioned it was clown lol Idk what it is but i swear he's the worst killer in terms of winning a game. Like yeah he shreds loops but for some reason gens get done so fast against him and there's nothing that can be done. Like wraith, trapper, bubba, doctor, they're all m1 115% killers just like clown, and yet they somehow have more map pressure than poor clown. I don't understand it but for some reason gens get done really fast against clown
---
They‚Äôve adjusted it once lmao, and made everything 1K cheaper.
---
Meanwhile they‚Äôve added tens of new characters and a bunch of new perks
---
Definitely not ^^
---
Mine stops for 5 seconds on PS4, noticed it last night, but if I fail it, I normally go hide because the killer will be there soon if they ain‚Äôt in a chase. But I was almost done and said fuck it and finished it and this happened. Also same thing with healing people, I start rubbing them but the bar isn‚Äôt moving and that‚Äôs from the start, I rubbed feng for 10 seconds before the bar started going up.
---
As killer. Play Doctor. Focus on getting 4 stacks on BBQ first. Spam shock therapy. Slug survivor's who are on final hook instead of killing them. Farming with a SWF will yield more BPs but that is assuming competent/nonselfish farmers. When farming you usually let them escape because that's the only way for them to get their 5k in survival category.
---
As survivor. Get BBQ. Play killer.

---
I cant believe people who play like this still play the game, whats the point?
---
He's the weakest in the game right now in my opinion. Sure he has an instadown, but he also never gets to use it against good survivors. Leatherface can be good, but so can Freddy, and the Trapper, but I'd still argue that they are the weakest three killers in the game with Leatherface being the weakest of the three. Freddy has to wait for the dream transition, but the stall he gets from his ability and the tracking he always has practical access to.
---
Couldn't you just decrease the frequency of rare items? You fix the blood point grind for perks by making it cheaper to get through a blood web and then you may still have to spend $100k+ bloodpoints just to see that ultra-rare item?
---
https://youtu.be/MiLtlP0opbw?t=320s
---
Exact same situation
---
Someone suggested iron will should work if you're in the dying state however the devastated that it would make finding survivors that are on the ground really annoying without deerstalker.
---
Considering the only thing that does actually mitigate sounds when on the ground is no mither, a perk that already allows you to get up whenever I can see why it's done
---
üòç
---
I‚Äôve played 3 games already so matchmaking is that bad hmm
---
The true enemy
---
I didn't say every map was getting rain
---
Hates me too. I leveled up Myers over 100 times, no bbq n chili.
---
TAKE MY MONEY   
---
My Wife: But you don't play Wraith.   
---
Me: I DO NOW!
---
Its a survivor using a wraith skin, sorta.
---
ahaha then maybe i just haven‚Äôt found a good way to counter the plague! to me she feels very strong but i guess i‚Äôm just not good against her yet.
---
I like this, but I'd like it better on the hag especially if you gave her a big lobster claw for a weapon
---
We all want our blood points. This is a time to forget about being salty or toxic and work together to get those sweet sweet BP.
---
I mean have you seen how long it finally took for them to change Freddles.
---
Just gotta wait for them to eventually get to Leatherface.
---
I'm going for Frank here.

Thank you. :)

This is unrelated but why was every ghostface trying to kill Sidney?
---
To be quite honest I thought it was a mix between a doctor and a clown.
---
I submitted a support ticket the other day and haven‚Äôt gotten anything. Started happening Monday. When I log in to game, it says cannot save error, cannot load profile, and doesn‚Äôt let me get into the menu. Not sure what happened. I uninstalled and reinstalled, and it didn‚Äôt fix. Is this issue related or am I all sorts of fucked on my own? (Xbox)
---
3 things. 
---
1. It's not abnormal for hotfix buffs to be too much and for an initially underpowered character to turn overpowered bc of them. So if BHVR decides he's OP, that means they realize their hotfix buffs went too far. So let's not pretend that just bc he was shit to begin with, that it suddenly makes it impossible for him to be too strong. 
---
2. I Personally liked the buffs. But I have some gripes. I don't like the buff where you get to see the Survivior that took you out of stealth and I don't like the buff that lets you see where they're trying to cancel ur power from. I also think 45 seconds of exposed for how fast he can stalk (even without add ons. With them it'll get even faster) is too long. To put that in perspective for y'all, I'm pretty sure 45 seconds is how long you have to be chasing a Survivior to get tier 3 Bloodlust. 
---
3. I think Pig needs buffed but the nerf she got was to prevent her from turning her traps into a baby Blood Warden, which im fine with. Her traps being able to kill you while inactive always seemed kinda dumb to me anyways. And it's not like you can't use them for endgame. Just don't wait until the gens are done to start setting them.
---
Better than what i've been getting - killers that signal to farm and then go try hard and kill us once were all on death hook... This is why I wont be farming with killers anymore
---
That‚Äôs a great questionü§î! Dead hard, Resilience, or Wake Up probably all would have saved me but I probably would not have lasted that long in the first place if I switched out any of my other perks.
---
The fact he can go into stealth while looping has insane mindgame potential, his stalk also stacks, he seems really good atm
---
So we can then say my Friday is going better... I‚Äôm sorryüò≥
---
She's like the shittiest most boring killer xD
---
If two survivors do it at each other, it's "Hello"
---
If a survivor does it at a killer, it's usually "git gud, ez"
---
Thank you! Hope you‚Äôre having fun! (Sincerely. Do it for us, please! üò≠üò≠üò≠)
---
I‚Äôm glad 90% of PS4 killers feel this way. Most games if I get hooked I won‚Äôt be able to leave the hook
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Have you tried slowing the game down *JUST A LITTLE BIT*?
---
Dang 150 blood points in light bringer! Jesus that's really rewarding
---
I think it's also: If you just started the grind it'll be: Urgh
---
if you've already gotten all previous perks teachables it'll be: Easy enough.
---
and if you already got all perks on 1 survivor and killer or multiple you dont even need many bloodpoints anymore execpt for add ons and offerings
---
PS4? My game keeps saying that is searching for a match, but I am the fucking killer, I am the match
---
Possibly the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard killers complain about.  Bravo.
---
Weird, in my case the most toxic players have been exactly those three, and the nice ones have been trapper and the nurse
---
I play on Xbox!
---
Just the whit earrings his mouth looks like a huge smile and his eyes are big. I don‚Äôt know I just see a clown lol
---
But he keeps his t1 sneakyness for the whole Match at full speed
---
There are many other crutch perks that have simple counters too, for example, ds just slug, noed, just break totems (I know it‚Äôs not this easy but they are still plausible tactics)
---
Spine chill, Decisive strike. Borrowed Time, Deliverance.
---
These weak arms are heavy
---
I have to lean back in my chair and look out the window questioning this post.
---
Bear in mind, he has no map pressure.
---
He's strong, but requires good perks and a decent amount of skill in chases.
---
Nice try OP but everybody knows that head on never works. Clearly faked
---
*Laughs in P3 Jeff*
---
I like the idea of proximity chat a lot tbh. Tho I think 4 solos can be frustrating when potatoes farming you but the kill/escape rates Behavior posted awhile back make me think it's *reasonably* balanced.
---
Lol maybe I'm still just scarred from the few games I've had against pro-uber tryhard 4 stacks who design team perk builds and can play as good as streamers.
---
In my opinion, he is pretty balanced now. He has a lot of strong points but has a weakness in map pressure.
---
Well, when everyone plays the same damn claudette and the only difference is hairstyle, I am likely to kill them accidentally. I pay enough attention to the names because I‚Äôm lazy.
---
Brown jacket Claudette I'm looking at you.
---
This is a weird thing to get mad about. Well is it makes you happy ima Blackmetal Jeff main.
---
Bbq on killers.
---
We're gonna live forever on survivors.
---
Grind away bud, grind away.
---
More likely BHVR are making a mobile game based on an upcoming Netflix show.
---
So, ghostface after fixes is already a noce midtier killer which I'm going to level. But, just a thought.
---
If they make that marked survivor (after being marked) gains exhaustion status effect for the whole duration of the mark, ghostface would be top tier.
---
Well yeah not everyone farms, this is just for people who farm
---
Make him immune to aura reading perks while he's in stealth mode. That's all.
---
Only when I‚Äôm trying to farm with the survivors. I end up accidentally killing them. If it‚Äôs a normal game, then idgaf
---
Never &gt;:(
---
The hillbilly and nurse are very difficult to maneuver on console so if you are starting now I would recommend someone like the doctor. Then again I have no experience in console so maybe you can get good with him and prove me wrong
---
I just love it when they cleanse a lit totem when there's no ruin
---
Seriously? LOL! Ugh!
---
I guess I read wrong somewhere, but Bhvr pretty much specializes in making games for existing IPs so it wouldnt surprise me if they're just helping with something like that
---
Hear hear
---
In my opinion, a difference here is that those methods of countering are much less convenient than just hooking the survivor you knocked down.
---
Big mood
---
He was breathing like crazy c'mon dude
---
Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, and Mettle of Man are all amazing perks to help you survive
---
NextGames is making a Stranger Things mobile game but they weren't included in the tweet. Just seems like something more...
---
All 4 of them in the same damn game.
---
This is SO amazing! I really really love this design! I really hope you win the contest! ‚ù§
---
Wrong.
---
https://bgr.com/2019/06/13/stranger-things-video-release-game-ios-android-pokemon/
---
This has to be the worst flex I've ever seen.
---
Ruin + NOED on Nurse means you are terrible at the game.
---
Thanatophobia you don't even know what you are doing since this perk is literally useless.
---
Ebony Mori during 2x BP
---
If these weren't enough, rank 15. 
---
Congratulations.
---
That sounds like a good build I will keep it in mind
---
Fair point
---
Alright then deal with it and don‚Äôt bitch about problems you don‚Äôt want to fix yourself.
---
&gt; most survivors are pretty toxic.
---
Well there are 4 survivors each match against 1 killer, so logically speaking, there is a higher chance of encountering more toxic survivors than killers. But regardless of that, I play both sides and encounter plenty of toxicity from both survivors and killers, I really don't think it's right to say that "X side is more toxic".
---
How does quitting fix a problem?
---
well, the best farming perk for survivors is We're Gonna Live Forever (David King), but you can use Prove Thyself (Dwight) and No One Left Behind to be at max in objective and altruism categories. For killers, BBQ &amp; Chilli (Leatherface) and Distressing with Hex: Thrill of the Hunt to max your deviousness and hunter categories.
---
Because you don‚Äôt have to deal with the problem duuh.
---
Balanced landing is good on some maps and I realy want Mettle of Man
---
They made their own tweet
---
This is indeed why deathwalls exist too.
---
The only thing I dislike is that he can get his stalk off during a Chase. Besides that he absolutely fine as a killer
---
You are literally that kid that complains the enemy is shooting back at them in CoD.
---
I don't know what you mean by that buy okay, very cool.
---
Couldn't play him on PTB because of lobbies so I can't tell. 
---
Watching zubat playing, looked way too strong and the lack of TR by default makes him campers paradise.
---
Tunneling is not toxic, it's trying to kill.
---
Heeello
---
I agree with the fact that if you increased BP gains killers would gain more power than survivors due to power add-ons, but the solution could be to change bloodwebs. This is probably an unpopular solution which I‚Äôm sure is why they haven‚Äôt touched bloodpoints.
---
That's really good! Nice work!
---
I think you should get a different video. The one you have right now seems like the Trapper just wanted to see the Entity kill animation and it bugged out.
---
Lol yeah it‚Äôs weird that your the one that makes the lobby but your searching for a lobby
---
He has zero map pressure, wastes time stalking people and he still gets revealed which causes a long 30 second cooldown. Exposed status isn't even that strong becauuse it doesn't help you against experiences survivors looping at all. He is another mid tier killer sadly.
---
Dunno why you are getting downvoted. Your concerns are very reasonable and valid
---
Hmmm, might just be a bug than
---
I am not against you. I am just saying this guy assumed ALL killers said this which is unfair. You are still my number one, I just needed to teach you to appriciate live again.
---
It‚Äôs a good perk. Used correctly and it can easily save your life, save time, and even avoid chases.
---
Yeah I did it's very underrated
---
i feel like the devs rushed with the buffs only so the playerbase will buy the DLC and after 2-3 months will hardly nerf him
---
I understand the downvotes, GF launched on the first ptb in a very sad state, it's understandable that people will be against any nerf propositions.
---
I swear to god I never see another Kate, but I'm proud to carry the country girl banner alone.
---
That's why I don't ask questions on here anymore. People either ignore it or give a smartass response.
---
you gotta do just a regular attack(not a lunge) and if they stop doing the unhook it cancels the grab for whatever reason. this applies to pretty much all grabs, they just stop whatever it was that let you grab them and you lose the grab. wish theyd fix it
---
The video is meant to showcase what the exploit looks like. It does not analyse the person's intent.
---
Playing the game
---
*2 more ace's join
---
You are al breathtaking!
---
I LOVE ALL THAT IS METAL!!!!!!!!!
---
Grabs are very inconsistent, it's basically 100% luck.
---
I believe you can do it at any time during the unhook animation. Trying getting a little closer and tapping the mouse button instead of holding it which makes you lunge.
---
Being easy and being strong are two different things.
---
There's a DbD Discord that people usually use to find people to play with. Asking on this sub is another way. 
---
The way I did it was adding people through in game. It was through him that I met all his other friends and now we all play together. People are honestly really nice in this game, just gotta add him and say hello
---
but teabagging people don't teabag to signal, they do it for other less altruistic reasons and it's not even a commonplace thing to do to signal.
---
Why hex: third seal?
---
I like using one shot head with babushka flower,
---
It‚Äôs much easier to hit hatchet when it‚Äôs not winding up for hours
---
Hell yeah!
---
I don't think it's about surviving but more about pipping
---
Sidney has survived all four films. All four of them are actually very good (3 is a bad movie but it‚Äôs funny).
---
I wouldn't complain, no.
---
I can‚Äôt think of a single one that does.
---
Agreed. I can play survivor no problem without an item, but addons are so important for most Killers it's ridiculous.
---
It's literally just doing the objective.
---
I pulled something similar to this the other day. Good shit bro!
---
Ex druggie and Amanda‚Äôs more in her early 20s.
---
thana + nurses if you hit everyone is annoying to versus
---
I just had a noed, thana, iri head, lullaby huntress, ebony mori too
---
to make it worse i got a bug that made it annoying to play the game
---
I had no idea ... I guess I don't feel so bad that it's date night with the wife.  Hell, I might even put out tonight if I can't play!
---
Oh ok. Saminations gave me the impression the sequels weren't that good. Also if she did survive all the films how would she get into the realm of the entity?
---
That sounds like a great idea.
---
Disagree. I watch Fungoose and he plays killer with no addons all the time and usually 4ks. It‚Äôs all in the matter of skill and if you want to devote time to the game.
---
Anyone that isn't Nurse, Billy, or Spirit. Possibly Myers as well. The rest of the cast are majorly handicapped without addons.
---
Sounds good! That way we all get screwed.
---
Premonition! No piggy or wraith or freddy for me

I drew it with magic marker

FTFY

Well than he is quite good at the game and I congratulate him, but that doesn't mean the killer is viable. You can be successful with the worst character in a fighting game, but you wouldn't call them viable either.
---
Doesn't it seem like the balance is wack when you have to put in an incredible amount of effort just to beat your average high rank survivor main with no addons?
---
That‚Äôs funny
---
The point of the build is to blind, down and slug the entire team on doctors map during the dxp event, thus preventing em from points
---
How about giving us the ability to sell add-ons and such that we don't use?
---
Welcome to 2016. Leave Harambe by the door.
---
Freddy, Trapper, Cannibal, Clown, Plague, Legion, Doctor and Wraith are very add-on reliant, they are very weak without green/purple/red add-ons.
---
not all pallets you can outplay a survivor. certain maps there‚Äôs tons of loops that have no mind game at all. and a problem is that even if you outplaying survivors and downing them consistently, you can still have all the gens done in like 6 minutes.
---
I thought she was around 30 when she died in saw 4?
---
Anyone else getting a kinda salty killer vibe from the title?
---
I got the same thing and I want a fucking refund on my add ons
---
I don't know why offerings are even consumed when someone dcs at all. They're the least impactful part of a survivors kit unless they take a map offering.
---
Couldn't they also just reduce the chance for certain add-ons to appear in bloodwebs? Kinda new so not sure if how it fully works
---
He says, in a Dead by Daylight group.
---
Only issue rn is MOM and some scratch marks and notifications are bugged, besides that, games fine
---
survivors dc like crazy no matter what killer you play these days so it‚Äôs probably not plague related
---
I mean, people enjoy playing the game, so kinda.
---
If you're having trouble with that I recommend rethinking how you approach the game and cooling off a little.
---
He doesn‚Äôt even put in that much effort the guy just plays well and has a good memory of when Bloodlust comes up, how chases go, if the survivor can make it, when to use the power etc. it‚Äôs more built in because he practiced and wanted a calculation so he can become good. 
---
Only 1 killer that I can say is bad and that‚Äôs legion just because they made his power incredibly hard to hit with and he has bad design in general. But I do agree with the change because jeez when legion was released that was a shit show.
---
she can be annoying, but i wouldn't say hated. 
---
and i think the annoyance stems from the lack of cohesiveness from your team. some cleanse, some don't, rarely does everyone do the same thing
---
Not exactly. 
---
Hillbilly is a very strong Killer and his power is fairly easy to learn and use (at least IMO) so yes in the regard that if you play him you'll usually be able to get a lot of points and control the flow of the game.
---
However there's nothing that makes him especially good at generating bloodpoints. If that's what you're looking for I'd suggest Freddy, Doctor, or Legion.
---
Freddy and Doctor are both very easy to max Deviousness on and as long as you use your power to draw out the game as long as possible (focus more on preventing generators from being done than killing Survivors). You should also be able to max out Hunter and Brutality in the same way.
---
Legion is a bit harder, but if you're good at them you can get quite a few points very quickly by just playing them the way they're meant to be played.
---
I think alot of people hate the whole no mither forced playstyle. Since when you become broken it's not smart to cleanse. 
---
I dislike it but not enough that I'd DC when I get a plague
---
Spine Chill, Lightweight, This is not Happening, Ace in the Hole
---
When my friend first saw that skin, he sent it to me and said "Look dude, you're in DBD now" lol
---
Maybe lay 20s then, point is she‚Äôs definitely not a teen.
---
Haven‚Äôt you heard? The new trials are winning a match of checkers.
---
OH jeez. Isn't this a meet in the middle situation? Ya'll over there on the one side should be a bit thicker skinned. Ya'll on the other side should also keep in mind that the entire point of video games is to have fun and if you're playing in such a way that somebody else isn't having fun, you're stepping on their good time and that's a jerk thing to do. 
---
I mostly play killer and teabagging alone isn't enough to tick me off. That's never going to stop so I just remind myself that it's not hurting me and they're having a good time. As a survivor, it does feel like a hollow victory to run out the door without waving goodbye to the killer first.
---
Well Laurie didn‚Äôt die in Halloween 1 or 2 which is the canon she was taken from. Quentin didn‚Äôt die in Nightmare on Elm Street, either.
---
Freddy and Leatherface are both easily worse than Legion. All those things you listed that he does are basic killer skills. I don't think you have a good enough grasp of killer tbh.
---
I‚Äôm taking this as you‚Äôre a Metal fan lol. Fuck yeah man! Haha oh I‚Äôm so glad they went into a smaller community and gave us something awesome.
---
oh honey, the first mistake you've made was to down a survivor, you should read their made up rule book 'cause that's not how the things work
---

---
I've thought about this a lot, honestly. Give us the option of selling add-ons and offerings at like half price. That way, it's not such a waste to buy your 100th brown med kit that you had to buy in order to get another perk.
---
Oh yea. I'm dumb.
---
i think the best thing here would be for you to evaluate your expectations.
---
are you playing to have fun or climb the ranks?
---
if you're playing to have fun, you may want to step away (after the 2x, of course) and just settle for a bit, then come back with a clearer head.
---
if you're playing to rise the ranks, watch some other killers, play as survivor (if you don't already), or even watch high level survivors to see what they do to combat killers so you have an idea of what to expect.
---
either way, it's just a game, don't stress out over it too much, life is too short for that
---
I have a stack of browns to sell on most characters.
---
NextGames tweeted about themselves.
---
Leatherface is actually quite good you just have to know when to use his power or you can fuck yourself over. Freddy can be good but he‚Äôs about split pressure even more of course before the change. 
---
Legion doesn‚Äôt have a power really he‚Äôs more a M1 killer that essentially does nothing. Freddy has some tracking skills. Leatherface has an instadown if you‚Äôre good enough.
---
My bad, I'm sorry! &gt;.&lt;
---
It‚Äôs true since endgame was introduced.
---
What your asking for is more of a fix than a nerf to be fair
---
That's right, he's still useless
---
I definitely try to cool off after the match, but it's extremely hard to do during a match. When you say rethinking my approach, do you have any suggestions for how to cope with toxic players? You're right that I'm sorta the asshole when I'm hiding after losing to players simply because they're good, but I don't really have a better solution to the toxic issue.
---
I'm talking about Netflix. They didn't mention NextGames in the tweet.
---
I have made it a game at this point to guess whether or not the killer has NOED when I‚Äôm being chased after all the gens are done
---
Please run Borrowed Time. So far, most of my games have been less than 10k base points because people keep farming me right in front of the Killer.
---
Is it double bloodpoint weekend?
---
I'd get that mask real quick
---
That's the whole thing. I love the game when it's not frustrating. Even good players who are at least, I don't know, reasonable, are fun to play against. I feel like completely avoiding the game because some players piss me off is almost as bad as DCing.
---
Fair enough. I also like to play survivor from time to time and I've never considered not cleansing. It makes sense in a way. I'll try it sometime. Thanks for mentioning that and thanks for your opinion :)
---
no ones saying its OP, its just bullshit, it rewards losing killers, only perk like that for survivors is MOM, which is getting rightfully nerfed.
---
End of the Game Collapse. Once the Gates are open, you have two minutes to get out or you will die, the bar is the countdown. The floor is to look spooky dooky
---
I can totally agree with you since I play survivor and everytime I've played against her it's either gone super bad or super good.
---
Just depends on the player in general to be honest.
---
Thanks for giving me your OP.
---
no, we need nancy wheeler as a survivor... us gays only have so many female survivors to play as...
---
facts tbh i use them when they try to pallet loop then be toxic and dribble
---
Why does this remind me of those Monster High dolls?
---
So because your bad, an entire perk needs to be changed? OoO is a super risky perk to run
---
Ok here you go.
---
I'm new so what's wrong with bringing a mori during the event?
---
Hahaha, I've actually been reported because of actually doing my job as killer.
---
I‚Äôll try that. Might help me out.
---
Not really toxic, but boring as hell. I missed when survivors mindgamed me instead
---
Wait no
---
I literally bought the game yesterday, and I'm so pissed I can't play.
---
As long as you don‚Äôt look exactly like every other claudette in the damn game.
---
Jokes xD
---
I agree with you
---
I personally find the plague annoying.
---
Jane's just getting her squats in, that's why she's so THICC
---
But really, if the gate is open, just leave.
---
I feel what you're saying. When I first started I was similarly frustrated. I wouldn't worry too much. Rank just reset so that is probably why you might be seeing more toxicity than normal. For me the way I got through it at first is just finding perks that really work for you. For my spirit I use thrill of the hunt,  ruin, haunted ground, and surveillance (can't recommend this for spirit enough)  this build is good for early match momentum but at some point your totems definitely get destroyed and you have to rely on skill after that. I would suggest if you find yourself becoming too frustrated you should switch killers or play survivor for a while. Imo the only way to become a really good killer is to play both sides of the game. It's really the easiest way to learn how to deal with the stress. At least for me. Good luck!
---
Where can I get these two pictures of Feng tho
---
Haha. I totally get it. I dont get why almost every claudette in the game is either wearing bloody clothes or the brown jacket. 
---
I get it's good for stealth, but I'd prefer to just look cool and not seem like the most toxic purrson in the world
---
You sound a lot like Dwight I‚Äôm not gonna lie. But it‚Äôs rank 15 you will get better.
---
Depends were you teabagging while looping is toxic and I would understand why he would camp if thats the case
---
Ohhhhh that makes sense.
---
And thanks; I don't worry about spoilers for Saw though. I'd heard that all the movies after 2 just weren't worth watching because they basically turned into torture porn.
---
Same here.  I really don't care if I die so long as I pip.  I consider that a win.
---
What.
---
If it's so OP, how come no one runs it?
---
I have an all over print shirt with the artwork from Anthropocene Extinction that I picked up when I saw them touring for it on Summer Slaughter, Cattle Decap is dope
---
Just because he can win with add-onless killers that doesn't mean that killers by itself are strong without add-ons. All Trapper mains I met said me the same thing : Trapper's base kit is trash. All Cannibal mains I know spam with charge time add-ons, because they know that otherwise their chainsaw is useless, all Plagues I see use her effectiveness or Apples add-ons all day and Flask of Bleach is literally mandatory for Clown for his power to actually work properly.
---
Half of the killers are so weak at base kit, that they need add-ons of green or higher rarity to make up for their weaknesses.
---
I love playing the Plague and matches go either one of two ways... either survivors cleanse or they don‚Äôt. I get quite a lot of DC‚Äôs when survivors cleanse because her Corrupt Purge is so powerful and easy to use so they go down in seconds and it all snowballs very quickly.
---
Good meam mah dood
---
Damn, I really should play survivor. It's just too scary for me, as embarrassing as it is to admit.
---
Its a high risk high reward perk - similar to most hex totems. You cant advocate for a perk to get nerfed because a skilled player might use it...
---
Usually Wraith, Trapper, Freddy, and Pig run it.  Sometimes you'll run into Myers and Hillbilly with it too.  Also Nurses who want to ensure no fun can be had.
---
yeah, i feel ya. it can be annoying. don't let those chodes get to you. They're trying to get your attention while others work generators. focus on that, don't fall into their traps. 
---
one thing i like to do as spirit (works better near pallets) is just put a couple of feet between the pallet and myself while they're on the other side, stand there for a couple of seconds. they'll think you're phasing, they'll often make a mistake or leave the loop, and that's your chance to pounce.
---
either way, you're playing to have fun, and if an element of the game (toxic players) are causing you to not have fun, fucking avoid them and get others. ignore them. focus on elements of the game you really enjoy. i love chasing people. identify what aspects of the game you enjoy and go for it!
---
anyway, i should probably do some work instead of posting. take care out there!
---
&gt; it hurts a killer more then the survivor
---
I mean.. should a survivor perk work the other way around?
---
&gt;Thank you! I really like playing spirit but so many of her skins just dont feel distinct enough for me
---
Killer offerings shouldnt do the same, if the killer DCs why should he keep his offerings? He made the choice to leave, let him get punished somehow (Since there really isnt a punishment otherwise)
---
Solo survivor aswell, depends what you see as good but I get decent enough teammates normally, it really depends on luck I guess
---
Aww, thank you. :-)
---
Looping isnt toxic and I never mind when a survivor does it but when they start teabagging and shit then I'm making sure they aren't getting out
---
It shouldn't.  It's a test build for a reason.
---
Yep that's correct however you won't lose the teachables for other killers or the 3 you get from the killer.
---
lmao its more
---
doctor: you are screaming every your location every 10 secs
---
hag: no where is safe she is everywhere and nowhere
---
I know how this feels from both sides but this can easily be outplayed comming from a killer main. If they tbag you and they aren't injured dont waste time and go to other gens or something.
---
I main survivor but i got all adepts so i guess it's semi viable advice?
---
Naw I don‚Äôt like to t-bag and back in the day I used to play killer way more then survivor so I have respect for others that don‚Äôt T-Bag. T-Bag is just very disrespectful. 
---
I just looked him for more then 3 minutes and my teammates popped about 2 or 3 gens.
---
It happens. Lol survivor doesn't usually scare me but something about myers actually terrifies me when I play against him lol
---
Yes. You lose everything but the outfit piece you just earned. A fresh start with slightly better odds at rare items/perks with each prestige.
---
The *only* thing I'm good at is the ol' "stand there menacingly" mindgame, but still, very solid advice. Thanks a bunch!
---
Yeah pretty much.  Even Hillbillies will run with it.
---
Maybe you want to play against competent survivors, or maybe it just happened because you played even if you didn't intend to rank up lol
---
Oh. This is why where have been so many Leatherfaces today. Hadn't made the connection. I'm already super tired of playing against him this weekend. :/
---
I‚Äôm hoping to see them one day. Cattle Decapitation is one of my favorite bands and I love Travis Ryan‚Äôs Vocals.
---
Ooh man you should actually give the series a watch, the kills are all torture yeah but honest there‚Äôs a really good crime thriller under all that. I honestly think every saw movie is great. Jigsaw the most recent one is definitely the weakest imo because it‚Äôs a tacked-on story but they are all pretty great imo.
---
Do you also lose all items that aren't addons or offerings?
---
*Laughs in spirit*
---
Also, outplaying survivors =/= downing survivors, there's much more to it than that. Outplaying means knowing when/ where/ how to pressure survivors to try and eventually snowball a 4k. Obviously you're gonna have to run that infinite eventually and just bloodlust that fucker down, but a big part of red rank killer is understanding when to just say "fuck it" and leave the flashlight clicking nea to go pressure elsewhere.
---
No, you're right, I do need to learn to ignore the obvious distractions and gatekeep properly. That's probably why toxic hijinks are so effective on me.
---
This movie rules
---
It‚Äôs not worth going prestige until I unlock everything for everyone then is it? I only have like 5-6 killers at lvl 40. Doc is lvl 50 just because I want lvl 3 bbq.
---
Oh yeah she‚Äôs been around
---
Why is the bottom picture literally me lol. I can't loop so save my life.
---
Dude Travis makes some of the most fucking inhuman noises ever, I love it lol. Dudes like him paved the way for monsters like Dickie Allen and Duncan Bentley
---
Right back at you
---
Enthraling gameplay lol.
---
BBQ is the only mandatory perk for BP farming. If playing to win, NOED is too strong to not use unless you are consistently killing everyone before gens get powered. Overcharge and Ruin are both good for stalling the game a little longer. Everything else is whatever.
---
Last time I played survivor, it was Pig, and I just... I can't. Something about those reverse bear traps disturbs my soul. That's why said last time was so long ago.
---
Good game OP. Destroy them, show them no mercy, sweep all legs. You're the power role and there's nothing wrong with demonstrating it.
---
Actually that second part on the better items has been proven to be false IIRC
---
Okie that's good as a killer main I appreciate the respect you show usually when someone is looping me I don't mind usually end up just walking away to get the others but if they are looping and teabaging then its toxic as hell
---
Alright don‚Äôt P3 if you aren‚Äôt a Collectionist or you don‚Äôt want to wear the bloody clothes. You start all over unless you find it fun and challenging.
---
Nurse is actually fucking broken on this map if you're good
---
Even if the survivor is looking directly at him he can stalk a third of the stalk off them without being broken out of it
---
BP grind is a nightmare when you think of how many characters you have in game who you‚Äôre expected to reset back to square one when you prestige. So multiply the bloodpoints from level 0-50 times the entire cast, times 4.
---
I'd buy
---
No her boyfriend got killed by Jon Kramer
---
Beautiful work! Liked and followed! :)
---
Lol it can be unnerving if you do play survivor I would suggest using Spine Chill. That way you at least know when the killer is most likely coming lol
---
BP grind aint bad right now for a few reasons:
---
1) Its a double bloodpoint event at the moment. A lot of people are bringing BP offerings into games because of this. Your BPs wont normally be anywhere near as high.
---
2) You dont see the issue because youre new (no offence). You dont have the majority of teachable perks unlocked. You can have a character at level 50 and spend hundred of thousands of BP looking for a single perk that you might not see till well over a million BP are wasted at 50.
---
As for DLC perks: Very few are actually meta (BBQ is but even then its not the end of the world). And I understand you dont like to spend IRL money/in game currency to unlock them but its better than not being able to unlock the perk at all without the DLC...
---
See I disagree. I think the comms are what balances it and its solo thats in favor of the killer. I really think they should add comms in the form of proximity chat to solos. I play both sides too and maybe its because I dont play that much so I never reach the rank I should as killer before the rreset but im constantly wiping solos and actually having good games against the tryhard SWFs
---
Hell yeah and if you haven‚Äôt heard Aborted he has probably the most Unique vocals I have ever heard of.
---
Yeah it's kind of same when survivors don't expect the killer to go for the person you just unkooked it's just smart
---
Cecil was a fucking cunt to be fair tho
---
Pretty sure I saw the same graph as you and the increase was real, just very slight. I will say I feel as if my tier 3 killers and get much better items in the blood web more often.
---
I feel you shouldn't prestige until you get all the teachables on everyone because if you prestige a killer you love to play it will cost alot of bloodpoints that you could use to unlock teachables so yeah don't prestige until you get every teachable I also recommend having a backup killer to play if you prestige one you like playing so you won't get steamrolled by Survivors.
---
No yeah I completely agree 100% man. Only game I‚Äôll t-bag on is WoW because fuck the alliance lol.
---
Tbh, i am below rank 15 so if they're all toxic i try to get one and facecamp them. They get really toxic at you. (I am rank 16 if you want to know). Alternatively, as a survivor most people will try to throw a pallet down and loop you at places like cars do if that chase doesnt end soon you should go. Plus, you have spirit allowing for intresting mindgames
---
NOED?
---
additionally if a survivor has brought a medpack, it's pretty much useless
---
Bringing a Mori with the intent to Hook on,or Al Survivors once and then mori them on a Double BP event denies them getting practically any points...the game is grindy as fuck without high end offerings, BBQ/WGLF Perks and without these events...deny people a chance to get said points on a 3 day event is a douchebag move...we get these events VERY sparingly...I think you should get the point now
---
me use big word, sound smort
---
I've seen Aborted ;)
---
I think that camping and teabagging accomplish the same exact thing, "triggering" the opposite side.  
---
Camping is a legit strategy that will almost always "trigger" the survivor on the hook, and possibly the rest of the survivors in the trial.  I don't camp as killer and will always go after another survivor.  If I lose that kill then I just didn't do my job well enough.  
---
Teabagging almost always "triggers" the killer and therefore is also a legitimate strategy.  I might teabag to try and get aggro to help an injured teammate that is on last hook or is gonna get moried etc...
---
Even though I see them as legitimate, I don't see either one as particularly effective past most beginner games.
---
When he was released, his power was basically a miss, and was a once in a blue moon occurrence to pull it off. Plus he has lackluster perks that don't really sunc with each other and aren't very beneficial to the killer. 
---
The devs pulled an outstanding move by making his power not as easily influenced by survivor actions, but is now to be considered a mid tier killer.
---
He is good, if not great now, but many will look back and say "remember when ghostface was a fucking joke?" Those that played the ptb and kept up in the community will remember.
---
With how hard it is to break his stealth now, I think I'm All Ears would be amazing on loops, since you mask your TR in nightshroud and if the survivor fast vaults, they are highlighted for you destroying any mindgames they try pulling.
---
Starting over at level 1 with no perks after earning new perks through other killers is fun though. You adopt weird wacky play styles using a mashup of random skills you unlocked when you reset. I‚Äôve found a lot of cool perks I‚Äôd otherwise never have used doing it.
---
Sounds good. Thanks for the answers and advice!
---
It sucks for players with a lot of hours who can't afford to play over 10+ hours a week, too. As the OP says, every time a new character comes out, if you actually want to play them with decent perks you better have a sizeable amount of BPs banked or you're reexperiencing the same grind new players do all over again, except with even more useless teachables to clog your blood webs.
---
Oh yeah he was a cunt I mean that‚Äôs the whole point of Saw, Kill the cunts! Until that one saw where they burned an innocent wife married to a liar. That was a disgrace and I hate it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they had an age on her since it wasn‚Äôt that important.
---
Mettle of man seems useless to me, what does it do? Never used it but as killer that tried to get adept i only noticed it gzve 1 health state and revealed your aura
---
Dude I fucking hate you lol.
---
Edit: No idea why on mobile a reply will be posted at the top of a thread. It happens a lot to me and it's really tilting me
---
32k times 6 = 192,000 killer if you use the other bonus BBQ or WGLF it would be 224,000 I THINK I could be wrong
---
Frick, you caught me Coach
---
Is there anyway to indicate you‚Äôd like to farm? I changed my username to show that I‚Äôm doing that but so far I‚Äôm only running into killers who want kills. And as a killer, all survivors run away from me, even after I show head nodding and everything
---
Yeah for some it‚Äôs fun for others they don‚Äôt want to grind all over again. It all depends on the person behind the game. I personally don‚Äôt care for P3 on my characters besides Licensed killers.
---
I've had a good 10+ years of going to like 10 shows a year, theres not many heavy bands that I havent seen at some point lol. Multiple times I've done 2 shows in the same week even. I'm a junkie
---
Hold onto your butts
---
But why
---
Red ranks are garbage
---
It wasnt?
---
Damn that makes a lot of sense lol.
---
This is such a dumb post.
---
Okay thank you I will keep that in mind no mori during event
---
Look at it this way. Cosmetics don‚Äôt change your gameplay, Perks do amor can.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
should be the opposite lol
---
holy jezz i broke a rib. i'm dying send help\\
---
I think I figured him out pretty well, he is stealth based but really he is the opposite to legion. Legion is anti grouping while Ghost face is meant to punish those who stray from their allies. He stalks then makes his kill but really when he is used in stealth he is supposed to be picking out the weak ones and making his move. He is not hard to counter but letting him take his chances can be your downfall.   
---
What I think is he is a step in a good direction for sneaky killers and picking off people one by one can be slow but he knows how to keep the pressure on and takes advantage of people doing gens in a mean way.  Cause doing gens he could be watching you without you seeing him slowly building up that stalk but you are far too busy with the gen and you don't realize till it's too late.
---
That‚Äôs if you want to prestige though. If you‚Äôre just getting them to level 40 to get their teachables then you don‚Äôt really need to prestige. I‚Äôll prestige my mains but that‚Äôs it.
---
Really just try ignore people being toxic. It's tough to give people tips for dealing with it. Just focus on chasing and hooking people, just have a good time regardless of them being annoying. People will get away and sometimes everyone will get away but that isn't a good reason to ruin the fun for yourself. I like to think of it like playing "killer" when I was a kid. It's like hide and seek in a way.
---
Yes. Out of ten games earlier 4 of them had someone disconnect. Then one game was super laggy then a slugging huntress. 
---
Hopefully tonight when I play again it will be better.  :/
---
And subscribed
---
It helps that I've sorta integrated myself into the scene a little lol. I've met a lot of musicians, hung out/smoked with em, chat on social media, etc. Tom Barber recognizes my face now from how many times I've kicked it with him when Lorna Shore came through town, went back stage and smoked with Rings of Saturn and Reaping Asmodeia, hung out with Ben Duerr last time he came through and chat with him on Facebook from time to time, stuff like that. Also in a lot of music groups on Facebook and such so I'm pretty much flooded with constant info about heavy music lol
---
The real question is why knock out AND third seal?
---
that's... unfortunate
---
Or you could not be a rank 20 and turn your camera the other way
---
I think he means in case survivors leave.
---
Yeah, because it sucks dick
---
Ask your question in the form of a meme and people will answer
---
Wow. Aren‚Äôt you cocky? My survivor rank is 8 thank you. Well, was before reset. The perk is also highly rated by streamers of DbD at higher ranks as well.
---
I agree with OP. I have around 1000 hrs in the game so not as much as a lot of people but I‚Äôve never had a problem with the ‚Äúgrind‚Äù. BP weekends definitely helps, yeah it can get tedious if you want to P3 every character but that‚Äôs your choice if you want to do that. I‚Äôm getting all characters to level 40 to get all teachables and prestige my mains (Claudette because I like being a ninja and my girl Jane because booty) I don‚Äôt really have a main killer but I‚Äôve got my killers set out how I want them. 
---
As for DLC, it is what it is, it‚Äôs not really that expensive if you buy them over time, you won‚Äôt even notice it
---
It tells you when the killers coming towards you so you could prepare and hide
---
Ohh.  I took a bit of creative liberty there to up the creepiness.
---
there's actually four survivors in this picture, ace, claudette shadow ace and nea
---
Which parts to be exact?
---
(Feel free to draw circles or arrows on my art so I can see where I should mend it.)
---
And then the frosty-eyed non-DLC midrank killer hits you with NOED and you're like "ahh, of course".
---
I know this may be strange to you but
---
I actually don't use the corrupt purge so much. I think that her ability to vomit endlessly until they hit No Mither state is good enough as it is considering you can reach so far and just use your ability on many different things. Lockers, pallets, items, over a time period.
---
I mean the corrupt purge but I just find it useful in clutch situations.
---
Glad to see another who loves playing the Plague though!
---
Fair enough and I can totally see it :)
---
Do they win anything? Aside from publicity?
---
After you get hit three times, it blocks the next hit that would down you, it‚Äôs basically a better pre nerf DS
---
Had a bubba facecamp me. I got 5k points total from that match. Best offering ever.
---
I don‚Äôt have access to my computer at the moment but I can point them out.
---
They would be the feet, the right breast and the mouth clamps on the Ludovico device
---
Nodding is enough communication for killers (flashbacks of seeing Michael Myers nod)
---
As a huntress main I have noticed that she can benefit from lots of Windows on this map
---
Oh wow thank you for the compliment I learned that everyone deserves respect and kindness until they prove you otherwise and I follow that in all things plus i have experienced people ruining games for others and I don't wanna be that guy
---
I think he will be MM tier personally with the new buffs. We still have to figure him out, but he‚Äôs looking pretty good now.
---
Most of them don‚Äôt even play correctly lol. If they play correctly, then fair play to them.
---
Yeah, I sadly don't have a choice. I'd love to play as Spirit/Plague/New legion, but I doing so is just a bad way to utilize the limited time I'll have with the game.
---
I‚Äôm the opposite, wouldn‚Äôt a nice skin be cool?
---
Also me: BuT 150k BlOoDpOiNtS
---
It's not double xp, only bloodpoints.
---
No it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs way to slow. if I need the other killer to patrol the other side of the map, then how am I going to relay that through a mod?
---
This collaboration could mean either a stranger things dlc, a dbd show, or maybe a deathgarden related content
---
They could easily tag the good add-ons and Mori with a tag that says decrease weight-chance by 50% and then increasing Bloodpoint cost of everything by 50%. But are they gonna? No. When there is a simple fix they seem to go out of their way to over complicate it and add a new system or they deem it insignificant and focus on other issue. Can't blame them, they have 1000 problems that are in need of fixing and they only have so many people.
---
Legend Feng
---
That instadown is terrible though and realistically doesn‚Äôt work on competent players. Imo he‚Äôs worse off than freddy is currently since really all leatherface is, is a camp bot.
---
I never have an issue with the instadown.
---
Hitboxes aren't the problem. The animations don't match the hitboxes all the time, which is why the devs said they're working on redoing some animations to match the hitboxes. That plus lag makes this a huge problem. However, once we get dedicated servers and the animations fixed then it should remove all these "how the fuck did that hit me" moments.
---
You telling me your rank like it matters tells me you're more of a noob than i previously thought. Thanks
---
So does a heartbeat
---
I usually prestige my main(s) as soon as I run out of Party streamers/cakes/puddings and my favorite add-ons/offerings.
---
I make a point of prestiging if I have mediocre perks at lvl 50.  
---
I do not level past 50 if I plan on prestiging that character.
---
I usually spend points leveling characters I‚Äôm not using so they have a decent build when I do.
---
I‚Äôm between chapters I like to store up BP for the next chapter, though I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about that until you level what you have.
---
I also like saving up a million for when I prestige a killer so I can go on a spending spree and get into it.
---
If you‚Äôre playing a lot this weekend, this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
---
25k match + 2x event + Party streamer + BBQ = 100k.  You might even have survivors throw down some BPS.
---
Generally: down someone and carry them to a gen and start hitting the gen while carrying the survivor.
---
Or just stand under a pallet and hit the pallet.
---
I think 
---
Top left: The person next to the person opening the gate
---
Bottom right: The person opening the gates with a lot of stress because top left is shouting to hurry up even tho there's no way to speed up the process
---
Yep dbp
---
My lack of review before post
---
Shows
---
He is becoming a killer you don't heal against (on certain maps at least).
---
Not fun for Survivors or Ghostface if that becomes the meta for him.
---
Hey, nice! I'm hoping for a DBD show but I'll take whatever I get!
---
One killer camps the basement while the other downs and carries survivors to them? I think not...
---
Trade either spine chill or self care for an exhaustion perk: Sprint burst, dead hard, balanced landing, or lithe.
---
Platform: PC 
---
Type of Bug: Audio 
---
Description: Pig‚Äôs terror radius no longer fades smoothly when crouching but instead cuts off immediately as soon as she finishes her crouch animation 
---
Steps to Reproduce: Crouch and have a survivor listen to the terror radius 
---
Expected result: Terror radius transitions smoothly into silence 
---
Actual Result: Terror radius abruptly ends when the Pig finishes her crouch animation 
---
Chance of this Occurring: 100% of the time 
---
Also there‚Äôs another bug (gameplay): sometimes when attempting to heal another survivor by yourself or with another survivor 
---
the button prompt to heal them will not show up at all. Fortunately, or I suppose unfortunately, the bug happens very rarely and there are no set steps one can take to actually reproduce the bug as it seems to happen pretty randomly. 
---
Setup: 1060 Nvidia GeForce graphics card, 500 GB external SSD (where the game is stored)
---
It's a rare thing honestly, so many don't care because they don't care or want/need points...but We're all still part of this community, ya know? Not tunneling or camping goes a long way, doubly so when it comes to these events.  Ofc, expressing stress about such people draws em outta the woodwork to exoress proudly how it's their way to play or how they HATE people that go easy or don't try so hard on a...3...day...event...one we may not see again for MONTHS.  
---
Sorry, I'm just one of those people that just can't wrap my head around the mentality to be unable to chillax for a bit on a damn game.
---
YES!
---
To be painfully bright it‚Äôd have to be daytime
---
Or maybe and stick with me here youre just bad at leatherface....could be a theory you might want to think about...
---
I'm hoping it's a dbd show and each episode is a different killers backstory
---
Yo that smiling front mask would be scary as hell in game
---
Thanks, I'm new to this game so Idk much
---
I love Autodidact, but gosh darn she is a cruel mistress.
---
Focus on landing the blind during actions were the killer can‚Äôt look away. While they break a pallet and while they are picking up a survivor. 
---
Just keep the light right on their face until the beam widens. Then run. Lol
---

---
It‚Äôs back up and here‚Äôs a way if you get an error to actually play enjoy double BP!
---
It helps if you understand that they‚Äôre not always teabagging, pointing, etc. just for the sake of being a jerk, but because they want you to chase them. They want your attention and to make you annoyed so that you lose sight of other things happening in the match. Just think of it as another mind game, and try to outplay it. If a brightly coloured Nea with a med kit and the Obsession status wants to be chased, then ignore her. Because she‚Äôll almost certainly be better at chases than the rest of her team, and will have several perks to help extend the chase for as long as possible. Focus on easier prey first.
---
Upvoted for yOINKS
---
Hypothetically you on PS4?
---
It resets on the 13th of every month. It's not a total reset, but your rank will go down.
---
It's a joke man ,they can try to implement mics
---
My due
---
It's not tunneling if you don't have to drop anything to turn back and hit the injured survivor and rehook them.
---
Dropping a chase to go hit the injured survivor is tunneling, beelining back across the map (particularly on Nurse or Hillbilly) is tunneling.
---
Taking 5 steps from the hook and deciding to down and rehook the injured guy isn't tunneling; you didn't put in any special effort or focus. It's like if you stumbled across two survivors and one was healing the other - hitting the injured one isn't tunneling.
---
I've been getting a shit ton of campers/tunnellers. No survivors seem to want to farm either when i'm playing Killer so i've just been playing normally. Usually swinging at a pallet or a gen is a sign that you want to farm but some may not want to nor understand it so the best way is to just message them.
---
Rub me plz
---
6 to 8 survivors  by the time 1 survivor is taken to the basement to genie's would be done
---
nah, PC
---
As someone who has had the game for 2 weeks I feel this, stuck vsing survivors with hundreds of hours in game. They've got every perk under the sun and I've got nothing and the only way to get anywhere is grinding single killer only
---
Damn, yeah that‚Äôs something I really want to do sometime in the future.
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten that one yet I‚Äôll have to get it one day and see
---
You aren‚Äôt, but the amount of shitty survivors there are nowadays is breathtaking. I‚Äôm okay with doing super well and then dying for my teammates to get out, especially if they did try or whatever, but half the survivors just...don‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm probably being kind of unfair because I have like 2.1k hours so of course I‚Äôm going to be more experienced than a lot of players and have higher expectations because of it, but dear God, if I get chased for 6 fucking minutes and you were waiting for hatch the entire time...let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve had a fair amount of killers sympathize with me about my teammates not doing shit, and I always thank them when they do kill some ‚ÄúDoing gens, you?‚Äù Claudette.
---
Seasons. Real seasons with real season lenghts is the solution. No more keep everything forever. If everyone is the same on day one of the season then no one is playing catchup.
---
I think shes one of the worst killers in the game tbh.
---
Her bear traps never really work unless you tunnel a survivor, and they won't work at all if you use them after end game begins.
---
Her crouch seems cool but its been nerfed so many times that it's just been reduced to a mind gaming tool with the dash.
---
EGC really screwed her over in my opinion
---
Ya know I‚Äôve thought about that but I kinda disagree since if you know this game at all you should know that guess what, leatherface is just not a good killer. That‚Äôs just my two cents
---
It is!
---
Mount Ormand could have portable heat lamps as gens while the game could have timers once end game collapse began showing the count down while bedham could be ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù the shrines freddy has to his victims. I‚Äôd love to see other people‚Äôs ideas! This was an awesome idea really hope it actually happens
---
Well no killer is truly bad. If you cant get a 4k wirh every killer maybe youre not the strongest killer...
---
Actually, it was her vagina, not the ass
---
If you DC you just hurt yourself and reward the killer. Depipping yourself will put you in turd bracket with all other DCers and facecamping killers.
---
Oh shit mb
---
Just do gens.
---
Chances are the perk wouldn‚Äôt be used if didn‚Äôt work at full speed or slow down your rate you bleed out. Even with that buff it would just be a troll perk
---
You can 4k with any killer. Doesn‚Äôt make them a good killer
---
Yeah I know that, but if the Mori were that it would look... "weird" on some Survivors.
---
McMillan since areas in it are a saw mill and junkyard could have auto crushers
---
Ah the good old days
---
Makes you better than people who cant
---
That's what ends up happening with so many of their altruistic perks- it's a neat idea on paper but the way it works renders it underpowered or near useless for the vast majority of situations because the situation is just too niche or reliant. See: Vigil, Autodidact, Solidarity.
---
Try and play for fun if you dont like its current state (ik how u feel playing Killer is very stressful and difficult)
---
Working addons
---
I have issues too but try to stick to actions with animations where you can just shine it the whole time before you book it
---
Gotta get those sweet sweet BPs
---
Amazing concept art! Hope you win. I¬¥m Bing Bong main Iwould love to hace that skin \*\_\*
---
I cant imagine it'd be 5 gens if theres 6 to 8 survivors. Would have to be 8 to 10?
---
All I‚Äôm trying to say is that leatherface isn‚Äôt in a good spot and could use changes. Didn‚Äôt mean to start some stupid slap fight
---
Spirit most definitely has a mindgame counter play, its called get the fuck out of there as soon as she starts standing still. Is she phasing? At least you get some ground on her. Is she not? She has to now walk her ass back over to you. Don't try to outsmart her, it never works. Just book it.
---
No one escapes Keanu
---
Cool. Just got 90000 blood points in one game. Doctor is very cool.
---
Allowing to buy 2 perks at lv50 would be a huge cut to the grind. One can still dream.
---
*Double Blood Points*
---
I‚Äôve restarted it 3 times already, I‚Äôm currently reinstalling the game.
---
u/glenOck
---
Just restart your Xbox, it goes away on reboot.
---
Try hard restart...hold the power button for 10 seconds
---
Because survivors gen rush even more now.
---
Shitty meme from a non player I bet
---
It's only going to be a problem for Ghostface. It's fine otherwise.
---
But stalk progression doesn't reset over time anymore so can he not just almost pop everyone and then snowball? Or is it just any hit /down that it deletes for?
---
This is relatable but eh i usually get yoinked off of gens multiple times. More then once...but i just dont know that they are going to yoink me, because it looks like they are gonna smack me at first but then i get grabbed. :,))))))
---
Play the game how you want. It‚Äôs a game, it‚Äôs supposed to be fun. Ask away
---
You seem bothered to be a part of someones grind.
---
A spirit tried this once with me, but I had a flashlight and I blinded her for trying to fool me.
---
Ok but playing normally will give them twice as much as slugging/camping and tunneling.
---
I did man I unplugged it and everything but I‚Äôll do it again when it‚Äôs reinstalled. Hope it works finally
---
The game has improved a lot, though I don't know when you left.
---
It does, but it still doesn't give as much incentive to do them PRIOR to doing the gens.
---
It's much better to get them after you secure your escape, same with chests.
---
"Wahhh NOED OP, dull totems give you nothing!"
---
Okay, here's a reward for doing dull totems in addition to potentially shutting down NOED.
---
"Wahhh it's still not enough, NOED still OP!!!"
---
This is what y'all sound like.
---
I have such a huge crush on the spirit!
---
That red stain switching on lol
---
Aight I love the banjo. I'm glad he's happy
---
I play how it suits me! me and hundreds of DC lovers :-)))  skskskskskskssksk
---
Get a PS4
---
Some people will say yes, others will say no or ignore you. It‚Äôs a game and at the end of the day you can‚Äôt force someone to play the game a certain way
---
Any hit/down removes stalking progress, but there are those occasions where ghost face has great snowball capability. Like you said, you can 99% groups of survivors and reap the benefits when you enter chases with them, or in lucky scenarios you can stalk several people at once and expose all of them, effectively giving you tier 3 mikey.
---
Nurse looking up at the survivor on the hill: Pathetic
---
Clearly you didn't read what I just said, because nowhere did I say it was op lol
---
Exactly, where exactly is it?
---
Its 100% just a meme
---
Love it.
---
Balanced, as all things should be
---
The neck. That is good to know!
---
I've had like a hot second where the beam widens, is there a time amount that it should be held in place for?
---
At no point did I say my post was only directed at you, either.
---
I mean... yeah. By definition, in a 1v4 game, there are going to be more people playing the group of 4 rather than the 1.
---
Honestly, this answer is somewhat accurate. Unlike a lot of killers, the huntress doesn‚Äôt really need perks or add-ons to help in a chase. Practice the timing on her axes a lot and you‚Äôll do well. She‚Äôs a high tier killer like nurse, but experience makes you a better player than add-ons or perks ever will.
---
This guy just said it in a pretty unhelpful manner.
---
*laughs in nurse*
---
I'm not upset about being part of a "grind" but I am upset because I want some bloodpoints too. Plus the killers would get twice as much BPs for playing normally and it would be a better "grind" for them
---
That definitely helps. I try to learn more by paying attention to the survivors that try to blind me when I play killer but it hasn't worked so far lmao
---
With these kind of posts, helps if you put your age, timezone, and platform.
---
That‚Äôs what I keep telling people who constantly complain about it.
---
&gt;This is what y'all sound like.
---
So why did you comment this at me if it wasnt relevant *to me lol*.
---
Stop back pedaling.
---
And if you plan to use a mic or what not.
---
I feel you man \^-\^
---
Lots of survivors will panic flash without hitting the hit box in the slightest best way to practice is with either just stun locked animations or playing in kill your friends to practice it
---
I think it may have to do with his massive nerf early on. He used to be a vicious god. Honestly I don't know cause I still win matches with him
---
His "ability" literally makes you wait 7 seconds to hit someone.
---
End of story.
---
Im sorry your day was ruined
---
Oi, I made a similar one earlier, it‚Äôs was way shitter than this one, Good job!
---
