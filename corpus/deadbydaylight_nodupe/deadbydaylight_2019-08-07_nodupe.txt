Self care lets you top yourself off when the killer interrupts you mid heal. If you heal right after getting unhooked you don't have to commit to the heal if you have self care, you can just disperse and finish it yourself. You should almost never fully self care yourself back up unless it's a pig, ghostface or wraith and you can get surprise downed by leaving yourself injured.

Why do people think its long i have gotten in gane in 1 or 2 mins 7 times in a row and my internet sucks and im sad because then theres not enough time to wathc reddit
---
NOED is No one escapes death. It is a general killer perk, meaning all killers can learn it. What it does is at the end of the game if there is still a dull totem it will become hex totem giving all survivors the exposed status and allowing the killer to down them in one hit until the hex is cleansed.
---
Pebbles are for a unique perk for Adam. You have to spend a certain amount of time in the killer's terror radius to use it. Then it is just a secondary action

I'm relaxed while I play Trapper...but everybody else makes lean in.

But then you lose any future sped up progression by foregoing another addon.

And heavens forbid if a killer has Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Does Ghost Face‚Äôs Drop-leg Knife Sheath (the one that considerably increase crouch movement speed) make him move faster than base movement speed?
---
Weird... if you had two safe unhooks, a chase, a hex totem and a gen, you really should not have lost a pip. Something is wrong indeed.
---
Decisive strike? Never happening? One of the most common perks to see at high ranks? Countering that by itself makes Moris the best offering by far. Flashlight saves and sabotage are rare, but you can't deny it's one of many reasons moris are so powerful. 
---
It is absolutely fair to call someone using Moris a bad player. Anyone that knows how to exploit it can end the game extremely quickly. No other offering has as much of an impact as an early mori does.
---
If you want to show some kindness to the killer, its a good idea to rapidly crouch after you pallet stun them. Its like saying, "I appreciate you killer. Thank you for the friendly match." You can also do this at the edge of the exit gate, as a sort of friendly goodbye.
---
Look at their Twitter.
---
Other games working fine
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Right?! I feel like I‚Äôm constantly on the go, no matter which killer I‚Äôm playing as. Patrol the gens, smack and hook survivors, (re)set traps, mindgame loopers, etc. on top of all the individual tasks that come with each killer power.
---
Just needs more blood
---
Nah
---
Ive tried using the fast hit and i see them but it still doesnt always connect, havent tried movin backwards tho :)
---
Just because it was fast for you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fast for everyone else. For a lot of people, it takes a long time to find a match as killer

i get op saying that they did actually tunnel, but you have the same info I have. From what we see, she gets off after the camp, escapes, someone gets hit, loses them, then goes after OP again. Op confirms in thread, but we didnt know without that confirmation

Billy isn‚Äôt really simple especially at higher ranks
---
Dunno, man. You can dodge sure, but during primetime it seems like 70-80% of my killer lobbies are SWF groups. I've definitely had queues where I dodge a few times and end up saying fuck it because it's taking 10m+ to find a lobby with less than 3 swf.
---
Just a bunch of garbage, again.. yay.. The only somewhat decent one is Flip-Flop.
---
Why would you leave the safest place on the map
---
Imagine stealing people's content and then acting like a complete asshat when someone points it out. Get bent dude.
---
If you don't focus on one task, ie, going for unhooks, running the killer around, or doing gems, you'll find yourself popping more. Past like rank 10, doing gens, hiding, and then escaping just doesn't cut it anymore.
---
I believe to double pip in the high ranks, you need to do like 1 or 2 full gens, have the killer chase you for essentially a full gen and then some, unhook two people (or heal a bunch) and escape.
---
I honestly don't get 360'd successfully often as when I swing it just kinda locks on and hits them that or I just move back a bit then smack them. Just walk back a little as 360s only work when they're close that or Auto aim fucks them.
---
I'm a killer main, actually. I find spirit boring to play as and infuriating to play against. And don't get me started on prayer beads.
---
Maybe read past the first two lines of my comment. Literally the next thing I say is that DS is pretty common. I'd laugh at you but this sort of thing has happened too often with illiterate redditors to be considered funny anymore. 
---
Also, the fact that moris counter DS doesn't really make them broken. DS isn't all that good of a perk. If the killer tunnels you, it's useful then sure, but a killer tunneling you detriments themselves more than it does the 4 survivors. 
---
Personally, I don't use moris because I want to face FOUR survivors rather than face 2 people who haven't DC'd, but in the current meta, moris actually fit the expected game time seeing as survivors finish gens very fast. Moris are probably tied with Nurse as the only real means of leveling the playing field.
---
Lmao such a baby.

Isn't it also done to stop the gen from regressing?

Lol some people will claim they did a gen if they just finish it.

There should be ranks from 15 to 1 and bronze, silver, gold and iridescent, and rank reset happen every 6 months, then ranks would matter, right now is too many people in the same place

oh man. my worst offense ever, you're right.

Well thats ur opinion and ur entitled to it, i rather fight a spirit than mothefucking ghostface for example, and i just enjoy her while hate to play other killers like bubba or the bing bong boi

Once you play killer and lose because you couldn't get a down on a survivor that used an insta heal, you will realise how bullshit insta heals are. It can drastically ruin your game just cause you couldn't get the pressure from 1 hook because an instaheal gave them a 2nd chance.
---
There are clearly toxic players on both sides. Who is out there saying it's only one side and that the other is perfect?
---
in my defense, I've been trying to delete it since someone pointed out that it's a repost. oi vey.
---
If they put Kira in the game I would be so happy. Of course, they'd need to make Josuke a survivor
---
That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make you any better, you‚Äôre just as much as a toxic POS as u/Pegres , stop trying to kid yourself
---
What if you're at the top of rank 1?
---
That's the thing. I'm not too sure how to strategize the chainsaw. And its not just the congested maps, I'm terrible in all of them. I've heard terms like "chainsaw feathering" thrown around but I don't know how to use them or even what they are. The way I'm looking at it the chainsaw is near useless unless I learn how to be a curve God (which I don't even think is possible on controller) or unless the survivors run in a near straight line (which is never the case in green ranks+). I just don't really think he's for me.
---
Curb stomping red ranks is fun.
---
I doubt it very much, Gface is 25% slower when he's crouching, that addon probably makes him only 5% or 10% faster than the usual crouch speed
---
Take things slowly. When they 360, you‚Äôre likely pressed up right against them. Aka they‚Äôre not getting away unless you miss your swing and they have time to run. Go really slow and find the spot where they mess up. Alternatively, instead of lunging and swinging, make sure your body is pressed against them and do a quick swing.
---
When you get more advanced at it and want to try lunging, as they spin, lunges and spin your camera in the same direction they‚Äôre spinning.
---
We were playing kill your friends our killer literally said he‚Äôd be right back. Both my friends self healed while I struggled on the hook
---
When someone actually cleanses
---
Nah if you unplug the survivors win because they‚Äôve obliterated and humiliated you to the point where you have to actually break the game just to make yourself feel like you‚Äôre good at the game
---
I want Okuyasu in DBD, and Josuke. Of course, Kira would be a new killer
---
or we read it and disagree...
---
Switch out shadowborn. Use Ruin, M&amp;A, or Bamboozle instead.
---
&gt;  If The Broken Stay Broken were to be cleansed during the trial all injured survivors lose the broken status but all survivors keep half of the healing speed reduction for the remainder of the trial.
---
Does it mean just self healing actions? or all healing actions overall? cause if it is the latter, then Sloppy butcher would become useless.
---
I'll still buy it to play on the go and on breaks but I really wish we had BHVR accounts and cross progression so I could carry my Xbox progress over...
---
Meh I'll kill em next time (when I take my chainsaw and rada rada rada)
---
&gt;Waaah the killer removed me from the game where literally his sole objective is to remove survivors from the game.
---
Well if it helps you shouldn't activate chainsaw mid chase all the time if you can get a hit with your main weapon go for it. When they hear the chainsaw starting up. Their most likely going to start running in different directions because you immediately start a Sprint forward if you prefer getting up close and personal then using the chainsaw bubba might be a better fit. he dosent Sprint forward but just slashes it left and right.  Regardless practice playing him and you'll get better or use his add ons that make steering easier.
---
I get that the status says that, but other games are totally operational. 
---
This game is straight up unlaunchable right now.
---
My idea was all healing action I may need to put in a caveat saying healing reduction can't be more than 25% after its broken. Sloppy would still have its niche place with the hemerage effect.
---
You can still double pip at rank 1, you just don't level up.
---
What most survivors do is fake to one side and then 360 or straight up they dont fake and just 360. So once you know which type of survivor you are against, you start aiming at the middle of the place you predict them to be and their actual place making tracking so easy, at least for me.
---
Also increase your sensitivity
---
Personally I hope it gets changed to where you can open a gate with an X% increase and/or have the ability to open the hatch after the killer closes it with a moderate interaction time since there are some gates that spawn too closely and the killer just camps them waiting for the lights to pop up. I hope its soon too because i enjoyed this perk as an insurance perk.
---
*Downvotes you*
---
Nea because I have perks that I like on her, I like the cosmetics I have on her, and I honestly think she's cute.
---
Doctor is the main killer I play literally only because I like his suit skin and I think his ability is kind of fun.
---
You have to understand that this game is a game about mere seconds. A few secpnds one way or the other can completely change the outcome or flow of a game. As such, even if a survivor spawns in ON TOP of ruin, and cleanses it without interruptions, that is at the very least 14 seconds of time that survivor is not on a gen, and even more time if the other survivors are either looking for it or working through it. Even working through, it saves a couple seconds by simply not allowing greats to happen. So at the least, probably around 16 seconds saved with the killer doing absolutely NOTHING. If it lasts longer it can save minutes. With even 16 seconds, you can have a chance to get the first down, and proceed to the next survivor on a gen, meaning that at most only survivor can pop a gen. Ruin is incredibly strong for that reason alone, as it requires the killer to do absolutely nothing for at least 16 seconds of free time. The only other perk that even kinda does that is corrupt intervention, which has a set timer, and therefore cannot last as long as ruin might. The math simply favors ruin over other gen slowing perks.
---
I like Jake and Pig
---
I play solo survivor so I like to be stealthy. And for pig shes a meme
---
Been down for a few hours üòû
---
Odd
---
I was referring to when the killer leaves chat after saying we are toxic swf (which is the way I interpreted the meme). I don't swf 95% of the time.  I think it is hilarious that they are blaming their faults on a team of solo que survivors that just happened to so well together. If they are already talking shit they are interested in the shitshow. I don't care if they leave straight away after a match.
---
They have both dummy

On Xbox 1 what is the secondary action button?

---
Let's be real tho, the perk makes pipping so easy I love it
---
Xbox servers are down
---
Considering sloppy is 20%, and this would max at 25%, that would make the normal 16 second heal into a 26 second heal.. 52 second self care. That is stupidly long. Wouldn't be surpirsed if people just dc'd if they got hit by this (if it were to be added)

Bubba I've played a bit of to get BBQ, but I also understand that bubba is not a very good killer because his chainsaw is fairly limited. For me hillbilly is just about the same with a decent bit more mobility, but what I can't understand is people calling hillbilly one of the best killers because of that mobility. I suppose my confusion stems from my personal experience but I still can't understand it. Like I said, I suppose chainsaw killers just aren't for me.

And I get that but that's not what I was referring to.

I never voluntarily DC. But some SWF groups tempt me a whole lot lol.

---
I've been playing at high purple and low red ranks the last few weeks as survivor and honestly I'm more concerned when there isn't a Ruin up. That usually indicates to me I'm playing against someone with a super optimized build and also knows how to play their Killer well.
---
Other way for me, if I'm doing trash as killer i can just camp and secure a kill or rely on NOED, but as survivor you mess up and your dead. Your crutches are your teammates which aren't always good
---
The Candy Man. Imagine shooting bees out of your mouth to hinder survivors. 
---
 Frank from the OG slasher Maniac. Imagine being chased by a guy crying for his dead mommy. Like the huntress humming or the lullaby. 
---
 The Tall Man from Phantasm. He‚Äôs just creepy as fuck.
---
As survivor, you only have one thing to worry about.  As killer, you have FOUR of them.
---
This has nothing to do with my argument. You're talking about very specific tactics and assuming that every killer plays a certain way, which is not my point at all.
---
Them Claudettes...
---
Well this is...less than ideal...
---
This is all in the past all ya need now is some good swf
---
Also it's a clutch when you're about to pop a gen as you get more skill checks so it gets done faster (I think)
---
No. The Puppet Combo dev team is actually reliable.
---
By squat are you meaning you dropped a pallet then tbagged the killer or you crouched and looked/nodded at the killer? Just that things like that are often done by toxic players so its why most killers will then tunnel that person down.
---
I am as well
---
Yeah, I'm sort of realizing that how you handle 360s on console and PC are really different. On PC, you can lunge and track them through their motions because the finer control you have with a mouse allows it.
---
But console, it feels like a really weak point for the game, but I've only played like six killer games total. On the other side, the actual motions of a 360 are easier to do on console, I've noticed.
---
I see. But if the survivors messing around make it unfun for the killer, wouldn‚Äôt it be the same level of unfun for the killer if the skilled survivors start to try hard?
---
I play pig and I need to do a KYF sometime to test the cone of Spine Chill, I'll turn my camera slightly away from a gen while approaching it to stop spine chill from activating but idk if it's enough
---
So I unistalled for nothin? üò¨
---
Yes, there has been multiple threads about this. Xbox service is down at the moment.
---
That's always the best. When their angers makes full circle and they start attacking each other
---
it literally is that. If gens are being done too fast it's because the killer is bad.
---
The problem currently with gens is the default 80 seconds even without any sort of boosts, is too fast. Any other misuse of the term is killers complaining about them losing.
---
I never get frustrated as survivor, namely because if I die, I know it's because I messed up, my team messed up, or the killer was a dick, and I'm okay with all three of those. I get frustrated as killer sometimes, but only when I'm playing weaker killers, because sometimes it feels like the game was completely out of my control. Happened yesterday when I tried playing clown.
---
Yeah I play on Xbox and this is happening to me too but it usually doesn't last that long so we can only wait.
---
lmfaoooooooooo
---
The frames are worse on console so it's easier for them to abuse your camera.
---
I use it for mobility and at chases in open spaces.
---
What i mean by freeze time it's the time you need to wait to use your power again, idk if there's a terminology for this.

Hangman‚Äôs trick, flip-flop, boil over, beast of prey
---
Lmao! I am going to share this with my friends.
---
No I meant they would only stack together to a max of 25% even with both, not 45%. So even together it would be 16 to 20 and 32 to 40. If the totem was active at the 50% full strength it would be 16 to 24 and 32 to 48. Sloppy wouldn't stack past 25%. So if you combine these perks once you get even 1 token all sloppy effectively does is give hemerrage. 12.5% + 20% in this situation would only be 25% because sloppy wouldnt combine with it more than 25%. Sorry for the confusion.
---
I mean, most survivors are going to pop any totem they see, shiny or not, so I don't think cleansing time should be factored into the argument as there are five totems and experienced survivors tend to try to cleanse them all to avoid NOED.
---
The thing about the time factor is that would be assuming that all survivors are always either on gens or being chased. The immersive type survivors don't care about perks like Corrupt Intervention because they're busy scouting in the early game. Ruin only really effects aggressive survivors, the immersed ones can essentially take the game hostage and drag it out as long as they want. 16 seconds is nothing to urban evading Blendettes who wait to see the killer pass them by before touching anything.
---
I'm not saying that your argument is invalid, but it's not necessarily applicable to every trial and scenario.

I play David King mostly, and tbh I don't play a lot of killer. I'm decent at Huntress, but I want to play Nurse or Spirit
---
This x1000
---
Yep
---
Ecentially yes. Even if theyre not trying to be mean it can be unfun for a killer to be outclassed by the survivors. Its the nature of a skill based game matchmaking isnt perfect with any game so occasionally survivors that are too above the killer will match together and somtimes its because a SWF team of lets say a 15 and a 3 are together which will bring the 3 down to the lower ranks instead of bringing the 15 up to the 7 or 5 killers.

I was rank 8 and hosting with a rank 11 friend who had been rank 6-7 but played less post-reset (two-person SWF).
---
Ended up with two other survivors and a killer, all rank 14.
---
Whoever is hosting doesn't automatically get a killer of their own rank, I guess?
---
You get banned if you let people take it too many times.

I‚Äôve tested this. So it doesn‚Äôt use your offering. It just gets added back to your item inventory, at least for PS4.

Just don‚Äôt run through more than 2 pallets, If he walks around one try to reuse it, Additionally looping is not the same as running pallet to pallet.

But I can't throw 5 feet from a rock or car and have it not count as a hit.
---
People think that instead of using Self Care, you should bring Bond (to find others to heal you), Iron Will (to be silent while working on generators), Botany Knowledge (for medkit efficiency) and Adrenaline (to get healed after all five gens popped) and a medkit (never a flashlight/key/toolbox/map).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They don't care that reaching someone with Bond at maximum range takes 9 seconds and may take longer if no one is in range, sprinting and bleeding and leaving scratch marks the entire time, and then requires doing nothing for 16 seconds, and forces someone else to stop doing something for 16 seconds. (**41 seconds spent among all survivors at least**).
---
They also don't care that Self Care only takes 32 seconds from all survivors, and can be done anywhere you want to heal without leaving scratchmarks/blood all over the map, and lets you heal up where survivors have no reason to be in order to avoid Nurse's Calling.
---
And they don't care that instead of running four perks and a specific item that can be expended or knocked out of your hands, you're only running one perk, so you pick any other three you want AND any item you want.
---
Basically Self Care gets a lot of undeserved hate, and people try to justify it by saying "what if Spirit?" or "Bond is good"; well Bond is good, but you can run Bond+SC+Adrenaline+Spine Chill with a toolbox if you want instead, no need to go Iron Will and Botany Knowledge.
---
**TL;DR: People don't understand how Self Care saves time overall and want to dictate that survivors are only allowed to use one item (medkit) and four perks (Bond/Iron Will/Botany Knowledge/Adrenaline) and nothing else is allowed at all, ever, for any reason.**
---
Depends on the day. Typically it‚Äôs Dwight, because for some reason I think he looks like James Gunn and I just can‚Äôt get over that. He‚Äôs also got Ellis‚Äôs shirt now, who I also love. I love Nea just because I like her aesthetics, and sometimes I play Jake because I like sabotaging hooks. But I just got Quintin and Tapp today, so I‚Äôve been playing a lot of them.
---
As for killers... I‚Äôve only been on the killer side like, 3 times. (I‚Äôm still fairly new to the game.) But I guess Freddy because Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite horror movie series?

No, it's on the Login screen. Not the xbox server stuff as I have been getting this glitch for the past 2 months
---
the past few days, I watched the matchmaking of 15 games I played. in those, 2 of them were not 4 man SWFs, and 13 of them were SWFs with at least 2 red ranks. this was when I was still rank 10
---
*yet*

I would if I had him. Don't have the money to buy him at the moment :(

---
Glad it isn‚Äôt just me...
---
Oof, forgot that PC players don‚Äôt get him for free
---
She‚Äôs a lot of fun to vs
---
Definitely goes for killers as well, a lot of salt there too.
---
For clarification, I mean when you get to the login screen, then after loading some stuff it just slaps you with the error in-game.
---
Yep, same issue here. Been down for sure since about 2hrs ago on my end. Honestly things loke this make me wish I owned it on other platforms as well. I just want my DBD fix!
---
Heaven forbid if a Killer manages to hook someone and comes to your gen to kick it before you manage to finish it with a 25% head start.
---
The simple fact of the matter is that a Brand New Part does 25% of the gen without using *any* charges on the toolbox. This means that if you have a Brown toolbox you'll have 25% of the charges after doing the gen.
---
Just sit back, relax, and let Spirit with NOED and Ruin do the rest
---
Playing Ghostface I lean when I stalk because it makes me stalk them better. This is a fact.
---
I still do this on nurse every time I come out of a blink and lunge lol
---
Just updated and it‚Äôs live
---
In that instance, which is annoyingly more common than I wish it was, aggressive perks are ideal, but even in fast games with aggressive survivors I value perks like MYC a lot more to apply pressure on survivors rather than just temporarily stalling them a little bit when they're the ones who dictate whether it'll be a quick or long game.
---
Pop is amazing, one of the best perks in the game IMO, the mid-late game pressure it applies in unparalleled. Against aggressive survivors it slows their progress, and against immersive survivors it hard punishes them for not doing gens quickly and forces them to come out of hiding and do gens, or suffer the consequences of their immersion.
---
So we just going let a 360 happen? Ok buddy
---
No, because I have DBD on disc and it still gives me that error.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you only got downvoted because you sounded really condescending.
---
r/nooneasked
---
Not the xbox issue, it's an in-game issue
---
Are you sure this is dbd?
---
How am I being hypocritical? I literally said noed was fine. I didn't say anything was unfair. And you just proved the point to my entire post. "Just because it is in the game doesn't mean it has to be used" Says who? Says you? And your own imaginary rulebook? Go ahead and use your insta-saws and your prayer beads and your tombstones and your insta down hatchets. That's why it's in the game. To be used. It's also why these things have an ultra rare rarity because the devs understand they are strong.
---
we just need our piggy getting the buff she deserves
---
Go for safe unhooks, do gens and cleanse
---
T
---
My killer main is Ghostface cause I love Scream and am pretty good at playing as him. My survivor main is Bill because he gives me lots of  nostalgia to my days playing Left 4 Dead.
---
If it said camping killers then yes. Waiting out a 360 or dead hard is playing smart
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cmzd8j/cant_play_on_xbox_one_for_some_reason/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That's paranoia. Statistics that the devs released showed that like 4% of your games are 4 man SWF.
---
Yeah they changed something that really messed with a lot of people no doubt they already know about it and are finding a solution even if it is a quick fix.
---
I think the Killer should be able to smack the gate switch to power them and activate the Collapse instead of having the Hatch open when there is only one Survivor left. Hitting the switch again will open the gate. If the Killer does not power the gates within 1-2 minutes, then the Collapse will automatically begin. The last Survivor cannot get an undeserved escape as easily because the Hatch won‚Äôt spawn until at least two gens have been completed.
---
As a survivor main who picked up killer in the last three months:
---
Where did you get this picture of me from?
---
...360'ing is what makes you bad at the game.
---
it means your just an idiot spinning in a circle in the injured state instead of running away to your next loop.
---
I only wish spirit didn‚Äôt have collision while phasing. That seems really cheap to me, to be able to bump into someone and get them instead of having to track them through blood and scratch marks
---
Highest I've ever been was 14 but I usually play black out but I broke my hand so I suck at black out
---
As a survivor main I know the main objective is to do gens, but they both have more than one objective. As survivor you have to do gens, rescue survivors and with the big NOES debate cleanse totems. Not saying either is more or less stressful, but they both have a lot going on.
---
Legion is probably the weakest killer in the game now that Freddy got reworked.
---
That and ‚Äúsurvivor stays marked longer‚Äù
---
Because we need more trans representation!
---
Each week it manages to get worse. Last week's at least had some niche uses. This one is basically useless against anyone with even a slight amount of skill
---
Mate, it‚Äôs just a good fucken perk

---
Thank you

r/dadbydaylight
---
they all join at the same time, they‚Äôre overly coordinated, and only one is actually around my rank? surely paranoia
---
There‚Äôs not exactly a loop more than 50% of the time, good sir
---
Likely due to the current map environment just having nothing to save you or the fact some teammates see instant win escapes in the place of pallets and windows.
---
Yep tried this already hours ago. Didn't work then but tried again just now and nope still not working. Not sure what to do other than to wait it out.
---
Could we see the full chat?
---
When a comment gets more likes than the post.
---
Thats what i always do
---
Was gonna ask the same thing lol
---
It's still a fucking bug and you CAN'T Dead Hard when you have this bug.
---
This post‚Äôs downvotes are a prime example of the ignorance in this sub. Very well written post even though I like ruin, I might start using other perks now.
---
Mine just started working hopefully yours will follow!
---
Dude I play every thing this way.  Even Jurassic World Evolution.
---
I didn't know he was free on console until now lol
---
Thank you ^^
---
Always upvote a jojo's reference.
---
My brain wants me to believe that your 3D printer was grunting every now and then while printing this.
---
Yes
---
Fuk off that's bullshit the worst killer is Freddy
---
Makes way more sense now.
---
Your post gave me an idea, so not increase % bc it'd be like wakeup but instead hide the lights on the door until you get like 15%/25%/40% so that the lone survivor has a better chance at escape.   Maybe adjust the %, but it would be a great change.
---
Why do you care
---
You can tell when BBQ is finish when the bubble around the hook disappears.
---
You should play killer more then.
---
I have to say I've never hit 4 red Emblems in one match as survivor.  I've come close.  But in order to do that you're required to do gens, make saves, heal teammates, get in chases, win those chases without being downed, and survive the match.  Not only are all of those things NECESSARY, but they are necessary a couple times over. lol  The closest I've ever been was ruined by being downed as I tried went to open exit gates because the other 3 survivors decided they wanted to farm with the killer and sandbagged me so he could down me.  Even your own teammates will ruin you trying to max bloodpoints ON PURPOSE.
---
People don't 360 after a hit, they do it as a last result if there are no windows or pallets. Even high skill survivors like usylis/noob/zubat do it as a last resort.
---
I could see Furtive Chase being a tunneling combo if combined with STBFL or PWYF.
---
It also can help Legion when combined with Monitor &amp; Abuse as having little to no terror radius makes the survivors have to mend at a shorter distance.
---
Every time I see a shrine I say "this is the worst one" and then a week passes and I say it again.
---
Exactly. Survivor head, maybe add an Ace style grin onto them, and then just stretch the red jumpsuit over the survivors model.
---
It's not MY job to know what causes it, I can't open the application on PS4 or PC and check what spaghetti coding is causing this to happen.
---
I've reported it millions of times with video and in game reports and NO ONE is talking about it?
---
It's not mentioned, every developer is pretending it doesn't exist, why?
---
Why the fuck is no one within the development talking about this bug?
---
Mad-grit is broken, haha thats a good one.
---
Halloween ll is canon
---
I thought the clown was the one with bamboozle??
---
Why though
---
Have you read the news
---
I did report.
---
I know they dont do it after the hit, they do it before the hit in an attempt to dodge it.
---
However, y'all are not Noob and Zubat, and majority of the time you just squander your sprint burst trying to get yourself out of your 360 and back on a path to a pallet.
---
I get 360'd maybe once by every other survivor a match, an it's always on the first hit/down as I'm seeing what kind of survivor I'm playing against. 
---
Once I know you'll try to 360, you'll never land it again because I'll always expect it. Kinda like Dead hard, it only works the first time(unless your using it to get to pallets).
---
false
---
Gamer stance
---
If your on xbox the servers are down for purchased content
---
His mori is killer queen blowing you up and taking your hand.
---
Head on is best when coordinated in SWF, in which case it's far better than sprint burst.
---
DBD is broken on most Xboxs right now, blame Xbox Live
---
Rada rada, rada rada rada. Rada.
---
Yeah of course.
---
I had this game just THIS MORNING.  My team must have been a 3-man SWF because every. single. time one of them went down, another went down right beside him.  Then the third would unhook one of them, and go down as well.  Rinse and fucking repeat.  Meanwhile I decided to mind my own damn business and avoid that mess.  Got down to 1 gen left when I accidentally stepped in a trap.  Had avoided/disarmed them the entire match and hadn't been seen at all up to that point.  Died on my first hook, of course.
---
Sitting down for a nice game of killer vs when the survivors t-bag at loops
---
What's worse is that some figured out how to use  sprint burst on command
---
While earning my adept nurse trophy on console, I went from rank 6 all the way to rank 15, unintentionally :D
---
The bug happens to anyone, and everyone.
---
You cannot Self Heal, Dead Hard, MEND, or SNAP OUT OF IT if you're facing the Doctor.
---
If you get hit with Borrowed Time, you can't mend from that either. You can't Exit the Gates, you have to find the Hatch to escape.
---
Flashlights, or Dying doesn't cause the bug.
---
As a rank 4 legion i can tell u he is weak with the wrong build
---
Out of bounds. Instead of escaping, you're outside the map and can't escape instead of the hatch. You can run around the map though.
---
Do a gen, heal someone, get chased briefly, done.
---
Anyone? No? Ok Here I go.
---
Nice bait.
---
So heal them?
---
Yeah what they said, you have to kinda move backwards and swing with their spin.
---
Pull the trigger, from my experience that is a good price
---
This is probably the best "killer as a survivor" suggestion I've seen. Bonus points because I legitimately enjoyed that movie.
---
Touch it, I dare you
---
- Definitely not a Huntress
---
8 bucks is a steal. This is a game you can sink hubdreds of thousands of hours into and still want more. Absolutely worth it. I have bought every killer and survivor (even though i dont play survivor) just to keep supporting this amazing game.
---
The best stalk on the block
---
I was rank 8 survivor got matched with a rank 2, 17, and 14, killer was rank 11
---
I'm always a little dumbfounded when people don't run either Spine Chill or Premonition.  I'll be on a genny with someone, and when my Premo goes off I walk away and hide behind a rock.  Said teammate doesn't often take the hint, and ends up with a Ghostface guts deep before he knew what happened.
---
Why are we not finding this?
---
Because killer is host, sometimes desync plays into it as well. You could be facing the wall on your screen but not on theirs, so they still get the blind.
---
No one said otherwise, everyone keep saying they use it when they are about to go down no matter what. I don't know why you talking about wasting a sprint burst or anything of the sort.
---
That's the point.  They immediately run from the hook towards the killer's location.  If they are that stupid they aren't worth chasing after.
---
Did you sing that?
---
Pretty sure they're implementing a punishment.
---
I just want to learn huntress but stuff like this keeps happening lol
---
Spirit and Billy lookin good right now :)
---
It's not just DBD having issues today. Sea of Thieves is having widespread server issues and so is Overwatch in some reigons
---
Oh I took blowing up like you're on a gen.  Got it now
---
You need to spot those invisible claudettes.
---
Please purchase more AC to gain locker and pallet textures
---
Didn't Quinton deal with freddy though? That's pretty insane in my book
---
~When you're farming an afk killer and they start moving again~. 
---
  
---
When I read this comment.
---
Yes and no. You can tap a gen once to stop the regression, but the term "gen tapping" refers to just spamming m1 on it to avoid skill checks.
---
Is this a new perk?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the hag without the entity‚Äôs power be pretty weak?
---
I would pay good money for kira and josuke to be in the game, just for the sake of having them. That or cosmetics for someone to look like them
---
No it‚Äôs good, I thought I was impressive how much work you put into thisüëçüèª campers are the worst
---
Wait do lockers stop bbq &amp; chilli?
---
I've seen my share of salty game communities, as much as I enjoy this game, it's community is both the most toxic and saltiest. You win, salty/toxic message. You lose in any way, same thing. It's absurd.
---
Thank you üòä
---
It‚Äôs the opposite for me, for some reason, losing as survivor just feels so much more like losing. As killer, I feel like I‚Äôm not as pressured because I don‚Äôt have anyone relying on me. Only when I‚Äôm getting chased as survivor of course. That‚Äôs just me though.
---
Yea it gives the blindness effect so no one can see your aura and you can't see anyone elses
---
Yeah you become hidden when you enter a locker
---
Yeah
---
NOED is a bad choice for sure
---
Bummer. The one night I had the chance to play this week!
---
Yeah, I sure love going against stealth killers with it, but the problem is that to use Spine chill, you have to open hand of WAY more powerful perks, like a adrenaline or a DS for example, so most people rather play without it, thay's why since the release of Spine chill, it never changed, it's not a comom problem, like old MoM, it was a problem, but because every match had one, then it was a really problem
---
I like to squint while I use Spirit's phasewalk. I have no idea why.
---
I agree she is unfun to face, but i disagree she is worst than nurse. Both are the most unfun to play against tho.
---
[Picture was taken from Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redpandas/comments/cl5uqn/my_favourite_picture_of_red_panda_twins_born_in/?st=jz0n9p4h&amp;sh=7ef2cbfc) of the two new Red Panda cubs from the Nyiregyhaza Animal Park. Before you get worried, the mom is totally fine with the keepers holding her children, she's just upset that she's not getting any attention or apples from them.
---
Opposite for me but I never give a shit when I play killer.
---
Keep trying. Eventually it worked for me.
---
From my experience the hatchets that go straight through survivors only happens whenever my hatchet is fully charged
---
ü§ó
---
Depending on your rank and role, it gets a bit more convoluted the more you go up. Sometimes getting a pip requires you to exist more vs do more. As survivor, you want to capitalize on your lightbringer and Unbroken. Do the gen and avoid getting hooked. If you get Iridicent Unbroken you‚Äôre basically gonna black pip every game and get a heal off for more benevolent and maybe get a totem or two in. 
---
As killer you have four people who give you points and emblem towards. If you want to secure pips, avoid killers with instadown because that‚Äôs less malicious emblem. Legion, despite their lack of interesting power, can still get some hella crazy malicious in because of their power being non-lethal but still generates to your malicious and chaser. Gatekeeper is fucking busted because gens can just be done too quickly and Devout cares more about hooking than killing. Try to two hook everyone and just keep smacking them. Slug when appropriate because that keeps people off generators to heal back up. Pray to the elder gods.
---
I mean you hear the noise cue for a totem being destroyed. If u don‚Äôt get exposed I would assume it‚Äôs ruin.
---
Yes, lockers make your aura invisible to BBQ.
---
Open dbd from manage game after quitting.  No idea why but that works I guess
---
Or else he tunnels next game he finds you
---
It‚Äôs exactly how survivors feel when they get hit with Franklin demise.
---
Disgusted.
---
Anyone else find themselves grinning or leaning in when you know you've got the survivor dead to rights?
---
How are they changing it? Any details or just a notice that there working on it?
---
I know what the bug is but that not my point. If the Devs asked you to recreate the bug for them so they can see, could you provide a reliable way to cause it?
---
I love it :D great job!
---
F
---
Thank you!!
---
One dull totem will be lit as the last generator is fully repaired. Following is the killer instantly knocking survivors to dying state, unless the totem is cleansed. NOED can be prevented by cleansing all totems
---
Puppet Combo themed cosmetics/maps would be really cool, but I'm not sure how someone would actually get that to happen.
---
Would Puppet Combo want their stuff in DbD? Would BHVR want to work with them?
---
Lowkey one big reason I like Pig. Not only is the game dramatically slower due to the RBTs, but whenever you crouch the music cuts out completely and you can just chill listening for survivors or gens. Really relaxing in a weird way. 
---
Plus you can oink at survivors, an underrated great part of the game.
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs very minuscule but overall you‚Äôll feel like old legion vaulting again. I did notice some entity blocking issues last time I tried it but it should be usable still.
---
You probably mean well by writing that up. But really, it‚Äôll be a better advice to not waste shards.
---
I really want to see gameplay footage because I think you just run inside a locker and the killer goes to it since they're following scratch marks. Getting a head on hit like that is fine I guess but now you're exhausted and you cant stun them again.
---
I can't help but feel you're the person making tons of noise and hiding in lockers all game rather than doing gens.
---
Farming with ALL survivors isn‚Äôt against the rules. But when you play a game normally and then decide to farm with the last person then yeah it is against the rules. You send a clip in and it shows the killer working with that one survivor after they killed everyone else it looks like they‚Äôre working together regardless of whether they are or not. The entire point of attaching video to a report is that it‚Äôs evidence. The killer can say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know them. I was just trying to be nice‚Äù all day but they don‚Äôt your feelings or claims into account. From what the video shows you worked with one survivor and let them live long after you killed everyone else.
---
I‚Äôm speaking from personal experience. This guy asked me and the other survivors to farm. We all agreed. Things were going smoothly and then he decided to screw us over and started killing us and yet still decided to farm with the last survivor for a good 8-10 minutes after he killed the rest of us. I messaged him telling him he was wrong for that. He told me to get over it and have a few excuses why he started killing us so I politely informed him I was gonna report him. Explained the entire situation in a support ticket, sent video evidence. About a week later I get an expletive filled message from the same guy. He‚Äôd gotten a temp ban for working with a survivor. My point being that selectively farming CAN get you banned, at least temporarily.
---
Me:Oh no 
---
My pp:OH YEAH

Also:

When you see someone with TTV in their name
---
Bruh
---
1000 points coming my way!
---
So come up with a different title
---
Personally, I think it should just give 6%/9%/12% extra speed for actions such as healing, repair, exit gate opening, etc for each dead person. I know that people argue that left behind sounds like a perk that activates when everyone else is dead, but  argue that you can say the same thing about sole survivor, another perk that sounds like it would activate at the end of the trial when everyone else is dead.
---
It works similar to huntress' lullaby, it's directional when you're barely in the radius, but eventually it's impossible to tell, leaving you to try to listen for soft spirit footsteps over the super loud WHOOOOOSH noise.

Thanks I hate it
---
We really need to appreciate the raincoat cultists more. Part 4 did them wrong.
---
Oh YEAH PP TIME
---
Like Claudette would be anywhere then a bush
---
You just gave every survivor the solution: Don't look for Ruin and do gens instead. If the killer, in this scenario Trapper, is setting up around the hex and defending it, gens are gonna get done assuming survivors aren't as scared if Ruin as they are of the killer. Survivors who feed killers by being drawn to the shiny like a moth to a flame aren't very good to begin with, you probably don't need Ruin to beat survivor dominoes.
---
iirc Feral Frenzy does not change window vaults at all, it grants the ability to vault pallets, and bamboozle does not effect pallets.
---
Where‚Äôd you get that from?
---
It's like going in with a 4 stack and facing someone called "moonwalk Meyers" or something and NOT having fun.
---
What about offerings? If it says "75% more bloodpoints in the devious category", and I already have 8000 max. Do I get and additional 8000*.75 blood points from the post match bonus?
---
Self-care is a counter to self-care, they're literally wasting their time and a perk slot when they could have done a gen, used a medkit, got healed by someone else
---
Boosted killers are just people who swing on everything. They don't respect pallets and generally they are the easiest killers to loop because they never slow down enough to fool you. Noob3's survivor videos always showcase boosted killers because they're hilarious.
---
Now do it with rivals' bones
---
For me it feels like  there's 3. the third is a hit that definitely should not have hit but hits anyway
---
Idea: increased speed after all survivors dead. Like the haste status effect.
---
Yes they hide you when I hook someone, BBQ-Chili will show me where you are outside a 40 meter range. Before they added lockers as a safe space, I could see people in them and it was easy pickings! 
---
But those days are long gone.
---
We have wraith, trapper, doctor, hag, huntress and nurse free.
---
I do believe there are ways to make nurse higher skill, I remember someone mentioning that if nurse charges her 2nd blink and let's herself fatigue instead of blink, she should take the fatigue of the 2nd blink as if she used it instead of only take the 1st blink's fatigue. This would make it so someone can't safe guard themselves if they mess up the second blink, punishing them for charging up an unused blink.
---
The reason I'm posting this regarding spirit is because I don't see anyone talking about her, it has only ever been buff freddy and nerf nurse.
---
Thanks.

u/nwordcountbot u/mordhauohwhy

Thank you for the request, comrade.

mordhauohwhy has not said the N-word yet.

Apologies, thought you were the guy I replied to. 
---
I don't use overpowered stuff cause I don't like to go against over powered stuff myself.
---
Wraith. It's annoying to have to find immersed survivors so invisible+no terror radius helps prevent hiding. Also his add-ins allows for some pretty niche builds (vault master, speed wraither, pallet breaker, etc.)
---
Dead Hard was in the shrine about a month or a month and a half ago iirc. Gimme one of Enduring, Spirit Fury, or Pop please. Would also be cool with Blood Warden.
---
Yea honestly, it's gotten to the point where I gotta dodge lobbies after asking if anyone has self-care
---
You think they'd let a killer off that easy? Just sacrificing themself?
---
No. They have to *suffer.*
---
Had a green rank survivor streamer do no gens for the whole game, along with 2 other clauds that did like 1 gen after I did 3, then when everyone died, I was looking for hatch and the streamer said "this kate's just running around like an idiot" on his stream. Well first of all, you're bloody welcome for all the gens that were done that you didn't help with at all, and second, what do you expect me to run to the killer and beg to die? I follow most streamers I play with, but not that guy, what an asshat.
---
Might as well just level leather boy if ya can. You'll get BBQ as well which feels like a must on all killers to me.
---
Offerings that give % more bloodpoints. always increase the max you can get. So, yes.
---
Finally! Flip Flop and Boil Over. I'm quite happy with this shrine :3
---
I main Jeff because he was the first survivor I got and also he's a guy with long hair, I like to play characters that slightly resemble me.
---
And I don't know why, but I main huntress, I'm not good at her or anything, I just decided one day to main her
---
Or simply drop it on the rare occasion Head On works.
---
I took notes for the next post, there isn't much I can do now
---
No that would be too op because head on is an S tier perk
---
I mean I dont know about the lights since most killers can see a survivor a mile away turning it on. so I apologize about that confusion. However I think that maybe the hatch being able to be opened would be a better alternative since the killer has the option to either find the survivor or close hatch rather than just letting closing the hatch be all end all of the match if the survivor gets found.
---
Hopper gang where you at
---
I actually sit on the tv I play on so you have played yourself
---
Happy birthday

Na just level her up

You don't want to know

Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one having the same problem! All the red and purple ranks have been filled with braindead potato‚Äôs who have left me to die on the hook and never even bothered to come snag me after I saved all there sorry ass‚Äôs and almost insta healed them with my build! PS4 red rank and purple rank survivors have been total shit for the past 2 weeks! I can‚Äôt wait for rank reset! I could see if the killer is camping, but nope he on the other side of the map hitting Claudette hiding in the corner doing nothing and the other 2 are just working away on a gen or walking around like the walking dead!
---
Christ was a terrible shrine. At least flip flop is a juicy 250k bloodpoints.
---
I've had several matches were teammates refuse to heal me, even if I seek them out. If you solo queue, self care or a med kit is still useful/necessary.
---
How fucking dense is this community?
---
I'm saying the 360 is a waste.
---
You get a Sprint Burst when you get hit.
---
I‚Äôve had people say the same things then I point out how I‚Äôm at the top of the list with 25k points and they have 9k points! Yah I did nothing that hole match and BhVR just gave me those for diddling my asshole!
---
I move irl so much during stressful moments
---
Spirit main here and I gotta 100% agree. 
---
I honestly find most of the killers fun to play due to their differences but I find Spirit is probably still the most gratifying when played well.
---
Except we all get clipped on the gnarled fence endings like in Badham Preschool.
---
Ohhhh, fire up + bamboozle would be fun!
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs unpopular, but Yamamoto estate is the worst map in the game. Yes, Yamamoto.
---
Feng min would be cool because your art is impressive
---
Tell him it‚Äôs time to move out of mommy‚Äôs basement and get a life!
---
Dude I can't count how many times I've evaded the killer all game long, started 2-3 gens solo, made a few hook rescues, and then died on my first hook--and last hook of the game--because my team decided I was expendable now that I had carried them to the finish line.  Bunch of twats.
---
\*Killer being toxic in post game chat\* 
---
this sub: I'm gonna pretend I didn't read that
---
If they don't look for ruin they'll still lose time due to:
---
* no great skill checks to speed up progress
---
* normal skill checks cause regression
---
Also, the trapper shouldn't focus too much on defending ruin. The trapper should instead use the time bought by the ruin to collect and set up a nest of traps, especially around the basement. Ruin is not meant to be defended viciously, and smart survivors will follow killers to the ruin, especially the trapper because he sometimes gets followed by survivors looking to disarm any traps he sets.
---
I recommend Trapper main Otzdarva (on Twitch and Youtube), who knows the pain of ruin being gone in twenty seconds but knows that it is still work running.
---
Survivor : Nea, because she's the first one i played with, and also, unpopular I know, she's really pretty. I also play Bill cause he's cool.
---
Killer : I play killer 1 out of 20 matches. Huntress cause she's my mommy Kappa. Joking but I like the satisfaction of a successful hit * I mean a huge ass hitbox *
---
That tree has some mad skills
---
The post said high tier
---
That's all fine and good but a good killer won't allow themselves to get 360'd more then once by each survivor.
---
So, the 360 is a waste as majority killers know how to easily counter it.
---
360's are just not good against high rank killers.
---
No Billy?
---
When 90% of nea mains think she's ugly :(
---
I actually sit on my friends keyboard while playing on my ps4
---
Not sure how much it takes thoe you should be able to level her up quite quick I‚Äôd say and depending if you need blood points more then I‚Äôd say go for it
---
True
---
Definitely not worth unless you are maybe a looooong time player. Shards take you dozens of times longer to get than bloodpoints. Even if they doubled it is still advise against it (again, unless you have been playing for quite some time and just want extra points.)
---
Username checks out, and it‚Äôs a joke autist
---
That to.
---
Been a but since I played the game being on vacation and all.
---
Just level Leatherface, BBQ and Chili is never going to be on the Shrine again
---
I don't watch any DbD streamers and tbh I'm not really interested in them, I've learned how to play the game myself and in my experience Ruin is grossly overrated and seldom as effective as most people seem to think. I've played without it for two years and don't intend to start now.
---
Looks like a Spirit ;)
---
To be fair something I considered the other day is that Self-Care realistically is not as good as it once was due to a number of factors and this is coming from someone who still DOES use Self-Care.
---
I think the easiest and fastest way to explain it is that generally if you're in a chase, the killer has a pretty decent chance of just either 1 shotting you OR doing some other action that makes Self-Care take even longer anyways.
---
Most killers now don't really aim for hitting you twice, they aim for setting you up so that they can hit you once. Pair that with the fact that killers have a number of perks/add-ons that ALLOW one hits such as Haunted Grounds or Iridescent hatchets on Huntress.
---
Why would you take a perk that allows you to heal yourself at half speed when most of the times that you get injured and could use Self-Care you'll probably get downed, when you could instead take other perks that will extend how long you survive a chase, help you get away from the chase, etc.
---
Personally I would just ignore people saying Bond, Botany Knowledge and a Medkit are mandatory though. If you're going to make your ENTIRE build around running to find people to heal you and yet bringing a Medkit to make up for no Self-Care, you're actually just a clown by then. Iron Will I'd argue is pretty good since it helps a lot with stealth, Adrenaline is I think right now undeniable as probably the best survivor perk, but Bond and Botany Knowledge? lol nty.
---
You're welcome

Im done with everyones shit you rotting dick for a hamster running on an onion for a brain

Bit aggressive there my dood sounds like someone didn‚Äôt enjoy the downvotes
---
How is thwarting a 360 by not lunging the baby thing to do?
---
If it an obvious read, why would I play along an swing around with them, when I can just m1 tap them while they spin like an idiot?
---
who can forget the butt dancing.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FShE0VifCYs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FShE0VifCYs)
---
Nurse too imo, breaking los isn't useful if she can hear you
---
I totally agree. It ain't racist. if DBD maps theme was too bright and someone mentioned a white survivor. I bet no one would even care.
---
Why use bond when I can use SeLf CaRe?
---
literally me though
---
How many totems are there in one match?
---
Iron Will not a great perk. If the killer is good and follows the blood trails it doesn‚Äôt do anything it might help in niche hiding situations but honestly it doesn‚Äôt help much at all
---
Prayer Beads need to be removed
---
Yeah, great idea. There's just one problem: I don't have Leatherface because I'm a peasant and even if I did have him I just really don't want to play him. Like, I would rather spend money on literally any other killer.
---
No, it‚Äôs not stranger things so you can shut the fuck up about it.
---
All i know is the main menu makes the fan go nuts
---
Yeah it was probably to justify selling the game at $60 on console. Im surprised that they didnt have a bundle with all of them on pc as well.
---
Buy the game and wait for sales to get the dlcs.
---
Ohhhhhhh shit
---
I like to watch my survivors get killed by the entity so I can take a screenshot as it kills them
---
Tru3 has depipped with 29k points and black pipped with 31k points before
---
Cool emblem system, bro
---
Was it the update? I was wondering abiut that. Well hopefully it fixes itself soon.
---
Hmm thats what my husbands was too. He said it happens with those sometimes. I hope you guys can fix it though! Ours would be so freaking loud and I kept having to force shut down, I'm pretty sure it is a fan issue but not 100%
---
Yeah it just kinda feels like a worse more niche unbreakable.
---
Flip Flop only works paired with Tenacity or Unbreakable. And if you get a slugging killer.
---
I'm getting my copy off game pass right now. At some point it will cost more to keep it on game pass then to just buy ut : /
---
Doesn't have to be.
---
Just make it so you can't have EGC tick down if you have an RBT ticking.
---
Pig gets very little benefit from the EGC that way, but at the very least she's not any worse than she was.
---
Adrenaline is completely broken and unfair. At higher ranks it's a teamwide insta heal and temp speed boost that requires zero conditions be met and has zero counterplay. Imagine if Noed just instantly took everyone down a health state, slowed them for a few seconds, and wasn't even a Hex perk. Like old MoM Adrenaline is one of those perks that sounds fine on paper, but it's become a meta perk that virtually everyone runs which breaks it.
---
Nurse and Spirit are fine where they are besides needing some light perk reworks. Nerfing them too much would take away the only consistently viable killers that have a chance against swf in red ranks, which is I guess why so many survivor mains want them nurfed. They don't like having to vs killers that actually stand a chance.
---
Not everyone carries sprint burst, bud.
---
K good
---
it's not bad persay, but ever since the healing changes a while ago, I wanna say almost a year ago now? It definitely isn't as good as it used to be.
---
the base healing of it is 32 seconds and bump it up to 40 if Sloppy Butcher is in play(even more if killers are using other slowdown perks which while not as effective can add up if they're running some weird meme build), that alone is about half a hook state and under 2/5ths of a generator. A LOT can happen in 32 seconds where time matters for everyone involved. If you find yourself healing a lot, constantly using the slowest method of healing really shows how much time you can waste using self care.
---
just compare healing with a standard yellow medkit with charge add-ons to self care. Assuming you don't miss skillchecks you can get 3 heals off a yellow medkit at 10 seconds each for 30 seconds spent healing. Compare that to self care where you would spend 96 seconds healing 3 times. 30 seconds at the cost of an item compared to 96 seconds at the cost of a perk. I'm sure you would bring up how self care is infinite, but all that does is highlight it's problem even more, so much can get done in 32 seconds and the more and more time you spend self caring, the more time the killer has to regress gens, down/hook people, and overall just win the match, especially if multiple survivors run self care like this all the time. Even more if you're the paranoid immersed survivors who have to run to corners of the map to heal.
---
If you want solid self healing, medkits are always the better options, you also have the option of Adrenaline obviously, as well as several perks that compliment being injured like Dead Hard and Iron Will. Botany Knowledge is always good to run with any healing, and admittedly it makes Self Care actually decent, problem being it makes everything better than self care also better so why not just run a medkit with botany.
---
Then there's other perks like autodidact and solidarity that speed up group healing and people seem to overlook Leader as a solid group heal perk, giving everyone around you that 25% healing boost is basically giving everyone else a slightly weaker Botany knowledge to heal you and each other faster.
---
Bottom line, Self Care is an OK perk, but it definitely shouldn't be something you're using throughout the match any chance because then you're contributing about as much as the DCed Nea on the ground.
---
I've had the exact same thoughts as you but for some killers like Trapper it's incredibly useful although affected by RNG. Survivors will never stop looking for Ruin because they know if they can find it quickly they can progress gens much faster, so it will be a game extender so long as they don't spawn on top of it. A team looking for a totem can't be genrushing. Generators take about 80 seconds to complete. A survivor looking for a totem for 20 seconds has wasted 1/4 of a gen. Every good skill check wastes about 9 seconds (1/10 of a gen, so 3 good sc's = 3/10 of a gen time wasted). Even if survivors hit all great skill checks they'll lose the 2% bonus they would have gotten every time. If survivors bring purple toolboxes then every six seconds they waste looking for the totem is about 1/10th of a gen.
---
If four survivors with purple toolboxes look for ruin for 30 seconds, they have lost almost 2 full gens worth of time.
---
Ruin is a not a bad perk, even though it's based on RNG.
---
Outsourcing your kills just feels so cheap to me.
---
But would it stop ticking down for all survivors or just the one with a trap on it?
---
Same here. Heard spamming A or going through manage games can work though it hasn't for me
---
Thats odd. Iv never had that happen
---
Not for me
---
While at a certain point you can be throwing by goofing off, it is a good tool to use in conjunction with looping, If I have a good example I catch with shadowplay I'll upload it for ya.
---
I got this 2day
---
Spirit is pretty unfun to play against but I can‚Äôt blame people for playing her a lot when it seems like most survivors just like to bully the other killers.
---
This seriously me LOL. So true.
---
It's a global timer, so for everybody.
---
It still gives survivors a reason to get the fuck out,  but doesn't synergize with EGC to the point where you need to nerf a mid tier killer.
---
That‚Äôs really cool.
---
that could be a glitch where people just aren't given the prompt to heal others until they go down/get hooked. Real annoying bug that makes it look like I'm being a dick when I physically just can't heal you D:
---
Mine says something about an error code and it‚Äôs always right after a match, then it goes back to the load screen, and I don‚Äôt get any points from the previous match. I play on PC
---
Imagine if Dio could be defeated by looking up
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs looks awesome
---
Rank 16
---
Kick more gens, break more pallets, get more hooks.  If you're staying near the hook after hooking a survivor in any situation other than:
---
1) Exits are already open, other survivors are fully healed (and no NOED) and you don't know where they are/they are in positions you can't actually catch/pressure them
---
2) Other survivors are literally running around the hook before you even leave
---
You lose A LOT of emblem progress for being around hooked survivors no matter what the situation is - the above two situations are the only ones that you are likely to get more emblem progress from staying near the hook.  In the first case if you're very unlikely to get another kill then you're better off just ensuring your current hook gets sacrificed.  In the second case you're likely to gain more because you're going to get guaranteed chase and likely get hits, sometimes on multiple survivors and maybe even grab someone to interrupt a rescue.  Even better, you can sometimes down the survivor that's trying to rescue and that puts massive pressure on a team and forces everyone off gens for a while.
---
When has anyone ever said that
---
The majority of my team was spent bing bongin' around the map, got a 4k in the end.
---
Spirit will get you to red ranks but she's a bit overrated currently due to the survivor meta. I say this as a Spirit main. Most of my games at red ranks are against anti-Spirit death squads with Quick and Quiet/Iron Will on 2 or more survivors.
---
That's the shape of Huntress' axes' hitbox for you.
---
What about it?
---
I feel like the devs would never do that for the lore sake. I guess a way to buff her would be to not allow for any doors to open while someone is trapped
---
I explained why it was dying state in the post. Sloppy be good but it depends on how the killer wants to play. Yes it's an anti heal perk? You cant have anti self care without anti heal?
---

I think the point he‚Äôs trying to make is it‚Äôs significantly easier at low rank. But gj tho
---
I embarrass myself with the nurse every time lol. Figuring out blink is hard. The spirit is awesome tho, well worth working into
---
You need to use their 3 perks and get a merciless kill.
---
"fuck you david, gen taping the gens" well fuck you nea, at least gen taping I did 3 whole gens, what you did? Run the map searching that, fuck you nea, hate you
---
Is your game really this dark? If so, I'd suggest turning the brightness up a tad bit. Like 50% tad bit.
---
50k roughly for bloodpoints per level, 250k total
---
IIRC purchasing a duplicate perk on the shrine gets you 250k BP
---
So it's a wash
---
Rip dh though
---
To me it's not about noed being op, but rather it being a game design I don't agree with; it rewards the player for failing. I don't believe someone should gain an advantage for not doing well, but it's just my view on the matter, I could be missing something about noed's design.  
---
I would prefer if it had another method of activation that depended on the killer's skills
---
The original BNP insta completed a generator, solo.
---
EVEN PLAYING AS A SURVIVOR I hate when my teammates just hover over the hooked person. There are still other things to do! Then they get mad at me because I don‚Äôt go and get them right away because I‚Äôm working on a gen, ALL the way across the map. 
---
As the killer, they think you‚Äôre camping or tunneling and it‚Äôs fxcking annoying getting those messages.üôÑüò∂
---
I have no problem with people sending me hate mail. I'm just offering a better alternative to lashing out your anger. Hit a punching bag instead of calling a stranger words I cannot repeat here and telling said stranger to kill themself.
---
I actually don't use DH OoO and DS most killers don't expect it because 95% of the time you spawn as obsession and with DS you take the obsession so you don't spawn with it
---
As a legion main, Legion is at best mid tier, at worst the worst killer in the game.
---
You don't have $4?
---
I like getting RBT kills lol
---
I love it when people do that, I find it hilarious and preposterous that someone can get so worked up over a game with no prizes lol
---
I actually sit on the Sun while I play (come visit if you want,  it's not that hot
---
And that‚Äôs when I dribble, toxicity 100
---
A fellow intellectual, I see
---
If no survivors look for Ruin, they don't waste that time and only lose seconds on gens, assuming they get a lot of skill checks and miss greats. Most of the survivor games I play the survivors power through gens as usual, albeit a little slower. We only lose when one has to go looking for the hex and feeds the killer, or we just get outplayed in which case Ruin wasn't the game changer.
---
Seems to niche to have a counter for. Maybe if other perks or effects caused dropping items I could see it but because it's the only one I feel like it doesn't deserve having a counter
---
I knew it was a joke, but i was asking for a real answer
---
This post was made by the killer main gang
---
I‚Äôve tried for the last hour still isn‚Äôt working sad day
---
3 red and a gold at least I think
---
Lesson 4!
---
I mean you can't dribble with DS anymore because they can hit it before you even let them down now and DS only activates after being unhooked for 60 seconds. The farthest you get will be like if I went down right at a hook and you hooked me right then and there and thats if RNG is on your side and the skill check was at the very end
---
Oink on command when?
---
Oh cool.. I didn't realize
---
problem being that it WAS like this near launch. It led to stale gameplay and people getting their kills in the lamest way possible. It really isn't hard to facecamp your way to a 2k even against survivors who play correctly against it which in theory would reward you a black pip for a 2K/2E, and in some circumstances can lead to a 3k or even 4k if the survivors play sloppily against it. Eventually being able to hit purple or even red ranks this way shows no indication of skill and would instantly get you destroyed by survivors who actually know how to loop and be a failure of the ranking system.
---
Same exact thing for survivors, escaping by camping the hatch, doing no gens, and saving nobody doesn't show you are a good survivor.
---
They literally had ranks determined by just kills already and it was what led to real shitty killers being able to rank up and somehow be considered equal to the legitimate red rank killers who were good and efficient at their chases and map pressure.
---
Fair enough but I don‚Äôt tunnel for that sole purpose but once I know 60 seconds are up, then my knife will be inserted into your spine;)
---
You‚Äôre using shirtless David with spine chill, self care, and lithe. Wow
---
I was able to get in after pressing a for it like 10 times
---
Wow really? Nvm then idk how I got in
---
Decisive strike is one of the worst perks in the game. It's an "anti-tunnel perk", but what happens when you actually use it? You just piss the killer off and he comes after you even more. You still are hurt, bleeding, making noise. The stun isn't long enough. He will find you and all you've done is ensured you'll die
---
Ghostface is probably stronger and easier but I think pig is more fun
---
lmao idc anymore good for you
---
Actual unpopular opinion coming through, ready the downvote cannons
---
Hag is extremely unfun to play against. Either they are complete noobs who get stomped with little effort or they pseudo-camp with MYC and start hauling ass towards the hook whenever somebody gets saved.  Crouch walking without UE is absolute ass.
---
The perk was created to counter items, specifically at the time Flashlights. There isn't meant to be a counter for it. You're ultimately at an advantage as a survivor since that means the killer has used a perk slot for a mediocre perk.
---
Yes.
---
Would a perk that allows a random hex totem to appear dull be op?
---
It happens to Jessie when he's in prison
---
Who needs Bond when you can run Self Care + No Mither
---
Feng cause I like shorts and tights, and trapper cause he is fun to play
---
SWF isn‚Äôt broken they‚Äôre just using a lot more communication than with randoms, which helps a lot at surviving.
---
Thanks
---
I mean, I am in the mid-ranks, it's littered with ghostface games so spine chill helps a lot. I have shirtless David because I had some extra money to spend and I liked the cosmetics. Self care is just really useful because I solo queue a lot, lithe because I prefer it over sprint burst or dead hard
---
Quick note
---
Despite it actually opening now, it keeps saying initializarion error despite my fully restarting the Xbox 3 times already
---
I legit just made it
---
Typical dwight
---
Shards arent much of a problem for me. I currently have 6,000 and i gather them quite quickly.
---
Harder to use is a nerf, any change made to the game buffs stuff and nerfs stuff, it isn't a bad thing.
---
You're better off just doing a gen most of the time, the only situation self care is useful is when it's only you and another survivor left, and they're hooked and you have bt and can save them if healed. That's essentially it. All other situations you're better off using a medkit, doing a gen, etc. 32 seconds to heal yourself is almost half a gen worth of progress. As a killer I'd much rather face survivors with self-care because those guys aren't doing gens while they're self caring, so I can focus on other survivors
---
Nah duplicates that have been on the shrine give you 150k so im thinking its not worth
---
You know you can do other actions while waiting to be healed, right? There‚Äôs nothing that forces you to heal every single time you‚Äôre injured. Sure, it‚Äôs nice to be at full health, but its definitely not worth the 32 seconds that you could spend working on a gen (32 seconds is a little less than half a gen completed without a toolbox btw) while your teammates are presumably looping the killer. 
---
The only instances that self-care is truly helpful and not wasting time is when you‚Äôre the last survivor in the trial, or when you‚Äôre looping the killer and use it during pallet stuns to force the killer into a pallet break (making them lose bloodlust if they have it) and eventually work up to a full self heal. 
---
If you‚Äôre worried about the killer hearing your moans, run iron will. You‚Äôll still leave blood pools but on most maps they are very difficult to pick out through the grass and dark floor textures. Blood pools are less of a give-away than most survivors think, and unless somebody is running Bloodhound the odds of a killer spotting your blood and tracking you down is pretty low. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to tell anyone how to play, but the biggest issue I see when I play with higher ranked (meaning higher numbers, less skill) survivors is their insistence on being fully healed before touching a gen, cleansing a totem, going for a safe unhook, etc. I consistently play in red ranks as a survivor main, and as killer sit in the lower purple ranks. 
---
I don‚Äôt think SC is trash, but its definitely not the god-tier perk that rank 15 p3 Clauds make it out to be. I think SC encourages players to benefit themselves at the expense of the rest of the team. When overused, SC can cost survivors a whole match because everyone is assuming that someone else is working on gens/looping while they heal.
---
TL;DR: Self Care isn‚Äôt a trash/bottom-tier perk, but is often overused by survivors who believe that they cannot do anything productive while in the injured state.
---
But we really want to know! D: 
---
even if it kills us.
---
You forgot the people who generally play both sides  and have experienced the pains each side feels.
---
I always run self care. I play solo 95% of the time and don‚Äôt trust my team mates to not be dumb cunts
---
Sounds like it's working to me.
---
Looking for the hex is not feeding the killer as the killer is more likely to find survivors at generators anyway (unless the killer is playing poorly by camping the hex). If the players power through the gens they could lose around 27 seconds per gen, bringing the time up from 80 to 107. That's a significant different. Multiply this by 5 gens and you waste 135 seconds (a gen and 2/3 of one). That's like having a whole extra generator to complete (plus 3/4). Cleansing Ruin can therefore save as many as 2.25 minutes! That's why looking for Ruin can be optimal as well.
---
Ruin with good skill checks averaging 3 per gen = +1.69 generators
---
I think it's more like some people want Nurse and Spirit to have some sort of counterplay. Assuming that we are at red ranks where killers are somewhat skilled and experienced, there is very little you can do against a great Nurse. She ignores mechanics that survivors can use in a chase only leaving them to try and "mindgame" her. 
---
Spirit is arguably worse. At least with Nurse you can break LOS and make some unexpected plays, but unless you have Iron Will, any competent Spirit with headphones is just going to phase to where she hears you injured (and bumps into you), and boom there goes the hit. It's a hassle, and this is why many people don't like playing against her. \
---
Well according to BHVR they strive for 2 live / 2 die, which means in an average game all the gens are going to get finished. At least that's how they've envisioned the game.
---
So with that in mind, telling someone to just "protect the gens" is pretty poor advice.
---
SWF should be in an unranked queue only for this reason
---
Huh?
---
no. awful perk.
---
It's as much of a counter as "just doing totems lol" is against NOED. You won't be able to stop gens from being completed every game just like survivors won't have the time to cleanse 5 totems every game.
---
I was just saying it‚Äôs a weird combo of perks to see on a David. I‚Äôd expect it on another survivor
---
Well yeah that‚Äôs just people using communication. If a killers ability to do well in a game hinders on the fact that the survivors are using communication and teamwork, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the games fault.
---
Xbox core servers are broken for some people
---
I can tell you haven‚Äôt played a second of survivor
---
Sometimes I bring shit item combos when I'm emptying out my characters for prestige and don't have anything useful left. This way I can give it to someone who can use the parts for a better play in the future (if they manage to escape).
---
No, nobody sabotages hooks. Even if they do sabotage it, you‚Äôll likely have enough time to get to another (unless they 99‚Äôd all hooks... highly unlikely)
---
bunch of nerds trying too hard and beating some stupid shit into the ground thinking they're being so "randumb" and unny by basically copying someone else joke.
---
I don't think so, people would get used too it and assume it's in use.
---
Bruh you aint joking about moris. It's also fun to wait 10 minutes to get into  game were the killer just camps and tunnels, which means either a boring game with zero threat, or a frustrating game of sitting on a hook.
---
And this is red/purple ranks, I'd hate to see green/yellow.
---
Im actually really chill as killer. I don't care about winning as killer, I just like making sure everyone gets 20k bloodpoints and xp for iridescent shards. As a survivor I get hooked first minute, and downed again once freed.
---
I also think it'd be even more incentive to take out dull totems.
---
No, he‚Äôs spirt that possess armor that spawn on the map. He can jump from on body to another to chase, trap, and hunt survivors.
---
I'm pretty sure BBQ+C was on the shrine a few months ago.

A dog dick,  a human dick,  a horse dick,  what kind of dick?

Oh, I think I see. What's the range it can be used at?

Any general tips? I'm a survivor main but I kinda want to start killing those pesky shits
---
If you have enough shards to just throw around for bloodpoints surely you can level up Jake?
---
Bad meme because leatherface doesn't really smile most of the time, he's having a panic attack or a violent tantrum. He probably only smiles once in the film during the dinner scene but even then you can't see it because of the mask.

Done that several times the servers are the problem
---
I thought it was an Xbox outage
---
*squeaks*
---
 I buy all the chapters with real money then level up the characters
---
You say all this but like 20% of my games are a killer who camps the hell out of the first person he sees, then after doing gens when the team comes to try and save him, the game ends in a 2k, 3k sometimes even a 4k if they get really lucky with noed. No skill required
---
Is it fair that a salty killer can completely deny a survivor a chance to play and guarantee them a depip + loss of item?
---
Cmon man the game isn't perfect but if you aren't getting atleast 1 or 2 kills a game then you're doing something wrong. Taking out swf would kill the game. It's not broken. You remind me of that guy who wanted discord blacklisted and if you got caught using comms it was an instant ban lol
---
Any range. There‚Äôs 5 suits of armor on the map.
---
Assuming if you are a good survivor, DS can do either 1 of 3 things. One, the killer loses you and it saves your life. Two, he chases you and once again assuming you are at least decent, you can buy a minimum of a minute of the killers time. And thirdly, if the killer slugs you and the killer waits 60 seconds or you end up getting picked up. Every single one of those are a win for the survivors.
---
Omg, I think I played against y‚Äôall! My ign is Hammy and I recognize y‚Äôalls usernames! I saw in a reply you played against a Huntress and Spirit, but I think I was probably the Spirit y‚Äôall played against since I haven‚Äôt touched Huntress lately. I saw that you also said something in post game chat about the guards failing their jobs, and I think I remember y‚Äôall saying that, too. I may just be largely mistaken but if I‚Äôm not this is such a pleasant coincidence haha
---
Or just waste no time healing and play injured. It's not a very big hindrance. Heal if an opportunity presents itself.
---
Ohhh, I see. Neat idea! What stuff would addons focus on?
---
Try it and come back.
---
Only a foot or 2 behind them! :^)
---
Huntress hit boxes need to be somewhat broken
---
Dunno, but one thing I've noticed as I climb ranks is that players are significantly less cautious at higher ranks, they're either bored of the game or over confident. I've watched a lot of players just charge off with abandon at the start of a match only to end up getting hooked.
---
It might also be that the killers are more skilled, which makes the survivors look worse, unless you're seeing them do stupid stuff.
---
Can be difficult to use at first but one of the best killers in the game.
---
It's litteraly a team game 4v1 and he is mad some people are playing like a team
---
Shit man I feel like a bandit. I literally bought Xbox game pass for 1$. I get to play dead by daylight for an entire year without paying for it. And it's already only 23$ if I wanted to buy it outright

BHVR: entity bro.

[Like this whole thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cmv1s6/_/)
---
If console, than most definitely not. If PC then kinda, she is overall the best killer and just shuts down survivors like it‚Äôs nothing, but because of that it makes it boring overtime. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION I think billy is the best killer to main for each platform. Billy is overall the most balanced killer. He is fun to play and play against. He has potential to be unbelievably strong but survivors can stop that and make him kinda underwhelming. He has a high skill celling but is easy to learn. I can just go on and on why billy is the best. Once again, just my opinion.

Literally made a post detailing how Self Care *saves* time and got downvoted to shit with a bunch of big brain gamers telling me to stop Self Caring in a corner. Self Care on base effectively takes the exact same amount of time as getting someone else to heal you. (1 Survivor healing at 50% speed or 2 Survivors healing at 100% speed.) This only changes if you have perks (Botany Knowledge) or items (Medkits) to speed the process up. This does mean that healing yourself with a Medkit is more efficient than Self Caring, yes, but *that's kinda the point.* The entire purpose of a Medkit is to let you heal faster a **limited number of times.** And when that limited number of uses runs out? What's left? And like you said this also implies that you're not bringing another item which can be far more useful in the heat of the moment than "Oh I didn't spend 32 seconds healing myself lol." If you flat out never get hit (or die on first hook) then bringing a medkit is completely pointless, and you would've been much better off with a toolbox / map / key to end the game faster or a flashlight to make chases last longer.
---
People who say Self Care wastes time are actually the anti-vaxxers of Dead by Daylight. Everyone was completely fine with the Self Care meta until someone (probably a Killer main) randomly decided "sElFcArE wAsTeS tImE" and told a bunch of Survivors that all-vegetable diets (Medkits), essential oils (Iron Will), an immune system (Adrenaline), and Jesus (Bond) will save them. Now these people are killing themselves and harming others around them due to their inexplicable aversion to scientifically proven modern medicine that helps save countless lives daily. It's become a tradition for me to say "Self Care wastes time" sarcastically whenever:
---
* The Killer can easily get a first hit off but has to work hard to get the second one. (Wraith, Hag... Pig, Legion, and Ghostface to an extent)
---
* The Killer can track injured Survivors more easily (Spirit) or has perks to make tracking injured Survivors easier.
---
* The Killer has Thanataphobia
---
* The Killer is just generally downing Survivors who aren't healed
---
I will admit that (purely because I've gotten unlucky with some of my Bloodwebs as of late) I have played without Self Care on a few Survivors. And yeah: running a Medkit with Botany Knowledge (or Streetwise in the case of my Nea) or getting Bond to find others to heal you can be a lot "faster" than Self Caring. But these perks are really rather pointless unless you build specifically around them. I don't run Self Care on my Nea because ~~I don't have it, and~~ I have Prove Thyself, Bond, and Streetwise. I have a build to make my teammates better and since I can find them more easily with Bond I may as well give them some Altruism points instead of doing it myself. But if I haven't based my build on having others help me I may as well sacrifice a single perk slot to not be a burden on my team.
---
My SWF group has a player who runs Botany Knowledge almost all the time and when I play with them I will sometimes forego healing and tell them to meet me to heal me instead. This is smart because they heal me faster than I can heal myself with Self Care, and henceforth having them heal me saves time. If you know your allies have healing related perks (Botany Knowledge, Autodidact [lol]) or a medkit, or you have perks to make healing you more valuable (Leader, Aftercare) then go ahead and skip healing. Heck perhaps you even have perks like Dead Hard, Resilience, This Is Not Happening, and Solidarity to make being injured a good thing. (Though the last two are kinda memes.) If you're willing to play risky and make the best out of a bad situation go right ahead.
---
But you're not "saving time" by running *just* Bond or *just* Iron Will or *just* Adrenaline. You're not "being efficient" by bringing a medkit instead of a toolbox so you can slot in Adrenaline instead of Self Care. If you're really that desperate for a perk slot go right ahead but speaking as a Rank 1 Survivor with three P3 characters my default build (Self Care, Exhaustion Perk, and Spine Chill) already has an empty perk slot as is. I can already slot Adrenaline or Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike in there as I see fit.
---
I don't need all three of those perks because I can evade the Killer without a bunch of overpowered crutches carrying me. And if you genuinely need Adrenaline *and* Decisive Strike **and** Borrowed Time to escape... you're one of the main people that Self Care is meant for.
---
As long as you can loop, which I‚Äôm only good at on two maps.. I‚Äôm still under 500 hours so I‚Äôm not that great at looping yet
---
Because you cant sabotage bear traps my dude.
---
It‚Äôs crazy in this day in age someone finds a solution, posts it to help other people, and still want more. It‚Äôll take as long as it takes.
---
I really hope they change the achievement with it when it does change. At the moment it‚Äôs just the same as the perk, repair the last gen and then leave through the exit gate.
---
Chill I was asking how long it took because I'm not trying to wait an hour for it not to work
---
For you, it‚Äôll take an hour so best not to try.
---
No one tells you to stand and let yourself die. That's your choice. No mutual gain is necessary.
---
r/suddenlygay

I'm not good at looping either. I've been thinking of getting OoO to try and practice my looping but I've been told it really doesn't actually help that much.

Umm are you like a rank 21 or something

I remember making a "who's the strongest Survivor in-lore" post awhile ago. Too lazy to dig through my posts to find it, but Claudette is technically one of the weakest Survivors in the game.
---
MaA makes her terroe radius 16m, with Nurses proccing at 24. More than enough time to get the drop on them.
---
This is true but it's what I absolutely love about this game. I consider myself good (or at least above average) at both killer and survivor, so I'll switch back and forth depending on how I want to play. If I just wanna kick back and chill? I'll play survivor. If I'm feeling competitive that day, I'll play killer. Both just feel perfect for each mindset.
---
Nurse isn't that hard to learn, she's just hard to learn relative to simple killers like Wraith or Trapper
---
You dare spout heresy against Shirtless Myers?
---
I'm not gonna warn you twice...
---
So you‚Äôre telling me you find spirit balance and fun to play against. Clown of the day award goes to... GeofflsOurOnlyHope!!!
---
It doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôve tried haha looping is just watching people do it who are better than you or just tuning everywhere and learning the map and pallet spawns. Honestly that‚Äôs pretty much it I think. I just don‚Äôt have the time to do that for every single map :/

Even better

Yup Soloqueue survivor is miserable with how immersed and useless your teamates play through red ranks on PS4.  Self Care gamers afraid of gens that spend the match healing on the outskirts of the map.  It's absurd how much repairing I still have to do even when I spend the match running killer.  It is annoying as hell that you can rank up as survivor without being able to run a killer OR repair ruin.  Like stay out of red ranks please until you learn how to do the stuff required to play against the killers up there.
---
Omg is that the trigger of it??? I've been wondering for so long what that bug was it makes you feel like such an a-hole
---
Or else Pizza is gonna send out for you.
---
As I said, why the 4k is so important? It's basically a bet. You find the hatch, you're mostly likely to win. If they find the hatch, they win (not reallt tho). Honestly if you watch streamers, they don't give a shit about the hatch, and if the last person escape, they don't mind at all. Why? Because they don't have interest in 4k. If you like a lot of killer mains want 4k instead of having good time and not getting mad for something like that, just slug. If you want just have fun, hook every time you can. That's how the game is. The killer gets to decide how the game goes and the game will be played based on how the killer wants. If he wants to slow down the game, he will bring ruin and will patrol a lot. If he wants 4k, he will slug the last 2 person. The hatch is easy to use as survivor, but killer has more chance to find it. Killer has faster movement speed and he can put pressure. If he's around the survivor is mostly likely to hide to avoid being seen. And they will walk to avoid scratch marks. If the hatch spawns next to them, they're lucky.
---
Yes, and people are fucking retards who don't realize that the nerf to healing time also makes others heal you slower too.
---
But I mean this is the Dead by Daylight community we're talking about here, so I don't know why I expect them to understand things like basic math.
---
There are good killers, and then there are great killers. The difference is in the art.
---
Idk , Tinkerer was meant to apply only for Billy but it also worked with some other addons. That perk that makes you open lockers faster is only vaguely used in huntress, but I think this is only perk that only applies to one killer specifically.
---
The perk is meant to counter sabo and bear traps are the only killer power that can be saboed.
---
I agree. I don't think that you should default to self-caring yourself up everytime you are injured because that's just a waste of time. But I've seen at least 4 posts today trashing it and calling for perks to block your teammates using self care and it doesn't deserve all the hate it's getting. Decent perk, great for new players, but not the best by any means.
---
I have literally seen that said on this sub before.  It was ridiculous and downvoted to hell but it was on here.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if Carlton sued because if this.
---
Which sucks considering the resurgence of the icons. Michael just got one really good movie and is getting two more, Chucky just got a remake and is getting his own TV series. Ghostface made a return to TV recently, Leatherface just got a movie, and again, there are rumours that the Elm Street ‚Äòreboot‚Äô (my guess is they‚Äôll pull the Halloween method of sticking it in the OG timeline) has found a director. And whilst all this happens, arguably the most famous one is left behind in legal purgatory. Sucks really.
---
Loving the new Struggle feature they added to the main menu. Just gotta sacrifice your A button to load in lmao cant believe it work but for sure. Youre a lifesaver thank you so much
---
So BHVR don't know about missing skill checks, not being able to heal people sometimes, desyncing from killers becoming a common thing after 3.1.0 update. So nice, I'm glad they read Saturday bug thread.
---
I hate to say this but it‚Äôs just not worth learning. No matter how good you learn her blinks, console nurse will never be as good as a PC nurse. I honestly would just say use billy or spirit.
---
My man, I've made this same comment to about 4 people on this post alone.
---
Also, it comes across as condescending, when you call someone you don't know a pet nickname like bud.
---
An I get that, but my point is that majority of the time the 360 is a waste of your time. If it's the hit that would put you into the dying state, then sure, go for broke.
---
But if it's your first hit, that 360 is usually the difference between a 30 sec chase and a 90 sec chase, plus if their running Relentless for absolutely no reason at all, your 360 definitely didn't help, unless of course, the killer is lunge dependant garbage.
---
But hey, we all had that period.
---
Lol I play 50/50 I just don't get why today in particular so many people have come out of the woods to shit on self care. It seems so random
---
I mean going versus SWF‚Äôs is basically a guarantee 1 kill most of the time if even. I don‚Äôt think rank matters and taking that out would suck dick but SWF is definitely unfair as fuck especially with looping being pretty equivalent to killer camping in the goals and effectiveness. I feel like with killer there‚Äôs a lot more skill involved in deciding what the best play is, survivors most of the time it‚Äôs just 1. Do gen 2. See killer 3. Run in circles for 3 minutes so your team completes 2-3 gens.  Rinse and repeat. The only variety is when deciding to save a survivor or not which is usually a no brainer.
---
David Gordon Green said so himself. The new Halloween movie is a direct sequel to the 1978 original. John Carpenter also worked very closely with the movie, so yea that‚Äôs where I guess.

This bug was around for a long time, just restart the game.

I can count the times survivors have escaped without making sure to rub it in my face and taunt me like pricks on one hand
---
Don't forget about Ash and his current return to gaming, Hellraiser is getting rebooted, the same with SAW, Grudge is coming back, The Ring is getting a TV show... Our Boy Jason is missing out HARD
---
I thought it was corn nerf.
---
Feels bad
---
Try it with t3 myers, you will mean even further, trudy me
---
The game doesn't come with voice communication. You must use an outside application. What do you say about that?
---
I don't think you understood what was said. Lol
---
I want to rub it till it breaks
---
Oh it's more stupid stuff. Running away on a failed skill check, crouch walking everywhere, not doing gens when Ruin is up, etc.
---
I don't know, just wanted to vent a bit I guess.
---
To be nitpicky, it's actually slower to have someone heal you even if you didn't waste any time running to them. If the other person is doing a gen and you're self-caring, you're both getting skillchecks. If you both hit them perfectly, you save time.
---
That said, while I wouldn't complain about someone running SC, I think healing in general is worse than trying not to heal at all during the match and just using adrenaline in like 99% of cases. If it's a dopey m1 killer you won't need to heal anyway and can just crank the gens out before the killer can get a third hook, and if it's an efficient killer like Nurse you probably aren't actually gaining any benefit by healing, since she'll hit you the second time in a chase in a shorter amount of time than it took you to heal, for a net loss.
---
Basically, as in most team-based video games, playing the objective is king. Cranking gens saves lives. Ignore healing, ignore ruin, if you have less than 50% of the gen left to do, finish it before going for the save, etc.
---
If I go to reload as huntress and find a survivor, do I still refill my hatchets?
---
The game doesn‚Äôt come with dedicated servers either. What are you getting at here?
---
Thank you so much :) I really did and I‚Äôm glad it shows through :)
---
Go for Pig just for her adorable stun noise. 
---
(I might be biased here though since she‚Äôs one of the only killers I play and also because I might hate Ghostface a whole lot bc the asshole scares the shit out of me regularly).
---
I've not heard of people recommending Bond and Botany Knowledge, is that true? Those perks are straight garbage.
---
Adrenaline and Iron Will are based though.
---
Nope, but it was reported, so they at least should KNOW about it.
---
Skill check bug literally white circle just straight up disappeares in front of your eyes and never comes back.
---
Not being able to heal, well you have to get hit first, so it could be a killer perk, like sloppy, which causing it. Or maybe it starts from a start of a game, you just don't know it yet.
---
And desyncing issue, well, no idea, but it rarely was this bad until 3.1.0. Now you literally desync from killer for like 10 seconds. Happens to me and my swf friends way to commonly.
---
I...I don't think he got it..

A good nurse relies on prediction. Additionally if you're about to break LoS most nurses tend to blink to the place you would run to. So simply bait that blink and turn around.
---
Try to change up your patching and stay hard to predict. 
---
Oh and you should evade open field at all costs.
---
Gloves are definitely not useless.
---
Break line of sight.
---
If you break line of sight, she has to guess with her blinks. Depending on how good the LoS breaker is, you have multiple ways to mix her up.
---
No, White Wards only protect the item that‚Äôs in your hands the moment you die or escape. If it gets dropped because of Franklin‚Äôs, you‚Äôll lose it (unless you go back to find it and pick it up again). I learned this the hard way when I first started playing and ngl the salt was real.
---
We don‚Äôt have the endgame chat on PS4, so when I finished a game earlier and 3 people message me, my wife and I both said ‚Äúhere it comes again...‚Äù
---
Surprisingly, it was friendly GGs all around. Maybe there‚Äôs a glimmer of hope out there.
---
Sadly no religious killers very much wish because they have the creepiest designs
---
And the insta-blind changes. And the infinite fixes. And the killer animations were sped up.
---
I didn't play this game when it first came out but man it must've been wild. It was frustrating enough when lightborn was a requirement, I can't imagine people just being able to literally infinitely loop windows on like half the maps. *And people argued it was balanced.* Crazy.

I'm not saying it never happens, i'm saying it's not happening anywhere near as much as you claim.

I usually do play with my rank 11-12 friends, and it sometimes brutal. I'm rank 1, one friend was rank 8, another rank 11. We gotten rank 18 random and rank 18 killer.... Poor guy probably cursed us the whole game, because he couldn't even touch us. I sacrificed myself on endgame to at least give him some points.
---
adrenaline
---
Adrenaline
---
Are you intentionally stupid? The game not coming with voice means everything made from abilities to perks are fashioned with no communication in mind. Why would anyone use Knockout, Third Seal, Bond, Empathy, Aftercare, Kindred, etc if "hey im here" exists? It breaks the balance.
---
Anyways, a great suggestion I see often is to give survivors walkie talkies (free) so they can talk to each other ingame and balance it around comms instead of no comms like they have been doing.
---
so despite me very clearly seeing it happen, it doesn‚Äôt happen as much as I claim?
---
Adrenaline is great, even on tier 1
---
So you‚Äôre saying voice chat should be a thing?
---
Did you use any bloodpoint offerings
---
Or else he‚Äôll use Franklin‚Äôs Demise.
---
Its working now for me. 12:50am CT

I think I did, 100% in hunting
---
Its up and running now.
---
I respect this. I can count the times survivors didn‚Äôt taunt, mock, or rub their victory in my face on one hand.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm getting into more and more survivor games where I‚Äôll be staring get ‚ÄúRevealed‚Äù points and he still ends up getting the exposed status on me at the same time. I‚Äôll always be playing him and just get ridiculously easy exposed on others as well and it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter if they‚Äôre looking right at me or not. Seems maybe it‚Äôs to do with the wonky connection between killer and survivor maybe registering it improperly or out of synch?
---
Lmao I run premonition with Spine Chill now because im sick of running into the killer when spine chill lights up
---
Wow good thing there are perks for this kind of situation, also crows will appear after about a minute.  I think spies from the shadows (if that‚Äôs the name) helps a lot.  Whenever a crow is scared it alerts you.
---
Man it's not. As a said in another post r/deadbydaylight is a cove of rank 20s: it is classified as an horror game because there is the word killer. That's the end of it. It doesn't scare anyone, it's not even supposed to be a stealth game, you have to loop the killer if you want to escape so there's not the surprise element. You could be scared of the killer if you are rank 15 or if you have 50 hours in the game otherwise you could even annoy the killer widh teabags and flashlight clicks... if this is an horror game...

Not trying to be argumentative or an asshole just this is something I'm passionate about and with user flair like "professional arguer" you giving me justification and that slight hope that I'm not far off in terms of plausibility makes me happy. Do I think he will be added? No. Is it possible? By their terms, yes.

That's not unpopular. Is pretty common knowledge that it's one of, if not the strongest add-ons in the game, and most people agree that it's not okay.
---
lol is that a tf2 map
---
Bye, Michael!
---
Yeah Billy is literally unplayable rn
---
7k BP though... with no addons
---
Overcharge is garbage as soon as survivors learn to hit skillchecks so I wouldnt recommend relying on it
---
Because you dont scream it actually makes it so you die on the hook faster
---
Close the end-game chat window and never open it again. It'll save you a lot of sanity.
---
Is that actually unpopular, though? I feel like a ton of people dislike facing hag because they can camp from long distances
---
I'm not even being nasty, there's a decent chance they will.
---
This patch update is brought to you by the same developers who have broken sound six times, Dead Hard four times, and Sprint Burst recovery three times.
---
I have no idea what's wrong with BHVR's workflow, but it's insane how often they break their own shit.
---
Damn man, you managed to keep your kit the whole round too
---
Like I said, mid-tier. I‚Äôm at rank 5 and see people that still can‚Äôt hit skillchecks. It also has synergy with certain perks, and prevents survivors from just tapping a gen that is regressing during a chase. But yeah against survivors that can hit skillchecks it doesn‚Äôt do much.
---
Nice
---
At first learn to follow scratch marks,  predicting is more advanced and takes time to learn. Once you get the hang of following scratch marks,  learn to mindgame. A common one is standing at the pallet to make survivors think you're phasing.  Once you're perfect at mindgaming start predicting. It takes a long time to learn to predict correctly 50% of the time. Takes even longer to get the predictions right every time.
---
Also, what perks do you run on Spirit? She requires certain perks if you aren't good at her.
---
Spirit imo is more broken by perks and add ons than being inherently broken. Things like BBQ or some of her add ons push her over the edge. 
---
Main thing to do is when she uses her power you need to walk and be unpredictable. Running leaves scratch marks for her to see and crouching is too slow, you wont move away from your original location fast enough. Either the Spirit will come out of stealth and miss an attack or they will come out of stealth and just rush into the wrong direction. Also be careful with her blocking pallets (walking to the pallet is too predictable so they will usually check that) and if you think she is mind gaming you with her power don't walk into her if you can always walk (keyword walk) away from her. 
---
Her being unable to see survivors during her passive is a huge weakness and you need to exploit it at every turn.
---
Ya I'm sure they know about it but the reason they haven't fixed it yet is probably because they don't know how to reproduce it, and that means they don't know what's causing it.
---
yeah she's my favorite killer to play. I swapped to her from nurse past 2 seasons and have been loving red ranks. There's a few times she can get frustrating but overall more fun than nurse. I just wonder if/when she gets nerfed since everywhere on the forums you see people complaining about how unfun it is to fight her.
---
Yeah it was an infinite tier 3 Micheal and it took him like all game to get to tier 3
---
Claudette in my lobby? 
---
Well these mori‚Äôs aren‚Äôt gonna use themselves....
---
Fixed
---
You want to use phasing and and mindgames to catch ppl. Listening to sounds to pinpoint where the survivor are and then hit them from phasing can take some practise. Dont mindgame every pallet drop like i see many ppl do, they will just keep running to the next one. I usually mindgame if they corner themselves so they either have to see if im fake phasing or they have to take a wild guess and walk by me on one of the sides. 
---
Keep playing and you will get the hang of it.
---
Agreed. Rank 43 build. "Bohoo I am so scared of the killer, I don't want to face him, he's so scary please noo".
---
Rank definitely matters when you get into brown ranks. The average player there had absolutely no clue what they are doing.
---
I love when I start to use this and the killer suddenly pops up during the skill checks.  Wasted.
---
Just because you don't think it's scary doesn't mean it's not a horror game. I don't think Amnesia or FNaF is scary, but they are classified as horror games, thus I don't question that. You even said it yourself:
---
&gt;You could be scared of the killer if...
---
The game scares plenty of people. Hell, I get scared sometimes when I trigger a Hag trap in an unexpected spot or when Spirit grabs me out of nowhere.
---
It's just a new perk. Didn't you hear about it?
---
It might also make noed not as often if people start cleansing dull totems more
---
Wrong. This also happened to PS4 from time to time after Freddy's patch.
---
I usually squint my eyes and look on top of my screen so I can see the survivors far away
---
You didn‚Äôt know that we are in the killer circle jerk area?
---
The same thing happens with my Xbox one, and I have no idea what to do.
---
Literally this exact same scenario just played out in one of my games haha
---
Slugging has gotten more popular because of the Decisive Strike rework. It's better to leave survivors on their tummy for a minute than heal them another state and restart the chase.
---
All the Billys I get against that use that skin forget how to chainsaw down because they can't hear the sandals ;(
---
Problem is in red ranks they‚Äôre almost always running good perks or addons so something like BBQ and addons like Prayer beads or the pink that lets you see blood pools or even the speed increasing addons are disgustingly broken to play with or against. I‚Äôd argue that even without the perks or addons it‚Äôs still pretty darn easy to get a survivor with headphones on and walking away gets you what 10 meters away if you‚Äôre lucky? Most spirits I play against seem to just follow me by sound anyways so walking or running or crouching does me no good. At least nurse you had options you could break line of sight or run into the nurse or even get in a locker for a second but spirit man. Red rank spirit is my new least favorite matchup I‚Äôd rather go back to every lobby is a clown or hillbilly or nurse than every lobby other lobby being a spirit.
---
Because you were scared of the killer for the first 50 hours. So was I. All horror games lose their scare factor over time.
---
 I used to really like messing around with slenderman's AI in Slender and it led to some funny moments that were definitely not scary. Doesn't mean it's not a horror game.
---
Honestly can't tell if this is bait or not and if it is then so be it but Leatherface is one of the weakest killers in game, his chainsaw slows him down so much it is useless during a Chase, can't protect gens well and can't make up for it with chases like clown does at least and his mobility to cross the map is so bad. The only reason he is used is because he can camp good so all the campers use him plus dumb teammates encourage the camping by rushing hook,if people weren't dumb he'd only be used for BBQ and by TC massacre fans.
---
... and 30 fps and lag and shitty sensitivity ok.
---
Lies, you have a great voice
---
Thank you for adding on!
---
Swap for me, I'm more likely to hit the skill checks when leaning forward lol
---
No, I already said you're very special and unique.
---
If you played at rank 1 you would know that good survivors will literally never let you get a chainsaw off. LF is basically a powerless M1 killer against good survs.
---
Personally I'd argue he's the worst killer since at least other M1 killers have abilities they can use. LF does, however, destroy noobs that get caught out of place. You can get chainsaws every down pretty much against bad survs.
---
He did have noed but since we were in vc, we avoided the last two of us dying lol
---
right? I play 50/50, but I do bp farming sometimes when I'm feeling it. I still believe majority of killers aren't dicks like this.
---
What are recommended Perks to get from the Shrine if they appear? I know BBQ is good for Hunters for Bloodpoints &amp; a few others popular perks like Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, &amp; Adrenaline for Survivors, but are there other perks that you highly recommend getting for everyone as soon as possible without having to grind for that specific character?
---
Well the bug isn‚Äôt the problem anymore it‚Äôs that all my killers and survivors are gone
---
Yup. It‚Äôs possible lorewise
---
I just wanted to tell you that they DID in fact say they won‚Äôt make religious killers
---
They also said they won‚Äôt make clowns
---
Oh well
---
Amen to that brother if someone tries to sandbag or rat out their team I will make sure they die and the others get the hatch/door
---
Depends, right at the survivor is obvious as hell I like to look at routes to the hook and have a trap up each route

I guess then all killers aren‚Äôt made the same? I‚Äôm pretty sure the game designers wanted different killers to serve different purposes. Hence why Myers stalks, etc. Maybe Leatherface was made for sub camp games. And no, this wasnt a bait for a salty reaction. I play both killer and survivor and people playing just killers just wish for easier game play and more buffs to killers and nerfs to survivors.  Perks allow for suitable game play also and when I play survivor, Leather faces at ranks 8 thru 1 are very dangerous
---
That won‚Äôt work cause I bought them with blood points and cells
---
Since the Mettle of man nerf he isnt worth buying
---
I wouldnt argue that too much. Others do have some nasty abilities. Hag used to be my favorite bc she was and still is one of the easiest killers to use
---
But in that fix I was still staying at placein the first game I played, then it looked ok.
---
Yes! Finally a Ash perk! I have every single perk except ash's. Finally a shrine where i need something
---
That's what my parents did, that and cold showers right in the face. :(
---
The rest is total shit tho
---
Leather face is without a doubt one of the weakest killers in the game my guy. He has 0 pressure and is literally only good against bad survivors
---
Same lol. I try my hardest at killer but I usually only get up to rank 10 before the rank reset. But I'm always getting lobbies with rank 3 and up, with the one rank 20 thrown in.
---
Even calm spirit would be better than this shit
---
For the record, you‚Äôre probably thinking of the rarest chili addon which has the added effect of increased ‚Äústun‚Äù on collision with a wall or whatnot. Which would be the tantrum.
---
I'm the meg that does 3 gens and gets used as exit bait
---
Oh my god I love it!!!
---
Honestly, I used to think the same way until I realized it's our fault for why NOED triggers. Cleansing one totem takes like 15 seconds, and if all survivors cleansed 1 and you cleansed 2, you will only lose 15 seconds of repairing generators to cancel out the most OP end-game perk.
---
If the community got together and normalized cleansing how they normalized not to cleanse because *it wastes time* then NOED wouldn't be a problem.
---
If they do a stranger things dlc and Steve isnt the survivor I will become insidious basement bubba.
---
Ah, yes. Luckily I don‚Äôt 360 before first hit (whatever I‚Äôve said before hand may unintentionally come off as the opposite of this) and only do it if the next hit is gonna down me.
---
Thanks man
---
I think decisive strike also costs you points in malicious since you get -malicious when a survivor escapes your grasp. But DS might be exempt from that I'm not 100% sure.
---
Sam raining you say?
---
But the game isn‚Äôt just about budgeting survivor time properly, it‚Äôs also about wasting the killer‚Äôs time and maximising your use of the time they spend distracted.
---
If a killer chases someone for a minute, and you waste 40 seconds of that minute self caring through Sloppy Butcher, you‚Äôre actively hindering your team. That time is precious and you should spend it wisely. If two or three people waste most of that minute with Self Care, the whole team loses because gens make almost no progress and you‚Äôre now down one hook state and several pallets.
---
Fantastic shot, dude.
---
The problem is the totem placements. The new preschool variants can actually hide hexes and totems pretty well. Meanwhile the asylum map can spawn hexes in the middle of the open space fields with nothing covering them. I've switched to corrupt on trapper and it does well at red ranks.
---
i feel like it'd just be easier to have Red as the killer and Adelaide as the survivor (my most wanted licensed killer) but i like this concept
---
 Playing 50 hours takes very little time. So little that you can't classify it as an horror game. Especially when it's an online game. 50 hours in a single player is a lot, 50 in an online game is nothing. And dbd becomes a circus after 50 hours, unlike other games, for example soul at stake, that is DESIGNED to be scary, there is the surprise element. In dbd you are scared at the beginning because you don't know your potential: you don't know you have a lot of ways to counter the killer, you don't know you can destroy the killer in a swf, you don't know you're the active role. That's just irrational fear. On the other hand in soul at stake, your fear becomes rational, because you are perfectly aware that the killer could come at you at any moment and could really hurt you so you have to be careful. That's because the game is made to be scary. Dbd is not. It's made to be a dynamic game, rather than an horror game.
---
It‚Äôs funny, I‚Äôm the complete opposite. When I‚Äôm playing as survivor and see the red stain on my back, I literally clench.
---
thays cause you go for blood points instead of wins
---
Ah I see you are a survivor main, its a shame, I lost my respect....sike
---
You are awesome at this, very nice portraits and overall excelent work!, please let me know if you will do the perks with colored pastel background.
---
pharmacy but for keys when last one alive
---
Pretty sure that's illegal.
---
The way that you can tell this glitch is happening is if you can't heal yourself or anyone else. And nobody is able to heal you.
---
You've seen a r1 leatherface?!?
---
you relize ganes like that actually happen, and it wpuld be one thing if it was extremly rare but it happenes WAY more then it shpuld, happened to me when i first started, and when i switched to xbox
---
That's how I play mario kart. If I jump and raise the controller, I jump higher.
---
Just look at For Honor.
---
That lag was through the roof!
---
At least it'll be up when I get off work in 7 more hours! 
---
At least it better be.... I have people to stalk
---
Anything that requires you to not do gens is OP? So getting chased by the killer is OP? Last I checked DBD is more than just doing gens, or killing survivors; you've got to strategize no matter which side you're playing, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time
---
you relize i was making fun of people that think noed is op
---
The sheer complexity of the power makes this a thing that'll never happen. Behavior cannot even do an update without breaking perks and mechanics that weren't even touched in it. 
---
Sorry to say.
---
I had this happen to me too on Freddy‚Äôs map no skill check haha
---
have we had these perks recently?
---
I just want to get trophies dawg. Cue 4th person just sitting in a locker so I cant get the 4k tombstone.
---
Funny enough I get a lot more sat when I run Franklin's. Survivors hate losing their items
---
But what is truly op is that the killer spawns on the same map as the survivors
---
are you sure? I'll place 10, and just to be safe also stand by the hook myself.
---
NOED in its current state is a problem.  While I feel like it‚Äôs the yin to Adrenaline‚Äôs yang,  survivors have to earn their perk. All to often, NOED rewards shitty killers.  I‚Äôm all for a system in place for the perk that lets you build to its current strength. Let it be a perk that rewards strong play by a killer.
---
How was he infinite? He hit the jake on the way out and he was in injured state
---
Unhook
---
Same.
---
I've seen it happen and had it happen way to often.
---
Whenever that happens I usually restart my Xbox which fixes it usually. If not I just spam the button till it lets me in

No i‚Äôm saying after you insta-healed him. On the way out the exit gates
---
I always do bad or die quickly when I take cakes.
---
He does get downs even at rank 1 if played correctly. You have to be aggressive and create deadzones while patrolling gens. Eventually it's hard for the survivors to evade your saw. Windows are useless, you can saw right through.
---
Feng min because she is cutie and nurse because she is a cutie ( and can't be looped)
---
Sounds like he really loved that chest
---
This is Bullshit. While Hillbilly is clearly superior in this post, it‚Äôs alluding to Leatherface still being fantastic. Leatherface sucks.
---
Ya man I've had killers do that to me too and it's gotten to the point where like you said I have a hard time even letting them farm me now cause its happened so many times where they kill you.
---
Didn't ever have to do this at my house but I've had to do it at family sleepovers and gfs parents houses before. Some family's are shitty or just gotta get to work early.
---
I feel like ive always had the issue, kept me from wanting to play killer as often since id miss easy downs costing me the game, even after new mouse
---
 I found some people saying to re-scale desktop display settings, "change the size of text, apps, and other items" to 100%.
---
The reasoning is the mouse is not clicking in the game screen and thus not registering initial click.
---
Not sure if helps as recent, but haven't noticed it after a full day yet.
---
He was still in tier 3 when I left and you can still his knife up when he goes for the hit
---
I can relate to that lol. Been a while since I've seen a prestiged feng. Good to know she still gets played as.
---
No it definitely does.
---
For Claudette that's true, but I'm level 44 with Nea and I haven't unlocked any of her teachable perks for others to learn yet...
---
I mean if it's obvious it's SWF, and the guy was maybe teabagging a killer or the whole team was bullying him, I don't blame him he camps. Against even mediocre SWF you're lucky to get one maybe two kills, usually not even that because they go for saving that one guy, all of them. You don't see that happening in solo play.
---
The problem with SWF is, you can't use voice when you play solo, even devs are against it. Yet as SWF it's fine? Like it makes the game easy even for bad players, I mean I'm killer main but I've tried also SWF many times as survivor and it helps so much to have actual voice communication, it makes many perks killer's perks useless, it makes some of the aspects of the game useless. I have nothing against actual playing with friends, but it's only getting abused if anything and it punishes solo survivor players for not using SWF.
---
&gt;they‚Äôre just using a lot more communication than with randoms
---
Which is funny, because as solo you can't use any communication and even devs said they don't plan on changing it. So SWF makes the game trivial compared to solo play as survivor.
---
moris-are op, does require pre requisites
---
one hit downs- huntress is one hatchet, 3 if addons. clown - hqs to direcrly hit bottle then hit survivor right after
---
instadown perks - haunted grounds, extremly situational, once its gone you only have 3 perks. make your choice, not that good, can be decent. the locker one - completly useless. devour hope - ots a totem, wipl work like once out of 15 games if your lucky
---
perk to shut all loops - ???? spirit fury??? which is good but wpnt work on every loop as it wont be active on all loops
---
perk to shut a window - bamboozle, good but situational a lot of loops use no window
---
insta heals- can use whenever, requires like 0.25 secs to use, only downside is using medkit
---
good toolboxes- makes the game go exyremly fast
---
nurse - is op needs a nerf
---
noed- EASY COUNTER, JUST BREAK THE FUCKING TOTEMS
---
sprint burst - just press run, you "out played" the killer
---
adreneline - get hit, last gen pops get insta heal cause perk
---
ds - rewards survivor for unsafe hooks or bieng stupid
---
counters - 
---
moris - i dont think any but requires pre requisite
---
noed - brwak dull totems
---
haunted grounds - dont break the totems or hide till timer is over
---
devour- break totem
---
clown and huntress one hit addons - be unpredictable, be smart
---
intsa heal - franklins
---
adreneline - no counter
---
ds - slug for 60 secs
---
sprint burst - no counter
---
nurse - is op but im talking most games, which arnt nurse matches
---
make your choice - barrowed time and when killer is near unhook or just dont be found for 60 secs
---
ruin- break totem or work through it
---
toolboxes - none
---
I know. You healed Jake to full health. Myers hits Jake as he is leaving. Jake is only injured when leaving, rather than getting downed with T3
---
So do you understand the crux of why others are disagreeing with you here? 
---
You know that other Killers have nasty abilities. I‚Äôd argue just about all of them beat a slow to rev, easy to crash chainsaw that can‚Äôt be realistically used in the vast majority of situations versus experienced/good survivors. 
---
Therefore LF **is not** good ‚Äúwhere he is‚Äù. He‚Äôs almost universally agreed that he‚Äôs one of the (if not **the** ) weakest Killers. He should be buffed or reworked. And you shouldn‚Äôt then turn that fact into attacking Killers as a whole.
---
Kill the survivor trying to colloborate, and then play a normal game. That's what I do.
---
yes keys are rare? still exist had several suvivors escape caus of them, and your just trying to ignore part of it at this point
---
I‚Äôm not surprised
---
It's BHVR. They're about as consistent as huntress hatchets.
---
*Casually omits all the survivors teabagging him at pallets*
---
Wish I could upvote this more than once, hag mains are so paranoid
---
My guy, the pre requisite for a mori is doing the only objective a killer has. Hardly a pre requisite tbh. Being able to remove people from game on 2nd hook woth only an offering is pretty op.
---
Just use iron will
---
When did I say keys are rare and what am I ignoring?  I‚Äôm saying a situation where you get cucked by a key is rare, especially one in which four survivors have done all the gens and most escape via hatch/starting endgame, or three with four gens done. That situation is very rare in that you‚Äôve played well but have still gotten to that point, AND they have a key. I think it‚Äôs happened to me maybe once, and I play a bunch.
---
yes, the ivory is really powerful and the ebony is OP, the point is insta heals and amazing tolboxes have no pre requisites
---
Iron will is bae
---
No one is ignoring sprint burst: it really just isn't that good compared to balanced landing and dead hard for experienced survivors. And No one is ignoring ds either: most of the time it won't be used unless the killer is tunnelling, can literally find no other survivors, or you run right into them and try to get downed/grabbed (at that point, they probably know you have ds). Funny how you say ds can reward bad plays but didn't comment on the fact that if noed activates the killer might've gotten one free kill despite doing poorly the whole game.
---
Instaheals can be strong if there's like 4 of them and they're pink. Most of the time, they're singular and come in the form of the purple self heal, it's definitely annoying but unless you though old MoM was the most op perk in the game, it really isn't that powerful. The pink one against a killer without an instadown getting someone up from the dying state is really the only time it's REALLY powerful, that's if the person running over doesn't get smacked while trying to heal the one on the ground, if they commit to it they'll probably be on the ground soon after. 
---
The only survivor perk that is kinda obnoxious is adrenaline, but at least you can say the survivors have to actually work for that perk to even get use.
---
This had to be reposted for any that saw it before had a slight issue with older devices :)
---
&gt; but like 20% of my games are
---
20 percent. Wow. 20 out of every 100 games you get a killer who camps the first person he sees. Seems like it ain't so bad to me.
---
&gt; then after... comes to try and save him...even a 4k if they get really lucky with noed...No skill required
---
Of course there's no skill required when 3 survivors suicide themselves being retarded in their altruism. That's the fault of the survivors for being stupid.
---
&gt; Is it fair that a salty killer can completely deny a survivor a chance to play and guarantee them a depip + loss of item?
---
Yes, it's fair. It's completely fair that a killer playing his role can be the person who decides how he chooses to play, whatever his motivation for doing so may be. People have gotten so used to the power survivors wield and the emasculation of killers based on these made up rules and social censure that they forget this is a game where you risk your items, addons, and offerings, going into each match. You don't get to expect to lose your purple flashlight only after the most glorious of battles, otherwise you get to keep it because any other method is lame. You might keep the same purple flashlight for 8/10 games, and the other 2 you get a camping killer who moris you after your teammates farm you.
---
That's the way it is, whether you like it or not. The survivor was able to play all the way through the match up until the point where they were downed. After you're downed, you're at the mercy of the killer. Does it suck not being able to have full control over your fate at all stages of the match? Sure, I'll grant you that; however, that's the way the game is, and I wish people would get over this pathetic sense of entitlement. Your chance to escape that fate was while you were being chased. I don't particularly enjoy having Leatherface sit on top of me with his chainsaw revved and ready to go in the event someone is stupid enough to go for the save, but fortunately rank 1 survivors tend to be a little smarter than that. While I sit on the hook awaiting death, I know he's losing every gen on the map, and while I'm gonna depip and lose my item, he's depipping and losing any addons he brought. I'm going down, but he's coming with me. 
---
&gt; 1 or 2 kills a game then you're doing something wrong
---
If you're playing with yellow and green ranked survivors, even purple, getting kills is pretty easy because the survivors are bad. They don't route well, they waste pallets when a hit is guaranteed, and they waste all their time searching for ruin instead of hitting the skill checks. It doesn't take much to kill them. If you play against *legit* rank 1 survivors, you'll be sweating your ass off to get those 2 kills without getting a huge amount of momentum at the start of a match. Your ruin will probably get found in the first 30 seconds (if they don't just power through it anyway), and unless you're playing a top tier killer, winning chases is going to be hard. Generators go really fast, so you have very limited time to get the ball rolling.
---
&gt; It's not broken
---
SWF isn't broken? Are you high? You don't think it's broken to have 4 people on voice communication coordinating the killer's every move? Part of the horror that's *supposed* to be in this "survival horror" game is the element of the unknown, and being able to pinpoint his position at each moment of the match is beyond broken. Generator progression and locations, trap door location/key usage, door progress, perk loadouts. I agree that axing SWF would kill the game, but the weakness of killers is exacerbated by the huge power of SWF.
---
your either lying or very lucky, alsoyou are ignoring the entire adreneline thing, the killer plaus good and closes hatch, survivor gets adreneline and killer gets nked and you just try and ignore it, cause you know that you were wrong in the first place
---
Delicious salty killer main tears. I love it
---
&gt;Against even mediocre SWF you're lucky to get one maybe two kills
---
After reading that I'm gonna go ahead and stop you there. If this is the case then the problem is on your end, 100%.  I'm a killer main myself, and I'd like to introduce you to any game rank 1-5. A good 60%+ of matches at this rank are swfs i'd say, so are you saying it's impossible for killers to get to this rank? cause bro you are not gonna rank up from 1k or 2k matches.
---
You have an excellent point though, this is on bhvr. I definitely agree they should ATLEAST add text chat for survivors. It would help solo q's out a lot although it's not mandatory. Plenty of people solo queue at rank 1 consistently but it's dumb to have a nerf like that on survivors while others can just use discord.  
---
And believe me I know about those toxic survivors who teabag while blinding you every pallet, but in my experience the moment you kill them they usually DC because they know damn well a lot of killers will just camp them after that haha.
---
tl:dr: Just because some games are much easier than others (example: solo q'ers at low elo ranks) doesn't mean **all** the games have to be easy like that. add text chat for survivors.
---
The only reasonable response in this thread
---
"juSt BrEak liNe oF SiGht"
---
Some of rocket leagues seasons have been like 9 or so.
---
And how are they going to fix it? Ban some killer mains so there is room for others?
---
And then you're hit with the Ruin skill check less than a second afterwards.
---
fucking christ that was ear blasting
---
Aaaaand then those ‚Äúcamping/tunneling‚Äù messages after the game come in
---
Sprint burst is by fat the worst exhaustion perk and that‚Äôs the one you want to complain about
---
I miss my old boy
---
I admitted it was just me being salty in my first message so not sure why you felt the need to bring that up. This game is notorious for being a game that pisses you off yet you still can‚Äôt stop playing. Check the memes, bruh. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Map idea: Burned Chapel
---
I had no expectations and I got disappointed
---
Oh I did misunderstand completely. Well it‚Äôs not too hard to pip if they try hard enough and some people could have been carried there.
---
*a big difference.
---
Ruin brings 1-2 survivors off the gen completely looking for ruin, another being chased and the last powering through it. Add someone being hooked and you‚Äôll have no one on gens.
---
- 1 hooked
---
- 1 chased
---
- 1 looking for ruin
---
- 1 unhooking and healing
---
The first perk is meh, kinda not worthy a slot perk. The second one it coukd be good, just add a loud notification when you place the trap. The third one is...sexy. The stackable bloodpoints are great for farming.
---
&gt; Taking out swf would kill the game
---
no. SOlo is actually a big part of the survivor communauty from the last official stat. If you remove swf at least 3 or 4 stack swf it will just be replace by more solo survivors wo will be attracted by eventually a balanced of the strongest killers for solos only.

Yeah it‚Äôs just annoying

Yeah unless they change how you can increase your rank it‚Äôs not gonna get any better
---
We had calm spirit last week
---
Yes actually. But I liked it more two years ago. I‚Äôve watched the game get worse and it‚Äôs upsetting because I legitimately love this game.
---
That's assuming survivors go looking for Ruin, which they don't always do.
---
It really is a problem of "show don't tell". In the first movie we are given quite a long exposition too (I think we see Laurie for the first time at the 20 minute mark or so) because we see MM kill his sis and then escape the asylum. Both were extremely good for building athmosphere. Compare that to the approach of the new one. We are constantly told "MM is the boogieman and probably the worst person alive" but we don't really see much. The only part of the exposition I liked were the scenes in the asylum with the other inmates acting up.
---
Also, the entire perspective on the situation switches. Whereas in H78 MM is the focal point, in H18 it's Laurie and her family. I haven't counted but in H78 you constantly see MM. You see him in the background. You hear him breathing. He's always there, ready to pounce, you just never know when it'll happen. That creates an amazing athmosphere
---
In H18 you only ever see him when he kills someone. The rest of the time you follow Laurie or her kid/grandkid and hear them complain about each other. There's just no athmosphere. Also, whereas the adult MM killed 3 people in H78, his killcount explodes in 18 with like minimum 9 kills or so. (Reporters, Cops, Friend, Cops, Father of the top of my head)
---
The death scenes were better in 18. But the athmosphere wasn't there imo.
---
Sorry for the big write-up. I'm literally writing a paper on these movies atm so I'm in the mood to discuss them lol
---
They changed it, now is constanly 36 meters.
---
hitting awake survivors pulks them into the dream state
---
As solo survivor you have 4 things to worry about too
---
Sprint burst, quick and quiet, spine chills and adrenaline
---
I brought BPS the other day and a bubba downed me and face camped me. That was how the evening started

Bruh you don't know how disappointed I was then I found out that jake ain't free on mobile, have to buy him with 9000 shards smh, wraith isn't free either

Buff? No. Camping bubba's would just become an even bigger problem to deal with. I think a total rework is needed. He's too similar to Billy anyway.

Unless you jump through them before he‚Äôs revved his chainsaw... or is close enough to swing through. In which case you‚Äôve successfully negated LF‚Äôs entire power.

The people you‚Äôre referring to aren‚Äôt Hag mains, but just shitty Hag players

Nothing beats starting a new season at rank 10 surv and getting matched with rank 1-4 killers and rank 17-20 teammates.
---
*Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well*
---
Damn Boil Over. Killers are going to be salty
---
Wrong. both
---
Maybe that's because u need to find totem before it is shown on the map
---
Really? Is this a thing?
---
Idk how to deal with this, but I might as well say that, with flip flop, half of the recover progress is converted to wiggle
---
FUCK YES 150K FLIP FLOP BO HERE I CONE
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one in this time of need
---
Claudette is the only survivor worse than nea
---
Yes, that's the way map works. Why do u think it has range addons?
---
Yeah that perk was also used
---
Blood pressure level increased.
---
Is it a exploit or not ? The guy was ranting is this some what if a efficient way to use the perks he had
---
So am I gonna post the part 4 copypasta or does someone else wanna do it?
---
So to be clear, you have to physically see totem, and when it is shown on a map? It won't be shown if it's behind a wall?
---
I just broke my phone screen mashing that like button
---
I think so, considering the only way to counter it I'd to have iron grasp and/or agitation
---
*Laughs in nurse main*
---
You need to be in the detention range of the map, u don't necessarily need to see objects for it to be added to the map .
---
Lmaooo this is almost every game on console.
---
If survivor tbags me at pallets and windows, flashlight clicks me, and emote spams, which, in this game means pure "fuck you" to the killer, and generally tries to make me feel bad, and it does make feel bad because its toxic and its basically a "fuck you bitch", then I have no regrets in making him feel bad while letting all other survivors escape, (via facecamping, slugging till the collapse kills him, and tbagging when I play as GhostFace) its basically something like "a taste of your own medicine". Plus, you wanted my attention, you wanted to annoy me? Here you are. Happy bleeding out till EGC kills you when all of your teammates are in exit gates. (this is gonna get so downvoted lmao)
---
Who cares, buy ash to play as ash, not for useless perks.
---
I remember one time when I joined his killer game and me and 2 other survivors escaped, he was saying me ("sad act") and 2 other people (also "sad acts") were stalking and harassing him while it was my first and only game I've played against him in the whole week. Basically, if you happen to have a counter-build (for example OoO which I'm always running and they're playing a stealth killer) or playing better than a rank 20 baby Meg, then you have a good chance of getting called a sniper either by Tru3 or the chat or both. 
---
Streamsniping is apparently bannable, you just have to figure that out by yourself. And let me explain how this works.
---
You see, "Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience" is bannable, streamsniping (which isn't bannable, according to the rules) is already targeting specific users (1/3 of the rule), could be repeatedly as well, for example if you join the same streamer's lobby more than once, that's already repeatedly (2/3 of the rule), ruining the game experience is very subjective since everyone has their own definition of it. Some crybaby will say their game was ruined because they couldn't get a 3k or a 4k or they got a safe pip etc., if the streamer is a crybaby (I'm not talking about Tru3 or any other streamer right now, just an example) and they see a loss as a ruined game, then a sniper that wants to win against a streamer is essentially ruining their game experience (3/3 of the rule). Who to trust? The rules say that playing against a streamer (simply joining their lobby) isn't bannable but then all the rules of griefing apply and make it a bannable offense. 
---
Oh and btw, you can "snipe" the lobby without getting any unfair advantages, confirm that you're in their game and pause the stream. You don't need to look at the stream if you just want to play against a specific streamer.
---
The problem is not 32/40 second heal time, the problem is when people heal themselves. Most people have 0 map awareness and what is happening in the game while they are healing in a corner. They sit in one spot and will do absolutely nothing while they are healing. Like one person is dying on a hook on the other side of the map, another person just got hit and is being chased, third one is dead or being slugged and you need help from a guy who is healing in a corner person, but nope, he's gonna heal, let hooked person die, the guy who was chased is now downed, killer finds easily with BBQ where the person who healed is, down him in 10 seconds and it's a GG.
---
*Has flashbacks of people calling Self Care OP*
---
I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs the survivors fault but looking at the killers perspective you can‚Äôt just go anything in this situation I guess
---
I‚Äôve been thinking this for a while but couldn‚Äôt be arsed to properly write out exactly what I mean, but you have just hit the nail on the head. Self care is clearly one of the best survivor perks in the game, and the circlejerk against it is unjust. However, I will add that not everybody needs it, I don‚Äôt run it on most builds because I don‚Äôt feel I need it, I‚Äôm happy enough to be injured because I‚Äôm good at looping the killer and breaking a chase. But if you‚Äôre not good at breaking a chase, don‚Äôt think ‚Äòoh I can‚Äôt use self care because people on reddit say it‚Äôs bad‚Äô.
---
wow good point in this discussion about perks usefulness !!
---
wait...
---
Its confirmed that every survivor perk is toxic.
---
So you need to get map scout pop up to start seeing totems? Sounds stupid.
---
After maiming hag for almost a year now, I recognize this as one of the biggest new hag mistakes and where the ‚Äúwow hag is bad‚Äù thought process comes from because they waste 6-8 traps on the hook and walk at people. What I tend to preemptively do is actually trap the hook ahead of time because it lets me just hook and go, so I know SWF will tell their teammates ‚Äúoh she didn‚Äôt trap the hook just bum rush it‚Äù and then I still pull off a defense.
---
I think u don't quite understand what exploit means. It doesn't give him advantages because of game bug or cheats, he just using his perks to their full potential
---
That would be op
---
the what ?
---
Never see many posts about killers being toxic while you see around 5 posts a days about survivors being toxic.
---
they did that in the ptb but removed getting stacks for safe unhooks because they thought it was too easy
---
Hooks are also killer belongings and u get map scout for every new object you add to the map
---
I dunno. I get more nervous as Survivor since there are people constantly counting on me. But that could just be me, the spaz who just recently started playing Survivor after playing literally only killer since Freddy was added. Yes, I mean *literally*.
---
I thought it was because people still complained about it. But as it is it's almost unusable.
---
He can still bleed out. Unbreakable is only one time use so he has to rely on his teammates and u can use it as a bait
---
That would be kinda useless against swf.
---
Aight, so I know all these people are telling you different stuff, and while adrenaline is *technically* her best perk, I think you should equip Plunderer's Instinct until you get chest spawn locations down.  Chests can make or break a game, and learning their spawns early on can help you win more, as well as get free items.
---
Someone who doesn't teabag or taunt.
---
Didn't know hillbilly was more thicc then LF
---
actually ? Use it on Trapper if you see one toolbox
---
That‚Äôs the dumbest shit I‚Äôve read all day. And I‚Äôve read some dumb shit today. You want useful  perks to go with who you‚Äôre playing as, so why not make one of his useful?
---
I've been playing this game for a long time now. Mostly i don't really mind that much, but sometimes the state of the meta and the community still just gets to me a bit. I usually don't even say anything after the match, cause honestly, what's the point really? But this time i just felt the need to say something, even if this team probably wasn't even around to see it. And yeah, i double lost the match cause that's probably what they wanted, a response. I know that the killers are there to kill and the survivors there to survive... But jesus christ there are so many ways you can go about playing this game and naturally i can't force anyone to play in a particular way. I don't really even know what the point to this post is actually. The worst survivors aren't going to change and the devs are aware how a lot of people play their game and they don't seem to care either. All this post amounts to is me wasting 15 minutes of my life, but here it is.
---
If he/ she plays really well or funny thats usually when I decide to let him/her live.
---
The other Option is if I have completely wrecked the whole team and the last guy has ether given up due to hopeless positioning of the exit gates or Im just feeling like it.
---
Normally the last survivor gets to leave. I only spare survivors during the match if everyone agreed to farm in the lobby.
---
My favorite recent quote about hag putting 10 traps near the hook is: "This is what someone does who ranks hag as a D-Tier killer."
---
Just wait until the next double bp event.  Ive scored ~200k before.  It's so nice to reduce the grind.
---
Its broken hitboxes.
---
I think they've done a pretty good job so far
---
Yes.Taking out SWF will definitely hurt the game.I almost exclusively play SWF cuz of my gf,otherwise I wouldn't play surv at all,or very rarely because it's not fun as solo.
---
Also y'all acting like all SWF are SAS SEAL TEAM 6 special forces or something.The extreme cases you mention are quite rare.More often these people are here to fuck around,if you think SWF is super OP and should be removed at all costs you're an entitled killer main
---

---
Self Care mostly for me means 32 seconds wasted when I could be working on a gen so everyone can get out, or Adrenaline to heal me.
---
Ill usually let the person that's clearly not great of a player go but sometimes ill end up killing them on accident and then just let whoever is last go unless they were annoying/useless/sandbagging.
---
it's as useless as left behind atm. idk why they thought it would be too strong.
---
*Big brain intensifies
---
lol for me its the other way around
---
I didn't say that...
---
a killer can become crippled because their first swing on a survior lagged out, and the rest of the game can be set by the tone of that misfortune. 
---
the survivor makes it to a window, manages to stabilize around strong loops, ruin gets popped, 3 gens done etc.
---
all four survivors can literally fuck around, hold m1 (gens, totems, unhooks, heals, exit gates) and still escape handily with a litany of second chances like adrenaline, borrowed time, decisive strike, unbreakabill, pink key, or just secure a free hatch escape etc. 
---
I'm not saying it's always a cakewalk for survivors, but it's almost never a cakewalk for killer anymore, no matter how good you are.
---
It's 100% map dependent
---
Ormond or Haddonfield; you're fucked as killer. Disturbed Ward or the one with the church I think (and clown car)- gonna be sweat. Every other map is pretty standard or easily in your favour.
---
I wouldn't say Left Behind useless. I can still manage to get it off but it's extremely rare and half the time I don't get a stack when I should.
---
Hearing gone guru for the first time made me shit myself as a little kid, imagine hearing that In game I‚Äôd be so scared lol
---
Thank you, they were scary if you didn‚Äôt use Adams chainsaw
---
You mean Kate Denson I assume. Nobody likes fatties!
---
Tone the edginess down just a tad, pardner
---
If ash is an ‚Äúiconic horror icon that‚Äôs extremely important‚Äù, and survivors are just skin of one another anyway, then surely you wouldn‚Äôt mind just being able to play as this absolute icon right? ‚ÄúWah wah, I‚Äôm mad I cant pay for as much power as I used to be able to‚Äù
---
It's just silly. The goal of course is to escape. But It's a team game for survivors. Escape together, at all costs. That's your goal. Don't just leave your allies to die because you're too scared to unhook them while I'm literally across the map.
---
I mean you can still blow into to it
---
as far as survivor unsure but killer definitely bubba for BB&amp;C and if you have him I would reccomend spirit
---
With that being said. If the gates open, you should still try. If the killer has Noed, okay. I can understand leaving. If they're camping, alright understandable dip out. But at least make an effort. It's just a good thing to do. :)
---
bubba is fine, the problem with him is everyone uses him to camp survivors making him look weak, ive used him without camping and did extremely well
---
I agree with this. I never run self care because of the time it takes just to heal yourself when you could be working on a gen.
---
Yeah Legion as a whole just feels really rushed and uninspired, as it stands right now the only purpose of them being multiple people is to sell cosmetics.
---
since they introduced the end game collapse its almost impossible to do a gen when you're the last survivor.
---
As a survivor I hate the meat plant and hospital. Got to take the rough with the smooth.
---
Some mas are good for killers, some aren't. Win some lose some.
---
Imagine beeing able to do this on purpose
---
No that's what flashlight are for
---
Ok, it's clear now, thanks.
---
But stun is different than blindness stunning the killer is fun
---
It might be fun for you but it's frustrating for the killer
---
i love baby Hags
---
It was. I redownloaded DBD just to grab it.
---
Yeah I believe lunges' range/distance is actually based on the killer's current movement speed. Notice Myer's short lunge at EW I and longer lunge at EW III, as well as Spirit's post phase lunge.
---
Diversion needs a buff and also 3 seconds cant make such a difference  5 seconds is a little too much for a pebble I know its frustrating for the killer but it just seems like a fun buff like a game mode with kyf dodge the pebble and also Adam's other two perks need love diversion now is kinda hard to pull off I feel it just needs extra love
---
It‚Äôs chill playing killer when you just insidious in the basement as bubba.  Don‚Äôt got to worry about anything but your chest.
---
I would seriously like here why he isn't.
---
That's because Hillbilly is a rip off of Leatherface.

Isn't this the plot of Dream Warriors, more or less?
---
He's in that trash tier, but I'd argue Legion is worse.
---
I had a Hag put all her traps around my hooked teammate when the exit gates were open - we both still got out, but it was like a bad jump scare.üòÇ
---
Actually the perk is called "Bitter Murmur"- a murmur is a low continous sound!   
---
" Unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability. " - It's simply flavor text. 
---
What the perk does, is it reveals any enemies surrounding the generator when it's fully reparied. DBD has a tendency to add flavor text to the perks and addons. I guess it's to help immersion, but I completely understand your confusion! :) 
---
Regarding the metal spoon:
---
What it does is that it increases the SPEED of the charge, not the TIME it takes to charge.
---
Boil Over mitigates the effects of Iron grasp and vice versa :)
---
No killers van one shot People soooooooo
---
As it should be. Ignoring hits is a terrible unhealthy thing from the concept. Should never have been in the game.
---
I hate that people use this format as a replacement for the Lisa meme. Considering that's not how it was used in the show.
---
I just got my first merciless win as Legion on mobile last night and I scared my brother a little cause I was grinning and muttering.
---
Legion can at least slow survivors down with mending imo. Leatherface has nothing going for him without perks
---
So insta downs also shouldn't be in the game?
---
You have to play differently if you want to climb the ranks - the higher the rank, the more *interesting* the difference.
---
Note that once you reach rank 15 you will never be able to go any lower - there's a decent amount of "casual but highly skilled" players to be found there.
---
Rank 16 and lower is either new players, players so casual that they never hit 15, or very dedicated permasmurfs.
---
Too many survivors think a trap makes them invincible. If a wounded survivor runs near me I'm going for them.
---
Needs candles, little hanging bottles, and a smoldering black fog emanating from the base.
---
Perfry otherwise.
---
I do it everytime when I chase a survivor who is good at running and I always lean forward when carrying survivor hoping I would get there fast? XD
---
Idk about anyone else but me full forward is the only way I play dbd.
---
Eh i wouldnt say its bad, IMO and alot of others they just wanna play the game normally and they find that way of pkaying boring
---
Can diversion get a buff like give it more meters to be thrown and and it can charge in chase
---
It's a broad answer, but accurate: **Buy the meta perks for any licensed survivor or killer that you never intend to actually play.**
---
If it can be earned, earn it - it doesn't take long if you're in a Bloodpoint event or if you've saved up relevant Offerings.
---
Most people don‚Äôt realize is that they use the perk specifically for the endgame. They do t try to fail. They want to have an  advantage late in the game.
---
Also it is an horrible map for myers and ghostface. Cant stalk but they can easily see you.
---
repost time
---
r/woooosh
---
He's the best camper in the game. He has to potential to make great things happen as unlikely as they may be. Legion is too linear and their power is too bad.
---
If you want to balance around the %1 and forget the rest,that's wrong,especially with this shit ranking system.Tell me,what was the last time you got absolutely wrecked by 4 SWF?cuz I definitely don't remember.And I don't know if you played solo survivor for long periods of time,but I can tell you that it gets boring after a while.What I'm trying to tell you is the playerbase will get smaller over time if SWF gets removed,even if 3 or 4 man parties are removed.Also 2 man parties can be organized as much as 3 or 4 man parties,just knowing who's going to the hook or not or remotely knowing where the killer is as 2 SWF is pretty much the same as 4 SWF if the other 2 are smart enough.
---
most toolboxes literally just take 5,6 seconds off a gen.  you dont have to make a salty thread on here everytime you lose a game
---
Mostly just cause I couldn‚Äôt catch the last one
---
The game is balanced around instadowns. I don't see how you think a perk that made bad killers worse and didn't effect the top tier killers is okay.
---
Every pallet on The Game is safe, and due to the map's small size, you can easily get to a pallet in the time it takes the Killer to break one. Plus it's too small for perks like BBQ, Devour Hope and Make Your Choice to be effective.
---
L√©ry's has a million windows and renders the powers of Trapper, Hillbilly, Nurse, Leatherface, Huntress, Clown and Plague useless.
---
Have you done a flashlight one? I die a little inside when I see people use odd bulb or any other non battery/grip(on yellows only)/filament addons
---
the only thing that is the problem here is your grammar
---
What rank are you? Facecamping tends to fall into three... er... *camps*. First is novice killers who don't understand that playing killer is a time management simulator, second are killers that are built around snowballing from the first hook, and the final group are killers that are getting steamrolled and have no other choice.
---
Now, you can certainly use Borrowed Time and/or Decisive Strike in order to make the second hook harder ***if*** you're saved, but bear in mind that the next step from facecamping is slugging, so you'll very quickly end up blowing all your perks on handling a very specific situation.
---
Bubba is actually way thiccer than billy
---
You will be waiting for a long time then.BBQ was in the Shrine about a month ago
---
Got it, thank you!
---
I'm expecting that.
---
Ignore the comments, neckbeards can never resist the opportunity to be snarky fuckwits. I actually have never looked at his 80s gear, so I didn't realize there was Fresh Prince flavor text. Thanks for posting this.
---
i legit didnt know someone made one, i made this one, you can tell cause that little crop messup with the image at the top
---
That unlikeliness is the sole reason I consider him the absolute worst. Against good survivors, a leatherface can‚Äôt do shit as they‚Äôre not gonna be messing up and giving him a chance. But you‚Äôre right in Legion not being much better either. He is really linear and his mending isn‚Äôt that much of a threat at all, it‚Äôs only upside is that survivors have to waste time doing it on top of needing to be healed. The time spent doing that gives legion an edge, as small as it is. And I feel that difference is what makes legion better. He‚Äôs useless, but at least he‚Äôs consistent.
---
ngl i didn't know this was posted before, i made this one
---
Lmao I never said OG Mettle is okay. It was fucked and OP. You should've had to work for that extra hit from the start. But saying that a perk that ignores your health should've never been in the game, makes you sound like a hypocrite when going back and start defending ista-downs. Which also ignore your health state obviously.
---
Die.
---
This is the subreddit where a new player asking a question gets attacked for it. It's honestly not surprising.
---
Ikr, i was the kate and watched this clip after the game. "I did that to get more points".. right
---
This is getting fixed with dedicated servers.
---
Legion doesn't really gain time with mend because he has to spend too much time to apply it. If you get hit with frenzy you can mend immediately and be done before he hits another survivor. Leather face will eventually catch someone in a deadzone.
---
But why would he protect it? He can't get the item anyway, or am I missing something?
---
And that was when you only had to 4k!
---
I couldn't imagine doing it now.
---
Two is the magic number for me too, I normally put one next to the hook then one just off in the direction I think they're going to run off too, the second one definitely comes in handy, especially if you are running Devour Hope

A good nurse doesn‚Äôt rely on predictions. She has two blinks. If you turn a corner, she should blink to the corner and then to you. If you stayed there for a ‚Äúmind game‚Äù she‚Äôll just smack you. If you went around, she has a second blink to get to you.

oh shut up‚Ä¶ you don't understood the slightest thing i said‚Ä¶
---
for not smart people : balance have to be made around high rank solo survivors teams. Those are not 1% of the playerbase. They are the players who play the most and against which it's healthy to play as killer.
---
All the previous rank get completely wrekt by every killers. The only time it's not the case is at rank reset when avaregae killer player will encounter experiment survivors who need to pip to get back to the rank they belong.
---
Obviously swf playing to win are going to be encounter in red rank, that's like very basic logic. So of course when killer reach those ranks they will often verse them and think that their character is underperforming while in fact it's simply that they should lose against those survivor teams organized around external communication.

Is the huntress free? I play PS4 and I don't have her unlocked

Adrenaline, and when u get better perks replace dark sense, its not that good

Will I be invisible in the moment when I see blind icon? Because you are able to see blind icon while you are opening and entering the locker so I am not sure if it works like that as well. Also 1 more question. If he hooks someone can you instantly after he hooks someone exit the locker or you still have to wait 4 seconds inside to hide your aura? Thanks for explanation.
---
Surely it would have been better but you don't always have the opportunity. You should have used it on yourself to avoid camping.
---
Killers are 1 person. If all 4 survivors get MoM off that effectively adds a fifth survivor with 2 hook states to the game. Like I said the game is balanced around instadowns.
---
Both are bad, but legions power is at least useful for something.
---
Just a meme, my dude.
---
So sad but true
---
Steam link?
---
That layout is slick AF bruh.
---
shit perks
---
It's a question of what you are used too, the same as crows. It it's in your habit to watch over such things, you will notice it even on the ground, though it really stands out on indoors tiles, like shack, buildings or absolutely anywhere on Gideon/Lery's.
---
But. If killer have Bloodhound, it's not even a question then, you just can't miss blood with this perk. And it's also hard to miss blood with Sloppy Butcher, and that's a fairly common perk.
---
stop bragging, we dont even have shrine of secrets on mobile smh
---
lol noob huntress, ur so badddafdaf2 /s
---
I know you meant Hag, but when I read it I thought of Roadhog from OW haha.  that would be a fun killer with that chain pull
---
Well I mean, I just want to complete my no hook build :).
---
And MAYBE thrilling tremors.
---
Does it come with all the dlc?
---
rip shards. you can do what you want with shards but i still suggest that you dont use shards for BP. maybe save it for DLC's or other good perks that may show up on the shrine, unless you have every DLC or perk i guess..
---
I guess you're right. It just sucks since both killers could be made mid tier with only number changes.
---
I wonder why does the game cost this much on the Switch? Does it come with some DLC's already included?
---
As far as I know, no.
---
Anyways no DLC published, so better we wait.
---
I like the sleeveless jacket and the short jeans and her dark and light hair. Very charismatic :3
---
He isn't saying that people shouldn't be able to play with their friends.  
---
He's stating the fact that SWF breaks the games balance because the ability of coordinating your team through voice coms isn't intended for DbD.  
---
You don't need perks like Kindred, Bond and Self-Care anymore.  
---
The game loses it chaotic moments.  
---
The killer faces a big time pressure.  
---
Let's say you've hooked one.  
---
In a random game maybe 2-3 stop working on their gen to go for the safe, which gives you additional time as killer.  
---
In a SWF game you just say: "I'll go for the safe. Keep working on gens."   
---
And just by a little call out like that you'll have a 2 gen difference.  
---
And thats just one little example.  
---
There are a lot of entitled survivor mains who think SWF is completely balanced and fine, and they rather want solo games to be like SWF, which is just ...  
---
Well. It baffles me.  
---
Makes me think they never played a killer game above yellow ranks.
---
I don't really know if DLCs are included... But Nintendo is... Nintendo.
---
most often i do one on gens and one on a hook to slow the survs down because they know there can be a trap. The best traps are always the random traps, every tome they rin into it lmao
---
Most people who play trapper or wraith run Noed (Cause they honestly need it), and just about every other killer has the skill potential to where an extra hit would do nothing but prevent the inevitable.
---
&gt;If they can regularly win,it means solo teams have no chance
---
what,that makes literally no sense.also "for not smart people" lmao.you're taking this on a different level.if you're going to keep insulting like r/iamverysmart you're not worth making a conversation with.
---
And you still don't get my point.If they remove swf those people won't start playing solo suddenly,they will flatout quit(most of them at least),which will increase queue times by a lot.
---
What makes you think swf is unbeatable or something?You're not supposed to win every match,it's a hard to swallow pill but things happen.
---
Also why not ask every ranks opinion on a killer about how they should be balanced instead of just top players?If they would do that every killer would get too strong and lower ranks will suffer more,the game needs new players too,remember?
---
everyone knows you use anti for helping others, styptic agent for yourself
---
like any other ultra rare offering.
---
Well, I imagine a majority of the player base don‚Äôt make it to green ranks...
---
I play both Killer and SWF because being a survivor just isn‚Äôt fun without friends IMO
---
Not really, I always left the last survivor escape. Even if they were toxic.
---
but what about shirtless dwight
---
His abilitys are really good if you use them right. You dont always have to preplace snares i use them mid chase to shut down loops and get a hit from a slow vault. Old freddy was fun yes but really lame at the same time. You can also fake a teleport which is nice to make survivors think your going there. Its always satisfying as hell when a survivor throws down a fake pallet too.
---
If you stay there it's deserved. It's just necessary to switch up those methods. 
---
If you yourself don't know what you're doing that's 200IQ
---
You're going to love it when double bloodpoints comes round.
---
But without the phone talky bit
---
The game is going to come with the following DLCs included for free:
---
- Of Flesh and Mud
---
- Spark of Madness
---
- Lullaby for the Dark
---
- Curtain Call
---
- Shattered Bloodlines
---
- The 80s Suitcase
---
- The Bloodstained Sack
---
- Headcase
---
- Exclusive Trapper Cosmetic
---
I mean flip flop is kind of good but situational
---
I know I‚Äôm an idiot!!! I was looking at the video when making this video and i was like Im a dumbass 
---
Oh well lol
---
I'm shaming on someone who's shaming on me, that's hypocricy.
---
Okay, that's better.
---
Wasn't Lubally for the Dark already for free?
---
Still rule 3, blur the names.
---
Yes, but people often get confused on it
---
Yeah but you gotta have your build revolve around it, pair it up with Unbreakable, Boil Over and Tenacity and you'll be unsluggable
---
God Mode USB hack
---
Nice.
---
What are the best addons on him?
---
This-
---
Basement chest guarding is a thing?-
---
*clueless Legion*
---
'Aight then. Hold on.
---
You just don‚Äôt know how to use him honestly. You can slap down snares mid chase for a free M1
---
Wish Bubba had a map .-.
---
Maybe it's cuz gens pop ridiculously fast even with "pressure".
---
I do this on GTA V is when I‚Äôm in a mission
---
What about a reverse borrowed time kind of. Could be a shit idea but here it is anyway.
---
"If you unhook in the killers radius your next distraction hit doesn't change your health state"
---
So you could unhook someone and get a free extra body block.
---
Maybe limited number of uses per match?
---
This map in the picture was actually fixed, can confirm as when I played on the map the basement was normal sized
---
You need to put a double line break on mobile to separate them.
---
Look at that sick ramp on the roof, wheel-bound killer &amp; survivor confirmed
---
That doorway in the picture sure as shit isn't fixed.
---
I actually kinda like that idea
---
OMG its a meme its exaggerated and only here to be funny. Dont give it such a value to fuck you up about that XD
---
Who knows how old the screenshot is?
---
Ah, thanks! I'm aware I can edit but might as well keep it like this. New to reddit so haha.
---
&gt;Do you want them to blacklist discord, skype, mumble, etc like some extremist suggest? 
---
No, that'd be stupid.
---
&gt;A much more reasonable solution would be for bhvr to add text chat for survivors, even out the playing ground
---
This is better. 
---
The biggest problem is that solo survivors aren't able to pip as easily or earn as much BP. So the devs have two options: nerf SWF groups so that their escape rates are around the same as solo survivors, or buff solo survivors so that their escape rate is the same as SWF players. Once both sides are roughly even, then you can start balancing killer around it.
---
Yeah, everyone who disagrees with you is a clown, Bozo.
---
it's a meme. Basement Bubba, Box Guardian, etc. you'll find different names for it.
---
im still sad the devs lied about the not doing exclusives anymore but decided to do them again for switch
---
Yes. Except for the snares and the fake pallets, there's really no reason to wake up.
---
All they need to do is rework their "Protection Hit" detection. I really tried to get this to work but often I just don't get a protection hit registered when it should.
---
Pretty obvious but I would try to level the hag for her teacheble hex ruin so you can get ruin on all your killers that's always nice and realy good. And maybe level the nurse for a nurse is calling teacheble. Specially on the pig, with sloppy butcher ( that you already have on her) it's a nice combo. I can't realy think of any perks that are especially good on pig or doc but to be honest you're playing pretty weak killers, But if you like to play them I can respect that. Oh yeah and I would not play with unreleanting it's Pretty weak and unhealthy to get used to you can better improve on not missing hits. Btw this is coming from a hard survivor main that isn't a great killer sooo... Sorry in advance for the grammar mistakes I'm not a native speaker and autocorection on my Phone isn't realy helping
---
Thats about right
---
I think so. It looks more like a drama.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfJpyBgcgA
---
Will Smith uploaded a video with the cast talking about it on his own channel pretty recently too.
---
Yeah and those just are not a good enough reason usually.
---
can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not
---
The game was also full of more unpolished elements like shitloads of bugs and infinites. Some players continued to join each others lobbies by rejoining again and again, still.
---
Happening on pc too
---
You are not alone buddy, I really liked the old Freddy too
---
I was playing against a Freddy... I only knew when I got in the dream world
---
dude, i would love to never play hospital or saw map again, if that means i would play farm and school only then bring it
---
I find a swarm of Claudette's and neas to be he easiest to get a perfect win against. Their need to get up in my face gives me all the pips and bloodpoints I could ask for, and it's not hard to get the 4 kills
---
Could have them as well as the existing survivors
---
Wish Bubba had a reason to be played beyond getting BBQ and Chili
---
The sleeveless jackets are some good ones. I use the black shorts with the black and white cat shirt, and then the dark skies hair. I love her dark and light hair but with what I have on her I don't think it'd match up too well.
---
I want to get her neon crop hoody because with what I have it looks nice, but it's a mix of not having the cells for it at the moment, and also people always see Neon as toxic, and I don't really play toxic at all.
---
*laughs in console's 10FPS
---
Except last time I played the map, it was a big opening like other maps...
---
I don't think that perk should exist, it promotes tunneling the poor fella who just got off the hook.
---
All PS4 patches require you to have enough free space to cover a "basic" install *plus* the actual patch content being downloaded.
---
It's why even trivial game updates will give you a prompt about making more space available. It's not as bad on DBD but if you're playing large titles (GTA, RDR, Battlefront) then it can be utterly maddening.
---
Buying a bigger drive is not an ideal solution, but that's a story for another time.
---
Seen a bit of this lately, a survivor pointing to the locker I'm in on purpose... funny tho cause the killer let me escape and killed him for being a douche and later msged me saying "someone had to live to tell the tale" props to that killer.
---
Franklins and knockout are pretty good as well, and I personally find him fun to play. It's just that he ain't top tier.
---
I don‚Äôt pick anyone. NO Mercy!
---
Thats not a reason to play LF, that's a reason to buy him and level him while playing a killer that's fun and effective.
---
Iron will and false scratch marks.
---
The you realise that he was stalking the whole time and you see that EW tier 3 has activated and you all get downed
---
new hag players that do this make my soul cry.
---
It also works when they are passively pulled into it
---
As a Killer- How much do you hate slugging? This is important
---
Lol yeah just grab her chapter off the PlayStation store she's free
---
Since when did the developers of the F13 game get their hands on DbD?
---
I like yamaoka, mainly for visuals, it looks beautiful but I also like it gameplay wise.
---
Doctor is better than what most people give him credit for
---
Clucked*
---
And then you try to signal to your teammate that he killers coming but he stays on the gen and gets grabbed
---
I prefered the old one too tbh
---
Ye it's my favorite hobby after dying at the first hook.
---
I'm in the killer position regardless of which I'm playing
---
You're hidden as soon as you see the icon as far as I know. It appears while you're closing the door of the locker iirc. 99% of the time you want to do a rush action to enter it anyway so the entering animation takes like half a second.
---
You need to wait inside the locker to hide the aura for the entire duration. If you exit right after the hook he will be able to see your aura.
---
OP, youre mad that killers can properly counter your 360s?
---
Cute
---
200?
---
They only need to rework add ons
---
i‚Äôm rank 8 with my wraith. No ruin. Just sadness
---
I had that bug as a killer too...had to dc or else we would have been there for ever...so annoying.
---
Was waiting to see if there would be anything worth my shards, looks like i'll just be buying Plague with them after all.
---
I agree with you, but some numbers might be tweaked. In my idea, i'd like to show the whole wealth of aspects, this perk would affect to, instead of only the healing speed debuff.
---
&gt; And who misses skillchecks these days.
---
Believe me, there are some people, who miss them. As i sad, the persentage of skillchecks zone reduction could be tweaked as well.
---
Yeah I was stretching, we played maybe 3 or 4 games in the last week. 
---
The queue times are sometimes upwards of 20 minutes and we don't have all day to sit there and wait.
---
That's just murphy's law.  There are a lot of slugging killers, and perks like Flip flop and unbreakable are tools to use against them.  
---
There are plenty of great perk's to use, but if you're looking for what flip flop does, it does it pretty well.
---
I agree with you, but am i experiencing some kind of bug because these 2 maps are the only one i am getting at the moment
---
OH WOW
---
That argument that survivors having to earn adrenaline isn't always true since you can get it by your team doing poorly and the killer closes the hatch then pop you have adrenaline for not even completing all the gens. 
---
Noed counters adrenaline it's just the way it is, both have to wait until end game for them to pop and atleast with noed there's a chance it won't activate or survivors get lucky and the totem lits up right by them and you can get rid of it. I won't sit here and act like it doesn't suck to get one shotted at the end of a game but its really not that big of a deal
---
I know what it means. I‚Äôm lamenting that people get so upset at getting their nose rubbed in a failure. It‚Äôs shit talking. It‚Äôs fun.
---
Should give a bonus to gens for each dead survivor, that's way it can be useful
---
To the people who keep saying this...
---
Just because a bug you have been experiencing  wasn't fixed in the hotfix, or in the known issues, doesn't mean BHVR isn't working on a fixed for that bug. If they haven't fixed it, it's either because they couldn't get it out this hotfix or they don't know how to reproduce the bug.
---
So what is the best thing to do than?
---
If you really want BHVR to be aware of your issue,  every Friday, on this subreddit, there's a Weekend Bug Report &amp; Tech Support Thread. Put your system, the bug, steps to reproduce, etc. Doing this won't just show BHVR the importance of this bug, but it will also significantly help them be able to fix it.
---
That's it. See you in The Fog.
---
Clamps/wrench don't increase great skill check success zones, only good
---
Hacksaw and wires wonderful for sabo daily
---
I was the bitch who did it mid chase üò≠üò≠
---
Ugh I hate when a killer kills more than one of us, they are so sweaty; don't they understand that there is someone who is playing behind the masks of a survivor?
---
1 DC, less than a minute into the game. Game ended early, entity displeased, -1 pip
---
Good one. Fits perfectly with his onesie.
---
Is that really easier than hooking survivors for BBQ? I dont even get much out of the aura reading but I bring it every match to get crazy BPs.
---
Not that bad, but I'd suggest changing the title to something like Hex: Broken Spirit or something like that, feels a bit to long
---
Even if the last one stays in the game and is rank 1, I don't care and give him the hatch and maybe some farming too. Dcing is just the most stupid thing to do in this game
---
what
---
That's what i thought as well, but when you think about it, it can be really powerful
---
Why is nea sometimes called the killer? I have watched a lot of youtube and parodies, and i dont get why?
---
Funny, laughed
---
Just hide behind one of the pillars. Killer can‚Äôt see you and you also can kinda view outside the exit gate
---
There is never a reason to dc.
---
well..i wouldnt use the hex perk..you're basically giving them free points.
---
use the basement perk or the no red stain at bloodlust 1.
---
so yeah just learn from ur mistakes..dont take your loss to heart and keep grinding.
---
There needs to be an actual repercussion for DC‚Äôing for it to stop
---
mike myers plumbing eh? last time i called him i just ended up with more leaks
---
adrenaline ofc
---
Not really.
---
The point of Self Care is to not remain injured. The point of Iron Will is to remain stealthy while injured. 
---
You'll only really be using Iron Will to stay safe while healing, which is a bit of a waste.
---
I'm the opposite? I feel a lot more focused playing survivor. You have a lot more control of the game as killer
---
Kill then all right?
---
When youre just getting started dont worry about wins and losses, just focus on figuring out how to play. Also be sure to try a few different killers to get a sense of what kind of killer you enjoy playing as the most.
---
The Game used to be one of the only map killer sided, now it's a pain in the ass to play on it against survivors who know how to play the game, or just where the pallets are.
---
Useful for knowing which exit gate the killer is going for, so you can make the right choice to hide/open
---
I still don‚Äòt understand what‚Äòs supposed to be toxic about flashlight saves, i mean it‚Äòs a fucking game mechanic and a very easily avoidable one aswell
---
Fair enough, I'm not trying to argue. I'm just saying i use ir, sc, balanced, botany, works quite well
---
Am a hag, I do that. ~~Bloodpoints yes.~~
---
It is very nice I think. Have you thought about adding French translation ?
---
Lol sounds about right
---
Firstly, I'd like to know if you're on console or PC. This would help me figuring out the best way to help out, since most of the time, you can do really well as a killer regardless of your perks. It just requires patience and practice. I rarely ever use NOED, but I don't fault you for using it if you have nothing better.   
---
What a lot of people here are saying are some good perks, like Nurse's Calling, and Hex: RUIN. However, you should keep in mind on which killers you use which perks, since some killers are more supposed to be stealthy, and others are more supposed to be aggressive, and put pressure on the map for all survivors.
---
The Pig lacks map pressure, but she has stealth. Which means that in order to utilize that, you would do good to use perks such as A Nurse's Calling, and BBQ plus a perk like Hex: RUIN if you're good at protecting objectives. 
---
The Doctor, on the other hand strives to have as much presence on the entire map at the same time. Using addons that increase his terror radius in 'treatment' mode, means that you can eventually make your victims scream to reveal their location, meaning Distressing is a must-have perk for him. I wouldn't use A Nurse's Calling with him, though, since the main reason it was so desired on doctor had been taken away a long time ago.
---
An example of a good perk for the Doctor would be: Distressing, BBQ &amp; Chili, Brutal Strength, Bamboozle. The reason this setup works well, is that the Doctor's abilities are good for tracking, but they don't help him in chases all that much, unless you are experienced with zapping people before they're about to vault or drop a pallet, and quickly switch to your main weapon to hit them, since every zap 'stuns' a survivor, and stops them from performing such actions. The reason Brutal Strength works really well, is because it allows you to break pallets quicker, and either let a fake one spawn with one of your addons, or take it away for future chases, making future ones easier.
---
Since you probably don't have access to bamboozle (Clown), I would then replace it with Hex: RUIN.
---
Just like he is under no obligation to help the killer, the killer is under no obligation to let him live. No one told him to let the killer use him. He made that choice on his own.
---
Yeah really only the first three lil paragraphs were directed towards your post. Then I went off on a tangent completely unrelated that I was gonna just turn into its own post but didn't LMAO üòÇ.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong, to each their own. But I personally find it redundant.
---
Different strokes for different folks!
---
Yea. Leatherface would be an excrement covered ass of a 30year old NEET that has only eaten tendies and never seen a shower
---
That would be brutal. I'd love to see it from the survivors PoVüòÇ
---
Tbh I don't really use items or addons, except some low-tier brown ones every now and then. I don't have any mains yet for killer or a survivor that I usually play, as I'm still spreading my BP around to get teachables for both sides which leaves me with a pretty limited selection of addons/items. As for queue times, at least on Xbox NA, I'd estimate my average killer queue time to be around 2-3 minutes whereas survivor around 1 minute so overall I still think I'm making far more BP as killer especially if you factor in the games I get tunneled or facecamped and end up making like 6000 points for that survivor game.
---
They've changed it a couple of times already. I can only thing of one bullshit window still left and that's in Torment Creek.
---
Wraith's invisibility supresses his terror radius and makes him faster. Old Freddy's invisibility was essentially a gimmick that didn't affect gameplay unless you play with your game muted.
---
I‚Äôm nice when I play survivor in the post game chat. 
---
When I‚Äôm a killer I‚Äôm a cunt because THE ENTITY FEEDS ON SALT, IT IS THE NATURAL MANURE WHICH SUSTAINS IT.  THE ENTITY NEEDS MY TOXICITY FOR I AM ITS AVATAR
---
&gt; I thought old Freddy was too OP
---
Yes officer Tapp this post right here ‚òùÔ∏è
---
There's a possibility yes, and if you said you were "Butt Dancing" because your fellow survivor(s) got out and you tried to say it wasn't at the killer, depending on their level of chill, they may or may not listen to reason.
---
*Lery's has a million unsafe windows couple with rng lottery with every room.
---
It‚Äôs a pp
---
Im also a Pig Main, these days I run BBQ, Ruin, Surveillance, and Save The Best For Last. STBFL is great on Pig, it cuts down chases substantially. 
---
Alternatively, Monitor and Abuse should work really well on Pig, as it means you can get closer to gens before you crouch and it increases your field of view (which is normally decreased when you crouch).
---
If I ever feel like I need a 4k win I just play Wraith
---
Oof. I sometimes blindly run into saws on accident while looking behind me for the killer... and hatchets.. just the killer in general.
---
On the behalf of all killers; fuck you
---
Thanks for the kind feedback! I haven‚Äôt but it‚Äôs something I can look into certainly :)
---
Same goes both ways. If you've been playing normally the whole game, and hen when you realise I'm about to get the 4K you decide to farm with me, don't sneak gens behind my back and rush the exit and teabag at the end
---
Ohhhh shit!
---
Oh I totally respect your opinion and am glad for it. :)
---
Diddo on dumping MYC. It can be a really good perk for other killers, but Amanda isnt mobile enough to take advantage of it consistently.
---
I just bring in a cheapo kit a whole bunch and enjoy the bonus. It's not like we all have to be streamers and have 200+ of each type in storage. Worst case scenario killers bring in Franklins and congrats, your killer is down 1 perk after dropping your ghetto heal kit.
---
Oof. i know how i bought Leatherface after bbq wasn't in the shrine for 2 years.. guess what was in there a week after i bought it..
---
My girlfriend makes fun of me mercilessly when she sees me do this.
---
I read this in Patrick's voice lol
---
Did the same the other day, killer in the post game chat was like "Fuck you and your insta heal" and disconnected
---
It's a shame your comment is not up higher here. As someone who uses self care, it's important when to know when to let it go and grab that person on the hook. If other guy is still getting chased you've got 2 free heals right there.
---
I think it's because Killer is essentially a resource and time management game where you're racing against a clock. Add to that the fact that your opponent will sometimes mock you for your mistakes and you've got a pretty stressful game. 
---
The most stressful thing about playing Survivor is other Survivors being dumb, usually.
---
Whenever someone calls me a cheater, i smile. They indirectly tell me i'm a good player.
---
Tips for a new Killer, sure :
---
Don't give up on a chase -- hitting someone and leaving them is a bad idea, down them and hook them instead of being distracted by gens or other players.
---
Patrol gens after you have hooked someone -- always be kicking and making gens lose progress when you can.
---
Chase &amp; Patrol -- again, Hunt down someone you just hit, hook them, and hunt again. Be sure to check gens that are furthest from where you were chasing the person you just hooked as Survivors tend to avoid your heartbeat when chasing someone and will sit on a Gen furthest from where you were chasing.
---
That's about it really, everything you will learn naturally. Goodluck!
---
Yeah, shit holy
---
Kind of want to try Shy Guy Ghost Face; camp in the basement, then when someone comes down hide in the corner and peek out at them.
---
i'm very sure even without the entity's help Amanda Young could probably take on the survivors without much issue.
---
Tapp, why you run from Huntress?
---
You husband now!
---
I tried so many times but I still can't do it over 3 seconds. And then theres Monto or No0b3 running Backwards l the whole game.
---
How about just make it work. Getting protection hits doesn't give stacks most of the time.
---
Do I have flaws? Yes.
---
What are they? Oh I don't know... I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I DC when I face the 5th Nurse in a row.
---
So sue me... No don't sue me that's the opposite of the point I'm trying to make.
---
I think you can find that on dbd gone wild
---
"Filthy meg mains"
---
Fight me bitch
---
Slugging is one of the most unfun mechanics for survivors. I really don't feel like making more slugging perks.
---
Carburrator tuning guide with the primer bulb
---
You can swap up the bulb with grease or the lubricant because those addons are underrated on him too
---
Maybe remove legion from that list at the bottom. Since 'legion' is just the name for the four teens with knives etc.
---

---
Why would a DBD player ever become a serial Killer: You already get to experience it for free and with no real victims :P
---
I like these posts you make
---
 ^but ^it ^cant ^stun ^the ^killer..
---
Can't do this regularly? I can probably play for weeks bringing one every single game I have so many of them they're really not that rare.
---
Survivors are already strong enough without instant heals, the whole "instant down vs instant heal" argument always sounded silly to me, you're comparing two different things.
---
I personally think they're bs and never bring them. It's so unnecessary.
---
When the exit gates are open and I know there's no hope to hook anyone, I just start walking around the map. No need to go to the gate just to witness the chorus of tbagging.
---
Yay, that‚Äôs my favorite fun perk combo, absolutely love it.
---
But when you factor the terror radius suppression *and* the built-in windstorm speed boost, the slow-down is essentially negligible. But yeah, a lot of newer players thought Freddy was OP, and a lot of people think that's why he got nerfed into the ground not long after release. New Freddy feels insanely better with map pressure AND chase stopping.
---
Oh my, i love that voice
---
*almost* is the key word
---
Not specifically related because everyone was good sports about it, but I had a game yesterday as Pig like this. 
---
I hooked two people close together when the further one got unhooked. I started following the unhooker briefly, when I turn around to see the person just saved going towards the other hooked person. They paused when I gave them the stink eye and just shook my head. And then immediately saved them.
---
It's not tunneling if you have no survival instinct lol
---
Yeah left behind and fucking 50 other survivor perks, what is this constant circlejerk around Left Behind, why aren't you bitching about deja vu? Who's responsible for this horde of morons who keep asking the same shit?
---
Thank you! hope you enjoy it.
---
Since they're infinite and you actually get points by putting them down, what's the problem? 
---
Might not be time efficient, but it's not wasting anything. Also, there's often multiple routes/paths survivors can take to unhook + run, so they should all be covered. I played hag quite a bit and I needed at least 4 to 6 to cover the all the routes. If you go for just one, it's even more useless since the survivor will just crouch, unhook and then both run in different directions and your one trap did nothing lol.  
---
I agree though, the best traps are the ones you put before unhooking on some likely paths the survivors will take (before some pallets, at windows or just right down in the middle of the map to fuck up with people).
---
That still happens? The devs should be able to help you get your stuff back. If you had any legacy stuff you aren't getting that back as they will never give that to anyone no matter what.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Lots of people tell me that haha
---
Should I grab it from the shrine?
---
How about just make it that u see the gatch if u are last player or, when someone unhooks you and leaves u behind u get instantly healed a full stat
---
My name was ''Free Hugs &amp; Cookies''. And he told me that he wanted a cookie really bad, thats why he was an espacially good boy
---
That's just straight up camping
---
As dumb as it sounds it makes sense because the entity is just a fuck up god
---
You give Killers a bad name, mate.
---
Just women?
---
So... like every gray rank killer who plays Bubba?
---
They do not know the hag ways yet but will learn over time.
---
Reciprocity.
---
Yeah, even when i have bond and i watch other survivors be useless its still fine though since i cant just chill, do gens, and leave them.
---
Yes, this is almost three whole minutes of me just getting disconnected due to the killer leaving the lobby
---
If you enjoy a killer stalking his prey try ghost face.
---
Oh look more killer whataboutism
---
Do you want me to have sex with your parents to shame them?
---
she has a dik
---
you'll be surprised how many people dont want to pay 5$
---
I don't like either one of them.
---
Don't you think even Memes deserve to be modernized? If you stick with on Template for every Situation we would be done by now. Let people enjoy things man.
---
Fuck overly immersed survivors. Grow some fucking balls.
---
Me and you both
---
This dude using three emojis sounds much more fun than.. you two crying over said emojis. Grow the fuck up. "We don't do that here" lmao idiots.
---
Yeah you are using him wrong. Using snares in the middle of the chase can shutdown loops and the force the survivor to abandon the loop or take a hit. Throw on BBQ and chilli and teleport right back into another chase. He is a very good killer now.
---
being bullied...?!
---
So a rank 20?
---
The problem with spamming traps in an area is that your trap placement is best spent pressuring multiple areas honestly one close to the hooked area (unless it‚Äôs the basement, I put one at the bottom and top of the staircase) is enough to force both people to have to crouch walk over to the area, resulting in a slower rescue time. When you have all your traps out and about, you get to put fear in people when running TO the hook instead of the small area around the hook. When people know you have 4+ traps on one hook, that means you‚Äôre gonna struggle in chases because you‚Äôre gonna have less Opportunities to herd people into your traps and spend more time just slowly walking at them.
---
Michael Myers and Freddy are also iconic and yet their teachable perks straight up suck or are way too situational, Myers' used to be kinda good for a time. So I don't think how well known a character is has to translate in great perks even though that would be amazing and would add more versatility to both killer and survivor meta .
---
I'm the guy who gets pulled off waaaaay too often.  I'm weaving to see who the killer is going for and wham, I'm in immediate regret for being a teammate.
---
People who do this shit love to bitch at the killer, I just end up telling at the screen like it's football season always
---
the devs have a back up of everybody stuff that gets deleted not sure why this is even a thing after years but its BHVR so go figure but you'll be able to get everything back except legacy things and to be honest they should be giving that back to if a person eaened it but apparently not for their reasons
---
He's still holding a Knife though.
---
Lmao spot on
---
fuck off
---
‚ÄúBruh‚Äù - every 15 year old on the internet

yoly hhit, seah
---
I know but it‚Äôs just $5 dollars which isn‚Äôt a lot but they can wait on the shrine if they don‚Äôt want to spend $5 which is totally fine
---
Now imagine the same thing on PS4 but you‚Äôre waiting around 5 minutes between finding lobbies. It‚Äôs why I switched to mainly playing Killer. 
---
I‚Äôd rather wait 5 minutes as Killer and go up against a SWF team and give it my best over waiting 20 minutes for a Survivor game just to get farmed off the hook and tunnelled to death.
---
"Ma,am it appears to me that blood is leaking from the pipes."
---
You saved yourself a lot of suffering
---
This post scares me
---
I'm a Spirit main, and not a high rank, but I've watched the greats (Puppers, Monto, Farmer John) and picked up quite a bit. Like others said, don't focus on winning quite yet. Focus on learning your ability (in this case, hatchets obviously), on trying it out in different situations to see what works. In terms of general tips:
---
\- Fuck the survivor rulebook for killers. As long as you don't DC or facecamp (as in literally stand in front of the hook. Hovering a bit is okay), you're good.
---
\- Know when to slug (as in hit a survivor and leave them on the ground). If you kill two and down the third, but you know the third is on death hook (meaning they've been hooked twice and will die as soon as you hook them), you don't have to hook them just to race the fourth survivor to the hatch. I once won a 4K (kill all four survivors) by slugging the third and then pretending to leave, just to catch the Bill come over to heal her. Slugging also might make sense with a SWF group (survive with friends, the bane of killers' existence (lol jk)).
---
\- Speaking of SWF, I unfortunately don't have many tips. However, they're much more likely to flock to save their friends, so watch the hooks and any slugged survivors much more carefully. Basements are your best friend with these guys, as you might end up with a basement full of survivors if you hook one down there. They also heal the shit out of each other, so start learning heal spots (usually near pallets or good loops). Also keep in mind that they usually have communications open, so you can't try to trick them if one of the survivors sees what you're doing (i.e. Insidious near a hook).
---
\- Pallets. It is sometimes majorly in your favor to break a pallet during a chase, especially if the survivor is using it as their main defense. It might seem like a waste of time, but you might end up wasting more time to the survivor's hijinks. TBF, though, since you're playing Huntress, you can often just leave the pallet, lulling them into a false security, and hatchet them right over it.
---
\- It's sometimes really fun to show mercy. I'll often let the last survivor go if s/he was solo-queue with a three-person SWF, just as a little "sorry you had to deal with that." However, as Farmer John put it, make sure to assert dominance by downing them and dropping them by the hatch or whatever, making it very clear that you let them go. It's also best to do this when the survivor gets a new item or something like that, as it makes the survival much more worth it.
---
\- This is a super specific one, but if you use a Hex totem like Ruin, don't go check on it as soon as you spawn in. This will clue survivors in as to where it is. Also, Hex totems often work together, like Haunted Grounds and NOED.
---
\- Speaking of NOED, it's an infamous perk, and often brought along specifically against SWF (you can tell by similar names, "toxic" skins (neon, bright, just obviously not serious skins), and joining the lobby at the same time). People say it's a crutch, and I can see what they mean, but 1) it means you only have three perks until the gates open, and 2) since you're new, a "crutch" is completely okay to use.
---
\- If you can never seem to find survivors, the first tip is obviously patrol gens. They have to do them *eventually*. If you lose them during chases, try Spies from the Shadows. It's rarely used, but that's why it's so good. Survivors never care about setting off crows. Also, *LISTEN.* The audio in this game is HUGE. Hurt survivors are not silent (unless they have certain perks). You will hear groans if you stop and listen. If you lose a healthy survivor with no scratch marks, they're probably hiding behind a tree or rock. It's really not that hard to find them if you look around a lot and lost them recently.
---
\- CHECK LOCKERS. Especially if you lost a survivor and the scratch marks lead to the locker. They might be trying to fake you out, but they might also be depending on the fact that no one checks lockers. However, two caveats. One, you're playing Huntress. She refills at lockers, so survivors tend to avoid them when they know it's Huntress. Two, beware of Head On. If a survivor is really obviously climbing into a locker right in front of you, they might be baiting you into a stun.
---
Also I realize that I explained all of the lingo I used, sorry if you already know it.
---
Fact is that weren't even me LOL XD
---
Yeah like uh.. Legion wait no... Bub... No... Fred... Hag... No... Doc... No... Pig... No... Ghost... No... Spirit and Huntress...?
---
No, Freddy

Rank 15. Cos rank reset hun x

I had an Ace with a flashlight who'd dance for me the whole game. Aimed his flashlight straight up and spun in circles lol. Loved it and let him live. Messaged me saying that Ace likes to party.
---
YOO FLIP FLOP IS FINALLY HERE! my tenacity+unbreakable+flip flop build is finally complete :)
---
Or a large camel toe
---
You mean give the killer a legitimate reason to go after the person that was just unhooked?
---
I think if they make every loop unsafe or have mind games  for survivors then they should remove bloodlust .. but overall great post.
---
comments online make u nervous?
---
Couldnt she just wait till the hatch opens and close it immediately?
---
These posts with Bill are hilarious
---
What a great screenshot!
---
I find them more annoying/unfun than anything else,much like a couple other killers power/abilities in the game.  I think the days of a scary killer are long gone.
---
Streaming dead by daylight for the next 7 hours! Come hang out!

https://www.twitch.tv/bothershawn

My Favorite answer so far because this seems very true
---
But *jake*
---
Oml
---
It takes a little bit to get used to. Just remember that you don‚Äôt slow down and you don‚Äôt lose bloodlust.  The want to leave loops?  Perfect. You‚Äôll get an open hit. Also, don‚Äôt start putting them down till they loop you. If they‚Äôre just running, you‚Äôll down them quick.
---
They aren't amazing compared to some other killer power, but combine it with his ability to teleport and the whole dream world thing and he's pretty good. If he had an ability like the nurse he would be broken.
---
getting a safe unhook is easy if the killer isn't camping
---
I've seen enough of a certain kind of videos that he won't be paid in cash...
---
You do like James Park now. The game decided that for you, you don't have anything to say in that matter anymore.
---
Its a meme.. calm your tits down
---
&gt;Nea, because we're both ugly ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
aww don't say that, u cute
---
1. "Salty" really has lost all meaning hasnt it? It really doesn't work here.
---
2. I play mostly survivor these days and I think instant heal is completely unnecessary. When I do use an instant heal I never use it to revive a downed survivor as I think that's broken. I just use em to bully killers.
---
3. I don't think I've ever heard anyone call tombstone Myers op before. That's a new one.
---
Bill was way to inspired by the holiday firecrackers.
---
Trapper/Jake. Trappers ability gives him a ton of blood points and has the highest base stats, jake is very good for exiting chases in an emergancy and hiding his presance
---
Please tell me you forgot the /s
---
I guess I'll spend the rest of my days sabotaging hooks
---
Meme, but main reason is probably so he can derank.
---
Well no.  Im pretty competent with trapper, used to be rank 1 with him when I actually played the game. I only play every now and again but I'm definitely not a rank 20.
---
I just do it for fun
---
while this is a rank 20 strat I use it only and I'm a p3 bubba and I use agitation, iron grasp, insidious, and NOED. and I only play bubba basement because i suck and if i try any other killer and use skill all i get are swf flashlight teabaggers.... but rn using bubba's basement I am rank 9 so it works up until about 8
---
Nah. I Do it even before hooking someone.  
---
In about half my games they normally leave without even finding me
---
Oh okay, I'm kinda new to the game, thanks for the answer!
---
I prefer them.  Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to kick back and not sweat. That‚Äôs where good ol leather cones into play. Competitive no much but will stomp noobs
---
He requires Play with your Food, and to sink time into getting stacks, otherwise he is too slow and kitable.
---
I had him on my ass, with the red stain up to my neck, and avoided his chainsaw by hugging walls and turning corners. He can't hit shit because if he hits the wall once, it's enough of a time loss to lose a game. 
---
Just take away the slowdowns on his charge and cooldown, then give him some kind of teleport, like to the basement or something. Lol
---
Survivor - Jeff/Neabecause I love his majestic beard and his beautiful looks. He's also Jesus christ
---
Nea because she was my first ever main, she reminds me of Chloe from life is strange (the clothes, not the face)
---
Killer - I don't really have a main, I play with all killers but I play a lot of hag and trapper because I love predicting where survivors will loop and go, and it feels super satisfying when a survivor walks into my traps
---
(Watch all of the ads too)
---
You don't use them because they aren't fair, but you use them to be a bully?  Pick a fucking side, mate.  You come off as someone who likes to bm but won't admit it publicly because you're playing both sides of the fence?
---
Also, if you've legit never heard anyone call Tombstone OP, then perhaps a quick Google search is all you need.
---
Yeah accept it, it's the first step towards your new life as a Jake main.
---
I think nurse is fine(base nurse) and doesn't need changes. I really hope they don't mess with her
---
You get into survivor lobbies so quickly, youre lucky
---
Sole survivor can actually be pretty strong combined with OoO
---
Everyone gangsta until ‚ÄúHalloween OST: The Shape Kills‚Äù starts playing 20 meters away from you
---
Unfortunately because of the change a while back no one who plays a lot can go below rank 15 and because of this not a lot people play at rank 20 you do just have to go threw the low ranks just know that even the best killers still lose and just have some fun because you can't de rank until you hit rank 15
---
Then he would have the white T-shirt with the leather muzzle.
---
I mean, who hasn‚Äôt went on a murderous rampage after finishing a game of DBD?
---
But I like kitty üòî
---
They're efficient and definitely the more powerful option of his two traps.
---
But personally? Dream Pallets are just so, so, SO much more satisfying when they work. Yea, I can catch a person in a loop with a Dream Snare and get the same satisfaction that I would with Clown and his bottles.
---
But having a fake pallet thrown on my head as I pick up a survivor who was laying next to it? That's a special kind of chuckle right there.
---
Thank you! Don't forget to try to relax if the game makes you stress.
---
FINLAND!!
---
Thanks for the help! I typically don't use the saw in chases, but I feel like it's making me miss out on an instadown so the knowledge that it's mostly a movement tool gives me more confidence that I'm understanding it.
---
The thing with some survivors on console is that whenever I start an attack they start moving like they put their controller in a blender. Not quite a 360, but still enough to throw me off to where I can't track them properly, even without the chainsaw.
---
That the problem nobody is talking about, rank 20-11 games are at a way different pace than 5-1.  
---
If you self care against a rank 1 spirit she‚Äôs going to have somebody else downed before you finish.  You could have done half of a gen but at least now you can run for slightly longer.
---
I mean does anyone even play LF not trying to meme?
---
I am at rank 10 doing 4 kills against survivors ranked 3-5.
---
my current build goes like this:
---
BBQ, Deerstalker, Infectious fright, Distressing
---
BBQ: obvious reasons
---
Infectious Fright + Distressing means that whenever someone is downed, I am told the location of all survivors within my terror radius, terror radius is increased by distressing meaning I have a wider range of coverage with infectious.
---
deerstalker is to slug people and chase the other ones that were triggered by infectious.
---
I've gotten 4 kills all slugged out and people dont know what to do with it!
---
bonus BP from distressing since you puke on all things.
---
Puke on all generators no matter what, if survivors are bundled up, puke on all of them before initiating a chase.
---
if you down someone and infectious doesn't trigger, hook the guy and BBQ will lead the way.
---
Learn to long range super puke to down people and love to double down unhooked people with the super puke.
---
So your job as a killer is to use survivors to complete your dailies to make them easier and then kill them, and then tell them you don't believe in reciprocity?  Did I get that right?
---
Empathy over bond all the way.  
---
Let the healthy survivors do the objective
---
Her attitude screams toxic. I think I will avoid her streams. Lol
---
If you got rainbow ranks you got swf.
---
I had something literally the same as this a day ago lol https://streamable.com/3ts28
---
Ace just giving him a fat B O I
---
Exactly. It all plays into the time management issue. Getting all the gens done means healing won‚Äôt matter because you can just leave lol
---
No, because then it's going to be too reliable to get it.
---
It's not hard to get safe unhooks, they tested it with safe unhooks on the ptb and it was still super easy to get it to trigger in almost every match.
---
One thing I see many Billy players doing is getting too greedy with their chainsaw. If you‚Äôre close and you can use it then by all means do so. But in situations where you aren‚Äôt, just use the hammer. Using the chainsaw solely for map pressure will still help you a ton. Just gotta know when to go for the insta-down and when not to.
---
Survivor jumping out and closing hatch are almost equal in terms of time taken, it comes down to who starts the action first in most cases. Which in a lot of cases is usually the killer, because of host.
---
But if she stood in the center of the hatch, there was nothing he could do.
---
You'd think fog whisperers would be under a more watchful eye by BHVR but they dont seem to give a fuck since I've seen other ones do shit like this too.
---
Sorry for the bad experience man.
---
My job is to kill survivors. No one told you to help me with dailies. That was your choice.
---
No way of playing is bad. Except cheating and (if you're a survivor) intentionally fucking your teammates over. (sandbagging etc.)
---
You could like, not be a toxic pos on the internet and treat the reddit page like your personal diary but go off
---
It‚Äôs like a baby duckling. I think your his mom now.
---
It was safer. There's a reason that design didn't make it past PTB. This should never be implemented and people need to stop asking for this.
---
It's just too easy to use BT to farm anyone 3 times is too easy. It is way too small a criteria to activate such a powerful effect.
---
By that logic everyone who watches porn is a sex offender
---
Play both sides meaning: either be a douche and own it, or don't be.  Can't call out other people for using an add-on you don't like, and then admit you like bullying the Killers with that add-on. Lol. Makes you look like a hypocrite.
---
I‚Äôve tried empathy but it feels too situational for me - don‚Äôt always get use out of it, whereas bond I do every game
---
Not true, Bubba be more thicc ingame
---
Seems funny how you made this account only today so you have no other post history. Part of me thinks this is the worst self promo I have ever seen. Tut tut tut
---
Imma give him a follow
---
My name has been Hex: Totem Cruncher for weeks now, and I don't leave until all 5 totems have been done. You have no idea how often it gets me focused. Killers are real attached to those little piles of bone. :^)
---
Leave me and my green key collection alone :(
---
I mean I guess I understand wanting to heal but then why not just bring a medkit.
---
Ok? Is this important?
---
And no repercussions. Why risk getting into a jail.
---
Sorry to whoever downvoted me. But her attitude is quite toxic... because she got gen grabbed and lost her shit she decides to DC which then fucks over everybody else. But streamers are supposed to be better as they are effectively show9ng the world to whoever watches them. Who will then try to imitate their actions.
---
DCing is not okay and should never be done and will be a bannable offense.
---
That's the problem, I'm on controller, I can't remap my buttons for turning.
---
It's toxic for sure, but it states under the rules to not shame other players. Streamers are included, and the post also got removed so I'm assuming I was correct
---
Thanks! Haha
---
I was seconds away from dying from one the other day.
---
Like I said I'm fine with instant healing from injured to healthy, just not from downed. That's not being a hypocrite.
---
And this is also another case where I have to say that- this is not the first time I have heard this either LMAO
---
Thanks for the comment :p
---
Toxic survivor.
---
Some people like to enjoy the game a little bit every once in a while instead of gen rushing as fast as humanly possible
---
if you prefer the old freddy, you must be a masochist
---
Yeah. They killed my boy Ash. Behavior made me feel stupid for purchasing him since his perks are fucking awful. I essentially just paid for Bruce Campbell and a survivor who is louder than the rest. Swindlers...
---
He's awful, me and my friend sniped him and won the game. He got really salty so we just stayed at the gates and tbagged him for a while. This was pre collapse. I normally dont condone this type of behaviour but this guy is a real asshole.
---
Oh, so that's where all high rank survs gone making high rank ques that long.
---
I think I‚Äôd rather shove a spoon through my ears than listen to her. Hybrid Panda however has that sweet sweet audible chocolate that soothes the ears and the heart. His voice is like a silk blanket on a cool autumn night next to a flickering fire
---
They're working fine for me
---
Although i love using fake pallets more
---
In addition I'm pretty sure he viewbots.
---
I come from a land down plunder
---
Where beer does flow and men chunder
---
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
---
You better run, you better take cover, yeah
---
Spirit is annoying af to play against.. especially since you sat on the hook as well. I don‚Äôt blame her for DCing
---
It would be a slight buff to mad grit builds too.
---
I had no intention of camping her. I just turned around in amazement that she was killing herself on the hook.
---
I'd imagine Huntress was able to do that because she picked them off one by one. It would've been a different story if they were face to face, I'm sure.
---
Of course they're Russian. They are literally the absolute dregs of humanity in the DbD community.
---
According to youtuber Monto, He makes us leak out of our butts if we don‚Äôt like his videos.
---
Vs a 6000 hour ebony mori nurse buddy, jesus christ the salt is overflowing with some of you people, but I think I remember your name from in-game, you also are a huge crutchusing douchebag.
---
Freddy's perks suck major ass. 
---
Myers' perks have to be used in niche builds or on troll killers like PWYF on Leatherface or STBFL on Legion.
---
Laurie is worth getting for DS. Object is seen as toxic because it provides SWF with an even more unfair advantage, especially against stealth killers. And Sole Survivor only works with dead teammates, which defeats the purpose of Altruism, one fourth of the ranking criteria.
---
Quentin perks suck major ass, except *maybe* Pharmacy. 
---
Detective Tapp's perks are also worthless except when you use Detective's Hunch with a Rainbow Map.
---
So don't pretend to be crusading to get licensed characters better perks. You *just* want Mettle of Man back.

Nope, it's literally just a really dumb joke about her character model.

Holy shit how did you know? I'm a 15 year old lmfao ~~almost 16~~
---
No, grabbing Survivors out of Lockers will not refill your hatchets.
---
I mean, who doesn't get embarrassed at this lol.
---
I win so many games because survivors waste time doing totems when i don't even have NOED, 1 gen left but they need to make sure the Micheal doesn't have NOED.
---
Very Rare Outfit costing 1080 Auric Cells only.

Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard

You just have to accept going in that 2/4 perks are end game only. But oh so sweet when you run them to perfection.
---
Any good tips for 360ing on console? The closest I've got max sensitivity and cant seem to nail it. Is it even possible to 360 on console?
---
I had a glass table. Had
---
No, it's only a 9.7% increase in your movement speed while crouched, which by default is 90%. So it only brings you up to 99.7% which is still just ever so slightly lower than a Survivor running in a straight line.
---
Nah the hag was actually trying the whole match
---
Don't worry, they took out Old Freddy so they could add the Demogorgon with the same power.

\&gt; jesus christ the salt is overflowing with some of you people

Choose one.

But I'm happy that I made you mad, you seem like a very shitty human being. :)

Make sure to join his steamgroup so I know who to sandbag.

and some ppl dont even want to lmao and still lucid dream every night

you sound like youre 12, literally no one gives a shit

Yeah seeming like a shitty person to an actual shitty person somehow doesn't bother me, weird.

Most perks have a use. Even if for jokes, most perks have a TECHNICAL use.

Left Behind has ... literally no use.

oh well, or the amazon jungle

Remember to crop your memes

dont be so salty and why is it important that hes german?

Hybrid Panda is like the rare diamond among the DbD Twitch streamer crowd. I know there are others as well as the content creators on Youtube but he pretty personifies much what a Twitch Streamer/Fog Whisperer should be. 
---
And you know what makes him that way? It's such a crazy thing, he's not an unnecessary dick to other players. He still gets tilted and frustrated with the game at times, but he doesn't actively seek out an 'acceptable target' for him and his chat to berate each game. No flip-flopping from insulting someone for being a baby killer/survivor one minute to yelling at someone for being a sweaty tryhard the next.
---
He just genuinely enjoys the game and streaming it and it shows.

*patiently waiting for Kate's*

---
well yes, but its so depressive by ouself doing that focus to one guy that uses a lot of good stuff and have a lot of hours, its like, ok guys, lets be toxic and everyone brings keys and instaheals against rankit5000iq because u camped me hahah
---
Yeah talk is cheap buddy, let's see you actually be this calm when it happens to you a bunch of times.
---
&gt; if you're going to keep insulting like r/iamverysmart you're not worth making a conversation with.
---
what isn't worth if spending time discussing with someone who can't or don't want to understand/accept logical facts.
---
I've had a game where I decided to do a random dull totem near the end of the game. The last gen was completed with .5 seconds left of me breaking the totem and the freaking thing turned into Noed. The killer had Noed for half a second and I laughed so hard at my dumb luck.
---
Those are the bastards who need to go to the hell under the hell, straight to the bottom and pray that there cpu fan stops working and melts their processor!
---
no problem bro, tell us when u mak it to rank 15
---
I mean you're trading a perk slot that could be ANY other perk for a perk to open hatch if you're the last one standing and the killer closes the hatch. Im not saying that the survivor with it would be able to open the hatch in any other condition outside of that.
---
Wait until everything is so shit we all run deja vu.
---
what u did?
---
I found it earlier, finally. Thank you so very much for the help though. :D
---
*proud and happy Pig noises*
---
ok thankj you
---
Post video. I'm curious.
---
Which are coming out after half life 3.
---
I main Doc for killer and I suggest ruin, if you have it, like everyone else has. Other than that, Overcharge, Distressing, and Nurse‚Äôs Calling 100%. BBQ and chili is always, always fantastic too.
---
Nurse‚Äôs calling is great on Doc because survivors tend to hide behind things while healing, and aren‚Äôt likely to stop even if you‚Äôre close by. As a result, you can flip into treatment mode and zap them with shock therapy when you see their auras, which will put them up to madness III if you‚Äôve been using your treatment mode correctly. after that, they can‚Äôt heal or do anything else until they get time to snap out of it, which gives you a better chance to get your second hit. plus, you‚Äôll get all the perks of madness III during your chase.

Am I missing something?

Bhvr has a track record for backpeddling but also idk how much it was on other consoles as im a pc gamer but 50 bucks.... For a game thats 25 on steam (cad) it better have something to make it worthwhile
---
[I know what he's getting paid in](https://youtu.be/tviPLpD8VG8)
---
Like if the survivor helps the killer with dailies i don't understand why they wouldn't just be a decent person and give the survivor the like minuscule 8k BP from hatch, it's not even entitlement it's just fair exchange. It's like if you offer to sell something and the person comes to meet you and just takes it and says that giving you money is just being nice. Personally that just makes the person sound like an awful cunt to be like *BUT ITS MY JOB TO KILL, STUPID SURVIVORS HAHAHA*

I got to level 50 again

ohhhh

Thats pretty much how i play but if i find them on death hook i slug them and move on so that they can practice chases and get better

And the game after that one too

ITS RAGE WEDNESDAY AND IM GONNA BE ONE OF THE FIRST FEW TO SAY ‚ÄúFUCK YOU‚Äù TO ALL THE BRAINDEAD, DICKLESS, SPINELESS PIECE OF SHIT RANK 2-8 SURVIVORS WHO PLAY ON PS4!!!
---
FUCK ALL OF YOU INCOMPETENT BASTARDS!! 
---
FOR THE PAST 2-3 WEEKS YOU PEOPLE IN THESE RANKS ACT LIKE YOU NEVER PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE AND ARE HORRIBLE AT HITTING SKILL CHECKS WITH NO RUIN AND ALSO WHY THE FUCK AREN‚ÄôT YOU DOING HOOK SAVES??? YOU HAVE LEFT ME TO DIE ON THE FIRST HOOK SO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND I CANT FIGURE IT OUT AND THE KILLER ISN‚ÄôT EVEN CAMPING AND IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP HITTING THAT CLAUDETTE HIDING IN THE CORNER!!! 
---
 WHO HASN‚ÄôT DONE JACK SHIT ALL MATCH AND THEN WHEN THE MATCH IS OVER IS A RANK 2 WITH 9K POINTS AND WANTS TO CALL ME OUT SAYING I DIDN‚ÄôT DO ANYTHING WHEN I LEFT THE MATCH WITH 25K POINTS!!!

FUCK ALL YOU PRICKS,

RANT OVER!!!

I think you might be disabled

quality shitposting. have my upvote

TydeTyme found dead in a ditch
---
Nah, the ones that will truly suffer from this shit are his team mates. If the killer is decent, and doesn't hold back, thats almost a guaranteed depip/blackpip for the survivors.

DCing and killing yourself on the first hook should be punished.
---
Idk how i was able to read this in Patrick‚Äôs voice before i finished the sentence for the first time.

Add Patrick as a killer

Some of her viewers were spamming for her to DC.
---
I love that you of thought and effort into this, and honestly I don‚Äôt have any huge gripes with any of the changes you suggest, other than having the ebony mori work in the next trial and having to search potentially 250 seconds for totems (unless I‚Äôm misunderstanding your totem rework.)
---
I also don‚Äôt think I saw it (it‚Äôs possible I missed it), but I think you should also include the ability for the last survivor to attempt escape off the hook if it‚Äôs their first time on. Other then that, amazing post my dude.

No because it will mean another shitty perk will show up in your bloodwebs wheb it could have been bbq or w/e

Yeah but in a trial legion is only one teen with a knife
---
I‚Äôve never DC‚Äôd. I‚Äôm just saying I understand why somebody would DC against the Spirit because she‚Äôs easiest/overpowered/overplayed killer in the game. The Spirit was the killer in all three of the games I played as survivor yesterday. With how many hours she has as survivor, I can see how annoying it would be to play against that killer that many times
---
I'm rank 4 playing with rank 15 friends. I do get some hate mail as if I made these particular friends in college just so I could abuse rank 12 killers a decade later.

Ah right i thought we were just saying the killers overall not while in a trial. Yeah fair enough i guess but still, A knife is a knife. But i can see what you mean now.

WHAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF IS HOW GREAT THE RANKING SYSTEM. I'M A NEW KILLER, SO I GET TO HAVE RANK 20'S, RIGHT? WRONG! MY THIRD OR SO ROUND OF BEING A KILLER I GET A RANK 11 SURVIVORS.

ONE DC'ED, GOT ONE KILLED BUT THE OTHER TWO T BAGGED ME AT THE DAMN GATE

Amazing write up. You put a LOT of work into this. It is fair and balanced for everyone with ideas that would make both sides happy and I hope more people can read this. 
---
I especially like your totem rework idea, its a good secondary objective that people have been asking for although I didnt notice a proposed rework to Ruin. Its almost too good. If ruin can  consistently stay up longer more killers can be viable at destroy-ruin-in-the-first-30-seconds ranks. As is, I only expect/hope it will be up for at least the first hook. If my ruin stays up all game, its usually a 3k at least
---
#YOU MADE ME DROP MY OVERPOWERED FLASHLIGHT!
---
This is some great advice! Thanks!
---
Laurie Jane
---
&gt; you could  run iron will and try to hid
---
no you fix gen while being injured that's it. Hiding isn't a good option. Just fix a gen in a safe location to not give a free hit to the killer.
---
Adding *one* stack doesn't mean shit, so don't pretend that it does. I can use Borrowed Time as much as I want, or even better, the killer never shows up and I get safe unhooks uncontested. It's too easy to get safe unhooks unless it's versus a camping Leatherface who'll just instadown you.
---
If you want to raise the number even higher, then that's more reasonable, because right now, 4 isn't enough. Your teammates have 9 total hook states between them, 6 of which they can be rescued from. Add to that, you want to keep protection hits as part of the stacks, no fucking way.
---
This is so old that it hurts
---
Anyone else read that in Patrick‚Äôs voice?
---
What?
---
r/dontdeadopeninside
---
The UI changes are not too bad, and I wouldn't mind having ambush attacks count as basic attack hits for the purpose of on-hit perks, like Save the best for last or Hex: The third seal, but the fov for being crouched and the jigsaw box 'modified rng' doesn't seem very reasonable to me. The very nature of the boxes is that it's a game of chance. 1 in 5 if I'm correct, or more or less depending on the amount of available boxes. This would make Amanda's letter very powerful, as even with 2 boxes, you will always have to search two.  I think that goes completely against the whole spirit of the character to begin with. If you wanted to buff the boxes like this, you'd also have to make it so that you're never forced to search all five boxes.
---
So if you want a survivor to always have to search at least 2 boxes, you would have to make it so that they would never have to search ALL boxes to get their trap removed, essentially making the traps more pointless than they already are. They're supposed to be a way to slow the game down randomly, just like how Hex: Ruin can last either one minute, or the entire game, depending on what happens.
---
Ah OK it has to be already activated
---
Survivors main LuL
---
Not really unless you are memeing
---
It's not that strong as a perk but sometimes survivors are very altruistic and you can get momentum there
---
type "left behind" in the search option and you'll find them
---
Idk, 90% of the leatherface players I've played against just camped with insidious.
---
You don't get it. It is annoying because we want strategys and new ways to play. Any perk that provides something new just gets nerfed. Survivors don't have abilities so its only the perks to look forward to.
---
There are different strategies, stealth, chase geared, survival, distraction, etc. Of course there are. Chasing and looping isn't a strategy its a key part of the game like objectives and there are perks specifically for 'runners'. 
---
We want to have options other than looping. Which is inevitable. Unless people choose to be a runner, then the survivor is always going to run....
---
&gt;The only time strategy comes into play is..
---
Let me stop you right there. That statement is naive af

I mean considering how religious they are that actually would work....

That's something that frustrates me to no end about him honestly. You shouldn't have to run reduced charge add-ons just to get him to a decent place, the fact that he's slowed while charging is bothersome especially when compared to Billy not having the same flaw.
---
As the guy above you.  Replies are weird
---
I wish I got survivor rituals... the only ones I get are "hIt sUrvIoRs wIth HaTchEs" or doctor and billy rituals :(
---
The number one problem for me is how inconsistent the charge can be. I‚Äôve lost too many kills from releasing M2 with a full bar and it cancelling
---
It's not as bad as it sounds. Once you're more comfortable playing killer, and have at least a few others that are good at getting bloodpoints, like Cannibal, Legion, Doctor, and have a farming build going you can easily get up to a million bloodpoints in a few hours work. At around 50k+ Bloodpoints per game that'll get you maxed out in around twenty.

That's definitely an issue with him, and while we're at it I will forever hate LF's tantrum. Billy resets after a second or two to keep going, Bubba becomes useless for a good few seconds doing absolutely nothing.

This. Everytime i start thinking maybe i should take it off, i regret it a lot lol

Step 1: All 4 survivors equip brown toolboxes

Step 2: Killer picks franklins
---
Step 3: ???
---
Step 4: All 4 escape because franklins is trash and bby killer got baited in wasting a perk slot.
---
As Freddy, I immediately chased and hit a P3 Claud, they ran away, I teleported in front of them and they ran straight into me looking backwards. I didn‚Äôt even go for the pickup because I knew she‚Äôd DC.

That's probably not high ranks tho

MY BUDDY WHO JUST GOT THE GAME PLAYED GHOSTFACE FIRST AND NOW HE THINKS EVERY SURVIVOR IS "_____FACE". ITS JUST CLOWN NOT CLOWNFACE DAMMIT

Maybe if you are hooked during endgame and everyone else has left, you jump off the hook even in struggle?
---
Lmao no the killer closed hatch as I was working on the 5th gen and I opened gate and left. It gave me the trophy

*YOU DONT LIKE JAKE PARK, YOU DONT LIKE CULTURE*
---
He is a bit paranoid. Some people do follow him around but lots of times it's a random lol.

Yes he can, that doesn't mean he isn't allowed to be criticised for his choices though

with the killer using an add-on like tuft, i can't see how anyone can reasonably get mad at someone for using an insta

I can't wait for the day when solo Survivors and Killers get properly compensated for DCs (600~ Brutality points is not sufficient compensation).

Your xenophobic remarks completely ruin any and all base you had for what was already a really weak platform. Grow up or go back to fortnite and take your shitty toxicity with you.
---
It was a joke
---
I am a rank 1 survivor and rank 4 killer and i hate being in these ranks but i never thought about deranking
---
As someone who has reached rank 1 without ever touching Ruin, I think it's safe to say that it's part luck, and part decisionmaking. People who run Ruin often forget to still protect their generators, thinking that Ruin will buy you enough time to close down the game before enough generators get done. More often than not, this is not the case. 
---
It's possible to protect your gens for a long time, if you plan out what you're going to do ahead of time. Generator placement is key, and you can always decide which ones they're not allowed to touch by ignoring generators on the other side of the map, while patrolling ones that are near eachother.
---
Ever since I started hunting for adept killer achievements, I've been able to either close down the game at high ranks (Purple and higher), without even thinking about getting Hex: Ruin. Especially as a spirit, you would do well without Ruin, and with perks that give you more help ending chases earlier, or slowing down the game by other means. High mobility killers can put pressure on the map by patrolling generators in the right order. 
---
Try playing a thought-experiment like this: In your head, place a timer on each generator from the start of the game. After the timer expires, you know it will be finished, and the survivors will move on to the next. Every time you check a generator and kick it/walk past it, it resets and you will have to check back in eventually. If you want to practice patrolling gens more effectively, you could use a perk like Discordance, which will help you identify threats quickly, and sometimes find survivors at the start quickly, provided they're acting like a team.
---
There are better ways to slow the game down as a high mobility killer than simply relying on Hex: Ruin. Another awesome tool you could make use of to practice patrolling generators, would be Surveillance, one of the Pig's teachables. It allows you to track which generators are being touched after you having tapped them, which helps you apply pressure where needed.
---
Those are just a few options, up to you what you do with it, but I don't think Hex: Ruin is the only answer for your problem. ;) 
---
It's all about being steps ahead of your victims, and if everyone's going to expect Ruin and NOED, then try to think outside of the box, and you'll find yourself a niche that you will dominate, I can promise you that.
---
What I thought was that people would use an ista heal so they would get the bonus again
---
Yeah same. Seems like a defamation move. People jealous of his following so they're taking a jab at him. I suppose targeting the stream-snipers is tunneling, but I don't personally care whether he does it or not. You're right, typically he doesn't, though in certain cases people have it coming.
---
damn its like that?
---
Jake - First main when I started the game and I‚Äôm just too loyal to him at this point. I dig his fog travelers outfit and he just looks like a typical pretentious musician with his flamboyant outfit and I like the aesthetic.
---
Legion - My edgy 12 year old appeal loves the fact that a band of merciless killers are in the game. I love feral frenzy despite it being weak and how quick you are.
---
She's the worst, don't DC when you're being camped, stay on hook and let others do gens
---
Tru talent has always been mediocre at the game, and honestly not a very good killer. It‚Äôs probably hard to accept that he has so many hours in the game and even with so many buffs to killers and nerfs to survivor he still absolutely sucks. 
---
Watching his streams are hilarious because he only usually secures a kill or two via camping or tunneling.
---
It is important to note!! The aura from BBQ is blocked, but Killer Instinct visual cues that the killer gets (the thing that helps Legion find people in Feral Frenzy and the ping Ghost Face gets when revealed) are *not* blocked by lockers, so if Legion stabbed someone in Frenzy nearby, you should bail on that locker because they can see you.
---
Then I proceed to mori the Dwight to introduce him the toxic environment of DBD
---
Make it 30 seconds and i am all in
---
This was very helpful thank you
---
The stream snipers if that's what it is needs to be taken into context because these dudes are literally using software to join his lobbies, look at his build in lobby to set a counter and they stalk him with the flashlight spam sound.  I've always said if you BM you lose your right to a fair game and that's BM on a whole different scale the way they're stalking his lobbies.
---
Oh great, here you are. Could you link me the video you made?
---
I feel insulted
---
OR A TUNNELER BECAUSE YOU KEEP TELEPORT SMACKING WHOEVER TRIPS TRAPS AND IT'S THE SAME GUY YOU HOOKED RECENTLY.
---
Yeah pretty much this, camping (not facecamping) on some maps can be actually useful and legit tactic. When I saw suggestion about camping a bannable thing I couldn't believe my eyes.
---
Same with tunneling.

You're just unique like that!

There's a lot of bugs like that. Me and this guy are friends now but he lost it on me in end game chat because he was hooked and it looked like I was doing that toxic thing where you start and cancel the unhooking prompt. It was really a latency issue on my end and it wouldn't let me finish it. Shit happens, I always give people the benefit of the doubt.

---
Ahh thank you so much!!
---
That would definitely be fun messing around with the skin texture
---
Usually I'll prefer to give the hatch to a last survivor who ran me around a lot. Though I'm not psychic and I'll never know what goes on in the survivor's experience 100% of the time if I am killer.
---
Ahh thank you!
---
"If you dislike killer que times, try survivor!". Proceeds to search for a lobby for 5 minutes as a surv.
---
He definitely tunnels, but most of the time it's fairplay and necessary to get back control of the game. 
---
My only problem with him is he bashes tunneling while resorting to it himself whenever the survivors have a slight advantage over him. Then when someone in the chat asks why he's tunneling he always says the same shit "I don't follow the survivor rule book, guys" which would be fine but he himself says you shouldn't really tunnel and bashes killers who do sometimes, so why does he act like only survivor mains think tunneling is a asshole move.
---
Thank you!! Exactly what I was going for. (Although the angry side of her would make for an awesome painting as well)

I think it can show up as early as 1. I bought BBQ brim the shrine and it showed up on the first or second bloodweb of Myers after I bought him.

It can show up as early as level one.
---
It's random. It can show up on the first bloodweb, or if you're me it can show up on the 732nd bloodweb :,) .
---
The tenacity buff is looking good.
---
It's easy to rank up as killer ruin or not. Pipping is easy. I bet you get gen rushed like no tommorow though and on average 2 or more people escape. Unless you're using nurse/spirit.
---
It can show up at any level, its just subject to RNG.
---
Wow. Nice proving that you don't even bother to hear other people out. 
---
You don't have strategy. Period. Just because you might be the greatest ever at running in circles doesn't give you the right to develop a god complex and assume everything you do is part of some master plan. The smartest thing you do is run at a window and then move slightly to the left. Congrats, you "baited" someone. Stealth is a tactic sure, but there isn't any *thinking* involved in stealth. I know because I play a fuckton of survivor. It's really fucking easy to put a rock between me and the killer and hold CTRL. I know, I know, mind blowing. Planning ahead in loops is smart, and it definitely goes into being a good survivor, but outside of "Do I use this Exhaustion perk here or not?", there is no other perk that incorporates strategy.
---
Haunted Grounds is just bizarro NoED. Change my mind.

---
You're welcome. I'm currently working on getting adept on the Legion, and I've noticed a trend like that myself in my games, where without the tools that most 'Meta-builds' have, I have managed to kept the games to the point where I end up getting a 4k, or only having one person escape, even though I was only using the base perks of the killer. 
---
The only problems I've had with the achievements, is that I kept on getting 14 emblem points out of the 15 required, so I've gotten robbed of the achievement on quite a few occasions.
---
The spirit relies on mindgames, and mobility to protect her objectives, a little similar to how the Nurse works, but a little less extreme, since she can't phase through solid objects.
---
So, my theory would be that a strong build for the spirit would involve perks like Discordance, to find survivors early on, and add-ons that increase the recovery speed of your ability, at which point you won't just use it inside of chases in order to get your hit, but also to travel between generators (Meaning phase speed addons are also strong choices!), meaning that you will rely on your ability to move around the map quicker. 
---
Another thing I could think of, which is more of my personal experience, would be to not be scared to break off chases in order to kick a generator, or do something else. Any time you see someone working on a generator, and they run away when they see you, don't be scared to first kick the generator before going into your chase. The scratchmarks usually stay long enough to track them down, and most of the time a survivor will stick to a certain area once they feel they're safe. This is the moment you turn the tables on them, and make them wait for you to chase them, while you put pressure on the generators by kicking them.
---
Food for thought, and you're welcome.
---
After 3 gens it's too late. You should drop chases earlier. There is no point in dropping the chase after 3 gens. Basically, skills shows when you can recognize that chase going be too long and drop it early.
---
When it turns out the killer has NOED.
---
You're right. That being said, there isn't a problem with either if that's what you're implying.

Who‚Äôs Jotaro?

Personally I think bottles need to be changed. I hate the fact every chase makes you use all you bottles from rank 1-9 and then you have 2 options chases again with no bottles or chase them with no ability.

No one lmao

Uhm he was clearly joking

I used to play dbd on console. I'd rather lick mud.

---
If you have an easy hit: take it. Better make a quick analyze, which person gonna be easier to take (based on where they ran) and chase another person. Works better if you have perks that make it harder to heal. With more games It'll be easier to understand whom to chase.
---
Well I apologize but if it‚Äôs 3v1 for most of the game, I‚Äôm always giving hatch to who I think played the best.

Not quite, since I play defensively, and nearly always have generators close together, allowing me to make the games last a lot longer, usually giving me at least 2 kills, and and the other people dead on hook.

ALSO EVERY SPIRIT I'VE COME ACROSS RECENTLY HAS BEEN A MORI TUNNELER. WHY!?
---
Hey guys,  
---
so i want self care teachable perk... But i can't get it. Problem is that both "perk slots" in bloodweb are filled with teachable empathy and botany knowledge... As somebody who doesn't play very often i don't want to spend any more bloodpoints... Any tip how to get it except getting empathy or botany knowledge too?  
---
Because those perks are there from like 35lvl, now A am 43 and there are still only those two perks.
---
Man same! I was so excited when I first saw it and now we have to wait about a month for it.
---
Removed - Shaming
---
Good to know! Thanks! Hopefully you get it soon lol. Seems like that perk is really OP, too bad it's locked behind a paywall and a huge amount of luck.
---
WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR, MY TEAMMATES WON‚ÄôT WORK THROUGH RUIN AND LAST FIVE SECONDS DURING A CHASE. WHEN I PLAY KILLER, THREE GENS ARE DONE WITH RUIN STILL UP BY THE TIME I DOWN ONE GUY.
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
She doesnt.
---
I asked him on stream and he told me he was serious about "getting more points"
---
So the only unredeemable piece of shit so far is the Doc.
---
thats sounds like a you problem
---
yooo i missed these! it's been ages since your last one
---
""Please nerf I dont want to get better at the game I just want easy wins also nerf all killer perks they are too op also old ds and mom were perfectly balanced giving you free second chances after doing nothing""
---
The wait will be worth it. Gives me time to get to prestige 3 and get her bloody head.
---
Omggg I went through your videos for more of that sweet voice and you were the Ana that rode genji down the wall ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I remember that shit
---
This sub smh
---
WHY THE FUCK IS IT THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I EVER TRY TO QUIETLY STEP AWAY FROM A GENERATOR THE GAME CHOOSES THAT EXACT SECOND FOR A SKILL CHECK?!
---
CAN I PLEASE JUST STEP AWAY ONE GODDAMN TIME WITHOUT AN EXPLOSION?  
---
ALSO, TO THE MEG I JUST PLAYED WITH:  
---
YOU WERE ON YOUR LAST HOOK AND I HAD JUST BEEN HOOKED A 2ND TIME.  YOU FUCKING PULLED ME OFF LITERALLY THE SECOND AFTER WRAITH PUT ME ON.  HE MUST'VE GOTTEN A BIG FUCKING GHOST BONER AS HE STOOD THERE WATCHING YOU KILL US FUCKING BOTH.  
---
YEAH, YOU LITERALLY JUST GOT US BOTH KILLED.  AT LEAST I CAN TAKE SOME SATISFACTION IN HAVING WATCHED YOU GO ON YOUR LAST HOOK AND DIE A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE SAME HAPPENED TO ME.
---
for like over a year
---
HMU if anyone has a link
---
Same shit in CSGO at least
---
Right. I imagined if they did Will or El that it would be ‚Äúinspired by‚Äù characters or older versions of them. Steve would be fine. Hopper would be the obvious great choice.
---
Bro dont be shit talking my shitty main
---
He is trying to touch himself.
---
Buy them they wont go away
---
Get one of the two (empathy or botany) and the following bloodweb will contain self-care teachable.
---
But nope once a trial
---
Self Care shows up at Level 40. You must have missed it or by ignoring the other teachables they‚Äôre showing up again. You‚Äôll have to purchase one of those for Self Care to show up or else these two will be in every Bloodweb.
---
I FEEL THIS ON A VERY PERSONAL LEVEL.
---
No disrespect meant
---
well then they need to fix protection so it works 100% of the time and not just randomly
---
ü§î
---
I would love it cause mettle of men went from usefull to trash
---
He is one of the only killers in my opinion(also leather face but he is shit) that isn‚Äôt guaranteed a 4K with his best add-ons and personally I think that is a big reason why he is bad and he needs a buff or his add-one.
---
You forgot to mention the part where you were stream sniping her.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have been cool even if you were using prayer beads.
---
Isn't this what they tested during the PTB or am I missing something? 
---
Safe unhooks + protection hits as two ways to get stacks.
---
That‚Äôs a pleasant surprise. Anyways I get where you‚Äôre coming from but I don‚Äôt see how any of the survivors/Killers are similar to Jotaro/Dio.
---
Killers shouldn't solely rely on add ons to be good or even viable.
---
IM SO MAD I HAD TWO DAILIES FOR MICHEAL, MORI AND STALK TIER UP. I GOT BOTH AND THE GAME GLITCHED AND DIDNT GIVE ME MY BLOODPOINTS! IT DIDNT EVEN RECORD ONE STALK AND THE MORI ONE OUTRIGHT DISSAPEARED. IM MAD I USED THE ONLY MORI I HAD.
---
I only give hatche to the survivor that did not t-bag me
---
LMAO, That was my first post to ever like, BLOW up- seriously that moment was so funny, I remember I even got to the frontpage of the OW reddit! So cool to get recognized on here! &lt;3 Yeah my voice changes depending on the situation, I get very loud if something is extremely funny to me LMAO
---
She‚Äôs just, so far back there, awkwardly alone
---
The art is phenomenal
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying and I agree, just saying what you‚Äôre asking for are already available as add ons. He definitely needs a buff. Maybe even a rework. He‚Äôs not threatening at all.
---
Lol you dont need ace in the whole
---
THIS JUST HAPPENED TO ME FOUR GAMES IN A ROW! NO ITS OK TEAM, I'LL JUST DO ALL THE GENS, UNHOOKS AND GET CHASED HALF THE TIME IM DOING IT, NO FUCKING PROBLEM GODDAMIT!
---
Hope "only" lasts 120 seconds.
---
It is hard to tell what you are talking about since each person has a different definition of whats toxic.
---
No
---
What a dumb bitch
---
as I've said before, everyone is toxic. no one is safe, this is the game we play
---
thanks for letting us know.
---
No, he was fun and pretty good. My first P350 and brought me to red ranks even when I tried to play worse to avoid them
---
Good luck with that! If I meet a hag tonight (I'm survivor rank 10 so it's not that unlikely), I'll make sure to write "cucumber" as secret code word to know if it's you.  Won't be until.... in about 4 hours though.
---
Ah holy shit I even just went on your profile to figure out your a fellow psychology major!!!!! Are you me????
---
Holy crap! I didn't know the bloodweb could go that high. Does it just go all the web way to one million or something?
---
True. It‚Äôs always hilarious when you down a survivor who teabags tho, even if they fall into the gate
---
That just means he likes you
---
ROADA ROLLA DA!!!
---
Good to know, thanks! Wasn't sure if that was the case or if you had to reach a certain level first.
---
Awesome, thanks! That must have been nice to get it so early lol.
---
Not how I‚Äôm saying they should be you can get a shit ton of bottles that do fuck all or you can have 5 that get you a hook but then you have to reload which dumps any survivor you saw on the way to the hook or if they tried to body block you.
---
on behalf of all competent killers, fuck off
---
QUICK GAMES MAKE ME DEPIP, I JUST BRING A MAP WITH A RED TWINE ADD ON AND CALL IT A DAY
---
Makes sense since it's a mobile game with completely different leveling, UI, and game interactions. Cross-progress would just add too much confusion to the servers that are all already about to have a collective technological aneurysm.
---
I bought the DLC for the main game, but I'm glad I'm able to practice The Trapper and The Hillbilly (who I rarely touch), and the actual experience itself can translate into console and vice-versa, always playing different styles allows different ways of strategizing. I really don't think it's that big of a deal, and I dont know why people are freaking the fuck out about it. Just simply NOT download it, nobody's forcing you to play, and not having cross-progress isn't taking anything away.
---
Yes. This
---
One of the use of hatch is to start end game. And you didnt get my point. Let me be clear, noed mostly take down the toxic survivor who just waste time by tbagging near exit gate. If killer is bad then survivors can easly loop him and noed does not matter. Its there arrogance that let them down. Now one of them is down and other wants to save him but because of noed they are afraid. Survivors who were winning suddenly got a big suprise and they dont like it. They just complain that noed is trash.  There will always be something which will be unfair or give advantage to bad players but that advantage is not that op in this case. If killer is bad as that guy said then he will still have hard time hitting you. There is a chance that all totem are cleaned and noed gets never use. A complete waste of perk slot. It is good but with its own flaws.
---
I haven't seen it. Can you link me to the cosmetic?
---
Mate iron will is level 30 jake park perk
---
u/nwordcountbot
---
Oh someone did sorry I assumed it was you but now that I think of it there‚Äôs been a fuck ton of immediate downvotes on this sub lately. The averages make it slightly confusing and sometimes look unbalanced or skewed but honestly it‚Äôs the closest to accurate they can get with 5 varying ranks in each game being a possibility. The truth is at rank 20 you‚Äôll doubtfully play against all rank 20s And at rank 1 it‚Äôs usually a mixture of ranks as well. Chances are they were in a que together.
---
Real quick #ThrowbackNotQuiteThursday: Anyone remember that one video the White House released about violence in video games that included some clips of Huntress gameplay?
---
I have looked through futuragold's posting history and found 24 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.
---
It's a *trap*
---
Interesting
---
Isn't that... what it is?  What did you change exactly?
---
If it‚Äôs a cute girl
---
nightshard507 has not said the N-word yet.
---
Mostly the lifetime jail that follows doesn't seem too worth it for maybe 2 hours of "fun" (big brackets here).
---
My only gripe is getting rid of the Cypress Mori. If I kill everyone or if everyone escaped and you didn't yet, then I should be able to Mori them if I have it.
---
FINALLY! Numerous times this week have I had times where it would of saved me-aaaand it's a 2700 perk! Joy...
---
If it's a SWF, that would make sense but still... I didn't know the average was rank 16. I thought it was closer to rank 12 or something like that, but thanks for the info!
---
I'm unsure whether or not I should even call myself a freddy main anymore.
---
it may not be a lot but its still something, saying it does nothing is just wrong and even then, if the killer is seeing the same guy farming others with BT over and over and doesn't go after them rather than the person who was just unhooked then they deserve to get MoM'd. Saying that a person has to make half of the hook saves for their team (given someone doesn't get to the second state) just to get one MoM off means that even if everyone is running MoM only 2 can get it off and that's only IF they get those 4 safe unhooks. 
---
Raising it any higher like 5 or even all 6 just makes the perk just as unusable. You're overestimating how many people would farm off-hook and downplaying that 4 safe unhooks is more than half of the team's unhooks (not including said MoM player).
---
people mostly agreed that the thing that made MoM broken was how many people could easily stack it up and it being impossible to combat when 3-4 people ran it.
---
If the parameters switched to safe unhooks/protection hits it would take a lot more effort to get, and there literally aren't enough safe unhooks to go around for everyone's MoM to activate this way, assuming the killer 2 hooks everyone, you only have 6 chances to safe unhook split among 2 other survivors assuming nobody is dead yet, and that's in the most drawn out game imaginable, and not to take into account possible unsafe unhooks and the more than likelihood that everyone isn't going to get hooked 2-3 times each.
---
Safe unhooks were a good alternative to MoM stacks, just because it was ran en masse in the PTB for a week before they changed it doesn't make it a bad change. As of now it is a trash perk that it pointless to run as you will most likely never be able to use it in a standard match.
---
Noed benefits you until someone has to find the totem and cleanse, if the survivors weren't proactive to begin with. Effects all survivors. 
---
Adrenalin effects whoever has it for a brief moment, and only once.
---
I didn't change anything. The description is basically completely different but this is actually how Ruin works in-game.
---
The us is trying to crack down on violent games. And dbd is a game literally about being a killer.
---
Lmao just do totems casual
---
wut?
---
https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/average I use this sometimes for averages on larger numbers and it shows that 3 rank 20s and a rank 5 and a rank 16 average is 16.2. And the visual glitch you‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt a glitch it‚Äôs basically saying you *performed* above your rank while being close to the rank it displays.
---
No point in adding escape attempts for the last survivor. Killer will just camp the hook and wait for you to succeed/fail.
---
Tombstone Piece is a pretty scummy add on to be fair. It doesn't take nearly as much time to charge up and still gives you the ability to mori someone pretty early into the match. Myers' strongest add on overall.
---
More than enough time even for a hook save
---
no
---
[DOTA 2 be like...](https://youtu.be/CbcBHuS0wEA)
---
&gt;Jokes aside as someone who's part Russian and has many online Russian friends the vocal minority doesn't depict all Russians. The people who play on english servers despite not speaking any english are just lazy and want to get into matches fast. They're depicted as being toxic cause they often don't care about the game and just want to play a match. The truth of the matter is that (at least for games with an eSports scene like CS:GO and DOTA 2) Russians are actually really good at video games and most of the Russians that don't play on Russian servers are just trash that are sick of being stomped by players far better than them.
---
Survivors earn Adrenaline by making it to the end, killers are given NOED by failing their objective.
---
He put that in the bottom of the page, the nurse thing at least, about spirit, week idk
---
depends on location, if you're in a low population area or unpopular area try a DNS or VPN to change to a better area.
---
IDK why you're being downvoted you're honestly not wrong. I've used the perk in perk roulette and it does actually help you make smart choices on what gen to do next.
---
With that being said it's incredibly weak and literally every other perk is better except perhaps the likes of No Mither.
---
Oooh interesting. Does the game keep track of how many times you've completed a level 50 bloodweb? It sounds like the "prestige" system that a lot of games use nowadays (infinitely leveling up/resetting).
---
What makes you think they were stream sniping?
---
Nah I mean they literally fit the criteria of an extremely toxic killer. I was playing against a ghostface who downed me tea bags and hit me on the first hook until I died. We literally just started the match and there was no reason for it other than to be toxic. Then I was playing a broken Michael Myers who clearly couldn't see me but was gaining his tier anyway, he down me and one other person and literally stood in Evil Within in front of the other hooked Survivor till he died. He did that to each hook he got and I ended up getting the hatch. But it's literally sad to see the game played this way.
---
Adrenaline is balanced because NOED exists but NOED is OP and should be removed.
---
Im a fellow freddy main and I did enjoy the old Freddy but the rework is so fun (genporting ahead of someone youre chasing, priceless lol). I finally leveled up a few killers for their teachables and I'm leveling Freddy up now. I based my build on his genporting: bbq, discordance, tremors and rancor. I'm hoping to be able to some work with that build.
---
I give the hatch to someone who I thought played well.
---
*careless whispers*
---
cursed images
---
You're right I thought it was only the survivors.
---
This right here is the smartest post on this reddit page, congrats
---
It Is not.
---
You waste more points ignoring them than you do just getting one. Don't ignore a perk in the web.
---
There‚Äôs only rumors because people keep mentioning it. Lol
---
But it could be nice to lose him in a chase than throw it in other direction and run away that would better
---
Just give it 5 meters
---
I mean, you already spent more blood points going to level 43 trying to avoid them. Everyone is correct. You have to buy them. They will not disappear or be worked around.
---
I was slugged once with no mither. The killer thought I had DS. He didn't know I had tenacity and unbreakable on.
---
Ok.
---
Just started Dbd myself, mostly playing killer im stuck waiting for this shop to give me good perks or i have to play and level all of them right? seems a little grindy and maybe im missing something :D
---
THIS FUCKING TRAPPER FACE CAMPED ME WITH 5 GENS LEFT AND I DIED ON FIRST HOOK AND HE FUCKING HAS COMMENTS ON HIS STEAM PROFILE OFF SO I CANT SHITTALK HIM
---
Let me know if you are able to be sneaky with all that reflective shine.
---
Nothing will happen but in the very slight chance it does I‚Äôm glad to be Canadian
---
This is still not accurate and omits the same important fact that the original description does, namely that there's an additional like 3 seconds of no progress being made on the generator.
---
When within the Spirit's Terror Radius/Heartbeat, the sounds of her phasing is nullified even without Prayer Beads add-on.
---
I don't. Want out before the killer dc's on us lmao
---
Going a little off topic but is that also the reason why matchmaking takes so long? Is it just because the game has to find the right survivors to make up for the average of whatever your rank is?
---
It's a very developed idea, and it would be the first kid/teen survivor. I like it!
---
So if there is no one in my region it doesn‚Äôt find anyone? Why not use server regions like a normal game...
---
0 gens done. 
---
3 teammates killed. 
---
Thank god you were in those chests instead of gens Tapp. RIP your team tho.
---
Aight. Got to remember that the next time I'm against her. Thanks
---
Thank you!
---
Was ghostface‚Äôs power not ridiculous when it first came out or was it really just because people didn‚Äôt know how to play against him?
---
now do it in a part 1, 2 or 3 artstyle of your choice. I love this
---
I‚Äôll be excited when I see skate punk Nea and Metal Kate
---
Oh ok that one actually makes sense
---
I‚Äôm assuming it only works if you get hit while someone else is in a ‚Äúchase‚Äù I could be wrong but I‚Äôve been hit with a survivor a decent ways away but because they were technically still in a chase for those few seconds I got a protection hit even though the killer completely went after me.
---
I love seeing the aura of my teammates slink away into a locker halfway across the map.
---
It‚Äôs like you read my mind and put what I want there
---
I loved to do that when I played Wraith
---
(50/50 player here)
---
Everything seems fine but...
---
I dont think DS needs a next nerf. It is now a mid tier perk and I dont see that many ppl using it. Everyone says that it is "anty tunnel perk" and thats why it should be nerfed again but its not. DS is just a perk not anty tunnel perk. I cant understand why no other perk has it "purpose" but DS have it. 
---
Totem idea is not good as well because of NOED. Even now you cant spend few minutes for searching and destroying them if you go against good nurse or spirit. Most of the time someone is hooked and someone is in chase. If one person goes for the save and other is destroying totems no one is doing gens. After you destroy all totems probably one of your teammates will be on second hook or will be dead already. Totems taking more time to find would be a very huge buff to NOED and killers in general.
---
And a classic: sorry for bad english
---
That was the first time I‚Äôd done that with any killer and it startled me how fast I grabbed him haha
---
I think people ignore the other positive aspects of Make Your Choice. 
---
You have one injured survivor and one who‚Äôs too scared to do gens or heal the person they unhooked. That‚Äôs 2 survivors effectively either one shot to down and scrambling to hide or heal instead of doing gens. Even if you don‚Äôt down them with MYC it‚Äôs still a neat perk to scare people when making saves and rewarding you for leaving the hook.
---
The objective is to survive...
---
Wet paint sounds like total bull. Image a full swf who ran it and would just jump into a locker right before getting downed. Would give them a no risk, 30% chance to prolong the chase for doing nothing. It‚Äôs like a old d-strike but instead of having to at least hit a skill check your just rolling dice. I think you should add Tokens to the perk to make it more fair like every 15 seconds in a chase gain a token. Each token equates to 8% chance of escaping the locker when the killer checks it up to a max of 4 tokens. If you don‚Äôt escape, lose 1 token when caught. If you do escape lose all tokens. This would at least add some skill where you must prolong the chase to have a better chance of escape, instead of it being a locker Dwight‚Äôs go to perk.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cn9h5y/looks_like_stalky_boy_got_his_work_cut_out_for_em/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
To answer your first question: you missed Stake Out and how it‚Äôs Tapp‚Äôs best perk hands down because it allows you to stealth check Ruin and rush out side objectives because you‚Äôll have ensured great skill checks. This lets you play around healing much more when you have tokens saved up or lets you power through the end of a generator when you‚Äôre committing. 
---
Also running Vigil is strangely rewarding when you can cut off that exhaustion time but that‚Äôs more luxury than necessary but still far beyond being ass Tier. 
---
As far as Freddy perks go, I‚Äôd actually put Fire Up over Blood Warden. Sure BW can potentially give you that sneaky kill at the end but that‚Äôs way more reliant on the survivors wasting their own time instead of leaving. Fire up actually allows you retain a midgame/late game pressure if generator progress goes too fast either due to Ruin/Corrupt Intervention running its course or the killer you‚Äôre playing as has little to no mobility. 
---
Lastly, I never called you stupid or implied you weren‚Äôt intelligent. You presented a weak argument for the other perks without adding any supporting evidence of the other perks until your reply post. All I stated was you undervalue some of those niche perks but them being niche doesn‚Äôt inherently make them bad.

GOOD! now set it on fire and name it NOED.

Me too, it's cool to see other people are like that a lot of the time too.

&gt; The show is big time overrated
---
Subjective my dude. Aside from season 2 the show has been enjoyable IMO.
---
&gt;  and anyone that actually wants its stamp on dbd doesn‚Äôt understand the horror genre.
---
That's pretty damn entitled. "Anyone who disagrees with me doesn't understand the genre!" What one thing that Stranger Things does really well is having a good blend of genres. Each group of characters have a different genre of story that was popular in the 80's, with them only converging at the end. Sure that means it's not a pure horror, but the elements are there. I would like DbD to get more popular and while Stranger Things would be a bit of a black sheep I wouldn't necessarily shun the idea.
---
&gt; Those rumors are just people that want it to happen and nothing else.
---
I'm not saying it's guaranteed, but between the leaked audio files being similar to Stranger Things S3 OST and Netflix's tweet confirming a crossover between a Netflix property and a Behavior property, I don't know how you could just say it's "nothing else".
---
Im not dogging on dbd. I love the game. Im just admitting its violent. Its a fucking meme. Chill.
---
You too, Like you said there‚Äôs so much hate in this community that sing a good message is refreshing and makes you feel good.
---
Yo dude, I got the game for free and it had all those killers and survivors included. Just thought you should know. Take care bby
---
Imagine Suiciding on hook and DC‚Äôing like that intentionally. 
---
&gt;streams for entertainment of others. 
---
&gt;whines and DC‚Äôs cause of a bad game. 
---
 Big Oof.
---
Dude if you look at Kate in her base shorts she is PACKIN SOMETHING.
---
Get good at looping, do gens, go for safe unhooks and you pip every game unless you get tunneled or camped, which shouldn‚Äôt happen often unless they see you are 1) toxic af 2) weakest link on the team
---
How dare you try to tell someone else what to do with their body you patriarchal fuck. Tits are meant to be free and crazy. So why don't you mellow out your testicles?! HOW DOES THAT FEEL STEVE?!?!!!!!!
---
We've all done it, there isn't anything to be ashamed of, sometimes you just get a bad game and you need to balance it out with iridescent axe heads and memento moris.
---
ok I'm just going to assume you're either new or bad at the game
---
Leave your steam profile so that only friends can comment, what's so funny I had a group of SWF that was all saying they are gonna raid my comment section but it  was all blocked and they all got pissed in chat. It was hilarious
---
Panda flat out taught himself to be more calm and not swear as much since some of his close friends / family had kids somewhat recently. At least that's what I've heard.
---
It's still really nice that he does his best to not be toxic.
---
bzzt bzzt....... bzzt
---
Bond is actually really good
---
Honestly one of my biggest arguments for Self Care is because Monitor and Abuse is so popular among killers, and the ones that don't have built in stealth. Letting yourself stay injured just raises the likelihood of you going down without giving a chase. And then suddenly the 30 seconds you save not healing doesn't seem so bad when the killer gets 2 minutes and snowballs more unhooks off your instadown
---
Is the fully upgraded urban evasion speed the same as walking speed or is it faster/slower?
---
The hooked survivor is using Kindred
---
If a generator was done when the killer hooked someone, then you were Rancor
---
Same lol but it makes its way into some of my more aggressive buids
---
Empathy is quite good, Botany can be useful in some situations too.
---
I tried using this shit to get the "escape Killer's grasp" achievement. They suck.
---
I definitely break off of chased from players I've already wounded to smash a gen should we go by it. Once I get some more get protection teachables I think I'll be in good shape. Thanks again.
---
No...not my dwight
---
When the killer leaves and you want to be saved: "Hmm searching this chest would be cool"
---
When the killer is camping: "Let me just unhook you real quick"
---
Looks like lag switch or at least bad connection. Sadly BHVR doesn‚Äôt do anything to combat these guys, we just have to wait for dedicated servers to come out
---
The thing is even before she actually DCed she opens up the menu and jokes about "making her escape" and DCing on first hook. She then tries to pull herself off and (according to OP) the Killer stares at her in disbelief that she's suiciding on first hook. It's then when the Killer whos power *forces them to stand still* stands still beside her that she decides to DC.
---
I mean honestly the reaction of "iTs A sPiRiT **wItH [PRAYER BEADS](/intensifies)** (dogs howling in the distance over the sound of a dog whistle)" embodies this streamer in her entirety. I hate Prayer Beads as much as the next guy but when I go up against it I just groan a little and say "This is going to be a tough match..." I don't screech like a banshee and then DC on first hook.
---
Someone he plays with probably saw his name and decided to save it. It‚Äôs pretty common.
---
The sweet tingle of a million volts
---
I don‚Äôt necessary agree for a few reasons:
---
1: you do want to prolong chases as it give teammates time to do gens.
---
2. You don‚Äôt have to go out of your way because in almost every game you are going to get in a chase so this perk would reward you for extending it give your teammates more time to do gens.
---
3: they don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúhide‚Äù in hens they just have to jump in one before they get downed.
---
4: it is appealing as it allows for you to not allow yourself to get hooked until later in the game. Also, it prolongs your chase, not the game.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Yeah, I wouldn't waste my time on it if I were you.
---
Old Freddy could be a real monstrocity with the right mindset and playstyle. If people slept one dude at a time and chased them he was definitely garbage but if you simply slept and ran (Also, not hitting them until you're ready to down denies a self-care/medkit wakeup) and did your best to keep everyone asleep (Paid attention to auras. Guy crouching = guy being woken up so resleep him and the awake guy. Break chase to go back to exploded generators to re-sleep the woke dude) Freddy has EXTREMELY good stall.
---
My Freddy mindset was basically to waste EVERYBODY'S TIME and once I've gotten 54 concussions from pallets dropped on my head, survivors were kind of in trouble since no more pallets. 
---
You could also use survivor's own stupidity against them. People loved to disrespect or underestimate Freddy. 7 seconds seems like enough time to work on the gen a little longer but you jumpscare and grab them early because you used Pill Bottle to hide the freddy glimpses or used blocks to reduce the dream transition. (Red Paint Brush + Z-Block gives you a 3 second dream transition which is sure to catch anyone off guard the first time you sleep them) 
---
I also used to do shit like Red Paint Brush + Z-Block + Monitor and Abuse on Lery's. Survivors expect an easy game then suddenly Freddy turned into Mirror Myers on crack, with ZERO terror radius in the dream world (So not only are you nearly undetectable, you have perfect tracking outside of a chase) and a 3 second dream transition. (By the time you sleep them it's too late)
---
Even during the Mettle Of Man Crisis I still played Old Freddy. I'd throw on Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Monitor and Abuse, and Rancor. Hilarity ensued as I'd ignore the Obsession (Typically a Mettle Of Man + Dead Hard + Deliverance + Decisive + Instaheal combo) the entire match, go after the other 3 players, and One-Punch-Mori the obsession at the end. Nobody expected a Freddy to run Save The Best For Last and by the time they notice the fast cooldown it's already too late and I'd be machine-gunning everyone else down. 
---
I also remember getting Rotten Fields with both range addons stacked, and you could just sit in the middle of the cornfield, and hold M2 spinning around and auto-sleep everyone.
---
Old Freddy was hilarious. Yes he had flaws and he definitely was a weak killer but I found he was more effective than Wraith and Leatherface. I used to main Doc so Freddy's playstyle of giving sleep and disengaging felt natural to me. 
---
He couldn't defend worth shit though. I used to run Haunted Grounds on him all the time as survivors would set it off. I'd return to the hook to re-sleep the unhooked guy, etc. 
---
I am hoping we get a new killer (Demogorgon?) who ends up basically being a revamped, less annoying, and more fun version of Old Freddy. There are some people (me included) who miss Old Freddy and would gladly get a killer who has an overhauled version of Old Freddy's playstyle.
---
That's right, Mr. Now go P3 50 Rank 1 and get all addons and perks on your Jake.
---
Excuse me WHAT THE FUCK
---
Ok, true, I did miss some points, but this is a concept in the first point so it‚Äôs open to discussion. Knowing BeHaviour, it probably won‚Äôt be accepted into the game, but I thought it was worth nothing
---
It's incredibly grindy
---
Okay, thanks everybody! Guess I will have to buy those perks... well, this make me sad tbh. I didn't want to buy any perks that i am not going to use, but guess that I have no other option. Anyway, thanks for help everybody!
---
I‚Äôm thinking bad connection since it looks like you were the only one affected but idk, game broke
---
Wait you had 2 Uncloak speed add-ons how did he not hear you or see you? Good on you for getting the grab but oh my he needs to work on his awareness.
---
So I need to use iron will and spine chill every game? I guess I could but cmon now. Spirit is easy in a sense that if you have a headset and half decent ears then you can still hear exactly where a survivor is even when they‚Äôre not sprinting while being completely invisible while phasing. Survivor breathing (even while healthy) and small movements are very audible now more than ever imo which makes it even easier. She doesn‚Äôt deal with pallets, great mobility, and a ridiculously strong power that recharges very quickly even when you mess up

---
This micheal was just having an immersive gaming experience stalking his obsession don't judge him
---
I should also say that he kinda knew he was doing it, he shortly afterwards came back and taunted me.
---
If possible, I would try to get both Discordance and Surveillance, to see which one works better for you. Discordance is a passive perk that will give you a notification where two or more survivors are on a generator, while Surveillance is better for playing the regression game, where you use the regressing generators as a way to find out which generators to patrol.
---
Ok I saw part 2 first so I watched this second and its been solidified that this Bill is blind and Deaf.
---
You don't need any specific perk to chase/loop you just need to know how to chase/loop. Though the perks help. 
---
Few things to be aware of. 
---
Unless you have balanced landing long falls are a no no and will slow you down. 
---
There are two kinds of vaults, a fast vault, and a slow vault. Approach vault items at a 90 degree running speed to fast vault, which makes noise, otherwise you do a quieter slow vault.
---
The killer gets a speed boost called bloodlust that stacks 3 times every 15 seconds or so. You want to hit them will a pallet when this happens. Don't waste pallets the second a killer sees you. 
---
Most maps have really strong looping areas you can waste a lot of the killers time running around. Usually this is broken up into 2 or 3 areas. A center building with lots of vaults and pallets in and around it, a killer shack with 1 window vault and a pallet thats always in it, and maybe another side building like a tower. Sometimes there are others like the threshers on the corn fields or the construction machines on auto wrecker maps. A lot of survivor is just learning the set pieces and how to waste a killers time.
---
Aside from that be aware of the killer's abilities and try to figure out their perks.  If its nurse or spirit you can't sit on pallets like you might normally do. If its hag running to obvious looping areas might backfire. If its ghostface then reveal him then punish the hell out of him with the loops because he can't do anything against a decent looper with a good safe loop.
---
Your individual games do not matter. What matters is that against 4 good players one good player playing killer other then Nurse or Spirit dont really have a chance. Devs gave us stats that on average killers kill two but it does not matter for high level play where M1 killers need to find weaker survivors or they will lose in most cases.
---
Lol I loved the "no mither counters Plag" phase so many pple went through. I usually ran either Bitter Murmer or Rankour + the addon that gives you corrupt with every gen and it would just turn into a bloodbath every time a gen popped.
---
These where in two different games, both blind deaf bills haha. I was so surprised he didn‚Äôt hear me
---
I'll be honest: the conclusion I've come to about my opinion on Adrenaline is that the problem is less with Adrenaline itself but rather how easy it is for Survivors to loop Killers for an unbelievably long time due to the extreme excess of pallets and second chance perks that Survivors have. Adrenaline is simply pointed to as being a problem because it's a "win more" perk which makes it feel far more oppressive to play against.
---
I do think Adrenaline is a *bit* overtuned. Mid-chase Sprint Burst was patched out of the game for a reason and Adrenaline still enabling that is kind of a problem. ~~I'm actually in a fairly large minority that thinks the instaheal aspect of Adrenaline is perfectly fine, as it gives the perk the potential to save you in a dangerous circumstance or alternatively allow you to save time that would've been spent healing, which promotes the risky play of not healing beforehand.~~ But there are problems far bigger on the Survivor side that makes them way too strong, Adrenaline simply adding onto it.
---
That's not to say that Killer perks don't need fixing too and honestly: I think NOED is way too strong for what it does. The concept of a perk that allows you to come back and make the best out of a bad situation, as well as a perk that punishes gen rushing is fine. I just think instadowns are way too strong for its effect.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES THAT was EPIC
---
No Mither allows for getting up everytime, Unbreakable boosts the rate considerably
---
*OH FUCK*
---
What happens is that survivor mains DC against spirit and then immediately turn around and only use spirit when they play killer. It‚Äôs a great cycle.
---
Shift left click
---
console
---
You really nailed down the style, love the art.
---
I can't imagine why anyone would want to cleanse dull totems vs a killer that is notorious for running NOED
---
Ayy glad to hear it!
---
Didn't deny it being a paid promotion üôÑ
---
That‚Äôs dope
---
I agree with you. Billy is better.  I‚Äôm just simply stating that I enjoy playing leather‚Äôs different builds.  He has. High fun factor imo
---
i feel bad calling the last shrine the worst shrine ever now
---
Killer has a bit of priority, the survivor has to fall about halfway in order to remove the close prompt.
---
They can close it while the survivor is still jumping upwards, at least.
---
I knew they will release her last :(
---
Yeah HCA is just plain stupid, but I do think Ball Hog should be in the game. CJ is one of those, if I'm in the mood for it kind of things
---
A lot of red ranks just play through while injured, not worth it for them to self care or waste time looking for a heal. This is what nullifies plague/legion as they don't have a power after 5 mins.
---
Ew.
---
PIGFACE *OINK* *OINK*
---
I agree with you fully. I was just referring to viability. Mad bubba is definitely the most fun build in the game imo.
---
NON-DESCRIPT SALT BAG DUMP:
---
&gt;P3 HUNTRESS WITH AURIC CELL-EXCLUSIVE COSMETICS CAN BARELY HIT HATCHETS. LOOP HER ALL GAME JUST TO BE DOWNED WITH NOED.
---
&gt;LIKE RESPECT TO THE FACT THAT YOU LIKE HUNTRESS YOU SHOULD PLAY THE CHARACTERS YOU ENJOY BUT HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET TO P3 WITHOUT LEARNING HOW TO FUCKING AIM A GODDAMN HATCHET? IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A SHITTY EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING WHO RELIES ON NOED AND NOTHING ELSE TO GET KILLS AT LEAST PLAY A KILLER LIKE WRAITH OR PIG WHO CAN ACTUALLY CAPITALIZE ON NOED.
---
-
---
&gt;WAS PLAYING SWF WITH MY RANK 15 FRIEND. I GO UNHOOK SOMEONE WITH BORROWED TIME WHILE THE KILLER IS CHASING ME AND EXPECT THEM TO TAKE A HIT FOR ME. NOT ONLY DOES THIS CUNT *NOT* TAKE A HIT FOR ME, HE FUCKING **[BODYBLOCKS ME.](/intensifies)**
---
&gt;THANKFULLY THE FUCKFACE GOT FOUND PRETTY SOON AFTER THAT (YAY RANK 15S WITH NO BRAINS) BUT HOLY SHIT THAT MAKES ME ANGRY.
---
&gt;AND THE CUNT WAS RANK 10 TOO! HOW DO YOU GET TO RANK 10 WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT BORROWED TIME IS?!
---
&gt;RANK 13 CLAUDETTE WITHOUT BORROWED TIME FARMS ME OFF THE HOOK WHEN BILL HAS BORROWED TIME. SINGLEHANDEDLY GIVES THE KILLER 2 KILLS SINCE I DIE BY BEING FARMED AND THEN BILL DIES TRYING TO UNHOOK ME BEFORE CLAUDETTE CAN.
---
&gt;CLAUD THEN MOCKS THE KILLER IN POST GAME CHAT AND CALLS THEM TRASH, AND CALLS ME AND BILL SHIT FOR DYING TO HER. WELL I *WAS* ON MY FIRST HOOK BUT THEN SOMEONE FUCKING FARMED ME. CAN'T IMAGINE HOW I DIED WHEN I HAD ZERO CHANCE TO REACT TO BEING UNHOOKED RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KILLER.
---
&gt;TWO SURVIVORS QUICKSWITCH TO DWIGHTS WITH TOOLBOXES AT THE LAST SECOND. 3 GENS DONE BEFORE I FIND A SINGLE SURVIVOR. EVERY TIME I FIND THE DWIGHTS (WORKING TOGETHER WITH PROVE THYSELF, OBVIOUSLY) THEY TEABAG ME BEFORE RUNNING AWAY. WHENEVER I DOWN ONE OF THEM THE OTHER ONE IS THERE TO BODYBLOCK ME.
---
&gt;RANK 4 SWF. I COULD TELL THEY WERE SWF BY THEIR USERNAME AND COSMETIC CHOICES. I'M RANK 7. THE OTHER TWO WERE RANK 7 AS WELL SO YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE THE EXCUSE THAT THE AVERAGE RANK WAS 7.
---
&gt;WHAT THE FUCK? FIX YOUR SHITTY MATCHMAKER BEHAVIOR.

---
&gt;EPIC BRUH GAMER MOMENT #37: ONLY GETTING THREE HOOKS TOTAL AS NURSE WHEN YOU HAVE BOTH NOED AND A LAG SWITCH
---
Just bring back his original perks. There was nothing wrong with them.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt happen to be the guy I played with last night? I just started playing yesterday. I was in a match all the other survivors were dead and I‚Äôm injured limping around looking for the escape door then the killer stabbed me, picked me up and dropped me down the escape hatch! Lol he was a nice guy. All I hear is this is a very toxic community.im not quite convinced yet.
---
Adrenaline is a once per game perk, however. It makes sense that it's effect would be powerful.
---
Force them all to que and play with each other. If they play enough games without DCing they can queue back with the general population.
---
Iron Will is worth it. Start playing.
---
Leatherface is literally a shittier hillbilly lol
---
Not I changed the description to be accurate.
---
Ruins actual description implies that when you hit  a Good Skill Check your progress go down by 5% but that's not actually what is happening. Plus I added stuff that should probably include like info on how the Hex Totem behaves and included thr purpose of bring Cursed.
---
To be honest it could've bee much wordier.
---
So goes the way of Multiplayer games.  Even games that have mirror classes people scream "NERF" because player skill, Ping,  The moon aligned with Jupiter at certain times of the day creating a minor gravity well that makes mouse clicks faster, etc happens.
---
Do you know what perks were considered Ultra Rare back in the day?
---
But it's every round though and everytime I get on DBD, I can see the killers aura every time.
---
When I even go to check their perks sometimes I don't see Kindred on any survivor
---
Omg. I jumped just watching this.
---
Hey don‚Äôt body shame he‚Äôs all natural.
---
Freddy vs jason was great
---
Now we wait for the stands *killers*
---
What if more than 1 person is running MoM? At 4 stacks that's 2 MoM if safe unhooks are spread perfectly between the 2 persons which rarely happens, that's still not close to as powerful as old DS. At 5 stack it'd be rare to have more than 1 per game which would be pretty fair.
---
That would be ideal, but it's hard for me to not close app after an extra salty match
---
It can be balanced as long as the stipulations to get it fit the reward like Devour Hope or Bloodwarden 4ks. 
---
If four people are all running MoM and one person gets hooked, only one person can get that safe unhook and if the survivors all run to the hook to feed their stacks, this only plays into the killer‚Äôs favor. Aggressive Altruism has always been a killers strongest weapon because no one is doing generators and everyone just trying to get their one perk to maybe happen. 
---
The biggest problem old mom had was it was just too simple to get stacks but safe unhooks still require you to either forgo another perk slot (BT) to get a stack but you‚Äôre still risking your teammate or actually wait for an unhook and heal your ally there. 
---
I feel like when people say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôd be too easy to get stacks off safe unhooks‚Äù either overlook how little safe unhooks are even possible in a game or legitimately don‚Äôt know how to perform a safe/secure unhook.
---
spirit starts phasing next to her

---
lol love the shrine
---
Had a match like that today. No gens done, and was put on the hook twice and died because another survivor decided to get me off the hook just when i was put on it so the killer saw and i was hit. I was annoyed.
---
Bill fought undead
---
Joseph fought undead
---
Bill now has to deal with a new threat that involves more than just the undead
---
Joseph during stardust crusaders had to deal with a new threat that  involves more than just the undead
---
During at least one of the main events they deal with they are old men. (Semi stretch I know but I said ‚Äúat least one‚Äù since Bill is old the entire time)
---
Both are experienced and must rely on newer tactics to survive
---
Both had something to do somewhat with war (BRBRBRBRAKA-I dunno what the hell the nazi in part 2 said, anyway Bill was an army veteran, Joseph worked with a nazi when war was coming/was already occurring to beat the pillarmen)
---
Both are lovable old fellas with meme worthy reputations
---
Both have a daughter-figure in their life(Bill sees Zoey as his second chance and he sacrificed himself for her in the final level of Left For Dead, Joseph dies while trying to save his daughter from Dio and technically succeeds)
---
Both are brought back via very strange circumstances (depends on how you look at it, Bill was sent to the Fog, a place that accepts the living and dead, Joseph was revived by Jotaro because of Vampire blood from Dio fused with his own Hamon blood)
---
I‚Äôm not in the best position to think about comparisons at the moment so it‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs more to their similarities
---
lmao i feel this, sucks cause I rather get shrine perks for blood points than perks that I'll never want or use
---
My Dad thinks it causes my depression, even though I don‚Äôt have depression. Always looking to blame something on the violent video games
---
Why are you still coming at my neck? All I did was make an observation regarding the relationship between the Spirit and survivor mains
---
Thats low level. Camp the jigsawbox while crouched and refuse to chase the survivors, so they either die from trap on their head or literally let you kill them.
---
That is a great moment but depending on connection and latency the Spirit usually gets the hit through the pallet
---
I SAID MELLOW OUT YOUR TESTICLES OR I WILL SET 10 OF MY TRAPS IN YOUR ASS AND SET THEM ALL OFF AT ONCE.
---
I think Spirit is fine in her state. I did think about nerfing her power recovery slightly, but I think she is already hard enough to use. Especially for new players, she is probably tougher than nurse.
---

ok thanks

Oh my god are you doing fucking bones instead of doing god damn gens with me?!

Crap.

Mega crap.

I'll give you 8000 for all of em.
---
It could be a nice flavor thing to add to the game. I wouldn't be opposed. Thanks for the compliment :D
---
Ohhhhhh you so right. I changed it to reflect that.
---
They go down in 10 seconds but manage to waste 5 pallets at the same time
---
Wish I got these messages, but hey Gotta spread the love first to get the love
---
I WAS HAVING SO MUCH FUN WITH THE GAME, TRYING NOT TO GET ANGRY AND WHAT HAPPENS? SHIT SURVIVORS, FACECAMPING AND TUNNELING KILLERS. I'M SO SICK OF THIS, I JUST WANNA ENJOY THE GAME BUT I CAN'T. WHEN I FINALLY GOT ENOUGH FREE TIME TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME PROPERLY I FEEL SO DISCOURAGED.

Specifically what unique perks were considered Ultra Rare?
---
FLIP FLOP IS TRASH BHVR AND NOT WORTH THE 2700 SHARDS!!! Save them shards boys &amp; girls BHVR IS SMOKING CRACK!
---
I know. It didn't interest me that much at first, but then when it kept showing up every three weeks for a while, I decided to get it and try it out. It is very good
---
Actually, for someone who tried to use Autodidact, having 5 stacks is orgasmic just like dicc diccs
---
ragequitting is not reportable btw, you are just creating unnecessary extra work for the support team. Just spreading awareness. The system that will eventually punish these people, is automated.
---
I really don‚Äôt know why we don‚Äôt have DC penalties yet, the ‚Äúwe wouldn‚Äôt know if it was an internet crash or not‚Äù excuse is bullshit, especially in a game where DC‚Äôing is super super common
---
Plus if your internet crashes enough to get past the warnings of disconnecting and you get penalized, you shouldn‚Äôt be playing an online game in the first place
---
Yeah, it's hard to get, but if you manage so, it feels awesome. I even like sloppy butcher when I run it because, Its easier to get tokens, haha.
---
im exact opposite
---
Yeah I'd rather not make it even harder for killers to catch up after that initial burst of speed you get from the hit.
---
Yupper and if I‚Äôm the killer I don‚Äôt slug and go straight for the pickup because I will be coming for that asshole who thinks they are gonna body block!
---
Every god damn time.
---
Stop crying.
---
I can't "-rep he DC's in the first minute of the game" because some of them disable that feature. That is the only way I can vent.
---
I used to not see that many toxic killers but it's gotten worse since end game collapse was introduced.
---
wtf this is precious??
---
Tougher than Nurse? Dude Nurse is about x10 harder than Spirit.
---
I'm going to really disagree here. DS was proclaimed by the devs to have the idea of being an anti-tunnel perk. It is also definitely still one of the best survivor perks. The literal existance of the perk causes killers to fear it without a survivor even running it. The problem with the perk is it to be anti-tunnel, it should not punish killers for hooking survivors at fast rates while still alternating. The 5 second to 4 second change is because that's how it was before they recognized Enduring made the stun near pointless, and they never reverted the change, even after the Enduring nerf.   
---
I will also disagree on the No Ed idea. Totems were designed to be a secondary objective for players. When something is an objective it is encouraged to be done. With this change, totems will really feel like a secondary objective and require survivors to pay atttention to them. The majority of killers do not run No ed, however, if you think they have it then it puts pressure on the survivor. The fear of No ed also puts pressure on the survivor, as the totems are now a must have done, otherwise it will take 24 seconds to break No ed before it activates. 
---
Who knows, maybe No Ed would be reworked if that change went through, but I did not see the point in changing it, even though I do think it causes players to skip the learning killer phase of the killer side.
---
Me too :D
---
&lt;3
---
Thanks but no thanks
---
Toxic Meg:  *blows up generator we're both working on and sprints away*
---
Me: *gets chased and eventually hooked*
---
Also me:  *watches the meg crouch in a corner during each hook phase while our other 2 people are working on gens on the other side of the map*
---
Game over, de-pip
---
their name literally means speach therapist WHAT
---
On PS4, pressing the touchpad reverts the camera, so I think that's a feature for whatever reason.
---
They've basically given up on doing anything with Matchmaking until dedicated servers. I'm sorry this had to happen but hopefully we only have to deal with this bullshit for another month or so.
---
Should have replaced the grenade with a pipebomb.
---
What is the nword?
---
I mean the game lasted like 5min... I dont think anyone had fun! Especially not the pig!
---
This is an idealistic view of the game. However, if every loop was mindgamable, survivors would more often than not lose, especially at low ranks. Bloodlust has always been a weird mechanic, but it encourages the killer to keep chasing the survivor (even though they should probably leave them) and "rewards" them in a way for not breaking a pallet. It's weird. Thanks for the compliment :D
---
did the killer have rancor?
---
yea of course not ^^
---
no wait dont do thiz
---
Yeah, you can actually watch as the Meg leads the killer directly to the 90% complete generator--which happens to be the last one needed--that you've been working on.
---
Who here is circle-jerking streamer hate? This is a post about someone *literally* promoting DC's, something that is disrespectful to your team and damaging to the health of the game. If you want people to turn a blind eye to that, you're gonna have to get used to having the unpopular opinion 99% of the time.

Well it's probably just glitched out at the moment which is the only reason I can think of as I bought a perk last shrine for BP and it worked

I AM A KILLER MAIN BUT I FEEL PLAIN BAD FOR SURVIVORS I KEEP GETTING THIS GLITCH WHERE THE SURVIVORS GO THROUGH THE EXIT GATE BUT THE GAME DOESN‚ÄôT RECOGNIZE IT SO THEY JUST CAN‚ÄôT DO ANYTHING AND HAVE TO DIE BHVR NEEDS TO FIX THIS GLITCH ASAP
---
Most likely used SAM (Steam Achievement Manager) for those. Which is reportable and bannable
---
No. Killer queues are flooded because it's starting to lean killer sided again.  Just wait until they do something to buff survivors or nerf killers, it'll return to normal.
---
Dude I read the whole thing this is a great list of ideas overall, keep pushing it or maybe condense/split the ideas so it gets more attention in the community!
---
It alerts the killer that hooks are being sabotaged. Hooks destroyed by sabotage or sacrifices repair 30/20/10 seconds later. Automatic repair timer for Trapper's bear traps is reduced by 60 seconds.
---
i was expecting it and still got scared
---
oh thx
---
It won‚Äôt happen, I had a asshole response from a developer on how I needed to be more altruistic and take hits to get my mettle of man to work! 
---
Funny how they made that statement of wanting to make MoM strictly protection hits when they were rolling it around on nerfing the perk, then on the PTB make getting tokens for MoM with hook saves and protection hits.
---
2 weeks later they drop the new patch and guess what? MoM was nerfed to protection hits only and just made all three of his perks totally useless because all the people on PC cried like baby‚Äôs to BhVR!
---
Yeah, cause it's always under our control?

I guess they like it because it is the only place that they get a challenge as survivor, only it  looks like they they can't take it when they lose and need to block anyone that beats them.
---
then u se him get trapped
---
10/10 meme üëå
---
Thanks :D I'm gonna be honest I only posted it to this reddit page and the DBD forum. I don't really know where else to post it to make it spread quickly.
---
A teachable perk is available on the respective character bloodweb at levels 30, 35 and 40.
---
If you unlock a teachable perk (5000 bloodpoints), it will become available in others character's bloodweb.
---
The balanced labding girl is called Nea Karlsson, she's good, overall, but Claudette Morel and Dwight Fairfield are more begginer friendly.
---
Don't go so tryhard with the killers (especially Nurse), you'll be in low ranks for a while, pick any killer you like and have fun!
---
Welcome to the game, also!
---
Yeah I guess so, I think OP should remember that in verses games, the winrate is 50%
---
yeah that blast of music is scary
---
I have to turn my TV down when against him, I feel bad for the headphone users
---
I hope Dwight hugged my pennis like that everytime he does this but the asshole usually just waits for the hatch and then has the gall to say gg.
---
Teachables work like this: they appear on that character only until you buy them at lvl 30',35,40 then everyone gets them but it's random chance for them to appear on those characters. yes Nea is a good choice as she has good teachables. Nurse is probably the easier of the two as spirit is quite hard to learn but I'd say pick hillbilly as he's simple
---
There will always be the meta perks: DS, DH, Unbreakable, Adrenaline. Everything else is just you wanting some variety in your gameplay.
---
Then you're running object of obsession?
---
Nope ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there‚Äôs just much better content creators out there who don‚Äôt always whine the whole stream
---
Both
---
Specifically asking about leader
---
*starts slugging everyone in tier 3* USELESS USELESS USELESS USELESS
---
Depends, today a Dwight hid in a locker as soon as the match began (later I found out it was because he had a phone call to answer) and a Claudette and nea who were together led me to him to point him out because I found them first. As soon as it happened tho he left and for once I don't blame the survivor it was shitty. Next I found out the other Dwight that wasn't there was afk because he was trashing the Dwight that left. So in this case I'd let the poor baby in the locker live if he was there but he wasn't so I tunneled the shit out of the claud and nea and three gened them so I could farm them for points. It's situational
---
It's BBQ that lets you see Nea
---
classic leatherface
---
?? It specifically says that ragequitting is reportable in the list when you bring it up in game
---
Very true tbh.
---
hmmmm interesting
---
You asked if there were better perks. This person then gave you a list of perks that are better.
---
Spam the A button like you‚Äôre struggling on hook. Idk why it works but I read it on here last night and it worked for me.
---
I never asked for better perks. I said, I think there's better perks (personally) 
---
The question wasn't answered. That's all I'm asking.
---
Can we swap? I only get killer dailies. And I only play Jake :(
---
Love the music video to All Nightmare long!
---
I'm high as shit and i'm laughing my heart out wtf
---
Must be nice every game I play it‚Äôs nothing but toxic people lol they tea bag and I get a 4K then they cry say I camp or tunnel when they unhook right in front lf me as I‚Äôm walking away lol
---
I think i'm dying
---
No I don't know how I'm seeing the killers aura, I keep thinking it's we'll make it and kindred but it's not as I took kindred away and I can still see every killer's aura each game.
---
I am now a jake main sorry
---
Holy shit you can claim all after one match!
---
h a v e  f u n
---
DONT YOU GUYS FUCKING LOVE IT WHEN YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING WITH SEMI DECENT PLAYERS AROUND RANK 9 BUT WHEN EVER YOU GET HOOKED THEY WILL LEAD THE KILLER STRAIGHT TOWARDS YOU THEN PROCEED TO UNHOOK YOU IN FRONT OF THEM JUST SO YOU CAN GET FARMED THEN PUT BACK ON THE HOOK UNTILL YOU DIE THEN DERANKING UNTILL UR NOW RANK 15 WOW THIS GAME IS AMAZING
---
i always imagine the survivors see the others do their "perks" like self-care, and whenever they're in the same situation they recall what that other survivor did.
---
Two bad ones in a row means good one next?
---
in the main menu on the left (atleast on ps4) theres a section called Help&amp;Support, go there
---
Dope. Thank you so much for the help.
---
Yes because a rank seven shouldn‚Äôt be matched up with rank 20/14, and plus the game went way too fast
---
No problem, hope your shit gets fixed
---
dw i was accused of lag switching by a swf streamer when i lagged a tiny bit once :)
---
A NURSE WANTED MY ASS ALL GAME WHILE I WAS TRYING TO DO GENS (MOST I EVER GOT WAS A TAP) THEN WHEN I WOUDLNT HEAL THEM BECAUSE THE KILLER WAS SLUG BAITING TO KILL ME, THE KILLER DECIDED TO TEAM WITH THE PEOPLE BEING USED AS SLUG BAIT TO FARM ME TO DEATH. I DCD WHEN THE LAURIE SHOWED HER WHERE I WAS HIDING BECAUSE I TRIED MY BEST TO GET FARMED TO DEATH. I'M PRETTY SURE I GOT THE  ONLY GEN THAT WAS DONE TOO FOR FUCKS SAKE
---
FUCK ALL OF YOU SURVIVORS WHO JUST SIT IN THE CORNER FOR THE ENTIRE GAME
---
It‚Äôs easy bp
---
k means thousand, so around 200 thousand BP
---
Wow killers just keep getting shafted
---
BECAUSE YOU'RE FUCKING CAMPING, SURVIVORS ARE RIGHT AND KILLERS ARE WRONG, ALL KILLERS ARE TOXIC CAMPERS
---
I was agreeing with you and I never dpwnvoted your reply
---
I know that but it wasn‚Äôt fun at all, for me or the nurse
---
BELLISSIMO!
---
NEAFACE 
---
WAIT A SEC THAT MAKES 0 SENSE
---
I swear my friends get into ~rank 15 lobbies even at ranks 1-2, sometimes those obnoxious games are just meant to be
---
My god, the entities realm, the entire thing is a stand!
---
Fair enough
---
But when I cry your mother comes and gives me a bj and I like her bjs
---
Billy, Plague, Clown and GhostFace for my mains
---
And David as my survivor main
---
anyone else have an issue using them on Mothers Dwelling? i literally couldnt make fake pallets unless i broke real one, and before anybody sais anything yes you're supposed to be able to put pallets in new spots
---
What are the best perks for survivors/killers with all the new added characters? I haven‚Äôt played in a while, since shortly after the huntress release and I am trying to get caught up to speed
---
Nothing counters nurse
---
Always nice seeing a NOED nurse getting destroyed.
---
Hopefully this game discouraged that person from ever playing nurse again.
---
EVERYTIME I ADJUST MY HEADPHONES THE FUCKING GAME GIVES ME A SKILL CHECK SO IM JUST LIKE FUCK IT DUDE I HATE THIS DAMN SKILL CHECK BULLSHIT
---
ALSO THAT'S SUCH A MEG THING TO DO. THEY ALWAYS CHOOSE THE WORST FUCKING SECOND TO FUCKING UNHOOK YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SMALLEST FUCKING BRAINS EVER. I THINK EVEN FUCKING BLENDETTES ARE SMARTER THAN MEGS
---
SWFS ARENT AS BAD AS MEGS, TRUST ME
---
it's survival of the fittest; people that get annoyed by t-bagging at the gate either quit or become survivors and only the sadistic monsters remain for killers
---
i honestly hate playing in red ranks but i have to dc every 4 game for not ranking up so thats pointless
---
I run BT, and I always soak a hit for the person being rescued, I usually end up down, and then the killer goes for them.  Sometimes they use that speed burst after the free hit to escape, and sometimes they fail at escaping, however, I end up hooked often using BT.  When I'm on the hook, however, I get downed immediately and hooked without the killer giving chase to the person farming.  Kinda sucky.
---
I rarely even play Spirit, let alone prayer beads. So you‚Äôre gonna DC against me because ‚Äúüò≠‚Äù? Really man? I can‚Äôt wait until dedicated servers come around so salty little fucks like you quit ruining the game. Dedicated servers and punishing DCing, rage quitting losers like yourself will be the best thing that‚Äôs happened to DBD in a long time.
---
"on release" implying he isn't the same. Oh yea, they did buff his nightshroud to make no noise when activated which is good, also buffed his killer instinct detection when revealed. Unless that 4% radius of reveal was enough to make him dogshit.
---
‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôm superior and hating things makes me look cool and edgy.‚Äù Get that weak shit outta my post dude. If you wanna bitch about anime go do it on a subreddit with sad, likeminded individuals.
---
Maybe youre right about the collision. I wouldn't know because I do not play spirit so I won't speak on that. Something definitely needs to be done about broken beads though. Its incredibly frustrating especially if you play solo
---
You don't have to get 3 safe unhooks tho, it's a mix of unhooks and protection hits so it's much more likely to proc.
---
Get hit next to a downed person, unhook someone, take a hit for them around the hook. There, you have it charged. Currently you'd have to take 3 hits, now you only need 2.
---
You should just try to de rank and play stress free. idk how to derank tho
---
Leatherface is so bad, hillbilly has an easier time downing people with his chainsaw than leatherface does, go into a match with both and see how many downs you get with the chainsaw, count them. I guarentee you'll get more downs with Billy. And like 1 down per match with bubba because you need the perfect cosmic scenario to be able to down someone with bubba's saw (bit of hyperbole but its true)
---
What's the first amendment
---
**I FUCKING HATE WHEN IM LOOPING THE KILLER AROUND EASY-PEASY, BUT ALL OF THE SUDDEN FOR .4 SECONDS THE GAME DECIDES TO LAG, AND I GET HIT THROUGH A WINDOW AND DOWNED THROUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN, THAT SHIT MAKES ME WANT TO D/C EVERY TIME**
---
**I CANT WAIT FOR DEDICATED SERVERS I JUST WANT TO BE LOOP KING**
---
LMFAO I thought this couldn't be real, but I just found it here: https://youtu.be/0C_IBSuXIoo?t=15
---
Of course a Dwight incel will hate a POC.
---
I apologize for my accusation.
---
**THE HAGS POWER IS LITERALLY CAMPING JUST WITH EXTRA STEPS**
---
HAhHahHahahahahH hurr durr
---
I've literally spent all day in the basement camping but I just wait for survivors and meme around.
---
I HAD A GAME WHERE I GOT  CHASED BY A TUNNELING LF FOR LIKE 3 OR 4 GENS AND  MY TEAMMATES DECIDED TO HELP ME GET OUT BECAUSE I BULLIED HIM EVEN THO I TRIED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF TO THE LEATHERFACE TO LET NEA ESCAPE. THE LEATHERFACE WAS SALTY BECAUSE HE DIDNT GET TO KILL ME AND INSTEAD GOT TO KILL THAT NEA D; I'LL ALWAYS MISS YOU NEA ;( 
---
GUESS THERE'S MORE THAN TWO TYPES OF TEAMMATES I NEVER KNEW THAT, USUALLY THERE'S JUST THE TYPE THAT FUCKS YOU OVER SO THEY CAN ESCAPE
---
i dont dc, i take it like a man and accept my facecamping faith. what i mean is its a fact that most of the killers are trying to make this game unfun for their opponents and this needs to stop. there are certain solutions for that i wont go deep into.
---
Heart rate increases*
---
DID HE TRAP CAMP YOU?
---
Yep, an iconic quote from a hardworking claudette
---
Can we admire this guys username for a moment?
---
BECAUSE WE WANT YOU GOODIES
---
No offense, but some of the stuff you've put for flavor text or character quotes, makes you seem like a predator. Might just be me, but that's how I hear it.
---
tbh, i think the add-on should be reversed back how it was in the first place
---
it used too. but they changed it for "region balance"
---
It‚Äòs beautiful
---
but jojo so bizarre and unpredictable and random!? I love it so much when big muscle guy eat black noodles but he don't like them then he love them omg!
---
SOME PERKS IF YOU CHANGE THEM THEY COULD BECOME ANNOYING TO PLAY AGAINST WHILE OTHERS ACTUALLY NEED A CHANGE BUT DON'T GET CHANGED
---
*spirits husk is standing still as she phase walks*
---
"SHes faCecAmpInG"
---
"Get fucked you fucking idiot" she says as she dooms her team. God I hate the playerbase of this game.
---
*unzips pants*
---
I say give him a charge move where he can run faster like Billy and can attack during the charge but with no 1ko and can be turned more easily and have a meter where he gets tired like nurse and legion 
---
This helps him have more map control letting him run around quicker.
---
This is based off his backstory mentioning his athletic prowess but due to his obesity and potentially health problems he gets winded easily
---
yep :3
---
i tried dcing and trying to actually have fun in green, purple ranks but thats all other thing. survivors you get are completely potaroes croaching around the corners on the map and since its a team based game its inevitable to get destroyed which makes it probably more unfun.
---
I understand your concern and it‚Äôs definitely good you had the foresight to think of that; I don‚Äôt believe the effect is strong enough for that to even be much of an issue. It is after all, 15 seconds of being a bit faster, probably 2 or 3 vaults.
---
The only dangerous number of nude Myers is zero
---
bruh
---
I RUN FRANKLIN'S SO I CAN BUILD A COLLECTION ON MY FLOOR. MWAHAHAHA!
---
1000 points for cleansing a dull totem? I don‚Äôt care how pissed it makes my teammates, I‚Äôm going for them everytime.
---
Im not condoning DCing, but the man has a point. That is literally what brought them to rework legion or else the devs wouldn't have seen a problem with him. I understand you may not use this OP add-on that often but I play dbd everyday and I face it AT LEAST 2-3 times a day. Im sure it would be more often if people didnt DC so much against it or act like potatoes which makes it harder for the killer to pip but im not 100% sure on that as I dont play killer much.
---
Bruh what are you doing flag that shit NSFW, there should be a warning before you have to gaze upon such a divine figure.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt get it lol
---
i am actually more of a killer main but i definitely want to see people playing some other killers other than spirit nurse and huntress and dont fooking camp everytime they managed to hook a survivor
---
You will play differently based on what perks you have tho, the perks you use affect your strategy.
---
You won't be looking for a hill to fall from if you're not running balanced landing, you will be less ballsy around loops if you're not running Iron will, you'll never want to get into a locker mid chase if you're not using Q&amp;Q + head on, etc. Sure the core gameplay of looping and doing gens doesn't change, but you can't say that different perks don't change your strategy.
---
If someone hid the entire game Adrenaline doesn‚Äôt really benefit them. Nobody in this thread called NOED a crutch for bad killers.
---
Dying on hook will always be an option, I don't mind either one.
---
Jeez, heard around that it should get better around rank 15, true or nah?  
---
How are new players supposed to join :l, seriously, everytime I watch the charts I‚Äôm shocked that DBD has a solid 12k daily playerbase with no region servers while Deathgarden has them and it just makes 200 players.
---
Yeah that would be the one.
---
Also bringing up MW2's "No Russian" mission in current year. The entire point of that mission is that it's meant to be something horrible that the player is meant to be repulsed by. It's so graphic that you can flat out skip it in-game. And yet idiot politicians who have never played a game in their life think this is what the average video game portrays.
---
I DON'T THINK TRAPPER GETS ENOUGH LOVE, HE'S REALLY GOOD!
---
Ghost face better imo (better as in more fun)
---
I have to get out of grey ranks first.
---
While I do usually do some goofing around when I'm rank 12, I took a couple month break and am now back up to rank 17 and queue times are a pain in the ass.
---
Wow that is a wide range to get caught up on. I think it would be just easier to tell you what is sort of the standard meta for most killers and survivors respectively. (What I see the most)  I would say the current useful on every killer meta build would be, BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury/Brutal Strength and Enduring. Survivor side I would say the meta build is something like Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Selfcare, and something like borrowed time, DS, prove thyself .
---
He could have just grabbed you. But respect for making it scary.
---
*LAUGHS IN NEVER  TAKING ITEMS OUT OF CHESTS AND NEVER BRINGING ITEMS*
---
He was tryna get that exposed status on me
---
I lean as Billy to try to will my curve shots to hit
---
*Loud grunts and moans intensifies*
---
I don't believe so. It could be that they were testing something with the Plague and it could've 1. Messed up the code making corrupt purge insta down or 2. It accidentally got released on this patch kinda like Ghostface did.
---
I literally only play Jake for survivor and I never get Jake rituals
---
LMFAO the things that this sub produces
---
aaaAAAAAAAAA
---
I sometimes get jumpscared from pallet stuns
---
Love it
---
You don't have to if you don't want to, it's all part of what makes this *your* concept, I just thought I'd point it out.
---
OH NO. HOW CAN I GET MY OFFERINGS THEN?
---
Cool, then you‚Äôre cool with killers DCing against Haddonfield right?
---
It‚Äôs changed. Don‚Äôt worry.
---
Cool man. You‚Äôre the reason your team lost. Easy BPs for the killer.
---
I played the old one and honestly he was really good against ranks 20-14
---
Right? I wasn‚Äôt even gonna report you for watching me on the hook the entire time!
---
IT'S STILL BORING TO PLAY AGAINST WHEN YOU GET THE CORNFIELD WITH YOUR BRIGHT ASS SHIRT 99% OF THE TIME YOU PLAY AGAINST FREDDY SO YOU CANT EVEN TRY TO HIDE IN CORN AND BY THE  TIME YOU GET IN A CHASE MOST OF THE PALLETS THAT COULDVE BEEN LOOPED AROUND ARE FAKE AND THE ONLY THING LEFT IS L WALL T WALLS  OR YOU GET FOUND FIRST AND HAVE TO HOPE ALL THE PALLET SPAWNS ARE SAFE. 
---
YOU DON'T  EVEN HAVE TO USE ADDONS AS FREDDY ANYWAYS HES BETTER THAN HE WAS BEFORE THE REWORK AND IF YOU HAVE TO USE DREAM PALLETS YOU'RE JUST SHIT
---
Same but I'm a meg main
---
The Left Behind perk is poor in its design but utilized more as a flavor aspect. Keeping with that I wanted to move the perk in a direction to keep its flavor while being practical at what its goal is, which is to complete the last generator while you are the onnly person alive. With the large percent bonus, this is now possible in many more situations. (Also, rather than insulting someone's understanding of the game, make an argument for why you think what you do.)
---
Lithe with an activation would not be nuts. It is already the second weakest of the exhaustion perks and has a problem stemming with when it can be used. The conditional of a window is already limiting. Now, Lithe can be used when the survivor feels necessary and the survivor does not have to trigger Lithe off of medium vaults that they get hit on. I see if you think its too strong, it could be dialed back to require a fast vault. 
---
Territorial Imperative is not designed anywhere near a killer power. It is designed to have instinct over a territory like the perk name entails. It is probably overly complicated as I have written it, but I think if put in game it can be explained more effectively in the perk screen. 
---
Saying the nerf to Primer Bulb is not necessary because chainsaws are easily counterable is not a good argument, but I see where you're coming from. It is designed more to dial back the percent bonus in combo with the leatherface .1 second buff and when it comes to Hillbilly, the 2% decrease will make a difference in very few scennarios. 
---
Why should the totem change not be implemented?
---
ASK ANOTHER SURVIVOR FOR THE OFFERINGS
---
IF I EVER GET AGAINST YOU, ASSUMING YOU'RE ON PC, I'LL GLADLY LEAVE AN ITEM FOR YOU
---
Right? I wasn‚Äôt even going to report you for standing still the ENTIRE time I was on hook!
---
Even one extra health state can turn the game around if the players involved are good, you don't need all 4 to be using it.
---
A trap you've placed on someone will active when a gen finishes. So if all gens are powered and you put a trap on someone it'll never activate.
---
Always!
---
I'm gonna assume he meant it as if you DC because you are unhappy with the game and decide to join another game right after, there's no good reason for that.
---
Personal reasons, emergencies, etc. make sense, for any game.
---
I AM ON PC. I'VE GOTTEN MANY OFFERINGS TODAY. GIVEN OR TAKEN. ITS YOUR CHOICE.
---
I had a pig grab me off a gen once and absolutely scared the piss out of me, I had no idea her terror radius was suppressed for a few seconds after leaving stealth mode. Honestly, grab games are my favorite matches.

---
no killers do not. most would just back out and it would affect the game in a very negative way
---
I know what you mean. Red ranks SUCK
---
So the scenario I described above...the trap is active? And will start ticking down when they are unhooked?
---
it would hurt the game if they did that
---
Yea but a grab woulda downed you too. Guess he didn't think about it?
---
To answer the question, yes it does. As soon as a gen pops any traps on a head activate.
---
idk if youre directing this towards me or the other guy but I PERSONALLY would not mind tbh. I get it if its a billy or something, hes at a disadvantage but I wouldn't encourage anyone to DC like I said in my comment. I also dont think a random selected map/a map offering holds the same weight as prayer beads. You have options as a killer on a map that isnt ideal.
---
No0b3 mispronounced 'the plague' as 'the plag'.
---
hmm, it must be a bug then
---
No it won't start ticking down until a gen is completed after it's placed on them.
---
Leaving the game prematurely like that is a 1 week ban according to the devs. Do they enforce rules against female streamers?
---
I don't believe it just randomly happened. Even if it did you proceeded to abuse it for the rest of the game.
---
I play on ps4 and it‚Äôs a not a must
---
iNsTa DC
---
lol it probably cuz u suck or just read off some post the problem with bubba is most just camp with him which makes him weak if i camp with hillbilly of course i will most likly get the same results and bubba chain saw is a lot harder to dough than a billy chainsaw
---
The killer isn‚Äôt trying to ruin the survivors game just by playing his role. Teabagging is going out of your way to be toxic
---
It's funny because  you can tell they're confused
---
Yeah ill put some muds on my hand
---
Make some triangles
---
Make people do gens
---
Teleport to the triangles 
---
Now I am violent :o
---
You can use Iron will so you can do gens while injured and bond so you can help someone else with gens
---
Trapper and Pig ignored this image.
---
Very similar to Plague, honestly. Plague's power is almost meaningless if survivors don't cleanse and give her corrupt purge
---
I prefer to point
---
Depends on the rank and if your talking about top tier then listen to everyone else.
---
According to the devs, if there is video proof, they ban for this.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
The penalty for intentionally DCing on video is 1d &gt; 2d &gt; 1w &gt; Permanent.
---
How 75% of survivor mains look when they can‚Äôt handle the pressure.
---
It's obviously a good game when you make crybabys DC, what are you talking about?
---
Shirtless clown when
---
I'd say that's more how the baby survivor mains that dc look.
---
As killer I‚Äôve never had a single survivor escape my grasp while using Boil Over.
---
&gt;Back 
---
BRO this is how i want to play the gamee lol why cant i find people like you. everyone's just sweating like they get PaId to play or smth.. ignoring all the fun there is. HMU FAM lmao im on ps4 tho :C
---
You'll hit rank 1 in no time, frend
---
How the three survivor's look after they DC
---
WHY WHY WHY IS IT THAT WHEN I RESCUE MY TEAMMATES FROM THE BASEMENT AGAINST HAG THEY JUST HAAAAAAAAAAAAVE TO RUN UP THE STAIRS????? THREE BASEMENT RESCUES RUINED, THREE!!!! DONT. FUCKING. RUN. DAMN IT.
---
He chased me for 1 gen dude... and we both had fun while he had 0 intention to kill us.
---
This game is riddled with bugs, if you haven't had one just randomly happen to you... then are we even playing the same game?
---
All I want is maybe a BP bonus for going against SWF. Maybe I'd dodge less if there was incentive to stick around, even against a suspected Bully-Squad.
---
LIKE WHAT, I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOUR INPUT MAY BE ON THIS MATTER!
---
and the game after that
---
It doesn't. You might be thinking of the EGC, which causes *ALL* gens to be blocked off, even finished ones.
---
I love the killers who will tunnel like a cunt all game then give the hatch away. Refuse it! Say "No! Put me on that fucking hook you dirty try hard tunnelling cunt!"
---
I'm not the only one who read this in Patrick Stars voice right?
---
I don‚Äôt like your attitude
---
Your a spastic
---
First off, not a swf main at all. Secondly, yes you do compete against a killer and or survivor but that does not make it a competitive game in the sense I'm talking about as far as pro league and actual tournaments. But I can tell that you are just angry because you got beat a few times and are entirely close minded and only your opinion matters so I'll end it here.
---
Ouch üò≠
---
if i thought their name was funny in the lobby and/or if i thought they were a total cutie pie they  get out if they‚Äôre the last one (and i try to play to let them be the last one)
---
but if they play like dicks, nahhh
---
if i totally creamed a team/useless teammates and if i feel bad for the last guy i‚Äôll let them do a gen and let them live if they want to
---
i don‚Äôt usually give hatch because i want points but it‚Äôs nice to get thank you messages at the end lol
---
if they don‚Äôt struggle then i may give hatch
---
What is this?
---
I'm not sure but I'd like one from the movie :c
---
It‚Äôs not a matter of opinion. Stranger Things barely belongs in the horror genre as it is so no it doesn‚Äôt belong in dbd in the slightest. I hope the most we get is cosmetics that look like the kids because the sheriff dude is overrated as hell too. He doesn‚Äôt need to be a character. Lol
---
I loved this - thank you so much !!
---
Even Ghostface be like, *bruh, what the hell?*
---
I still 4K with bubba I‚Äôm just saying he is weak. He  has zero map control or stall potential, and very little chase potential. If a survivor knows how to loop properly, you won‚Äôt chainsaw them unless they are in a dead zone. He doesn‚Äôt have much to help him win. Of course, there are bad survivors at all ranks, so any killer can be used, but he way outperformed by all other killers in the game. They just need to buff his charge speed and movement speed while revving his chainsaw, then he will be much more viable.
---
I' am almost rank 17 fren : )
---
Depends on ur playstyle. Myers is only stealthy in T1 w/o  add-ons and can expose all survivors, while ghost face is stealthy nearly all the time but can expose one survivor at a same time, so u cant go on rampages like myers can.
---
Ghostface can tbag tho so thats a plus.
---
Since it's your cake day, we forgive you
---
Which I've done before. It's so satisfying to close the hatch on someone jumping in and then chainsaw them. I let the dude wiggle off and nodded at him while he opened the exit gates chainsawed him again right as he escaped. He wasn't a toxic survivor and I know I wasn't gonna double pip
---
Just be in a safe place 4head
---
I honestly don't see any defence for Tea bagging. I have seen a couple of people say it's a strategy to upset the killer, but those same people get upset when the killer decides to be just as annoying.
---
Moderately decreases¬†the range of the sound emission radius while using Yamaoka's Haunting.

That's really good. You're well on your way. Be careful though because rank reset is next Tuesday
---
IF SMALL GAME HAD A TOTEM COUNTER IT WOULD BE WAY BETTER THAN BEFORE MEANING IT SHOULDN'T NEED A TOTEM COUNTER WHILE NO ONE LEFT BEHIND NEEDS A BUFF BECAUSE IT BASICALLY HAS NO USE
---
I know right? Playing the game by using perks available to you is toxic ? Dead by daylight is like hide and seek + more of a game of tag. People (survivors) being chased by the person who is IT, bitch and moan. The person who is IT (killer) chasing them bitches and moans that they are obviously trying to get away. the point of the game for each side is to win their objective. It‚Äôs childish. Throwing toxic around to whine and not be productive just because you‚Äôre a sore loser / don‚Äôt get your way. Im interested how these people perform irl in sports and RL games, probably demand a time out for every play when the enemy team gets an advantage / scores a point. It‚Äôs a game people. Quit fucking bitching and just play. It‚Äôs just a game.
---
Skill checks aren't affected by lag
---
That‚Äôs actually the build I use for Ghostface! I like it because Sloppy/Nurses discourage healing, but you really need to heal against a Ghostface.
---
Current in my opinion
---
S: Nurse 
---
A: Spirit, Hillbilly,
---
B: Huntress, Freddy, Hag, Shape
---
C: Doctor, Pig, Plague, Ghostface
---
D: Trapper, Wraith, Clown
---
F: Cannibal, Legion
---
These are just my personal opinions on them sitting around green rank.
---
Twitch slang for you stupid fuck
---
You've literally edited the original post so many times, nobody can tell what you asked first.
---
Just give a blood point boost to the killer for the number of people in a swf.
---
2 people = 10%
---
3 people = 15%
---
4 people = 20%
---
Would make the quick mostly toxic games less annoying.
---
Holy fuck I have never laughed that hard, I recently started playing Ghostface for this exact reason, I love jump-scaring the shit out of players LMAO
---
Ahhh okay thanks
---
I WOULD SUGGEST FOR LEFT BEHIND TO GIVE AN ACTION SPEED BUFF FOR EACH DEAD TEAMMATE, ALBEIT A MUCH SMALLER ONE THAN IT CURRENTLY HAS!
---
Spirit wasn't camping. He was phasing next to her only.
---
I get accused of tunneling so much, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄòI can hear you healing behind the wall, why wouldn‚Äôt I go check it out‚Äô. 
---
Or when you hit a surv or get pallet stunned you can hear if they ran left or right and immediately chase them.
---
You‚Äôd be insane to play this game without good headphones or speakers
---
BOTH LEFT BEHIND AND  NO ONE LEFT BEHIND NEED A BUFF
---
I added a couple of things,and I removed am i wrong? Because maybe people were confused thinking I was asking for suggestion perks. Someone gave me a solid answer, and I totally agree with him.
---
That was horrific
---
says get fucked
---
DCs
---
???
---
Yeah its pretty novel seeing as no other killer can crouch. I'm sure it brings a bit of amusement
---
Can't spirit see your blood trail? So doesn't that mean you should find healing against her? I haven't played against her a lot so idk.
---
That's what it looks like to me, but I'm no expert.
---
Took the words right out of my mouth.
---
We get it you play survivor no one gives a fuck
---
I think the reason why it is as it is now is because of how the hitboxes work and how they animate each killer. The human shape for each one allows for easy design and animations compared to trying to use a four legged model or some abstract shape. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôre able to pump one out every 3 months
---
Right...
---
Being spooky as ghostface is one of my favorite things, especially if there‚Äôs like two survivors left I like to just follow them around for a bit before exposing them
---
By hiding isn't that how it should be?
---
Break line of sight during chases that works so long as it isn't doctor
---
To me looping is a stupid mechanics it looks silly and is boring as hell both as survivor and killer
---
I thought it‚Äôs pronounced as Plag and ‚Äúue‚Äù is silent. Is ‚Äúue‚Äù pronounced the way it does in ‚Äúvenue‚Äù?
---
&gt;But I can tell that you are just angry because you got beat a few times and are entirely close minded and only your opinion matters so I'll end it here. 
---
Your hypocrisy is hilarious.
---
From experience I can say that it doesn't matter how clean I play, I will get at least one survivor that wants to show me how to twerk. Getting a full escape without teabags is a rarity.
---
Where is the download? Can't find it anywhere in the comments.
---
I feel like that map would be sort of cheap
---
This is the good stuff

Imagine thinking a Spirit who's obviously phasing is camping lmao what a wallaby
---
Bro shut up and run spine chill.
---
The devs said they‚Äôre never doing a non-humanoid killer. That‚Äôs subject to change I‚Äôm sure but as of now their answer is no.
---
I doubt it too but it is a way to make Leatherface good and make basically a new killer with Billy. Hell Hillbillies use crazy shit to torture people in movies.
---
Playing old freddy correctly was super boring for survivors

Blood pools are still mega unfun, but the matches don't take forever at least

Welcome to rank 20

Please do more this is too beautiful.

Commit devour hope
---
lol idk if im dyng or already dead considering i got mori by a bubba last game for this shit **cough**
---
Id never judge a immersive gamer
---
I just searched it up and it‚Äôs basically emojis for twitch üñï
---
Change out the apple for black incense.
---
Good. I don't see why people have to be dicks and hang around the end to taunt the killer.
---
Yeah, what you said.
---
I take tunneling as a practice for running the killer. That's my weakest part of the game. You always have the option to DC. I don't like to DC unless it's suddenly major lag switching, or my 8 month old son starts screaming in the middle of the night. In the end, I see it as I'm out of the game faster for a better killer.  I block them on MLGA and move on.
---
Doubt he‚Äôll get a ban
---
I love spine chill and balanced landing
---
Poised, Deadhard
---
Devour Hope, Discordance 
---
I don't like dying light as in my opinion it promotes a tunneling playstyle. But it's great
---
Ochido in a nutshell
---
Yep but it has the meaning of that
---
My main perk build is Resilience (underrated and fuck me that 9% is godly), Botany Knowledge (no brainer), SC (obviously) and BL. 
---
The main idea of my build is that it benefits me and my teammates, with Res and BK that's a 42% increase on healing them, while making my Self Care only 8% slower, Balanced landing obviously to help in a chase.
---
Even though it's a meme, I do love No Mither as a perk because it makes amazing synergy with a specific build type.
---
yeah i always do that after an interesting match with the killer lol it rly isnt hard, just to acknowledge their skill after a game.. they should ad the chat tho... whats stopping them lol. also dont let the chat just go offline like on pc i the killer leaves, just switch hosts until everyone leaves or smth...
---
If someone ingame reports him it will. Seen it happen plenty of times. It slaps a nice fat game ban text on their profile too
---
dead hard still bugs out.
---
Long beach best beach
---
Fair, but she DC'd because of that reasoning, in her mind "if I get camped" = DC
---
I never tea-bag just because even though you‚Äôre in the exit gate it‚Äôs still a cocky thing to do.
---
I'm a rank 1 killer so maybe I can help. I'd say or what I did was learn to play 1-3 killers very well they don't have to be the best killer's in the game. I play Ghostface and Michael. If you play your best killers, you increase your chances of atleast doing well.
---
Try not to stay in chase too long, if your chase takes you past a generator being worked on, ditch the chase and prevent them from doing the objective. Also ditch the chase if they just have a bunch of pallets coming up that are super safe or they are taking you far away from the objectives. 
---
One of the key things is knowing when to spread your damage and when to focus your hits. The more people you hit, the more people under pressure (people would rather be healed than injured and that makes it tense for them, more tense = more tense) but if you don't focus on killing people then the game will last too long and the gens will be done.
---
Something that improved my game allot was able to mindgame properly and predict the survivors more. Countless time I've been at a unsafe pallet where they have Line of Sight (LoS) to me and a simple moonwalk or a moonwalk fake or whatever has enabled me to get a hit. Also, try not to telegraph what you're doing (don't make it obvious what you're gonna do) For example me and 2 survivors were at shack and the pallet was destroyed, I predicted that one of them was gonna go for the window and another was gonna maybe run away, so I faked that I was going for the guy running away and instead got the guy who went for the window through the window.
---
I still lose, I lose all the time, the games outcome depends more on survivor mistakes than killer skill. I try to play for fun, if I lose thats fine, I take my L and move on.
---
-Nurse
---
-Billy or spirit

---
Lmfaooooo! I read that in his voice
---
It's ok.
---
Me and the other Survivor opened the gate and already left.  I was watching it through the spectator mode.  These 2 decided to stay back to bully the killer.
---
. . . I feel personally attacked by this post. Hahaha xD
---
Oh i'm glad you remember!
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know it did that. TIL
---
Thank you very much!
---
He must have reached tier XII by the end
---
Sole survivor since I play solo and Bloodwarden because when I get the chance to use it, the looks on their faces are priceless.
---
I hate whispers tbh. Hate that stupid sound it makes when it's activated. I also don't think it's that good mid round. Great at the start and at the end but when the match gets going bbq and chilli is all you need.
---
I play on PS4 and that is an absurd statement.  I have zero issues working through Ruin because I got gud a long time ago.  Eat yo wheaties and practice them skillchecks son.
---
Dunno why either
---
Maybe it‚Äôs cause they realize a survivor has been down there and might actually be nearby?
---
Sometimes as trapper I go down the basement if I spawn near it and trap the chest
---
Only people with around 20% more brain than the people who have brains (that‚Äôs 120% brain necessary to notice my trap) end up noticing my chest-trap.
---
It‚Äôs a treasure I hold dear to my heart, to see it gone shakes me to my core
---
That was fucking awesome. Might sub to this guy since Tru3 has been moody lately
---
I did mention it, 5 stacks even with protection hits will likely only proc once per game even (especially) if all 4 survivors ran it. You're over valuing the unhooks which are finite. Most players have problems consistently getting 4 stacks for their WGLF as it forces you to play ultra altutistic (to the point of competing with other survs to get stacks) yet you think MoM would be broken even if it required more stacks to proc once.
---
Low ranks aren't good enough to survive that long to make the extra chase worth it, and high ranks people don't waste that much time healing to grind stacks. The only time it could be used to a broken degree is mid-rank SWF if the killer can't deal with altruistic zerglings.
---
&gt; the Killer stares at her in disbelief that she's suiciding on first hook.
---
yes that's clearly what's going on.
---
Glad I could help! :-) Also that's another thing, since survivors can't see generators, they will often accidentally "three-gen" themselves, aka screw themselves by having the last three gens near each other. However, if you find one that's been worked on, don't assume they will continue to work on it or stay nearby -- keep checking the other two gens. Survivors also know about the three-gen problem and will try to distract you with one gen while they finish another.
---
One last tip while I'm at it -- get very good at listening for the hatch. Memorize the hatch sound. This is the single best way to find it in a last-survivor race, as its sound is completely unique and pretty damn loud.
---
unless you are a nurse only player i recommend you watch scott jund's 'how to run generic tiles' video. its suprising how many purple rank killers and upwards dont know those simple routes

You're proposing a lobby dodging simulator.  Killers would simply break the lobby soon as they saw the swf tag.  It's not a good idea.
---
If you got a message of a killer "freak out" over the chest, they're just joking around. The basement belongs to the killer and is often in the killer shack (his home). Taking stuff from the basement chest means breaking in and taking his stuff. ;)
---
Canon dictates it should be Barb! As much as I love Steve it just makes more sense for it to be Barb.
---
This  would only work if he showed his butt crack. Lol
---
I was watching this stream when this happened, and closed it immediately after lol. Never seen someone freak out so much over a grab.
---
I heard spine chill doesn't effect your vaults anymore.
---
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE THE WRAITH (WHO WAS STILL VISIBLE) HAD TO STEP THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY SO SHE COULD PULL ME OFF.  THAT'S HOW FAST SHE DID IT.  THEN HE JUST SMACKED US BOTH AND WE DIED.  GREAT JOB, MEG.
---
It‚Äôs also a trophy whenever you loot it so many times in the PS4
---
What really grinds my gears is when people wait for the match to load in THEN disconnect, that way it doesn't cancel the match.

Happened to me 3 times in a row last night...

Survivor: Spine Chill is a must have for me playing survivor, really useful overall and especially useful against ghost face, spirit, pig

Self-care, balanced landing, borrowed time, urban evasion, &amp; deliverance are some others i use

killer: hex ruin
---
I can hit greats but what if my team can't? Should I not go looking for the totem?

Don't mention it
---
It's just the worst when you come home from a long day of work and you thought it would be a good idea to play some killer. Trust me, it's not a good idea.

that was the point to make it harder to find out were they are b4 they show sort of like a small buff for killers since everybody uses gaming headsets
---
When they tea bag at the exit i leave to go make a sandwich or something waste their time good enough
---
As a killer I love self care, if I find a survivor running it I'll leave him live longer since he is bound to waste time every single time I hit him. I know  they'll run to the corner of the map, or to a popped generator, and waste 32 seconds that I will use to find and kill another survivor doing something that prevents me from winning, and if they try to self care near me or in an area I'm patrolling their whimpers of pain let me know their location.
---
As a survivor on the other hand... Let's just say I've lost count how many times I have entered into struggle state because my team mate was self caring  before rescuing me from the hook.

i love you... i donno if you are a man or a women but will you marry me?

Do you understand what ‚Äúdirectional‚Äù means? They made the Lullaby ‚Äúnon-directional‚Äù which means you cannot tell where Freddy is coming from. It‚Äôs a 2D sound that just gets louder the closer he is. They didn‚Äôt touch the hearbeat.
---
THAT SOUNDS REALLY FUN
---
Damn that‚Äôs a brain play, how much brain you got?
---
That will happen when you go bar hopping!

FUCK YOU DUDE ITS FUN YOU SHOULD TRY IT

wow, lucky. Today I had to DC because my game was running at 5 fps then in a later game a Nea told be Micheal was OP because Tier 3 makes him move really fast.

Why would you dc to a ghostface?

Perfectly balanced
---
I would dc
---
I like to be somewhat flexible in DbD, so I love being chased but I've no issue with helping and healing others as long as I know they'd do the same for me, plus I know getting gens is important, hence why I run the perks. 
---
Obviously Self Caring at only -8% speed can be damn near game changing in clutch moments too.
---
Apparently going back to the hook is proxy camping. If you were playing properly they should be able to SC at the hook in peace. You can‚Äôt make this shit up.

It‚Äôs a good thing lore isn‚Äôt really a strong point for DBD. Assuming a stranger things chapter does arrive they‚Äôre obviously gonna pick an iconic character to be a survivor, and barb is most definitely not an iconic character.
---
Steve or Hop make the most sense.
---
Wish there more like you, sadly it's rare..
---
Honestly though this game makes my friends more toxic
---
I thought that they didnt want to do "other than human" characters because it wouldnt fit with the lore that the entities bring "people" in to itself to become killers or survivors.
---
DI MOOOOLTO
---
I mean I still remember all of the memes and petition to write her character back in. Just because she didn‚Äôt resonate with you personally doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt iconic in her own right.

I can finally show those toxic survivors what for!

This happened to me in kyf lmao

Why monitor and abuse?

YESTERDAY I HAD TWO NEARLY BACK TO BACK GAMES WHERE THERE WAS 1 GENERATOR LEFT WITH 3 SURVIVORS STILL ALIVE AND THE OTHER TWO TOOK THE HATCH WITH A KEY IN BOTH GAMES LEAVING ME BEHIND. I BARELY SURVIVED THE FIRST (EXIT GATES NEXT TO EACH OTHER AGAINST HILLBILLY) AND GOT MORIED IN THE SECOND.
---
I'M SORRY BUT THIS IS HILARIOUS
---
I got 3 Laurie dailies the other day and I had to get her to a level with perks I could actually use to try to stay alive. So I had those dailies up for about 3 days.
---
have fun saboing hooks, I never get Jake dailies.
---
I understand what you are saying but I can't think of a single thing they could change to make Leatherface any good and keep his chainsaw his power. Billy was modeled to be Leatherface but now we have the actual Leatherface. Would people really be too upset to play Leatherface like Billy and have Billy do something more along the lines of what a Hillbilly would do? In most movies with crazy Hillbillies they hunt their victims down and toy with them. Leatherface straight runs after people with his chainsaw. I don't know. It was just a thought. BHVR doesn't do suggestions anyway.
---
welp... i just got online rejected oof
---
atleast i tried my best haha
---
 
---
Great artwork tho keep up the jojo x dbd üëç
---
This doesn't make sense because swf's are in an external chat, example discord, which the game has nothing to do with.
---
You mean P3 claudette and No0b3/DemiPlays
---
Myers and ghostface definitely do not have similar play styles, that‚Äôs why a lot of people seem to think he‚Äôs weak, they try and play him like Myers.
---
Ghostface definitely has the potential to be stronger, he‚Äôs very skill dependent and requires map knowledge due to his power.
---
Overall I‚Äôd say that Myers is consistently more powerful, but ghostface when played by someone skilled enough is way stronger.
---
Or just get better with your killer mains and quit complaining about survivors with mics.  Take the bad with the good.
---
They‚Äôre just memes though, barb was around for like two episodes. The average audience member doesn‚Äôt even remember barb, she‚Äôs far from iconic.
---
Sorry dude better luck next time üòîü§ô Thanks!
---
I could've sworn it was better back in the day... probably why then.
---
Tbh the third seal is actually useful tho
---
Just let go of the gen if you hit a good skill check on PS4, then get back on it.
---
and that's how the cycle begins.
---
My pussy tingles.
---
I mean, you shouldn't be just standing around hoping to "stay close" to the hook to get the save attempt barring some massive red flags from the Survivors.
---
I mean, Proxy Camping isn't really a thing. Are there generators to patrol nearby? Can you smack a pallet? Do you have a reason to suspect that someone is nearby (BBQ)? Checking Lockers? If you're doing these things, you're not actually camping, you just haven't left the area. That's still the Survivor's fault for charging in prior to you leaving.
---
I mean, using your definition, 3-genning is Proxy Camping since the Killer is never too far away from the Hook. That's just not the case.
---
I used to be a Freddy main until they reworked him. I sort of wish they buffed him the way he was before instead of just completely changing him.
---
