They added Bill, so it was only a matter of time before the infected followed.

Pffft, wish I had your problems. Only thing I ever find when opening anything are Dwights...

---
Could barely see the embers.
---
But what does the Infection do?
---
Chris with the urban evasion
---
Ok
---
Well it's not really going to slow Gen progress that much as it's 3 Gens out of 7 being locked for a while.
---
They did confirm on the stream that the plague has 115% speed!
---
Maybe lighten up a bit?
---
This is adorable
---
Raise your dongers!
---
Watch Jane be the Tracer of DBD and have her ass get nerfed, its gonna happen 
---
Ok???
---
Isn't that wraith lol
---
Don’t both sides have made up rules? Is it hard for you to look up/down or at walls lol? 
---
Where did I say it lasts 15 seconds? I said it takes 15 seconds to run somewhere else.
---
I’m actually 50/50. Got “tryhard” and “you’re mom gay” for negative, 
---

---
 “+rep good no blink nurse” and “amazing killer.” For positive
---
Course... the positive posts are from me letting someone get the hatch and only getting one kill meming a no blink nurse.
---
I feel like the killer can just as easily bait you jumping out of the locker with the Perk and then just smack you then.
---
People often use DH in bad situations due to a lack of good situations to use it in. 
---
The major issue with DH is that to use it well you have little to no control of when you will need to use it. Because of this it’s almost impossible to set yourself up to use the perk to gain a few seconds towards a continued loop, which is it’s only use. All 3 of the other perks can do this with higher reliability to DH. 
---
I also would not call monto one of the best survivors. He plays significantly better at killer and hardly seems to give a shit in survivor games which makes it pretty tough to say if he’s good or not. And zubat prefers BL if I remember correctly. 
---
Lithes main problem is how broken the chase mechanic can be, I’m unsure of why you would want to use it out of a chase so I’m assuming you were only talking about specific cases such as when chase music cuts out at bizarre moments. If that’s the case it’s not the perk, it’s the game. 
---
I fuckin knew she was the killer
---
I can imagine she throws up in their mouth/body and they panic before they die. I can assume something like Reptile in MK, but without the gore. 
---
I play Jeff cause I mean my guy is basically looks like Jesus and the ugly sweater u can get is life
---
Because I wanted to go into the chapter in PBE blind. I know who the survivor is and what the killer is since no one takes people like me or console players into consideration but there are still people who don’t know and don’t want to know yet.
---
B for the effort
---
His username checks out
---
I can see it being some progression or combination of Broken+Jump Rope+Madness+Begrimed Chains. If Corruption Purge lets you injure then she'll join Huntress as the only killer that can telegraph hits.
---
Facts. The new killer trailer is full of people shitting on Legion. Like, why?
---
It's all on who can exploit the game the most. And its already in the killers favor because they can camp and kill us. I just wish it didnt cause survs to depip. I'm almost down 2 ranks from being camped all day. Such fun!
---
Probably, I dont expect anyone to play a certain way. But I'm not going to be toxic unless someone else is first. Yea it kind of is when you can't move the camera.
---
Might have something in mind for a different map. You can call it lazy, but their map balance is generally poor. I'd rather we get maps like this if it means entirely new ones aren't broken.
---
The new Killer might be good. Her power buys her time and seems to shut down loops (key words being "seems to"). I'm really curious about Corrupt Intervention. If the perks shuts down 3 gens for 30 seconds or more than it might replace Ruin as the go-to perk to slow them down. 
---
Im sure she will be top
---
My favorite streamer doesn't. BBQ, Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn, and Ruin.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/390060081 
---
Video from last night's stream, she typically wins. The last game in the block was a fun one to watch where she fell in love with an Ace.
---
Then you might want to avoid the sub? They’re releasing official trailer and had the stream etc. These things aren’t secret. 
---
I do get it. Wasting time at the beginning of the game means nothing. There’s not even a totem for survivors to need to run around to look for it’s just waiting till the entity block goes away. I’ve never used haunted grounds so I imagine it would be something like that where survivors won’t show themselves and just urban evade around until the time is up. I have used Myers before and survivors just hide until my tier 3 goes away. So I imagine it’ll be like that but to a worse effect. Because if you don’t manage to find a survivor in that time period.. which there’s a decent chance you won’t especially with swf, then it’s a waste of a perk
---
head on literally just makes lockers a viable hiding spot, you never use lockers before to hide because you open yourself up to be one shot, but with this you're not gonna get a locker grab lol
---
Head on, Quick and quiet, dance with me. What more do you need? 
---
They did both.
---
Im hoping we'll get a licensed killer next as-well, would love Ghostface or Jack from the Shining.
---
Then keep scrolling? 
---
Im glad to hear it! I'll be watching for a sale coming up! 
---
Yes, I’m the one who should keep scrolling 
---
I dont really like farming. If the hatch is open then ill just let you go for it. If its not then dead man walking
---
I'm not bitching about anything. I'm amused.
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
Duh
---
This is correct, what the Devs said. 
---
I find thanatophobia to be a good perk to use on Legion. You definitely get your use out of it, even if it's not very much. It's pretty consistent too, so that plus Ruin will give you plenty of time to kil everyone.
---
If Nea gains a terror radius will she evolve into The Bee?
---
LMAOOOOOOO STOP IT!
---
It hurts so good
---
?
---
I didn't know I had that option. Thanks for letting me know! 
---
Very true 
---
When you said Shirtless David Flair I thought of...
---
https://ringthedamnbell.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/david_flair_14.jpg
---
They’re so weak compared to before that anytime a survivor gets a flashlight save on me I can just completely admit that I fucked instead of saying ‘That’s BS or some other form of complaining’
---
I’m talking about when picking up a survivor + you can just listen to where they were running 
---
You're getting downvoted because your opinion is bad and wrong and if even one person followed your advice it would be detrimental to the community.
---
Maybe these survivors are a little...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Toxic? 
---
I wasnt complaining? I'm saying it's funny they accused me of playing to ruin other peoples days when they bring a tool to do exactly that. Also it's based on the survivor messing up to avoid a flashlight. Not the killer.
---
I would second that. The hum is always treated separately from the terror radius 
---
Thank god we have you to complain about the complainers. 
---
Also, it's just a killer completing their objective in a video game
---
The problem is that perks always need something scalable for tier 1, 2 and 3. If anything, the timer will stay and the exhausting gets removed, which would make it balanced I think.
---
Isn’t it Claudette but not the one playable,the one exclusive for the trailer?
---
Understood 
---
You can't move the camera while picking up a survivor either though.
---
[removed]
---
I fucking *love* this reference.
---
We dont know if the killer is even Babylonian.  They used it as a time frame reference, not a location.
---
Getting people of the gens buy racing with Billy across the map. Might be better than ruin.
---
I feel I'm to blame for this &gt;-&gt; on the occasion I just stand in front of my ruin and force people to work through it
---
Every single survivor had an exhaustion perk, insta heal add on, self care, DS, adrenaline, and the killer had too many crutches????
---
I play survivor too
---
I see more people do trash against legion in rank 15 than red ranks
---
  
---
Only the bad survivors in my games can't play against Legion
---
~~or me because i want to stare at his ass all game~~
---
Definitely! Seeing a curvier female survivor made me insanely excited. She looks incredible!
---
Exactly there is no recourse. Its just welp gueds im going down cause I couldnt do the same window juke for times. Or because he has 4 more attempts to stab me during his frenzy.
---
James Small confirmed for DBD dev.

It's a "gender neutral" version of latino/Latina that people who dont speak spanish invented.

Best T-Bag 2019
---
The meme economy is looking great 
---
Lmao it’s moments like this that make this game so fun!
---
In which case that was on the survivor. They made a mistake. And in that case you literally wasted an entire chase in a game where the killer is already on a time crunch.
---
The killer stands in the middle of the stairs, you can't squeeze past him due to his hitbox. Some toxic survivors will do this to their teammates as well.
---
Body block on the stairs and don’t hit/down survivors
---
Amazing boobs wow looking promising 
---
Somewhere in the distance, a Dwight main squeals in joy 
---

---
I’m like 90% sure it’s from a gay porno lmao
---
Booty so thicc each tbag makes the map quake
---
YES THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THEY SHOWED HER CHARACTER I thought it was only me
---
Ah, I see. Finally giving Nea her Terror Radius through Dark Devotion?
---
So.... she barfs on you.... they drink the water and barf it up... then she drinks THAT barf... and her barf gets stronger... 
---
Survivor and killer hitboxes collide with each other, so they can't go through each other.
---
While on the basement stairs, if a killer stands in the middle of the staircase there is not enough room on either side of the killer to let survivors walk next to them. So because they can not pass through or next to the killer, they are locked in the basement.
---
3 seconds
---
I don’t get this and I don’t want to tbh
---
I'd throw so much money at the screen.
---
Killers have collision. So when I went to save in the basement he stood at the stairs to stop us from getting by.. 
---
No it heals you for 50% of your progress bar while you heal someone else. No speed boost
---
It was so obviously a joke man. 
---
But seriously I don’t agree. It should remain puzzling to how many are left. Need to keep some wonderment and spice in the game, it’s getting too easy. 
---
I do stop playing when its a Legion. I leave the match and search for a new one. Stop acting like ignoring a problem is a solution to it, its so moronic. “JUST STOP PLAYING BRO!”
---
Still going?
---
Yup.
---
Right here. 
---
Legion does what now? 
---
Our Dwight church has evolved it is nice to know that Mr. PrettyGoodJobSoFar cares about the gods of dead by daylight
---
I thought the DS changes are coming with the new chapter? afaik it isn't live yet
---
Really this is not a spoiler. The developers have announced this information, its not been data mined or found out through other means. Besides knowing what a killer does, and playing against/with them are two completely different things. This time around they are trying a new way to go over the next chapter, and I like it. Its informative (like knowing the killer moves at 115%), and they kind giving a few pointers like how her power can interact with different objects. Other than that really strategy is left up to the player.
---
I think he knows it's not the name of the map. Saying the location names instead gives more variety.
---
Prestige 3 pig with lvl 50+ no bbq
---
Wouldn't that be counter productive though?  As they need to be in the TR for you to see them with  killer instinct 
---
It was me and a Claud. She was playing locker roulette to entertain herself. After 42 minutes, he messaged me to make a deal. I die and the Claud I’m with survives. I agree. Let myself get hooked, waited until Claud and the Wraith were well away, used my deliverance. He was mighty salty in the messages lmao
---
Fate has made sure that they could never work together
---
thats actually incredibly sad
---
so guess it wont be a thing for long anymore
---
Nah tried that and it didn’t.
---
Anti-hemorrhagic syringes give you immunity to the power lol
---
Lither first, it's not the fact about it notbactivating in chases, it's the fact it actively hinders looping in certain as it gets wasted the first time you vault, making it impossible to run jungle gyms, t-l walls, and the shack to their full potential. I really dont know how you can say there's a lack of situations to use dead hard in, there are so many pallets and windows on nearly every map that if you know where they are you can almost always use dead hard near them. The main thing is most survivors at rank 1 are awful and just run urban and sprint burst and can't loop for shit, so the instant they try dead hard they can't use it well. I can literally link you multiple different times I use dead hard in every game I play. In my opinion Monto is a very good survivor, he simply doesnt play solo that often, and runs weird builds when he does. The fact that he can still run killers well without exhaustion perks speaks wonders.
---
I'm gonna be really mad now if I don't see these on this sub
---
Heard a theory the accident that happened in Adam’s train cart was the same accident that got Rin’s dad fired
---
What is happening omfg
---
And that matters why?
---
*Dwigh-sive strike
---
Holy shit he drew references lol well done 
---
She deserves a name like Bertha or something.  She seems athletic, Big Bertha takes down her enemies.
---
We don't know dark devotion duration, if it removed the killers strain for the duration it would be really good.
---
Infectious would be useful against those loving flashlight saves.
---
Corrupt could be very strong on some maps, where the gens are completely on different sides of the map, you'd lock down one side, and maybe catch some survivors trying to run your direction.
---
Solidarity seems cool.
---
Poised:  I've many many many times fixed gens and the killers come my direction, so it could be very useful in securing a escape.
---
Head on: Locker jukes could be much safer really with this. But it being an exhaustion perk limits it. You couldn't obviously use it with sprint burst.
---
That doesn’t look like the Scooby Doo trailer I was looking for
---
Bugfixing and optimization are much more time consuming than art. I mean yeah, It takes a lot of time to create a good art, but drawing new lines does not change lines you've already drawn. Plus you have more or less clear idea ahead of you. So, it's more or less straightforward process until you are satisfied. 
---
With debugging if you aren't careful enough (try to save some time, mess with stuff that someone else had created, try to optimize things ahead of time, etc), you can create several problems by solving one. And it's not like you always know what exactly to fix. You often have to just look for "something that is not working as it should". Plus adding new people is not always a good choice because a new person will have to waste time learning how stuff works and if they get a wrong idea, they can make things even worse. 
---
What is it with people on here and refusing to acknowledge legion's bullshit? I swear you are so bad at this game that you can only win with legion so you feel good playing a bullshit killer that causes people to leave/suicide half the time.
---
That's the worst part about legion, causes absolutely shit players to think they're decent.
---
...hrrrrnngg...
---
Clown base power has hindered included in the gas 
---
Or running it on Wraith and his cloaking. Imagine going in and out of cloak giving and taking your terror radius from a survivor. They'll never know when they're safe.
---
Afterpiece tonic always hinders, there’s an add on that adds an extra hindered
---
There’s only been 2 chapters that had either both males or both females, I’d say it’s pretty even.
---
Your face is a billy I’m finna board!
---
I won't lie. I laughed for a solid minute or two after reading this reply. 
---
Plot twist: the killers and survivors are all part of the same Joestar-esque bloodline and the entity is just funny valentine.
---
Poised seems mega useless, though otherwise the perks sounds pretty fun and cool.
---
Me too. Such a good perk. 
---
I think legion is fun to play. I also don't see what the huge problem is with him. If survivors don't group up he's easy to beat so what's not fun. The counterplay is just time your pallets. It's just a slightly worse nurse with better awareness
---
This is actual art, thanks for the laughs.
---
That's because if you CAN loop infinite the survivors always wins. If you have to choose one side to always win in a chase it needs to be killer. If it isn't the killer, then they have no pressure beyond the top 3 (Billy Nurse Spirit) and the others don't matter at all. You can still Decisive but only within a minute of unhooking. That's fair, that's balanced. Your argument is literally survivor entitlement.
---
Doubtful, you'd heal your target and yourself faster, but its still only 50% you'd have. Autodidact probably going over the top
---
I have no experience using or identifying lagswitches, so, idk. Is your Wi-Fi good?

I’m used to being able to hit those skill checks, but it was a pleasant surprise to see multiple gens popping in my last game. 
---
You heal normally, but if you heal them from empty to full, and you were also empty when you started, you'd be recovered by 50%.
---
So you are calling me gay? Very immature...
---
It's odd you take offence to me not wanting to see someone shirtless, so I'm going to have to have to...
---
NO U!
---
also some bad news for u...
---
Newsflash: It's been researched that people who state things have been researched enjoy eating horse poop. So why would they need to continue to do research when you already eating all the horse pooopy? That's why your obsessed with the whole "research" spiel.
---
And you ruined the new survivor for me 😔
---
just a little bit
---
Hm. Yeah you're right. Last time we got a male-on-male chapter was Freddy and Quentin.
---
You are insane lmao. How'd it end?
---
Dude how unoriginal can you get.  You reposted the image and just mirrored it.
---
My best bet you just heal normally, but gives whatever percentage of healing you give someone else to yourself.
---
 So if you have "We'll Make it" on, you'll be healing 100% faster.  That means you'll heal the other person faster but also heal yourself faster as well.  They said its a conversation rate, so you just gain 50% of whatever you heal someone else, i doubt speed plays a factor in how much you heal, just how fast.
---
Did u escape
---
Most wraiths are 
---
With him threatening to report me, as ironic as that is. Said I don’t keep to deals. Which, duh. When given the opportunity to actually make use of the niche deliverance perk AND stick it to a basement camper? Of course I’m going to lie and say I’ll die so long as you let the other survivor go lol
---
Art art art art art art art; did somebody mention art!?
---
Only when people start being more original.
---
I'm glad to see the joystick is xbox 🙂
---
It can be stacked with DS.
---
I dont want you banned from reddit. Say whatever words you want wherever but disconnecting every time you get a killer you dont like deserves banning. I thought by saying "stop ruining games" that was pretty common sense. Apparently not. How can a killer "circumvent all obstacles" yet be so "slow at getting kills"? If they can easily get all gens done by the time the killer gets 1-2 hooks then how is that a problem? Would you rather they reliably down everyone before they can be finished? I play legion and I have fun. I play survivor and cant stand doctor or freddy yet I dont disconnect because it's a childish thing to do. "No I dont want YOU to kill me I want somebody else to kill me!" 
---
+100 if the next post is a gif. Especially if Amanda seems to not be getting it and Mikey gets frustrated 
---
Yes that is true. I also don't go swimming. I am concerned that I will be attacked by the massive gay. FYI, I don't change my shirt to prevent the gay. When my shirt begins wearing out I put on a new one. The kind rags underneath have kept me nice and warm this winter. 
---
It's a win win win would recommend. You can't be gay if you don't take your shirt off, it's snuggy snuggy warm in the winter, and you always have a seat to yourself on the bus prob because the gay repelling.

---
Ah shit gg lol. I was like man they're pretty good. Now this makes sense.
---
This is definitely lag switch
---
Corrupt intervention counter.....everyone just hides in lockers at the start of the game until it expires. EZ
---
&gt; Its like 150% ***effective*** heal speed.
---
You're getting 150% total healing in the time it takes you to heal another player 100%.
---
Because most survivors are entitled losers who talk shit whether they win or lose.
---
Need audio of the song, and her stunning the plague right as he says someBODY
---
seriously where the fuck are my jeff lewds
---
Head On's going to be a meme perk at best, unless the killer is Doctor or maybe Huntress.
---
This is 100% a lag switch, bad wifi would still react to you getting hit but that instantly teleported you to a hook.
---
I think they meant the total of the healing you and your friends received. 100% for them, 50% for you, 150% in total.
---
Don’t do my girl Meg like that. 
---
They also said no clowns
---
I spent way longer playing Smite than I should have, but Nox really did have a good design.

that's nasty.

Rank 1 here, as a connoisseur of the game, I feel it is my absolute duty to inform the peasants here that:

2. noob NOED get gud

3. wAoW Decisive eat shit rank 2 scrublord  
---
^(/s)
---
That’s weird, either way the only good add ons are the chili add ons, the gas can, and the add ons that make your chainsaw rev up faster (the manual guide too)
---
No, I mean like Daisy Dukes or bloomers. Hip huggers would be nice to, or spandex™
---
Of course they're gonna be counters , do you want some OP shit? The devs are doing something at least
---
My main problem while starting dbd is that it's community loves to complain , man Come on,you know it's not some Ubisoft budget game let them be and what if they're used by high ranks players ? Majority of players are at mid ranks ,so I don't see a problem here 
---
I just saw the devs chat too , everyone either wrote OP or shit ! 
---
And people are complaining that it will break gameplay mechanics but even if it does you want the same old shit m1 killer ? Which runs around and get stunned ? Or do you want a killer who you're actually afraid to okay against
---
Wikia says that Calm Spirit suppresses the scream from Make Your Choice.  So I bet it will suppress the scream from Infectious Fright.
---
I could see it also suppressing the Vile Purge vomit effect.
---
Really? Because I play against plenty of people who survive just fine. The only ones who don't seem to be little whiners who want to be handed free points from BVHR instead of learning and adapting.
---
^(ngl I’d have sex with Joe but that’s probably because he looks 100% human and is only in this shitshow because his friend is a dick, plus the beard and face paint combo makes me w e a k)
---
Emetophobia probably 
---
What exactly is the plauge supposed to be baised on?
---
This is gonna be interesting, head on combined with the often ignored fast locker exit effect on dance with me could be a pretty controllable escape from a chase. Stun them with the locker and leave no tracks as you leave.
---
The doctor isn’t from World War II He is meant to be from the 60s I think
---
I'd bet that healing others buffs won't apply to the Solidarity's self heal.
---
&gt;How can a killer "circumvent all obstacles" yet be so "slow at getting kills"?
---
Those are 2 seperate things. Feral frenzy assures that no matter what you will get the hit. But on the side of things it will just take a ridiculous amount of time. Make more sense?
---
&gt;If they can easily get all gens done by the time the killer gets 1-2 hooks then how is that a problem? Would you rather they reliably down everyone before they can be finished?
---
Yup I would. Winning isn't everything. A fair close match is much more exciting. If a killer out plays me, props to them. You can't out play leigion **individually**. Therefore its really not impressive or exciting.
---
 &gt; I play legion and I have fun. I play survivor and cant stand doctor or freddy yet I dont disconnect because it's a childish thing to do. "No I dont want YOU to kill me I want somebody else to kill me!" 
---
Yeah thats called a prefrence. I dont like playing against clown not cause hes broken, but because I find his ability fustrating. Ruin is annoying to play against but I work through it. Leigion is a broken killer so I'd rather dc than play against him.
---
At the end of the day you can call it childish if you'd like. But if I dont want to waste my time against a leigion then I wont. I'm not obligated to play against a broken killer.
---
Dance with me works on fast locker vaults, it could be quite an effective pairing
---
Oh no oh no
---
Infectious Fright only benefits M1 killers, since they said it only applies if you down a survivor with your basic attack. So if we're limiting its use to M1 killers with oneshots, it'd be best on Myers (innately), followed by Plague (since a max sickness survivor is Broken, it ends up being similar). Adding in other perks, combining this with Distressing and either NoED or Haunted Ground would be absolutely terrifying on almost any killer.
---
Head On has some pretty good potential depending on the range. If it can reach far enough to cover most of the gap between the basement stair-wall and the left locker, the killer won't be able to hook in the basement if you're there.
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
like someone else said :: the entity takes people who have the POTENTIAL to kill, not just evil people.
---
the plague seems as though she had the potential to kill out of sympathy. so the entity took that potential and turned it sour and evil
---
No, i wanna leave. Please, not.. No not the longest fucking wagon ride ever please god
---
The longer you stay in the locker the longer the stun! - Probably some Dwight
---
I don' think it could be the "new" ruin per say but i could definitely see it being a good, more consistant alternative. Or you can use both if you really wanna say fuck you to gens
---
Leatherface has some of the most memey addons. He’s already a meme because his just a shitty hillbilly, so if you also use speed limiter with him you are a meme god. He is only surpassed in meme potential by MacMyers
---
No one escapes death ^Todd ^Howard
---
Might be praying?
---
Personal opinion-&gt; if a killer wants to troll real hard, they'll run ruin, discordance, new perk, and either overcharge or pigs perk (surveillance I think) just the ultimate gen protecting build which may slow the game down just a lil bit
---
Distressing, Infectious Fright, Haunted Ground, and BBQ on Nurse.
---
Once that hex pops, everybody in the area is going down.
---
I'm sorry but is this ochido?
---
The situations where Poised would be useful seem really narrow.  You'd have to pop a gen when the killer is approaching it and is in scratch range but hasn't gotten a visual on you yet.
---
Body Diversity? May I present to you the thickness that is the Clown.
---
Poised will be good with sprint birth in the race for the final gen. If yours is the last one and the killer’s approaching, easy get away with that perk. It’s like dance with me but less situational
---
You have to be in a locker for 3 seconds for the perk to activate at the moment, they may change that after PTB though
---
All praise fat Jesus!
---
\*vomits on The Nurse\*
---
Uh, excuse me. My skill checks are up here
---
god damn it todd you've done it again
---
That's how Reddit works
---
The counter to the plague :  Vaccines XD 
---
Stopped arguing my previous points I see. So now that we've established its a broken killer we can solve this in a few ways as a community.
---
- Bite bullet and play against and as a broken killer
---
- Or dc and shun a killer to send a message
---
Less killers will want to play as leigon and BHVR will be more aware of this killers status. So in a way I'd say im doing a good thing!
---
And in my experience most survivors would rather dc than play against a leigon.
---
I saw this on Instagram, RIP my dude. 
---
she’s further back in the image, also, “midget” is a rude term
---
but you said I dont show my shirt off because I hate the gay. so you are saying that girls dont take your shirt off because they are private, yet when i try to not take my shirt off I hate the gay
---
you have problem man
---
It doeant affect spped though. They clearly said that. It heals you halfway while you heal them. You heal them at the normal speed
---
I've seen the number 72 around a lot lately. Is that a meme I'm not picking up on?
---
What all does it do?
---
My friend told me few weeks ago that she was also disgusted by the sound of someone puking, so I was a bit surprised when I saw the new killer. She didn't seem that worried though, maybe try to watch some gameplay of Left 4 Dead 1 or 2, there are two (in the L4D2, only one in the 1) zombies that puke has their ability, so maybe watch some games to see if it will actually disturb you.
---
This subreddit never fails to be thirsty as fuck. 
---
I'm getting 500 Internal Server Error Code. Anyone got a mirror?
---
Thank you.
---
They feel more rare than ultra rare items/add ons 
---
lmao. me to your original comment as well. 
---
Even with one gen left sometimes it's the only option as the killer (if you want to secure a kill), especially as Legion who suffers so much at this point in the game.
---
And... She's Babylonian... REALLY WAY BACK
---
Grandfather Nurgle is pleased with the entities choice, he is working hard to stay chaos undeviated, let's see if it stays that way
---
Because why would I continue arguing? We havent established anything other than you have no issue ruining things for other people and in some warped way you think wasting peoples time helps them. I find no sense continuing a discussion with someone who sees that as perfectly fine. Its people like you that make this game ass to play.
---
I fucking HOPE
---
You said you'll tunnel any shirtless David because it's gay. Don't act dumb.
---
No one is forcing you to play shirtless David btw.
---
But wasnt one of his main points that Self Care isnt a crutch perk at all? i suppose i expected the points i was getting at were clear enough that the different definitions of crutch was a very far lesser point to the additive to all of my other points? Point is i believe a perk like Self Care hinders you from being efficient or experiencing the game and i gave my fair opinion why. Crucify me??
---
I love this so much
---
Another positive I just realized about the new killer: I get to live out all the fun of hurling on people without going back to being an alcoholic!!! &lt;3
---
Spreads faster than *the plague*
---
Eyyyyyy, *I wish I posted it on Reddit in time*
---
Sorry brudder. Want me to take it down?
---
I imagine it’s probably like 40/50/60 seconds 
---
I can only hope that Doctor can spread the madness like it's the plague.
---
Thats pretty ironic coming from a leigion main
---
Still not as rare ad a FUCKIN LERYS OFFERING ON MY MYERS
---
I know someone with actual, severe coulrophobia. They won't play survivor because of Clown, they would literally scream and punch their monitor or fall off their chair. This isn't exactly a new problem, just adding onto the list of phobias already in the game.
---
"Main" 😂
---
Hell nah dude. You can keep it up. Still get to see people's reaction to it so I'm happy.
---
Lol rip scratched mirror Myers 
---
Claudette flair makes this so much better
---
Totally agree. This perk would be really weak if it's anything less of a minute. And the whole "3 farthest generators" is reaaaallly vague.  I would think it would be kinda frivolous on larger maps.
---
Try restarting your console maybe?
---
I'm excited for this new survivor. 
---
You're acting like a real 72 with these questions dude
---
You’re kidding me right 
---
lol yeah, but i ment female survivors, they have pretty much the same proportions
---
1. Equip Head On
---
2. Get Hit
---
3. Use your injured speed boost to go into an obvious locker
---
4. Profit
---
People will spam "THICC" any time they see an ass. Doesnt matter how big it is. 
---
His name didn't happen to be "Face Camping Killer"..??
---
I wish they would add new maps to existing locations NOT as part of DLC. I feel like new DLC should come with new realms, and it shouldn't need DLC to add new maps.
---
Dead by daylight gonna get record players when she's released 
---
When do i get to blow them?
---
\*shrugs\* Yeah, but they're easier to sneak around with. It doesn't really matter, though, if you want to play her, great, if not, you don't even really need to play her to get her perks.
---
Mind explaining why it isn't in a game where two players have conflicting roles in a game?
---
Your so talented! Already making fanart of the plate even know she hasn’t even been released! 
---
And you're a 73.
---
You’re missing the point. Legion is one of if not the weakest killer in the game. The issue the “whiners” have with the killer isn’t that he’s overpowered and they don’t want to “adapt,” but rather there is no counterplay to his ability. You run away until he downs you, and that’s inevitable. You can’t hide because he sees all survivors once hitting someone. You can’t run because he vaults pallets and windows and moves faster than you. Compared to the Billy, one of the strongest killer in the game, who is actually fun to play against because there is counterplay in evading the chainsaw. 
---
Fake, nurse doesn’t walk
---
Don't worry. An optimization patch is coming out in December 2018, with minor patches leading up to it. Just be patient! 
---
As soon as behavior finalizes their masterpiece by adding the Speedo for David. 
---
No, I’m not going to share his name because I don’t want to get banned from the sub for witch-hunting or anything, but he was a genuine asshole, after I messaged him why facecamp? His response was because I stunned him with a pallet, and juked him. 
---
Eh, fuck it, longest time I played as killer, that shit sucks the fun out of it, that new perk though, the one that lets you pass along the terror radius, that's gonna be fucking hilarious.
---
Finishing the last gen and the killer immediately insta downs somebody with NOED
---
 As a killer main, the closet perk scares me lol
---
God forbid a survivor plays normally. 
---
If you're using 4 Hex perks there's 4 lit totems, unless you're using haunted then it'll be all 5. I think they thought you meant all 5 dulls.
---
You captured waluigi's chiseled face beautifully
---
did the killer dc?
---
Yeah looks like it. Maybe last day of shooting for the first movie?
---
And people have likely paid money to get the Legion, so I'm sure just deleting the entire fucking character won't have any backlash or repercussions whatsoever.
---
lul
---
No they didn't I also lost my medkit 
---
The new d-strike change my mind
---
I wish I knew what her power actually did. It said it grows and weakens the survivor but does that mean action speed or what?
---
"Escape" can also apply to losing the killer during a chase.
---
oh hey I just found her stream yesterday, made me want to try and get better at Huntress
---
What if it's a timer ? At every interval the gens are blocked ?
---
Because this is a first trapper Post I’ve seen in a while, may I share you a Trapper Build?
---
Pretty much. 
---
Intervention with Ruin , Overcharge and its going to be survivor salt everywhere. 
---
This is my worst birthday ever!
---
Why? because you mori'd ~~Oprah~~ Jane?
---
No, because it's a little humid - YES, IT'S BECAUSE I RAN OVER ~~OPRAH~~ JANE!
---
Got this today too blah 
---
Not sure what rank you’re playing and I personally disagree with “toxic” aka teabagging etc. 
---
But at rank 1, If you don’t mind game, you die. Flashlight saves are real and happen sometimes. In the past week I’ve been saved by at least 3/4, I’ve saved maybe 1/2 people with them. 
---
I’m not sure why you’re not seeing any of this. But I can assure you it definitely happens. 
---
Just yesterday I had at least 2 matches that actually made me laugh out loud while playing. 
---
Look at escape rates and then call the game 'balanced'. Get out of here with that comment.
---
My entire group has given up on PS4. Some of us took longer than others. One of my friends actually BOUGHT A PS4 just to play Dead by Daylight. This was back in July or so. He played every night until a few weeks ago. He said it was partly because the rest of the group gave up on the game, but we all stopped because we got tired of the frame drops. Both killer and survivor are absolutely miserable right now. I think he plays Overwatch now, but I'm not into shooters so we're all playing our own games at the moment. I'm trying to get them into Rocket League, but they keep giving up after a couple matches because of how unforgiving the playerbase is to new players. Before that was Fallout 76, and.... yeah. I don't need to go into detail as to why that only lasted a few days. 
---
Sucks because Dead by Daylight is a fun game, but it's just way too frustrating to lose games due to shit that's completely out of your control. Whether you're a killer completely missing a swing, or a survivor running into a wall after being hit due to the big frame drops, it's just not worth it anymore. Looking forward to that optimization patch last December. Oh wait, they meant PASS. Sometime this Spring... maybe? They stopped acknowledging it AGAIN, but oh look... new cosmetics and characters!!! Wow!!!!
---
Mama, mama, mama, *SPIT ON ME*
---
Yeah, as a killer main, id like to apologize in regards to some of the delusional killers on this game. 
---
Oof I misread you. Sorry about that! I heard someone else say that they thought the perk lasted 15 seconds and I thought you were saying the same thing. My bad.
---
Is that the new killer?
---
i play console so the skill checks are impossible imo, but i recently played a surv game against the wraith where he chased one survivor and us other three moved from gen to gen hitting those skill checks anyways. its the first game ive ever seen where it lasted ~5 min and ruin wasnt broken until the end, only because someone happened to see it while doing something else
---
Last camper I faced had Bloodwarden and NOED as their unused perks.
---
It really do be like that tho
---
*Sensually rubs hook to get nea off*
---
I actually have more than enough shards to buy Legion and Jeff. But even so, I feel like it'd be a waste of the shards when I can buy other cosmetics instead.
---
I'm buying this DLC though as I want the extra outfits. They better be good extra outfits and not just recolour like Jeff's shirt. 
---
I hope it’s the new meta. I’m so tired of Ruin and I’m sure survivors feel the same way.
---
It is an exhaustion perk 
---
well youd have to hit the obsession for it to work
---
What do you think this is, a video game where ethnicity doesn't matter in the slightest??
---
it’s a new pig add on, whenever you hit a survivor they stop existing 
---
Your point is?
---
The huntress lullaby and Freddy lullaby are treated different than their terror radius
---
Maybe i am, or maybe freddy is just garbage. Maybe both.
---
See you on top 
---
Look great! Love it 
---
Never said it’d be broken, just saying I feel it balances the loss of decisives previous strength. As I stated earlier, it all depends on how the runner strategizes. 
---
Wouldn't hope that tbh. I have her blocked on MLGA considering she runs nothing but instadown hatchets or exhaustion addons and camps in every single game me or my friends have played against her.
---
MYC makes you scream? I never noticed! Then yeah that should definitely work for consistency.
---
That fucking chin though. she looks like Wonder Woman from Injustice with better graphics on dude wtf. It’s so... fat? Sharp? Strong? I dunno what it is I can’t pinpoint it
---
It’s pretty true but we love a tough lady!! 
---
You can always tell when the survivor is a new player making suggestions.
---
Depending on the stun timer Head on sounds really damn good and it’s gonna be useful for chases and make lockers viable as a hiding spot. Good perk.
---
Steam goes down when that happens
---
He’s right, it’s lazy 
---
Why would you pair it with Self Care if there's another person right there in front of you? They might as well heal you faster, and faster still with Leader. 
---
small game...
---
It would be cool, but since current perks don't effect hum radius, I doubt it would transfer the hum :( 
---
If you get three crows and then stun it instantly disconnects the killer
---
Enduring killers:
---
**This looks like a job for me**
---
Nope just within range. Would work in tight hallways or certain loops
---
The issue with many dlc perks is that they either:
---
1. Have the same use as other perks that already exist but are worse or more situational
---
2. They are only useful for certain playstyles that are sub-optimal in the current meta
---
Talking about counter-playing a perk to justify a build not being broken killer sided is pretty much what you said.
---
he has a crush on you but too shy to say hello probably so he stares at you from afar
---
same, but the snow in legion Map gives me lag
---
Its not indoors. Its a Red Forest map
---
Well that seems more than a little abusable. 
---
Like a Latin Oprah
---
r/JustClownProblems
---
YES
---
If that's the case, I would be fine. 
---
I'm just waiting for the Oprah bee gif with the new survivor.
---
That sick bastard finally got to kiss his sister, home sweet Alabama.
---
This is great
---
Happened to me a lot. I smack a survivor and it instantly ends the game and says entity displeased. Weirdly though, it never happened to me as a survivor 
---
Her weapon is weird lol
---
I would like it more if she did an overhead bash with it.
---

---
no
---
Username checks out
---
BHVR have advised to not mess with the game files because they won't be held responsible for what EAC does so I'm unsure what their response will be.
---
Hopefully they get back to you soon and it's positive.
---
Good, good, now go take a nap, you'll feel ~~deader~~ better in the morning. 
---
Yes I’m dumb and can look at a legitimate statistic and realize that anything not close to 50/50 is not balanced. I think I need to go back to high school for a remedial class.
---
Killer looks like they actually put some time and effort into this one. Same with the survivor! Can’t wait!
---
Alright.

Calm Spirit, go

Spawning Next To Ruin Is The Best &amp; Worst Feeling In The World As A Killer Main As I Know The Pain That I Will Inflict
---
Nope. I'm still waiting 2 years down the track. I emailed recently and they basically said soon, but it's not a top priority.
---
Personally I have no idea what's so difficult about providing an image file that's already pre-existing in the game.
---
Seems super odd that they'd do that. I've modified my perks and character portraits as well as capped my fps multiple times and haven't gotten banned in my 1200 hours. I hope that gets undone cause that's bs. 
---
They should make their game not run like a piece of shit then, on an i5 6600k at 4.2 ghz and a r9 290x playing at 60 fps with vsync is actually aids.
---
DansGame
---
Her \*cough\* \*cough\* Growth, Occurred Elsewhere. 
---
Can I use this for a meme?
---
They better put it somewhere else than our main stash.
---
It seems. The devs said in play test it’s a harder to get off perk than it seems by the description. It also has a cool down probably of like a minute
---
The survivor will be revealed when they are trying to sneak around or doing a gen far from the hooked survivor. Meaning you gotta stop what your doing,pretend to move towards a different direction, wait 4 seconds, then move back to your original objective (which tbh if you were caught standing next to the gen it really isn't much a bamboozle). Just a personal dislike. Probably should of put something like Thanatophobia instead.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Go for it 
---
So it's on me to stand there and watch him just do gens in front of me while I wait patiently? He should blame teammates for DC'ing, not the killer that doesn't want to farm.
---
Statistic don't mean anything unless you have context. Good survivor teams will win the game 100 times out of 100.
---
This isn't very uncommon.
---
I don't use ruin, and I won't until totems are as hard to find as Claudette, so if you chase 1 survivor, 3 can do a gen before you can stop them. Unless you have ruin or are nurse. 
---
It's just a matter of how well you can do in that situation. 
---
it's the first killer that actually talks oh 
---
So BHVR said don’t fuck with the files because if you do, EAC might ban you.
---
You fucked with the files. EAC banned you. No one will, or should, help you with this. It also doesn’t say that’s why you were banned- so I’m going with you’re cheating scum.
---
Bye, in other words, and thank fuck you’re gone.

"Pallet looping"

I guess I'll just put myself on the hook then.

ive done this, i just go and hook myself afterwards.
---
Now Imagine all of theses beauties with head on...
---
Did you even read the context? I did this months before they even said that.
---
Credit to u/DependantIndividual for the image
---
but you just said women dont do it because they are private, and men dont because they are homophobe, and that because I dont want to look at a shirtless sguy I am homophobe. 
---
Lmao
---
While Billy's power is better in the long run, one of the reasons I love Clown so much is because one of his add-ons can deal with 30% of this team's loadout. Not counting DS and Enduring or the insta-heals. They'd burn through their DS and medkits pretty early on with my Clown build. This would still hurt to see if I was the Killer though.
---
Infectious Fright is going to be big. Head On also sounds like it's gonna be adding another logical, effective mechanic, but boy will it be annoying (I play killer).
---
Bruh, like how bad are you? Cuz you’re no red rank. Not only do I main survivor but I work with one of the the former biggest killer mains that 4ks more than not that doesn’t get along with angrypug
---
Ok, so I'm fairly new. Got to red ranks with Myers, and I'm constantly getting gen rushed. I don't use NOED, because why bother with it on Michael, so I use Ruin to slow the start of the game down just a little bit so I can get my one hook and reach Tier 2. But I also use Ruin so that the survivors will take 1 minute to look for a bright, glowing totem to destroy, which they usually get spawned 5 feet from.
---
But due to Michael's slower starting speed and my current lack of perk options, I really feel like the gen rushing tactic just makes the game super dull for me. Bonus points if two people are running D Strike and body block me while I try to hook someone for the first time.
---
But does anyone else think gen rushing needs to be looked at by the devs? I understand the annoyance of Ruin, but survivors need to understand the drag that is gen rushing when you're dealing with a premade survivor team all communicating on Discord. Sorry, that ended up being ranty. I'm just getting tired of getting gen rushed.
---
When the killer is looking in you're direction from 32 meters away perk activates, you get an increased action speed, skill check chance, and decreased skill check zones. Mostly a different premonition where you know the killer is coming but not from where, but action speed does help you vault faster too. 
---
She prefers "pro-plague."
---
Um
---
I like Interesting tidbits of info like this. 
---
It’s none of those things, if you just go and read the description of it... you just walk in the locker and after 3 seconds inside it’s ready to use. Nothing about terror radius or anything else.
---
Depends how it works, I assume it is a large hitbox that triggers as soon as they pop out so there isn't much chance for a grab or lunge. But we'll probably see the same hit through a stun like pallets.
---
But I assume it will be as long as a normal stun and the survivor will have plenty of time to find a loop to wait out the timer for iron maiden, assuming you aren't a nurse that can just turn around and blink hit.
---
Or Myers with the John Carpenter themed TR it would be nasty too. 
---
I actually just tunneled him while letting the other survivors escape. When they asked why Is aid he looked cold and wanted him to be at the camp fire after. The other survivors thanked me for doing Gods work. 
---
and actually girls did used to be shirtless back then and still are in some societies. Like 4th world kinda idea Warmer countries.... so....
---
Also I don't think me killing a shirtless guy in a video game makes me a homophobe. 
---
Here, this will make you feel better. 8=======D~~~~~
---
What I don’t understand is why they don’t just accept defeat since no ones perfect you’ll lose some and win some
---
So its base use works against everyone except for T1 Myers. But it has valuable gameplay nullification for all stealth killers because I no longer rely on the heartbeat to tell when they're coming, especially if I'm around a corner. I know seconds before the heartbeat even appears in most cases. I know when to leave a dangerous situation (Spine Chill is lit persistently) vs. when the killer is in the area but not coming to me (it flickers). I also use the bonus speed action when someone else is being chased and the Killer looks in my direction but doesn't go after me.
---
Wraith/Pig/Spirit. I can tell they're heading in my direction or in my general area, so I'm never caught by surprise attacks. You can hear Wraith stomp if he's close enough, but I've used this to palette slam him. I've never been pulled off of a generator by a Spirit with or without Prayer beads because her spirit plane morph doesn't escape Spine Chill. T2 Myers has a reduced terror radius but I still get the full benefits of Spine Chill against him at 32m.
---
For Freddy, Spine Chill has two bonuses against him: (1) localizing him and telling whether or not he's chasing me vs. passing through the area and (2) if you're asleep and trying to snap out of the dream world, when Freddy is approaching you, you will have higher odds of triggering skill checks with smaller windows. He'd have to put you to sleep again and then chase you. It effectively buys you a lot of time.
---
Spine Chill also has some slight counterplay against Billy, Nurse, and Huntress because their powers are based on directionality. It's not as effective against them as it is other killers, but any bit helps. Huntress can't hit me from a distance unless she's facing me and if I'm outside of the Spine Chill cone, then she is isn't facing me well enough to scope me.
---
I also use it against people who run Monitor and Abuse or BBQ&amp;Chilli. The first because, again, I don't rely on heartbeat/terror radius. As for BBQ &amp; Chilli, I can tell when a Killer has it much sooner than my party usually if the killer runs towards me immediately post hook. I know this because the counterplay to BBQ&amp;Chilli is to run into a direction and then switch after 4 seconds, so when a killer gets confused and looks around upon not seeing the survivor whose aura they detected, Spine Chill will flicker.
---
It is by no means a meta perk because you don't "need" it, but I find that it's indispensable.
---

If you are fully sick you enter broken I think

so you just leave someone on the hook there?

You mean like every shit tier salty survivor who runs DS/DH/Purple Flashlight, gets caught, then ragequits?
---
The generator in my mind explodes from shared sentiment.
---
Since he's in the sky now, I'm guessing Kira already activated Bites the Dust on him, right? Lmao
---
It might still change to though 
---
Ragequitting survivors are also a problem. But that doesn't deny the killer all of their bloodpoints from a match.

The majority of video game players are casuals, how casual players play has nothing to do with the actual balance of the game. This is why your stats aren't the be all end all for the balance discussion, you aren't smart enough to look past just flat numbers so it's pointless speaking to you.

They said the fountain is not to be referred to as a "magical fountain," only "the fountain," or "the pool or devotion." Jk. Not trying to be rude.
---
Hahaha yeah I’m kidding. I just hope the new killer is fun to play with and against, like Myers or Piggy (at least for me). I’m gonna save up for the survivor though cause she’s EXTRA THICC
---
This kind of thing has happened to me before. I was playing as huntress, I hit a survivor, and the game just ended. And it ended the same way here. As soon as my weapon made contact, trial was over. No one DC’d, everyone got bloodpoints, the game just ended. I’m pretty sure I got either merciless or ruthless killer as well, when I’m pretty sure no one was killed. 
---
Yeah, I mean even if it’s a minute or less I don’t see why a team couldn’t even just go in lockers or hide at the start of the game and wait out the perk. Seems stupid, but why not? If the killer doesn’t find anyone there’s no reason to work on gens while the perk is active. 
---
But we don’t want her to stop projectile vomiting! :( no pepto-epic for that disease-carrying, nea looking, egyptian goddess.
---
maybe

I got lazy of making it look nice
---
I rather get scratched than bludgeoned by an incense burner.
---
Actually swap out nurses calling for the one that makes survivors in your terror radius scream when you down some one, you’ll see nearby people then hook somebody and see the far away people, other two are 👌🏻
---
Seriously? May I ask where did you grow up? 
---
And if rather be bludgened by an incense burner than killed by a zambonie.
---
I thought the new killer was going to be a spitter, but this makes more sense.

I don’t get why people call it a phobia. A phobia is an irrational fear, no? How is it irrational to fear vomit? That shit kills. That’s like having the “irrational fear” of rape. (virginitiphobia)
---
Just in a picture or something obscure like that. 
---
“Hey, you should be in best health for hunting survivors-“
---
“No, I don’t do medicine.”
---
I'll be honest, her face reminds me of the really mean teachers back in elementary school
---
Are there still people arguing about who bought a better game console...? Is this... still a thing?
---
Never run We'll make it with auto dict dict, the increased healing speed makes it harder to get skillchecks. Spinechill is better.
---
It’s the courteous thing to say to a man.
---
Baba Yaga skin is actually something I’m posting sometime soon!
---
Vomit time
---
Well done. Not my point. 
---
There's an easier skillcheck, and it triggers as soon as the killer picks you up. It's presumed that it'll still work even if they dribble you.
---
LMFAO at this is so accurate, have an upvote
---
I wonder if they are good at the game or they just say this to feel better about themselves...
---
One of the devs said they originally wanted Detective Matthews as survivor but that it didn’t work out
---
With Wraith? Look around. He's cloaked but not _invisible_. Listen for grass rustling or keep your eyes peeled for the shimmer of his movement. He's only completely invisible if he doesn't move.
---
A ragequitting killer awards every survivor 5000 BP, a ragequitting survivor gives a killer 650.
---
I would love to see it!!! Please tag me if you do 😭💞
---
It looks longer. After rewatching the stream the perk at one point is being used in the video when they show Purge.  It’s only shown for about 15 seconds, but the rate the timer is moving looks much longer than 60 sec. It does look like it’s probably going to be  2 minutes for tier 3.
---
I imagine A or B. We cant know for sure till the PTB tho.
---
THOSE DAMN WHIPPERSNAPPERS
---
You're a moron, you voluntarily put 4 people in the msot boring game possible, literally everyone hates going vs legion, every streamer will tell you it's a braindead easymode killer but HE is the one ruining the game? Fuck outta here I'm gonna download that MLGA thing and just block everyone who ever plays legion, bet I won't your rank 12 ass though.
---
no not really, i have my good games and my bad games, i just hate it when the survivors dont leave 
---
The new dlc perk info

Have my upvote. Werk sis.

Replace those perks with the last 10 updates of the game and it'd be accurate.
---
Its **like** 150% effective heal speed.
---
No, this is Jane Romero infected.
---
I want to see locker dodge blind the killer jump in locker use head on and hit that epic whip naynay
---
I want to get a SWF and have someone go down by the locker so someone can jump out with Head on and get the gamer moment save
---
So sad. Can’t E3, please nerf corn BHVR. 
---
You probably are a hoe.
---
Is this the state of the sub?  Really?
---
Well, or survivors can just wait out timer next to those gens doing nothing, because killer never coming to check them, and when the game starts, perk slot being wasted. I can see swf doing that.
---
You probably misunderstood my comment, either that or you don't know what you're talking about, but thanks for doenvoting me in your ignorance.
---
Even when you use something to emulate an Xbox controller on PC, it still doesn't show PS4 button prompts. That's the whole point. You're emulating a controller, how is the game supposed to know you're using a PS4 controller? And the game doesn't support PS4 controllers natively, so you'll never see the PlayStation button prompts on PC. That is why I am saying that, from the screenshot, you can not explicitly say whether or not they are actually using Xbox controllers. Like I said, I doubt they aren't, but you still cannot know for certain. 
---
Just stop this guy is stupid, once you know the stats don't take into consideration people killing themselves, ragequitting etc, you know the stats are completly biased and do not represent a legit game. 
---
First time seeing the perk icon, is that supposed to be elza from frozen?
---
I really hate her high waist pants. Then again, I saw that style all the time in the 80's, and it drove me nuts then too.
---
Alright, thanks for the clarification my man
---
You made me read this.
---
I'm new to the game, so if I end up against a 3+ swf with 2 flashlights and toolboxes I'll 100% facecamp to at least secure a kill.
---
I woudln't say 100/100 times. Even Marth's SWF squad got 2k/3k/4k'd sometimes.
---
You sound like a ho
---
No, that's that drink from the 80's, Shasta's what people called prison in movies in the 20's
---
I like all the white knight incels hanging around 
---
Oh god oh frick.
---
Go for it.
---
Nope, new survivor. Perk is called "Here I Am" and is brand new. I had to screenshot it direct from the Twitch stream which is why it looks dark, no way around it since the vid had to be paused.
---
No, I play Legion because it's unfun for both survivors and killers, but the point of Legion isn't to have fun, but to punish cocky survivors like you who think in order to win you need to put your brain on cruise control and then bitch when you're caught t-bagging and being a douchebag in the post game comments.
---
Legion is "The Stick" of killers, and I don't enjoy playing him very often, though I do enjoy bringing Joey out, slapping people like you across the mouth with his 32 inch cock, and then watch you sob and complain, like you are right now.
---
And, when I feel I've done enough damage to your frail little ego, I put him away and play someone fun, like Freddy, or the Doctor
---
They better give Jane a Selena inspired skin with long black hair and piecey bangs!!
---
hey can you stop acting like a fucking ass and shut up
---
"Waaaaeh"
---
"WUUUUUUUUUGH"
---
Yeah, I lumped that in with magical. I lean more toward eldritch lovecraftian god, but I dont know if we'll ever learn much about the Entity. 
---
Not once have I ran into a haunted grounds totem.. and I'm not new to the game
---
Would be interesting if the new perk completely disabled 3 generators, then for each one repaired, one of the three gens would be unlocked, rather than just for the first probably 30-60 seconds and then permanently being unlocked again. A minute on 3 out of 7 generators isn't really much since they don't even necessarily spawn on them
---
What do you expect from the internet?
---
Did they seriously add a killer that vomits on people? That's just disgusting. 
---
I'd say the 3 seconds before Head on works keeps it from being crutch. And Enduring is extremely common so It will probably be a meme perk like pebble and no mither. Its not as bad as those but I doubt it will see much use.
---
I'd have said discordance instead of nurse's calling to really capitalize on the reduced amount of available gens
---
I bet locker saves are going to become a thing.
---
Edgeman 
---
As a guy, I cannot relate, but I've heard getting punched in the cooch hurts a decent amount
---
At least on your first paragraph, that's kind of the risk in this game. You're not meant to bring the 100% perfect loadout every single time (much less with it being the exact same loadout every single time). 
---
Lol survivor escape rates are low cuz half of our teammates dc the moment they get caught or they farm each other. 
---
I thought this was serious, and then I saw your name. This is a pretty funny joke, you're gonna tag it shitpost, right?
---
Head on: apply to the forehead  
---
Calm spirit is the one that makes you no scream, Iron Will is for not making noise while injured
---
I agree (well, of course *I* agree, uh, look at my name). 
---
I 100% understand people who say "fix Legion". I want changes too. 
---
But deletion is going way too far. People forget or don't care that, in addition to people spending money, there are people who legit love Legion as characters.
---
I don't often play Legion because of the current situation but I always select Legion so I can have Frank in my menu and I switch around the cosmetics. I got nearly all the cosmetics because I love Legion so much. I hope changes will happen someday so I can main Legion (and main Legion proudly).
---
Changes would make everyone in the community happy. Deletion would only make Legion haters happy...and so isn't the best option.
---
Why are you both acting as though I main legion? Are you too stupid to fucking read? I've played less than 10 games as legion 3 of them being for daily's and Ive also played survivor against legion many times but no I'm just a "ToXIc LeGIOn MaIn!!!" Yeah sure I'm rank 12. Because it really takes skill to get to rank 1 right? That where the big brains hang out? People seem to be just as capable of sucking up there as anywhere else I've been. The only moron here is you. More upset at someone is okay with playing and playing against a character the developers put in the game than someone who actively rage quits like a baby. 
---
I probably shoulda checked that, thnx
---
I was waiting for someone to make this joke
---
sToP rUsHiNg My GeNs
---
Playing a killer you don't find fun, and that other people don't find fun, in order to make hypothetical assholes not have fun, at the expense of all the other people you play against, just so you can feel like a big man and win a video game, is insanely pathetic.
---
This happens a lot because the games can go so fast they are just content with catch one and moving on. Lately we been burning out 2 gens before the killer even finds us and then another 2 during the chase. He gets his one hook and camps. I don’t blame him for it. I’d be tempted to dc if the game was ending that fast and I couldn’t stop it
---
No lie, that made me sad .
---
Smash. 
---
Plague and poision was always green. For me it fits well.

Pacman Fever 
---
Well, you can see more or less half of the huntress' face with her default bunny mask, and the big-ass head piece actually reveals most of her face if you can get a right angle
---
How long is the Exposed duration of Iron Maiden? IIRC its about 6-10 secs? 
---
its not even bait at this point this is just insulting 
---
*World’s smallest violin for crying survivor main*
---
If I can use the dbd lore, then we know that whatever the survivors do in a trial, never really matters. They will end up at the campfire anyway. So. What I was going to say was, if I met the priestess in a trial, yeah. I'd fuck her
---
Survivors aren't a monolith. Multiple people can have multiple opinions believe it or not. Also people argue that hes broken because he requires no skill, and that he isn't fun to play against, because his power has no counterplay.
---
Rock win evritiem
---
Lol your a funny guy, this game is unbalanced as fuck and if anything it’s tailored to the killer that’s why the killer is always the host 
---
They nerfed DS because it was a free escape and the survivors don't even have to do anything to earn it. Now the gane tell you "we're sorry that the killer tunneled you, we won't let you get hooked again yet don't worry". It discourages tunneling and also doesn't punish killers for not dribbling. I don't see anything else this patch that "nerfs" survivors.
---
she's a leper
---
No, it' not my opinion. I just translated a top trending post in community and titled it "why matheiu cote got wrecked by Koreans"
---
But I'll translate this and upload it so original writer can see this.
---
If you try to walk past the pillar in the middle the trap will activate. If you were dropped or had a trap placed on you part that point then you're safe.
---
Samnation is gonna have a field day with this lol.
---
I mean, if I see sum pizza dwights jumping in and out of basement lockers they can escape. Otherwise I always try to get at least 3
---
Oh god reading about her vomiting on survivors..... oof that makes me NAUSEOUS. scariest killer in the game for a vomit phobic lmao.  
---
Vomiting isn't fun nor funny.. 
---
There's no way the hit box is that big
---
Wait,  so how long is it on Tier 3? 
---
I wanna say that it might be a good thing in a game like dbd but idk 
---
Her design seems to be primarily focused on slowing down the game in a way similar to pig(Where if you don't deal with the ticking doom on your head, you will gradually get worse and eventually go down, meaning you can't neglect it)
---
During the footage, she chased the dummy thicc survivor at some point, and took away a health stage most likely through vomitting alone, meaning continuous puke will likely be lethal
---
It also encourages you to hit multiple survivors to push the fountains out of play early, and have access to them yourself to apply a ton of pressure, as opposed to tunneling a single survivor down.
---
The real question is how you're supposed to play around the vomit, because she has 115% movement speed, so you'll have a hard time outrunning it, and since she can infect you over obstacles(It's a projectile, after all), looping her won't be very effective around a lot of obstacles. On the other hand, if you can only ever get wounded, and not downed from the puke, she'll become a basic M1 killer in the chase, which might make her too weak(Basically a freddy without transition)
---
I just want to chase around one person for the entire round vomiting on them.
---
&gt;pee in my butt cutie
---
thanks i hate it
---
You're just making assumptions.  You can tell if a Wraith is camping or not.  They are only invisible when completely motionless.  You can easily see them moving dozens of yards away so you'd see if he was following or simply camping.  Sounds like he just played against a toxic trash killer.  I was hardcamped twice with ebony moris yesterday.  It happens sometimes, no reason to assume OP is wrong or lying about his toxic wraith game 
---
no, at least 30 other people have mentioned it.
---
Lookin like a snack 👀😳😫
---
Hell yeah bois the predicted the name of the new killer HELL YEAH and that’s all I predict other then that it’s pretty far off
---
Honestly I'd rather have a plague doctor skin in nurse and how is the plague supposed to vomit through the mask
---
100% bannable offense.  Hope you recorded and reported him.
---
Screw the rules, I have a helmet!
---
Thats just purposely confusing semantics at rhis point.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
My power has doubled since the last time we met.
---
I better hear Larry Kings voice coming out of Jane then. 
---
What are you talking about?  Survivors are OVERPOWERED.
---
Coming from one too.
---
Killers need a fighting chance
---
Shoulda put Myers mask on the guy... "Now THAT'S some booty worth stalking!" 
---
Same here, this is a letdown. The teaser made me imagine something really fresh and new, like The Game was when it was released. 
---
It's no strategy it's an exploit the devs didn't intend when they introduced the killer into the game.  Just something extremely weak players do to crutch out their downs.
---
I MADE A MEME POST ABOUT DBD CROSSOVERS MONTHS AGO AND HEAD ON WAS ONE OF THE PERKS I SUGGESTED YEEESSSSSSSS
---
It's no secret that Leatherface was a rushed chapter. The DLC has no map or survivor included, and all of his addons are just billy's addon minus chilli, but those don't actually do anything noticable
---
I'm also pretty sure that being sick will prevent you from doing certain actions
---
Solidarity is good and so is Head On.
---
Also, last patch, Jeff had Distorsion which is really useful against Nurse's Calling. So, no, not again. 
---
Normally get more than one, but sometimes a survivor manages to piss me off so much it just feels worth it.
---
&gt;Literally after a facecamping leather face got 2 kills. 
---
&gt; #just had a friend open the hatch with a key
---
And I honestly don't blame the guy. The key is just another piece of bullshit Survivors don't fucking need. You guys get so many 2nd chance abilities as-is and here comes the Key that instantly opens a hatch and it stays open for the last guy. Anyone with a functional brain would say that's bullshit and they'd be right. But Behavior loves to reward bad players. I try not to ragequit in such situations but I don't blame the guy especially if he had a tough match. Fuck the key. The killer equivalent would be finding a Mori token of some kind and now they can mori your ass. You'd ragequit too most likely.
---
INB4 a schmuck say's "Well, if you hate the Key just use Franklin's Demise you bad killer xd!" 
---
1: that is if they have the key in the lobby.
---
2: making them drop the key with Franklin's doesn't magically destroy it. I have no idea how many times you have to hit them before the damn thing is useless but I assume it would be a lot.
---
3: they can easily still counter Franklin's by dropping the key, especially if they're SWF, so that way the Killer can't do anything except maybe camp that spot with the key which means they'll do gens.
---
(Bonus) 4: even when you kill the guy who has a key, either morri'ing him or putting him on a hook, the key stays on their body so another schmuck can grab it instantly escape. 
---
How in the fuck is that fair? Answer: it isn't. 
---
A potential way to use it would be to go into the locker in the basement after you get saved if the killer is nearby while you get saved 
---
A plague doctor skin for the Doctor would work. I’m not sure female plague doctors really existed and also the cane that they would carry is far more suited to the Doctor.
---
I Can see why they complain. Suvivors just want to do gens and thats it.
---
Having a second objective in the game, like plague cleanse or pig mask, is a must for killers these days. Especially when you have no map control.
---
The fact that the plague has a second objective and a ranged which gets you injured is very strong imo.
---
Combined with infectious Fright perk for the ultimate slug, and an extra objective, i see her beeing Top Tier killer.
---
It could be skewed by the amount of people DC'ing / killing self on hook / not loading in which leads to a quicker snowball, therefore dropping survivor escape rates.
---
I wanna say I have that one but an almost 3 year old won’t let me look lol
---
A lag switcher uses a physical switch to put stress on their internet causing lag, so you're probably not going to get in trouble. But, if your internet tends to be really unreliable at a certain time everyday, then you probably shouldn't play killer during that time. It kinda ruins the game for 4 other people. Not trying to be a dick, just saying that after enough people reporting you for the same thing over and over again will probably cause bhvr to look into it.
---
Because they aren't super fucking broken. If you are actually good at chase you can run the killer for a couple gens, then you decisive and boom that's another 1-2 gens. Sprint burst and self care don't so that.
---
If they're camping you they're either new and just want to secure the kill or (most likely, I'm just going to guess since you made a post crying) you behaved poorly which encouraged them to camp you. Either that or you can blame your team because they were hanging around the hook trying to bait the Killer to chase them so another guy can come in for the rescue. 
---
Ok great to hear
---
Thank you for the helpful reply. I'm just worried because I've already dumped so much time into this game and it'd be a shame to just have it all go to waste.
---
In game chat would ruin the game for a lot of people. Some of us who don’t like playing survive with friends enjoy the peace and quiet. 
---
I can see where they were coming from since they had around 50-60 ping in lobby but I'd expect it to spike to around 100-120 depending on where they live but yeah, I should refrain from playing Killer during the down-times. Thank you for your reply.
---
I was thinking add quick and quiet along with it too in order to mess with them as well haha
---
If you heal someone 100%, you will receive 50%. I don’t think it matter what quickly or slowly you do it. 
---
One thing I've learned from playing is that people will report you for anything. If you did nothing wrong, you shouldnt have anything to worry about.
---
Every game with voice chat has a mute system. That one is pretty obvious. For instance, overwatch, not only has a mute system, it has 2 channels you can choose to be in. 
---
Personally, I'd rather play a real killer where my efforts are rewarded. Other killers have much more interesting ways to ruin the survivors' day, like iri head Huntress, or simply dropping an ebony mori. I feel like if you need to resort to Legion, so as to "punish" survivors, then you're basically admitting you don't have the skill to play killer properly in the first place. The only way Legion has any real pwoer is when you use mechanics that remove skill from the equation.
---
No you guys are actual idiots if you think it's killer sided.
---
I've seen good players win without Ruin, just this week I had a trapper who was still running deerstalker and other stupid shit, all he needed was to put his traps in smart places and ta-da he could win without hex:ruin, faced him twice in a row and he beat us both times, then again he's probably actually good at the game unlike everyone on this subreddit.
---
In the same light self-care or healing items are 100% mandatory and survivors would be ridiculously overpowered if they didn't have anything to heal themselves, but I guess as a "sterotypical killermain" you kinda forgot about the mandatory things survivors need huh?
---
Very true, I was reported for a similar reason while playing Leatherface a few months back, nothing came of it though, so I was just a little more confident this time.
---
Oh no
---
Öink öink
---
Yos
---
120 isn't bad at all. If they're complaining about 120 ping, then they're just idiots. On PS4, 120 is pretty damn solid.
---
But she is a cute girl. She's a teen after all, and she only kills because she was offered a chance for revenge..
---
Thank you I love this! 
---
Rise of the Bubonic Babe
---
Yo how tf  did you get early access to the switch port
---
👍🏻
---
Yeah, I tend to get around 120 lobbies frequently, but occasionally there are little spikes that can screw one over. Anything's better than an 1100 lobby though.
---
I think someone has too much time on there hands here... why not devote your time to getting better, rather than fighting a battle you cant win, the game is supposed to be harder for survivors, it's clearly stated in the games description, the devs mare some bad balance changes and they're slowly trying to build themselves back up. Just because you got used to a perk doesnt mean the worlds going to end when they nerf it, it happens in all games
---
It's too much information tho (Doc main here) I tried using nurses, deerstalker, spies and rancor, and lemme tell you, seeing that much is just annoying..
---
My main mistress, the Bubonic Babe, coming in strong
---
Is this image going to be a meme now 
---
Pretty sure thats just bhvr's design team trying their best
---
I mostly play survivor, but the few games of killer I have played make me want to delete the game, survivors have it easy compared to what you guys go through
---
You should touch her, just to be safe.
---
The way you're taking a previous argument to another thread just shouts "I'm like 10" so, try playing killer a bit more and try to understand how real killer players feel about the game, stop wasting your time trying to justify yourself
---
You ever heard of Bond or having your teammates heal you? Crazy right. And the fact that you lost to a trapper without ruin twice in a row makes me question your abilities as a survivor lmfao what were you doing while he was trapping early game? Urban evading behind a tree?
---
Hes a hero to all of us
---
You only ever go against one killer at a time. Don't have Small Game, well you could be facing the Huntress so doesn't matter, don't have Iron Will but could be against a Hag that relies on her traps over chasing/tracking. DS was a no risk all reward perk that now is an antibiotic tunnel perk and is in a better place. They have nerfed killer multiple times, getting rid of machine gun build, Tinkerer no longer buffs add ons, Freddy. Also they said they want to keep the game going for at least the next 5 years so balancing will continue as always
---
Okay I'm out dude, these arguments are so low IQ repetitive bullshit that I can't even bother to get -10 downvotes for explaining how stupid the shit you're saying is.
---
I think the most I've heard of was 5k from a friend. Needless to say, the killer didn't start the match.
---
I mean in the end the maps are free so why complain. 
---
Ok but what I'd it's a coordinated swf that has 3 people doing different gens while one gets chased. Once that person gets downed and save a different survivor is chased and gens are still being done. You literally can't win against a good, coordinated swf unless you're a pro nurse
---
u/vredditbot
---
That's not even tier 3
---
u/v_redditbot
---
Couldn’t agree more. Plus I don’t think adding in game chat would add anything anyways. You’re more than welcome to request to use comms with people in the pre game lobby. It won’t make a difference if no chat is default and you can invite, or if chat is default and you can mute. There are bigger fish to fry in making this game better. In game chat won’t accomplish it. 
---
I will. 
---
Bullshit. 
---
UE has always been good
---
I didn’t like having Jeff in the game as he is for the aforementioned reason. And Dwight looks relatively in shape. 
---
Literally only you thinking this. Her Power is very promising. 
---
Yeah maybe because they don't need any buffs atm. That's why you are getting downvoted. Because no one agrees with you.
---
You're funny, name a killer that isnt billy or nurse that can win rank 1 matches over and over without ruin and add ons. I'll wait
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that in this thread. His response blew me away the most.
---
You know you usually lose credibility points when you start calling people names and such. We simply all do not agree with you and there is no reason to be salty over that
---
I'd prefer to not get cancer thank you very much
---
😑😑😑😑😑
---
its good meme build for fun but in terms of practicality
---
killer that can TP &gt; killer that m1s
---
you can actualy use bodyblock traps without the addon, if you mash CTRL you can tp instantly, this lets you block pathways with your own body, useful on maps like haddon.
---
Just give her few weeks ,the community are gonna use bill and nurse perks on her 
---
🤮
---
If you find killer stressfull nowadays you just need to get good
---
Believe they said in the stream the range isnt that large (probably to prevent this) and it's going to be interesting to see people try to use it
---
Exactly. I have enough voice chat after F13. Usually only trolls with their earrapes or screaming russians with shitty mics were using it. DBD already have toxic community but at least i can play this game solo in quiet. 
---
Which is stupid
---
Ewww. Kate is better
---
This comment has been made by Kate Gang
---
Well it is a  *Leatherface*  he is a special boy and blind ... like most of it's players.
---
Legion is still fucked and takes no skill
---
Infectious Fright and Distressing are going to be a great combo 😎
---
If everyone's saying the same thing... *it might not be them that's wrong*. Food for thought, you salty OP, you.
---
Enduring will never be as needed as it is now...top S rank perk now. lol
---
Thanatophobia is garbage on every killer except for legion... and yes I do use sloppy butcher a lot. In fact, I’ve been using it in place of Ruin as my main method to slow the game down as there’s very few other effective ways to slow the game down besides that and Ruin. However, I can only do that and consistently do well without ruin with all my other perks near tier 3 as I play with wraith and clown because they’re not great like billy, spirit, nurse. That trapper must be godlike to have stomped you twice to the point that you used him as an example in this odd cry for help thread. I pray he wasn’t using thanatophobia against you lol
---
Smell ya later!
---
Legit, NO ONE complains about the Internet unless thwy experienced lag
---
Explain why would it replace DS?
---
It doesn't do anything even close to the sad wheelchair perk that is DS
---
… That's literally the entire point of this game, lmfao.
---
Whole new spin on 2 girls 1 finger. 
---
Freddy needs:
---
* buffed range (brown addon base at least, his default is awful)
---
* 100% less action speed in transition (only transition)
---
* Adrenaline *only* wakes up, if sleeping, and will not heal as well
---
* unbreakable *does not* wake up
---
Unbreable + adren hurt Freddy far more than any other killer for no real reason, adren is why freddy has no real late game, and both are a kick in the dick when your trying to stall and someone (or everyone) randomly heals + wakes up.
---
Yeah or maybe reddit is the most circlejerky place on the internet and idiots like you will just downvote anyone not on their side, no matter what they say.
---
The point of the game is for killers to be stronger than survivors? Youre fucked you know, lmao
---
Yes you can
---
Nothing like a Roman Shower 
---
It's not a very common Hex, but I've seen it a few times with Ruin at the same time.
---
What time arena said lmao
---
Uhhh alert and dark sense, I never win or escape chases so knowing where the killer is most of the time and not letting him know where I am aka OOO. I'm a pussy
---
Recently and in short time, i've been accused and threatened to be reported, a few times because of lagswitch(my internet is pretty solid, so that's weird), two guys thinking the bug where you can't see skillchecks and other things are hacks, and some guys who think bbq and nurses is a hack. I haven't done shit and try to be nice. I hope the report system requires some evidence, because this happening in such a short time makes me nervous.
---
if i posted on reddit every time i got called cheater or lagswitcher i would be banned for spam, lmfao
---
Common cold
---
If I am playing solo I am playing solo and not interested to talk to you or anyone else in the game.
---
Yeah also referred you to truetalents videos before Hex:ruin. I take this name so I know who not to take seriously, if you're that easily triggered you're a joke to me, if you think my arguments are invalid just because I watch a youtuber, you're a joke to me, that's why you're the 12 year old and I'm the grownup here.
---
...just make your own custom flair and name it that, ez fix
---
I feel how your internet is pretty solid and you've gotten survivors who accuse you of lagswitching, since mine is solid for most of the day, but towards night it just slows down a bit and occasionally just stops working altogether, it's real odd.
---
had to look at this a while to realize what the fuck was going on
---
No
---
Corrupt intervention is probably an S rank perk.
---
So you want to push the hole community to choose if mute is something you need to do to enjoy the gaming experience?
---
Muy consado
---
Looking at that pic I feel like she needs more colour to her skin or else she'll look too close to the Hag outside her outfits. 
---
&gt;fame isnt supposed to be easy for killer
---
Wat
---
If what I think you're attempting to say is correct, nobody said anything about the *game* being easy for the killer. Simply put, the killer is meant to be stronger (the power role, if you will). Survivors actually are supposed to be weak individually (you'd know this if you actually read up on the game...), but get their strength through numbers and coordinating with each other despite not being able to talk to each other (basically the whole reason why SWF on voice comms is such a problem). 
---
That also has very little to nothing to do with meta perks. Maybe the devs don't want to give survivors yet another meta perk, who knows. That doesn't mean that any survivor perk should be able to trump killers (which is a huge part of why DS is getting the hell nerfed out of it). 
---
&gt;if youre fucking deluded enough to think killer should be stronger then survivir
---
Read up on the damn game, ffs.
---
&gt;and get more good stuff and New good perks
---
Don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say a word about any of that, the only person who said anything about that was you. Getting good perks doesn't mean stronger; the killers themselves at base are meant to be stronger than survivors. Their perks are meant to be stronger as well, yes, but again: survivors are meant to try to work together (or not, depending on if they're being selfish or not). Read the damn steam page, ffs. It says all of this on it. 
---
&gt;then get some help and stop messaging me
---
If you're deluded enough and lazy enough to not even read up on the game, maybe you should stop messaging me. You're like talking to a brick wall, dude. 
---
Survivor will be good but the killer
---
Oh no the killer
---
Stopped reading at "killer is supposed to be stronger than survivor" piss off 
---
I don’t get why killers are that desperate for a 4K they will waste each others time for it, who gets more points at the end of the day? But MUH DOUBLE PIP
---
Not anymore delete this comment 
---
I really don't think you can have an opinion on this. It is a basic understanding of how the English language works. Have you ever heard of a noun,verb,adjective etc?
---
Survivors will accuse even the slightest lag that doesn't end up in their favour of being a lagswitch.
---
~~decent~~ ???
---
This isn't that big of an issue to begin with. A lot of this has with timing to do or you just being unlucky.
---
I'd marry kate cuz she thicc as shit boi, punch meg because they some boosted shits, and kiss freddy because D A R N
---
Spirit itd be rough and huntress is a definite no, she moves too slow to patrol efficiently 
---
Infectious fright will not be worth it on doctor most likely, and here is why. For doctor to have his massive terror radius he must be in shock mode, which he by definition cannot down a player in. His addons for terror radius lower his terror radius in punishment mode. This means that whenever you would down someone you will have the smaller terror radius. Even with distressing or M&amp;A involved they will be boosting a tiny terror radius to just a normal one.
---
On top of all that, doctor has no problem tracking the entire survivor team anyway, especially with tier 2 madness clone auras. Doubling down on tracking won't do any good when his problem is that he can't down survivors quick enough against good teams.
---
The hole community? Like the book?
---
When BHVR keeps balancing the game around SWF, then doesn't make any changes to improve solo queue's experience, who's gaming experience is getting ruined? I'm not talking about DS, I still have level 1 Laurie.
---
Exactly, whenever i get to the match as killer and the survivor comes over for standoff, i wait a couple mins then hit the surv cuz aint nobody got time for that
---
Marry David. Punch Meg. Kiss Myers
---
Question about Infectious Fright: if you're running Monitor&amp;Abuse and down someone, does Fright trigger in your boosted terror radius as you were just in a chase, or in a reduced terror radius because the chase ended as soon as the person you were chasing got downed?
---
People are already talking about how good Fright would be on Myers, but M&amp;A is already a decent perk that often sees use on Myers, and if it has positive synergy with Fright, I could see the combo becoming stronger than Enduring/Spirit Fury
---
This guy DBDs
---
Are u a brother or a sister?
---
Except UE is absolute dogshit and it's the exact opposite of DS in playstyle
---
Pretty sure it's on the right side. In the mirror the scar was on the left. 
---
oh i know truetalent, i also know his opinion on how much ruin is needed at high ranks, if anything youre the joke here, and i think your arguments are invalid because youre talking about dlc nerfing survivors in "some" way, but sure keep trying to make me say something i didnt say like a good little surv main. 
---
So, whining about urban evasion but running ruin and noed. Yikes.
---
Bro
---
Welp I’m a Kate main who will also be maiming Jane soon so this is pretty awkward 😂
---
Maybe pre- made callouts your team can see in text
---
Enduring means the stun lasts 0.75. Good luck gaining some distance mate :)
---
I would uninstall if there was in-game chat
---
I wait about 1 minute then just hit them since I don’t wanna play a staring contest for several hours
---
You are suggesting that since \*YOU\* want to use in game voice - \*EVERYONE\* has to use in game voice or mute it. I don't see the game being balanced around SWF, and what does the DS have to do with this? My solo games have not been ruined .. I wonder are you playing the same game.
---
Damn striaght
---
Would've hit 1k in an hour if it was Freddy.
---
I foresee possible doctor shenanigans turning the obsession into a madness bomb if that includes killer powers
---
mfw i cant use sound on reddit
---
But hatch is 7k
---
KAREN VACCINATE THE FUCKING ANND LET ME SEE THEM
---
Even if it lasts 30 seconds it won't be even close to "meta-defining". Do you know how a kiler finds survivors? By catching them doing objectives(or them searching ruin if you run that). If gens are blocked, survivors can just hide for 1,2, whatever minutes and it'll be close to impossible for a killer to find them unless you are doc. This perk is way overhyped imo.
---
yeah but like alot of killers use noed, and if theres a totem near the hatch then the survivor cant get it and if they do last gen BOOM noed crutch
---
mfw i have sound and she says “i’M a ClOwn”
---
I mostly see a lot of slugging with coulrophobia
---
You have to be in the locker for 3 seconds before you can use it, its also an exhaustion perk.
---
mfw ok thanks
---
The game calls them jorts but we all know what they really are

https://discordapp.com/

its basically like skype for gamers (with non of the annoying shit of skype) you get very large communities on it, like the official DBD discord
---
Kate - Dwight - Nurse
---
Ow damm your right, didn’t even see that myself
---
Considering you don't even understand a basic fundamental design choice of this game, I highly doubt that.
---
I’d go and find a different company where I know I’ll be appreciated for what I do and not have to deal with angry children yelling about dumb shit. No point in working somewhere if your work goes unappreciated and at least in retail the complaints stay minimum and are actually justified rather than “hurrr durr gimme de cuzmetix an ficks da bugggz cuz defs dont car abut teh plaierz”
---
Here I Am?
---
Oh yeah forgot about that. Alright checks out chief
---
Loooool no.
---
Plague as good as the nurse? Rofl
---
i dont give a shit, buzz of you sad little loser
---
The prophecy has been foretold..... The next game after reading this post my friend did that for me
---
Here the deal, you can prevent this from happening by delaying the game long enough that the last gen doesn't even pop. The way I play makes it so I sacrifice 2 gen pretty early and then they rarely get 2 more gens. You could also use perks like remember me which is really good on Freddy, and in addition synergies with his power, the 50% reduction.
---
I feel bad for the ppl that pizza dwight is delivering to
---
hi thank you this is something I’ve already tried and it still doesn’t work 😩
---
Whispers
---
Gonna be honest, as someone with severe emetophobia, I'm really not looking forward to this.
---
It's a shame because I really like the look of Plague.
---
I have tried this as well and it still won’t connect to the servers 🙁
---
So much for "have a good life". I thought you left already. You obviously do give a shit, or you wouldn't keep coming back. Careful, I might think you're angry.
---
Why does she remind me of the hippo from Madagascar?
---
ive had this happen to me as killer multiple times, there are even vids on my youtube channel showing it, go on my posts and you will find me linking my own youtube vids
---
So do you think calm spirit will override the vomit sound the way it does with screams?
---
He's been on Reddit for 4 days.  . . . . . .hmmm.
---
there is also the people who feel neither of these opinions, I'm refering to those who will find it hot instead :)
---
it's cool that you seem to put so much time into thinking about improving a game character and his qualities! I mean who knows, maybe one of your suggestions does manifest itself in the game sometime in the future 😃
---
yea i dont know how anyone finds her hot, like damn she looks like a middleaged fat ogre
---
shes not thicc anymore, thats just fat
---
what was the outcome?
---
You're flooding my inbox for no reason. As if I care if a complete nobody blocks me, you're acting pathetic and childish. 
---
Replace people wasting my time with people wasting their own time? Ok, I can handle that.
---
Or we could just fix Freddy's power and not allow survivors to do shit during the dream transition, among other things.
---
usually the point of body blocking is stop stop the killers from tunneling; as in the person you saved is on their last hook whilst you haven't been hooked. trying to make the killer switch targets is the point. or maybe the body blocker feels they have a better chance at escaping the killer 
---
yeah, the new surv is ugly and not thicc, fat
---
It is a good perk. You can move pretty fast, not leave scratch marks and be crouched, it has been a clutch for me many times
---
Dwight. Nea. Wraith.
---
nononono and no, if you dont wanna be chased to play lego star wars, urban is for noobs who go down in 1 second
---
He’s an ass. Jeff players are worst than P3 Claudettes.
---
You didn’t lie. 
---
the scream shows an aura and distortion can hide it, but you can hear the scream anyways
---
Head on at least requires exhaustion. DS was free.
---
yuuup
---
Marry Kate punch David (cuz he can take it best) kiss my girl Sally
---
as long as he doesnt trap you in there then its fine, just a memer
---
yeah, even when you're on lery's and she's running around on autohaven, you'll hear it! louder than the terror radius 
---
Don't bother. This place is so killer sided you'll just make the babies cry.
---
Use this perk with the doctor who already causes you to scream for maximum d/cs
---
Why is this downvoted 
---
its not really usefull, get another perk, stealth is BORING
---
Infectous fright does not work if you down survivors with bile (if you can even down them with upgraded power)
---
I’m actually more curious about if you’re cooperative healing someone. You didn’t heal them all the way on your own so do you still get the full conversion. 
---
yet almost everybody I came across in a game fell for it! muahahahahaha wah
---
Thats a good point, feel like coop healing should give you like 75% because teamwork, idk.
---
like half this sub is LGBTQ pretty sure he will get those upvotes back
---
Thought the same. Didn't think the community with daddy Myers would be anywhere near homophobic.
---
Tell that to all the killers who use insidious and noed and then act like they‘re awesome. 
---
ok, you obviously haven't versed some of those legions that ruin the game
---
or you just stay where you are and position yourself in a way that the gen you are repairing hides your aura? Its almost always a survivors choice if his aura gets revealed to bbq or not Oo
---
Add the two hits/grab + hook (and all the extra points it gives for entering second phase and dying) + 2500 points for killing
---
Its also clutch against hag.
---
Some sort of striped bathing suit with a swimming ring around her waist s'il vous plait! 🌞
---
You're a MONSTER
---
Hold up. We don't even have the PTB yet and people are already bashing the killer.
---
Punished for your greed.
---
I agree. I have emetophobia so this is going to be fun for me 
---
stealth doesnt work anymore, killers have so many ways to detect you, either from the killer ability itself, or perks, i just run around get the killer attention teammates do gens
---
the reason why i don't mind playing against legion is because i also played as them 👀 
---
Gotta save this one, thanks!
---
How
---
Imagine her going to a locker to grab some hatchet only to get stunned. 
---
*"Бля"*
---
Peter ready to loop dis b
---
moonwalk, look down, use franks mixtape, or just hit the survivor 4 times, they cant do anything to counter it
---
Jake's power level rises.
---
I understand completely, I'm rank 2 and I'm best at hiding and doing gens. I can do 4 gens by myself with ruin just fine but god forbid I get in a chase. I've noticed that rank 2-4 and rank 10-13 in my experience are usually the saltiest about anything. I had a guy talk mad shit to me for getting a 3k at rank 19 as Hag while him and his crew were 10-12. I literally just insidious camped my ruin hex and attacked anyone who got near it, nothing else lol
---
That looks horrifying! Forget the plague this is the new killer! 
---
Step aside, shirtless David. A new main has arrived.
---
After going back to playing on PC more after playing primarily on PS4, it seems survivors on PC are vastly more picky about ping.  If anyone gets around 150 or more it seems like there's about a 50% chance they just leave.  For players to leave due to ping on PS4 it usually needs to be like 300+ and even then it usually just gets played out.
---
25 sacrifices each. Mori, Devour, Rancor, Tombstone don't count.
---
Complaints are minimum and justified?! My dude what the fuck are you smoking?
---
So u like to have diarrhea every min lol
---
all of them
---
To be honest I feel like the only thing putting him below Trapper is his bugs. Without them he'd actually be somewhat okay? He's still in serious need of buffs, but the main problem is his bugs that basically remove whatever power he has.
---
Maybe people just don’t want this subbreddit to turn into a gay pride movement and it’s understandable. It is the way it is..
---
Personally, I don't think it's that bad. It's the same chassis, but I would barely recognise it as the Red Forest.
---
proly cause PGJSF is one of the most over-used memes in this community, not something only veteran players are aware of, i guess
---
AAAAAA
---
My bad... I don't run the English client so I gor confused. Rip me.
---
I don't think it's Legion that is fun to play against, it's the person playing them. It's more dependent on how they play the killer rather than the killer themselves. 
---
Kinda have the feeling Calm Spirit will counter this, thus I also see it possibly being run a lot more. Just a feeling though, I may be wrong.
---
Even if he is playing Freddy wrong, personal skill is irrelevant to how good a killer is, so please stick to FACTS and LOGIC (to destroy those libtards). We haven't seen him play, either.
---
Pinochet, could you perhaps explain your general strategy while playing Freddy? Perhaps record some gameplay?
---
Imagine a LF using tombstone 
---
Hag-no ruin or add ons wont survive a swf group, spirit will have a rough time,  huntress is too slow to move around the map to have any control. Aside from nurse and billy, killers cant consistently get a 3k without ruin and add ons. 
---
Gotta cover all your bases
---
Sprint burst was nerfed.   
---
You used to be able to get rid of exhaustion mid chase, allowing for 1-4 extra sprint bursts depending on how well the person was with looping.
---
People begged for it to be nerfed and put in-line with other exhaustion perks. Aka you needed to fill a condition to use it. Instead they nerfed all exhaustion perks.   
---
Still, point still stands that they did in fact nerf Sprint burst.   
---
They also nerfed self-care as well recently. They made it so all healing takes longer, which in turn makes self-care take even longer. Especially so if they have the mangle effect on them. 
---
I dunno what how I typed what I did but I meant especially for killers besides Billy and Nurse lmao
---
HAAAAAAAAA!!! Danielle Staub for killer in Chapter 12 please. 
---
I'm stoked for the killer and survive just the map now doesnt hold any value for me 
---
Kate, Laurie (for bringing decisive strike into our great game), The Legion (Susie). 
---
I agree, chasing is one of the most important things for a killer to have. It is also true that map pressure doesn't help nearly as much unless you have chase potential to back it up.
---
However, on the flip side, chase potential is equally useless without some form of pressure. No matter how quickly you end chases, get hooks, etc, there are four survivors and you can only chase one at a time. So you get another survivor off of gens to go unhook. Maybe then you find another survivor, so three are off gens. But there's still one left, and even one survivor doing gens can still pop them relatively fast. That's in an IDEAL scenario.
---
TL;DR - Chase potential and map pressure are both extremely important. The reason I think Freddy defies this standard is because he has the stall available to reliably create deadzones, which GIVES him that chase potential he lacks at base.
---
From how the live stream described intervention I kinda doubt it’ll be tooo toooo good. Didn’t they say it only lasted like, a couple seconds or something? If it lasted like, 1.5 minutes THEN we are cookin, but imo if it doesent last long I feel like you would be better off just picking a dif perk/hex which can last the whole game ya feel? 
---
Yeah he was just making around
---
I don't have much experience with UE4, but as far as I'm aware, it's fairly easy to check the distance between two objects,
---
No, that's a thurible name.
---
Well seeing as her vomit can cause damage when powered up I can imagine something along the lines of holding them while vomiting/burning their face off.
---
The nurses Mori, but with vomiting into the mouth. 
---
How is it vague? It's just the 3 that are the greatest distance from you.
---
I don't mind if it replaces DS. I prefer people sneak around than crutch their way out. 
---
Entirely accurate for PS4. Like a match with 200 ping has slight hiccups, but is still playable.
---
Yah, I also would rather see the perk only activate after the 1st gens complete and last like, a minute
---
We play on PC with everything under 200. When desperate bit more. But 200 is almost every time pretty bad ingame xD
---
Really excited for solidarity, it makes a team based build more appealing. Probs gonna yoss that one on my Dwight tbh
---
It doesn't ruin it. 
---
When I saw the Plague vomiting on other survivors I was grossed out.
---
probably why they made it slime green. It seems like more of an homage to the Exorcist than anything. Plus it's not like she's gonna be gagging and dry heaving, which is easily the worst part of barfing. More of an acid fire hydrant than throwing up 
---
Lupos
---
how is she hot? shes a fat middleaged mom and makes me grossed out more then the killer puke
---
that myers looks about as depressed as i do  in real life
---
Have u seen her A S S lol
---
Rule 34 exists for a reason.
---
yeah thats the grossest part, i like ass, but not FAT asses, Kates or megs are perfect
---
As someone that has played since launch at 144 FPS, I smell something else being fishy here.
---
Oddly satisfied 
---
haha
---
“Greed”
---
Wait, barf can injure survivors?
---
also she looks like shes like 35 big turnoff for me not into older women, but also not a pedo i swear
---
Kate, Laurie, Huntress
---
But I like older women :P
---
1. Two answers to this.
---
1.1. Freddy can use certain perks (M&amp;A or Insidious, perhaps) to break the chase and see where the survivor is going, then go to cut them off.
---
1.2. Sometimes he doesn't NEED to use his transition mindgames to get the down, if there are enough pallets broken across the map. That's the point of a deadzone. Freddy is still a 115% M1 killer.
---
3. Ending chases as quickly as possible is important. I agree. But no matter how quick you end chases, at BEST you get three survivors off of gens for a short amount of time. Unhooking does not take long. That's an ideal scenario; it's more likely you'll end up with two survivors off of gens, with the other two powering on. Freddy's strength comes in his ability to KEEP survivors off of gens, until he can start getting hooks and adding even more pressure that way.
---
4. Fair, I just think Hag is better than the other killers in A tier.
---
5. Bodyblocking is fair enough, but how does he prevent the others? Taking a hit sounds good in theory, but it falls apart when you realize Bubba's chainsaw does not directly help him in a chase. It gives you an instadown, but it is an EXTREMELY situational one. Please elaborate on the "rev saw under pallets" point; I didn't quite understand it.
---
6. Agreed, Huntress does suffer on some parts of certain maps. But if she sees you, often times a good Huntress can manipulate hitboxes and zone you out into the open for a hit. Her lack of map pressure is why I don't have her as S or A+ tier.
---
7. Free hits aren't a bad thing, but they don't provide a whole lot of help. This is, again, assuming they even get trapped in the first place. Given the finicky hitboxes and bugs associated with bear traps, that isn't going to happen very often.
---
8. Addonless and perkless are alright, but imo they should at least be considered, since most killers will run perks at least, if not addons as well.
---
9. Chase isn't all that matters. It's extremely important, you're right there, but if chase was all that mattered then Billy and Spirit would not be top tier. Spirit's power is a mindgame. But if you want to talk stall, then stall actually does indirectly provide help in a chase. Deadzones. 
---
10. What mindgames do Myers and Clown have? Pig's mindgame is great, Billy's is situational, Huntress' is good, Nurse is... Nurse. But Wraith's mindgame is kinda bad with only 1s of Windstorm. He needs 1.5 imo; most loops are too big for him to get a hit with that mindgame. But Freddy's transition mindgames are extremely effective, and it almost always works simply because nobody expects them. And even if a survivor does expect them and knows how to play against a Freddy, the Freddy player can then switch their tactics up and make it a normal 50/50 mindgame. Or he can just run Pill Bottle, which I notice you doing.
---
11. Survivors at any rank are bad, because ranking up as survivor is pathetically easy. Ruin is strong against the majority of survivors - this is true - but useless against good ones, and good ones are the survivors we should take into account when determining a killer's effectiveness.
---
If they've moved away, they're off gens and you can go back to whatever you were doing. Freddy can switch tasks without consequence.
---
Disagree. Deadzones can happen very, very quickly. Slugging got nerfed recently, yes, but healing that extra 5% takes about the same amount of time as unhooking someone. Giving you less points is annoying, I agree, but irrelevant to whether or not it's a good strategy. And I'd take any killer over Clown.
---
Me to
---
Just suicide out and go to the next game. Bad games will occur in any game where you have to rely on your team to some degree.
---
Accept that bad games will happen and just move on without thinking too much about it and you will have a better time.
---
yeahy survivors are trash these days, and killers are boosted, ps why the heck do you attempt escape with triangle? XD
---
Can't beat default unreal texture. That shits legit. The way forward. Dbd leading that path of innovation once again. Trail blazers. 
---
yesh, we are frens

ew xD, ill stick to the younger "teeny" girls, ps r/dbdgonewild my fav subreddit ;)

I drop pallets with circle too lol
---
Guys chill, Kate Denson is better 😘
---
.... interesting 
---
I agree. I was eating when they showed it off.
---
But i still love the power
---
Rank one with legion is easy
---
Okay
---
I assume in this case you could put the RBT on, then just drop them outside the gate entrance and be good to go right?
---
because i have a 144hertz monitor and skill checks are a pain in the ass with 60fps because they jump instead move smoothly
---
“Aww, you’re just not ready for me” - Jane right after slamming a door in The Plagues face

---
Yeah lol I thought clown was kinda gross but this is just straight up disgusting not even scary.
---
I did donuts around trees when killers was onto me and got away because of UE. Not only that, but you’re less likely to be seen using it when you walk crouch around at normal walk speed, and can maintain cover when nearby killers get within close proximity to you. Anyone who says this is a trash perk doesn’t know when, where, and how to use it😂
---
Balanced hAHa
---
It’s not my fault if the killer doesn’t scare me off the gen, 
---
You only get into a chase if a survivor runs in front of you, since the survivor didn't run the chase didn't start and the music also didn't
---
That’s PS4 players for you. 
---
Tbf, isn't the goal for survivors repairing the gens and get out? I've had a lot of killers rage quit when i juked them, takes the fun out of being a distraction. When you loop a killer, you're called toxic.
---
One time I almost went insane by playing Doctor with just Spies on the hospital map. My screen was constantly exploding everywhere xD
---
Not being confrontational, just asking. But what are your thoughts of camping. Sucks right. 
---
it also counters the iron maiden scream I think? 
---
So far you seem to be the only other person who knows how to operate with this perk 
---
You just triggered my PTSD card!
---
I feel like common sense isn't exactly common around here. These motherfuckers just want everything fixed immediately and to their exact specifications.
---
Holy shit they even have the same surname
---
I get your point. Camping could end badly for you when you play against a full squad though. In the time one survivor hangs, there could be atleast 2 gens fixed. Same as tunneling. When you get looped by a survivor who knows the map too damn well, they'll easily get all the gens.
---
That’s my point. Okay, camping AND tunneling. As a killer, I try to ensure everyone is having a good time. I’ll let survivors go to chase another. Or leave the hook intentionally to allow them to be saved and RESET. I guess I just don’t see the appeal to load up a match, knock out 5 gens in 5 minutes then head for the gate and on to the next match. That sounds boring to me. What’s the appeal to come back and do that again. 
---
I think corrupt intervention will be a weak perk to be honest. I always work on the middle gens first anyways
---
Yes, if the survivors clense themselves at the fountains, the killer can use the fountain to upgrade her spit to be able to damage the survivors.
---
Seems like a timer based/one time use thing though, since you need to refresh it.
---
Sometimes people will just AFK do gens if there is no pressure. Sometimes it is worth dropping a chase if you know the survivor is just well prepared and wants you to chase them. Get the weak ones first, there's always one or two survivors who will sneak around but when the chase begins they choke and get downed quickly. 
---
another top teir killer... finally
---
can we make a killer dating website though
---
The only one I agree with is cheating, the rest is just someone who doesn't understand the game.
---
If it was here I am it would definitely be frozen, but yeah it’s head on. 
---
What I meant was if it was based off her bust her doors open, since quite a few perk icons are based off memes. 
---
Nobody mentioned Nurse.
---
Hag and Huntress are also top killers, while being completely different than Nurse.
---
Tbh, I'm not really sure what the point of Head On is. It sure as hell isn't a chase perk, yet it causes exhaustion. It seems like it has exhaustion just so the survivor can't use any exhaustion perks after surprise-stunning/trolling the killer for a moment. 
---
Fair enough
---
Working a regular retail job generally doesn't result in death threats my dude. BVHR devs tend to get personally threatened by the more fucked up elements of this garbage community. Just saying.
---
Yeah, good point. Too much time spent on the guy begging to be chased. 
---
The gate open ?
---
You're right. It's not like one of the most iconic horror movies of all time had throwing up in it. 
---
Nah Freddy is sexxxy
---
Yeah, good tip
---
Jane is way thicker. She has legit curves, Meg has a nice ass I guess but it's mostly her tight jeans. Jane = Hottest survivor imo
---
And if you get seen when you easily could’ve crouched away at 100% of your walk speed?? When I played killer, I caught so many survivors trying to stay still when they were better off moving out of my field of view.  Using UE while moving behind objects is stops me from being seen by the killer. You can get around much easier using it. It has contributed heavily to my escape many times
---
An opportunity to humiliate the killer is never a wash.
---
Sometime killers can get so angry, they reach their final form. 
---
never seen a good player run urban, because they are good and realize the perk sucks, goodbye
---
see, if you rely on stealth theres your problem, now goodbye
---
You haven’t played with/against me so I get why you think that way
---
Man idk, I just like being chased, some survivors like to do gens it is the way it is.
---
Yea you are..
---
SWF is cancer also. 
---
i see. didnt know that
---
Having concerns is one thing. Screaming "ThAt iS So Op mAn" when you haven't even played the chapter is fucking stupid. And it isn't about the "last three killers being ass to play against". The only legit complaints are regarding Smooth Criminal Legion. Spirit is fine. It just seems like survivors want to only do gens. And any killer that introduces a secondary objective makes them screech.
---
This has happened with damn near every killer release since Hag. It's getting ridiculous.
---
I also want to know
---
So in your opinion/experience. What is it that you’ve found puts the most pressure on you? Is it the terror radius/presence? What makes you slip around a corner to check things out. Is it the hunting hurt survivors for the real. Unhooking. Totems/boxes. What have you found that keeps you away from the gen. 
---
I agree with you. Idk why they downvote...
---
How is it my problem if its the reason why killers can’t catch me?
---
Eh. You could have tracked the head better. Even just frame by frame. 6/10 meme
---
there it no release butten
---
its great when everyone has open handed, kindred 3 and bond because they stack and you can see the killer or survivor from quite a distance
---
Gen rushing doesn't exist, there are no other objectives bar maybe totems, depending on which ones are active.
---
She can also just vomit on all the generators and infect survivors that way
---
I like doing the objectives efficiently. There's a good feeling when the game is progressing well. It also feels good to keep the dps going when the killer has map pressure.  More cynically, doing gens is the only part of survivor gameplay that isn't riddled with bugs.  Even more cynically, what else is there to do in the game? Crouch around and search for chests for brown lunchboxes?  Also, as much as I love bloodpoints, they are not the objective of the game -- they were back when that was how we ranked up, but not anymore.  
---
Camping, Tunneling, Gen Rushing, flashlights, whatever are all annoying but the game doesn't care about what we *like*.   
---
I guess im really great at DBD if I can afford to “waste a perkslot”
---
In the stream, they said the PTB would be ''sometime this week''. 
---
Corrupt Intervention won't be that good, I'm telling you. The only strength it has is when you're looking around for survivors early on all 4 survivors wont be able to quickly rush a gen to half- full gen before you find them.  You're better off running Discordance, then not only will they not be able to rush a gen once the game starts early on, but you will have that all game.

That knife looks too short, and Amanda too tall?
---
i can't rotate images in paint.net :-(
---
Not at all, I’m one of those I’ll play to win, if camping or tunnelling is the right thing to do at the time I’m doing it screw thus communities made up rules, 
---
Camping doesn’t bother me to be honest I’ll just try and live for as long as possible while the killer loses three gens, personally I’ll camp of the gates are open, or camp if the survivors are super altruistic.  
---
GIVE US A TWINK BHVR THE GAYS NEED OUR THICC WOMAN + TWINK COMBO
---
Ok, werk.
---
That was quick! Well done! 
---
I really don't think the goal of the devs is to create meta perks every patch. Yeah, Distortion isn't meta, but I find it really useful to cut a chase by healing or when there's no locker nearby. Also, Head On will be really useful for basement plays. Until now, if the killer came to the basement right after an unhook, you were done. With this perk, it's over. I agree, it is really situational, but nowhere near a bad perk. 
---
I don't see what problem you people have with nurse
---
It's great when they're on the other side of the pallet n they come back over..good times.
---
....................wig................................
---
So he whiffed
---
A good nurse will blink on top of you and hit you no matter what you do. She ignores walls, pallets, everything. 
---
The only hope you have vs her is that she's bad. Design wise she's awful in a multiplayer game. If she was a singleplayer game character she'd be great.
---
1. genrushing is not something you should be complaining about
---
2. most instances of "genrushing" are caused by either you being bad or the map being dogshit (and the map-designer has proved multiple times to be incompetent)
---
For the record I hate literally every survivor who just focuses on getting gens done ASAP, just like I hate every killer who tunnels, camps or only uses OP add-ons. Both are unfun playstyles and I feel sorry for everyone who is deranged enough to feel the need to play like that in a game like this. 
---
Still. You're complaining about the wrong thing.
---
Marry Nea, Punch Nea and Kiss Nea. 
---
Nea fits in everything
---
Pretty sure ive seen pc players do this kind of shit before lol. It's possible and i've seen these players in rank 1. 
---
Oh yeah I still like it, I'm just a critic boi lol
---
For me it depends on the situation. When the team tries their best I wouldn't suicide but like in OPs clip where they sit in a corner you are just delaying the inevitable.
---
I assume as they grow sicker and you grow stronger you can apply greater debuffs like insta downs, broken etc
---
Yeah, it's just the matter of how good she is.
---
Plus if you run at her she can look at the floor to blink in place instead of overshooting, then she just 2nd blinks to you.
---
Running CI and Ruin is going to be counter-productive. If survivors spawn near a gen they can't do then they'll just start looking for totems in that area, knowing that the killer is unlikely to patrol where they are
---
They mentioned the perks in the live stream I think. A new survivor perk "head on" will let you stun the killer if they are near when you leave the locker in sprint after being in it for 3 seconds.
---
Yeah, I had one person once sit in a corner and I could see them pointing at me and t bagging while they sat and waited for me to die. We were the only 2 people left and it was my first hook. After I finally died they didnt even know where the hatch was. But still. I'll never forget that unnecessary t bagging.  
---
My new OTP.
---
what would her power be tho? Square Tits? Pathelogical Liar? Engaged 21 times? loool
---
Checkmate
---
When will we be getting a free DLC? :) (Like Nurse and Huntress)
---
Its counter able though. Don't go to the locker. I cant imagine the the radius will be large
---
Yah, nurse has potential to be absolutely broken, but you have to be really good with her to get there, nurse is 200% making predictions on what survivors do
---
That's a good point. How useful it is is relying on how long the stun is.
---
Like mostly a new player.
---
Or maybe long lost twin sister?
---
The devs said that if you leave the sickness it results in you being broken and vomit regularity which makes you more noisy 
---
But if you think about it the plague doctors weren’t curing the plague either..
---
Where they say that?
---
I see Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 with a brown wig 
---
***the plague***
---
That’s a great question, I played a game against the Cannibal today (one of the worst killers in the game) the guy who played him wasn’t amazing he missed his chainsaws often but they thing that got him the 4k on Crotus Prenn Asylum was his amazing map control, he didn’t had discordance and never committed to chases too much, we finished 4 gens and the last 3 were each on the other side of the map, yet from a 0k with 1 gen left he managed to get a 4k with 1 gen left.
---
We didn’t make too many mistakes either, he just wouldn’t let us finish our generators, and sometimes he would slug instead of hooking just to go back and check on my generator. He eventually killed me and hooked me in the basement, saw a guy healing with BBQ went after him downed him, and then from all the way across the map went back to the killer shack (where the basement was) and found the last one and hooked him. And he won, with the fucking cannibal on one of the worst maps for killers.
---
So what gets me off gens? Him running towards me every 30 seconds to make sure we don’t finish gens.
---
Your entitled to your opinion, doesn't make it right.
---
Yeah if someone disconnects you can literally pull them back into the game. The process takes a unspecified amount of time though cause you have to wait for them to reconnect 
---
True, true. But were they projectile vomiting on people?
---
I punch claudette.
---
If anything, bringing a mori makes the game easier since you only have to down someone twice instead of 3 times. To play Killer is to desire an experience in schadenfreude. Sometimes the best way to feel good is to make someone else feel bad. However, survivors are given a number of mechanics and perks that allow them to counter this. While the majority of them are perfectly fine, some survivors grow cocky and toxic because of them, thus cultivating some survivors to become entitled and toxic, and before anyone says this isn’t true, Ochido built his whole career around this and his shithead fans continue to be like this.
---
Common misconception. Adding more people to a project, especially a software project, does not equal "going faster". Even if not taking things lik training/tutoring the new programmers into account, you quickly reach a point where you can't just add more manpower to a project task to get quicker results. At worst, you even increase the time the project takes by doing this, because now you have too many people working on the exact same thing.
---
IMO, it should only work for pallet stuns after d strike changes.
---
This is just them cutting corners though, keeping costs down. This map and the Clown map could be so much better as full unique maps.
---
^ This. Very much this. ^
---
We don't need a hospital at all. We have a Doctor and a Nurse on call.
---
Is it just me or are the new killer's perks kinda poopish ?
---
one transfers the terror radius
---
the other blocks gens for a little while then is permanently gone for the match
---
the  **Fright**  one is pretty nice to be fair though
---
Honestly it do be like that, a lot more than it should. 
---
Ohhh alright, I usually play survivor so I’m not familiar with all the killer perks
---
Big ass thicc Jane
---
That's why we're asking 😏
---
It's at the very top of the hot posts...
---
Achievement Unlocked!
---
- Kill a ghast using a ghast fireball
---
That would kinda defeat it's purpose 
---
omg now i can't unsee it
---
Depends, are they advantageous enough to want to save, for example if I save them does that put me at risk or are they even good enough to help even if I did. DBD is very much every person for themselves and I’m only going to cooperate when it’s advantageous for me. If I get hooked that’s usually my own fault and I don’t expect anyone to save me.
---
I know the feels
---
99% sure they're going to change Enduring. It's already like 66% less effective against DS on live servers.
---
First time I am seeing it too, looks off though being that big.
---
1.1 Yeah he can do that. Doesn't make him much better though as any killer with M&amp;A can do that.
---
1.2 Every killers is good with deadzones. Not just freddy.
---
3. If you are about 5 seconds away from a pallet and leatherface gets within non-lunge swing distance, you get downed. You cannot do anything that requires taking a hit against leatherface. Reving under pallet-When in a loop if you rev at the right time they have to drop the pallet or get sawed. turns certain loops into a lose-lose for the survivor.
---
7. then why are you arguing that freddy's mindgame is good? That's all it gives you at best. A free hit. And as someone who has put a lot of hours into trapper, I can tell you if you know what you are doing you will break ankles.
---
8. Myers' stealth is an inherent mindgame because you never know when he is gonna show up. The clutch EW3 pop is a thing too, not to mention farming stalk (or pretending to) at certain loops. Clown can use his bottle to force medium vaults, making every window unsafe, not to mention in a chase you can use it to track what survivors are doing (throw it at something, if they go there they scream, if not they don't). Not to mention it blurs the survivor's screen which can help with tricks. Freddy's mindgames outside of transition are standard for almost every killer.
---
9. I agree. But Ruin works, results breed tiers.
---
Switching task with freddy is risky because he cannot chase very well. You will lose time unless you get hooks ASAP.
---
Deadzones are good with every killer. Nurse and Billy are better for slugging. You can also heal someone way more times then you can unhook them. You do you.
---
What are you talking about ?? Is this some kind of troll?
---
A lot of my teammates think that way lol
---
But at least it's the anti-vaxx mom in the Entity's realm.
---
"normal" dbd porn, yep perfectly normal to have 3000 images of Trappers buttcheeks on your computer ;)
---
If it works the same as Rancor and The Doctor, then aura blocking doesn't work since they're not the same kind of aura. Calm Spirit would block the screams and completely counter it, though.
---
Yes. And it says a lot about you.
---
😂
---
This isn't how you use this meme
---
My dumbass thought corrupt intervention lasted the whole trial.
---
You see a spirit standing still? Go to a different loop. They never expect it :D
---
Did you really just compare camping a hook for 1 kill to completing an objective? The only objective a survivor has by the way.
---
It's posts like this that are regularly made in this sub that make my opinion on everyone here being some rank 16 scrub that just can't make it to rank 15 just that much more valid. 
---
Fuck, I had more than 1k hours put into this game before I joined this sub. I already had a decent idea on how to shut down loops as a killer and how to run them as a survivor. I already had more than a basic understanding of how this game operates. I now have over 3500 hours in this game and can end games before the first gen is done. Not a single thing in this game bothers me as much as simple actions like crouching or survivors doing the only thing they can do to escape bothers you so much. 
---
If more of you scrubs did that before joining a community or just lurked more before making your ignorant posts then maybe everyone would be having a better and more fun time in this game instead of griefing everyone in the game then coming on here to bitch and moan about it like a bunch of ignorant bitches.
---
Fright? 
---
Hehehe the new survivor perk when u sprint out of the locker infront if the killer he|she is stunned
---
15 seconds is definently not useless. If 3 people spawn together on a gen far away it would take them maybe 25 seconds to do it but with that perk theyre forced to either wait around for it to clear or just find another gen. Either way it stalls long enough and then mix ruin in and those gens will take forever at the start.
---
Except you don’t show an aura when in a locker. 
---
Not gonna lie, fun idea. 
---
Would it ever work, absolutly not.
---
Oh man that perk is gonna be heaven in the fog.
---
When I first saw the video, I thought surely it had to be a joke. The power is so random compared to every single other killer's power. I'm sure the killer will be fun to play and all, but seriously what group of people repeatedly okayed the literal vomit killer?
---
Wiki says 15 seconds.
---
To this day I still don't understand why people talk about the new locker perk specifically for Dwight, can someone explain?
---
I agree. My 4th would be rancor or haunted grounds though just for the extra toxicness
---
New perk but with M&amp;A and scratched mirror...this meme isn’t what OP thinks it is.....
---
Someone with sprint burst flashlight can still make it from medium distance and M&amp;A alone won’t be enough to reach 
---
i think it does, i played one match against a doctor and when i screamed i spent a token of distortion
---
now that i think about it, i remember that there is an addon of doc that allow him to see the aura of a survivor when madness increased the tier, maybe was that i'm not sure
---
GOD this bothered me so much. She's got the flattest ass in the goddamned game and people calling her THICC.
---
I laughed so hard... i couldn’t stop... xD
---
She has fat thicc and kate has thin thicc
---
People missing the fact she's getting called a hippo
---
Kate, Claudette, Huntress
---
Does M&amp;A affect the reach of Fright and the one where u give the obsessiob ur terror radius?
---
1) I doubt it will be any gen.  I'd bet its only the gen you complete.
---
2) The killer has to be tracking the scratches of the one particular survivor who has the perk at the moment a gen pops.  I don't think this confluence of events is frequent enough to make the perk very useful.
---
It could be that add on. I play as Doctor pretty often, but don't come across survivors with Distortion often enough to be certain.
---
Everyone's done it at least once.
---
Brother I’m buying legion tonight just because of that statement.
---
lies!
---
meg &gt; all
---
If you could just jump into a locker mid-chase and stun - then yes
---
But since you need some time in the locker before the perk activates - not so much.
---
There will be fun plays with Quick and Quiet though. If you need longer than 3 seconds to realize the guy went into the locker - the stun is well deserved. 
---
"Ah the tall butts of the early 90's"
---
I couldn’t find the thread 😢
---
I don’t think any side deserves to win a hatch standoff. As killer, I let the survivor go most of the time, unless I’m in desperate need of BP and I brought a BP offering
---
Can't wait to see his plague vids
---
*silently points out the anti-vision perk that came with Jeff* 
---
I personally think the scream perk might mesh well with BBQ
---
My suggestions for trapper boi:
---
All the traps start activated at the beginning of the match.
---
Traoa not longer afect the traper.
---
The trapper starts the game with more than one trap.
---
When a survivor gets trapped, the trapper gains more terror r and increase move speed. Also the scape process gets skill checks. 
---
So happy people are using this format, it's too good.
---
No arguing I just said I'm glad at least I can think their using xbox because I use xbox
---
For adults it is disgusting. Looks like kids like it. 
---
Same, expect to get hit? Don’t throw it down. If the killer misses that’s even better because you can keep looping
---
I think distressing is 100% core for Doc, specially if you use the "Calm" notes. The range in which you can apply your madness is literally insane. 
---
Borrowed Time+Head On.  The basement just won't be what it used to be.
---
I think CI will do a lot of good for the Hag. It sounds great to deny half of the map in the start and set up your side with traps but all comes down in the end how long CI will last.
---
There's something about this image that is extremely funny to me and I'm trying to figure out what it is
---
Looking at the timer in the footage in yesterdays video, it is between 80 to 120 seconds. Also, the affected generators have a white aura
---
You won’t be so rude when his fugly face head on’s your ass after spending the whole game in a locker
---
So that's how one plays Legion. I see now. Ty!!! 
---
I'm planning on doing this a ton.  Post up in a locker and if a friend gets chased have them run by a locker and get the stun.
---
Yes the perks are affected by the terror radius, but M&amp;A will not be that big of a net with Myers or hag as they both have low radius for their base to begin with hence why this meme is a real head scratcher... scratched mirror though will be GG EZ on Hospital so not to bad of a trade off in situational stuff 
---
Corrupt Intervention sounds pretty good with discordance! 
---
Imagine Michael fucking waving at you from a distance lmao that would be great
---
It takes him forever to even hit you 4 times 
---
Well there is a reason. He’s angry. He probably exaggerated an element. This (salt) post doesn’t have enough info.
---
Just adjusted the lighting on the map to be either brighter or darker. The devs want full control over how maps are lit now so they removed them. But since the engine update, the lighting in the game has been altered on its own anyway lol. 
---
You can juke legion. You can pallet juke him, he has no lunge, he can't even kill you fast if he does hit you anywqy. 
---
Whats the point of Infectious Fright if you don't have terror radius?
---
*as your body flies across the map, you down all your teammates, resulting in 3 reports*
---
I get your point but I’m still freaking out on virginitiphobia. I wanna see someone say that I’m more scared of rape than any normal person would be.
---
um no, this meme doesnt work like this
---
Because this Game is biased towards survivors in normal play as it's not fair to killers most of the time 
---
Hmmm marry Nea, because she is Bae. Punch Bill, no Bill hate just he is the least lucky survivor when I am killer. Kiss...hell I don't know. 
---
Myers has 32m terror radius with Evil Within III.
---
Thats the whole point is that you hit Evil Within III and murder everybody.
---
Infectious Fright isn't an aura its a scream.
---
I can just see how this got thought of.. game designer is having writers block and is sick. Throws up and is like "my God..honey, hand me my notebook.." 
---
"Honey, you threw up on your notebook"
---
"This is all great!
---
I’ve been on the hook since one gen was left. A bit of context that I didn’t add. 
---
Adults too!
---
Who cares?
---
How about no
---
Two things wrong- this isn’t how you use the meme format and BLOOD WARDEN DOESNT FUCKING WORK EVER!
---
Off topic but Meg looks like she is either giving birth to a large animal or her vibrating anal plug just got turned up to 12.
---
I agree, I feel like letting the survivor perks be shared, made all the survivors basically just skins vs. an important choice between abilities. Like, in the limited time, that I play killer you have to learn to be good with a whole different set of movements instead of just throwing a perk on it as a crutch. I don’t think they could back out of having the perks shared though, it’s been implemented too long. 
---
Because people can’t handle a suggestive joke about Asians. That or how I worded my last sentence. I was just seeing how old this guy was. 
---
This sub does this shit
---
Sore loser then.
---
Would liked to have seen footage of this, salty killers brighten up my day haha 
---
David, David, Myers.
---
I was wondering how this would work with doc and madness! Also could be amazing for Pig and Myers
---
Nice list, I would be extremely scared against anyone, but what would be very terrifying is getting put in one of those meat hooks. 
---
The brown cosmetic the OP one. You can deal with the P3 cosmetic
---
Yeah the problem I see the most that Survs have with Nurse and now with Legion is that they refuse to change their gamestyle. 
---
They are used to the rush meta couse it works on all the other killers so well.   
---
Loop them to death and do the gens asap.   
---
Running away and looping through windows and pallets is much better than playing stealthy 
---
if you really wanna counter a nurse or a legion you just play stealthy !   
---
Her powers are useless if she cant find you 
---
BBQ only works after a hook and in the range. And even if she sees you , she only gets an information where you WERE. So much can happen in that time until she reaches that location 
---
And the Terror Radius of Legion being big means nothing if he just chases one down, or if he starts chasing everyone equaly to hurt them he wont be a problem anyway since that version of legion is weak 
---
So just stop sticking firm to your pallet and loop into gen rush strat and adapt to the killer and game. 
---
Play stealthy, play sneaky. 
---
alright that’s just adorable.
---
Appreciate ya, samakkins! :)
---
Big Bertha, the drill in Seattle, was a disaster lmao
---
You mean the joke the devs made in the announcement stream? Big ol co-inkidink
---
He didn’t even take a pic of the points and escapes/kills. This guy definitely got the 0k
---
I am HOOKED on you
---
Yep Kate is the best.
---
Jesus mami 
---
I think they tried to avoid magical so it wouldn't be seen as them dismissing cultures/religions/practices/beliefs as 'magic' etc. 
---
No offense but her ass looks like if Laurie had implants lol.
---
Wow before you full screen this and see the asterisk this is some weird shit.
---
n-no u!
---
welp it is a horror game... sort of...
---
I mean i have about 40 hours of footage to go through, but i'm evading killers left and right with it.
---
Meg consumes you 
---
Atomic anus
---
Oh wait what?  I just always like thinking Big Bertha was someone athletic, I didn’t actually know it was a disaster...  Sorry, didn’t mean to be insensitive...
---
I'm fine with my boy david getting sliced, cut, stabbed, chainsawed etc
---
I don't wanna see him fucking vomit. That's disguisting
---
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks she looks like a man.
---
That's what makes it cool
---
*Laughs in Iron Maiden*
---
She is so ugly, what the fuck are these memes. You all like she was cute / beautiful. She looks like an unnatractive 40 something school counselor who eat chips alone with her cat at night. The fuck.

When did I say that all other department should stop working? Wtf. I’m only saying that they should have a break on the dlc’s and work on what they have. 
---
I saw somewhere that they are going to give more 4 killers this year (being one of them the Plague). Idk if this is true but it would be better to have only 2 or 3 killers and fix the game
---
Change perverts to the entire community
---
You act as if I add one killer they all get stronger. That’s just wrong. Killers don’t nerf perks. A power weakens a survivor in a way or strengthens the killer.
---
I believe in you

You can just chill there until Head on comes out.  See you in the ptb!

I mean, you could always mute them in that case, it could also be VOIP in pre &amp; post-game chat. The benefits over-ride the drawbacks.

well lucky for you it looks like she might puke blood after she upgrades her power from a corrupted fountain. just a guess though.

What does Head On do?

I hate bitchy entitled survivor mains as much as the next killer main, but what the fuck else do you expect survivors to do? It's their job to do gens, yours is to protect gens and kill them.

This perk is memetier its awful

Pretty sure it’s the Supernatural font.

The L4D2 community has always been pretty toxic tbh. I have over 4k hours put in the game so I think I've seen pretty much everything.
---
The few remaining players left (I think the game still has about 15k players online, in a good day, maybe more) are promod/confogl wannabes with very little tolerance for newbs. Oh and they're still apparently stuck in 2012 where shooting troll group invites to strangers was considered "funny".

When claudetter T-bags and then jumps into the hatch: CLAUDETTE YOU SLIME!
---
In a very fast paced game particularly an fps like CoD or Overwatch, the difference between 100 and 200 ping is huge and makes dramatic differences on who kills who first and various things like that.  In DbD, having a pallet flip/window vault happen slightly later can be frustrating but is able to be accounted for and played around without it changing the gameplay very much at all. There are very few precise timings required compared to other games, and skill checks aren't impacted at all.  Even on PC, I'm pretty content with 200 ping lobbies even if it means I'm more likely to get hit through a pallet if I go for that greedy extra loop.
---
Legion isn’t claimed to be OP. He is basically just unbeatable in chase. Doesn’t matter how you long you can prolong a chase against him; If they want you down, you’ll go down no matter what and it doesn’t really require skill. Besides, it’s an just annoying to have to mend all the time if they don’t tunnel
---
It would still be good on hag or trapper to give them time to set up their traps if survivors are gonna hang out near incompletable generators.
---
Dont blame the console, the internet is the problem.
---
Y’all motherfuckas need a thing called ****JESUS****
---
Nurse and Billy are the same? They both can end a chase super quickly if they want 
---
I used to do laundry between matches. So I would start afk in a lot of matches. With spirit it was causing players to be confused and I would get post game salt because they had no idea what was Going on.
---
legion is ghostface and the spirit is the lady from the grudge. they are not licenced killers because beh bought the dbd rights from starbreeze. that is my tin foil hat theory. i’d like to see jason in chapter 13 tho. then we have the pop culture legends under one roof. the others are not iconic enough imo. maybe I am just too old. 😂
---
Yes. But there’s a difference. Nurse might be broken if the player has fully mastered her, but that requires tons of skill. Billy is easier than Nurse and probably the best killer after Nurse but he still requires skill and can be looped. Legion requires no skill and is hard to juke (other than window tagging which only prolongs a chase most of the time before he realises) 
---
I always give my fellow Survivors a Hello t-bag when I first come across them in a match, not many of my fellow Survivors have Hello t-bagged back... Uncouth louts. 
---
But that doesn't make sense. It wouldn't fit. But if we could snag some Never Sleep Pills from The Legion, that would work

I'm pretty sure its just John Romero. I don't see the genderbend.

I would add my personal 'so frightened and confused at the same time that I'd probably just stand there with an open mouth' tier:

Doctor. tall, crazy eyes, zaps electricity around, whilst almost constantly laughing. I think my brain would just be a constant WTF neon sign and I would be so flabbergasted by his very appearance that I would never escape a match with him as a killer.
---
It also doesn't make it wrong
---
These show you how  well you did during the match,  this will increase or decrease your rank  
---
Provided the 4 gens are actually close enough to one another, which they rarely, if at all are. And even then, that's the exact same as saying everyone always 3 gen strats
---
115 man
---
It’s because D-Strike has been nerfed, and it’s a way of attacking the killer (anything remotely like that seems to be very popular) everyone is going to switch to head on. And assist in a chase? If you just hop in a locker the killer will grab you before it’s even remotely charged up.
---
I don't care but people are losing their minds about Decisive Strike and this is arguably stronger.  I don't mind DS personally.
---
Palettes can be broken after you drop them.  Lockers can't.
---
Top 10 Anime quotes of 2019
---
It's a stun pretty much every time they jump into a locker. You essentially get d-struck every single chase, because this perk would be so predominant that no exhaustion perk could keep up.
---
A 3 second charge time to prevent it from being used as a locker juke tool, giving it a more niche use than becoming the singular strongest perk in the game is completely acceptable
---
You can juke him at pallets as well because he Dashs a bit forward. He also has a self stun and needs to hit alot to down aomone. Maybe I dont see the problem 
---
Wait wait wait wait.
---
I thought those were bats. 
---
Yo what perk is that?? Is that photoshopped? 
---
Don't capitalize survivor. It's lower case. Don't correct other people's grammar and spelling if you suck at it too. 
---
 BLERRRRRGH
---
Oh my god it's pencil penis! Can I have your Autograph?!
---
Unpopular opinion : New survivor isn't as hot as everyone says
---
It's so demoralizing when you hear like two or three gens activate at once. 
---
That's part of why I run Surveillance. 
---
Guess it wasn't only him afterall
---
Spirit is the 2nd best killer in the game, right behind Nurse. Power is extremely easy to use and master. It's easy to find them just by hearing and scratches, making for chases that last 30 seconds at the MOST.
---
Looks like that caveman spongebob meme
---
Why was this downvoted? You're right 
---
Theres a radius for it. Fake out run towards it and quickly back off and its wasted. And no not every time they get in a locker in a chase. Theres a timer that needs to be burned down. Survivors arent that good to actually pull it off everytime. You may get a few good people who do but people will mess it up all the time. There will be a mind game based around it.
---
Corrupt intervention won't be all that strong on most killers (not sure tho, it's somewhat dependent on the duration it'll have)
---
Most killers find survivors by catching them doing objectives, the match taking X seconds longer  isn't useful if the survivors can just hide for the duration.
---
On certain killers it probably will be pretty good though, Hag and Trapper will potentially be able to set up more traps as they don't have to patrol the 3 far gens, Doctor has an easy time finding survivors as well, so he too will be able to make good use of the perk in early-game. 
---
 On many other killers though (who need to just normally find survivors in early game) it would not be very strong, it's a chance to get into a chase a few seconds earlier, but it's also a chance for survivors to take out totems while the killer isn't patrolling the area where gens are locked. 
---
everyone is 2 busy looking at the other parts of the character.
---
Iron maiden doesnt have a scream, it just shows your aura to the killer when exiting a locker without a scream
---
to be honest the killer is better looking 
---
Survivors don't have the right to even touch generators anymore...
---
Take a Doctor or Hillbilly.
---
Hex:Ruins
---
Overcharge
---
Corrupt Intervention and (maybe) Discordance...
---
And there you go...
---
hmm, I was sure I screamed when leaving a locker and it had iron maiden. Maby I'm just loosing it? ohh well.
---
You are telling me that the people make the new killers are not the same that could work on a rework for freddy? 
---
They're exhausted after. I honestly think both sides should have perks to fight the other. Otherwise this game is just going to continue down the shit spiral where survivors wont play and queue times will be even longer than now. Give powers to both so people have options because the game is getting so boring playing killer and survivor. Variety is the spice of life.
---
You can indeed juke a Legion (like I said), but you’ll go down if he wants you to. As I said, doesn’t matter how long it takes. He is not OP but in a 1v1 the survivor won’t win unless the killer is an absolute potato
---
Head on: apply directly to the forehead
---
dude imagine her running when she's insane from the doctor 
---
there is a fifty fifty she might be latina or italian
---
Cute
---
 I was about to say Freddy should be higher, but you raise a fair point about probably not having all his movie powers. After all the main horror he gives off is the literal impossibility to escape but that’s moot in DBD. 
---
Even without the information some of them appear weak.
---
We already know that you have to wait 3 seconds in the locker to stun the killer, and that mega gimmicky effect causes exhaustion for whatever reason. It's good that we voice our concern about it now so that they are more likely to improve it on the ptb. The sooner we say something about it the better.
---
Not leaving the scratch marks after doing a gen is a very minor effect, so the perk might not be awful but it's just not strong.
---
The obsession perk is painfully situational and useless if they have comms.
---

Same here. I want to play against a new Killer, but I have no control over how nauseous vomit makes me. I hate that I'll probably have to DC against this Killer.
---
Surely it happened at least a few times.
---
some people were just never taught any manners
---
Oh no how dare those survivors do the only objective they have!
---
do those selfish survivors also run from you instead of patiently waiting by the hook to let you kill them?
---
those bastards! 
---
She fit his entire locker in her ass
---
Except OP was the top survivor and not the killer... 
---
Censer is a type of Incense Burner, so I guess they're going to call it the general umbrella term rather than the specific one. Censer sounds cooler though.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that 
---
I always understood it as the 3 furthest from the center, so survivors are forced to stay closer to the middle.
---
The trapper in the last slot, *by the entity ! Why am I hard ?*
---
!!!! I KNOW
---
But they still are the same skill or not. 
---
Just imagine a wall between the middle pillars. If you cross it, the trap activates. If you manage to pass throw it (by killer dropping you) or you get trapped aftrr it, you can escape. It's kinda situational.
---
it is a phobia lmfao
---
An easy google or youtube search could fix that
---
But you decide to make a stupid post
---
I don't see the issue. It's a horror game troupe. It was expected at some point. And it works with the aesthetics of a plague. You want butterfly powers in your horror game?
---
It's not about the strength of the Legion. It's about how spectacularly unfun they are to face. They're just obnoxious. You won't get away from a Legion that wants you down, and Deep Wound is, as I said, an obnoxious mechanic. Yes, people paid money for the DLC, and I bet most of those people wouldn't pay that money for it again. This is as close to a community consensus on a game update that I've ever seen. Legion is almost unanimously reviled. 
---
When they do teabag back: 
---
Ah Rosie I love this boy!
---
cute!!
---
Dark Devotion: kind of confused about why this is an obsession perk, but since it is; that *could* mean the duration will be long, in which case it can be good. I hope Freddy's and Huntress' lullabies will transfer, bc if not it will be useless on them.
---
Might be a very decent perk for some killers if the duration is good. 
---
 
---
It could be your internet
---
Dead by boredom
---
The Opportunity Cost is not worth it so it seems. I can see why you'd come to that conclusion but it's just better to keep busy most of the trial. 
---
im consistently rank 1 as survivor. albeit i tend to not be there to see if other survivors do mind games, most of the time, they get downed instantly. so i assume not. i get flashlight saves very rarely. not for me personally, but they rarely happen in the game at all. even if people have flashlights. i see flash light saves once every 30 hours maybe
---
as a killer my peak and the rank im usually at is 4. i have played against a million rank 1 players though. most of them are so mediocre, i get surprised when seeing they are rank 1. the most skillful thing they do is use infinites for their advantage. which really isnt difficult
---
Deep wound for LF i dont agree.
---
r/punpatrol put the pun down and put your hands behind your head sir
---
My god, I've never played a Dead Space game, but I'd be pissed off if it showed you a 30 second cutscene every time you died.
---
But... but I'm a Jeff player
---
So you know, Tar bottle currently doesn't work. They appear 'tarred' to the killer, but to survivors they're as bright as ever.
---
Counter point: no they wouldn't 
---
Arguable. Probably not a popular trope like clowns are, though The Exorcist is one of the examples I know of off the top of my head. Mostly since it's the most popular one and I think the one that started the trope. There's also the Boomers and Spitters from Left 4 Dead (Poor Bill can't get away from it anymore).
---
Just jump?

Awww. Shoot. I got my hopes up.

---
“Just hear me out Feng; what if we just gave that bitch and solid whack with this!?” 
---
“Claudette, the only thing that’s wack is that idea”
---
Maybe dont remember just know when the first started
---
The only time I have EVER had a hatch standoff as the killer was when I'd been trying for Adept Wraith for about 3 days, and the last Claudette had done nothing but hide all game. Otherwise I just hit them and let them go. Sometimes I'll go for a quick bait to see if they fall for it, but then after it's SMACK and gone. For Survivor, I will hold that standoff for as long as I can.
---
The killer sacrifices, what, 1500 points + like a tenth of the sacrifice emblem (if that), for the Survivor's 7k + 1-4 emblem survival emblem points (depending on how they played that match). Getting the 4k isn't that important.
---
Why was this posted?
---
I've said it once and I'll keep saying it. The Plague is the Splatoon killer. She just gets that green stuff everywhere.
---
Except your obsession, who you will never be able to see while it's active.
---
Also, it remains to be seen if the lullaby is also transferred. 
---
It reappeared plenty of times throughout the dark ages all the way to the renaissance, but most people view the 14th century as the worst outbreak.
---
That was quick...
---
Were you drunk when you wrote this?
---
If there's one thing I always appreciate in this game, it's those little moments of camaraderie.  
---
If there's one thing I enjoy entirely too much, it's sacrificing generator repair time with solo players to teabag, nod, and point at each other while working at a generator.  Double points to the teammates who correctly assess it as a game of chicken for when the killer inevitably bears down on the two/three/four of us.
---
Vomit girl, put your puke in the walk, head to toe, let your open sores talk.

Everything under a minute would be dogshit

Well i guess you didnt even read my comment. I guess you are just a ochido wanna be toxic survivor. Cool
---
Let’s go get a censer and lemme swing at you. Not even full strength - sure it’s not an axe but let’s not act like it wont be effective

If that’s broke, then use the Soap Green Add-on! It’ll just make it even harder for survivors to escape!

Garbage ideas. Especially the first one good grief 
---
1. 2 UTP cables with an RJ45 extender in your hand, this way you don't have to pull it directly from the console.
---
2. 99% Bandwidth throttling the ports used by the game via an premise/virtual firewall or content gateway.
---
3. Controlling your routers QoS rules via mobile app to throttle the connection.
---
4. Tunneling your traffic through a VPN and switching servers during game will temporarily halt your connection.
---
I think the method is fine now. It would be too monotonous that every time you have an effect you can just find a machine. The Pig and now Purge use it so Freddy should be kept the same. Plus I think there’s a perk to do it yourself but I’ve never personally used it
---
[Yes, right, I'm the problem, not the guy who'd rather condemn and complain without making an attempt](https://twitter.com/ScottTheGoon/status/1102943164980056064)
---
this is the best qoute i have seen on this screenshot
---
I personally would rather have the scratch mark deal like me and some friends discussed. You'd have to be near the killer to build it up, and you can activate it whenever you want but only for a few seconds. 
---
On Freddy or doctor
---
That won't work very well. Survivors will know when infectious fright triggers (bc they scream) and then leg it while you're still recovering from the hit. Unless you're playing Nurse you most likely won't get any worthwhile chases out of this (they have a big head start and you still got a survivor on the ground waiting to get recovered)
---
Infectious Fright will mostly just be a way to avoid flashlight and pallet saves. 
---
It made you remember it tho

Ah yes, just hide from BBQ, Rancor, and Whispers. Not to mention the non meta perks like Discordance, Bitter Murmur, Spies From The Shadows, or Iron Maiden, and if you're already injured, you have to deal with Stridor, Nurse's, Bloodhound, and Sloppy Butcher!
---
Also just never do gens cos then the killer will find you. Not to mention that Legion's ability LITERALLY REVEALS YOUR POSITION.
---
I saw this in the comments of the teaser
---
Several crouched after pallet drop: I am scum

Rng based characters are always going to be unreliable. I think that less rng is something in general is something that should be worked towards.
---
That just made my day
---
yes
---
I mean, not really? Legion has been the only “weak” killer they’ve released and even then, they still easily 4K. We don’t know about the Plague yet. It’ll depend on how her sickness works but she has the potential to be very strong. 
---
Only if you use Legion in a certain way
---
It’s always nice to see teabaggers get humiliated. 
---
Oh my god... Ive never regretted clicking on a link that much before
---
Actually it does have counterplay. Dont walk into the locker lol. Bait a walk foward for them to jump out then just smack. It makes more sense for it to have no cooldown. If it has a cooldown what am i supposed to do have someone run to my locker so i can stun them? Wouldnt that require comms which the devs are actively against? Or am i supposed to just sit in the locker with the off chance a killer will check it then maybe stun them?Its terra bad with the cooldown and without the CD its mediocre. Besides it give survivors the choice if they want a stun as their exhaustion or a mobility option which i think is a nice change for a survivor build.
---
Crouching agaisnt the locker your friend is hiding in when the killers around = I'm a massive asshole
---
I only play on PS4 and its pretty awesome, but since you’re coming from PC you’ll feel a difference in frame rate and such. I played a couple of matches on my brother in laws PC and I can see why people say it’s the best platform to play this game on
---
Marry Dwight, Punch Quentin, Kiss Anna
---
Yes im playing it right now
---
Sure 👌
---
It would completely nerf any perk that has a hard counter.  This is bad.
---
Feng got spinal problems 
---
This makes sense for the Trapper, but I don't see why it's necessary for the Trapper, since you're almost always placing traps outside if a chase. It just makes thing tedious, although it's still better than the default.
---
Okay, sarcasm aside. Have any suggestion to help a killer slow the game down. Others are giving tips like map control etc. As a survivor, what keeps you from working on gens? What has a killer done in the past the kept you on your toes. 
---
This is the one I was looking for 
---
It might have to be paired with perk(s) that help you find people in the beginning, like Whispers or Spies from the Shadows.

How does a Latina make a white Girl

Why? What's wrong with allowing people to counter and prepare pre-game?

VOIP would of course have options for muting and whatnot.
---
And the chase rework could make plenty of things more interesting, and namely: Fix the moonwalking Legion stuff.
---
Not gonna lie, I don’t know how I missed that :/
---
QQ
---
I think it's a little too easy to rank as survivor. I started playing DbD at rank 20 (obviously) and made it to rank 4 in less than three weeks and that was just when I started playing the game. I also think it's so stupid that the rank resets to a lower rank at the end of every season. It just ends up with you getting matched with a killer who's most likely a lower rank than you which makes the game really unfair for people who genuinly are in lower ranks.
---
This wouldn't change very much. He still has the same problems he does now. These are just bandaid solutions.
---
Genetics? Lol stop over thinking it. 
---
That would kind of suck for Bill and Laurie and I imagine some others. Killers would know to pick him up instantly and to dribble her (or leave her on the ground with the new DS) so those perks would never get used.
---
Yes!! 
---
That’s what I’m hoping for though haha
---
I was thinking of a fun memey build. 
---
So like, the new perk+ bbq + knockout+ deerstalker and you just slug everyone and hook them.
---
Swf are even better because almost 90% of the time, even with a good rank 1 team, they will scramble when I start knocking 
---
I have no doubts I would kill them all, I say that because I do it all the time with way more loose and wonky ways to play lol
---
Hell even if I didn’t use the meme build and just had the bbq and new perk, I’d still like it because I’d chase one down them, see a scream or not. If not then hook, if I see a scream nearby, I WILL find them, I have no doubts. And I will down them, now that takes at least 2 people out of the game atm, a third would have to join if they hope to rescue a teammate, the 4th may be doing a gen, but if I have ruin (which I always do) and other such perks, it’ll be nice. Then once I down that screamer, I either see more screams or I don’t, if not we hook and bbq. If the original downed person is close enough to the second guy I down, we may see a scream alerting if a revive, if not we are clear. If not bbq will also let me know if someone is going for a heal or not.
---
Idk, but I personally see many uses for this perk lol.  
---
I love this! This chapter is going to have so much meme potential!
---
the spriti was released weak, the clown was released weak, the pig was released weak, freddy was released weak, the doctor was released weak...
---
Don't Gen rush then we will see.

Me too

&gt; have you seen Claudette?
---
Why do you need all the perks? Pick a few you like and spend you BP on them. 
---
Not even concerned about The Plague, but the killer after her is weak imo
---
Everyone would dodge lobbies....especially if you play killers people do not like Nurse and Billy.  Think about it for like 1 second
---
Because it doesn’t make sense. If the killer can’t get any hooks or doesn’t chase me, of course I’m going to be on gens. I don’t have anyone to heal or rescue. If I brought an item in, like a medkit and haven’t used it yet, why the hell am I expected to be searching through chests? These side objectives don’t exactly give much BP. As a solo player, I will cleanse a dull if I come across it but I’m not going to search for them. People have suggested a totem counter to give an incentive for people to search for dulls and it’s been shot down by killers. Ok, I guess I’ll just keep doing gens then!
---
The plague isn’t exclusive to those times

Doctor: "Oh great, The Game 2.0!"
---
Hey, how's it going?
---
I havent seen any stats from behavior that indicates SWF to be unbalanced. Yes if you have a team of the best players in the game all team up like Marth does then it can be but that is like saying the Basket in the NBA is too low because Lebron or Giannis can dunk too easily. 
---
Do you have any actually data to support the claim that SWF is unbalanced or are you getting data from Tournament caliber winning streamer teams?
---
Most SWF groups are not basically SEAL team caliber with milisecond precision. Rather, most SWF is like this:
---
Player 1: "Ahhhhhh the Killer is after me"
---
Player 2: "Noooo don't lead them near me too!!!"
---
Player 3: "Where is the Killer?"
---
Player 1: "The Killer and I are somewhere near a bunch of trees"
---
Player 1: "OK, I'm down, at least I made him chase me for 10 seconds"
---
I agree SWF's often make really bad plays, but if they're competent this will not be very effective, gen rush mostly negates the perk, and it's really mostly just good against altruistic survivor teams.
---
If you do want to use this perk though, it could be a lot of fun with the right build, hell running around with Myers with biggest possible terror Radius in EW3 (M&amp;A, Distressing and dead rabbit) would probably be great fun.

I like how Feng's model looks like she's squinting with a sour kind of look when she looks straight up like that. Normally they do it when I land a window hit they thought they were going to make. It's cute.
---
Would you rather people dodge lobbies immediately or spend 10 minutes getting into a game only to be left out to dry by survivors who aren't willing to just take the loss so you're left with 1/2/3 survivors to kill or have to take on the killer at a disadvantage?
---
The very nature of the game ensures that the killer will always have some form of advantage, people DCing over a killer are dumbasses either way.
---
What achievement?
---
And anything over makes it mandatory... Shrug.  Mine is obviously low- but I’m thinking of it not changing the pacing too much, since I feel if were allowed to slow it down this much, the nerfed survivor perks like self-care become heavier nerfs. Could be wrong , I’d say maybe even 30-45-60
---
GAME OVER
---
&gt;Allow all players in a lobby to see abilities, perks and add-ons on both sides.

I love how we figure out ways to communicate without words, especially when it's a killer who has no emotes and needs them and survivor.
---
A meta perk that is run by almost everyone right next to ruin. There is no incentive to run ds or head-on if the killer has enduring. All those conditions met just to delay getting hit for an extra second. Keep in mind they lowered the stun time for DS too. 
---
It should be for pallets only imo. 
---
Only BBQ, WGLF and Offerings award post-game bloodpoints. Everything else is ingame.
---
Okay, but why is rng and trapping himself necessary parts of his kit? Having the traps be rng based doesn't even make sense from an in-universe standpoint. You don't just get lucky and pull your leg out of the trap, you have to slowly pry it open to the point where you can take your leg out. Being able to chose which survivors to take and which to leave is the entire point, and I don't see how it detracts from his design.
---
The Trapper getting stuck in his trap isn't anything like the Hillbilly's stun. The Hillbilly's stun rewards survivors for out playing you, but the Trappers stun only punishes yourself. Lets say that you have someone in the basement and you trap the top of the steps, then down someone bring them back, and now you can't take them down. It punishes you for setting the traps, and not in a way that actually balances the ability like it does for the Hillbilly. It prevents you from saturating the area, but that's something that I've already addressed. It's just a needless arbitrary thing that is annoying for the Trapper to have to deal with but other than that has little no impact on the match.
---
And the problem with visibility is really only a problem because of how long it takes set up. If you can set up quicker, and get more traps out, the visibility of traps becomes less relevant.
---
It is a strange one, as some people have "linked it" with latency prior to loading screens too, apparently...

Evil Incarnate

Big oof
---
I never said that. There isn't much focus on a disgusting/nasty aesthetic in this game. Sure Clown is like, obese and grotesque, but nothing in the game really compares to a character running around vomiting on people. I know the exorcist did it blah blah, I just don't think it fits DbD very well that's all
---
I'm hoping the new matchmaking system or at the very least dedicated servers fixes it.
---
Like always BBQ and Ruin.    
---
Other than that Discordance, Rancor/Bitter Murmur for tracking.    
---
And I personally think Make your Choice and Monitor and Abuse (Because you see survivors outside your terror radius and your terror radius is small to begin with)

To be fair, Spirit was trash (or, at least more mid tier) in the PTB and at release, she required some buffs to bring her up to where she is at today. Mostly it involved mindgaming with her power and making it so her cooldown was shorter if she didn't use her full duration phase walk.
---
Very possible, thought it was the trailer Claudette mentionned in the characters list on the dbd wiki

I would rather buy Asian fast food 🥘 from Feng’s cousin than eat Pizzas 🍕 delivered by scary cat Dwight. It would be all ruined from hiding in lockers and trying to avoid the killer.
---
? I don’t know how to answer this question 
---
Only if it says that you gain a bonus does it give additional bloodpoints. All perks except BBQ and WGLF have the text "more BP for actions in \[x\] category", meaning that during the trial actions are rewarded with more BP, but not beyond the 8000BP cap for each category.
---
someone put time into making this
---
1) he's at potato ranks
---
2) some people are just better at different things
---
As an aside, as a bit of a counter anecdote, I've reconnected with an old friend via SWF recently. He eventually began trying to play on his own as well and gave killer a shot. Told me it was too difficult and overwhelming and so he stopped. Totally fine. But now he goes on the same rants about killers being unfair this subreddit always goes on and refuses to try out the ones he complains about himself to see what it's actually like to play killers

Hag is far from second best, does not have mid chase pressure making her an M1 killer, she has worse loop pressure than clown

No offence taken if Survivors choose not to retort, lol.

Eh, this is like saying genrush isn't fair because, you can't chase all the survivors at once. Not really playing DbD, just holding left-click on a gen. Standing still is a mindgame. If the survivor calls her bluff and keeps running, she's only wasted time and gained nothing, especially if she's not running addon for faster charge up.
---
Prayer Beads I will give you though, it should work more like a T1 Myers, the phase sound should be reduced to 2 or 3 meters so she can't stand behind you invisible with you having no idea, she should have to rush in and go with instinct for the side of the gen she thinks the survivor is on. 
---
The people who are best at this game play both sides because it allows you to get inside the mind of your opponent.
---
Yes i can
---
I appreciate the meme answer. Still Legion is awfully designed and I hope they change him in several ways.
---
It's not like the killers don't have more ways to dick over survivors 
---
than survivors do.
---
Moris, facecamping, insidious camping, franklings items camping, prayer beads, instasaw, leaving them on the floor to bleed out, bodyblocking them in the corner, bodyblocking boxes to blow up the pig trap, iri head, tombstone piece and others.
---
I never get it when the killers complain about in-game toxicity, what they are doing to us is nowhere near as annoying as what we can do to them.
---
Welp.
---
I'm not sure how that's relevant to my comment, but yeah

A question for those that own the game on both console and PC. What are they key major differences asides frames/graphics/lag? I play or played a lot on Xbox, but switched to PC and just re-purchased the game. DL’ing rn so just wanted a heads up if there are any differences or things I should know before jumping in. 
---
Claudette default dancing after a pallet stun will actually make me cower in fear and confusion so I say maybe no.

---
You literally said he refuses to try playing killer to understand how they work. I said people who do play killer and survivor learn how to be better at the game because they have a better perspective.
---
I dont know how I can be anymore relevant to your comment.

Yes, you throw a toddler tantrum and because of that he will succumb to your every wish, I'm sure.

There was a plague outbreak un Madagascar a few years ago.

Used to happen on PlayStation. Haven't seen it on there lately. But that's probably cause I wind up looking for a killer forever.
---
Orrrrrrrrrrr he played a camping piece of babysit.  There's a ton of them out there.  What's so difficult to believe about this lol?  He strike a nerve or something?  Do you yourself play scummy?
---
Tell her that you're down with the sickness as well as the T H I C C N E S S of that juicy new survivor 😩👌🏼💦
---
I mean I have my concerns, but they are all withheld until at least the PTB comes out. All these perks and mechanics can go either way depending entirely on numbers.
---
 Dark devotion can be completely worthless or part of a viable stealth build depending on how long the TR transfer lasts.
---
Corrupt intervention will be a shitty perk not worth running or a good early game stall depending entirely on how long it lasts.
---
Head on can be either completely worthless or somewhat useful depending on the range of the stun.
---
Poised is shit
---
Solidarity seems like it could be ok if it's per health state healed and not full heals
---
and overall we gotta know what sickness actually does before I personally pass judgment. Is it going to be similar to Legion where if you don't take care of the sickness you just die which can make a tunneling plague even more annoying than legion since she has range with her puke. Or is it just going to be various debuffs Ala Clown and Huntress' powers.
---
I don't have the utmost trust in BHVR to make even close to a balanced killer even after minor tweaks after the legion chapter so I do have my doubts.
---
Dwight is first in the select menu, many new players choose him so...
---
*Babylonian
---
I see Excella from RE5 
---
lol holy shit, yeah I didn’t play much around that time cause I hated freddy
---
I just see that as a niche to fill rather than a break of character to the game. As in, the game has no grotesque characters, but does now. I appreciate your view too tho, cus that also means she doesn't fit in that well. Imo any variety is good, but fair point!
---
I think it should just swap the sound, so you don’t hear it from away but you do hear it whilst in her terror radius, like when she was first released.
---
With or without ice

Miss Claudette, give me a flashlight.

R/emperorsnewmemes
---
1 They increased her trap setting speed so you can actually put traps while in a chase to stop a loop from happening and not give the survivor like 3 seconds of free time to run away.
---
2 They buffed her add ons, removed negative aspects of some of her add ons
---
3 People have learned how to play her better - you don't do full time chases, you set a lot of trap in one area and stay around that area. Do hit and run situations when the traps proc instead of going with the full chase since she doesn't have stuff to help her in a chase.
---
It's usually a signal that the killer is camping you, basically being a dick.
---
Orrrrr he just played against a baby piece of camping trash.  There are a bunch of toxic baby killers that play like this with ebony moris especially Wraiths.  I played against a Wraith that pulled the same shit a couple days ago.  Sounds like you play scummy and are just sticking up for your brethren or something.
---
Lol have you not heard of what is happening to DS?
---
yeah...
---
a THICC hippo oh yEaH dAMn BoY SHE THIIIIIIIIIII-
---
That's actually a decent concept but it should take time and be like pig where he can see all of the coffee pots but he should be able to do something to them either making you fall asleep or just breaking it so he's not even less powerful than he is now. Also it should only make 1 cup and he could have add ons to make them fall asleep earlier from the pots or less pots spawn for him
---
Susie is cute 
---
Okay, good to know : ) Thanks, buddy!
---
They did say that
---
They also said they're gonna do something with totems that we'll see in the PTB
---
Honestly I'm genuinely excited for this chapter. Aesthetically and lore-wise, Plague looks interesting, though I imagine her perks will suit Hag, Doctor or Myers perfectly.
---
Jane herself imo is pretty versatile; Solidarity merges with so altruistic builds, and both Poised (and to extend) Head On compliment stealth builds/perks and gen-rushing. She seems fun and I can't wait to try out different builds with her.
---
I play legion for two reasons
---
1. Susie
---
2. You can't be looped 
---
tfw you're one letter away from a really old racial slur.

Skill level and skill potential. It's way easier to play nurse with a mouse and keyboard than it is a controller. 
---
The devs might find out about it. You need to keep this a secret or else they will get nerfed just like the brand new part.
---
Spirit on mother’s cabin , thought I had Jules her. Caught me on the corner as SOON as I exhaled a “phew” . Nearly shit myself and made me yell over discord. Favourite game ever.

Oh nice! Thanks for the info. Glad I always run Urban Evasion after reading that.
---
I play Freddy with Rancor - the obsession will just assume it is Remember Me because they will not get a notification or ever see your aura, so they will be in for a huge surprise.
---
I explicitly said in-game toxicity, don't bring post game chat into this as both sides are guilty here. Separating survivors only doesn't mean anything when the other side is equally as bad at this.
---
&gt;I play legion exclusively to revel in the tears of salty assholes
---
Good for you I guess, you can be an asshole in a videogame if it suits you. Doesn't change the fact that Legion is awfully designed and doesn't belong in this game.
---
All of the things you've mentioned (besides going out of bounds, that's an exploit, report it) only hurt people with really fragile egos. None of those things affect your gameplay and if they are standing around teabagging/clicking they are wasting their time as they should be getting more distance instead. Use it to your advantage and just kill them.
---
What may that be? If you want just dm me it but I’m unaware of what the slur is. 
---
She'll eat your face.... Literally
---
Nurse is a killer who, in the right hands and with even ok add ons/perks, has no real counter play.
---
Good nurses don't really miss blinks, even through floors and corn fields, this means that chase=20 seconds to hook. Even the best SWF will lose 2-3 people to a decent nurse. A top tier nurse is basically unstoppable
---
Is school out in America? Are you that bored?
---
they both died?
---
&gt;it’s about them not having fun, and that’s why I consider him a balanced killer 
---
Good thing you are not part of the balance team
---
I think he meant punching meg
---
Tbh i think that anyone that kills a lot of people are serial killers. Patterns are for killlers that kill with a specific reason in mind, be it past traumas or whatever else. 
---
Reminder: you have to be actually good in the game before you can be toxic. Otherwise you look like a chromosome collector like these twats.
---
 Can't count the times i've had a 4 man swf try be toxic on me and then realise: "maybe if we all didn't run circles around a slug, we would get gens done and have something to actually be cocky about"

Gin Jockey: A white man who has had sex or is in a relationship with a black woman.

It's a discontinued slur so it's not like it means anything these days but yeah, fun fact I guess.
---
Not on account of a dumb stun perk. Promoting something as stupid as 'HE JUMPED IN A CLOSET, BETTER LEAVE' is the epitomy of braindead escape
---
Which is quite sad as the old ranking system was shit as well. They need to add an actual challenge to ranking up and a reward imo. 
---
Oh... Ok... You can proceed then
---
Yeah but it’s not fair for newer players. 
---
It has been bugged for a while along with other cosmetics. It's just how DbD works.
---
Or they injured themselves.
---
It's not very good though.
---
Or have it as it is. A niche perk, rather than a free stun
---
Same with "foggy day jacket" aka "dear havens just look at the time.... IT'S CLIPPING TIME"
---
Only the most obnoxious achievement in the game. 
---
I suppose if you count them both as having eyes and being seen from a slightly lowered perspective, then certainly.
---
But in terms of recognition, there's not much relation between the two. Hair, brow, eyebrows, eye color, nose, chin, cheek width, placement of features, even general size are all different.

---
why are you just reposting his content on the same sub? that doesnt even make sense
---
yes pls
---
I guess you will buy the killer then.. or level it. Good for you using your own mind and all.
---
Oh yeaaaah. I'm a bit of a hording scrub so I forgot all about that.
---
Unpopular(? I don't really know) opinion: Corrupt Intervention is fucking bad and should feel bad.
---
I mean there are definetly Killers who it's good on. Killers below 115% (Myers [T1], Huntress, debatably Hag), Killers with a set-up time (Trapper, Hag), or Killers who want Survivors to clump up (Doctor, Legion, Myers) can all make use out of it. But more often than not this perk may as well read "waste a perk slot because you're a baby Killer who can't track people and make it easier to 3-gen yourself."
---
I feel like the perk should activate every time a gen is done, and block the single furthest gen when it activates. It could work like a reverse Deja Vu for Killers, basically.
---
But maybe I'm just a salty Killer main who's underestimating the perk. At least The Plague's other two perks seem really good. "Shit your pants" looks like it has the potential to at least be B tier, and the fake Terror Radius perk opens up room for all sorts of shenanagins.
---
Yeah, weird spidey legs coming down and having fun with survivors, endlessly reassembling their corpses, that's where my immersion's at, but if killers have a life beyond what we see, goddamn, immersion ruined!
---
Kind of weird you posted it if you don't like it
---
I really enjoy all the contrasts the killer has, she's indeed dress in an ornamented gown, very pretty and all blabla but she's sick as hell and pukes like crazy lol Nice representation of a plague really, can't wait to read the full story of hers!
---
Blood Warden and NOED is a great combo on Freddy. Since after one door is opened, survivors will be confident enough they can rescue their hooked friends and escape before you put them in dream world. 
---
And that's when they understand you have Blood Warden and they are stuck with you :)
---
Enduring can be really usefull to do hits through pallets (and for Decisive Strike of course...)
---
Ruin can also make you win a few minutes more in the game. But you could choose to use Thanatophobia and slug survivors .
---
In the video a survivor was instadowned after being sick for a while so it’s possible that it even causes exposed if you don’t cleanse yourself for too long.
---
&gt; And not even American
---
So you are in school then. Now, how could I have figured that one out. 
---
I implore you to go and check the feed from even a day or two ago to find your answer. We get posts identical to this one pretty well every day. 
---
More like the Trappers gargantuan cock holy fuck.

Whoops didn’t see that. In terms of perks, any aura reading leeks would not exist, neither would skillcheck related perks.

ok, ask mcote to give u one
---
Nah work ended couple of hours ago little survivor. I guess I go and slaughter some of you pathetic little shit and then make dinner.
---
God this guy sounds boring af. If you don't like a meme, be an adult and just keep scrolling lol
---
If there is people around the hook it's not camping. It's obviously their fault. Stop putting words on my mouth. We both know what I was referring to.
---
he'll say no
---
Honestly I can’t wait to run this!
---
god yes
---
When in doubt, just google something like “dbd bloodpoints” and click on the link for the official wiki. It will list everything. If you scroll towards the bottom you will find the BP perks. It will usually say whether it’s awarded post trial 
---
If you say so- if you want to dilute it down to just jumping in the closet and not the survivors using means they have to not die - that’s on you , you’re allowed to not like the design. This is going to be niche at best, and used properly even less.
---
I think the opposite. On larger maps this means Survivors can't do gens that you physically can not reach. It makes the effective playing field (the area that players will actually be in) much smaller which makes it easier for the Killer to find Survivors.
---
On Red Forest chopping away the three gens on the other side of the goddamn universe reduces the effective size of the map by a solid 30% or so.
---
did they?
---
You are actually stupid, you must suck as a killer if you think survivors have it better 
---
(TydeTyme joke)
---
What about spirit? Has she killed anyone pre entity?
---
Thanks ! 
---
Dw I'm exactly like that with my toolboxes and medkits.

---
The scream is from the exposed status though same thing happens with make your choice
---
A good survivor can loop good nurses, Billy’s and mikes for long periods of time and can even with chases against but they cannot loop even below average legions in the same way. The second a legion chooses to commit to you, you basically have a timer put above your head saying you will go down in less than a minute with no counterplay. Now if you add franks mixtape onto that, it’s less than twenty seconds. 
---
I’m sorry to say, if you don’t get it by this message I don’t think you will understand until you play the game a bunch more.
---
I mean...puke is gross on the face of it, sure, but I've watched/read/listened more than enough horror with **WAY** grosser things so it's kind of small potatoes. Folks freaking out about it kind of makes me think people playing DBD aren't otherwise fans of the genre.  
---
Maybe look at the meme to see that it isn't a repost?
---
Not fair for bad players either but it doesn't matter if you can't find a match anyway.
---
I would assume he is, as it isn't a great post

Never had it happen. You hit them, they get the speed boost and zoom off. It's testable, but probably won't happen in normal play.

I get the feeling race relations would be a lot better if we put some effort into flowery slurs. You'd be offended, sure, but at the same time would have to golf clap for the ingenuity.
---
HAHAHAHAHHA you dumbasses always say that ochido was the cancer of the community
---
I KNEW she looked familiar !
---
I'm fairly skeptical 
---
Dishonored also had a lot of plague and plague rat stuff.
---
She can only use her power if it is fully charged, so the longer she uses her power the longer it takes for it to charge.
---
Is infinite lobbies on surviour are something which we have to adjust with or there is a fix ?
---
Hehe bee
---
The shit your pants perk.. will it be good on huntress ?
---
I feel like a proud dad 
---
You can escape dead inside
---
It used to be so much worse a year or so ago.  There used to be a thing where the same perk would continue showing up until you bought it at times.  I've literally had Spies from the Shadows 1 show up over 30 times consecutively before.
---
IM GONNA LINK IT
---
Oh I dotn play left 4 dead
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
It might be possible if you have the right speed/acc. addons, or if you trap them in a corner, meaning lots of bloodpoints.

Haha just tell me to fuck off like an adult.
---
My Hello T-Bagging Brother from another Mother.  
---
Hope to see you out there in The Fog.
---
I believe you're officially a serial killer after 3 murders
---
Your funny 😆 Not even creative but funny at least 
---
How about a crumb of semen, mi Lord?
---
Man I was pissed after seeing the awful response from most of the community,some were writing OP and and some were writing shit 
---
And I think most are surviours mains,I as a new player really appreciated the new perks and killer 
---
lmao it literally wont even work? do you guys not know what iron maiden is? 
---
Most likely not. The hum doesn't count as the terror radius, and she has a 20m base tr.
---
Terror radius things do not affect Huntress' humming. So while we are still unsure about the chapter, it is a safe assumption that the humming will be unaffected by this perk.
---
Again, this comment is a day old. You literally have to go out of your own way to find and reply to this comment.
---
Fuck off.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Uh, why would it be better on Myers, who has the smallest, near non-existent terror radius in the game generally? Doctor can have a massively huge terror radius and inflict madness with it, and combine that with infectious fright = gg. 
---
I swear its still like that
---
And any attempt to vault a pallet will break it in the process.
---
Since the singing is part of her terror radius, it’s safe to assume for now it will transfer all TR range and effects to the obsession. 
---
Hmm...okay then will try tho I suck at tracking and you never know a crouching Claudette near you for a flashlight
---
clown can end chases quickly which allows him to change objectives quickly too
---
leatherface is objectively worse than freddy as his power is nonexistent against good survivors and can't even apply pressue lmao
---
I’m a survivor main, and understand killers get just as frustrated about unintended, but available mechanics as I do (i.e. survivor body-blocking, killer face-camping, etc.)
---
but how can someone even compare gen-tapping and pallet looping to straight up having cheats like maphacks???
---
Tbh enduring should do nothing against head on but Iron Maiden can stay the same
---
lmao it's broken, you should have a little possibility of dying of a heart attack while being chased to compensate the 3 hits, 45 seconds of sprint is waaaaaaaaaaay too much buddy
---
Boo hoo, cry about it 
---
I don't think it will be the way you described because killers could abuse this and quickly so a 360 with their 9000dpi to quickly open the locker. 
---
I don't see it being much different to a pallet stun
---
I think he meant surviours hate spirit not us killers 
---
I love spirit ,I tried playing with her she's awesome and if I master my prediction ability.....but that won't happen but I can why surviours hate her as she's very hard to play against
---
Yeah
---
* Don’t know.

In-game toxicity from survivors is really bad right now. Over the weekend, I've had my game held hostage with the hill spot 3 times. And I can't count how many DCs on first down I've had, which I've heard is to deny sacrifice points and BBQ stacks out of spite (I've actually been taunted about it in post-game, "Lol, you didn't get your BBQ stacks \[slur\]"). Yeah, I've reported them, but it still keeps happening with different people every time. DCing has especially been a problem recently since it can completely kill a match, for the killer especially if they brought good addons and offerings.
---
&gt;Moris, \[...\] insidious camping, franklings items camping, prayer beads, instasaw, \[...\] iri head, tombstone piece, exhaustion add ons and others.
---
These aren't toxic. If you call that toxic, then you have to consider Decisive Strike, Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, Flashlights, BNP, instaheal and looping toxic or that opinion is hypocritical and dishonest. Facecamping? Probably. Bodyblocking a pig box? Maybe. Bodyblocking in a corner to trap you? Definitely. The thing with true killer toxicity is that it's situational, certain things need to happen so it's possible. Survivors can just be toxic with the snap of a finger, making it easier for them to be toxic and ***WAY*** more common, especially recently.
---
Everybody knows this already.
---
But did you just see it as a wall? Not just boarded up?
---
This wasn't supposed to suggest we are bad, we all get to rank 1 eithout trying every season (not that it's an indication of being good since rank 1 is mostly immersed claudettes now) and have played the game for a long time. It was more about how when people think swf, they think tryhard claudettes DS and flashlights whilst me and my friends don't care about winning. We just play with our favourite perks which are sometimes gimmick builds and have fun. If we die it's no big deal. 
---
Maybe don’t butt in where you aren’t needed and finding day old comments to harass people?
---
I've actually never seen that while playing. I managed to get them all. Grabbed the last one out of the hatch.
---
Introducing the new Killer...
---
**The Meg**
---
* Power: The Hunger
---
Whenever The Meg downs a Survivor she can choose to devour the Survivor instantly Killing them.
---
Replace it with the rabbit! (I'm so sorry)
---
Rocking that Adam cut and all.
---
He's fun to play, but he is difficult for me.
---
Laurie. Learn to spell
---
What was the point of this
---
I’m not kidding when I say this, but I was once in a thread where a couple people were saying that survivors should INTENTIONALLY allow the killer to down them if a chase is going long. It was probably the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen on here.
---
It’s remember me on overcharge yes
---
Another question, they said the obsession will emmit a 32 meter TR, so it's the same 32m TR for every killer no matter how big their base terror radius is?
---
Oh for sure! Sorry I wasn’t saying that you guys were, it’s just weird that some people immediately think tryhard when it’s swf, when most I go up against are just bad, none tryharding goofballs having fun. Heck my friends troll each other - only reason you got saved was to get sand bagged by a pallet and they cackle as you get mori’d.  What I should have said that most swf don’t act toxic or tryhard, they’re in fact the opposite most games.
---
ooh well if that's going to be the case that'd be mighty fine! 
---
Nurse ignores chases via a game mechanic. I don’t it’s so much Nurse ignores game mechanics as just she ignores the chase as a whole. Hence why her power doesn’t directly help with finding people. You have to actually be learn and be good to find people with her power. Even then, it can be really easy to loose a Nurse as most of the chase, if there is one, happens out of the Nurses line of sight so she has to guess. Legion doesn’t because his power ignores everything. If Legion didn’t ignore stealth he would be significantly less broken, but overall he just needs a rework.
---
That's the point tho
---
I think this was the first time I've seen the Reverse Bear Trap death animation on a Survivor who was crawling, it looks rad! The arm even twitches, wow.
---
I kind of figured that is the kind of response you'd give.  You want to cry about every killer tactic under the sun but gen times are toooootally fine. Just bad killer. Sure,  90 seconds for 3 gens to pop is why the spirit had to be as strong as she is.  
---
Want spirit nerfs? Then address gen times. Gen times are the reason for the killer power creep. 
---
Is it all darkening add-ons or just that one?
---
Maybe I’m blind but I’m not seeing the thickness at all with her.
---
&gt;Legion isn’t about me having fun, it’s about them not having fun, and that’s why I consider him a balanced killer amongst the pantheon.
---
considering the devs want the game became less toxic, i don't think they were thinking this. legion is just fuel to the fire they don't like...
---
Personally I just like the new heal perk more since I run Botany.
---
Don’t be such a crybaby
---
this is meg
---
I'm just excited to get new perks that have synergy with existing perks. Always happy to mix up the layout. The new survivor perks seem great for healing, gen jockeys, and even memes/trolls.
---
Head on mixed with quick and quiet? or dance with me lithe and poised? Etc. Even the new killer perks seem at least fun to mess around with really looking forward to "shit your pants" perk.
---
Wow that looks really thicc 
---
Holy shit- at first I was like hey this guy gets it, but my word you came out strong on this one. Reality legion is only unfun if play them with their moonwalk or just bloodhound in general. BH isn’t broken, but it sure as fuck is easy to stab a guy twice, hang back and follow blood. It takes time but they NEED to mend, so you can waltz at them outside of chase and get an easy down. A lot of killers have “unfun” addons and powers, legion just has a them on a tunnel style of game play which isn’t one of the community’s favoured styles... lol it’s not some cathartic punish killer, that’s just ridiculous wtf do you live in an anime ?
---
See? Is it just your hobby to harass people online? Is this what you do for fun?

Even though im a killer main i must admit this is the most unbalanced killer ive ever seen them make. Its obvious BHVR Creates Content for fun not for balance or longevity or game health. its so sad this game could be so much better
---
Thats a shame.... but maybe you can pull through that fear ingame if it ever comes to that. Best of luck!
---
IMHO I find lobby dodging better than DCing. I do sometimes dodge if it looks like I'm going to have a shit time (4-Claudette flashlight SWF, bunch of streamers and I don't have a mori available or feel like they're going to be assholes) but if killer dodges you just don't start the game. 
---
If a killer outright DC's, you often depip, lose items and offerings, etc. which is much worse. 
---
I do hope when dedicated servers come a killer dodging keeps the party together and a new killer can load in instead. I agree it sucks when the killer dodges and you gotta reinvite everyone. 
---
I’m guessing 40/50/60 which isn’t worth running. It would need to be at least 120 seconds to be worth consideration.
---
Why is this a gif.
---
I hope you're fucking joking, complaining about everybody is commenting on an old post and here you are correcting my mistakes
---
just downvote then.
---
So you haven't looked at deranged pursuit?
---
Cant see in lockers.
---
Certainly not meta-defining, but you're missing the point. Doc can use it since he can find people with madness, sure, but the real point is for trap killers. Trapper takes waaay too long to set up any meaningful amount of traps, but if survivors are forced to do gens in a tighter area/somewhere closer to the killer, there's a greater likelihood that he can A) find them when he goes to set up traps near unblocked gens, allowing him to disrupt gen progress with more efficiency while setting up, or B) survivors sit and wait for the tentacles to go away and give him time to set up regardless.
---
Can't tell you how many times when I first started playing Trapper (before knowing how tight the time crunch is) that I set up even 3 or 4 traps early on only to see the 3 gens furthest from my spawn point pop when I finished. Only counter is to set up fewer traps, like 1 or 2, and book it over to the gens across the map. With this perk, there won't be as much pressure to start hunting without the proper groundwork in place.
---
On no why you did this? I cant unsee it.😭
---
Are you just now finding this out?
---
100% they sending us mixed messages over here!
---
Nah I’m just tired of it and don’t want to unsubscribe because I want to see content for the game but, now that this new survivor and shit are coming out the cringe is like multiplied by 100.
---
I can easily see that. 
---
Pfft, 14th century plague? That's soooooo mainstream. I prefer my 150 person Measels outbreak, but you've probably never heard of it.
---
And neither*
---
I remember them saying "sometimes this week" not a specific date, but if someone knows I would love to know.
---
Okay, but Biqtch Puddin Pestilence look dlc for Plague when?
---
Are people really still bitter about BBQ?
---
Probably Thursday
---
Knife Hand Joe.
---
if you look the tea bagger didnt have a trap on his head
---
yea but ptbs only are released tuesdays
---
man i really hope pig took her mask off in time if everyone is puking LOL love this style tho 
---
I'm not saying anything my friend doesn't want me to say
---
I've got 3 inches she can consume.
---
Wait, I just made myself sad.
---
This I don't like the idea of the interruption perk. Because you're potentially screwing yourself over late game because the gens would me more spread out. 
---
I ain't good at balancing, this was a quick idea I thought up on my way to my car
---
I dunno really. I thought of it sorta like opposite sprint burst, where instead of a speed boost, it's just the ability to sprint then afterward you can't sprint at all
---
After surveillance I honestly would not be surprised if it did. Lol. 16 seconds. 
---
Michael sits down
---
*SNAP*
---
Someone mentioned that the regiments should make traps clearer like wraith but lesser
---
hmm i did notknow that i swear ive got chase just by running into survivors that were sitting sill but hey the more i know the better i kill
---
Im hoping its going to be this. But im afraid theyll think its too risky, and instead well get something like smashing their head with the censer or strangling them with the chain.
---
I honestly think it's her pants. I'm half Latino, and go to South America to visit family all the time, so you see women with these body proportions a lot (kinda think on top, big hips and thighs). When you add in super high waist pants that might bloom a bit, it makes you look like an oompa loompa.
---
So help me god if you didn't teabag with reckless abandon with me at the start of the match.
---
Maybe they are delaying it, since some content creators went there.... maybe they are delaying it because of that...
---
I'm gonna need more info of this.
---
You can only use one other addon with a speed limiter, and trapping them in a corner, they can just run through you after the first hit.
---
Context for those who don't get it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f\_SwD7RveNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_SwD7RveNE) I'm glad to see I'm not the only one that caught that :3
---
tf why are you being downvoted?
---
Tuesdays or Thursdays and considering that most of the popular streamers have been invited to go over to behaviour studio, Im guessing they will want to wait till they back home. I have a feeling its going to be Thursday when the PTB comes.
---
Thursday
---
I don't think you need to worry...
---
the closest would be Adrenaline post-gens and Unbreakable/No Mither when slugged. 
---
Yea I was thinking it was the combo of the pants and the blazer being an almost crop top cut. I come from a family of women where we all have the small waist/ big butt body so I'm also used to seeing bigger butts (that feels so weird to say talking about my family) I just though Jane looked odd cos it looks overly droopy or something. But you could be right and it's just the outfit choice.
---
Reminded me of Erma comic.
---
you are literally what OP is talking about lmao
---
It's a month old, why are you looking for drama? You seek attention everywhere you can. Medichealer, it's time to get off the computer for awhile.
---
sex joke gimme karma
---
Aha. I'm not saying the body type doesn't exist at all, of course all women are different. It's just something looks very off about it in the design, like her pelvic/hip bone structure is too low and it makes everything look elongated. Like someone else said it might also be the weird clothing choice (crop top/high rise pants is definitely not flattering on a more curvy figure). 
---
It's that kind of mentality that creates the awful "Us vs them" mentality that leads to the heavy bias and divide.
---
Was joking m8 :D
---
Thats tough 
---
I couldn’t think of anything else
---
I didnt say you face death threats in retail, I said you face ungrateful customers. Its your job, you're expected to give everyone what they demand without being thanked for it.
---
Thats literally it. Ungratefulness is the norm, and Im actually surprised how many people think otherwise because clearly none of you have had a normal minimum wage job before. Just sayin.
---
This post is literally answered multiple times daily on here.  People need to stop asking the same question every single day.
---
Cause some dick head on another thread is down voting my comments.
---
*you’re
---
At ruin and bbq and your good to go 
---
You'd think this issue would of been a hotfix weeks ago, but nope, still the best killer in the game
---
Ahegao to a next level.
---
Does aftercare have one use only? As in after the person you connected to (for lack of better word) dies, you can’t use it again on another survivor after unhooking?
---
It should be 32 meters radius indeed. Except is Devs said b\*llshit during yesterday stream :D
---
I'd be using DS cause im allways tunneled. Also do you have Borrowed time? I love that perk, its great to save other survivors.
---
Most likely to avoid upskirting Meg and/or sexualizing her. There wasn't much under there except for spandex but still, the back of the skirt ruined the cosmetic. Everyone I play with noticed the change too and agreed with me that it's bad. If people want to upskirt or sexualize their Megs, they should be allowed the opportunity to do so, not competely changing potentially sexy outfits.
---
OH FUK YES
---
I'd replace Premonition with a perk like Borrowed Time/We'll make it and Decisive strike with any other exhaustion perk or maybe adrenaline.
---
Adrenaline 
---
Yeah I used Borrowed Time before I got DS on the shrine, maybe could go back to that. 
---
Never speak again
---
She’s not gonna be gagging but the survivors are probably, not looking forward to playing against her
---
Personally, I'll probably use DS more often now when I didn't before. I like that it punishes tunneling and doesn't let the killer know you have it with the obsession. No more dribbling! 
---
But, I'd suggest an exhaustion perk if you're looking to replace it in your loadout. Balanced Landing is my favorite, but people like Sprint Burst and Dead Hard as well. I also love Iron Will, so if you haven't tried that, give it a go.
---
That doesn't assist the aim of the build though
---
Maybe Ruin depending on whether I need more time to start the process. I still haven't gotten BBQ in my Hag bloodweb anyway, even after like a trillion level 50 webs
---
Through the holes in the mask.
---
I bought a Michael Myers mask last year off ebay and the seller included this picture in the package. Not really that relevant but I thought I’d share. 
---
How cute little cunt you are - little Grammar Nazi
---
Someone, somewhere, probably gives a fuck.
---
she's not puking, i deepfried this myself
---
With the amount of camping trash killers in the game we don't have the option to repair gens slowly.  You risk screwing yourselves over bigtime if you get one of these Sultans of Sportsmanship in your lobby.  Repairing gens quickly is the best counter to these players and you never know how the killer is going to play it until they get their first hook.
---
Seriously I've always wanted a killer with a "familiar". I wonder if it would work.
---
K.
---
How do you not recognize this as an excellent, though ham-fisted troll?
---
 I read the thread, it wasn't exactly subtle, but it definitely highlighted the average intelligence of the dbdForums user. They even dropped character a little bit and forgot to stay consistent with playtime. I mean come on guys.
---
Whoa wait a minute... Creepy butterflies surrounding your friend until they are in a vortex and suddenly disappear is pretty spooky.
---
Holy shit that range
---
&gt; I mean, it's good that people are voicing their concerns about the new content now
---
When they know literally nothing?
---
come the fuck on
---
1. Woosh.
---
2. Nobody will use this perk either.
---
I stopped playing Bill shortly after I started playing the game. Killers really don't like him and I'm not sure why. Maybe borrowed time? 
---
Hmmm I see. Yeah you know what, now that I’m thinking about it again, I realize it’s a chainsaw killer so that doesn’t make sense, but like, if I was using any other killer. It’d make sense to slap them, give them my terror radius, and then leave them for the stack, right?
---
Yoink
---
Bad players are typically new players but yeah I guess? 
---
DS won’t be worth it now? So you liked it as a cheap crutch to escape after you lost a chase. Interesting how DS users won’t use it now that it’s reworked to specifically stop tunneling which was the excuse they used to use DS before
---
I think people use PWYF on Leatherface because he keeps the speed boost while using his chainsaw. 
---
If you run empathy I'd go for a healing build like. We'll make it, bt and botany. 
---
As someone who’s only leveled Pig, Clown, Hag and Legion enough to get their perks can Pop Goes The Weasel and Hangman’s Trick go away please? Thanks
---
Listen here BROTHER megan is best girl
---
Reddit is always a fanboy stronghold
---
Food for thought, what if after doing a gen the entire area for X amount of meters just had scratch marks and bloodstains everywhere for Y amount of seconds. I think it would be pretty cool if you’ve got a situation where team mates have to run to the person on the gen to hide their scratch marks among all the fakes to try and shake the killer.
---
When's the PTB?
---
Don’t forget about Vermintide. It’s full of diseased ratmen and nordic zombies who’ve pledged allegiance to the Chaos God of Pestilence. 
---
Ahh, thanks for the info!
---
This UGLY trapper is hooking dozens of Claudettes and meanwhile you’re just STUPID
---
Bhvr is a horrible company. I wish that was seen, at least their dbd team is for the most part awful. 
---
I’d rather have her put a bit plant or some shit in her censor burner and asphyxiate them or something like that. 
---
That's an awful lot of assuming you're doing just to cry on my post.
---
It’s it out yet?
---
A hidden shrine to Waluigi in the basement, unlocked by Spirit and all survs standing in a spot
---
Technician, Poised, Sprint Burst, and Urban Evasion. Cant hit what ya cant see, lemme just do all the gens
---
#**WAH!**
---
Now im kinda sad. This killers power would've been great for a undead zombie girl killer. How do we not have a zombie killer yet
---
&gt; Though, I’m fine with lower tier add ons not altering playstyle and just being minor, flat buffs.
---
yeah for sure. brown add-ons are pretty useless, i wasn't talking about shit like "slightly increases bottle re-load time"
---
when i talk about add-ons i'm always referencing purple and pink usually 
---
Singing is not part of her TR. Insidious removed her TR but not her humming. I know it goes against the idea of the new perk, but I would assume that the humming stays on the Huntress, like it does with Insidious.
---
Not yet. Only info we have is sometime this week.
---
I could of sworn they said 10 on the stream, did I mishear? And yes, I agree it’s not op, but it’s a concept I like as the one friend in my group that does gens
---
Never really liked Sprint Burst, but will give the others a try.
---
The wait is Killing me!
---
It's almost like making every map the size of The Game for a short time.
---
get an exhaustion perk
---
&gt; Won't be worth using once the changes are implemented
---
an anti-tunneling perk isn't worth using? you better not ever complain about being tunneled now
---
Let's make it 30/40/50 depending on the perk level ?
---
With ice
---
&gt;  Interesting how DS users won’t use it now that it’s reworked to specifically stop tunneling which was the excuse they used to use DS before
---
big facts
---
Windows are more likely to appear in any map than hills or buildings. Windows are practically guaranteed, specially in jungle gyms, so Lithe is useful in practically any map, while you may play maps where Balance Landing is absolutely useless, like Shelter Woods. Also, you can panic rely more on Lithe, since if you get suprise caught you're more likely to have a window at hand, and maybe the next Hill or Building is too far to get to use BL before getting downed. That's why BL is more risky than Lithe.
---
Now, why is BL more rewarding? First, because Lithe requires you to be in a chase to be activated, while you can use BL even if the killer is far away, which can save your life depending on the situation (escaping BBQ, hiding far away, ending a chase before it even starts etc.). And second because usually Lithe only allows you to extend the chase, since the killer won't break LoS with you (thats when your skill comes in handy, you can do awesome plays with Lithe) since you will be running to the next jungle gym or killer shack, meanwhile the building or hill you are using with BL can be used to break LoS with the killer, and even if you don't do that the killer will actually have to waste time either vaulting or going around the building, which will give you enough time to lose the killer (BL on Haddonfield is disgusting). Also the removal of the landing stun will probably get the killer to miss an attack thinking you'll get stunned, so more time. 
---
At the end of the day both perks are good, and the risk/reward difference between both is not that high, it just exists, and it depends on the map and your other perks (Lithe with Quick and Quite and Dance With Me is guarantee chase breaker). It also depends on your playstyle, some people avoid fast vaulting so Lithe won't be good, and some people avoid the hills, so BL won't be good for them. So just play a week with Lithe, then play a week with Balance Landing and see what perk gives you the best results. Both are better than Sprint Burst imo.
---
Would propably be good. Maybe a bit overtuned at 50 but who knows
---
Me too , when's the PTB? I love monto's creativity with his perk builds 
---
MAN OF CULTURE DETECTED
---
Maybe today, maybe Thursday. Definitely one of the two tho
---
Yeah but as I said, when he chases others becouse they see you in his frenzy he wont tunnel a single one and play legion the way he was meant to be which is easy to counter tbh couse he is not that strong as a killer that way
---
You got replies to your previous post you know
---
Probably Friday at ~12 PM EST
---
I thought it was for reunited to proc forcing the game to recognize the location of both players.
---
Based on what I hear, unless you have a PS4 pro, it’ll probably play as well as your laptop. 
---
I wonder if her mori will involve her vomit? I'm thinking something like reptile from mortal kombat

yeah yeah shitpost it couse you cant adapt to a different killer / playstyle.   
---
you talk nonsense and ignore that there are other ways to play than gen rush / pallet loop 
---
But guess its easier to be a salty crying surv than actual improve gameplay
---
Stand Killer confirmed??
---
True you couls just use bbq to find them and then run either ruin or m&amp;a
---
Flip the ruler the other way 😎

It is playable on PS4, but there are ocassional bugs here and there that usually make themselves known immediately after each update.
---
So if the killer comes after me after I’m unhooked, but I manage to not go down right away cause I reached a pallet or two.., I was not tunneled?! 
---
Probably tomorrow, but don't lose hope!
---
Can't believe they named a sickness after this dlc.
---
link to the video, asking for me, I have no friends
---
Porridge?
---
Unfortunately it's shit content or no content. Actual discussion is few and far between. It's mostly just screeching tribalism. 
---
My dude, IF the killer uses such perks to find you , you can easily counter that by playing pallet and loop heavy. 
---
Couse as I said its stupid to always do the same stuff vs every killer / build 
---
Adapt to the killer and playstyle. 
---
If he uses so many perks to find survs you can better out loop him and play heavy with pallets couse he cant counter it very good couse he lacks the perks and vice versa with the stealthy way 
---
To your nonsense with legion, if he uses his ability to track people he first has to find you a first time, and if he uses his ability to find others while ina chase with you, its fine couse he plays legion the devs wanted to and he isnt a very strong killer that way so you should be able to counter him 
---
so dont ignore everything and cry about stuff when its strong or good rather adapt to it and overcome it 
---
I see what you're saying now. I guess technically, yeah, but keeping the killer busy for over a minute is still good for your team and if you're being chased that quickly, you're in the injured state and will likely go down before the minute is up
---
holy shit imagine failing at the most simple meme this bad
---
I never said NOED isn’t cheap. I think it’s a trash move to use that perk as well. In fact, the DS change actually made it stronger. Instead of just one person getting immediate DS per game, everyone gets it when they get tunneled AND they get to use it without the possibility of juggling AND the skill check box is bigger. So I suggest you use the new DS when it comes out in place of the old crutch DS you currently use. Good day. 
---
It plays fine on PlayStation. I play on both PC and PS4 and there’s hardly a difference. 
---
Oh God sorry, my laptop that I used was ass and didn't even show me the post I sent, sorry
---
Y'see I love horror elements but vomit is a big "yuck" for me. I'm still excited for the new killer and playstyle but I agree regarding vomit sounds.  
---
Exactly but the game NEEDS a second Objective
---
Thats why the Devs said NOED is healthy for the game.   
---
Not as in its good to insta down and get an speed boost but to "force" the survs to do all the totems and take a little more time.
---
And its way better than to just make gen slower or mor gens couse its kinda boring to just stare at gens for the whole game for the survs 
---
i saw it in a 4gamers video and couldn't see it in any of the thumbnails so i gave up
---
My only thing is they said when you down a survivor with your “basic attack” so I worry that T3 EW won’t count as a basic attack and therefore ruin the perk on him.
---
&gt;you had me thinking i was going crazy
---
same thing happened to me with my girlfriend who doesn't know she's my girlfriend

---
But tbh its on both sides.   
---
Maining Wraith and Freddy I know how toxic survs can be.   
---
and if they are that way couse they played vs a toxic legion before I can understand them being mad but it doesnt make it fine letting it out on me or anyone else, just makes them dicks. 
---
Just like it makes the toxic killers dicks
---
Not every build needs BBQ or an RNG-dependent perk.
---
I think it's really neat that the "gross vomiting killer" is not big, fat, gross looking, but regal and has a cool flail-like weapon. I'm really happy they didn't go for the obvious choice for this killer.
---
I want that feng outfit
---
Yea and I suppose that they will scream in the grond if u down someone nearby like they do with the doctor
---
The amount of downvote couse you asked a question XD This reddit is amazing some times 
---
we need double bloodpoint weekend every weekend
---
Thanks hero
---
You realize that there are people who animate the killers/survivors, and people who code the movements right? Like it's not the same job.
---
This. While it is fine to tell the server that there is a problem with your food, you shouldnt blame them for that. 
---
Well if you manage to get downed just a little bit after one minute expires then you have one more chance to get unhooked, where your DS will be available to use since you didn’t get to use it the first time, then you can hit the DS and the exits should be about open by then and you can just run out.

---
I just think killers are going to adapt and if a chase goes a decent length, even if it’s not the full minute, they just won’t pick up right away and burn the rest of the time. We’ll see how it goes, but I expect once this starts happening to people they’ll stop using it. The clock really doesn’t make sense to me as a true tunneling counter would work more like Pigs traps. Much shorter clock, but stop in chase.
---
I've had multiple games on ps4 where the killer is seemingly afk, but they're continuously swinging their weapon in one spot. What the hell?
---
I think they said “a few seconds” for all the perks. Even the blocking the generators one. So I’m guessing that’s just what they say even though it could be much longer. If the gen blocking perk only actually blocks them for a few seconds, it’ll be the most useless perk ever. 
---
Evading a good Nurse takes practice just like playing a good Nurse. Decent isn’t good enough to be unstoppable. The skill ceiling for Nurse being as high as it is a good enough reason for her doing what she does. The problem with Legion is he ignores everything(Nurse doesn’t ignore stealth or Mindgames) and he takes zero skill.
---
Why can I picture Dwight making this exact facial expression?
---
This made me so happy you don't even know XD it's nice to see the karma working on people who bm to this degree. 
---
Let me out let me out this not a dance 
---
Ruin is worth the ring and double blood-points is nice 
---
Lol it’s fine don’t worry about it. Also the game runs decently (at least for me) on ps4, it just might take a few games to get used to if you used to play on a good pc. 
---
Well in 3 months between patches you can grind it efficiently. But if u dont play too much maybe you shouldn't prestige. Also we have the double bp events 
---
Well the fact people can counter her ( watching many streams in bed before sleeping couse I think this game is very entertaining t spectate ) and she takes much skill to play ( compared to every other killer ) make her kinda ok I guess
---
People will always take the "best" or strongest killer if they wanna win.   
---
I tried her and just dont like her style.   
---
her 5 blink build is pretty insane good but every killer has such a build I think doesnt they ? 
---
She is a strong killer which can be viable even vs 4 SWF 
---
Thats my 2 cents 
---
Mental note: stay away from this guy. 
---
Hated because of some selfish reasons.
---
Fun or not, they are different, and powerful.

---
Ye
---
But crying about a killer couse you refuse to adapt and change the "loop and pallet abuse" playstyle is a good argument ? :D oh man the survs are srsly special 
---
It's that kind of play that gets them killed.
---
A legion main will tell you that staying injured just means they can 1 shot you. 
---
This reminds me of the Freddy meme of old. 
---
Still, solid idea. You have to use Anti-Hemmorhagic Syringes, 4 of them to heal the killer. Thou shalt not bring 3, nor shalt thou bring 5. 
---
Oh nooooo
---
I guess everything is a crunch to someone who's shit and envious.

Bill mains especially rejoice.

This is what I wrote haha

That was actually kinda funny
---
been waiting for a thicc to challenge meg
---
Fucks up with this sub and drag queens, I swear this is becoming the next JJBA
---
She is strong , no discussion. 
---
The strongest Killer of them all 
---
But her 5 Blink build is a insane strong build just like every killer has such a thing   
---
Hell I can get easy 4ks when I play the Ninja Wraith ( no sound of bell and no Terror radius and red stain) 
---
So it depends on the killer kinda couse they all can be pretty viable, she is just the best and people will use the best and strongest just like survs use 4 SWF couse its the strongest
---
Kate’s hair is messed up too. It flies all over the place and stretches way out when she runs
---
When you've been here as long as some of us, you realize that no matter what the killer is there will be a bunch of assfucks complaining about it. They could release a killer right now that does nothing but hit survivors with an inflatable mallet that gives then blood points and people would still find something to be salty about.
---
This killer will be no different. And I love it.
---
She compresses them like a spring
---
Then when the time is right releases all the pressure into the locker doors to explode out
---

We're still waiting on a Freddy rework my dude, and he's been out for a fucking year. Good luck with this.
---
Yeah she is very strong but on the other hand a 4 SWF is unstopable aswell. 
---
So a good Nurse ( which takes much skill ) vs a 4 SWF seems fair for me .
---
its different in other scenarios for both sides:  4 SWF vs low tier killer or newer players or casual player is pretty one sided as well as a Good or God Nurse vs Randoms. 
---
Guess its hard to balance every aspect of such a game 
---
/r/im14andthisisdeep
---
It doesn’t even have to be minute because the clock continues to run while you’re in dying state...which is extremely stupid and that definitely needs to be changed at the very least.
---
Yeah waht the guy under you said, ignore this reddit.   
---
its so much salt and crying instead of just adapting and getting better thats why most good player dont read or post here and just read the funny meme stuff
---
Serial killer = three or more murders with at least one "cooling off period" in between. If he'd stopped after the first two films he'd be a spree killer, but picking up the murders again years later makes him a serial killer.
---
Mass murder typically refers to killing multiple people in a single incident, not several people one by one in different locations.
---
That's why she has it, when the killer is in the general area they will already hear her cheeks, this is the only reason you would stay in a locker with her and BHVR knows it.
---
Lmao I can't unsee
---
You'd think they would do a lot more double blood points with all the grinding this game requires. 
---
I’d say it’s biased towards survivors in competitive level play, but normal play is pretty balanced as of late if not just ever so slightly in the killers favor because the killer coordinates all the efforts of his side by himself. Not by much, but just a little bit since the killer doesn’t have to rely on teammates when trying to win.
---
I had a bodypillow of her custom made.
---
whenever I hit her with a pallet and she squeaks, I immediately feel bad
---
Double *W H E E Z E*
---
I don’t disagree with you at all, I’m only quoting the developers.
---
I've had a few. Most were bots I think,  one was a person being dumb the whole game. 
---
Honestly at this point I phase immediately, because most people just starts walking slowly away from a dropped pallet, or sprinting from it, both ways it's a free hit.
---
I did not know this was a thing and I don’t know how to feel about it
---
I feel like tying it to first Gen completed could work as well
---
Dude this happened to me and my friend! Went and saved a Survivor from a hook in the basement and my friend was searching the chest. The killer comes down, we hide, the survivor I saved walks up, points at the lockers we were in and then leaves unharmed as I get my ass hooked
---
"The Shape Stalks" starts playing at max volume. He slowly ascends the stairs, one hand open, his knife, wrapped in the blood of hundreds, in the other. You cower and crawl into the corner, his blue eyes glaring balefully down at you from beneath the mask, the white latex ancient in appearance and splattered with your friend's blood. He moves swiftly, reaching down and clamping his hand around your throat, choking out a scream as his gory blade slides in to the hilt, sticking through your back, going through flesh and bone as though nonexistent. 
---
I'm gonna enjoy anything Michael Myers related =\^.\^=

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
Why would I ever be envious of a player who needs a free second chance after losing a fair chase. Could not be me
---
Killler- and survivor mains will get two very different vibes
---
Hopefully it works like a plague doctor mask.
---
You’re saying if it activated after first gen was completed? That would be significantly better.
---
Yeah honestly that’s accurate. Especially on a chainsaw killer, where your specialty is instadowns and shortening chases by dealing with the pallet
---
This looks like a resident evil monster
---
I had two in a row yesterday, very confusing. I had another game where the trapper was seemingly afk, we did all the gens and were all circled around him, just messing around, and then he hit me with noed and downed me. The other survivors noped outta there and left me to die. Got me good
---
Iron Maiden still exists just for those people
---
Without WGLF the BP gain as a survivor is so miniscule it's depressing. Small game is another good perk because a lot of Killers use numerous hex perks like NOED or ruin.  Self care if you are solo, the less you depend on team mates the better. For the last perk,  I would equip Sprint Burst or alternatively Urban Evasion, good for roaming the map undetected and also helps with the recent increase in Hag mains.
---
Please don't feed the myers.
---
You haven't answered my question, mate.
---
This is so troll hahah
---
&gt; as killer you actually have to try to not be a dick. I’m not allowed to single someone out, even though it’s the easiest thing to do. I’m not allowed to stay too close to hooked individuals. If I use a mori I’m a dick. If I use no one escapes death or hex ruin I’m a dick. 
---
There are things that survivors do that "makes them" dicks, like ds, pallet/window blinding, deliverance, using a glitched vault, going out of bounds at the end of the game, getting on rocks via exploits, etc. Both sides have things that will make people give you shit for doing them, I wouldn't say it's one sided at all.
---
Honestly pointing and teabagging seem so simple and silly that I don't really mind them, I don't get why people get so upset about them.
---
Nobody thinks that going out of bounds and holding the game hostage isn't toxic, if someone records you doing it and reports you then you will get banned for it.
---
Adam, Jake, huntress 
---
I see her as the really mean elementary school teacher
---
i still came across it so it must still be relevant. good to know it gets you so heated
---
Had some guy pull this on me. Next two lobbies I joined, I found him again. Kept trying that same bullshit. Seriously, fuck these people
---
Just think, if there were prelude objectives to gens, such that they guarantee that a match cannot be less than say 6 minutes, they could also make it so gens only take half the time they do now, and on-the-fence killers (i.e. The ones who don't cap just to be a troll) would feel less pressure to play sleazy when it looks like the match is spiraling away from them. 90% of shitty things in this game come from time. The killer doesn't have enough, generally, and Survivors who focus can get objectives out way too fast.  The base game loop really needs to be shaken up.  Just my opinion, obvs. 
---
Ah alright, my mistake sorry
---
This actually looks scary as fuck.
---
“How did he know I was here?!”
---
welp, should have worn the brown pants.
---
Well it depends on the time between your murders *and* the number of your victims. If you kill two or more people with a cooldown period (generally a few months or years, but it does start to get fuzzy if it's weeks or days), you are a serial killer.
---
However, if you kill two or more people in more than one location with no cooldown, you're considered a spree killer. I believe Daddy Myers would probably be considered a spree killer, given that he kills multiple people every time he goes killin', and he tends to move a fair distance between victims.
---
*Still has Hex: Ruin and Overcharge*
---
It‘s not about denying the vision. It‘s about information. 
---
You notice you lose a stack upon someone being hooked - BBQ. 
---
You can now play accordingly (fake out a direction etc.) 
---
It's probably in a few hours later 
---
*Shape stalking Gloria*
---
I think Moto Moto likes you 
---
This is true.  The other problem is, a killer has no way of knowing what's coming, either, so any time they suspect an swf, they either have to bring out the nukes or just buckle down for a shit game that will potentially last for 30+ minutes.  And when they hit a just-for-fun swf, now they're in there dripping with their best shit like they fell into a borderlands golden chest. 
---
Totally get and support folks playing with friends.  Totally get people wanting to talk and play.  It does allow for a huge advantage for a certain mindset group, though.  Also can't see any clear path to making it less crappy than it is for either side though.  
---
Its worth it to finally see survivors run from little feng min but yeah only the scream on down perk seems decent
---
jane got them thunder thighs boooiiiii
---
Go on twitch and watch zubatLeL play nurse and tell me that she's fine as she is because there is a chance that the killer will lose you in a chase. 
---
That's more of a side thing but 3 blinks or 2 blinks with range add ons are actually better than 5 blinks, the fatigue you get is incredibly long and the range of the blinks is short, so you actually get more distance without them.
---
Multiple killers are viable vs 4 SWF, the game is pretty close to being balanced. Also not every SWF is a tournament level team, despite this sub usually claiming that every SWF is 4 perfect cyborgs or something.
---
It‘s hard to pull off if the killer is not a freaking dumbass, though. We will see how it turns out. 
---
Ahhh that makes sense lol thanks
---
I know, right?  It's a great pic, but something like that would've knocked me out of my chair. 
---
I think it should work with hex totems too since they are an objective. 
---
Legion with Distressing, BBQ, thrill of the hunt you don't even have to get a kill just start smacking
---
We unfortunatly prob have to wait for all the streamers they flew out there to get a chance to play and what not before the rest of us...so prob tomorrow or Thursday. 
---
Not yet. I checked less than an hour ago.
---
I’m guessing 8/10/12 like Tinkerer which would make it worthless.
---
The game starts, I run into them immediately. 
---
They tbag twice, I nod. We start the chase.
---
Tis proper etiquette in the realm of the entity.
---
I’d be happy to 
---
You're gonna run out of drugs one of these days, you bugeyed pipsqueak. 
---
Then maybe they’ll buff it on the PTB. All the perks have really good ideas behind them
---
Full p3, alternatively she has a brown button top, and a brown skirt with leggings/shin pads 
---
Reminds me of that weird bee thing from resident evil 6? Is this real or just re6 concept art ? 
---
I won't lie I agree, but I'm still totally going to main her because fucking Oprah in Dead by Daylight.
---
I'm really disappointed with the perks. The only one that's remotely good is the dual healing and that shit is far too situational. (Good if you don't have Self Care but that's about it.)
---
Being able to kick the Survivor in the face when you exit a locker is fucking hilarious though.
---
Slap BBQ and Chili on whatever killer you’re best at And milk every game you play. Make sure you hit people, engage in multiple chases, try to encourage involvement with everyone. Don’t placate the survivors but keep everyone involved to max scores. While focusing a target out early may be easily done, if someone dies on first hook you’ll get very little points compared to letting them get away to get them later. If you can, make sure you’re kicking gens and getting pallet breaks too. 
---
\*Head On, my mistake.
---
They are people of wealth and taste. 
---
But not lazy enough to ask? Yikes. 
---
Tired of them trucker pills yet?  I've got four pointed arguments to show you later. 
---
Just a side note but 3 blinks or stacking range add ons is actually better than 5 blinks.
---
5 blinks are really short and give massive fatigue, you cover more distance and leave less time for reaction with 3 blinks/range.
---
yeah
---
I never understood the crying about NOED or DS
---
Im playin mainly killer and never had a problem with DS, just a perk. can get counterd to a certain degree and gives the surv another 30 sek most of the times. 
---
if he can get away for a long time he wouldnt have needed the perk in the first place 
---
the only thing I understand is that it rewards a "fail" 
---
and NOED on the other hand simply provides an extra objective to the survs to make the game last longer which I think is super healthy for the game 
---
The insta down and speed boost gives a good late game boost but is easily shut down or negated completly first hand
---
Correct, my mistake.
---
Bad connection, bad hitboxes, and depending on when you last played pallet vacuums are now gone.
---
I dunno, I thinks it's going to be a little too situational given that they have to be in range when you down.  Good Survivors should be spread out a lot, and if it's a good swf, they'll be using it against you. 
---
Also the best cosmetic to guarantee I mori u every time
---
They didn't ask a question, they said that they don't see a problem with Nurse.
---
Not seeing a problem with something means that you do not consider them problematic. The people who disliked their post disagree with that statement. It wasn't a question.
---
They should just drop the different tier levels, or at least remove the lowest tier initially.
---
Yeah that sounds like she would still be fun and still strong and pretty much the strongest 
---
Nah I think its mostly me who sucks in mindgames and stuff :D trying to get this moonwalk thing on loops and the shack done, works pretty good up to now :D 
---
Freddy to me seems like a heavy late game killer. 
---
with his blood warden etc. and its fun to put pressure on them with the dream stuff :D 
---
I think he could use a small buff but he is fine and fun the way he is 
---
Sometimes he works insanly good and suprises the enemy and sometimes he cant do shit but thats just the same with every killer I guess :D 
---
I think Gloria likes you 
---
Why are you questioning my methods on the no stupid questions thread 
---
Hey..  is this a porn! Not on my good Christian subreddit.
---
Why would Leatherface use it?
---
They're bot farming for BPs. Saw that a lot on PS4 this past week. I think some killer mains are trying to ready themselves with BPs for the new killer.
---

---
When Doctor brings his special “Electric stimulator”
---
Well its old for me im 18
---
If someone goes down while you're opening the gate, best bet is to stop at 99% until the hook actually occurs, then open it. Blood warden will still show your aura once past the exit gates, but won't actually block the exit.
---
That's really scary. For real.
---
Tho the one after them seems bonkers Op.
---
I didn’t realise that first post was rotten flesh 
---
Shes just gross

I laughed more than I should have at this, take your upvote.
---
Oooooh 😂😂 looks kinda like an alien face thingy
---
no...
---
because slugging people with leather is a good tactic, makes people group up
---
Nah gotta hit them with and enduring.
---
Well, as a man who has spent 1200 hours playing almost exclusively Survivor, I'd like to point at some mistakes you've made.
---
First, hiding won't help you with generators. If you are not fixing them, then you are useless. But if you start working on one, the Nurse will see it's aura and learn your general position. The fact that she can teleport via great distances makes "fix-and-run" tactic impossible, as she will either see you running to a safe place or find your marks on the ground.
---
Second, even if you don't get caught fixing a gen, the Nurse will always find you, because she is probably the only one Killer who can use all of her slots for detection perks. BBQ&amp;Chili got nerfed, but she still has Stridor, Nurse Calling, Whispers and new stuff like Discordance. A half-competent Nurse won't let you alone.
---
Stealth gameplay in Dead by Daylight is long dead and the best we can do is to stop trying to fuck it's corpse. We can use some elements of it, but not build your while experience around it.
---
Best method I've seen is worry more about the last hook than the third hook. I HATE THE HATCH, sooooo I just let the penultimate survivor bleed out on the ground while I find/chase/down the last one. If I don't know where the other crawler is, I will let them bleed out while I follow the final downed guy, and then hook them right as the other bleeds out. It's about as twisted/savage and time wastey as it gets, but I hate the hatch so friggin' much. I hate it sooo much, I just give it to any last survivor that's even close to the hatch, even if I get there first, and even if they sucked at surviving.   
---
Freddy is also pretty good about killing the last two people. Just make sure both are asleep, if you can down someone they stay asleep and you can go after the last person safely knowing you will find the other crawler. 
---
Best non perk method I've seen is not hooking the second to last guy. 
---
I’m not questioning a stupid question. I’m questioning a lazy one. If you asked a stupid question, I’d happily answer. 
---
Ah, thank you! I’m still pretty new to editing. I can’t link right now, but the song is “Halloween Party” by Odd chap

should I perform a mori on him? 
---
Despite affecting gens it's really not the same thing. Ruin slows down the game for survivors, giving the killer more time. Corrupt Intervention is going to restrict the play space in the early game, but that doesn't really slow down gen progress in and of itself. It probably won't be useful for killers like Nurse and Hillbilly, who don't have a problem zipping around the map and so won't really benefit from the restricted early game space, and a lot more useful for killers like Hag and Trapper, who are very bound to map geography and have shit early games because there's too much space to defend.  
---
Doctor and maybe Myers might also get some use out of it. A restricted play space combined with a big terror radius is great for the Doctor, and for Myers he just has a garbo early game so anything that helps find your first survivor(s) is great. A Myers would use it for the same reason they'd use Whispers.
---
Oh my god thank you I just had a big laugh ^^
---
What meta is going to change ?
---
Ah ok
---
What happened to the old livestream summaries that used to be pinned on this subreddit? I lost interest in the game for a while and now that I’m interested again,  I don’t hear about the streams anymore.
---
Quit your boo hoping special snowflake.

Keep practicing. There’s no perks that make up for the practice you have to put in to read survivors and react accordingly. The difference between a good nurse and a god nurse isn’t the build but how the player reacts to the survivors they are up against. 
---
Adding on to the other replies, if you play the tutorial, the devs even nod to this stereotype by having a Dwight in a locker.
---
Exactly! Pulling your pants up that high makes your ass look way bigger than it really is
---
Hey nice, keep improving. I hope you're having fun c:
---
Corrupt Intervention will probably be good on Trapper and Hag.  
---
Infectious Fright's definitely the star of her perks though.
---
It seems like i get hit every time i vault. Hit boxes are just terrible.
---
1) Most of us have free health care
---
2) the killer is based out of Babylon 
---
3) Babylon is in Iraq 
---
That smug little bitch, laughing n shit

big yikes, buddy!

The first book is ironically a nice read. To summarize, a rock climber gets his hand trapped under a boulder. With no help after several days, he decides to cut off his own decaying arm and climb back out the rift to get help from a distant rural town. Based on a true story (the author's).
---
I guess I could call it situational. However the situations where it's useful are MUCH more common than other "situational" perks like hangmans trick and the like.
---
Totally, and the dev’s won’t nerf him because their heads are up THEIR ASSES
---
Also when you are anti-vaxx and ho to other countries. 
---
*what a cute little cunt
---
Look, I'm Mixalot's long lost cousin... but you're right.  It does look a bit ridiculous.  I've always felt the character models in this game look a bit UT2k4, but it feels like they're really showing their age.  Maybe BHVR can rent the f13 models for cheap (maybe not the facial animation though). 
---
its nothing to do with anyones skill as a killer, it's an objective fact about the game. Literally do what I said you moron
---
I assumed as much seeing as how all of these stores go away once Halloween is gone
---
Alright cool, I might read it someday
---
Haha haha how do people not get how that works yet. 
---
Is that Wraith or Michael? 
---
I’ve always felt like the single “goal” of do gens to escape is shitty. There needs to be something else. Seriously. I know they’re different games, but F13 for instance has MANY objectives and a HUGE map. I like this game way better btw. 
---
I get i spelled Oprah wrong but gee you dont have to steal 
---
I know it's a joke, but I feel like I remember then saying iridescent was supposed to be for going over and above... which looks very literal looking at this. 
---
Only closers get coffee! 
---
Doc mains will run it, ironically.  Or maybe it'll replace monstrous shrine as the perks you can get rid of when levelling up Doc. 
---
"Now you're toxic on the outside like you are on the inside!"
---
Ah there it is.
---
*Wraith introduces the Plague*
---
Wraith: "So tell us, what is your power?"
---
Plague: "I can control when I vomit, and use that to cover the map and survivors in an un-ending flood of pestilent bile that makes the survivors all sick and easy to pick off.
---
Wraith: "Well... um, that actually sounds... effective, no demonstrations necessary, please. Whatever works for you is fine, no judgment here... is that an incense burner assaulting our noses with obnoxiously sweet perfume?"
---
Plague: "Yes, Its also my weapon!"
---
Wraith: "It does look heavy, I bet a good overhand swing caves plenty of heads in!"
---
Plague: "Actually, due to all the sickness and vomiting, my muscles are pretty weak, so I just sort of swipe it at them to my left."
---
Wraith: "And, that works?"
---
Plauge: "Oh yeah, its wicked hot and has pointy things!"  
---
*Plague throws up all over the floor, whole room backs away in disgust, nurse pats her back*.
---
Wraith: "DEAR GOD! That's a smell no amount of perfume is going to cover up!"
---
Trapper: "Arrgh, sick lady smell burning my eyes!"
---
Wraith: "Hang on a minute... didn't you just say you can control when you vomit?"
---
Plague:"..."
---
Wraith: "You just did that in an attempt to show off didn't you?"
---
Plague: "N-No... I-I thought I saw a survivor over there."
---
*Points towards Nea, everyone looks, Nea looks nervously flattered.*
---
Wraith: \*Sigh\* "No, that's just Legion"
---
*Legion pokes out and waves at plague from behind Nea.*
---
Wraith: "You're new here, so please refrain from giving them any attention."
---
Legion: "But we're really good at stab-"
---
Wraith: "NOBODY LIKES YOU!"
---
Time to go cloak in the corner, Phillip.  Don't forget your dunce cap and your outdated power mechanic. 
---
whens the new killer coming out?
---
Spine Chill is super good tho. Underrated af.
---
Jumpscare Myers is best build
---
I feel like basic attack means “M1”. So no chainsaw or hatchet 
---
~~couple months~~ couple years
---
And she's trying to hide but the clap of her ass cheeks keeps alerting the killer!
---
Uhhh sure?
---
Drugs,Energy Drinks,etc.......
---
I will never go to sleep 
---
The perk only works on basic attacks, so chainsaw won’t work 
---
I totally read that in everyone's voice.
---
hag
---
Violent Purge aka emetophilia aka Regan from the Exorcist aka Stand by Me aka projectile vomit. 
---
My point is that, if you hate the design- not much I can do to change that? But if it were because of it being too strong- it won’t be used all too often.
---
Shouldn't get rid of it but I'd like to see it increased a bit.  Give me a minute to apply it.  
---
A must? Nah. 
---
I like rolling with Lullaby / Devour / BBQ / MYC
---
They said a "few seconds" for that as well.  The timer on that will 100% decide if it's trash or usable on anyone. 
---
I don't mind noed but I think it'd be reasonable to give an indicator to the survivors before it activates.
---
My idea was to make it so at 1/2/3 generators completed (based on the perk level) the totems start to smoke. Now survivors have a clear indicator that if they don't get off gens then they will have a problem, and it makes it more likely that they will do the totems, delaying the game for the killer who can take an advantage of that. 
---
This also mostly avoids the situation where survivors do all gens and then luckly find the noed totem, avoiding the need to do all of the totems.
---
Indeed
---
I know plenty of streamers who went and are getting back home Thursday 
---
Buh... But... The delicate blood point economy!  They'd be destroying Wall Street almost as bad as they fucked up Elm Street! 
---
Exactly, why does everyone forget about enduring? Ffs, the perk will stun for 0.75s on pretty much every killer, it's way overrated. The fact that it causes exhaustion makes it even worse. Meme perk at best
---
Soft and wet 
---
Myers in Tier 3 has the exact same TR as Doctor does. Doctor has the calm add-ons, but Myers has insta downs. It balances out pretty well.
---
She's not old, you're young.
---
I want seven espressos in a big cup with two energy shots.

Most of the time, something hits you for the last bit of health you have and you get immediately turned into giblets.
---
These deaths are only from special kills.
---
Happy birthday man !
---
Yes, but 1665 is still an accurate number
---
So the author of the second one got his hand stuck and in a minute decided "fuck it I never liked that hand anyways"?
---
lmao the pig one is so true

Christ just give him the answer !

Don't know man probably 12pm EST Friday

4 seconds for a 20 second regression penalty? That'd be insane with Surveillance and Ruin.

Or modern day northwest America.
---
When taking into the fact that it’s a change of pace to the game? Of course I am. I’m a killer main btw- so yeah I’d rather them not be punished for every action they have lmao. If games last longer I won’t care that they can heal faster- but i feel it would be too slow if everything they did was slow or blocked on someway. The pace of the game now , self care is perfectly fine- heck maybe it’ll  be fine even with this hold up perk. Can’t tell til it’s tested.
---
Imagine using shards to purchase cosmetics 
---
Nope, the time for this meme is over. It's dead. Move onto something else.
---
&gt; I’m not sure female plague doctors really existed
---
The Plague Doctor from Darkest Dungeon is female. That's good enough for me.
---
Haha it’s okay I’m not upset about it lol but also I’m a female 😬 i hope it is soon i want to play as that thicc bih 
---
Can we get a DbD Lore Comic and make this a Canon Scene?
---
That's why they gave us so much information 
---
Haha me too but I am more interested in the killer 
---
Wow... so huntress? :(
---
I think in some instances, people realize there's no way out anyway. They might have been on death hook, or just wanted to move on to the next match.
---
Why does it have 2 butts on its head?
---
They were BMing by waiting for the door to be opened..? Or because he hit the crouch button a couple times as the killer approached..?
---
I don't hate the perk as-is, I hate that people would want it to instantly procc as soon as you jump into a locker, without an activation timer, making it an extremely obnoxious and nobrainer perk to use
---
As is, it's fine. Niche use
---
I just imagine with Pizza outfit he bolts out of the locker infront of the killer like “IT’S PIZZA TIME”
---
Not so sure about that. Your terror radius becomes zero so you can't get the wallhacks that your power gives you. Maybe the Survivor you hit  gives you the wallhacks instead?
---
Why don’t they give a release date on this shit, like all the other game makers do! This bs of it’s a mystery is getting old, just put the info out there to get it over with for when we can expect it! 
---
oh, flease.
---
Fair enough, I agree. It’ll give it some use while also not robbing others of their jukes
---
That's how it should work. In the dev stream they say any effects your terror radius has follow the survivor
---
She vomits on survivor, survivor begins to get sick, they have a meter that fill up other time. The more they get puked on, the faster they get sick, if they run or interact with anything they'll get sick faster. Once sick they get broken and damaged. If they touch palets (and probably other survivors and generators) they infect them, meaning if a healthy survivor touch an infected gen/palet they'll get infected too. To get rid of the plague they need to go to fountains to cleanse themselves. But going to a fountain will corrupt this fountain, the killer can then go to this fountain and uncorrupt it to upgrade her power. Her upgraded power damages the survivor instantly on hit.
---
Spirit needed several buffs because she was trash in the PTB. Legion is addon reliant, and very annoying to be chased by, but also stupidly easy to gen rush and get a 3 person escape.
---
No I’m pretty sure it’ll work like Ds where it’ll be 55% less
---
Saw u/PirateSloop ‘s shit post and immediately thought of this 
---
LOL, i kind of expected this comment, since toxic P3 Claudettes are a thing. :p in all seriousness, though, it would be so fun to have a customization set like this! i'd totally buy it for my Meg in a heartbeat.
---
Mentally challenged and European, name a better duo
---
Are you quoting Karkat
---
That too :D
---
Thx. 
---
the second we'd have a cook as a killer this would be funny
---
right now, it isnt
---
Get huntress or sloppy on there
---
why legion specifically for that?
---
Sadly, despite being a big supporter of f13... I also like dbd better.  I think f13 looks better, has better ideas, better atmosphere, and way more potential... and yet I still like dbd better.  BHVR is a hot mess half the time, but that should show you what a REALLY bad dev can do.  F13 was a golden goose, with an internationally recognized and loved horror icon, and multiple objectives, some really cool mechanics, and they still shot themselves in the foot. 
---
You've got a point there. 
---
The guy tbagging didn't even die lol.

How's your dad doing, by the way?  He's not still smoking in bed is he?  You guys have one of those gas log fireplaces, don't ya?

More so Doctor but with vomit 
---
The thing is that most of the Horror Genre is something that won't likely happen to you. That's why we can face it; because I doubt I'll have some weird electrocute me before whacking me with his Masochism XXL Dildo.
---
Getting puked on though? Could happen any time, every time and I would rather note get reminded of that time at Carnival when I was 12. Damn you, Jenny.

Does Beast of Prey and Thrill of the Hunt stack? For Hunter category point gain?

Psst... You're never gonna get Nancy to notice ya, either.  I'm the only one that get her... Fired up.

Ive done some nasty 3 gen with it but more often than not i down a survivor look around and no gen( that are stated)

Understandable! I actually follow that twitter account, so I recognised the image.

As a killer? As a survivor? As a specific killer??????
---
The people in this thread scare me.

Lmao

I hate how i keep getting the teachable perks consecutively but never the upgraded perks, IF I DIDNT WANT IT THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES WHY WOULD I WANT IT 10 TIMES LATER 
---
Legion can easily get Iridicent Malicious and Chaser emblems by using their power naturally. By the number of hits you take to down someone, you can even get a normal pip by one hooking everyone and just drawing the game out by slugging and stabbing. Hell if a game goes on long enough you can get a good or Iridicent Gatekeeper. 
---
touché 
---
Living up to your namesake eh?
---
timer is fine, but say adding 10 or 15 seconds would be a nice buff
---
We all get her on the same release date tho. ❤️

Sry that’s not a new chapter. All staff is busy on new chapters and belly jiggles, no time to fix the most important bugs that prevent players from actually playing the game.

Megs thickness comes from her Muscles due to being an athlete; as someone who's sister was an Athlete I'm actually surprised Meg didn't have a slight six pack in her Cosmetics-- Anywho it's less thick and more of a well proportioned muscle with not a lot of fat to it causing a more proportionate but still eye pleasing look.
---
Jane seems like she's more of a casual excerciser if anything; she's not as toned as Meg and you can clearly tell that while she's definitely not out of form she's also more likely to eat sweet and fat foods. Jane is the real thickness since she actually has fat but in a balanced, non-unhealthy way.
---
I’m literally doing this in every game as her from now on. 
---
I've heard people say that you get an "extra survivor outfit" when you buy a DLC. 
---
So, if you don't buy the DLC, you can't purchase the character and then purchase that outfit? 
---
I've tried reading stuff but I'm confused by this (somehow ugh I feel so dumb) and I need an answer because:
---
I didn't get the DLC for Legion but I bought Legion. Now I want Jeff + Jeff cosmetics. I don't want to buy the DLC if I already got part of it.
---
Then, I want Quentin but not Freddy. So, I don't want to purchase that DLC but I want all Quentin outfits.
---
:-|
---
Can we real talk? Spitter as a killer would actually be really scary.
---
The vomit meta
---
&gt;combine the new DS with Unbreakable and you have to force the killer to make a choice
---
Or the killer could just, you know, not tunnel and both of those are dead perks.
---
No, plague doctor masks contained various strong smelling spices in the beak because people at the time believed that the smell from diseases caused people to catch it, so they were there to drown out the smell from that which was believed to keep you safe. The reasoning was kind of off with what we know from germ theory today, but the full face mask did do a great job shielding from airborne diseases and such. Combined with the full body leather outfit plague doctors accidentally created the precursor of hazmat suits.
---
So basically what I'm saying is that hopefully the pig mask keeps the contagious stuff out of her face orifices which may grant her some protection against the disease in question.
---
The point is you have to learn to outsmart your opponent. Being able to win all the time means the killer cannot complete their objective. All the changes does, is force you to learn to make chases last long enough you can duck them, or they break it off because gens start popping. THAT'S how you win.
---
Also winning and dying aren't mutually exclusive.
---
That's a very i.portant lesson you seem resistant to grasping.
---
You don't need skill to hit someone with a frenzy hit and a frenzy hit is 250 points with Distressing that's now 500 points a frenzy hit. Your engaging in multiple chase because your leaving someone to frenzy hit another if you have all 5 totems that's now 350 points for every survivor found. Frenzy hit also counts towards brutality category as a regular hit as well. So even if you face some tough survivors were you can't even get one kill you will still bank with a minimum of 26,000 point doubling to 52,000 if you can hook everyone at least once.
---
I follow their Tumblr so I recon gnoses it from there lol
---
Well, his parents are anti-vaxxers, and he's 18 years old, which is like 103 in non-vaccinated kid years, meaning he's at the end of his life, and doesn't like to be reminded.

***earrape killer theme***

Yea I hate when that happens. It ruins the point of having it. 
---

Nice. How do everyone make these?

But what if they introduce bounce cosmetics for David's ridiculous bara tits
---
I played 3 matches on PC, and then tried playing one on Xbox, and holy shit! It’s freaking night and day. Even though it isn’t a frame heavy game you can notice the differences. I don’t think I can go back now. Even on low-medium settings it’s tons better than on a standard Xbox. Also, I’ve heard this a lot about playing nurse. I main survivors so I wouldn’t really know, but I can understand why it’s “easier” to use her on PC. I think my whole time playing on console I can count on my hands how many times I’ve ran into someone playing nurse. Everything seems so much more smooth and everything is instant, no delay, etc’. Yeah, there’s no going back now. 
---
Where do people find the screenshots of, say, Dwight vomiting or this scene here?
---
bls I need
---
Ah! Nice!

Every drink orange juice after brushing your teeth? This is pretty normal.

Have a pleasant day.

Sneaky sneaky Wraith.
---
No. It’s not like you could keep using it. And you could only use it somewhat automatically if you were the obsession.  If you weren’t, you’d have to wiggle a bit. Also, it’s not like there AREN’T hooks within 5 feet of each other on every single map. There were many times where I was the obsession and couldn’t even use DS in time before getting hooked because of how many hooks are closely scattered around the map.
---
I just cropped it off of youtube my guy

---
Hey now, territorial imperative ain't bad. 
---
I'm pretty good with skill checks, but during a match yesterday, as SOON as I hopped on a gen with another survivor I failed. They got off and his nearby, and I was like well it's my fault, I'll keep working and deal with the killer. 
---
Immediately failed a second skill check. Feels bad man
---
I'm guessing she will just vomit acid all over their face and dissolve them
---
Hot damn I will always run purple Urban on this woman and will never walk around the map upright again gachiBASS

~~wellwhatvideo~~
---
I think it will be useful on Mikey in tier 3.
---
Yep, I’ve been playing since release in 2016! There’s been literally no positive responses lmao
---
Personally, I still think Legion has been the worst.
---
I honestly don't understand it, but it's better than nothing imo.

---
Jane thiccer than Amber Rose
---
It's a meme, not an history book
---
highly doubt anything like this will be put into the game but very good ideas nonetheless 
---
And the killer can down a survivor again after they’ve used DS. It’s not like killers had only ONE chance at downing a survivor or else they never down that survivor again. 
---
So what is a survivor to do to not be a free hit?
---
I'm newish in the game but can anyone tell me is it worth it to prestige?
---
Papa Nurgle!
---
I know, I wish there was a way to apologize profusely in the game 
---
I find expert survivors pulling me into loops boring as fuck so when I recognize it's happening I just peel off and l look for other survivors. Is this a bad ir stupid strategy?
---
My guess would be next thursday. But BHVR didn't mention the day.

You don't gachi women DansGame

First: you don't

Second: go to the police station and tell them to arest you, not because of the murder but for saying such heresy
---
We all know that billy is the cutest
---
See, I don't know if you play killer as well or just survivor, but time is very valuable to killers. Downing a survivor and getting a hook from it makes at least one survivor stop what they're doing to save them. Chases can last a long time, and if you down a survivor just for them to hop off your shoulder and start another chase wastes a lot of time. It's a good change for the game, and if you depend on DS maybe you shouldn't be at the rank you're at.
---
They said it would be this week.
---
I swear I've been scared more times as Pig at seeing other survivors, than I have been scared playing as a Survivor in general.
---
death is not an escape
---
It’s fine. The whole point is for the killer to feel a sense of urgency to leave the hook.
---
I do it because it's fun for me. Also I've been told in post game chat that it's scary and entertaining for the adventurous survivors as well.
---
True, guess dead memes are part of the entity’s realm
---
I mean, to be fair, it looks like they were a duo and both committed suicide on purpose. not sure why everyone is flaming at first sight.
---
I thought I wasn't that sensitive, but now I'm more than sure that I wouldn't be able to play against this. Just imagine ANY of those parts moving... Fuck man
---
Pfft devs would never make accurate hitboxes like that
---
wed/thur/friday

This week, have fun 
---
Is her face a bit weird looking to anyone else or are we just supposed to accept all the weird looking faces in the game at this point
---
I just plug in my ps4 controller and run steam in big picture mode with the cord in. Don't recall having to install anything so not sure what he is talking about.
---
Yes 
---
The problem was that it inconvenienced killers \*too much\*. Like the DS change notes said, DS could absolutely shatter a killer's momentum, and it shouldn't be able to do that.
---
WHERES NURSE?? poor her
---
imagine not laughing at family guy
---
If you still have the 8 extra meters with monitor and abuse when it actives you might be on to something
---
I think it is good the way it is. Just keep it in mind when hooking someone. Use hooks closer to gens with progress etc.
---
The timer is there to give an incentive to not camp.
---
Cause you’re supposed to take a hit for the injured surv that you unhooked , not hide in a locker you pleb 
---
If you had said "ngl bro... that's pretty cringe tbh" instead I would have upvoted you
---
Hmmmmm
---
The only issue I see with it is the rise of ultra rare items during double blood points events but even then there is way too many perks. 
---
The beak opens up when she charges her vomit
---
How dare you you OINKfucker
---
For killers who struggle to 4k, yeah
---
Yes you can. The DLC is listen on the store and you get both the killer and the survivor, or you can buy them each standalone with Auric Cells on the store. 
---
They really need to decrease the amount if they're doing a special week or let us know way in advanced. 21k shards is too much for a week.
---
If this works as im guessing (not seen footage yet, so im assuming survivor just has to wait for killer to be in front of locker) its gonna be annoying getting hachets as a huntress.
---
*Cough* Dwight this isn't even my final form.
---
Default Microsoft font. Would you prefer Comic Sans?
---
They could also just let us opt out of certain teachables. So we can lower the possible perks we can attain. I wish I could unteach dying light, third seal, play with your food , and so many other perks. 
---
im sorry but in the sake of real survival, winning is surviving. 
---
&gt; DS was the only perk that allowed you to save yourself in a really tough situation
---
And it also allowed survivors to just go "nope, I don't feel like going on the hook just yet" at the beginning of the match after a chase when the killer has yet to get a hook. Old DS was horrible on good survivors who knew how to loop.
---
&gt;Return to Sender
---
Uh where did you get the stats that it lasts 10 seconds? .-.
---
Still rather dashing though.
---
Go eat a burger Nea.

To the left of Dwight's head. Above Ace's left hand. Above Ace's left shoulder behind the rubble.

And I think I see Wraith behind the wall in the second panel. 
---
Is that right?
---
I am a thiccer Jeff, more into the realms of Clown ='(
---
Survivors are not on your side! Of course they are going to play in ways that don’t favor you! Why don’t you killer mains understand that???
---
I see Gloria from Madagascar in human form
---
As someone who doesn’t even play as Michael Myers, I love that footprint ability. As I was reading it, I was hoping you were going to include that they didn’t show up immediately, but took some time to show up. I think that’s perfect.
---
On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your weight?  1 being Jane, 3 being Jeff, 7 being Kate and 10 being Feng?
---
I play with two rank twenty friends who are God awful. I tbag so the killer will get mad and Chase me instead of them
---
oof yeah the one I used a while ago, I lost due to infinite loading. Feelsbad

Yeah. It blows.
---
be lucky lol
---
Welcome to a game. This isn't the real world you're using false equivalence. Dying but having a score higher than the killer means you won, and is entirely doable.
---
There is also no repercussions in life because you died here. The only investiture is you. Stop playing to escape, start playing for BP, you'll be much happier in the long run and probably rank higher too.
---
It’s broken because it’s a survivors only means of truly being able to fight back once per game? Wow.
---
I'll have you know I've yet to shave my head or dye my hair wacky colors for attention.
---
As a killer main... I agree. I can hear Jeff breathing rather audibly, “is there an injured survivor near me?” Nope just Jeff.
---
I admit that I don't even give a shit about what happens to the Perk but I'll also admit that it's not as drastically OP as people say it is. Sure, it's annoying when 4 people run it but no matter what Rank I play as Killer, People are either not very smart or they think they're hot shit and Teabag so I usually down them like 3 - 6 seconds after they used DS.
---
That being said I also don't run it as Survivor since IMO it's a waste of a Perk Slot; kinda feel bad for DS Mains though, I guess. At least the none Toxic ones.
---
She aight until you get to that face.
---
The dev stream
---
Same
---
What the frick? *oink*
---
Aside from survivors not meant to be able to fight back at all... Again, it has jack shit to do with it being once per game. A good looper could easily use DS to take a long chase to last another 1 or 2 gens. DS could mean that a survivor gets to run out the door or out the hatch just because they had that one perk. It was flat broken, don't try to act high and mighty like it wasn't.
---
I love the image 
---
I need the vid thanks 
---
No it isn't 
---
They’re probably just doing this to drain people’s shards so they have to buy the new dlc with money
---
Make it something like a 110 speed skiller and his power stops the killer in his tracks and puts you in the perspective of the familiar, like a Cat or something. The Familiar moves at like 130 or 140, and survivors glow in the dark/at a distance for the familiar. It can't vault windows but pallets do nothing to it and it's small so hard to see. It has no attack but if it "hits" a survivor that survivor is marked for 30 seconds and so the killer can see them and gets a movement bonus when in a chase with them or just while the mark is up. When changing perspectives the killer just stands around with a big terror radius while the "familiar" goes back to the killer shack or basement. 
---
Impressive, your parents must be proud.
---
I watched it in full and they never said it lasted 10 seconds.
---
Did they mention if it interacted with bitter murmur? Cause one way or the other ones gonna be a hard counter pick to it
---
if you get downed in 10 seconds, you need to work on something with your gameplay
---
Vomit isn't anywhere near as bad as urine or feces.
---
I swear nobody complaining here has ever been around young children.
---
She may be entitled to financial compensation

She thicc af, only reason 
---
It is incredibly frustrating because I play perfectly stealthy but Jeff has to breathe so loud it gives away my position. I get it, he’s a bit on the larger side but its unfair to people who main him. Not even Clown, whose larger than him, breathes as loudly as him. 
---
It isn’t, I completely agree, but you’re incentivised to go after the hookee :( 
---
They said "sometime this week".
---
I personally think it'll be Thursday or Friday. 
---
Every time I see this picture, I can’t unsee him having Shrek ears due to the alignment of his head and the ceiling lights. 
---
Technically wouldn't vomit make the meta more toxic?
---
Just gonna comment to come back later
---
Not necessarily scream but you make a pained noise. Lets the unhooked survivor know you need to bail asap.
---
honestly the only time that DS really bothers me is when a non obsession has it. you chase and down a person and right before you get to a hook, you get stabbed at the back of your neck and you can't do anything about it because you had no way of knowing that the non obsession had DS.
---
Chainsaw doesnt proc the perk tho. Only M1 hits.
---
Introducing the new survivor: Missingno.
---
Why look down? Because you're No longer in a Chase so the timer starts ticking or? 
---
Don't know as nó one tested her yet. 
---
I like stealth...still get involved in plenty of chases and encounters. 
---
Here's my typical experience: I do generators and by the time I finish the second one, the other three survivors have all been downed trying to hook save. Having your team get downed and hooked in the same amount of time you took to wait in the lobby and load isn't what I'd call fun either.
---
Ultra perk is a line of come but Freddy can hear you snorting.
---
&gt; That doesn't scream "the killer is bad, git gud killer!" to me. 
---
But crying to devs about a survivor's perk does, right?
---
Don’t get ahead of yourself. The fact that the devs thought Legion was ok to release says a lot. Plague has that same tunneling aspect Legion has. Its designed to go make everyone sick and spread a plague around but most people are going to play braindead and just puke constantly on one survivor until they go down. Then wonder why they’re getting “gen rushed”.
---
I’m sorry u don’t have eyes man 
---
Lol, it's fine. In all honesty I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up with dances eventually. 
---
I know, but thats why my post says "thoughts" about perks and stuff :P
---
But this is a game. Not a job.
---
Yikes my dude.
---
That’s why I run rancor
---
You need too play survivor buddy I play both and it is much more stressful playing survivor
---

Spine Chill doesn't increase vault speed. It speeds up repair, heal and sabotage by 6%. 
---
Enjoy your 1K.
---

---
Once I unlock a perk on a character I should be able to upgrade it to the next tier for 10 BPs. So when you get BBQ one the Plague, upgrade to tier 3 immediately for 20k BPs. No one likes the “bloodpoint grind” when it comes to perks, its just annoying not having the build you want.
---
&gt;It's not "crying", but continue being salty, I guess?
---
On paper she sounds like a really good killer. From what I see she is ment to apply pressure by infecting as many survivors as possible to force them to use fountains and get off gens. If she can infect things like gens and vaults survivors will be less likely to want to touch them. If survivors are too stubborn to cure themselves then they will eventually be downed/be sick and give away location to killer. If there are any negative effects such as slower movement speed etc that will also add to her potential. She really feels like a massive timewaster for the survivors and will be a pain to go against. I honestly hope and believe she will be up with spirit on the tierlist
---
Ah yes, the original is how I found r/samespecies. I approve of the edit.

Also, do you know what the difference between something like the ruler which decreases the time to refill the power gauge and Joey’s mix tape, which decreases the cooldown duration of feral frenzy?

If you think challenging yourself in a game is comparable to a job, I dont think youll be having much fun regardless. 
---
I mean, coffee prevents you from falling asleep, but it won't wake you up if you're already sleeping
---
I play them kinda like the Pig. Trying to Deep Wound as many people as possible to slow the game down, then foucs on downing them. As for builds, i dont havem any perks yet since i dont really play too much. 
---
The Pig and the Legion are kinda the same with there power.

Basic attack is M1ing. So it should work

Weird. I have one more guess on what's going on. Maybe they don't believe it was your account?

Being 100 lbs overweight also helps
---
Vomiting has always made me nauseous and fee disgusting.  Chronic stomach pain has also made the whole situation extra gross for me.  That, and I guess being sick is the closest thing to torture the average person can feel without another party involved.  I think this actually makes her the 'scariest' killer for me.  But she's also my favorite, her design is amazing and I want to get good at playing her.
---
It does. https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill#Affected_interaction_speeds
---
&gt;Vaulting speed of Windows and Pallets.
---
Her stun lasts for like 3 seconds, the alert probably for five. It also tells survivors to GTFO, meaning they can't flashlight or pallet save, basically at all
---
Do you have a link to a clip?
---
lol fair!

Its hilarious how loud he fucking is.

I wanna upvote this but I can't

Discordance has been a game-changer when it comes to generator grabs in my experience. I like using Monitor and Abuse, BBQ and Chili, Hex: Ruin, and Discordance whenever I play prayer beads.
---
There should also be a Starbucks on every map, and it had the benefit of preventing you from being able to be put to sleep, but it costs real world money, and transfers 25% of it to the Freddy player's Steam wallet.
---
BIG AGREE

Doctor as in an AOE affect in front of them. Pig as in a secondary objective to remove their threat or debuffs, and boomer as in vomit.

---
I like how it looks, if you don't like it then don't comment
---
I was talking about the game not fucking grammer. Everything is spelled correctly too, sorry the way i type doesn't please your typing fetish
---
Here's how I see it:
---
A large sum of plague virus got sucked into the entity's realm when it took her down.
---
Obviously vomiting on survivors the way she does is *possible* but it's safe to assume the entity is helping her out.
---
The way I see it is that the Entity is 'enhancing' the Priestess by turning her body into this vessel for the sickness.  She can generate/project this warped version of a real life illness that was made to infect survivors efficiently, thanks to the entity.  The speed at which it progresses isnt real-world normal, so this makes sense.
---
As far as the fountains go, viruses mutate when jumping from host to host.  The entity probably picked up on that and twisted it.  When a survivor cures themself at the fountains, they leave behind the corrupted fountain with all their mutated purge in there.  Miss priestess comes over and drinks from the fountain, introducing the newly mutated virus to her system.  Her entity changed body produces a ton of this new strain.  Now that it's been introduced to the survivors bodies, it now knows better how to harm them.  Because entity logic.

The update fucked up both the colors and the lighting on the corn, I'm still hoping they change back a lot of stuff to how it looked before the update.
---
Running around in circles work better than butt-dancing imo but yes
---
Why?  While I think it's cool it wouldn't explain why shes all fucked up around the face and arms.  She's sick.
---
Unless the entity made a 'fog virus' that the Plague now Carries, it wouldnt really fit.  And really if the entity makes anything, its typically orange and black themed with a black smoke.  
---
THE DS CHANGE IS NOT A NERF. PERIODT. 
---
I’d rather have the game fixed than having different type of booties ngl
---
We chest bumped with a David squad non stop till the killer found us when he was released.
---
Haven’t played in months 
---
Lol indeed
---
It could be nothing and I wouldn't be bothered.
---
Nope. Chapters ALWAYS release on Tuesdays, but 6 they need time for post-PTB adjustments. So expect it on the 19th.
---
You're lucky. Either that or still new.
---
The problem with DS is that for every second a survivor isn't on a hook, three more are working on generators. When the obsession goes down, everyone expects them to hit the DS, so they don't stop what they're doing. Every second counts, because every second that nobody is on a hook is a second that three people spend on generators. A 10 second chase means 30 seconds worth of generator progress if everyone else is on one.
---
Killers need hooks to keep the game lasting longer than 3 minutes against good survivors. One hook means one guy is disabled while another is going to save them. If the killer starts another chase right after, that means only one guy is working on gens. It's not a 1v1 game. You're facing one enemy, but the killer is facing four, one at a time while the rest do the objective.
---
It fits the game just fine. It's a game about horror movie tropes. Vomit is a commonly used in horror movies. If you can come up with a half-feasible reason why it doesn't fit, then you might have something resembling a point.  Until then, all you've said is "vomit is like poo poo and pee pee."
---
Looks like a lil bowling ball
---
Then they fuckin run away instead of just finishing the last 30%
---
How do you know?
---
&gt; admits they don't actually know how the power will work
---
&gt; still complains about the killer
---
yup that there's a survivor
---
Yea I totally agree, I personally feel she will be very strong but we will have to wait and see, I'm excited to see how she plays but the complexity of her ability and how she can infect generators and pallets has me worried, thanks for commenting 
---
Freddy actually killed every single child from the preschool. I can’t remember the exact number but it only left Nancy and Quentin as the last men standing. 
---
I counted the number. 11 kids in total is his kill count. Add on Nancy’s Mum and that’s a total death toll of 12.
---
&gt; I'm simply stating my opinion I wanted a discussion about it hence why i created the post
---
None of this means you aren't complaining 
---
😂 you know it 
---
That sucks.
---
DS Meta, some interesting and fun new perks, very fun looking killer and thicc survivor.
---
The thicc meta is changing rapidly
---
I think the people who talk about it like it instantly wins the games are just bad at chases. I deliberately eat the DS as early as I can. The time it is most powerful is downing someone right by the exit gates. Anyone who uses it at the beginning of the game is bad or is messing around.
---
when i play her and someone offers me a medkit i'm leaving them alone the whole match because i appreciate the concern and care
---
God you're right. The new killer is anti-vax.
---
This is very true will be interesting for sure thanks for commenting 
---
And ruin a perfectly good suit, no Thank You

That's what they get for just sitting in a locker lol

oh i know i'll be running it on doc for the memes

This comment section is a mess.

You're the weird one in this situation. The only people I see capitalizing all their letters is little kids so...
---
Also this is exactly what the comment section is for. People are commenting on what you wrote and clearly the whole capitalizing every letter was a bad idea.

Well put. After I first played killer I didn't get salt from survivors but I respected killer mains a lot more. The sheer amount of stuff a killer has to track is amazing. Welcome to DbD and don't let the salt get you down. Keep trying and don't fret about ranking up imo. 
---

No, just the usual butt dance and flashlight blind.

i spent 800k bp on nurse before i saw hex:ruin havent even seen level 2 yet and ive spent prob close to 500k
---
Development cost reason, why design all new assets and tiles when they can just create one large main tile, then use red forest tiles around it they have already made. Saves money and time.
---
Its a shame my fat ass can't woddle over to a gen fast enough
---
And that children, was how the trappers virginity was robbed from him by nea.
---
Whatever man, of course you go to the "you're a little kid so stfu" when you know nothing
---
It ain't any better for us non colorblind people
---
Shhh... Ace hasn't been right since... the accident. Best not to push him
---
They said the lore reason in the stream can't remember it but they said it. And the better question is why does the carnival map take place at a chapel.
---
As long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters lol
---
Keep on legioning and learn to enjoy the salty tears 
---
Well I'm hoping PTB happens Thursday then so we can at least get some decent game play
---
What do you mean no? I was just impressed, that is all. 
---
Just from leveling Claudette, I've gotten three different perks to rank 3, with each one having its subsequent "rank up" in the bloodweb after the previous rank. And once for Meg.

I did say you were a little kid. I'm saying that I've only seen little kids do this. Relax.

About the question: they said something about the entity recreating the temple in the red forest. Now the **real** development reason we don't know.
---
I mean huntress downs you instantly if she finds you (if she’s good) and a good hag predicts pathing so she has already trapped areas your going to run through 
---

---
Meanwhile Michael Myers with his 40m terror radius at level three when running Monitor and Abuse.
---
Not with your ugly face. I'm glad my dad burned you!
---
Except it only works when you're not in a chase.  Which if you've been afflicted by Dark Devotion means you've already been M1'd so no Stake out Tokens for you.
---
This also applies to the I got rank 1 posts...
---
hehe can't hit me
---
I've hooked someone right by an open gate and camped him while two of his teammates camped him too. 90% of the time it is stupid not to camp when the gates are open, because excluding greedy survs going for the hatch, the only reason to not leave is to save their teammate.
---
Just laugh at them, if I go down by gate with gens done, I expect to get camped, every time I don't, I get unhooked and escape, often leaving the killer with no kills.
---
Very pretty and I love the makeup
---
They literally said this week and in a stream Not Queen said this week also
---
Pretty sure you can take it with you if you escape the killer. So now you can use Stake Out :)    
---
Indeed, but I did not want to make the same joke as the one I saw.
---
You wish you didn’t see a drag queen? Really? Jesus...
---
It was reverted because hatchets were literally phasing through people because survivors have no hitboxes on their limbs you jackass.
---
Its actually like 1.7 seconds given that enduring increases recovery rate by 75% (so 1.75x), not reduce stuns by 75%.
---
It's because the speed difference is much bigger, you see those two numbers like they are pretty close, but the "catching up speed" is actually  1.5 times bigger for normal movement speed. That's why hope is so strong, iirc it makes you go 107% meaning catching up is almost twice as hard.
---
The hag really does suck ass, especially when you get those people who spam the hag's power, pretty much throwing any type of stealth or evasion out the window.
---
Yeah swf isn't toxic haha poor Billy.
---
Lore reason: the Entity recreates the place where the Plague had lived with the priests, based on her memories. Probably to please the killer, or because having a place where killers have lived important moments of their life makes them less likely to run away
---
If I'm not mistaken there is a scene with an actual adrenaline syringe in the remake.
---
My name on steam is MoriMeDaddy. A survivor by the name of DontTouchMe said he would mori me with Devour Hope - laughed and carried on. 
---
Match starts and Im the obsession. Huh. Whatever I continue on until all gens are popped. 
---
Do you know how fucking fate had to line up for rancor to choose me as an obsession? I dont care he went straight for me, it was god damn fate I was chosen. 
---
Killer probably gonna leave the survivor to get a grab
---
what am I missing here
---
I don't like Ice in my water, it chills it too much and it gets in the way of a smooth refreshing drink. Normal chill is just fine.
---
Yeah but you'd have to escape pretty quickly after being hit to make propper use of your time charging tokens before it wears off.
---
The entity calls you
---
TY!
---
Bruh in my last game last night someone said something like “gg but no offence the hag sucks ass” and then left.
---
&gt; but if being infected just means an action/repair speed debuff 
---
Is that right? U get infected and get a debuff (repair speed)?
---
Legit it touched me in a way no one has. 
---
I am well versed in that particular crouch.
---
Didn’t know this, it’s my first season at rank 1 and I just felt it was really disappointing.
---
I'd make it like this but you would have to level up the killer once to get the teachable back
---
I am not saying this is what they should have done i am explaining why a game developer would do that. Their lore reason is just a bunch of BS to explain why they didnt create a new tileset. Specifically they said the entity "recreated" the temple from the plague's memories but placed it into the red forest as an amalgamation of the two worlds.
---
In dev speak this means "we did not want to put in the resources for a whole new map tile set and haven't used the red forest tileset for many maps yet, so lets just add the new killers map to the red forest tiles"
---
Day 25 of nofap: I just nutted to this
---
Is this the scene from Gerald’s Game?
---
Judging by the killers play style, he looks new and I’m betting you guys are low rank trolling new players. I know I shouldn’t be laughing at this, but damn this shit is funny.
---
I’ll borrow you some time .
---
Legion is not bad, he/she is just annoying to play against. Saturday I got matched against Legion 3 times in a row, and all those matches were boring as fuck. What's the point of chases if you can't go 5 seconds without being hit, can't stun him/her because all of them respect pallets etc
---
this is why I run friendly bing bong (always bring the bone clapper and a transition speed up)
---
Plot twist, it was Haunting Grounds
---
Oh wow sexy 
---
I'm a bit confused on how Sole Survivor works. What do they mean by sacrificed survivors? Do they mean hooks that survivors have been sacrificed on, or survivors still in the sacrifice animation(being pulled into the sky by the entity)? I understand what they mean by "dead", just not "sacrificed"
---
When will they realize that spamming content may not be the best way? We have over a hundred perks with 3 levels each. They should rework some things or it might really go sideways, already does kinda.
---
I’d still bang 
---
I wanna put it on doc to be more of a meme
---
I'm like a thicc  Meg lmao. Also love your make up and outfit!
---
This happens WAY to often now. I press DH, exhausted status effect, I die anyway.... 
---
Legit there are people who blame lag when they don't experience lag because they played bad.
---
Do you have the original wuthout the freddy face?
---
Spirit herself has some decent perks. She has three perks that have synergy with those from other killers. They are as follows.
---
Spirit Fury and Enduring. Break a certain amount of Pallets, and the next one instantly breaks and mitigates the stun, meaning you're ready to roll almost instantly. 
---
Hex: Haunted Ground and the altogether too crucial Hex: Ruin. There are now two Hex totems that spawn. One is a decoy, "death totem", the other the actual curse. A cleanse on either of them makes it so they can be instantly downed. Avenge your poor Ruin if they cleanse it early with an extra hook or two. 
---
Finally, Rancor and Save the Best For Last. Hitting anyone that isn't your Obsession makes successful attack cool downs go like *that*. Rancor makes it so that leaving your Obsession alive long enough royally screws them over. The Mori itself doesn't count as technically hitting your Obsession, so you'll be guaranteed a swift kill while only losing two stacks. 
---
&gt;not even close to being the worst killer 
---
That’s where you’re wrong kiddo
---
When they say they put one but they actually didn't... Never use my BPS on randoms again.

The Plague is the next killer.
---
Nope, she is 115% fam.
---
did they died?
---
It was indeed a joke. It has no relevance and that's why I said it, thus where the joke part comes into play.
---
you are making me cry again :c
---
Reminds me how the ranks are bugged at the end screen showing you the rank you would have if you got the pips again you just gained.
---
That’s fine, but it’s not each individual legions fault... I just don’t see how dcing is the way
---
I find many of the killers annoying as hell, but I’m not going to selfishly dc just because I get downed once. It’s not good for the community I have an excuse of “legion is boring/unfunny/bullshit, so I can dc “. 
---
It ruins your teams chances (or drastically reduces them) and the killer still gets points for you, so you’re not really hurting them, only making their life easier. But sure people will be people and stay selfish because they have an unfun trial, I guess? 
---
Appreciate the comment btw, respect everyone’s opinion, but I can’t get behind a dc, for the survivor and killer sake
---
It's not about anger, just that Legion isn't fun to play against
---
You have the same nose, holy cow. See nothing wrong here. 
---
On one of the devs twitter they have stated when the survivors are fully sick they are injured and have the broken effect. Also a bunch of tidbits of info too, such as being continually hit with the vomit speeds up the sickness, etc.
---
I've played more Spirit than any other Killer and I had no idea that's how the audio effect worked. Does that mean that perks such as Monitor and Abuse actually be bad, or at least suboptimal on her?
---
After years and years of skinny ass surviors we are excited ok 
---
The Cloak
---
The Cowled
---
The Diseased
---
The Healer
---
The Pox
---
The Purifier
---
The Repenter
---
The Plenty of other shit to call him, not that I necessarily want a Plague Doctor as I don’t find the concept particularly interesting.
---
This picture makes it look more like a closet. 
---
That doesn’t excuse dc though... 
---
I mean I guess they can do whatever they want, but it’s silly and very selfish. 
---
Many people I know hate facing Freddy or doctor as well, should we dc every time we fight one of them as well? 
---
They have to be killed. I'm pretty sure the only thing that doesn't count is a DC
---
Yea and that’s fair I’m just p3 hag and huntress so I understand them really well also why did I get downvoted?
---
Which is why I questioned whether or not it was, either way that should let you know it was an unsuccessful one. Honestly I still think it wasn’t and you’re backtracking solely because I brought up the possibility. Thanks for clarifying though.
---
Drop all levels please. It was already an issue what value to change on different levels + a level 50 character will actually be almost perked out. Give rewards for those who already grinded them.

That oatmeal got nothing on her.
---
You forget crouching with pig at an exit gate with BloodWarden = let's get 'em.
---
Thank you! Yeah I was mimicking the style they used to draw the perk. But that is a pretty fabulous pose so... maybe it is a closet? *wink wink*
---
Well they definitely make ‘em OP and then nerf them. This one comes with 115, anti-gen, and a projectile ability. So yeah, I agree, it certainly looks that way. I think she’ll be The (Plague) Doctor 2.0.
---
What's the wooooshing radius of the spirit in phase walk?
---
I think you are mixing up thot with god 
---
This is amazing I want this!
---
These are so cute, especially the Pig (I might be slightly biased on that one though since I think she’s ridiculously adorable to begin with). Well done!
---
Is there usually a sale on older dlc b4 release of new chapter? or am I waiting needlessly 
---
I think it would be fine because your radius increases in chase (which my mind game example you would be in).
---
And the sound effect itself isn't directional as far as I can tell (at least not easily) so even if a survivor heard it, the odds they successfully find the right angle to hide is slim imo. 
---
I’ve seen many times where the killer has gotten 4k’s from camping. Especially against over altruistic swf. There’s also many times where I could have easily stomped a team if I were to have just tunneled the already injured player. Idk, having stats would definitely be intriguing but I’m not sure if keeping stats would fall in line with how this game is played 
---
I am a survivor main but trust me I know it's wrong to balance around kills, finished chases might be a better idea. Also you need to consider when nerfing survivors that the reason they have a better time is that non busy survivors can just afk on gens. What I'm trying to say is don't touch the chase mechanics, change the objectives for the ones that are not in a chase first.
---
If you’d stream on twitch I’d be more likely to watch
---
You are pretty,she is not XD P.S This in my opinion
---
Did I miss something? All looks normal to me.
---
You’re talking about a different perk.
---
That was a piss poor implementation of side objectives.
