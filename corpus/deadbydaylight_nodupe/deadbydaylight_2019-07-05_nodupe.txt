Spirit!

---
Spirit, good perks and second best killer in the game.
---
So what do you do then when all the survivors are waking up? Y ou c ant be in 4 places at once. 
---
Freddy will lose the war of attrition hate to break it to you. The Gens and ?Waking up will get done faster then Freddy can hit them.
---
Yeah it's stupid that no work is required for it anymore.
---
I can guarantee jack diddly shit in that reply of yours is not going to help. I did that stuff. I did that stuff. I did that stuff. **I. FUCKING. DID. THAT. STUFF.**
---

---
Also, I must tell you again

**LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK**
---
When I say I did everything I meant it, man.
---
I get you wanna help but you just aren‚Äôt helping. Now I gotta use the ‚Äúspeak‚Äù option on my giant Lu-ck to calm down and laugh the pain away (Lewwww-w-w-w-w-see-k)
---
Share it to YouTube?
---
I agree that Prayer Beads for Spirit and more blinks and range add-ons for Nurse should be nerfed, but these people want to nerf these killers base kit and with that I don't agree.
---
I‚Äôm with you brother. New toxic pig and Meyer Mains are Toxic GF mains.
---
yyyeesssss, the meme potential be real
---
Better than old one as his power doesn't hold him back, however, he lacks tracking ability and chase ability. His only benefit is high map pressure but not near nurse or spirit level. His cooldowns are super high with little payoff. Might be mid tier?
---
Like I told another guy, Freddy has to use his aura-reading to the utmost and learn how to juggle survivors. He has to learn which survivors to prioritize over others (such as one trying to wake up) and learn when to drop something to go after them. His whole thing is literally about dragging the game out for as long as possible and slowly whittling the survivors and their pallets down.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to that guy just run what you wanna run.
---
How is his chase worse then before? He had no Chase before.
---
But like I don‚Äôt get how I‚Äôm supposed to play the game y‚Äôall are mad at any and everything? Someone rescued their team from the hook....the rescuer had not been on the hook yet so obvi I‚Äôm going to go after the survivor that had been on the hook apparently that‚Äôs tunneling? Like just accept defeat and quit trying to bash me fore being good at the game?
---
I would rather have Doofy from " Scary Movie".
---
Alright man. If that‚Äôs the case, then I hope your luck improves. Guess there‚Äôs nothing else to do then. Also I have no idea what the last part of your message meant lol
---
Beautiful killer drawings for the meme
---
Ok. And you juggle survivors by walking across the map at base speed which will take longer then the time it takes for them to wake up. 
---
Its immposbile to do taht with all 4 survivors if they are good.
---
Did I mention his chase being worse?
---
WAZZAAAAAPPPPPP
---
But really, I'd be both bemused and thrilled if it was poor ole doofy üòÇ
---
Agreed. I got 7 followers after a month and i like to try and keep it mellow. I got 1 guy who jumps in every time i stream so it starts with 1 and goes up from here
---
I was playing to complete some ghostface missions on the saw map yesterday. I encountered a 4 people swf all doing gens while I chased someone who would pallet loop me then swap out when I got a hit in. (I'm not very good with ghostface yet and I dont know the map). They opened the exit doors on the other side of the map so once I hooked one I face camped them. They all tried to rescue and in the end one died on hook and entity killed the other two in front of exit gate. I dont know if I'm the asshole for face camping at the end but it sure felt good when they flamed me after the game. To be honest I dont know what I could of done against them unless I was the nurse.
---
I said he sucked at chases, past and present.
---
Yeah but even the other killers like Pig, Billy, Trapper, Plague, Huntress, Legion (Deep Wound timer) etc. don't give themselves away until they use their power or someone finds the map object or sees them. 
---
Freddy is known by all survivors as soon as they have control over their character because they'll see the sleep cycle clock. I just think it should be hidden until the first time any survivor falls asleep and it's "confirmed" you're going against Freddy.
---
... I literally have said repeatedly the Freddy has to keep an eye on all survivors and stop ones who are doing something important, like waking up. If survivors are all waking up, the Freddy didn't do his job correctly and isn't really making the most of his aura-reading. He will win the war of attrition if he does it right.
---
I dont care , how they price their stuff. Just curious: Do you think skins in LoL, Overwatch Lootboxes,FiFa lootboxes or FF14 cosmetics are overpriced too? I'm not attacking you. I'm just interested, if you think about these , that they are overpriced too,since they are kind of the same concept. Thats what gaming industry has been come to. ( Not blaming you or anything just curious)
---
It's a build that's basically a literal joke, there's a ton of other perks that do the job better, the build isn't niche but just not effective enough to actually implement.
---
Crazy thought, but maybe this community has different people with different opinions who will speak up at different times.
---
It's not a hive mind.
---
Ok. Seems ok. Honestly I wish they just buffed his old system. Like make it so you can‚Äôt get out of the dream for 60 seconds or make it so waking up takes longer. Also maybe like the fake pallets or something in the dream.
---
cool.
---
Yes
---
Ahh sorry, I'm a snarky guy when someone makes an argument i personally can see working but then wont take the cons along with it. I agree that iron will also works, you'll see me saying it along the thread, but refusing to take the cons along with it is ridiculous as well as not admitting it's a crutch. 
---
I never said I wasn't running it bc it was a crutch (why you're putting words in my mouth), I said why replace one crutch with another. I also said i dont have t3 and that its booty without t3, therefore it wasn't an option. 
---
 I'm trying to solve my problems, I've been for the last 100 bloodwebs. The post was a salt post about missing something I like using for my builds but thanks for the tip. 
---
No point disagreeing more though, I get what you're saying... I just prefer something else and you might be different, ya know?
---
Thanks for subbing, you get: hshskkfjrekwleorificiske.
---
Then the Freddy would put them to sleep again, choose which survivor is most important to him in that moment, and go from there. Also, you're acting like power range add-ons and skillcheck chance reduction add-ons aren't a thing.
---
That‚Äôs the way it was in the livestream. The devs just failed to mention it as my post says
---
I‚Äôm not bashing you at all. All I said was what you are doing is nothing that special and you could get the same effect on any killer
---
It was when he was released.
---
I understand man, I will continue doing what I think is optimal until it changes i suppose. Thanks!
---
Literally my inbox is full of messages of pissed off people
---
Ok. So then by the time you put one of them to sleep, the o thers would wake up and visa versa. 
---
I dont count Add ons because add ons shouldnt make a killer useable.
---
The fake pallets are an add on atm. And his traps only slow for a short duration, and his teleport has a 45 second cooldown.
---
If you dont mind me asking what games charge 20+ dollars for cosmetics
---
In short: survivors fall asleep passively over 60 seconds and Freddy can force someone asleep by hitting them.
---
Freddy has a 32 meter terror radius which is heard as a heartbeat while survivors are awake. When fully asleep the terror radius heartbeat is replaced with his lullaby which is non-directional.
---
 if a survivor is outside of the terror radius Freddy is completely invisible. As Freddy approaches he flashes in and out of visibility. When Freddy is within 16 meters of a survivor he is fully visible.
---
He has three powers: Teleporting to gens is part of his base kit as well as setting up snares. Teleporting is a channelled ability while up to 10 snares can be placed while moving without any slowdown. An add on replaces snares with the ability to place fake pallets which up to 10(?) can be placed at a time.
---
The teleportation takes a few seconds to fully channel and has a cooldown after being used. This cooldown is shortened by 15% for each survivor that is fully asleep up to a 60% reduction of the teleportation cooldown.
---
While channeling, the gen will spurt blood to alert survivors nearby that Freddy is cumming.
---
Snares inflict slow for a few seconds and prevent fast vaults but can only be triggered by a survivor who is fully asleep. They can be placed mid chase. They are two meters in length and probably can't be dead harded over but are more easily visible than Trapper's bear traps.
---
Fake pallets can be placed wherever pallets can spawn. When a survivor throws it down it breaks into a shower of blood and doesn't stun Freddy. Like snares, fake pallets are only visible and triggered by fully asleep survivors.
---
As soon as Freddy slaps someone, they're asleep, otherwise falling asleep is passive. Freddy will be able to hit anyone at any time.
---
Dying doesn‚Äôt equal being trash. 
---
And getting a 4k doesn‚Äôt make you good. 
---
Just thought I‚Äôd put that out there for you.
---
Actually they did say it was.
---
And how do you do this with all 4 survivors at once if they are all on different parts of the map?
---
His chase is defetinly better.
---
Yeah cause killers are never toxic either, their always innocent angels.
---
&gt; it has a 45 second cooldown, so it's not good as a mobility power
---
This logic seems flawed. Even with the 45 second cool down, which will almost always be less from survivors being asleep, utilizing it effectively should still make it a valuable tool.
---
Yeah well killing all the survivors definitely doesn‚Äôt make you trash just thought I‚Äôd put that out there. Lmao
---
They make killers better.
---
*sigh* You're completely ignoring the juggling points.... And it's regardless if you count add-ons or not.
---
I just don't even try anymore. I ask to get seen for the killer instinct to call them out.
---
they said that small game notifies you when a pallet is fake.
---
I feel like he does not really need a buff I find him pretty damm balanced and requires a good amount of stalking skills
---
No. Your iginoing my post. How do you expect to juggle and stop all 4 survivors from waking up when they are all on complete oopsite sides of the map? It takes longer for you to move then for them to wake up.
---
Uh lol you sure you‚Äôre talking about true? Tunneling and camping? üòÇ
---
I mean that's just like your opinion man. I average 19-20k bp a game regardless of rank and escape fairly often. I'd say that's pretty effective.
---
Wait when? I heard in the middle of the video they said it does not and at the end they said maybe they will make it counter but they do not know
---
Range add-ons and skillcheck chance reduction add-ons are a thing, you know. As is, as I've said multiple times before, keeping an eye on survivors. I've cut people off from waking up, for example, just by knowing they're running in the direction of a generator or using Self Care, and stopping them before they got to the generator or finished healing.
---
I ran a leather face around for 3 gens on hospital then got face camped guess I deserved it though
---
survivors will never wake up and just genrush this bitch
---
YOU ALSO LOSE YOUR OFFERINGS I BELIEVE. GRUESOME GATEAU DO NOT GROW ON TREES.
---
To the best of my knowledge, chase wise theres the survivor's music they hear, the killer's music, then Micheal's. 
---
But what I mean is the ability in customization to be able to pick what theme plays while in a chase, it'd be more customization options and add some variety. Music is a pretty large factor in games and while many overlook it, it adds tons of suspense depending on the music playing. 
---
The current chase music is alright but adding more options could add to peoples enjoyment, i know some people change their icon colours just for the sake of it, it has no purpose other than the customization factor as only they see it
---
Oh you deleted it, why?
---
sounds like a weird combo of multible killers from how you put it
---
Finding a teammate using bond is much faster and has multiple benefits. Most people using self care would rather heal then do objectives (bias). Most people believe it's a waste of a perk slot and promotes selfish play. Medkits exist.
---
Ok. Then you waste time while the others do it, so you leave them, and then it repeets. Thats not fun for either side having a game that never finishes because the Freddyt cant do anything. 
---
And i dont care if Add ons are a thging, add ons shouldnt make the killers power useble.
---
Spirit, very strong and rewarding killer.
---
we wanted Freddy buffs and not a rework that will make him weaker
---
nea has been hitting the gym
---
That seems fine. Looks decent at least
---
Sure, still sucks compared to 80% of killers. He has to rely on preset traps that *might* get him one hit.
---
Nope
---
Yes I‚Äôm aware. That‚Äôs how it was in the livestream, the devs just never mentioned it. So people thought the only sleep method was to just wait.
---
you are the single worst thing in this community, this community is terrible, i have never seen a more toxic community, but you by far are the worst thing in it, i hope you leave the internet and never come back, please delete this comment and block yourself from commenting again
---
You're also refusing to count add-ons, and cherry picking a situation to fit your argument. I've explained this multiple times to you, but you refuse to truly understand it. Freddy has to use his aura-reading to juggle survivors harder than any other killer. That includes when survivors are separated. It's highly unlikely that all of them are trying to wake up at the exact same time, and not to mention that if all four are asleep, he's near *at least* one of them.
---
Definitely better than waiting 7 seconds to swing for sure . However, they removed his ability to see auras in the dream world. He's no longer invis to awake survs and there's no action penalty for being asleep
---
Yea that‚Äôs the one thing I don‚Äôt like
---
I wasnt aware you had to be hit to fall asleep?
---
he kinda is just watch the video
---
I just want them to fix the bugginess with revealing him. I couldn't reveal a Ghost Face when he was a few feet away because there was a single corn stalk next to him, then in the same game I could reveal him around corners and over objects with no real line of sight to him. Both of those scenarios are bullshit.
---
You should sue him for plagiarism @BladeOfWoah
---
Just take in a brown medkit with bandages and you're all set. Itll be there for that occasion where you cant find anyone.
---
And your clearly not reading what im saying either. Your littrely just  repeating the same thing over and over without giving anything else to support your claim, which means you dont know how to answer. 
---
Why would all 4 survivors NOT be trying to wake up at the same excat time? Would why  they not take adnvarge of knowing where Freddy is? 
---
So hes near one of them, the other survivors know this, then all wake up. Your the one being troublesome and refusing to acuallty support youtself but are acting like a record.
---
I definitely agree more music would be cool.  I wish they'd tailor specific ones to each killer as well.
---
Safety Measures and Check Mate seem interesting, especially the former. I don't like Chess Wizard though. Having scratch marks that divert from the direction you're actually going could be too strong. You seemingly recognize that too so to balance it you say that your aura is also revealed while this perk is active, but then that pretty much defeats the whole purpose of the perk. It's suppose to throw the killer off your scent, but also reveals your exact location to the killer. Like a Starbursts that's a contradiction. Safety Measures could shake up the meta a little. Any dropped pallet the killer leaves unbroken could potentially come back to bite them in the ass. Then Check Mate seems like an alright exhaustion perk, and has great synergy with Safety Measures. It's a risk/reward exhaustion perk. There's always that chance you'll get hit through the pallet or before you could actually drop it, but if you get the stun it can help you escape or get to the next loop.
---
I too love The Thing, and would love to see Mac in DbD. A map at Outpost 31 could also be super dope. Then there's all the crazy potential of having The Thing itself as a killer.
---
Tis going to be a long while before nurse spirit and billy are dethroned
---
Even though his traps are much faster then both Hag and Trapper and act more like Clown gas?
---
Only problem with the teammates is that except if i‚Äôm in SWF , the randoms start running away from me like i‚Äôm the killer itself whenever i try to show them i need heals 
---
But thanks for ur answer :) 
---
I understand better why people don‚Äôt rly like that perk
---
But what if I wanna bring a toolbox or something ? :(
---
worldwide I did it and I live in Italy right now...
---
Corn stalks always inhibit sight mechanics. He can't stalk you either and neither can micheal. Blame the corn
---
Yea. I played billy for the first time the other day and got a 4 kill. Spent the first 2 mins practicing the chainsaw and I was set for the rest of the match.
---
what does the nurse have to do with this?
---
Then do it, you'll just need to find people. I have games where I take in a toolbox and I dont have self care or bond, I just play Injured til I find someone
---
At least they have humor about it
---
101 bugs in the code,  101 bugs 
---
Take one down patch it around 103 bugs in the code
---
It wasn't inbetween us, it was to his side and he still exposed me.
---
Is clown high tier at all? And his is a ranged throwable, he's decent at chase but has nothing on huntress, hag, nurse, spirit, billy. The actual good chasers
---
You'll never find someone that wants to respond to this sort of question. Only when it comes to bhvr and dbd do people have an issue with skins/cosmetics being 'overpriced'. $10 is about the standard for most skins/outfits/cosmetics in most games nowadays but you won't find people that shout louder than the dbd community when it comes to 'high' prices.
---
Hmmmm, I guess I can't tell ya without any visual, sorry about that.
---
Yeah often times I'll try to run around something but they'll just stop and get closer to start charging again. 
---
Also try this but usually doesn't work unless they're very impatient. 
---
Usually I get hit normally when I vault a window because they don't have enough time for the chainsaw so I guess I'll have to stick to windows.
---
Especially when you‚Äôre rank fucking 11 like don‚Äôt call me trash because you fail to be strategic sis
---
I've had the same thing happen to me with a flashlight save.
---
Rarely have I seen a game charge 20 dollars for a cosmetic. Infact I don't think I've ever seen it. Street fighter 5 has them for 6-8, Dota has the community market where prices are changed based in rarity but it's individuals who out them up and not the company. The boxes containing the items are like 3 bucks. You can't seriously tell me 10 dollars for 1 cosmetic, ONE cosmetic is justifiable when you can get Dbd for like 20 bucks, a full game which contains like 6 killers and survivors, literally the entire gameplay mechanics (the entire game), maps etc. That's ridiculous. BHVR does a good job charging for their gameplay DLC but I'd rather it be the opposite. The killer/survivor packs should be more expensive because they impact gameplay heavily. I personally don't think cosmetics should be more than like 2 bucks in any game except for limited edition stuff.
---
Normalising 10 dollar costumes just because other stuff is more expensive is not ok. If one costume was 1000 dollars would you be ok with that if other games charged them at 2000? Of course not because that's ridiculous. $10 is alot to some people. BHVR does do a better job than other games, infact almost every other game when it comes to quality cosmetics and add-ons. But charging 1/3 the price of the game for a single costume is insane.
---
Obviously that's just my opinion, and it's good the people who buy costumes support the developers. But if the cosmetics were cheaper, more people would buy more of them and they'd probably end up making more money anyway.
---
Btw this comment isn't really aimed at you (except for the first sentences). I just needed something to quote with a few points of my own. No hard feelings friend!!
---
eh, wasnt a big fan of it anyways, i posted another i like better haha.
---
Personally I like it. But if you have iron will then you could pretty much stay injured in a game without making too much noise. Sometimes self care helps, especially if you end up in a game and nobody is altruistic.
---
It‚Äôs been a long time since I played it but I‚Äôm pretty sure Fortnite skins are $20 each
---
Very informative.  I'll use your advice and sew what works for me.  Thanks.
---
Nah, if he wants to copy a dumb joke for internet points, good on him. 
---
I got downvoted for pointing it out, but that's ok, I guess I'm being petty.
---
Ps4
---
Well ive plaued primarily killer, and i used it until i discovered sloppy butcher, whoch slows the game to a point that if NOED is needed, im just playing like absolute shit
---
U serious?
---
Jesus man, settle down. 
---
It‚Äôs just a game!  :)
---
*Please don't be Nurse*
---
I just had a guy message me ‚Äúbye lgbtq supporter‚Äù yeah it‚Äôs just a game alright...
---
Time for a decayed March
---
$10 isn't even that much compared to other games and their cosmetics. I swear it's like you people have never played another game besides dbd. LoL has skins that can go up to $25 if you want to ignore prestige skins which could potentially go from $100-150 if not more.
---
I have a better offering. (Ultra Rare) If 3 survivors burn this offering, the Entity removes the Killer's power. If all 4 survivors burn it, the Entity claims the Killers weapon until the end of the trial.
---
This image radiates with intense power that none of us know the full extent of and I fear we never will
---
As is tradition
---
Hmm idk
---
Spirit with multiple totems, fun. Legion? Run sloppy butcher, tanathaphobia, nurses and they will heal forever. Plauge? If you like beating diabled people. And Myers if stabby stab
---
Top 10 Instant Karma
---
I‚Äôm confused is the teleporting just anywhere or is there certain conditions that he must follow to teleport. Can he teleport anywhere or just to gems or something?
---
Depends if I‚Äôm killer or survivor.
---
LoL is a game that I played that got crazy with skin prices. Some skins now ranging from $25 up to $100-150 or more if you really want those prestige skins.
---
Can someone link me the OG pic?
---
I'd just think you wasted your time digging through my years ago history like it means something? You keep questioning my intelligence like your opinion means literally anything. You're literally an accident from a broken family who encourages their uneraged kids to drink. I don't think Mr fetal alcohol syndrome should be questioning people's intelligence, my dude. Anyway, I have to go back home after work where I won't have to go home to alcoholic parents. Have a nice night :)
---
Well yes but MoM got nerfed, DS and BT only deters from tunneling. Adrenaline might be a bit too good, i do agree. And exhaustion is basicly a little safety cushion, id say balanced bc of the cooldown. So theyre reliable, once
---
That's an option, since he can place them for free it won't ruin him, it'll just make those loops empty instead of fake empty.
---
No, I wouldn't say it's petty. Especially if it is true. Don't be afraid to speak up if someone is claiming what's yours as theirs. Even for something like this.
---
So is he
---
I am confused by this comment. Are you trying to say you think Freddy in his current state is OP?
---
Just vault the totem
---
Thats true, but its worked in the past. Better than vaulting windows and getting hit through
---
Not for me sadly
---
I don't think it matters what killer it is. I've had it happen on Nurse, Hag, Huntress, Legion, Plague and Ghost Face. I don't even get exhaustion or anything, I get nothing. No prompt to use Dead Hard, pressing it does nothing.
---
Doctor pallets are a small part of some addons, they're just meant to be a little extra confusion. Freddy's pallets would be his main chase power when he's using those addons.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, college Jersey frank will always be more intimidating and imposing than no tiddy E-girl Susie
---
Tremors could be useful on Freddy
---
Then give survivors another way to break chase or somehow defend themselves.
---
To be fair she is at least 19 because she goes to college and has a job.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change how much of a creep that guy is though
---
Ain't that the fucking truth. Turned Surround off, and it worked fine 1 game. Now it's back to being permafucked for me. :(
---
A single survivor can make a few more mistakes than a killer and still survive. 
---
Thing is, there are 4 survivors. That's 4x the number of mistakes. Contrary to popular belief, survivors are human too and are subject to mistakes.
---
Survivors who make minimal mistakes can and will still get screwed over by a teammate who made one. One survivor screws up and 3 people end up on a hook. Or mistakes turn into a chain reaction; one person messes up, forcing a risky play from a teammate which doesnt pay off etc.
---
It's mostly just rank 20's who don't know how to play the game.
---
That was satisfying to watch.
---
As always.
---
Feels bad man
---
We just gonna forget Hag
---
I'm not saying you're factually wrong for enjoying Freddy. I'm saying you're factually wrong for thinking that a Freddy rework won't benefit the game as a whole, as Freddy in his current state is extremely unhealthy to play both as and against.
---
Make sure to jump in it with wild abandon despite not knowing what's in the darkness!
---
Freddy is my favorite killer but I have to admit it can be hard work playing as him and playing against him can be very unfun. I don't care if he is strong I just want him to be like Plague and GhostFace are for me which is fun both to play as and to play against.
---
Sure? He's fun but still not viable at higher ranks without addons
---
I got face camped by a killer because apparently we weren't "making it fun for him" we'd got 2 gens he'd hooked 1 survivor before that and then I got hooked as the second gen was completed. 
---
Called him out on it and he said we were rushing gens and not getting into chases with him...... How can you get into chases if you fucking face camp on the second hook? He literally just stood there and watched 2 people try to save me chased them a bit and came back to me. (By a bit I mean literally 3 steps.) Also he cried about us LoSing him when he's playing Myers.... The kid literally wanted us to stand there and let him kill us and play the game his way. 
---
Honestly never understood why face camping was never made Banable, most unfun experience.
---
I play pig and I was told I was a scary piggy the other day! It made me very happy to hear. :&gt; 
---
I pride myself on my spooks!
---
Hag has horrible gen control lol she has good hook control though
---
Like in the movies? Yeah 100% I agree haha, for some reason I thought you meant he was OP at one point
---
No, getting hit puts you on dream world completely. It‚Äôs being slowly drifted into sleep that you want to prolong as a survivor because being fully asleep makes his teleportation cooldown faster and if addons depending can make doing gens harder.
---
ah uh i may have misunderstood what they said.
---
League of legends? Came out well before Dead by Daylight and their standard for skin pricing would be $10. LoL also has 'legendary' skins that go for $15 or 'ultimate' skins that cost $25 or even prestige skins which can potentially cost $100-150. Sorry but $10 for a skin has well been normalized so try not to demonize bhvr for following a standard thats already been set.
---
I switched it out for aftercare... don't miss it.
---
I don't think it's that big a deal, lot so killers already have ways to tell like Pig or Trapper (I've spawned right next to a Pig box or Trapper Trap many times as a survivor) and most Billys, Doctors, and Nurses you know within seconds as well
---

---
Could also be a way to make juking at higher ranks more viable, and also give more use to tracking perks. I really don't see many drawbacks for adding doors to the game...just make them more rare than pallets.

That's like the definition of tunneling. If you do it you do it but don't be surprised people dislike it.

When running around something, it‚Äôs best to make sure it has a pallet, when you work on a gen assess your surroundings and locate the nearest pallet.

Try to be as unpredictable as you can, not much else can be done if they get too close.

Getting downed is a part of the game, sometimes the hit boxes are broken and there‚Äôs nothing to be done, just gotta try to get better at looping.

---
That pallet is bad
---
Then no offence but you should be playing Doctor or Legion; not Freddy. Freddy doesn't even farm points well in the games he holds hostage.
---
Which is another thing: Freddy doesn't even stall *well* when compared to the likes of Legion and Doctor. This again ties back to the fact that literally nothing happens when you play against Freddy and it's boring. When you go against Legion and Doctor you have to avoid their powers and play around them to try to get the last few gens done. Against Freddy he just sleeps you to make you do gens at a snail's pace and make you literally unable to Wake Up unless he hits you. If Freddy doesn't hit anyone and has all the Survivors asleep it's literally impossible to Wake Up, which means that Freddy has a global UAV drone on all of you at all times and you literally can not do gens. But because Freddy has zero chasing capabilities like Doctor stopping pallet drops or Legion catching up to you with Feral Frenzy all Freddy can really do is hold the game hostage until the gens are finally done.
---
Freddy doesn't get points. Freddy doesn't get kills. Freddy isn't easy to play. Freddy isn't fun to play. Freddy isn't fun to play against.
---
No matter how you look at it a rework is a very, *very* welcome change.
---
Ohhhhh, gotcha
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
**"Anyone got a change of underwear and maybe a med kit?"***
---
In my experience 9/10 times someone will spawn next to a Jigsaw Box, Trap, or Fountain anyway and tell their SWF about it. Doctors usually have someone screaming within seconds since he doesn't care about being hidden, and a smart Billy is probably chainsawing around the map until he finds someone anyway
---
Most killers don't have or need that element of surprise. The ones who need it generally already have it
---
We don‚Äôt know until he‚Äôs testable on the PTB, he‚Äôs got some map pressure, and some chase potential, so I doubt he‚Äôll be low tier, but we can‚Äôt know yet.
---
I'm thinking Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Discordance/Tremors/BBQ, NoED/M&amp;A?
---
Sloppy to slow down waking up since they need to be healthy first. Ruin cause gens. Discordance or Tremors to give you an idea of where to teleport to, alternately BBQ because it's BBQ. M&amp;A could maybe have some use in getting to survivors because of your invisibility but NOED probably gives better value.
---
Ghost Face should have immunity to detection perks in Night Shroud. And also reduce his cooldown to 20-25 seconds.
---
Doctor's pallets are a passive effect, they're not his main power like Freddy's.
---
I have to disagree; I think the new Freddy will be absolutely disgusting when played well or cheesed. Like, potentially DC wave-inducing. 
---
Only fully visible within 16 meters. Glimpses from 16-32 meters, so that's going to get extra steps on survivors occasionally--not even factoring if you run M&amp;A. 
---
His snares are placed instantly while moving full speed and give away location (useful even if not actively chasing someone) and act like clown's tonic (multiple, instantly placed tonic bottles around a loop? Ouch.). Or, if running the pallet variation, likely multiple free hits throughout the course of a match. Sure, they have to be asleep, but you are on a constant 60 second sleep timer, so it's not something Freddy has to actively invoke. Do you stay vulnerable to his power or waste an OBSCENE amount of time constantly waking up (which they have to be healthy to even do--more wasted time)? They stated only the farthest alarm clock will wake you (so, run all the way across the map), teammates speed drops with each wake up action, or give away location by failing a skill check. Factor in status effect and aura reading add-ons on top of that. 
---
Then there's projection, which has a 45 second cooldown, but can go as low 9 seconds. 9 seconds between warping to any unfinished, unblocked gen on the map. Survivors get 3 seconds of notice and it takes about an extra second on his end for the animation. Let's just forget that many of the hooks are right by gens and that MYC exists, because people definitely won't abuse that. And, how do you counter BBQ without wasting a ton of time if he can be to you in 3-4 seconds? Oh, right, you don't and it will be a constant hook-chase cycle. Or, bitter murmur and project to the next gen over to cut them off. 
---
He arguably gets weaker as the game progresses, since he can't get his projection timer as low; however, he'll be able to use his snares to help force you to waste time, cross the map and risk exposure, gen patrol, preemptively cut off loops you'll seek out when he projects, etc. Survivors hated the constant mending, but will love constantly having to wake up or playing more stealthily? Okay, if you say so, BHVR.
---
So, I get that they want another powerful killer, especially a licensed one, but I just don't see this going over well.
---
DUDE HECK YEA
---
And she better get voice lines like ash
---
I'd love if she had some shit to say about the spirit lmfao
---
Happens all the time against blendettes.
---
The response is exactly like rework Legion
---
What did you want? Instantaneous gen teleport and exposed effect traps?
---
Yeah, basically
---
Swap out Save the Best for Last for Nurse's Calling, and you'll have a pretty solid build. When you get Nurse's to tier 3 it triggers at 28 meters, which is outside of Spirit's 24 meter terror radius.
---
Thanks :D
---
Wait whuaaaat?? That‚Äôs the cherry on top to this killer
---
That‚Äôs the best part about console, you can‚Äôt see the chat afterwards.
---
did u played the new freddy? because u look very secure about what ur saying...
---
God this meme is getting so old.
---
Lol that‚Äôs awesome
---
i take offence to this i think im rank 19 or 20 don't play survivor a lot but i don't run till i see the bloodlust in the killers eyes
---
I wanted a Nurse plus. Gosh behaviour, coming out with balanced fun to play killers. /s
---
Freddy's new power is gonna be complicated.
---
I'm just saying that there is very little reason to cleanse against plague except to avoid being one shot which isn't that big of a deal in high ranks and Freddy seems like there is even less reason to actually play against as intended.
---
I think they're all meant to be bought with money but if you play a lot they want to at least let you get something for free.
---
I see more people quit against Freddy than anyone else. I only plaay Freddy when I want to steamroll the survivors now. Update has me concerned. Nothing I can do about it but wait to see.
---
*infinites*
---
Lmao what? Not every survivor main thinks Freddy Freaker is OP. That would be rank 20s who still drop pallets right as they see them in a chase.
---
I expect something that was actually helpful yeah. The traps just means that you have to play against Freddy as you play against clown and since you can see blood spewing from the gen you to a pallet and if Freddy faked it you just run straight back. More useful than current Freddy but still worse than Legion.
---
Really? From what I heard that was one of the most popular songs off Swimming and one of Macs best notes to end on...
---
When did I say that Killers we‚Äôre not toxic? Furthermore, when did I say that Survivors are toxic? I said they‚Äôre overpowered. There‚Äôs a difference.
---
It was a joke, Jesus Christ people.
---
Why? Its an ultra rare and sleeping isn't that bad anymore.
---
Memba when billy was shit tier? I memba
---
Part of the problem here is the pip system itself. I liked it better when you were basically guaranteed a pip when you killed three survivors. In the current system, getting a pip at red ranks usually requires killing all four. If you only kill three, then you'd better have a near perfect game in every other category, and have multi-hooked the survivors that you did kill.  
---
  
---
This is a bit silly. It's like you have to actually have to wait until you are in control of the game, and then farm the survivors for as many points as possible to pip. This problem exists for survivors as well, but the recent changes to survivor pip conditions and emblems have improved the situation.
---
I think you meant "you're"
---
I think killers sometime do it cause they mad at you
---
this wont make sense for killer with different addons and also what about teachables that have not been learned, it doeant make sense, i feel that it will be completly different when this comes out
---
theirs nothing wrong it people just like hating on certain things in games, just dont be one of those people that heal in the corner of the map, its really bad. go heal next to a window or pallet.
---
true, though i will wait until the ptb to see if Dream Pallets to slow you down like Clown Gas does or not. if so, then triggering them is useful when not in chase
---
[Dead by Daylight - Year 4 Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large)
---
I don't need to go into detail about how waiting 7 seconds to hit a Survivor after you find them isn't fun, so let's go into why Freddy isn't fun from a Survivor's side:
---
Before you even fall asleep Freddy is invisible. He still has a "terror radius" (lullaby) unlike Wraith which means he can't use his invisibility to sneak up on Survivors, but what not seeing Freddy *does* mean is that if he comes close to you it's very hard if not impossible to effectively hide from him. Against other Killers you can see them moving around your hiding spot and try to position yourself better but against Freddy you just have to hope that he doesn't see your ass poking out behind a rock and come over to touch it. This almost guarentees that if Freddy finds you he'll put you to sleep and start a chase.
---
And as for escaping Freddy that's pretty much impossible because of the aura reading he has. He either follows you until you blow up a gen to which he sleeps you again, or he follows you until someone else wakes you up and then he sleeps both of you.
---
And playing while asleep is literally not an option. Excluding the fact that he can see you across the universe there's also the fact that gens are done *so slowly* while asleep. There's no way in hell that you're going to do all 5 gens while the entire team is asleep; you're essentially forced to wake up. Something I like about the rework since being asleep is no longer a "fail state" against Freddy but rather something that happens. It's not ideal but it's at least tolerable unlike current Freddy.
---
Freddy is unhealthy for the game because he removed all skill from the game beyond the ability to loop, and the thing is that he makes the ability to loop so easy for Survivors that it literally doesn't matter how bad the other aspects of gameplay against Freddy are. You can't stealth against Freddy, and you have to waste time against Freddy in the most boring way possible. People meme about Legion being Mending Simulator but at least you don't have to actively stall your main objective, and make a loud noise alerting the Killer of your location. Freddy boils the game down to its most raw bare-bones elements and he interacts with those elements so poorly that the game doesn't become fun for anyone.
---
I guarentee that if Freddy was "good" (didn't have to wait 7 seconds to hit someone) and still had his current power a large portion of the community would jettison themselves from the community and Freddy would have a higher DC rate then Legion, Doctor, Billy, Spirit, Nurse, and facecamping Bubba combined. If you've ever played against a mid-way decent Freddy with Sloppy Butcher and Dying Light (or if the Freddy gets lucky and his Ruin doesn't get destroyed) you know how fucking *agonizing* Freddy can be when he has just a little bit of help. Freddy is literally a war of attrition for both sides: Freddy win when all the pallets are gone, and he loses otherwise. There's zero interactivity beyond that. You run him around until either the gates open or he bloodlusts you and you go down.
---
There's obviously more nuance to this but in a very general sense this is the issue with Freddy. He removes every aspect of gameplay other then chases, and does the chase so poorly that the elimination of other gameplay aspects literally don't matter.
---
No, the cooldown is faster for every survivor in the dream world
---
The gen teleport sounds eh on small maps but large ones allow him to have a ton of pressure. Especially with Ruin + surveillance or discordance. And good Freddys will set up false pallets near gens to lull survivors into feeling secure.
---
Survivor - make sure to be getting chased, healing, working on a gen, or, if it‚Äôs necessary, cleansing a totem. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take hits. Try to find out what perks the killer is using and remember them (If they show up right next to you after hooking someone, they probably have bbq, if they avoid going near the hooked survivor, they probably have devour hope/ make your choice etc.). Don‚Äôt feel like you need to unhook instantly, work on a gen for 30 seconds and then run over. You‚Äôll learn more as you play more, always keep an eye out.
---
Killer - Think about what you would do as a survivor. I‚Äôve caught people who were exposed because I figured they‚Äôd go in lockers since they had nothing to lose and that‚Äôs what I might do in that situation. Recognize survivor patterns - do they backtrack a lot? Do they try and hide during the chase or just try and loop you? Keep pressure on as many as you can, you can leave a chase if you aren‚Äôt doing so well, and sloppy butcher makes it easier to leave after injuring someone since they waste more time. You might know about moonwalking and hiding your bloodstain, but it does work quite well most of the time. If someone is flashlight saving, you can drop the survivor you‚Äôre carrying and chase them, because now one person is on the ground, one is being chased, and one will usually leave a gen to heal the downed one, leaving just one person working on a generator.
---
Welp, guess I‚Äôm a dunce.
---
Now all of China knows your here
---
Thanks for the write up!
---
I only do it because it's better than sitting there and doing nothing.
---
what
---
Imagine still fighting about consoles ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Like decisive strike, body blocking, dead hard or flashlights? How many defensive options do you want.
---
Maybe, maybe not, depending on what it's paired with. But if dude is right and another perk covers it, than yeah its right up there with Third Seal.
---
Wait so windows of opportunity will show fake pallets?
---
You always fall asleep passively but a hit automatically puts you asleep.
---
i dont run till they are almost on me. thought that was pretty obvious
---
No problem!
---
My mindset as survivor: play smart and have a good chase, cus that the most fun to me and also knock out a gen or 2 while helping out teamates. I usually trade in myself to save a teammate so he / can escape since i cant care enough to escape. Still ends up in red ranks.
---
As killer: im usually playing rather fair until i get a reason not to, i hate scumbags who farm their teammates, sandbagging them or if they  do something towards me thats unnecessary annoying. But all in all i try to have fun with the game and if i lose a game i will still drop a gg if they played well.
---
You messed up the save, the killer has to be done with the pickup animation for a pallet save to work. Game still gives you killer stun points even though you messed up, and wasted a pallet.
---
Fucking ez as pie. I know you don't have much to do when the last Survivors are hooked but don't be a toxic asshole who hits people on the hook and nods. Take your victory with respect and don't be a sore winner.
---
You on pc?
---
Darn.
---
Yet again you fail in reading comprehension, my parents do not drink, nor do I. Why is it pathetic when I look through your post history, but it is fine when you go through mine? Once again your critical thinking skills are proving to be lackluster at best. 
---
I find it hard to take your criticisms seriously when you legitimately thought you didn‚Äôt have to repay your loans because you chose to spend your money on pot and luxury items. How could you honestly go through any kind of school and be so ignorant to think that you could just elect not to pay back your debts?
---
Overpowered.....that‚Äôs funny
---
Wraith is fine tbh I think he's really underrated. [Trapper though...](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage/)
---
well old freddy doesnt work at all, if you buff him he becomes a slug god, which is just boring to play as or against; or he could stay weak. Instead the devs gave him a proper treatment, a rework, stated loud and clear since the anniversary, which is possibly the best thing they could have done to him.
---
Yeah they specifically addressed it on stream that it will show the fake pallets when you enter dream world. So if you run WoO then you just need to keep track of which pallets were there before and which weren't.
---
But survivors who don't cleanse vs Plague means they effectively have to play with No Mither - no bleeding  - the injured noise reduction + the coughing and puking and fart clouds. Also with a certain (Ultra-Rare) addon Plague sees where everyone is once they're fully sick. Combined with an apple and non-cleansers you can just infect everyone to max, grab the corrupt purge, and rush around slugging everyone with your super puke.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage/
---
Yeah so you have to squash em out fast, zone survivors, and know when to not break unsafe pallets when it's desperate
---
Slugging, choosing 3 gens, good perks also help
---
You don't even really need any add-ons
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you have poor connection and that‚Äôs it.
---
Observing, like a researcher in the Savannah on safari! üèúü•ºüëì
---
I agree that teleporting to gens gives Freddy more map pressure than before, but he's still mostly an m1 killer. Also false pallets is only a thing with a certain add-on and they don't appear unless the survivor is asleep, from there it is just a memory game of what pallets were there and what ones were not though. Considering fake pallets is a add-on, that makes Freddy similar to Wraith where the killer has a really good add-on that makes them really good but there base kit still kind of sucks.
---
Also Pop Goes the Weasel should be insane on new Freddy.
---
Why would you spin around lol? If the chase activated it means you‚Äôre looking in their direction
---
1. Decisive strike and body blocking only occur AFTER a chase.
---
2. Dead hard is a single dodge and flashlights are a laughable suggestion.
---
Its a bad pallet
---
I know it‚Äôs bad on Xbox. Since ghostface came out  and the game is free with gold pass, everybody‚Äôs been playing killer more than survivor, so thats caused long killer queue times.
---
You keep talking broken home boy. Pls don't procreate! The world needs less people like you in it. You are beneath bacteria. Sub human filth. Gross.
---
Gotta say hag is one of the easier killers out there, just place traps at gens or hooks or even pallet places and you can get hits or sacrifices. Hag is infuriating for me because whenever I unhook someone when they land on the ground the traps goes off and here comes the insta smack, its just not fun
---
If more survivors are asleep, Freddy has a lower cooldown on his generator teleport.
---
They're more defensive options than you need.
---
It could also be your internet, too.
---
Wonder if I wanna kill myself after this game.
---
I mean I get it that‚Äôs why y‚Äôall are mad
---
How? Half of those only occur AFTER a chase. And body blocking is beyond unreliable.
---
I'm really excited for his rework honestly! At first he was fun to play but he's gotten kinda boring, so I'm really hyped for this
---
What's wrong with a little bit of chaos anyways?
---
Combine rank 3 nurses calling with rank 3 sloppy butcher and you'll have a better chance catching survivors out of position and it also slows down the game more. Healing vs spirit is absolutely necessary, abuse that!
---
These are available after every chase x4 of you. Apart from DS. These arent even everything you have access to.
---
So what you mean is quick and quiet into a locker? 
---
Okay!!!!
---
I hope to one day become an upstanding member of society like you. Too stupid to read basic sentences or binding legal contracts, so lonely that you only post about your cats and poor life choices, and so toxic that you try to personally attack people over minor disagreements‚Äî meanwhile still trying to act superior to everyone else. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to end up with your life? /s
---
(I‚Äôm adding the /s so even with your low IQ you can tell I‚Äôm being sarcastic.)
---
I played survivor main for all 3 years of this game until about this last blood hunt when I had a pig order. I had tried a couple huntress games back when she came out, but they were pretty bad and had me discouraged.
---
Lemme tell ya, I got my first three 4k games playing pig that night, with a little perk advice from my boyfriend (that plays both evenly). üòÖ I had a lot of fun! I've been playing killer pretty often since.
---
Though mostly what I came here to say, is that playing as a killer after this long of being a survivor main pretty exclusively gives me a bit more empathy towards killers. It ain't an easy job!  I feel like the perspective I've gained from playing both modes consistently helps me understand both sides perks better as well, and how to counter them. Silly as that may sound. ; v ;
---
ur forgetting the addon that freddy will get
---
I‚Äôm thinking switching pop goes the weasel with sloppy and save the best with nurses is that a good thing to do or ?
---
You have to remember this is a perfect game...
---
Omg discordance is going to be actual godly on freddy
---
Nurse's is incredibly strong on Spirit. You see a healing survivor and then instantly phase over to them and down them, and like I said at tier 3 it actually triggers outside of your terror radius.
---
Save the Best for Last is more optimal on full speed (4.6m/s) M1 killers. Using it on Spirit is kinda pointless. Not only is Spirit a medium speed (4.4m/s) killer, but as her you can hit a survivor and then phase walk to close the distance, pretty much serving the same purpose as STBFL. You being adamant about keeping it kinda suggests you're playing Spirit wrong, that you're playing her like an M1 killer. Practice using her phase walk during a chase more, and you'll find there's little benefit to using STBFL on her. Also keep in mind that Spirit is the queen of mind games. Learn the different mind games Spirit can do, and you'll find there's many situations where the survivors come to you.
---
Man I just cannot get decent consideration on this site. People just shoot things down. Yeah, I'll try again I suppose
---
I'm not even reading what you type anymore Mr fetal alcohol syndrome. You're really wasting your time here. Blah blah low iq blah blah, it's really all you've got. Pretty sad. Anyhow, I'm home now, cats are fed. Time to not worry about having a pathetic loser family and enjoy my evening. Must suck that you've got to deal with all that.
---
A lot
---
Is it the same game?
---
I would love that. Imagine if during a chase she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúLet me see what you got. What you goin‚Äô do?‚Äù and if you get a pallet stun she says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all?‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet up you lil ugly bitch.‚Äù Lmao.
---
I mostly agree. I love the tracking ability. It's what made Freddy my favorite killer to play as because it's what I have the most trouble with.  All they had to do was add in the falling asleep passively and leave the rest alone in my opinion. And fix the stupid healing someone on the ground blocks you from doing anything and wakes them up. That was really all they needed to do.
---
Dude I'd laugh every mf time, and probably main her if the perks were good üòÇ
---
&gt;Hook first person
---
&gt;BBQ gets 0 auras
---
&gt;Pretend to walk away then come back and dunk a second person
---
Postgame:
---
"omg killer is camp"
---
Community needs a rework too
---
ok :\*
---
So your suggestion is to have every single person run decisive (which has a limited window) and have 3 people ready to bodyblock and just say fuck gens. Ok
---
Is that pyrocynical?
---
The only time that I actually face camp is exactly in these scenarios, getting gen rushed hard so i just make sure i snag a kill and ignore post game chat
---
Lmao I played a game last night against the huntress and was doing one of the generators in the middle of the cornfield and I noticed her walking over so I went deeper into the corn to hide but thought she saw me so I just stood up so she can chase me and my friend can get the generator but she somehow didn‚Äôt see me at all so I was just like okie doke back to the generator then lol
---
Well... to be fair, Freddy is in a much worse place than the others killers. That, and this rework was announced a year ago, so us finally getting news on it is great. 
---
What I‚Äôm confused at is the choice to rework Springwood. I get it‚Äôs not very good. And I get it makes sense to rework Freddy‚Äôs map alongside Freddy. But maps like Gideon are much worse than Badham, IMO. Like, I barely see any hate for it. I don‚Äôt see much love for it either, but eh.
---
Plague has a add-on that lets her see the aura that lets her see the aura of vomiting survivors. Big whoop.
---
Don't like it because it takes away his tracking ability which was my favorite part of being Freddy. If they had just added the passively falling asleep thing, fixed how you can be blocked by people healing someone in the dying state and made it a little harder to wake up he would have been fine.
---
Clown cause you can look down at his gut
---
That works. Thats what i run on my spirit. Ruin, bbq, nc and sb. Since pop goes the weasel got a buff, you can also play around with it instead of ruin. See what you like the best.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even reading what you type anymore... (proceeds to give me a summary of what I just said including you being a stupid social outcast who‚Äôs life revolves around cats.)‚Äù
---
Looks like you just rolled a natural zero on your speech roll.
---
Survivor mains so salty, where the pringles at.
---
Regardless of what they said to you it remains just a game and you remain a massive tool.
---
&gt;Pallet that leads nowhere
---
&gt;Decent
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll use those tools to repair all the generators and their shitty ass attitudes
---
Blocking is only a pain against swf. Red ranks you have to treat most people like they have DS which sucks either way and same with Dead hard.
---
It‚Äôs especially prominent here, but for some reason I think Ghostface‚Äôs mask kinda always looks perpetually confused. Like, if he was given voice lines in the lobby like Ash, they‚Äôd be something along the lines of ‚Äòwhat the fuck‚Äô.
---
Immediately hooking someone instead of going after the other survivor is tunneling. It‚Äôs valid and effective- because tunneling is value and effective.
---
So don't tunnel?
---
Do you think me saying not reading means I didn't see a word or two in there ? Also feeding my cats = social outcast who's life revolves around cats. That's crazy dude. Apparently feeding your pets means that now. Really close dude, you're getting there.
---
Survivors want killers to be pushovers killers want survivors to be pushovers and whenever the balance gets tipped to one sides favor the outcry is so severe that the devs just nerf to oblivion. 
---
I love that they listen to community feedback but at the same time the need to be reasonable

Just use that jane perk with the locker stun

salty killer mains again
---
Just recorded my first online match. Played on an iPhone XS Max.
---
But Tyde Thyme does it XD
---
Lol this comment got downvoted to hell, don't know why, let's admit it, a lot of the shit on here just isnt funny

Reading comprehension... please stop embarrassing yourself and actually read what I wrote. Prove that you can actually read and that you aren‚Äôt just randomly mashing buttons on your phone. I am doubtful that you can actually read, but try this once. I believe in you.
---
Good, map pressure goes a long way to making a killer viable
---
I JUST WANT TO FIND ONE GODDAMN KILLER GAME
---
And pewds?
---
Personally I'd like a QoL change where he starts in treatment
---
Make it so if the killer kicks it and it hits the survivor they are stunned just enough for the killer to wack them, if they are injured it downs them
---
I love how ‚ÄòWindows Of Opporunity‚Äô is shortened to woo.
---
Sometimes you gotta down the guy you just hooked. Happens.
---
&gt;hag you would bring small game,
---
Small game against Hag XD that's a good one
---
yeah, but im talking bout the chase, but he apperently his hit puts survivors fully asleep so my opinion has changed
---
You're like a broken record! This is crazy! Low iq, you lack reading and comprehension, low iq, you can't read, low iq. I get it, you're projecting. You should probably stop now, you look like an idiot. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
---
I will say Trapper, at least IMO, leatherface/wraith/clown are fun to play, Trapper is just boring and frustating, they need to buff him somehow.
---
Sadly the meathooks in that movie are a lot scarier than dbds, the lore of dbd makes it really unscary
---
Do not burn pallets on him. Just run around the loop and he‚Äôll usually rev the saw in order to instabreak it. You don‚Äôt let him do it and he‚Äôll turn into a funny looking M1 killer.
---
Wait where can I find this? Didn‚Äôt know info came out about the rework
---
...and yeah that‚Äôs the point is a fucking game be a good sport and join a different game move on and let it go don‚Äôt attack me
---
I didn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs a thing.
---
No survivor worth his/her salt gives a shit if they are basically no mither vs the Plague. They don't heal because being sick doesn't do anything to them. Doesn't slow down them doing gens, doesn't slow down their action speeds, doesn't cause them to go into the dying state - it's nothing but a mild inconvience of seeing green puke coming from your mouth every now and then. If there was a countdown of going into the dying state unless you heal the Plague would jump up in viability since that would actually affect survivors who choose not to heal. As is, she fucking sucks because her power doesn't do anything. And the few people who do heal against her get instant heal. Healing or not healing, it doesn't matter. And that's why she'll always suck.
---
Couple of ways to get better, first and most importantly is experience.  Learning the maps and how commonly react in chasing situations is very important.  Next, you can watch some streamers play the game.  I personally like watching Farmer John as he plays both Killer and Survivor pretty well.
---
It's not a good game dude just stop playing it you will be happier.
---
Average life expectancy is 71.5 years old, this means you've already experienced 42% of your life.
---
Why can‚Äôt you just wait and play before making your feedback. It might turn out good
---
My perks that I run If I‚Äôm seriously sweating is self care, iron will, balance landing and adrenaline
---
My perks if I‚Äôm trynna be sneaky is iron will, quick and quiet, urban evasion  and self care 
---
If I‚Äôm trynna run the killer around I‚Äôd use balance landing or sprint burst, decisive strike, adrenaline and object of obsession
---
Would it be more fair if killers brought in 1 perk to invalidate 25% of the Survivior power? How would that work? Would 1 Survivior be entirely useless? Would every Survivior suddenly have 1 perk that's entirely useless?
---
Why have you done this D:
---
It probably just waits until you hit the ground
---
:0
---
No.
---
My favourite is Michael. He sounds like he‚Äôs just been kicked in the balls really hard.
---
I know it's not impossible for them to occur but I'm encountering them quite frequently.
---
Seriously though. Even as a SWF group I‚Äôm scared shitless of him
---
I know it'll make me happier. 
---
Because I *have* quit. 
---
It's done wonders for my anxiety.
---
You can counter Omegablink tho.
---
Holy shit I come back an hour later and you‚Äôre still talking to nobody. 
---
Relax kid, the game isn‚Äôt that serious. You threw good sport out the window when you came on Reddit to complain for no real reason. Leave the chat lobby post game and you won‚Äôt be ‚Äúattacked‚Äù.
---
Pallets, Gens, the hatch, killers with traps, there's a few ways to squeeze a few more points even after everyone is hooked.
---
The key to teaching mentally deficient people is repetition. I am trying to help you. Go ahead and sound out the letters with me. ‚ÄúY-O-U N-E-E-D T-O P-A-Y B-A-C-K Y-O-U-R L-O-A-N-S...‚Äù See how fun that was! And even you could understand that! Yay! Now stop sulking around here and go pay back your loans like you had agreed to do so when you took them out! Don‚Äôt waste all your money on pot then try to assert that they just go away if you don‚Äôt pay them.
---
uhh, restart.
---
I mean.... You're aware that was a long time ago, right? They're barely remaining anymore. You really do have no material. Still on the same old shit. Let me know when you have something original, accident.
---
I made this post to strike a conversation ILL POST AS MANY FUCKING TIMES AS I GODDAMN WANT TO ITS MY POST YOU CAN FUCKING LEAVE I AM RELAXED HAVING A GOOD TIME WINNING AND PEOPLE ARE FUCKING ATTACKING ME FOR NO REAL REASON. I was never in a chat lobby!
---
If you mean dc, im fine waiting. My game isnt frozen, i can just only turn and look at options
---
Okay well I think I make my point clear. If people knew what killers they were going up against they could and definitely would bring perks, items, and or add-ons to counter them.
---
ultra rare addon
---
When are they gonna add a squirt gun for killers since thats how survivors think killers need to be tweaked
---
Congrats. You hit the caps lock button and thought I‚Äôd read any of it. 
---
If you aren‚Äôt taking to people, then you aren‚Äôt being attacked. Simple. Quit crying. Move on.
---
Because I main killer
---
I was talking about being attacked in my Xbox one messages not on here dumb fuck
---
Because it takes a lot of time to be really good at this game. When I say a lot of time, I mean hundreds and hundreds of hours. 
---
To be better at this game: 
---
- Start watching streamers that are good at the game and observe how they run certain tiles and loops,  and how they position their camera on the killer all the time. As a survivor, you are supposed to "react" and not "predict" what the killer is trying to do. 
---
- Memorize the maps and where usually the pallets spawn. When working on a generator, plan your escape route.  
---
- A lot of people here, if they lose, it is because the game mechanics are broken, the game is unbalanced and the devs are incompetent. If they win, it is because the other side played bad. Don't be like these people. When you get demolished, learn from your mistakes and think how you could have played differently and move on.
---
I usually run Infectious Fright, Haunted ground, Ruin, and deerstalker if I were to slug, and Ruin, sloppy butcher, Nurses calling and BBQ if I‚Äôm playing normal
---
No u have a good point but if people knew it was gonna be Hag it'd be Urban city
---
Or well, flashlights
---
Urban is better. You can mindgame her traps mid chase and destroying them just let's her know someone is there.
---
Again, they can just fail a skillcheck or have someone else wake them up.
---
True
---
[deleted]
---
We dont know how rare Freddy's pallet add-on is for sure and even you're still using an add-on to essentially replaces one of his abilities to doctor pallets. A whole add-on to make Freddy a slightly better version of the Docter.
---
The hypocrisy is real with you, the only thing you have against me is a post I made on r/stopdrinking and that is all you have to use against me. I am not ashamed of my life, but I think you should be ashamed of both your ignorance and your arrogance. Yes, I have problems in my life but I intend to overcome them. You? Your life won‚Äôt ever get better until you grow as a person and stop acting so juvenile.
---
why did u delete ur post?
---
The perks I typically run on Spirit are a combination of these: 
---
‚Ä¢ Nurse's Calling - already explained this perk's potential on Spirit 
---
‚Ä¢ BBQ &amp; Chili - Does this need an explanation? 
---
‚Ä¢ Discordance - An all around great tracking perk 
---
‚Ä¢ Surveillance - Decent tracking perk 
---
‚Ä¢ Sloppy Butcher - Has great synergy with Nurse's 
---
‚Ä¢ Monitor and Abuse - Shrinks Spirit's terror radius to just 16 meters 
---
‚Ä¢ Hex: Ruin - To slow the game down just a lil bit 
---
I've been thinking about running Pop Goes the Weasel and Thrilling Tremors on her, but just haven't done it yet. PGtW could be a decent replacement for Hex: Ruin because it's not something the survivors can destroy at the start of a match, but at the same time it could also have good synergy with Hex: Ruin.
---
... what? Are you serious?
---
Reasons why I main Michael
---
Just my personal opinion but depending on what you‚Äôre going for...
---
Clown - Fun 2/3 Perks 2/3
---
Legion - Fun 1/3 Perks 1/3
---
Plague - Fun 1/3 Perks 1/3
---
Spirit - Fun 3/3 Perks 2/3
---
I recommend Spirit out of all of them. She‚Äôs very fun to play (which if you ask me is the most important thing of all), is viable at all ranks, and her perks are fairly good. She has great gen pressure with her power and the potential for mindgames against survivors means while she does take some practice, she is brutal once you get a good idea of how to use her.
---
Could just play clown...
---
As a team?
---
I didn't?

How did it work? I mean who's the host? Were they using WiFi or 4G connection?
---
Do you have to kick the pallets first before you can make them fake?
---
I‚Äôm not too sure myself. I can assume the killer is host. And it didn‚Äôt show the type of connection everyone is using. I was on WiFi.
---
&gt;	I‚Äôm gonna commit sudoku
---
Plenty of people giving advice here so I‚Äôm gonna just gonna say, hope it‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm totally stealing this joke.
---
What you can do is if you have a friend with the game, practice looping and escaping the killer in Kill your friends mode. Or you can look up some guides on YouTube for some tips. I recommend the looping guide made by OhTofu on YouTube.
---
So does he still see you outside of his terror radius? Cause I feel if he didn't then dream state would be straight useless.
---
Definitely not
---
Riiiight. I‚Äôm the dumb fuck lol 
---
Keep getting your little feelings hurt so bad by nobodies online that you come online to post about it. The block button is a feature. 
---
I hope you don‚Äôt cry this much normally, child. Deuces.
---
Survivors bitch and whine about NOED being instadowns but not cleansing basically means the killer effectively has NOED + noisy, bleeding survivors for the entire fucking match. I also run Thanatophobia so they have to deal with the slow, although it's more of a psychological thing to try and encourage them to cleanse since survivors hate seeing a red progress bar.
---
Yeah, we complained about legion. But the devs went WAY too far with their nerf, and now we don't see it anymore. I'm rank 3, and play 30 or more matches a day, and NEVER see a legion.
---
It's very sad.
---
He could use a base increase to his shock range and maybe something a little meatier for madness tier 3
---
The best tip is to watch streamers and YouTube videos about looping, and getting experience from playing. You also aren‚Äôt going to reach high ranks until you reach that skill level most of the time.
---
We have closed doors on the game and Lery‚Äôs
---
*Entity would like to know your location*
---
Plague it is!
---
No, you can place a fake pallet anywhere that a pallet would normally spawn as long as you are running the common add-on that swaps out the dream snares for the dream pallets.
---
From what we know of Ghostface, he seems pretty normal. I mean he‚Äôs a narcissistic serial killer, but we‚Äôre given nothing to suggest he‚Äôs any less human than Amanda or the Legion.
---
Thank you.
---
How did it felt control wise? I don't usually like on screen joystick. Is it still easy to navigate?
---
If that's just one game that has costumes over $20 then it's not really setting the standard because if it was, lots of games would do the same. I stand by what I said, $10 is bad but $150 is absolutely ridiculous. However, I can understand why people buy $150. They're the kind of "i'm rich" skins and have a certain prestige about it and if you get joy out of it, it's probably not a waste of money for you. But in general, objectively, it is a massive waste.
---
Also, I didn't demonize BHVR. Infact, twice I said they do a good job comparatively to other games that sell cosmetics. I said they do a good job, and while I wish the pricing was opposite for game content and cosmetics it doesn't take away that their business model is much better than other games. But that doesn't change the fact (for me) that charging for $10 for a cosmetic (you can't even SEE killer cosmetics if you're playing them except in the waiting screen or doing a mori). I don't even know why BHVR doesn't let you unlock certain skins by doing things in the game considering there are SO many opportunities and different things you can do. Everything has to be purchased with real money (or shards but you have to spend a while saving for them and the cheaper cosmetics don't even change appearance much). I think I saw they were planning on doing a season pass kinda thing where you will be able to unlock cosmetics through gameplay which is great but the game is over 3 years old, why this didn't come sooner is beyond me.
---
$10 for a pack of cosmetics? That's fine really. $10 for a single cosmetic? That's rough.
---
Still better than lootboxes though.
---
when dead by daylight gets spooky again
---
dude he is going to be scary
---
Yeah I'm still trying to learn not to panic and drop pallets instantly when I hear his chainsaw lol
---
What if we had that music as chase music for an 106 killer
---
I could watch it forever. It‚Äôs so satisfying.
---
Just played a game and encountered more double pallets.
---
Thank you!
---
Ahaha thanks for the unwarranted therapy. Got to love those neck beard anime watching therapists. You are a nobody and will never be missed whenever you go.
---
You missed one very important thing. Hitting suviviors will fully put them to sleep.
---
Also, do suviviors wake up when hooked now?
---
The gen tp isn't even good, survivors get a 5 second headstart to run away lmfao
---
This conversation is so frustrating. My feelings aren‚Äôt little and they aren‚Äôt hurt. Whether it‚Äôs a game or not if these people said half of the shit they thought was okay to me online in real life I‚Äôd taze or shoot them, fuck off.
---
As a legion main I would like to apologize on her behalf
---
Do you think it‚Äôs out on the Canadian App Store?
---
Never said he was high but he will be at least on par with clown
---
Survivors DC for any reason so that doesn't make a killer a good killer.
---
I stand by what I said. A five second neon light head-start makes his gen teleporting absolutely useless. It's as stupid as the Wraith ringing a bell before being able to hit people. And just like the Wraith sucks, so will Freddy. Giving high rank survivors a 5 second headstart is laughably idiotic on the part of the devs. But these are the people who think the Pig's traps are so OP at the end game, so I expect nothing less.
---
Oh, here comes Freddy again, let's go hide then then go right back to the gen. Big fucking deal. Not to mention his gen teleporting power is gonna have a hell of a cool down. So now only will it suck, but you'll have to wait for a while before using his terrible power again. AND the more gens get completed the less times he'll be able to teleport. Once again they've made a killer who's power depends on what survivors do, not what the killer wants to do.
---
What makes Nurse and Spirit great is that how well you do depends on how good you are - not how good the survivors are. These devs don't fucking get that the power role should not be survivors, but should be the damn killer. The killer's skill should dictate whether it's going to be a blood-fest or a free-for-all.
---
Don't get me started on the snarls/traps. The reason why I didn't mention them is because they are just a more terrible and a lamer version of the Clown's bottles. But at least the Clown's bottles can be tossed in front of a running survivor - Freddy can't even do that. I'll just stop chasing a survivor to set up a lame ass trap while they keep running away from the area and gain more distance - yeah, sounds like a plan for a high rank killer. Oh, oh and did I mention that these lame ass traps are ineffective if the survivor is awake? How pathetic can these devs' ideas get? Worst traps in the game bar none. The Trapper's and the Hag's are far better because their traps actually do something that helps the killer.
---
The only thing that could be good about him is the blood pallets and what do ya know - they made the only good thing that's good about him an addon. Groundhog Day/It's like poetry in that it rhymes. Killer needs something good to make said killer strong? Let's make it an addon, and probably an ultra rare addon just to further fuck Freddy mains over.
---
Freddy will not be a high tier killer. It's still Nurse, Spirit, and Billy fellow killer mains. Nothing has changed, and nothing will change. All that time was spent just to make someone that, if lucky, will be near Wraith in viability.
---
When you grab them so the dc trapper is my favorite killer if your gonna run wax brick run the purple pliers with them so theres no escaping tje trap
---
I mean, can you imagine how broken it would be now that it just passively happens or when he hits you?
---
[removed]
---
Either you or the killer DC. This happened to me before and I acted like I was in a new game to make him dc so I can get my very valuable cake points. ;)
---
There is more than one chase music soundtrack, it's just randomly chosen each chase
---
Wasn‚Äôt it supposed to be half satire half actual slasher movie? So making them ‚Äúclumsy‚Äù is realistic as well as funny, without making them less threatening (because Ghostface can still get up).
---
God lerys would be a NIGHTMARE
---
Shhhh don't tell the devs
---
Seeking validation, most likely.
---
Yeah, it was a necessary change, I'm just thinking he might have been better before
---
Pig could really benefit. I had parties that just 99% as many gens as they can, without much caring about traps even if you figure their strategy early enough, leaving you with m1 attack almost for the whole game.
---
wut, it said to me removed... reddit doing its job!
---
No one has even gotten to play him how can you know?
---
It felt a little odd. But it was my first game. I can upload a second one in a few. I‚Äôm playing on console now. The looking behind Yourself button is nice.
---
I been watching Tru3talent but it hasn't helped.
---
Like I said, I hope things get better for you and you find contentment in life. Things may seem hard and hopeless for you right now, but you can always be a better person.
---
yeah but that doesnt count because it doesnt fit the killer narrative on this subreddit
---
But if you mained Feng and didn't play Doctor at all why would you buy that? If you really wanted the Feng skin you would also question why you can only buy it in a pack.
---
I‚Äôve found that corn isn‚Äôt that bad on ghost face, at least if you‚Äôre crouching but I haven‚Äôt been playing much
---
?? Ok lol
---
This makes me wish there was a DBD equivalent of those guys who make all the 'MOST EPIC PLAYS!!???' montages of Apex Legends and Fortnite and etc, but with close escapes like this or killers snatching up someone at the last second, all edited together so I can watch while eating food.  If there is someone like this please somebody link me.
---
Reincarnated into *FOCUS* on earth and died on a hook for our sins.
---
Glad to see dc's are still thriving.
---
Also, why was your heart visible for a while there?
---
Yeah now I think about it you‚Äôre right. If in the current state survivors couldn‚Äôt fail to wake up, Freddy would be A tier.
---
They didn't mention it at all so it is a bug. However bugs like this are usually best kept quite to keep the amount of people exploiting it to a minimum if possible.
---
Just by using logic, what killer is viable in high ranks without a way to end chases quickly and high map pressure?
---
So Teleportong right to a Gen doesn't count as getting them off it?
---
Not to mention basic hits put people to sleep. Sleep isn't meant to be a debuff.
---
Maybe do research before you bitch.
---
Only available on apple store?
---
That Claudette had a high IQ
---
You need to learn maps first, go out of your way to be chased by killers as much as possible because practice makes perfect.
---
No, they mentioned that I believe
---
Nothing is wrong with self care, people who say it "wastes time" can't count, normal healing takes away 16 seconds from two survivors, self care takes away 32 seconds from 1 survivor, 0 net loss of time. Good if you want to use a non healthkit item and you don't trust that the randoms will heal you. Bond is also good to replace selfcare with, if you suddenly have faith in randoms to not be completely inept.
---
It's funny. As the buff only really upsets the actual Freddy mains who got really good at using him and his powers and enjoyed him for what he was.
---
Everyone who didn't use him are now happy.
---
I do think Freddy was nowhere near as bad as all the memes and jokes suggested. It's just that the joke and meme got so big people just assumed it was the truth.
---
He's still completely unfun to play against. Overpowered or underpowered,  he just slows the game too much.
---
This man knows his add-ons. Have you ever run the trapper gloves with the yellow trap setters. So fast man.
---
NOPE THAT DOESN'T WORK, HAPPENED TO MY FRIEND RECENTLY AND IT JUST PUT HIM BACK INTO THE MAP WHERE HE DIED BECAUSE THE TIMER RAN OUT
---
Legion definitely needs a rework for his power it more seems like Ghostface is what legion was to be mixed with the spy from tf2
---
54 blaze it mark of the best style
---
Once with a 45 second cooldown. If you teleport at any time, 3 people know they're completely safe to do more than half of a gen.
---
There's nothing to stop 3 people from sitting on gens, even once they're asleep. The way the devs are putting it, they expect sleeping survivors to be worried that they need to wake up, but they haven't given sleep any sort of downside out of a chase that makes that a priority at all.
---
"sleep isn't meant to be a debuff," what are you high?
---
I love DBD and i love gaming on mobile, but i'm not sure this is something i'd be into. Mobile is usually something you do for short ammounts at a time, like during your work break, waiting at the dentist office, etc. And tbh i think i'd miss the gameplay from my PC lol
---
But thanks for video was nice to see.
---
Cheers man. I will be a killer no more for these animals. Enjoy a killer less game.
---
It's all too much to FOCUS on...
---
Killers are 300
---
At least 7
---
r/bettereveryloop
---
While his logic is incorrect he is technically right as 96% x 96% x 96% = 88.5% which means there's 11.5% chance of succeeding an unhook in three attempts.
---
That is a visual heartbeat. Instead of having an audio cue for when the killer is close.
---
If your playing with no sound I‚Äôm sure skill checks are worse than wraith is
---
Haha of course man, it isnt mine in the first place:)
---
Gone. Reduced to atoms.
---
I mean I don't really have anything in my post history discussing anything going hard and hopeless for me at the moment so I'm not sure where you're getting that from? Big assessment coming from a guy who went back literally five years to find something about me having a hard time with student loans like that's not normal for most young people. Says a lot about you my dude. I feel this whole social outcast who's obsessed with his pets is a huge projection on your part. Just replace pets with anime and we have a bingo. Lord almighty, I should pursue therapy myself. That was so easy, like reading a book! Have a lovely night weeb!
---
What about that story about small game activating and both pallets being fake? It sure does. What they were not sure about were snares.

Hey I just wanted to say that I think nurse is a very fair killer. That's about it.
---
Most of the time you will go down when the killer locks onto you, it‚Äôs not often they will leave you, so the goal is to survive in chase for as long as possible. When you begin a generator at the beginning of a match, look at your surroundings and recognize what type of loop there is, (where the pallets are and windows) Then, when the killer comes have a plan ready of where you will run. A good perk for this is windows of opportunity by Kate Denson, but I mainly learned looping from videos and practice. Also notice what you killer is doing, such as if they backtrack a lot or just follow you. Use this to your advantage and gain distance if they mess up.
---

Makes near-gen totem spawn actually even kind of useful. Heh.

I do truly hope you find whatever you are looking for, no one should have to feel like they need to be this unnecessarily hostile and bitter. Good luck in your future endeavors and have a nice 4th of July.
---
115% is 50% faster at closing the distance than 110%. Definetly not meaningless.
---
I prefer the longer setting time for better effects.1 thibg you can try when farming on low on bp is padded jaws so there not injured but use the wax break so you can get to them.i have a twisted basement build for trapper.Stitched bag and honing stone,iron grasp,agitation,deerstalker,and whispers.it destroys high ranks and altruistic.you dont need terroritorial since you have traps.what rank are you if you dont mind me asking?
---
Sorry, to be specific - you do not have to kick a pallet that was dropped, you can just make it fake? 
---
What about real ones that are still up - can you make them fake or do they have to be destroyed first? I'm not sure if you meant spots where pallets would normally spawn but did not.
---
People still take time out to message you directly tho
---
Yea I don‚Äôt want everyone to be on nurse or spirit level but I‚Äôd love it if all the killers were at least on par with huntress.
---
Happy cake day
---
Facts
---
They probably won't, the main use of them seems to be to make people run to empty loops thinking they're safe.
---
Dream state is basically useless now (since it doesn't have his aura-reading and built-in stall anymore), but that's the only time he can use his traps....
---
r/dbdgonegay if anyone interestedüåö
---
Of course I'm serious. The devs have said this themselves and the DBD Steam page even explains this....
---
That's fucking terrifying
---
Get ready for the survivor main downvotes üòÇ I upvote üëçüèª but no to op pls nerf
---
You can place a fake pallet in a place a pallet has not spawned but could have. It was not specified on stream if you could place a fake pallet where you have destroyed a real one. (If it was then I missed it while I was making this meme)
---
The thing about Freddy was that 
---
1. He had nothing to help him with pallets
---
2. His main gimmick held him back in crucial moments
---
3. His main gimmick was WAY too easy to counter
---
Compared to Wraith, who has good map presense and can also get an early hit, with decent trackong, Doctor who had incredible tracking and, with great skill, a way to counter loops, and Leatherface, who can insta-down multiple survivors in one action, Freddy couldn't keep up.
---
I had to fight 2 purples today as a new yellow rank. I got 3k and was my third game on nurse. I gave a bill the hatch. Sometimes I'm okay with the swf if they don't try hard. The only time I'm upset is when it's one good player that complain you tunnel when they spend the game following you. I just used it as a learning experience against someone with better looping skills.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. I don‚Äôt own an android so I can‚Äôt say for certain.
---
I don't recall them mentioning anything about being hooked or him hitting people puts them to sleep. Was that shown in the gameplay and I missed it?
---
Calm the fuck down my dude
---
Gotcha, guess we'll find out soon.
---
I forgot to mention in my post.  But he doesn't see you like he used to when you're asleep unless you're in his radius.  I believe they specifically stated that your aura is visible in his terror radius and that people didn't know that because being asleep let him see you anyway.  so i'll add that.
---
WHEN YOUR HOOKED IN THE GODDAMN BASEMENT AND I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU TBAGGING FUCKING LET YOURSELF DIE SO I CAN TAKE THE DAMN HATCH. NOT ALL OF US HAVE TO DIE YA KNOW?
---
It looked like that, but they didn't say it. Also the timer stayed on in the gui, so maybe they just go to sleep temporarily if he hits them. It also might be something like hitting a survivor after teleporting sleeps them, or it could have been an addon.
---
Nice. He said he wont and i said i wont. We are both watching fireworks atm
---
The community is assimilated. We speak together, collectively, on all things.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We are One. 
---
We are a single Entity. 
---
We are Legion.
---
Just based off of the info from the stream I'm going to guess that Freddy is going to be a lot better than he is now but he still wont be able to compete Nurse, Spirit, and Billy. He might be one of those killers that relies on add-ons to really make them strong (Like the clown and bleach flask) but I think he is going to see a lot more play, even after the release hype, and generally be more fun to play as and against.
---
How ever all of these opinions could change after he hits the PTB. You can never really know until you play them.
---
It was my first game as clown, i got looped and pallet stunned for days and they body blocked the crap out of me at the end saving their teammate
---
Just leave and start a new one?
---
Legion just isn't worth the work it takes to get sacrifices with them at this point. Sad to say, because I loved their aesthetic.
---
We want him to stop screaming in our face.
---
IT HAS BEGUN
---
Only to none completed gens they also cannot be blocked by the entity
---
Meaning you'll be a M1 Killer for about realistically about 30-40 seconds until you hit them and you'll be forced to commit to a chase for your Clown trap bottles to work or otherwise they wake up.
---
Rn? 11. I can never get past 8 though
---
I'm curious just how the heck do you play when you're on your phone.
---
So you just want everyone to be Billy or Nurse right?
---
If you're playing pc then i would understand. I dont play on pc but everyone apparently hates Nurse on pc so they're mindset is to just give up
---
Dope.I dont go for rank 1 I usually stay around 10 so I can get lobbies.are you a well experienced trapper cause in the vid you looked confused at some points.
---
Yeah I have had soo many people message me after I 4k‚Äôd their swf group and they are usually real salty
---
I wouldn't kick Mathieu out of bed for eating crackers.
---
The element of surprise is typically gone on the first minute of a match
---
So it's reversed now? That's kinda odd.
---
They're definitely not placeholder changes.
---
You forget the capability of this game's devs.
---
Self Care just takes too long, your bettervof using that time to do a gen then find someone to heal you.
---
Let me know how this ends haha
---
They might not show up to Freddy like a Jigsaw box.
---
Baseline Nurse from what I've heard is pretty good with that if you're using LoS breaks.
---
It's the add-ons that can break things
---
....dude it's a leak, not an announcement, use your brain
---
Also Freddy can hit suviviors to sleep them, gets suggkty worse stealth but still has it, and the lullaby makes it harder to track Freddy
---
Hey at least you didn‚Äôt run through 50+ bloodwebs looking for nurses calling before realizing you never bought the teachable üôÉ
---
this surprisingly doesn't look not bad definitely gonna be playing it on my phone when I'm ditching a class
---
Just wait for dedicated servers
---
The traps seem meh, seeing as they are only useful in dream state, along with them being way too visible, survivors beyond 5 hours will recognize them, and just completely avoid them, but I guess they could be helpful with stopping some longer loops plus Shack.
---
I feel like he needs more features to help him locate survivors, with how long of a warning you get on his teleport and Sprint Burst being so popular, most people would just dip as soon as they see the blood.
---
If i'm understanding their wording properly it seems so.
---
Bro, I mained Wraith before I quit. His map pressure isn't any good unless you use the Windstorm add ons, and you can't ever get an easy early hit on anyone. Wraith's stealth is completely nonexistent, the shimmering is super easy to see and he fucking snarls all the time while cloaked. Lots of Killers can't do anything about pallets. Freddy was one of the few Killers in the game with on-demand stall, and considering the genrush meta, that stall was really invaluable. They nerfed Freddy.
---
Yeah but have you seen this game's devs?
---
Freddy gets a faster Teleport replaces his terror radius with the lullaby which is non directional now, and his traps work.
---
WAIT SO WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE DAYS UNTIL BABY CLAUDETTE??
---
O0f, you hate to see it dawg... really unfortunate.
---
Clown only has one trick to him, though. He doesn‚Äôt have any map pressure like the new Freddy does.
---
A M1 killer with a slow and map pressure. Don't think I understand the problem
---
People responding: "But what if you only want 1"
---
Common sense: a bundle would be just that, a bundle of cosmetics for a cheaper price than buying it all individually.
---
IIRC his power is a 45 second cooldown for teleport.  with 15 seconds shaved off for every person asleep.
---
Did they mention his perks at all? In the video they were running around with them,  but couldn‚Äôt tell if they were changed at all.
---
It was mentioned on the fourms. There was a point in the video where Freddy hit someone and they become alseep.
---
It's cool that they want to make money and all.....but the people who actually play the game, and love the characters would really like to be able to buy a cool skin with just shards rather than spend money on it all the time.....
---
A 45 second cool down that can go to about 15. That's the incentive to wake up.
---
&gt;Double pip
---
So?
---
oh rad.
---
Not in the stream
---
I'm just gonna say this, despite it probably being an unpopular opinion here.
---
When I bought this game ~3 years ago, I sucked as bad as you did. Tru3 showed me I was playing wrong and how to fix it. Hit red ranks mostly because of his advice. I say mostly because he only initiated the change. The rest was up to practice.
---
Survivors will vault the door how?
---
Yes reading over some other posts others are mentioning this.  So I will add it to my post.  I figured I missed it because of gameplay.  Thanks for pointing it out.
---
Don't be frustrated, you need hundreds of hours to be good at this game. Looping a killer is not something that you can do as a new player since it requires knowledge about maps (location of pallets, types of tiles, safe and unsafe loops), killers and how their powers work, as well as knowledge about the mechanics of the game. 
---
Watch streamers and observe how they run certain tiles (T L walls, jungle gyms, killer shack ... etc). In addition, observe how they position their camera while being chased. As a survivor you are supposed to REACT to the killer movement/actions, and not PREDICT. Pay attention to the decisions they make in different situations.
---
At the beginning of the match, pay attention to your surroundings and see the location of the pallets/tiles that are nearby (this is something you need to do as a new player but once you become experienced, the location or the pallets/tiles would be like common sense). When working on a generator, plan your escape route.
---
When you lose, analyze what you did wrong and find out what you could have done differently in order to improve. 
---
Good luck in the fog.
---
Maybe they could like.. Make it just have a 5% instead
---
remember having to stop before unhooking to position yourself on a 45 degree angle from the hooked person to get the ‚ÄòDisarm Trap‚Äô prompt?
---
remember trappers putting invisible traps underneath the ground that still trap you?
---
remember putting 3+ traps on one hook?
---
remember how slow killer vaulting was?
---
remember barely being able to lunge?
---
remember infinites?
---
remember farming points as wraith by constantly cloaking and uncloaking?
---
remember window vacuums as well as pallet vacuums?
---
remember no fall stun?
---
remember 20 second cooldown sprint burst?
---
remember sprint burst and adrenaline not sharing a cooldown via exhaustion, allowing a sprint to be held for 11 seconds under perfect conditions?
---
remember sabo Jake squads?
---
watching this game grow up through its many highs and many lows has been very fun.
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha
---
Aaaaahahahahahahahahahanahhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
It was very brief. I suggest going to the fourms and looking at Peanits comments. He gives alot of insight
---
The wardrobes seem to give a very small amount of time awake. Doesn't seem like it's worth going across the map to wake up just to go almost right back to sleep.
---
Are you... for real? I didn't ask for her origin story, I know it. My comment was kind of sarcasm to this model, because she looks like she came right from the depth of the ocean. I am surprised people took my comment so seriously.
---
"detailed cosmetics"
---
In dead by daylight graphics? Lol
---
I love the game but lets not kid ourselves. 
---
I've spent money on cosmetics too don't get me wrong, but only because i genuinely love the game. However each new awesome skin that comes out that i can't buy with shards is slowly grinding on me.
---
Well said.
---
I will go do that while i'm still able to be at my pc.  thanks.
---
We had Server in the PTB with EGC. We don‚Äôt have dedicated servers yet, and they would help devs identify if the DC was due to a connection error or the player quitting. We don‚Äôt have punishments for DC‚Äôs yet because a lot of people lose connection to the host.
---
It's really only if you want to support the game. I see no problem with the price tag for something that doesnt effect gameplay at all. Plus not all cosmetics cost that much.
---
Make one that says share prices should be more affordable.
---
Sometimes a lobby can‚Äôt get four people and is stuck at 3. Also it‚Äôs the 4th
---
holy Shit this looks Bad.
---
DCs are gonna be 300% more frequent then on PC, with how easy it is to lock your phone/Kill an App.
---
And those FPS, does the game even reach 30 at its peak?
---
They dont. You cant see through the door so they gain a mind game but lose the loop
---
Makes sense thanks
---
üòî
---
I didn‚Äôt even want him nerfed I wanted him reworked coz he was unfun. And he‚Äôs never been powerful, not when he came out and not after the changes. Sitting there mending constantly is unfun even if you get an easy win coz it takes like 20 minutes and no one even got hooked twice.
---
I just got back. Im gonna go check. I know after a certain amount of time the game ends
---
I HATE HOW I KEEP GETTING TUNNELED OVER AND OVER AND OVER ITS HAPPENED IN 3 FUCKING GAMES IN 1 DAY STOP BEING ASS HOLES BY TUNNELING IT‚ÄôS ANNOYING.
---
The Power won't work unless you commit to a chase. In comparison to his current power - you no longer can't pressure other generators and survivors by putting them to sleep. He'll get gen rushed way more easily just like most other M1 Killers do now.
---
Did you change the standard spacebar struggle with another control? I find that the scroll down control makes struggling infinitely easier.
---
Nice!  Thanks for clearing that up.  I'm glad i dont need to worry about that.
---
And double thanks considering you actually provided a helpful reply despite my comment being negative karma'ed into oblivion.
---
The game is well balanced m8
---
Everyone does their own. I prefer to get it to 99% and heal because when you pop the gen it‚Äôs like a giant target.
---
It was my understanding was that Freddy wasn't bad because he couldn't get work done.  But that he was bad because a) other killers were far better at some aspects freddy did and b) freddy's interaction with the game was unfun for most.  Both killer and survivor players alike.
---
To me the rework seeked to make him more like his iconic self and abolish some of the terrible interactions that were caused by his existence.  The rework might have been stated to make him "viable" but you could write that off as a tug to pull those who had a bad view on him back towards him.
---
They should give us a free outfit for buying killers or survivors early
---
Kinda shitty debuff, to be honest, even so I am kinda hyped for his rework.
---
Not in japan, foot binding is a chinese thing
---
that endgame chat would either be straight respect or straight salt, there's no in-between
---
You don't want to. It wastes their time. And you can so it in the same way you can now
---
Sleep isn't supposed to be a debuff. It's more akin to a pig trap that's meant to buff Freddy and waste time rather then hinder.
---
1-Go on google
---
2-Type Freddy Darn
---
3-Enjoy
---
Should also note that hitting a survivor sleeps them instantly and Freddy can see people's Auras when they're asleep if they're in his radius.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs basically right
---

---
and people like u are talking as if they played the reworked version
---
It‚Äôs Pyro alright: mans grew a beard so he‚Äôs...Pewdiecynical
---
Generally depends on what is happening in the game, I generally prioritize the Gen, especially if the killer is good
---
Running Pig and seeing survivor after survivor pull the trap off in the first box or two.
---
WHY THE FUCK DID I GETSHOCKED TWICE BY DOCTOR AND LITERALLY COULDNT INTERACT WITH THE GAME AT ALL I COULDNT SNAP OT OF IT I COULDNT DO GENS I DIDNT EVEN HAVE A WIGGLE OR OR HEAL BAR WHEN I GOT UNHOOKED THIS GAME IS A MESS
---
Thank you
---
Nurse wrecks all 8, drops mic and leaves
---
You all should have not bought outfits for 12 fucking dollars.
---
Why was he taunting that close to the wall?!?!??!?
---
*shitpost*. Although the scream franchise is great, it‚Äôs not common to see a killer with a sense of humor that prefers the game more than killing
---
So are you just some guy who watches the game a lot but has never played it?  Souls fan from your name too, though right?
---
No - the Freddy Rework won't be out until the end of the month most likely. There's a Public Test Build going live on Tuesday July 9th for PC .
---
This as well. He was already extremely poor at late game before, unless every survivor was asleep (which rarely happened unless the Freddy got very lucky or the survivors were very stupid). Now all of his perks don't match up with his theme/powers even more now. He still has absolutely nothing for beginning or late game besides his powers, perk-wise.
---
What? I never mentioned the reworked version. I'm not even against the changes, I'm just explaining why some people, like me, enjoyed playing with the old design and you are the one saying that the only thing his ability gives you is a downgrade, even when you clearly have no idea what made him enjoyable to play or strong when in the right hands.
---
except Freddy is already the worst killer in the game and this rework was made with the intention of buffing him and making him more fun to play as and against. As a killer he now has more tools to play with instead of just sleep spamming people and now survivors don't necessarily have to wake up if they are playing against a bad Freddy, but more often than not it will be beneficial to just go ahead and wake up anyway. On top of that Freddy doesn't have to wait ten years for someone to fall asleep before he can hit them. It's hard to say since PTB isn't put but it looks like this rework will be better for everyone.
---
He used to be so cute but that beard is different
---
I enjoyed this, thank you for sharing.
---
Noice ok thanks for letting me know
---
Wait so the dream world isn't that important anymore? How does the dream world work now lol
---
Hope that first set is the normal-looking shirt, that's what I'm personally really interested in.
---
Nerf hatch, survs 2 op
---
I ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE NURSE ADDON THAT TAKES A WAY A BLINK. THE MAP WAS THE BIG SQUARE CORNFIELD AND I HAD TO MAKE DO WITH ONE BLINK ON PS4! IT WAS A BAD TIME.
---
It‚Äôs seems okay, I don‚Äôt get why he can‚Äôt have both pallet and snare traps though.  He really wouldn‚Äôt be overpowered it‚Äôs just make people really want to get out of dream world and make an effort.
---
ok sorry
---
The rework is definitely an improvement.  He can hit people whenever he wants!
---
I like how they are all the best parts of them too. And doesn't the traps just make you fall asleep faster?  Goin to watch the video after what you described.
---
What's the minimum version of iOS you need to be on to play?
---
Good question.
---
*laughs in ultra instinct*
---
Ill say thanks to the devs when every perk in the game is viable, not meta but viable, when there are dedicated servers, and everything is purchasable with IS, which is never gonna happen, coz they are greedy fuckers that dont play their own game and dont give a shit about their players and community at all
---
iOS 10 and iPhone 5s or newer.
---
In case you still haven't realized, I'm arguing from the perspective of the hooked survivor. Who literally cannot do a single thing. That has been my point from the very beginning when I commented on how it's not easy to counter being camped when you're stuck on a hook with one button to press.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
I've grown to like how he is too, not to mention I came up with a whole build for him that I like. The devs should have just implemented the ideas they had for him last year, instead of a full-on overhaul. It would have been so much simpler to do that and probably would have been a hell of a lot faster. Not to mention that it isn't Freddy's problem (nor should he be changed because) some survivors didn't read up on killers and didn't know he could see their auras when they were asleep.
---
I'll miss playing 5D chess with myself and ping-ponging between asleep survivors according to who I saw as the biggest problem at any point in time.
---
Honestly I see it more as a BBQ + PGTW kind of thing, most of the time. Use BBQ to see what gens are being hammered out, knock it down, then chase. Seems like it'd be good.
---
The fake pallets are an add on that replaces dream snares, they are not part of his base kit.
---
Do you want upvotes or what? I didn't see too many people saying what you said (???) And devs don't give a fuck about what this type of "never satisfied" people say. The only opinion that matters are the actual players opinion. Don't be hurt for them lol
---
I still suck (still new) but have improved a lot over the past week when it comes to chases. One turning point is when I stopped having such a panic each time I got caught. 
---
Just remember you can't outrun a killer under any circumstances, so you really have to mix it up. With some luck and a lot of practice you'll eventually get into chases where the killer realizes they're spending too much time on you and will break the chase, other times you will escape.
---
One thing is to watch videos from killers to see how a chase looks to them. Remember it doesn't always take a "hero move" to escape a killer, sometimes breaking line of sight for a second, stop running, and double back in a crouch will be enough to throw a killer off. This is especially important if you do manage to stun the killer or pull off a critical vault, because continuing to run will leave clear scratch marks.
---
Survivors auras are revealed when they activate dream snares or fake pallets
---
Some survivors just don't believe us killer mains have a heart
---
Pig is still in the game.
---
The killer is the host so ur internet matters there's time as a survivor where u forget to look at ping as I do other things as waiting times r boring or the ping would semi decent n then go bad once the timer locks leaving
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
used to be a thing, they patched it, and now its back
---
I'll try to give some reasons, instead of just going "he bad". His biggest strengths are countering stealth and making skill checks more difficult, even the standard survivor will soon find out how ineffective stealth is and how to hit skillchecks negating a huge advantage of the doctor's power.
---
Having mained him myself from rank 20-4 in my first month of playing you can literally feel the exponential decline in his power effectiveness as you face more and more experienced survivors.
---
That's not to say he doesn't have potential, but he can be tweaked a bit. I would argue reworking his add-ons can go a long way, as of now he realistically only has like 5 add-ons and 4 different tiers of those same add-ons. Changing them up to directly affect how he plays can go a long way. Make the moldy electrode base so he can actually zap loops efficiently, rework that stupid add-on that makes his zap in the shape of a donut and hit everything but the survivor in front of him. Give him ways to stay in treatment mode at 115 speed, maybe have alternative ways to spread madness an idea I have is everytime you hook someone a shockwave is sent out and makes everyone gain a chunk of madness and scream, give him a form of unnerving presence in his add-ons to help aide in making skill checks harder.
---
Basically giving him more utility and ways to spread madness and keep his skill checks at least somewhat difficult without wasting so much time and being endlessly looped while you try to get/keep people in tier 3 can go a long way.
---
I'd much rather have it be this way than have the prices of cosmetics and chapters be swapped. I'm not happy with how much skins costs, but I'm very happy that I don't have to pay 1080 Auric cells (or the equivalent) to get GF or any killer
---
So they get off the Gen and he can cancel it when he wants to.
---
It also only takes 3 seconds to cast
---
Thank you for this, I feel so vindicated. I hate Freddy so much, I don't mind saying he is underpowered but he was still the most gut-wrenching despair-inducing thing to be play against.  I'd rather play a nurse that could see every survivors aura and had infinite moris because at least I can just die and move on to the next game.
---
Freddy is broken, broken doesn't mean they're overpowered but broken in the sense that he ruins every single mechanic this game is built on.  He invalidates many perks like Kindred, forcing players to gravitate towards meta, toxic perks even more. He forces survivors to FAIL at their interactions to combat him. With Hex Ruin and the Doctor the player is forced to get good at skill checks, Freddy FORCES survivors to FAIL at their one job to avoid his power. This on its own is broken.
---
Freddy doesn't allow stealthy gameplay, this forces survivors to gravitate towards using perks that assist them in looping, it's realistically impossible to use other perks against a Freddy that isn't stupid. This, like immunity to random perks, ENCOURAGES the toxic gameplay that survivors have and doesn't let him benefit from it.
---
Freddy's ability to hold the game hostage is just sadistic, unlike the doctor survivors are forced to lose generator progression by failing skill checks to return to normal speed.  By design Freddy is made to make the game miserable for everyone.
---
There are so many more things wrong with Freddy, like how he turns skill checks into RNG in the wise ways possible.  I feel that he remains the wosrt-designed killer in the entire game and I really hope the remake makes him respectable and engaging to play against.  I'd rather play against an overpowered killer than one that makes me want to just walk up to him and let him kill me to let me move on to another match that I'll actually enjoy.
---
I think the reason people defend Freddy so fiercely is that he gives killers the option to ruin everyone else's time. Some survivors ruined their time and Freddy empowers them to do the same, so rather than rework him to be fun, they want him flat out buffed to win on top of ruining the game for everyone involved.  I'm really anxious to see his rework, Freddy is gonna make or break the game for me.
---
Plague. Fucc meta, just have fun.
---
You still wouldn't be able to do anything even if he wasn't camping....until you got unhooked... It's a team game. You have to work as a team or you all lose.
---
12,000 safer than god pallet, pallets? 2 double pallets? Almost haddonfield level BL bullshit?
---
alright... survivor sided shit
---
A few mindgameable af pallets? Bad gen positions? Small map?
---
alright... killer sided shit
---
point being, i agree completely.
---
Thanks! Dont forget to wish 'Murica happy cake day too *salutes*
---
Trial and error is the way to go. Getting smacked on the way to getting better is just part of the journey
---
Yeesh. Feelsbadman. Mines in the basement, so I get good peace and quiet 90% of the time.
---
If the killer is in chase it might be better to work on a gen. But also healing could be good. It's situational.
---
Also it's funny to ignore other survivors sometimes.
---
No
---
9 times out of 10 you can get unhooked a lot faster and not spend your entire 2 phases there if they don't see a killer standing 5 feet away
---
They were fine how they did it before, they used to sell a whole pack of cosmetics for like $4 with stuff for a bunch of different characters. Now it‚Äôs 10 dollars for a single outfit
---
*laughs while avoiding trapper's bear traps*
---
Ew, noed. Downvoted.
---
Actually looping doesn't take skill from the developer's perspectives.
---
One of their 2019 road maps is something about pallet distribution; as in the problem isn't "the amount of pallets a survivor can loop around" (**read: the ability to loop isn't a problem**) but that they want to spread existing pallets out more or change their location so that loops can be mindgamed and aren't automatically safe for a few rotations around them (**ie: loops shouldn't work if you just mindlessly W around them with your camera trained on the killer at all**).
---
This presumably also involves some of the biggest no-skill loops in the game (anywhere inside Badham, Haddonfield fence-pallet combinations, certain buildings that are either too large like Ormond or function abusively well with Balanced Landing like some Haddonfield and Autohaven buildings).
---
Killer hosted games. 
---
Shit connections usually fall on your lap
---
Why would Freddy cancel though? He won't know if it's the correct gen until he gets there. And I believe it takes 4 seconds to cast, but even 3 seconds is plenty of time for survivors to run and Freddy can only chase down one of them.
---
wait your mad at them but you de-ranked yourself so you are just as bad or am I not reading this right
---
Playing against bots won't help. The only way to get better is through practice in REAL situations. Who cares if you lose a couple games? If you improved, you didn't really lose.
---
Must be a coincidence
---
Exact same thing when playing Ghostface or Myers and you stalk around to see if you spot any outlines, don‚Äôt see anything, exit stalk and suddenly get points for stalking someone and getting progress on Evil Within/Expose
---
I like how he stood there for a second trying to figure out what just happened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucking raining Nea‚Äôs around here‚Äù
---
Ghost Face cleary had spirt fury.
---
They hated them both, because they told the truth
---
Well the flair says shitpost so I can't tell if they're serious or just a memelord
---
I can't watch this rn. Could someone please sum up the rework please?
---
In a game that we've all already paid for, that's also full to the brim of a million and one DLC you almost *need* in order to keep up. They're selling cosmetics that cost the same as fucking FTP games cosmetics. How does that seem okay to you?
---
when it comes to this sub it is hard to tell
---
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this
---
That‚Äôs when you kill them with kindness. Was playing Ghost Face with NOED and I got 2 DCs and they all sent hate mail and I just responded ‚ÄúGG WP guys. Y‚Äôall are fun to play with!‚Äù
---
Never responded back.
---
That's called madness tier 3. You'll scream at random intervals and reveal urself every time you do
---
If they werent greedy bastards they would make every cosmetic, and even licensed killers purchasable with IShards.
---
I mean, we're assuming it's good, getting less powerful as the game progresses though doesn't sound the best though (can't teleport to finished gens).
---
To mind game, plenty of reasons. Your underestimating how fast it is.
---
Playing against a Freddy is so annoying. I just let him kill me for bloodpoints
---
Horvath has no business looking that good
---
You do realize that A: People at Rank 20 can be P3 Lvl 50 with all perks thats not unusual and B: you complain about "Smurfs" while purposefully De-Ranking. Hypocrisy much?
---
Good to see there‚Äôs some light in the game. I get a lot of toxic tbaggers sadly. Why can‚Äôt we all just play and enjoy without being toxic?
---
If the rest of the survivors are clearly not doing gens while I'm getting facecamped I'll generally only struggle the full time if there's been a BPS or I used a cake, since at least it's double the struggle points
---
Guess that's a yes then
---
Become as gods
---
I cleaned out the fans on my PS4 today and it doesn‚Äôt seem so loud anymore. In fact it‚Äôs almost quiet as a mouse.
---
That‚Äôs what I remember too. The two on camera said it doesn‚Äôt but then one of the other developers was I guess in chat and confirmed that as of now small game does detect fake pallets.
---
The whole point is that the cosmetics being priced so high allows the actual gameplay additions to cost less for everybody.
---
Cabin from Evil Dead
---
I know that I'm not supposed to win all of them, but I'm just really discouraged because I can usually get a 3k consistently.
---
To everyone saying those killers are fine: all killers weaker than hillbilly need buffs to his level to be balanced.
---
Well that's the thing the killer won't be camping if your team was doing what they were supposed to.
---
Yes! I wanted to cover only the basics. Pallets are a add-on.
---
Just to get familiar with aiming and how the power works isn't too much to ask for.
---
Because they‚Äôre a company and the entire point of a company is to make money. You don‚Äôt set up a lemonade stand as a kid because you like making lemonade. You set it up to make money. It‚Äôs perfectly normal for companies to want to make money and I don‚Äôt get why people like you can‚Äôt see it.
---
nUrSE hAss nO CuNtrPlY
---
My point never had to do with my teammates. Just that it's not very fun for the person sitting on the hook
---
all 4 survivors arent supposed to always escape. deal with it. use the other survivors as tools, let them heal you(bond), use them to prolong the game(hook rescues), lead the killer towards them (pebble), make sure your not found (use lockers to counter BBQ), then leave them behind and escape knowing that they have no idea you planned their death all along
---
Ik this isn‚Äôt the full rework and that it isn‚Äôt even out yet but as of right now, where do you guys think Freddy is on the tier list?
---
Back then, games were also developed and shipped and that was it. Modern games get actively supported and worked on for several years following release. There's a big difference and paying for something that's purely cosmetic is fine.
---
Underground mines. Maybe a section or two of the Macmillan Estate Mines that were caved in from when The Trapper got everyone killed. 
---
Hi-Tech research center. 
---
Resident Evil style mansion?
---
Shopping Mall. 
---
Space Station.
---
We already have a sort of church, Campbell's Chapel although the actual church is tiny.
---
Only if you have Botany tier 3. That med-kit would heal twice with Botany.
---
A library. Preferably with a librarian killer to accompany it.
---
If you're not in a chase when someone gets unhooked, and the person who unhooked them doesn't bodyblock for the injured survivor, then the killer going after the injured survivor isn't tunneling.
---
Even with Borrowed Time it's still two hits either way, and if you're not actually camping the hook then BT probably didn't even proc.
---
Besides two people aren't on generators either way.
---
A mall, airport, in a giant cargo boat, on a mountain, a cave system, trailer park, Blitz n' Chitz, movie theater, mail-sorting facility or jungle.
---
I doubt it imo.
---
Good teammate, he warned her.
---
A ship would be awesome they are some of the best horror locations in horror games
---
I gotta see him in action before i decide a build. Your build looks great, but Im always skeptical on the way bhvr explains things.
---
Those aren't the only viable killers. People can do just fine with other killers.
---
BRIGHT! WTF DID YOU DO!?
---
I mean, realistically you don't need to teleport to finished gens unless it was just finished or the exit gate is next to it.  Can you still TP if the exitgates are powered and the gen was left over? ~~Id assume not but could be cool~~
---
Okay let me get this straight for you. Freddy was ABSOLUTELY NOT overpowered in anyway before his need. In fact he was already low tier when he released.
---

Bikini Pig&gt;Ballerina Pig
---
The one fact that people have to look at is that Freddy wasn't just nerfed because he was "too strong." By that logic Nurse and Huntress would've been nerfed way faster. The reason Freddy was nerfed so fast is because he is generally so unfun to play against it instantly makes every loss against him feel so much worse. The reason people demanded Freddy nerfs when he first came out was not because he was OP, but because he was so unfun to play against. All he does is bog down the game and he feels essentially unescapable.
---
I actually had two Freddy dailies to do today and the entire match I felt like a cunt. I was playing against a really toxic SWF that helped me feel less bad personally but the entire match I felt like I was just being a twat, sleeping Survivors the moment they're unhooked and leaving them in a chase to kick a gen or sleep another Survivor just to come back 30 seconds later since I can see their aura. In particular there was a point where I'd just go to a gen this one Survivor was on to sleep them and then go to the other sleeping Survivor to chase them through a cancer loop (Ironworks of Tomfuckery yay) so the one Survivor had to waste time blowing up gens while the other one had no chance to wake up.
---
Freddy is honestly so ass-backwards. Everything about his design goes against everything this game is designed around. Escaping him in a chase means he'll just find you again. Failing skill checks is the best course of action against him. The only way to play against him is to play toxic. I don't know how the original Freddy even got past preproduction and I'm so happy he's finally being reworked after over a year of being the worst thing this game had to offer.
---
Again Freddy wasn't OP: he was just the most godawful character to play against.
---
here‚Äôs the livestream from the devs, might wanna skip around for their discussion about it (13:00ish to 33:00ish, sorry if times are off)
---
Doors would actually make a great double-edged sword. Killers can knock Survivors on their asses, Survivors can stun killers, maybe a lock item forces Killers to kick them down...
---
uve been matched with potatoes, nothing to be proud of
---
Tell 'em Freddy sent ya.
---
Yes it does. The terror radius has accompanying music that changes in intensity the closer your proximity to the killer, which makes changes in distance and direction very apparent and easy to read.
---
The lullaby only gets very slightly louder, making it very difficult to read, and by the time you hear a heartbeat it is far too late to get into any favorable position.
---
I would agree with you in a vacuum, but most of the generators in the game exist with a lot of LoS breakers around them due to the RNG-heavy nature of the game. I spent about 6 hours playing today (yay holidays) with a pretty experienced SWF group, and everyone was getting snuck up on constantly becuase there's just no way to tell where she's coming from.
---
She's gone from ranged killer who you want to avoid being in a chase with, to a ranged killer that can function as gen-grab myers as far as gaining reliable proximity to survivors before they can react.
---
If the total chance to Kobe (without Deliverance) never exceeded 4% over all three attempts regardless of perks like Slippery Meat or offerings (which I think would be like 1.3% per attempt?) then I would probably respect non-Deliverance Kobes.
---
You fucking
---
L E G E N D
---
Who is the streamer?
---
Only change I wanted was make survivors unable to do things with progress bar during dream transition
---
To be honest it's not really that small, it's probably his best addon effect because you can train survivors into thinking real pallets are fake so they won't use them.
---
Really makes the name Order work.
---
Advanced camping techniques.
---
I still don't get why Pig's stun sounds appealing, it's uh...
---
Gross, Wraith-tier horrible.
---
Tree face
---
Care to explain?
---
K.. I‚Äôd like to join. For science
---
Once I had a Billy game where someone was basically stationary with lag.  
---
I felt bad, but I needed to land 3 chainsaws for my daily...
---
As a new player I find all this talk of camping to be the most bizarre thing.  In a universe where people are summoned to be slaughtered over and over again by merciless killers, the biggest concern is killers actually killing people.  Regardless of the methods used, I would expect nothing short of merciless attitudes from someone wielding a chainsaw and a fucking cattle hammer.  The same applies to survivors.  If getting the fuck out of there as fast as possible gives you satisfaction, and isn't breaking any rules, then who's to determine that valid/invalid?
---
I don‚Äôt look forward to that map as killer or survivor.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen in the live stream, I‚Äôd say this is it. If you‚Äôre using the fake pallets add-ons, you could also do the enduring+spirit fury trick.
---
Gas House from Saw 2 as a map for The Game
---
Only because they're on a deal. It'll be the normal price(500) soon.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/dumplings](https://www.twitch.tv/dumplings)   
---
She's mainly a League of Legends streamer but recently got into DBD and is so addicted, seeing her learn this game is so funny
---
The fake pallets thing is gonna be an ultra rare addon. Im a little nervous on dream snares.
---
Moments like that really are what make DBD so much fun.
---
I just watched a video of his rework and it looks like they fixed everything wrong with him, I think he could actually be buffed so survivors can't see themselves falling asleep the first time so he's not immediately revealed but this honestly made my day.
---
True, but Quintin?
---
I'm not sure if it's creepy because Quintin is underage (I think?) or because Quintin's appearance in DbD is the stuff of nightmares.
---
Just ship David with Myers, duh.
---
Well, I don't see the point of having a sleep status if Freddy can attack everyone. If he IS OP at release like some people are crying, I really hope they go for the lore-conformity and just make sleep easy to get players into, but mandatory for actually attacking them.
---
I hope that survivors won‚Äôt be able to destroy snares, that would pretty much negate one of his powers. I think it would made sense if they couldn‚Äôt since it‚Äôs literally a puddle of blood.
---
I think people will just run Calm spirit a lot now.
---
They can sell all the outfits they want; I just want some gameplay.
---
how about a map where a relativly large lake is in the middle where survivors and killer can look at each other from both sides
---
Ooooohhhhh trust me, I feel the same. I run BL as survivor and as killer I play Billy.
---
&gt;Hope that first set is the normal-looking shirt, that's what I'm personally really interested in.
---
First set is Leather Pig and Undercover Tapp.
---
I'm just going by the wiki which states that it's a 4% per attempt, which would give the total chance that I posted above.
---
Oof. That‚Äôs just sad as hell and frustrating
---
If detection perks were used more, I might agree, but I'm not sure if killing a perk is fun. Even Michael has to come out of EW1 sometime.
---
Thanks man. I was wondering what it would be like
---
Woodsboro. With Sid as a survivor. But alas.
---
As a F2P player, that's fair. Get yourself a nice smock; I'll just buy the Peasant's Doctor with shards.  
---
~~And then quit playing before I drop dosh on franchise killers.~~
---
Probably not high, but better than before
---
So...
---
Above or together with huntress
---
Just need to see how his traps will really work in a chase and how effective to give a definitive answer (amd his add ons too)
---
Im not too much confident in the dream pallets since a good survivor can just remember that pallet was used before, and you relly on (i think i hear that wrong, correct me if im mistaken) a combo of addons to have them and give up of the dream traps
---
I agree with POP, but i'd prefer overcharge, huntress lullaby and thanotaphobia. But that's my preffered build with him.
---
The thing I hate about the bamboo is that some of them you can walkthrough and some you can‚Äôt so sometimes as I‚Äôm hiding in bamboo I‚Äôll end up bumping into the ones that are solid when I‚Äôm trying to run away and it screws me over lol
---
So you never ever run perks or items that give you a health state?
---
Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Instant-Heal, Flashlights (since saving someone gives them a health state)? You don't ever use a pallet to get someone off the Killer's shoulder (which also gives a survivor a health state)?
---
After all if you get taken down twice by NOED (specifically from healthy, not being injured already) then you're bad, all NOED does on average (if it even activates) is take an extra health from a survivor or two (most leave once they find you have NOED unless you have Blood Warden, which is two perks and should have powerful synergy given that two killer perks = eight survivor perks) once.
---
If you don't ever run (perks) or use (items, pallets) anything that allows you to bring a survivor (including yourself) from one state to another (dying to injured, dying to healthy, injured to healthy) or keep them at a health state when they shouldn't be at it (Borrowed Time for survivors, Mettle of Man or Dead Hard for yourself) then complaining about NOED is ridiculous.
---
Because most people dont like change
---
Just do gens and reveal-&gt;bodyblock on hook saves to waste his time + enable dead hard.
---
Bunny Feng would like a word with you.
---
Good drawing
---
Not reading all that but I could tell you right now you're not using parantheses correctly. It appears you're using way too many of them. :---)
---
Overcharge? Won‚Äôt that wake them up?
---
*BECOME AS GODS! BECOME AS GODS!*
---
This was the last place I expected to find a Nier Automata reference, whew!
---
funny you say that, since the joy I find in this game as killer is beating people who use "gen times and looping". I can pm you some videos about countering such things if you dont know what to do
---
It does, but they lose 5% progress on gens including an extra 6% for a total of 11% with lullaby.
---
Then they need to add something else, because looping being the basic gameplay is really depressing.
---
I doubt many people main both the killer and the survivor from the same chapter so this is fairly unlikely.
---
bloodlust is an actual game mechanic so it was just kinda confusing
---
I honestly don't think they have any idea what they're talking about lmao. Overcharge on Freddy is AWFUL, it just wakes them up for free. Pop + BBQ will definitely be meta on Freddy post-rework.
---
I was wondering where the old forum went.
---
Amazing game &lt;3
---
ah
---
License holders might not agree so they're probably stuck on that as the contract would include a provision for every sale = payment.
---
This is a prime example of people forgetting about BBQ &amp; Chili
---
So what exactly is your plan when the killer finds you? Just run in a straight line?
---
Is it out only in the US store?
---
Your name reminds me of mine
---
The little Hag is fucking killing me
---
Oh no.
---
Call me petty, but I REALLY don't like the subtle implications that this is Reboot Pedophile Freddy instead of classic Sassy Bastard Freddy.
---
Gameplay seems interesting enough, that just bothers me. Can we call up Robert Englund to get some voicelines in there?
---
So they made it more expensive - how is this "anti-consumer"? What's the problem? If it's too expensive you can just not buy it and if enough people don't buy the cosmetics the price will gradually drop. As it stands, a lot of people \*do\* seem to buy the cosmetics so the price seems to be fine.
---
You got free ultra rare add ons and offerings for your first killer match? Mobile is nuts.
---
Bad Ham (ham is never bad btw) looked a LOT bigger on the stream.
---
1. He has 0 options to counter looping. Trapper/Hag can trap loops, Pig can dash if used correctly, Nurse goes through, Myers and Ghostface end chases before a loop begins, Leatherface and Hillbilly can insta-break pallets, Spirit ignores them, Clown removes them. Right now, only Wraith and Freddy have no options to help with looping.
---
2. His invisibility can be seen easily. You really have to hide yourself if you want to sneak up on good survivors.
---
3. His uncloaking takes too long to be used well. If you uncloak near someone and they get to a window or pallet, your one advantage of getting an early hit is gone. You can't always block a window, and sometime's there are multiple escape routes, rendering a window block useless. 
---
4. He gets stunned extra if he's invisible, and can be blinded anywhere on his body while invisible.
---
He has nothing else. His only advantage is no terror radius and sometimes getting an early hit. He's a default M1 killer otherwise. Nothing special in a chase. If his cloaking and uncloaking where naturally faster, he could do some mindgames, adding more depth to his playstyle. But he is not ok as he is right now.
---
I'm pretty sure this is created to keep the discussion going?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a grocery store map since the ghost face trailer had him in there
---
Or just killing toxic Survivors.
---
Ok cool
---
He‚Äôs talented
---
I make the product that the artist chooses
---
Given the way BHVR's spaghetti code works I fully expect that the Freddy rework will somehow cause Leatherface's chainsaw to hit and down himself.
---
On the Cooldown addons: Cold Dirt I like playing in combination with Irridescent button. They don't make that big a difference but it is noticable and quite helpful.
---
Status Effect: The only one i consider "useful" is the Legion Pin. Although only if the Survivors have Instaheals. Granted if you manage to down them in 60 seconds after giving them another speedboost. (Legit this is what i'd like to see changed. Have the first frenzy Stab give the boost but not the second in frenzy)
---
Killer Instinct Buffs: This must be me not being used to those but they kinda fuck my perception of distance over. Like i see the Pulse thinking yeah i can hit that but nope, it was on the entire opposite side of the map.
---
Duration Buffs: Definitely the better ones of Legions addons. Together with the Rulers give you a nice way to cover the Map.
---
Yes they might help with my perception issue mentioned above but i need some more trial and error with this.
---
Rulers: Like i said, together with Duration Buffs gives you nice Map coverage
---
Mend Time debuffs: Literally does not matter.
---
Stab Wound Study: I have no clue how many Bloodwebs I went through on my Legion but so far I have gotten 9 of these. Tried it once but honestly does not matter. Same as with the Mend Time debuffs, as soon as you are going for multiple targets in a row hit survivors just stop and mend and since the timer does not matter once they start mending. Since the timer won't tick down while in a chase there is literally no use for these two types of addons.
---
Frank's: Literally what you said.
---
Irridescent Button: Now here is the fun stuff (unless on Lery's). The Terror Radius part  I truly don't know how it is as a Survivors since I somehow am yet to play against this but the Pallet breaking alone is worth it. Combined with Spirit Fury Pallets just don't exist. 
---
Fuming Mixtape: Honestly I just forget i put that on and end up not using it.
---
Not quite. What used to happen was killers would camp, they'd Depip if the other 3 survivors did gens and left, now however if you don't get chased and don't unhook you also depip. Not sure wtf BHVR are doing, but they seem to keep narrowing whats considered successful play in terms of PIPPING for a while now. Inb4 all you Red people come along and shout rank doesn't matter. 
---
Try fucking solo Q at R15 and you will be screaming at your monitor at how bad new players are and it WILL suddenly matter for you again.
---
well i think people will probably run calm spirit right when patch lands  it probably won't stay a super popular perk unless freddy doc or clown since it's a dead perk against pretty much everyone else
---
That‚Äôs bloodpoints
---
There's a "Kill Your Friends" mode if you have someone who will run around and let you kill them.
---
Ashs always waste pallets
---
I like running it with iron will, but I prefer a stealth based playstyle.
---
Nah I wouldn't simplify it like that. For one, it makes stealthing against him possible again which is welcome to me. And he doesn't need to see survivors everywhere on the map anymore since he can hit them at any time now, not only when they're asleep.
---
If you don't like the survivor side, ya just don't like it. Nothing really wrong with it.
---
Jeez, he's pissed
---
what i‚Äôm saying is that everyone wanted the legion changes and as soon as they were announced everyone was upset with BHVR. that‚Äôs the comparison
---
Buy exactly enough to get 69 auric cells
---
Legion, hardest to master out of them but the most satifiying to get 4ks with. Relies on good add ons and understanding, but will not disapoint. Rank 6 killer and i average a 4k  3/4 games. #MetaIsGarbo
---
I play the guitar while waiting
---
I think the only way to improve with a killer is if you just play with them normaly.
---
Learn from your mistakes and improve yourself
---
As a friend of my would say "No pain No gain".
---
2min without addons
---
At first I thought that was some sort of spider monster
---
Well I guess I wont be playing freddy anymore..... all the stuff I like it's gone! Seeing the auras across the map, the speed penalty. Traps, teleport, pallets, it's like freddy is going through a crisis and doesn't have a personality anymore. Well, I guess gf is ok or time to find another game :(
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9c42e/are_pallet_placements_bugged_right_now/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yes.
---
Getting that map when playing legion is hecka fun because parkour
---
Cool they are pretty good about giving you what you estimated you lost.
---
You da real mvp
---
Yeah, this seems to be a common theme in the feedback I'm receiving.
---
[All I saw when I first clicked this post.](https://youtu.be/W0w5oGVwJ_Q)
---
Because they screwed it up. It wasn‚Äôt what anybody wanted because it didn‚Äôt address the issue, he‚Äôs boring to play as and against. People wanted his power changed. BHVR just made changes to timing and some things about how his power worked but the problem was not addressed which is just his power in general. Freddy just needed to be improved, his power was fine but he needed more things to help him. Give him some extra abilities like the pig can trap people and also crouch, all he can do it pull people into a dream state, useless. He needed extra that‚Äôs all. Legion needed a re work.
---
Not sure as to the name atm, but at least 50% of my games against a GF he is literally IMPOSSIBLE to reveal. I‚Äôve even been messaged by the Killer after a game who was confused as to how they were never being broken out. I‚Äôve also playing in KYF lobbies with friends who have literally no idea how we weren‚Äôt able to break them out. The sound might start but never seems to complete even when both players are stationary, even when the survivor is behind cover and revealing him from there, and even when a survivor behind is also trying to reveal. The sound will start and either just stop or continuously restart over and over again. 
---
Not to mention, myself and several people I‚Äôve seen are getting purple AND red addons or items on their GG blood webs before even level 10?! Literally never seen that happen and I own every killer but Bubba. But on GF you get those strong add ons very early and then on literally every blood web from then on.
---
that‚Äôs all I think about when ever I play against a trapper.
---
Does everyone forget about discordance? That and bitter murmur/rancor is gonna be so powerful for Freddy gen teleports
---
I think the point was to show how fallible they are. Screams whole theme seems to be trying to break the meta of slasher films when it was made. I think that was a thought out feature instead of some slapstick stuff or something
---
Yes and around 60$ isn't bad. But it's too much for me to afford for something Im on the fence about. I have considered getting the Xbox game pass to try it out since it's only 10$ for a month. But again idk what it's like on console and I feel like that might mess with my perspective.
---
I don't handle toxicitiy well. Because I snap back. It doesn't roll off of me like it should. I've actually gotten communication banned on Xbox twice because of not being able to resist someone baiting me. And I feel I would be in a worse position with a pc game since text chat is easier to access than going to a profile and composing a message.
---
Flashlights are pretty pathetic, but I just consider that further justification. They'd be a ranged interrupt for Mori-less kill attempts.
---
I guess the rule would have to be that you must hook once before attempting a kill on the spot, or it'd have to take too long to be balanced. Which fits, anyway. "Well, I tried it the Entity's way..."
---
That would also be incentive to not camp.
---
I think Tru3 had the idea once for the chase music that plays to be related to the killers prestige. So if you are a P3 killer then there is some kind of in game representation of that. Most killers take cosmetics from the store over their bloody ones.
---
That's boring. To be that good every killer has to he op
---
That‚Äôs fine, I know that, but make it so where the killer can what my yell, but not my own it‚Äôs so obnoxious
---
And I love incentive against camping!
---
..Have you played as killer?
---
Most dlc's costs 7 if it's not on sale.
---
A quick search on this subreddit would‚Äôve revealed to you that yes, you‚Äôre not the only one. Tunneling is frowned upon. Tbagging is frowned upon. We have threads about it every single day. Are you new to this subreddit?
---
Agreed. Yet we are here and still talking about this. There will always be people,who will buy this sort of stuff and therefore gaming companies will do dlcs/skins/lootboxes etc.
---
Ikr? I dont feel a buff but most a nerd, oh now you can actually hit a survivor when you see it(because the others killers cant right?) And you lose the speed penalty and the aura reading across the map. Traps that slows down off what a joke
---
Can someone please explain the rework?
---
I mean I don‚Äôt always do that it‚Äôs really just about being in the moment. Whoever‚Äôs closer really I don‚Äôt specifically do that but nine times out of ten I go after the person who was just on the hook after hitting the rescuer at least once. I‚Äôm rank 12 killer right now I bought this game a few weeks ago so I‚Äôm def still noobish I just didn‚Äôt know y‚Äôall were perfectionists when it came to play styles
---
She about finna kobe at the end
---
I have literally had the most fun playing as a survivor. There is nothing better when everything just meshes well. Good team work, killer is good and makes it a challenge. Was my like my last game. Everyone liked out for one another.
---
I bought this game a couple weeks ago I didn‚Äôt know that y‚Äôall were so meticulous about how people played or didn‚Äôt play.
---
One of them had set "unready" one time, so I thought they qere discusaing if they would leave the lobby. In the mean time the other two who were with 70~80 ms(they didnt seem to lag in the game and one of them was able to escape) were just chilling. Was when this guy with the high ping got "ready" again and the other too followed in a blink. I couldn't cancel by the time and I had used my gruesome gatteu so I really didn't want to DC.
---
For the entire chapter?
---
Never said that. Just wanted to highlight, that it's kinda pointless to criticize. If like 40/100 ppl are buying new skins, they will continue this. ü§ó
---
I still really like their skins, but sometimes I question myself if its worth buying , when I get some serious bugs ingame, where I dont have any fun at.
---
My other points are still valid.
---
Well, there's also a really strict BP requirement on Killers, so trying to just get kills can seem much more appealing to anyone not confident in their chasing ability. I imagine the emotional satisfaction of earning a kill animation would pry a lot of people out of their comfort zone, though.
---
It you spawned into a game as a survivor and got tunneled and camped, would you appreciate it? It‚Äôs all about fairness. Nobody likes to play a match for 5 minutes and then return back to the main menu with only 2000 points.
---
Her ability is fairly close to long range camping if you get down to it, not that that's a bad thing. It's just not that perfect.
---
Look at the new wraith skin, any of the hallowed blight skins. Your Pc must be potato...they are really really good looking
---
Theres nobody left alive tho..
---
The other guy is correct. Ppl dont like being told,that these kind of behaviour ( what a pun) leads to the gaming industry being like its gonna get rn. No more completely finished games without a DLC( exceptions still exists,but rarely) , cosmetics for everyone, who pays and half assed balancing. üôÑ
---
I literally never camp. Because it is annoying. Now in terms of chasing after someone I didn‚Äôt know I was supposed to chase after the rescuer exclusively. I bet the developers of this game are fucking ripping their hair out and going bald because of how pissed off you guys get. I normally don‚Äôt get tunneled or what the fuck ever. Because I escape the killer by making scratch marks disappear by juking or something. If I do get caught I suck it up I don‚Äôt moan and message someone like UwU go easier plssssss u trash can!! Ugh. 
---
In all my gaming years I‚Äôve never played a game and had this level of bitch fit. MW2 lobby‚Äôs were better than this.
---
Holy shit. I am legit amazed because I have never seen this before
---
It's just a nerf.... the only buff is that he can actually hit survivor when he sees them(because the others killers cant right?) Bye aura reading, bye speed penalty, hello darkness
---
I would quit
---
Oh boy. You‚Äôre in for a surprise then.
---
It's asking if you dont ever run survivor perks that give health states or are op, if u never use flahlight or pallets etc
---
New power, more abilities. Lots of sleep.
---
A fucking parently like damn can I keep my right kidney
---
I‚Äôve been around since release. People have been saying it‚Äôll be dead soon for so long, but there continues to be more new players coming into the community, and a strong core group who remain faithful to the game. I suspect it‚Äôll be around for at least another 2 years.
---
üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨
---
I just recently started the game seriously today (survivor main) and ive just been finding myself fumbling into things and can never escape the killer. 
---
Need more time i assume, people on youtube make it look so easy
---
I played it, it's janky as hell, Survivors end up walking instead of running, trying to move the camera, run and hit a Survivor is a nightmare. I've had survivors drop palette on wrong side by accident too before.
---
PGTW, Ruin, Overcharge, BBQ.
---
You use Ruin to find the first survivors. Once you hook one, you not only have BBQ to find the others, but you also have PGTW and Overcharge to slow their progress down. 
---
Perfect build on Doc imo
---
When you take insidious on accident and decide you might as well camp the toxic survivor
---
Except it wouldn't be a nice touch if the devs made it in relation to foot binding. Rin is from Japan and footbinding is a Chinese thing. Also, Rin lives closer to modern times (she's a working woman at a restaurant that goes to a private university and owns a bike. Definitely after the 20th century) and footbinding had been dying off since the start of the 20th century and mostly disappeared by the 1950s.
---
He just went a tier higher with this rework. Still bad in my opinion
---
If everyone is asleep he can teleport to a gen every 18 seconds. Very good reason to wake up imo
---
Just about everything you do in the game gives you points. 
---
 You can only get 32k points a match without offering bonuses.
---
If you play killer, you'll want BBQ and Chili as a perk, it comes on the Cannibal(Leatherface). It nets you a 25% BP (XP) bonus per 1st hook on each survivor.
---
On survivor side, David King has a similar perk for Safe hook rescues each giving a 25% bonus to BP.
---
There are tons of offerings to give bonuses, and a handful of other perks spread across multiple characters but these 2 are probably the easiest way to grind BP.
---
Good luck.
---
Oh, most of my Killers are level 10. I just kind of putter around lower Ranks, where Survivor toxicity/SWF frequency (same slider) is lower and do my best to use character fundamentals. I don't even have meta perks to lean on.
---
I think I'll stick to console
---
To be fair, Survivors drop pallets on the wrong side fairly frequently on PC and console as well
---
No it‚Äôs not. Get a job.
---
So Freddy went from a sucky M1 killer to an M1 killer with mediocre powers. He‚Äôs dream snares may work but I don‚Äôt see his fake pallets working too often. Micro sleep may have made him better but his power is too convoluted. His whole teleportation ability spews out blood from the gen the second he begins to teleport and it takes a damn long time to do so. People will run a mile away before he teleports there. In summary, dream snares might work if you‚Äôre in a short loop. Fake pallets may trick a survivor once in a while. His teleportation will make survivors run a mile away before he even gets the chance to teleport. Micro sleep is the only worthwhile thing for Freddy, he went from completely unusable to Legion tier. This rework is just ‚Äúeh‚Äù for now in my opinion.
---
Can confirm, just played against a 500ms Myers.
---
If the goal was to make him feel like Freddy, I don't think they quite got it.
---
The Sleep Cycle is awesome, and having the time to wake up increase every time you do it is a good idea.
---
Aside from that... I mean Dream Projection is strong, but none of the abilities really suit Freddy (especially how the Sleep status doesn't really do much of anything).
---
**oinks in confusion**
---
Right, and we wouldn't want the single person powerrole that has to go up against four other people to be powerful.
---
Why my first tought was
---
"Damm, imagine the lag"
---
Also, imagine 8 survivors screaming because of doctor with a terror radius bigger than the map, showing the location to both hunter (if it dont show, and theyre friends, theres nothing stoping them from just telling) while theres a nurse just teleporting to each one and just killing with ease...
---
Sign me in. Would finally be something different and fun, also rewarding for BP farm while not farming.
---
Just didnt like much of the map colapsing just like a BR, imagine that on the game map.
---
Btw, no escaping uh? So no ruin, noed, adrenaline.
---
Probably everyone would just be using kiting perks all game.
---
I would actually make the following changes
---
*you need more than 5 gens to escape
---
*some killer perks are shared, like noed, ruin, spies from the shadows, infectious fright etc
---
*boxes refresh
---
*a rotation of banned perks for both sides, maybe daily, to spice things a little
---
*only one add-on
---
*maybe only the bigger maps
---
*no hatch and maybe no EGC
---
I think it would be fun
---
Edit: just imagined the killers guarding an open gate, just to get swarmed with 8 survivors runing together making their way trough
---
I got a similar one from a 12, but I wiped half of his team (and the third crawled through the exit) so he was kind of just a dick.
---
Just another point because I want to make sure it gets enough ;)
---
I have a Scream costume I bought for Halloween once. Your field of vision is shit. Your breathing is bad. Your movement is severely constrained by the robe. I'd guess that this makes killing people a lot harder, especially when your stick is to let them see you first and giving them a headstart. You have to catch up to them while being unable to go full speed and you have a massive tunnelvision.
---
Real life murders only have their fighting signs in a severely limited spot because real life murderers don't have costumes normally and most don't want the victim to live through a chase.
---
Idk how I feel about this.
---
Cowardice is what they do best, after all.
---
Alright, thank you
---
Got it :)
---
*gets 360‚Äôd, pallet stunned, shack looped, and then gets cucked by hatch escape*
---
My man David &lt;3
---
I think most of them are also. League of Legends has some leeway at least as it's F2P. But then again its lootboxes and also those from FIFA are basically a different form of gambling. I don't know much about Overwatch and FF14 but from the little I've seen, it does look like the same concept as you said. And yeah you're right. Basically the industry has boiled down to this where it favors several microtransactions. And it's turned out to be successful for most companies. 
---
BTW I don't know why got downvoted so hard. I'm sorry about that. I really despise the idea of upvotes/downvotes and how it limits discussions like this. It grinds my gears.
---
People talk about Iridescent Button, but i'm personally in love with Fuming Mixtape.
---
Negative experiences stay with you longer, you'll forget the simple gg a good sport sent you but you'll remember being called a cunt for using Franklin's by the sore loser.
---
Aren't you the optimist? No, the changes are final. He's.. Fun‚Ñ¢ now.
---
I'm 27, oh fuck.. is it too early to have my midlife crisis? Cause I feel like I'm having it
---
If you were that hot youd do the same
---
So Mount Everest key?
---
Don't buy it :)
---
I feel like the devs know they have a loyal fanbase so they know we'll inevitably pay for the overpriced skins
---
Higher! Like, Pluto key!
---
Yeah, doesn't that REPEL people from the game? If I knew nothing else and went "Oh, this is a game about being assholes to a Killer UP enough that you can get away with it," I'd give up on it as a horror experience or anything fun for Killer.
---
And DID, 2 years ago, from experiencing that.
---
*uno reverse*
---
I think I've had a few survivors unable to reveal me but it's hard to tell, and some survivors think I'm not revealed when I am, and run into walls. I've never had a problem when facing him but one of my friends did on the very game I just swung my camera around and got reveal bloodpoints.
---
I've not encountered that bloodweb quirk yet. I had to go through quite a bit before I got an ultra rare. I'm really underwhelmed by his addons though. BBQ addon can't replace BBQ/Tremors, default stalk is already enough and no-one but a NOED Ghostface would need an exposure extension.
---
I think the whole "facecamping meme" totally ruins the chance of a rework happening. Cause if they make him better it will just be worse to deal with.
---
To be fair, struggling is an awful mechanic and if other people weren't counting on me, I'd skip the carpal tunnel risk every time.
---
what the perk? 
---
it makes everyone exposed (one hit) and gives the killer a small speed boost. it's called no one escapes death.
---
EVERY TIME I'M BRINGING AN ITEM THE KILLER FINDS AND DOWNS ME IN 0.5 SECOND AND NOBODY SAVES ME OR MY INTERNET JUST DECIDES TO DIE
---
Literally happened to me today. I saved a Kate from a camping myers after I got the last gen done. The gate got opened before I saved her and we had a solid 3 mins to save each other. I unhook her immediately, body block the myers. He goes into tier 3 and I get downed. He runs to look for the Kate and he‚Äôs completely gone. Tier 3 gone and everything. So I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthe Kate‚Äôs gonna save me, she has the perfect opportunity!‚Äù I look over and see her run to the exit gate and leave! The killer wasn‚Äôt even there! He was camping the other gate the complete opposite direction she was in! I didn‚Äôt pip but I didn‚Äôt de-pip either. I probably would‚Äôve if I just escaped and left her behind. Probably would‚Äôve gotten more bloodpoints too.
---
WE NEED MORE PALLETS TO BULLY KILLERS!!!1!
---
I love your art so fucking much all of your posts in here have made my night
---
I'm the opposite. I'm a brave unhooker, but end up getting my rescuee immediately downed again.
---
Or maybe some players were just really campy/tunnelly and I got the natural timing for it right. All I know is gestures from the hook might be nice.
---
No you too
---
I love this!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Aren't you the pessimist? I seriously doubt the changes are final. Just enough to keep people from complaining.
---
Some Killers will pretend to give hatch only to be a dick and close it for an easy kill. I‚Äôd say a lot of survivors have trust issues now because of this behavior.
---
So what did he get in a nutshell thank you
---
Maybe a space station with a "Thing" like killer to accompany it.
---
When he was released, BHVR expressed the goal that he was supposed to be a "Mindfuck killer".
---
Madness was meant to be something that seriously screwed with the person behind the keyboard.
---
Instead, he just became anti-stealth.
---
Only one add-on ever really tricks people (fake pallets), with one runner up that occasionally makes it harder to win mindgames against Doctor (fake stain).
---
People don't give two shits that they're insane. They're mildly annoyed that they have to snap out of it, and dislike how they can't hide because an illusion spawns and gives them away.
---
They added a stun with his power in a rework that attempted to make him playable since he had *absolutely no chase power* on launch.
---
The shock is alright, but it's old code and it shows.
---
* The stun effect is super unreliable. Even if you land it at a time that should work, there's a chance they just vault immediately after, while screaming.
---
* The delays involved make it feel really clunky.
---
* This was made when most maps were flat. Now that varied heights are super common, the shock only working on the ground causes constant problems.
---
As for what is wanted for him... I only want two things.
---
* Madness should be genuinely disorienting (for both survivors and the Doctor; remember line one of his power, "Is it a gift or a curse?")
---
* The Doctor should be playable at red ranks.
---
Just buff his uncloak and make its sound identical from anywhere in his terror radius so he can actually jumpscare players.
---
Oh, and count his chasing if he's cloaked. It's weird that the game doesn't, right?
---
Agreed. I've gotten slammed today with rank 2's, 8's, 12's, etc. etc., even though I'm a rank 14 killer. This should never be able to happen. The devs need to get on top of this shit, like a year ago.
---
*I've
---
Rank 1‚Äôs can and will make the same mistakes as every other rank it just shows how much you play the game.
---
I thought so too until I discovered how well it works on Plague :D
---
I TEABAG KILLERS SO THAT THEY WILL WASTE MORE TIME HITTING ME ON THE HOOKS OR TEA BAG ME, ESCAPE MY FOLLOW SURVIVORS!!
---
It's a crime that an actual good drawing like this isn't getting as many upvotes as all the cringe inducing chibi shit this sub constantly pukes out.
---
But it slows Freddy down, which he can't really afford. Black Box needs to be scrapped, it's so easily ignored and only works once then it's literally a wasted add-on slot for the rest of the match. I don't know any other add-on in the game that works like Black Box does.
---
I don't know if it's going to buy you as much time as Ruin would but it's more consistent. By consistent I mean that you have it for the whole game and not just the first few minutes.
---
And yet most of us would still eat him
---
And to your right, you'll see a Nea becoming one with the tree.
---
This was my boyfriend playing as David,  and when it happened he messaged me right away to tell me what happened.  I love this video and I just checked today to see it on YouTube and saw it had 600+ views.  Asked him about it and he said it got posted here.  &lt;3 Thanks for sharing it.
---
It‚Äôs too slow without Botany Knowledge.
---
It's still bm tho...
---
STFU, this game is so bad, Freddy rework is bad, EGC is bad, why only a killer and not a survivor in the new chapter, why new chapters when so many bugs reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Oh I agree Black box is a waste of an addon. Im probably just gonna see how it goes in the PTB.
---
They don‚Äôt make them like that used to...
---
The traps are kind of shit, wish he had just the pallets. Also, teleport, fuck yeah!
---
Am I the only one who insta DCs when it's the nurse or doctor
---
That‚Äôs why my play style has been a lot more about hit and run tactics and trying to keep pressure on all four people at once, then doubling back without my power to get someone. I also do like blocking a crucial point while coming out of Frenzy, seems to work very well for punishing.
---
I LOVE RUNNING NOED AND WATCHING SURVIVOR DOWN IN 1 HIT =D SO MUCH FUN!!
---
Object of obsession
---
At least karma came back to bite them in the ass &lt;3
---
Remember how before Ghostfaces ptb a fair few were worried he'd be far too easy to reveal.
---
And then he was.
---
And how some were worried 20 seconds would be nowhere near enough time to realistically close the gap?
---
And then it wasnt.
---
And then we had to have our fingers crossed that the devs with a spotty track record at best would fix it?
---
And to their credit, they did, kinda. Reveal is still inconsistent as fuck but he's far better.
---
Unfortunately, the community at this point pretty much knows what to expect...all that said.
---
I don't think he'll be too bad...always having his teleport, even if it is slow as fuck, its still map pressure. Which he never had before. And the traps are nice too since as far as Im aware, they dont dissapear when triggered (?) So you can set and forget.
---
I can hear the "D'OH!" from BHVR headquarters, now.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9csjd/i_think_i_found_a_glitch_or_ghost_face_has_a/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Some of the worst survivors I've ever played with were rank 1s.
---
I know the Scream movies just turned into parodies of themselves, but one of the things that I really loved about all of them, is that they never were worried about hurting their killer in the most ridiculous of ways.
---
This chase scene in particular, I think the one from.....Scream 3? Has him just being a total bumbling idiot almost the hole chase. It's amazing.
---
As far as I know there is currently no way to see your stats
---
GGEZ
---
As far as i‚Äôm aware you can only see your current account level and rank
---
Yes! I was surprised that she didn‚Äôt come out with ghost face
---
That‚Äôs a little annoying.
---
Your game saw the survivors get saved and was just like, fuck nah gbye
---
Actually if not everyone is Nurse or Spirit level Nurse and Spirit are still gonna be th eonly characters played at red ranks, which makes the game kinda boring despite its variety of killers
---
The phrasing is misleading. You're constantly falling asleep after a minute, but when you use this, you wake up and the timer for you falling asleep is PAUSED for 30 seconds, after which it starts again, making you fall asleep after 60 seconds.
---
No no... they used them correctly.
---
So what are you still doing here? And why are you still complaining and making petty posts like this one?
---
Overpowered? Sorry for being rude but learn how to play. I am purple rank and always play with my red rank friends and we usually get really good killers (not counting the campers and stuff).
---
Even Hillbilly gets destroyed by good teams and he can't do anything about it. I don't think killers should always 4k blah blah but I want to know it's my fault or I was worse not "oh well, I couldn't do anything, because they were running in circles and see me on loops"
---
Just started this game (~50hrs ingame) and thought this was unfair for me as a lvl 17 Killer
---
&gt;I believe the leather Pig skin is next then Dwight/Huntress then the other Pig one
---
Not according to some speculations based on game files. But hey, your guess is as good as any other, they just have some proof to base theirs.
---
Fake, you don't have insidious
---
Half the time I kill survivors they complain about how I did it no matter how I did it.
---
They actually communicated in the live stream that being asleep isn't necessarily bad. You don't get any action debuffs and you're not shown to Freddy. However, you become suspectible to Freddy's powers when sleeping, so it's a disadvantage you have compared to being awake.
---
Survive with friends. It's pretty common
---
Dilemma, players always fall into this situation all the time save or escape. Left behind is painful specially when saving you were too easy.
---
This was on webofshadows stream and i can tell you xD this was creepy as hell lol
---
Too easy for the killers, still 5 gens and a very slow gen repair?
---
Yeah, enjoy playing gen simulator, no thanks.
---
(I‚Äôm assuming optimal survivors, which is where I feel tierlists matter.)
---
1. Wraiths chase is not good. Wraith‚Äôs bodyblocking and uncloaking mindgames aren‚Äôt as strong as other killers, decent survivors can force wraith to be a basic m1 killer with nothing else, always. I will concede that the uncloaking mindgames are hard to play as survivor, but I‚Äôd rather face those than a billy rev or a pig ambush.
---
2. Maybe make the addon remove the shimmer entirely so you‚Äôre just invisible outside of a certain range. I do just think many killers need an addon rework, since many just suck or are broken entirely (Leatherface‚Äôs chili does literally nothing lmao)
---
3. Bodyblocking and positioning as wraith is required, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt take 600iq for a survivor to counterplay. Good survivors never get hit for free from wraith, they messed up long time ago if I manage to get a free hit. It‚Äôs a basic he must learn to make up for his terrible chases, which is why I really like bamboozle on wraith (Vault shack window, uncloak near the pallet tends to work)
---
No terror radius rarely matters with good survivors, since the distance you make up won‚Äôt get you a free hit unless they mess up and i‚Äôd rather be a different killer than starting a chase a bit closer since they tend come to bloodlust anyhow. Moving faster and having that pressure doesn‚Äôt make up for his nonexistent chase, especially on larger maps. Zoom and Jumpscare haven‚Äôt been very impressive tbh, as it doesn‚Äôt solve his massive looping problem, I prefer instabreak pallets with endurance/spirit fury since it makes your chases far better. 
---
Map pressure, chasing, and tracking are what killers need at red ranks. Wraith‚Äôs pressure is unimpressive, since his chase is so bad. I think his tracking is fine since the extra speed plus bbq being a really good perk on him to save time to get into a new chase instantly. I think he‚Äôs the definition of C tier, as he‚Äôs basically a mouse1 killer. I think he‚Äôs better than leatherface (Whose one ability is literally useless until high bloodlust), Freddy, and Legion. 
---
Wraith just needs his invisibility to matter more. It feels weird that you rarely need to factor it in while making decisions, you just assume survivors will see you and as survivor you just squint more. He‚Äôs a weak killer, but he‚Äôs fun to play.
---
Aren't there a set number of variants though? For example I heard some people calling one the 'T' and another one the 'L'. 
---
Basically I just want to see how things look since for our game the map placement will also be random aside from a few things.
---
did you guys check the prices in RU verison? it is barely 3$ for 1 set
---
Kea Narlsson
---
I think its the range that matters, he‚Äôs almost unplayable without a range addon and quite alright with one. Why does a killer need an addon to work at all?
---
Hahaha sexual harassment, super hilarious and definitely not *cringey and suoer gross*
---
To be fair, I did post this at midnight

 Now if it was a clip of ghost face in the game mori-ing someone and then ghost face in the movie came next to her and was about to get ‚ÄúMori‚Äù in the movie too, you‚Äôll have solid gold my friend

Uhm üòÇ I just want teammates. And have fun while playing. I do not take it THAT serious tbh.

Wait... Now I am hungry!

This is something that has been in the game for a while.

Probably the devs just forgetting their own lore tbh.

Also found from the wiki "According to¬†Benedict Baker's Journal, the Heartbeat heard by the Survivors is not their own, but the Killer's. However, this is contradicted by a Mysterious Note found in The Fog, which states that it is indeed the Survivors' own heartbeat that they hear."

You dont have to take it seriously. The game just has a decent amount of nuance to it and understanding not just the killers and survivors but also the types of players you'll encounter will help you enjoy it way more.

This movie is and always will be a classic.

&gt; The game was designed without it so while it may be fun in the short term in the long term you're not really going to get better.

This is none of your business though? OP looks for other people to play with and not for advices if it's better to play solo or in a premade group and what "consequences" or advantages each option has.
---
Moldy electrode in his basekit would be nice. His shock range should be a little bit longer. A little increase to the duration of (I legit have no clue how to type this) but its where you can't throw pallets or vault windows after you get shocked.
---
Go fuck yourself cuntface.

You CAN take friends into a normal match, just as survivors though. 
---
Survive with friends = you and up to 3 other players as survivors against a random killer in an online match
---
Kill Your Friends = private lobby for 2-5 players, all perks/items/addons/offerings unlocked, free map choice etc pp
---
&gt;Okay let me get this straight for you. Freddy was ABSOLUTELY NOT overpowered in anyway before his need. 
---
Not according to most of the community nor the devs who agreed with them.  He wasn't, in actuality, but that doesn't really change the history that people bitched and said so, Devs agreed and he was nerfed.
---
Me and the boys in creative mode.
---
I have never watched the freddy movies. This intrigued me.
---
What do you mean normal match? The solo and swf ques both lead into the same ranked que system. Just que swf and invite whoever. If you dont have a full party it will auto fill randoms.
---
Likewise! It's great.
---
The fact that I brought it and was able to help my friend out
---
Only way to fix that is with billy or nurse
---
This is an auras bug, it should've been fixed while ago, but "devs" aren't going to
---
People see him as bad. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt make him bad.
---
It was an event, can‚Äôt remember which though
---
I mean, taking your friends into: Play as a survivor. 
---
I tried both of the ones you named here. But those aint normal matches. If I explained myself good enough.
---
I am not english sorry. So I try to understand.
---
bUt hE cAn tElEpOrT tO gEnS nOw... lmao  
---
which is very useful when all gens are done or hatch is closed.  
---
Just walk away if he placed a snair (just like hag traps or trapper bear traps), probably great way to troll/annoy him while he is in chase with someone else.
---
very [pj harvey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Rid_of_Me.jpg/220px-Rid_of_Me.jpg)
---
Preach!
---
If you play on Xbox you can see your stats for kills/escapes and total bloodpoints. But not time played on each killer/survivor if you want more in depth stats.
---
Stop posting this, or devs might consider no ruin wraith strong
---
You'll see, eventually.
---
What causes it?
---
NEXT TIME I GET IN A GAME WITH A DOCTOR USING EBONY MORI I WILL FUCKING KILL MYSELF GOD DAMN SHIT FUCK CUM BURGER ASS LICKING WHORE BITCH
---
Okay this one is gonna be a doozie to list down.
---
Summary:
---
Aura reveals and speed debuffs are long no longer apart of Freddy‚Äôs kit and have been removed accordingly. Debuffs are only available via addons now. 
---
New Powers:
---
 
---
**Microsleep** (Passive). 
---
Survivors now passively fall asleep in 60 seconds. This will be reflected into the survivor hud.
---
During microsleeps survivors cannot see Freddy if they‚Äôre father than 22 meters away from him. 
---
Meanwhile while within 16-22 survivors will see glimpses of him going in and out of existence. If survivors are closer than 16 meters away from him, survivors will see him as normal. 
---
Freddy can now attack survivors instantly without needing to pull them into the Dreamworld first. 
---
**Lullaby**
---
Lullaby is now no longer directional and only has a distance loudness to tell the killer‚Äôs position. Huntress is also affected by this change.
---
Terror radius and lullaby are now reversed in Microsleeps. During awake survivors hear Freddy‚Äôs terror radius/heartbeat and they hear the lullaby. 
---
**Wake up.**
---
Survivors now have more ways to fall asleep. 1. Failing a skillcheck. 2. Woken up by an awake survivor. 3. By doing an Alarm Clock event. Where survivors have to find a desk scattered around during the trial with an Alarm clock on the farthest away side of the map from them.
---
Alarm Clock events take 15 seconds to complete. 
---
Wake up from other survivors duration changed with every Wake up action taken with it. Starting from 6 seconds to 12 seconds to 16 seconds
---
Only healthy survivors can be Wake up. Survivors will need to heal first before they can use the Wake up event. 
---
Adrenaline still wakes survivors up.
---
**Dream snare:**
---
Freddy can place up to 8 Dream snares around the map. Survivors can see these traps on the ground in the form of a pool of blood.
---
Once triggered Snares are active for 5 seconds.
---
Slow lasts for 3 seconds.
---
The oldest trap will be recycled whenever a the last trap is created, similar to the hag.
---
Survivors walking over the traps will be affected by the following things.
---
Survivor will scream, similar to the doctors madness _aura_ reveal (notification bubble). Revealing their location.
---
Survivors will get slowed down by 15% and they cannot perform rushed window vaults. 
---
In the moments survivors cannot destroy dream snares. 
---
Dream snares can be detected by small game.
---
**Dream projection:**
---
Allows Freddy to channel an ability to teleport to a generator. Channeling the ability will spawn a blood pool near the generator and a Freddy projection (similar to the Hag‚Äôs Phantasm Trap) once the channel is completed Fredy will take over the projection.
---
Dream projection cooldown is 45 seconds. For every survivor in the dream world, Dream projection‚Äôs cooldown is reduced by 15% for a total of 60%. Its possible to get up to 80% cooldown if all survivors are a sleep and with addons.
---
Dream projection can be canceled.
---
**Dreamworld and addons**
---
Actionspeed debuff is now only an addon, with a reduced amount. 
---
Addon; Dream pallets. Replaces dream snares with trap pallets. 
---
Spawns dream pallets in areas without any pallets.
---
They have collision for the survivors  and they can interact with Dream Pallets.  
---
Unlike the doctors that disappear when you‚Äôre close to them, the Dream pallets only disappear/destroyed after a survivor has interact with it. Freddy will be able to see the fake pallets.
---
Addon ultra rare: Effects unknown, Freddy can no longer teleport to Dream projection.
---
**IMPORTANT**
---
- Addons that you have collected on your Freddy will stay in your loadout after the rework. Just like the Wraith and Legion update, they will simply change around the rarity.
---
- Dream world darkness/grain etc effects are not done yet but will be in next Tuesday's PTB.
---
- Values and other stuff are not final. There will be a ptb next Tuesday to test changes and adjust them accordingly depending on community feedback.
---
- Bhvr also asked if they _did a pretty good job so far._
---
Phew thank you for reading through this. Overall the changes work aims to move Freddy from a frustrating killer to play against at low ranks and severely underpowered in the higher ranks due to the old ability's nature which was more about waiting to attack  and aura reveals that don't help with chases. The move now moves Freddy into a more flexible role of being able to chase on top of map pressure with his mobility ability. 
---
Comment if there's anything more that I initially missed or new information is brought up in the forums.
---
True @AliveByMoonlight. But I did learn now that in the Play as a survivor mode, I cannot add my friends in it. Only "random" players join, right?
---
You could have left him and went for another survivor?
---
But how would they go through them? Open &amp; close? That takes precious time
---
Yeah if you say something negative on here you get downvoted because people want to believe we are one big happy family, we support each other against the big menace known as Instagram  and praise our gods Bob Ross, Steve Irwin and Keanu Reeves. If you say against this norm you break people's perceptions of reality and they realise that this is nothing more than a site for reposts and karma exploitations. But they don't want to believe that because the truth hurts, so they downvote you instead.
---
Reminds me of a game i played yesterday, one dude was camping the hatch with 1 gen left with another survivor left who actually tried completing a gen. 
---
Was pretty pissed but it is what it is
---
He's getting a lot. I'm not sure if you can nutshell it since he's getting about three different abilities from it. But if i had to try I'd say they made him into a more chase and pressure based killer with two of the abilities added in. With a soft stealth kit with the passive as well as a way to slow down the survivors from doing objective.
---
I was playing the killer the other day (on ps4) and seen this with not only the doors but generators as well. It's pretty wack.
---
No, but I do go downstairs to watch some good old cbbc. Have the tv on loud so I'll be able to hear it from down there.
---
AGH AHWGSAHSGSH
---
WARNING. THE COMPLETE DECONTAMINATION OF GIDEON MEAT PLANT WILL OCCUR IN T MINUS 15 MINUTES. ALL BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCES MUST BE REMOVED TO AVOID DESTRUCTION
---
What causes it? It must be sort of rare, or not something you can do on purpose right? Otherwise they would have to fix it...?
---
Pretty Woman LF or I'm not buying any new DLC
---
Surprise pikachu face
---
You are right.
---
His power now relies on survivors making mistakes so he will now be bad in higher ranks while he will destroy lower ranks even worse than before.
---
Except the teleport (which can not be used to mind game high rank survivors sadly) most of his power is just shitty parts of other killers.
---
The traps are like the   [Waterlogged Shoe](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Waterlogged_Shoe)  addon of the hag but that only works on sleeping survivors and the fake pallets won't work on good survivors since they are paying attention but will completely stomp low rank survivors.
---
He now went from a killer who was the best at everything except chase to a killer that has shitty parts of other killers, needs to wait for people to fall asleep to actually be able to use it and also can be countered by waking up in 3 different ways.
---
This will make low ranks full of Freddy players while high ranks won't have him at all.
---
There is a reason his difficulty level is 'hard' You do not chase someone down until they are put in the dying state like other killers if you play him like that of course he is going to be F tier.
---
But if you actually think about how his power works, play around it and chose the right addons then you have a killer who can put more pressure on survivors than any other killer can even dream of, knows where you are exactly about 80% of the match, and you [never see him comming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVj0Z6ahcI) until he has his glove in your back.
---
Basically they were like ‚Äúyou want map pressure? Say no more fam.‚Äù And gave him god tier map pressure.
---
Yeah or they‚Äôll ‚Äúlet you‚Äù open the door then when it‚Äôs about to open down you to end game :(
---
Yeah that‚Äôs most likely it, I feel like they just make up that shit on spot and go from there lol
---
GOD MYERS
---
I absolutely think the trapper one was better, so simple and elegant.. but I wanted to make that spirit face lol
---
Woah woah woah guys calm down he has a point.
---
Words of wisdom uttered by the modern philosopher: ‚Äòasspuncher900‚Äô
---
He get stuned by palet aka doors.
---
I can understand omega blink nurse, but why doctor?
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs bad. 
---
I also don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs good. 
---
Therefore he‚Äôs alright.
---
... That explains a lot of this 'toxic profile comment' mentality to me. Never realized there wasn't an after-lobby chat on console.
---
Play as survivor and Survive with friends are normal matches. Play as survivor is solo and Survive with Friends is with friends. But they're both normal matches.
---
He has **ASCENDED**
---
so i might get downvoted but, Ochido has some montages. I dont watch him however but ive heard he is pretty toxic.
---
Ohw so when you play with friends you also get the normal point etc? Me and my friends thought we didnt.. üòÖ
---
Sorry, I won't thank the devs till they do a proper apology for that 'Well, just go play Civ instead' statement. That was horribly out of line, everyone realized that, and there still was never an apology.
---
James from Dead Meat love his channel
---
Yes :) Only *Kill Your Friends* is private, which means you do not get points to spend at the end. Play as killer, play as survivor AND Survive with Friends are all normal matches
---
Okay just because I'm really curious if your trolling or not. He did not mean your bad at the game homie just that your no better than the people complaining about the rework.
---
Oh come on complaining about looping... Complaining about survivors that are well practiced enough to play optimally.. it's not just 'technically' not toxic, it's not toxic at all, it's being a good player.
---
WAAAAAZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUPPPPP
---
Bruh
---
buying gf
---
She's concentrating. I probably have an intense frown on my face 100% of the time I play.
---
The killer is a killer... being rude is part if their job... if you down the unhooked player the other survivor is punished very heavily towards their emblems/pip. I know not everyone cares about their rank but if youre having issues with people making unsafe rescues just run DS. Thats why its in the game
---
I generally will only facecamp if the survivor is trying to be openly toxic(tbagging and taunting) and it‚Äôs the end game. If your asking for it, I will give it to you.
---
Nah, David and Jake. They even have matching clothing that was released in pride month.
---
"gets a 4k" still complains
---
I actually think hallowed blight skins look like a mess. Too much of this glowy yellow stuff.
---
How? Hes just pressing a button and the match is already over. Same thing about teabagging. Theres literally no point to get mad about it
---
It happens to me every single killer game, no matter who i‚Äôm playing.
---
104 downvotes so far. What did we learn about respecting women today, timmy?
---
Me and my friends in a nutshell
---
Surely it is a bit unfair.
---
But the reason you are facing a red rank is part of an earlier fix they made. Because waiting times for swf with a big rank gap were horrendous they applied a 'fix'. The longer the swf group is waiting for a match the bigger the range of ranks and experience ingame the game will look out for. 
---
So if they could not find a suiting match (which would be around a rank 8-10 killer) for a long time, the game will look for lower and higher ranked killers so waiting time is shortened.
---
There‚Äôs a slight chance he looks at this sub cus he‚Äôs definitely made DBD references in his videos before
---
With a M1 killer the thing is to make them use pallets early game as fast as you can, but not tunneling them one by one until you get a down.
---
You have to focus as well on "defending" 3 gens that are close to each other.
---
AWESOME! Im still looking for teammates then haha üòä
---
This just seems so logical
---
Omg so wholesome‚ù§
---
Usually when I'm last alive, I don't go for the hatch. I just go for an exit gate and hope that I can open that the moment the hatch gets closed.
---
When i play killer (like 10% of the time) i dont tend to see BT or DS that often anymore so if downing the unhooked survivor is gunna be easier i tend to go for them. However if the rescuer is in their final hook state and the unhooked one isnt ill usually peel away to try and eliminate a player. Just gotta play smart.
---
Keep up the good work! Really like your art style. Didn‚Äôt know I needed a lingerie Ghostface skin till I saw your previous post üòÇ
---
But Doofy was Ghostface.
---
I mean whether or not you get mad about it is irrelevant to the fact that hitting on the hook and tea bagging are both only done to anger the other Player. It's BM because you're trying to anger the other person, you're rubbing it in that they lost. Doesn't matter if it works, it's still being a dick for no reason.
---
You know scream is satire right...
---
You‚Äôre kidding right? Wraith over clown? Clown forces survivor movements and forces pallets early or you‚Äôll get hit. Wraith has nothing. You can be the best wraith in the world and you‚Äôll still get outclassed by an optimal survivor team.
---
Seems like Freddy‚Äôs early game is a lot stronger then his late game. As survivors die and gens are completed he loses his 15% debuff on this teleport and less gens to teleport to. Or maybe that‚Äôs good...? What do you think? End game he has no teleport though.
---
I guess that's true for purely competitive players that are trying to maximize win potential but it would incentivize other killers that dont want to trade fun for wins to play other killers.
---
True, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a Japanese female survivor that had this face.
---
So uh let's get James in DBD
---
Lmao nothing better than smacking a team and then getting the notification, ‚Äúplayer has added you to a group‚Äù that‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôve made it as a killer
---
Hello there
---
Here‚Äôs my opinion: The killers need to be balanced. A prime example of a balanced killer is billy, as a really good billy can 4K almost every game, but survivors still have many things they can do to counter him. However some killers(like Freddy or bubba) have powers that don‚Äôt help them much(unless in certain situations) or may even harm them in certain situations. While killers like nurse and spirit have easy 4ks every game especially with even just yellow addons. So killers just need to be centralized and nearly equally strong(about as strong as billy). I understand if you disagree with me and I would love to hear why.
---
Does anyone know if Ash is in this version?
---
Can I see the trapper one?
---
I believe it‚Äôs the Glass Splinter
---
Inappropriate. How about learn to respect women? Probably can't because you can't even respect yourself at this point
---
Well two of the most frustrating killers to play against are the two top killers. 
---
So do with that what you will.
---
SWF with Object of Obsession completely kill his power.
---
And survivors with awareness will never get grabbed by him because you can still see him and hear his clothes.
---
If there‚Äôs a lullaby, it‚Äôs directional.
---
"It's a feature!" - some guy that can't fix it probably.
---
Me and the boys when we find the Red Stone of Aja
---
Yeah it's not really the players fault it's more I can't really loop and getting shocked and thrown gas at doesn't really help and I almost always die against them
---
But they also cant fast vault thru it, making it balanced.
---
They have that on the mobile Dbd rip off horrorfield. Light doors are a couple licks and metal doors are like 5 or 6 kicks and it's entirely more annoying and compared to a pallet it would be incredibly easy to break line of sight with and escape chases better.
---
P.S. I like playing legion mostly as a killer, so you come across a rank 20 (ish) legion who seems friendly, that is probably me lol
---
One of the big issues there is, as usual, the shot grind. Not just are you going to earn much less as survivor, but it‚Äôs bad enough trying to get the must have perks on one side. I‚Äôm having a lot of fun playing survivor (baby meg) but I play about 1 in 8 games on that side. I still have wayyy too much vital stuff to unlock on the farmer side.
---
we have nothing better to do. the wait times are too long
---
I had a ghostface who let me open the door, downed me and let me crawl almost to the exit before picking me up and taking me to a hook, dropping me, picking me back up and dropping me again before finally hooking me. :c it sucks, especially when your entire team DC‚Äôs on you.
---
Jeez he‚Äôs just too ^edgy lads
---
General Kenobi!
---
Being friendly doesn't mean you're not trying to kill them in the end. I don't camp and try to not tunnel, but my ultimate goal is still 4k (after 12 hooks). I'm not letting them escape on purpose.
---
the only acceptable reason of hitting a person that got hooked is if you want to stop them screaming. after that its bm
---
Ofc you play blendette, why am I not surprised. Every killer that complains about looping seems to play her. Which means you have no idea how to play the game at high ranks.
---
Yeah huntress lullaby already is good on freddy and will still be after the rewok, although staying in dreamworld will not be as punishing as before, and survivors gain a new way to wake up (the alarm clocks) so it will be a bit less useful.
---
seeing that the legion was hitting the nea on the hook its probably salt
---
plz someone tell me what meme this is
---
Clown only has one ability. Wraith gets a free initial hit on top of being able to apply statuses on the survivors. Despite being tied to the cloak Wraith still has ways to pressure a map and slow down the game down. With the help of the mobility in clock and the way the addons interract with it,.  
---
The Clown is objectively bad in the game current's state. He still has to hit survivors twice. He has no way of slowing down the game, no mobility to pressure the survivors. = He only has one ability and one use in his ablity.  While I personally love the clown and probably the only one in AP to be playing him, there is a reason why people say that he's a boring one dimensional killer because he's only really good at one thing and that's the only thing he can do.
---
Hillbilly just flying through the door with chainsaw. Love it.
---
mabey its not god tier, but it is really good with the ability to teleport to any not fully done gen, especialy with perks like servalence, discordance, and pop goes the weasle
---
I dont think its BM to teabag, or what the killer is doing on the video. It does not affect the match in any way, you shouldnt be considered bad sport for doing it.
---
And when it comes to doing it to get a reaction from the others, the simple solution is to ignore it, like i said its not worth getting mad about it.
---
I was talking about the perk
---
I belive he can still see auras outside his terror radius
---
Its the DBD Reddit, so I'm betting no.
---
oh I understand. I don't let them escape on purpose. It just happens cause I am still learning how to play a killer. I  am still pretty bad so matches don't last much.
---
No he can‚Äôt
---
Lmao recently had this happen with the clown and I 100% shit bricks. I always tell my friend I hate playing survivor cause it makes me feel extra stupid thinking about all the survivors I must miss when I play killer
---
Oh. Then i honesty dont know. Traps/dream palettes
---
But that‚Äôs it so there‚Äôs no point in leaving :/
---
You mean god of virgin, whoever runs that shit has balls the size of a peanut
---
At high ranks, those perks are EXTREMELY common. At least for me. It's best to always play around them
---
Oof, that's a lot of salt.
---
No there‚Äôs plenty of other spineless survivors like yourself too :)
---
Maybe theyll add something. A 5% progress would be nice
---
Only add ons will do that they said
---
"Huh, guess David's a dumbass" into "Wow, David just saved my fuckin' life" real fast.
---
Then yeah theres no point in leaving if you can stand the white fog
---
its a meg in the wild
---
Funny meme!shame that the community at any sudden moment attacks each other. But I like the post!
---
this just made me think. do some people actually masturbate at their own nudes
---
**no u**
---
We love dying on first hook!
---
Shit, now that you bring it up, it's true
---
I dont mind the downvotes. Ppl know  that I'm telling the truth.
---
It has been confirmed in one of their stream that this bit is not true.
---
It jhas been mentionned in the streams of the devteam that it isn‚Äôt true.
---
3.07055 = (0.5n)(sin 21.1765)(1)
---
Wait so this means he will tunnel a survivor as soon as he hit them?
---
You still killed all so, that‚Äôs that.
---
Yeah, i'm not seeing much incentive to wake up either. It doesn't matter how often he's going to be able to teleport to Gens when that 5 second warning is more than enough time to get to a safe place or at least gain a pretty good distance.
---
I GUESS YOUR EXPERIENCES ARE YOUR EXPERIENCES BUT I DONT SEE CLOWN/FREDDY/LEGION AS ANY WORSE THAN HILLBILLY/NURSE
---
You know what would balance the game out? Just remove the killers powers. The powers make them op. Give survivors special powers instead[.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=R/%2bwoooosh&amp;amp=true)
---
Object of depression
---
After she vaulted the window, she chased the David with still no heartbeat though
---
Wow 0_0
---
So be it. I‚Äôm bad and I‚Äôm having fun.
---
Oh never mind. I see that she is still crouch walking after the vault.
---
I prefer killer to be honest level 30 trapper, level 16 doctor, level 18 hag. I never see scratch marks.
---
Survivors shouldn‚Äôt be able to 180 and directly look behind them while working on a generator, change my mind
---
The oy thing I don't understand, is that Myers is bigger than gf, and people notice him less, like with gf I caught very few survivor but with Myers I  can catch at least the first always
---
I mean what else are you gonna do the game's over.
---
\&gt;camping
---
\&gt;last person on the hook
---
ok
---
It's more fun to watch them bleed and scream, while watching your attack animation, than just standing there doing nothing.
---
That sounded worse than I thought it would.
---
It‚Äôs cosmetics ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
When facing 4 man swf's, they should still have a 50% debuff when in the dream state lol üòà
---
The right way to play Ghostface.
---
maybe Myers's breathing sound is less noticeable than GF's
---
It‚Äôs horrendous on Xbox sometimes. You can‚Äôt help but get mad and shoot them a message. üòÖüò™
---
Because weasley is our king!
---
I do, when i play stealth killer i relish in lery‚Äôs
---
Would be sitting open, like how pallets are as they lean up against something. You could slam it in a fashion as Sidney does to Ghostface up there, and it'd be just the same stun. Though, the door would then be closed. Killers would break through it \[Whether they kick it/use their weapon, or chainsaw it with Billy or Bubba\]. Literally Just like pallets, but a different animation.
---
Wait McDonald‚Äôs can have wifi?
---
Yeh but don't forget it's in early early development
---
But the game is not free. If the game is free, having cosmetic with high prices are okay. Like in dota 2, theres a cosmetic which is called arcana and is way too popular and cost $34. Now that arcana is not even a complete set. It might just be a head or just a hand cosmetic. And nobody complain about high prices of cosmetic cause game is free. You dont need it to buy them or anything to play.
---
I remember playing with my friend and he said ‚ÄúNo one plays Myers‚Äù literal seconds later he got grabbed off the gen by him, scared the shit out of us
---
gg
---
You caught me off guard god dammit xd
---
[This might be what you're looking for](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Realms)
---
1. Traps and pallets only affect dreaming survivors 
---
2. When dreaming, you don‚Äôt hear the heart beat. You hear his lullaby instead. You can‚Äôt tell how close he is.
---
3. Each survivor that‚Äôs dreaming makes cooldown of his teleport ability shorter. They said about 15% per survivor, up to 60%, but I‚Äôm not sure if it reduces the cooldown or increases the recharge time.
---
4. He has add-ons that affect dreaming survivors
---
Personally for me I always felt it was more distance based instead of direction based unlike the huntress'. So it might've been something they changed internally before settling on making it not directional.
---
why you have to be so toxic?
---
Even if you can run away, it would make it difficult to actually get the gen done that way though, and once the closest pallet is gone(depending on the map/specific gen) it might not take him much of a chase to get a hit, and then he could repeat that.  
---
It's still obvious much less of a detriment than the previous sleep, and you would likely be fine never waking up in most matches.  I think there could be circumstances where denying him additional map pressure could be worth waking up though.
---
WAAAHHHHHH
---
Noisy image
---
I really don't care about mobile TBH, the normal game needs top be worked on, but instead they focus on pumping out a mobile version and more cosmetics.
---
I couldn't give less of a shit about it if it's cosmetic, I'd rather support bhvr
---
Uh, they're 100% wrong. That's like saying RS6 isn't a teamwork game.
---
Oh god this just had me think about a spider killer
---
Good point, I was thinking of spine chill and premonition. I wish Pig didn't get buggered arseways with OoO since it's not like she has full move speed crouched.
---
I never have a problem with sound, I don't get close enough/walls seem to block better than gen noise. Except on Haddonfield. Fuck Haddonfield. Can't even stalk on its crap design that's bad for every killer. I rarely crouch and never near a survivor/gen, unless I need to repeatedly to say hi.
---
I play very aggressively, in that I do not go out of my way to not be revealed since stalk doesn't deplete, and seem to do fine against the frequent red ranks that filter down to my green. Some mid-high skill survivors try to remain injured so they can use dead hard but that just means I get slug parties through sound alone that I don't need my power for. But I have no answer for torch saves given shroud is ended on attack.
---
So what? It's part of the game. Getting hooked happens. If you just quit every time that happens you won't get any better. You just ruin the game for the other four players in the match and create much more toxicity in which is something this community doesn't need.
---
Go play Friday the 13th if you can't handle being hooked
---
Aaaaand you got trashtalked in chat for doing that.
---
Per usual, here‚Äôs a [link to his Twitter post](https://twitter.com/athrasill/status/1146817426861854720?s=21)
---
I am playing it and I have had no invite. I am in the UK. Just changed my iphone region to Denmark and used a link I found on the twitter comments from a tweet The dbd mobile team put out.
---
What graphics settings do you play on?
---
I'm guessing you don't play killer much if you think that the only way to camp someone is to face camp them the entire time. Someone who's actually being strategic would hook a survivor between 3 generators that they can patrol. This allows you to patrol gens while also camping the person on the hook.
---
Your inability to make use out of camping doesn't make it a bad tactic.
---
She shouldn‚Äôt have been toxic
---
Legion isnt bad per se, but he is definitely not amazing. He's a really bad killer in the wrong hands, but can be pretty powerful to someone who mains him 24/7. Since his rework, ive noticed its a lot easier to escape legion in general, nor because legion is bad, but because you can actually counter his power now, unlike before he was reworked.
---
&lt;3
---
just pick bond and Prove thyself  ?
---
I will forever Waifu Rin, she was raped by her father, she needs all the support!!üò£ (Also, I know what I said)
---
damn this is some scurry shit
---
But noed get activated when the generators are done, not when the doors are open, at least in ps4
---
I love this. Gj bro.
---
I mean it's a valid strategy. If the killer face camps you the other survivors can get three generators done before you die. You also get points for the Chase and struggling. Also depending on what you did that match you could get your points and just suicide on the hook.
---
Instead it seems like you just quit and call whatever you don't like toxic so that way you don't feel bad about screwing over the other players and costing them items or offerings
---
No she wasn't...?
---
/r/OopsDidntMeanTo
---
It is your fault when you get caught that early. Instead of putting up a good Chase or losing the killer you die and quit. You will never get better if you just quit as soon as things don't get your way or if the killer finds you first.
---
You're incredibly selfish and ruin the game for the other players by doing this BS costing them items offerings and add-ons. Just because you get hooked once early on doesn't mean you won't Escape. I've been camped until the struggle stage at the start of a match and made it out alive.
---
you should re-read what I posted as you obviously skipped or selected what you wanted out of context ;)
---
Everyone you've ever done that to have assumed you were bm'ing.
---
 I'm a big brain Legion main, so I think he's okay
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c90dzz/i_love_well_made_dbd_versions_of_memes_this_aint/
---
Lol something about this meme cracks me up every time
---
Bots would do nothing except maybe improve your aim, you would never get a sense of loops, gen pressure or actual unhooks, just take the L, if 3 gens go ping 2 mins in, oh well see how well you can hit far away trees/objects.
---
Am new and I've spent my time on a little of both and for me I find quick games less enjoyable. 
---
Killers definitely get more bloodpoints. 
---
I struggle as survivor and tend to match against green rank killers most games and inevitably die but still rank up. So my games are pretty quick there lmao.
---
As a killer I don't try to throw the game but I will be kind to people who seem to be struggling even against my noobish self, ie not camping, not downing fresh off hook, giving away exits if I feel they deserved it. That sort of play style seems to have the passive effect of extending the games I've played anyway. 
---
But that what's match making is for right? If it worked.
---
Cause he is
---
He (the guy you replied to) probably fantasises about it.
---
My favorite jumpscare has been Ghostface and I slamming into each other. He was chasing someone through killer shack, and I was trying to run into it to get away from his terror radius. We smacked into each other by the god pallet door, paused to flail, and then parted ways. I ran away and he kept going for the other person. 
---
The best jumpscares are unintentional.
---
Cut them some slack they‚Äôre only indie devs
---
It's a good example of letting the game get to you, you didn't let him get his precious tier 3 basement kill and then you over skilled him (if you get blinded by a flashlight, that close to a wall, it may be you, the killer) so he HAD to get you, I remember being like that early on
---
You probably werwnt. Connection and hitbox ftw.
---
Took me a while
---
pornhub
---
oh yea that makes sense
---
I want her face at 0:20 as a meme.
---
&gt;bitter murmur
---
What it has to do with teleporting? BM only reveals auras after the gen is done and Freddy can't teleport to these gens.
---
qq
---
Solo player here. It does suck cause survivors are your enemy and the killer assumes your swf or is taking the last match out on you. It isn't much fun waiting 6 minutes or longer to get into a match just to be sandbagged, camped, and tunneled to hell and back.
---
I unhook and take a hit to ensure the escape and prevent a tunnel and rarely do I ever get it in return. If Franklin's is on killer then I bring back the item to the hooked survivor if I saw them drop it, that is usually when I get help in return yet that still isn't often.
---
Would be nice if we had a solo option only so killer would hopefully take an easy on the camp and tunnel game.
---
I just saw it today at haddonfield and thought the same thing. I was like, "gib".
---
Look both ways when jumping out the window lol
---
I keep wanting to like try and pick them up lol
---
Easy. It's all a build up to golden freddy from fnaf next dlc
---
wait where did you get the raping part from wtf?
---
Windows of Opporunity should get a buff that shows fake pallets in a red aura
---
Same thing happens to me but as a survivor. Chase music but i‚Äôm not being chased nor am i around the killer.
---
Twitch chat is embarrassing, all the 10yo kids not understanding how talking works, asking the same questions over and over, crying that freddy is OP.  
---
I can't wait to see how they will nerf him to oblivion this time around.
---
It's not like Huntress is dependent on Iridescent Head or Spirit is dependent on Prayer Beads tho.
---
What the fuck dude?
---
I thought the improved chances of rarer items was proven false.
---
dont you guys just hate it when you accidentaly become a god? gosh its so annoying smh, happens to me everytime. does anyone have a nice troom troom lifehack that doesnt even work and probably involves a glue gun so that i can get rid of it.
---
I read this in Trapper's voice from the parody videos
---
at least the chapters are cheaper right?
---
Waking up won't prevent Freddy from hurting you and I imagine there'll be add-ons to make waking up harder.
---
Thats What you‚Äôre doing imo but go on
---
oh god oh fuck, how could we let it escape. the world is gonna end now oh fuck me
---
Keep it for red rank to increase your chances as solo survivor
---
Ranks are not SWF indicator. With long killer queues it's possible to get solos from way higher/lower ranks. Source: I play solo, it's not that uncommon for me to see 5+ rank difference.
---
imagine if the survivors acted like this when they were being carried. 
---
every killer would stop carrying survivors because of this lmao
---
Easter egg
---
at least its not moaning sounds like in identity v
---
being "friendly" as a killer is to adapt your gameplay to the average survivor team skill level.
---
To do that you need to be good first.
---
That pallet would lead somewhere once the door is opened, once the gen is done in the other side
---
she is obviously a 20 rank survivor, who tries to kobey infront of the killer right as they got hooked unless they got decisive or adrenaline
---
Getting 5-gen'd is really sad, but seeing that little scumbag dying on the hook is sooooo worth it &gt;:D
---
It doesn't mean I CAN'T waifu them though.  
---
Also one of them has floating limbs, I don't think regular logic applies much.
---
You don't know that the doors open on the Game map?
---
I play solo. Most of the times, it's not that bad. Yeah, you get clueless players (not from rank 20, and with hundreds of hours), you die on your first hook sometimes. But straight out sandbaggers? Very rare.
---
I did this when the hole was in the map I‚Äôm Freddy‚Äôs map on ptb to test and it tps you to the land then kills you not mid air
---
It's false, it's just such a minimal difference it doesn't really matter
---
As a solo only player, while it's often frustrating, not being able to rely on teammates actually adds some tension to the game. You might get 1 hooked, you might get farmed, or sandbagged. You might loop the killer for 5 minutes without any generators getting finished. But it actually feels more like the horror game it's supposed to feel like. With random, the game doesn't follow a formula like it does when you play SWF. Playing SWF, knowing someone is coming to unhook you with We'll Make It and Borrowed Time removes the tension. Knowing that your teammates are going to be able to loop any killer that isn't Nurse or Spirit makes 80% of games feel too easy.
---
Bumphorn
---
It‚Äôs probably an easter egg. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs one on every map
---
Once the gen is done and the door opens that pallet becomes a forced pallet that the killer would have to break to continue a chance
---
Yeah even I'll admit that sometimes you really do just have to ignore the dumb shit that mad survivors are saying.
---
The quality makes this better
---
it's so cute I love it xD
---
You have serious issues. I‚Äôm not even joking.
---
It is an Easter Egg and some maps also have a Shrimp drawing. Bradham Preschool has it and also The Game. 
---
As for the Golden Toolbox, I've seen them on: 
---
Groaning Storehouse, Gas Heaven, Father Campbell's Chapel, Lampkin Lane, Swamp (not sure which one), Treatment Theatre, Mother's Dwelling, Badham Preschool, The Game, Family Residence and Mount Ormond Resort.
---
Not really no, feels like Your unwilling to admit that this rework is going to make a killer that already strugles even weaker than he already is
---
OH. I wasn't looking that closely. I didn't realize that was a door behind it. That explains how it spawned at all.
---
Its always been like this. Hence the black and red sweater and Quentin instead of the new Nancy because they couldnt get the license to use the old actors. Not really subtle and also Freddy has always been a pedophile.
---
Why would you say there bugged they seem fine to me?
---
Omg no. If you're unhooked next to the killer, he's supposed to hold your hand and walk you to the exit gate to make sure you escape safely. Anything else is [toxic](/intensifies).
---
Have a waifu and get the knaifu!
---
But you‚Äôre forgetting some other negatives to him, or really underplaying them. 
---
He has absolutely no map pressure whatsoever. That to me is his biggest problem. He also gets looped for days, because he eats pallets like it isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs business. He also only gets I believe 45 seconds of exposure. He‚Äôs most likely gonna take so many pallets early game he isn‚Äôt going to get any instant downs from stalking. His power is by no means bad, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything to help out the issues that plague mid-low tier killers. 
---
He honestly shouldn‚Äôt have got the most recent hit in my opinion, because I felt it was primarily brought on because the developers knew in advance that survivors would complain about him, and that speaks leagues for the player base, which this game has one of the crappiest ones I‚Äôve honestly ever seen
---
If he is stalking you, and you break him out, then he already knows where you are.... If he doesn't know where you are, he isn't stalking you, so be smart and don't break him out "just to do it". Do you know what I mean? If you are hidden, he's not stalking you, so why would you counter his power? And again, if he is stalking you, and fails because you countered him, he already knew where you were so it doesn't matter :P think about it.
---
For real. What a fucking hero.
---
You're supposed to break the chase so you can start over fresh with a whole new chase, that'll totally slow the gens down. /s
---
The most reasonable thread about NOED I've seen in a while.
---
I would like to hear what devs have to say about **not** adding a counter to small game. Whats the reasoning behind their decision.
---
I was expecting vommy mommy tbh
---
Then the other survivors come and try to unhook them instead of escaping. Even though you're *right there.*
---
Then you end up with a 3 or 4k instead of your 2k.
---
And then major fucking salt in endgame, like you're supposed to just let them get away or something?
---
&gt;If he is stalking you, and you break him out, then he already knows where you are....
---
Not really true, because otherwise there would be no need for it. There are situations both where he is chasing you and it will give him a clue where you are once the line of sight is broken. There are also situations where you may want to reveal him when he is stalking another survivor. 
---
it is not a case of doing it just to do it, there is just no good time *to* do it.
---
&gt;If you are hidden, he's not stalking you, so why would you counter his power?
---
Because teamates. And it isn't a counter to his power, it is just a separate power you give him. As you say, why would you? You just wouldn't.
---
&gt;if he is stalking you, and fails because you countered him, he already knew where you were so it doesn't matter
---
If it doesn't matter then why give him the bonus? it clearly matters and was added as a buff to being revealed by survivors.
---
Yes, because cosmetics mean nothing, simply don't buy them.
---

I love it
---
Yea it took me a couple watches to realize it also!
---
&gt;He has absolutely no map pressure whatsoever. That to me is his biggest problem. He also gets looped for days, because he eats pallets like it isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs business. 
---
This is fair. Maybe something that should have been tweaked rather than just giving him a win-win power that doesn't make any sense.
---
&gt;He also only gets I believe 45 seconds of exposure. 
---
That is plenty of time to get one hit off, even if you are getting looped. if you spend 45 seconds per hit on survivor you have likely lost the game.
---
&gt;He honestly shouldn‚Äôt have got the most recent hit in my opinion,
---
What was the most recent hit sorry?
---
Yeah the player base unfortunately only speak for themselves and will attempt to bully the devs into thinking one side is hard done by without talking objectively. This happens on both sides and the most upset speak the loudest. Legion was a great example/
---
And killers wonder why theres all that toxic behavior coming from the survivors...
---
Oh god he's in Evil Within Tier 4 https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9ela6/tier_4_evil_within/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
But but BHVR said no plans for flying killer. BHVR wtf?
---
finally some killer that requires brains lol
---
It is a counter but when used properly, and for the trade off of being spotted. I've played him a lot and I can say it doesn't really help, and when it does help, they shouldn't have broken me out and they should just stay hidden. Again if you break line of sight, don't break him out, or break him out before you break line of sight. Also it's not that great so I wouldn't call it a sperate power, but since we are on that subject, Doc has shocking and can spot survivors and has his fake docs and pallets that can give people away, pig has 2 powers, traps and lunge, legion has the same vision and inflicts a bleed out timer, and the new Freddy is gonna have slow traps, teleporting to gens, and invisibility
---
Should show middle finger tbh
---
Supporting them when they're constantly messing things up?
---
Skipping the obvious Monitor and Abuse, Hex Ruin, etc- I love Save the Best For Last. It‚Äôs a Michael perk in of itself, so you‚Äôve already got it covered, but I run it on practically every killer. Once you get all 8 stacks, recovery from successful hits is fast as fuck. The survivors typically don‚Äôt expect you to get back in the chase that quickly, which can make them panic a little. I love it so much.
---
when‚Äôs this fucking amazing, creative and actually somewhat balanced rework coming out?
---
Brenda is adorable. Easily my favorite recurring Scary Movie character.
---
Maybe ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù isn‚Äôt the best term but if you get a good team against a normal M1 killer like wraith without ruin, the games can go unbelievably fast. There‚Äôs so many perks in dead by daylight but yet you feel forced to use perks like ruin because without them you get ‚Äúgen rushed.‚Äù
---
Concept? This just sounds like how the rework actually is?

Thats more bp than you make in an average survivor match.

When your friends tell you she a murdering psycho, but you still love her!
---
Ohhh nice
---
What's a good resource to learn the game? I want to learn how to play and counter each killer. Are there any youtubers who do gameplay analysis/ discussion?
---
Also what's the screen at the start of the match that displays for 2 seconds between the lobby and loading screen?
---
I save them for when I‚Äôm with SWF so I feel like I‚Äôm contributing. 
---
Also when I have a daily I use the good stuff to get it out of the way faster. 
---
Ex: Heal Three Health states = I‚Äôm bringing my best med kit.
---
Sabotage 2  Full Hooks = best tool kit plus the hacksaw add on
---
This is the one time I‚Äôll understand camping and tunneling
---
I don‚Äôt see it in my IOS, just Identity V.
---
I don't think it's so much we killers think doing the objective is toxic (cause it's not) bit it's pretty much if you get a good swf group that can all loop like the gods and use the Chase time effectively to repair gens then they all just get done so fast. It pretty much forces nurse/billy to be played and hex ruin on the more m1 based killers to stand a chance.
---
I always go back for the save in this situation, even if the odds are completely against me - it‚Äôs just basic politeness!
---
Doesn‚Äôt show up for me in the App Store
---
I just got it in my Google cards that it is out. I don't have an iPhone so I can't try it out but I can send you the link to it if you want to check it out. But it seems legit since the developer is actually Behaviour
---
how do i download this? and also whats the size of the app?
---
you cannot hide and you cannot loop (probably exhauston status effects if they step into the blood too, hahahahaha) with map pressure! right now survivor lobbies are 5 seconds killer lobbies are 10 minutes, this will work out well.
---
For everyone that is interested here the link https://apps.apple.com/no/app/dead-by-daylight/id1452289752
---
I don't know if you can download it or do something with it since I don't haveany iOS device
---
Gen rushing in the sense that the devs think 80 sec for a SOLO surv to repair a gen is okay when its like 3 characters in the game that can put out the map pressure to deal with it, which goes hand in hand with which killers are viable at rank 1
---

This is the reason the pig scares the shit out of me
---
Wraith is in the same troubling spot of needing addons to he fun. Windstorm/Swift Hunt Wraith is super fun, but addonless Wraith has no map control or anything to help him in a chase really, so he just gets shit on. All of his other addons are memes compared to that combo.
---
Yes, it's almost as if... there are multiple people with differing opinions.

Very well made

Everyone here is talking about how a rework would lead to leather-face camping more, but nobody is asking the question; Why do leatherfaces tend to camp so much?  Isn't it possible that a REWORK (not a buff, not a nerf, but a mechanical overhaul) could induce a different play-style that doesn't lead to so much "face camping"?
---
i just want to level doctor dude
---
Red Paint Brush was confirmed as making all four survivors start the trial asleep, and skill checks no longer wake you up.
---
I do think that becoming weaker as Freddy successfully kills off survivors feels really weird,  *but damn is it flavorful.* One of the defining aspects of the character is that he was only able to get people if he was remembered and feared. 
---
Dead survivors=no one to remember him, and so his power diminishes. The thing with the gems I feel fits the lore of dbd, as none of the killers can interact with the gems at all when they are done. 
---
All that being said, I tend to favor a balance of fun&gt;viability&gt;flavor, and I could see some of this needing to change. I kind of  hope the PTB will bare out these particular weaknesses as not terrible for sake of feeling right for the character. However, looking at other killers who‚Äôs power really drops of at end game, his early *and mid game* really needs to be a kick in the teeth in order to make up for being so much weaker at the end.  
---
So maybe a change to dead survivors giving him the 15% bonus? That would also fit with his ‚Äúfired up‚Äù perk, except that instead of getting more powerful b/c he‚Äôs failing, he gets more powerful because he‚Äôs succeeding. That change, however, may encourage more tunnling though, so probably not a good idea.
---
He can teleport across the entire map and you think it‚Äôs less map pressure? I mean, damn, do you want him to teleport the survivors to him or something? ü§îü§îü§îü§£üòÇ
---
It used to make anyone who saved anyone from a hook became the obsession.
---
Now it works how it was intended, if the obsession gets unhooked, the person who saved them becomes the new obsession.
---
Most of the nerf ideas target her add ons with the intention of removing extra blinks as well as lowering the impact of Omegablink nurse
---
OP talking like Freddy is good because he killed newbies lmao
---
Can someone please explain?
---
(¬¥„Éª(oo)„ÉªÔΩÄ)
---
Pallet stunning her while she is blinking should immediately stun her IMO. The number of seconds required to burn her with a flashlight should also be dramatically reduced
---
Im waiting for the killers with bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Or player with Samsung Dex.
---
With a 45 second cooldown his teleport is not god tier.
---
Love dead meat
---
Legion is just annoying for survivors because of the nonstop mending. Otherwise he's easily beatable, survivors just don't like to hold Mouse1 to mend, they'd much rather do it on gens 24/7 instead.
---
He did reference doing generators to escape before in a kill count for leatherface lol. Maybe he will see this
---
Well Dwight prefers to kill with his bare hands, not sure about the rest of the survivors.
---
The bouncing really expressed just how immediate the danger was.
---
Why is David hiding Dead Hard in his crotch?
---
5 Nurse mains just downvoted your painfully true comment, LOL.
---
Have my upvote tho
---
Can I link my. Steam. To this?
---
**If you never play survivor, you're never going to get better as killer and vice versa.** You need to know how the other side will think or handle certain loops and map tiles.
---
"enjoy the ban :)"
---
What‚Äôs this?
---
its not really that kind of a horror game
---
Basic game on sale costs 250 rub when purchasing 1100 cells costs 266. It still makes no sense even if it cheaper than in europe/na
---
Ah shit, you got me
---
Both are 110% killers who rely heavily on their powers and any mistake that they make with them will be much more punishing due to your increased speed at the end game.
---
Phasing through a wall/pallet/whatever adds 1 second stun time.
---
It's a solid build, I use it as well, sometimes with Nurse's Calling instead of STBFL or BBQ \^\_\^
---
What? HAHAHAHAHA
---
Tried to get them for almost 2 months now.
---
Maybe we need to wait until 9th and try it in PTB?
---
I thought it was my bitter mummers perk
---
Time that you could just use doing half of a gen, listen i get it, but why not using a perk that helps you not get hit in the first place. Yes finding someone to heal you isn't always convenient, but i mean... you could always just bring a medkit as first of all you probably only get 1-2 SC heals a game, might as well bring a brown medkit or... Pharmacy(yes this is a joke, but i do think pharmacy is better)
---
&gt;I don't think it's BM to teabag
---
Well everyone else does so..
---
I‚Äôm quite new I‚Äôve only had it a month but I have both so yours could be bugged, hope you get them tho
---
A good survivor can loop a killer for literal minutes. The devs believe that one survivor should be able to provide a decent challenge for a killer, rather than the challenge coming from all four survivors working together, doing their own thing, all at the same time. Looping shouldn‚Äôt be about ‚Äúlosing the killer‚Äù it should be about wasting as much time as possible so that your teammates can do gens. And in that regard, the one and only problem with looping is that if a survivor is good enough, they can waste entire minutes of the killer‚Äôs time, which is way too much considering how quickly gens get done.
---
Thinking if your good it's still worth it to do it, its just way more punishing to fail. She's supposed to be a hard killer, make it more risk for the reward.
---
Just a suggestion, what's yours?
---
Is anyone?
---
I NEEEEEEED IT
---
The stats that they gave for rework Freddy
---
EU/NA always expensive for some reason I'm sure steam balance their prices to the countries that buy games a lot since I heard in Russia most of the people don't spend money on video games they hack it or something. other guy told me because Russians don't get paid a lot that's why it is cheap. but I'm from Saudi Arabia and in SA steam store is way cheaper than EU like a lot it is almost close to RU. .-. it is DISGUSTINGLY unfair
---
Yes, but only if the survivors they are playing against are not playing properly.
---
Its called having an different opinion
---
What ppatform
---
You say it isn‚Äôt much of a help but that isn‚Äôt my point. It is still a help, as if they have just wrapped up ghostface in bubblewrap and said ‚ÄúHere are your main abilities, but if that goes wrong have this and this. It makes no sense and results in the character being played less carefully. It just doesn't add up to me..
---
&gt; Let's say you're playing the basic 2blink nurse, you should have 1 spare charge so 3 max charges.
---
So I can use additional blink add-on and play her like a normal 2 blink Nurse?
---
For me pallet stun working and the removal of extra blinks would be already enough. I think the main problem with the nurse is something that every killer has, the fucking broken hitboxes, and since she can blink her lounge is heavily affected by this problem.
---
Xbox one but i have put in over 100hours in that time
---
One can dream.
---
It gives you an indication of their location after they reveal you for no reason whatsovever, which assists the killer. People are just saying well its not *that* helpful. My point is it defeats the purpose of his skill and rewards him for messing up.
---
BVHR worked with another company to create a mobile version of dbd called "Identity V" and it has a spider killer and she is fun she can put up a web in doors or windows or areas like trip wires and it slows the survivors and tells the killer that someone triggered her web it's cool
---
Yes cause why fear the killer in a horror game? If you think getting insta-downed is boring then you just give up too easily. For me, instadowns and moris make optimal routing and jukes matter more and heighten the intensity of chases. Without them, this game boils down to: hold M1 &gt; loop killer &gt; yawn &gt; repeat
---
&gt;!I play survivor and wish killers were stronger because DBD would actually feel like an exciting horror game.!&lt;
---
If you read her like Bizzaro in the superman comics, the meme still makes sense :&gt;
---
310 downvotes in itself is quite an achievement, but the gold is mindblowing.
---
Thanks, fam! Really appreciate the time you took to tell me these. Gonna remember these. Guess I'll start playing survivor more. Lol
---
Ah that explains a lot
---
I agree she is too OP and she should get a nerf, but i don't think DCing is the solution.
---
the longer i watch the video the better it sounds actually. I still think there should be no red stain and maybe make it so the survivors get exposed in the dream world...or have a timer in the dream world where if they dont get out they become exposed...some mix of Ghostface/Plague mechanics.
---
*Unzips pants*
---
As a gf main as of  2 weeks ago gf prides himself on scaring the shit out of you so I recommend hiding in a corner until the hatch opens
---
Is That Nurse?
---
I play both and it looks like this guy only plays killer. I'm curious though, what rank?
---
Its easy to dodge one blink though, taking away her other blinks would drop her down to like mid-tier.
---
No no only 2 blinks, as her default kit
---
Why would you not run Dead Hard with No Mither?
---
Both were rank 4, althought im boosted as i usually only play with friends who don't play as much as me
---
I've had a few games that we all ended up standing still cause we kept rubber banding back to where we started. I was ok until the ghostface teabagged me. Had to ask him if the hamster powering his router fell off it's wheel...he said it was us lagging, not him. Hahahaha ok buddy
---
Oh so just changing her add-ons, yeah I can get behind that.
---
Lol it does though. Don't tunnel and you won't be hit with DS. There's no situation where tunneling isn't bm. I can tell you want someone to agree with you on that but it's not going to be me babykiller. Also almost every job is customer service on some level. I used that word to stay anonymous. I haven't worked retail or anything similar in years so all this dribble about my job position are just making you look like a joke. You'd know that if you weren't some pathetic freeloader hiding in his mom's basement. You can't play the game or insult me right. I've seen little kids play the game better than you. So what kind of things can you do right loser?
---
And he's only now complaing about looping? Has he not heard of spirit fury + enduring?
---
Yea, i srsly don't understand his mindset lol
---
Fuck me. Just imagine a spider-type killer.
---
make make range add-ons let you charge blink for longer and not affect the non-max charged blinks (currently it makes the same amount of charge take you further, but take as long, which effectively gives you charge speed and blink speed)
---
set a minimal blink time of 1 second. Currently it's set to 0s at 0% and 2s at 100%. I'd change that to 1s at 0% and 2s at 100%
---
I kinda agree. As a Killer, I FEAR the survivors, not the opposite, really. Sometimes I feel so helpless that its just boring and unfun. Imho the whole game needs to be remade. Objective and mechanics. Or create another game mode idk
---
Don't respect pallets, charge on through and you'll be surprised at the hits you can get. Dead Hard is a near constant so if right on someone's ass, wait a second to see if they use it then down them. No matter how good you get, there are just some games where you'll get your shit pushed in, don't get pissy. Face walls when picking survivors up if someone has a flashlight. Play both sides
---
A DC can fuck up the match for everyone and waste a lot of time, especially for killer with loading queues. A large bonus ensures everyone sticks around and not DC as well
---
as a r20 surviror who put points into Meg because she was my first daily... 100% right, completely. r20 matches are heavily survivor leaning, but I guess that doesn't matter when it'll fuck me in the long run.
---
Can you help me? I cant seem to download it not even with a vpn
---
Unless of course the game screws it up.
---
That looping infuriates me damn if they teabag I am going to gut them so bad but yeah that's what they are supposed to do its up to the killer to compose himself and switch his brain back on find sombodey else
---
Why tho?
---
Can you explain it to me how it works? I tried with a vpn but it doesnt work. I have an Android
---
Tbh I can see it workig. Each episode is an killer with a set of characters.
---
After I hook the last person and the entity is summoned, I go kick gens and break pallets. As trapper, you can spam traps for extra bloodpoints. If there's nothing left to do, just walk far away from the hook. No reason to rub it in that they lost; that just radiates small dick energy.
---
There are some meme formats that are simply funny to look at.
---
They need to change his stun sounds immediately
---
he melted my heart all the way....
---
Middle school me thought that was the beginning and the end of micro-transactions. Middle school me didn‚Äôt know shit.
---
Thank you üò≠üíñ ily hopefully I can doodle some more this weekend
---
I guess it‚Äôs all going to be dependent on how frequent survivors wake themselves up during the early/mid game. Being able to kill off a survivor early may impact your mid game more because you lose that cdr of your power but the fact that you have less people to deal with would kinda offset that unless you‚Äôre still getting ran around by other survivors. Plus once you get down to 1-2 gens remaining, you may not even need to teleport as much unless you‚Äôre still spread out or your shares are in wonky places. 
---
Overall I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be worse for wear. The few weeks after his release we will need to see how he fares, but I think a solid gen-based info build will be stupid strong on him just because of how much information you can glean from perks like thrilling Tremors or surveillance and Discordance.
---
I had the same bug as far as being unable to dead hard or selfcare, if anyone else tried to heal me the bar never filled up so they just healed me forever until they gave up.
---
I could feel the cringe from the left guy at 22:20 through the screen, poor bastard lmao
---
Doing gens, you?
---
No, if you play 3blink nurse you have 4 charges. The more blinks you play with, the more punishing it'll get if you mess up. You blink 3 times, you still have your extra charge NOT on cd, and 3 ON cd. You wait 10 seconds, you can blink 3 times again, but if you mess those 3 blinks up, you gotta wait 15 seconds to be able to triple blink again. I think that sounds fair.
---
Check exilio on yt he posted video
---
IMO they way games are these days 10$ per skin is the best deal around. 90% of other games would have just added ballerina feng to the loot boxes making it so that you could spend 60$ and not get what you want.
---
Maybe not the stun sounds, but definitely the "stepped in my own trap" sounds at LEAST. üòÇ
---
I don't know how a killer can be on the level of Clown AND Doctor when Clown is high mid-tier/low high-tier and Doctor is garbage tier
---
It rewards him for the survivors messing up. If they choose to break him out, even thou they are hidden and he doesn't know where they are, that's a bad play, and in return he gets 1 second of a vision on that survivor. If ghost face messes up and starts chasing before he has fully exposed a survivor then the survivor can break him out without any reprocussion because that effect does nothing mid chase. Ghost Faces ability is a good example of "just because you can, doesn't mean you should". Just because a survivor can break him out of his ability, doesn't mean it's always in their best interest, and that's the way it should be.
---
can you imagine hearing that fuckin screech from across the map and KNOWING why it happened lmao
---
Except the "ribbons" floating from his arms.
---
BlESS I'd laugh hysterically every mf time
---
I remember one game against a trapper on Lerys, he trapped up the basement stairs and then was trying to carry me down and stepped in one of his traps... dude stood there for a second and then DCd lmao
---
"The whole game needs to be remade" bruh just play a different game and you get your wish
---
Also, similar backstory!
---
I SLASH THE LAST SURVIVOR ON THE HOOK JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND I DIDNT KNO PPL SAW IT AS A DICK MOVE
---
Well yeah, but that‚Äôs like Entity-fashion.
---
Cant say I wouldnt DC about that myself, that's a big ole Ouch. üòÇ I play card games (mostly yugioh) on my phone and one time I was vs my boyfriend and I made a complete Mistake and I was like
---
Pls lemme quit. Pls.
---
Really? I struggle a lot against him. His power doesn't slow him down like I tought, so he can hit me pretty easy. Why does he uck exactly?
---
It‚Äôs such a mood. I‚Äôve never played much trapper so I‚Äôve never experienced the shame of stepping in my own trap, but I just love that that‚Äôs even a function like why did they decide he could be stunned by his own trap lmao also I used to love yugioh mm
---
That‚Äôs pretty crazy how much easier it is to track people without all the usual clutter on the floor. 
---
Thanks for posting this, I‚Äôve been waiting to see killer footage on mobile &lt;3
---
genuinely hope you choke
---
Why aren't you?
---
Baby rage
---
His mindset is that everyone must play the way he wants or they are entitled. Sounds like entitlement doesnt describe the survivors though...
---
It could be a pretty awesome thing, maybe like a hunger games type of series, without Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and future licensed killers.  And it‚Äôs all about getting those god damn generators
---
Even after standing from crouched, she still has no terror radius or red stain for a short time.

No reason for toxic behavior from either side, js.

Are you trying to download from Google Play? I also cannot access the Google Play link, so I just downloaded it from here [https://godisagamer.vip/dead-by-daylight-apk/](https://godisagamer.vip/dead-by-daylight-apk/), using the mediafire links. Sideload the app and put the data into android/obb. No VPN or pre-registration needed as I'm able to play without both.
---
Why would I blink 3rd time if I only want 2? With 4 charges it's like 99% of the time I'd have 2 non on cd. And if that would not be enough, there's a 4 and 5 blink builds, right?
---
For a player like me, who plays Nurse without add-ons, your proposal wouldn't change a thing.
---
Bless, I played maneater bug face up and wanted to Die
---
But honestly the drawbacks killers get are a lot more harsh, but definitely can be comedic in the right context! Probably just not for the killer-player, though, unless they know what it's like to observe the Shame. üòÇ
---
I have a terrible time with my tracking, personally. My boyfriend plays DBD and more killer than I do, so when I'm playing piggy as i do I'll have 2 survivors run right under my nose and be flicking my camera back n forth like 
---
WHAT
---
WHERE
---
Until finally someone is dumb enough to be obvious enough FOR me to see them. It also doesnt help I have poor eyesight, so I need my glasses and to sit close to the tv. xD 
---
In short; I'll prolly never play trapper. At least not with the black goo traps, because I cant see them for crap anyway!
---
Fuck the hag
---
A bunch of people downvoted like every comment for some reason?
---
David (other character) was coming up the stairs and crouch spamming next to the streamer, letting her know something is going on. Then the streamer follow David through the window and the streamer got confused (why did he want me to go here?). Seconds later the Pig (crouching killer with no terror radius) comes out of the window. So david saved the streamers ass by telling her to get outta there
---
name checks out
---
There are way more survivors though, that's why. Just the nature of an asymmetrical game.

I would say so because David's pitiful moaning is loud as fuck, but at yellow ranks kindred may save you from dying on the first hook.

Well he does have to blood puddles that might help a bit. Not when the survivor is awake, of course.

Ah that‚Äôs the people in these comment sections, green ranks and lower who have no game sense and complain when shit isn‚Äôt handed to them, playing survivor isn‚Äôt always easy, and when you go against a killer that plays like an ass hole, pupping and just being an asshole in general, yea the survivors are going to shit talk you.

Um.. You know they removed hid sound right?
---
It was confirmed on the fourms
---
Did you know he also got some buffs and mostly bug fixes
---
And how do you know he won't be good. Why would every killer have to play the same
---
That sounds great to me
---
Because these powers can be way stronger than the other killers in the right hands. The ability to apply the broken status effect to the survivors while also making them louder and unable to hide in lockers? That‚Äôs pretty fucking strong. 
---
The ability to near-instantly apply the exposed status effect whenever you want (with a decent cooldown) even at the very beginning of the game, while also having some of the strongest mindgame capabilities? That‚Äôs really strong. 
---
Old freddy was even strong, which I think people are starting to see now. A few people tried him and didn‚Äôt adjust their playstyle and called him shit and everyone agreed, but now that he‚Äôs going to be changed, more people are seeing his capabilities. The ability to heavily slow down survivors action speeds, while also being able to see them outside of your terror radius? The ability also, in many situations, forces the survivor to fail a skill check, showing you their location anyway? Paired with an ‚Äúall-seeing build‚Äù and working to get as many asleep as quickly as you can, Freddy can be insanely strong. The new rework freddy is going to be strong as well; he‚Äôs able to hit anyone regardless of whether they‚Äôre asleep or not, and being able to teleport is going to be strong. The older killers (save for nurse and hillbilly) had base powers that weren‚Äôt insanely powerful and mainly relied on walking forward and swinging your weapon.  As their developing abilities have evolved and they‚Äôre able to create newer and more mechanically involved abilities, they‚Äôre doing so, and these abilities are very strong and need to be balanced some way.

&gt;If they choose to break him out, even thou they are hidden and he doesn't know where they are, that's a bad pla
---
It shouldn't be. IF he gets revealed. THAT is a bad play for the killer. It should have nothing to do with the survivors. 
---
It does do something mid chase. it keeps a track on the survivor. So he can break line of sight for whatever reason and still know where they are.
---
&gt;Ghost Faces ability is a good example of "just because you can, doesn't mean you should". Just because a survivor can break him out of his ability, doesn't mean it's always in their best interest, and that's the way it should be.
---
I understand your point, but it is still backwards thinking on the matter.
---
It is currently never in their best interest to break him out. 
---
If he is stalking and you catch him - the chase commences and he gets extra vision on you.
---
If he is stalking and exposes you - the chase commences and you're fucked.
---
It is just not in the survivors interests to expose him. It is in the survivors interests to stay hidden at all costs and not look at him. It doesn't make sense imo - I have an open mind, but nobody has addressed the points I have made.
---
Were you already dead or were you the killer and just felt bad for gen guy?

New guy was so nervous, I feel bad for him. Hopefully he feels more comfortable on camera in the future.
---
I have only ever run into a single killer who runs this perk and it got me killed cuz I wanted the chest :(
---
He should‚Äôve had a mori where he rips out a survivors spine like the predator.
---
Yeah but if you play killer and see the scratch marks won't you be better at survivor because of it? 
---
You might already be good but everyone can get better
---
When I first heard about Thrilling Tremors I thought it would be pretty decent. Then I saw it has a cooldown and in practice it sucks donkey balls because of it.
---
I don't think you understand how his power works. It only gives vision of the survivor for 1 second, it's a blink on the screen. It's not like he continues to see you as you duck behind a tree. If you spot him after he spots you, that's it. He isn't getting any extra vision. Let's say GF spots a survivor on a gen, that survivor breaks him out, the area around the gen blinks, and that's it. You could then run and hide and he has no vision of you. He has to wait for his power to recharge again. Let's say that same chase continues and he gets his power again, if he sees the survivor, the survivor can break him out again, there is a 1 second blink and that's It, they could then break line of sight and he doesn't get extra vision. Likewise another survivor can break him out for the person running, and he either has to stop the chase to spin and find that blink in 1 second or ignore it and continue chase. If he's broken out of It, that's It, he doesn't continue to get vision after. So it's definitely in a survivors best interest to look at him as soon as the chase starts, and any time after that the survivor can hide and he doesn't have vision on that until his power is up again. And the survivor, if hidden can stay hidden, if they aren't they can just break him out and wait 1 second and then hide

---
Ironically, her face doesn't look like a killer in this picture.
---
Well I'm finally at a point where I have most of the worthwhile perks teachable now, so I have fun with both sides, but I'm definitely far better on survivor for some reason.  It used to be exactly the opposite for me, which is somewhat odd considering how much more powerful survivors used to be.  I think most of it has come from game knowledge though.
---
It's BAD MANNERS you don't be a bitch and BM!
---
It's a series of addons, so the garden rake series will all give you fake pallets but probably with a bonus the higher the rarity.
---
This is true.
---
Best expletive ever :D
---
I agree, personally I don't think murder should be looked down upon but everytime I bring it up, the rest of the world gets all up in arms, not sure why
---
Or, you know, you could go save. If you're worried about being found, the killer isn't camping and therefore you're the asshole.
---
If he gets his stalk off before a chase starts, his power being on a cooldown doesn't matter.
---
Being able to sometimes end a chase immediatly is a lot better then never being able to.
---
"He is speaking the language of gods"
---
No, I say this because one perk would completely nullify half his entire power and there'd be no reason to wake up.

I wouldn‚Äôt list Remember Me as fun. It‚Äôs just token stacking and 30 seconds was a bit overkill. 16 seconds extra is still plenty of time to stop your non-obsession unless they‚Äôre running Wake Up And Spine Chill.  
---
Fire Up is just Brutal Strength and requires other perks to be noticeable. It‚Äôs really meh and mediocre like I said. It‚Äôs hard to make it do anything else without either making it a mashup of 2-3 other perks but better. If it did anything else it may lead to broken interaction with other support perks. 
---
Blood Warden is powerful in its setup but feeds on altruism. It requires more set-up and potential but it‚Äôs of the ‚Äúwhen it works you win‚Äù kinda perks. 
---
Like with many perks, just buffing them leads to unintended power creep or in other killers kits becomes a carrying tool and the whole of our perks need to be redone and changed anyway so starting somewhere would be good to see if they could actually need to be changed/removed/buffed.
---
It's often worth the try though. A good save with some bodyblocking, borrowed time plays, and so and so. It's a huge risk and must be tried only within reasonable parameters (no NOED, close enough from an open gate, at least two survivors for the save, etc.), but when it pays off, major nerdgasm for outplaying a camper.
---
Survivors on why gen rushing in't a thing : "Gens are our only objective."
---
Survivors on why NOED is OP : "Survivors have much more important things to do like going for saves, completing gens, healing teammates, looping killers, and looking for gens and/or teammates than completing totems."

Thonking
---
What I like to do is walk around the map and look for any pallets or maybe even the hatch for extra points.
---
Ehhhh. I wouldn't say it's easier to wake up now. I'd say it's simply more accessible.
---
Freddy only has to hit you once to sleep you. And you can't be woken up by an ally unless you and the ally are fully healed. You only get one alarm a match and failing skill checks gives Freddy info.
---
If the Freddy player has good map knowledge and makes good use of that with his better map presence he should be killing people early game rather well.
---
It's late game that hill suffer the most since closing the hatch removes his teleport and he's CD is longer the less people are asleep.

Sometimes you have to go for the hatch man

If you have bill's teachables on other characters, they'll most likely stay there but you may have to level up bill to get his teachables onto characters that don't have them once the patch rolls out

Popped on last night and got an update, then as killer I couldn't see generators or hooks, and my hatchets kept changing numbers.
---
Ya know what? I don‚Äôt care. Haha, they lost their items, haha. My fun officially matters more than there‚Äôs now and you can‚Äôt tell me otherwise without me shrugging it off!
---
Speculation: If you have the perks on your characters no. If you prestige/level after bill releases yes.
---
So if you've 100% your survivors you'll have to get bill to 40 to get them on the Chapter 13 survivor.

David about to Dead Hard Freddy's ass... or at least he thinks he is.

Actually cried at this, I‚Äôm so passionate about Left 4 Dead, I played it for years on Xbox 360, I even have tattoos of the original 4 survivors lobby icons on me, I was agoraphobic for 4 years, and I became very attached to these characters they are very special to me, I‚Äôm SO fucking happy I get to play as Bill again, I‚Äôm never going to play as anyone else.

oh wow. my dumbass only now noticed wraith chilling in the back

Could always have looked for the hatch.

Not to mention the more people are asleep the faster his teleport ability recharges

clown's there too

I never see scratch marks. I occasionally see these orange lines on the ground during endgame but that‚Äôs it.

Hard to play as, you‚Äôve got to have good ears, when your phasing all you‚Äôve got to go on is starch marks or the sounds of survivors whimpering in pain.

I just came back to dbd so I dont really get this. can someone explain the joke to me?

Dude I asked what the fuck scratch marks look like. Don‚Äôt change the topic.

I had a game after rank reset where infinite tier 3 hit before i even found the first gen

now i'm twice the dumbass

He was NOT! Freddy was a child MURDERER, but the reboot changed him to be a molestor. I fairly recently watched through the whole series explicitly so I could be up on my slasher lore. I'm glad he now actually has a "dream" ability, though. Reboot Freddy did every kill with his glove, which was a huge let-down.

The ones Wes Craven directed are the best three, BTW. At least in terms of plot.

WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THESE 3 MAN LOBBY BOTTLENECKS, MY KILLER LOBBY FILLS 3 FUCKN SPOTS THEN 4TH SPOT IS AVOIDED LIKE THE PLAGUE (LOL)  WTF! MY SPIRIT LOBBY FILLED 3 SPOTS, THEY WAIT 5MINS LEAVE, 3 NEW PPL FILL LOBBY WAIT 5 MINS,.... LEAVE, I UNDERSTAND, I DONT WAIT IN LOBBIES EITHER AS SURVIVOR. FILL THE 4TH SPOT YOU MOTHERFUCKERS LOL
---
Well, you can slam a door open, but that would be a loud noise. And the Killer can, as well.
---
I like that it's Tapp and Ash saying "cool motive, still murde" , it's in character
---
Her add ons other then the ones that give her extra blinks are basically useless.

Fun fact; saying something is a joke doesn't make it A) harmless and B) funny
---
Lots of scumbags say terrible shit and if it's poorly recieved then *suddenly* it's a joke
---
Since 3.0.2, survivor auras occlude gen auras in black, so basically you can see them when they are between you and a gen. They don't have to be near it. Just between you and the gen.
---
Same goes for hooks, doctor illusions (pallets, doctors etc.) As a killer, many times I have found people, by just looking at gens and see them urban evade across it, giving away their positions. Also when a gen is done, or sacrifice is made, the vfx it creates somehow highlights survivors, if you look at one through it, as if you had BBQ or Nurse's. It's super broken right now. I can only confirm for PS4.
---
honestly the only reason i wasn't gonna buy the switch version was because bill wasn't going to be there. guess that's problem solved
---
i am officially a bill main now.
---
**BILL BILL BILL BILL**
---
not like the killer knows what perks you have....
---
I agree, Huntress has a ton of really good headpieces. I like to run the Halloween body and weapon with whatever headpiece I'm feeling.
---
In order for a tombstone Myers to mori you, the survivor must be standing. Instead of standing survivors can hide in lockers so they wont be mori'd and killers can only either wait it out or grab and drop. The Myers in the video is waiting it out and the survivor seems to be cocky.
---
My guess is everyone played for a while for that 2x XP and 3 year event, like I was seeing all kinds of killers and survivors out, and are all sorts burnt out, so the playerbase went down for a bit, give it some time it should be fine, cuz it's not really a technical issue, well, not everytime
---
She‚Äôs meant to be slow. That‚Äôs why she has to blink to catch up
---
Oi Mate, didn't I Say That?
---
Celebrate good times COME ON!!!!  Let's CELEBRATE!!!
---
Tbh i found it even more annoying when survivors hide then when they loop id rather have a good chase then try to find a bledette in the corner of the map
---
Btw that guy is an idiot he has a problem with survivors trying to you know SURVIVE
---
No, IMPOSSIBLE
---
Okay, but you see how salty all of that sounds. 
---
"You should deliberately play spitefully and doing so is rewarded by penalizing everyone."
---
I do like that there are unhook-triggered Perks that implicitly discourage tunnelling, but if any players are led to have a mindset that comes across as so contemptuous, that's a flaw with the game design. I'd say ideally, Killers should be thinking about their own BP, not a need to eliminate players rapidly or harm their scores (toxicity notwithstanding).
---
Do we get the cosmetics tho!?!? Zoey-Meg and Daddy Jake!!!
---
They do. It has been tested. We'll Make It!'s description means it won't stack with itself.
---
 had the exact same thing as you when I started. They are bright orange lines that spawn across the ground and walls near survivors who are running. Are you by chance color blind? I am and I didn't notice them for the longest time.
---
Here is the best picture of them I could find in 5mins, you can see them on the side of the tires: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1dwfO9p2Ruk/maxresdefault.jpg

Bro, me too

Holy Shit

OMG!!! Im excited for Meg's pink sweater üò≠

She's hard to play but i think she is what the nurse should have been. She is anti-looping but not "broken".
---
even though youre wrong, i really wish you were right lol
---
ahh thanks
---
Yeah sure, you can have the opinion that the word 'cunt' is not offensive but if you call a women that in public don't be surprised why there is backlash
---
Bill has cosmetics?
---
They told me theyll give a "generous" amount of Bloodpoints to compensate. Should i spend the ones i have now or will it go over 1 mil
---
I had a match yesterday. Killer slugged me after all gens finished then went to the exit gates. The other survivors stayed there until the last second so the hatch didn't open until I was being killed by the entity. 
---
The next match was the same, but this time the killer closed the hatch in front of me then the timer ran out
---
Got it. The Bloodpoint bonus is not really worth it either I'm guessing?

The left 4 dead cosmetics.
---
That's a good way to do it! Huntress has had some of my most beloved cosmetics thus far. C : if the amanda skins go over well, I'd be excited to see more outfits on licenced killers!
---
I'm a rank 2 spirit main so I may be a little biased, but she's a total blast with one of the highest skill ceilings in the game. She has crazy map pressure and mindgame potential with a power that allows you to end chases extremely fast if used correctly. It takes some getting used to using your ears and predicting where people will go, but once you get adjusted to it she's one of the most rewarding killers in the game. 10/10 would WAH again
---
Little red marks all over the ground and walls that survivors run by
---
It's literally my meme, I made it for my Insta account. Do a tiny bit of research next time, and you'll maybe see that.
---
Also you literally got mad over a joke that you didn't find funny, Ok? And why is that important? So you didn't find it funny so what. It is a joke not a dick, don't take it so hard.
---
I'd say sprint burst is good because it lets you run away from hook faster after getting unhooked.
---
DS is an obvious one.
---
Iron will helps.
---
Except Quentin would probably end up looking worse, knowing how Netflix adaptations are like
---
Nope. I play console and we don‚Äôt have him yet.
---
Black Splinter = Myers
---
Muddy Splinter = Hag
---
Shock Splinter = Doctor 
---
Bone Splinter = Leatherface
---
Smoking Splinter = Freddy
---
Glass Splinter = Pig
---
And you'll find out what scratch marks look like if you play killer it's not changing topic so stop being defensive,
---
Also scratch marks look like bright red scratches everywhere
---
He was a PC exclusive.
---
We still got his perks however they were put into the universal perk pool  that's available to everybody like resilience and this isn't happening.
---
Also their icons were changed to reflect they're universal status so they were just random people instead of specific survivors.
---
Honestly the only change I could see this doing to PC is that bill's perks will probably now enter 
---
 shrine rotation.
---
A large bonus for quitting is more incentive to quit, the way I read it?
---
He was an exclusive valve/steam character, his perks where apart of the natural perk pool, so it‚Äôll be interesting to see if they now make them teachables.
---
Adorable!! 99999999/10! I love seeing your art pop up around here! :&gt;
---
Err that‚Äôs not Megs, it‚Äôs Zoey‚Äôs and it‚Äôs red damn it !
---
Dude pallet vaccume was the shit
---
Ok with some searching here is a better example: https://imgur.com/a/IWomslz
---
You can see there are orange lines all over the ground behind the claudette. They're a bit easier to see on this map.
---
I'M RUNNING HEAD ON AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK, I'M SORRY!
---
A bonus for everyone in the match except the DC guy, obviously this wouldn‚Äôt count for SWF groups
---
Except this time you can see that it is just a joke, you seem like you have some kind of axe to grind against, People you preceive to be scumbags. When it is just probably a bad joke which is not a crime brother.
---
No way they take perks away from players.  You'll be good.
---
You console babies happy now?
---
Kinda dumb imho. Its not like L4D is exclusive to PC
---
And free too! Yay!
---
Sure caption god
---
His rework will make him feel like Freddy Krueger from the movies. As a survivor the difference between reality and a dream will blur, and his mind games will make him the nightmare he is supposed to be :)
---
Just going by what someone said here somewhere recently. They claimed that the original data mined official banner showing all the upcoming skins had numbers in the corner of each pic and that Feng was 1, Pig leather outfit was 2, Dwight 3 and the other Pig skin had a 4. 
---
No idea if they were legit or not
---
So there are video games in the entity's realm? Sign me the fuck up
---
Cursed image
---
Okay?  More like O-Kay.
---
You can easily spot the nervous one just by looking at how they're sitting
---
Yup, I had the exact same problem except I joined when the game was first released so there were no tutorials or anything. I kept on hearing people talk about scratch marks and had no idea what they were.
---
that guy was using object of obsession, it's a Laurie teachable
---
Don't forget NOED also gives them movement speed that can only be balanced out with Hope, and no one runs that... That movement speed buff is also terrifying even if it wasn't an instant-down perk.
---
Remove sheltered woods for survivors and I‚Äôd call it fair
---
What he's saying is the snares have more use cases, while the fake pallets have better use cases
---
I have never seen a muddy splinter in my life
---
Ask her for tit pics

Cleanse totems.

I don't think I have 300 ping, my camera is broken so my photos are shit üòÇ
---
Freddy rework is in PTB on Tuesday so probably about 2 weeks from then?
---
Wait....console never got Bill?
---
Well what I thought in my head was that I was telling you is how to find out what they look like and then I guess I went off topic and told you that you can learn other things by playing killer too.
---
that is not what he's saying at all, he just has no idea what he's talking about.
---
While yes it is hard to trap loop, it isn't impossible there are anfew place where when turning a corner it is for survivors hard to see the trap before they turn the corner. You just need to find those specific spots and you're iridescent
---
The doctor? What?
---
Damn, this is complicated. It sounds like they tried to give Freddy a little bit of every killer's powers...
---
911 what's your emergency?
---
Why does everything have to be on mobile üò©üôÑ
---
Sad we'll never get classic freddy
---
They retired the non licensed killers splinters.
---
Everyone I find puppy guards or is God tier sweaty
---
I don‚Äôt recall seeing scratch marks in the tutorial either.
---
I can't quite figure if I'll be able to play as him further or if he'll be too different and require massive re-learning. Or not. Some of this sounds fun and others don't. Full character rework. 
---
Can we get Robert Englund face as an alternate with this?
---
New decisive strike has always been like that. It‚Äôs the same if your wiggle bar reaches 100% or even flashlight saves. 
---
If the killer is in the vicinity of the hooking promp you‚Äôre fucked unless the killer is a moron.
---
You literally *JUST* posted whining about SWF then turn around and call console users babies....
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9hdl1/stop_fucking_giving_me_swfs_of_4_people/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
if they are fine with strong killers then whyd they freak over gf?
---
Then they successfully save the teammate, and the killer DCs as all 4 of you are about to leave and complains on the reddit saying "just leave and stop being toxic"
---
That's extremely bad luck did you piss off a witch or something ?
---
Didn‚Äôt even say what they looked like mate keep ya big tunnel-worthy booty in check (referencing that survivor female with the strangely large ass)
---
Traps don't need to catch people to be effective. Run speed setting add ons and a extra trap bag and place them mid chase. This practically shuts down the entire loop before you've even started running around it as they have no time to disarm and have to run somewhere else.
---
Bill only has his normal clothes and his prestige. However, in the Left Behind DLC, Dwight, Meg, Claudette, and Jake each got their own cosmetic outfit based off of a character in the game.
---
This post is mostly better than my summary.  So I shall give you an up vote.
---
The close ones are the worst! I played a match last night where I ended up getting slugged. The killer left me to chase my buddy. I crawled over to the hatch but bled out ... I also didn‚Äôt bleed out fast enough for my buddy to make it over towards me and use the hatch -\(-.-)/-
---
no because it wasn‚Äôt OoO it was just a small white border of the player
---
Come on man, why you gotta be all condescending like that?
---
But yes, I think I can speak for all console players and say we are very excited for him to finally hit our systems :)
---
Can't tell if snarky or serious
---
If they add Ellis or Coach from Left 4 Dead 2, I'll do the same.
---
Sigh, I hate when survivors are scared to play.
---
Do console players get to keep the three perks as base perks or will they become teachable?
---
Awe spoopy cutie Nea
---
Or 1 second if they dead hard into a tree
---
When I started there was only MacMillan, auto haven and cold wind, so there was a very good chance of getting a farm map, sometimes I thought it was just hay or something.
---
I installed it &amp; my account switched back just fine.
---
So random but he was just announced to be coming to console.
---
The cam quality just makes it better because it looks like found footage
---
&gt; I'm a big fan of Premonition. 
---
I don't see how premonition helps anything once you are being tunneled. It only helps not get targeted in the first place.
---
Not sure nothing was said about his perks in the official post
---
Will he be free?
---
Huh. today I learned.......
---
You can't brainlessly just loop a spirit, you have to run from her and play some mindgames with her and thats already hard enough for you to DC? LOL
---
Why green DS?
---
graphics seems to keep up with the game's aesthetic at least. now when can we get Potato Mode on the main game?
---
Every map has them, they are just easter eggs. There should be like an achievement or something for like emote pointing at them or something, but eh. Whacha gonna do
---
stop crying about bnp, it's nerfed to oblivion, especially compared to the red killer addons....
---
So the idea is you need to keep him in a certain area of your screen, that being the center. You also need to see enough of his model to do this. I think the number is 80% but I'm not sure on that. With that said, it will be harder to reveal him while he's leaning.
---
He also has a limited detection range which can be lowered with specific add-ons, so revealing one Ghostface won't necessarily be the exact same as revealing another Ghostface.
---
It's a little bit tricky sometimes, but it's generally pretty consistent.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can link account yet. Also for some reason both jake and wraith are locked.
---
Pinkish red üòà

i never met rank 20 without perk (except my dumb friends)
---
Please give us Bill cosmetics its all I want please please please.
---
So jokes always need a punch line to be funny? Or you just didn't find it funny so you don't say it is a joke. Literally just because your opinion of the joke as it is not funny to YOU, does not make it not a joke you mog. Also racist jokes are funny to me and I am literally mixed race as It is just a joke you moron.
---
Your circles need to be tight but still get you behind the killer
---
When is the mid-chapter? Is that also with the new Freddy?
---
Not, it's single use. But you since the view is locked off, you could disappear by going left or right.
---
This is the key. As a killer, people try to 360 me all the time and they literally just do a circle right in front of me.
---
Does this open the doors to a possible cross play?
---
I'm comparing a societal opinion to a societal opinion. If most people consider it "bad manners", then it is
---
Ahhh awesome thanks mate. I'll have a fool around on it now and try download it from another source. 
---
I'm in the UK and it's still not on mine.
---
Ah sounds about right! New Freddy and bill...I‚Äôm pretty excited.
---
I would recommend buying the leather face dlc if you‚Äôre gonna play killer, he has one of the best teachables out there, BBQ, Hag is great too. The Halloween DLC is useful as well since you‚Äôll be facing a lot of tunnelers in rank 20 and Laurie has a perk that counters it.
---
No i just don't like it when random people try to put their words into someone elses mouth to try and get a completely different point across.  In no fucking way can you assume what you said from what he wrote
---
It feels like they made the aim assist a lot stronger for the killer lunges than it used to be. So it is harder to 360 nowadays imo but if they're going to work it all it would definitely be at that rank.
---
I dont even play survivor as often as killer i can still do it
---
Schrodinger's asshole, where the remark exists as both a joke and not a joke depending on how well it's received.
---
I understand, thanks for the info
---
As a P3 Bill main, I'm excited for my fellow Console Fog Dwellers. :D
---
Dude read his last sentence, he literally says that while snares are less effective, they have more use cases
---
*Sees healed up Survivors running up to the hook*
---
"Ah shit, here we go again"
---
Can you explain to me how you did it?
---
There is though? You give Freddy a 20 second cooldown global range teleport instead of 45, he becomes much harder to hear, and the traps affect you.
---
The fail a skill check, reveling them and lowing a gen or whatever action they were doing. 
---
And unlike Trapper and Hag, his traps cant be disarmed.
---
"Fake pallets can only be placed after you have broken a thrown down pallet, therefore while dream snares are less effective they have more use cases." read the whole sentence you twat instead of cherry picking details trying to change the entire meaning
---
What mindgames work against a good spirit? Brainless is the exact word against spirit, cause nothing u do really matters if they're good
---
He was an amazing voice actor, PILLS HERE
---
Sure thing man, glad I could help! For me personally it wasn‚Äôt that hard, I just had to create a new Apple ID with the region set as Norway. Then I got a link for the game on YouTube and it opened up
---
Uh, not particularly, unfortunately
---
^Also ^as ^someone ^who‚Äôs ^played ^console ^and ^PC ^we ^don‚Äôt ^want ^PC ^nurses ^thx
---
I mean, if you want to get better at killer then playing against a swf will help if you want to look at it that way.
---
Its 3 seconds with a 45 second cooldown that can become around 18 with all 4 sleeping sruviviors. 
---
His movespeed is NOT slowed while placing a trap and it takes only 1 second for them to arm. It slows for 15% and stops fast vaults, and lasts for 3 seconds with a 5 second trap duration, much like clown gas.
---
I hope this isn‚Äôt how they make it, I prefer the unique style of the bloodweb
---
Not\_Queen has answered that question, you keep the perks but they won't appear anymore in any bloodwebs.
---
Wrong, I'm currently hanging in at rank using No Mither+resilience+TINH+Were gonna live forever
---
Just curious. What is the difference between a toxic SWF group and a non-toxic SWF group?
---
so wait is console getting the exclusive l4d cosmetics?
---
Hi! I'm happy to answer all of your questions.
---
+ I would suggest you get the game on PC. I've never played on console before, but I have always heard that the performance is awful (30 FPS), it looks poor, and that matches are harder to find. What I do know however is that if you get the game on PC, you can change your keybindings, you can have access to the test server, and you could play with a controller anyway!
---
+ I consider the best DLC to be the Halloween DLC. It comes with a good killer that is easy to learn and play, plus perks from both sides that can completely change your playstyle, adding something fresh and unique to a build. This is something you don't get with most perks. Myers also has some addons that can completely change his usual gameplay.
---
+ I don't have any personally, but if you are used to a controller it may be more comfortable for you. That's all I can think of. In terms of actual advantages, M+K has exclusive benefits.
---
+ Always rank-based but rank isn't terribly important so it hardly feels that way.
---
+ Pipping is just the game's rank-up system. You can get -1/0/+1/+2 pips per match. Once you have gained enough pips, your rank goes up.
---
+ The Bloodweb is your character progression system, as well as the way you get perks, items, add-ons, and offerings. You earn Bloodpoints in game and this is where you spend them. Each bloodweb completed counts as another level for your character. The higher the level your character is, the bigger, and thus more expensive, your bloodwebs get. Once you reach the max level for a character (50), you can continue to complete Level-50 bloodwebs or prestige, losing all of your items, add-ons, perks, offerings in your inventory, resetting your character to Level-1, and giving yourself one of 3 exclusive bloody cosmetics. You can prestige 3 times.
---
+ Any original, non-licensed characters (killer or survivor) can be bought through the in-game store for 9000 Iridescent Shards, another currency you gain every time your account-level goes up, which goes up with gameplay.
---
+ Here is a glossary of common terms: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary
---
+ I wish I had known to level up for teachables that I wanted before putting points into a survivor/killer I wanted to play. Oh well!
---
+ As mentioned earlier, any items, perks, add-ons, or offerings can be bought from the bloodweb!
---
How is the hag gameplay wise these days?  I remember her being really difficult to use due to some design decisions but I think she was "recently" addressed to make her a bit better.
---
Read that back but slowly.....
---
Yea that's what I'm sayin they even increased pallets on it and people still bitch
---
I love Myers....he that bitch
---
So it's still useless lol.
---
She's fine as she is. If they change anything on her it will ruin her. The only guys complaining that shes too OP are the survivor mains, they alteady fucked up Ghostface
---
To suit the meme.
---
I get why everyone is memeing on the wraith‚Äôs mori, but the trapper‚Äôs is like the exact same...
---
Welcome to your nightmares, *Bitch.*
---
If you‚Äôre getting tunneled every game, you‚Äôre either actively seeking out the killer or getting found too easily. Are you like going for flashlight saves or something every game?
---
Played a game with a friend who was fairly new, see the killer rush to the shack as he says "hey why are there 4 hooks in here"
---
But he‚Äôs a survivor not a killer lmao. They aren‚Äôt adding The Witch as a killer (though that would be horrifying) or The Tank. Plus Ash is from a series about demons and supernatural shit while most killers are just humans with powers blessed by the Entity. 
---
I truly don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre on, he‚Äôd be no different than if they added Nathan Drake or Laura Croft as survivors.
---
I had a similar issue yesterday I was playing as killer I‚Äôm rank 18 cuz I don‚Äôt play as often as I would like but it matched me up against a rank 1 and a rank 6, it didn‚Äôt go well as you‚Äôd probably guess
---
it makes gen repairing faster than if you don't have it.
---
Mobile exclusive :o) Oinkers
---
&gt;Console comes with 2 more survivors and 2 more killers than PC, but it‚Äôs a bit harder (still very possible) to be precise with a controller. Bill is currently exclusive to PC but his perks are on console and he‚Äôs being brought to console shortly.
---
When you say this do you mean the base game purchase offers 2 more of both compared to base pc purchase?  I kept reading that 360ing the killer was very common on console but not with pc due to the precise movement of mouse.
---
&gt;Tunneling - after someone is unhooked, going straight for them and not allowing them to do anything. A bit different from camping, as with camping the goal is to not let them be unhooked.
---
Oh I see.  I thought it had something to do with over focusing on someone.  Good to know I was close.
---
&gt;A tip for survivor - you don‚Äôt need to instantly unhook someone, you can work on a generator for 30 seconds, run to and unhook them, and get out unscathed since the killer is now chasing someone on the other side of the map. Unhooking immediately results in a practically guaranteed down for either you or the other survivor.
---
This is a good tip.  Though while i'm here, is it ever worth it to try and unhook yourself?  I never see this happen or attempted in the gameplay I watch.
---
&gt;Killer - just leave a chase if you think it isn‚Äôt worth it. You have a strict time limit until the gens are completed and if a chase has been going on for 2 minutes and you still haven‚Äôt hit them, you‚Äôre losing more than you‚Äôre gaining at that point. In the same point, if a survivor heads towards an area that has a ton of pallets or windows, just don‚Äôt follow them if you aren‚Äôt confident, and go pressure another survivor.
---
So basically don't over commit.  Gotcha.  Thanks for responding!
---
Honestly don't know how people don't play both sides more. I know Killers get more BP, but the rush from hiding and outplaying killers is too good to pass up for long imo.
---
But still all of that is just a guessing game. Everything depends on what the spirit decides to do.
---
Thanks. Unrelated note I Ran into someone today who complained about me camping even though there were 3 survivors left (they were the third and were hooked), there were two generators so close by that if the killer was standing on one their terror radius could reach the other with the medium intensity (aka when the terror radius is saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs close... not very close but close nonetheless... be prepared to run or hide!‚Äù), and the other two survivors were focused on the rescue instead of generator rushing, so I had too much to lose by leaving it compared to how much I could gain by staying.
---
I honestly felt bad for that guy he seemed nervous as hell and probably felt like no one was gonna like the rework
---
Really that makes you say ‚Äúyikes‚Äù your username and dream daddy are more yikes than the comment...
---
Yeah, were the other 2 members low ranks? Cuz if they were that was probably a SWF
---
Yes.. I know they did, but the fact that they INITIALLY put a sound on a stealth killer is what blew my mind, they actually had to have people tell them that a loud af noise on a killer relying on people not knowing he's there, is a stupid idea.
---
Were kinda having a complete non-argument here. All three of us are essentially saying the same thing
---
Ash is in the same world as killers Freddy and Jason so that's out the window and that's not the point the game is a story completely different to dead by daylight it's a zombie apocalypse game and I'm not on anything I'm just simply pointing out a sore thumb.
---
Let's be honest who wouldn't be nervous?
---
damn son 21k shards your better off just buying them for 10 dollars
---
That's why you close the Hatch FIRST.
---
I..... I‚Äôm sorry but what the fuck did I just read? What the cinnamon toast fuck is this?
---
No but the ptb is on the 9th and 2 weeks after that is the 23rd so I‚Äôm guessing the 23rd
---
Are you one of those people who die first in a horror film?
---
Being next to Stefan ;)
---
and the 20 survives for not wasting time teabagging everything xD
---
As a meg...
---
That's a shit excuse tbh
---
That is beautiful
---
Love your art style so much!
---
Killer rank: 18
---
That one HUGE stutter step he took was painful to watch. Everyone kinda froze a second hoping he wouldnt puke eveywhere
---
Your progress won‚Äôt carry over nope, and from what I know, it runs on iPhones 7 and over, but I don‚Äôt know for androids.
---
Wow didn't see this coming at all. Hopefully the cosmetics come with it !
---
How is the mobile version anyway?
---
It does make them scream so it does give some tracking as well.
---
She‚Äôs really fun to play, and powerful if you use her correctly with the right addons! Plus her perk ruin counters gen rushing, well as long as the hex totem is standing.
---
But they still did listen and fix it is my point.
---
Ah victory
---
Good lord, I thought that was some type of glitched killer.
---
When I started to play this game seriously (I already played it but was shit and didn't know shit) I forgot I could already equip perks
---
He wasn't already?
---
Yeah in both cases they could have just left instead of tea bagging the kill and I would have escaped
---
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
not, if you play with blood warden
---
Cool spirit is here cute
---
Do you seriously play like this? I genuinely don't believe you. Theres no way you would rank up at all doing this. You would probably be so useless to your team in terms of distracting the killer that you would lose most of your games.
---
I imagine they are going to fix the end game problems going on with the teleport before the PTB or do what they did with ghostface and make changes on a second ptb before live.
---
I‚Äôm on an IPhone 8 Plus and It runs surprisingly well, only time my frames ever drop is when I get a notification but other than that it‚Äôs really good
---
guess im not the only one who thought that.  i played the first game with my super decked out hag that just got to lvl 35.  mori, all that.  hooked 2 guys early on....and they both died on teh first hook.  
---
so i thought ok i'll take it easy.  hooked the 3rd guy, he at least got rescued.   ended up  hooking the 3rd and 4th within seconds of each other.  
---
come back to the lobby, i'm a lvl 16 killer.  they were all 20s except for 1 who was an 18.  felt kinda bad.
---
next match, i got steamrolled.   2 lvl 8s, a level 12 and a level 19.  had no idea whta happened
---
I'm sorry what?
---
Check the front page.
---
And yet the game still has a 50% base survival rate. **BIGTHINK**
---
But you hear the spirit phasing
---
Bill is owned by Vavle, who owns Steam. So it makes sense as to why
---
Holy shit..... someone complains about new DS..... git gud
---
Yep, that's mostly because valve own the rights to Left 4 dead and all the cosmetics that come with the games and I guess BHVR managed to strike a deal with them to add bill and the cosmetics (I think) onto the consoler version which is great because I love Bill as a character
---
It would be werid if they didnt. A character with no teachables?
---
ok but what's gonna happen to the teachables?
---
It sounds like freddy can "destroy" 10 pallets with his alternate ability, but only for sleeping survivors?  This seems extremely scary, excited to play against it!
---
When you get a lobby filled with flashlihlghts and claudettes so you lock in Mori
---
Could you draw the doctor and the trapper too? I love your art style!
---
Ok. Maybe I'll give it a try
---
Working as intended, yes.
---
Why are they all dressed as l4d characters?
---
üòî I don‚Äôt own Freddy and I haven‚Äôt seen the perk on rotation
---
Fucking Christ
---
The beef from killers is that if **ALL 4** survivors are seasoned and competent, its very difficult for the killer to play effectively.  Sure, red rank is going to be infested with strong competent survivors and SWF, but Killers talk like this is norm all the time and not the exception.
---
Survivor players meanwhile have to deal with that feeling of helplessness all the god damn time. Team mate got downed bu the Ruin Mori P3 Nurse  near the basement in the first 45 sec of the game? Guess Ill die. The game might as well be over now.
---
One bad teammate or one bad mistake can throw the entire game for all the survivors regardless of the killer.

&gt;I would suggest you get the game on PC. I've never played on console before, but I have always heard that the performance is awful (30 FPS), it looks poor, and that matches are harder to find. What I do know however is that if you get the game on PC, you can change your keybindings, you can have access to the test server, and you could play with a controller anyway!
---
I had heard that they might be optimizing console at some point which is why it's even an option for me.  But yeah from what I know console doesn't seem like it's a very well polished experience at the moment.
---
&gt;I consider the best DLC to be the Halloween DLC. It comes with a good killer that is easy to learn and play, plus perks from both sides that can completely change your playstyle, adding something fresh and unique to a build. This is something you don't get with most perks. Myers also has some addons that can completely change his usual gameplay.
---
You're the second person to recommend this dlc.  Considering freddy is getting reworked very soon and I enjoy him I'll probably be picking it up!  Thanks for the feedback.  Is there a second dlc you think I should nab along side it?  I can say that spirit looks very fun to me.  But i'm not sure what she brings to the table add on wise nor what the survivor that comes with her does.
---
&gt;I don't have any personally, but if you are used to a controller it may be more comfortable for you. That's all I can think of. In terms of actual advantages, M+K has exclusive benefits.
---
From what i've heard controller makes survivor play feel really easy.  But nothing beyond that.  I have also heard that mouse gives you greater control over killer.  Is there anything else I should be aware of with M&amp;K play besides rebinding?
---
&gt;Always rank-based but rank isn't terribly important so it hardly feels that way.
---
Good to hear.  I get anxiety/stress rather easy in competitive environments.  Which I sometimes love (as a thrill seeker aha) but I didn't want to feel that pressure all the time.
---
&gt;Pipping is just the game's rank-up system. You can get -1/0/+1/+2 pips per match. Once you have gained enough pips, your rank goes up.
---
Gotcha.
---
&gt;The Bloodweb is your character progression system, as well as the way you get perks, items, add-ons, and offerings. You earn Bloodpoints in game and this is where you spend them. Each bloodweb completed counts as another level for your character. The higher the level your character is, the bigger, and thus more expensive, your bloodwebs get. Once you reach the max level for a character (50), you can continue to complete Level-50 bloodwebs or prestige, losing all of your items, add-ons, perks, offerings in your inventory, resetting your character to Level-1, and giving yourself one of 3 exclusive bloody cosmetics. You can prestige 3 times.
---
I think I understand.  So when I level up a character do I lose the stuff I was using in the prior blood web?
---
&gt;Any original, non-licensed characters (killer or survivor) can be bought through the in-game store for 9000 Iridescent Shards, another currency you gain every time your account-level goes up, which goes up with gameplay.
---
Thought so.  Besides freddy and ghost face are there any other licensed killers?  I would think shape but he's called shape instead of myers.  (oh I assume pig is licensed too.)
---
&gt;Here is a glossary of common terms: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary
---
Massive appreciation for this.
---
&gt;I wish I had known to level up for teachables that I wanted before putting points into a survivor/killer I wanted to play. Oh well!
---
When you say putting points into you're referring to blood points yes?  So you're saying you wish you mastered teachables on a survivor before moving to another survivor and putting points in that one?
---
Also one final question because I forgot to ask it in my post.  I hear "totem" a lot.  Can you explain what those do for a killer?  I thought it might be add on but its something on the map that can be cleansed.  So i've never understood what it is.
---
I use nea on my Claudette
---
And he wasn't a copy and paste before with littrely no active power that was all entirely a boring ass passive? All he did was click a survivor once and did littrely nothing else. 
---
Being put to sleep makes his GLOBAL range teleport a 18 second cooldown instead of 45, which is a pretty big deal, not to mention the different addons he can have. 
---
The warning is only 3 seconds, the same amounbt of time a wraith would uncloak, and faster then legion stun.
---
Freddy is going to be better then he is now so it isnt shit.
---
I do wonder what the point will be for leveling him up or playing as him for people who already have his perks and a "main" survivor with all perks already. While it's great that he's coming to console, there doesn't seem to be incentive to ever play or use him unless they take away his teachables from the survivors you already have them on.
---
Lack of word bitch downvoted
---
I did try to tell people the games controls wouldnt work well on mobile but nobodyt listened.
---

---
I think i've hear ruin/totem used interchangably.  Can you perhaps clarify for me?
---
that's good to know.  Also is there a dlc you recommend I nab along side holloween?
---
I mean survivors are skins. Sure he‚Äôs not coming with any new perks but some people will want to play as him, cosmetically.
---
It‚Äôs not free right?
---
New survivor here what is BNP?
---
don't do this, only villains do that
---
I usually bring a medkit, because I like the extra perk slot and medkit faster than SC, but I am also definitely running out of medkits, and pharmacy is a DLC perk i dont have (and playing at red ranks currently, so searching boxes wastes precious time). 
---
"a perk that helps you not get hit in the first place" ma dude, that's a tad insulting. Also no matter how godlike you are, everyone gets hit. I already run Iron Will and Balanced Landing
---
I am a villain I‚Äôm a ghost face boo
---
Spirits pretty okay at sneaking up and spooking but the true masters of sneaky spooks are myers and ghost face
---
Myers has an addon that gives him wall hacks and no terror radius at the cost of moving slower and his general kit allows for some spooks
---
Ghostface is just in general sneaky with his ability to hide terror radius
---
Spirit is a killer you will learn how to use over time but she has a spirit fury which is a great perk haunted grounds which can be a very sneak perk if you have ruin and rancor is a very niesh perk that doesn‚Äôt work all the time 
---
But if you are looking for a sneaky killer then pig Myers and ghost face are all great picks
---
^^^Daddy ^^^Stefan
---
It's in the eye of the beholder. To me, a toxic swf when they play hyper-altruistically, tea-bag and flashlight click every chance, and make every attempt to bully the killer. Even then it's not that bad because at least nobody is doing gens when they play like that. A highly organized non-toxic swf that gets the gens done quickly is far more annoying, but I can't get mad about them doing their only objective. That's the difference in my opinion, but like I said everybody is going to have a different take.

---
does anyone have the png perk icons from the console version? like the one i posted above
---
Don‚Äôt even attempt unhooking unless you have no other way or a specific build for it. You have a 4% chance to get off the hook without perks or offerings, and 3 chances before going into struggle.
---
Yes, from what I know, since console was released a year after PC, it has feng min, ace visconti, the doctor, and the hag to start out, which PC does not.
---
Juking the killer in general is easier on console due to controller sensitivity and freedom of movement, but this won‚Äôt work in higher ranks anyway.
---
Also, just to add on, the main game has ranks, and there is no ‚Äúcasual‚Äù mode, but the ranks have no rewards or anything.
---
No, not always. It has to be a late skillcheck for this to happen.
---
Spirit, Myers, Ghostface, Pig
---
The right thing to do would to put all his perks in the shrine for free.

Can I post pics in replies? I'm not making a new thread but yeah I play like this. To be fair I may have quentin at 3ish because I love methboy.
---
Brand New Part is an add-on for toolboxes that allows you to install parts on a generator for a quick 25% progression in exchange for fast skillchecks.
---
It used to be able to go up to 100% completion in a few seconds as long as you hit every skillcheck, but it was nerfed.
---
I might look into Meyers he seems fun
---
how are his perks gonna work if i already have em
---
This happened to me yesterday with a meg and made me want to go John wick mode on her
---
What store
---
Spirit is great she is one the top tier killers
---
You quoted my comment but I don't think you actually *read* it. I said to "Do whatever, as long as you aren't *cheating*." Cheating includes using bugs and exploits to your advantage. 
---
I will defend anyone who uses in game items, addons, or playstyles that are in the game, and are working as intended. I *won't* defend anyone who uses exploits, bugs, 3rd party programs, or flat out cheating.
---
If you were using Wake Up before the patch, you were using a perk, knowing that it was bugged. Cheating. 
---
Using an Ebony Mori, an offering that is in the game, for it's intended purpose, is not cheating. Hitting someone after they get lucky and pull themselves off of a hook, is not cheating. Using a bugged perk/addon that has been confirmed to bugged, *IS* cheating. Purposefully trying to get the killer stuck in a pallet, *IS* cheating.
---
Dude, I'm not the devil. I play within the rules, without cheating or using exploits, with what the devs have given to the community. I just play for my own fun.
---
It is.
---
You can see Freddy outside of the dreamworld. Within 16 meters you can see him at all times, and from 16-32 you see glimpses of him. Overcharge will still be terrible on Freddy.
---
Exactly, easy to get salty like they did, yeah they should've just done gens and they probably could've made the rescue because you'd have had to leave the hook area to patrol gens if they were actually doing gens instead of making you go on hook defense, I usually play legion  so I just tag em all when they start swarming the hook which avoids those kinds of standoffs from happening.
---
No shirt vs Stripped sweater
---
Its the battle the legends speak of!
---
*salutes*
---
It's the most useless perk in the game for survivors. I would rather run deja vu than MoM. üòÇ
---
She‚Äôs honestly average at best and more map reliant than most other killers. She‚Äôs super telegraphic and she could use some more oofmph.
---
LOOOOL I need to do this!
---
Brand new part, it's a toolbox add on that does a decent amount of progress on a gen. It used to instantly complete a gen.
---
oh they're adding cross-play? (also this had to be planned out because of valve and licensing issues)
---
OwO
---
brand new parts I guess, an addon for toolbox.
---
and that's fine, but even having a main survivor, you still had incentive to level up or use others to at least get their teachables, and it doesn't seem Bill will come with that.
---
Like I said it's great he's coming and I fully expect Bill mains to start appearing around me. When I already have 3 survivors I cycle through regularly all with BT, Unbreakable, and even Left Behind on I don't see a reason to ever use him. Since like you said they are just skins.
---
well obviously, they're not gonna just say "fuck you console players you have to pay for him" when pc gets him for free
---
This isn't even his final form
---
Steam hosted the game before consoles. Valve owns steam. Valve developed Ledr for Dead. This Bill. You're reading too deep into it and coming off as a dumb ass troll.
---
yes
---
The guy who messaged me doesn‚Äôt realize he can be reporting for unsporting behavior here in the world of Xbox, I explained to him why I parked my ass nearby (2 gems, his team mates keep throwing themselves at him to save him, im playing Doctor, etc.) but nah, he didn‚Äôt wanna explain WHY I should leave the hook, 2 generators, and the 2 survivors who‚Äôs job it is mine to kill and let them rescue him, just go. Great logic buddy!
---
ruin is a hex totem basically. A random dull totem on the map will be lit up, and when survivors find it and cleanse it basically your perk gets disabled for the rest of the match. 
---
I would definitely recommend leatherface since he has the best perk in the game right now. BBQ gives you a bonus 25% blood points for each different survivors you hook, and each time you hook you see the auras of survivors who are 40 or more meters away.
---
Who's bill?
---
I too would like to know the story behind this.
---
Giving him a 18 second cooldown telkeport compared to 45 seconds seems good to me since thats how it works.
---
now those generic icons will be sent to the shadow realm
---
it's not a sore thumb though
---
I love it when some toxic feng pallet drops you, teabags, but you were legion, so you vault and cause the deep wound status effect, then make here and the SWFs DC, and you get the adept legion.
---
Get nae nae‚Äôd
---
You fool, how am I gonna click a flashlight to piss off a killer if my hand full of medkit, think before you post
---
*scratched mirror myers noises*
---
Just because they murder does meant you CANT waifu them :o.
---
That's great but it still doesn't make sense and no don't label people trolls just because they point out relevant inconsistencies -.-
---
All they gotta do is put in Nightmare on elm Street üòÇ
---
I doubt it, maybe Xbox and ps4 but not console/pc.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt even attempt unhooking unless you have no other way or a specific build for it. You have a 4% chance to get off the hook without perks or offerings, and 3 chances before going into struggle.
---
That sounds mega unforgiving.  Can see why people don't attempt it.  Thanks for clearing that up.
---
&gt;Yes, from what I know, since console was released a year after PC, it has feng min, ace visconti, the doctor, and the hag to start out, which PC does not.
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
&gt;Juking the killer in general is easier on console due to controller sensitivity and freedom of movement, but this won‚Äôt work in higher ranks anyway.
---
Good to know, but i'll probably just get it on pc because I hear console is very unpolished.
---
&gt;Also, just to add on, the main game has ranks, and there is no ‚Äúcasual‚Äù mode, but the ranks have no rewards or anything.
---
So it basically just serves to aid matchmaking.  Nice to know.  I assume I should avoid playing survive with friends as a killer until i've gotten used to the game.
---
&gt; Doctor, Hag, and Huntress free too 
---
two things about that
---
1. you paid 30 dollars for the game
---
2. huntress is free
---
how are his perks gonna work for new players i wonder, will they already be unlock or do you need to level him up?
---
those are all cosmetics in-game (PC only) for the 4 original survivors. Hoping those are coming with Bill to console as that would be pretty cool.
---
A character from a zombie apocalypse game being put in a strictly killer game is a sore thumb imo
---
Never can be too sure. Console players get a couple killers and survivors that PC has to pay for.
---
*sighs* *kick* *kick*
---
You realize that the old BNP which was not against the rules, just a regular addon yet 10x as cancerous as 4 people using wakeup right? If BHVR starts doing LSD in the office and they make an item which is "kill all survivors in 1 second" would you A use it because: it's an item in the game it's not an exploit and I think it's fun to use or B grow a fucking brain, realize BHVR is doing stupid ass shit and hope to god that if you don't use this ridiculous item that maybe you'll inspire others to not use it either and the game can stay alive without being ruined? Whether it's an exploit or BHVR is just being dumbasses again shouldn't matter.
---
i just didn't have time tbh and took the first one i saw there xD
---
I'm very interested in seeing some matches with decent survivors staying asleep the whole duration of the match. I wanna see how it is when he's a peak power the whole time.
---
Thank you! I hope to get Bill to P3 as fast as possible!
---
Limited buttons man. Also they want it to be a choice, since pallets and snares are both really strong and having both would be overkill.
---
So there are some perks that exist in the game that can be shut off by survivors if they cleanse the right totem.  Am I understanding that right?
---
So holloween and leather face.  Final question.  How do you feel about spirit/ghost face?  As from all the killers gameplay wise (aside from freddy) those are the ones i'm super interested in.  Wraith kinda as well but I believe he's a base game killer.  Altertnatively if you could recommend a killer I should avoid trying to use off the bat or a killer that is new player friendly i'd also appreciate that.
---

Go to tap.io, and install taptap
---
"We decided not to rework Freddy, instead we buff survivors, thank you"
---
Fun but not particularly sneaky
---
So uh...one big problem.
---
&gt; Freddy can use Dream Projection to teleport to any generator that is not completed or blocked by the entity.
---
So basically once EGC happens Freddy has zero powers? I mean he'll still have the dream snare, but they do not seem like they will be that good during the EGC unless you preemptively make a wall of them around each exit gate.
---
If you like scaring people, go with Myers, GhostFace, or Pig. You'll get some real good jump scares!
---
Fuck man they better come out when its outta beta
---
Most people on console got it free back for having PS+  Plus OP wants to act like we were missing anything by not having bill before when we had his teachables as free perks.
---
**THIS SEEMS OP. CAN WE REWORK THIS SO HE CAN‚ÄôT PICK UP SURVIVORS OR KNOCK THEM? JUST THINKING OUT LOUD. I WANT TO BE SLIGHTLY WORRIED ABOUT BLOODPOINTS BUT NEVER ACTUALLY LOSE.**
---
Awesome!!!!
---
bubba always looks cute
---
Not really since you have to sit for 12 seconds to make it activate. Kind of pointless mid chasd
---
But it's not.. the entity exists outside of time and space, can reach through different realities. It looks for survivors, and it looks for killers.
---
It found a survivor in Bill, so it took Bill. Entity doesn't want zombies because they're dead unfeeling monsters, it wants people with emotions it can feed off for it's survivors and killers.
---
Yaaaaaas! Finally! Hopefully we'll get the L4D cosmetics too for the four originals, but that might be asking for too much
---
*turns out it's basement bubba*
---
I wonder how teachables and people already with bills teachables will work
---
**ELLIS DWIGHT**
---
basically, sally hates everyone and Evan is annoying, so she figures she will put an end to it
---
Learn to loop. That‚Äôll save you all the seconds.
---
i mean clearly he has some dedicated fans from L4D and even though i only played that for a short time i know im gonna use him alot. the incentive to level him up is that he has good perks, items, add ons? also alot of people still care about prestige
---
#ELLIS DWIGHT
---
Actually the game was free
---
Happy clown glacial when?
---
i hope BHRV have learned with freddy and ghostface (with ghostface's buff i began to think that BHRV have learned from their mistakes and survivor sided homicide that was ghostface)
---
Not really that's why they said 'no monsters' because it's a game and lore based on killers and survivors of killers only so throwing Bill in contradicts that and sticks out really bad like putting vampires in an alien game.
---
My mans, why is No Mither not here? Is it too OP to list?
---
I hope he doesn't take this meme the wrong way, being in the spotlight while nervous makes you misjudge things like this.
---
Or take adrenaline and burn gens. lol
---
Funny story, I dropped a pallet on Michael while he was picking a survivor up. He stood on top of the pallet just like this while carrying the survivor. Ended up walking right over it, let me unhook the survivor, and we farmed for the rest of the game. :)
---
PC survivor main - looking for 2-4 man SWF matches - steam: elliesenra - time zone: EST  
---
no toxic shit pls.
---
Imagine thrilling tremors with him, you will know exactly which generators to teleport to
---
Its like doctor acaullty.
---
If you wanted to prestige I guess you'd have to get the teachables would be my assumption
---
not in Canada sadly
---
You have no idea what I see or hear from survivors. Makes me embarrassed when I switch over to survivor after playing killer.
---
One guy harassed me in chat because "of course I'm going to lose when I can't see you" (Freddy) and I'm like "dude I'm just playing the game. That's his power"
---
ok?
---
What does this mean for his perks? Will they continue to be generalized for everybody ?
---
Touch√©
---
"Hold yer horses... I'll be with ya in a minute."
---
Bill is a survivor so it doesn't contradict it.
---
Yep exactly, it a risk/reward perk.
---
I would recommend getting ghostface since he is a licensed killer and can‚Äôt be bought with in game money and he is a LOT of fun to play and play against. But for spirit‚Äôs case, she is in the top 5 killers tier list but you can get her with in game currency with enough grinding.
---
I just recommend leveling up killers with good perks for now so you get their teachables, then move on to killers with play styles that interest you. I don‚Äôt recommend playing nurse for now, but I recommend leveling her up for nurses calling, and level up billy for enduring, and trapper for brutal strength. Some new player friendly killers are trapper, wraith (don‚Äôt use him, he sucks), pig, ghostface, clown, legion, leatherface.
---
My personal favorite is huntress, in my opinion she is one of the most fun killers to play as. Not the strongest due to her slow movement speed, but she can snipe, and shut off a lot of loops. So I recommend checking her out when you‚Äôve got the bbq, nurses, ruin teachables. As they‚Äôre at the moment the best perks for her.
---
From a zombie apocalypse game so yes it definitely does.
---
I‚Äôm joking. Great post!
---
Left 4 Dead character.
---
not immediately (it's experimental)
---
Whenever you see the survivors do something, especially in a chase, try to understand why they did it.  Manage your time like your life depends on it, spending too much time on one area or person could end badly depending on your killer / loadout
---
it wasnt, he wants to escape from a shitty situation and make you feel stupid at the same time, but we will keep that between us, okay?
---
And it used to do a generator instantly, but was nerfed.
---
That‚Äôs completely fair. I just kinda hoped the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever want to lose‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt knock people or pick them up‚Äù was outrageous enough to be sarcastic.
---
Just rework her addons. No range addons and no extra blinks, unless some gimmicky ultra rares.
---
The game type he originates from doesn't matter. He's not bringing the zombie apocalypse with him when the entity spots him. The entity saw Bill a strong survivor in an apocalyptic world so it took him for it's trials. That doesn't contradict anything and actually fits perfectly fine with DBD lore.
---
I'm excited to play as it
---
Because summoning rbt's and having a pig head stuck to your head isn't
---
A a#see we decide
---
Why the Fuck am I not surprised at this?
---
Range addons are the best addons for her and make her broken dude
---
I don't even play console but I'm so happy to see my boy get what he deserves
---
Not sure what Wraith and Clown are doing in the background though. Getting ready to take them off-guard, or watching them play?
---
Last time I tried that the team all put up auto haven on my Lery‚Äôs lol. I felt like a Trex trying to use his arms for literally anything lol
---
Just so you know 
---
1. There is a rank reset every month, where players are bumped down a few ranks, meaning that sometimes that rank 14 you see should be at rank 8.
---
2. I hover around the upper ranks, and still see the occasional rank 20, so the ranking system isn‚Äôt anywhere near perfect.
---
I hope you reported that message.Hoping someone to get cancer is uncalled for
---
Ikr? How chill the other guys are, I think Mcote has a sweat covered shirt, and new guy is trying to be as professional as he can.

GRABBIN BILLS?

Wow your a huge fan! I thought i was happy, but i'm happy for you. :)
---
11 second clip - "We're removing Freddy, fuck you"
---
Even though he doesn‚Äôt match the description you stated, if you don‚Äôt already have bbq teachable I would strongly recommend buying leatherface. That perk alone makes bloodpoint grinding extremely easy as killer. 
---
If that doesn‚Äôt matter to you, then Myers and Ghostface are the two best killers for sneaking up on people.
---
Like u/Daevillis said it really depends on your definition of "toxic", but I think it's when you really use the benefits of voice communication to an unfair advantage. Saying "the Killer is by me" is fine but when you have people with Anti-Hem Syringes and Flashlights and Prove Thyself all working with military coordination it's extremely unfun for the Killer.
---
Do you really have to keep adding the nobody: part?
---
Came quality is fine it makes it MORE cursed
---
Yeah actually it does and it doesn't matter that it's only him it's still connecting a zombie apocalypse game to a killer only game it just makes no sense what so ever I get you wanna defend the character but I'm just pointing out logic.
---
So you were...Detective Tapp?
---
Basement Freddy with MYC is gonna be super fun if there's a gen by basement
---
we still dont have a proper cemetery. Mausoleums, large tombstones, metal gates which could be blown open as the gens progress. Maybe with a bit of catacomb underneath, with coffins instead of boxes
---
I'm sorry but what? Learn to love being camped? This  is almost comparable to "Learn to love having a creepy stalker, they're showing an interest in you and aren't stalking other people as a result of you letting them stalk you instead." When I open up Dead by Daylight I'm not excited and waiting in anticipation to sit on a hook for 2 minutes doing nothing while the other survivors potentially do gens risk free. I'd like to see my teammates also win, but ultimately I'd rather be the one that chooses to be sacrificed for others or every person for themselves. I agree that you shouldn't disconnect or suicide on hook (w/ some exceptions), but I'm not going to see it as a blessing that the killer has chosen to stay near me. I get no points for being camped, will likely downpip, and I couldn't care less if my random teammates benefit from me being hooked, especially if they're shitty teammates that aren't at least getting gens or hexes done.

Create a new iTunes account with the country you have in mind. You can‚Äôt change a pre-existing account‚Äôs country, if I recall correctly.

Who the hell is behind wraith
---
its just like hag, seems complicated when you look down and see "place trap" "teleport" "kick generator" "pick up survivor" all at the same time, but in practice, you just need to learn the controls and you are ready.
---
Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress/Spirit, Clown are generally considered the top 5 killers, in that order. I personally like Myers and The Hag though, they're lots of fun. Choose whomever you like, and you'll have fun. Most killers are pretty good.
---
Your top perks are Hex: Ruin, BBQ and Chili, Nurses Calling, Thanatophobia, Bamboozle, Discordance, Enduring, Spirit Fury to name a few. Hex: No One Escapes Death can be good for newer killers. So depending on what perks you might want might influence your killer choice.
---
Also dont respect pallets, chase right through them without stopping and you'll get looped less. Happy hunting!
---
Brave words for a whiny bitch.
---
Just let them keep being delusional bruv
---
Wow, that's really nice.
---
Altough I would love to see him with a more twisted face, let's remember he was a sick SOB from the start.
---
Bill is coming to console?
---
xbox and pc would make more sense than ps4 and xbox
---
Or there's option C. I don't use the item because why the hell would I want to use an item that **takes all of the fun out of my game?** Same thing applies to old BNP. If I finished all the gens in three and a half minutes that wouldn't be fun for me. Old Legion wasn't fun for me, his kit was busted and it made playing killer boring and *not fun*.
---
Using a stupidly broken/OP item that take all of the challenge out of my game, wouldn't be fun for me would it? If BHVR released an item like you described, hell no I wouldn't use it. If they brought back old BNP (which they won't), hell no I wouldn't use it. 
---
I want to play the game, get into chases, hook people, loop killers, same as you. I just don't play by made up rules while I do it.
---
^(wack)
---
I played like 1000 hours on console and after moving to PC played several matches with Hag without any perks not knowing everyone started with teachables
---
its a step in the right direction if he can teleport to the gen at the end of the map where all survivors are and he can hit them instantly
---
You're logic is flawed and that's why you're being told your wrong, because you are. 
---
But I get that you've stubbornly dug your heels in and will refuse to change your mind regardless so yea I guess I'm done as well.
---
yea but it balances out with steam having sales all the time
---
I couldn't imagine controlling your character on a mobile screen.
---
fyi, if you're gonna play killer, turn on aim assist, you will have a much easier time
---
yea but they both pay for them essentially just that console players get a 2 dollar discount
---
I think she's both fun AND viable, so definitely get her
---
What are those
---
So he still has to have them fully in dream world to injure, right? But the initial hit that brings them in dream won't injure in and of itself? I feel like I'm missing something here.
---
Huntress does seem like the "fun" killer due to her powers design.  She's deff someone I wanted to check out eventually.  Good to know what perks I should head for first.
---
I guess I lied and I have one other question aha.  How grindy is it to unlock new killers/survivors?  I know that will obviously vary depending on how well you play.  But a rough idea of what i'm in for would be nice.
---
Lol yea I suppose i should
---
Wait what? I've seen this a few times now. Is it real?
---
That's one of the things I basically say in the image. (:
---
Believe it or not, it‚Äôs hard to M1 but I‚Äôm still getting 4ks with perkless billy every match.
---
Wait bill not a zombie but he's in the game and doesn't break the no zombie rule.
---
&gt; ~~puking on survivors~~ feeding her hungry little children.
---
why the attitude?
---
Haha sad it wasn't outrageous enough
---
She actually looks kinda cute...and that is scary.
---
Probably because players are still playing Ghostface who came out about 2 weeks ago
---
He can hook me any day.

Holy shit you're like a walking edgybro stereotype

Oh I know.  One of the common complaints I see about the game involves the rank/MM system not being great.  I have seen people mention red/green/black? colors with ranks.  Are those like..tiers basically?
---
THEY üëè ARE üëè COMING üëè THIS üëè SUMMER üëè
---
It wasn‚Äôt attitude.. it just doesn‚Äôt look like anyone I know
---
I'm more so concerned about the survivor side.  Like how the fuck does one loop optimally work touch controls lol?
---
because it‚Äôs not anyone you know. obviously it‚Äôs not a character from the game.
---
Nice new account you got there.
---
Just to be clear, make sure to ask your questions in the linked thread. They won‚Äôt see anything from this post‚Äôs threads.
---
Can you connect a bluetooth controller or no?
---
I think that would cause a lot of problems. Like almost all of my survivors have t3 bt and my stealth Kate has t3 unbreakable. So if they took the teachables away I'd actually lose a lot of my perks. And on a couple characters my only usable perks lol
---
Don't know, don't think so, probably will in the main version since this is a beta

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9ikey/dbd_in_a_nutshell_from_the_bugs_to_the_face/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Thanks but what does that have do with it
---
Well, the whole point of it being PC exclusive originally was due to licensing with Valve specifying that they didn't want it to go on console.
---
It wouldn't have surprised me if you did have to pay for Bill on console, even two years later (though I'm of course glad you don't).
---
Oh I have. I'm a very pensive person. This is meant to be for yourself and other survivors you play with.
---
When I started playing I couldn't figure out how to survive against Freddy. I got so upset every Freddy match. And then i finally downloaded him and then started playing him to a point I was getting Brutal and Merciless killings. 
---
Until the game's matchmaking got weird and I'm going against gen running red levels while I'm a level 12-10 killer
---
Just saying. Just saying.
---
you made him bing his last bong
---
But but.... All swf are orginanized commandos who never gets downed, do gens in 3 minutes and all escapes.
---
Do I have to stay logged into that new account to play?
---
Than why did you also down vote me
---
Seeing your art pop up all day has been a treat. You have a very cute, expressive style consistently good and wholesome ideas for pieces.
---
You should consider going professional (if you aren‚Äôt already).
---
This concept legit gave me chills. I love it.
---
My buddy considers literally the anything that doesn‚Äôt result in an instant win for him in any game *OP*. He complains that the physics in Rocket League is bad. So. I understand. It‚Äôs so hard to shut up when he says that old Freddy is OP.
---
Don't break the illusion. Some people can't handle it
---
Worth a shot, I'll edit this comment if I get it to work 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Never said I did..
---
I started playing like a week ago. I've seen many fellow survivors perkless lol.
---
I bought her recently and I‚Äôm very disappointed. She‚Äôs just to hard to play for me personally, and I‚Äôm not a trash killer either. All my killers are level 40+ with various perks, but spirit is the only killer I‚Äôm personally bad with. She‚Äôs too slow in my opinion and her power is literally a walk in the dark perk. A majority of the community says she‚Äôs a god but I personally cant play with her. Tell me how it goes if you buy her!
---
Shiny wooo‚ú®
---
the dream transition allowed to get an easier first hit tho :( transition mindgames are godlike
---
The console editions are by default about $10.00 more then the PC version, so that splits the difference of having the Doctor/Feng &amp; Hag/Ace DLCs included.
---
I believe you do, but don‚Äôt quote me on that. It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve done something like that haha.
---
You dont have to comment to downvote
---
I reported and blocked. According to him I‚Äôm a bad killer despite the 3k.
---
He is an m1 killer. So you can give him the usual build:
---
Ruin, BBQ and chilli, Spirit fury, NOED, etc.
---
I personally like I'm all ears and discordance. to set ambushes and know when many are together. also  like Spirit fury when using iridescent pin.
---
That sounds lovely the way you word it, but when you have only an hour to play some video games, AND yes, your teammates arent doing anything but crouching around (because yes that absolutely matters what they are doing) there's very good odds if I'm being face camped I'm not sticking around. 
---
It's nice the way you word it but "you" the one on the hook being face camped the entire game,  you're not winning. Hell you're not even playing the game.
---
I have ace in a hole and I need my item
---
No one said you did..

The toxicity, of our city, of our ciiiity!

Who has Bill‚Äôs perks on console now?

Where do you see me saying ''You have to comment to downvote.''
---
Barney suit cosmetic confirmed
---
Now all they need to do is get Sony on board. It‚Äôs a tall task but if they do we could have both crossplay and cross-saves! 
---
If Sony refuses to budge Xbox/PC/Switch/Mobile crossplay/saves is still possible.
---
Yes!
---
Season 2 would explore individual survivors.

In either narrative, a back and forth of fog/flashback scenes to build tension and slowly reveal character motivations and other elements.

You don't have to comment to downvote , you can be silent and downvote
---
I dont mean litterally as a counter, i mean that it is the one of the survivor counterparts to overcharge because it seems like overcharge is on the shrine 9 out of 10 times a month, And bond is one of those perks that is also being thrown into the shrine ALOT
---
Lol "sheltered"
---
Well then that‚Äôs why I was confused

Ah, a fellow man of culture I see

Even PS?! FUCK YEAH

WOW fucking toxic genrush swf

Yea it almost seems like they designed thrilling tremors with his new power in mind

That doesn't show me saying ''You have to comment to downvote'' derpina.

It's his Stando ability. He's about to 360 barrage him with his Dead Hard.

Sally wouldn't happen to be an OP insert who hates the Trapper would she?

why is it not available in the us when the majority of their player base is in the us?

This is some next level memery

Why did you hit me with your car
---
Never said I did
---
Like what are you going on about
---
No, sally is sally smithson, the nurse from the game.
---
Practice, I‚Äôve looped a few trappers it‚Äôs honestly not that hard once you get the hang of it.
---
Not me but while watching a friend play I once saw a survivor get him to follow him to every pallet on the map and throw it down in front of him so they could get in a few seconds of healing while he took the time to break it. He just followed him around until he ran out of pallets then proceeded to down everyone because whenever anyone else went looking for pallets there were none.
---
Just pointing in another direction to either lead me to another survivor or trick me. 
---
I usually down them.
---
He's just trying to get his dailys done
---
The Mid Chapter patch can't get here fast enough. Bill!!!!!
---
Each survivor or killer takes roughly 40 hours, each one is 9000 shards. You could also get the DLCs when there‚Äôs a sale or from g2a, that‚Äôs what I did.
---
The mid chapter patch can't get here fast enough.

I‚Äôm quite sure the skill check for new decisive strike is always 10 o‚Äôclock
---
That still doesn't show me saying ''You have to comment to downvote.''
---
That is frustrating! I am finding that camping is in all ranks. I have seen less of it in purple ranks. I also play on ps4 and pc. I find that the worst killers are on ps4. I really don't know what happen. It use to be that once you got in to green ranks and sometimes rank 13 the camping and tunneling was very rare. I honestly don't play as often because the game experience sucks now.
---
Why didn't they add Bill in the first place ?Sorry i'm out of the loop .
---
No Freddy can hit and injure/down anyone at any time. But if you're at full health and awake, when he hits and injures you it'll also pull you fully asleep
---
Likely due to their deal with Valve/L4D
---
Red - 1-4
---
Purple - 5-8
---
Green - 9-12
---
Yellow - 13-16
---
White - 17-20
---
?
---
Did the only have the rights to put him on PC or what ?
---
Your either saying you have to comment to downvote or your saying something that makes no sense
---
Oh, the name is shelter, not sheltered, just thought the word was funny
---
I wonder if his perks will become unlockable but you keep what you already have on whatever characters.
---
Or if it‚Äôs the same system so you don‚Äôt need him for any reason other then to play him.
---
I'm rank 4 #insultsoutofignorance
---
But, muscle mommy
---
The only game they have is Superman 64, though
---
I feel for him though. I would be super nervous if it was my first time as well. I hope I‚Äôm the future he gets used to being on camera!
---
Honestly. Just makes the game so fucking boring. Soon as I go down and she blinks away I‚Äôm yeeting straight the fuck out
---
New main!
---
Well you all play like rank 18‚Äôs not my fault ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Good thing I was not the only one.
---
Not in terms of gameplay it wouldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think a console player would want to play against a m&amp;k nurse or huntress if they don‚Äôt have to.
---
Yeah I find it hard to believe he‚Äôs getting tunneled ‚Äújust cuz‚Äù
---
I would switch to a stealth playstyle OP, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, avoid the killer entirely.
---
You said I said ''You have to comment to downvote'' and couldn't show me saying that. I said I never said I did meaning believe whatever but I didn't.
---
Everytime I'm in an area with two survivors and I'm chasing let's say the Nea who heads in the opposite direction and then I hear the sound of the pallet the Meg tossed 15 yards behind me.  Quadruple points if it was the God pallet.
---
Not necessarily but usually yes. I‚Äôve had games where survivors are literally from China and have 300+ ping in the same lobby as people with 50 ping.
---
"calm spirit stops you from screaming with Freddy's dream snares right?"
---
In his head: "Oh dear God we forgot about that"

What does that mean

Just simply no.

that sounds like that last year game

Forget old freddy mechanics.  Youre never "awake", its called microsleep now.  He can hit you whenever he wants
---
from BadFishteeth via /r/deadbydaylight sent 11 minutes agoShow Parent
---
But you did - Erm yes you fucking did lmao.
---
Its awful, I dont understand how it became such a popular strat. I‚Äôll play on pc and usually when I die its because I‚Äôm bad because the killers seem to actually play fair but on ps4 they play like idiots. Almost encourages survivors to play toxic in order to get their own back. Just a very vicious cycle of toxicity
---
Stupid and pointless
---
There's no way Sony will allow crossplay through anything but Epic
---
Wait is his rework out already
---
3 gens get 3 gens get done u teabag u die
---
My boooy!
---
You can spawn a fake pallet in the place of a destroyed one, it will vanish the splinters of the real one aswell
---
The camera quality makes it better
---
Not exactly true. Eve Valkyrie, Star Trek Bridge Crew and Warewolves Within are all cross play on PS4 with PC, I've played them. They're VR games, so maybe that has something to do with it, but yeah, cross play exists to an extent beyond Fortnite.
---
Yes it was posted on BHVR's twitter account
---
Logic doesn't work on that guy
---
When did the update go live? I've only been playing this game since Saturday and but have only played against a Freddy once (on Wednesday). All survivors escaped. 0 hooks.
---
The update is not live
---
Seems like the steam summer sale has me covered atm.  I can grab pretty much everyone that was recommended plus 1 or 2 extras and grind out people like spirit while I play.
---
You are NOT being logical lmao
---
I face camped for my 1st time last night when I was playing, I had been playing killer for 3 hours straight for bloodpoints and game after game if I didnt kill everyone, or played poorly, I got bagged at the exit gate. My last match (the one I face camped in) I kept getting bagged by swf and I had just enough of it so I started camping. Shits super annoying to put up with as killer.
---
Oh shit I does
---
This is correct. There is no time where Freddy can't hurt you.
---
Like when you duck around a corner and watch them walk by
---
So colors can be a way to differentiate ranks without being specific.  But you can also describe said rank with a number?
---
I wish I got more Spirits. It's fun to juke her when I  main her and know how to manipulate her and figure out which add-ons she is using.
---
I'm not writing it again when you can just scroll back.
---
CoD Modern Warfare is Cross play...so this is entirely untrue.
---
Pills here!
---
That‚Äôs great! Yeah you should definitely buy the licensed killers/survivors since they‚Äôre on sale.
---
It's true, saving someone who's doomed is one of the greatest DBD feelings. It's just that if it goes wrong you really have no reason to get mad at the killer when you could've and should've just left
---
It would have to be way more difficult like 5 gens done and 4 survivors alive ect. otherwise people will exploit it.
---
Around the same time as Freddy rework shows on the roadmap that‚Äôs when we can start expecting them
---
This goes both ways though. Killers act like they can‚Äôt be toxic other than tunneling or face camping. But what pisses me off more is when killers swat at me on hook, or when they play ghost face or piggy and tbag for a good minute.
---
&gt;I said I never said I did meaning believe whatever but I'm saying I didn't.
---
Not proper English this means nothing
---
They do make the survivor go slower.
---
I use bill on my nye
---
YAY
---
He's the fucking man. I love playing as Grandaddy Bill. I always joke with my friends that you gotta give me a couple minutes to get to you off the hook...my walker didn't teleport into the entitys realm with me. XD
---
Yeah it's pretty fun out mindgaming her but facing almost every other match gets stale.
---
Terrible idea
---
Hi, I'm pretty new, I've only played survivor. Can the killer see what the survivor lobby looks like before the game starts?
---
Yes, colors are just a more general way of referring to them.
---
So this. Last time I played with a perkless rank 20, they were just doing laps around the map with crows above their head lol. I wasn't even mad I was wetting myself that much. We actually all got out somehow.
---
I feel you but with Hillbilly. I faced 7 in a row and called it a day after that.
---
No i don't do that I just watch them die because if they teabag me all bets are off fuck the gens this guy dies and maybe quick teabag then it's off to see if I can get to gen quick enough to salvage something from this delay
---
I mean I see what you're saying for sure, but I would like to point out that keys are very rare to see in game, let alone get real usage, and that you also arent meant to 4k every game.
---
Ouch that's painful. I've had my fair share of Billy days but I don't think I've ever reached 7 before
---
I always go for the person unhooking but sometimes they pull them off when you just hooked them with your back turned then yo turn around and can't find the unhooker because they leave them to die or unluckily you bump into the hooked one looking for someone else and you feel bad.
---
this is too freakin adorable
---
No I will talk all I want deal with it
---
Okay, Thanks for the clarification.
---
I was chasing a Kate who felt like  she had to throw down every single pallets on the map.Thank goodness for Enduring+Spirit Fury
---
What if I were to get on xbox (which I have no progress on) to teach a friend how to play the game
---
No no I can see MCote being in the Purple Ranks and the one standing around not doing much.
---
Also I‚Äôm just breaking his balls not serious!
---
k
---
FUCK YAH! TY BHVR!!! 
---
Take my money!
---
I usually switch between Myers, clown and doctor. I just got Ghostface and spirit so I'm going to try them and see. Being able to play characters with vastly different play styles keeps the game fresh.
---
it‚Äôs my interpretation of the character so sorry but no
---
Coming from you? That's funny cos.. ''Than why did you also down vote me'' ''Wait bill not a zombie but he's in the game''
---
This is such a dog shit idea. I also love your mindset of a survivor getting insta killed by failing a skill check but the killer can just come back after getting killed. What a fucking joke.
---
I'm pretty sure that's kinda the point since he's wearing the Francis cosmetic set.
---
I'm not sure that's the argument in this meme. The way that I see this is that a lot of people on this sub will complain about the hatch, stating that it's a free escape and an "unfair mechanic" for the killer to go against, but when people point out that the killer finding it almost guarentees that last kill for the 4k then suddenly there is an issue.
---
She's easily the least fun killer to play against in the game and it seems a ton of people are back to playing her because of sounds working again. Things like passive phasing, lacking a vault animation, AFK mindgames, and having an absurdly powerful killer power all combined just make an unfun experience. If the Spirit player is good you're basically playing an NPC character in their single player game. 
---
I'd rather play against Omegablink all day than deal with the legions of Spirits lately.
---
Yeah , makes enough sense in contrast to what you wrote
---
Never been a fan of Tru.  I like Monto, Puppers, and Noob3 more
---
Meg looks hideous in here, what's wrong with her face???
---
Claudette looks like she's 20 years older.
---
Sweet!
---
While he did seem very nervous on camera, the dude seems to have some really great passion and good ideas of how the game actually works and what Killers really need to succeed. Always nice to see passionate people in charge of things like the rework.
---

More like F to C.

Classic freddy is amazing but he hasnt aged well. He looks like burnt lasagne and its not spooky

stop crying you play killer game tailored in your favor
---
Don't give devs any ideas, they will see this and think it's actually real. Shit survivors say these days...

Oh wow limited buttons preventing a killer from being really good.  D A R N

It honestly just sounds to me like you're salty that you died

As a pre need Freddy main, this is amazing news

There's a 90% chance I am given my location of urban western canada. Whatever someone did a better explanation of why bill should be in the game.

&gt;I said I never said I did meaning believe whatever but I'm saying I didn't. 
---
Now explain what this means
---
Its a huge fucking improvement, thats what it is.
---
They‚Äôre designed to look like the characters from L4D iirc, since they‚Äôll be getting cosmetics.
---
perfect use of Mista.
---
I can only hope the devs are smarter than this subreddit which unironically believes this is real.
---
Dev response: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/73802/bills-perks#latest
---
Ty it's great innit
---
Then why did they even make a mobile version? The whole point of mobile is to use it wherever and play wherever. Not carry a controller around.
---
I had a similar experience last night. Spawn into the game and the first gen I go to has a Dwight repairing. He gets downed and hooked in record time (seriously about 30 seconds into the game). I actually felt a tad bad for him with getting instantly hooked and all so I decided to patrol gens, sure enough half way to the next gen he gets unhooked. I go back and this guy was still in the area! He leads me on maybe a 1 minute chase and tries to loop me around a 10 foot t wall!! He gets a couple loops in thru the window and I down and hook him. I think to myself man that was really u fortunate for him he‚Äôs got one hook left! Go to patrol gens and he gets unhooked half way to the gen so I turn around. When I return to the hook nobody is there so I do my usual sweep of the area checking the back corners and such. I find nothing and go to leave the area when I hear something... what was that? A survivor coughing behind the tiniest little wall in the whole area. I think to myself ‚ÄúI hope that isn‚Äôt the same guy‚Äù ... it was. He tried to loop me around a 10 foot section of wall again! He goes down pretty quick and does on the hook. His team falls shortly after multiple hooks each and I get a mountain of crying salt in the chat afterwards. Sorry homie but I can say ive never triple hooked a survivor faster than that and I wasn‚Äôt even trying to do it!
---
Maybe, that stuff just gets everywhere. But I have seen clown at 5 in a few peoples tier lists. He shuts down loops pretty hard.
---
yes, the killer can see who you're playing, what cosmetics you have, and what item you're bringing, if any.
---
you've got to be fucking kidding me
---
Nah i dont care if i die but if its because they just stare at me waiting for me to die then its bullshit
---
So... this will be free... right?
---
Theres annoying shit on either side thats the problem
---
Ikr it looks like they couldnt come up with a good idea for him so they just grabbed a couple random mechanics from other killers and sloppily mashed them together.
---
Ok thanks, that's a big let down for me :/
---
What?
---
They haven‚Äôt confirmed but it‚Äôs safe to say it will be.
---
Looking at Susie nudes definitely makes sense there as she is ~16 üòÇ
---
Really? Interesting, I think the new Freddy looks like a frog. Not just in dbd but in the 2010 remake as well. I still think OG Freddy is perfect.
---
It‚Äôs true, for the most part.  Super skilled Billy‚Äôs who can curve immensely well can beat good teams.  SWF maybe not, but with addons has a chance to 2K if they make any mistakes
---
''There's a 90% chance I am given my location of urban western canada'' - LMFAO THAT MAKES NO SENSE ITSELF!
---
I certainly hope so. Zoeys outfit for Meg is amazing
---
1-(.96√ó.96√ó.96)=.115 or 11.5%. I just rounded
---
Was this a projection TV?
---
Even PS4?
---
Most likely
---
The head is just a mask. It was in the movies as well and they weren't supernatural. Regarding having 4 (or was it 5?) RBTs is the usual "black hole inventory" kind of solution to make it, you know, playable. Like GTA or actually most of the games these days. I don't think GF \*needs\* those floating things to be playable.
---
Not saying they are ugly of course. GF is currently one of the most killers to have fun with and he looks cool af.
---
Okay, that makes it better. She just looks so much... odd to me. I'm too used to her normal looks.
---
Do you download it from the taptap website? I tried and it said I needed a Norway itunes account.
---
What if there was a super op ultra rare add-on where he gets to place one dream generatorüòÇ
---
BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY
---
About a year ago around the time I quit (im.back now) 
---
I spawned into a game where the survivors  were basically simulating sex acts
---
By far one of the strangest matches I've ever seen
---
It better not be Xbox Exclusive or I'm gonna cry.
---
Like 10% of Western urban Canada is French or other and I'm not french.
---
Freddy is not OP. Playing as him I understand how much you have to work with him to get any sacrifices. He can be fun, otherwise I would have stopped playing him, but you have to work him so much while also trying not to tunnel
---
I meant a perk that helps you not get hit as in, HELPS, like for instance, well yeah, BL, if you get 50% of the maps, you can prolong chases and avoid being hit, you'll still get hit eventually, but well, getting hit, being hooked, nothing matters so long as you get out. If you can get your chases to last longer, getting hit doesn't matter. Okay, back to SC. If your in red ranks atm, how is it going to help, if you dont think opening a chest with pharmacy(yes, i know you dont have it) wastes too much time, why would you run SC when you know how useful ANY time is to the killer? And if it is red ranks, well, survivors there aren't stupid(mostly), they'll heal you, because they want to get out &amp; that's 1 extra hit the killer might have to do before they get to them. If you NEED healing at any time, head to a gen you've worked on, or just listen out for gens, finding survivors isn't that hard, and if everyone else is on the other side of the map, enjoy you 50% on a gen.
---
Don't take it personally, if I see a headcount of 4, then I'm smacking anyone who gets close and going back to camping you.
---
I say remove the addons that give her extra blinks
---
Realistically everyone who has it on a survivor already should be able to keep it and the for future survivors who come out afterwards would need to get it though a teachable. It‚Äôs odd, but I don‚Äôt think Bhvr will remove three perks from every console survivor and make them level up bill and do it all over again on all those survivors.
---
It was more of a joke but good to see your sense of humor is still dead and crumbling. It would be too strong, and give him too many tools. Be glad we get it in addon form at all, that's already a unique aspect of his new power. And he will be fine with just 1 of those abilities, both are good at slowing people down. Try to (I know it's hard for you) think critically about this and you'll see that.
---
ah shit, i thought the rework wasn't gonna affect me at all since i don't use him but i forgot about the queues.
---
;(
---
Autodidact for life man once you get your  last token you heal someone in a second
---
The reason why only one gen is required is to make it more of a decision, Having it set to 5 gens will just allow players to multi task 24/7 which pretty much defeats the purpose.  
---
Personally I don‚Äôt see any thing wrong with the option, Maybe you need to fix All of the generators without opening the door while having everyone spend a certain amount of time in the basement to displease the Entity. After a hoop or two more there will be an endgame collapse but for the Killer- Unless he is able to hook someone
---
For sure, I have a ton of time on both sides.

---
&gt;Is there a second dlc you think I should nab along side it? I can say that spirit looks very fun to me. But i'm not sure what she brings to the table add on wise nor what the survivor that comes with her does.
---
Spirit is a very fun killer but she is a bit challenging to learn and master. If you're willing to put in the time, she's incredibly interesting and a very strong killer! Her perks are strong as well, Spirit Fury especially.
---
Adam Francis is the survivor that comes with The Spirit. He has one strong perk, one interesting perk, and one bad perk. Deliverance is great and Diversion is fun, but Autodidact is hardly worth using. However, even that perk can be interesting if you build around it.
---
All in all, Shattered Bloodlines is a great DLC with a very solid (albeit challenging) killer, some strong perks, and some interesting perks. It's worth the money!
---
&gt;Is there anything else I should be aware of with M&amp;K play besides rebinding?
---
No that's about it! Other than how you have a greater option of what type of keyboard or mouse you'd like to use vs controllers on a console, you've pretty much got it.
---
&gt;So when I level up a character do I lose the stuff I was using in the prior blood web?
---
When you hit Level-10, The Entity wakes up and begins to take items from the Bloodweb. Starting then you will not be able to get everything in your Bloodwebs. The Entity only starts to take from a Bloodweb either when you've grabbed one perk and there's another perk in the web (it starts with the perk you did not grab), or when you've bought 6 things from your Bloodweb. When a Bloodweb is completed (ie. nothing else can be bought from it), it's refreshed and a new one is generated.
---
Unless you mean the things in your inventory. Once you buy something from a Bloodweb, it gets sent to your inventory. The only time you would lose any items from there is if you would use them or if you Prestige your character.
---
&gt;Besides freddy and ghost face are there any other licensed killers?
---
Yes! There's 3 others.
---
The Shape, aka Michael Myers, is a licensed killer included with Laurie Strode as a survivor in the Halloween DLC.
---
The Pig, aka Amanda Young, is a licensed killer included with Detective Tapp as a survivor in the SAW DLC.
---
And The Cannibal, aka Leatherface, is a licensed killer in the Leatherface DLC. He does not come with any survivor.
---
&gt;When you say putting points into you're referring to blood points yes? So you're saying you wish you mastered teachables on a survivor before moving to another survivor and putting points in that one?
---
Yes this is exactly what I meant! I wish I had invested Bloodpoints into getting another character's teachables so I could've gotten them sooner on a character I really liked.
---
&gt;Also one final question because I forgot to ask it in my post. I hear "totem" a lot. Can you explain what those do for a killer? I thought it might be add on but its something on the map that can be cleansed. So i've never understood what it is.
---
Totems are props that spawn on every map. There are 5 on every map. They have randomized locations and can be cleansed by survivors, breaking them. Normally they are Dull Totems and do nothing. However, if a killer brings a special perk called a Hex perk into a trial, it lights one of the 5 Dull Totems and makes it a Hex Totem.
---
 Cleansing a Hex Totem removes that Hex perk's effect for the remainder of the trial. The only Hex perk that isn't lit at the beginning of the match is No One Escapes Death. This Hex perk is unique in the sense that it will only activate and light a Totem once all the generators have been completed. It's a very powerful perk and an example as to why even cleansing a Dull Totem can be useful.
---
Not sure. I havent played mobile so I dont know how awkward the controls are, but I'm sure people will get used to it. It's still really new so we need to give it a chance.
---
It has to be an ultra rare item and you must get it through the entire trial
---
It‚Äôs more that the minute anybody posts anything relating to jojos, we all just come out of the woodwork to shitpost about it
---
I was already dead. When i went to spectate they were standing still already.
---
They tried to make him viable while giving him powers consistent with his universe's lore
---
It's hard learning a new language and having to explain it with the added stress of a livestream. Props to him for being courageous.
---
I'd rather face a spirit then have a teammate disconnect for a 5th game in a row. Oh wait, both of those happens. Often.
---
The real question is are they going to put the Bill face on Unbreakable?
---
Just on this subreddit? This is the best meme I‚Äôve seen on reddit period.
---
Lol what‚Äôs a jojo?
---
Yeah that's happening on PS4, hope they fix it soon
---
I wouldn't use the speed add on that reduces charges with the green med kit, at that point you may as well bring a styptic agent. I'd use either more charges (which will be an extra heal cuz of BK) or the speed increaser that makes skill checks "harder" although you still wont miss them because it really doesnt change anything.
---
id rather guarantee the person on the hook doesnt get out than have a chance at finding the hatch.
---
Welcome to DBD!
---
Just checked some of ur post u didn't know that whispers activates on hooked survivors lol and ur calling me a rank 20
---
Do people actually think this dude is being for real lmao....
---
OBVIOUS sarcasm
---
Big nippled Persians
---
It‚Äôs clearly photoshopped
---
I wonder why is the no official word on this yet
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main have barely touched killer
---
Except for the part where you cannot teleport to finished/blocked gens. At that point it's more of a soft BBQ&amp;Chili as far as I can tell
---
Ahahahahahahaha maybe that's why he was F tier this entire time!
---
Buk Lau? Is that you?
---
running solidarity lul
---
How is that 6gigs?
---
If anything, he‚Äôs just way more annoying now and his power is actually somewhat of a threat.  I still think there will be no real reason to wake up, though.  It takes too much time and there‚Äôs no adverse effects to being asleep, unless there are add-ons to slow things down when you‚Äôre asleep, or if the Freddy is good with traps.
---
Lol.. not that sort of asian
---
He loses all of his map pressure when it's arguably most important. It works as incentive to keep pressure on the survivors while they still need to be working gens, rather than when the gates are opened
---
Listen me out everyone what if they gave legion a hunter outfit from lfd2 he has the body of the hunter and the hoodie
---
And the way u talked about ur teammates ur rank can't be that good
---
How can something be a challenge if I do it every night.
---
Along with the outfits for other characters?
---
rip your flair
---
Ahh, I see it written as both but sheltered woods more often. I‚Äôll have to pay more attention to the correct names
---
Will there be Shirtless Myers anytime soon?
---
at that point, it‚Äôs still a challenge, just a very easy one
---
When is the update scheduled?
---
Gen rushing is legit the strat against poor sweaterboi
---
Seems like he has the potential to be the best 3 gen killer in the game since distance between gens wont matter as much to him.
---
Explain please
---
Same I would pay him to
---
I thought he did fine
---
No one is gonna remember every permutation of perks/add-ons which could possible affect Freddy‚Äôs three powers
---
I think breaking totems and looting chests should also award survival points.
---
I ACCIDENTALLY saw the title as "sally is going to fucking Evan"... I shouldn't browse Reddit in midnight
---
LOOOL
---
Unless you get a bullshit pallet stun
---
What, nah dude who cares, it's not like you said the Moaning Storehouse lol
---
As someone who definitely understands what it's like to feel uncomfortable and nervous with public speaking, I think he did very well. When I watched the stream, I suppose that it did cross my mind that he wasn't as comfortable or experienced as the other two guys on camera, but there was never a point where I felt bad that he was bombing or whatever. Good show.
---
As far as the Freddy rework goes, I'm bummed to lose the global aura reading, but I understand why they did this, and the new power seems pretty interesting.
---
Fuck you those skillcheck points are mine
---
He is supposed to be asian
---
The toxicity
---
From A to B or C
---
Well thanks man. Didn‚Äôt expect an essay but welcome nonetheless.
---
Left behind is a completely busted perk though.
---
I killer main but I do/did use to survive with friends a lot with my wife - and I just can't think of an equivalent experience for killers to a survivor being mercilessly tunneled.
---
Like gen-rushing is shitty, toxic survivers are shitty, highly co-ordinated SWF teams can wreck you but being mercilessly tunneled + camped as a survivor is essentially the killer deciding you don't get to play. I honestly can't think of an equivalent for a killer main - it feels like you always have something to do even if you're losing horribly. Like if a survivor is really good at looping you can just go after someone else. If they're gen-rushing you can chase them around a bit and then just open the exit gate to tell them to bugger off. If their a co-ordinated SWF there's still a chance someone will screw up and you can get a hook. As much as I sometimes feel bullied as a killer, I never feel like I'm never given the chance to play a game (excluding stupid bugs like the recent Wake Up perk disaster and getting stuck in a pallet).
---
Killers are supposed to be OP though. That‚Äôs kinda the point. They‚Äôre supposed to be super strong and have all the advantages. Plus you earn more BP as killer so that‚Äôs why I tend to play them more. Survivor is fun because I like to make the game challenging for myself and it‚Äôs just really nice to loop a killer for a while and watch your team pop gens. Both types offer different rewards mentally, but they are definitely similar. Love this game
---
Buffalo Bill! Would you do me? I‚Äôd do me. I‚Äôd do me so hard.
---
Is the beta running already?
---
Love this
---
So add-ons don't work? Cause in the achievement description it says it also works with add-ons.
---
When you use a mist offering in real life

All of these Scary Movie memes are just solidifying my need of a Brenda survivor.

Haha thanks Kyle, it‚Äôs always fun to get that grabüòÇ
---
If you guys like the Video let me know we have alot of innuendo moments and funny bits
---
I'm pretty sure SWF would abuse it.
---
Closr the app via console button on xbox, or. crash thegame via task manager.
---
This is always the best feeling though. 
---
‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a huntress, at least she chasing him. Wait he went down in one hit? Aw shit. Welp, guess we‚Äôll die, better get these totem points‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs a good thing the comment you replied to said it wouldn‚Äôt count for SWF groups huh, bud?
---
i would love to see janes backstory
---
Bold of you to assume this would be difficult.
---
maybe the challenge should be to restrain yourself from jacking off to it
---
Wow that's so good!!
---
Survivors are all about perks. Sure killers need perks too, but a naked killer has a better chance than a naked survivor
---
That was the only thing in this thread I did not see.
---
fuck
---
&gt;Nowadays, it's just a term killers use as an excuse for their inability to put out enough map pressure. 
---
"JuST AppLy PrESsuRe" is so fucking stupid. Shows you're a survivor main I guess.
---
He may have been nervous, but this guy seems really fucking smart. Knows what ideas to shut down and remembers the ideas he tested months before and knows how the game works for killers and survivors. I am actually really glad he‚Äôs on the team, don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôd do without him.
---
Thanks it took me 4 hours to make it
---
It‚Äôs the comment you replied to lmao 
---
It happens, we all have space out moments
---
How the fuck did they manage to get Valve to give the likeness to PlayStation?! Xbox yeah I get it but PlayStation 4 what the duck?
---
You can genrush and bodyblock without teabagging, flashlighting and being obnoxious
---
Thanks
---
And sprints away immediately after blowing the gen, leaving you to deal with the killer when he arrives.
---
That's awesome you got skill
---
They said there will be addons to slow action speed but that it won‚Äôt be near 50% like it is now
---
Nah theres people without any type of balls out there too
---
Cringe
---
Well this is a very very good Drawing! I really like it man continue on with the cool artwork.
---
I see the joke with the dead hard and I don‚Äôt like it
---
Thanks alot
---
Wow, 4 perks at rank 20, that seems like a SWF that specifically bullies low rank killers, that's scummy as hell
---
Same lol.
---
I still use doctor to farm points but Spirit has been my favorite the past couple months.  I can get a 4k the majority of my matches with her because her chase and mindgame potential is just so strong. 
---
But then I depip like crazy because I decide to start playing killers I either have crap perks on or am not experienced with. But it does make the game more interesting and that's preferable to just mindlessly ranking.
---
This is not an issue.
---
As a solo survivor more often than not games will snowball entirely in the killer‚Äôs favor, either right away or at endgame. It is very rare that all 4 escape and typically only one will escape due to the hatch. Two escapes is uncommon and mostly the killer will 3-4k.
---
Ruin is extremely effective against solo players as they‚Äôre either all looking for the totem or they can‚Äôt bother to hit the great skill checks. Not the killer‚Äôs fault but Ruin against solo groups can be very oppressive especially if they have good totem RNG, or a map like Game.
---
Not to mention the killers that aren‚Äôt afraid to use some of the controversial tactics like slugging or camping, doing this effectively can halt even a pretty decent group and change the tide of the game.
---
I do pretty well as killer though I‚Äôm rusty but as a solo survivor I will say that I find killer to be easier to play. I don‚Äôt agree with the rhetoric that survivor is easy, relaxing, brainless chill-out mode. Maybe with friends and you all know what you‚Äôre doing. Solo is hardcore mode and a string of bad games is still demoralizing.
---
I think a lot of killers tend to only remember their bad games, and many times killers have accused me and my teammates of being SWF when we were all solo. I‚Äôm willing to bet a lot of killers in red ranks would agree that they can 3-4k pretty consistently. 4-man SWF groups make up only a very small percentage of the player base.
---
Didn't he also had some cube things for survivors to wake up?
---
Didn't that also made him a little bit of pig?
---
I don‚Äôt think it will be for anyone tbh
---
No it won't affect any perks UNLESS YOU PRESTIGE. If you prestige it won't show in your blood-web.
---
Its the art on the shirt not sweat lol
---
Finally.  I hope I can also get Jake's biker outfit now on consoles.
---
No unless you prestige
---
But It says 9 hooks gets iredescent so that 3 survivors twice and one survivor 3 times
---
You just described Hillbilly.
---
It just won't appear in the new bloodwebs after the patch until you learn it on Bill.
---
They do lmao
---
No shit sherlock
---
doing the opposite would be much harder
---
Imagine Nurse gameplay... üòÇ
---
Not unless you prestege. Or there gunna add new ones. That would be dope.
---
I haven't played old Freddy since I got him to III-50 on my old account so it'll be nice to start anew as new Freddy
---
OMEGALUL
---
Made me giggle reading that. 
---
When I first heard gen tp in the anni-stream, I thought "man that new perk would be broken", now we hear "cant tp to blocked gens" feels goodman
---
RIP CI Freddy.
---
Huntress and (I know I'm sorry) Legion.....but Susie ^^
---
He was using his non dominant hand, less power, less accuracy.
---
I found that to be true too
---
Shirtless Stefan skin when
---
Yea those pastes are a work of art
---
Yea, I will probably do the same as I did with ghostface and take a week long brake.
---
üòÇ
---
I think it's a good way to spend your time couse this is realy cool and i loce it please continue posting your art
---
I switch between Plague and Clown, would main Pig but I can't get ruin with her for some reason.
---
Rank 3 and that‚Äôs with me barely playing
---
Myers
---
David is fucking Jake on daily basis in my game.
---
Yep, got announced on the Twitter
---
This freddy is holding out on his power. Now if we had THE Freddy? No one would live. From making himself into a giant worm, to teleportation anywhere, to some.. messed up dream where he makes someone a giant cockroach and squashes it like a dry juicebox
---
But this would make the perk similar to Devour. I think it needs to be reworked so it at least needs to be worked up to and not to be just given randomly
---
We've been waiting for months now (years for licensed skins), and MOBILE gets them before pc
---
Thanks it's nice too see that people enjoy what I make
---
why does everyone hate no mither builds ?
---
Well, any killer lol
---
what a toxic build too
---
Ps4: algiuz
---
Want only one thing from you, do the gens. Rank doesn't matter.
---
CoUntEr pLaY
---
Freddy all day every day
---
That might be pretty good too actually. Making sure the killer earned it throughout the match instead of just handing it to them. Maybe hitting survivors gives you a token, and each token increases attack recovery in the late game? Ahhh idk
---
Lmao when is it possible to actually use the damn perk, since there‚Äôs so much counter play to it now.
---
Challenge complete. Next?
---
^(except in the l4d canon he literally is left behind)
---
Yeah ik. I can see why Devs dont really want to mess with it
---
That just makes me wish for accordian arm freddy with Mr tickle arms
---
Add we'll make it and you're basically Medic Sonic
---
masturbate to ‚ÄúFreddy Darn‚Äù
---
OHHHH I THOUGHT THAT WAS A MONKEY I WAS SO CONFUSED
---
True tbh
---
I bet John fears this lasagne
---
Huntress and Clown, but I wanna start playing Nurse again
---
&gt; When I started chasing Jake (obvious SWF)
---
I'm afraid I don't understand the correlation here? You started chasing the Jake and immediately could determine that they were a SWF because.... you have supernatural powers and could just get this information out of thin air?
---
if you have ds active the killer cant drop you, unless you missed ds
---
I mostly play survivor these days but when I do killer I'll play Spirit or occasionally Plague.
---
Don't get me wrong, I totally understand where you are coming from, but killers need to be able to counter some of the perks that survivors have. Between 4 survivors, they get a total of 16 perks and if there are 4 D'S' then all that time just that perk wastes for a killer could be a generator or 2 easy. Plus survivors can also counter killer perks like ruin. Tapping gens shuts down ruin pretty hard wether you cleanse the totem or not. It's just the way it is I guess. The more room for counterplay on both sides, the more skillful players can do well on both sides :)
---
&gt; Freddy Darn
---
Damn. Now THERE'S a challenge!!!!!
---
Spirit is my favorite to play hands down. Sometimes I‚Äôll play the Hag and Wraith, too.
---
Have you taken a look at the peeks hes using?! Doesnr seem like a good player to me...
---
Ghost Face is my favorite and the last killer I'll ever play. The rest of the cast is in retirement for me :)
---
I gotchu bb
---
Ah thank you. I didn‚Äôt have the chance to hit it before he dropped me, and I wasn‚Äôt lagging either. It‚Äôs just weird.
---
If you think BNPs are anywhere near as strong as they used to be you're terribly misinformed. They aren't even worth 5k in their current state let alone 7k.
---
It runs decently for a beta. I‚Äôve had a few matches as survivor and its pretty fun.
---
Okay, then wait until tier 2 before looking for the Hatch. Close the Hatch first if you know where it is. This Killer probably didn't know it was right there. Make sure to keep an eye on your prey, do stuff while you wait, anytime you see them start an attempt you go back.. etc. There's a lot of different ways to play, still get points, guarantee a kill, and not be a dick all at the same time.
---
you're confusing
---
Botany, Ace in the hole, Pharmacy, and Plunderer's. Bonus if you're ballsy enough: if you get hit immediately stop to heal and point away from the killer to tell him to go away
---
Of course I do, that door opening doesn't make it a good pallet
---
For sure. I get it. I really really do. But it's a neverending vicious cycle if we just accept it as an eye for an eye. "Its okay this time because someone in the past teabagged" No. You're now just as shitty as the teabagger. Someone needs to be the bigger person otherwise everyone forever has an excuse to be an asshole because someone else was an asshole. It's just a shitty situation....
---
*happily oinks*
---
No one million is the cap
---
what‚Äôs confusing about it? It‚Äôs not a character from the game, it‚Äôs an original character.
---
I‚Äôm al for counterplay on both sides, don‚Äôt get me wrong haha. I‚Äôm just salty that the first time I get to use DS I didn‚Äôt get the chance because he just dropped me.
---
"ok, he's chasing me, go save him". The others were injured, they aren't going for it unless they know it's safe, and I was still within terror radius. Only one making saves close to the hook was the cocky ass red rank. 
---
Seeing a lone rank 4 with green ranks after the match was just confirmation.
---
Why is NOED such a big deal? Billy gets instadowns and super speed all game, NOED adds instadowns to an M1 killer at the very end of the game
---
I don't think she hates Phillip
---
Please rework my bing bong mori :(
---
she hates everyone and everything
---
Lullaby might be good on him tho.
---
not too sure how M&amp;A will work, since his lullaby is permanent in dream, and lullaby =/= TR rn.
---
Surveillance and PGTW would also work a charm.
---
So BBQ, Surv, PGTW, X
---
Guess we will see about X
---
I wanna know how Blood Warden and Remember Me work now.
---
Botany is pretty strong but I wouldn't dismiss self care. My primary build is self-care with a medkit that can do two heals minimum plus scissors or suture. Escaping two chases per game and getting a 15 second heal is usually enough. However self-care has saved me tons of times when it's a long game and my medkit is depleted.  Self-care protect you against Franklin's too. 
---
Ideally medkit + botany + self care is a great combo if you have perk slots. But I wouldn't risk botany + medkit alone.
---
I love when the killer looks in the direction of the pointing, then looks back.
---
But they're a couple
---
Hello Hollywood
---
they‚Äôre not
---
It's because of the way textures are set up, you can see people's hair through fog and even fire in fire barrels, so it happens for auras too because why would anything make sense in this game
---
I've seen perkless R20 killers, but never perkless R20 survivors.
---
I‚Äôm new to killer but I‚Äôve been playing Myers and Ghostface a lot. I‚Äôd consider Ghostface to be a main.
---
Every time I‚Äôm a killer it‚Äôs always the rank 20 that claims I have a lag switch and disconnects ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I guess it's just my preference.
---
I don't like instaheals because they feel dickish and I know the feeling. I typically only need 3 heals at most in a match. Abdominal Dressings reduces the the time needed by nearly 2 seconds. The other add-on you speak will still only give 3 heals unless you hit like 3 great skill checks. And seeing as how that's RNG based I don't like to rely on it (that's why I didn't add Autodidact and it also makes the 1st or even 2nd heal take up to 27 seconds if the killer has Sloppy Butcher and you don't get positive skillchecks). Bandages give you 4.75 heals which is one more full heal. A Gauze Roll instead gives 5.1 heals. 5 heals is usually overkill unless you're attempting to go for Mettle of Man or WGLF stacks which is not my playstyle.
---
Turns into a sacrificial hook upon completion, Freddy can teleport for a 1-hit and hang them.
---
When killers don't know, or assume you have it. It's pretty situational now, which is okay imo
---
It shouldn't be a get out of jail free card
---
What, just cuz he blacc? Naw! Clearly he meant to be Jake cuz a de cowboah hat bruh
---
Np, pig can be sneaky too
---
So what you're saying is i move 5% faster and recover from missed attacks quicker?
---
Gasp that's the best change I've ever heard.
---
They literally are though, the devs made it canon a while ago.
---
that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone has to ship it lmao
---
What‚Äôs confusing is they are clearly trying to get you to say who it is, and you are answering evasively.
---
But now there are dream pallets too
---
Or maybe they have eyes and could see you starting to chase someone else before saving? And also if you were playing hag then they were most likely crouching to the hag in order to not set off a trap and were waiting under the terror radius toned down a bit. 
---
Solo teams can be coordinated too sometimes.
---
because it‚Äôs my own character, so what difference does it make if I say the name or not? nobody cares about someone‚Äôs original character lol
---
Let them do, they are improving society! + I needed more salt on my steak.
---
Oh Ok that's fine I was just curious
---
Idk how any swf can just go in to the game with the sole purpose of holding M1 on a gen the while game. 
---
My swf literally just fucks around and BT hook trade for those sweet wglf stacks.
---
This would be really awesome.
---
Oh, so you have supernatural powers and got that information out of thin air?
---
Good boy Valve.
---
No no, I agree with you. I just thought in this situation, before I was able to use it, I got dropped. Which I am being told isn‚Äôt supposed to happen? I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I read your sarcasm just fine. Butthurt killers just butthurt lol.
---
If survivors are working on a gen it won't become blocked
---
Well, it took until last post for you to even say that.  I think all they wanted was to hear, ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs just my own character.‚Äù
---
By the way, fun art style.  Reminds me a touch of the show Hilda.
---
How is it toxic to play altruistically? I get the teabagging and flashlight clicking but... playing altruistically? Say what?
---
Exactly. Makes you wonder how many survivors you miss as killer too.
---
Not my proudest wank ever.
---
images that you can hear
---
Shit dude I just saw the reactions. Wow
---
I know how to close the game, I'm just wondering if it's an issue with other people or if it's just my game
---
It's canon and there's evidence of it in-game. Sorry it doesn't blend with your fantasy head-canon. You don't have to like it for it to be true
---
ÔΩ¢ F R E D D Y  R E Q U I E M ÔΩ£
---
I think getting the proc to do the skill check resets the skill timer, counting the skill as "gone off". So just unfortunate timing I guess
---
because people tend to mock people for including their own characters in art with canon characters. didn‚Äôt want to deal with it.
---
Lol you guys are ridiculous, Literally you are just showing me subreddits why? I am not 14 and why is me being mixed race make me edgy?. What the hell lol.
---
You have no idea what I hear from s tier free win killer mains.
---
Wow, I thought the cosmetics for meg only had a resemblance to Zoey on accident, and would joke about that. Gee, egg on my face for sure.
---
I just don't see the point in making such crass assumptions simply because they made a safe unhook. It's totally possible for survivors to play smart even without communication.
---
Nope. Once you have the game downloaded you can log back in to your regular account.
---
Finally, no more invisible Claudettes, I love it already
---
There's a mobile version?
---
Fair enough.  Don‚Äôt sweat it though, if the art‚Äôs as good as this it‚Äôs not a big deal, and if someone is hung up on that it‚Äôs their own fault.  Keep making cool art and don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself!
---
If they don‚Äôt destroy a single totem. The current version gives you a 4% speed buff NO MATTER WHAT.
---
okay but it literally doesn‚Äôt matter. If someone doesn‚Äôt want to ship it, they don‚Äôt have to. If you like the ship, you‚Äôre entitled to like it. I don‚Äôt like it, so I don‚Äôt have to ship it. You don‚Äôt have to shove it down people‚Äôs throats.
---
Michael Myers
---
Back in the day it was Leatherface but I‚Äôm holding off on him till I get the build I want on other Killers then I‚Äôll proceed to T3 him.
---
I haven‚Äôt played Myers in a bit but he‚Äôs usually my main. 
---
When I last played about a week or so ago I played quite a bit of Ghostface. It was fun playing him. 
---
What killer do I want to main next? Well I‚Äôve always been interested in the Doctor so I‚Äôm working on a build for him. 
---
What killer do I wish I was good at? The plague, I always thought the plague was cool and obviously beautiful.
---
I dont think its overpowered, it‚Äôs just uninteractive.
---
im not, im complaining about people who use ds and say noed is too op
---
How did you get the mobile version already?
---
I‚Äôve gotten a lot of flak on other websites about drawing OCs with canon characters, so I get a bit defensive. The person initially came off kind of rude the way they asked it, so I just wanted to not be bothered
---
I thought the new DS was designed to run during the pick up making dribbling useless
---
Billy requires a bit of skill to get a insta down though. It takes little to nothing to have gens pop, and M1 instadown someone you were chasing. 
---
I don‚Äôt think NOED is a massive deal, but it does suck for solo survivor players, and when you loop the killer all game, or just the fact that the killer has no kills, and could easily get a 4k because of 1 perk. 
---
I think either a totem counter or a rework would be nice. But who knows, seems survivor perks can be reworked all the time, but killer perks get more buffs or nerfs rather than overall reworks.
---
No one asked you your opinion lol
---
no, billys chainsaw is a good weapon
---
I'm not a fan of Autodidact. I've been screwed too much by this perk for it to be reliable. I get one or 2 skill checks and it hindered me instead. I even ran into a David with We'll Make It and Autodidact and the 2 skillchecks prevented me from fully healing and the killer ended up downing me. I prefer Botany because it's reliable, it works on myself, and it gives med-kits more flexibility.
---
If I want really fast heals I just use Botany and We'll Make It for really fast heals for a minute and a half.
---
While playing ghostface and the going to t bag them
---
Legion detected, activating butthurtsurvivor.exe
---
If there is one thing I have learned about this community is that they will always find something to complain about. It‚Äôs not even out yet. And from the little they did show he looks great. Yes he has the powers of a couple killers out together, but ya know it works. It worked for ghostface. And I could not be more excited to try him out. People need to calm down, for real.
---
I really really want Englund's version as a cosmetic head option
---
Your future survivors will require the teachable. Your characters with it already stay the same.
---
Hey curious, i didn't know this was canon. Can you link me where the devs say it? Id love to see how they did it.
---
That begs the question of if we have one of bills perks like borrowed time on a character will we keep it even if we don‚Äôt have bills teachable?
---
Quite argueably I don‚Äôt think the Exposed effect is what makes NOED amazing. I think it‚Äôs the 4% of mms.
---
There it is. The comment I was waiting for.
---
what does saying ‚Äúcringe‚Äù accomplish for you other than being disrespectful and making yourself look like a dick?
---
Likely stay the same, hit sleeping Survivors.
---
Fair enough I get skillchecks like crazy so autodidact really helps my healing speed up. sure I‚Äôll sometimes get 2 tokens for it but one heal knocks the first 2 out quick enough
---
That‚Äôs what I thought too, and that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work too. But in my case, the killer had picked me up, and before I could hit the skill check, he dropped me. I wasn‚Äôt lagging either. Just a weird situation.
---
In some regions. Not in USA tho. You can change your region on your phone and download it tho.
---
Or a caterpillar who blows smoke in someone's face for a trip-out death
---
its ok, we've all done this at some point.
---
Never said hitting the unhooked survivor was tunneling. Just that it's not actually the best play.
---
It depends on my lobby. If no one brings items I just pick a standard yellow kit at like the last 10 seconds and that's 2 heals with Botany. Pharmacy as one my slots if I don't bring a kit.
---
I struggle against all killers, I know your pain lol, I'm pretty new at survivor, I mostly play killer.
---
The thing that really sucks about Leatherface is that when revving his chainsaw he slows down to 86.25% speed, unlike the Hillbilly's 92%, which is the same as carrying a survivor, this makes it so the survivor you're chasing can easily out run you if you don't have any charge speed or charge time add-ons.
---
Even then his chainsaw run isn't that great, it only boosts you to 126.5% movement speed at max, which it has to build up to, so you better be on a survivors ass or they'll be able to out run your chainsaw sweep, and if you run into an object, which can just happen because the chainsaw hitbox is really fucked, you slow down to 11.5% speed and flail your chainsaw around.
---
All around he's a pretty mediocre killer who succeeds more in M1ing most of the time than he does using his power, as it takes a lot of work to make it work right and even then it can be screwed up easily with them dropping a pallet or going through a window or et cetera, and that sucks because I really think is power is super cool.
---
Calling JoJo a r/circlejerk when that's an almost direct quote from it.
---
Looks far better than 2010's melted American cheese face
---
I‚Äôm all for changing noed but this perk would be useless.
---
Wait there is 5 survivors? New game mode?
---
Exactly this. All of the gens you wouldn't want to teleport to would be blocked making it really easy for freddy to chain.
---
Ds activates when you tunnel the injured survivor
---
Noed activates after doing nothing and hoping that the survivors didnt do totems.
---
Adrenaline for example activates as a reward that your team did the objective and you stayed alive for that time.
---
There was official word. Check the dbd mobile twiter.
---
They said he can only port to useable gens so he won't be able to port during EGC.
---
Ok here we go again guys, calm the pitchforks:
---
The rank 2 is in a SWF with 2 or all 3 of the other players. The low rank survivors are new. 
---
There are not many players at your rank because survivors cannot rank down once they reach rank 15. The player base at rank 15-20 is much smaller then above rank 15. 
---
You are a rank 20 killer. You are literally the lowest possible rank. *Everyone* you play against is likely to have more playtime than you. You got a kill. **You're new. You're gonna get bopped a few times.** Take your fucking licks and improve instead of bitching about it online.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/bwuxzx/leaked_sounds_dont_match_ghostface_pinhead/
---
Just these sound leaks. That second sound sounds suspiciously similar to the Leviathan
---
Lmao so true. But to be fair the perk Disconnect is Meta for Survivors.
---
Its in early beta it seems. We won't see it for a while but the anticipation will make it feel longer
---
Console Nurse ftw!!!(mostly) I also play every other killer but Clown, Trapper, and Ghostface
---
These sound file leaks. The second sounds sounds suspiciously similar to the Leviathan
---
OR making his hands syringes for an overdose
---
Do they plan to keep all of his add ons the same, rework some or change all of them? I cant imagine most of his addons (namely the z-block addons) being of any use with this rework.
---
Wanna make bets on how many people post their questions here?
---
I go hard when it comes to memes
---
It was played around with when they were messing with the character models and made Wraith and Nurse dance with each other. The Valentine's cosmetics mimicked this and are based off that, and he now literally stole her heart
---
Or a player teaching his new player friends how to play. Jesus clam the fuck down.
---
Haha it is a terrible trapper drawing to be fair
---
I did this last night in reverse. Was trying to get healed and crawling to a nearby team mate. Not realizing the killer was right behind me and bam both of us ended up dying.
---
Botany is great. Tier 3 uses 12 charges to heal. So a yellow medkit alone is pretty great with it .
---
The green kit uses 10.12 charges.
---
I personally like the stealthy characters, though they aren‚Äôt the most powerful,
---
Thanks. I just feel really bad for my teammates for making them lose
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_(musician)

Scroll down to see how he died and that‚Äôs how you ALTF4 out of this bitch.
---
**Dead (musician)**
---
Per Yngve Ohlin (16 January 1969 ‚Äì 8 April 1991), better known by his stage name Dead and nickname Pelle, was a Swedish black metal musician, best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem from 1988 until his death in 1991. He also performed as vocalist of the Swedish death metal band Morbid on their demo December Moon. Dead was a popular figure of the Norwegian black metal scene. Roadrunner Records ranked him No.

I mean.. does it matter? We were still giggly bitches when this happened

No, I don‚Äôt think you understand. Anyone I lose to is op, even if I can‚Äôt play them for sh*t. /s
---
Same thing happend to me like ffs yall got the generators amd one of you is on the hooks id take my victory and run
---
Unless they fail the healing skillcheck
---
They're likely coming a week on Wednesday (17th of July).
---
Awww neat.
---
Like i said, i imagine they are going to change that.
---
I try to think "where would I hide." Found many a survivor in a corner or behind a tree. Playing both sides certainly helps.
---
r/screenshotsarehard
---
I'm conflicted by his EGC map presence. On one hand, it'll totally nullify his Dream Projection but on the other hand it will make Blood Warden and Remember Me important for freddy to run.
---
):
---
One step closer to crossplay
---
I mean, that's part of it, but  consistency-wise it makes sense considering what he can do in the movies.
---
NOED doesn't need a rework.
---
Do totems. Don't ignore a game mechanic.
---
Ive stopped using self care now. Its just a wasted perk slot. Now I just replace it with Iron will
---
*cries in red rank where survivors know to just keep your head on a swivel and a pallet near, then hold w to win*
---
Legit, me and my friends have been playing for 4 hours now and every single match has been Prayer Beads Spirit, except when we were doing a meme build, then we had a Billy. They were all purple/red ranks as well, as our ranks are 1, 2, and 5. All different people, all had almost the exact same build. It gets so annoying and when we heard a Nurse in our game we were about to play she dc'd on Haddonfield, yet she was using a Black Ward and Omega Blink add-ons.......
---
One thing they *could* do is make it so once all generators are complete his power changes to allow teleportation to the gate switches, but that may be too overpowered.
---
Mr Bing Bong.
---
I think it‚Äôs so crazy because I use to play him as a late game killer and now he is early game. I wonder how different the play style will need to be now. Including the perks. I‚Äôm thinking, ruin, Moniter, sloppy, and tremors
---
Omg. A game in BETA isn‚Äôt playin as well as I thought it would. This community is so trash. Give it time. It literally just came out a couple days ago. The controls from what I have seen do look wacky. But if I‚Äôm trying to be good I‚Äôll okay on console or pc. I‚Äôm sure the point of the game is to just get a quick game in or two while out on the go. Same with switch. They will fix it before it actually comes out. And if they don‚Äôt.....then don‚Äôt play it?
---
Does this mean we're going to finally be able toyplay as Banana Dwight?  ;_; I'm crying out of joy.
---
Look who's talking...
---
Good joke.
---
Don't forget bond
---
PTB July 9th, live sometime after. PTB is of only
---
My comment had nothing to do with the PTB or Freddy‚Äôs release.
---
Bill is stuck in video game limbo forever with a bunch of people dressed up as his old friends and a killer bell man in the background. Poor lad.
---
That‚Äôs probably why I wasn‚Äôt replying to you eh
---
*Hyper*-altruisticly. I'm talking about when all four are blatantly tripping over themselves to flashlight blind and body-block and nobody is on gens. It's not effective at all but it comes off as kinda toxic to me. But each to their own.
---
I highly doubt Bill will be on PS4 due to valve's hatred for the platform
---
When you puke on objects, it will infect non infected survivors. 
---
You can use red fountains, otherwise you need to wait. 
---
Other survivors can inject other survviors will fully broken.
---
LMAO
---
You did reply to me though lmao
---
When i first saw someone play it they were playing Leather face and i thougt the hooks were there because they were playing Leather face
---
there is a counter to ds. it's called not tunneling off the hook and it's very easy if youre not a cunt or trash at the game
---
3 heals for yellow? Isn't it 16 charges per heal, yellow medkit is 24 + gauze roll is 12 = 36 = 2.25 heals?
---
When I get hooked and see three people crouching around doing literally nothing for long periods of time I wanna give up lol
---
The teleport, if all 4 survivors are asleep, can have like a 18 second cooldown which is pretty good. Also, his snares don't slow him down when he is placing them like Hag or Trapper which is nice.
---
ok thanks for help
---
This is like a PTB in some sense, it‚Äôs a newer version
---
Some people have the 4th off or don‚Äôt work Thursdays. Or maybe just maybe this is a youngin. 
---
Fucking Dumbass.
---
I need Bubba. He's too good
---
And who doesn‚Äôt use BBQ and chili??
---
They should make noed a perk that needs to be worked up to by doing something like hooking some random amount of survivors (like 5 maybe) so killers who cant kill any survivors during the 5 gens wont be rewarded an easy kill just like that.
---
Just found out if you have Apple Music you have to cancel your subscription in order to do that
---
makes sense to me
---
Is it really camping after the exit gates are opened? The real problem with camping is that it distorts the game; the killer abdicates all of his responsibilities to protect generators in order to ruin one survivor's experience. It results in both the killer and that one survivor being penalized and everyone having a less fun time.
---
Once The End Game happens, the killer has no other responsibilities and the game is effectively over. A hook swarm is literally the only exciting moment left in that particular game.
---
Dwight Fairfield, on the runway your Legacy Eleganza look... shined through, but in the acting challenge you... shoved yourself into a locker. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are ^(up) for elimination
---
I'm just gonna guess and say the Rank 3 is SWF with the Rank 20
---
We will see it on tuesday in the PTB... not that long.
---
That‚Äôs why you just ignore people who only play one side, whether it‚Äôs the survivor or killer. 
---
Although the worst is when you get a survivor  main who says ‚Äúkiller is easy I 4k all the time‚Äù and then you check their profile and they‚Äôre a rank 15 killer
---
Reasons why I love DH and think DH is fair.
---
Why can't everyone just have A be best rank?
---
Also, Freddy isn't F rank now, and isn't likely to be top rank either.
---
Is that a good bruh or a bad bruh?
---
I didn't even expect to be read lmao + who even cares, if I want nudes from an american girl... aborted joke.
---
(Not a joke about abortion btw, I precise, just in case.)
---
Time is everything to a killer. Self care has its uses but it is used too often and starts to actually help the killer. Especially when people choose to do it over saving or finishing the last gen when the killer isn't around.
---
Believe it or not, not every survivor is amazing at looping, even at red ranks. Survivors can rank up by strictly being immersed, doing gens and saving teammates. Others do so by being able to loop incredibly well whilst also doing the occasional gen or hook save.
---
If you‚Äôre chasing a survivor who is obviously very good at looping and having trouble catching them, chances are there‚Äôs someone else who isn‚Äôt as good that you could catch much easier.
---
It's not a bad idea given that his teleport has (I think) a 40 second cooldown before uses if you do teleport considering gates take 20 seconds to open. So it's not like he can just teleport to and from all day, he'd still have to walk and check after using the one teleport. It could be clutch if used with the right timing.
---
I don't think you understand the lore of this game.
---
good to know.  thanks!
---
Yeah I started noticing it a lot more since the last patch. Seriously OP, seems like cheating when it happens as Killer.
---
kids game? the target audience is 18+
---
But killer never kill anyone lmaooo
---
The joke is you for not knowing how to play hard killers.
---
Finally
---
YEEEES!
---
Oh, damn. I thought he was trying to work off his winter coat. Lol
---
Putting an almost 10 second title card/prom in there like that was pretty annoying. Plus the cuts were pretty god awful. Not to mention the "daddy" part... Could have been much better and more fluid...
---
Gd
---
Oh yeah I remember seeing Paulie's video on that and I totally forgot! So holy shit a Hellraiser chapter would be amazing.
---
I had a Pizza Boy Dwight follow me around the other day. He didn't point or do the 'come here' emote, but everytime I turned around he would be right behind me, looking up at me. He did it for the entire game. I ended up giving him the hatch.
---
To all you Pizza Boy Dwight mains out there, I love y'all &lt;3.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad about it, it literally happens to everyone, don‚Äôt worry.
---
For me, Bloodhound and no other perks is an auto DC for me. That shit is toxic.
---
Next week on Tuesday we get to try out The Freddy Rework.
---
Unless they changed it, they said on stream that max ‚ÄúWake Up Action‚Äù time was 16 seconds
---
I like Doc cause he's annoying to play against.
---
Bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill
---
I just say, "Nobody Cares"
---
Do you know of a specific scp for that last example? I'd love to read it
---
Because its true. Now breaking a chase doesnt mean you get stunned by one pallet and walk away. It means that if they got 4 gens done and you still haven't hit this survivor, you should've stopped chasing them for someone else a while ago. 
---
You arent always going to get a 4k (unless your a rank 1 legacy nurse), but even if that one person gets away and you kill the 3 others, that's not bad.  You just need to learn when that survivor is better than a chase than you. Now that's not to say that there arent certain issues with generators, but there are ways around those issues to an extent. I dont 4k every game in the slightest, but I can normally at least stop 3 gens from being competed in 2 minutes. Granted I hover around rank 8 for both, but still
---
Than isn‚Äôt all that great. I would swap that for a diff perk 
---
Def BBQ and Chili, Nurses Calling, and Hex Ruin are the top perks of all time
---
I can still waifu Susie from The Legion though right? She's pure and innocent!
---
Well BBQ has been in the shrine twice for the entirety of its two year existence, and it was in the shrine somewhat recently. I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breathe about getting BBQ in the shrine. 
---
But other than that, the 3 killers you picked are all pretty good. Spirit is the most viable and arguably the best console killer (though there‚Äôs like 3 console Nurses who will make you realize how OP she is). Pig is probably the least viable of the 3 but still fun. She‚Äôs still a good killer regardless. Myers is in the middle of the two. Not as strong as spirit but not as weak as pig. Really fun and unique kit that makes you really feel like a killer with the stalking. 
---
If you‚Äôre looking to get two strong killers, get Spirit and Myers. If you don‚Äôt care about viability and only care about fun, you can‚Äôt go wrong with either of them imo.

Thanks we are new to it so I'll have to work on it. I did think when I put the title card together it was long but for start ups getting construtive critazium is hard because people would rather knock you down then actually help you out. But I'll take on what you have said and make the next one better :)
---
Maybe invest 40 seconds next time
---
nah fuck bubba. Hes a piece of shit
---
it‚Äôs always been like this. You only get one perk on your first 10 bloodwebs, after that you get to choose one from the two in the bloodweb.
---
Oh man that must've been a difficult match. Keep going though! You'll improve!
---
But big Russian mommy!
---
talking about the rank 2... not the killer...
---
why are people downvoting this?
---
That would involve the blood looking real. It should be under cartoon violence
---
I love how the first comment says ¬´¬†SWF bully¬†¬ª when the perks are literally not even toxic in the first place. Not even one flashlight. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think bullying newer killer is acceptable, but it‚Äôs literally one rank 2 and three noobs. Nothing worth crying about on Reddit.
---
&gt;Spirit is a very fun killer but she is a bit challenging to learn and master. If you're willing to put in the time, she's incredibly interesting and a very strong killer! Her perks are strong as well, Spirit Fury especially.
---
So the steam summer sale seems great.  It's looking like I can nab up the holloween version that comes with that chapter and the game itself.  And then I can buy all the licensed killers and just grind out the ones earnable in game.  So i'm probably going to do that.
---
&gt;No that's about it! Other than how you have a greater option of what type of keyboard or mouse you'd like to use vs controllers on a console, you've pretty much got it.
---
Good to know.  It's going to be very rough for me in the start since I have very little gaming experience with M&amp;K.  As even though I have a gaming pc I still primarily use a controller.  Hopefully I can bare through it and not upset other players aha.
---
&gt;When you hit Level-10, The Entity wakes up and begins to take items from the Bloodweb. Starting then you will not be able to get everything in your Bloodwebs. The Entity only starts to take from a Bloodweb either when you've grabbed one perk and there's another perk in the web (it starts with the perk you did not grab), or when you've bought 6 things from your Bloodweb. When a Bloodweb is completed (ie. nothing else can be bought from it), it's refreshed and a new one is generated.
---
So in other words perks/items that I grab I will always have unless I prestige.  And the entity will start taking things off of the blood web preventing me from grabbing it on that blood web at a certain point.  I think I understand now.  It sounds a little confusing but i'm sure it'll make sense the longer I play.
---
&gt;Yes! There's 3 others.
---
So i'll be grabbing up those 5.  But do you recommend I also by any non licensed killers off the bat as well for strong perks?  (ex like nurse for nurses calling.)
---
&gt;Totems are props that spawn on every map. There are 5 on every map. They have randomized locations and can be cleansed by survivors, breaking them. Normally they are Dull Totems and do nothing. However, if a killer brings a special perk called a Hex perk into a trial, it lights one of the 5 Dull Totems and makes it a Hex Totem.
---
Cleansing a Hex Totem removes that Hex perk's effect for the remainder of the trial. The only Hex perk that isn't lit at the beginning of the match is No One Escapes Death. This Hex perk is unique in the sense that it will only activate and light a Totem once all the generators have been completed. It's a very powerful perk and an example as to why even cleansing a Dull Totem can be useful
---
Basically hex perks are supposed to be stronger perks that come with the risk of being shut off during a match?  That's pretty cool.  I assume there's no way for either survivors or killers to know each other's perks till they see the effect of said perk in game and the post game screen.  So with the totem they'd have to visually see a totem being lit up or notice the killer doing something a hex perk would do in order to know to look for totems.
---
Ah then thank ye kindly
---
Is Bill coming to console? So you guys finally get Bill on your perks instead of that random guy.
---
That‚Äôs probably what‚Äôs going to happen
---
I agree I think he would fit perfectly. I already got Evil Dead so if they add Hellraiser I'd never ask for anything again.
---
Killer baby complaining about SWF calling console players babies.  Lol rich
---
well yea
---
Is there a data for this update? Is it with Bill?
---
Can I use my PC shards on mobile? I have 40k of them
---
Why is he so smol
---
Imma check if i can find it and I'll get back to you.
---
Or a killer main who said I‚Äôll just use some points quick before we play
---
Yeah, I know. I was making a joke about it.
---
I was just listing a bunch of the top most used ones
---
Here‚Äôs how playing both roles work. 
---
You have a opinion different of a survivor main you get called a killer main.
---
You have a opinion different of a killer main you get called a survivor main.
---
For real. Hellraiser would make this game the pinnacle of horror fan fanservice. All that would be left is jason, and after that I'm pretty sure we have _literally_ all the icons. My friends had an idea for Pinhead that he would be able to summon chains to slow people down, and once you had been grabbed X times you got injured. What would you like to see?
---
oh yeah i forgot about that.
---
I love OG freddy but hes meant to look like a burns victim which I think the remake freddy did better
---
I thought your original comment was pretty tongue-in-cheek. It's not the downvotes, it's the *responses* that make me laugh; it's the self-serving virtue signaling once everyone sees it's safe to pile on.
---
"Just so everyone here knows, I *too* was offended by the bad man's comment." [*Pats self on back*]
---
Thanatophobia is not a good perk, since its numbers simply are negligible - even with all four survivors injured at all times, its impact is meagre. It also won't incentivize competent/experienced/not-bad survivors to heal, as healing against Legion is usually not what you want to be doing anyway. Which brings us to the next two perks you mentioned: Nurse's Calling and Sloppy Butcher are also not good on Legion; given that Legion can injure survivors with almost inescapable ease, healing is regularly nothing but a waste of time. So a lot of survivors simply won't heal.
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury are amazing on Legion however. Since you have to bare-bone chase survivors once they are injured, you do need chase perks, and since survivors will be injured, any Fury proc is basically a guaranteed down. On top of that, you can use Enduring to end Frenzy by baiting pallet stuns, which is a lot faster than going through Frenzy fatigue. Of course, first you actually have to get survivors to throw pallets on you while in Feral Frenzy despite already being injured, but you can also often Frenzy-hit them through the pallet drop, then getting stunned by it.
---
yet people keep downvoting my shit :/
---
Just gotta angle yourself better, I‚Äôve noticed most survivors have caught onto the glitch. I assume they put Freddy‚Äôs new gen teleporting thing into the code and it jacked something up.
---
I like how it its accurate by showing the rank 1 has dead hard instead of balanced landing
---
Ataxic Respiration alone is already OP, Catatonic Boy Treasure too
---
Thanks friend
---
Sorry for a late response
---
The reason why I get tunneled every game is because I play with a friend who is a rank 19 (she's new to the game), and even though I don't actively seek out the killer (I actually prefer playing stealthy) once they find me I just...loop them regularly? And that pisses them off A LOT since they usually expect me to run in a straight line like higher rank survivors do.
---
Tbh that's the only reason I could find for getting tunneled. I was actually playing solo when I made this post and somehow I still get fucked by asshole killers. I guess my outfit choice makes them think I'm toxic? (Feng Min with the blue hair + mask and blue jacket or Jane "At Home" outfit set)
---
just locker things
---
Spirit is strong and fun. Pig and Leatherface are meh except for their perks. Spirit‚Äôs perks are decent as well. If you like mind games then I suggest the spirit. Her ability is unique and interesting.
---
\**laughs in Franklin's Demise*\*  
---
I swear to God whenever I take a medkit instead of selfcare the killer has Franklin's.
---
You think any part of this body could be described as *soft*?
---
Nobody has gotten banned for it before. You are safe to use these as long as you only modify these files and nothing else
---
Its possible but the auto aim can mess you up no matter what you do
---
yes for minecraft but dead by daylight on console is not possible :/
---
OP you need to calm down nobody is mad you‚Äôre making an argument out of nothing
---
are we assuming Valve just had a change of heart?  
---
Seems kinda weird tbh
---
The one thing I worry about is with Myers. When I stalk this one guy, won‚Äôt everyone else be doing gens, totems, chests etc.? I guess I don‚Äôt know until I see how quickly the Evil Within meter fills up...
---
Their may be an exclusivity clause that prevented them from porting it until a specified date.
---
Lullaby is good on nobody. Pop might be decent on him though.
---
I play Breath of the Wild on my Switch.
---
Over a year ago lol let it slide
---
nice! thanks for sharing

Theres still the exploit
---
Sniper pallets that stun you from 16m away

Beautiful

Survivor teachable when
---
I ignored his comment until his edits.
---
Shadowborn.
---
Except I have had problems in the past on other websites with people being assholes over stuff like this? Which I literally just said? And I explained how the person asked seemed like they were going to also be an asshole?
---
Who do you play?
---
I think they said in the stream that just about every single addon will be changing
---
it would help to know which killer you're using.
---
** *Bill Nye the Survivor Guy* **
---
LOLLLL! I got scared üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
And Franklin's don't forget Bubbie
---
Per BHVR: ‚ÄúYou'll keep the perks on any survivors where you've already unlocked them- they will not be affected. They will not show up in new bloodwebs until you've unlocked the teachables.‚Äù
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1147230874880098305?s=21
---
True. I mean if Nurse can teleport whenever she wants between gates with just her short breath catching cooldown it wouldn't be too broken for Freddy to be able to teleport to gate switches.
---
Sorry, i play legion
---
Legion
---
Did an AI make this?
---
10! =  3628800  
---
99999999/362880 \~ 27.56 or a score of 276/10  
---
Not a bad score.
---
Is it actually Consoles together? Or just Xbox? As much as I would love to be Bill on PS4, I have my doubts
---
yeah both bill and freddys rework happen in the mid chapter patch, the PTB of which will be availible on july 9th and the release will probably happen 2 weeks later.
---
But Dio is the one asking Jotaro if he's approaching him. You should swap David's and Freddy's locations.
---
All consoles, including Switch!
---
if the mori is not it eating the survivors then i would be disapointed
---
Deerstalker or Iron Grasp. 
---
Deerstalker is great for leaving survivors in the dying state and chasing others near the survivor. Works well with Legion as most the time the survivors will be in the injured state which allows you to instantly down them making chases faster. 
---
Iron Grasp can allow you to reach further away hooks and prevents body blocking tactics. It will also allow you to make better use of the basement which is a really strong place to put survivors. 
---
If you do not plan on using NOED then I would suggest changing Bitter Murmur for something like Shadowborn or Spies from the Shadows. Bitter Murmur is ok but outclassed by Discordance and does not provide much of a benefit without a perk to help make it stronger.
---
I'm not sure why you're using the word destroy.
---
His ability doesn't destroy existing pallets on the map in any way. His ability adds up to 10 fake extra pallets, which he can place anywhere a pallet could spawn at, that only sleeping survivors see
---
Bunny Mom. Then Michael/Wraith comes 2nd
---
Ye ah that‚Äôs why Myers is pretty snowball reliant. When stalking you‚Äôll have other survivors on gens, but once you get to tier 3 you can rebound. Tier 3 Myers has 60 seconds of one shot downs, if you can get 2-3 people with this that time on the gens won‚Äôt matter too much. You also vault faster and lunge further in tier 3. And it doesn‚Äôt take too long to stalk to tier 3, unless you‚Äôre running certain add ons. Myers can snowball hard but he can also struggle a bit if you can‚Äôt capitalize on your tier 3. The only other good thing about him is his small terror radius. Monitor and Abuse is basically core on him and makes him extremely hard to detect unless you have vision of him.
---
Edit bo1 zombie intro for better effect

---
no the only grass that I could was a circle
---
And no a AI did not make it I did in photoshop mix
---
yikes. scratched mirror is one of the few things in game that still scares that fuck out of me.
---
While it's an amazing perk, a majority of matches against killers don't seem to have it ranks 13 or so and up. Of course, I have nothing to back that up. It's just been my experience while raising in the ranks.
---
Even so, it takes me roughly 15 minutes on average to find a match. By the time I'm finished, unless I completely wiped the survivors, I could have played 2 maybe 3 long survivor games. 
---
If queue times were shorter it'd be a completely different story.
---
Claudette*
---
I mean if the glove doesn't fit...
---
wraith mains rise up
---
Hag
---
I‚Äôd go with Myers
---
He was nervous but God damn he is a sexy snacc.
---
but he's the programmer, not the designer. He wouldn't have thought of the power himself, just code it into the game
---
I play as both equally, got about 300+ hours on PC and 100+ hours on console.
---
Yeah Survivor is fucking easy to play lol, this is supposed to be a horror game and it's not even scary unless you're lucky and get a sneaky Myers or Beads Spirit, and sometimes Ghostface can be a sneaky fun time too. But most of the time you're fucked if you're wanting to feel that enjoyment of being terrified of something, because this game has hardly any moments like that. Fuck, I get jumpscared by P3 Claudettes popping out of grass as killer more often than I get scared as survivor. I don't give a shit if one side is more OP than the other, I just want to feel ACTUAL adrenaline (not the perk) when I'm playing a game that's been tagged as "horror." Just thonks to think about.
---
I rather put the Halloween one since or matches better
---
full legacy looks a lot better
---
If you want some OP perks I'd get Leatherface solely for BBQ &amp; Chili, as well as Franklin's Demise to punish survivors for abusing weapons. I bought Franklin's in the shrine and I'm glad I bought it. As for a new killer to use for their abilities I suggest trying a stealthier killer. It's a different play style compared to killers with a regular terror radius that gives them away. I personally love The Shape because I can be stealthy in the early to mid game and pull out Evil Within Tier III when I need it. I haven't tried The Pig yet, but like any killer they're fun to play with, as well as be ruthless to play against when played correctly.
---
I feel like the fact that noed can be disabled before it's even activated makes it a bit less of an "ez mode perk" than a lot of people consider it to be. It would be blatantly op if it wasn't a hex perk but the fact that it's a hex and activates so late makes me consider it balanced, personally. I know as a survivor I don't really see it and think "wow this killer sucks and relies on a crutch", but I admit I might be biased as a killer main.
---
I thought the D A R N made it obvious enough I was joking as well... redditors I swear
---
Oh god I‚Äôm scared
---
I would rather play as Nancy. 
---
Having a Demogorgon would be absolutely badass.
---
This is bad ass! Well done!!!
---
I would kill for a Steve Harrington survivor. That's all I'm gonna say.
---
I would go for bloodhound if you have it, if not the  maybe whispers.
---
If that‚Äôs Legion none of those perks are too good on him except sloppy butcher. Discordance isn‚Äôt too bad either I guess.   Whispers is good but you need it on Tier 3, it‚Äôs radius is way too large on 1 and 2. But I guess if you really want to swap out noed then Deerstalker is okay, even though Legion isn‚Äôt really a killer that you slug with. I
---
its memeing
---
im memeing
---
Because you‚Äôre making a big deal out of nothing.
---
I defy your rules
---
Since ghostface came out I've been maining him. Being silent is fun.
---
To add onto this, you can tell if an unhook was safe by a ‚Äúsafe unhook‚Äù point notification that pops up.
---
It means that the person you unhook does not get downed again within a certain period of time. I can't give you an exact number of seconds, but it's really not that long. Maybe 20 seconds? It's basically there to prevent someone from farming another survivor off the hook to get their Deliverance.
---
Oh, I see. Are you the work of Enemy Stand by reversing the true Power Role here? Is that your Stand ability?
---
Bills teachables are free perks right now. On a future survivor you‚Äôll need to unlock teachables but if you have it now, you won‚Äôt have to unlock it again lmao.
---
I‚Äôm the level 20 üò≠
---
Exactly. Not having to learn borrowed time before getting it was nice
---
You will need to get the teachable for anyone who doesn‚Äôt have it after Bill drops
---
Bruh most people don‚Äôt work on Independence Day.
---
He‚Äôs gonna be on all platforms.
---
Big Oof
---
Lol
---
If you have the perk unlocked on a character, you will keep it and you can still use it.
---
They will not appear in newly generated bloodwebs until you unlock the teachable perk, though.
---
Better hope you have it on your main survivor then.
---
His fucking stun sounds like predator on crack
---
Can you explain how iron grasp or shadowborn are BETTER than noed on legion? Imo, NOED is a better choice than these 2.
---
I am VERY excited for increased survivor bloodpoint earnings. I think I'd have everyone P3 by now if the survivor side got as many bloodpoints as the killer side
---
i mainly switch between hag and Freddy but I play every killer except spirit and clown.
---
Cant wait for the DC punishments. Shit is annoying
---
I hereby find you guilty of the sin you were being accused of, and need to find redemption ASAP.
---
&gt;Survivors who disconnect from a match will leave a ‚Äúhusk‚Äù behind. The Killer can then hook and sacrifice this husk to receive the points- and perk tokens where applicable- that they would have earned had the Survivor continued playing. Additionally, the other Survivors in the match will receive a quitter bonus to compensate for losing a teammate.
---
Very interesting
---
Well that's kinds of my point. If you avoid detection you can't be tunneled.
---
Absolutely the truth, I‚Äôll get called a main of one or the other, and it‚Äôs great to see that all because I‚Äôve got some negative opinions of perk changes that just happen to be survivor perks I‚Äôm immediately a survivor main, and not a rational person observing the perk use from both perspectives
---
Well teleporting to generators will be unique to Freddy. That‚Äôs a power that could either be too strong or too weak with nothing in between so they decided to give him a little something extra. Either way, looks like Distortion will still be really good on the new Freddy.
---
Yes! None can match the power of my Stand, „ÄåNITPICK„Äç!
---
No, it‚Äôs a completely different account
---
And ruin is impossible to use?
---
Sad :(
---
You try to sound tough over console players but yet here you are whining.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted OP.
---
Did you get a ban from PSN where you couldn‚Äôt log in online for any games, or when you loaded up DBD and on the main loading screen after pressing X it would pop up saying you were banned?
---
I played  most of  my playtime (around  200 hours) as Killer, just recently started  to play survivor  and it helped  me alot  while  playing Killer.
---
Now i always  check places  where  I would hide  as a survivor and it  suprised  me how often  I find somebody hiding there... the times  I bodyblocked  a survivor in a corner  as Billy or leatherface... feels Good :D
---
I‚Äôm really glad that I‚Äôll still be able to get my BP, Emblem points, and perk stacks if a Survivor DCs.
---
Remove all but 1 extra blink(s) add on and make it an ultra rare. For her range increase add ons, instead of decreased accuracy (whatever that is) it decreases charge speed. Since my idea removes 3 add-ons we can make 2 of them reduce fatigue duration slightly and considerably and one that removes a blink but gives you double XP per blink hit. Her base speed and power I wouldn't touch
---
Ahh, because the Hex totem would always spawn in the same place?
---
I suppose in the case of Hex perks, the spawn should be randomly selected between all available Dull totem spawns.
---
Specifically because Hex totems are useful because of their random spawning.
---
you should play 2016 trapper with bloddy cleaver, body and the rogi mask. rogi mask = noed
---
Yeah, people don't seem to get this. If the game was perfectly balanced for e-sports level play, the solo queue survivors would never win a match. The game would be dead in 2 days, since no one would want to play anymore.
---
Those are actually good suggestions ,especially the oe about dream projection. But even if it gets added ( probably wont) the major problem with DP is that its cooldown is massive UNLESS survivors are asleep but if you kill someone they are not asleep. Its the same issue with thanatophobia( besides bad numbers but not the point) It punishes you for doing your job. Idioy survivor died on first hook ? Too bad take the permenantly longer cooldown. Not mentiom hooked survivors arent asleep which is EVEN worse that thanatophobia.
---
have you found it yet? on google play

We love him for it.

You need jesus

On the Spirit - Are prayer beads a common add on? Everyone does seem to say a prayer bead Spirit is hell to play against so... 
---
I‚Äôve seen some Spirit gameplay and when you exit the phase walk, does it take time or do you sort of instantly re-enter the real world and can hit things again? Also I know that there is some audio cue but does Spirit have a normal terror radius while phase walking?
---
Thanks for taking the time out of your day to answer noobs like me lol
---
Probably going to stay here
---
üò≤ that face she made
---
i could log into psn just fine i loaded up dbd and pressed x and it said "You are banned" and said i was banned due to unsportsmanlike behaviour.
---
I don't know man. I've had plenty of matches where I'm chased to max boldness points, and no gens get done because everyone is hiding behind a bush. T\_T  
---
*Cries in solo queue*
---
Cleanse totems
---
&gt; We will be reviewing scoring for the Survivor side in order to bridge the gap between Survivor and Killer bloodpoint earnings.
---
I'm glad they're finally looking to increase survivor BP gain, it can be a real struggle sometimes. I also can't wait to see the match making cool down for DCing that builds the more you DC while shrinking when you don't.
---
Yes. They will. And any characters who already have it will get to keep it without needing to level Bill.
---
I always face the Huntress and i am seriously annoyed over that so i know how you feel
---
Finally I can have those Meg jeans lol
---
All the characters you have who have his perks will get to keep them. Any characters who don't have them yet will no longer receive them until leveling Bill and unlocking the teachables.
---
I don't get why they just don't give survivors more bloodpoints. The main point why a lot of killers queue up is that they get way more bloodpoints than survivors and thus queues are long.
---
I overcome it.
---
I wonder if the husk will auto sacrifice or if survivors will be able to farm it lol. I'd assume it would auto sacrifice though.
---
They said awhile back that Valve didn‚Äôt want him on console
---
I can't, in order to change country it can't be changed back for a whole year so I would need to make a new account
---
Wow. I cant believe i got downvoted for cheering on the killer. Youre a load of cum stains.
---
I got a glitch where I couldn't see perks or skill checks.
---
Almost my username!
---
Hell yes.
---
Did you not read the dev update...
---
We really shouldnt though
---
Sheesh man that must have sucked. I‚Äôm curious though, how‚Äôd you do?
---
Blood pallets seems like the only decent thing he has and it's walled behind an add on.  
---
The snares need to be much stronger for them to actually be decent.  The projection could be okay but it'll be really useful if Freddy emerges quickly from it.  Would be cool if this affected other things like exit gates too.
---
I just talked to him and he agrees you need to find the light
---
FUCK YEAH
---
PILLS HERE
---
Tbh he does have the best perks in the game, no mither + unbreakable op
---
The recent changes to emblems have made it much harder to rank up on killer. Winning isn't enough, you basically have to farm the survivors for points once you are at red ranks.
---
There are those games too of course
---
She's pissed cause there's 2 other hoes copying her hairstyle
---
Good points. Distract the looper, while he tries getting your attention (they don‚Äôt do gens) you pretend to chase them but go after the others at the same time.
---
I hope they change WGLF as well to make it easier to get tokens.
---
Wow, well if that‚Äôs the case then you must have had allot of reports submitted on your tag and I mean allot, or you were playing against a dev and they reported you and it was approved. They claim the play on both consoles, but the reporting system I think is just there to make people feel better, but post the link for the image I wanna see it. Don‚Äôt hear to many of these and I‚Äôm still calling bs on the devs banning people even when using exploit glitches!
---
Worst story coming up. 
---
1. I can‚Äôt chase a complete stealth Claudette. No joke I fucking chased this Claudette but I can‚Äôt even see her next thing I know I‚Äôm looping myself. 
---
I seriously can‚Äôt fucking see Claudette at all. 
---
2. In the same game I got someone down finally with 3 gens left (the people where good loopers). I saw someone running so instead of pressuring one person I pressured 2. But the other one got instahealed. I already was having a not so great night. So instead of dcing I put my character in a corner and made some food and got something to drink.
---
Sometimes you should take a break instead of losing your sanity.
---
As if I'd risk wasting my precious subblies on randoms who could dc or throw the game
---
You mean he is the best survivor in the game
---
Spies is nice because nobody respects crows
---
Never thought this day would come. I‚Äôve never played L4D so I don‚Äôt have any attachment to him but it feels good to finally have the full roster. The devs said before that Valve didn‚Äôt want him on console so thanks to whoever finally made it happen
---
R.I.P. generic man from perk icons :‚Äô(
---
He is too fat
---
I actually just finished a game where at the start, playing as silent bingbong boi with no heartbeat/stain on uncloak, i snuck up to someone who was on a gen, with a few trees between us... uncloaked, used the sprint burst from uncloak to round the tree that was between me and them and *grabbed them* off the gen.
---
they had ZERO warning whatsoever, they went from no heartbeat and no stain and no idea who the killer was to on my shoulder.
---
I would like to think i scared the everloving fuck out of them.
---
This is the first time I got jumpscared in this subreddit wtf
---
He eats my screen space
---
It will automatically be destroyed after a certain amount of time if it is not sacrificed.
---
Huntress is actually my favorite Killer to play against
---
Glad more ways to earn survival points are being added. It feels like that category is very hard to earn points in, besides the 5000 for escaping.
---
He‚Äôs not fat he‚Äôs a jock
---
Everyone says that every time someone points out an old repost. I don‚Äôt know how long you‚Äôve been on this subreddit but seeing posts you‚Äôve seen numerous times is mildly infuriating, 1 year from now we are gonna see the reposts if the current posts we have right now and the cycle will continue.

Fortnite make billions of dollars and DbD doesn't:P I wouldn't be surprised if the creators don't do a collab with other games. For all we know epic may have bought exclusive rights for Stranger Things so other companies can't add them into games. Likewise I'd rather have John Wick as a survivor if they could like Fortnite ;)

I underestand that you are trying to offer criticism like op aksed but that "try again" at the end of your comments makes you come of REALY assholish.

op asked for a perk that isn't noed and i just picked the 2 perks i would use in his situation.
---
Dang man. Can playing a killer be that painful sometimes? I mean I tried a bit of The Shape. But I‚Äôm mainly focusing on survivors.
---
They aren't, they are a better choice for survivors :P
---
And....?
---
She‚Äôs just staring at the clown that‚Äôs creepily looking at her behind the tree.
---
Oh Deejay, deejay deejay no, no they don‚Äôt
---
That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt loop when you‚Äôre playing against a nurse. What do you expect the outcome to be?
---
Why would you teleport to a blocked gen? Blocked ones aren't being worked on.
---
This was quickly typed out, so i might have not covered in detail on a lot of what was in here, but please let me know what you all think. :)
---
Something I like about Pinhead (at least in the ones I saw, which are the first two) is that he can be bargained with, even by his obsession Kirsty. It‚Äôd be cool if they could incorporate that into his powers or perks, with an obsession that can change through the course of the game similar to Furtive Chase.
---
I‚Äôve also discussed with people if we get a Kirsty character, she could have obsession perks that she can pawn off onto other survivors, however someone brought up the point that that would encourage working with the killer and Kirsty‚Äôs would automatically be the most toxic survivors in the game if they screw your teammates over. But it‚Äôd probably fit her character.
---
Stop bullying my man
---
i don‚Äôt know either? people get really upset when their ideals and opinions are challenged with different ones. i was backhand-complimented and all that does to an artist is make them feel like shit. but i‚Äôm the bad guy here, of course.
---
i just wanted to share a sketch/doodle i did that i was proud of! now i know not to show my work to reddit because a lot of people here are, frankly put, rude; and cannot stand to look at other interpretations and characterizations. duly noted. thanks reddit!
---
Will there be crossplay with console and pc with the mobile version? If so, how might that affect those on PC and console?
---
If she isn't OP in your hands, you are bad at her. An expert nurse is just unstoppable.
---
I just watched the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The beginning said something "like this story is based on actual events."
---
I immediately thought "What? When tf did this happen?" 
---
It was not based on actual events.
---
What is the blue perk in the middle?
---
What? That‚Äôs dumb...sorry to hear that man. I don‚Äôt use Apple Music. So good to know.
---
This comment could change this game if only more people could accept it.
---
I make people dc since I get precise blinks all the time
---
Ah, so it was still the doodoo freddy I was playing against.
---
It doesnt hurt to try and be nice you know. Why make the person your talking to feel bad ? Look at one of op's comments and youl see what im talking about. I wouldnt say anything if uou were teying to troll but you gave valid reasons wjy it wouldnt worl so idk
---
Oh hell yeah. Also with the constant harassment of survivors tbagging basically saying you suck and laughing at your skills. It can be sometimes very frustrating. Especially when you can‚Äôt the survivor or they get out due to altruism. 
---
Playing Killer is way more stressful then a survivor. It‚Äôs honestly the reason why I‚Äôve been playing more survivor.
---
Yeah that's why the rank 4 escaped and got the most points.
---
Rank 20s can learn how to play the game like everyone else did. They don't need to be carried through every match by a rank four because that ruins the fun for the killer who is also trying to learn the game.
---
He just big boned?
---
Yeah I would've done the same had I been playing with friends to communicate lol
---
Yeah.  As is theyre kinda meh already, so if it was reduced to 5 spawns, theyd be absolute shite.  The rest seemed like an interesting idea, though, and could be a thing if they ever split into casual and not
---
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe no one‚Äôs ever thought of that.

---
The joke is you thinking that Freddy is as powerful as Spirit, Billy and Hag, the real A tier killers. 
---
Freddy is really weak without Class Photo, he is probably B tier with that add-on + Pill Bottle or Nancy's Masterpiece, but without that combo, he struggles too much. Meta perks like Adrenaline, Deliverance, Unbreakable, Sprint Burst and Spine Chill hard counter him, he can't stop gens from being done, totems from being cleansed and gates from being opened, his power is heavily RNG reliant and he is, together with Trapper, the most bullyable killer against SWF teams. 
---
A killer without anti loop and/or map pressure can't be A tier. Period.
---
That‚Äôs all a survivor can do to survive she basically takes that and throws it out the window. 
---
What else are you supposed to do? 
---
She also has great map pressure. 
---
Please explain what else do you do?
---
He‚Äôs playing DBD in the shower
---
I‚Äôm at rank 9. You should see the amount of people I go against who think looping her is a good idea
---
The real story was extremely exaggerated toward the point that it became something entirely different
---
That‚Äôs it i‚Äôm calling the police
---
Lol wow! Well you must have pissed someone off real good! But the devs have stated a few times that Camping and or Tunneling is a non ban able offense. So whatever they saw you doing got you banned. I reported a infinite mending Legion after BhVR announced bans for exploiting that glitch and the dude never got banned. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been calling BS on BhVR with there reporting system!
---
I use pocket watch and fragile wheeze
---
Why does this happen?
---
Man I was hoping itd be an easy way to get my mori dailies out of the way.  I do really like the fix though, especially since survivors get bp too.  I always felt bad when someone DCd
---
Some good advice here, but I want to bring up one more thing about the advantage of breaking a chase. If you go for other survivors midchase, they will probably not be aware of what pallets were broke or even of the closer tiles to them. It makes easier on you. I have got many survivor in the shack who didn't know there was no pallet there.
---
A few months ago, I made about half of the DBD survivors in Sims, today I had some free time and decided to make the rest. Hope everyone has a great day!
---
Its better for freddy though. For huntress its either a useless change or a big buff. We will jave to wait and see
---
i got a ton of messages from this guy who kept threatening to report me to psn and behaviour for hooking him and i also thought the report thing was to make people feel better it was a shock when i saw i was banned
---
I gave my opinion. If it comes off as being an asshole thats not my problem. He does need to try again. Also have you given any critiques or any opinions on the stuff given? I said my opinion, OP obviously decided to take my critique and try again. He didnt say anything and he had full ability to, for them its not that big of a deal idk why it is to you pal.
---
I love all of the comments from Survivor means defending this stuff. Especially that they are getting upvotes for some reason.
---
I could totally understand a rank 15 or 16. Maybe even a green rank playing against the rank 20 killer. But they are defending a rank 4 saying it's not survive with friends and it's not toxic. It's fair and to get over it.
---
I've seen a rank 20 perkless Freddy (first match a friend ever played) go against 3 red ranks and a rank 20
---
Fellow console Nurse here! \*blinks\*
---
If they add Barb I will main her.
---
&gt;Survivor players meanwhile have to deal with that feeling of helplessness all the god damn time. Team mate got downed by the Ruin Mori P3 Nurse  near the basement in the first 45 sec of the game? Guess Ill die. The game might as well be over now.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;One bad teammate or one bad mistake can throw the entire game for all the survivors regardless of the killer.
---
Didn't you said in your first paragraph "Killers talk as if this is norm all the time and not the exception."
---
What you said is also an exception, you will rarely find hard ass veteran killers runing ebony mori witha full loadout of meta perks until you hit the red ranks.
---
For cyberbullying

I'm in this image and I don't like it.
---
I feel bad for Legion mains, he's such junk in his current state. He's like a bad Doc
---
Well now I really want to see this.
---
Prob only original killers. But I would still be down for a good ole Dr. Carter episode.
---
I must say, your drawing looks great.
---
I didn't see when dedicated servers are planned to launch, is there any estimate thus far?
---
Here, you dropped this:  
---
/s
---
But it's pretty annoying only getting to play against one killer
---
Looking dope!
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs just the item
---
It will be my new main if true
---
Prayer beads are a purple add on (more rare than green, less rare than iridescent/pink).
---
Exiting the phase walk is almost instantaneous. You can hit/grab pretty much right away. Spirit has no terror radius while phase walking, but survivors will hear a noise if you approach them if they were outside your terror radius when you started your phase walk. The prayer beads eliminate that noise.
---
thank you so much ü•∞
---
Yes you‚Äôre bullying David and since he can‚Äôt step up for himself I have to do it
---
I mean they've added two characters from the series into a game that's not one they made and it's not completely about them. Seems to me they're willing to add them to games for publicity...
---
Well, no arguement there. That is how game design works. Good game design will even deliberately encourage the desired behaviours.

I ...didnt say its a big deal ? Idk where you got that. I was just trying to spread a bit of kindness ( cliche but whatever) . And i any case, i never said i didnt agree with your critiques. I made it a point last comment to say i agree with you. Any way this a stupid reason to start a reddit fight(tm) so im ending it here. Have a good day
---
Well if you don't think nurse is op as a nurse main then you probably aren't a very good nurse.
---
Myers is the only reason I look around while working on the first gen.
---
Then again, I never break rank 10 so maybe it's just the tiers.
---
Rightttt, a rank 4 with Ds, Adrenaline, Self care and Dead 'ard vs a rank 20 probably playing their first match. 
---
It's amazing to me how people will defend this shit and call it fair. Or non-toxic.
---
Honestly I could understand the argument that it's just bad matchmaking if it was a rank 16 or 15. Maybe even a green rank. But not a rank 4, who by the way brought a tool box with Sabo add-ons, and I'm totally sure he didn't break hooks to fuck with the killer when he downed people. 
---
Never mind the fact he got twenty one thousand points and clearly carried The team, plus escaped. 
---
If he was just a friendly guy teaching his friends to play the game, and not a toxic bully in the match. I'm certain this wouldn't have even been posted on Reddit. I know if I was teaching my friends to play the game and got matched against a rank 20, I would let the rank 20 kill me at the end and explain my rank in the post-game chat, say gg, and maybe even giving some tips.
---
man me tf TOO
---
I'm wondering if the coding for these husks is already in the live client. For a while now shadow versions of T-posing survivors have been popping up in games, usually where a survivor got downed or picked up.

It do be like that sometime

Yes, but the problem is that she will catch no matter where you go.

There's literally nothing survivors can do against a nurse except for hoping that the person playing her is bad.
---
LOL
---
I'm sad to say I've abandoned many survivors to the hook during end game when I see the killer is camping. I'm still pretty new and not capable of doing a "what's called a pro gamer move" yet.
---
Yeah...next time bother someone else.
---
That's just 1 example genius. The thesis of the post was the last sentence which you included in the quote but clearly didn't bother to read.

my only reason for recommending Nancy instead of him was because Nancy is already dead. whereas Steve isn't and they'd have to come with some half job reason for him being there?

dont you shame my daddy with his bear moans &gt;‚Ä¢&lt;

Ruin, Discordance, Sloppy Butcher and Thanataphobia is a good build for him.  Try that.  Also kudos to you for wanting to play sans safety net.  You'll only become a better player for it.
---
The posts says "Consoles".
---
If you keep trash talking him I will definitely bark though
---
I read the beginning and had to stop. No this cant work my guy. Please try again.
---
Ok, you do that
---
Well PSN can‚Äôt do anything unless you violate there EULA and that‚Äôs mostly with cheating or sending messages with cuss words, threats, ect... I‚Äôve been psn suspended for telling a dude to go fuck himself after he sent me a GG Ez message because I was a rank 16 against 4 rank 2 players when matchmaking was fucked up and got my ass handed to me a year ago. But psn sent me a email with the message I sent and explaining why I was suspended for a week. learned from that! But you hooking someone will not get you banned nor will camping or tunneling. I‚Äôm not even sure what the threshold of how many reports they need on someone to issue a suspension on DBD. I know if you DC 20% out of how ever many games you play you will be suspended. If it ever happens again I would send a email to BhVR asking what‚Äôs going on and you want better clarification on the suspension.
---
Yes. But Left For Dead has never been on PlayStation. Hence my simple question.
---
Don't talk about rational perspective since most of you are using their parent's credit card to buy stuff.
---
Plenty of survivors on PC play against them just fine with a controller

I saw that when a streamer was playing Freddy, looked super creepy in the dream world

Unpopular opinion: Freddy's rework feels like the best parts of killers just slammed together and what out Freddy 2.0.

&gt;I did read it, sounds like you are saying survivors will always have a bad time because they will always have one theamate that screws up, that si also an exception and it becomes more rare the higher you rank.
---
The fact that you see no problem and act like it's normal to sell 10 bucks VIRTUAL COSMETICs in a half working bugged game.
---
This generation, and peoples like you to an extent, are the reasons Game developpers don't respect anymore their customers and tend to see them even more than usual as cattle lately.
---
I'm not reading this and neither is anyone else.
---
Happens to me a lot. I then see their glow and most of the time they ignore me. I‚Äôm lucky if one even attempts to help me.
---
Lets look at the low rank guys. First has a single level 2 perk. Second has four perks, two of which are level 1, and three of them are neutral perks. Last guy has three level 1 perks, two of which are neutral perks. Not a single one of the low rank players is using a teachable perk. (Notice the rank 20's first perk is unbreakable, which is teachable on console since they don't have Bill yet).  
---
This is not a low rank bully. The two guys on the bottom have probably played a little before and gone through a rank reset. I know plenty of people who only play this game occasionally. They are usually around rank 20 when they come back.
---
Kudos my man. You're one of the few that I've seen admit that they love playing as her. If I'm being too hard on the Plague, sorry. My ire is not with the character though or those who main her, but with the devs who have given her a power which can be ignored. If they gave survivors some sort of penalty for not cleansing she would be so much better. Going into the dying state after 30 seconds, 5-10% action speed debuff, something.. anything. She needs corrupt purge because she has no mind gaming/gen control/map control. I just want the character to be as good as she can be.
---
Ascend.
---
They said theyre making cleansing give more BP, so that actually is a bit of a soft nerf.
---
Hey! Leave the cute one alone
---
woo-oo-oooosh
---
There was a survivor who I kept queuing up with in lobbies, and every time I would go down, they would go up to me and teabag me and leave. I‚Äôm trying my best, and I didn‚Äôt even do anything to them lmao.
---
Just safely unhook + take the hit protecting an injured survivor I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that hard
---
Eh, it's their loss too, they lose out on points and make it harder for them to secure the win. It gets better but I wouldn't try to wiggle off, slippery meat or not :/
---
I‚Äôm on console and was maining Huntress and Meyers initially. Now I play Nurse only mostly.
---
Having the game on its lowest quality makes your matches significantly brighter. I run it on lowest quality because of this.
---
Ive played a bunch on both sides, hundreds of hours. No killer is truly OP besides nurse. Billy and spirit are strong, but both have counterplay, and spirit is the only killer that can literally juke herself, so she has a huge margin for error. Nurse can genuinely remove every element of skill that a survivor has and just down them in 20 seconds with no room for counterplay. A skilled survivor can juke an average nurse, but a skilled nurse will always time their blink so their second blink is in lunge range regardless of the survivors juke.
---
No survivor is too strong on their own, it is only when you get a skilled team that is on communications outside of the game that the game starts to break down and heavily favor survivors. Coordinated survivors can burn through the maps generators in less than 5 minutes, and you can be damn sure that they will be skilled enough to make you lucky to down more than two players unless you are the nurse.
---
You said you were really new, so you probably havent had enough time to really go up against some veteran nurses or SWF groups. I guarantee your perspective in balance will shift when you get into the rank 1 metas from both  sides. Both sides are really fucked up, Killers vary so wildly in strength from killer to killer, and survivors can take all the fun away if they are coordinated and prepared.
---
I agree
---
A part of bubba will always be with us...in the forma of BBQ

Judging by your profile and comments made in the past, you're kinda a pervert. And I assume you found what this guy said funny, right? Lol so yeah, keep talking buddy. I'm right because that's all you can do. Defend a douchebag lol
---
I hope they start looking at the bloodweb in general. This game is starting to get to big for the system they have in place, I have all my killer teachable and because of that it took me 85 bloodwebs to get ruin tier 1 with clown
---
The middle one
---
I was wondering how they would be able to simulate that.
---
So they're terrible traps hat do almost nothing, thanks for pointing that out.
---
Now I want survivors' posture to change based on level. Super nervous and jumpy level 20s and bored/annoyed low levels.
---
Give credit to the artist you karma whore
---
116 days late and no audio I know pls no bully
---
Oh yeah, because that is such a big downside on current Freddy.
---
I've seen better.

feels good man

That's been on console too
---
Netflix literally tweeted during e3 that they were collaborating with Behaviour. They also mentioned Epic Games, Ubisoft, and Roblox in the same tweet. 
---
MCote even responded to the tweet with his own.
---
Something is happening. Considering Fortnite and Roblox have since both revealed Stranger Things crossovers I expect DbD to get one too.
---
https://youtu.be/dqB-EMqpsUA
---
yep all perks
---
No, they added Hopper and the Demogorgon to Fortnite. He‚Äôs basically saying Netflix is willing to add Stranger Things content to games.
---
I play Ghost Face also, and I went from rank 15 to rank 5 exclusively using him, and it was a blast! I can't complain. It's also hard for them to get a good understanding of how strong a killer is because the community is so biased :p I'm staying optimistic, especially because I already own him and either way it'll feel like a new killer!
---
Holy shit, 400+ upvotes.
---
stopP!!! im tryying my best!
---
That and getting injured and then rubbing against each other, was really weird
---
Shit happens, should've left when you had the chance
---
Freddy and Doc
---
Survivors bomb the hook during EGC, I end up killing two of them, the last of which was picked up right outside the safe zone in the exit corridor.
---
&gt;him: toxic killer, i was almost there, should've let me leave  
---
&gt;Me: Why?  
---
&gt;him: we were trying to save the other survivor  
---
&gt;Me: And you failed.  
---
&gt;him: fuck you
---
Excuse me??
---
Don't like your current bloodweb?
---
Only $1.99/5.99/38.99 to generate a new bloodweb.
---
My god.
---
This is by every means salt and not a question because there is not a question anywhere in this post. Ya got unlucky and a survivor sandbagged you. Just a clarification also we call puppyguarding, camping. So welcome to r/deadbydaylight
---
Well of course they would add that to Fortnite. Fortnite is like pop culture reference times 1000%. It also makes a lot of money and is behind Epic. 
---
Dbd on the other hand is different.
---
Adam looking like ace just took a shit right there
---
They actually don't have a bloodweb anymore it's a bloodmarket which is slightly better since the way you get perks is just by playing the character. Unfortunately, that means if you want hags perks you gotta play hag. A lot.
---
Y'know, now that you've made this (good job btw!) There are some uncomfortable connections between the player's actions in the sims, and the entity
---
Problem is that cosmetics affect the game
---
Goes perfect with my other meme
---
i mean that's basically 4 killers at once which im less than crazy about bc of how small most maps are, but its a cool idea in theory - would definitely be a more interesting/scarier dynamic being hunted by a pack rather than one
---
Yes you can be deranked below 15 as survivor on PS4! Happens to my work account all the time during rank reset! I‚Äôm a devotion 1-55 and have been at rank 9 survivor before and bumped back to 17.
---
Linking it would be pretty quirky doe üò≥
---
Man don‚Äôt knock on Leonard
---
It's my proudest

Oh wow.  I'm flabbergasted they'd torment people who suck as the Hag / Nurse like this.

I feel your pain. Oddly enough I had a Huntress last night with unstable ping so once the Servers drop it'll take a huge load off.

There‚Äôs a monthly reset. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you mean that but just letting you know.
---
\*Jeff lmao.

He does kind of look like Keanu though, tbh.
---
My farmer dad: Just clean up after the cows! There's not that much bull shit!

The amount of bull shit:

Wh, what happened to my boy!? Is he good now!?
---
and you could think "hey this person just got unhooked and he clearly wants to get picked up, he probably has ds" and leave them slugged
---
She's had enough
---
O yeah You are really mad about a joke, what's your problem exactly?. So you don't find the joke funny does not make it not a joke, how is that hard to understand or comprehend?. No offense but anyone who takes a bad joke, this badly is not exactly someone i would want to know truthfully. Again it is a joke not a dick don't take it so hard
---
Jane and Kate are *really* accurate. Jeff and Tapp look good too! Ace and Quentin (or is that Ash?) look a little weird though.
---
I agreeüò±üëçüèº
---
Self-care is more efficient since the other survivors can be working on gens instead of healing you. Relying on teammates in solo queue to have these perks is already shaky. But medkits are nice :)
---
They said he‚Äôs free from what my discord crew said.
---
Except that now people will just want to play killer to not have a good reason to DC while we want more people playing survivor and less killer
---
Damn they turned out amazing
---
I don't think its that hard, the issue is that a lot of game survivors will rush for the unhook before you can. You have to fistfight other people for your stacks, unlike BBQ where you just gotta play the game and it'll happen.
---
Thank you! It's Ash, lol.
---
The after messages were the part that made me nope out though tbh
---
The cooldown's big, but think of it like this:
---
The main purpose is to cross the entire map. Hpw often are you *actually* gonna want to do this? After each chase, at most. So 45s is not so bad.
---
It will be REALLY strong when combined with Discordance, Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors and/or BBQ.
---
I don't blame killers for camping during the endgame, it's one of the most efficient tactic in a lot of situations.
---
But I don't blame the survivors for hating on it either. It always feels very bad, you clearly dominated the killer, everybody surviving through all gens, the team did a great game. But then darn, you're unlucky, you're the one getting one-hit by NOED and camped. Could have been anyone. But no, it's you.
---
So yeah, don't hate on the killer for camping or the survivors for being salty, they're both right to act like they do. Hate on the game for making endgame camping a great strategy.
---
How do you suck as hag, no offense or anything, bit every hag i see just spam places her tuings around gens and hooks and just teleports to it every single time and pretty much wins that way, I mean yeah, you can sneak past them but they're relatively invisible
---
Lmao no u
---
Now, you must tell me.
---
Don't be a baby bro. Why do people complain so much on this game about funny stuff like teabagging and hitting someone on the hook? Stop being soft and bitchy all the time. I play killer and survivor and it makes me laugh when I get teabagged and it makes me sad when I get hit while hooked but I got hooked that's my fault. I only get mad at teammates if they don't want to help. But y'all seriously need to calm the fuck down with proper game etiquette! THERE IS NO ETIQUETTE, there are only rules to the game that's it. Downvote me go ahead but some players agree with me and we are playing the game right. Y'all are just crybabies.
---
Had that happen a few times on PS4. I mostly noticed it's the hair that seems to be glowing through the walls which has happened in the past, devs can be good at returning some of the bugs.
---
You should do the killers. U never know if it works
---
I had this happen in my first match as well. Idk if the rank 2 was doing swf or not because he seemed surprised that he got a rank 20 killer. Keep in mind this happened at like 11 at night.
---
I don't give two fucks if I'm someone you don't want to know truthfully üòÇ I couldn't care less of what you think of me tbh. Not everyone likes gross jokes like you. Maybe learn to respect that, huh buddy? 
---
Such a waste of space
---
They were once like him, when the game first came out.
---
Damn, what a handsome face. Almost makes you forget that he's a horrible person. I like it!

If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[Yo can someone datamine mobile to see if there are upcoming killers in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9ld34/yo_can_someone_datamine_mobile_to_see_if_there/))
---
If I download it, am I going to be able to link my PC progress with the mobile versions? Also, how much each DLC will cost if I ever wish to buy something on Mobile if progress can't be linked?
---
I agree, I've been working on getting all my survivors to prestige 3 and the grind to get to prestige 3 is an absolute breeze compared to getting all the perks at tier 3. 
---
Spending like 50k+ BP per blood web for sooo many blood webs to get all those perks at tier 3 is a serious grind.
---
Netflix made a tweet saying they are working on projects with behaviour aka the devs.
---
Half a year ago, I played a game in which I got downed right next to the exit and I seemingly escaped by crawling into safety. However, when I spectated the game, I saw the killer sacrificing me on a hook lmao. Best of both worlds, considering that I got my escape bloodpoints and they got rewarded for killing me...
---
I guess that the endgame screen was consistent, however, as the killer immediately asked me if I had escaped.
---
Borrowed Time doesn‚Äôt need a rework.
---
Don‚Äôt camp. Don‚Äôt ignore a game mechanic.
---
&gt; New scoring events will be added for wiggling while being carried by the Killer and for healing other Survivors with a medkit, creating new opportunities to earn bloodpoints. Survivors will also be rewarded with survival points based on how long they survive in the match. Various existing scoring events will also be revisited and tweaked to provide a more rewarding experience, including an increase to the amount of points awarded for cleansing totems. These changes will offer players more freedom to play whichever side they like without impacting their bloodpoint earnings.
---
If point gains will become pretty close, there will be less incentive to play killer. We might see reversal queue times as a result, on top of higher average killer skill (as there will be less "casual" killers). 
---
Oh well, let's wait and see
---
If you have a good headset, whispers.
---
If not, I'd keep NOED everything else you aren't already running is borderline trash.
---
agreed. Right now it takes about two good survivor matches just to do a single bloodweb (not utilizing any offerings or WGLF). Even a poor killer match can easily eclipse that. i should know, i'm an awful killer!
---
Something similar to battle pass will be released in a future (fall 2019, if I'm not mistaken)
---
I know it‚Äôs a waste of money but I can‚Äôt stop myself
---
Humanoid killers only has been their motto for creation.
---
Except survivor mains are the scourge of the earth
---
It helps support the devs so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a waste of money!!
---
Which can be changed.
---
General reposti
---
Well it‚Äôs a waste of my money lmao
---
Tag
---
Could you propose how ? Without saying that they make hooked and dead survivors count, because thats litteraly what im suggesting
---
I think Netflix is very tactical with how it does its stuff.  the sheer amount of people who are kind of upset when Barb a character many people liked just died in such an anti-climatic way would be some sort of "gift"  to the fanbase if you want to call it that? we saw Bob actually die, whereas we just got the after effect with Barb
---
BAM! *disconnect*
---
If there‚Äôs a battle pass witch has a spirit bikini skin / a huntress bikini skin ima buy
---
Its completely useless now that hatch spawns no matter what. When hatch is closed gates auto power. Left Behind needs a complete rework.
---
I wish but we wont get the archives till chapter 13
---
Yep, if it‚Äôs the one I think you‚Äôre talking about I had to stop watching for a minute. The way Stefan just turned to him...
---
I just re-read the ability, my bad, I misunderstood somehow.
---
Basically had a group all bring in different items, and make me mad them to the different items after the mixed em up
---
wow nailed Ace and Jane
---
Thats excalty what im saying.
---
sauce?
---
It's all good, until the community actually gets our hands on the rework it'll continue to be pretty easy for people to misunderstand the specifics
---
Lol What is wrong with you? You seem to have taken this bad joke very personal, to the point where you're going mad with rage over me pointing out that it is just a joke lol. Take it easy buddy and learn to maybe not take bad jokes with the hostility of the Cold war.
---
Trying really hard to get leatherface to work atm
---
Outplayed tbh
---
He can hit non-sleeping survivors now, so waking up with self-care right infront of him will just lead to you getting hit anyway. Waking up mid-chase like that will mean he has to loop without his powers though, so it may still be effective to make him want to disengage atleast.
---
It realy just seems like we had a classic case of miscommunication.Thats what i talk about on ky post. What exactly did you think i was saying ?
---
You mean Discordance? Distortion is a survivor perk.
---
To be fair, Barb died at a time in the series where they were still concealing the demagorgon from us, the viewers.
---
Bob died when all hell had broken loose an demadogs were comendeering an entire building.
---
We got Barb's dead body, so there's that too.  Regardless of who it is, I would be hyped to have Stranger Things in DbD
---
You dare doubt mini myers
---
&gt; I had a mask on and even if I got off, I wouldnt escape for there was no time to get the damn thing off.
---
The RBT was put after gates were open (for RBT to activate a gen has to be repaired). So it's not active and you could safely escape through the gates.
---
nice my guy
---
New killer confirmed
---
Congrats console players
---
I'm 99% sure it won't happen
---
i played as the nurse and tried to go for a dude working on the gate and i was like 2 cm away from him, another one was the same situation but instead of 2 cm away i just teleported into the exit so he just saw me once he opened the gate, i could tell he was terrified cos he was injured and instantly yeeted outta there.
---
So, Valve finally relaxed. Good. In this case, Dead by Daylight: The Half-Life chapter when?
---
wholesome post i like it
---
Definitely. The original system was made for 4 survivors and worked okay, but once we doubled to 8 survivors it was too much of a grind. Now we‚Äôre getting close to doubling again and the old system is getting outdated for having so many characters. Definitely coming time for another rework
---
That actually scared tf outta me. Especially since you can hardly see the P3 LF until he starts his chainsaw
---
Not really impressive since this was probably shot at rank 20
---
I completely understand, I just want the DLC.
---
And random girl*
---
That's a pretty cool idea, actually.
---
Yeah, it's funny seeing them constantly call some of the biggest issues and bugs in the game "edge cases". It's all very politically-worded imo.
---
I think the gen teleport sounds pretty good. It's not an oppressively powerful mobility tool like Billy and nurse have, but it'll give Freddy an interesting map pressure tool and help him frequently get into the next chase quicker
---
Didn't see anything on optimization.
---
Hahahah
---
If you escape with an almost depleted medkit, you get to keep it and it fully charges for the next game?
---
Oh for real, i was told that it would still kill me, thanks for the info
---
What random girl?
---
It's pretty fun from what I've experienced
---
Not my cup of tea, but thanks for showing us!
---
Omg that's filthy.
---
This. I wanted to clarify that each person that is asleep reduced the cooldown by 15sec or so.
---
insidous leatherface back at it again. also i feel like that shoulda hit you, hitboxes don't work when they should and work when they shouldn't.
---
Perfect
---
https://youtu.be/_ypdDN388Xg?t=2647 the survivors get 5 seconds of warning/blood. Your 3 seconds doesn't include the animation.
---
And I'm not ignoring his traps - I already said they are shit. They are large and very obvious to see/avoid when you are asleep. You have to be completely asleep for them to affect you and when you are awake they don't affect you at all. If that's not a shit design then I don't know what is.
---
He phases like Spirit... terrific. I'm sure that will help a ton (this is sarcasm, his phasing won't mean shit. The Spirit is much more than her phasing). His traps will be avoided easily by everyone above 10 years old. Survivors will hide from his teleporting with no problem.
---
The more people asleep, the faster he teleports - I'll give you that. But his gen teleporting depends on what survivors do, not what the killer does. And the more gens get done, the less he can teleport. And he can't teleport at all in the end game.
---
They managed to find a way to fuck over a killer's teleportation the longer a trial started. How lucky are we that these idiots didn't create the Hag this year? She wouldn't be able to teleport at all during the end game, and when she teleports her husk would probably scream for several seconds to allow survivors to get a head start on running from you.
---
Nooooo, stop telling people how to make my games faster :(
---
Jokes aside, the only use for self care right now is against Freddy. No point in using it otherwise.
---
That‚Äôs right. I always get those names confused.
---
&gt;This also gives us an opportunity to strengthen the way we handle disconnections. Survivors who disconnect from a match will leave a ‚Äúhusk‚Äù behind. The Killer can then hook and sacrifice this husk to receive the points- and perk tokens where applicable- that they would have earned had the Survivor continued playing. Additionally, the other Survivors in the match will receive a quitter bonus to compensate for losing a teammate. Should a Killer disconnect, the match will immediately end, and the remaining Survivors will receive emblem points assuming they had healed and escaped the trial, keeping any items and add-ons they have equipped. Any offerings used will be refunded if the match is cancelled shortly after starting.
---
Yes!!! finally!
---
I'm not sure how they can? I haven't really seen any good ideas. Maybe being able to reopen the hatch?
---
That should be with the dedicated server oudh in the fall.
---
The teleport is gonna make certain perks nearly mandatory on him and if his snares are trash then pallets are gonna be a mandatory add on. Feel like he is gonna have a very specific build and we are gonna see the same shit over and over from him.
---
a dude downing all pallets and then DCing
---
Yeah, I don't understand the reasoning behind it at all.
---
You cannot depip past rank 15. There is a floor. Same as Rank 10. Yes after rank reset you can be deleveled past rank 15. That doesn't change the fact that the majority of the player base is above rank 15. Stop spreading misinformation with your 50 hours of f****** experience in the game
---
White Knight? Lol also I am bisexual I am literally gay on purpose all the time so again lol. Good bye it was a most displeasure to have ever talked to you.
---
Doesn't Ash have black hair with white in it? I love how every other character turned out though, good work!
---
Wrong. MW2019 will have crossplay, and rocket league had crossplay between Xbox and PS4 before epic bought its developer
---
I've never played as the hag. Is her FOV really that small? I feel like she should have seen you lol.
---
Killer is easier to play right now than it ever has been and survivors are at their weakest. If people don't want to play killer now, they never will do anyway. Hopefully this makes both sides feel as important and as significant as one another.
---
Monobilly?
---
Do you know this has been posted a ton on this subreddit?
---
Isn't it just... It will never happen again though.
---
i actually thought this was the picture at first. i‚Äôm not even kidding.
---
very, *very* good job
---
Perfect ‚ú®
---
So is the player not supposed to try to help his teammates survive while he teaches them the game? You sound like a pretty entitled killer player. Oh my God the audacity to bring a yellow tool box with sabo add-ons.
---
Three of the for our below rank 17 have nothing remotely close to a meta build and you have the audacity to say he's being bullied? Get the fuck over yourself.
---
I have looked everywhere, why lie bro?
---
Why tho
---
Lol 50 hours that‚Äôs just my work account and you know what I‚Äôm not trying to spread misinformation, from what all the people have said on here is what I was basing it off of, geeze someone pissed in your corn flakes!
---
Tbf the code is absolutely atrocious
---
Technically it can refer to a couple specific pallets on certain maps but universally the term is used to refer to the pallet inside the Killer Shack on each of the maps.
---
Target them all.........
---
Personally, I find being chased *way* more fun than chasing. I just tend to get tunneled frequently, so I get chased more often than not.
---
The demogorgon definitely doesn‚Äôt fit the definition of humanoid
---
Bro did you see the rank 2 on top
---
Honestly I think Legion should just be buffed. Now I know why he/she/they was/were nerfed, no reason to explain why, but I really do feel like he/she/they need it, Like maybe hitting survivors doesn't take away half of your Feral Frenzy meter, or increase the speed/duration for Feral Frenzy, something like that so that Legion isn't complete garbage.
---
You're free to that opinion, but personally I'll wait until I've actually played with/against reworked Freddy before I declare it not compelling or fun. I think reworked Freddy looks like he'll be more fun to play as and against than current Freddy. Maybe I'll be wrong. I always found Freddy's time delay mechanic to be absolutely ass to play against and look forward to seeing how the new sleep cycle will feel as survivor.
---
Should be able to see him outside of 32m
---
Cot√© has literally called them ‚Äúpay to lose‚Äù
---
Yes, they should be very careful with that. On top of this it means that survivors will have more access to items, meaning more insta heals and keys. Not that the game needs survivors to have those more consistently tbh..
---
Just please let us choose a server we want to connect to when dedicated servers goes live from a get go. I don't want to to be stuck on a "bad" server, with a questionable ping. I know you will have systems in place etc, but no one can tell which server is best for player than the person who is playing the game.
---
Also survivor point buff is a welcome addition to the game. Totem cleansing buff is nice, but can you add totem count metric to the game/create a perk to have it or just buff small game. NOED needs to have a sure counter if you are not changing it, not try to do totems, oh where was one hidden totem left, you are screwed. It will give survivors a true second objective and slow down gen rushing just a lil bit.
---
And I don't see devs addressing gen blowing/healing issue, when you get a skill check just as you let go of m1 button. It is just so unfair to give out your position just because you where unlucky. Make it like overcharge skill check already.
---
It's not crass, it's a logical assumption with the reasoning he has, besides better be safe than sorry
---
wow
---
they look like real!
---
except jeff, he looks like keanu reeves :D
---
Fantastic, thanks!
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
What exactly are you doing to turn off VSync? How can you tell it is being reverted?
---
I doubt it‚Äôd be that easy considering just hitting them once puts them to sleep
---
&gt;Barb would be a great survivor
---
I hate to break it to you, but.....
---
Devs specifically mentioned they will not be adding non human creatures to the game.
---
Not really a wtf moment but more of a cute/endearing one. I was playing killer on Yamaoka and I saw a survivor emoting and trying to get me into the house. I followed her into the area with the little shrine thingy and her and her other teammates had compiled a bunch of items around it as an offering. They seemed so proud of themselves that I couldn't bring myself to kill them.
---
I‚Äôm just curious but did they actually confirm that? I‚Äôm on OP‚Äôs side because I know they have the matching costumes and everything but I don‚Äôt think that really means anything y‚Äôknow? Like using that logic means Claudette is a fortune teller and Doctor was around during the Victorian times. Plus even when the animator guy made them dance he said he was doing it for fun and he shipped them, he didn‚Äôt say they were together canonically. Unless he did and I missed it...
---
As a player who balances between Killer and Survivor when playing, that Legion made me really upset.
---
Evil Within IV.
---
noone cares about c OMEGALUL nsole
---
Are we getting the new outfits anytime soon? I wasn't able to watch the stream
---
The funny part is that if she had just gone and looked for the hatch instead of wasting time like an idiot, the survivor would have died regardless of getting off the hook.
---
&gt; Totem cleansing buff is nice, but can you add totem count metric to the game/create a perk to have it or just buff small game
---
i wanted to add my support for this. I have no idea what the randos in my group are doing, or if they have cleansed any totems (unless i find the scraps). This would be a great change.
---
He went in a closet and teleported there
---
I've started hating playing survivor because it feels like such a waste of time BP-wise.  
---
Very happy it's gonna get more balanced.
---
benedict baker :P
---
Pharmacy underrated?
---
Just throw some D-Class at it then it'll stop eventually
---
If they buff survivor gains to a reasonable amount I may very well stop stressing myself out with the killer role.
---
&gt; gets downvoted for thanking someone
---
this is the true "welcome" of this community
---
That was their little brother playing on their account or some shit because no rank 1 could possibly be that bad lol.  That misplay was the stuff of legends.
---
1 simple Google search: 
---
https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/06/12/netflix-collabs-ubisoft-behaviour-interactive-epic-games/
---
Killer lobbies take forever as is.
---
Actual people who play both üëé     üëé
---
The amount of bullshit I see from both sides
---
Why isn't it 10/10 :(
---
https://youtu.be/IySgF0QyEEY
---
I followed that tutorial ^
---
I know it's being reverted because my fps is still capped at 62 and when I open my game files I can see that vsync has been set to true again
---
As someone who enjoys both these games, this is great!
---
Hag is actually one of the more difficult killers to play well due to the movement speed.  Most inexperienced killers just chase with her as an M1 killer and get rekt.  She's excellent if you know how to play her though.
---
Ok but theres also OC everyday, not just reposts. calm down
---
Historians hate them! One weird trick to double your box office!
---
Yes that‚Äôs the bad boi I meant
---
Saying toxic is in itself toxic.
---
Guys, if only 2 killers are viable at safe pallet loops, they're the ones you're gonna face at red ranks.
---
Having stronger killers will make for variety, but hey, we raise Ghosty up, and we cut him down. Enjoy your Nurse + Spirit future.
---
r/thatsthejoke
---
This... THIS is what I meant
---
Some guy reported me for finding him behind a tree and says I used wallhacks even though I heard him grunting from hitting him. Reporting does nothing.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt really target people based on the items they have. The only time I might do it is if they have a key, but it‚Äôs not worth it for a toolbox or medkit.
---
SF/End? Even Tru3 has dropped that lackluster build.
---
Fast chases are meaningless without gen-defence.
---
&gt;A new map that‚Äôs fully indoors, like a psych ward
---
did you mean lerys?
---
pls no
---
 with doors they could just disapear by urban evasioning to left or right
---
Whoever you want.
---
Oh you're right, he does! I don't know why I thought his hair was brown, shows how often I play him lol. Oh well
---
When me and my friends first got it, we did a bunch of KYF, and one of them had immediately bought Myers, and since we were all new and barely played real matches, none of us had ever played against him. It was safe to say we didn't have a very normal match.
---
10 seconds.
---
If you're asleep you can see him fully regardless of distance
---
Here's a bigger brain play: Bring a Shroud of Separation to make them think you have a Mori at all.
---
Wait, they nerfed it again?! and now it only does 1/4 progression wtf
---
I'd recommend kindred as that can also help if they are just being dumb and assuming someone else will save.
---
after you edit the file and save it, mark it read only. but be warned this may keep any other (potentially necessary) changes from being made automatically.
---
Freddy sucks to play against right now, but I play killer so it doesn't effect me.
---
I also rate my fun by 4 killing, which limits killers, I haven't bought a killer In a long time because none of them have been viable :/. Ill wait and see but I wont be holding my breath based on what ive read for the changes.
---
Is the good headset necessary? Can't you just rely on the perk lighting up?
---
GF, Mikey, and Legion as well (Frank). Although currently I‚Äôm playing a lot of pig trying to get all teachables and she‚Äôs pretty fun.
---
Safety net. Lol. Is sprint burst a safety net?
---
We are all here but to anguish
---
How do I set it to read only?
---
Watching PC streams over the years, those jeans always stuck out to me. I had originally thought they were included in the Charity Case dlc. And why I was beyond estatic when they announced it was finally coming to console. 
---
The day we got it, I went straight to Meg's pants to proudly equip...no bueno. That's when I did some actual research on the wiki, and saw that Bill also came with cosmetics for select survivors.
---
Unfortunately, I no longer play Meg! (Ha Ha). So enjoy them!
---
You are missing something. Combine Thrilling Tremors with BBQ and Chili, and by the time you've hooked the survivor, you can tell exactly where survivors are, no matter what. Working on a gen? They're ready for a teleport, and you can even tell WHICH gen. Not working on a gen? You can still go right over to it. Though, running both perks means no chase perks.
---
Very talented. I love to draw, this is amazing well done man
---
Create a swf group
---
Chance steam names to respective colors and wait for the veeeeery small chance
---
Nice but I don't share the same feelings. The fact that the cosmetics are so expensive show how greedy the devs really are. Let alone, incompetent.
---
Other people have said it doesn‚Äôt matter, which is mostly true, but the only real danger of a medley is an insta-heal, while the toolbox can completely destroy gen times. So it doesn‚Äôt matter that much, but if you‚Äôre one of those people who must have an order then toolboxes usually take priority.
---
I‚Äôd like to know if more killers are coming too
---
Bill is Free 
---
Yeah boiiis
---
You don't need to be asleep anymore tk be hit, but in what world can you self care for a split second and get a skill check?
---
I hope it become a thing, like 2 vs 6 or 3 vs 8
---
I've seen that happen too. But instead of on the roof they end up in a wall.
---
JoJo + DBD = Auto-Upvote
---
Mao really coming through with the big IQ guess.
---
Im not new by any means, im a rank 5. But wahtever i guess
---
That would be awesome that survivors had different poses based on your level.
---
You need to look up the definition of sexism. Not everything is sexist just because it pertains to someone's sex.
---
Attempting this for the next 6 months, great idea thanks. Will come back when we've got it.
---
He was down before the last door, me after, plus i nevercgot off of hook
---
Good troll.
---
And this makes you a hero, how?
---
my apologies, i implied that the "welcome" was to the DbD subreddit, as you stated this was your first post.
---
As other people are saying, it seems like a flaw that Freddy full on loses half his power (teleport) when the 5th gen finishes. 
---
An idea: once the gens are finished, Freddy's teleport shifts to lockers. I know thatd take a different animation so it's highly unlikely to be added at this stage.. but just throwing around ideas
---
If you mean do people play it, I have it on Xbox and it takes less than a minute to get into a game as survivor, and 5-10 as killer.
---
Lol swing and a miss.  If you think a perk that rewards you with haste and an instadown for playing like shit and not protecting objectives is the same as an exhaustion perk I don't know what to tell you.  The correct example on survivors side would have been old decisive and old MoM but one was reworked to be balanced and more fair while the other was reworked to be so putrid noone would run it anymore.  NOED is currently the biggest crutch perk remaining in the game.
---
Even the Scoops anchor looks like a hook! Make it so!
---
I feel like hexy is a good dude, but sometimes he says the stupidest shit ever that gets on my nerves. He‚Äôs not a good killer nor survivor either, I got placed in a match with him and he left all of us like a pussy when we kept on saving his dumbass earlier on the match. So yeah I died on my first hook while he ran out the gate like a pussy laughing at all of us that got left behind... I no longer have respect for the dude.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what I said?  Lol
---
Thanks for the spoilers ass
---
Alright I see that situation and I raise you another one. Didn‚Äôt the devs talk about the whole stalk thing and say that‚Äôs not supposed to happen and that‚Äôs the nerf he‚Äôs getting.
---
That's a good counter
---
Also, you're probably not gonna escape if you just run away. The real counters to Spirit are : walking when uninjured, change directions, fake scratch marks, break line of sight so she can't see how you try to juke her and then be unpredictable, run Iron Will and Spine Chill ( a very good Spirit is gonna down you without Iron Will ). 
---
Not just running away, any competent Spirit doesn't fall for that.
---
&gt;Pretty sure he‚Äôs still visible when you‚Äôre fully asleep
---
um nope
---
Dm me ur psn
---
Hahahaha üòÇüëè so this is why I don't see anyone playing as her lol.
---
ellis dwight
---
Yes, and you said: ‚Äúwhen fully asleep freddy is invinsible‚Äù
---
But its already summer 2019. and 58 days till fall.
---
I‚Äôve only escaped him once. I‚Äôm not the best player. But he eventually gets me. That stalk really scared me the first time. He was right next to me and I jumped out of my seat. I like the challenge.
---
What do you mean? We know more killers are coming based on the year 4 roadmap
---
You need to suggest this to the devs in every way possible. That is the best idea I've ever read.
---
nvm im dumb
---
it says he is not INvisible not visible sorry xd
---
No worries, hahaha, I was so genuinely confused where this comment thread went wrong üòÇ
---
It worked, thank you
---
Killer is better, survivor too hard, spirit killing it.
---
I‚Äôm on console so idk if it effects my matchmaking time. Seems pretty quick to find a game.
---
Altruistic mechanics? Yes. Team mechanics? No. There is literally nothing in this game to stop me from leaving your ass to die by the killer and going through the hatch so I survive. This is most definitely not a team game.
---
It worked, thank you. Hopefully nothing gets screwed up later down the line, I'm willing to take the risk though
---
I'll be waiting
---
His brain kinda stopped for a second then rebooted and the other 2 looked at him a few seconds to make sure he was ok lol
---
Its so amazing
---
Bubba/Doctor/Michael (in order of playtime) mains rise up
---
For mobile? Cause that‚Äôs what the thread is about and if so link?
---
Just did
---
Ohh yeah, I definitely know what that feels like. I hope he realizes we all want the best for him if he does happen to see this.
---
Wait
---
I recognize that username XD
---
Also Suzie and pig are my waifus fight me
---
cringe- to bend one's head and body in fear or in a servile manner.  lol I‚Äôm happy to provide this service!
---
When the hell did everybody become so goddamn serious about everything religion, racism, politics. Or the much reviled camping, my post wasn‚Äôt intended to upset, antagonize, provoke or even ‚Äúcringe‚Äù and if anyone has felt any of those, chill the fuck out lol. It was a honest post with my bitch I havnt been looped in months but with leatherface I was a loopin fiasco lol, if it was the ‚Äúgatcha bitch‚Äù part I‚Äôm sure thousands of killers have said same thing, I‚Äôm not saying that player you are a bitch I grab your bitchiness way and treat u as such. The way I grew up that‚Äôs how all my friends talk to each other we all will talk shit yea bitch mother fc%#er, with big cheesiness ass grins on our our faces, all in fun. So in closing CHILL. WoooSaaaa drink some earl gray tea, whatever just calm down people
---
But then it goes back to what I said earlier:
---
&gt; that makes it so that Freddy's chase power is only usable when survivors are asleep
---
which means that Freddy's traps and stuff will only be good for literally half of the chase.
---
Wrong thread
---
I accept ur beginning statment and thank your second

Lock out timers is great and all, but that won't stop someone from DCing, making lunch, then coming back just in time for the timer to end so that they can do it again. That timer needs to be in hourly increments, then after a few more dcs it needs to be increased to days.
---
That's a sad 4th of July....
---
I love this!
---
There is nothing wrong with the build. It's a decent build but not toxic. DS only triggers if you tunnel. If you don't then survivors are left with 3 perks. Self heal is a waste of time imo.
---
Basically be a new mechanic, based on the map, tbh would spice up game play a lot
---
He can hit anyone anytime regardless of sleep status, people now fall asleep every 60 seconds passively, he can set blood traps to slow down survivors, he can teleport to generators, and theres an add on that replaces his blood traps with fake pallets he can put up. PTB for these changes begins the 9th
---
he can always hit you dream or not, if you're not asleep you fall asleep right away, you also fall asleep on a timer iirc
---
Ans you are proving you console babies trully are babies by the way you behaving
---
This game just gets better and better wow you guys blow me away
---
AAAAH MY MANS IS PLAYABLE NOW
---
In order of most played.
---
Trapper, Huntress, Freddy.
---
I love my low tier crew
---
Not exactly what previous post was talking about, but quite good in my opinion. 
---
[scp-2950](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2950)
---
Agreed.
---
Because this rework is shit?
---
1 nd half years for coping other killers power??
---
Pass

One does not simply give nurse eyes

The survivor should obviously be Will since the demogorgon story arc is all about him. He could be like the Oddjob of DBD.
---
‚ÄúMy friend Keith, he once hid in a closet for *sixteen days.* He weren‚Äôt hiding from monsters or nothing, though. Naw, he was hooking up with this girl and her parents came home early and they could *not* know he was there. We sent out search parties and everything. After two weeks everyone thought he was dead. When her dad eventually found out, I tell you, he beat the ever loving‚Äî‚Äú
---
‚ÄúDwight.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù
---
Shape is a pretty fun one to play, but you have to play him for a little to learn him.
---
See at the end of the day it's a game. And it feels horrible to get camped. It's not fun and while you're right, it is strategic to keep surviving, it isnt very fun to be doing that.
---
It's not. She absolutely should have seen her multiple times and heard her as well. This hag is a bot
---
I actually dig it if it works as it seems, I love how he animates from the survivor perspective with blood. I‚Äôll miss the aura reading though. I definitely think it wouldn‚Äôt hurt if he had it considering how easy it is to break out of sleep.
---
I‚Äôm here before the comment :(
---
Usually its smarter to target survivors with toolboxes rather than Med kits. Toolboxes make the game go faster by allowing survivors to finish gens faster. This is bad and means you will usually have less time to chase the other survivors if toolbox survivors are left too work on gens.
---
There is a risk associated with targeting a survivor with a med kit. If the survivor has an instant heal they can remove the pressure of being injured mid-chase and extend the chase you have with them which wastes more of your time while allowing the other survivors to work on generators.
---
It does. I thought it was Nea.
---
Not sure what happened.
---
I asked if he lag switched, he said no. I told him it was bs and that I wasn't mad, just confused lol. So I sent him this clip. He then decided to taunt me and tell me im trash and so was my team. I was playing alone and he is convinced we were swf. Told him I mainly play killer and was just trying to escape with a new item. Wanted to know my rank as killer, "2" then called me trash. Asked my main "Clown" called me trash again. Ignored all of it and said gg. This community really sucks ass sometimes.
---
He was using prayer beads and an ebony mori and was so proud apparently. Didn't argue, don't care lol. Enjoy the clip and pray it doesn't happen to you.
---
Will Bill have to be payed for with shards/cells or be free to play?
---
They downvite you cause you're right
---
This rework feelz underwelmimg, it took the developers far too much time to develop this reworked power, which turned out to be similar to other killer powers
---
You happy now?
---
Hasn‚Äôt even been released to the PTB and people are saying he‚Äôs S tier lmaoooooo 
---
Seriously though, toxic survivors will say new Freddy is OP, and all I ask is that behavior ignores them and doesn‚Äôt make new Freddy have a million caveats and counters. Give him is good map pressure, leave his snares alone, and leave his fake pallets alone. On paper, all of his different powers have counterplay, so please don‚Äôt nerf him.
---
If you're not P3-50ing Bubba you're not living life right. Camping is for bitches, except for when survivors all horde the hook. #BubbaSquad
---
Yeah.
---
Chapters that have a killer and survivor cost 7usd if they are not on sale. 
---
The ones that have only a killer (Ghostface, Ash, Leatherface) cost a bit less.
---
At least that's how it is on pc, dunno about consoles.
---
Spirit hands down because she is so unpredictable and able grab survivors off gens so that‚Äôs why I main her, she is so fun to play
---
To get around this people will just give up in a different way like giving up on the hook etc
---
Apparently if you force close the app you keep your item and offering, but you lose a pip. I guess that's why people do it.
---
It is, it's based on Ed Gein. Turned people into couches.
---
he prob has no idea about the dbd lore
---
You forgot that one person who  introspectively takes 45 fucking minutes to spend BP and decide if they wanna buy one perk over the other on a killer they're not currently playing just in case because they might one day of you know instead hitting READY and fucking playing the game.
---
For me it happens on the exit switchs too
---
Spirit/wraith
---
I agree with Ochido, but what‚Äôs wrong with noob? You a Pug fanboy or somethin?
---
I think twinkle toes is one of the best killers to play.
---
2 v 6 wouldn‚Äôt be fair...
---
Yeah personally reskinnig pallets in some areas, like the ruins (broken pillars) and lerry's (maybe wheel chairs) would be a nice start
---
Then adding extra stuff like doors 
---
Maybe reskin gens to breaker boxes in some maps
---
And other bits like that would be awesome
---
Back to the doors i imagine it like survivors could reopen them, but it makes a loud noise and takes roughly the same time as opening a chest, makes it risk reward on both sides
---
Killers could leave doors to turn certain rooms into traps, and survivors wouldn't be as bad off that way
---
Plus certain maps would have both so a nice mix of objects
---
Yeah that probably wont happen, not fully unmasked anyway I wouldn't imagine
---
Thanks i have some new friends to the game who insist on healing everytime they get hit while in a group where one of us actively runs the killer...
---
And yet you still run self-care.
---
No the demogorgon is definitely humanoid. But the xenomorph is weird since some of them are and some aren't but either way demogorgon is without a doubt humanoid
---
I reaaally hope this is what their partnership is

Clearly.

I can‚Äôt ki-ki-ki, ma-ma-ma without getting closer.

But cool pic tho üëç
---
Killers complain about SWF when in reality they probably A) suck or B) got paired up with randoms that can figure out teamwork. Ranks dont mean anything considering the ranking system is jacked up from queue times. I've been getting thrown in with rank 20 killers all week and I'm climbing past rank 10 now
---
Have you ever run Kate‚Äôs Windows of Opportunity perk? It‚Äôs a really good tool to help you learn the maps better, you see every pallet and window within a certain range around you. I found it really helpful when I was trying to learn how to basically not instantly go down every time. I still run it regularly on maps I struggle with. 
---
If you pair that perk with Lithe, Dance with Me, and Quick and Quiet, you can straight up houdini out of there. Don‚Äôt have to stay up long in a chase if you can lose the killer after one vault.
---
Don‚Äôt call me out like this. Cmon man.
---
He should have a method of tracking, but pure aura reading would be broken considering that all survivors fall asleep all the time.
---
It's okay I enjoyed this more than the other one
---
Devs specifically won‚Äôt nerf bbq since there‚Äôs no other reason to buy his dlc. Same reason it‚Äôs almost never on shrine
---
Derp.
---
End of summer now from what I read the forum... hopefully we get it then can‚Äôt wait! No more relying on scrubs trash internet! Plus they will be punishing assholes who DC all the time because it‚Äôs not going there way!
---
Thank you kind stranger
---
360s are cool but the moonwalking was just cold. He was obviously a baby wraith. You dont need to do him like that...
---
Wait who? Dedicated servers nah nah that was canceled man they ain‚Äôt coming!
---
Dead Hard alone elevates David higher.  That is sacrilegious.  Absolutely better than Aces bullshit.
---
I feel even less trustworthy now
---
David has Dead Hard, one of the best exhaustion perks because of invincibility frames. Hw‚Äôs also got WGLF which is the best bloodpoint farming perk in the game for survivor. I agree with the rest though
---
Go go power rangers!
---
What the fuck....oh....It's just Freddy uWu
---
i mean you didn't do too bad all things considered
---
My hillbilly is level 50 and BBQ hasnt appeared yet. Pepehands
---
Thats a lag switch without a shadow of a doubt.
---
You realize bhvr makes mobile games right
---
Well i dont trust your judgement also
---
Defo lag switched. Hope dedicated servers fix the issue... I also hope they fix hatches so they cant be closed while jumping into them...
---
Kate looks exactly like Ashley Benson
---
Can you link the previous one?
---
I think it‚Äôs fine. I like when killers have multiple options in terms of skills. They‚Äôre typically more fun to play. What I worry about is, even if he‚Äôs fine as is, will add ons make him op as fuck and not fun to play against.
---
This is obviously a swf. Don‚Äôt play it off as if it wasn‚Äôt. The ranking system isn‚Äôt this bad, it‚Äôs not perfect but no way in hell its this bad
---
Wow Freddy is gonna rake...
---
Thrilling Tremors + Discordance + BBQ &amp; Chili
---
You literally won‚Äôt be able to work on a generator...
---
what were you even going for here? just memeing cuz you knew you fucked up?
---
I think no one really cares about mobile gaming, in general.
---
Seen what?
---
David I put low because of no mither. Honestly, I thought about WGLF putting him at C tier, but since it has no affect in the trial other than up to an additional 8,000 bloodpoints per trial with no other benefits, I decided to discard the perk. Dead hard is good, but it doesn't out shadow that David comes with potentially the worst perk in the game.
---
Ace is S-tier and you can't change my mind
---
Fucking yes. I'd sell my soul for this.
---
Thank you for enjoying it enough to want it to possibly use haha
---
without survivor mains there wouldn‚Äôt be a game lol
---
Sounds extremely interesting to play. Can't wait to see it in action.
---
I know, but he also has no mither, which is why I put him so low. His other two perks are good, But I can't justify myself putting the character who comes with the worst perk in the game in a good tier.
---
See how many people are in the game....
---
Agreed dead hard can be a crutch perk even if the killer knows to wait for it. Countless times it‚Äôs given me enough distance to pallets or a window vault. Also if you 360 to bait a swing and dead hard 90% of killers fall for it.
---
Stretched cheese over pepperoni is all Freddy is, tho'.
---
I don't like it because I have to slug even if there 4 or 5 gens left, which takes abit more time.
---
They're actually pretty accurate especially mah boi bill
---
Missed every skillcheck, magically hit decisive and  got out because my teammates were really helpful
---
Really like the increase to survivor bp earnings. Just makes sense to incentivize the side that requires a 4:1 ratio of players. Otherwise you end up with exactly the problem they‚Äôre describing.
---
New guy was VERY quite, like he never spoke unless spoken to.
---
The moris have gotten a lot better with each killer but can we please go back to first person views for the killer
---
And why should I trust yours?
---
I get that No Mither is horrid.  You're looking at all 3.  Just god damn dead hard is good lol.  You can make so many different types of plays with it.  But I do understand where you're coming from.
---
Oh dear
---
It's a very boring strategy and sometimes you might only get 1 kill. I don't even understand why I get camped half the time. I am not great at loops, I don't bring in a flashlight, and I don't excessively tbag (I will double tap to say hello to the killer or thank you). All the things that killers complain about I don't do. It use to be so much fun on ps4. A lot of my friends have stopped playing too. That is part of the reason I have gone to pc. Best of luck out there in the fog
---
I agree with this, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, and with the buff to Streetwise and Urban Evasion with Sprint Burst. Great list, Meg Mains Master Race.
---
im hyped for diaper pants dwight
---
So a bunch of killer buffs? If I‚Äôm understanding this right, all killers get a 5th perk just for hexes, which you are also buffing. What makes you think people wouldn‚Äôt just continue to use Nurse, Billy, and Spirit now with an additional perk, leading to a dominant win any time they please? Definite pass on all of this. Since the implementation of EGC, it‚Äôs very likely that kill rates are near 50% even in high rank. What you are proposing isn‚Äôt at all necessary unless you want to give some buffs to survivors too.
---
Hitting that decisive was is easily the best 5hing to ever happen to me in dbd
---
i wish the fake pallets were part of his base kit
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
Then it expands and he still uses it, and then doesn't appear in the final battle *glares at a big green guy*
---
Iron will trumps all of tapp‚Äôs perks.
---
Also nea only has balanced landing
---
And bill is above claudette
---
Yeah, there will be a massive increase of people killing themselves on first hook 30 seconds in. There will always be deranking, even if it‚Äôs a slower -1 pip at a time route
---
Here you go https://youtu.be/AMtRRTvmYpM
---
I think I sounded a bit aggressive. Sorry about that
---
No, rly, I'm a killer main, and I try playing Ace more often than not. Even tho I still get only one or two fun games, I just can't handle the amount of pressure of playing survivor, and I deeply respect every GOOD and NON-TOXIC survivor out there.
---
I mean, I'm no good at surv anyways, still green rank, but the amount of self-control and cold blood you must need to hear the heartbeat radius and keep your shit together, knowing where to go without panicking... That's something that I really respect. 
---
To all u good Survivor Mains out there, keep giving me and other Killer Mains some good challenges, u guys are fkng great &lt;3
---
Jeff needs to be HIGHER!!He has amazing perks
---
What are you even on about..
---
Trash code can kill great ideas
---
Bullshit aside, Nea is VERY pretty. Her eyeliner makeup make her steel blue eyes pop! She needs long hair cosmetics, and not ones that make her look like Skrillex.
---
I have only run into this a couple of times. It is so annoying

Please excuse me if this link doesn't work, I'm on mobile and I'm not sure if it works

the cool thing is that the liscensed cosmetic may be available for shards :0

Atleast he didnt say vommy mommy
